978696,Steve,2016-08-05 22:20:00,2075,"drifter, what is the point of what you are showing?  that fires can occur?  I'm not sure the message you're trying to convey?"
978699,Bill Shearer,2016-08-05 22:29:00,456,"The chances are that he is showing wind power is not as clean as the proponents would have us believe, I am totally against the huge towers with the blades. Solar makes more sense to me even though the landscape is altered.  Those freakin huge windmills are a huge blight on the land. iMO"
978703,Steve,2016-08-05 22:35:00,2075,ok. that is a fair point.  but the video doesn't describe what you have suggested.  it shows a fire.  fires can happen at any power generation station. (including solar).  if anything fires are safer at wind turbines than any other form of power production as the fire cannot spread to 1st party or 3rd party property.

The language I don't recognize, sounds Indian, Punjabi or south east Asian. Any facts?  The guys camera work is wonky because every time debris flew he ducted. He is closer than the video shows."

Some of those ponds were pushing 20 acres in size and stocked with fish, now the trend here is to fill them with fly ash and other waste from the coal fired electric plants! Oh the horror! Fill in fish factories?"
978813,KLINKER,2016-08-07 15:38:00,256,There is another one out where a big turbine is on fire with 5 guys trapped on it. all died.
