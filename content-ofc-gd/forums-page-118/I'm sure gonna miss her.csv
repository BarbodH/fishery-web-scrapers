978486,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-03 23:12:00,8243,"You got me Lew. I thought you lost your old dog. Selling a boat you love hurts too. I am not able to justify keeping my 19 footer because I am not using it enough either in the past few years. It seems the winds are getting worse every year here on Erie and all my fishing buds have boats of their own. My wife has been out once in the last 2 years with me, and it blew up that day too. If it was a business decision it would be a no brainer. They say the 2 best days are the day buying a boat and selling it. Bull."
978488,crappieperchhunter,2016-08-03 23:33:00,2582,"My brother made the same call last year Lew, after talking about it for 2 or 3 years.  He never was a hard core fisherman but also used his boat for towing the kids around on inflatables and such. Well his kids grew up and he used the boat less. Then he got a trailer and hooked up with a group of friends who all had bigger boats for fishing out of Meaford...so he used his boat even less. Much like you he kept her in mint shape. Whoever ended up with it got one helluva deal.  Nice to hear you passed your boat onto a fellow muskie man who with appreciate it and keep it slimed."
978490,Weeds,2016-08-03 23:49:00,782,Stick a corvette in that garage. Betcha that you'll feel better!
978493,Rizzo,2016-08-04 00:02:00,4754,"That is definitely tough news, and it sounds like many of us here can empathize. When we moved from Barrie to Guelph, we had a similar decision. Our cottage in Parry Sound was just going to be too far away. We made the (very) difficult decision to sell it. Now we just go and rent a couple times a year. For us it was the right decision, and it certainly sounds like it is the right decision for you....not that that makes it any more easy to do. That is an awesome boat, I remember when you bought it. It will bring the new owner much joy and I am sure this is not the last time you will be fishing out of it!"
978494,npt1,2016-08-04 00:06:00,220,"​I walked by my boat  one day and saw that the tires were indenting the asphalt drive way, the light came on. ​This boat only moves now two weeks a year. Realized it was time to part ways, paying insurance on something ​I rarely used any more, sold it in 1 day, first ""looker"" met my asking price for boat and trailer. ​Sold the motor separately for more than I paid for it the next weekend. ​Don't miss it at all. Just got interested in other things. ​"
978495,Steve,2016-08-04 00:09:00,2075,interesting on how many folks talk about insurance....  not many folks I know insure their boats....guess it all depends on the value.
978511,Gallie,2016-08-04 02:59:00,1215,"Thats tough lew, im sure it feels better knowing its going to a good place. Hopefully it sees a lot more slime yet!"
978520,lew,2016-08-04 12:26:00,12766,"Good to hear I'm not the only one to get rid of boats that aren't being used enough.  Only issue that came up was when we book a cabin, specially for 2 weeks, we always haul a pile of stuff with us. I've got a short box pick-up so a lot of the bigger bulkier items would be carried in the boat along with my 8' rods so I needed another alternative so I bought a cap with roof racks on it.  I'll just store it at back of the yard when not being used.  Should work well.  "
978521,DanD,2016-08-04 12:34:00,2223,Stick a corvette in that garage. Betcha that you'll feel better! I think Lew is more of a Ford man.  So maybe on of these 2016 GT40s would be a better fit? LOL  Dan. 
978529,PUMP KNOWS,2016-08-04 13:36:00,937,Beautiful boat and wow...an amazing space of a garage.
978531,AKRISONER,2016-08-04 13:45:00,5558,something tells me that big old space is going to end up with some kind of project vehicle sitting in it very soon.
978555,lew,2016-08-04 16:49:00,12766,Funny with the mention of the Corvette and then the Ford GT cause  for the last year I've been telling my wife we'd look REAL good cruising around these back country roads in a brand new yellow corvette convertible.  Don't think I've quite got her convinced yet though
978563,Big Cliff,2016-08-04 19:23:00,6899,"Funny with the mention of the Corvette and then the Ford GT cause  for the last year I've been telling my wife we'd look REAL good cruising around these back country roads in a brand new yellow corvette convertible.  Don't think I've quite got her convinced yet though And it'll sit in the garage for 7 or 8 months a year, only get taken out on nice days when it's warm and the sun is shining, you'll be paying a premium for insurance because it's a convertible...... Sue always wanted a 57 T-Bird, we did the math, it would cost a lot less to just rent one when we wanted to go for a ride LOL."
978565,DanD,2016-08-04 19:44:00,2223,"Or go the route I did, with my 50 Chevy.    $48.00 a year for full insurance coverage; due to it being classed as historic.  Cheep driving after the inital cost of purchase and restoration.  Dan."
978568,lew,2016-08-04 20:07:00,12766,"Fella I worked with did a complete frame off restoration on the exact same car as yours Dan, right down to the little blue dot on the tail light and yours looks every bit as nice....you did a really  beautiful job.  Those old Chevy's were gorgeous cars for sure and had a pile more style & class than most of the cookie cutter stuff they're putting out today."
978402,lew,2016-08-03 09:47:00,12766,"I was a lucky guy and was born into a family who absolutely loved fishing and my Dad got me into the sport waaaay back about 1950. We always had a boat and my earliest memories go back to learning how to fish out of this cedarstrip and that rod & reel Dad's using is probably the outfit  I learned with.  Great memories ...    I enjoyed fishing my whole life and then 40 odd years ago I got my 1st musky and my focus turned to them and for the last 4 decades musky was basically the only fish I chased. We had a house trailer in the Kawarthas for 36 years and I always had a boat and spent a crazy amount of time travelling around the area musky fishing. There's an insane amount of muskies in the Kawarthas and for the most part they're very easy to catch and getting multiple fish a day is the norm, infact one morning I boated 9 fish in 2 hours. I used to average around 80 - 100 fish a year and my best season was 115 fish.  Trouble is the Kawartha muskies for the most part are smaller fish compared to a lot of Ontario. There's lots of fish in the high 40's and over the years I was able to get quite a few over 50 but there's just too many  small fish and after many years I began to lose interest in the area.  I live right in the heart of the Kawarthas and am only 200' from Clear Lake but haven't fished here in 2-3 years.  I enjoy fishing the Ottawa & St. Lawrence but my favorite place is the West Arm of Nippissing and I've been going up there 2-3 weeks a year for about 12 years now. Not near the numbers of musky but when you get one it's almost always a good fish with most in the high 40's to low 50's.        Trouble is the last couple years my boat has sat in my garage 49 weeks a year and only gets wet up on Nippissing as the only fishing I do now is a week in June and a couple more in August.  A group of us from this board head up to Mashkinonge Lodge on the West Arm every June for the musky opener and  Regan who owns the place is a musky nut like me. We've fished together a few times and he always liked my boat and said he wanted a glass boat and he'd like to buy it. I've thought about selling it for a couple years so a few weeks back I made the tough decision to sell it and just use a camp boat when I head north.  My wife and I are heading up to Memquisit next week for a couple weeks and I've already reserved a  boat for the trip.  It's a fantastic boat and I hated to part with it but it just didn't make sense to have it just sitting in the garage collecting dust 49 weeks a year.  Regan made the drive down yesterday and picked it up and I don't mind saying it was tough to see it heading down the road with him  Been a very long time since I was boatless but it was the best decision and it's for sure gone to a great new home.  Here it is in my garage just before it left.    Heading out my driveway for the last time.    Sure gonna miss her and my garage looks so darned empty now.    I've put some very nice muskies in that boat and she's well slimed and I know for sure Regan will continue the tradition."
978406,Fisherpete,2016-08-03 10:36:00,1814,"I'm sure it was not an easy decision to let her go Lew but yeah if it's not being used then guess it's the right thing to do...  I've started fishing the bigger bodies of water like LOTW, St. Clair and the Larry and yes some of the specimens that come out of there can't be found in the Kawarthas - that being said I still enjoy the numbers to be had here and how close it is."
978407,DanD,2016-08-03 10:38:00,2223,Lew I know exactlly how you are feeling right now; I sold my boat 3-4 years ago for the same reasons. Couldn't justify it sitting and only being used on Bass opener weekend and a week up on the West arm. Most camps now have decent rentals; just got back this week from Elk Lake and the boat we rented from Elk Lake Resort was a very well equiped machine. There might be another boat for me in the future; but have mixed feelings. I'm never as comfortable in a rental; I don't know all of its quirks and its abilities. I'm thinking maybe a pontoon in or around the 20-22 foot range; it could be my fishing platform and a nice comfy coutch for the wife to come out with me?  Dan.
978408,ckewley,2016-08-03 10:48:00,699,"It may be bitter sweet now, but just look at the awesome garage you have, very nice!"
978413,vance,2016-08-03 12:13:00,719,"Basically for the same reasons I sold my boat last year,I loved that boat and I had a tear in my eye when it rolled away so I can feel your pain.   vance"
978414,manjo39,2016-08-03 12:21:00,354,So it's not true that the best two days of owning a boat is the day we buy and the day we sell.
978418,Lape0019,2016-08-03 13:09:00,647,"First off, nice fish pics!  Secondly, your boat was gorgeous but I totally understand your reasoning for letting her go. If my boat only got used that often, it would be for sale quite quickly."
978419,Lape0019,2016-08-03 13:10:00,647,Double post
978420,OhioFisherman,2016-08-03 13:27:00,6623,It looks like you have room now for that bingo hall you always wanted! Ah! the golden years!
978421,woodenboater,2016-08-03 13:37:00,2277,that's tough to do esp seeing it driven out the driveway but 49 weeks a year is too long and I hope you'll get to rent the old boat when yer up at Maskinonge  now about that garage. that is GINORMOUS !!! I would kill to have that garage at my home lol  enjoy memquisit Lew !
978423,landry,2016-08-03 13:48:00,1005,That's tough. I love my boat - would've hard to send her off without a replacement in the way. And that is a beautiful boat Lew. Wow.
978425,glen,2016-08-03 14:08:00,2641,Can I buy your gps chip.   Now that your not fishing as much what do you do with your time? I don't fish much anymore either.
978434,Beans,2016-08-03 15:27:00,3339,"Hey Lew...I miss ""The Tin of Beans"" when I look out over the lake while shorefishing... This is not a GARAGE...it is a spare room...  This is a garage !!!"
978436,grimsbylander,2016-08-03 15:31:00,3016,"Usually the right decisions are the hardest to make. Must have been tough to watch her go.  I'm not much of a musky guy, ok...near zero of a musky guy, but if you ever want to chase musky bait(bass) or do some musky fishing with a greenhorn, I would gladly share my boat with you."
978437,Mike Pike,2016-08-03 15:34:00,1332,"Lew, your garage is nicer than my home.  Bet there's always a bud around who'll share a boat with ya, Lew."
978438,Rich Clemens,2016-08-03 15:44:00,3131,"You did it ...  You really did it. But, even if you rent a boat, I'll still be out fished. Good luck when you head back up to Memquisit.   Hope you get another 50+."
978441,Pigeontroller,2016-08-03 15:57:00,2793,"Tough, but sensible decision. You always have a spot in my boat Lew."
978446,Dan668,2016-08-03 16:29:00,1120,"Must have been a tough decision. Beautiful boat, i am currently at mashkinonje and checked it out with Regan."
978447,lew,2016-08-03 16:29:00,12766,"Thanks boys, good to know most agree that it's foolish to keep a boat sitting in the garage most of the time when someone else could be using it.  I've also sold off most of my musky gear and have just kept a couple rods and a few baits that I know work up on Nipissing.  And for those that have offered me a seat in their boat, thanks very much for the more than generous offer.  And Rich, I think September is gonna be your turn for the 50."
978448,lew,2016-08-03 16:33:00,12766,"Sorry dan668, we were posting at the same time and your right, the decision was a tough one.  If this is your 1st time at Mashkinonje your gonna love it and if you've been there before you know what I mean.  Regan and Goldie are as good as they come when it comes to running a lodge and customer service.  Have a great trip."
978449,Spiel,2016-08-03 16:45:00,9065,"I remember when you bought it Lew, I think I even seen you smile the first time you hauled her up to Lakair. I never thought I'd see the day you would sell it, but I'm sure you take great comfort in knowing that she's at home and actively plying the waters of the West Arm.  Congratulations to Regan and Goldie, you've got a fine boat that I know was well looked after."
978450,Rich Clemens,2016-08-03 16:55:00,3131,"Ya know Lew. I am in the same boat (well, if you still had one) that you were in.  I only use mine 3 weeks out of a year - 1 week in June and 2 weeks in September.  And all the weeks are up on Nippissing and the French river.   Each trip, I tow it back and forth.  Might be kinda nice someday to not have to worry abut that.   There may come a day here soon when I make the same call.   You know that when we are together, you are more than welcome to share a seat, any time.  That is, if we ever get out of the chairs and actually do some fishing.   LOL  Heck, when we're together in June, you can just take it yourself.  One rule though - nothing larger than 49"", until I get my 50.  LOL."
978453,fish_fishburn,2016-08-03 18:12:00,1311,I went through the same trauma last summer Lew. Had a nice bass boat for 20 yrs and it still looked new. Just wasn't using it anymore and when I did go fishing I usually took the 14 foot tinny. Yhe buyer made it easy for me and gave me my asking price. Told the old gal the only thing I loved more than that boat is bacon.... shes gone too.
978471,misfish,2016-08-03 21:06:00,29133,"I couldnt believe it, when I was told you were selling bud.  If you ever want to use my pontoon Lew, your more then welcome .    Atleast you are at peace with the sale.  Whats next for you? Taking up ice fishing again?"
978482,Big Cliff,2016-08-03 22:38:00,6899,"Oh Lew, I have to say I know the feeling, been going through the same thing myself for the last couple of years now. Gave my portable ice hut to Brian, sold my boat to a neighbor for less than I know I could have gotten for it, gave my son and grand son-in-law about half my fishing rods and tackle. At some point you realize that it just doesn't make sense to keep things sitting around all year, pay insurance on them, store them and maintain them for the amount of times you use them.  It is nice to know that when we pass these things on to others they will be used and appreciated!  Good fishing!"
