978277,Big Cliff,2016-08-01 20:05:00,6899,"It seems like I am always working these days, yard work, work work, moving work, everyday it's the same, get up in the morning start working and crawl into bed when I just can't do any more. (8:00 seems late some nights LOL)  Today I got up and decided that this was going to be a ME day! Cooked a nice breakfast, some nice fluffy cheese omelets.  Found a box of my fishing lure making stuff and decided to make a couple of spinner baits. I walked down to the dock and WHAM a couple of the biggest LM I think I have ever caught!, Not one, not two, but in total five really nice ones and all within about 1/2 an hour.  To top it all off I was getting perch, rock bass, sun fish; almost every cast was another hit. Now I'm planning supper (might be delivery LOL).  This is the way life is supposed to be at 70!  "

978295,ketchenany,2016-08-01 21:53:00,3229,"And you had time to give advice! You are the MAN, Cliff!"
978309,Rizzo,2016-08-02 00:57:00,4754,now THAT is a day!
978317,Carp,2016-08-02 02:28:00,1488,Relaxing by the dock and catching beauty fish too. Very nice Cliff.
978321,wormdunker,2016-08-02 06:18:00,1711,Way to go!  Nice to just say to hell with working around the house & get a few fish.  Tying my own go getters is a relaxing way to spend time.  Then when you get a couple fish on your own creations is awesome!
978334,captpierre,2016-08-02 12:34:00,2521,"Atta boy, Cliff. Won't be able to do that for long."
978341,Spiel,2016-08-02 13:13:00,9065,Sounds like a perfect day.

978354,Big Cliff,2016-08-02 15:03:00,6899,"Seeing as how it was a holiday...you are supposed to take the day off...LOL Beans, after all these years now you tell me! I haven't taken a ME day in so many years, if I'm not working at work I'm working around here or helping friends (which I totally enjoy too)."
978415,manjo39,2016-08-03 12:24:00,354,Nice to read.  'Me days'.  ?
978416,Loonietoon,2016-08-03 12:38:00,1450,Way to go Cliff.... YOU deserve it after all ... you are BIG CLIFF THE MAN
978457,bigugli,2016-08-03 18:33:00,6138,You just have to set a day for yourself every month. Feels so good when you do take the time to unwind.
