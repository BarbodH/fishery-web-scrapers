Is it really that much of a cost? Why not add GPS to all units.  Just curious to know this is all..   "
977929,misfish,2016-07-28 22:23:00,29133,I would of thought there would of been a comment or two.  Would you not want  GPS with your finder and not have to over pay for one with it?  I sure a small chip cant be that much to add as a simple common feature.
977932,John Bacon,2016-07-28 22:43:00,3277,I don't think it would cost too much.  But as long as people are buying the units without GPS they will probably keep making them.
977938,Terry,2016-07-28 23:14:00,14456,and now people have 2 or 3 or more fishfinders on their boats  they don't need gps in each of them I personally like to use one  unit for sonar  and a different one for  gps/mapping..even-though the units I have have both on them
