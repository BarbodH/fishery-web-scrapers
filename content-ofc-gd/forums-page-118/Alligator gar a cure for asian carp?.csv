Biologists are restocking alligator gar in several states where it disappeared about a half-century ago, partly in the hope that it will be a powerful weapon against Asian carp. That invasive species has been swimming almost unchecked toward the Great Lakes for decades. The alligator gar is the largest fish native to Illinois. It is a prehistoric species that has not been seen in the state since the last documented alligator gar catch occurred in the Cache River cutoff channel in southern Illinois in 1966. It was officially declared extinct in Illinois in the 1990s. The IDNR began an alligator gar reintroduction program in 2010, but it has been on hold for the past two years. However, state lawmakers are working on a bill to re-introduce the fearsome fish, with the goal of enlisting it as an ally in the battle against the invasive Asian carp. The larger fish was exterminated from all but the southern part of its range by anglers who mistakenly believed it threatened sportfish. Now states are hoping the monster gar will become a valuable trophy fish."

It may have trouble taking a really big carp, their mouths aren't designed for it, they are also not designed like a shark, where they could bite off pieces. If they help control the population of smaller ones that grow into big ones? Why not?"

If they help control the population of smaller ones that grow into big ones? Why not?  There is another article out there that they indicated there was very little the gar would do to the large ones, but the smaller ones would become food very quickly and it would lessen the numbers of the carp, specifically the bigger ones as there are less little ones to grow.  Myself I would be a fan of this idea, but I also want to make it down to Texas to try and wrangle one of these monsters.  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/huge-once-hated-fish-now-seen-as-weapon-against-asian-carp/"
