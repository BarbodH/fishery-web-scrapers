Of course our wives thought we were crazy but what the heck, they told me that this lake held bass in it and since we don't have bass in our area, i hoped to catch a couple for the fun of it  after a run to the end of the lake and working our way up a creek and over a beaver dam, we got into the lake and it was gorgeous, huge rock outcrops (some of the rock walls were close to 100 feet high) and the water at the base of these was 30 feet deep 5 feet from the shore. it was a great lake with lots of structure, weed beds and rock reefs.
