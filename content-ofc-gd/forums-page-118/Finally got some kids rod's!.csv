The primary provider that was to supply 14 combo's for the kids stopped responding to him and finally said ""sorry it's too late now"".  So he made some calls and some more email's today I was able to go pick up 20 brand new combo's to donate to the camp...  I'm meeting with FloatnFly Sun afternoon so he can get them where they need to be ASAP!  "
978710,cheaptackle,2016-08-06 00:39:00,849,I've known Mike for years Geoff - this ain't the first time he's stepped up to the plate by a long shot.  Many of his sales were held for the benefit of various organizations.  Kudos to him once again and to you as well!  Michael
978712,GBW,2016-08-06 00:45:00,8460,"Mike is one SOLID guy when it comes to helping others!  I've know him for a few years now and see it all the time.  Here is our letter to the camp.  Dear Kinark Child and Family Services  I recently came across a posting on a fishing website with someone looking for old fishing hardware that is still in good condition for the camp kids to use.   Well, we all here at WidowMaker Lures Canada LOVE the idea of having kids get hooked on fishing because it is truly a great part of our heritage and OUR passion here.   When I told the owner we need to help he was on the phones and email right away looking for rod’s and reels for your ‘guests’ as that is not part of our current product line.   Please accept these items as our donation to you for the kids to use and enjoy for many years to come.  Regards, Geoff Warwick Director of sales, marketing and customer relations WidowMaker Lures Canada  Mike Oakley Owner and President of WidowMaker Lures Canada"
