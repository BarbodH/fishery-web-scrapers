978657,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-05 16:09:00,8243,Try a more environment friendly weed killer. Simple and cheaper too. A jug of white vinegar and add a cup of table salt. Use a chemical sprayer and weeds be gone in a day or 2.

Use a chemical sprayer and weeds be gone in a day or 2. Works great OI, gallon of vin 1.39 salt at Wally 77 cents and good to go.  I melt the salt in boiling water. Add some dish soap too. Gallon las a long time for me.  It will kill grass!"
978667,dave524,2016-08-05 17:50:00,4508,"I was still under the impression you could get the good 'ole ""regular"" Roundup at Farm supply shops and the like. Like TSC.  Not true? I believe you can with the proper license, can't even get rat poison without a license Think even CTC has the concentrate is a locked cage here in town."
978729,KLINKER,2016-08-06 02:49:00,256,"The vinegar is an acid that will burn the plant by drawing moisture from it, it might also kill blight spores in the ground as it can contaminate the soil and render the soil lifeless for a few years. The plant will grow back from the roots so you need the salt to contaminate the soil at the root and possibly kill everything for a few years. You need the dish soap for a sticker to hold this environmentally friendly brew to the plant and nobody knows the chemical composition of dish soap so good luck with that crap shoot.  Depending on the % acid of the vinegar you will need some protective clothing and a respirator.  If you are stuck on a desert Island and need a weed killer use the vinegar brew and drink the roundup, less toxic than coffee if you happen to be a rat.."
978731,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-06 03:09:00,8243,"Protective clothing to use vinegar? Come on man. Any qualification here. My Mom is doing fairly well at 85 and I remember gallons of vinegar during canning season.  You can still get Round Up if you have certification that you are a farmer. I still use salt and vinegar on the walkways and driveway. As far as making the ground unable to sustain life tell that to the weeds that grow back. There isn't any lawn in southern Ontario anyway, weeds may be the only green around. Eat them don't kill them."
978760,ketchenany,2016-08-06 12:30:00,3229,I make my own wine vinegar and it's way stronger that the stuff you buy atbthe store. Been using it for years in salads ... Too good to spray on weeds  A respirator! In an old fashioned Calabrese tomato/booconcin/onion/basil salad we dip our crusty bread in the juice.
978762,captpierre,2016-08-06 13:31:00,2521,I use RoundUp all the time at home/cottage to control weeds/ grass. Never pull a weed twice. Don't use on lawn. Kills everything. A plant hormone. Not afraid of it. Hope I don't pay a price ultimately. Legal for farmers to use on Canola  then harvest after 2 wks and sell to humans to eat. I wouldn't want to drink it but careful use is no problem. I hope. ?
978791,KLINKER,2016-08-06 23:06:00,256,"There are vinegar with very strong acid content that you wouldn't want to breath the fumes, and a gram of salt contaminates a liter of water so this would hardly be environmentally friendly buy it's not meant to be if it kills stuff."
978428,darsky,2016-08-03 14:37:00,586,Does anyone know the water/RU Concentrate mix ratio is ?  I think it is 100ml per 1.1L  of water but I cant find the label so i am not sure. Thanks in advance
978430,Raf,2016-08-03 14:48:00,3495,it depends on which concentrate you have.  they have a super concentrate and a regular concentrate.
978432,darsky,2016-08-03 14:59:00,586,regular
978433,Raf,2016-08-03 15:01:00,3495,6oz / gallon
978439,dave524,2016-08-03 15:44:00,4508,"20 to 1 for the regular, that's 50ml. per litre of water if you are on the European system."
978443,darsky,2016-08-03 16:12:00,586,thanks again
978455,fish_fishburn,2016-08-03 18:16:00,1311,That's bad stuff.
978462,Carp,2016-08-03 19:40:00,1488,Only if you're a weed or intoxicated and thirsty!
978465,BillM,2016-08-03 20:03:00,17367,"That's bad stuff.  Only if you buy in the US, stuff we get here is garbage."
978466,dave524,2016-08-03 20:17:00,4508,"This new Weed B Gon is crap compared to Killex, don't waste your money."
978470,KLINKER,2016-08-03 20:54:00,256,"water your weeds good,they should be growing for it to work best.   I could tell you how to mix it but I'd have to put you through the pesticide coarse first and then you would be spraying on my license."
978473,dave524,2016-08-03 21:10:00,4508,"He's in Montreal, think Roundup and Killex are still available for sale for home use there. It was a provincial ban here."
978475,darsky,2016-08-03 21:17:00,586,anything made by MONSANTO cant be 'good '
978480,Joeytier,2016-08-03 22:25:00,3990,Take your tin foil hat off.  It's a pesticide not a super fruit.
978496,beertech,2016-08-04 00:29:00,118,"roundup is not banned in ontario.  It is still registered for noxious weeds,  eg poison ivy wild carrot eg.  And it is the same strength and product as the usa.   Also golf courses landscapers and farmers have never had super versions of the products homeowners used to have.   It was the same stuff.  Just a myth i would like to clear up"
978498,Raf,2016-08-04 01:03:00,3495,"You are correct it is not banned however, a homeowner cannot buy the concentrated versions of roundup in Ontario, only the extremely diluted form.  So no, it is not the same strength as what's available in the states and a few other provinces.  The diluted stuff available is mixed down a lot thinner than 6oz to a gallon. Ie. You are paying for water."
978504,beertech,2016-08-04 01:43:00,118,"you may be right the about concentrated being off the market.  However is is not watered down from the way the concentrated version is suppose to be mixed.  The label is law on concentrated versions . Thats the best part about the pesticide ban ,  homeowners who think products will work better if mixed stronger than label says no longer have that option"
978562,darsky,2016-08-04 18:55:00,586,"Take your tin foil hat off. It's a pesticide not a super fruit.  right,maybe you want to do a bit of homework on Monsanto........"
978566,Raf,2016-08-04 19:55:00,3495,"compare the labels and do the math, you'll find this comment is incorrect as well."
978571,BillM,2016-08-04 20:27:00,17367,"Take your tin foil hat off. It's a pesticide not a super fruit.  Wait, I shouldn't be drinking this stuff?!?!?!??!"

978653,Dara,2016-08-05 15:26:00,3052,I have an old jug of concentrate.  Does it have a shelf life.
978654,Fisherman,2016-08-05 15:39:00,7201,No shelf life that I've ever heard of. Some products have a no freeze warning.
