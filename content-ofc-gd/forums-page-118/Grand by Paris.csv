979050,Szymon,2016-08-10 16:35:00,1,"I've been hitting a few of the Grand River tributaries with a lot of luck the past few weeks. Driving to the rivers I always pass over the Grand on the 403 (south of Paris). I was wondering if anybody knew if it's possible to wade in that portion of the river  (or is it too rapid/deep) and is there any road close to the river where I can park the car because flying over the area on Google maps it looks like the river is flanked on both sides by thick forests or private property....  thanks for a ny help, hopefully this doesn't violate any forum rules..."
