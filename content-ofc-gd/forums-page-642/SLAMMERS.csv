I bought about 10 bags to give them a good try. Ed wasn't around so I am asking you OFNers for some advice. What is the best way to fish them?  I will be using them for smallies on the Ottawa River mostly and on local lakes as well. I'm sure they can be used many different ways but what works best for you. I can hardly wait to get out and give em a go. Thanks in advance for any info. Fish."
495763,Jer,2010-08-18 12:18:00,1426,I usually use them nose-hooked on a drop-shot rig.

495816,uglyfish,2010-08-18 16:01:00,981,drop shot is the best way. but rigging them on a jighead works good too depending on where ur fishing. i like using them on a football head and dragging them in place of a tube sometimes.

496344,Cudz,2010-08-20 03:37:00,2652,yep.  nose hook.  Check out BASS TIMES mag if you have a chance. KVD is nos hooking his drop shot baits slightly different.  Might be worth a try.
496372,Garnet,2010-08-20 11:31:00,2056,I find they work well in water!
496378,fish_fishburn,2010-08-20 11:42:00,1311,"Go away Garnet. Is that first hand knowledge, or did someone tell you that."
496470,Cast Adventures,2010-08-20 15:42:00,74, Rigging tips for the Strike zone slammers that have worked well for me and others in my boat:  - Nose hook or weedless setup with the drop shot  - spilt shot rig  - trailer for a flippin jig ( killer!!)(also try the grand slammer for this app)  - jig head or football head  - 3 way setup for bottom bouncing or dragging  - carolina rig  Good luck!
