We have all had this happen, you get the big monster BAss, Pikeral, musky... whatever right at the boat and the net man, goes to scoop her up and wham, she gets off. Well a few weeks ago while pre fishing, a fish threw a hook at the side of the boat and jumped in the air. The hook was clearly out fo the fishes mouth and I caught the bass  in the air with the net without the hook attached. Is this a legal catch? A nice catch yes...but it makes me wonder."
496586,bassmaster4,2010-08-20 19:36:00,801,same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago i consider it legal because the fish was legally hooked and although it got off you were going to net it anyway
496593,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-20 20:12:00,932,I'd call that one legal.
496594,ehg,2010-08-20 20:13:00,2666,The fish was caught and reeled to boat and net. The net was there already to allow for flukey capture. Quite often fish became unhooked upon netting for me. Maybe in a tournament it would matter.
