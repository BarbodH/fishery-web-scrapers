495894,aplumma,2010-08-18 19:49:00,6896,O.K. Canadadude you win all of the rod builder on the forum are wrong and use only junk to build on. Thanks Cris for all of the rods you have made that have excellent craftmanship but are made with substandard blanks. I wish I had not been hucklebucked out of all of my hard earned money with you laughing all the way to the bank. Time for me to send them to goodwill and go out and buy the superior machine made rods.....  Do you hear how wrong you are yet Canadadude or shall I continue????  Art
495898,fish_fishburn,2010-08-18 20:03:00,1311,I heard Ugly Stick is coming out with a new rod that costs $700.00. Canadadude I have connections and can get u one. You will be the first in North America to use it. How many do you want.
495919,bare foot wader,2010-08-18 20:47:00,1354,"lol....another awesome thread, grown men, stubborn prides/ego/""my opinion is always best"" and way too much time on our hands....reminds me of that time in jr kindergarten when buddy said his gummy bears were better than my teenage mutant ninja turtle gummies....ha  pretty sure buddy didn't attack spiel's workmanship anywhere throughout his posts...did i miss that somewhere?  just because spiel makes great rods(and I'm sure you very well do) doesn't mean that NRX or any other high end rods are crap....sure you can customize all the crap you like, pick some nice pretty looking thread, etc......but IMO, at the end of the day the blank is still the most important part, the technology is mostly in the blank....""mostly"" but not all...I get the fact that a custom rod builder can assure you of his attention to detail, quality craftsmanship, etc.....but I think my SC and Loomis is on par or better than some rod builders who claim their work is great, and a lot of anglers would agree with that  very clear spiel has a loyal following on this forum and well deserved I'm sure....but it sounds to me like spiel is a bit bitter that he can't build on an NRX blank???  i mean if all you can criticize a rod for is some ugly thread...that's only cosmetic and not a biggie in my books  seeing how it's a newly released blank, if the blank does eventually become available to custom builders and spiel builds one up and likes it, it'll be interesting to see how quick all of the followers change their opinions just as quick  didn't the NRX win best in show at icast....to call it a crap rod because of ""ugly"" thread is pretty ridiculous guys....."
495934,Roy,2010-08-18 21:50:00,13728,"In 2007, E21 Fishing won ICAST best of show for the carrot stix rods."
495941,bare foot wader,2010-08-18 22:06:00,1354,the rods that actually won E21 that award at icast never made it to production....shortly after duckett removed himself from the company because the rods he was fishing were not the same rods available to the public  I wouldn't compare E21 to the reputation that Loomis carries...
495951,aplumma,2010-08-18 22:56:00,6896,"  Bare Foot Wader   It is not the rod blank that I question it is the statement that a factory made rod is a better rod than a custom made rod. At no point did I see someone call the NRX blank crap in fact it was said lets see how it holds up and at this point no one does with a new blank. It is not that the thread work is ugly it is done by a machine that does not care if it is was a good job of wet bedding before it is wrapped. It is the fact that for them to make a profit on the rod at $500.oo then their is not time to let solvents dry before you move to the next step. A $500.oo rod minus the overhead and warrentees from breakage that really was not from material defects and the ""free"" custom cover all leaves you with a $150.oo to $200.00 price for the blank. When the blank is released if it is the best blank for the situation then sure Chris will be building one for me the point is the blank is not such a quantum leap in the material world that makes custom rods a thing of the past. A custom rod is more than pretty thread it is the attention to detail and job specific that is the reason to have a custom rod created.  I am by far an elitist in my equipment if you look at my Catfishing rigs you will find they are fiberglass composite rods (old school)with Tica reels because a 30-50 lb fish that you are dead baiting needs very little sensitivity but need a long shoulder to handle the monsters from the deep.My reply's are not to argue about the quality of Chris's work I already know his talent I have seen his shop and fished the end results he no longer has to sell me I am a follower of talent.  I hope that Loomis makes lots of sales on the rod but if you are in the market to drop that much money you are at a point were you can afford a custom rod that is built for YOU and not a fits all solution. So ask yourself what looks/fits better an off the rack suit or one that is tailored to fit you? Which one do you buy if they are comparably priced? In closing if we were talking gummi bears to gummi worms (Same material different shape) then your analogy would be correct but we are actually talking about craftsmanship versus machine made. We are comparing a profit driven company to pride in workmanship their is no comparison not just in rods but all aspects in life.  Art"
495960,Duckie,2010-08-18 23:10:00,305,"the blanks will likely never be available:  http://tackletog.com/cal/2009/04/23/its-official-loomis-to-exit-the-blank-business/  Loomis no longer makes blanks available to rod builders.  once they are gone, they are gone."
496005,mbac31,2010-08-19 02:03:00,904,"Loomis does not offer any more blanks. Everyone will tell you their rods are better then others without any proof. Granted these new NRX rods are yet to be fully tested by the public but keep in mind that Loomis field tests rods for a while with a ton of research. Still hand made US blanks. Complete seperate entinity from Shimano. I have a ton of Custom rods that I have had done from Shakedown rods, George Roth and Matt from Matt Lures. Not to mention a couple of custom builds I have done my self. Custom built rods are awesome with that something feel about them but what happens when they break. You get screwed and you are out of a rod. That $400 rod now becomes a Tomato plant prop. Reason why I went to higher end rods. I wanted that custom feel with a full warranty. When a custom breaks the builder may warranty the blank but not the work they have to do to it again. I'm not wrong there.  I have 123 rods in my collection right now and have used just about every one from JDM or USDM and have found Loomis to be the only one with a true science behind the blank. And yes they are all G Loomis rods. Do I need the latest and greatest rods, Maybe not but I'm in a position where I firmly beleive thet the latest in the technology helps in certian situations in the feel of some bites.  St Croix and Shimano make amazing rods as well. I have become acustomed to Loomis and dont use anything else. Am I saying go out and buy one. No, Im stating actuall facts on all their rods. I still have 11 blanks from Loomis when they were being sold off thT I will build myself over the next couple of years. Everyone claims that they have developed the blanks from some new science. Lets face it. Most are a marketing scheme. Every year, just like Roy stated there will be a new and better rod. Thats just a fact of life. Do I love my new NRX and My GLX rods. Dam right I do and that wont change at all. The new NRX ugly blue as some stated will grow on most. I think they look awesome and adds a custom type look to the blank. This new price hike is good and sorry but if a rod does not break in the first year of use then its not manufactuer fault. Its about time companies stop and clarify the Warranty issues. Limited lifetime is simply what it states.  Thats why I like rod covers fr high end or even low end rods. Anyone here can attest to the shape of all my rods when I sell them. Handle protectors, rod Gloves etc. After all you would not ride a bike without a helmet.    I protect my investment always no matter what. To hard to make the money so I would rather not go through the hassle of trying to get a new one.  JUst to put my money where my mouth is. I will invite anyone out from the board when I get free time from Tourney fishing and show you why I think the G Loomis rods are what they are. I will have free time in mid fall so anyone who wants and is willing I will show you why. I can place the GL2-GL3,Mossy back, GLX and the NRX rods of the same model and you be the judge."
496010,Duckie,2010-08-19 02:14:00,305,"I have several Loomis rods and I have to admit, they are my favorite. I own a few IMX's, and a few GL3's. I do prefer them to my St. Croix Avid, but it is still a great rod and arguably more bang for you buck. the Loomis GL3's/IMX handle/cast better but they are $100 more.  what I really like about Loomis is their tapers. The SJR782 is the best best spinning rod I have ever used. I prefer the GL3 version because I much prefer the handle style over the IMX version (which I also own).  and some of their tapers are quite unique. for instance, there is no comparable St. Croix taper to the SJR700 GL3 Mag Light ex-fast spinning rod. it has a very light tip but a strong butt section. its like a hybrid rod -bottom half is a jig rod with some power, top half is like an UL rod. its such a cool little rod.  I can't wait to see what future tapers are available with the NRX graphite. even though they are pricey, maybe one day I will have to own one.."
496060,aplumma,2010-08-19 11:35:00,6896,  Well said and a very nice offer on your part. I hope that Loomis sells lots of rods to people who do not chose the custom route no matter how you get their a quality rod enhances the fishing experience.  Art

496248,canadadude,2010-08-19 21:38:00,769,If anyone is interested in having a custom Loomis rod built check out North Fork Customs blanks this  is Gary and his son's new company and they sell blanks that are very comparible to loomis actions.There not cheap but the quality expected from a Gary Loomis blank I'm sure will be there.
495394,John,2010-08-17 15:11:00,2956," With all due respect, what is the science that is behind ""the best blank in the world""? It is still a mass produced rod, built as a one size fits all solution....it's a $500+ shimano bass rod guys.  I'll take my chances with ""last years"" blank and a custom build."
495397,aplumma,2010-08-17 15:13:00,6896,"I have spent a lot of money on commercially made rods over the years and 5 years ago i decided to have a rod custom built by Spiel. Fast forward to today I still have all 4 rods and if you are a really good friend fishing with me I might let you use one of them. I have yet to have someone feel that any of the commercial rods felt as good as the ones built because they are built with not only the reel weight, fishermans hands,type of use all in mind from the get go. I went to a 1 1/2 inch cork diameter tapered, with titanium reels and he was still able to balance the rig. The money you spend after $350.00 because you have it you might as well go custom and get exactly what you want and what feels natural.  All of the talk about lifetime warrentees lately brings up a point that if a rod is defective then it will break in a few uses if you use it longer and it breaks it is due to your abuse of the rod. The factories take into account that they will have to eat a few rods in the lifetime warrentee area and over price the rods accordingly. With the custom rods if it breaks then a good  builder will be happy to replace the blank with a small charge for building it new. If you then take care of it and don't do stupid things with it then you will never have a warrentee issue. Rods do not chemically change it takes an outside influence to cause them to change state (from unbroken to broken). So if you look in my rod locker you will find the older big name rods but the ones that will catch your eyes are the ones that have a single word written on them it says SPIEL.  Thanks for all of the craftsmanship you have instilled in past and the future rods Chris.   Art"
495400,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 15:18:00,154,Spiel makes customs? If so I'll make sure to keep that in the back of my head. Maybe I'll treat myself after I pay of my KHS DJ50  
495402,John,2010-08-17 15:23:00,2956, You one of them stumpjumper dudes Tommy?
495405,Roy,2010-08-17 15:26:00,13728,What Aplumma (Art) said. They're the best rods I own. I won't buy anything else.
495406,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 15:26:00,154," I like big jumps and tricks but I'm not the ass on the trail everyone hates, I mostly ride in the city or XC with my specialized epic."
495409,Spiel,2010-08-17 15:41:00,9065,"To be clear I'm not saying the NRX's are not good rods (blanks), I've never used one.  The best rods I own are Loomis (pre Shimano days), but I'll be honest there are other blanks out there for less money that are perhaps easier on the wallet and I do have some. And lets face it, most any rod out there today built today by a reputable known company is definitely better than anything your father used, hell likely better than anything you used a few decades ago.  What often separates factory rods from custom is the quality of assembly and attention to detail. I have had many, very many well known rod manufacturers rods come through my door for repairs that would have been unnecessary if they had been built properly from the get go.  Another problem with many well known high end rods is that to shave costs while maximizing profits they're frequently under guided.  As I said in another thread on NRX a while back, if Shimano isn't going to offer the custom/home rod builder any blanks it's likely I'll never own one. And I got be honest here, the colour of the guide wraps on the one's I've seen were just brutal. What the hell were they thinking."
495430,canadadude,2010-08-17 16:10:00,769,"Loomis has been owned by Shimano for 15yrs and Gary was still running the company for 11 of those, it's only recently he left. I have a few old IM6 loomis rods which are nice but the newer Loomis rods I've purchased are every bit as good,Loomis rods are still built in the same factory with the same attention to detail as they always have been. To say Loomis rods were better pre Shimano days is just a wives tale,in fact there probably the industry leader in advancment in Blank design and product design. To say a Loomis rod is just a Shimano with a Loomis sticker is very far from the truth,it is today as it always has been,  the finest factory rod on the market."
495432,Spiel,2010-08-17 16:12:00,9065,"   If Gary's not over seeing the production than it's a Shimano product, no?  "
495433,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 16:14:00,154,  I suppose so
495445,canadadude,2010-08-17 16:37:00,769,"Of course not, thats like saying when Mercedes Benz bought Chrysler, that Chryslers were now Mercedes Benz or worse Mercedes were now Chrylers.Loomis may be owned by Shimano, but it's still a seperate company,and I'm sure after Gary left there was a competent replacment the quality of the product hasn't suffered.  If you or anyone else wants a Gary Loomis blank check out Northfork Composites, thats his new company,hold on to your jaw when you look at the prices of his high end blanks"
495453,Steve,2010-08-17 16:52:00,2075,"Read through this thread.  Lots of opinions with very few folks who have used them.  I, like Bdox, have used mine. I was fortunate enough to be the first person to 'buy' a NRX in Ontario.  Further, I was fortunate enough to fish with Bdox Sunday morning. I was using my NRX 7'5"" Medium Heavy while Brian was using his NRX 7'1"" Medium Heavy.  I'll be honest, my best rods has been GL3's or St Criox Legend Elite's. So yes, good, but not top of the line. (never even held a GLX)  The NRX is SO MUCH BETTER than the two above mentioned rods.  I paired it with a Curado E7 and even though it's a flippin stick (for up to 3/4 ounce baits), its the lightest rod I own. Not to mention - BY FAR - the most sensitive rod I own.  Problem now is, what do I do with the 7 or 8 other bass rods I own? cause each time i put the NRX down, and picked up another (whether it be Crucial, Loomis, St Criox), they felt heavier and ""muddier"" than my NRX. Can't replace them all ... but to say they are not worth it ... well, i guess that depends on how much you fish ... by days end i was changing baits on the NRX, rather than switching up rods ...  The price is a tough pill to swallow, but like I said to my buddy George, take two of your rod/reel combo's, and sell them. That'll get you to just about the cost of a NEW NRX.  Also, their ""wild card"" warranty is an interesting way of doing warranties. I wish they offered it on other rods, as both loomis and st criox are sure NOT known for their warranties...so I guess it's an improvement for the better.  I guess to close, I've USED the NRX, and I LOVE IT!"
495477,John,2010-08-17 17:39:00,2956," I might have picked a different comparable. When Daimler Benz took over Chrysler it took less than 18 months for the incest to start. There were more Chry-cedes and Merc-slers than most realize. Similarly when Gary left, the products were designed and built by Shimano. He had no control over the destiny of the Loomis product.  It will be interesting to see how many are actually bought with real money compared to how many are ""bought"" by the pro's."
495503,Marko,2010-08-17 18:28:00,854,"I thought we were in recesion haha.Dropping that kind of cash on a rod is crazy, for me anyways.Then again like mentioned above to each his own. For that kind of coin it better lead you to where the fish are."
495505,2kj,2010-08-17 18:36:00,77,"Tried that one on my wife already, she didn't buy it the first time! lol"
495542,fish_fishburn,2010-08-17 19:49:00,1311,"I went to Paddletails this morning and stocked up on Slammers and other things.  Man I love that store. I looked at the new Loomis twigs and the first thing I was turned off by was the colour of the guide wraps.  There plain ugly. They are super light though and feel really nice. I walked out without buying one even if it came with a really cool looking jacket worth about 150.00. That promo is on till the 20th of August I believe.  I am going to start making my own rods this winter so the 5 bones I held onto will go towards most of my equipment to get started building my own. Seriously 500 bucks for a off the rack rod is out of my price range. But I would spend that on a custom build thats made exactly for me and the way I want it to feel. And the beautiful guide wraps that come with it, make it a piece of art. They are no doubt great rods but time will be the best judge for that."
495553,aplumma,2010-08-17 20:43:00,6896," well said you can P.M. a few of the rod builders on the board and they will be happy to help you get started and answer questions as they come up.   I own Shimano, Loomis,St Croix and custom rods. None of the name brands compare to the custom made rods. The customs were made with a specific reel and a specific fisherman in mind. They were designed for the lure weight and style of fishing I do. The blanks are cutting edge and purchased from top name makers. The grips are hand formed for what fits me and the reel seats are wet bonded to the rod blanks for maximum feel. Some of the rods have 9 rings for a 7 foot blank The rings can be of any quality you want but the key is that they are spaced and mounted on the spline correctly.The rings are wet bedded and then hand wrapped into place with 3-5 coats of clear sealing the rods. Time from start to finish is up to 12 hours for a 7 foot rod and the mid 20's for a 13ft rod. If you go for the intricate thread work then the sky's the limit on time.I know from experiance that none of my company made machine wrapped rods come close to the attention that is put into the customs. A custom is not for everyone and it is a lot of money for a good one but to some like me it is worth it.  Art"
495560,canadadude,2010-08-17 21:15:00,769,If your looking for a high end custom be prepared to pay $350-$400 just for the blank.
495584,aplumma,2010-08-17 22:32:00,6896," Some of the rods I have seen are over $1,500.oo if you want to spend that much. I prefer to keep it to a more common price like $200.oo for the blank and build from their. The first custom I got was built on a $100.oo blank and with the other components matched to ME and the REEL no one has identified it as the less expensive of the 4 he has built. If you get a custom rod built it only has to make you happy and it only has to cost as much as you want to spend to build it. A $400.oo blank that is not crafted into a great end product is just a high priced stick.  When you buy any rod you need to feel like it is an extension of your arm it needs to be balanced in your hand. It needs to be light enough to use all day but have the ass to fight the fish in an ethical way for releasing after a short battle. The rod should load easily for long casts with accuracy for difficult placement. The reel is also a major expense costing sometimes as much or more than the rod. If you do decide to go down the road of custom equipment be prepared to find yourself slowly abandoning the other rods and reels you own.You will find yourself putting your favorite lure on the customs and even cutting off the lures and retying just so you can use the perfect combo longer. If you do find yourself able to go down this road be generous and pass down your combos you don't use to someone who will appreciate them I have give a few to younger fishermen who have cherished them and continued fishing and honoring the only promise I ask of them. That is to treat it well and pass it on to someone when you upgrade to a newer combo.  Art"
495594,fish_fishburn,2010-08-17 23:12:00,1311,Canadadude if your talking a Sage flyrod or pin rod your correct but there are some awesome bass blanks out there that are totally awesome and nowhere near that price. The Rainshadow RX8 bass blanks for example. It all comes down to how all the components are assembled that makes a good rod. You can have the best blank in the world but if its not put together properly all you have basically is a meat stick.
495622,Fish Farmer,2010-08-18 00:24:00,2234,"Spiel made me a ultra light 1 pc custom rod out of a Rainshadow blank 2-4 LB test. I caught a 40"" muskie on it this summer with about 40' of 6 LB test and 4LB backing on a ultra light reel. Rod performed out standing. As for that NRX rod, I laughed at the winding job, Chris (Spiel) you don't have to worry, NRX can't hold to your winding job,. I just came back from the tackle store. Out of all the rods I looked at in hand, Shimano Loomis,NRX, and St.Croix. St Croix would be my pick for a factory assembled rod and nicer finish. Give me one of yours any day Chris."
495634,Duckie,2010-08-18 00:46:00,305,"not sure why people are saying these are just a shimano product with a Loomis name on them.  shimano has owned Loomis since 1997. 13 years so far.  and I think some people think they just bought them yesterday..maybe because they just heard??  the thing is, Loomis branded rods and shimano branded rods are completely different and might always be.  no shimano branded rod is anything like a Loomis rod and vice versa.  shimano rods are made in china. Loomis rods are made in washington in the USA.  these new rods are no doubt no exception.  personally, I have not been a fan of any shimano branded rods relative to  Loomis and St. Croix rods. they are just not as good IMO.  for the best of the best, I think SC and Loomis are still tops and they are still made in north america which is good in terms of quality control.  shimano rods are not."

495802,canadadude,2010-08-18 14:44:00,769,"Rainshadow, Lamiglass and others at best may compare to a Loomis GL2 blank.I tried a couple Rainshadow customs last fall/winter bottom bouncing Steelhead and was not impressed, they were nowhere near as nice as my Loomis.The Blank IMO is the most important component of any rod, you can build a rod with high end guides, custom reel seat, fancy wraps ect, but if it's built on sloppy blank it will be a sloppy rod.I've built 10 rods over the years and it really isn't that difficult unless you get really fancy with the wind which is just cosmetic.Splining the blank, figuring out guide spacing, building the reel seat and winding is not very hard to do although it takes time.Anyway my next project I think will be a North Fork 9'8"" steelhead blank for bottom bouncing the Niagara, just gotta come up with some serious $$$$$$$ and find a distributer to get it to Canada"

495309,scugpg,2010-08-17 10:30:00,1373,What is the warranty like with Loomis? Pricey but sounds like they are worth checking out for fun.
495316,mercman,2010-08-17 11:06:00,7054,"  check out his site for the phone number and give him a call http://www.paddletales.com/  he is very competitive in prices, cheaper than sail/baron, and ships anywhere."
495322,Fish Farmer,2010-08-17 11:39:00,2234,I wonder how the tip would work as a ice fishing rod  I know that would happen if I bought one. The guy who stepped on it better have his life jacket on or my ceiling fan would be on the floor with a size 12 on top. Just some morning humor boys.
495329,bdox,2010-08-17 12:09:00,329,"Guilty! I missed the Friday night launch due to a day trip to quinte, but I was in fishing world first thing Saturday morning picking up a 853c. I can pretty much echo everything Marvin said!"
495330,mbac31,2010-08-17 12:10:00,904,"Just for a test I placed the rod tip on my wifes throat and asked her to say something. You feel every vibration through the blank. I can tell you that every pebble, blade of grass or whatevers on the bottom you can tell what it is after just one day of use. The warranty is lifetime and you will get a wildcard mailed to you just in case you braek it you dont have to pay the expiditer service like others and I beleive you have to bring it into the store that sells them. If a rod is going to break it will do so the first few times out no matter what. THey even come with their own G Loomis cover. Finally a rod company thinking about the after sale. I will take a couple of pics of them in action this weekend and post them. Fishingworld has a full line right now but are selling fast. Some have been put on order they sold so fast."
495332,bdox,2010-08-17 12:13:00,329,"With the NRX you get this ""wild card"" thig, which entitles you to one over the counter, no questions asked replacement, along side the lifetime warranty from manufacturers defects."
495336,Cudz,2010-08-17 12:21:00,2652,How would this rod compare to an ugly stik?  Which would be more sensitive?  Which would be lighter?  At $47.50 these rods look pretty good.  I will have to do a side by side by side comparison with the ugly stik the volteus and the nrx.  The nrx is probably not as strong.  I will try to touch the tip of the rod to the handle of the nrx when I go to the store (that is a good test of strength. You can do it with the ugly stik).
495337,Spiel,2010-08-17 12:22:00,9065, That'll also work with a steel bar or a piece of hardwood dowel.
495338,mbac31,2010-08-17 12:24:00,904, LMAO!!!!!!! I can imagine my wifes face. She gave me a weird look when I ask if I could place my rod on her neck.
495339,Spiel,2010-08-17 12:27:00,9065,  That ole trick is in know way a means by which to test the sensitivity of a fishing rod as it'll work with just about any solid object. That's all I was trying to convey. 
495357,John,2010-08-17 13:35:00,2956,"I guess I'm missing something here. As an old school oldtimer, I fail to comprehend $500+ for a commercially made bass rod. I think that I will put my next investment of that magnitude into something more ""custom""...."
495364,I'mHooked,2010-08-17 14:07:00,525,"Was at the Fishing World ""debut"" on Friday night.  Nice rods. Played with drop shot demo. They were giving away $150 fitted G'Loomis jackets with purchase of rod.  One guy who was there with his girlfriend asked if they were giving a jacket for each rod purchased. They said yes, so he passed his girlfriend a rod and said ""here's one for you."" Kinda like, she wouldn't have gotten a rod if there wasn't a jacket He actually walked out with 3 rods.  Any how, was nice to chat with Bob & Darren Izumi and get pictures with my son. Mark Kulik was there as well. They had some food & drinks, and a sale on all bass gear.  Picked up some X-raps for the first time."
495370,bdox,2010-08-17 14:16:00,329," What's the point of a custom rod if you can't utilize the best blank in the world? The tapers and actions are customized for technique specific uses, add on the hybrid guide system, custom reel seat and no 'custom' rod will come close to a NRX."
495372,Spiel,2010-08-17 14:24:00,9065, Whether they are the best or not is yet to be determined. IMHO At any rate these are a Shimano product with the Loomis name slapped on them. I would also suspect the mark up on these over production cost to be considerable.   
495377,bdox,2010-08-17 14:36:00,329," The jacket was a nice touch, definately made the purchase easier to swallow. And are you saying you had one in your hands and didn't walk out of the store with it? Crazy talk!   I guess one day on the water isn't enough to say it's the best blank in the world, but I can tell you it is the most sensitive rod I had ever used. And I have some pretty nice rods to compare it to."
495381,Bondar,2010-08-17 14:43:00,817,"Some people get it,  some people dont !  and did someone compare an ugly stick to a loomis  I'll be getting a NRX for drop shotting and i'm sure a few more to add to my loomis collection"
495387,mercman,2010-08-17 14:59:00,7054,  47.50 ???? TRY 10 TIMES THAT.
495390,kickingfrog,2010-08-17 15:01:00,8333,"We ALL have our price points. Some fish out of boats that are not designed specificity for fishing (oh the horror). I have caught fish on hand lines, a bamboo pole with string, cheap rods and some very expensive equipment. The price of the equipment did not impact my enjoyment of angling. It's just fishing whatever your budget."
495391,Harrison,2010-08-17 15:03:00,2202," Hey Spiel, I still have 2 of the originals(from way back in the day).  One needs some love, can I talk to you about this over the winter?  I was with Loomis for a few years when I fished T's and guided.  Was a great company to work with.  Looking forward to checking out these new sticks."
495393,kickingfrog,2010-08-17 15:10:00,8333,"  I believe his tung was firmly planked in his cheek.  As you said some people get it... some do not.  The rods can be compered, maybe not favourably, but a comparison can be made.  Two anglers of equal skill fishing side by side. Does the angler with a rod 10x more expensive catch 10x more fish?"
