Didn't have much luck other than some small minnows and a baby smb, does any one know what's the best fly to use right now?  i just used som random ones i picked up at a local fly shop. And also, i've been looking for a fly tying kit with the vise and everything, but they are kinda expensive, does anyone know where i could get a set for a good deal? Thanks =]"
496647,Spiel,2010-08-21 00:10:00,9065,It's not local to you but they will ship and have an assortment of kits available at reasonable prices..  http://johnsflymaterials.webs.com/flytyingkits.htm  I've tried to order fly tying materials from the States but unfortunately any sources I've tried won't ship to Canada.
496653,fishinguypat,2010-08-21 00:51:00,547,you can get away with a cheap vice for under 10 bucks i hear... but i'm not sure
496659,vinnimon,2010-08-21 01:12:00,2593,"  As what speil has posted,those are decent prices. I started out the same,and upgraded on the vice almost a week later. A great hobby,I wish I had the time,havent tied a fly in over ten years. As for material,check out the bargain bins in any tackle shop.You never know whats in there!"

Really easy and cheap to tie. In fact, I get most of my materials from the dollar store.  My first vice was a pair of needle nose vice-grips."
496682,Swan_Dive,2010-08-21 02:46:00,46,"My wife bought me a tying kit by Orvis.  She found it on Cabelas website but then searched amazon and found it for less.  I don't know much about tying but have tied 3 so far and it seems okay, it has the materials for 8 different flies, all the tools, vise and a book that explains everything and step by step instruction for each fly.  I would look into the local places first though and see if you could get the same thing from them for around the same price.  Even if you have to pay a little more it would be better to buy locally but you can always start with a kit and buy all your future tools and materials locally."
496688,timmeh,2010-08-21 03:30:00,609," Awesome, so was mine. I used to duct tape them closed and then tape them to the table and tie away. Actually worked pretty well. And starting with buggers is a good idea. Really easy to tie and can catch just about anything.  But for your question, most fishing shops will have beginners kits from $50 to $100. They will come with a vise, the common tools, and a good start of tying material. But a word of advice; don't go for the  absolute cheapest vice you can find. I did that for my first real vice and I locked a hook in it and started tying, took a break and left the hook in the vice for 15min or so and one of the arms of the vice was broken off when I came back. So I ended up spending more $ on a second vice (which was $50 and has been great). I got that one in a kit from basspro for about $80 with all the other stuff included."
496695,Zubris21,2010-08-21 04:09:00,563,"I also have recently gotten into the tying craze... I just bought the cheap starter kit from Walmart.  It's ok, has everything you need to get started.  I've been awol from this site for quite a while, but maybe I'll post some pictures of the flies I've done.  Good luck with the new hobby!"
