You can select multiple dates, so pick each one that works for you.  It is being held at Deer Creek Conservation Area near Long Point and Simcoe    I am trying to work on finding some rental boats or canoes if anyone is interested. This place has some MONSTER bass!  I will add more information a little later if anyone is interested please let Ryan or I know. I have a copy of the pledge form so if you want to get started collecting some pledges PM me and I will email it to you.  I hope to see a lot of you out there.  If you just want to make a pledge or donate a prize, let me know.  and remember last year we raised $3170.00 I hope to see over $5000.00 this year     Facebook group created 2010 FISH-A-THON  Original post http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=45777  Dan"

495176,danbouck,2010-08-16 22:18:00,4380," Perfect, look forward to meeting you if you can make it"
495207,splashhopper,2010-08-16 23:20:00,2931,September dates sound like a great idea
495232,Marko,2010-08-17 00:41:00,854,One of the September dates would probably work for me
495237,danbouck,2010-08-17 00:44:00,4380, Click all the ones that would work  BTW - Some BIG carp in there
495250,HTHM,2010-08-17 01:20:00,4082,So......we might re-schedule????
495251,danbouck,2010-08-17 01:22:00,4380, Looks like I may be available earlier or the same date as of right now.
495254,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-17 01:37:00,2050,Hey guys the tentative date is the 28th unless there isn't enough interest.... We will decide in the next day or two... Just feeling out the general consensus as I had a few guys who wanted to come from last year that couldn't do the 28th...
495269,Dutchy,2010-08-17 02:27:00,416,Sep 18th would be the only date that would work for me
495271,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 02:30:00,2690,"Hey, Dan and Ryan...one of the September days (voted the 11th) is probably better for me as well, now."
495274,Bassaholic,2010-08-17 02:55:00,74,"The 28th is about all that will work for me. Between weddings, buck and does, and early season honkers September weekends are already booked up."
495525,danbouck,2010-08-17 19:05:00,4380,"Knock Out Lures as well as OFC has donated some prizes, thanks a lot guys!!!"
495528,TC1OZ,2010-08-17 19:12:00,987,"Already doing a charity golf tournament for work on the 28th! I hope the September 18th date gets selected as I can make that one for sure.  If that is the date, I'll be PM'ing you about a boat dan!"
495942,danbouck,2010-08-18 22:14:00,4380,Another amazing donation from Fishhunter (Lloyd) from U & Me Guide Service who is donating a 4 hour evening charter for 4 people good in the month of June 2011 with a value of $350  Lloyd Daume U & Me Guide Service http://www.stevemorissette.com/uandme/index.html  
495968,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-19 00:09:00,2690," Awesome gesture from a class guy!!  How close are we to confirming a specific date?  Even if it ends up being the 28th, Juli and myself are going to do our best to participate."
495970,danbouck,2010-08-19 00:11:00,4380, It will be decided in the next couple days. We'll keep you posted
495981,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-19 00:53:00,2690,"Sounds good Dan...we are leaving for Restoule, Saturday morning, so hopefully all is decided by then!  Great thing that Ryan and yourself are putting together here."
496141,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-19 16:23:00,2690,Ryan and Dan...would it be possible to convince the LPCA to open the gates for this special event after Labour Day?
496180,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-19 18:24:00,2050,"Hi Frankie I'm on the road until late tonight... I'll make some calls in the morning and figure it all out.  Cheers, Ryan"

496578,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-20 19:19:00,1107,Thanks Ryan I still had 1 saved from last year.I may have a source for rental canoes and kayaks at a discounted price I would need to know for sure how many guy/gals need a boat  in the next few days because he has a big group going out labour day and needs to know how many boats he would need for the sat as he would have to get them all cleaned and ready to go for the monday for his big group .
