We're getting fish, but they're not coming easy.  Largies have been tougher than usual and they are sitting deeper than I usually fish for them.  When you get on them, they are schooled up good though. Smallies have been feeding pretty good lately, again in the deeper range, 15-25 feet even in the smaller lakes.  On Sunday I volunteered my time and boat for the Junior Bassmasters tournament for the 3rd time this season.  I really enjoy getting out their and seeing the knowledge base of some of these kids.  This tournament in particular, I was really impressed by their knowledge and ability to make the appropriate observations and adjustments to put fish in the boat!            "

496137,Harrison,2010-08-19 16:00:00,2202,"I wasn't going to open this up Steve.  My jealousy was peaking with the last Simcoe smallie smash you posted.  Man I miss mid week on Simcoe, especially while I'm stuck here in the concrete jungle.  Anyways, great report and the smile on the kids faces says everything!"
496148,LucG,2010-08-19 17:03:00,779,Nice fish! Thats a big smallie in the last one!
496151,Cudz,2010-08-19 17:09:00,2652,"Very cool. Hey Steve, I was out yesterday morning for the first time in eons and I was drop shotting a fair bit and was constantly getting bit by gobbies.  WTH?  Snce when have there been so many in Simcoe?  I could not believe it.  On the NW side as well."
