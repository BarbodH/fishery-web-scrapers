496423,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-20 13:47:00,2690,"Quick question.  Would this inverter have enough ""oomph"" to power the air pump in an inflatable queen size bed?  Thanks, in advance!"
496427,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-20 13:56:00,0,Seen that at Canadian tire on special for 79.99. The sale ended yesterday. Has a USB port and everything but doesn't specify on cranking amps so went with the eliminator.
496435,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-20 14:12:00,0,"You can pick up some refurbished for $30.00 at X-cargo, tech source, ect. But doubt they will last very long. Some really good deals at Canadian Tire this week for sure."
496439,chessy,2010-08-20 14:22:00,610,can tire has em on sale for 19 99 this week sale starts friday ... 300 watt will run small tv and satilite
496441,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-20 14:27:00,2690,"Yup, that's the one I'm looking at.  Just need it to blow up the bed (double high mattress), but, could come in handy once in awhile for other uses."
496479,ketchenany,2010-08-20 15:51:00,3229," Johnnybass, be careful with the Eliminator! I bought one (300) a few years back and when I went to use it had died (won't charge). I was told that those units have to be kept plugged in!!!!! Brand new and still in the box!"
496481,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-20 15:54:00,2690,I grabbed one a few minutes ago...should be adequate for my needs.
496493,jedimaster,2010-08-20 16:20:00,3472,The source has the 400Watt one with the voltage display on sale as well for 39.99 http://www.thesource.ca/estore/product.aspx?language=en-CA&catalog=Online&category=Inverters&product=2218173
496494,Terry,2010-08-20 16:25:00,14456,well 300 watts at 120 volts is 2.5 amps..so..look at how many amps the pump is I wouldn't go over 80% of what the inverter says it can do
496496,ckrb2007,2010-08-20 16:30:00,449,"Why not just go with the typical cigarette lighter pump? I have one and it works great. If you do have your mind set on the inverter, a 300W will suffice. My FJ Cruiser has a built in 400W and is ok. I'm actually thinking of upgrading to a 2500W inverter with a dual battery set-up for my back lake camping trips. Nothing like being able to power a microwave, toaster, coffee maker..etc back in the bush. Man, talk about roughin' it eh!! LOL"
496549,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-20 17:52:00,10439, 2500 Watts is overkill for that unless you want to run them all at once. 1500 is fine. I have a 1750 and can even run my table saw off it. I have a 1300 generator that will run my small microwave or my espersso machine in my trailer.
496555,jedimaster,2010-08-20 18:03:00,3472,  Isn't that like saying 1 fishing rod is enough?
496609,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-20 20:54:00,10439, Not when you consider power usage. The more power they are able to deliver the more power they use. But even at idle (with no load) the higher the wattage they can deliver the more power they use. For instance a 2500 watt inverter will use quite a bit more power with no load than a 1500 watt model will. So unless you want to run out of battery power before the end of your camping trip I would go with the smallest inverter you can get away with.  Something to think about.
496638,Raf,2010-08-20 23:15:00,3495,this one requires a 0w inverter  
496640,SudburyAngler,2010-08-20 23:19:00,154,
496646,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-21 00:07:00,2690, LOL....the only reason I asked was the bed has a built in air pump + I figured I could use an inverter anyways.
496660,Raf,2010-08-21 01:16:00,3495,i'm surprised it doesn't run off D or C cells?
496669,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-21 01:31:00,2690,"Nope...double high queen size inflatable bed with built in pump, runs off an electric outlet...can also be pumped up manually, but, will take alot longer."
