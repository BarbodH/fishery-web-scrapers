495568,Roy,2010-08-17 21:34:00,13728," Man, if I had a nickel for every time I've heard that line used on Joey to get her address."
495580,aplumma,2010-08-17 22:09:00,6896,  Sure hope it works if I get it I can get on my bicycle and ride over for a hug.   Art
495582,Roy,2010-08-17 22:14:00,13728, HA! A bicycle you say? I'd crawl on my hands and knees through broken glass for a Joey hug!
495585,aplumma,2010-08-17 22:35:00,6896,O yea well then I will ride the bicycle with 2 flats and no seat for a joey hug. Beat that Mr. Roy
495596,Handlebarz,2010-08-17 23:23:00,3790,Nice Joey but I dont know is he really that happy or trying to hold something else when some smart arse told him now is a great time to take a pic  Joey does make a great bait and it sure is a great feeling to have pics of fish with your lure I know some who have them I think i will be getting a couple this fall. I hope you bring some here this fall to get out trolling with I here these things work behind the boat at 5mph October sounds like a good time to try them here.
495608,Joey,2010-08-17 23:52:00,9122," Ouch!!  But that I'd like to see    Thanks Mike, and yes I'll bring some down.  October sounds good to me.  November is always too cold.  Now if you could put in a good word with the weatherman this time - no wind please!!!"
495650,HTHM,2010-08-18 01:27:00,4082,I would live my life well enough to DESERVE a Joey hug. BEAT YA ALL!
495740,spincast,2010-08-18 09:11:00,3279,"I don;t know if thats a smile Joey - I think I had the same expression when I had the  treble stuck in my finger  - But seriously - nice looking spinnerbait - and fish!.Looks like you just increased your sales a bunch - even if it is mail order only, much to Roy's dissappointment"
495774,bigbuck,2010-08-18 13:29:00,2449,"Great looking baits Joey, and they catch fish too!!!! You should think about selling them, put an ad in the Classifieds here. Seriously!"
496062,aplumma,2010-08-19 11:38:00,6896,  Good news everyone she is going to let me mail it to her instead.   Art
496140,Tarzan's Jane,2010-08-19 16:11:00,1183, I knew you were all talk
495375,Joey,2010-08-17 14:29:00,9122,"So, while we were at Lakair this July, we ran into a fellow we frequently see there named Rod, from Virginia.  He and Paul chat it up pretty good most days and Rod had commented on one of the lures Paul was using, which happened to be one of my JoeyLures.  Paul proceeded to give him the lure and Rod was thrilled.  He said he would email me if he had luck with it and might want more.  Well I got an email last night and Rod was thrilled with the fish he had been catching with the lure and said he definately wanted to get more.  I'm not trying to spam here, just trying to put up a happy thread and the smile on Rod's face made my night!!!  Here is the pic he sent.  I can't seem to make it bigger, but its still viewable.    So Have a Nice Day Everyone - Go Fishing  Joey"
495379,muskeybugged,2010-08-17 14:37:00,282,What are you going to name your tackle company?!?!?!?
495392,Harrison,2010-08-17 15:06:00,2202,"Awesome Joey!  I like ""Tybo Master"" lures."
495395,Roy,2010-08-17 15:12:00,13728,Glad to hear that Joey! You should start watching for aggressive competitive takeovers. You're only one hostile takeover away from being called Avery's Tackle.
495399,Joey,2010-08-17 15:15:00,9122,"  I think this says it all  Paul says to call them Joeywhores, but I dont' think that'll fly, I'll be surprised if it even makes it past the board censor here!!!"
495401,John,2010-08-17 15:20:00,2956," Pretty sure you tricked the language police by not putting a space between Joey and w...., well , you know.  Joeylures has a nice ring to it, Joeylures.com sounds even better.  Yup, watch out from hostile takeovers from Sturgeon Falls."
495403,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 15:24:00,154,"here in sudbury theres a guy who makes lures, not gonna say names as he might be reading, but the first bass I caght on it bent the arm of the spinner. as it was 6 bucks I was not impressed, my walmart spinner lasted longer and it was 2bucks"
495411,livinisfishin,2010-08-17 15:44:00,661, Judging by that picture and the size of fish on there I don't think the hook is going to bend . Plus he wants more of them so they must be high quality!
495418,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 15:52:00,154,"  I am not entirely sure why you quoted me, I was in no way disrespecting her lures if thats what you are trying to get at, I was merely sharing a experience with local lures although I have had way more positive experiences with local lures as they are most likely to be made to suit my local conditions Thanks, Tommy"
495421,blaque,2010-08-17 15:59:00,2419," Positive Tommy......Positive comments , remember.........happy thread"
495425,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 16:03:00,154,"  Indeed...well best of luck with your lures, you could move down south to the glades and use your lures as a gator removal service lol"
495441,Joey,2010-08-17 16:23:00,9122, Well shoot me your address by PM Tommy and I'll send you up one of mine to try.  Bass fishing?  Pike?  Let me know your preference.  Joey
495443,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 16:29:00,154,"  PM sent, I am excited to give your lures a rip!"
495447,mistyriver1,2010-08-17 16:41:00,600,Good stuff Joey.  Did he catch that fish up at Nippising or another lake ?
495466,Joey,2010-08-17 17:20:00,9122," He didn't say Jim, but it sure looks like Nip to me!  You heading up for the annual soon?"
495469,Joey,2010-08-17 17:25:00,9122,"Okay, I fiddled around and made it bigger.  His title is Nipissing10 so yes, looks like Nipissing and he said it was 10 lbs in his email.  Looks like the river to me!  LOVE that smile!!!     "
495479,Harrison,2010-08-17 17:43:00,2202,Great smile and nice work on the spinnerbait!  I think he took that pic at the dock for ya Joey.
495515,Terry,2010-08-17 18:51:00,14456,I didn't even know you made lures  they look real nice
495516,Roy,2010-08-17 18:53:00,13728,Yeah Joey makes great baits. I have a bunch of them.
495520,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 18:59:00,2690,"Nice, Joey...that's a big-ass spinnerbait, probably work great for musky as well."
495521,Terry,2010-08-17 18:59:00,14456,I guess I should have gone to Lakair to find these things out...
495523,splashhopper,2010-08-17 19:02:00,2931, Passed
495554,aplumma,2010-08-17 20:51:00,6896,so if I write joey checkout girl  it should say checkout girl..... doat that didn't work.   I have been using the Joey lures and they work great. Speaking of which Joey send me your Address please I have finally finished the lure I made for you but did not finish in time for Lak Air to deliver.  Thanks  Art
495558,Rich Clemens,2010-08-17 21:14:00,3131,Great ... Now everyone will want one.  I'm gonna be putting some of them to the test here in a few weeks.
495561,mistyriver1,2010-08-17 21:19:00,600,"  Yes, we're heading up at the end of the month...Cant wait !!"
