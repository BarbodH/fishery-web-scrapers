496048,zeeter,2010-08-19 03:58:00,92,"Just wondering how everyone has been doing on Erie for smallmouth.  I fish the Selkirk area and Long Point earlier in the season.  Haven't had as much success as in the past.  Today we went out again and marked a lot of fish in 20 ft. of water but had very little success (3rd time in a row  .  Tried all the typical techniques (tubes, drop shotting, crankbaits, jerkbaits etc.).   I am considering trying the Port Colbourne area or Lowbanks.  Is this worth trying?  How has your summer on Erie gone?  What has worked for you?  What depth of water have you had most success in?"

496081,smally21,2010-08-19 13:06:00,993,ive done better this summer for smallmouth than last.  ive always heard leeches were the best but i find the usual gulp minnows or white twister tails work ok.  hate to admit it but a worm on a jig head works great. ive been drift fishing the channels and doing ok. fish the flats and shallows with white spinnerbaits tipped with yellow or white rubber.
