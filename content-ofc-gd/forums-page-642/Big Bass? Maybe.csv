495882,Roy,2010-08-18 19:23:00,13728,"Yeah, maybe YOU'RE 6ft but how tall is the dude in the pic?"
495891,hirk,2010-08-18 19:40:00,571,4.4lbs ish
495896,fish_fishburn,2010-08-18 19:51:00,1311,"That first one is no more than 3.5 maybe 4 lbs tops. I can put my fist in the mouth of a bass over 5. thats how I check em first before I weigh them. My buddy thinks i'm mentally challenged but he's starting to believe me  That second one looks like a fin to me look at the mouth on it. Damn close, nice fish buddy."
495897,chuckymcd,2010-08-18 20:02:00,144,we need to know the weight and what does the winner get lol
495899,2kj,2010-08-18 20:03:00,77,"And you EC1 have illustrated my point exactly, ""suppose to be"" and you're right"
495902,2kj,2010-08-18 20:06:00,77,We are but one dude...
495903,2kj,2010-08-18 20:07:00,77,"Harrison nailed it dead on, 4 plus 2"
495904,2kj,2010-08-18 20:08:00,77,"Just curious about people's perception, 4 plus 2 was mine"
495910,thefireman,2010-08-18 20:20:00,51,I'm going 4.5 to 5. Very nice bass.  On second thought 4.2. lol I posted a little late
495912,jedimaster,2010-08-18 20:26:00,3472,"Just for a side by side...  I know exactly how much this one was. Was measured on digital hand scale as well as verified and corrected against a tournament in water scale setup.     This measure 5.22 on a handheld digital, and corrected to 5.45 on an in water tournament digital setup.  When comparing pictures look at the size of the persons hands compared to the fish. In my case  look at my hand and how far down its face goes compared to the other ones. I have pretty big hands. COmparing to someones body is relative to the distance between the fish to the body to the camera. If the person holding the fish can't put there fist in its mouth it ain't 5 pounds."
495913,glen,2010-08-18 20:29:00,2641,Nice bass.  We could all catch some really big bass if we just had longer arms.  The pics of fish held out at arms length look stupid.
495920,Governator,2010-08-18 20:47:00,879,nevermind
495964,fish_fishburn,2010-08-18 23:45:00,1311,Your right Jedimaster.if your fist don't fit in its mouth it aint a fin. Who needs scales.haha
495966,danbouck,2010-08-19 00:03:00,4380,I was going to say 1.5lbs
495971,Whitespinnerbait,2010-08-19 00:19:00,2038,Looks likes a solid fish 5 lbs 10 ozs
496001,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-19 01:55:00,602,"I agree with Glen, hate when people hold them all the way out, are we supposed to think the bass is 4 feet long? lol"
496006,msp,2010-08-19 02:03:00,1336,"What about your avatar pic? I like the pictures that emphasize the beauty of the fish. I rarely look at the guy holding the fish. Im looking at the fish. A little bit of "" trick photography "" never hurt anyone. Anyways, nice fish guys."
496011,fishinguypat,2010-08-19 02:26:00,547,4 lb flat
496028,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-19 02:56:00,602,"That was a really big smallie, didn't have to hold it out"
496126,jbailey,2010-08-19 15:32:00,866,haha some great comments in here
496129,steverowbotham,2010-08-19 15:36:00,1800,"looks 4 1/4 to me Edit: Should have read past the first page.  Oh well, it was close!"
496156,Cudz,2010-08-19 17:22:00,2652,I was guessing 4.6 before I read the answer.  Hard to tell how fat it was from that pic. When I catch smallies and weigh them I am usually within 2 or 3 tenths of a pound away from the weights and we are talking 3 - 4 pounders.
495845,2kj,2010-08-18 17:47:00,77,Let's talk size.  We all know American's exagerate the size of the bass they catch on some of the WFN shows and of course haven't we all about the one that got away.  I just want to see what your perception of weight is of a commonly caught fish like a largemouth. How much?  See pic below first response
495846,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-18 17:49:00,2690," Where's the ""pic""???"
495847,2kj,2010-08-18 17:51:00,77,
495848,muskeybugged,2010-08-18 17:52:00,282,12lbs easy!!!!!
495849,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-18 17:52:00,0,"There are two types of Large Mouth in North America, the Northern Largemouth and the Florida Largemouth. The Florida sub-species grows much faster than the northern (what we have here is the northern)....."
495850,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-18 17:53:00,2690, That's better....I'll say 5 1/2 lbs.
495851,Harrison,2010-08-18 17:54:00,2202,4lbs +/- a couple ounzes.
495852,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-18 17:54:00,0,American's exagerate.   Stick around a while and see that green carp are not the only kind of fish that are exagerated..... Wouldn't be a fishing tale otherwise.       3.5 lbs
495853,2kj,2010-08-18 17:55:00,77,"not sure why it didnt post the first time nor am I sure why it posted it twice,   so guessitmate weight on the first fish"
495854,2kj,2010-08-18 17:56:00,77,and the weight?
495855,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-18 17:59:00,0,19 inches 4 lbs. But it depends on what is in that big stomach!
495857,mbosh1980,2010-08-18 18:02:00,349,for reference how big is the dude in the pic?
495859,2kj,2010-08-18 18:07:00,77,"6 ft, 210"
495861,2kj,2010-08-18 18:11:00,77,so you're the guest angler on one of those shows!
495862,mbosh1980,2010-08-18 18:12:00,349,somewhere in the 4- 5lb range then just guessing
495864,jedimaster,2010-08-18 18:32:00,3472,"3.78 lbs and 18"""
495865,alexcba,2010-08-18 18:43:00,634, lol  or you could just say that the florida bass are only known as the florida bass because their growing season is year round. where as when the ice hits our water our bass ALMOST stop feeding.  i say 25lbs 25oz and measure it to be about 19' LOL
495866,Joey,2010-08-18 18:43:00,9122,6 lbs.
495870,chuckymcd,2010-08-18 18:59:00,144,i would have to say 5 1/2 no more then that still a big fish tho
495872,Terry,2010-08-18 19:03:00,14456,"if you are 6ft, it could be over 5 lbs"
495874,EC1,2010-08-18 19:08:00,930,"I'd say 4. Only problem is, over the weekend I saw a picture that was supposed to be ""an 8lb+ fish"", but I called it out as a good 5+."
495877,Jay T,2010-08-18 19:11:00,282,"He is aprox the same size as me, and he is holding it about 12-14"" away from the body. I say 4 1/2 lbs max."
495879,bassman87,2010-08-18 19:16:00,586,"This is The Matrix, and there is no bass."
495880,Stoty,2010-08-18 19:16:00,2910,I'd say between 5 - 5.5lbs Nice fish for sure!   Exactly right!
495881,mbosh1980,2010-08-18 19:22:00,349,"op, do you have a weight on this and are just testing our perception, or are you looking for an estimate because you aren't sure? For reference I thought this one was easily 5 lbs when I caught it but weighed in just shy...  I'm 5' 10"" and not holding it out all that far (I know it looks it)."
