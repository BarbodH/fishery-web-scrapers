If anyone is in the area drop by if you see the 16' lund or My jacked up jeep grand cherokee with a snorkel(its not hard to miss).  I was going to set them up with some drop shot rigs and some nose tipped minnows to hopefully get them into some Smallies o some walleye. (i'll be using the usualy plastics, I am just not a fan of live bait but for the kids it keeps them entertained. I figured on fishing the weed edgas on the West shore near the park and the weed edge near the rocky point just north of the park. Anyone have any other areas close by we should try out? If you want to PM me feel free."
