495473,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 17:30:00,2690,"I realise there have been lots of battery threads on the forum, just a quick question. Anybody using the deep cycle Energizers sold at Walmart?  What do you think of them? Heading to Restoule in four days, need a new deep cycle for around $120 or less.  Thanks in advance!!"
495475,Roy,2010-08-17 17:36:00,13728,"Best battery for the money, Frankie. I have two in series for the 24v, 70 lb Minnkota and they're great. You won't go wrong and you shouldn't be paying $120 either."
495480,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 17:45:00,2690,"Thanks, Roy!!!  Think the one I saw last week was $107 at the Walmart in Kitchener...haven't looked in Woodstock, yet. Pretty sure I read on the forum somewhere that a few of you guys said the energizers were way better than the Nautilus that CT sells."
495487,Lunker777,2010-08-17 17:56:00,866,"I have a Energizer deep cycle in my boat.... 36# bow mount... I got it before bass opener in 2009... I havent put the charger on it once this year.. other then at the beginning of bass season .... i use my boat...2-3 times a week ???  Knock on wood, I would say they are well worth the money..... and Ya, $120 is crazy.... I picked mine up for $89 on sale and its the BIG battery... I forget the amperage !"
495507,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 18:39:00,2690," Did you buy it at Walmart for that price? Must have been a rollback, followed by a rollforward now, LOL! It was the big one I looked at for $107. I'm liking what I hear about the longevity of them from you guys."
495508,Lunker777,2010-08-17 18:41:00,866," Ya my Uncle picked it up for me as a present for my ""new"" boat hahah and he got it from wally world @ that price !  Like I said... I havent put the charger on it at all this year and its still running strong ??? .... knock on wood... again ! haha"
495512,Cosmos,2010-08-17 18:48:00,588," Hey,  i was asking same question couple months ago. I followed Roy advice and got Energizer for myself. It's pretty good battery."
495550,bassmasta,2010-08-17 20:30:00,27,How do these compare to the ones at Costco (Kirkland)?
495566,Roy,2010-08-17 21:28:00,13728,I've never used Kirklands but some friends have them and they like them. It might just be a bad coincidence but I've never seen nor heard of a good Nautilus. There must be some good ones because they seem to be selling enough of them.
495578,Whitespinnerbait,2010-08-17 22:07:00,2038,"I've had one for three years now ....must be over 100,000 km's on it  Still going strong  Btw ...   It goes on sale for $ 79.99 at times"
495589,Pigeontroller,2010-08-17 22:57:00,2793,"I have one, I will buy another..."
495591,16sailor,2010-08-17 22:59:00,38,    Ive got 3 interstate batt that i bought this spring for my 36volt motor then relized i needed the bigger one so had to buy 3 more im selling them for $110 each
495593,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 23:10:00,2690," Is that the energizer you are speaking of, for $79.99?? I only have four days until we leave, so don't really have time to wait for a sale, unfortunately."
495601,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-17 23:41:00,0,"I grabbed the Optima blue top, super easy, super light and maint. free!(AGM) Beware though, it has a heavy price........"
495617,mistyriver1,2010-08-18 00:12:00,600,"I've got one, very happy with it.  Holds a charge very well."
495628,Whitespinnerbait,2010-08-18 00:33:00,2038, Yep...  
495636,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-18 00:50:00,2690,Thanks for all the replies guys!!  Think I've seen enough good endorsements to go pick one up in the next day or two.  Cheers!
495706,Guest nuker,2010-08-18 03:25:00,0,"here's one more!  i got 2 that i got for $97 each at walmart.  last time i was there, i think i saw them for $87.  i see their price range from $87 to $115 so it's about timing to get the deal.  i have a power drive v2 70# 24V and i have a humminbird 997c hooked up to them.  i've gone a solid 8 hours in heavy winds, running between 5 and 10 on the power, and only dropped 1 bar on the battery indicator on the minn kota.  normally i run no more than 2-2.5 on the power for the motor, so it was pretty windy.  and i have a princecraft 186 with a merc 150 opti, 2 people, 60 gallons of gas and 2 full livewells and gear.  so i vouch for them too.  i believe mine are the 850 starting/deep cycles"
496146,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-19 16:54:00,2690,"Picked up the Energizer today, thanks for the help guys.  Thanks to lakerguy for his PM, as well, I did check out that alternative...ended up being a few bucks more than the battery I purchased. Looking forward to ""christening"" it up at Restoule."
