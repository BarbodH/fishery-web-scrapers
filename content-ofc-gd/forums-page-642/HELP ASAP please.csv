At least on my sled anyway. All done here now, make what you must of the thread.  Those little snap rings are a pain too. They get me every single time!"
496397,JohnF,2010-08-20 12:35:00,3494, Why me? I last worked on sleds in 1975.  I don't even know what brand you're working on. Back in my day I think all engines were configured so you couldn't mix up the cylinders.  Stands to reason the hot cylinder is the one away from the fan assuming the fan is a pusher nd the near one if the fan is pulling the air..  JF
