496099,justwannafish,2010-08-19 14:11:00,82,I'm gonna take my Hobie PA to Martindale Pond this weekend. Anyone fished it before? Don't really know what to expect. I heard there's good largemouth and apparently pike too. Hope I can hook 'em both!
496102,TC1OZ,2010-08-19 14:14:00,987,   More bass than pike. I fish it all the time.  Watch out for the rowers.  And there's carp if you are into that!

496199,TC1OZ,2010-08-19 19:28:00,987," There's lots of fish in there, no real monsters. I made a couple reports from here before, but get little repose.    Decent fishing from shore as well. Bigugli fishes there all the time."
