478794,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-23 23:25:00,0,Good Luck! Sounds like something I'd be interested in watching.Also good luck to Barry too.
478942,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-24 11:41:00,0,"I just went to the getting hooked site and have been watching videos. Its a shame, you and Barry made a great team. Barry has a lot of passion for fishing and a great talker and you have the skill. But I'm sure your new ventures will be equally entertaining. I hope the new site is as organized as the old one."
479028,chris.brock,2010-06-24 14:49:00,4053,"sounds like a great idea for a show, sort of a reality fishing show, it should be a good for a wider viewing audience too"
479112,Twocoda,2010-06-24 18:16:00,4130,"ok heres my pitch....  Fishin show pays all expenses for him and I to go to Lake Diefenbaker to harness the power of the record rainbows....once i beat the record   ....( might take me two episodes  ) i will be more then happy to list your name along side mine in the record books  ...give the local Sask boys a run for their record that they seem to keep in the family....  The title of the show could be ....""Shirley Records Aren't For Just Locals""  Let me know if ya want me to pack my bags...."
479115,lunkerbasshunter,2010-06-24 18:25:00,2585,oh wow!  this is one of my favorite shows!  loved going online to watch the episodes!  Good luck to you both in your future careers!
495885,Homer Is King,2010-08-18 19:27:00,305,"I only found out about this show in the spring. It quickly became one of my favorites. I'm sad to here it's no more.  Good luck on your new shows, I look forward to watching them."
495914,dobee,2010-08-18 20:30:00,301,good luck aaron! i always loved watching your pin and niagara river episodes!  hope to see more in the future!
495915,jediangler,2010-08-18 20:34:00,1923,"Never saw it, so won't miss it. Half an hour of fishing commercials is what most of these shows are anyway."
495925,Tybo,2010-08-18 21:04:00,1373,Funny you said that Jed. I use to only watch the shows for the pitch lines on new equipment.
495933,bassman87,2010-08-18 21:45:00,586,you must be a blast at parties
496167,cityfisher,2010-08-19 17:56:00,959,+1  lol  I also liked Aaron and Barry show... Love the niagara !

478235,bigbuck,2010-06-22 18:34:00,2449,"Aaron, best of luck to you and Barry. You guys had a great show and I enjoyed it and now I'm going to miss it."
478253,msp,2010-06-22 19:18:00,1336,Shirley you cant be serious ! Good luck with the new show Aaron. Keep us posted
478259,alexcba,2010-06-22 19:22:00,634, 
478266,Harrison,2010-06-22 19:26:00,2202," He is and don't call him Shirley.  Good Luck gents, it's not an easy go as you know.  I have a concept/idea for a fishing show that is 5 years in the making and it's finally coming together. Some here will remember it.  All the best guys!"
478267,rock34,2010-06-22 19:28:00,215,Good luck Aaron....  Sign me up as a guest anytime
478272,fishindude,2010-06-22 19:37:00,220,"Sorry to hear that Getting Hooked has come to an end, I'm a huge fan of your bass, pike/musky and walleye episodes; they were an awesome remedy for those cabin fever days during winter. Watching Barry get pumped on catching fish big or small was always entertaining  Good luck to both you and Barry, I hope you guys are still on good terms with each other. Looking forward to both new projects from the both of ya's  Cheers"
478288,limeyangler,2010-06-22 20:09:00,5204,Good luck on your new venture Aaron...if its as good as your last show its a win win situation for us mere mortals.
478290,Big Cliff,2010-06-22 20:13:00,6899,"Really sorry to hear that news but everything that happens, happens for a reason, perhaps now we will have two great shows to watch instead of only one.  I hope you will post on here when you start looking for guest hosts, I'd love to know more.  A fan of you both!  Big Cliff"
478296,alexcba,2010-06-22 20:21:00,634,"the first show should be ""surely fishing, with guest host big cliff, walleye fishing the kawarthas"""
478305,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-22 20:40:00,2690,Ouch
478330,Big Cliff,2010-06-22 21:38:00,6899," Ya, well the topic could be ""how to catch a fish when all else fails"""
478363,Handlebarz,2010-06-22 23:22:00,3790,Dang sorry to here of the loss of a good show but at the same time I hope the new one works out for you Aaron were looking forward to it. Good luck in the future
478374,irishfield,2010-06-22 23:43:00,26272,"I think it's a great move Aaron...  Barry was holding you back !  Now for future shows.... .na we couldn't do the ""secrets of Temagami ice""... you can't find any!   .. and we couldn't show baits, or locations so it would be pretty boring with just them big fish in the lime light.."
478379,solopaddler,2010-06-22 23:54:00,8605,"  I'm positive that Wayne said this with a grain of salt.  Personally I'm not afraid to say I agree with this statement 100%.  Good luck in your future venture, I'm sure it'll be a success."
478430,mistaredone,2010-06-23 02:09:00,913,Good luck Aaron. Just saw my first show on Kash muskies. Got a good kick out of you guys. All the best
478459,bigfish1965,2010-06-23 03:24:00,3382,"Good luck to both you guys. You both have my number if you need anything. You have more than enough guests to pick from right here, Aaron. Tons of great anglers. I would start with Moosebunk and Lew if I were you !"
478468,vinnimon,2010-06-23 03:45:00,2593,Good luck to both of you on your new ventures! Hope to see you up a the tyler tourney as well.
478512,Spiel,2010-06-23 12:05:00,9065,Best fishes (you knew someone had to say it) to both of you in your new endeavours.
478514,motv8tr,2010-06-23 12:06:00,2587,"That's too bad, but exciting times ahead for both of you it seems.  I'll keep my eye out for the new shows.  Best of luck to both of you  Maureen"
478588,Aaron Shirley,2010-06-23 16:20:00,655,"Thank you all for your comments everyone. I was waiting for the pun and movie reference  I definitely hope to receive formal show ideas from OFC'ers on my new site when it is up and running. For now, a PM here will do, as the new site will not be up until the fall. You do not need to be a tourney angler, guide or fishing pro to pitch a show idea.  I have already received several good show ideas from anglers since the press release from here, Facebook etc. I look forward to hearing your show ideas!  I will have a press release all about the new show later to keep you all informed.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
