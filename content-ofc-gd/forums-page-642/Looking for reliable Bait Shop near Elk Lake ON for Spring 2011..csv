495869,Shoredump,2010-08-18 18:57:00,2,"I am looking for a Bait Shop in or around Elk Lake for a trip scheduled in spring 2011.  The name of the shop, phone number, coordinates or addess are all welcome.  Looking for medium to large shiners, suckers or chubs.  I'm going to try and net my own, but in the event I'm unsuccessful (could happen), I'd really like a backup plan.  Thanks all."
