I am looking for a lake with pike, bass,and walleye. I am looking to stay for couple of days so I will need cottage too. If you guys know a good place let me know.  Thank you !"
495676,johnnyb,2010-08-18 02:32:00,3413,I would do a search for cottage rentals in the Temagami area...many lakes in that area have all 3 of the species you mentioned.  A few places that come to mind....Lady Evelyn Lake....Montreal River....Temiscaming....if you start searching for cottages/lodges in those areas you should find a place between now and Sept.  Good Luck!

It's where the famous Spanish River flows into the North Channel of Lake Huron.  Enjoy your trip wherever you go."
