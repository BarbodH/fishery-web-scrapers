But my friend from New Zealand has moved here and we're planning a fishing/camping weekend. He's living Orillia area right now so I figure I'll head North and we'll go from there. Thing is I'm not really sure where to go seeing as I just got my yak and all and haven't really been afforded the opportunity before to get out ON the water. I'd really like to show this Kiwi that we've got some great fishing here in our freshwater lakes. So if there's somewhere within an hour or so in any direction of Orillia (I'm not really that picky on where we go) that you guys have fish/camped and remember being a good time I'd like to hear about it!  Thanks!!  And hopefully I'll have some pics to show of Martindale Pond off the Yak tomorrow night!!  Later!"
