The new digs in the ville should suit us well all the big ticket items have been done,windows,roof,doors,kitchen,bathroom.  I like to tinker in the garden a bit and the new place has nice back and side yard.  "

496104,danbouck,2010-08-19 14:17:00,4380,"Congrats, looks like a nice place"
496106,Mike Pike,2010-08-19 14:26:00,1332,I'll bet that place was in 'move in' condition.  Looks like the previous owners were meticulous about their yard.  May you enjoy many great years there!
496108,blaque,2010-08-19 14:37:00,2419,gorgeous backyard. very cozy and shaded.  I dont envy the upkeep thats going to be needed to keep it in that shape though lol. Hopefully youve got a bit of a green thumb.

496268,lookinforwalleye,2010-08-19 22:39:00,4399,Yes it is in move in condition not a thing to do which suits my lazy frugal side. The yard is very nice and very well maintained and there is a nice waterfall/pond maybe I`ll get me a pet Bass!
496297,Pigeontroller,2010-08-20 00:43:00,2793,Very nice!
