496050,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-19 08:17:00,0,"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/images/ontario_72.pdf (takes time to load)  Been researching on trolling out in the deeper water (not the harbors) and now I wanna try going deeper than 40 feet with my yak if the conditions allow. My go to setup's probably going to be a magnum dipsy diver, then a spin doctor 5 feet after, then a trolling fly 26 inches after(classic setup). Spindoctors by dreamweaver are said to be the best flashers on the market according to the reports on www.Spoonpullers.com ...The Trollers Website - Home and their description...and also said to be very deadly with their Strong Fly.  I can't wait"
