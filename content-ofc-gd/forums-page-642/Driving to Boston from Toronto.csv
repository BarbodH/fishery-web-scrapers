494896,Steel28,2010-08-16 14:16:00,160,"Hey Gang,  I will be driving to Boston from Toronto and would like to stop at Cabela's. Is there one on the way without taking any detours?    thanks"
494906,Roy,2010-08-16 14:35:00,13728,I think that the closest one will be a 40 mile jaunt away from I-90 into East Hartford CT.
494909,John,2010-08-16 14:42:00,2956,Yup that's the closest. There is also a Bass Pro in Auburn NY.
494911,Steel28,2010-08-16 14:44:00,160,thanks a lot Roy and John.
494935,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-16 16:25:00,932,You go right by the Bass Pro - it's near the wildlife and game reserve.
494961,NBR,2010-08-16 17:27:00,163,"I've made the trip from Michigan to New Hampshire through Toronto many times. My suggestion would be Toronto to Cornwall on 401. South at Cornwall into the USA. Across the north end of New York State to Rouses Point, NY then into Vermont to I89 to I93 then south to Boston. There is a BPS in Foxborough in the Gillette Stadium complex. Just a short drive from down town Boston."
494966,Steel28,2010-08-16 17:36:00,160,   might take that route! thank you.
494971,John,2010-08-16 17:54:00,2956, Done it both ways. You're gonna add 200+Km on to the journey going that way.........just my 0.02..plus if you need to buy gas in Canada....................
496221,lhousesoccer,2010-08-19 20:21:00,442,"Absolutely correct.  Going the Cornwall route is out of the way.  You have to go quite a ways north, then back south as you head west to Toronto.  I currently live in Vermont, but travel to London Ontario to see my family all the time.  My wife's family lives in Boston.  From Boston to Toronto, the best way is to take I-90 west out of Boston straight across Massachusetts, into New York, and all the way across NY State to the end of the toll boths.  It'll cost you about $20 in tolls, but it's the most direct, and fastest route.  You should hit Toronto in under 10 hours.  A couple tips I've learned from doing this drive to London, Ontario 3 to 4 times a year for the last 12 years:     I used to take the I-190 to the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and cross over there, meeting up with the 405 to the QEW.  DON'T TAKE THAT ROUTE, unless you love being stuck in traffic, potentially for several hours depending on the time of day you're crossing.  All the commercial truck traffic goes that way, since they are not allowed downtown Niagara Falls.  When crossing over the Rainbow Bridge from downtown Niagara Falls, NY to Niagara Falls, Ontario, you're literally on regular city streets.  They have to keep the traffic flowing or it snarls the downtown areas.  It moves very quickly, and you'll save a ton of time."
