228669,Moosebunk,2008-07-17 00:04:00,3970,"Couple questions....  Is the finger swollen or just bruised???  Does it hurt constantly, or only when you try to move it?  Is the fingertip numb or feel like pins and needles?  Is there any deformity?  With your finger, how well can you push against and pull a finger on the other hand?  Which part of the finger is injured?... from finger tip to knuckle (3rd joint) you have two other joints.  First at tip, second at middle, then the ""them's fighting words"" 3rd knuckle, which is the bad one???  When you move your finger, do you hear or feel crepitus (something grinding)???  When you initially hurt your finger did you hear or feel anything snap?  (not totally useful in determining one way or another)  Is your pain better, worse or the same since about an hour after you first injured your finger?"
228675,solopaddler,2008-07-17 00:24:00,8605,Smash your toe with a hammer that'll eliminate your finger pain. If finger pain returns repeat.
228730,duckdog,2008-07-17 02:09:00,162,"Lol on #7 of broken fingers or toes, ok I am a cluts, moving or not moving your finger is no way to tell only once could I not move it when it was broken and that was an axe mishap, everytime I have bin in the doc said do you want me to waste money on an xray or tell ya its broke? A cast is usually only if its major bad, but I am not a doctor just repeating some of my misshaps lol"
228801,little angler,2008-07-17 09:48:00,128,"k so here it is today it was feelin better,but then i went swimming and it was a pretty shallow pool in my backyard one of the easy set up ones with the poles. i was crawlin on my hands and and feet with belly facing up if u know wat i mean? and i stepped out itt ereeeee doogggyyyyy it hurt like a .....you know but its my knuckle and its a little swollen still i cant bend it all the way down to touch my palm like usual. It still hurts pretty might see doc on Friday. theres no popping grinding or anything and i can bend my other finger with it pushing and putting pressure but it still deffinetly hurts.didnt ice it today going to do that soon,it's 5:47 too lazy to get it now and parents are sleeping"
228864,Headhunter,2008-07-17 12:54:00,5703,"Lop it off, God gave you 9 more! Man, maybe you should try putting it in a Catfish's mouth, take yer mind off of it! HH"
228867,Moosebunk,2008-07-17 13:04:00,3970,"Soft Tissue Injury.  My bet is no break.  Even if it was broken it could heal just fine without a cast.  I've broken my left 4th and 5th knuckles 3 times in my life and an index finger.  2 of 4 times casted.  Made no difference either way, just be careful for awhile with it.  And yes, after the last break I went fly fishing for 4 days in Quebec and it did hurt using the hand to cast with so I wore a splint when it got real sore.  You ""could"" do the same.   disclaimer... this is by no means what you should do.  You should make your own choice or see an MD."
228877,JohnF,2008-07-17 13:25:00,3494," Those were the days, weren't they.  I think I broke all but one of my fingers at least once (judging by the peculiar twists and turns in 'em), wrecked an ankle, and too many busted ribs to remember (cuz they hurt like a sumbeetch at the time). The only injuries I ever got treatment for were a partially-torn Achilles (badminton with my son - no warmup) and a bunch of more recent broken ribs in a car accident. The doctor looked at the x-ray and asked me what I did to have so many old rib breaks. It was all from basketball, football and hockey in high school. Our football seasons were very short but it seems to me I ended up on crutches more games than not. Oddly enough I never broke any big bones nor did I lose any teeth. Never had any stitches either, but that was probably more about being a wuss and just taping the cut up tight for a while. It took about 40 years (literally) to get the feeling back in one divot I took out of my leg when I was about 12.  It's amazing how well the human body can take care of itself, isn't it? But I am noticing these days that there seems to be something suspiciously like arthritis in the last joint on both middle fingers. Perhaps the long term price of too many jammed fingers in basketball.  JF"
228143,little angler,2008-07-15 22:04:00,128,"K so i was playing soccer with my cousins and i was in net the ball came at me and hit my finger bending it back i iced it right away. Woke up today it was purple on the knuckle(middle finger) so ye it was a bit purple. I can sorta bend it but not all the way down to touch my palm like usual.This sucks because im heading to Nipissing in 2 weeks!  and if its broken i will need a cast my grandma recently broke hers. The doctor advised a cast but she refused to so she has a splint for me i just taped my middle finger to  my index, i will continue to ice regularly. Any tips or suggestions to if its broken,jammed,sprained or just badly burused?if broken can i fish? Thanks L.A"
228151,Roy,2008-07-15 22:18:00,13728,Even with a splint on it you'll still be able to fish. Get it looked at.
228163,mikeh,2008-07-15 22:36:00,824,"as Roy suggested , go see your doctor and he will order some x-rays for you to see if it is broken."
228165,little angler,2008-07-15 22:39:00,128,ok but they might put a cast one which would suck..
228167,wallyboss,2008-07-15 22:41:00,1095,"Chances are if it was broken you would not be able to move it. Probably just a bad sprain, ice it up for 20 minutes at a time every couple of hours  to get the swelling down and you should be able to go fishing no problem. If it is your casting hand I might put a tether cord on the rod and on your wrist just in case.  Used to do that to my son when I let him borrow my rods when he was younger."
228168,Marko,2008-07-15 22:43:00,854,Its probably just jammed. Happened to me quite a bit when I used to play basketball. Its gonna get better in few days
228176,little angler,2008-07-15 23:04:00,128,hope so man i really dont wanna mess this 1 time of year trip up.
228181,gone_fishin,2008-07-15 23:23:00,481,"a finger... no problem... you've got 9 more, you'll make do just fine with the fishing!  when i was younger i broke my arm just before my annual Rice Lake trip, and a family scheduled trip to Florida. i had a cast on for both trips... and did plenty of fishing on both trips.  So if i can do it with a full length arm cast, you can do it with a little finger splint!  Suck it up little man... get out there and do what you live to do! GO FISHING!!!"
228185,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-15 23:31:00,2585,"get it fixed, a cast is a pain while fishing but the arthritis you may get when your older from not getting it fixed will be way more of a pain when you cant hold a reel.  cheers!"
228207,Marko,2008-07-16 00:39:00,854,Grab some electrical tape and tape it up lol.
228209,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-16 00:41:00,3761,"Come on Little Angler, don't pull out on me now. You will figure it out man."
228217,forrest,2008-07-16 01:03:00,1032,"Go see the doctor right away.  Risk of not seeing a doctor....loose a finger or have some funky feeling in the finger for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. Risk of seeing a doctor....none.  It is supposed to be an easy decision.  Go downtown Toronto if you can, they have better doctors.  If you want to fish bad enough you will still be able to, even if you need to rig something up.  Learn how to tie knots with your mouth, its possible and you will have something else to impress whoever you want to impress."
228220,Dozer,2008-07-16 01:12:00,896,A few painkillers and you wont feel your finger any more.
228228,Daplumma,2008-07-16 01:25:00,1961,"Go to the doc and tell him the situation.More than likely its sprained,broke fingers are pretty obvious.Splint it or tape it to next finger and bobs your uncle.Get it checked out though.. Joe"
228230,oncogene,2008-07-16 01:29:00,154,Ducktape in for the rescue!!!
228234,Tinman,2008-07-16 01:44:00,376,"I broke a lot of bones in my hand when i was a kid playing lacrosse. I regret not getting them looked at then. age catches up with ya!lol Get it looked at, i played with a cast on my arm one year!"
228235,JohnF,2008-07-16 01:45:00,3494," A real man would just try to bend it backwards. If it touches the back of your hand it's broken. Saves going to the doc.  If it doesn't bend back it may still be broken though. Let us know how that works.  If he splints it, don't hold it up to the window when yer driving around Toronto.  JF"
228238,forrest,2008-07-16 01:47:00,1032, Check your paperboy insurance....they always have funky clauses that pay off money depending on the combination of fingers you loose.  1) get paper route that gives insurance 2) take some pain killers 3) play with a spinning prop or a good fillet knife 4) profit!
228300,little angler,2008-07-16 03:42:00,128,"Mike dont worry bout it screw it i taped it up with a Popsicle stick underneath, i wont back of of jack! ill go to the docks whenever  you asking if i was backing out or bailing is YOUR way of copping out i think,you that scared?hahahim just playin witcha all the best L.A"
228526,Reef Runner,2008-07-16 19:15:00,980,"I broke a finger just months back.  Got it xrayed, but the doc told me a cast is not needed in most cases.  Place the splint ON TOP of the broken member and wrap selfadhesive bandage around to fit tight.  I am fully certified in first aid and proudly hold the only reported office accident, lol.  As a member of the Joint Health and Safety Committee I hope my record stands.  Remember to splint on top, 6 weeks and you'll be fine."
228536,uglyfish,2008-07-16 19:30:00,981,"they will only cast a SEVERELY broken finger, and even then, its only a half cast. basically covers the top or bottom of ur hand, and is help on with a tensor bandage. easy to remove. broken fingers are easy to fish with, done it many times. if ur worried about it beiong broken, go get it xrayed. otherwise, ice and and forget it. i;ve broken lots of bones and i rarely see a doctor cause i know what they will do anyways. playing football i;ve had my share of xrays and i can read them as easy as a doctor can. being friends with an orthopedic surgeon has its perks lol. but really, unless ur actually worried about it, don;t lose any sleep over it. just ice it, 30 minutes on... 60 minutes off. the swelling should go down soon, if it lasts longer then a week with no improvement, then go see a doctor."
228545,fishing n autograph,2008-07-16 19:42:00,2540,"A jammed finger is no problem. I doubt it's broken because you can actually move it.....if it's that bad, tape your fingers together, otherwise don't worry about it. It'll be better in a few days. Just ice it 15min on and 15 min off 7x for the next few days and it'll be better."
228550,Bly,2008-07-16 19:46:00,1556,"Hey Little Angler   Hope the finger is alright.   You have been given good reasons for going to the Dr to get it checked out, listen to us old people, we know things  LOL  As for the fishing.....when there is a will there is a way!   Best of luck to you!!    psssst  Ice and Advil are your friends"
228580,FLEX ROD,2008-07-16 20:35:00,394,"The rule if you can move it then it is not broken is always not corrrect.  Few years back, I fell on a fishing trip and broke my thumb on the second day of a 3 day trip, the hand swelled up big time I could barrely hold the fishing rod but I fished the whole trip then drove to TO from North Bay and ended up having it casted in Richmond Hill.  Get it checked and good luck.  FLEX"
228644,danc,2008-07-16 23:06:00,4677,Those were a dime a dozen to me when I played high school basketball. I remember having four at the same time once. Give them time and they will heal. Probably in a week or so. The only bone that I've ever actually broke was my pelvis. Believe me. You don't ever want to do that.
