228918,jeff24,2008-07-17 14:40:00,35,"Well, I picked sweetie up right from work Tuesday @4 and we headed for the lake.  We were on the water by 5:30 and first fish came at 6:30.  We fished SE of Port Maitland in front of Mowhak, 52 -68 Fow, running leadcore, jets, dipseys and riggers with harnesses, ripplin redfins, nk28's.  Went 3 for 4 (3-7Lbs) off the water by 9pm(work night).  Lead core out 6-7 colours on an inline board took 3 with a copper coloured worm harness, a rigger 40'down out 150' took the 4th.  Lost one at the boat but what a awesome night on the water with a great fishing partner!  GET OUT THERE!  Jeff.     "
