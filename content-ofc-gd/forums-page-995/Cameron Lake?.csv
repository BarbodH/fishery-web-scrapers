All I have heard about the lake is that there are muskies in it. I'm looking for any info on how this lakes musky fishery compares to other kawartha lakes. Or any info at all would be appreciated. Thanks."
228923,Rich,2008-07-17 15:02:00,3927,"You're better off on Balsam or Sturgeon. Cameron is small, and as such so are the majority of it's muskies."
229017,MuddyWater,2008-07-17 18:15:00,218,"good musky in the north end of the lake and the burnt river has some big guys... some old guy the other week said he lost a 50"" at the mouth of the burnt."
229021,linweir,2008-07-17 18:28:00,202,"I fished these 3 lakes frequently. They're different. Cameron lake has a good number of pickerals. The biggest muskie I caught was 41 inch over there. This year I boated a few, no one over 40"". Locals said there're some huge one in the lake. Boyd island should be the place to start."
229068,mattyk,2008-07-17 20:10:00,2110,Cameron has some smaller skies in it. There are bigger guys in the surronding lakes.
229098,fishermccann,2008-07-17 21:11:00,655,"Yes I agree, Sturg. or Balsam  would  be a better bet if you have a choice."
229141,DANIMAL,2008-07-17 22:27:00,215,"Thanks for the responses. I think I'm going to start at cameron, and if I'm not impressed I'll pull out and try a surrounding lake."
