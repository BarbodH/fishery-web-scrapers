228237,Mike the Pike,2008-07-16 01:47:00,3421,Well here it is I am a woose when it comes to holding Catfish I was stung a little when I was a kid and now I fear touching them.  But now I have others like me who are experienced anglers who dread holding the stinging catfish.  Now if I was from Alabanana I would have caught so many I would be just as talented as the Red neck.  So as you can see we 3 people need lessons on holding these ugly fish.  I am sure there are others who may come forward.  So who are ya folks?????          Mike the Pike  
228240,jjcanoe,2008-07-16 01:51:00,744,Yeah I'll admit it as well!!  jjcanoe
228242,forrest,2008-07-16 01:55:00,1032,You big babies!  For the small ones: Put your thumb and middle finger right behind the front fins and use a firm grip.  Pinning them on the ground helps a lot too.  The back of the fins will not hurt you and you will know to stay away from the gill plates.  I never caught a big one before.  forrest  OK...I will admit that I use pliers sometimes too.
228243,Dozer,2008-07-16 01:58:00,896,They only have three spines that sting don't they?
228248,shane,2008-07-16 02:02:00,652,I don't like picking them up at all.  I got stuck right in the palm of my hand one time and it hurt for days. I'll usually grab the hook with my pliers and shake like crazy until it comes off. I like catching the big ones tho'.
228250,Raf,2008-07-16 02:06:00,3495,"I don't believe channel cats and blues have the poison tipped fins, only bullheads.   Just grab them like forrest said.  These on the other hand... I want no part of.  Those toes are in danger as far as I'm concerned.  "
228251,mkeyes,2008-07-16 02:06:00,26,"When I was young, a catfish got my dad right through his shoe... I use plyers !!!!"
228253,sash,2008-07-16 02:07:00,26,guilty as charged....so again where are these spikes that sting
228258,mistyriver1,2008-07-16 02:15:00,600,"There not so bad, they'll actually smile for the camera....  "
228260,Dozer,2008-07-16 02:21:00,896,The spines are on the pec fins and the dorsal fin.  They slime your hand real bad.
228262,kickingfrog,2008-07-16 02:23:00,8333,"They have only three""spiny spikes"" , the leading edge of their pectoral fins and the leading dorsal ray of the the dorsal fin. Fish with more (and all have stuck me more): walleye, perch, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, crappie, rock bass, pumpkin seed. Lip 'em, or slide your hand up from the back to the front and the ""spines"" are great to hold on to, try that with the other fish mentioned. The barbels, ""whiskers"" are nothing to worry about.  Now a leach is a whole 'nother story...er thread. lol"
228269,holdfast,2008-07-16 02:41:00,1813,agreed got spiked more often by walleye and perch.  Oh my dad who knows everything that I dont says that they shoot their spikes like a porcupine.  It must be true because POPs says so.
228278,ccmtcanada,2008-07-16 02:57:00,7971,"Mike...I don't have a phobia about them...as seen here....   And in Bly's defense, I took that pic while she was unhooking that fish...she didn't even know I was taking it until the last second."
228287,modny,2008-07-16 03:23:00,502,"naaaaaaahhhh  just give the mud cat a nice scratch behind the ear and she'll purr like a kitten.   my bait of choice is catnip, or tender vittles.  catfish aren't slimey so its not a big deal, i hate pickin up slimey pike or salmon when their scales fall off all over you. PITA"
228289,Mike the Pike,2008-07-16 03:23:00,3421, OK the wife does
228315,Hooked,2008-07-16 05:30:00,891,They are ugly fish.  Definately gotta watch out for those fins.
228323,Greencoachdog,2008-07-16 09:38:00,8163,"Y'all girley-guys pull yourselves up by the bootstraps and grab the dang Catfish!!!  Actually, the larger they are the easier they are to handle. It's the itty bitty kitten fish that always get me! Like this one:  They're spines are sharper than any hypodermic needle known to man!!!  All Catfish will ""sting"", the slime coat on the spines is the ""venom"". Some folks think it's like a snakebite or Bee sting where the poison is injected from inside the spine, but it's not!  Like others have said, slide your hand up from behind the head, make sure the dorsal spine in front of your hand (inbetween the thumb and index finger) then wrap your thumb and index finger in front of the pectoral spines. This will give you a very firm grip on the fish and the hook can be removed easily.  Large Catfish can be ""lipped"" but I recommend a glove for this as their woodrasp like teeth can leave a nasty abrasion  Bullheads have very powerful jaws and will bite the piss out of ya if you stick your finger in thier mouth!"
228329,steve_paul,2008-07-16 10:40:00,658,I would rather hold my mother in law in a nekkid oily embrace than grab those things.
228337,aplumma,2008-07-16 11:01:00,6896,Well down here in Virginia here are a few examples of how we hold them catfish. assorted catfish holds. Note the ladies way of holding the fish.  Art
228343,bushart,2008-07-16 11:19:00,2628,I've been shoulder deep gutting a moose----face to face with a pack of timberwolves---and I still avoid those cats.  Bushart
228363,BillM,2008-07-16 12:34:00,17367,"Get a good grip behind the fins and there is nothing to worry about.  I hate holding pickerel, wrong word gill plates are like razors..  I'll take a catfish over one of those any day!"
228419,wallyboss,2008-07-16 14:31:00,1095,The problem I ahve with catfish is that they usually poke me when I go to throw them back in. So i usually grab on of the spikes with my longnose pliers and toss em back in that way. Always carry in your tacklebox a small bottle of hand sanitizer. if you get poked just wash your hands with the sanitizer and the sting will go away instantly.
228422,BITEME,2008-07-16 14:44:00,1969,hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
228429,Headhunter,2008-07-16 15:01:00,5703,"As Gerritt is on vacation this week, I'll play the part of G! ""Listen to her!""... grown men whining about a little catfish prick! I'm stunned and somewhat disappointed... bunk of girly men! HH"
228431,Pachone,2008-07-16 15:05:00,276,"I got stung 3 weeks ago, and it hurt for a weeK!!!!! Bled too. I just think there ugly to be honest with ya..... this weekend is time for some sexy pike and bass baby!"
