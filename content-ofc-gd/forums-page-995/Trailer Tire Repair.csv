228480,Woodsman,2008-07-16 17:02:00,1286,Take it to a tire shop & have the pros fix it. Around here a tire repair is about $20. Have them mark the valve stem location and reinstall in the same location so balancing is not required. Another option is to have them remove the object & insert a tube.  Good Luck: Rick
228481,ecmilley,2008-07-16 17:09:00,2163,proper repair is dismounting the tire and repair it with a plug/patch or mushroom plug from the inside of the tire so it can be inspected for internal damage and this repair also seals the injury and the tire's liner

Just follow the directions that come with the kit and you're good to go!!!  Inflate your tire and use some dish soap mixed with water in a spray bottle to find the leak/object, remove the object and plug the hole.  Keep an eye on the tire to make sure the plug is holding."
