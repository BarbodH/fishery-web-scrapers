228881,Fishmaster,2008-07-17 13:41:00,920,Yes the river is in fine shape for walleye all sorts of year classes ..i think this year is going to be one of the best years for Walleye yet ..the river holds Walleye all year round witch makes it very nice for those days you can not get out onto Lake Erie ..another bonus to save a days fishing if the Lake is rough fish the Grand ..
228929,Leecher,2008-07-17 15:13:00,7832,Sweet.... Zach sure had a blast Nice eyes btw. Thansk for sharing. Leetchman
