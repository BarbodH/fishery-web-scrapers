228071,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-15 19:24:00,2585,"awesome fish bly!!!!!  my guess would be around 3.5lbs, whatever the weight it sure is a beauty fish!  cheers!"
228082,misfish,2008-07-15 19:38:00,29133,Sweet smallie Carol Congrats on another PB
228146,BFSC Kevin,2008-07-15 22:07:00,1351,i'd say 4-4.5 lbs nice fish carole.
228193,Sinker,2008-07-16 00:11:00,8692,Congrats Bly!!  Thats a nice smallie anywhere you go!!  Sinker
228283,Bly,2008-07-16 03:13:00,1556,"Thank you everyone!  It was a very nice surprise to pull that in.  The fish took several runs and stayed deep, just when I thought it was ready, it would peel off again, nice tussle on the lighter gear I was using.  Fishnsled, definitely good that Cliff was with me, needed a good net man"
228332,Greencoachdog,2008-07-16 10:54:00,8163,Never underestimate the power of live bait!!!   ... and since you released that fish... it's still growin'and it's prolly up to 6 lbs. now bly!!!
228389,preroller,2008-07-16 13:26:00,18,Nice one!  I'd say closer to 4 lbs  
228417,1leggedangler,2008-07-16 14:30:00,364,"Congrats on the chunker, I would guessestimate 4.5 to 5lbs for a smallie that close to 20inches."
228519,snag,2008-07-16 18:33:00,1932,And she's still got her brace on!  That's hot!
228542,Bly,2008-07-16 19:39:00,1556, LOL Snag   That brace and I are going to be together for some time yet.
228549,tibbs,2008-07-16 19:45:00,650,Great job on the PB!
228661,Smokey,2008-07-16 23:47:00,1278,Congrats to Bly on the PB. Thanks for the report. Mike
228690,limeyangler,2008-07-17 00:57:00,5204,"Nice one guys, congrats on the PB Bly. Glad to see someone else using bobbers for bass Cliff, i found a lake where thats the best method by a long ways to catch the smallies."
228795,Greencoachdog,2008-07-17 08:53:00,8163,"  She can really kick your   with that brace on  Saw her making firewood kindling on the West Arm last month, no ax or hatchet... just a quick Kung Fu reach and grip!!!  ... did you teach her that Cliff?"
227827,ccmtcanada,2008-07-15 12:05:00,7971,"Last night we headed out to a local shore spot to see if we could hook into a few fish.  The carp still seem to be spawning, so instead of trying for them, we decided to see if more smallies were in the area.  I caught a fair sized one there last week, so we rigged using the same setup.  Live leeches on a jig, floating at a depth of about 6 to 7 feet.  The waters were pretty stained with only about 12 inches of visibility.  I caught a few rock bass, but nothing big.  Soon after we got there, Bly's float goes down!!  She tells me ""I've hooked into something...a sheepie?  Maybe a bass!""  The thing fought pretty hard, not wanting to come to the surface.  Finally, her PB comes up....measured in at 19.75"".   We didn't have a scale so no weight estimate.   Any weight guesstimates out there???"
227829,Roy,2008-07-15 12:11:00,13728,"About 140lbs, Cliff. Nice fish too!"
227830,ricoboxing,2008-07-15 12:17:00,398,
227833,Canuck2fan,2008-07-15 12:21:00,1444,No guess on the weight but congrats on a beautie.... WOW good job.
227834,solopaddler,2008-07-15 12:22:00,8605,"I could sense you were getting antsy on the phone last night, now I know why  . Excellent fish! Actually amazing considering the locale, well done  ."
227837,Mike Pike,2008-07-15 12:35:00,1332,"Wow, nice one Bly!  And a nice photo to forever remember it by!!!"
227843,Basskicker,2008-07-15 12:45:00,421,Awesome fish Carol.....I know that spot  Jason
227849,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-15 12:57:00,1362,great fish!!!...congrats on your PB
227852,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-15 12:59:00,3761,Grate fish my guess would be around 3lbs
227853,Rich,2008-07-15 13:01:00,3927,"Beauty! Congrats!  I'm probably way off just judging by a picture, but the bass looks to be between 3-4lbs. Probably leaning closer to 4."
227858,Stoty,2008-07-15 13:24:00,2910,Nice fish for sure! Congrats. I would say around 3.5lbs.
227872,fishinggeek,2008-07-15 13:53:00,325,"Nice one!  Weight probably depends on how big the belly was, but that one looks like a healthy one.  Congrats!"
227878,Moosebunk,2008-07-15 14:03:00,3970,Great fish Bly.  Betcha that chunk gave you a good fight.
227882,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-15 14:27:00,2050,"Awesome fish Bly!!!!  CCMT - I've only ever caught fish that big on the state side of Erie and they're usually FAT PIG's over there.  I've seen 22 inchers weigh anywhere from 5.5 to 7 lbs depending on how fat they were.  I bet it's at least 4 lbs though.  Next time take a girth measurement so you can figure it out!  I'd be curious to see some weights.  I think some people would be suprised at how much some bass weigh - and how little some pike weigh....Pike are probably the #1 fish to be ""over-guesstimated"".  Again, nice catch Bly - to most people that'd be a fish of a lifetime!  Cheers, UF"
227886,tbayboy,2008-07-15 14:30:00,1497,"Congrats Bly, nice fish!"
227890,Joey,2008-07-15 14:35:00,9122,"What a beaut Carol, very nice smallie there.  I'm gonna go with the 3 - 4 lb also.  Joey"
227909,Reef Runner,2008-07-15 15:18:00,980,Congrats on the PB and a fine outting.  I would say 4lbs.
227928,douG,2008-07-15 15:44:00,2693,"Nice catch, Carole.  Fine job."
227950,fishnsled,2008-07-15 16:02:00,3520,"And yet another PB -  OK - Yes I'm jealous.    SWEET fish!  Congrats and I'd say around the 3.5 pound mark + or -.  Good thing Cliff didn't come over to help with the pump, you obviously needed my photographer for the evening."
227977,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-15 17:06:00,0,Congrats on your PB. Its a beauty!
227996,Greencoachdog,2008-07-15 17:31:00,8163,Great report and pic!!!  and congrats to bly on another fine fish!!!  That fish looks pretty healthy so I'll go out on a limb with 4.25 lbs.
228001,Beans,2008-07-15 17:37:00,3339,Ya Dawg...I was thinking 4 lbs and change...I've caught 5 lbrs in the fall that were only 20+ inches...  Atta girl Carole !!!
228003,johnnyb,2008-07-15 17:47:00,3413,"B-E-A-yootiful fish!!!!  Nice to nail a PB like that, especially from shore....must've been one heck of a fight"
