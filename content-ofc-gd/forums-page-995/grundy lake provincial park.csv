227710,Rybren,2008-07-15 01:46:00,28,"Haven't fished there since the early 70's!  Back in the day, it was 1. jump in the boat 2. cast out 3. reel in fish  I'm sure that it has slowed down since then.  Unfortunately, I don't remember much else."
227733,solopaddler,2008-07-15 02:40:00,8605,There's more than 3 lakes. I fished the park a few times myself many moons ago. Pakeshag always produced best for me...
227810,Victor,2008-07-15 11:35:00,1609,"i was at that PP last year and fished the main lake from a canoe. I didn't venture too far away from my campground as I didn't have an electric motor and I was alone. From what I have gathered, the fishing has gone downhill compared to what it was like before. I ended up with 2 hammerhandles and I hooked into a good sized pike (I'd say at least 30"") which spat the hook after like a 20 second fight."

228581,Jason B,2008-07-16 20:39:00,15,Fishing sucked there.  Couple really small bass. It was alright across the road at another small lake but i'll never be going close to that place again.
