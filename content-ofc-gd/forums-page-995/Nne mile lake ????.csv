Also if anyone knows of a good camping spot on there that would be a bonus as we may camp for one night.    THANKS"

It is a long skinny lake that i have snowmobiled on, I am thing it could hold some big bass if the long channel is the right depth  http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=muskoka%20nin...sa=N&tab=wl"
