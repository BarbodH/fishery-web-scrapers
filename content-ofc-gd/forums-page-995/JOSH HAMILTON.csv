228145,misfish,2008-07-15 22:06:00,29133,His story is very overwhelming and one that never really gets told. What a great come back from the deep dark hole of drugs.  http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.as...53376&cat=6
228166,misfish,2008-07-15 22:40:00,29133,"More why it,s so moving.  http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2926447"
228172,Marko,2008-07-15 22:50:00,854,That was a show he put on last night!! If stories like that don't inspire people then i am not sure what will.
228175,JEREMY,2008-07-15 23:00:00,300,Very cool story indeed.Ihave never seen a guy that could hit a ball the way he did last night.
228178,misfish,2008-07-15 23:07:00,29133,"I have to say while watching the hrd,the more this guy smacked the ball and the story they were telling about him,it was very over whelming. I think his tat,s are very cool,but can understand why he would want them off. He should keep them as a reminder. Oh the the way the ol boy, Clay Counsil at the age of 71 pitched them in there,that was another great story in it,self."
228179,danc,2008-07-15 23:14:00,4677,"I watched the entire thing last night and was very moved by Josh's story, and his performance. Both very simply amazing."
228183,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-15 23:29:00,2585,very cool story indeed!  cheers!
228205,Sandbag,2008-07-16 00:34:00,533,"Wow....quite a story...thanks for posting Brian.  I'm not a big baseball fan, but it's tough not to pull for someone like that.  Cheers  Craig"
228229,bpsbassman,2008-07-16 01:29:00,941,Great story.  Thaks Brian. Sorry I missed last night.
228270,kickingfrog,2008-07-16 02:44:00,8333,"Sorry, here's the glass half empty side. Wonder what he would do if he hadn't been a drug addict and alcoholic? I don't really give a rat's butt about someone who ""had it all"" and sabotaged him/herself. How about the ones who didn't mess-up in the first place? I do not judge him anymore harshly than anyone else, but he (like ever body else) doesn't get a free pass from me either. Stay clean. Is it really that tough?"
228312,oxcowboy,2008-07-16 04:50:00,544,"living close to cincinatti ohio, i've always been a reds fan, but the day they traded him i said i would never watch them again, and havent so far this year.  i know the pitcher they got in the deal is good, but hamilton is an amazing player.  glad that he has got it straight now, and i hope he has a long great career.  crap happens, it's just what you do after it hits the fan that makes the man.   jason"
228346,Whopper,2008-07-16 11:24:00,2174,"Jason I was pretty tick off when they traded Josh myself, I would have like to seen him stay and the Reds shipped off a texan instead."
228460,fishing n autograph,2008-07-16 16:15:00,2540,How incredible would he have been if he'd been clean.....drafted in '99 would have been called up in '00 or '01 and would have dominated since..... good for him
228493,Marko,2008-07-16 17:32:00,854," You guys got Volquez in a trade and he has been incredible, guess the trade has worked out for both teams. Dusty is ruining them this year, bringing up all washed up cubs players that played for him when he was here."
228496,Whopper,2008-07-16 17:38:00,2174," Easy Marko that's his son-in-law your talking about  Your right about Volquez, I just thought the same deal could have been made with our left fielder instead"
228499,Marko,2008-07-16 17:46:00,854, Haha. I am a big cub fan and i follow all the teams in division prety closely. Reds need to get rid of Griffey and maybe even Dunn and start rebuilding. it would be great if they could get some half decent young tallent for those two but i dont really see anybody biting on Griffey. he has struggled a lot this year and his defence is still prety good but not as good as it once was.
228503,misfish,2008-07-16 17:54:00,29133," I take it you have not been down that road,and YES,IT IS. This is why his and anyother addiction recovery story hit close to many.  ONE DAY AT A TIME."
228516,Musky or Specks,2008-07-16 18:31:00,2710,I guess I'm a cynic but do you think that a guy who stuck needles in his arm for fun wouldn't be adverse to sticking a needle in himself for a contract? He might be clean of the horse but anyone who can hit that many homeruns is not clean of everything.
228525,TennesseeGuy,2008-07-16 19:01:00,957,"I made the trip to Cinncinnati several times in 2007, mostly to see Josh perform.  He produced, but lost much of the season due to injuries.  Josh and his mother were in a serious automobile accident and his drug addiction came on the heels of the accident and recovery.  Bad deal.  He became a bum.  Now he's tested often and is not juiced.  The ball went long because he's strong, he has good timing and the ball might be juiced.  Whopper, no way anybody would give up a Volquez for a #44.  Yeah Marko, I'm sure you like seeing Junior's glove in right field and his warning track power at the plate in the number 3 spot when your Cubbies play my Reds.   Griffey has been a great one, but not now.  Hairston yes, Patterson NO.  I've seen the Reds play 14 games this season.  Volquez has been great.  I miss Josh Hamilton.  We watched more of the All-Star pre-game and game last night than usual because of Volquez and Hamilton."
