228594,Roy,2008-07-16 21:06:00,13728,"Well, it's too bad that it happened  and yes it could have been a catastrophic outcome but we all know that the dude had passed his online boat operator's competency card so, nothing bad could have happened anyway right? Just one more way our government looks out for us."
228607,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-16 21:35:00,2585,i know what goes around comes around i just hope when he gets it nobody else gets hurt.  what an ass
228655,Greencoachdog,2008-07-16 23:33:00,8163," Yes, it too bad a vessel operators and drivers license dosn't make a sensible person... but it does ensure that they either knew or should've known beter.  If the water Cops had seen that he would've gotten a ticket!"
228479,Whopper,2008-07-16 17:01:00,2174,"I agree with Joey on this one, you showed a lot of restraint. I'm not so sure I would have been able to the same.  A few years back on another popular lake in Ontario I had been fishing a point of an island three straight evenings and had something very similar happen by the same jerk all three nights. I had my son with me all three times and he even said to me the second time it happen how dangerous it was, well the third night and the third time the guy came through I lost it and went after him, my boat was a lot bigger than his and a lot faster so when I caught up to him I ran circles around him until he stopped and proceeded to have a talk with him. He informed me that he had every right to run his boat where ever he wanted that I shouldn't have been there in the first place (he was referring to me as a non citizen). Well I could clearly see this guy was a complete idiot and away I went. The next couple of days I went out of my way to make passes (in a safe distance) near where he sat while he was fishing his favorite spot and each time I would just wave as I went past. I wasn't very proud of what I did in front of my son but I didn't like watching the guy hold onto his boat for dear life everytime I went by him.  What I don't understand on the West Arm is why people feel the need to run WOT under the 64 bridge, I've seen it multiple times each time I've been there and last year a guy came through there in about a 26' boat WOT with three us fishing the area, one of the people I believe was a relative of Uncle Bucks and I thought for sure the guy was going to either hit them or swamp their small boat. Is this not a no wake zone?"
228498,doubleheader,2008-07-16 17:43:00,497,"Well Whopper I saw a lot of that near the bridge also as well as some guy pulling his kids on a tube and then doing a u turn right in front of Lakair's dock and almost pasting his kids into the dock.  I know here in PA we have the same type issues; lack of common courtesy, showboating, and a failure to recognize that you need to leave room for the unexpected. People do dumb stuff so you can't expect to be safe unless you are ready for the unexpected, and I wasn't the day we were nearly tea-boned. Safety around the water is so important. Over the weekend two young men from Pittsburgh decided to jump off the top of one of our bridges that spans our Allegheny reservoir. It's 75 feet to the water. One boy got hurt and when his brother went to rescue him they both drowned. What a shame."
228502,Andy,2008-07-16 17:51:00,330,"Wow, I'd be wild! The two closest calls I've had have both been on the West Arm, in Warren's Bay, but nothing nearly that scary. My boat and another boat travelling at about 90 degrees, I clearly have the right of way, but it's obvious that the other guy has no intention of slowing down and I literally have to come off plane and go at a snail's pace because I'm not even sure if the other guy sees me. In both instances, the other guy goes by full throttle and give me a look like I have a problem. One guy was on old man with a young child sitting high in the bow. They have no clue what they are doing out there, stories like yours remind me to remain vigilant. Andy"
228504,Joey,2008-07-16 17:55:00,9122,"That is terrible news about the boys.  Life can be over in an instant.  The reason I put that I would chase him down is that this hits home for me.  Paul and I were up bright and early one morning a few years ago on Simcoe, by Snake Island, he was standing on the front casting deck and I was sitting in the driver seat of the boat jigging off the side.  I suddenly see out of the corner of my eye Paul beeline it to the other side of the casting deck and the front of a boat about 5 feet from us going fast about to t-bone the middle of the passenger side of our boat.  There was no time for words, no honey look out, no duck, no jump, no grabbing of lifejackets.  By the grace of God, this guy sees us at the last second and cranks his wheel to the right.  He was so close and turned so fast his wake soaked us to the bone and everything in our boat.  We stood there dripping and looking at each other in disbelief.  The guy stops his boat and is slowly drifting away from us about 20 ft away and says ""Sorry.""  Paul yells back, ""Sorry?  Sorry?  Sorry doesn't cut it buddy.""  We gained our composure a bit and Paul asked him what he was thinking and a few other choice words.  The guy just took off.  We didn't chase him as we had already said our peace and he knew he was wrong and said sorry.  But that really scared me and I'm forever more aware of boats heading in  our direction.  I don't know if he just wasn't paying attention or if the sun coming up over the horizon blinded him.  Joey"
228512,modny,2008-07-16 18:19:00,502,  exactly. i'm not usually one to say this type of  stuff either.  it will come back to bite him in the arse one day.
228524,POLLIWOGG,2008-07-16 18:57:00,835,"Ahh......Anybody think to call the cops, thats why we have them?  If it was intentional he will do it again and the sooner you get the cops involved the better."
228527,Andy,2008-07-16 19:19:00,330,"A good point. Dangerous Driving is not just for cars on the highway, it also applies to vessels, boats, sleds, etc.  I  imagine a criminal charge would slow him down. Andy"
228539,doubleheader,2008-07-16 19:31:00,497,I did not contact the OPP and I should have. I had my eye out for one of their patrol boats for 2 weeks with the thought I'd flag them down and never saw one.  In retrospect that was a bad approach I should have contacted them that day because I had witnesses and they were also staying at Lakair.
228540,GBW,2008-07-16 19:34:00,8460,my comment on the camera was because I thought you said you had seen the boat a few more times after that.  I know that a camera would be the last thing I would be looking for if that was happening to me.
228551,Greencoachdog,2008-07-16 19:46:00,8163, ... same here.   If he blows by me like that in Sept. ... I'll be sure to await his return!
228556,glen,2008-07-16 20:01:00,2641,People like to giver when they are in the channel and you are nearby.  They wont be happy till they kill someone.  What about the speed limit close to shore?
