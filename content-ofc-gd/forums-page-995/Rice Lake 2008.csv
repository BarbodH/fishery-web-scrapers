The week started off with a bang Saturday night and didnt stop until Friday night.  I could talk about this trip for hours so i will try and make it quick.  Saturday night Dad and I went out for our first time bass fishing of 2008.  I got the first bass boated in ""Misty"" for 2008.    The next day i didnt get out fishing until the night and didnt get any bass but i got a PB crappie caught on my super ultralight ice fishing rod  :thumbsup: It was 10"" which went good in the frying pan.    Monday... I know I will remember this day for a very long time.  I had my PB day for bass catching 9 bass 8 of witch were caught in a 3 hour period...  First drift, brought me 4 bass...          Next two drifts brought me no fish so Dad asked ""should we start our drift a little further down"".  ""Yeah sure"". First cast DAD I GOT ONE...   NEXT CAST...   TWO CASTS LATER...   That is no fish story i caught 3 bass on 4 casts.  About 10 minutes later i got this little guy...   Now to this point I had already beaten my best bass day by about 5.  Night comes around the whole family goes out again for another night of still fishing. Night was slow so i started casting a little spinner bait and i got this little guy. (Mom was 2 feet away when this pic was taken so thats why the fish looks so big    )     Today is Tuesday, I went out in the morning and i noticed the reel i caught the bass on yesterday (monday) was not working as it should be i brought it back to shore and it was broken... perfect thats all i need.  Guys if you have a wife, girlfriend or mom who is always saying you bring too many rods and reels use this as an example why you do   We went out in the afternoon not noticing the dark clouds... Well we couldnt have been out for more than 20 minutes, and it started to pore, so rain suits on and we moved closer to the cottage just in case it started to start to thunder and lightning.  It passed by quite fast so we moved back to our sweet spot and like usual it produced...    Dad got one and we tried  to get an action shot of him being released but we didnt jump    The night produced this nice bass for me...    Wednesday was a little slower as i only got 1 bass but it was a nice one, Dad was eating bananas in the boat every morning and it didn't seem to affect our fishing...    Thursday... again i wont be forgetting this day for a while for a good reason and a not so good one.  We go out in the afternoon like we did every day.  It was a odd wind today and we couldnt tell what way it was going to push us.  Anyways i decided to try some pitching, and while I was fishing I went to put my foot on the side of the boat to rest my foot.  As i did that we hit a wave and well over i went  So we went back in and I changed... After that it was an awesome bite for me... I got 5 bass this afternoon but only one was picture worthy...    Now this was a huge surprise to us... I hooked a fish and i got it to the boat and i was like thats not a bass... It was my PB and first ever none Nippissing walleye.  I had the ""JP Bushey"" hold on this one  :thumbsup:    Friday the good fishing for me started at night.  I caught a bunch of perch and then i pulled in the guy...    She was my new PB perch who was 12"" long!  In the end I won the bass tourney 18 - 15 :thumbsup: Out of 35 bass all were released but 2 as they were hooked in the gills and we would rather us eat them than the sea gulls.  Overall a great week. We were able to get out everyday, and for once the weather didn't scare us off the water.  Fishing was great, food was good, and got to spend time with family, what more can you ask for? Lets just hope Nippissing next month will be the same... just with more toothy critters  :thumbsup:  Thanks for reading, Corey"
