228543,charlesn,2008-07-16 19:39:00,551,Should be okay with a 16'er.  I've launched 20' bassboats there and don't recall needing 4wd to get out.  You do have to back in a little deeper than usual since you can't powerload and dry winching a 3500 lb boat is tough!  Charles

228578,misfish,2008-07-16 20:24:00,29133,Thanks Oh you mean Charles. Sorry.
228773,jediangler,2008-07-17 03:50:00,1923,"You should have no problem launching a 16'er at their ramp. It is a ""No Gas Motors"" lake, but you probably already knew that"
228831,babaganoush,2008-07-17 11:35:00,105,"thanks for the heads up jedi. i had no idea as ive seen lots of bass boats in there while driving by so i assumed gas motors were allowed. i guess orangeville is out, what about belwood???"
228915,Reef Runner,2008-07-17 14:33:00,980,I have no info on the lake but just wanted to second on the cool avitar.  Best I've seen yet. It's hillarious
