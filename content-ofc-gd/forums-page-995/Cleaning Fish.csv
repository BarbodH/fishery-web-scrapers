228557,danbo,2008-07-16 20:01:00,2646,"Speaking of cleaning trout.. I was fishing on the Pine River back in my late teens. As I knelt beside the river cleaning my limit of Brookies, another pair of guys showed up..drunk! Anyway, the real silly one says ""Let me show ya how we clean 'em the down-East way."" He picked up a 10""er, bit the head off & spit it across the river, shoved his finger in the guts & ripped it to its butt!! We laughed like kids over that one! Who needs a knife?"

228640,kickingfrog,2008-07-16 22:55:00,8333,This little snap-shot of your childhood explains sooo much Danbo.
228641,danbo,2008-07-16 22:57:00,2646,Those were the days my friends..
228678,JohnF,2008-07-17 00:29:00,3494, Didn't Ozzy Osborne get paid to do that? or was that some other music weirdo?  JF
228681,JohnF,2008-07-17 00:31:00,3494, Not called fugu for nothin'.  JF
228689,misfish,2008-07-17 00:56:00,29133," Hey, you watch yer tounge there sir. No swearing on this board"
228701,JohnF,2008-07-17 01:23:00,3494, Fugu too.
228703,Marko,2008-07-17 01:24:00,854, Ozzy bit a head of a dove and spat it out lol. He was in a studio when he did it so i dont think he got paid for it.
228706,danbo,2008-07-17 01:27:00,2646,It was a bat!  http://www.usfestivals.com/performers/ozzy.jpg
228709,JohnF,2008-07-17 01:33:00,3494, Yuck. That's like biting the head off a catfish.  JF
228710,Marko,2008-07-17 01:36:00,854," Catfish has no hair on its head, bat does ewwwww."
228713,misfish,2008-07-17 01:39:00,29133," Fine,if yer going to be that way,Im taking my sand box toys and going home. Have a nice night."
228714,JohnF,2008-07-17 01:40:00,3494," I'd rather hold a bat than a catfish. In fact, we used to catch little bats at recess in public school, sneak 'em back into class, then let them go. Really freaked out the girls, and the teacher. We got a few detentions but hey, that's the price of fun.  JF"
228784,preroller,2008-07-17 05:05:00,18,Ozzy thought it was a fake bat though...he went to the hospital right after he realized it was real.  SHARRRON!
228785,danbo,2008-07-17 05:10:00,2646,Hey preroller..is that nickname what I think it is?
