228724,sharper,2008-07-17 02:04:00,279,"So my friend and I decided to fish scugog today. We only fished for a few hours but it was non stop action, filled with a few bass and tons of panfish. One of the bass I caught was on a surface lure, it was exciting it see the bass come up and take the lure.  "

228771,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-17 03:43:00,0,Yup! I think I caught my first Largie on Scugog on a topwater! Really exciting! Thanks for sharing.
228780,sharper,2008-07-17 04:27:00,279,With all the weed and pads there I figure topwater was the way to go.
228823,Victor,2008-07-17 11:12:00,1609,Nice fish buddy.  Aren't you gonna try getting your pike?
228871,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-17 13:20:00,3761,The first largemouth bass i got out of scugog was topwater also. Thanks for sharing!

228939,Leecher,2008-07-17 15:33:00,7832,Looks like you guys had fun with non stop action.  Catching bass on surface is so cool.  Thanks for sharing Leetchman
