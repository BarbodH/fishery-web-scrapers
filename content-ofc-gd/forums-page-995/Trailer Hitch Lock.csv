63554,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-23 03:25:00,212,Do you guys tow with the Trailer hitch lock?  Looks flimsy compared to the draw bar and pin.  Here is a picture of the one i purchased. 
63556,bigfish1965,2007-04-23 03:31:00,3382,I have a combo pack from Master Lock. Hitch and trailer lock. No issues so far. I think if they really want my boat and hitch they will get it somehow.
63561,Dondorfish,2007-04-23 03:41:00,1000,yup - I use that type on the trailer as well as on the hitch bar. I also use this one when the trailer is not hooked up to the truck:       Bought all 3 as a set - use the same key - really handy   Don
63612,mikemo,2007-04-23 11:50:00,27,I use the same one.  Like Rick said I doubt if it'll stop thieves.  It'll protect you from tampering and bored kids at the launch sites.
63614,Mike the Pike,2007-04-23 11:56:00,3421,Thats the one I use I always it keeps the hitch locked.I have another lock for the trailer which hooks to the latch there is no space to cut the lock.  MTP
63699,Weedman,2007-04-23 14:54:00,32,"And perhaps most importantly about the hitch locks.....if you are not using one and your boat gets stolen, most marine insurance underwriters will not pay out.  Check the fine print of your policy....it's front and center on mine.  I'm insured with ELCO....I use the Master Lock kit combo too, although I think I'm gonna invest in the stainless version next go 'round.  Tight lines....."
63714,bigfish1965,2007-04-23 15:31:00,3382,"Second the stainless idea. Mine is rusting quite a bit, so stainless the next time around."
63785,mdej,2007-04-23 18:17:00,98,I have the master lock combo kit as well.  I have used the lock you purchased for 2 years no issues thus far.
63791,SlowPoke,2007-04-23 18:29:00,2984,"Throw a handfull of roadsalt in your reciever, mist some water in there and you won't need a lock. I should invest in a lock system and I like the single key idea. -Brian"
63796,Zib,2007-04-23 18:36:00,369, I have the same lock set & no problems on my end either.
63823,nel,2007-04-23 19:44:00,52,"I don't want to hijack the thread, but where do you get this ""all mighty"" combo lock kit?  For future reference when I need it..."
63857,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-23 21:20:00,0,"I have that lock for the hitch as well as the skinny one for the coupler. Well it malfunctioned on me last year in Belle river and I took out my trusty Can-Tire tool kit and with that little saw in there I was able to cut through it in seconds.  LOL  I think the hitch one been thicker and under the hitch makes it a lot safer but the other one was a joke to cut.  I used a very large chain to tie trailler and hitch together last fall, it worked fine but had to take it off during travelling."
64007,irishfield,2007-04-24 02:50:00,26272,Was just going thru the Tri-Ad..and one place for the master lock coupler lock is JDJ Trailer MFG's in Millgrove. 1056 Hwy#6 905-689-7100 1-800-465-0786
64009,Dondorfish,2007-04-24 02:55:00,1000,"I bought my 3 piece set at CTC for, I believe, $89.99  Don"
64060,Randy,2007-04-24 11:40:00,115,I have this one  Fulton Hitch Lock
64091,Fishn Technishn,2007-04-24 13:36:00,198,Costco has the MASTER LOCK 3 piece combo with a plastic case for $50.... cheap insurance that it will still be there when you get set to go.  FT

228679,spooner_jr,2008-07-17 00:30:00,193," If it's gone, how do they know whether you had one or not?"
228680,Fisherman,2008-07-17 00:30:00,7201,"Good idea but check where the product comes from, a lot if not most of the far east products use real cheap quality stainless that will rust after a short time exposed to the elements.  Bring along a small magnet, if it sticks, it's junk.  Real stainless is not magnetic."
