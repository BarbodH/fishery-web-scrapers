Fishing was very tough today...but after driving for 2 hours at this price of gas had little other choice but to push as hard as I could. So we did...Maybe it is a bit early still??? Maybe we were in the wrong area or at the wrong time? Just wasn't the fishing I know Erie for. Oh well...hope when I come next time we do better to cover for today too ;-) Here are few shots:      All fish came deep over 100 fow, 45-60 feet down, on dark colors spoons, 2.4mph, two on the rigger and two on the leadcore.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
