Fishing wasn't to bad,  I managed to get a 5 pound 19 inch Largie throwing a spinner bait along a matt of grass.      Wasn't quite big enough to make it on the board for Team 7 but it's my personal best. Girlfriends dad was impressed and has decided to get it mounted  We tried to get out last weekend again and got rear ended by another vehicle on the way The prop broke and had to wait for the insurance company so the boat had to go back. We were all packed so we decided to still go do a little shore fishing anyways. Got a couple small bass and ended up catching a small musky and loosing two others    but was still ended up being a good day. Heres the Musky.  "
