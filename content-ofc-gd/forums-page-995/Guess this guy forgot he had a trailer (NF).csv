228896,Joey,2008-07-17 13:57:00,9122,A friend of mine sent me this yesterday.  I'm not even sure if the guy lived.  I keep watching to see if he might have somehow not been crushed.  Make sure you know your heights when towing  Forgot he was towing?  Joey
228901,richyb,2008-07-17 14:02:00,774,Oh man and i was thinking of having pancakes thismorning ... Im pretty sure that guy resembles one pretty good !@!!!
228904,Fishmaster,2008-07-17 14:08:00,920,I don't think anyone survied that ...WOW
228914,Headhunter,2008-07-17 14:32:00,5703,"Oh my! One the down side, I think he is going to be late for his next appointment... on the bright side, just think about how much money he saved by not having to fill up! HH"
228919,Smokey,2008-07-17 14:42:00,1278,"He was so lucky that missed the truck and just caught the edge of the mirror. It would have squished him for sure. It's been all over the news for the last week, bet he will never forget that day."
228928,johnnyb,2008-07-17 15:11:00,3413,"I remember posting that last week....but now that I watch it again, it's amazing that nobody else was under there!"
228960,Canuck2fan,2008-07-17 16:31:00,1444,"I see the potential for two commercials from this one....  1) we build tough trucks and/or trailers.... (for all the obvious reasons)  2) we represent clients who had have shoddy contracting work done, we get results and make the contractors responsible for building junk like this pay through the nose.  That ""structure"" folded faster than me with a deuce seven in hold'em."
228966,Joey,2008-07-17 16:54:00,9122," Sorry Johnnyb, I missed that.  So he did live then?  Joey"
229014,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-17 18:08:00,2585,yeah i heard about it on the radio nobody died but what a mess he hardly ran into it.  a strong wind would have toppled that thing too lol  scary stuff though  cheers!
229127,johnnyb,2008-07-17 22:08:00,3413,"  I never heard for sure, as there is currently no tv at home, but, no, I don't think anyone died.  Crazy footage though!"
