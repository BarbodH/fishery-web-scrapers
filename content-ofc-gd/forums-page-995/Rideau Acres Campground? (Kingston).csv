228534,Woodsman,2008-07-16 19:29:00,1286,I will be staying at the campground 1-3 Aug. to attend my military regiments 125th reunion. Has anyone stayed here before & what was it like. How is the shore/wading fishing there? I should be able to get out in the mornings for a couple hours.  Best Wishes: Rick
