228276,jimca11,2008-07-16 02:56:00,34,I am planning a camping trip with my 2 boys (12 and 8) and was looking at Emily as it is fairly close and on the Pigeon river and lake. I expect the fishing to be decent but can't find much actual info on the park itself. If anyone has camped there I would be grateful for any insight on the sites. We will be tenting.  Thanks  Jim

Hope to see some pictures next week!"
