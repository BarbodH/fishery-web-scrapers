228358,MuskieWannabe,2008-07-16 12:20:00,79,"Hey there all,  I live in Ottawa and am heading to Toronto in the next couple of weeks and was wondering if anyone knew if JB's carried musky nets?  The only places around that I know for sure would be Pro Tackle Musky, but I'm not even sure yet if they actually keep them in stock.  Just wondering if anyone had any insight as to if anyone around carried some muskie nets?  I think I'm looking between the Frabill Big Game, the Big Kahuna, and one of the Beckman muskie nets.  I've used them all and all are pretty sweet, but I'd liek to keep it well under the $200 as much as possible.  Cheers,  MuskieWannabe"
228361,silveradosheriff,2008-07-16 12:29:00,1025,"Yes, they have a good selection of Musky nets.  Not so sure about keeping it well under the $200 though....."
228369,muskymike,2008-07-16 12:49:00,772,"Your average price for a Large Frabill or Beckman is going to run you $135-190 no matter where you go. Depending on how big you want to go.  JB's has a bunch right now. If they dont have what you want, call up Stacey at Pro Tackle in Corbyville, he also carries them.  But JB's should be able to get you what you are looking for.   Plan on spending $150 for sure though."

228410,MuskieWannabe,2008-07-16 14:07:00,79,"I am figuring aruond the $150 range, but just don't want one that be around $179.99 and tack the tax on it and end up over $200.  Hopefully they will still have some in stock towards the end of the month!  Thanks"
228472,Meely,2008-07-16 16:47:00,282,I was just in there last week searching for a net. The fella mentioned he does not carry FrabrilL anymore and had to order me a Beckman. He stated it would take about 2 weeks for it to come in. Price was approx $180. I'd call ahead..........  Oh yeah...they were also clearing out some of their Leo Musky lures. Clearance prices cant be beat.....some are less than half the regular price.   Meely
