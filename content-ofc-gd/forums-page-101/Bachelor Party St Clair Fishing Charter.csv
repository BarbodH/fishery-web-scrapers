The only guidance the unlucky fellow has provided is that it must involve fishing!  Almost all of the men in attendance are serious fisherman and we are less interested in partying (during the day at least)  and more interested in spending some quality time on the water. There is a total of 6-7 men and I thought it would be a great idea to book a charter on Lake St Clair to chase some muskies.  A quick google search revealed a few charter options but it seems most of them are on the states side. I could use some help if anyone can recommend a charter company based on the Ontario side that may be able to accommodate us?  Any recommendations are welcome.  Thanks in advance,"
