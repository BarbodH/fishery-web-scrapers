994938,mike rousseau,2017-02-20 22:55:00,4661,Good day  So as we all have a bit of cabin fever the family decided to make a bit of maple syrup  Looked and found that home hardware sells a 5 pail kit with taps and lids for $40... For $40 I figure it's about the same as going to the movies so if we have some outdoor fun and get a few litres of syrup it'll be money well spent  So we got the kit and tapped some trees at our cottage  We put 2 pails on the biggest maple and single pails on 3 other smaller maples... all the smaller trees were running fast enough right away but the big maple didn't give up a drop... I'm going to go check Wednesday to see how things are flowing and relocate pails if they aren't producing... cause if that big maple doesn't produce that's 40% of my production lol  I'm not even sure what kind of maples they are... if I understand right it doesn't matter what kind of maple but anything other than sugar maple requires more sap to get a litre of syrup... 40:1 sugar maple and 60:1 other maples  Anyone have any tips?  I've been told not to add to much sap to the pot at a time cause you dont wanna lose your boil  If I get a litre every Sunday when we boil I'll be pretty happy with that  Thanks  Mike

994956,mike rousseau,2017-02-21 00:33:00,4661,After doing some research I believe we tapped silver maples  Gunna go down tomorrow and see if I can find any sugar maples (now that I know what I'm looking for)
994974,Rod Caster,2017-02-21 12:30:00,5784,"Don't tap silver maples haha. That's a funny, and probably easy mistake to make when you first start.  Red (soft) or Sugar (hard) both produce good. The hard is hands-down better, but the reds still produce. You'll see the tips (buds)  of the 'Reds' turn a fairly bright red this time or year.  I noticed that my smaller trees produced earlier than most big ones.  Your tree-wells look good for tapping (the ring of melt around the truck base). We still have 3-4 feet of snow, I have another month before I setup my equipment.  Have fun and good luck! I love doing syrup."
994979,Acountdeleted,2017-02-21 13:24:00,2562,Oh man. This has me wondering. I wonder if I could tap the trees at my parents cottage?  My mouth is watering over this already.
994990,Sinker,2017-02-21 14:07:00,8692,"Generally, the bigger trees take longer to start flowing, but will produce more sap once they thaw enough to flow.  S."
995100,Cast-Away,2017-02-22 02:24:00,790,"Hey Mike, maybe some silver will flow out of the tree and you will be rich!"
995121,dave524,2017-02-22 10:36:00,4508,"You can tap Silver Maple if that is what you have, also Red Maple or Box Elder/Manitoba Maple, you can even tap Yellow Birch, but the ratio of sap to syrup would be poorer."
995123,Rod Caster,2017-02-22 12:41:00,5784,"yellow birch flows like crazy, just after the end of maple syrup season. The boil ratio is closer to 60:1, but the volume of sap coming out of that tree is surprisingly high."
995354,mike rousseau,2017-02-24 00:58:00,4661,Got 2 gallons of sap today  Also located 1 sugar maple on our property  It's not really running yet tho but I can taste the difference in the sap
995391,Sinker,2017-02-24 14:24:00,8692,"Yeah, silvers will run a bit earlier than sugar maples, but they also stop flowing before sugars. You will notice a big difference in the syrup between the two, thats for sure.  S."
995556,mike rousseau,2017-02-26 17:55:00,4661,This weeks syrup haul  It aint much but its good and my kids learnt a bit about putting in time and effort to get results  Hopefully the trees run more this week  
995557,mike rousseau,2017-02-26 17:57:00,4661,Also about 60:1 or 70:1  I didn't measure what I had going in
995565,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-26 18:47:00,10439,Too bad you can't get it out of black spruce or I would have it made!!!!!
995567,SirCranksalot,2017-02-26 19:12:00,3291," Anyone have any tips?   Mike    Yeah, have lots of firewood!!!"
