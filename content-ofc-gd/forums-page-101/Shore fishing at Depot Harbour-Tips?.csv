The Good,Bad, best time of year, what you have to do to fish there? We were at Parry Sound for a night and was yakking with hotel owner- looking at things I might be able to get my wife to do with me fishing wise if it is not an all day adventure.This would not be during the ice season!! Thanks Kerry"
