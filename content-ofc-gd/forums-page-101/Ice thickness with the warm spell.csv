The good news is that the forecast calls for COLD weather until mid-March.  Somewhat related, I read this today: https://www.baytoday.ca/local-news/police-warning-of-open-water-in-callander-bay-546885  Supposedly someone went ""through the ice"". I think they just busted the top layer and nothing more. Especially in that area... it's solid ice everywhere, unless I'm mistaken."

Sunday looks like it will be a skating rink. Cold coming and lets hope no snow. Firm it up for another couple of weeks."

Won't be long before the pike start spawning in that marsh.  I haven't checked my carping marsh yet, but it's even shallower... probably be ice free there fairly soon if not already.  But the upcoming couple of weeks is going to drop back down, especially north of the GTA. Ice should be nice and solid for a little while longer."

A few groups on the golf course outside Cayuga the other day, it was 16C. FEBRUARY!!! Cold today +4 (cold is relative), +13 this Wednesday. I do have empathy for you hard water guys. Just be careful please. I don't think anyone has any real experience with this thaw, freeze repeat at such high thaw temperatures. I wonder what the science tells us about how it would effect the ice? It isn't normal."

I'm 160lb, and the ice was flexing under my feet on the way back in. 6"" of good ice where I was fishing, but sketchy on the way out and sketchy on the way in. Don't assume anything right now, because there are huge differences between various access points around Simcoe."

994993,Terry,2017-02-21 14:13:00,14456,My only concerns would be near rivers and water outlets. Plus right at shore. Otherwise I think it should be fine

I figure a morning on my favorite body of water North of Barrie followed by an afternoon on Simcoe should cure what ails me.  Slush will be easy to navigate through. I just need to wax my smitty.

What I use every spring to determine if it is safe ""FOR ME"" is the shovel test in my veggie garden here in Oshawa. I have found frost in the ground to be a real good indicator of how the last ice is holding up. No frost at shovel depth and I'm done for the year for the spots I fish. Tested just 10 minutes ago...still some frost at the full depth of the shovel...which means it will be gone before dark today and LONG gone after our 2 days of rain. So I'm done until we get some cold weather.  When I do this I have an American friend I perch fish with who still comes up and sneaks out to our spots on foot...but I'm not with him.  He usually kills them on these last ice trips too and gives me the gears for hiding at home. But I'm OK with that.  BTW I have never ever done the shovel test in February before so I am hoping for a refreeze to get out some more.  If you go for gods sake take all the safety precautions you can."
