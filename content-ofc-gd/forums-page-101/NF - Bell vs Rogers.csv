A Sat range finder is about $40 for a basic one at The Source and it helps you lock in on the signal during set up.  My father has one for his 5th wheel camper and Sat TV dish on a tripod.  There are no installers for Bell or Shaw in Nunavut yet both companies still have customers there.  I joke when I get a call from there, ""so I cannot sell you Non-of-it as there is not tech's"" to help BUT I do tell all callers how to go about getting some form of TV from either company."

An oscilloscope is needed to correctly aim them. This summer the Bell dish gets installed @ the cabin."
995278,RandyLinden,2017-02-23 14:08:00,40,"I also will add my dissatisfaction with Bell Arrogant service reps. Technicians that are openly and obviously unhappy and annoyed that they are actually expected to do some work. Service requests that are directed to off shore call centers that employ people that can barely speak English and are not capable of handling even a simple request, wait times and being put on hold for ridiculous time periods while trying to get answers and solutions from who knows how many levels of supervisors and so called managers...Sadly in many instances not only are they not interested in correcting any problems they actually deny that there is a problem and do not care if their services work or not so long as they get paid. Plus Bell is probably among others that treat their existing customers like they are not even worth talking to anymore after they get your business. Offering new customers deals and promotions and never rewarding their long time customers with anything but an arrogant and rude attitude is the sad state that Bell is in today. When they had a monopoly on phone services they actually provided the best phone services in the world. Then the government came along and forced in competition and the sharing of Bell's infrastructure. Now look at the crap we have ..."

The outcome for me? When this two years is up, I'm going to take the advise of my adult sons and dump the whole system once and for all.

995321,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-23 20:38:00,8243,I would just be crushed if I switch over and the picture isn't as good. I will go to the Shaw site and see what quality it comes in at. Bell is supposed to be 1080p.  edit: I went to the Shaw site and built the package we have with Bell now. It comes in almost to the dollar what we pay for Bell now. The only difference is I would have to get a second receiver and would not get the promo being offered which is a free DVR which I think is for a limited time only. The rep on the phone said HBO was available but I don't see it in any of their packages.  I will stay with Bell for now.
995328,John Bacon,2017-02-23 21:44:00,3277,"I will stay with Bell for now.  If you tell them that you are thinking of switching, they may offer you some incentives.  Unfortunately, that seems to be the only way to get a deal from either Bell or Rogers."

994985,Acountdeleted,2017-02-21 13:44:00,2562,"I'll never go with Bell ever again.  Rogers: Twice I racked up a massive phone bill. One was my fault, one was not. They removed both of the massive charges for free (saved me about $800 in total)  Bell: Years ago I got a rocket internet stick with them when I lived in Wheatley. I canceled it after my contract was up. Around Christmas (3 months after cancelling I noticed they were still charging me for it). I went in and told them, they said the phone number for the stick had been canceled but I was still being charged so they couldn't cancel the account. 2 hours later on the phone I finally find someone who knows what they are doing.  Them: Ok. Your rocket stick has been canceled. Thank you for choosing Bell. Me: and you are going to re-emburse me for the past 3 months I paid for. Correct? Them: Oh......... oh oh. Of course. One moment. (They weren't going to if I didn't press the issue).  Customer service goes a long way for me."

995030,Musky Plug,2017-02-21 18:39:00,398,"I too have had bad experiences with bell in regards with the billing. They only offer you incentives to sign up and once the incentive program runs out they hit you with all these charges they neglect to tell you about in the beginning. They raised my rateswithout even notifying me. Even with phone/internet/tv package I still pay around the 250, which is more then I payed when I was with them when I had a satellite. Switch to fibe they told me will be cheaper, cheaper my but. And when you call customer service they give you the same song and dance over and over. In the process now ironing things out with cogeco to get a better monthly rate. Was speaking with someone at work last week about this and he says he just switches between companies when his incentives run out.  Sorry about the rant, just thinking about speaking to their customer service fires me up."
995033,crappieperchhunter,2017-02-21 19:09:00,2582,We have switched back and forth several times over the years. And both companies are aware that when they don't give us a good deal we will simply go to the competition. The result is we have cable/phone/internet for way cheaper then we where paying 8-10 years ago with a far better package too.  I will have to respectfully disagree with Bells poorer service. That has not been our experience anyway. The last time we left Rogers was mostly because of the crappy service they provided us. Bell on the other hand has been rock solid once they knew they couldn't rape us with high prices anymore.  Good luck with whatever you choose. If you switch back and forth a few times like we did I think they will lower there prices and up there games to keep you happy. That has been our experience anyway.

I have a Wightmans Telecom crew installing fibre in my place today.  We will see what they are all about, at least when I call customer service with them I'm just calling up the road to Clifford, ON and all the customer service reps are local, and I can understand them perfectly well.  I have found that loyalty hasn't benefited me at all with these service providers.  I was with Rogers for 20 years and paid my bill on time all the time.  They still treated me like a new customer and they lost all my business over failing to match virgin mobile at the time to the tune of $5."

Never really had any issues with them.  then switched to cogeco when we moved to Halton and their service was ok but not as good as Rogers.  Cogeco's customer service reps we not very professional in the way they would deal with issues and were always felt like they were in a rush to get you off the phone.  I am now with Bell due to my displeasure with Cogeco and so far its been good. I only switched because I use their cell services and they gave a super good deal on internet and tv.  Time will tell.
995095,lookinforwalleye,2017-02-22 01:41:00,4399,IMHO they both suck...the both do not know the meaning of customer service...I am with Start....www.start.ca....these guys know customer service...
995102,GBW,2017-02-22 02:32:00,8460,"As most of you know I work on the sales team for one.  We MUST and ALWAYS have told customers what the regular rate is and what the promo rate is and when it ends.  It's also printed on each and every bill so you know what's going to happen.  When the CRTC makes changes the providers have to change also and this is where the rates change.  The company I work for sends out 60 day and 30 notifications on the bills so you see it coming if there is a rate change. TV, one is 1080p all others are 1080i (lower) Internet, DSL so yes not a shared line vs broadband meaning shared connection HP, copper line vs VOIP (internet based phone) So the 2 companies is question here do NOT stack up the same when you look at from a ""get what you pay for"" with technology."

The dish points S-W which is over the lake so unless you have a tree directly between where your dish is and the satellite you should get a perfect signal.
