996180,spincast,2017-03-04 17:48:00,3279,"cool. so, hook a release clip to the bottom, snap in your line and have to drone run it to that spot just too far to cast, or under that tree , give a tug on the line and plop. perfect placement every time."
996183,limeyangler,2017-03-04 18:12:00,5204,"Cool toy Simon. Hows she fly? Is it hard?  Not really, pretty basic, but you get get very complicated, jack is seven and he flew it today no props in beginner mode."
