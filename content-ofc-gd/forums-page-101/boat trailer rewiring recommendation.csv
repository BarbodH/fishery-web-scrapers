995902,GBW,2017-03-01 19:09:00,8460,Wouldn't it be more cost effective to get a whole new LED light kit with wires and run them yourself vs paying someone shop rates for the same solution?  Just a thought to where I'd start
995905,DanD,2017-03-01 19:38:00,2223,Princess Auto has everything you need to do the job yourself. They're running a special on the cabling that I would use. http://www.princessauto.com/en/detail/14-gauge-pvc-insulated-trailer-wire-ft/A-p4210625e  Dan.
995963,pics,2017-03-02 07:05:00,1268,Princess auto or Nando trailer on Rymal for the parts. If you don't want to do it yourself then I would go to Nando or Mohawk trailers...

995972,BassMan11,2017-03-02 12:41:00,583,I have re wired about 5 different trailers with princess auto kits without any issues. Very easy to do. Keep an eye on the princess flyer for when they come on sale. The most important part is to make sure you use good connectors and good heat shrink.  Submersible Low Profile LED Trailer Light Kit | Princess Auto  or  Submersible LED Trailer Light Kit | Princess Auto  Shouldn't cost you any more than $100 (very high side) and a couple hours of your time. I assume this would save you a few bucks and it is very straight forward.  Good Luck

The woman there told me ""We've never worked on a Ranger trailer, sorry."" I took it to a small independent garage in Stoney Creek and he did a great job. I still don't understand why they didn't want to do a simple line replacement."
995981,BassMan11,2017-03-02 13:42:00,583," SOLDER CONNECTIONS Agreed that is the ""best"" way. But not the easiest to do while under a boat and trailer.  I've not had a properly done crimp and glued heat shrink fail thus far.  Or even a couple of merretts with electrical tape would due just fine......"
995985,wkrp,2017-03-02 13:57:00,656,Go to an electronics store and buy good quality tinned wire.That stuff at your local shops deteriorates and shorts out in no time. Going on to 10 trouble free years for me.
995988,Sinker,2017-03-02 14:19:00,8692,"Good wire makes a huge difference. Not such a big deal on a boat trailer, but my snowmobile trailer wires take a beating with the salt. It doesn't take long for cheap wiring to be useless. Soldered and shrink wrapped connections wrapped in good ole electrical tape has been good to me so far.  S."
996010,msp,2017-03-02 16:21:00,1336,I agree with the Princess Auto option. I re did mine with LED submersibles. worked great and only took a couple hours

996018,Fisherman,2017-03-02 17:30:00,7201,"X2, solder and get shrink tube with the built in sealer."
996031,Sinker,2017-03-02 19:18:00,8692,"Yup, worste thing ever invented for joining wires. Toss them immediately!"
996033,myot,2017-03-02 19:29:00,131,I buy high quality wire and run it through a section of tygon tubing then fish it through the framing of the trailer. Solder all connections then use waterproof shrink tube over the connection. I know it sounds like overkill but I never have any problems with trailer lights  Dan
996035,moemoe,2017-03-02 19:51:00,352,"I did put led lights on last year and shrink tube/soldered connection, the power splits off mid trailer to supply clearance lights and it is a 5 wire plug instead of 4 wire going to the lock out on the surge brakes"

Under the boat in the driveway with a Weller solder gun is a piece of cake, now going back to the cottage years, dad would have me crawl in the narrow space under the cottage with the propane torch and replace burst copper pipe 24th of May when opening up for the season, laying on my back with molten solder dripping    Oh yes. in the porcupine poop and usually the blackflies were out too   . I still really miss that place"
996041,Sinker,2017-03-02 21:21:00,8692," You have a wire shorting out somewhere, and my bet is its one of those wires to the clearance lights. You can't find it unless you pull all the wires through the frame, so its just as easy to replace everything if your pulling it all out anyways.  S."
