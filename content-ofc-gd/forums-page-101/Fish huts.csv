995125,Shloim,2017-02-22 13:10:00,515,"So, tried ice fishing and loved it. So, now my question is which I'd better huts attached to sleds or stand alone huts? Not experienced with either...also has anyone fished KASHAGAWIGAMOG? Thinking of trying it? Thanks all in advance"
995130,Sinker,2017-02-22 13:31:00,8692,The flip over style huts are best imo....i have both and the pop up huts barely get used.  S.
995132,AKRISONER,2017-02-22 13:41:00,5558,"I also have both and will definitely say flip over huts are better but can be a pain in the ass if you are hauling them through tight rough trails.  The benefit though is that set up and tear down is literally 100000x better in a flip over. The difference of course being price. I just picked up a frabil pop up for 200 while a new clam two seater flip over is closer to a grand.  With the flip over you just throw all your gear under your seat, flip it back in throw the cover on and you are gone. They also dont get blown around in the wind at all and I for some reason find them warmer? (could be the quality of the hut though)"
995133,Acountdeleted,2017-02-22 13:46:00,2562,I find the flip overs heavy. I bought one a long time ago and find getting it to the spot can be a pain. I'm actually trying to unload my 2 man Clam Nanook so that I can buy a pop up. The weight is what will be the difference maker for me.
995186,jimmer,2017-02-22 18:45:00,2730,"Kashagawigamog would be an early morning late evening, night bite for walleye, not sure about the lakers. South end for lakers and north end for walleye.  There are probably some previous posts about that lake."
995210,misfish,2017-02-22 22:54:00,29133,"I love my hubs, but the break down and moving became a pain. Dont get me wrong, they are great for setting up with lots of room. Even on those windy days, I could have it set up in minutes. I bought an older flip this year. Built a smitty to haul it around. When I know Im not going to be moving, I plant it on the ice,bank it up and get settled in. With the smitty and easy travel ( walking ), I leave it on the smitty. Just drill holes, set up the flip and fishing away. This past weekend I moved probly 30 times. Just flip the hut back and move. Flip it back over. If it,s windy, I will just push the hut off the smitty so the wind is not sweeping inside under the flaps. Even during  the nice days I flip it. Never know who is watching."
995211,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-22 23:12:00,10439,The flip over style huts are best imo....i have both and the pop up huts barely get used.  S.  Me too. Have one of each and the popup gets used very little. Much easier to be mobile with the flipover. When we have safe ice for snowmobiling the flipover is always attached to the back of my sled. The popup is for walking on due to it's light weight.
995213,Sinker,2017-02-22 23:52:00,8692,"I have a couple pop ups i would trade. One is a huge eskimo, only set up twice. I think its 7ft x 14ft. Its a great hut, i just never use it.  The other is a cosco fish inn. I think its 6x6x6'6 tall. Also a great pop up only used a few times.  S."
995241,GBW,2017-02-23 01:55:00,8460,"One thing nobody has asked you yet is how are you moving it along on the lake?  Quad, sled or by foot?  I went with a Clam Bigfoot XL2000 pop up as I walk.  Much lighter for me to move in my cargo sled on foot.  A cordless drill has the ice anchors in fast and the hut's not going to blow away.  If I had a quad or a sled well then I'd be able to use any hut.  And yes they all have a different thickness for the warmth.  Some are 'thermal' so MUCH warmer than a hut that looks just like it but isn't a thicker thermal material."
995293,Ronzo,2017-02-23 16:27:00,124,"I'm a walker and have a popup hut. Takes me all of 5-10 minutes to have it up and anchored at 2 points. It's a Costco FishInn, and it's been worth every penny. It comes in the house after every trip and gets dried out, believe that's helped with longevity. Only weighs 20lbs or so."
