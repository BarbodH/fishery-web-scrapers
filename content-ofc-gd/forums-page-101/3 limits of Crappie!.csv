994720,limeyangler,2017-02-18 21:23:00,5204,"Hi all,  A new buddy of mine took me to his crappie hot spot, great morning! Good company, +7C with sunshine and the fish were biting too. All fish in 16 to 17 FOW, very light bite. They were hitting plastics on small jigs but I have to say they liked my spoon tipped with a minnow head better than the plastics.   "
