That said, this mild spell has had a few trees running a little.....I may have missed a bit, but oh well, I'm just not ready yet!  Thanks again, really appreciate that.  S.   I'm here when you need them!"
992783,jimmer,2017-01-26 18:32:00,2730,"I was out yesterday roaming around the Beaverton area.  We didn't catch nearly as many as you mentioned Cliff, but did bring home 20 for dinner.  We tried a few spots, but ran into some real issues with the ice fields.  The endless slush that came out of some of the holes was a real pain and we ended up giving up on a few holes. It was nice to get out though.  First time this year for me on Simcoe."
992788,Sinker,2017-01-26 20:08:00,8692,"Yeah, the slush under the ice is a bit of a pain for sure. I find the perch are always in the areas that have it though. Not sure why that is, but I have seen it a few times now. When its like that I put the jiffy down the hole and  just let 'er rip pulling water and slush on top of the ice. It helps a lot.  My better half and a friend of hers were out with Tim Hales yesterday and did well again. She came home with about 25-30 good ones for me to clean LOL.......said the morning was hot, but it slowed down mid day and started to pick up again about 4pm.  S."

Just let me know when works for you, Now I only have a Nissan Rogue so with the seats folded down and the pails stacked I figure we might be able to get 50 of them in there. I only need 4 or 5 so Shane can have all the rest! I am out of town Feb. 2 and 3 and Feb.11 and 12 and 14 and 15. Any other date, just let me know a day or two in advance and I'll book off work and do a road trip."
992796,Big Cliff,2017-01-26 21:40:00,6899,"Cliff glad to see you've managed to get out a couple of times already, I didn't think the ice would be thick enough.  I currently have weekends off until March.  Come March I will have Tue/Wed off and if the huts are still out would love to join you at least once if possible  I'll look forward to reading more of your reports in the meantime  Maureen Moe it's been way too long, If he still has huts out in March it's a date"

I really enjoyed the chance to sit and talk with you and would love to get you out perch fishing with me anytime! Hope all goes well with your wife, sounds like you are on the right track. If you ever need ANYTHING, just let me know (I know where you live  )  A promise made is a debt unpaid!  Big Cliff"
995438,ketchenany,2017-02-24 19:25:00,3229,"Cliff, it was my pleasure, to bad the weather wasn't better we could have had a cold on the patio. Too late for perch this year but next year if we are well I'll take you up on it for sure, since one of the kids is coming your way soon. Watch the ""red"" stuff It came out of those pails before I gave it guidence!  Those brochures/books are made with our tax money, might as well make them look good I say!"
995450,Big Cliff,2017-02-24 21:21:00,6899,"I never drive and drink my friend, (might hit a bump and spill something LOL) Seriously though 0 tolerance for this old man, didn't use to be that way but I've grown older and wiser) The coffee sure was good though!"

992562,Big Cliff,2017-01-24 21:10:00,6899,"last week it was John and I and we had a stellar day on Simco. Plenty of fish and fantastic company, how can you improve on that?  Well this week it was a long time buddy Jim. Slow start just like John and I, not a bite until about 9:30 then I landed a real beauty. We jigged , we drop shotted,  I was getting a little worried after telling Jim how good the fishing was the week before. (I could see the OH SURE look n his eyes)  Then it happened; a hit, whoops, another hit, oh cripes, we've got fish on and our lines are tangled, two beautiful perch, BUT WAIT, THERE's MORE!  I've got a double header, two decent fish, Jim has a real beauty, only problem he is in one hole, I'm in another  .  Ok, I pay out line so Jim can bring them up (I hate tangles anyway  ). Jim does his thing, his fish in the bucket, mine back to swim another day  .Oh no, Jim has to cut some line to get the birds nest undone! Being the true gentleman he is, Jim cuts HIS line (OH YA, I'D have done that too, cut his line I mean  )  From that moment on it was fish on, fish on, fish on! We stopped using two lines each, we couldn't get a line down without getting another hit and they were big ones and running wide. I would say the average fish we caught was in the 11"" range with several exceeding 13+"" and lots of double headers. There were a few times when they were pulling drag off the reels!  We only kept about 30 fish between us, a few of the smaller ones were badly hooked and wouldn't have survived so into the bucket they went and we kept a few of the bigger ones; well just because we could!  Met up with a couple or really nice fellows from Costa Rica and they did really well too, they even managed a nice herring, it was fun talking with them (although my Spanish is nowhere as good as their English).  Anyway, to sum it up; We lost count at 247 perch, had another fantastic day out with Tim Hales, and I'm looking forward to doing it again in the next few days. BTW, Tim has a really good video on Face Book regarding ice conditions. Looks like there is still a solid 11"" of ice where he has his huts. (I'm not saying it's safe!!!!!!!)  And no! I am not getting a discount or anything other than great customer service and fantastic fishing from Tim!  And there my friends is why I like fishing! "
992567,Sinker,2017-01-24 21:21:00,8692,"I have never had a bad day with Timmy....even when the fish didn't want to bite. Always a class act, and great operation. I LOVE his shop too....some real cool stuff in there!  Glad ya had a good day and got a couple nice feeds of fish too. I don't know about you, but catching that many perch wears me out LOL....its a lot of work when its non stop action like that!!  S."
992568,Sinker,2017-01-24 21:21:00,8692,Lori is headed out with him tomorrow.....I gotta work!!  S.

992573,crappieperchhunter,2017-01-24 21:40:00,2582,Another great day Cliff. Good on you guys. Sounds like Tim has his huts in the right spot.
992574,Big Cliff,2017-01-24 21:41:00,6899,"Lori is headed out with him tomorrow.....I gotta work!!  S. Oh man, I'd take her fishing in a heart beat (it's ok, I'm 71 she's safe LOL) She is one very nice young lady! Seriously if she ever needs a ""Tag-A- Long"" I would make sure she got home safe and sound!  C"
992575,Big Cliff,2017-01-24 21:45:00,6899,"I have lots of those buckets if you need some more lol Good shooting Cliff. You know, I could use a few more, no rush! One trick I've learned is that when stacking them I drill a small hole in the bottom of the upper buckets  so it makes them easier to separate. Then I just put a clear garbage bag in the ones with a hole in them when I need to keep them from leaking!"
992576,huzzsaba,2017-01-24 21:59:00,884,"Cliff, we went out last week with TimHales and while we didnt get the number you got, we brought back around 25 decent perch.  we had 4 lines in the water and had a few tangles.  mainly because the fish would get hooked and would make a dart towards the other lines.  It was kind of funny because I would see one rod start to move and then another only to find out the 3rd was the one that had hooked the fish!  We didnt get started until around 9:30 am but all in all was worth the drive."
992577,esoxansteel,2017-01-24 22:23:00,1307,"Nice fishie report Cliff, all you need is the Bushes Beans, and fried taters, the hard part you have taken care of,"
