If you want to go out fishing during the week day, please PM me. I live in Toronto by Yorkdale Mall, and fish regularly on Simcoe, Scugog and Rice. It will be cool to carpool and share the gas and parking.  If you are new to ice fishing, I have extra equipment. You just have to have a very warm pair of boots (-40C or warmer), and dress warm.  I am not a guide. I am just looking to fish with company (especially ice fishing. I don't want to be going out by myself.)  Sleepjigging"
