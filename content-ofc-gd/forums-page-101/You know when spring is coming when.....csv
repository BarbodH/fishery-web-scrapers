March 12th https://www.niagaraoutdoorshow.com/  We will also be back at the Hamilton Bassmasters swap, for our 6th year, in Ancaster. March 25th.  We are busy at it trying to get ready while making sure we fill our orders first.  Ugliboys isn't big enough to play in the big shows yet.  Don't be afraid to stop by , say hello, chew the fat."

I also end up delivering orders for salsa while I'm there."
