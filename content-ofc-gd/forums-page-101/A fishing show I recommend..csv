995467,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-25 01:15:00,8243,"Just caught a fishing show on the new Bell channel BBC Earth. ""Fishing Impossible"". 3 young Brits and one that is called Blowfish who is a Heavy Metal Marine Biologist complete with a Mohawk and face shrapnel. They fished for Northern Pike on a Scottish Loch and chummed the fish from the air via one of those motorized parachutes.  The best was that they used a Drone rigged with a line and a float, hovered over the water in a contest against the other team that flew a kite with line and float and they both caught Browns! I'm going to try my brothers new Drone instead of using planner boards. They put water wings on the expensive Drone in case it crashed.  Blowfish dove a wreck looking for Ling with rod and reel vs. one other guy that put out 10 lines. Rigging 10 lines and watching them can be a challenge.  I know you can get it online but unfortunately my PC won't enable me to cut and paste.  Check it out, nothing serious but it's fun to watch. No selling tires either. It was a fun watch, nothing serious.  Johnny D"
