995131,BlueEye,2017-02-22 13:39:00,338,Wanted to share a video from my buddy Jim over at the Niagara Musky Association from this year - pretty cool underwater perspective he gets.  
995134,BillM,2017-02-22 13:47:00,17367,Looks like that first muskie was chomping on something or was that a lure in it's mouth?
995145,OhioFisherman,2017-02-22 14:17:00,6623,"Cool, looks like lots of bait fish (food) in the water, that mudpuppy and current don't seem well matched?"
995157,dave524,2017-02-22 15:23:00,4508,"The boat launch and the river at Fort Erie are clear of ice , if anyone is so inclined, saw a video taken this morning. Those mudpuppies are the ugliest, we would catch the odd one icefishing in Gravelly Bay at Port Colborne years ago. Great Video"
995175,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-22 17:11:00,8243,Cool video. I was wondering too what was in the Muskies mouth. It brings back memories of my diving days.
995179,Jon,2017-02-22 17:44:00,209,Any idea if that is upstream or downstream of the falls?  Jon
995195,BillM,2017-02-22 20:03:00,17367,Any idea if that is upstream or downstream of the falls?  Jon  That's upstream for sure.
995196,ratherboutdoors,2017-02-22 20:29:00,132,"Cool!  But there is no way you would catch me swimming with that much current upstream of the falls, not even tied to a tree, a BIG tree with a big rope!  nope, nope, nope!  lol"
995198,Raf,2017-02-22 21:15:00,3495,"no way that's the niagara  lack of shopping carts, tires, human remains on the bottom is a dead giveaway.  cool video for sure."
995199,huzzsaba,2017-02-22 21:16:00,884,Cool video.  Any idea whats swimming there this time of the year?  Upper Niagara specifically (Fort Erie)
995201,dave524,2017-02-22 21:43:00,4508,"Cool video.  Any idea whats swimming there this time of the year?  Upper Niagara specifically (Fort Erie)  Walleye, Rainbow and Lakers can be caught all winter."
995202,huzzsaba,2017-02-22 21:51:00,884," Walleye, Rainbow and Lakers can be caught all winter. Thanks!"
995205,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-22 21:59:00,8243,dave beat me to it. He's fast. It is Zone 19 Lake Erie. Bass and Musky are closed season there. We got into a school of Perch there and of course went back and caught a cold and nothing else.  Somehow my last post about where didn't work. PM me Huzz and I'll tell you exactly where we fished.
995206,buick14,2017-02-22 22:00:00,741,I love these vids of niagara. Thanks for posting !
995209,davey buoy,2017-02-22 22:24:00,5505,"Agreed ,loved the video. That current is wicked !!!!!!"
995212,OhioFisherman,2017-02-22 23:26:00,6623,"I have only seen the river from the Fort Erie bridge down to the falls, how much of a depth change is there in that?"
995242,bucktail,2017-02-23 01:57:00,1857,Wow the amount of bait is awesome. The mudpuppy made the video for me!
995252,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-23 02:25:00,8243,"I think the change in depth is about 700 feet. The river at LaSalle NY is something like 6 feet deep. The river next to North Tonawanda where we have fished is 15 to 20 feet deep. I won't go that much further down stream. I have seen boats as far down as the ""TURN AROUND NOW OR BE ON THE WKBW CHANNEL 7 NEWS AT 11"" marker. My Uncle from there thought it was funny to hit the kill switch and pretend the motor won't start while heading towards the Falls, yea funny. He still thinks if the Viet Cong couldn't kill him nothing will."

Actually Old this is what I meant.  http://www.geographic.org/nautical_charts/24_lake_erie/14832_1_upper_niagara_river.html  Since I had only seen the river from shore I had no idea of how deep it was in spots."
995257,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-23 03:03:00,8243,Great topo map. I saved it. Thanks Buckeye.
995261,OhioFisherman,2017-02-23 03:14:00,6623,Great topo map. I saved it. Thanks Buckeye. You're quite welcome sir! It was free!
