Robins,  redwing blackbirds and even bluebirds have been here for a while. The biggest indicator of spring comes from the birds and animals.. My daughters horse has been shedding like crazy for a week now.."

Last year was the first opportunity I'd had to get out with an operator, when I looked at what it cost me and what I was saving by not having to maintain a machine, hut, buy bait, supply propane, and do all the work of moving, storing, and insuring everything, $60.00 a trip with nothing to do but fish.....  Well fishing is fun again LOL and I love those nice firm clean perch I'm getting from Simco."
