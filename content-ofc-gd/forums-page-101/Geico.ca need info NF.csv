995526,cheaptackle,2017-02-26 01:26:00,849,"I ran a ""whois"" on geico.ca - then followed the link on the contact who is involved in 21 or 23 other sites.  Interesting some of those results.  Won't post them here but simply type whois geico.ca in google and go from there to see for yourself.  There is a statement on the site that they are a small ontario based outfit and another that they have 1294 happy customers.  Think Geico would have many more than that.  Michael"
