994955,Fisherman,2017-02-21 00:28:00,7201,"Today I witnessed another tragedy while at work.  About 8 this morning while driving the Base boundary roads, I was passing by a couple of houses on the other side of the fence line on the country road.  While looking over at the houses, noted a women opened the front door and let her dog out, probably for the morning pee.  For whatever reason, the dog took off at full speed towards the road.  It's not a heavily traveled road, 80km/h speed limit,  but at the most unfortunate time a passing pick up came by and struck the dog, death was most likely instant, no crying or whimpering.  The driver had locked up the brakes and was very close to loosing control, must have been a stroke of luck the driver maintained control instead of ending up in the big trees.  The driver didn't stop, just left the scene.  The worst part,  the dogs owner had seen the whole event and understandably went into a writhing fit of cry and screaming.  Her daughter came out and then both went to recover the dogs remains. Think of it,  a simple click of the leash or having a dog(cat) run would have prevented that animals death and owners grief.  Whether you're out in the country or suburbia,  two to three tons of vehicle against an animal are no match.  Was the driver going too fast, definitely not.  Was the driver maybe not paying attention, I doubt it.  At a speed of 80km/h 50mph,  you're going about 50 feet per second.  Knowing your average reaction time is about 3/4 of a second at best,  that driver had probably already hit the dog before getting his foot near the brake.  I'm glad the driver didn't loose it and and end up in the woods.  That could have been another tragedy.   Should the driver have stopped, yes.  Then again, maybe he thought he hit one of the local coyotes, same colour as the dog and about the same size.  Not that this event will play on my mind for long, I'm a bit thick skinned.  It's just something for pet owners to ponder."

Sometimes with only minor injuries. Often times needing major work including orthopaedic surgery costing thousands. All because of carelessness. ""I can't believe he ran across the road after that squirrel "". It's too bad."
994994,mukluk,2017-02-21 14:17:00,196,Another situation that can happen real fast is when the dog runs across weak ice on a pond or lake to get the duck.  He falls through.  Owner tries a rescue and falls through as well.  Manages to get the dog out.  The dog runs up on the shore; shakes and starts licking his balls leaving the owner fighting for his life to get out of the fridgid water.
994997,Sinker,2017-02-21 14:29:00,8692,"This happened to my dog just before christmas. It was the worste day of my life. I have a leash, and I have a proper dog run, but he just bolted on me...and wasn't stopping for anything. I had enough time to run in the house to grab my headlight, and before I walked back out the door to get after him, my phone was ringing. The person on the other end said my dog was in a ditch and couldn't move his back legs. I would have rather heard them tell me he was dead, because what i saw my dog go through was traumatizing.  I've had many dogs, and putting them down is always the hardest thing, but this one was horrible.  Sometimes things happen that are out of our control. Animals have their own brains, and do what they feel sometimes. The driver also didn't stop. I don't even know if they knew they'd hit him.  RIP Coby. He was a great pooch. Only 4yrs old. Male black lab.  S."
995007,captpierre,2017-02-21 15:28:00,2521,Sorry to hear Sinker. That's devastating. They have a mind of their own.
995009,Sinker,2017-02-21 15:41:00,8692,"Thank you. I usually get a new dog right away, but this time I am going to have to wait a while. It was devastating."
995010,Acountdeleted,2017-02-21 15:44:00,2562,"This is why, whenever I see someone that isn't in an off leash dog park with their dog off leash I tell them off.  'But he is a good dog' 'He never leaves my side'  You just never know and all it takes is once."
995018,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-21 16:44:00,8243,"The exact thing happened to me twice. Both times the dogs were virtually unscathed. I stopped both times. The last time the ""owner"" seemed to care less. That was as upsetting to me as hitting the dog. I have no idea how both Dogs were not killed instantly."

Never had to do it due to an accident, but whatever the reason is, it is not something I would want to go through again any time soon."

There always like ""don't worry he is friendly"".  And I'm like.  "" mines not he will eat yours""."
995325,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-23 21:28:00,8243,"Our neighbourhood is notorious for dogs running around off leash. Their owners are putting their pets in a dangerous situation. More than a few times I heard the squeal of tires and then the yelp. Those dog owners should be made to run across he 400 highway. One of those dogs ran up on my 82 year old Mom when she was here and knocked her to the ground. I read the guy the riot act. Who do I see the next day with the 2 dogs off leash? Same idiot. Another neighbours dog snuck up on me a few winters ago, I turn around and trip over the dog and I tore my knee up, again. Who do I see run the dog everyday here off leash? You guessed it, my idiot neighbour who I think trolls this site. It' not the poor dogs fault I keep reminding myself. Dogs are dogs, they do what dogs do. Train them to stop on command, they will do that if trained well. Our next door neighbours pure white Husky will walk to the property line and sit and watch, he only comes over if I tell him to."
