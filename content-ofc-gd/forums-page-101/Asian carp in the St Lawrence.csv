995864,John Bacon,2017-03-01 14:56:00,3277,"What are reed carp?  The term asian carp usually refers to grass, silver, bighead, or black carp.  There have been sightings of grass carp in the Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence over the last few years.  Silver carp are the jumpers."

All carp are asian carp.  I have never heard of reed carp before.  Perhaps that is the french to english translation of grass carp.  If so, there have already been several reports of them over the last few years."
995979,Sterling,2017-03-02 13:33:00,477,"Phew this article scared me for a second.  It seems that most species of asian carp fit well within the ecosystem (I think) aside from the silver ones.  Somewhat related, the US government has re-introduced the alligator gar in the Mississippi in an effort to reduce asian silver carp population;  http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/08/conservation-of-ancient-fishes-reintroducing-the-alligator-gar-and-what-about-those-carp/"

996034,John Bacon,2017-03-02 19:48:00,3277,"Wow, that article is totally misleading.  The story is about Asian Carp invading the St. Lawrence while the dramatic jumping carp in the picture are from the Ohio River.    Brutal journalism.  I think that using a single term, asian carp, to refer to several completely different species of fish is far more misleading than using a picture from a different river."
