994691,FloatnFly,2017-02-18 13:20:00,1640,time to boycott this event or shut it down all together.  event schedualed for April 8th. The head organizer is apparently quoted as saying 'who cares if we kill some fish and wipe out spawning beds'  https://www.facebook.com/ganaraska.fishway  
994692,Garfisher,2017-02-18 13:42:00,229,Where and when do they stock the Atlantics? In theory they could get charged under the Species At Risk act if they harass them or destroy habitat.
994836,FloatnFly,2017-02-20 00:34:00,1640,"they stock atlantics above where the race starts, but they would be moving down through the race area at the time of the race. steelhead will be in there spawning at that time.  they start the crazy craft(homemade contraptions) that are held together by any means,at sylvan glen.  and canoes and kayaks in Canton, which is on the other side of Sylvan Glen"
994876,ecmilley,2017-02-20 13:41:00,2163,sounds like a lot of he said she said blah blah blah is there any real proof there doing habitat damage ?
994880,FloatnFly,2017-02-20 14:19:00,1640,"sounds like a lot of he said she said blah blah blah is there any real proof there doing habitat damage ?  its not the canoes and kayaks they are worried about so much, because people actually take care of those and avoid scrapping bottom.  its the home made crazy craft held together by whatever that barely float and roll over all the time. those scrape bottom, they damage shorelines when dragging their 'boats'in and out of the river.  not to mention they go into the fish sanctuary"
994894,Terry,2017-02-20 17:30:00,14456,"my problem  is  I heard pretty much the same stuff last year is there any documentation that the ""float your""   people were well informed about the problem or is everyone just whining, while no one is trying to stop it or educate them"
994898,FloatnFly,2017-02-20 17:40:00,1640,"Jason Whyte,  one of the guys that run the fish ladder is involved every year right from the first meetings to get try and convince them to either cancel the event or push the date back into march like years before.  the past several years this event has taken place the week before trout opener.  problem being, you can preach to the organizers all you want, but until they are able to relay that messege to the people participating, nothing happens."
994904,Terry,2017-02-20 18:10:00,14456,groups take minutes at meeting get past meeting minutes to prove  anglers have been telling them from the get go that would prove they are lying about no knowing and that this is the first they are hearing about it  or at very least  take screen shots of their facebook page proving they know about it this year so next year they cant lie again make sure they are told this happens yearly not just this year
994929,FloatnFly,2017-02-20 22:09:00,1640,"he is at every council meeting, or group meeting that has to do with the river.  he is actually a member of this site, wondering when/if he'll comment with more"
995549,chessy,2017-02-26 15:24:00,610,"been busy with the towns new bylaws... the ganny race is to be held on the 8 with a rain date of the 15 the organizers say the race produces 10 000 spectators 3900 from more than 40 km away with spending of 214000 dollars just on the 3900 people in the area . the constant quote from barry is that it is a moral booster and a economic engine . when you see craft coming to the portage and they have the orange snow fencing and it has to be replaced on the bottom of the craft because it has been worn away, you know they are doing some sort of damage . I have dealt with them for 4 years now , last year his comments were  barbaric in my opinion . i have tried to have them move the date to  late march or early april with no progress . I have now contacted the Fish protection program for there input . this year instead of helping keep people out of sancturary i will be doing videos of before race and after race on spawning beds. and then i will send to the FPP and have them decide. instead of moving race to late march early april they may have forced the hand that the race can not continue ."

995640,jimmer,2017-02-27 14:35:00,2730,I will boycott.  Never been in the past though. I hope they don't really do the damage that is stated by running the float day.
