995247,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-23 02:09:00,8243,"The poacher was his buddy. It is ""alternative truth"". A new catch phrase used by a certain leader of the free World."
995341,GbayGiant,2017-02-23 23:21:00,1780,"the guy flying the drone did more wrong the guy fishing, its a wonder the guy poaching doesnt turn him in!"
995343,manitoubass2,2017-02-23 23:29:00,11391,Yep. Theft.  But as stated it's not real.
995345,GbayGiant,2017-02-23 23:41:00,1780,Yep. Theft.  But as stated it's not real. the way the laws have changed regarding drones.....I wouldn't be worried about the theft charge ..
995346,Terry,2017-02-23 23:43:00,14456,the whole video is a hoax
995350,manitoubass2,2017-02-24 00:03:00,11391,I wouldn't be worried about the new laws either.  Pretty dumb to post it on YouTube but yeah...
995357,FloatnFly,2017-02-24 01:15:00,1640,"unless you choose to watch it on YouTube, you don't see the disclaimer. I watched it in OFC window and saw nothing about the hoax.  it says (hoax) in the title of the video in the OFC window, white lettering top left"
995358,woodenboater,2017-02-24 01:48:00,2277,hmm. don't remember seeing that. was it always there or did drone dude edit the video title ?
995452,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-24 22:01:00,8243,"People see what they want to see. See GB Giants post still arguing about the theft after it was said a few times it was all a staged hoax.  My wife has a few hobbies and one is astronomy, she recently was so exited because she read that an entire new solar system was recently discovered and the planets in it have water and all the things needed to promote life. I looked at the site and it was clearly a fake, Reuters was spelled wrong. Should I burst her bubble or let her go around telling people the internet ""alternative truth"" hoax? Now that's ""Fake News"" Donnie. CNN, NY Times, Wash Post and LA Times didn't report it though so maybe it's just alternate truth not fake."
995453,PUMP KNOWS,2017-02-24 22:10:00,937,Looks like it was edited after.  The description said something about the DNR had confiscated the tip up.  I didn't read anything about a hoax.  #itwasjustaprankbro has officially crossed over to the fishing community
995454,manitoubass2,2017-02-24 22:26:00,11391,Of course you should burst her bubble! That's how you get the best couch in the house! Lol  As for GB he obviously didn't read the thread so.... Grain of salt.  I've done it too many times to count.  Not a fan of Donnie? I'll leave that one alone lol #weedworks
995456,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-24 22:43:00,8243,Make no mention of the Orangatang or risk expulsion. That's why I get my political kicks now from POLITICO not OFC.
995037,PUMP KNOWS,2017-02-21 19:48:00,937,I thought it was funny to watch the tip up fly in the sky  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXbh3RVkeGw
995041,manitoubass2,2017-02-21 20:20:00,11391,"Loved every second.  That is amazing!!!  Good on the filmer/operator, back it 100%"
995056,Big Cliff,2017-02-21 21:56:00,6899,"I thought it was funny to watch the tip up fly in the sky  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXbh3RVkeGw Funny? Well perhaps but that was theft, doesn't matter that the guy was doing something illegal. The rules for flying drones are getting stricter all the time and this guy broke a few of them. I don't think posting this on You Tube with your own picture was very smart, now the fisherman knows who did it.  Got to be careful what you post on social media, it can come back to haunt you very easily!"
995061,Steve,2017-02-21 22:42:00,2075,"Agree with Cliff. Definitely theft. However, I don't believe the pilot of the drone broke any rules (although there may be state specific regulations in Minnesota that differ from Ontario). If that was in Ontario, the drone would not have broken any current FAA rules."
995062,irishfield,2017-02-21 22:47:00,26272,Nope.. because the FAA has no jurisdiction in Ontario!  Go to Transport Canada and read the rules on drone use in Canada. Most everyone flying them is breaking at least one law... most all of them.
995063,Steve,2017-02-21 22:49:00,2075,"TC just follows FAA's rules.  FAA makes changes, TC follows. (with respect to drones).  We have followed the evolution of drone use over the last few years and have noticed TC has just followed the FAA decisions.  Many of our customers are using drones these days. Interesting how they are Insured."
995064,Fisherman,2017-02-21 22:51:00,7201,"Yes, theft.  If you're that concerned, gets some pics and call your MNR(DNR down there).  Wouldn't be surprised if the guy finds out, the pilot will have a couple of flat tires and sweet gas."
995065,irishfield,2017-02-21 22:52:00,26272,"I'm just tired of having too many near misses landing at an ""aerodrome"" where they are illegal to fly within 5 miles of same. IE our float plane base in Temagami.  As for this guy.. outright theft!"
995067,Steve,2017-02-21 22:56:00,2075,"That is a bad one Irish.  The FCC put a 5 mile distance ban, so TC followed with a 9 km distance ban (5 miles = 9 km).  Our customers must have an operator who is Special Flight Operations Certified....as they are using the drone for commercial activities.  But it is still a free for all with personal use....  For those curious, here's the rules for personal use of drones: "
995068,irishfield,2017-02-21 22:58:00,26272,Like I said.. he broke at least one law... 500' !
995074,manitoubass2,2017-02-21 23:22:00,11391,Meh. He screwed a poacher.  Never hurt anyone BUT said poacher  I back it.  His intentions are good and put nobody at risk.
995077,G.mech,2017-02-21 23:30:00,830,And there's the unwritten rule that was explained to a neighbour who thought fly by's over my property were perfectly legal: 
995082,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-22 00:01:00,8243,Does that ice look sketchy to you? When I saw that much water sitting on ice I didn't venture out on it. Especially on a blue bird sunny day in plus temps. 3 deaths this past week under the ice in Ontario alone.  If it was today I could come up with a dozen times a shift I could use a drown to inspect the tops of the Blast Furnaces in winter or during a thunder boomer. Maybe more. No one complained in the summer though.
995085,manitoubass2,2017-02-22 00:14:00,11391,I also back this but it's over a lake/river.  NOT YOUR PROPERTY
995086,G.mech,2017-02-22 00:16:00,830,I also back this but it's over a lake/river.  NOT YOUR PROPERTY   Ya i get it but the previous post was about drone flying rules in general so I thought this was relevant....maybe not.
995087,manitoubass2,2017-02-22 00:23:00,11391, Sorry if I went overboard. Lots on my mind
995088,G.mech,2017-02-22 00:30:00,830,Nah it is man. I'd be pissed if someone flew a drone over my property and would likely shoot it down.  Sorry if I went overboard. Lots on my mind  No worries...happens to the best of us.
995090,Rizzo,2017-02-22 01:22:00,4754,"too funny. If I stole some drunk guy's gear I would be running and hiding, not making fun of said dude on social media. Never know what people will do...some of us are loose cannons who will react crazily."
995092,chris.brock,2017-02-22 01:27:00,4053," A lot of these youtube videos are fabricated bull pooh, trying to get a viral video."
995098,tb4me,2017-02-22 02:21:00,3295,"A lot of these youtube videos are fabricated bull pooh, trying to get a viral video. I was thinking the  exact same thing.."
995163,LucG,2017-02-22 15:41:00,779,Read the description in the video... It clearly states it was a hoax.  #staged
995173,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-22 17:03:00,8243,"If you watched it on You Tube it clearly states it is a hoax. It was a social experiment to see how many people actually read the descriptions, off the comments on You Tube 95% of viewers missed it."
995180,manitoubass2,2017-02-22 17:54:00,11391,I certainly did.
995184,woodenboater,2017-02-22 18:26:00,2277,"unless you choose to watch it on YouTube, you don't see the disclaimer. I watched it in OFC window and saw nothing about the hoax."
