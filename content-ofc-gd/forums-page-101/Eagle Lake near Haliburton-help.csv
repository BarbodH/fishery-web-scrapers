995114,scuro2,2017-02-22 04:37:00,904,"I'll be heading up to Eagle lake in the second half of August. First, if anyone has a cottage up there and would like to do some fishing on their boat, I'd gladly pay for gas. Second, I know in the general area there are some muskie lakes so I'd be willing to pay for guiding. Please PM me. Finally, is there a Marina on the lake? My mom loves the pontoon boat rides"
995115,GBW,2017-02-22 05:31:00,8460,"Book your mom some ""mom time"" at Sir Sam's resort.  As for the other stuff it's been 15 years or longer since I have been out fishing on that lake."
995574,Shloim,2017-02-26 20:34:00,515,My friends have a cottage on a connected lake and therespecially a launch for sure on Eagle lake. I'm not positive but there must be a marina. Google er!
995798,jimmer,2017-02-28 20:48:00,2730,I don't think that there is a marina on Eagle Lake.  You might have to make a run to Fort Irwin and see if they rent boats there. That's on Haliburton Lake.
995833,scuro2,2017-03-01 02:26:00,904,Yeah we drove by there last time had ice cream at the variety store. That is a good idea. We are on the north end of Eagle so not too far away...ty

They did years ago as I had a family cottage as a child and my uncle's buddies would either rent from there or pay and launch  Yeah we drove by there last time had ice cream at the variety store.

995950,scuro2,2017-03-02 02:51:00,904,Oh I'm going...without a boat I'll be fishing within range of a 1 hr kayak paddle and will probably explore all of that water within two weeks!
996146,frodobuggins,2017-03-04 12:30:00,127,I rented a cottage on that lake last summer for a week. Its not a big lake - on calm days my wife paddle boarded the whole thing in a short amount of time. There is no marina on the lake. I never saw a musky - just smallies. Its a great lake for families as there is a lot of sandy shores.
996189,Sinker,2017-03-04 18:51:00,8692,"Some nice back lakes in that area that would be perfect for your kayak. You won't run out of water, that's for sure. Haliburton lake is beauties too.  S."
