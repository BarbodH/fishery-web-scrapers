You ice guys know better than me and are further north, just be smart about it, please.I put out the patio stuff out today. Feb 24th????? C'mon man! Friends are flying out to Mexico for a month tomorrow, Louis is kicking himself. Not cheap.  Not to be insensitive to the future of the planet but ""Global Warming"" bring it on. That is a laugh out loud, but I like it so far."
