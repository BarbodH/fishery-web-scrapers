Bring your own lunch/beverages, only thing I ask is no smoking in the hut. I will bring a pot to make tea,coffee, soup or whatever.  Depart Tim's parking lot 7:30 am  With this warm front moving in the bite should be really good.  If you are interested let me know asap, only one seat, first come first serve."

I'll text you some sausages if you email me some perch. Have fun and please be safe on the ice. We will get to meet each other, hopefully here on Earth.
