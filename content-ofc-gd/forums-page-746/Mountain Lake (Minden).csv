416471,Steel28,2009-12-29 18:47:00,160,Thinking of going to Mountain Lake for some lakers this weekend. Any tips/advices for this lake?  Not looking for any hotspots  thanks
416730,singingdog,2009-12-30 12:20:00,1047,Watch the ice thickness on the northeast side. The current that flows through to Mirror lake keeps the ice pretty thin over there.
416733,turtle,2009-12-30 12:42:00,274,"Same as last post, watch the ice conditions.  May not be safe at all this weekend.  I've only fished it once for a few hours and got skunked.  I was at the hwy 35 side south of the dam and inflow from 12 mile lake.  I've seen people ice fish just below the inflow and pretty close to open water.  There was a post of what to use a few days ago.  I would try 20-60 feet off points and islands etc when you get out.  I'll be driving by it Friday on the way to my cottage, our bay will probably have safe ice but the main lake wont."
