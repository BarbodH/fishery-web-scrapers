I was given his name by someone on the board and i can t remmber who it was, i was looking of Lowrance equipment, just wondering how honest this guy is, I purchased a transducer and cables from him and got them this afternoon, and was looking at it and it is a used ducer and is cracked, so that is why i am curios if anyone has dealt with him because i will surely be calling him Sat. thanks"
417506,NANUK,2010-01-01 06:34:00,797,"I have bought tons of stuff from Joss @ Angling Outfitters, always had the right product, great service and fair price. BUT the #1 reason I buy from him is because of his A1 customer service!! I live in Scarborough and usually just call him for whatever I need, give him my VISA # over the phone and I receive everything via Canada Post as axpected. he doesn't even charge me extra for shipping on most small items. I never heard any one complain about him either. So to answer your question: I do belive he is an honest person. Not arguing with your experience but I find it hard to believe that he would ship a broken or defective item. it could be damaged in shipping Give him a call and I am sure he will resolve your isue, he is the largest (volume) Lowrance dealer in Ontario."
417513,walleyejack,2010-01-01 10:41:00,358,"Yes, i had heard before exactly what you had just said, i believe him to be honest or he would not get the repeat business that he does, don t get me wrong, am not complaining, just wanted to get an opinion. thanks.. gone fishin !!"
417650,Loonietoon,2010-01-01 19:48:00,1450,Have been dealing with Jo's so long he would never steer you wrong or sell anything that is broken unless it was broken in shipping. Call him and he will look after you..
417652,TEP,2010-01-01 19:52:00,68,"Straight up dude if you ask me. If it's damaged he will take care of you! I have bought from him, and I have sent others too. Actually several others....All were happy!"
417666,SlowPoke,2010-01-01 20:21:00,2984,There is no doubt in my mind that Jos will look after this for you.
417756,irishfield,2010-01-02 00:51:00,26272,Really hate these kind of posts.. call him first in the am.. and then if need be post here asking if he's honest. A much better order of progression IMHO.
417762,JohnF,2010-01-02 01:14:00,3494, I'm sure he means to post a very fast public apology here when it gets sorted out.  JF
417765,SlowPoke,2010-01-02 01:22:00,2984,"I would agree; give him a chance to right the wrong before spreading the word.    Some kind of follow up is deserved!  I don't think Jos is taking a rep hit here. Most know he's a stand-up guy and he'll get it sorted out. I'm looking forward to eloquently written, glowing endorsement of good customer service; not so much as an apology."
417769,Handlebarz,2010-01-02 01:32:00,3790,Dont be afraid to call him he will make it right he will NEVER screw you over if something is not right he will make it right his place is the best I have heard of in Ontario for what he does. I bought alot of stuff from him and in some cases he will beat the USD price. I bought a used Nav card from him last year and it works 100%
417791,walleyejack,2010-01-02 02:51:00,358,"I am sorry i said anything, not trying to discredit the man at all, was just asking if anyone new about his business, i never met him personaly but talked on the phone and seemed genuine, guess i should have said nothing, sorry to upset a few people thanks"
