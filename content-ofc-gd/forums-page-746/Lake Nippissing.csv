Well maybe some want to keep it a secret. I'll be there  from Mon - Thurs. I 'm going with Sandybay and hope to get a few pickeral, and A few perch as well. I've got a fellow back home here who wants me to bring him a good feed of herring as well. I'll report on Friday since it will be a long ride back on Thurs. night. Good luck to all, and may all of you come home with a good feed of fish."
