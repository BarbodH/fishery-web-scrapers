I have done quite a bit of searching on lake but like to hear from anyone in here about there experience there. Would like to know the best method ,minnows or worms for that lake. Hopefully we can get our catch, and we are bringing our own boats up and wondering if it is hard to get to the other lakes there. thanks Les"
