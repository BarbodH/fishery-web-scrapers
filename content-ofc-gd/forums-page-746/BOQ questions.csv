417448,tapout,2010-01-01 04:09:00,166,I am toying with the idea of heading there Saturday but would like to know if anyone can advise me as to a location thats walker friendly but might hold a reasonable chance at a walleye.  I have room for additional passengers if anyone can else wants to go.  I'm in Brampton.  Tony.
417493,Fang,2010-01-01 05:33:00,1330,A buddy was out there this morning and there's a bunch of huts off Trenton so ice must be good. Call out to a couple of the bait shops and get an update
417675,Joeytier,2010-01-01 20:51:00,3990,Big Bay would be your best bet.
417683,tapout,2010-01-01 21:22:00,166,I was thinking Big Bay.  Would Minnie Blakely shoal be safe?  Its not far from Massassauga Pt and I believe I read its kinda dicey there.
417690,Joeytier,2010-01-01 21:32:00,3990,"There's quite a narrows there.  I saw huts close to there a few days ago, but no machines and after the last two days I wouldn't risk it."
417693,tapout,2010-01-01 21:59:00,166,Thanks for the heads up.  Any recommendations? Remember I'll be hiking it.  No sled.
