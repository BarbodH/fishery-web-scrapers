Mostly interesting in a resort and a 2 bedroom cottage.  Any help would be appreciated.  I don't mind suggestions for other lakes as well within a 3 hour drive of Toronto, if you're so inclined.   We are targeting lake trout, whitefish and hopefully at least one other species such as pike, walleye or perch.  Cheers!!!"
