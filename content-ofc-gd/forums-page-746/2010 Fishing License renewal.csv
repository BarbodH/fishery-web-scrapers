417033,ckrb2007,2009-12-31 02:38:00,449,i got mine from the Mississauga LeBarons today and my buddy got his from Bass Pro.
417066,Stoty,2009-12-31 03:52:00,2910,Cobourg CT has them! I got mine this morning!!
417128,CX-9,2009-12-31 14:28:00,13,"Thanks everyone for all your input. I just got mine yesterday at the Mississauga Lebaron store, hmmm funny they only accept Cash or Debit for purchasing a license, no CC is accepted...."
417140,irishfield,2009-12-31 14:50:00,26272,"Because they don't make anything off of them and the fee (probably somewhere between 2.7 to 3.5% for them) to accept a credit card would put them in the hole.  I think Jim (Dad's Temagami) told me he only gets 60 or 70 cents, or something rediculous, for filling out a fishing licence. The hope is that you'll buy something else while in the store."
417153,laszlo,2009-12-31 15:09:00,487,le barons in mississauga has them. got mine today!
417494,FisherMike,2010-01-01 05:40:00,108,the mnr store website is back up and running.  i just got my license online.
417527,pikehunter,2010-01-01 13:42:00,1659,"Good point Hometown, didn't think of the HST coming in, this is a good time to buy the 3 year permit. Bloody HST"
417529,glen,2010-01-01 14:02:00,2641,Whats the fine for fishing with out a license because i might get the fine today.  I cant get a license.
417615,Stern Rules,2010-01-01 18:34:00,342,The CT in Brantford told me they aren't allowed to sell them until Jan 2 so I don't know why you guys were able to get yours. Every store should be the same. That's Bull if you ask me. I could be fishing right now.

And, also I went to the Ministry of Natural Resource website to check if I can renew there, and nope 2010 is not available there too.  So I want to fish on New Years day, so where can I get my 2010 license so I can fish on that day???   Thanks."
