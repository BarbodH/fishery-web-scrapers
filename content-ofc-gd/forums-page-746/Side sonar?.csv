With It receiving a signal from 400ft out the side it could make the world of difference finding structure and bait balls.  So my question is do you think it would work under the ice?"

417871,Terry,2010-01-02 15:17:00,14456,it will work but for photo like detail you must be trolling about 5mph so get out the chain saw and cut a long hunk of ice out and run  it will work  but I would think because it gets a wide area it will get interference from everyone within it's receiving area   play and let us know how it does
