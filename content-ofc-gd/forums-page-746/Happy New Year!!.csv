Thanks to the whole community for all the shared experiences, tips, great reports and comments.  Also a big thanks from me to the mods who keep the train a rollin'.  We're on our way out for the evening, being picked up and cabbing it home!   Everyone have a safe night, be sensible (ya ya ... ill try to take my own advice...) and most of all be safe.  See you all in 2010!!!"
