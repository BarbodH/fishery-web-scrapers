416931,cowanjo,2009-12-30 23:33:00,249,I just did the sums - I have to be honest i am a starbucks guy - dont ask. Thats it im done - I will not do this habit anymore. I just worked out with coffee meetings I probably do easy $2K a year  i can not give up the beer maybe I wil lstart a thread on how to home brew. Here it a buck a bottle (and a bottle is 3 litres)  Good thread and will make me quit
416936,mbac31,2009-12-30 23:41:00,904,"I just recently made a friend aware that his coffee habits were costly. Dont seem like much when you do it every day but when you add them all together, well he just about took a stroke. I make a thermos every morning and bring it for my guys as well. Make my own lunch and very rarely eat out. Raise my own beef and chickens as well. Grew up doing this as well as preserving veggies each season. Cuts down on costs and also gets rid of all those contaminents in grocery store food."

417101,pikehunter,2009-12-31 11:49:00,1659,"Brew your own and buy her a thermos if she needs several fixes throughout the day. Sure she won't be proud of you but that will only last a dy or two. She will either develop a taste for the money saved or will quit altogether.  The trick to a good cup of coffee is the temperature the maker gets the water up to, 195 to 205 is what I have been told is ideal. Read some reports and reviews of coffee machines and make a decision. Expensive also doesn't mean that the machine works any better that a cheap one.  The brand of coffee I liked was he No Name Columbian as it was cheap and flavourful but the only way I have seen it recently is in a larger package if at all. Otherwise it is what's on sale, Maxwelhouse  or Folgers (I think Folgers mountain roast is a little stronger than the classic blend?) I found Folgers stays fresher longer, also don't leave your coffee machine turned on after it has finished. Turn it off and either cool the coffee and nuke it for later drinking or put the remainder in a thermos, keeping it on heat only cooks it."

417104,splashhopper,2009-12-31 12:25:00,2931,  Hi Smalliefisher....  you mention above that you raise your own chicken and beef.... but your profile say you live in Toronto.  I only know of one farm there... (at the end of Winchester street off Parliament)  I live in London and I am not allowed to have a cow and chickens in my yard... pleeeeze don;t tell me I have to moooove back to Toronto to have a farm...
417105,splashhopper,2009-12-31 12:28:00,2931,"I have done the math on my "" Timmie's fix"" / day....  It's a HELLUVA lot cheaper than the alcohol ( and other non-mentionable) I consumed on a daily basis for a long time.  Don't mess with my FIX... or at least my rationalization....  However,, the original post did mention the incentive of a new boat"
417106,dave524,2009-12-31 12:40:00,4508," This is exactly what my wife and I have found. Use one of the metal carafe makers now,  keeps it warm enough for a long time and nuke it a little if it cools. For coffee, we really have enjoyed the Costco Kirkland Brand 100% Columbian for about 8 years now, you can make it good and strong without it getting bitter, price is quite good as well for a 100% Columbian."
417114,Beans,2009-12-31 13:25:00,3339, Dang !!!...The wife was in Costco yesterday while I waited outside...Didn't know about their 100% Columbian coffee...My favorite type...right now I am enjoying some freshly ground Columbian in a large 16 ounce Starbucks cup that I got in the draw at the Tyler Event last year...Maribeth gave me a 1 lb bag of beans for Christmas and I grind my own and use a Melita No 2 manual filter...heat up 16 ounces of water in the microwave as I'm the only one that drinks coffee here unless Jack (Nanook) drops by on his way home from wood carving...Rarely will I have more than one large cup a day...Don't care much for Timmies...prefer Country Style...Both places would go bankrupt waiting for me...
417116,mbac31,2009-12-31 13:49:00,904," Thats to funny, I wish I could. But Toronto is a small zoo all on its own without having livestock.    I raise them on a farm up north with a friend. We bring all our fish and rabbits,ducks from my parents house each year. Dad brings a frezer with him on  a truck. We started doing this a few years back and found it to be way cheaper and the meats are awesome. We now have 4 people in on it so it cuts the cost down each year.  There are alot of Farmers willing to do so for you for a cost but will not butcher the meat. We dont buy much stuff in the grocery store."
417118,Muskieman,2009-12-31 13:51:00,2472,"I'm so glad I started making my own again...  After being parked for 3 years or more that 20 years old clunker still makes good coffee...the Bailey's makes it even better.  I know that it's not even 9 yet , but I'm OFF 'til Sunday @10pm.    RFS "
417162,Radnine,2009-12-31 15:36:00,1538,"I have posted that same findings here in the past. Think about people going on strike to for $50 more a month and it also helps to put it in perspective. Also, remember that you are spending after tax dollars and it takes about a buck forty to earn one of those. I have quit buying my morning coffee in the school caf this year and it saves me around $35 a month (and that is just one large @ $1.70 per). Good on ya! Jim"

416779,Muskieman,2009-12-30 15:58:00,2472,For the first time in a few years .. I decided to make a pot of coffee this morning instead of going to Tim Horton's.  So I did a little math..... I and my wife spend on average 12$/day at Tim's.  This is what scared me....  360.00$ PER MONTH!!!!!!!!!!!!  That is the payment for a brand new 17' fishing boat or 2 brand new ATV's or Snowmobiles or that 24' camper we're looking for.  But the sensible thing for me to do would be...Is to invest it in a retirement plan.  No wonder Coffee Shops are popping up everywhere.  .......................  Did any of you do your coffee math lately?   If so how much do you spend?  .....................  RFS 
416781,BillM,2009-12-30 15:59:00,17367,$12 a day?  What' are you buying?  lol

416788,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 16:14:00,8163,My coffee bill is $6 a month for a large jar of instant decaf.
416789,laszlo,2009-12-30 16:20:00,487,drink FRESH coffee once a day in the morning brewed at home for my wife anna and myself = $25 a month for great tasting coffee!  can't go wrong with that.
416791,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-30 16:20:00,2582,I cut Timmies outta my daily routine a couple of years ago. It's amazing how much you spend there. For years my breakfast on the way to work was a XLDD and 20 timbits or 2 bagels...$3.34 if I remember. Then a coffee at least 2 or 3 nights a week in the arena watching my sons hockey. Coffee and food on the way too the lake...etc. etc. Debbe drinks a ton of Timmies coffee  too.  Now I might grab a Timmies on the way back home from a day on the water and that's about it and I very rarely have food. I have a reloadable card that puts $40 on in when it gets down to $8. The last time it reloaded was March and it still has over $20 on it.  Debbe just recently started to make hers at home more often too. The local Timmies will probably have to lay off 6 part timers because of our cut back   I figure we are saving close to $2000 a year. Pretty decent reward for just eliminating one lazy habit.

416793,Fishnwire,2009-12-30 16:22:00,983,"I've never liked coffee, but I did buy make the payments on my quad by quiting smoking and using just the money I was spending on cigarettes to do it.  It worked out good because my wife coundn't say anything about the quad being too expensive and once I took it home I was extra committed to not smoking."
416795,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-30 16:27:00,2582, Let me know how long that lasts
416799,lew,2009-12-30 16:43:00,12766,"We buy the 925 gram can of Maxwell House for $5-$6 and even though I drink a pot every morning it's still waaaaaaaaay cheaper than Timmies, but when I'm travelling in the truck I probably spend more on Timmies than gas. I went to P'Boro & back yesterday and drank 2 large ones.  As for the cigarettes, I bought a new truck in '96 and though I didn't smoke, my wife still did and I told her she wasn't allowed to smoke in the new ride and she said ""OK, I'll only smoke in the 1/2 that I payed for""   Kinda tough to argue with that logic"
416800,danc,2009-12-30 16:47:00,4677,"  I have a lot of bad habits, but Timmies isn't one of them. I guess that we spend about $15 a month on coffee. Maybe double amount that for sugar, cream and electricity to make the stuff. If you're buying from a Timmies drive through, don't forget to add in the expense of fuel while idling in the long line up and for going out of your way to get there in the first place."
416805,blaque,2009-12-30 16:53:00,2419,"I did my math about a year ago and cut timmies out of the budget. Once in a while on the way to the river i grab one........especially if i have a soar throat brewing or something. But my daily timmies runs have gotten the axe.  Id do one every morning on the way in to work, one run for the office mid morning (thats ugly on its own with trying to keep track of whos turn it is.......) And once in a while on the way home. Id switch to ice caps in the summer lol.  I said enough was enough and havent looked back. Its way too easy to just look at a simple cup of coffee as no big deal.  I have a family member who has a STARBUCKS problem...........Mocha Frappacinos, You wanna talk about an investment. Take your timmies habit and replace it with starbucks prices. She came over christmas morning with one in her hand.........she was late and everyone knew where she was..........yup, out looking for an open Starbucks. She found one."

416810,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 17:06:00,0,"recently i got one of these machines:    even though it is still a little more expensive than a home brewer, i think it makes much better coffee than tims or regular pot coffee.  i use both the k-cups and a reusable filter.  i was a tim horton's slave.  the only problem i have now is that i always have WAY too much change in my pockets!"
416813,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 17:19:00,8163, It is quite obvious that you've never drank a cup of Waffle House coffee... it's the Best!!!
416815,Tybo,2009-12-30 17:30:00,1373,Haven't had a waffle house coffee in 20 year.And you are right. I was working in Kansas.The first morning I show up with a Duncan's coffee The Foreman gaps it .Pourer's it out. They had a big heater pot there full of Waffle house coffee. For the next 3 weeks I eat breakfast at the waffle house.
416819,bassjnkie,2009-12-30 17:47:00,1101,"I cut out Timmies coffee/food a year ago, I was spending $10 a day, $300 a month. Now I have more $$$ for fishing and hunting, I don't drink, but if I can only cut out smoking."
416820,bigbuck,2009-12-30 17:49:00,2449,"Scary isn't it to see how east it is to blow a few hundred bucks a month just on coffees. I have a timmies home brewer that really is the best coffee maker. Paired with the PC coffee in the gold can it takes 2 minutes to make a pot of great coffee even when I'm in a rush. You'd be amazed to know how many people look me in the eye and tell me they can't afford to put away 500 bucks a month to save for their own future not to mention their kids. So we do some simple math and calculate how much is spent on coffee and bagels and the like along with eating out at restaurants. When they actually see that over 1k a month is being blown it is a rude awakening. That's how the wife and I were able to buy the trailer and boat this year. We don't eat out often, besides I'm sick of paying a lot of money for food that I know I can make much better for less than a third of the price at home. But for God's sake everyone, save for your retirement, I have a few clients who did not and they barely have enough money to eat and put a roof over their heads."
416823,Swan_Dive,2009-12-30 18:05:00,46,"Iam a huge fan of making my own coffee but I usually only drink one or two cups a day.  The reason I like making my own coffee is to make up for the money my wife spends at starbucks!  Not that starbucks isn't good and I do have one from time to time but it is a little painful paying for it.  As for the waffle house coffee, I have only eaten there a few times and I don't know if their coffee even compares to tim hortons!  But Canadians are pretty loyal to Tim Horton's!!"
416826,Whopper,2009-12-30 18:13:00,2174," Who da thunk it, you being the rum pucker ya are. I would have thought you were a high test man   I have a Timmies and Starbucks just minutes from my house and never been to either place. I make most of what I drink except for the first cup (.79) every morning just to get me to work. I do however drink a ton of coffee, two 12 cup pots a day. Never did get the Timmies/Starbuck thing let alone pay those prices. Not saying I've never been to a Timmies before because if Deg is with me with can't pass one"
416830,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-30 18:30:00,10439,"I spend about $25 a month on whole expresso beans and chocolate to make my morning mocha. Before I got my grinder and expresso machine my morning coffee was $6 a day or about $120/month. The machines have already paid for themselves 3 or 4 times over!! Not only that, I figured out that I make a way better mocha than 95% of the coffee houses out there now."
416843,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 19:01:00,8163," I love the high test, but the bod won't let me do it anymore, I can't even drink more than one Pepsi a day unless it has alcohol mixed with it.  That's my best excuse and I'm sticking with it!"
416924,yakpiker,2009-12-30 23:19:00,160,"I've accepted that I'll never make enough money to pay for ALL of my wants, but my needs are being met which makes me feel fortunate.  It's easy to play the math game when it comes to spending.  If you REALLY LOVE coffee then I say drink what you want and screw the cost.  That goes for anything that you just can't live without...like fishing!  Personally, I buy a bag of ground beans from Starbucks and make a big mug each morning.  It saves me money and time compared to walking down the street to stand in line."
