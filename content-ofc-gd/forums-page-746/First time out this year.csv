We just put it out off the North Bay shore in about 10 fow, once I trust the ice more, we'll pull it out to deep water point with the truck. No real luck for walleye or pike, but we did catch dozens of perch, alot of nice jumbos that fried up real good.  We did just as good on Saturday as well, allthought it was freezing cold, most of the fishing was done from the shack, and even then our holes were freezing over.  Sorry for the lack of pics, left the cam in the sleigh, and though I forgot it on land."
