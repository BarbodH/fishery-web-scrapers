417307,TDunn,2009-12-31 22:59:00,680,"Had the afternoon free today and decided to hit the ice solo. Slow start, pretty much just drilled holes and went into search mode. I never did get on to anything much the first hour and but by 2:00 pm I had found some fish that were very finicky. I was fishing agressive with jigging raps and spoons with not much luck so I decided to slow it down and fish some forage minnows with live minnows. Needles to say I found out very quickly this was a much better approach. The action wasnt fast and furious, I had to really use my vex and coax the fish into biting. Perch, Crappie, Largemouth and Northern Pike were caught today....  Best panfish for the day     Beautiful pike caught on a 32 inch ultra light with 4# line. It took me a solid 20 minutes to land this fish...measured in at a bit over 38 inches That is all my blood by the way....she got me but well worth it...    Going back       It was a great way to end 2009... Good luck to everyone in the new year  TDunn"
