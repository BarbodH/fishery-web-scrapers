Anyone own one of these units and if so what card are you running, navionics gold, silver or navionics hotmap premium. Problem is the hotmap does not have st. clair on it and I want it. I fish the Trent, Kawarthas and St. Clair mostly. Help! I know Jocelyn in Woodstock will guide me but would like to hear some other opinions. Thanks Landry"
