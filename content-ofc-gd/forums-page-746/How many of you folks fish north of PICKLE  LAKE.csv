417496,endless,2010-01-01 05:50:00,27,I lived in Pickle for a few years flying food to the natives.  The fishing was the best I've ever seen in that area.  Legit limits of any species you wanted in 5 minutes. That was from shore too.  If you had a boat it was truly out of this world.  Another thing out of this world was the bugs.  Anyone who hasn't lived in the true North (read 5hrs + north of Thunder Bay) can't even begin to imagine what I'm talking about.

They were the towns that I could get out to and get some laundry done and have a shower. If I was lucky I could get to one of them at least once every 6 weeks.  Sounds lovely doesn't it??  Any how, I used to cover ALL the reserves and indian settlements from the Manitoba border to Hudsons Bay to James Bay and like I said previously south to Pickle and Red Lake.  I managed to do a fair bit of fishing over the course of the 2 years up there and in some cases it blew your mind away, in other cases, the fishing I have now on Gullrock is far superior to some lakes up there."

417664,NAW,2010-01-01 20:13:00,4022," My family lived there for 10 years or so during that time.  My old man was the liquor store manager    He was also a paramedic, fireman, and avid fisherman.  I was too young to fish, but the old man would never come home empty handed.  I'd like to go on a fishing/hunting trip there sometime, but i hear it's a little rough there now.."
