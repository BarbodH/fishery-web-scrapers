417618,spinnerdoc,2010-01-01 18:42:00,556,"hello just wanted to ask you guys if you know of any guides that you could recommend. i have never hired a guide before, and would like to experience it. i would like to go for steelhead and salmon. is spring a good time to hit the niagara river?  and also if you could share your experience with the fishing in the river itself is a lot of help. i fished the gorge once and i was skunked. wasn't used to fishing that kind of current.  thanks for any info guys....tight lines"
