418016,FSNmachine,2010-01-03 00:45:00,22,Mine will last 5 or 6 hours. I try to turn it off from time to time and usually make the camera usable most of a full day on the ice.
418018,Fisherman,2010-01-03 00:48:00,7201,"If I remember correctly, I think they last from 4-7 hours, depending on the temps, in todays cold temps, probably not more than 4 hours.  Your battery could probably do with an initial 12-18 hour charge depending on the charger(Idon't know what you have).  You can of course get larger batteries but they won't fit inside the case.  Those 12V 7 amp gell cells are about as good as it gets, no worry of tipping over and dumping acid on anything."

418039,duber,2010-01-03 02:02:00,220,"About 4 hrs is all i get out of mine sitting on the ice.Try   bringing a piece of 1""styrafom for it to sit on.It will last a little longer."
418042,vinnimon,2010-01-03 02:27:00,2593,I keep it in a hut with some heat.Not much.Maybe some body warmers under it will give it extra time.BBut that would bring up the cost up in the long run.A spare battery Would bring it up to 8 hours min on cold day.Thats what I will do.Thanks everyone for input on the topic.
