417936,musky66,2010-01-02 20:01:00,273,"Have heard from my son and a co-worker- two deaths last night at the bottom of Cooks Bay at Pasadena Marina. One sled hit the break-wall, and another collided with a pickup- two separate incidents I think but close together both in time and distance. My coworker was up all night as he had to deal with his son and family that knew the one lad, my son knew him as well. I think my fellow worker also was on the scene and helped Police and EMS get them off the ice. haven't seen it on the news yet."

417975,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-02 22:51:00,10439,Sad indeed. I heard about two deaths on tonights news. The one was the young fellow that hit the pickup. No mention of the breakwall incident. There was also a fellow killed when his sled went through the ice on a lake North East of Simcoe.  Our ice in Yellowknife has been safe since mid November but I steer clear until Christmas so the current and spring areas are safer. There are several spots I won't go near even in February though.
