394077,RsX,2009-10-18 14:27:00,48,"well said dan only thing that gets me is the way these people do to the females cut,egg, on the ground than people walk by see this and they hate fisherman i heard people walking by and cursing fisherman cause the dead females. it's a conversation that can go both ways as we can see in this thread but as in hunting you make your catch presentable so why don't salmon get the same respect at least hide them in the bush  so how long do the salmon spawn for i seen them at the humber 2 weeks ago so iam guessing they spawn for 3 weeks than the males die do the females to?? or they go back to the lake?"
394228,canadadude,2009-10-19 01:19:00,769,"They all die, a few more weeks the dead will be gone and you will never know a salmon run was even in the tributary."
394235,canadadude,2009-10-19 01:26:00,769,"This is Lake Ontario not northern Superior, Chinooks provide a fishery in Southern Ontario, without Pacific Salmon or introduced Rainbows and Browns the lake would not have much of a fishery at all."
417620,MelJepp,2010-01-01 18:50:00,3," Actually Glenn as I recall we did cut open a lot of chinooks in the two chinook collecting seasons (07-08) I was present for. Sometimes we were worried about being short on eggs or the skein wasn't loose enough to release the eggs. I also remember walking down around that big bend and finding all the rotting carcasses.  I can't see your practices changing any.  Maybe it was the Coho carcasses that were found. They are cut open as a method to extract eggs.  Also Glenn, I do not recall all the fish we processed to be dead while processing. I also recall fish being killed, being left in the sun and being wasted because they had been dead too long. A picture or video is worth a thousand words my friend."
417891,Guest steel'n'esox,2010-01-02 16:22:00,0,"  In with drifter on that one, big river with lots of Salmon within target of millions of people spells disaster. It is a beautiful river on the plus side from the cadet dam north just wish it was somewhere else"
417924,canadadude,2010-01-02 18:53:00,769,"Back in the 70's it was a snaggers dream dudes, the bait shops use to sell weighted trebles just for this purpose untill they were outlawed. The salmon run will always cause crap, it wasn't any better back then probably worse. Unfortunatly it is what it is and for some reason people love hooking into old dead boots on there last legs of life and others will get all upset with someone killing a useless 3/4 dead salmon."
392778,StoneFly,2009-10-14 01:39:00,574,"When people I dont know that well ask me where to catch Salmon and Steelhead I always tell them Erindale park....lol, mainly becasue I dont fish there.  I have been there a few times when I lived in the area and actually spent more time in the water unhooking other 'anglers' snagged salmon and releasing them than I did fishing.  Now some people may think this is asking for trouble,...but when you tell them they are breaking the law, there is usually no objection.  I have done this literally dozens of times without ever having anyone argue with me, my thought is they ALL know what they are doing is wrong and after you have talked to them while they are fighting the stuggling fish and tell them what they are doing is illegal, not too mention a few points on the potential toxicity of the Lake O nooks, I think the point is usually driven home, so when you are releasing their fish for them, they have already been conditioned for it.  Ive cut a few lines as well on other tribs, but thats a different story, lol.  Last weekend at a different Lake O trib, we actually saw a guy and his 2 kids walking down the river with Just nets, no rods at all.  So My buddy starts yelling at them and telling them they are breaking the law and he just saw a CO and they will be charged,.....so the Adult starts speaking in another language and then the kids Chime in perfect english, we were just checking the depth,...lol  meanwhile they had a fishfinder with them and a Hibatchi already lit,...LMAO.  I dont know if anyone remembers the Pine River about 20 years ago,....but I saw the Worst there!!!  Wire Fencing strung accross sections of river with treble hooks all through it, I wasnt an angler then, but was just taking a walk with my GF and saw these guys carrying out garbage bags fool of chinnies.  It was the first time I had seen big Fish like that in such tiny rivers and then I saw how they were being caught.  Obviously this didnt make me want to pick up that sport anytime soon.  I heard charges were laid a week later, wish it happened more down here"
392797,Twocoda,2009-10-14 02:03:00,4130, I actually do the same thing ...Erin Park used to be one of my favourite spots and i have many great memories of fishing  there ...just this last weekend ...a fellow OFNer was up here and i said he should try the park out ( but i did give him a specific location ) and he MIGHT only have to contend with a few fisherman....  I do the same thing...good on ya   i remember it and seen the same scenario  again on the nine mile river.....hence the reason i carry a leatherman ever since they came out...( same original one too) probably worth money now)..fortunately i havent  had to use it in many years for the purpose of cutting wire...
392928,canadadude,2009-10-14 16:12:00,769,"Resent egg collection has gone on for ringwood hatchery, eggs and sperm are collected the fish are sliced and thrown back in the river, not all the carcasses may from unethical anglers, unfortuntatly if we want a Salmon fishery we must do egg collection. It will be all over soon boys and trouting will begin."
392935,fish_finder,2009-10-14 16:34:00,370, Can't say I've ever heard that one before.
392939,GBW,2009-10-14 16:44:00,8460,I can't wait for one of the folks that helped out this year to respond to that... http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=36722
392966,I'mHooked,2009-10-14 18:38:00,525,  I can't be the only one who sees that as being completely unlikely.
393037,StoneFly,2009-10-14 22:28:00,574," Im no expert on this, however, I believe they shock the waters so the fish get temporarily stunned, they find some loose females with nice looking genes and simply milk the eggs, then collect Milt from the males.  Im pretty Sure all fish go back unharmed.  Clofchik can probably chime in on this...."
393073,Oncoryncus,2009-10-15 00:00:00,3,"Correct, Chinooks are electrofished. We do kill thhem however as most of them are too big to handle alive, plus it's inhumane to extract eggs from live fish in the manner that we do.  They are not cut open, instead eggs are extracted with air pressure and sperm extracted by squeezing the males near the vent.  Most carcasses are put back into the river although some do go to University of Guelph for virology testing and some to the DFO for toxicology and other tests. All of this happens at the Streetsville dam, I doubt any make it back down to Erindale."
393098,Richard S.,2009-10-15 00:44:00,75,Most fish collect down stream at the first pool south of the dam on the inside eddy.    Rich.
393103,StoneFly,2009-10-15 00:52:00,574," Curious, is it Illegal to lift a loose Chiney and collect the eggs in a baggie then let her go?  no more handling then lifting it to take a pic or 2?  If you guys kill them,...and I know this may sound odd,..but why not bring the truck load of Fresh Dead Fish down to Erindale and just put up a sign ""Free Fish'  maybe there will be less snagging?  I mean there are coutless people that eat them anyways....Barf as it is...just a thought"
393106,Oncoryncus,2009-10-15 01:05:00,3,"  I don't think it's illegal, maybe unethical to some tho....  I dig the idea of bringing the dead fish down to Erindale and we`d be glad to provide them to anyone who wants to pick them up and drive them down. The Ringwood volunteers don`t have time or energy left to pull it off though!"
393394,fishermccann,2009-10-15 19:45:00,655,"I hope that all who said that you did not put the dead fish back in the water are going to say, sorry, they were wrong(mistaken)!!!!!!!!!! They seemed so sure it did not happen."
393407,misfish,2009-10-15 20:02:00,29133,"Stonefly,did you ever meet the big guy that lived on the Pine?Big ol burlly type. Funny you mention about 20 years ago,as this is when he had a run in with a bunch of night baggers.He took some lumps,but managed to call the police and they were caught. One year later,the pine was closed off in this area. To bad. Some nice pools and good fishing."
393459,RsX,2009-10-15 22:40:00,48,another place is old mill / humber river when i went there last week to walk the dog on the trail wow that place is jammed packed there is a sign no fishing at dam and people are fishing there
393643,StoneFly,2009-10-16 13:15:00,574," No I dont think so, I was 17 at the time and my memory is a little Foggy, lol.  It was near Everett if thst helps."
393644,[emailÂ protected],2009-10-16 13:18:00,290,I love when people delete my posts!
393654,I'mHooked,2009-10-16 13:55:00,525,     Are you referring to me? Do they slice the fish? I can see where you may have been confused.
393973,danjang,2009-10-17 22:41:00,148,"Just came back from erindale today. It was my first time fishing the river. Few salmon were being caught, mostly snagged of course. Some nice rainbows are making it up now. This one guy caught a pretty sweet one. Right before I was leaving I saw at least 10 people surrounding the fish in a circle, half with waders half on the rocks tossing their lines right on top of a lonely salmon to snag. It was hilarious seeing that many people chucking their lines getting all tangled up with each other. Most of the living salmon I saw looked horrible. I don't see why people would keep such a thing. The tails were white, it looked like it had been half cooked yet people still took them home."
393981,chandru,2009-10-17 23:39:00,63,"wow really hot topic! i wonder how many of the salmon actually get to do their business having to fight the current coming up the current and all the anglers attacking them! seems so useless to just cut one up, steal the eggs, and set it to be carried away by the same current it fought so hard to beat. it is sad."
394011,danjang,2009-10-18 01:44:00,148,"The weirdest thing though, I saw many male carcasses on the shore. Most of them look like they haven't been cut up. Whats up with that? The water dropping is possibility but some are pretty far in. Just doesn't make sense"
394020,RsX,2009-10-18 02:26:00,48,yea that is very werid i seen lots of males to they can't tell the difference??
394033,canadadude,2009-10-18 04:34:00,769,"Guys Salmon die after they spawn, there in the last few days of life right now. The carcasses are from fish who have lived there life, completed the cycle and are now dead and rotting giving there nutrients back to earth. It makes complete sense it's the end of the circle of life for the  Salmon"
394035,danc,2009-10-18 05:36:00,4677,"Wow. All this rage over in introduced species that is heavily dependent on stocking. We have Chinooks flooding our rivers in the fall up here too. Fortunately it's not an elbow to elbow snagfest up here. What really bothers me is when I see Salmon crowding out Brook Trout for spawning beds. Brook Trout need very specific areas to spawn upon. Chinnys don't. Several times I've witnessed stocked Chinooks crowding out resident Coaster Brook Trout on a 3 foot square spawning area that the Brookies demand. It's a sickening sight actually. To me anyways. Apparently this is what our fishery has become. Screw the endangered trophy coaster Brook Trout. Because the Pacific Salmon grow bigger and fight harder. And if  you've got a $40,000.00 boat, you can go catch them all summer long. Most of us don't own a $40,000.00 boat, hence the snagfest in southern Ontario. Man kinds wisdom has screwed this planet beyond belief. Thankfully I'll live out my life and be content catching natural fish that have been here for tens of thousands of years. I'll be content with that. The rest of you can argue about abusing fish that should have never been here in the first place. Anyone want to buy some scented marshmallows???"

392491,mbosh1980,2009-10-13 14:51:00,349,"Hey yall, I just got back from 3 hrs at erindale park.  Was trying to look for steelhead.  Not sure if they are up or not yet, I have a feeling I was early.  Managed to tailhook a dead salmon on my first drift...barf! Oh and it had been sliced open and just thrown in the water by the way. Then I went to the shale cliff area...more dead salmon...also butchered and left to rot.  Found one not far away completely fileted. What is wrong with people? I actually saw a few live salmon but they looked in rough shape.  I made the choice not to cast anywhere near them.  It didn't really seem sporting, you know? Actually for how long i was down there I think i must have only done a dozen or so casts. Lots of litter down there...threw out someones trashed net and a bunch of cups and cans on my way out. All in all a pretty sad day.  Made me sort of ashamed to be carrying a rod down there as most of the mess was obviously angler related. I don't think I'm ever going river fishing in fall again.  Personal choice.  On the plus side I saw a deer from about 15 ft away.  I somehow snuck up on it as I was going through some brush.  Not sure who was more suprised... And I got to have a nice chat with some older ladies who came to watch the salmon.  It was nice to be able to share some of my (very very very limited) knowledge with them, and we all must have went on about other topics for about 20 mins or so. So hopefully I gave them a positive interaction with an angler.  take er easy!   "
392492,GBW,2009-10-13 14:55:00,8460,sad indeed.

The place to fish would be the clay banks.There, snaggers were jumped on right away,and would leave the area,to snag somewhere else."

Fishing was actually pretty good with browns and bows with the later running Coho back then a bonus, crowd wise in Nov. and Dec. no worse than Thornbury, both in numbers and idiots. I've recently retired and thought I would give it a go again as it would be within my capablities health wise.

The public will infer that all anglers are pigs thanks to the actions of a select few.  I don't like being painted with the same brush as those people, and judging by your reaction neither do you. "
