Did a little work on the basement, (no it's still not done Hometown  ) picked my wife up at her job and decided that with no other plans for us or our son we figured we'd go out...either for dinner or take the coin for eating out and go to a casino for a change of pace.  Eating out was voted for 2:1, I lost. Tried King's Buffet in Stoney Creek but it was packed and the line up was long. Next choice, Black Forest Inn for some great German food. They also had a wait but a beer helped to pass the 40 minute time span and while sitting with drinks a fella from work and his family enters the restaurant . Then right behind him is my niece and her boyfriend! What a small world. We ended up getting a table before the others at a booth and had the waitress get my niece and her friend come over and squeeze in.  We all had too much too eat and it was cheaper than the buffet including the beverage. Then it was back home to watch that great Can./U.S hockey game and the dropping of the Times Square ball and the Niagara Falls festivities.  A happy and great 2010 to all."

I think it was the right call...now I feel healthy enough for some fishing on Chemong today, heading out shortly."

Just a couple of years ago I used to do New Year's Eve up like I was a rock star...that was fun, but I don't really miss it.  This way is a lot cheaper too!"
