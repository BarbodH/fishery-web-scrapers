416797,dks,2009-12-30 16:32:00,36,I just confirmed over the phone that non residents will be charged $10 to park at the lot in Innisfil. That's life I suppose.
416816,Terry,2009-12-30 17:33:00,14456,crap........
416817,Governator,2009-12-30 17:42:00,879,Yea they released a press release about that a few days ago (At least that's when I read it).  They claim it's because of the amount of garbage left behind from ice fishing the costs are too great for them to carry and the public has to pay for it.  There are other places in the area you can go for free mind you.
416828,Mike Pike,2009-12-30 18:20:00,1332,I still don't get why only non-residents has to pay.  I guess the township wants a money grab and that's the only way the redidents would alow it to pass.
416846,GBW,2009-12-30 19:06:00,8460,so what if you are visiting a local and you 2 or 3 decide to get out on the ice for a bit. better make him drive I guess...
416854,Terry,2009-12-30 19:21:00,14456,if anyone has an extra resident permit they would like to give me feel free to PM me
416856,ckrb2007,2009-12-30 19:24:00,449,"I'm sure the residents will have to pick up a window sticker just like they have in the spring/summer. I know where I WONT be going to park now........or, i can just get my Alcona friend who doesn't ice fish to grab me a sticker."
416858,irishfield,2009-12-30 19:24:00,26272, Give Chuck a ring.. before he sticks it on his windshield !!
416875,skeeter,2009-12-30 20:29:00,1907,does anyone know what the times are for parking there: open & close ? and can you park there overnight? for those of us that stay out in a sleeper hut ! thanks guys
417018,Woodsman,2009-12-31 02:18:00,1286,Well ain't that tourist friendly? Well if it's a money problem lets let them think on this!!!! Boycott spending MONEY in the Town of Innisfil. For those who don't know the Town extends south of Gilford and further west than the 400. Our only vote there is our $$$$$ When the local businesses suffer maybe they will realize that tourist money is important. Until then they can forget my contributions.
417020,danbouck,2009-12-31 02:21:00,4380,Seems reasonable.
417024,Terry,2009-12-31 02:26:00,14456,"the problem with that is  keswick has no parking signs everywhere and even lots of no parking with trailer signs  Willow beach has removed lake access points and no parking signs as Jacksons point has  we are running out of locations to park and get on the lake..if we want to fish simcoe,I do, then we need to go somewhere"
417200,LeXXington,2009-12-31 17:23:00,1928,Just find a place close and walk.  $10 is a little expensive to catch a few perch  -- now plow the roads and offer rides on the ice for $5.00  You have to wonder the more $$ it cost to go fishing how long till you just decide its cheaper to stay home and play video games.  Fishing was the poor man's sport until they figured they could tax it to death
417204,glen,2009-12-31 17:40:00,2641,Parking spaces down.  Fish stocks on the rise.    
417205,icedude,2009-12-31 17:41:00,459,Too True LeXX--will check out SPPP-Sibbalds Point Provincial Park as a potential venue and advi$e  Happy New Year All  here's to new friendships--laughs--learning and of course  FISH ON!  Cheers  ID1  www.lake-simcoe.ca
417813,fishboy,2010-01-02 04:01:00,550, Are there any street parking options? I don't mind walking a bit...I walk out to the fishing grounds.
417914,buckster,2010-01-02 18:05:00,530,  Hey i wouldn't mind one of them lol
417922,Lake Ranger,2010-01-02 18:48:00,70,"FYI.. Maybe get a P.O. Box number from the local Post Office, mail yourself something and leave it in your truck! Worked for me for years after I moved from Innisfil.  Now I just park at the LCBO parking lot. Haven't been ticketed or towed yet! Best of luck!"
