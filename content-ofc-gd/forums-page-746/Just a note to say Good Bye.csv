417873,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-02 15:18:00,3761, That's what I was thinking lol
417876,majorlifts,2010-01-02 15:32:00,171,"It must be very serious, and I am sorry for that, but you know you are a great fisher, and everyone here enjoyed all the pics and all the great stories. So Take good care of yourself and watch your top knot."
417885,oxcowboy,2010-01-02 16:04:00,544,"I sure hope you dont make this permanent ! I have always enjoyed reading your post and viewing all the pics in your fabulous reports. By all means take some time off if you need to but please still drop in from time to time. You will be missed by all, and thank you for adding so much to the greatness of this community.  jason"

417903,Marty,2010-01-02 16:52:00,873,"Carole,  I wish you all the best.   You know we'll always be here so if and when you make it back, we'll be waiting."

417950,ScugogBoy,2010-01-02 21:20:00,36,Miss Bly.....also sorry to see you leaving the Board...enjoyed your tales of fishing.....but why don't you tell the good people of this Board why you are leaving...I'm sure others are curious as well...I see you have not left as you keep logging back on but do not post...What's Up?
417956,Terry,2010-01-02 21:42:00,14456, I am sure if she wanted to give more info she would have
417958,Spiel,2010-01-02 21:46:00,9065,"You know at times it floors me how insensitive some can be!  We've had members come and go, some leave quietly and some come on board to say goodbye. Perhaps it's because they would like to inform friends that they'll need to seek another avenue to stay in touch, whatever. Is that so wrong? For those who feel the need to piss on this I suggest you find another avenue to vent.  If you have nothing nice to say, shut-up!"
417959,Roy,2010-01-02 21:48:00,13728,"OK. Both Carole and Cliff are good friends here.  They both have contributed more to this community than most. Those of you who want to talk to them, either phone them or email them. If you have neither of those numbers/addresses, it's probably not important. Please leave them alone. Thanks."
417561,Bly,2010-01-01 15:33:00,1556,I have enjoyed being part of this community over the past few years and met many wonderful people.   I am very sadden to say though that I must say good bye.

417567,Roy,2010-01-01 15:41:00,13728,Carole!!! Say it ain't true!  PM me.
417568,solopaddler,2010-01-01 15:41:00,8605,"This is new years day and not April fools right? Sounds serious, I sure hope you're joking."
417587,ChrisK,2010-01-01 16:38:00,2772,"Carole, Hope all is well We will always be here for you if you decide to come back....  Happy New Years"

That combined with your wonderful ability to make one and all feel welcomed will be sorely missed in these parts. Whatever the reasons, I wish you well."

Hope that you reconsider.... Leechman

Myself and daughter included.  And as a good man once told me:  "" if it is a good idea Today, it will still be a good idea tomorrow""   Think this thru a little....  no explanations will ever be required.
