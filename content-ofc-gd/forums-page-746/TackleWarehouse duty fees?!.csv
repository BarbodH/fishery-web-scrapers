417426,mojobass,2010-01-01 03:07:00,34,Okay I was wondering if anyone here had a experience of ordering fishing tackle from TackleWarehouse and be charged with duty fees coming back to Ontario. I have just order my first batch of items I wanted and now going for the second batch but my girlfriend pointed out the duty fee issue. I was wondering if anyone know how it works and about how much it would be for about $130 worth of stuff? Any help or replies will be greatly appreciated! Happy new years!

Amazing thing to me...I placed my order online and paid with paypal on a Monday and the baits arrived at my front door the next day on Tuesday. Just unreal. They were delivered by UPS and the total charge was $15.23. Not bad at all imo except for the fact the courier wouldn't allow me to pay with cash or credit card, only cheque. (New system with UPS that's being tried out in our area alone).  Long winded reply but the bottom line I was impressed and wouldn't hesitate recommending these guys at all. Great service and the duty/taxes were minimal."

SOLO it seems as they were in a great mood I have never seen a UPS charge less then $30 as that is usually there broker fees maybe they did not clear that load or something who knows either way it was a bonus for you.

417601,scuro2,2010-01-01 17:44:00,904,If the total bill is $40 dollars or less and you have them send it through regular US mail there is no tax. US mail is more expensive so I'm not sure how much savings there is going that route.
417636,EC1,2010-01-01 19:22:00,930,"Shipping went much cheaper than it was last year. It used to be 29.99 for any 1 package whether it be a rod or a box of baits. This year, even a one piece rod is going for $15 on the shipping."
