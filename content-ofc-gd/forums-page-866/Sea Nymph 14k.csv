329388,duckdog,2009-04-13 00:29:00,162,"I now have a sea nymph 14k, its rated for a 15hp anyone have or had one of these? what did or do you have on it for hp? I would love to keep my mariner its just bin a great motor and I put more money into then I am going to get out off lol, I know not to go over the rated hp but man I am at a toss up here. Anyways any experience with these boats?"
329426,GeorgeJ,2009-04-13 01:52:00,207,I'd go the max hp but if your Mariner is more than the max rated 15hp I wouldn't use it. Going over may cause insurance and legal issues.
329430,irishfield,2009-04-13 01:53:00,26272,"Max HP rating on a boat in Canada is purely ""suggested"". No law against ignoring it... other than the common sense one.."
329431,duckdog,2009-04-13 01:59:00,162,"Lol, Wayne I did not realize that, no common sense I gues lol, so whats your thoughts on a 20hp on that boat? No I would hold you liable lol, pm me if you dont want to post it here :-)"
329433,irishfield,2009-04-13 02:03:00,26272,I'd have to see it first.. but don't think the 20 would be a big deal over a 15.  Had a nymph in for repairs last week though... not the toughest built hulls. Didn't pay much attention to the transom to give you a definitive thought on the matter.
329434,duckdog,2009-04-13 02:06:00,162,"Thanks bud, I am going to replace the transom wood anyways so I can beef that up, I would love to keep my 20hp, so I may just be taking the for sale sign down :-)"
329437,GeorgeJ,2009-04-13 02:15:00,207,"well here is what I based my answer on, my new boat I recently purchased was rated at 25hp max, the dealer had a deal on some 30 hp Mercs, he said I would have to buy the boat and engine separately and install the motor myself because they cannot install a motor on boat that is over the max rated hp of the boat. ALso a friend of mine had a boat with a over rated hp engine and he had great difficulty obtaining insurance for that boat. I think if ever there was a accident in a boat with an over rated motor there could be issues raised, I wouldn't want to take the chance, but hey to each his own..."
329442,irishfield,2009-04-13 02:23:00,26272,No arguement George... just stating there's no law against it. Ie the OPP or Coast Guard cannot fine/charge you for having a 300 Verado on a 275HP rated boat. Marina may have a rule for themselves to avoid any liablity issues at their end and the insurance company... I have a First Mate package and their only issue before writting coverage was whether the boat could do more than 50 MPH and I said no it's too darn heavy and the writter said that's what he thought as well!
329443,duckdog,2009-04-13 02:27:00,162,"I thank you guys for your input, it does help quite a bit, I am not interested in how fast it will go, just I know how the motor runs and all the parts I put in it, so I may just try it out with the 20hp as soon as ice is out"
329444,GeorgeJ,2009-04-13 02:28:00,207,"  I think I worry too much sometimes, that said if I had a boat rated for 15hp and I also had a good 20hp I would put them together and use them."
329445,irishfield,2009-04-13 02:30:00,26272,Nelson.. this is the general formula used for max HP rating of boats in the USA  (2 X L X W) -90 = rated horsepower  So based on that if that 14'r is 5 feet wide supposably you could put a 50 on it. I wouldn't try it... lol
329447,2 tone z71,2009-04-13 02:34:00,1311,"had a 14 SN oh 5-6 yrs ago ,nice lil boat ,was too narrow and small for me and my linebacker buddys haha, got a brand new 30 Yamaha from Temagami Marine  for it ,lil sucker flew was not in any way scary"
329448,duckdog,2009-04-13 02:35:00,162,"Lol I dont mind pushing my luck sometimes and 5hp over I dont think I am pushing much, but 35hp over to funny I would need the boat on plane before I could drop the 50hp on lol"
329636,BUSTER,2009-04-13 20:44:00,1336,  lol  iam sure it'll go faster than 50mph wayne!  but once you add all your gear and danno plus yourself its a different story!
329662,glen,2009-04-13 22:04:00,2641,Some 15hp and 20hp motors are the same weight.  So as long as it is not a real heavy 20hp i would use it. Damage to the transom from too much force may happen.  I would make sure the transom is a strong as possible.  Or just dont open the throttle up all the way.  This saves gas too.
329688,Fisherman,2009-04-13 22:55:00,7201,"That must be the Tim Allen ""More Power"" formula, that would mean my 16' x 6'W could potentially have a 100HP strapped to it..don't think so."
329698,irishfield,2009-04-13 23:12:00,26272,Formula actually works well for wide transoms.  Like my Lund  (22.8 x 8 x 2) -90 = 275HP which is exactly what it's rated at. I know it's the forumla Boston Whaler uses.
329744,musky66,2009-04-13 23:55:00,273,I had a sweet Sea Nymph- bigger 14' tinny- maxed it out with a 25 hp Johnson- that thing would fly! Very safe and comfortable and could get off the lake in a hurry if needed. Would 5 extra horse have made a difference- might have pushed it over the edge!
