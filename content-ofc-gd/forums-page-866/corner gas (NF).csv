329751,Joeytier,2009-04-14 00:03:00,3990,"I'll gladly miss it.  I don't see the appeal in this show, at all."
329780,Fudd,2009-04-14 00:48:00,94,"This is such sad news, i actually get to watch this in Oz. One of the few shows here from home. I can't even watch the damn hockey on the net, Cbc does not let you stream it outside of Canada"

329929,pikehunter,2009-04-14 13:04:00,1659,"Best 1/2 hour sitcom on Canadian TV. It is indeed a sad passing. Nothing sophisticated about it, just simple well written laid back humour with lots of likable characters. No dirt, no sex, no cussing, no swearing just a show anyone can watch. My sister once told me that when she watches it she sees me on the screen and not Brent Butt, maybe that's why I like it  there seems to be a lot of me in his character, so I'm told. Guess we are all imposed somewhere on the idiot box.  Farewell Corner Gas, looks like I'll be watching you on DVD from now on."
