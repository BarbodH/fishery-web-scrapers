329872,EC1,2009-04-14 04:13:00,930,care to share where this ad is?
329904,Roy,2009-04-14 11:00:00,13728,That board is a landmark for me. It is on the North side of westbound HWY #17 just west of Sturgeon Falls.  ps. It's also on the north side if you're eastbound but you'll get a crick in your neck if you try to see it from that angle.
329908,lew,2009-04-14 11:07:00,12766," Me too Roy, once I pass that spot I know I'm only 30 minutes away  Won't be long now"
329923,Gerritt,2009-04-14 12:27:00,6129,It looks in much better repair then the last time I saw it! Seeing that sign lets me know that I am in the Near North.... ohhh and for some reason it reminds me of a large dude eating steaks off a plate..
