328565,ehg,2009-04-10 18:16:00,2666,"Seeing that most fishing is limited until end of the month, went out looking for snakes and enjoying the outdoors anyways. My 6 yr. old daughter loves this and is great at finding them.     Couldn't believe how many she spotted. Nice way to start the Easter weekend."
328572,Joey,2009-04-10 18:53:00,9122,"Cool, I think snakes are neat.  They eat rodents too, even better  Joey"
328573,OhioFisherman,2009-04-10 18:59:00,6623,"Cool! We find them in our yard all the time. Garter, ribbon and dekay`s snakes, still waiting to find something different.  I put them in our field out of the way of the lawn mower."
328588,Leecher,2009-04-10 19:45:00,7832,She must be really proud of being able to spot them and catch them.... good on her Leechman
328706,ehg,2009-04-11 01:51:00,2666," We actually found a Dekay's snake today and was surprised at how puny it was.  My daughter loves this outdoor stuff and being able to share her joy with this is the best. Can't wait for her to cast a spinning reel she is still at the Barbie rod/reel for panfish stage, but i love that too.  cheers, ehg"
328751,OhioFisherman,2009-04-11 03:46:00,6623,"Ya Dekay`s are just little guys, can`t really picture them eating anything but bug and worms."

328768,Cudz,2009-04-11 04:14:00,2652,Funny about 6 year olds.  When I was 6 I used to catch them by the hundreds.  Now I still catch them but I am really hesitant (no reason to be I jsut am).  It is funny how we have no fear when we are young. My 7 year old doesn`t touch them but my 6 year old and my 2 year old love them.  Go figure. I like your pic. Here is one of my 6 year old with a garter (she was 5 in this pic) 
329591,ehg,2009-04-13 17:29:00,2666,"Went with my father who came over this weekend to look for snakes again, found a bunch!   If you look closely the snakes defecating, my daughter thinks that's funny. LOL"
329596,bullybass,2009-04-13 17:54:00,144,Last year I caught one down the trail at Bowmanville Creek. My wife loved it as... when I picked it up... it apparently had a bodyguard. Somehow a fire ant got under the shirtsleeve of my t-shirt and began biting me as I picked up the snake!!! Swelled up immediately and hurt like hell. I don't think I will ever live that down.... hahaha
329601,Lunker777,2009-04-13 18:09:00,866,"I used to go for walks by a near by pond when I was younger... My dad would take me and we would go ""snake huntin"" hahah I would be divin into bushes and all sorts to get these little guys hahah I would come outta there with my fair share of bumps, bruises, and scrapes..... My best day I caught 11 !! Snakes are sweet !"
329646,Greencoachdog,2009-04-13 21:24:00,8163,"My 2 younger brothers and I were quite the snake hunter/catchers in our childhood!!!  We caught a 5 foot long Black Racer when I was only about 4'-6"" tall! You gotta be fast to catch one of those things! It took all 3 of us to chase that thing down and cath it, we chased it for a good half mile up the creek before we tired it out enough to catch it. We kept it as a pet for a couple months before letting it go for the winter. Mom was very cool about it and didn't mind a bit. Mom was working at the Dairy Bar when a lady came in and started telling her about the 3 crazy boys that had a huge Water Moccasin in a gallon jar at the little league game, Mom said ""Oh you must be talking about my 3 boys and their pet Black Racer... his name is Rastus!""  I also used to enjoy catching and playing with Hog-Nosed snakes, they can flare their neck out like a Cobra, wiggle their tails like a Rattlesnake... and if all that fails to scare you off the roll over on their backs and play dead!  Thanks for bringing back the memories Erik!!!    Fear of snakes is born out of ignorance!... You aren't that ignorant are you?"
329683,ch312,2009-04-13 22:49:00,1590,i guess i kinda like snakes...  an old pic from last year...shes about 3ft long and can eat rats now. on the laptop now but ill post some new pics some other time...

329827,ehg,2009-04-14 01:59:00,2666,"Nice little story there GCD! This snake catching is great fun for the kids as long as their not scared. I did have to handle these snakes first, sometimes these Gartners are a little snippy."
