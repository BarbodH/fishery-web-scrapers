329663,joefish,2009-04-13 22:04:00,165,Hence no pictures?  Good you got out!
329707,musky66,2009-04-13 23:25:00,273,"No ice to speak of, water seemed pretty green- visibility at about 4' maybe? did see a shore angler pull in a nice fish as we arrived- that was it for the action we saw today. Seemed like the speed of the backdift picked up noticeably in the afternoon- does the volume of water coming through the narrows vary due to power requirements or something??"
329798,Bondar,2009-04-14 01:16:00,817,"the current is ever changing in the lower river due to water flows for the power plants , intakes and dams the water can raise and lower 4 feet in no time at all it can be tough to figure out at times"
