Once again, I saw 2 trout (1 very silver, 1 kinda brown & purple) in the current before my ""secret pool"". Still not seeing any suckers at all, were suppost to have nice weather all nxt week so the water will be extremely clear.  *Oshawa Creek Update*"
329328,silvio,2009-04-12 22:11:00,433,I never thought Iâ€™d see the day we were getting sucker reports lol . They can be fun at times when all else is slow.

329337,silvio,2009-04-12 22:44:00,433,Your telling me lol when steelheading gets slow suckers are fair game lol.
329347,kemper,2009-04-12 22:59:00,2232, There could be 50 suckers in the bottom of the hole you are talking about without you seeing them  Seems like they arent there until the sun catches them the right way!
329360,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-12 23:27:00,3761, That's true...there are a few various spots there the bottom is dark in colour but I'm still not sure if it's fish or not. I'll be out tomorrow to do some fishing recon.

329376,kemper,2009-04-12 23:51:00,2232,  If  you are lookin for suckers keep that spot in mind that  I told you earlier.  Just dont be down there on the week of opener or you will hate every minute
329462,KelfuN,2009-04-13 03:03:00,246,wilmot is getting a decent amount of suckers already.. i won't be surprised if the oshawa mouth is full of them
