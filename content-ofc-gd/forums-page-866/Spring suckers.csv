Armed with ultralites, carp corn (from Hammercarp) and synthetic roe and away we go. Only took 10 minutes to find the first pod. Now I do admit I'm a stubborn cuss and I shouldn't be working streams any more. I don't have adequate motor control in the legs, But we've been doing this for years. I hook into the first sucker and one moment I'm on the bank, next instant I'm half in the stream. Serves me right  He was still worth it.  The daughter did camera duty while the son and I caught a few more.       It was fun just to be together without a care in the world, even if Dad is a putz. Still had a good laugh, and managed to keep the camera dry(I've drowned a few). Kept a couple of suckers for cat bait."
