329560,nancur373,2009-04-13 15:02:00,1211,"Non-Canadian Residents   Non-Canadian residents need an Outdoors Card to fish in Ontario if they are 18 years of age and over.  (NOTE: Non-residents 65 years of age or older are not exempt from requiring a licence).  The sportfishing licence tag (one year or eight day) or the conservation fishing licence tag (one year or eight day) accompanies the plastic Outdoors Card.    If you have never had an Outdoors Card, you can purchase a ""Non-Canadian Resident Temporary Fishing Outdoors Card and Application"" from one of more than 1,800 licence issuers across the province.  The Non-Canadian Resident Temporary Fishing Outdoors Card and Application does not include the fishing licence tag.  The fishing licence tag will be a separate paper permit.    The temporary Outdoors Card and paper licence are effective immediately.  Your plastic Outdoors Card will be mailed to you by year end, and is valid for three calendar years (including the year of purchase).    Non-Canadian resident hunters can also fish under the authority of their Outdoor Card (fishing/hunting version) with the appropriate fishing licence tag.    You can also get more information on the Outdoors Card by calling the Outdoors Card Centre at 1-800-387-7011.  This toll-free number works from all of North America, from Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time)."
