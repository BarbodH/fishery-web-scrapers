328930,ColdH20guy,2009-04-11 19:50:00,312,Hey guys Just had a browse on tromblys web site at their sale flyer for this upcoming weekends spring sale...looks pretty good if you're around Orillia next weekend..... www.tromblystacklebox.com
328974,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-11 21:44:00,947,I use to work there when i was younger for 4 years.  There sale price is ok but most of the stuff is way over priced
329108,ColdH20guy,2009-04-12 03:20:00,312,yeah I hear ya..dropped into Ellwood Epps on Hwy 11...awesome prices! will go back there for sure..
329172,fishboy,2009-04-12 13:36:00,550,the floatation suit price seems decent
329479,xeon,2009-04-13 08:42:00,350,"Ya everything seems a bit steep there, and anything that seems cheap (combos) are garbage. What got me was the firearms and crossbows they were trying to sell, waaay over priced.  Im actually surprised they can stay in business with prices like that when people have options like bass pro right around the corner. Does probably say something about their customer service though, they must be great haha."
329482,singingdog,2009-04-13 10:40:00,1047," NOT. My experience is that both prices AND attitude are high, service is incredibly low. I will still go in to check for deals, but I don't expect any kind of service or knowledgable staff."
329524,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-13 13:26:00,947,Yea living in Orillia and going to Bass Pro is like a 1hr drive.  It's ok if i need something last minute that's about it
329535,Beans,2009-04-13 13:48:00,3339,Eight years ago when I retired my co-workers chipped in and my boss purchased a $300 gift certificate for Trombly's in Orillia as he lived in Stroud and knew I liked to fish the Perch Festival in Orillia...  I priced everthing I purchased at Trombly's in the Le Baron catalouge and could have spent only about $200 for the same items...unfortunately I had no choice but to spend it all at Trombly's...
