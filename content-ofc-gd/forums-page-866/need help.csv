329993,Fisherman,2009-04-14 16:21:00,7201,"Easiest way to determine long or short..measure from the top of the transom to the bottom of the hull where you plan on mounting the motor.  15-16 inches is a short shaft, 20 inches give or take a bit is for a long shaft.  Remember that if you add a bracket that lowers the motor, you may end up flooding the motor with big waves that follow the boat."
