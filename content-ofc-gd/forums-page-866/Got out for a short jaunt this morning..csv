329274,Big Cliff,2009-04-12 19:19:00,6899,"Met up with Photoz for a bit but boy, the wind off of the lake was brutal. Showed him how to catch a sucker (and a branch) then headed out to see if I could find a more sheltered spot and a few perch. The wind was just as cold there but I did manage to catch about 8 keepers and a lot of dinks. By about 10 I admitted that I hadn't dressed as warm as I should have and Jim and I called it a day. I knew it was going to be an early one anyway because we had company coming for dinner. Anyway, it was nice to get out and see Photoz again even if it was a very quick trip. and catching a few fish was just a bonus."
329285,tinbanger,2009-04-12 19:54:00,1028,"good on ya for getting out.  Sunny but that wind is chilly , we caught 6 suckers in the creek at the back of our place.Was fun to feel a fish on the line. Cleaned up some of the brush behind the house and enjoyed a bit of a fire.  Love that sunshine  TB"
329310,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-12 21:09:00,2582,Good you got out. I would have happily joined you guys if I didn't have to work today.  I'm hoping for some fresh perch later in the week.
329318,bigugli,2009-04-12 21:32:00,6138,Good on you for getting out Cliff. Sure beats sitting inside.
329348,Photoz,2009-04-12 23:01:00,792,"After nearly freezing to death over at the harbour, and going to the Trent where you guys ended up, (the 35 klick breeze was JUST AS BAD there) I was about ready to pack it up too, shortly after you left. But . . .    I took Cliff's lesson on sucker fishing (you set your rod down, shoot the breeze for a bit, then pick it up and . .   PRESTO NEATO, a big ugly ol' sucker!) to heart and went back for a return match! It only took 15 minutes & I had my first one . .    by 3:00 I had managed 7. I just got finished weighing the biggest one . .     5.7 pounds!! Lotsa fun on a l'il panfish rod & reel & 4 pound line! I'ma goin' back in the morning. For anybody interested . . .    what I referred to as 'the harbour' is the mouth of the Beaver River . . .    loaded with B I I I  G white suckers . . .   hang about 9' of line under a slip float, use about a #6 or #8 pickerel hook & a big gob of worm & yer in business! North side parking lot  (right across from the boat ramp) is your best bet. (I don't think THIS post of a location for sucker fishin' that will be all over in another 2 weeks, will do any harm?)  P. S. Anybody who's familiar with the area where the Trent hits Simcoe have any clue when they will be putting a new swing bridge in? It sure must be a royal pain fro the residents!"
329354,ccmtcanada,2009-04-12 23:15:00,7971,Great report guys!  Glad to see a few fish caught in these winds.  Oh yeah Cliff...Sydney wanted to know when we'd see you next!!!  Gotta get Sue and Carole talking again or it wont happen...LOL.
329366,Leecher,2009-04-12 23:37:00,7832,"Nothing like a good few hours spent amongst friends, shooting the breeze and catching some fish to boot  Good on you guys for braving the element today Great report Cliff and thanks for sharing Leechman"
329369,Big Cliff,2009-04-12 23:39:00,6899,"The door is always open Cliff! You know you are welcome here anytime! It has been way too long since my last Sydney hug.  Steve, glad you managed to finally get some suckers. How did you do on the perch?"
329421,Beans,2009-04-13 01:39:00,3339, It should be dock launching time soon methinks...
329737,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-13 23:49:00,260, Tease
329747,Joey,2009-04-13 23:58:00,9122,"Yes, that was a biting wind today.  I imagine a wee bit cooler off the water too.  Hey, you got out there and caught a few and had some great company.  Sounds like a good outing to me  Joey"
329865,fishboy,2009-04-14 03:31:00,550,glad to hear you got out...those stick fish are one of my favourites too
329868,Greencoachdog,2009-04-14 03:52:00,8163,1. Look at the weather forecast before you leave!  2. Fish the leeward side of the lake!  3. Put on/take more clothing than you think you'll need!!! (easier to take it off than put it on if you don't have it!!!)     No one remembered their camera???
