329756,ColdH20guy,2009-04-14 00:20:00,312,thx..I wondered if there would be any 'eyes in there......

You never really know whats gonna take the bait since that is the channel is a transition between the main Gbay and Matchedash bay ... and pretty much everything has to swim past ... just be sure to read the regs ... not everything is open yet ..."
329806,ColdH20guy,2009-04-14 01:30:00,312,thanks..will do  are the gov't docks east or west of there? wasn't much driving access to the water to the west it seemed?
329843,camillj,2009-04-14 02:28:00,1988,Have a look on Google earth ... just about 1/4 mile north /east - it isnt a pier its is more of a concrete wall running parallel to the channel.
