They call them cats, and are the best big water boat i have ever used. The police, coastguard all use them here. I purchased an older model 6M Sharkcat a few years back and i was awestruck. The boat is sooo good in the big water nothing i have ever been in compares. Now my question is does anyone have one there or ever seen one there? I searched around but could not find any. I am seriously considering bringing 1 across to charter with, i would however buy one at home if i could find one. This is the website for one of the better brands Kevlacat Website  "
