Once I got there, I was stumped with some questions, evidently IMPORTANT questions, that I should have had the answer for. I went in with the intention of using angled aluminum. But that answer for some reason didnt fair well with the guy .... I guess ! haha  What type would be best ? angled style ? or tubular ? I told him Angled and then he ask What size should I be using ? I want to go with the smallest size I will be allowed... given weight and what not ?  I said for estimate purposes that I would be using 2"" angle for example and he said figure on about $3 a foot ? Sound about right ?  I weight approx 230lbs...  and I will be covering about a 4'x6' area ?  Thanks for the help !"
329672,Handlebarz,2009-04-13 22:24:00,3790,Did you check the srcap off SASS road? or the one in Tilbury? I know some people who got theres from Tilbury its the place right beside the 18wheeler truck stop. As for price I dont know what it would be but that is your best way to do it save on the weight.
