If you want to fish in the meantime you can purchase a temporary paper replacement at a Service Ontario kiosk. I think it was $10 for the paper. Had to go through the process a couple of years back.

It just came to me the other day that I havent recieved the card in the mail yet ! AND I dont have the paper any more (The wife washed the wallet   )  Thanks again !"
