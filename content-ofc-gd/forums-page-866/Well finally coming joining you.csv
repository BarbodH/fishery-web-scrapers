Ill be over in Toronto from the 6th May, so hopefully Ill get to sample a bit of the fishing out there and compare it to here in the UK.  1st things 1st tho will be trying to find work in Toronto, so if anyone knows of anything, or any good recruitement places let me know. Even better if its in Construction, Estimating, Quantity Surveying, Cost Consultant/monitoring etc.  So hopefull once Ive secured work, I'll be off down the local tackle shop to pick up a rod and what not along with the licences and stuff Ill need."

327674,GBW,2009-04-07 22:33:00,8460,"welcome back, check with board member HeadHunter and a company called ATS (not the trucking one).  You'll be in the Markham area right?"
327779,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-08 02:55:00,270,  the capitalist pigs and in general most humans have cornered the market on GOOD jobs due to your being new and finding experience and networking most people register with a placement (temporary) agency..some are professional also ..many employers like to feel out an individual through these companies so they aren't under any commitment to hire the person I.E you!  SO yea if you dont believe me look on the  http://jb-ge.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/   <<website and see how many agencies are out there! Good luck and I hope to meet up for some GREAT fishing!

327822,ben306,2009-04-08 06:47:00,59,"Umm, new one to me if there was a dodgy picture up in my Avatar :S  Cudz, yeah thats my 306 rallye, Its my track car, currently going into storage while Im out in Toronto.  Thanks for the info people, looks like I could get some good help and pointers from a few of you guys. I have been doing alot of searching around when it comes to the employment front in the hope of securing work before I got there. But unlike the UK, Ive found Canadian employers what you to start within 2 weeks, and are very personal in that they like to meet you in person and obviously thats an issue being 3500 miles away. Im not expecting any red carpet treatment but Im prepared to put the effort in, Im quite happy getting casual work if it means tieing me over until I secure full time work.  So being serious about this, Ive enough money behind me to sort me out for the first month or two while I find work so figured my best chances are to come out there and get to meet these people.  Im stuck to the Toronto area, as this is where my girlfriend is currently located, but Im willing to travel provided its places I can get on public transport.  Then hopefully with that out the way, I can sort myself out some good fishing, have been looking into Toronto Islands and the like, places within easy reach (Ill be in an appartment on Fork York Blvd near the water front)"
