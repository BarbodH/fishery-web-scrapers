328453,pike slayer,2009-04-10 03:30:00,1177,"hey guys i plan on going up north this spring to troll for big lakers and may get into the marys for salmon. i want to get a fairly decent trolling rod and reel combo hat can handle trolling cow bells and other large baits. i dont think my 7foot med/hvy baitcaster will quite cut it. im looking in the $50-120 range, i dont want to drop a pile of cash on one cause i'll only end up using it 4-5times a year. what are your guys suggestions? thanks"
328457,irishfield,2009-04-10 03:36:00,26272,Nothing wrong with an 8 foot to 9 foot $30 TDR trolling rod and a Penn 201 reel pikeslayer. You can pick a Penn up off Ebay for $20.. and Slowpoke and I got a whole wack of brand new Shimano TDR rods for $13 each off Ebay as well 2 years ago.
328463,PERCHER,2009-04-10 03:57:00,787,Take a look at a Ugly stick rigger rod and a Okuma convector.I run them for Salmon great setup for just over a 100.00 and I mean just over. Dan

328549,NANUK,2009-04-10 16:46:00,797,"For trolling I like a reel with line counter, a proven and very decent reel is Daiwa Sealine for around $110, match that with a Daiwa Heartland 8' 6"" rigger rod, $30, I have been using the above combos for Lk.Ont kings for the last 5 years, never a problem."
