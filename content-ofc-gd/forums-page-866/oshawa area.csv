329319,steelhead hunter,2009-04-12 21:39:00,152,I was thinking on trying for some steelie this week up around oshawa and was woundering how far up the rivers you can fish I looked in the regs and can't find many rivers with an open season I don't want specific spots just how far up can you fish on rivers like ohsawa creek for example if you don't want to post it feel free to pm
329320,tibbs,2009-04-12 21:41:00,650,You can fish up to the CNR tracks on the eastern tribs.
329321,steelhead hunter,2009-04-12 21:46:00,152,thanks tibbs appreciate it man
329386,batoathome,2009-04-13 00:18:00,47,"east tribs are pretty much done with the odd one around,  next rain will bring in a few and maybe bring down drop backs.  was out on the weekend and we caught mostly suckers"
329439,GBW,2009-04-13 02:17:00,8460,walked about 5KM today of that lower area and not 1 fish sighted and the water was so clear you would know if a fish farted...
329471,eze76,2009-04-13 04:19:00,70,  LMAO..  Hey i got a question when river fishing can you still catch with a regular rod not a fly fishing rod??
329549,GBW,2009-04-13 14:21:00,8460,Yes.  I use a 7' rod with a spinning reel.
329555,kemper,2009-04-13 14:32:00,2232,I know where they are I know where they are!  only problem is they are hanging out right where you cant fish them....buggers
329557,GBW,2009-04-13 14:36:00,8460,LOL @ Kemper.  It's true as I took a walk along the area I fish after opener and there was 8 or so just in this one section.  At least I can say I had seen a fish yesterday...
329564,kemper,2009-04-13 15:23:00,2232, eight... I stopped at a spot yesterday thats holding 150 in a 600 m stretch. They pile up there every year I just hope that we get a little rain to hold them there until opener!
329569,Paully,2009-04-13 15:33:00,712,I checked out 3 different rivers today... only the first one i saw anything in... the other 2 were a little murky I dident see anyone get anything either.. it was nice to get out thou
329604,Smed,2009-04-13 18:18:00,20,"I walked one of the most easterly tribs  on my way home from montreal yesterday and I could not believe my eyes I literally saw about 500-600 steelies.  I am working out the kinks in my camera so I can post the vid of the fish jumping.  Honestly I have never seen that many steelies at once, truly a wonderful sight to see.  Smed"
329621,NoBoats_Onlyfloats,2009-04-13 19:14:00,13,"Hey Steel,  Dont let anyone do your fishing for you....Monday April 13th in th morning, got two....Lost two larger steelies. There are lots of fish south of CNR just because the large pools aren't producing...   PS sorry about the little bit of muck....But they are there!!!"
