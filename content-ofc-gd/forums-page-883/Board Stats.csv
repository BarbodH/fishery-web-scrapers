316723,ozaibak1,2009-03-13 02:10:00,401,"Well, there's a reason the site's stats are good. The site has well written and relevant content. I have to say there are about 7 different sites I read on the web on a daily basis (news, humor, and OFC!). Really.  I try to get an informed opinion on world news by reading as many sources as possible from mainstream to blogs, in terms of humor I like cracked.com break.com and ebaumsworld.com, and for my hobby its mainly OFC. I have to say the reasons are the great community, which results in FRESH and and QUALITY content being posted on.  That's really why the stats are so great, lots of quality content and constantly updated. And these are the results of building a great community, I have to say congrats to the admins once again this is quite impressive."
