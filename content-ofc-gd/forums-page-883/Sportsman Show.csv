316383,dannyboy,2009-03-12 13:52:00,367,"We were planning to go to the Sportsman Show next week as a family (four of us), but $80 is too much ($68 for admission and another $12 for parking), can anyone point me toward some coupons or other discounts?  thanks Dan"
316390,rbaquial,2009-03-12 14:07:00,968,"Go to any of the  LeBaron  locations, they have $2-OFF COUPONS at their front desk. Best part, you can grab as many as you need. That's as far as I know - Sometimes The Sun Newspaper has clippings; at least in the past they did, I don't know if they still do - still worth a shot though.  Anyway, hope this helps."
316393,lew,2009-03-12 14:14:00,12766, Don't forget the insane prices for warm pop and cold hotdogs when the kids get hungry either.  And they wonder why attendance is down at the Sportsman Show.......
316394,bbog,2009-03-12 14:17:00,665,A family pass for $40 is available if the your party of 4 includes 2 kids under 15. See this for further information. Don't know if the $2 coupons can be used with the family pass.  http://www.sportsmensshows.com/Toronto/visitor.htm  It does not appear that free parking at Ontario Place is going to be available this year.
316477,dannyboy,2009-03-12 17:11:00,367,"Thanks guys, The kids are too old for the family discount. I know what you mean Lew, we bring our lunch with us to these type of shows.  I think we're gonna hit a couple fishing stores instead.  Dan"
316479,purekgw,2009-03-12 17:14:00,585,buy the stamp they put on peoples hand lol free pass
316606,mjack 7,2009-03-12 22:43:00,22,  Actually the attendance was way up last year as compared to the last 5 years. Who knows this year.  I think the $17.00 admission they are are calling for this year is nothing short of ridiculous.
