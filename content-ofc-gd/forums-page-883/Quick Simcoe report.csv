Hit the ice at about 7:15am, drilled the hole and started fishing by 7:30 am (dull blades on my auger   ). Ice was about 16-18 inches (estimated not measured). Marked fish right away but no takers until about 8:00. Fished 85 FOW using a large blue and silver jigging rap. The vex showed clouds of baitfish moving in and out with larger fish following. Whitefish limit was reached by 9:00am (larger of the two fish was 59 cm or 23 inches - measure from mouth to fork of tail) and started trying for lakers (still eludes me on lady Simcoe). Saw some fish going up and down the water column but no takers. Missed about 5-6 of taps (maybe line bumps) and left at 11:30am. My friend stayed until evening trying to get his 2nd fish (his first was larger than my largest fish) but only hooked up with a few herring after I left (the last I heard).  Thanks for the read.  Stan"
