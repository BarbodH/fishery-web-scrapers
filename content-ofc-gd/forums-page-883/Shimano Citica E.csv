They are awsome, cast a mile, super smooth drag system. The low profile is great to, fits into your hand like a glove when retreiving. I have them paired up with Crucial Rods and I can't wait to use them for bass, walleye, etc. I think they are worth every penny.  Dirk"

316886,Blake,2009-03-13 14:29:00,418,The new Citica has been very impressive so far.  I have spoken to many people who have purchased it and/or used it and they have all been positive responses.  Great choice.
316891,fishnsled,2009-03-13 14:36:00,3520,I bought 2 last year on sale and wish I had bought them all!  Been very happy with mine and they were used quite heavily last season.
316922,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-13 16:18:00,2038,Awesome reel for the money...........
316925,duber,2009-03-13 16:21:00,220,I used my buddies last year and was very impressed.It was smoother than the more exspensive one I bought.
