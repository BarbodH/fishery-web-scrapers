316632,kickingfrog,2009-03-12 23:31:00,8333,"I saw a book today (in a bookstore of all places). The title was 50 Fish to Catch Before You Die. I'm not going to give away the ending, but it got me to thinkin' about some fish I would like to catch before I die.  For a guy that grew up in Ontario I have had the fortune to catch some of the more remote Canadian species and a couple from the ocean that were on my list.  Here are mine (I may add a few after seeing some of yours), for a few the location and method may be as important as the species:  Marlin Peacock bass (on a top-water in South America) Atlantic Salmon (on the fly in Scotland or England) Grouper (just because ever since a kid I wanted to catch what looked like the biggest bass EVER)  So? What are yours???"
316652,richyb,2009-03-13 00:13:00,774,Tarpon Peacock bass sturgeon Ling cod  Likely my top 4 that id love to do battle with.

My list (top 5) -	Blue or striped Marlin (don’t care where):  My mom was from Mauritius, which back in its heydays was the Marlin fishing capital of the world.  When I was a kid, I used to eat dinner on a place mat from Mauritius with pictures of Marlins on it. -	White Sturgeon (Fraser or Columbia river):  Saw a picture of one in a book I got for Christmas as a kid. I’ve always wanted to catch one since. -	Mako shark on the fly:  They go ballistic! -	Steelhead from the Skeena (or one of its tributaries) -	Bluefin or Yellowfin Tuna:  Served sashimi style at the end  Other Notables -	Mahseer and goonch catfish from India -	Red-tailed catfish and peacock bass from the Amazon -	Nile Perch and Vundu catfish from Africa -	Tarpon from the keys -	Tyee sized Chinook salmon from Alaska -	Taimen from Mongolia -	Muskie (Don’t care where or how big)"

That way, if I meet my maker by some unfortunate turn of events,I'm not going to be dissapointed if I don't get a Marlin, Alaskan Halibut, Tarpon, Mako,or Peacock Bass."

316693,Zubris21,2009-03-13 01:18:00,563,"Cool Topic...  More exotic species would be....  Taiman from Mongolia Peacock bass from the amazon Rooster fish Mexico (baja peninsula is where they are I think) Dorado- Carribean somewhere  Fish that are more likely to be in the near (kinda) future  Steelhead from the Skeena River King Salmon also from the Skeena or Tahltan or Stikine Rivers Rainbow trout from Buckley Lake (30+ lbers in there... rainbow, not steelies!) Artic Grayling (will happen this spring from either the Dease or Cottonwood rivers) Arctic Char, Ideally from the Tree or Porcupine but I'll start with Veronica Lake which is only about 4 hours from here. Giant Halibut fishing out of Stewart B.C.  If I have things my way I'll be able to land all of these by the end of 2009, Halibut may not work out though."
316694,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-13 01:21:00,10439,  I could go tomorrow and not be dissapointed. Thus far I have had a good life and fished in many exotic locations and caught fish most people just dream about.  You want a Gar Pike fish the dam at Caledonia (I knocked that one off my list in the 80's)

Seychelles Steelhead... anywhere West Coast. Taimen... Mongolia Peacock Bass... Brazil Yellowfiin... say... Cabo  Some notables... grouper, lake sturgeon, gar, striped bass, bonefish, inconnu, yellowfin, shark, halibut, tiger trout and aurora trout.  Would like to tangle with another marlin, but not one 400+ pounds... about 150 would be perfect.  Like to catch more sailfish and sturgeon.  I'd give up every other fish for a lifetime of arctic char in Coronation Gulf and the Tree.  Not a week goes by the Tree doesn't come to mind."
