316309,smbhunter,2009-03-12 03:27:00,186,I've got my ticket. Can't wait for the 25th.
316333,solopaddler,2009-03-12 08:16:00,8605,Since this was posted months ago I've been thinking about it. It's only 15 mins down the road from my place.... But did you have to schedule it for the trout opener? You're killin' me here.
316335,lew,2009-03-12 08:45:00,12766,"For anyone with an interest in musky fishing, this is an excellent show and a great way to spend a day. Alot of tackle and fishin gear from around Ontario is available and there's always some excellent speakers putting on seminars every year.  Myself, I'm looking forward to hearing Bob Mehsikomer, he's got an excellent TV show and his seminar should be good too.  A bunch of us usually meet up for breakfast at 7:00 just down the road from the hotel then head over and spend the entire day.  Always guaranteed to be a great show !!"
316366,tinbanger,2009-03-12 12:48:00,1028,"Planning to attend as well.  I'll be travelling out of Barrie ,Anyone need a ride from the greater Barrie let me know ,Lots of room in the Mini van ! and its an Odyssey too! TB"

316642,Pigeontroller,2009-03-13 00:00:00,2793," Not a bad idea! Raf, I always wonder why you don't belong to Muskies Canada? You could help organize the 2011 Odyssey, as of right now we lack for people stepping up!"
