316294,Cudz,2009-03-12 02:38:00,2652,Am i reading my regs correctly?  I have a sport fishing licence.  Can I keep 12 whitefish per day?? That seems excessive.
316297,johnnyb,2009-03-12 02:43:00,3413,"I think it depends on where you are....but I'm too lazy to go check the regs, so, what do I know"
316298,richyb,2009-03-12 02:44:00,774,"simcoe is a limit of 2 , but im pretty sure other lakes have a high limit"
316301,kickingfrog,2009-03-12 02:47:00,8333,"In most places in Ontario 12 is the limit (25 for full). 1 and 2 on Simcoe for numerous reasons, namely habitat issues and over harvest. Whitefish aren't held in very high regard by some, and are not targeted in many waters or are a secondary catch. Maybe the limits will come down in the future."
316303,kickingfrog,2009-03-12 02:51:00,8333,It used to be 25 and 12 and still is in some parts of the province. I guess that means I'm getting old. Now it is 12 and 6 with the always present exceptions.
316318,gone_fishin,2009-03-12 04:18:00,481," most places are 12... which dropped from 25 in the old regs book...  in most lakes, the average size whitie is much smaller than an average ""simcoe"" whitie... if that makes any difference to you???"
316354,Fisherman,2009-03-12 11:32:00,7201,"Thou shalt always read the ""Exceptions"" section that are pertinent to the zone(16) and particular lakes in that zone.  Simcoe is S2/C1."
316483,xeon,2009-03-12 17:21:00,350,"They use to be high because the americans would come over here for the whitefish, now they are the same on both sides of the border (as far as I know). Reason they are so high is because no one targets them other than in simcoe."
316508,cityfisher,2009-03-12 18:47:00,959,1and2 on simcoe..
316611,Cudz,2009-03-12 22:51:00,2652,ahhh the fine print.
