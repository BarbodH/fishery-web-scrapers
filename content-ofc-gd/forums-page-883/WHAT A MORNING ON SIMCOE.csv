316994,SIMCOEBOB,2009-03-13 20:13:00,29,We started out at 8 am and got limit by 9 :30-----minus -17 this morning and drove to the spot mark with x.....fish were everywhere and my daughters first whitefish with one arm as surgery with pins didn't alow her to reel in --so I told her to back up until the fish come to the top and I then scooped it out for her. Ice conditions were the best I've seen in years this late---However Saturday and Sunday ---you might get out BUT NOT IN....  Good luck everyone and stay safe  SIMCOEBOB
