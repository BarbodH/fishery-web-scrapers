RFS     WHY CAN""T I POST A PHOTO!!!!?????????  Usually says 250MB   but now it says....9.77MB of 9.77MB    max upload 2MB  Is it 'cause I posted 3 pics on another post??????"
314872,irishfield,2009-03-08 18:22:00,26272,It actually used to say 250 KB.. but I know what you mean.. I can't use the browse and pic upload anymore.. says I've used 12 MB of allowable 9.77.. And no idea how you can clean out old pics... which would in turn ruin old posts..
314874,Muskieman,2009-03-08 18:24:00,2472,Very strange?  usually downsize the pic and can add them as a reply...

314919,Crazyhook,2009-03-08 21:14:00,1154,you are not being ripped off form Bass pro...  All sales are in USD because they ship all the products from the US. Buy a gift card in the states and use it at the store in Toronto... you will get more then the value!
314925,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-08 21:26:00,3761,who uploads anymore   it's all about photobucket now.
314926,irishfield,2009-03-08 21:28:00,26272,There are times when the quick upload suits the purpose for grabbing something quick off your desktop/etc. to post. Just doesn't work anymore...

314974,shane,2009-03-08 23:36:00,652,"  Or, if you're not a really cool kid, you can post from Flickr.  Just as easy and seems to be smoother for me and this old clunky computer."
