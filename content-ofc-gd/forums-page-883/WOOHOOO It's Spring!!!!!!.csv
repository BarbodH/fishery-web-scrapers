It's a balmy -49 with the wind this morning and I'm ticked because I don't want to walk 3 blocks into the wind to pick up a nice Mocha. I looks like it is going to start warming up un Sunday, if you can call -17 warm.  "

I'll have to give my dad a shout tonight and see how he's enjoying his spring up there. Enjoy that spring Drifter...in June."

316959,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-13 17:49:00,10439," They are easier to get to when they are frozen. Late March and April are sweet months for ice fishing, relatively warm and super sunny all the time. You can get a pretty wicked sunburn here in the spring.   Blaque You said it. It's so much better  than commuting to Toronto every day. I just wish it was a bit warmer some times."
