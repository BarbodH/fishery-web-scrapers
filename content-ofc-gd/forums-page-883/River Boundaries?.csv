It is more related to zones 13 & 14 than it is to zone 20.  It does give clarification however of where the river ends and where the lake begins for several rivers in zone 16.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...age/198482.html  Again, you'd probably be best to check with the MNR directly though"

If you were to cast right in the river than your limit would be two. Chances are if you are fishing the lake you will be surf casting. (just dont cast toward the river)"
