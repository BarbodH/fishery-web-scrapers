317136,Cudz,2009-03-14 01:41:00,2652,I haven't caught any whities or lakers this year as I have only been out a couple of times.  I have caught many perch but tomorrow I got the go ahead from the boss at home to go for some trout one last time.  I will be out from 7:33 until 11:46 am.  I hope to get this trout skunk off my back.

I'm heading out tomorrow as well, hoping to finally get a whitie!!!  Good luck!  733 til 1146?  Well, that's the problem, they start biting at 1150."
