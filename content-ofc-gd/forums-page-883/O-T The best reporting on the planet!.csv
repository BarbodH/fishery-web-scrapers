316892,douG,2009-03-13 14:36:00,2693,You can read a little more about Cramer here.
316917,Cookslav,2009-03-13 15:58:00,1457,Luv it.... Talk about getting exposed eh? Stewart says it like it is.
316943,blaque,2009-03-13 17:03:00,2419,That was fabulously entertaining! Thanks for putting that up..........i didnt get to see it till now and it was the best lunch hour ive had in a long time!!   Probably perked a few ears in the office as well
316945,OhioFisherman,2009-03-13 17:14:00,6623,"Blaque the sad part about it is it is true, Stewart has been banging on Cramer and CNBC the channel he is on here all week. I used to watch CNBC and though I don`t invest in the stock market I wondered about his picks and other items the put on about Wall Street. It just seemed like more of a Wall Street rah-rah channel then anything else.  If you listen to CNBC and lost money it`s no surprise to me."
