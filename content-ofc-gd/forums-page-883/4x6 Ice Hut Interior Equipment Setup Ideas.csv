Pictured below is the exact dimensions of the one I have. (One shown is a Shappell 3000)  This is what I'm trying to figure out. If I want to drill two holes under each flap, it doesn't leave me much room to put the finder and the heater, either a Mr. Buddy or a Coleman BlackCat. I could drill only one hole on one side and use that space, but i'm concerned about the heater being to close to the finder. Plus I prefer to have two holes for each guy.  I'm thinking about making my own shelf to stack the heater and finder in the middle space and shielding the heat away from it at the same time.  For those with this style hut, what do you do? "

That way I set the unit right on top of the hole which leaves plenty of room for the heater and if they are next to each other it isn't bad because the heater radiates heat outwards not to the side."
