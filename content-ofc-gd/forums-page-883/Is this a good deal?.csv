I just picked one up at CanTire for half off. Not sure if its a piece of junk or not. Thanks in advance. By the way there were lots of Nautilus and Mustang floater coats still left, half price."
316566,GBW,2009-03-12 20:53:00,8460,what location?
316567,Maverick,2009-03-12 20:54:00,371,I'm sure it'll do the trick. The 33cc might be a little weak but take your time and with sharp blades it'll do its job. Better then hand drilling them.

316612,Muskieman,2009-03-12 22:52:00,2472,I can sell you the NO2.....My buddy bought one a few weeks back and it works well.
