316514,alexmedic,2009-03-12 19:13:00,186,I was just wondering if anyone new if there was a difference between 10lb test Fluoro Leader and 10lb test Fluoro line (or any test for that matter).  I was comparing the prices of the 2 and noticed that you can get much more bang for buck using line as leader..  Any reason why not??
316531,cram,2009-03-12 19:39:00,1733,"if you're fishing for toothy fish, get the leader.  Its very different from the line...has a sheath on it or something."
316579,kickingfrog,2009-03-12 21:27:00,8333,"Fluro leader is ""better"" at being ""fluro"", in that it is strong and has low visibility but is very stiff so it isn't good for main line and is expensive.  Fluro main line is a compromise so that it wraps around the spool better, and costs less. The down side of this is that for a given pound strength or diameter fluro main line is not as strong or ""invisible"" as fluro leader.  I would never use fluro main line, no point in my opinion. Use mono or use braid and then use a few feet (or more) of fluro leader line to suit the situation. Consider how expensive lures are in relation to a few feet of fluro leader line."

317082,ld17,2009-03-13 23:54:00,319,"Would it be safe to say you can use flouro line as a leader if fishing for everything except pike, muskie?"
317110,kickingfrog,2009-03-14 00:32:00,8333," I do not and would not. If you need flouro, use it. I feel that the fluro main line stuff is a poor compromise."
317114,BillM,2009-03-14 00:46:00,17367,"For toothy critters, I still prefer a wire leader.  A little knick you don't see in a flouro leader and the next nice smack say goodbye."
