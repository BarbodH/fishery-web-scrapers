316506,pxtyson,2009-03-12 18:42:00,21,Hey  I am wondering if anyone could guide me in the direction of a river that I can fish for steelhead.  I have never fished for them and am very interested in catching some.  I live in the halton area so there are many rivers that hold steelhead.  I have been reading the ministries open seasons and I cant find anywhere to fish for steelhead yet I am reading on here that people are fishing for them.  I know it is not cool to post places to fish so if possible PM me.  Please help I have the urge and no where to go

Try checking google map and use the satellite images, you should be able to find something. The Credit River and Humber River are ones that get mentioned around here from what I've read. Good Luck finding something."

316665,KelfuN,2009-03-13 00:37:00,246,"google map lake O, lake Erie, georgian bay, lake huron..find the tributaries that flow into those lakes..and 90% chance there will be steelheads in those rivers.  really, there are no ""secret spots"" in steelheading...you just got to do the foot work.."
316674,Rizzo,2009-03-13 00:49:00,4754,can't help you out but welcome to the board and good luck
316677,timmeh,2009-03-13 00:52:00,609,"Until the last saturday in April you have limited options. Read the regs and find out which rivers have sections that are open year round and start there.  Best of luck,"
