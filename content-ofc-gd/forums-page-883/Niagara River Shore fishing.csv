What type of set-up or rig should i be using?  If anyone wants to come along, pitch in for gas, tues-thurs any day, will be driving from toronto.  Maybe not go as far, try port dalhousie if its good this time of year?  Maybe even try a charter, anyone know of one on the niagara?  Thanks"

Lower river is the Queenston ramp with limited space. On the upper river there are spots from Chippewa to Ft Erie along the Parkway. Best thing would be to stop in to speak to Denis at Fishin Niagara. He's on the Parkway in Ft Erie. Take Qew to Bertie st and down to the river, turn L."
