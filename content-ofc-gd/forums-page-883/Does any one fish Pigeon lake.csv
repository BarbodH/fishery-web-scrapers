316684,Jeff Wiles,2009-03-13 01:06:00,55,I went up there 2 times with my buddy and got fish around the north end. Does any one else fish in or around there. I dont need GPS cord just a point in the right direction. Thanks Jeff
316691,Pigeontroller,2009-03-13 01:15:00,2793,"Lots of structure to fish in the North end, Hurricane Point, Redrock, Amburgs reef, Dropping Reef, Boardinghouse Reef, Vivians Shoal, Steamboat Island, Bottom Islands, Lighthouse rock, Gordon Rocks..."
316696,Beans,2009-03-13 01:26:00,3339,I don't think there are anymore left...Meely and Buckster caught most of them last year...
316740,Radnine,2009-03-13 02:41:00,1538,I just got my hair cut and the barber that I stopped at (not my regular guy) told me about how he catches a couple of Muskie every year while fishing for Walleye on Pidgeon Lake. Great guy by the way. Jim
316754,buckster,2009-03-13 03:21:00,530,No fish in pigeon lake
316835,Beans,2009-03-13 13:14:00,3339,  That's what I heard about Lake Simcoe...
316839,ld17,2009-03-13 13:26:00,319,I think you'll do better at the other end of the lake (more weeds).  We caught a muskie along the weeds near the center of the lake.
316855,ehg,2009-03-13 13:54:00,2666,"That north end ain't bad for muskies around where Pigeontroller mentioned.  Caught a few last year(like pictured) trolling shallow runners over deep water, go figure. "
317025,Jer,2009-03-13 21:42:00,1426,If you like to cast...go south (earlier in the year)  If you like to troll...go north (later in the year)
