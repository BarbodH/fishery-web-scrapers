316750,OX!,2009-03-13 02:58:00,6,The boat launch when you first come in is ice free as well as the whole western portion. The canals and bridge area near the marina are still pretty frozen last time I checked (two days ago)  Roger W
316804,diggyj,2009-03-13 11:43:00,548,Went by yesterday and the launchs are completely ice free. Western end of lake is flowing into the storm areas(all the boardwalks over them) but they are still frozen. Eastern end by the bridge is still pretty solid with ice. There are small areas on each side of  the bridge that are ice free. To small to cast effectively. Should melt by the weekend or the start of next week. Middle section around the boat houses has some good open spots but the owners of the marina chase you out. I jumped the fence and was asked to leave by some lady screaming at me.  Dirk
