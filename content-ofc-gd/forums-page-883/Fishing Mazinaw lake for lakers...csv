316559,codered,2009-03-12 20:37:00,123,I am planning a week long trip up to the mazinaw lake area ( cloyne) is there any one here that is farmiliar with the area? there is a few little lakes around mazinaw I was thinking about trying for some lakers. I have never fished intentionaly for trout in the summer but would love to try it . realy I have no idea were to start depth/preasentation/time of day /water temp/or time of season? I have just started looking for information  and thought this place would be my best place to start.. thx  everyone and tight lines....
