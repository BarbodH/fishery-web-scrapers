316996,SIMCOEBOB,2009-03-13 20:20:00,29,We drove out in the morning and condtions were fantastic witha small amount of snow for good traction--walking was good for those who walked---look at my last post for Saturday/Sunday for driving out---you might get out but not in---The ramps are taking a beating and the ice is starting the changing stage--with some mild temps--won't take long to get rotten ice-  good luck  simcoebob
