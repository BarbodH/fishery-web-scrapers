I'm not looking to buy it yet because of the price but i am wondering if it hold up to what the manufactures say it to be. Hummingbird seems to be one of the main pushers out there, but if  someone has a better product I'm all ears."
316686,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-13 01:08:00,0,nobody else has a product out there yet for side imagining other than hummingbird (that is affordable)  but!!!  lowrance announced at the 2009 bassmaster classic that in late 2009 they will have a add on pack for the new hd units for side imaging    but the hummingbird units are sweet drive by the docks to see if a bass is under them saves alot of time pre-fishing for tournies for sure
316897,stan_133,2009-03-13 14:44:00,77,my guess is that once theres a few companies in the mix prices will slowly come down.
