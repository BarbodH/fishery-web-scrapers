Weather and river condition doesnt seem to be too promising for the next 2 days, so instead I browse through the internet and try to learn more tactics and tips.  Found this ""Shotting Patterns"" off Raven Tackle website. http://www.raventackle.com/Shotting%20Patterns.pdf  Feel free to post more web links of Steelhead Fishing tips for us OFNers. Myself recently discovered Fish On Line Fishing News Portal through a post on the site. Thanks efka!"
