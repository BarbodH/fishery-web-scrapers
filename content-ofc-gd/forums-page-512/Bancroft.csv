As for the York river, I've never seen anybody fishing it or even heard of anybody fishing there. It's supposed to be pretty polluted, I've known kids who got sick from swimming in it."

They have a map that lists all the fish in the different lakes throughout the area.  It is primarily a bass area, not too many walleye or pike in the area with the exception of Baptiste Lake and its connecting lakes.  Use the map to find smaller lakes off old logging rods and you will do very well for bass."
