With the upcoming wedding (8 days), a 9 month old baby, and a full-time job, finding time to fish is difficult...but i do still manage to get out  Here are a couple nice smallies that i've gotten in the last couple weeks               thanks for the look!  Sam"

603283,ranksda58,2011-07-16 03:14:00,69,"thanks for the comments and congrats on the wedding guys ill definitely be doing some fishing on the honeymoon - whenever we get the time to take one  craig - im on shore there, the weeds are about 3 feet or so but they thin out at the water and you're able to cast comfortably"
603284,GBW,2011-07-16 03:20:00,8460,"I didn't even see a boat!  We are all just messing.  But hey, that's a heck of a spot to try and pull a 'hog' out of.  Congrats on the wedding and things can wait, just not too long or she will take away your right to fish..."
603287,ranksda58,2011-07-16 03:26:00,69," haha i figured as much, just wanted to describe the area im lucky though, my future wife loves to fish and joins me regularly"
603288,GBW,2011-07-16 03:29:00,8460,good SCORE!  in many ways...
