603132,misfish,2011-07-15 19:46:00,29133,  Think we have been through that already Grim.
603134,fishnsled,2011-07-15 19:51:00,3520," My thoughts as well Lew. I love my side console but I think I will be looking at a full windshield in my next ride for those reasons. November and December fishing will be more pleasant I'm sure.    Brian, I thought the same when I but my boat 9 years ago and bought the 2-stroke. I never would have guessed that gas prices would have jumped like they have especially in the last couple of years. Would have saved me money to have gone with the 4-stroke even with the $3000 price difference back then. Not sure how the Opti vs 4-stroke compare on fuel economy but the prices didn't seem too far apart when I was checking them out at the boat show in January. Just some food for thought."
603141,misfish,2011-07-15 20:04:00,29133,"Thanks for the replies   Im a green fish guy.LOL  I see yours and Lews point,but now were jacking the price.  Bettys going to kill me,you all know that right?"
603144,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-15 20:06:00,10439,  Not if you don't tell her until it's parked in the driveway!!!
603150,Terry,2011-07-15 20:15:00,14456,"sometimes it's easier to ask for forgiveness for buying something, then it is to talk them into letting you buy it"
603158,Dan668,2011-07-15 20:25:00,1120,which lund were you comparing it too? The rebel?
603162,Terry,2011-07-15 20:30:00,14456,I think the lund Impact is closer to legend
603164,Dan668,2011-07-15 20:34:00,1120,"Yep just took a look, it indeed is, i was thinking of a different boat from legend. I have a Impact with a 115, awesome boat. I ended up with the full windshield, also was a hard to decision whether or not to fork the extra money for it. As for 2 stroke/4 i would go for the 2 if you end up purchasing the boat. Ive been out a few times so far and was surprised at how little gas i used."
603167,misfish,2011-07-15 20:50:00,29133,The impact and rebel.
603168,Terry,2011-07-15 20:50:00,14456,did you get the optimax 115 or the reg. 2 stroke with it  what's the topend speed with it  did you get the 1675 1775 0r 1875
603169,misfish,2011-07-15 20:52:00,29133,"Sure glad I did the leg work for ya bud.  J/K  And yes,it was our talk we had, while you were frigg,n with your boat batteries."
603172,Terry,2011-07-15 20:56:00,14456,I have till after next summer before I am buying so I can do lots of asking between now and then my boat doesn't work but I have to wait
603179,Dan668,2011-07-15 21:02:00,1120,"Its the 115 opti. 1775. Top speed with 1 man unsure but merc bulletins puts it around 47, and ive seen others hit in the 46 range. I hit 42 with a full tank of gas, loaded, 3 200lb guys, aluminum prop. I havent fully broken it in, but i dont think ill gain much more.  I also looked around for 2 years. I decided on a starcraft or a lund. I didnt mind legend, but my brother didnt like the interior colour and told me everyday, were getting the lund after he seen the black colour on the boat, loved the look of it. Starcraft i ruled out after as i decided that i mainly fish inland and not in the great lakes. (Those boats are huge,deep, wide gunnels, prob awesome in rough water.)  The impact will do until i finish school and get a real job, than ill be saving up for a ranger haha."
603180,misfish,2011-07-15 21:09:00,29133," Had a Ranger,wish I kept it,,,,,,,,,,,right Terry,,,,,,,,"
603182,Terry,2011-07-15 21:16:00,14456,I had a ranger too  thanks for the info it helps me decide
603185,Pikeslayer,2011-07-15 21:24:00,1443,"Bettys going to kill me,you all know that right?   New fridge, stove, washer/dryer and a Kobo for Miss Betty.  Worked for Miss Slayer."
603215,Joey,2011-07-15 22:52:00,9122,"Full console is the way to go, and the bigger engine too my friend.  Go for it, she'll forgive........eventually"
603216,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-15 22:52:00,4399,"Hey Brian l have a 75 opti on the Stratos and it gets great mileage. As a side note I was talking to guy last week who said he bought a lund 17/18 foot can't remember which with a 90 on it for 17,500 in Buffalo!"
603228,misfish,2011-07-15 23:45:00,29133," Ah, I forgot,it,s an engine,,,,,,,,,,,Care to talk to her J?"
603324,express168,2011-07-16 13:21:00,327,"Have had a Legend in the family for about 7 year now the Express 164. It is a narrow 16 footer side console with the max horse 40 4 stroke and has been a great boat. Legends service was excellent through the purchase process and would definitely buy from them again. Should a boat purchase happen again though I would definitely agree with Lew and go full windshield with a top, drier ride on crappy days."
603351,Fisherpete,2011-07-16 15:43:00,1814,"I bought my Legend 16' Pro Sport from Henry last summer.  I got great service from Henry, and love the boat. Wide open layout and TILLER lol... Perfect for all my Kawartha adventures. Big enough to be pretty stable in rough waters, but can also take it into some pretty heavy slop without a problem.  For the price of the boat and trailer, it was a no-brainer (kept my Honda from last boat)."
603395,fishnsled,2011-07-16 20:42:00,3520,"  There was an ad, for Lund I believe, that had a guy standing by his truck with the boat hooked up and a dog in the boat. The caption for the add was ""Just tell her it followed you home."" Give it a try Brian, might work."
603073,misfish,2011-07-15 16:30:00,29133,"I have always dislike the legend line,mostly due to the under powering of the boat. Today I made a trip to the local dealer and met up with Henry (OFC member) The 16ft FX caught my eye right away. Henry was the design layout guy on this boat and it is very nice.Huge casting deck.Powered by a 2stroke 50 merc(I was thinking of going with the 75 opti,but 5 grand more ,still might do if I go for this boat),plenty of power to push it at 32 mph. Nice size live well,remote trolling motor and pleanty of storage and has a rod locker.   So I tell you all,I am a believer of the legend boats and thank you Henry for taken the time to show me the boats and when Im ready,I,ll be back."
603077,John,2011-07-15 16:53:00,2956,"Brian,  What did that Legend work out to with the 75 opti, including trolling motor, full top etc....?"
603078,Terry,2011-07-15 16:55:00,14456,I would think about 22.000  but that just a guess
603079,misfish,2011-07-15 16:59:00,29133,"Hi ya John.Terrys close,but I dont want the top,but may get talked into it,if you know what I mean. Might be one of the conditions if I do buy new  I looked at a Lund simular same boat,it was 6 grand more."
603081,BillM,2011-07-15 17:10:00,17367,"I looked at that exact boat, but it just seemed a wee bit to small (cramped) with the full console.   We've been running a 15ft Legend widebody tiller for years, no complaints with it at all.  I love that boat!  Although we did max the engine out on it (40hp 4stroke Honda).."
603082,misfish,2011-07-15 17:15:00,29133,"This one is a side consol Bill.Sure it,s the same boat? I found enough room."
603084,GBW,2011-07-15 17:19:00,8460,I can set you up with Roger to test ride his with the 60HP if interested Brian.
603087,BillM,2011-07-15 17:23:00,17367," Ah, I didn't look at any side consoles.  The one I looked at was the 16 XCaliber full console.  A side console would definitely free up some space."
603090,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-15 17:32:00,2690,No complaints with my Legend...other than the fact that I wish it would grow 2-4 feet
603091,misfish,2011-07-15 17:32:00,29133,"  Thanks Geoff,but I dont want a full windshield."
603093,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-15 17:35:00,2690," I do, but, living in the doghouse for the next three years doesn't agree with me"
603094,GBW,2011-07-15 17:38:00,8460,For more of a speed test for you Brian.  This way you can decide if a 60 will do what you need or if you do NEED a 75.
603097,BillM,2011-07-15 17:45:00,17367," Same here Frankie, lol."
603098,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-15 17:53:00,10439,"I bought my boat from Legend when they had a location in Mississauga and I opted for a larger motor as well as a few other goodies. The boat I got was a very good quality boat at a decent price and the folks at Legend were great to deal with. I was on vacation in Sturgeon Falls and had a TM battery die while under warranty. They asked me if I could get to their place in White River. I did and they gave me a brand new battery on the spot, didn't even have to haul the boat there.  Yes, the basic packages are under powered but if you know that going in you can just get one of the option motors that is bigger."
603099,Terry,2011-07-15 17:56:00,14456,"I am looking at lund but when I saw how much cheaper Legend were I had to take a second look, I mentioned it to Misfish and now look what happened ...LOL"
603101,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-15 18:10:00,2585,i fished out of a legend a few times and my inlaws pick up a new one next week.  I have always felt it was comfortable and large enough.  As for underpowered well that is the buyers issue not the sellers.  Buyer can always upgrade to more power if wanted.  Cheers!
603102,OutdoorDan,2011-07-15 18:12:00,325,"I dealt with Henry when I bought my boat about a month ago. He was awesome to deal with, very friendly and professional, and really knew his stuff. I ended up not buying a Legend, but it had nothing to do with Henry or the boat lacking anything (I wanted a 150hp 4-stroke and didn't want to get a Verado, so went with another boat). I spent a LOT of time driving around talking to a lot of different dealers and he was by far the best one to deal with."
603103,danbouck,2011-07-15 18:12:00,4380,"I couldn't be happier with mine. I stuck with the base 50 but went to 4 stroke, get just over 30 mph with it which is plenty until i upgrade to a 20' extreme with a verado."
603107,lew,2011-07-15 18:21:00,12766," Maybe give just a bit more thought to the full windshield Brian, along with a stand-up top. Sure does make life alot more bearable when fishing on those cold miserable fall days."
603112,Terry,2011-07-15 18:26:00,14456, yeah but they push the package with the under powered motors and people who don't know about boats do realize it's a bad/dangerous deal
603123,Spiel,2011-07-15 19:03:00,9065, Did the Lund package come with the max horse rating?
603125,misfish,2011-07-15 19:13:00,29133, NO
603127,Spiel,2011-07-15 19:23:00,9065," I see.  Well for what it's worth I (as many others) would recommend maxing the horse power, you won't regret it.  I'd also recommend 4 stroke."
603129,misfish,2011-07-15 19:34:00,29133," I know Chris.As for 4 stroke.Add more dollars to that.I,ll stick with 2 . Im sure I,ll opt out for the 75 opti.That 16 will fly."
603130,grimsbylander,2011-07-15 19:35:00,3016,"I just looked up the 16FX out of curiousity...you can actually buy that boat with a 25hp outboard on it!? really? They sell a boat with a hull weight (before batteries/fuel/people, etc) of 995lbs that is rated for 75hp max with a 25hp? Hmmm Safety and ethics are in question."
