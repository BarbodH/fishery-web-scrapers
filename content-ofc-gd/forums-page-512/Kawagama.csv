He called his secret spot the twin Birches.  Those trees are probably gone now   Years later I used to snowmobile across the lake and through the bush to Kimble Lake, was great ice fishing for lake Trout. But I think it's a fish sanctuary now. Kawagama used to be called Hollow Lake by some of the locals back then. I think the lodge we stayed at was called Hollow Lake Lodge."
