603514,Billy Bob,2011-07-17 11:15:00,5865,This is one of the good endings to a SERIOUS situation.  http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article491403.ece
603517,Grimace,2011-07-17 11:39:00,2020,Awesome ending.  I had a few close calls reaching for the downrigger ball and getting smacked by a wave.   I picked up one of those auto inflatable life jackets and they are pretty comfortable.
603718,HTHM,2011-07-17 22:30:00,4082,Always ALWAYS wear your tether! Wonderful that it turned out the way it did.
603722,ChrisK,2011-07-17 22:40:00,2772,Happened to a friend of mine in Lake Erie about 15 years ago. Reaching out to set his down rigger and lost his footing. Found him treading water waving his hat on the end of a downrigger pole about 7 hours later.
603725,lew,2011-07-17 22:54:00,12766,Saw on the TV an hour ago that a boat apparently capsized  at Cherry Beach in Toronto and they were searching the waters for the occupant.

603731,HTHM,2011-07-17 23:25:00,4082,"Thanks, you just gave me an idea! Extend my tether and clip it to my beltloop. It is a pain to clip on and off, a 20'er would allow me to move around the boat."
