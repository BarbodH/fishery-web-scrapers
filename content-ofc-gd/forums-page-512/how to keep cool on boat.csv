603938,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-18 15:30:00,10439, Don't forget the cool Captains hat.
603946,NAW,2011-07-18 15:47:00,4022, That's what I do when I know it's going to rain during a camping trip.  Just have to watch out for gusts of wind.     Pretty Ugly..
603966,Tybo,2011-07-18 16:49:00,1373,I just think how cold it's going to be in six months.
603967,mercman,2011-07-18 16:59:00,7054,   The picture of coolness
603968,mike rousseau,2011-07-18 17:01:00,4661,Yup... +30 is better than -30  Had to remind my friend of that on Saturday...
603969,Fish4Eyes,2011-07-18 17:01:00,1022,"I just try to fish shady areas as much as possible, especially when the sun is at its peak."
603970,lew,2011-07-18 17:05:00,12766,"Novembers just around the corner boyz, then this hot steamy stuff will be just a distant memory.  "
603972,Spiel,2011-07-18 17:07:00,9065,Lew you don't look very happy for someone in the boat fishing.
603974,lew,2011-07-18 17:08:00,12766," Actually Chris, that IS my happy face"
603975,Joey,2011-07-18 17:10:00,9122,"He's smiling Chris, can't you see it"
603977,Spiel,2011-07-18 17:14:00,9065,"     I know it, just can't miss an opportunity to take a shot at you."
603978,BillM,2011-07-18 17:15:00,17367,"If that's Lew's happy face, I don't wanna see his grumpy face, lol!!!!"
603980,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-18 17:23:00,2690,"Just bring your bathing suit Skinny!!!  Things get too hot in the afternoon, we're swimming!!! After all this is about raising money, and, having fun.  It isn't a tournament Five days left!"
603986,Carp,2011-07-18 17:43:00,1488,"How to keep cool on the boat you ask ? You simply go fishing when it's not so hot outside.  I open a beach umbrella while trolling. Hold it in one hand and steer with the other. That way I can tilt the umbrella as the boat turns to block the sun. If I get a hit or need to change baits, etc, I simply close the umbrella and lay it down, out of the way (2 seconds) I also have some cup holders that can be popped out and insert the umbrella. Only drawback is wind. Enough of a breeze will make it hard to keep the umbrella steady.  I also use a wide brimmed hat and sometimes tuck a rag under it to protect my neck and face."
603987,Governator,2011-07-18 17:45:00,879,"  Yep agreed, just bring a cooler & go for a dip if you get too hot.  You'll dry in no time anyway."
603990,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-18 17:54:00,1107,Skinny just go back in one of the shaded areas and go swimming waters several degrees cooler back there and the beach umbrella is already in my boat can't wait till saturday.
604063,johnnyb,2011-07-18 20:13:00,3413," Kind of like basting a turkey    Will definitely cool you down, but make sure you keep the sunscreen going."
603584,skinny,2011-07-17 16:34:00,442,Ok I will be on my boat all day next sat for the fish A thon . my boat is all open and I'm looking for ideas on how to create some shade or relief while out there I had thought about trying to find one of those easyup tops i could put up on it for the day but I cannot go buy one for sure (need to get another battery for trolling motor) looking for ideas
603588,Terry,2011-07-17 16:41:00,14456,"I can not take the heat/sun like I use to  I sometimes drag my foot in the water when slow trolling, it helps to cool me down...but it makes the fish puke...LOL  I have a small towel that I soak in the water and put on my head then my hat over top of it, looks stupid but sure cools me off   a clip on umbrella can help too but you have to keep repositioning it to block the sun"
603593,ChrisK,2011-07-17 16:55:00,2772,Like Terry said.. I can't take the heat like I used to either and I'm only 50.... I have a tilley hat I soak in water and put in back on my head. The towel trick works as well and who cares what it looks like Terry. Anything is better than sun stroke at our age. Also I've been know to pull over on occasion and go for a quick swim. It can add hours to your day on the water....Note of caution..Be sure to reapply your sun screen if you end up going for a swim.
603594,BillM,2011-07-17 17:01:00,17367,I don't fish on days like these.   I'll do a morning/evening fish and skip all the nasty muggy weather inbetween.
603605,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-17 17:46:00,10439,"The sun is pretty intense up here where there is a giant hole in the ozone so I use the wet hat trick and also wear a wide brimmed hat. Another way I use to cool off when it's stupid hot (like in Ontario) is to stop the boat, turn off and lower the engine (I have a 90) then jump overboard!!! I use the cavitation plate as a swim step to get back in the boat. If it's like 30*+ just leave your clothes on and you'll stay cool for quite a while."
603607,ChrisK,2011-07-17 17:51:00,2772, Great minds   ....I usually put on a life jacket and float around on my back with a nice cold can of ice tea in a cooler....Hat and sun glasses on of course and 60 sun block...The water is the worst of places to get a bad sun burn...
603609,lew,2011-07-17 17:58:00,12766,The loose fitting sunblocker shirts are good on a hot day too.  They block alot of the heat and with open arm pits and back flaps the air can circulate and help keep you comfortable.  I have a couple and one of them even has a very high collar to keep the sun off the back of your neck.  A wide brimmed hat  is also invaluable on days like these.
603610,BillM,2011-07-17 18:03:00,17367,"Lew, my dad will usually burn really bad if exposed to the sun, I bought him one of those Buff headware sun protector things.  He can pretty much wrap his entire head with it and it protects all those places you miss with sun screen, lol.  He says it's also pretty cool as well.  You see alot of the guys fishing the flats down south wear them."
603613,ChrisK,2011-07-17 18:12:00,2772,"Guys I'm interested in some of that sun blocker wear. Can you post a link or perhaps even some manufactures names ???  Bill,where did you get the Buff headwear ??"
603615,Joey,2011-07-17 18:20:00,9122,"Go to the dollar store and get some empty spray bottles.  Fill them with tap water and keep them in the fridge and then put them in the cooler with your drinks when you go.  Spray yourself whenever you need to, head to toe, and you'll stay pretty cool.  You can also take off your shirt, soak it in the water, then put it back on."
603617,mercman,2011-07-17 18:27:00,7054,  Let me know where yer fishin the next time its hot              Sorry......  Couldn't resist...............
603621,HTHM,2011-07-17 18:38:00,4082,I just go for a 40 - 50 mph rip and that cools me down.
603623,BillM,2011-07-17 18:45:00,17367,  BPS has them in the flyshop.
603625,lew,2011-07-17 18:48:00,12766,"Bill, I've seen some of the guys from the southern fishing shows wearing those head wraps and they look like they'd do a good job.  Chris, the shirts I have with the arm pit and back vents, along with the high collar came from Mountain Equipment Co-Op in Toronto. Excellent shirts that I've probably had for at least 10 years.  I also wear another shirt made by Columbia that is very light and comfortable and has a full width vent in the back. I got that one from CTC for something like $50."
603629,BillM,2011-07-17 18:50:00,17367,Forgot about the UV shirts from Columbia as well.  They work great!
603636,mike rousseau,2011-07-17 18:58:00,4661,buffs are great for intence sun...  my dad recently figured out that if he took the seat off its pedastil... he could incert a beach unmbrella in the top of the pedistal... boom...shade...  i do mean an extra seat in the boat of course... lol
603638,ChrisK,2011-07-17 19:00:00,2772,Thanx fella's
603664,pikehunter,2011-07-17 19:57:00,1659,"I fastened a piece of PVC plumbing pipe to a platform/box I have for the gas tank, slip a cheap beach umbrella into it and there ya go, instant shade and coolness. Wife loves it! Works fine as long as it's not too windy and the boat is either achored, drifting or trolling. Neat thing is that the shade moves around as the boat moves about giving the bow passenger and the tiller a chance at some shade."
603772,Nipfisher,2011-07-18 01:16:00,2449,I dunk my wide brimmed hat in the water about every 30 minutes. I give it a quick wring to get the excess water out and then put it on. Feels great as the water drops run down your back.
603776,danbouck,2011-07-18 01:18:00,4380,"patio umbrella and stand, sneak it out before she wakes up!"
603780,RyanT,2011-07-18 01:23:00,72,"Just rig up some sun umbrellas for your boat.  Use a bucket of sand/grave/ cement if you need a weighted stand for it.  Extend it with PVC pipe.  I use PVC pipe in my tinny for sun umbrella and makeshift bimini top that rolls back.  Simple, cheap and lightweight."
603925,Bigfisherman,2011-07-18 15:02:00,100,"  Would using the cav plate as a ""ladder"" add any extra stress to the transom?"
603928,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-18 15:11:00,10439, No more than having a transom/swim ladder and you don't need to go out and spend extra $$$$ for it.
603932,PainInTheBass,2011-07-18 15:17:00,102,"How to keep cool on a boat...  1. Put on skinny jeans, aviators and golf shirt with popped collar 2. Blast the beats as you cruise past anchored fishing boats  j/k"
603933,Crazy Ivan,2011-07-18 15:18:00,184,"These work great, my employer used to hand them out in hot weather.  http://www.oxarc.com...v?prod_id=16331  Don't know where to get them in Canada?"
