We would like to park the boat and check out a local marina for shopping and maybe fries and a burger. Going to be launching out of Baysville.  Thanks in Advance"

I believe Baysville also has a restaurant on the water, however, I have never been so can say for certain.  Hope that helps    "
603400,nroadrunner,2011-07-16 21:15:00,113,Dorset is your best bet for food.  I live in Baysville anything here is away from the water not a far walk but not on water.  good luck on Sunday.    Ian
