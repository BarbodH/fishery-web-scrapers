I haven't shore fished the area since I was a kid and all those spots are long gone and much of the area near me is parks and you're not allowed to fish from them.  Hopefully there are some locals on this board that could help me out.  I don't mind driving a ways either.   Feel free to PM me.  I was planning on looking into possibly booking a musky charter on St.Clair too, so if anyone has any suggestions for that as well, I'd also appreciate it.  Cheers."
602966,Musky or Specks,2011-07-15 04:34:00,2710,I stayed at this conservation area during my sons baseball eliminations a couple of years ago. Wet waded along the beach casting body baits and spinners and caught plenty of smallmouth and silver bass. Nothing huge though  http://www.erca.org/conservation/area.holiday_beach.cfm
