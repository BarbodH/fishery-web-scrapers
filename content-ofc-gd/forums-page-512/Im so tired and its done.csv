So this morning I woke up at 4 am as usuall. With only one thing in mind,  GITIRDONE. Temp plates, insurance run, parts run etc, etc. I swapped the hitch from the old to the new one, what a pita that was. A quick wiring job for the trailer lights and voila, finally I can rest now for a tad. There is more work ahead of me but shes in tow mode for the next 2 days ps, my youngest made a little something for my hard work "

So heres what happened after putting the boat on the trailer. I go to pull away and my front calipar seizes up Ok I will drive slowly home. After 5 minutes of driving I feel a tug I looked back and I see the trailer wheel smoking I did nurse it home only to find out that I have a coolant leak now. Good thing I have a decent parts car and plenty of new parts to add today. 37 deg celsius and 6 wheels to pull. I feel your pain Terry"
