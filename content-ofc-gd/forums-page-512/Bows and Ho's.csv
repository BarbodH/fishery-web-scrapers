On thursday evening I was the only boat on the water in 350 feet of water straight out from credit. I think it was one of my favourite evenings on Lake O, it was flat and calm and as far as we could see there were surface feeding alewives for miles. We trolled with lines down 15 feet and went 7 for 9 in two hours of fun filled airborne action. 4 of the fish were cohos in the 10-12 pound range, plus a bonus 11 pound bow.  Unfortunatly I ddint have a camera , my buddy kept a 10 pound coho for the smoker.    This morning we returned and could not find any bait so i went west hopuing the east wind yesterday blew the fish down the lake, found them in 250 and only went 3 for 5 but the 2 cohos were 10 pounds and the bow I estimated at 16-18 pounds. biggest bow in ages and maybe ever for me.  Enjoy!    "
