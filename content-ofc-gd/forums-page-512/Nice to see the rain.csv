Power went out at 5:15 for about an hour but we're good now although the radio says there's still many folks without hydro.  Sure is nice to finally see some rain though, it's been along time since we had any.  I planned  a musky trip to Upper Buck today but their calling for more lightening  so I'll put it off until tomorrow."
603863,Rich Clemens,2011-07-18 11:30:00,3131,We sure could use some down here.   Around 90+ for most of this week and no rain in sight for us.  Grass is brown and just crunches when you walk on it.  Farmers are really having a rough time right now.
603867,Joey,2011-07-18 12:02:00,9122,"Ya, it was sure nice to see that this morning Lew (we had no lightening, but it did rain).  Hopefully we'll get enough to give the grass a bit of color again!!"

604080,adolson,2011-07-18 20:59:00,783,"TONS of lightning here last night. Lots of rain, too. I love the rain, but I'll admit, it was kinda worrisome being out in it, up on a big hit, trying to get lightning photos. lol  I love fishing in the rain, but when there's lightning, no thanks."
604082,Handlebarz,2011-07-18 21:09:00,3790,Well we have the thunder and lightning I am sure will get just enough rain to make the humidity raise about 10 degrees it sure is hot here nothing like Saskatchewan there is is so nice and dry.
