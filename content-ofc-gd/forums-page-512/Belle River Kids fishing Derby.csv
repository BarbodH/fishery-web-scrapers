I donâ€™t have the exact numbers but there were around 200 kids that came out and enjoyed the fishing. The day was hot for the get go but no one was bothered by it as the fishing was as hot as the weather. My wife and I were manning one of the measuring stations and had a blast the kids were so happy and proud of each catch that they were bringing to us to measure for them.  Thank you to all our Chapter members and our wives for there dedication to helping run this event I must also thank some close friends from Ohio that come out each year to support us and lend a hand I know they would not want there names sent out as they are not in it for that so I will just say thanks. I must also thank the parents for taking there kids out to this event we love to watch your kids grow and see how proud they are of there fish.  Looking forward to doing it all again next year.  Mike Parker
