603626,shadowfly,2011-07-17 18:48:00,84,"after 4 beers i got curious to how many lakes there wore in Ontario little bit of Google search and found this  Ontario is home to approximately 250,000 bodies of water that are classified as lakes. The exact number is unknown. Nearly 4,000 of these are larger than 3Km2. Most are found in the northern portion of the province  how true this is i don't know i have just an average folding map  Randy manically Ontario easy finder lost count after 100 lakes.

603635,shadowfly,2011-07-17 18:58:00,84,ahhh come on BillM list what you can count lol

603639,Devin87,2011-07-17 19:01:00,12,"A gazillion. probably 40-60 in Algonquin Park alone. I just look at maps, see a lake, then try to get to it and fish it. I guess its alot different for us then folks from the south who tend to fish the great lakes."
