602025,craigdritchie,2011-07-12 16:53:00,1586,"The Toronto Star reports that Dick Oland, of the Moosehead Beer family, was axe-murdered at his desk last week.  From the story: “He was killed with an axe. He was bludgeoned to death,” the source told the Star, adding that while police remain tight lipped about the details, they do have a “number one” suspect, whose story is full of inconsistencies.  ""Oland's body was found in his Canterbury Street office in Saint John on Thursday, at which point police described his death as suspicious.""  Suspicious?  Ya think?

602026,solopaddler,2011-07-12 17:02:00,8605,Yep sounds suspicious to me too.
602031,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-12 17:22:00,4399,"I don`t know, guys chop themselves up all the time could be self inflicted!!!"
602033,Roy,2011-07-12 17:37:00,13728," According to investigating authorities, the theory of self infliction is not probable as the alleged weapon was found ten feet away from the victim's legs and 32 feet away from the rest of the body.  My condolences to the family and friends of the dearly parted."
602035,mercman,2011-07-12 17:40:00,7054,"This is a sad day indeed. My first ever drunk, was on Moosehead beer. I still have fond memories of the blackouts i had while drinking this wonderful brew. My deepest sympathy to beer drinkers everywhere in eastern canada."

602043,craigdritchie,2011-07-12 17:58:00,1586,I've toured that very brewery. Don't remember too much but there are photos to prove I was there (and they will definitely stay off the internet!!).  Never met Mr. Oland but wow - talk about a grisly way to go.
602047,irishfield,2011-07-12 18:27:00,26272,"I was really ticked yesteday, sitting in a pub FULL of Moosehead signs and they didn't even sell the brand!  Rotten way to go no matter who you are. Sounds like a mob hit.."
602064,bigugli,2011-07-12 19:39:00,6138,Shades of Lizzy Borden?
602149,TennesseeGuy,2011-07-13 00:53:00,957,A shame Mr. Oland couldn't have a loaded Glock in a pocket holster to even the odds.
602153,splashhopper,2011-07-13 01:20:00,2931,  I didn't remember my blackouts.  But other people did.
602650,superdad,2011-07-14 16:50:00,353,"Back in the mid 60's I used to rally in New Brunswick and Dick Oland was a member of our club and competed regularly and you can remember the old VW bugs - there was a tray across the front of the car in the trunk part. His navigator was wondering why the VW was handling so poorly, until the end of the rally and Dick opened the trunk and there 15 cases of Moosehead cans in the car.  He was a good guy and will be missed by Saint John and the province of New Brunswick.  David  aka  Superdad"
602668,Pikeslayer,2011-07-14 17:53:00,1443,I got an axe to the head once.  It hurt like crazy!!!
602692,RyanT,2011-07-14 18:58:00,72,"Those cops are really on the ball there in Saint John.  I agree... definitely ""suspicious""."
603255,irishfield,2011-07-16 01:37:00,26272,His son's house was searched today. Guess some can't wait for their inheritance.
603262,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-16 01:54:00,2585,wow thats to bad.  What a brutal way to go.  How does one walk into an office (you have to assume Moosehead has a larger office) kill someone with an axe and walk away with out others seeing him?  Anyway he obviously pissed someone off
603264,irishfield,2011-07-16 01:59:00,26272,He hasn't been involved directly with Moosehead in almost 25 years.
603276,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-16 02:23:00,2585, my bad.  should have actually read it instead of glanced over it
603343,Beans,2011-07-16 14:36:00,3339,  And took pleasure out of telling you...
