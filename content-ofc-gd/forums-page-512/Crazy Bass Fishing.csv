603846,Dozer,2011-07-18 06:12:00,896,Haha 5:05 and 5:50
603847,adolson,2011-07-18 06:47:00,783,"Man, I wish I could find a place where I just keep pulling them out like that.  This guy in the vid reminds me of one of my uncles, even his voice is similar in some ways. But my uncle doesn't say ""Boo yah!,"" at least not that I've heard.  Thanks for sharing anyhow, it was entertaining. I think I'd give that a shot, actually."
603866,Joeytier,2011-07-18 11:55:00,3990,Thanks for sharing...that is awesome!  I'd love to get into the everglades someday
603898,Live2fish85,2011-07-18 13:34:00,1633,I would love get into the everglades as well to do some large mouth fishing but not a chance would i be doing it from shore like that guy is at least not in a remote populated gator spot.  Dana if your ever down in my area let me know i can pull smallies in like that out at my parents.
