603727,Raf,2011-07-17 23:05:00,3495,anyone had luck getting those white spots out of plastic ie. sonar damaged by bug juice?  screen appears to be ok fortunately.  newb on board didn't realize the damage this stuff does to plastic.
603745,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-18 00:12:00,10439,"Nope, the stuff eats plastics and melts paint. Always spray into your hand and then rub it on. Too often I see people spraying it on like hair spray."
603755,John Bacon,2011-07-18 00:32:00,3277, Preferably the back of your hand so that it doesn't melt everything that you touch.

603871,LucG,2011-07-18 12:16:00,779,Had the same thing happen to me. Couldnt figure out how to remove it.
603878,Raf,2011-07-18 12:42:00,3495,"Yes, Fish Farmer, I took some rubbing compound (the stuff sold to restore yellowed automobile headlights) and added a little elbow grease and it greatly reduced the spots.  If I keep at it, I should be able to get most of it off.  Like I said, thankfully no damage to the screen."
603924,wallyboss,2011-07-18 14:59:00,1095,"If the stuff to clean Yellowed headlights works, then just use white toothpaste (not gel) to clean it out. Cause it does a great job to headlights and it costs a fraction of the price."
