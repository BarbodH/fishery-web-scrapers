603222,skinny,2011-07-15 23:04:00,442,ok I just aquired a bow mount (actually 3) trolling motor foot pedle type  these are johnson torlling motors and my boat is a 16 ft starcraft tiller I sure I will have to cut plywood to mount to but my questions got to do whit how to angle the trolling motor or not to angle it if I send it right off the front it may fit under my storage cover but I see most angled  just looking  for pointers i'm mounting it in morn
603223,Roy,2011-07-15 23:12:00,13728,Are those the ones with the curved shafts?(offset)
603226,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-15 23:29:00,4399,I had one of those hated the damn thing! Parts of it are sitting on the bottom of Scugog!
603241,Terry,2011-07-16 00:57:00,14456,if you can upload photos of the boat and trolling motor it would make it much easier to help
603271,skinny,2011-07-16 02:19:00,442,yes it has bent shaft at bottom will get pictures of trolling motor in morn    this is what I was thinking 
603308,skinny,2011-07-16 11:18:00,442,pictures added help me out guys
603311,Roy,2011-07-16 11:43:00,13728,If you leave it straight out the stem like that it will always be in the way when you're not using it.
603312,scugpg,2011-07-16 12:07:00,1373, Exactly
603313,Roy,2011-07-16 12:16:00,13728,"Mount it so that the head is toward the port bow and the prop is off the starboard front. Make sure that once deployed, the shaft is no closer that an inch from the rub rail. Bolt the whole thing down using substantial washers on the underside. Your red/green navigational light will need to be raised for visibility to others."
603319,skinny,2011-07-16 12:55:00,442,ok so mount sidways should I be watching how the cable and wires are for the control also what gage wire should I use to feed it as they have been cut
603322,scugpg,2011-07-16 13:04:00,1373,If battery is at front 6 or 8 should be ok what lbs thrust? Don't forget a breaker
603362,skinny,2011-07-16 17:26:00,442,ok so it's almost all mounted I need to get proper hardware as my bins of stainless have gone missing  Roy you have helped alot on this .in your first post you asked if it was the type with bent shaft is there issues with this style
603364,Roy,2011-07-16 17:35:00,13728, No problems at all. I was just trying to imagine the setup and wondering if there was any difference to the way it could be mounted. I don't see any problem with it whatsoever. Don't forget to fuse the red wire as close to the battery as possible....40 amp should do the trick.
603366,skinny,2011-07-16 17:38:00,442,i have 30 amp here already so i was going to try  any clue on how much battery i will need for full day on the motor. I have fish a thon next week
603367,scugpg,2011-07-16 17:43:00,1373,What is it around 40lb thrust? A large deep cycle should power that most of the day I would think as long as you aren't constantly on it at high speed.
603369,Roy,2011-07-16 17:52:00,13728,A fully charged group 27 battery should be ok unless you're battling a headwind all day or your boat is loaded heavy.
603380,skinny,2011-07-16 19:01:00,442,well it will have 3 of us in it plus gear and a 40hp hanging off rear as dead weight
