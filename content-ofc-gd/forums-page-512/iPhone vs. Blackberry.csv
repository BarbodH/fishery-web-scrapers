603053,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-15 15:04:00,10439," The reason for the better reception is increased power. The old car, suitcase or transportable phones from the old days had 3 watts of power compared to less than .5 watts today."
603061,jedimaster,2011-07-15 15:36:00,3472,Yah the phones now are designed with lower range because there are so many more cell towers now than before. My dad used to have one of those phones in a briefcase things. My first phone was when I was in college I bought a woodgrain nokia 232. I was all cool back then.
603063,Governator,2011-07-15 15:50:00,879,"I have the bold & wife as the torch, buddies have iphones.  I've also had a Samsung Galaxie (Sweet phone btw).  The data usage between blackberry & any other smart phone (ESPECIALLY iphone) is quite drastic.  Anyone who has carefully looked at their bills would notice just how much more they are paying each month for their smartphones.  Blackberry compresses everything and saves a ton.  With blackberry you can easily get away with the lowest monthly data plans which you can't possibly do with an iphone (Blackberry should market this fact but don't, it's one of their biggest pluses right now).  Keep in mind RIM's next lineup is either going to make them or break them.  I know they are releasing a touchscreen bold and they are updating the phone OS to the same as the Playbook which is a thing of a beauty on it's own.  Before they were innovators and others were playing catch up but those roles have reversed and RIM is now reacting to other companies moves.  Sadly they've been on the decline and I really hope they can bounce back strong in 2012.  I've been a blackberry user for 6 years I would hate to see them sink."
603119,PainInTheBass,2011-07-15 18:46:00,102,"I used to sell phones, and my answer to questions like these was always, ""It depends on what you want to use the phone for.""  There is no blanket statement.  To say that one phone is better than the other at everythng is nonsense, other wise there would be no market for both phones, but there is.  Just because one phone can do everything, it does not mean it does everything better than the other.  Obivously, each phone has its merits and weaknesses.  It is based on these which a decision should be made.  (Oh, and touch screens, while good for some, are terrible for others, and will polarize buyers just as the actual buttons on a blackberry will).   Do you think chain messages will stop just because you change phones?  They will just take on a diffeent form.  What you need to change are your friends lol."
603175,Big Cliff,2011-07-15 20:58:00,6899,"Sounds to me like it is 6 of one, half a dozen of the other when it comes to which phone to use. I just got a BB curve and started learning how to text and email from it. Works perfectly for what I need it for.  As for ""who should be paying for it?"" Teach the kids that you get out of life what you work for. You will be doing them and you a big favour down the road!"

603446,aplumma,2011-07-17 01:14:00,6896,Since it is your dad buying the phone or paying for the plan it is HIS choice on what phone he gets for you. If he decides that you need to be reachable on his dime why should he pay for the upgraded features you want that will cost him more money not only on the purchase of the phone but also monthly. What are you offering him for an upgraded phone and plan? I am sure if you put something on the table that has a monetary value he would be more willing to discuss the phone upgrade. In the end if you have a vested interest in the cost of the phone/plan you will find it a character growing experience that will help you and your dad make future decisions on the expenses of growing up.  BTW if you go on a public forum and ask a question of this nature and include the details that you have you will get both types of answers... some that will help your cause and some that don't.

No one can tell you what will work for you so get both if you really want to find out as some of my friends do;-)  I decided to go for the iPhone and have been very happy since but that's just because of my usage -- mainly leisure and not much business. Best of both world is get an iPhone 4 and bring your laptop to share the data plan via personal hot spot, however powerful BB is, it doesn't beat a laptop. I know BB does the data sharing to some extend too but probably not as flexible as the personal hot spot."

Can play zillions of games with awesome graphics.......... Who cares if you up to your chin in crap and just need a reliable communication tool that types like your laptop and gives you e-mail access, ability to BBM with other Blackberry users and a pretty good camera that let's you take photo's of what you are trying to communicate.

602775,jedimaster,2011-07-14 21:08:00,3472,"I have seen two companies go the route of Iphone and switched back to BB. Communication is critical and without a reliable means of sending and recieving attachments, and being able to type reliably and quickly, it just doesn't work for many businesses. There are some nice tools for Iphone, but most if not all of these also are available for blackberry. Blackberry is still the defacto mobile communication device of choice for most businesses for a reason. I am not at all saying an iphone isn't good. It certainly has its merits...Games and a better web browser. However BB is still king for business in my books. Also I would better a shiny dollar that flash will come to handheld blackberries sooner than Iphone. Since the Playbook already has full flash and the ipad doesn't natively. I have heard people getting it to partially work after jailbreaking but it doesn't work reliably."

I do find email on the BB faster and smoother then the iPhone but for the small differences I do miss my iPhone.

I like it alot more then my BB and would compare it to the Iphone. When I got it the guy told me either the Samsung or the Iphone are the best out there at the moment. As for music it's got no problems and it can have up to 32 gig memory. The keyboard on it is great to it's actually just like the Iphone and is easy to use. If you into the app the Android is similar to the Iphone there are alot of apps that are meant for Iphone you can get on the Andriods.

My choices are; iPhone, Blackberry torch or Bold 9780, I want to switch to an iphone becuase i've had a blackberry for 2 years now and I want to switch it up. A few problems I encounter with my blackberry are; music is hard to update, phone freezes, dont recieve some calls, and my biggest issue is broadcast messages, for those of you who have a blackberry you still would not really undersatnd, a broadcast is a message sent to your whole contact list on bbm (blackberry messanger) I would recieve about 10 of these a day (but I also have 200 contacts). The messages are either chain letters (if you dont send this to all your contacts you will have bad luck for the rest of your life) or the other one (add my best friend hes amazing 23y4h5k) dumb messages like this really get on my nerves, the iphone is simply a god, although bbm is good, iphone does not have that (only downfall) I think I can deal with out the broadcasts and just use the simple texting. Bad things about the iphone (correct me if im wrong) the data useage, I talked to a few of my buddies and they say you double click the home button and turn the app off, for emample if I want to see the weather, I open it look at it then close it becuase if its not closed it keeps updating a uses a lot of data, turn it off and youll be fine. next is he battery life on the iphone, I herad its not the greatest. other than that, I believe the iphone is a way better phone and has way better features. My dad (the one paying the phone bill   is tottaly against the iphone  . I posted this to prove him wrong! What do you guys think? What do you have?"

I can do everything you just said with mine faster then I could with my BB. I can play full songs as ringtones too with default apps.  And if you jailbreak you just opened another door to thousands and thousands of apps that will allow you to do virtually ANYTHING. Blackberry is garbage now, I wish they had invented the iPhone so my money could go to a Canadian company but BB is old tech.  Businesses are all slowly converting from BB to iPhone for obvious business reasons. When I had my small business I could use Invoice2go and send invoices, quotes and more to my customers. The email system is way more advanced. Plus you can make the iPhone email even more epic by jailbreaking and getting apps like attachment saver to name just one.  Yes a laptop is good, but the iphone still a all in one tool that every business should have.   I havent yet played with an android phone but I'm sure it's even better then the BB as a business phone. Four month isn't even giving it a chance IMO."

602696,John,2011-07-14 19:03:00,2956," Sorry, I agree with Jedimaster...........iPhone is fine if you want to play all day but if you want to actually communicate with business partners, customers and suppliers on an ongoing basis Blackberry in MHO is still the way to go with an actual qwerty keyboard. Seems like sex still sells and sways people away from what they really need as a business tool! I honestly think that these things go in cycles, iPhone will cool off in the next 6 months or so and unless RIM really blows it on the new models/technology they will once again become the business phone of choice."

I for one prefer the iPhone keyboard since it's less bulky and isnt always there unless you need it. Please go into more details on the communicating part of your argument cuz iPhone does everything the BB does an thensome. Conference calls, email, work on email while talking to a contact, browse the web to find an answer while still talking to a client. I know my curve couldn't mutlitask like that."
