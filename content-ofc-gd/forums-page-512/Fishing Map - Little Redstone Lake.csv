I did get into some SM Bass up there last year, but nothing huge.  Would like to have a little more information on the lake, etc.  I bought myself a portable Fish Finder/Sounder, so should at least be able to find some drop offs, etc.  Any suggestions on this lake, or on Redstone itself would be great."
