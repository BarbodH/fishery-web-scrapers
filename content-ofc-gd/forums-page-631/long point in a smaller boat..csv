504730,SBCregal,2010-09-17 19:19:00,688,"hey gang  we're headed camping at long point PP tomorrow for the night and had a question about fishing in the bay.   i'd like to know about winds and boating out on the bay.  we're hoping we can take it out and get into a few perch or something.  dont want to go too far away from the pp.  ive heard that winds from the east means pretty much a no-go on the bay,  for the weekend the winds are being forecasted to be between 15-20km from the SW.  is this going to whip up the bay pretty good?  we dont really have much choice about bringing the boat (we haul and store it on the roof of our camper and have nowhere else to put it) if the bay is going to be too rough, it'll just have to stay at the campsite with us til we leave but it'd be nice to get out for a few hrs fishing.   if not, is there anywhere around there we could do some shore/pier fishing and maybe get ourselves a feed of perch??   thanks, ryan"

Taking a look on Google Maps, a SW wind is your best bet if the winds are from the South. SE would be deadly, but you've got the 'Point' blocking the SW. Just depends on how easily the Bay gets rolling."
504734,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-17 19:40:00,2690,"I was out last weekend in a 14 fter with a 15 hp in similiar conditions.  Don't stray too far out, if you are looking for perch straight out from the park towards EC 10 is a good bet.  Watch the winds, don't take any chances.  There are perch in closer as well."
504735,SBCregal,2010-09-17 19:43:00,688,"yeah, we definitely wont head too far out (probably wont even get a chance to before my girlfriend gets bored) plan on staying close to the park and getting into a few fish.  there's a bait store right in long point iirc.. .anybody know if they've got minnows?"
504737,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-17 19:48:00,2690,"That would be Rotten Ronnies.  He had plenty last week.  Guys name is Jimmy, good guy, loves to talk fishing.  He charges $5 a scoop (a generous scoop) for minnows."

504778,ch312,2010-09-17 22:32:00,1590,you will be fine sheltered in the bay. i have a 14ft tinner and take it out on the bay in some windy conditions and its never that bad. sw winds shouldnt be a problem.
504836,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-18 03:01:00,2050,South west wind is good for you if your running out from the park! The point will shelter you from the wind for the most part! East wind is bad like you said but you should be ok to get out for some pirch.

504850,Rich,2010-09-18 10:20:00,3927,You're good to go. I fish the inner bay in my 14' tinnie and have seen a lot of worse days than 25kph SW wind. That'll be average bay weather.
504857,danbouck,2010-09-18 12:40:00,4380,I'm going out regardless of what the wind does this afternoon.
