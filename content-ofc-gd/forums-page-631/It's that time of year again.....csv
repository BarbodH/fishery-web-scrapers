504244,AzuluSpookd,2010-09-16 01:29:00,348,"Get all the hunters out here and tell us what you're doin' this year? Anything different, same ol' stuff, new places? Same places?  I've been out a few times goose huntin' and got a few birds....couple of buddies went out, 3 of them and had 28 birds down on opener  Gettin' ready for my annual moose hunt...leaving two weeks later than last year, as we were huntin' in 25 degree weather last year....looks like we could have went on opener this year as the weather seems to be cooperating....  Got a brand new property to hunt for deer this year....lookin' at gettin' my fourth...  What's everyone else doin'?"
504314,Jay T,2010-09-16 11:12:00,282,"I head out tomorrow for a bear hunt  , and do a little fishing too. I will be getting out there for the deer opener on Oct 1st, need to get me a slick head for some good eats.   Good luck with the moose hunt."
504320,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-16 12:08:00,0,which of the five stages are you at Marty?          
504325,NAW,2010-09-16 12:20:00,4022,"I'll be heading out for goose this weekend for my first hunt of the year.  Just got a new 870, and am pumped to break it in!  I've never been bear hunting before, but have a new property lined up that has a few bears kickin around.  Hopefully I'll drop my first bear this year.  I've been hunting deer with a crossbow the last 3 years.  But this year I'm going see about using my recurve.  I've been practicing as much as I can, but still am only confident inside 20 yards  Shapin up to be a great season.  Really looking forward to it!"
504335,anders,2010-09-16 13:00:00,1168,"Im headed out tomorrow night for a week of moose hunting...rifle opens where we are going...2 bull tags and 1 cow tag this year...hunting completely out of a boat, trolling for eyes while we hunt...gonna be a great week"
504360,K_F,2010-09-16 13:59:00,107,grouse opened yesterday -- headed north tomorrow for that and some northern pickeral fishing and maybe some pike if the birds are slow -  October first is also a big day - had a great season last year looking to keep the whitetails rolling
504362,Harrison,2010-09-16 14:12:00,2202,"Looking forward to the 25th!  Love resident birds.  Also been working on my deer stand, I am going to tweak it a little this year and add a gun rest.  "
504371,AzuluSpookd,2010-09-16 14:35:00,348,"What area you goin' to? We hunt on a river as well, it opens saturday, but we're opting to go two weeks later this year.  I  "
504372,Rod Caster,2010-09-16 14:39:00,5784, This is the coolest thing I've heard in a while. Is this what they call Funting?
504382,AzuluSpookd,2010-09-16 15:10:00,348,"Although it may sound cool, I'm sure what he means is he will either be in a canoe or boat with only paddles while hunting...and no motor attached...because we don't want to promote illegal activities here..  If it's where I think you're going (17)...better watch out....CO's are there..and hiding...charged a group last year, who shot from their boat...even though they weren't movin'...motor still attached...big fine!   ""It is illegal to have a loaded firearm in or on, or discharge a firearm from, an aircraft, vehicle (including snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle) or motorboat or anything towed by the boat.A loaded firearm may be carried in, and discharged from, a canoe or boat that is being paddled, with no motor attached.  MOTORBOATS: Under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, a motorboat means a boat with a motor that is attached to the boat  MOTORBOAT: A boat with a motor that is attached to the boat and that is capable of being used as a means of propulsion, and includes any floating object being towed by a motorboat."
504385,Rod Caster,2010-09-16 15:16:00,5784,Thanks for clearing that up....I like the concept even without the motor.
504396,anders,2010-09-16 15:53:00,1168,we are going to 17...we there last year...we were not the one charged...we got a cow and missed a bull...  My brother actually shot the cow...from land
504401,misfish,2010-09-16 16:07:00,29133,"The only thing different this year will be,shooting something.  Be safe out there."
504550,Leecher,2010-09-17 00:44:00,7832,Wish I could say the same but not going to be hunting this year..... but I will help my bro setup his ground blind he made last year  Shoot straight everyone and most importantly.... be safe!!! Leechman
504569,AzuluSpookd,2010-09-17 01:27:00,348,Hey Leech...How come you ain't huntin' this year?
504571,Leecher,2010-09-17 01:31:00,7832, Too much stuff to do around the house and inside..... I've neglected it the last couple of years  Oh well thems are the breaks I guess.... still looking forward to hard water
504572,danc,2010-09-17 01:35:00,4677,Just a Grouse hunter here. I might go for a drive Sunday morning to see what out there. Not sure yet.  
504573,NAW,2010-09-17 01:35:00,4022,"  How does this work for duck hunting?  My self, and thousands others, shoot from duck boats with motors attached.  From what I understad, as long as the boat is not in motion, with the motor turned off, you can shot from it (when watefowel hunting).  Is there different regs for moose hunting?  I've never been moose hunting before, so I've never looked into it."
504576,vinnimon,2010-09-17 01:42:00,2593,"  Correct me if im wrong!You are right but from what I remember, the fuel tank/line has to be disconected from the motor while hunting!Before and aft/its ok!I dont hunt out of a boat and its been a while!I enjoy a walk threw the forest on a cool morning in the fall to early winter!"
504580,AzuluSpookd,2010-09-17 01:54:00,348,There's a special exception for waterfowl hunting...only. 
504581,AzuluSpookd,2010-09-17 01:56:00,348,"If there's a motor, whether it be electric or gas....you're done. Can't hunt from it for moose or other except waterfowl. Gas disconnect means nothing. "
504776,Sinker,2010-09-17 22:09:00,8692,"You can hunt from a boat, you just can't shoot from one.  The waterfowl regs are found in the migratory bird act. You can shoot from a boat, as long as forward momentum has stopped. The priciple of that law is that you can't chase birds and shoot them.  I'll be out whackin ducks as soon as season opens.  We already have enough geese for now, the early season is just way too easy.  S."
