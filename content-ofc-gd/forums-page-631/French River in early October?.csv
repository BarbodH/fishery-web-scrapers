I've read some threads about the water levels being low on the French this year, have they improved by now? We are thinking about staying at Wolseley Lodge, any info would be appreciated!"
504336,OhioFisherman,2010-09-16 13:07:00,6623,"You could try calling the Lunge Lodge? ask for Mike Pettry he was always a straight up guy, as I understand it him and another guy that we fished with bought the place.  Now that I think of it that is part of his head in my avatar, like 22 years ago."
504345,stubbex1,2010-09-16 13:28:00,164,"Yup, the fish should still have the feed bag goin' on!  I go the first week of October pretty much every year to Dry Pine Bay.  Try the current, drift through it or anchor off to the side and cast in.  I was on the French middle of August it was down about three feet.  Take it easy if your not sure where the rocks are as most of them are unmarked.  The nice thing about low water is you can see where the shoals are for next year when the water is higher (hopefully)  Here is a website i use to track the water levels. http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ontario/eaux-water/renseignement-information-eng.html  Tight Lines!!!

504364,johnnyb,2010-09-16 14:18:00,3413,Should be some pretty good fishing going on at that time I would think....lots of big fish in that area that will want to be eating lots of food!  Get up there!
504365,Muskieman,2010-09-16 14:22:00,2472,Upper French is HOT right now and will be 'til closing.  Randy 
504442,myst,2010-09-16 18:09:00,57,"Awesome, thanks guys!"
504702,Fishnwire,2010-09-17 17:01:00,983,This is one of the best times of year to fish that area.  You'll have fun...I know I will.
504765,bd001ca,2010-09-17 21:30:00,9,I will be on the Lower French for a week starting on Thanksgiving weekend.  Can't wait myself.  I as well am curious on what the water level will be and what the weather will be like.  BD
505113,bigcreekdad,2010-09-20 00:27:00,546,"I'll be at Crane's on the lower the first week of October. I was there 2 years ago same week and it was so cold, I stuck to trolling (which is not my favorite). On 4th day, caught a 43' muskie on a big trolled spinnerbait....drove back to camp, packed my gear, and went home ( Ohio). I sure hope it's warmer this year. This is BIG fish time."
