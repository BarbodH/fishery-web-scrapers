503896,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-14 19:23:00,0,Not playing devil advocate but how do you know it's Oil? That type of thing can be natural with people not knowing it can happen. From the video you can only see one type of fish even though the news lady says other wise and from what I know about news...lol.....maybe just another pita bleeding heart report just like kicking frogs news report.  
503903,addymark,2010-09-14 20:13:00,69,that's a crazy image.  But what is crazier is how Billy Nungesser did up his top button!
503953,Billy Bob,2010-09-14 23:19:00,5865,I am VERY LEARY of any of the LIBERAL MEDIA reports now a days.....EVERYTHING is now slanted to how they want us to view something.  Ever notice when there is a disaster they will ZOOM in on the SELECTED area and NEVER give a wide view of what they are showing so we can actually judge how wide spread the problem is ? ? ?

503974,rylan,2010-09-14 23:49:00,134,gbfisher --- do you work for BP?   here is something for you to chew on:  http://poorrichards-blog.blogspot.com/2010/09/yesterday-near-bay-chaland-louisiana.html  but if I was a betting man I would place money on the toxic dispersants  AKA Corexit   http://theintelhub.com/2010/09/14/evidence-mounts-of-bp-spraying-toxic-dispersants/
503976,Billy Bob,2010-09-14 23:53:00,5865, Right wing media......where do you find this animal.....
503999,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-15 00:33:00,0,  Don't believe everything you read in the news. I wouldnt waste my time chewing on any links but thanks though.
