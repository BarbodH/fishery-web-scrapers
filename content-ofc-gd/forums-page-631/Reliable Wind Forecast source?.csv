504170,blaque,2010-09-15 19:48:00,2419,Has anyone used this source to forecast winds in the past.   Lake Ontario Winds
504175,smally21,2010-09-15 20:04:00,993,"haven't i use this one  http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/marine/forecast_e.html?mapID=11&siteID=07503  click on the icons on the lake for realtime wind speeds, temps, etc."

504185,Roy,2010-09-15 20:38:00,13728,I've been using Windguru for years.

504187,blaque,2010-09-15 20:54:00,2419,"thanks  guys, they all seem to be somewhat consistant with each other"
504195,tjsa,2010-09-15 22:05:00,1578,"I use this for the Great Lakes, not for inland.  http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/maps/EastGL.shtml"
504196,Musky or Specks,2010-09-15 22:09:00,2710,I rely on wave buoys for specific areas. They are realtime and let you know what the lakes like. I find it particularly useful for St Clair as Im about 3 hrs drive from where I launch. And I can decide whether to leave the driveway or not with a quick check
504197,Billy Bob,2010-09-15 22:20:00,5865,"Try this CAMERA site of the Great Lakes......first click on ""camera map"" on the left side........then click on the area you want to check....then below the the picture of the area there is ""near shore"" and ""off shore"" weather links to click on......sounds like a lot of clicking but it's fast and CURRENT with the real time pics of the lake area..  Don't know what happened to the Toronto camera this year....it was until this year the best pic on the board......had a real time pic of some fishing pier.....you could actually watch people walking up and down the pier.  http://www.lakevision.com/index.html  Bob"
504203,Bob Devine,2010-09-15 22:43:00,251,"I usually check with Lake Vision and then complain that is should be called ""LIAR VISION""..(they only called for 1-2 ft waves) lol "
504309,alexmedic,2010-09-16 10:47:00,186,This is what I use: Windfinder
504331,blaque,2010-09-16 12:39:00,2419,lots of options.........thanks guys
504342,justin elia,2010-09-16 13:23:00,151,"I use Sailflow.com and Windguru.com but out of the two, I find Sailflow to be the most accurate."
504373,dave524,2010-09-16 14:41:00,4508,"I get up start the coffee and look at the weeping willow in the yard, if that looks fine I grab a coffee and walk to the end of the street, Lake Ontario is right there  If it looks good hook up the boat and it's 2 minutes to the launch  If the lake starts flat takes a while to get rolling and usually get a few hours in anyway."
504383,blaque,2010-09-16 15:11:00,2419,"FYI, the question isnt necassarily in the interest of a marine (boating) forecast. But more-so to see what ill be in for when heading out to the piers on the southshore of Lake Ontario. Basically just wanted a tool to tell me when wind conditions were going to be ideal and whats in store on the nights i can make it out.  If anyones interested lol, its been slow. Past weekend i broke one fish off and saw 2 or 3 hooked. Last night, the big NADA. For everyone, not just myself."

504415,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-16 16:32:00,0,  Slashhopper...You need to have a rock hanging from a string to make this weather theroy work.  It's an old Native weather forecast.
504421,Roy,2010-09-16 17:00:00,13728,This is one of the most reliable... 
504513,Leecher,2010-09-16 23:33:00,7832,Here's what I rely on    Closer look    Leechman
504524,ehg,2010-09-16 23:53:00,2666,"Have used this site for wind direction, speed, precip, etc for years. Helps to see if see different things might effect fishing location days in advance. http://www.meteo.psu.edu/~gadomski/ETAPA_0z/etaloop.html"
504532,spincast,2010-09-17 00:10:00,3279,"I use this one.  My link After checking it all summer i have determined, if it calls for rain when I want to go fishing for walleye it will be sunny, and I shoud be fishing for bass If it calls for stong winds the lake will be calm if I plan my trip based on their prediction, I will be ..... upset is the word I believe I have to use on this forum.... when I really want to know My link or  My link"
