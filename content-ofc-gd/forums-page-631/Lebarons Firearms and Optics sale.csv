It used to be 2 or 3 times a year, but now it seems like they have it every month. I used to pay for the membership to save 10% but now with all the sales (typically can't apply the membership discount on top), I have no incentive to join."
504794,farsider,2010-09-17 23:49:00,456,"I have noticed that as well.  I think it has something to do with the HST rollout.  To be clear though, this sale is HST plus 10%(membership) discount.  Cheers, Mark"
