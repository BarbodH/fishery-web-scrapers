504036,highdrifter,2010-09-15 01:45:00,2534,Looks to be PMDs brother.  Pale Morning Duns..
504041,Roy,2010-09-15 01:53:00,13728,AHHHHHHHHHHH Fidel nailed it. Won't see them after late September though.
504043,mercman,2010-09-15 01:56:00,7054,same thing happened to me saturday nite coming back to montreal from ottawa. i had to stop 3 times at gas stations to squeegee them off.the windshield washer just smeared them and i couldn't see the road
504047,Roy,2010-09-15 02:02:00,13728, Buggers!
504049,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 02:03:00,0,i would imagine there's a few fish swimming around stuffed like me after a visit to the mandarin.
504050,highdrifter,2010-09-15 02:10:00,2534, Tisk tisk..  great dry fly on size 20-22 umpqua.
504086,solopaddler,2010-09-15 10:41:00,8605,Ryan to be slightly more specific they're a type of mayfly.  Growing up in Sudbury you surely must have seen the slightly larger green drake hatch in June/early July?  They call them fishflies up north.
504088,aplumma,2010-09-15 10:52:00,6896,Scraped off and dried they taste alot like potato chips....   Art
504106,fishnsled,2010-09-15 13:46:00,3520,  I prefer deep fried or dipped in chocolate myself.....   Bugs look nasty Ryan but you should be able to eat for a while.
504120,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-15 14:36:00,0,"Yup. Is called a mayfly hatch. I remember fishing Nipissing when it was so bad you couldn't see. Every light post, garbage can and everything else was completely and I mean completely covered by them on the dock.  Supposed to be bad for fishing because the fish start heavily feeding on them."
504130,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-15 15:28:00,2050," I've seen mayfly hatches before...  I figured they might be a type of mayfly but i haven't seen any this small before! they were the size of and similar in shape to mosquito's! I should have taken a closeup shot of one of them... there's still plenty stuck on the truck haha... so maybe I'll do that tonight if I can..  Cheers, Ryan"
504140,tb4me,2010-09-15 15:58:00,3295,I ran into the same thing last week comming from Paris to Brantford on hwy 5. It took me anhour to get them all out of my rad in my truck..nasty buggers
504440,ctranter,2010-09-16 18:01:00,543, Sounds like a great time to bust out a fly rod!
504441,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-16 18:04:00,932,The last few trips I've had to the river has been covered in bugs - lots of big hatches going on right now.
504500,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-16 22:57:00,0, I hear the same thing.
504505,Musky or Specks,2010-09-16 23:09:00,2710,The dreaded psuedocleon. I fished a hatch of them on the Beaver once at this time of year. Fish were chowing on them pretty good size 22. No bg fish were moving to them though.
504665,Governator,2010-09-17 14:08:00,879,"When I was growing up my family's annual summer vacation was renting a log cabin for a week in North Bay (Right near a little place called ""The Owl"").  Anyway, those big Mayflies would cover every sign and entire sides of homes.  A white house would look brown.  Quite a disturbing scene really lol."
