504059,Cudz,2010-09-15 02:46:00,2652,I am looking to buy a sebile onduspoon and was on youtube to see how they work and I can across this vid.  At first I thought they were trying to catch pike and were putting minnows on their spoons but I soon figured out that the minnows were actually the target species. I guess this is what fishing in France is all about.    Weird.  
504064,Dozer,2010-09-15 02:51:00,896,Imagine if they were put on a salmon creek right now?   Bizarre indeed!

504153,mercman,2010-09-15 17:28:00,7054, what y'all laffin at. Isn't that how it's done ??????
504159,tb4me,2010-09-15 18:47:00,3295,catchin minnows on spons..must be fishin for bait. Looks like they were snagging them. Have they never heard of a minnow net?
504294,Cudz,2010-09-16 03:30:00,2652,"I like the one when he drops one on the ground and then says ""oh, il est mort"" then proceeds to step on him. lol.  At the very start he says double header (in french and pulls up two tiny minnows on his treble.  If it is tongue in cheek it is funny."
504526,Leecher,2010-09-17 00:02:00,7832,"Chris they're just goofing around..... had a good chuckle when the guy with the hat & glasses on the left said that he had a lure adapted to the fish size   French translation  ""Alors, j'ai un leurre adapté à la grosseur du poisson....""  Just good old French boys having fun Leechman"
