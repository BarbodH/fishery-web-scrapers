504980,fishinguypat,2010-09-19 03:35:00,547,I'm gonna go on a limb here and say the Crocodile came first
504988,denisk,2010-09-19 07:27:00,163, what about the alligator?  that's a spoon

504997,Roy,2010-09-19 12:19:00,13728,Gibbs was out much before the Jensen. Both companies have distinguished pasts but I prefer the Rufus Gibbs story. Rufus was a dude from Peterborough who moved to Vancouver...interesting as to how the company eventually changed hands but always stayed in the family. OH well...almost as good as reading the bible on a Sunday morning.

I've noticed tho that the Krocodile offers some of their spoons in different weights, but have the same physical size, eg; two spoons are 2.5"", but one is 3/8oz and the other is 5/8oz, which makes them very versatile.....as well as landed me my personal best Speckie!"
