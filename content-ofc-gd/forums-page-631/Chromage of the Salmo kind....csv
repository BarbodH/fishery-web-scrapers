The dark beat up old fish that were staging ran up river and a fresh batch of silver fish moved  up for the taking... Oooor they all ran up and there's nothing left for me to catch in the morning! Haha but I think I'll give it a shot!  I'll be at the mouth of the credit sometime around 5 am with gear in hand if anyone wants to join!  Cheers, Ryan"

504834,bongo,2010-09-18 02:52:00,67,"passed by the old mill at the Humber today, just watched a few people snagging fish its a real show, lol. Loads of fish swimming up to the dam, lots of them jumping over, and I believe I saw a few rainbows jumping with them.  So maybe the mouth of the credit won't have a whole lot of fish, but it should have some for sure"
