504643,mbac31,2010-09-17 12:55:00,904,I'm doing the Berkley B1 and would rather see the money go to an OFC'er first. I am looking for a cottage or House to rent for one week in the Valleyfield or Lancaster area. Just be using it basically to sleep at night and must be able to charge the boats. This will be for 2 guys maybe 4 not sure on the other 2 just yet. Non smokers and drinkers.  Can be paid in cash in person if need be. Hoping someone in the area could help out with this. I could also return the favor if someone needed to stay out this way for some reason as well.  Thanks

504750,mbac31,2010-09-17 20:48:00,904,"Thanks Roy, Yes I have a ton of friends in Quebec but just not there. You are a good distance from there for sure but if I'm out that way I will make sure to stop in and see ya."
504753,solopaddler,2010-09-17 20:53:00,8605,If Rouyn Noranda was close enough you could use my place Marvin.  A little out of the way though I think.
504998,mbac31,2010-09-19 12:21:00,904,"Lol. Yeah, thats a little drive. Thanks for the offer bud.  Someone has to have a hookup I could use before I have to start to call strangers. Lol"
505006,Roy,2010-09-19 13:38:00,13728,"OK Marvin, you might be in luck. Give me the day to look after it. I had supper last night on the waterfront with my daughter and her BF of 4 years. This is right in Tourney water. I'll get back to you."
