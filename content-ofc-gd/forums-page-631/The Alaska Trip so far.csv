504601,brandon,2010-09-17 03:53:00,857,"Just a quick update for everybody that's ineterested.  I've completed my drive from Windsor, Ontario to Anchorage, Alaska.  The whole trip was about 7800kms.  On saturday I fly to a town called King Salmon, AK right near Katmai National Park.  On Sunday I get flown in by float plane into Katmai for a week of Grizzly Photography.  I'll try and post another update once I'm back from that trip.  I'll save all the typing for my big super ultimate post when I'm back in Windsor....but for now, here's some photos taken over the last 3 or 4 days.  Sunwapta Falls, Banff/Jasper area   Overlander Falls, Mt. Robson Prov. Park, BC   Horses in McBride, BC       A couple other sets of waterfalls along the way        Caribou living the tough life    Couple other Caribou shots      Stone Sheep    Bison causing trouble on the road.  This big guy would step out in front of every car that approached    my favorite shot from the trip so far.....Sunrise on the Rancheria River, Yukon    And finally, the Alaska Highway........IN ALASKA!!  "
504602,Smarty Pantz,2010-09-17 03:57:00,203,Ohhhhh my goodiness!!! Those are absolutely amazing pictures!!! What a great trip   They are all so beautiful. Can't wait to see more
504603,bongo,2010-09-17 03:57:00,67,"I've been to those places in Banff/Jasper that you mentioned, just magical.  Those are amazing shots of scenery and wildlife, good work.  What kind of camera do you use ?"
504604,brandon,2010-09-17 04:02:00,857,"Those were all taken with a Canon 1D mk IV and with 14mm, 24-70mm, and 500mm lenses"
504605,Stern Rules,2010-09-17 04:20:00,342,What filter were you using to get those waterfall shots like that? I've always wanted to get those kind of shots. And great pics by the way.
504606,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-17 04:36:00,0,great pics.
504607,brandon,2010-09-17 04:37:00,857,"it was dark enough that I didn't need to use filters for those shots.  They were each a 1 to 2 second exposure at f/22.  shots like that are best to take either in dense forest, on overcast days, or just after sunset to allow you to slow down the shutter speed with out overexposing the photo.  If it's still not possible to get a 1 second exposure without over exposing, you can use a neutral density filter to cut out additonal light.  Hope this helps..."
504610,splashhopper,2010-09-17 08:10:00,2931,  Keep em coming please.  Thanks for bringing us along on your trip.  This Londoner appreciates it .
504611,spincast,2010-09-17 09:16:00,3279,"Amazing scenery. Mountains, waterfalls and long stretches of highway with views like that I find captivating. That Bison's antics are pretty interesting. Kind of like a toll gate - look forward to more shots!  "
504615,cynmar,2010-09-17 10:30:00,169,"Did you have a polarizing filter on to get the sky so blue and to see into the water? Beautiful shots, excellent work. I'm old school , still shooting film so don't know the Canon. Digital?  Bill"
504619,WeedLine,2010-09-17 11:25:00,322,Wow. Amazing stuff. Keep it coming and safe travels.
504622,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-17 11:53:00,2690,"I've been waiting for these.  Absolutely specatacular, can't wait to see the rest!!"
504623,Grimace,2010-09-17 11:56:00,2020,Impressive to say the least.  I love good photography.  I am very much looking forward to your full report.
504626,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-17 12:02:00,0,WOW! Great pictures. That camera definitely captures the beauty of our country. Those pictures are amazing.

504640,stubbex1,2010-09-17 12:29:00,164,absolutely stunning!!  can't wait for the rest!!!
504642,super dave,2010-09-17 12:53:00,323,Fantastic shots.  I was just in Jasper and Mt Robson a couple of weeks ago but my shots didn't turn out as nice as yours!
504672,bassman,2010-09-17 14:26:00,384,"Awesome photos, thanks for sharing."
504707,ctranter,2010-09-17 17:39:00,543,"This thread was a real delight to read, thanks for the post and keep em coming!  I'm really like those long exposures on the river to give it that smokey look,  If I remember right theres a tutorial for it in the photography section.  Does it have to be a really dark gloomy day to not overexpose?"
504710,brandon,2010-09-17 17:57:00,857,"Fishing Bill, there were no polarizers used in any of the shots...the sky is really THAT blue out here!  ctranter, the darker the day, the better.  but if it's still not dark enough, you can use neutral density filters to stop out extra light to get the slow shutter speed without over exposing  and to everyone else....thanks for the kind words and for reading!"
504711,BillM,2010-09-17 17:58:00,17367,Brandon those pics are absolutely amazing!!!  I'm about to pick up a 70-200 f/4L for some landscape and wildlife shots!!   Hopefully they are half as good as the pics you take
504715,Governator,2010-09-17 18:18:00,879,"Wow, Brandon those oustanding pics, you do great work - keep posting please.  Also, I didn't realize Bisons were that large, holy crap!"
504721,torco,2010-09-17 18:49:00,656,"Amazing pictures, can't wait to see more."
504722,Kawartha Kev,2010-09-17 18:50:00,281,Great shots as usual Brandon especially the waterfalls love those I haven't had time to take any lately but still remember when I started taking those kind of shots you taught me a lot. Thanks again!! Wish I had some of the camera equipment you have still just got my little 4.5 MegPixel point and shoot Nikon. Looking forward to seeing more of Alaska definitely God's country.  Kawartha Kev
