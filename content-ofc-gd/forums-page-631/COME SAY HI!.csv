After that I'll be down at Ontario Place untangling lines and baiting hooks for the Facts of Fishing Kids Fishing Day from 10 a.m. until 3 P.m.  Dave will be down there hanging out with the kids and they're giving away some awesome prize packs to  the first 400 kids!!   I met a few OFNer's there last year and would love to meet some more this year!  So come on down the credit and look for me or stop by Ontario Place!  Here's the link for more info: http://www.factsoffishing.com/blog/dave-mercer/facts-of-fishing-for-kids-day-at-ontario-place-is-back/ d Have a great weekend!  Cheers, Ryan"

By the time I got her out of Lebaron's 12:45(she went on a shopping spree). By the time she finished eating at McDonalds 1:30(She didn't want to go to drive thru.)Oh well...I did buy her a barbie rod and she has been practicing casting all afternoon!  So its a go for next year for sure!
