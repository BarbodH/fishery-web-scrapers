His boss heard me and came over with and directed me to the proper isle. that stuff is miraculous.once the stain and clear coat are completely dry, i plan on polishing the handle up with a good pastewax and buff it. I will use it for the purpose my father intended, and pass it down the line. when i removed the old handle, there was dryed up moose and deer blood between the handle and the blade that has been there for almost 50 years. You can see it on the inside of the old handles in the pictures. In my eyes its still the same knife, and knowing him like i did, i know he approves. thanks to all your input.  Paul        "

504966,mercman,2010-09-19 02:04:00,7054,"Thanks all !!! I appreciate the approval. Buying the boat and going fishing again resurfaced a lot on memories of fishing with him and my bro.Oh the tangles and knots we kids would end up with in our lines.He never got angry, just shook his head and laffed and went to work untangleing us. He was a warrant officer and was a proud soldier, but he was just dad with us."
