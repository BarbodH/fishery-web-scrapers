This is where we stayed, awesome place!   Thea fishing    Cole Fishing   Coles's big bass, he didn't want it to bite him     One of my many off the dock bass.    One of the american guys up fishing, who graciously invited me out with him   Another of Cole's bass. Caught on the Rocket fishing rod. Pretty Cool toy!     My daughter Thea and one of her big bass.      My buddy Carl with his bass and beer at 7:30 am!    First nite off the dock with worm and bobbers!    Probably one of the best weeks spent with my family and kids! The week before the weather was very hot and being in the hvac trade it was busy so the week off couldn't have come at a better time! Great weather and great friends!"

502652,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-09 15:03:00,0,Looks like a great family get away. Nice of the American to take you out. He probably taught you a thing or two. They really know their bass fishing!
503412,Tinman,2010-09-13 01:58:00,376," All they fished with all week was Ray with a white Senko and white crank bait and Dave used a white spinner with a white mister twister on it. They were hitting pike, walleye and bass, same 300 yards all week. I go out with them and i get nothing> lol had better luck off the dock!"

503516,Dave Bailey,2010-09-13 15:22:00,1641, As long as he realises that it isn't just for breakfast anymore!
504528,Tinman,2010-09-17 00:03:00,376,He was on a liquid diet all week lol
504587,scuro2,2010-09-17 02:22:00,904,That was the pic that caught my eye. How long did he stand there holding bass and drinking beer?
504629,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-17 12:12:00,0,Stop jumping to conclusions guys. Maybe the fish was brought back to camp to eat and he decided to crack open a beer before they got the camera out.
504851,Tinman,2010-09-18 11:46:00,376,"he actually ended up giving it to the americans guys in the cabin behind him, who ate it for breakfast"
