504929,lew,2010-09-18 21:23:00,12766,Your lures are top of the line Mike and you'll  do well with selling them.  I'll be giving a couple of them a good workout on Pigeon Lake tomorrow.
504930,Handlebarz,2010-09-18 21:36:00,3790,Good luck Lew I wish I had been out more this summer to give them a go but again I had to make changes to next weeks plans and am not heading to Cameron to see how well I could do. Hope you guys do well up there

504975,mercman,2010-09-19 02:43:00,7054,"are you looking for a banner to use on the net, or one for print. i can make you a graphic for use on a website. no problem and no charge. well maybe if you like them, we could trade them for a lure. I do good work too."
504989,Handlebarz,2010-09-19 09:14:00,3790,Ronnie I will call you tonight I did not change plans by choice you know it was just because you could not make it again so I will pick another day and see if your around if not I will change again for the third time as I need my guide     I bet Brian is getting sick of this trip getting put off.  Mercman I need to make one for the site here I will PM you and see what I need to send you to set it up or what you need to make it thanks for the offer.  Cheers Mike

505046,Tom McCutcheon,2010-09-19 18:16:00,627,"Mike;  If Mercman or Matt can get you done up with your banner or logo, if you want I can get you a price from our sign maker here in Peterborough. They do our KTD signs and also gave us a break on our 10 foot Kawartha Lakes MCI banner last year. They do good work.  Tom."
505052,Handlebarz,2010-09-19 18:56:00,3790,sounds good Tom I might look at a sign before April it might just come in handy I can run it on the side of the boat LOL
