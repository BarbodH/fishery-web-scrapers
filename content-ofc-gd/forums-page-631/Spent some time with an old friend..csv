Sunday we watched NFL football, but we fished four out of five days during the rest of the week.  Thursday it poured all day so we stayed home.  It rained on the other days too, but we still got a few hours in between showers.  My buddy is older than me and because of a balance problem, can no longer stand up in the boat.  We have to stay on small lakes because with poor equilibrium, he no longer feels safe in anything approaching rough water.  He tells me, with a grin, that ""Getting old is not for Sissy's!""  It's always good to get together with our friends.  This is especially so as we get older...grin. At this point, the fishing has become just an excuse to spend time together...But, even with all these restrictions we managed to catch a few nice fish.  Garry2R's"

I have off and on Vertigo and it really is a pain in the you know what.  Can't imagine having it full-time.  Joey"
