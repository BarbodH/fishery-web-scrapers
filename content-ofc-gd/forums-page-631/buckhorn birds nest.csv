504174,smally21,2010-09-15 20:02:00,993,"this is a large nest just outside the narrows. if you look close you can see the pair hanging out   this was built to be a double barrel barn heater, add a big grill and you got a giant smoker.  some more que porn - a sirloin tip smoked with hickory  full pork loin smoked with cherry and maple   four guys ate this pork loin with their fingers in under 10 minuters. it weighed just over 8 lbs!  was a shame to carve it but there is always another slab around the corner....

504180,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-15 20:30:00,0,I love seeing Osprey nests but like seeing them hunt even more. As far as the barbecue? Where is my dinner invitation! My cousin also converted one of those big steel barrels into a giant barbecue we bring to our family get togethers.
504209,Kawartha Kev,2010-09-15 23:28:00,281,Is that the osprey nest on Lower Buckhorn at the end of the narrows before you get out to the main part of the lake going east toward Reach Harbour it sure looks like it? As to being the biggest I'm not so sure I have seen lots of nest all over the lake and they all look huge some more than others. I have a picture of that same nest from a couple years ago. The biggest one I have seen used to be on the hydro pole on the north side of the lake in the narrows before they cut the wires going across the lake at that point. They now also nest on the south side pole but the nest is on a platform not a natural one. I'll try and find the pic to compare to your nest if it is the same one. By the way the BBQ looks YUMMMMMMMMMY!!! Kawartha Kev
504223,smally21,2010-09-15 23:57:00,993,"well im not trying to get into a ""who's got the biggest nest"" argument with anybody - as to it being the biggest im not gonna climb up and measure it.  youre right it is just outside the narrows and their is a nest in the hydro pole as well."
504316,Kawartha Kev,2010-09-16 11:39:00,281,"Here is a pic of the same nest from 2004   Dscn0294 by Kawartha Kev, on Flickr"
504328,smally21,2010-09-16 12:30:00,993,im curious if the same pair returns or if they scavenge eachothers nests - or do they just stay in it?
504333,Roy,2010-09-16 12:46:00,13728, Ospreys generally winter in the Southern states or farther south. They mate for life. That same nest will be taken by the same pair next year and the renovations will begin when they return.
504334,lew,2010-09-16 12:57:00,12766,I had a trailer on Katchawanooka Lake in the Kawarthas for 36 years and there was an Osprey nest on an island near us and there was a family of birds in that nest for that entire time. Really nice to watch them raise their families year after year.  There's been 5 or 6 different families of Osprey off and on over the years in different nests but none ever used the same nest for as many years.  A family of Bald Eagles also took up residence on the lake a few years back but they seem to have left the lake this year for some reason. Wonder if it had anything to do with all the Ospreys ??    
504337,smally21,2010-09-16 13:16:00,993,thats a great pic lew - you must be packing more camera that i am!
504341,lew,2010-09-16 13:23:00,12766," Actually it was just an ordinary digital camera, Canon PowerShot A720, 8 MP,  but I cropped the picture in full resolution before I edited it.  It did bring the picture out nice though."
504494,Kawartha Kev,2010-09-16 22:33:00,281,"I saw a couple of Bald eagles a couple weeks ago on Lower Buckhorn but not close enough for pics have also seen these guys pileated woodpeckers on the lake   Pileated Woodpecker Close-up by Kawartha Kev, on Flickr   Pileated Woodpecker by Kawartha Kev, on Flickr   Here's some Osprey    "
