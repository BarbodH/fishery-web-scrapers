504746,fisherboy,2010-09-17 20:35:00,48,There is another nice house at the southern part of Cook's Bay right at the mouth of a channel. Probably not as expensive as this one though. I think it was featured on some magazine before too.
503030,kickingfrog,2010-09-11 16:46:00,8333,... and I still could not buy this place on Simcoe.  How much is too much?  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/classic-european-design-on-lake-simcoe/article1701201/
503033,Muskieman,2010-09-11 17:14:00,2472,Wow.
503038,Terry,2010-09-11 17:36:00,14456,Damn  dad didn't even tell me he was selling it
503042,Oktravis,2010-09-11 17:43:00,62,that is crazy
503058,shane,2010-09-11 19:38:00,652,"Maybe, with your $15,000,000, you could buy the boathouse.  That's the best part of the whole place."
503061,kickingfrog,2010-09-11 20:05:00,8333,The taxes are over $24 THOUSAND per year... and there is bupkiss for services because it is not in the city.
503076,Cudz,2010-09-11 21:07:00,2652,"There are loads of nice houses on the north shore of kbay but that is my fave.  I was in the boat today and I past it and I would be happy living in the boat house.  I love that house.  Tazxes not too bad. That big grey house in Tollendale was listed at 7.5 million and because it was in Barrie their taxes were $67,500 per year.  You give me that house I would have a hard time paying to stay there."
503106,fishinguypat,2010-09-12 00:12:00,547,... you won 15 million!!!!!
503110,spincast,2010-09-12 00:18:00,3279,Why? No interest at all. Even if I had the bucks it would take.
503117,Tybo,2010-09-12 00:38:00,1373,One thing I notice. You can have a big house and lots of money. But in this case it didn't buy taste. The only thing I like is the pool.
503131,Dave Bailey,2010-09-12 01:05:00,1641,"I've often said that if I could afford a place like that I wouldn't buy a place like that. I would get an island in Georgian Bay with a cottage, a DHC-2 Beaver on floats to get in and out of it, and few would ever see me again."
503144,SlowPoke,2010-09-12 01:39:00,2984," I asked the same question of a 6 bedroom cottage on Cresent harbour Rd. (Mapleview). My wife's uncle stated that he want's his kids and their families to be able to enjoy it on their own or all together without sacrificing comfort. Fair enough. It also doesn't hurt that its been a safe investment. Okay, I'll give him that. But then again, we're talking a fraction of the value and only $8000/yr in taxes. I'm sure he'd be in the ""that's damn rediculous!"" camp along with the rest of us regarding that place!  Was it the Zellers patio furniture that turned you off? The pool is pretty slick!"
503152,Fish Farmer,2010-09-12 02:20:00,2234,"Funny, I could enjoy sitting in front of his place in my Clam fishing for Perch and Whitefish and not pay any taxes, cut all that grass, skim that pool. ""Oh"" to not be rich is the way I like it."
503163,danbouck,2010-09-12 02:46:00,4380,It has an amazing elevator too
503257,Rob,2010-09-12 14:59:00,467,"I think that is the house that Brian B and I were fishing in front of, and Brian said to the guy ""Hey nice house"" and the guy replies in a European accent "" that is not a house, it is our cottage""   Brian muttered a few words to me that are not acceptable in this type of forum!!!  Rob C"
503420,Guest 2uniq,2010-09-13 02:07:00,0,I hate the interior. It's too old fashioned for me.
503442,sheyuid,2010-09-13 02:52:00,25,"you only can buy the house, but who will pay the tax? win one more!!!!"

503543,xkempx,2010-09-13 17:30:00,84,Thats Small....
503555,Rod Caster,2010-09-13 19:12:00,5784,I wash my dishes in a tub.
503623,jedimaster,2010-09-14 00:15:00,3472,You would think the pool with come with a few Attendants.
503636,crappieperchhunter,2010-09-14 00:30:00,2582,"Not my style, nor is it in my snack bracket... but a beautiful place none the less.  If you got it...spend it and enjoy it...you can't take it with you."
503661,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-14 01:10:00,932,Man . . . that place is sweet!
503663,solopaddler,2010-09-14 01:10:00,8605,"I say if you've got it spend it!  Quoted from the article:  ""The library has walls panelled in wood from butternut trees.  “It’s hard to get. That’s what we learned during the construction,” Mr. Bell says of the butternut.""  Of course it's hard to get butternut wood! If it wasn't hard to get every hovel inhabited by the unwashed masses would be lined with it!  Excuse me now, I have to get back to my puppy mill."
503735,SlowPoke,2010-09-14 09:18:00,2984,Exactly what are you implying? The butternut I used for my shed was a bit of a chore to find but not as bad as sourcing pink ivory for the fascia.
