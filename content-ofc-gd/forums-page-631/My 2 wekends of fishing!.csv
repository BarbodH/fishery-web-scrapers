We scowered the lake for most of the day,not knowing!Then pay dirt!But Shhhh! I set my daughters line so she can will feel the hits!and become accostom to her new rod/reel combo! Well after having a feel for the lake I hit the deep end trolling and jigging,Samanthas rod went down and a 9"" sunfish was on the other end At the same time mine went down while handling the sunfish,a 3 lb rainbow was on,then lost feet from the boat!OH well! After fishing we hit Ryans place!  Youve all seen the pics!While ryan drawing out names mine came up,and thanks to some one that pointed out Leechmans Bass Kit!I had to have it!And got it!
