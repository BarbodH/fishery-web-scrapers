504551,Muskieman,2010-09-17 00:47:00,2472,"@ 8:00 I decided to go out for a few casts at the river down the hill.  I grabbed my baitcaster from the boat which had an X-Rap on it 8:15 by the time my lure hit the water... fourth cast and BANG!  After a short fight , I took a picture and released it... Walked back to my truck, went to pick up a few coffee @ Hortons and made it back home and posted this in less than an hour..  No tape or scale.. your guess is as good as mine..I'd say about 3lbs   Randy "

504557,spincast,2010-09-17 01:00:00,3279,for me four casts is like the bottomless cup of coffee --- I can always find a reason for 1 more.................. but that is a sweet little wake up .
504561,GBW,2010-09-17 01:04:00,8460,nice eye Randy.
504566,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-17 01:13:00,0,nice fish and glad to hear it went back. wouldn't be near as tasty and a 1.5lb fish anyways!
504567,Leecher,2010-09-17 01:24:00,7832,Un christy beau doré Randy Félicitation Moi j'y donne 4lbs+ Doesn't get any better then that!!! Thanks for sharing Jacques
504568,danc,2010-09-17 01:27:00,4677,Nice Randy. I think that your being modest with the 3 lb. estimate. Congrats on your mini outing. Bet you spent more at Timmies drive through than you did fishing.
504575,Grimace,2010-09-17 01:39:00,2020,"Your all business man.  Grab a coffee, walk down to the river, 4 casts in nail a nice Walleye, go home rod slung firmly over shoulder.   Nothing to it.  lol.  You can't beat an evening like that, even if it only took you ten minutes."
504579,Rod Caster,2010-09-17 01:52:00,5784,"Tres beau!  Four casts and a 2.5-3.5lbs walleye? Simply put, you're the man."
504583,GBW,2010-09-17 01:58:00,8460,"The pic is a bit fuzzy, is that a big ""mallow"" there I see?"
504584,Muskieman,2010-09-17 02:13:00,2472, I squish it and roll it up to look like an X_rap..
504591,TerryC,2010-09-17 02:29:00,196,"Nice Fish, I think I might have stayed for another cast or two though.  Clarence"
504594,Nipfisher,2010-09-17 02:49:00,2449,Nice walleye Randy. I'm a bit suprised that they are still up or back in the river. Coffee at 9pm?? Do you sleep?
504596,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-17 03:00:00,0, lol i think 2.5 is out of the question.
504618,Muskieman,2010-09-17 11:12:00,2472, The Falleye migration is in full swing and will just get better from now 'til closing. The coffee I picked up was for this morning.  Randy
