501375,fisherboy,2010-09-04 13:06:00,48,"Hello! I just returned to the OFC forum. I used to be a member here and had made maybe more than a hundred posts. But I was away for a while and had to re-register myself (don't know why my old ID got canceled). Anyway, thought I would drop by just to say hi. I am from Markham and typically put my boat in the Kawarthas. Just love fishing and try to go out every weekend whenever possible. Last year I was on Sturgeon Lake and this season I have been fishing Rice Lake. Maybe it has to do with my skills, but I find fishing over there getting very tough."
501391,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-04 15:01:00,0, Welcome back! What? No pictures?
501450,Bly,2010-09-05 00:00:00,1556,"Welcome back.  I don't fish Rice Lake much myself but I do know that it receives a lot of fishing pressure, perhaps that is why you are having trouble.  Good luck and look forward to hearing that you are having some success."
501509,Leecher,2010-09-05 03:34:00,7832,Welcome back fisherboy I remember some of your post but it's been some time now.... great that you drop by and say hi Leechman

504755,Roy,2010-09-17 21:07:00,13728, You can have two pics in your profile. One is an avatar pic the other is a profile pic. My guess is that you put the pic in your profile instead of in your avatar file.
504758,fisherboy,2010-09-17 21:15:00,48,"Ah, done. I know that was a stupid question. Thanks Roy."
504762,Roy,2010-09-17 21:27:00,13728, Questions are seldom stupid. Some answers are really dumb though.  Nice pic.
504766,Grimace,2010-09-17 21:31:00,2020,People who ask questions are stupid for a few minutes. Those that don't are stupid forever.  Lol  welcome back
