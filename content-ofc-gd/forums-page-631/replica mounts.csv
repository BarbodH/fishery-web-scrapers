504489,Rizzo,2010-09-16 22:12:00,4754,I'm aware of Advance Taxidermy doing replica mounts. Has anyone had experience with anyone else or are they the only show in town?
504493,Pigeontroller,2010-09-16 22:31:00,2793,"  Advance(CDN), Fittante, or Lax...  Rizzo, did you catch a monster you're not telling us about?"
504506,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-16 23:12:00,0,"i've see a few that were kind of strange looking, then again, i've seen real mounts that were pretty screwed up.  someone with talent, and a reputable business will make you happy."
504521,Rizzo,2010-09-16 23:50:00,4754," haha, you guys would be the first to know if I did! Just planning ahead, thought it would be nice some day."
504525,PAZE,2010-09-17 00:01:00,132,"I use proline, for me they are the best around.  http://www.prolinetaxidermy.com/   Paul"
504608,Carp,2010-09-17 04:48:00,1488,I went to school with the guys at Advanced. Known one of them since we were little kids. (about 35 years) They've done a few fish for some of my friends and family. Always excellent work !
504648,jimmer,2010-09-17 13:12:00,2730,"Go to the galleries of the various taxidermists that offer replicas and compare the paint jobs and the detailed finishing.  You will find a wide range of quality.  Some just have the knack and skill to bring them to life, others just can't duplicate the colours and patterns on the fish. You will find more in the States, but I think that Shawn and James of Advanced probably offer the best paint jobs.  Expensive, but they last a lifetime. Check out New Wave Taxidermy in Florida, but I still think that Advanced do a better job."
504662,tonyb,2010-09-17 14:04:00,1637,"I've seen 4 fish done in the last year from Advanced Taxidermy, including one for myself, and all of them have been outstanding in detail and are painted to true life perfection.  It's almost creepy how realistic they are, looks like you just caught it and pinned it to the wall  Check out the size of the fish! haha couldn't stretch my arms out much further      I plan to have my PB smallmouth done in the near future as well."
504667,anders,2010-09-17 14:12:00,1168,thats awesome Tony!
504668,Lunkerhunter,2010-09-17 14:18:00,455,"i pick up my replica from advanced in decemeber! i cant wait. there studio is something else though, i was quite impressed with the quality."
504761,Fisherpete,2010-09-17 21:25:00,1814,"I had my first big muskie (45"") done by Advanced in 2005... and am very happy with it. Their shop truly is a sight to see, some AMAZING fish in there, and you can watch your fish progress through the stages as they make it... it does take quite a while though, mine took 9 months. Their paint jobs are the best that I have seen.          "
504770,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-17 21:44:00,0,"I've had two fish done by Sean and James at Advanced. One 54"" Musky which they did a fantastic job on. Thankfully it was half the price it would be today. lol  I had a Large Mouth(green carp   ) done as well. I also had a lake trout that was done by Gunters Taxidermy up Parry Sound way, fixed up by Advanced.  The real Lake Trout mount only lasted 5 years before it started to fall apart. All look Mint still."
504774,buckster,2010-09-17 21:51:00,530,I second proline they do great work at reasonable prices!
504775,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-17 22:04:00,0,  Proline used to show Advanced work in their window.  Seans Salmon he won a boat with in the Toronto Salmon hunt.   Go figure. ..but I'm sure they do fine work now.
