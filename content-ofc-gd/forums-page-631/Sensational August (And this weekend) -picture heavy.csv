501977,cowanjo,2010-09-07 02:20:00,249,"I would start by thanking all who helped a newcomer to canada really find a passion here, all were released to swim another day - cannot thank the guys who told me to get wire cutters. They are used on nearly every fish in lieu of hand grenade in mouths which I see often  Lets start with the weekend just past - all I can say is - rough and scary at times. My new boat really got a workout. For all those who responded earlier this year - the smokercraft is an awesome stable boat - Fished with my mate Terry and the wire cutters were in overdrive    We got out after lunch on Saturday - wow tough conditions - could not hold position to much swell and wave so decided trolling way to go - caught this one about moon rise at 2pm    Terry chimed in later - good to see the lake in such health    and he kept providing    What a great weekend. I havent posted in a while - I shared some great times with Ryan (First Muskie), Gary (First this year),Kevin and Lee (Many but has got the bug back in 2010) here is August update for you - note Mark also fished with me but he is still wearing a black and white jersey (for those who know me you should understand this  Gary and his first of 2010    Ryan amd his first ever - not the scared look after i have netted cut out the hooks and handed over said fish     Terry Multiple - I am too nice a host to him!          Now to my month - more difficult fish by myself sometimes - quick snap when they are in the net or hopefully by the boat if easily unhooked some also with my friends above - I know some of these will look very dark - for those who know me I follow the solunar tables - so i am out there deep into the night  I liked this one note the free lure thrown in!            I can not forget Lee    Or Kevin    I also had some great fun fishing for other species with Gary (note there were a great number of mossies    "

501988,Joey,2010-09-07 02:50:00,9122,"Wow, lots skis, and good friends too, well done  Was that free lure on the fish?  Joey"
502002,fisherboy,2010-09-07 04:40:00,48,That's a lot of muskie in one month!
502029,corvette1,2010-09-07 11:57:00,1765,awesome skis congrats
502036,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-07 12:24:00,0,Great Musky report. You really slayed them. Thanks for sharing!
502206,msp,2010-09-07 22:17:00,1336,Great season so far. Some nice musky. Its interesting how you said that you follow the moon phases.....do you care to elaborate?
502208,Rod Caster,2010-09-07 22:34:00,5784,That's gotta be over 200lbs of musky.  
502211,tb4me,2010-09-07 22:49:00,3295,Nice!   good work my man! I still havent been able to land one of those monsters.
502218,Roy,2010-09-07 23:09:00,13728,"A very good thread and great pics of very nice fish, thank you for sharing. People will not catch more fish by looking at the moon data on weather channels. Things like full moon, new moon etc will not help. If you're really interested in how it all comes together, get yourself a book by John Aldon Knight...one of them is called ""Moon Up, Moon Down"". Moon phases are just a part of many things coming together to form a pattern. It works."
502242,mercman,2010-09-08 00:35:00,7054,i think i need a bigger boat !!! if i'm gonna catch me some of those !!! been looking at a princecraft pro 165 for next spring. just got to sell my fisherman first  nice skis !!!
502269,cowanjo,2010-09-08 01:53:00,249," Roy is absolutely right there is more science too this, I was taught when my uncle had a prawn trawler in South West Rocks (Kinchela) Australia - add some weather and knowledge and get out there late in the dark it is truly scary and amazing to hear a splash in the dark. this is my third year fishing muskie and my logs are the most beneficial piece of information i have coupled with a great knowledge of my lake. The nice part is that as usual iphone has really helped out - it is not about moon up or down but the solunar tables. I use an iphone app - I dont want to plug them here - good luck to all"
502280,Moosebunk,2010-09-08 02:31:00,3970,WOW MAN!!!  Great showing for August.  Looking forward to September.  The SmokerCraft is a sharp looking boat too.
502284,alphaalpha,2010-09-08 02:53:00,475,"Great report, thanks for sharing."
502289,Pigeontroller,2010-09-08 03:25:00,2793,"Nice load of Fish John!  Ahhmm, maybe get a bigger net..."
502377,diggyj,2010-09-08 16:58:00,548,Great report and some sweet looking Muskies.  Dirk
502520,Leecher,2010-09-09 01:42:00,7832,An awesome collection of muskies cowanjo Congrats Leechman
504802,fisherboy,2010-09-18 00:06:00,48,I'm going to check out the solunar tables cowanjo suggested and see if they really are accurate (to a certain extent). I use Palm Pre which seems to have some moon phase apps too...
504821,limeyangler,2010-09-18 02:11:00,5204,"WOW, phenomenal musky fishing, good job!  Thanks for posting."
