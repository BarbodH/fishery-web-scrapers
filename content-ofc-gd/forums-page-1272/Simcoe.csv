Thanx in advance"
32697,Fishnfiend,2007-02-09 15:23:00,357,"Depends what side of Simcoe you want to fish and what you want to fish for...  I always had a good time renting a hut from Floyd Hales to fish perch.  He is on the Beaverton side.  I recommend perch if you don't do much fishing and pretty much want a guarantee of catching fish.  You can go for lakers and/or whities all day and only get one hit (if you are lucky).  I don't rent anymore as I have a portable now.  Although, I might do the ice bungalow thing on Nippising one of these years.  Just my $0.02"
