Well, this afternoon, me & ole Marv were hiking down in the woods when I heard a very familiar chirping sound, looked up on a branch just 10"" above me and spotted my 1st robin of the year, just sitting there and enjoying the sunshine  yeah, yeah, I know, some  robins do spend the winters up here in the frozen barrens, but I'm still gonna take it as a sign that were on the downhill side of winter and springtime and warm weather is just around the corner"
32814,Canuck2fan,2007-02-09 22:39:00,1444,I am sold on that plan bring on the thaw!!!!
32820,northwood,2007-02-09 22:50:00,63,""" Not a chance boy's,.."" Hard water here to stay.."
32822,GbayGiant,2007-02-09 22:58:00,1780,"As long as the waters open for opening day walleye and pike (last weekend of May on GB) and musky it's all good, if the ice goes to early I'll have nothing to fish for until then anyway. Come April "" let it rain, let it rain """
32838,mattyk,2007-02-09 23:24:00,2110,i hope so. Im alreadytired of winter.
32849,Guest gbfisher,2007-02-10 00:17:00,0,  Unless it has changed.    Its the 1rst of May for Pike and Pics and the last weekend in June for Musky. Don't think ya have to be to worried about ice then...Ice is usually off the first  week in April. I can say that I am lookin forward to the ice stayin around a while....  
32861,bucktail,2007-02-10 01:05:00,1857,We have ahad a robin and a mockingbird hanging out all year. Bet they are hurting now!!!
32888,Clampet,2007-02-10 02:14:00,1947,Do u have a bird feeder Lew?
32889,nautifish,2007-02-10 02:16:00,1416,You should see my tulips. I think they think its spring allready.
32892,fishindevil,2007-02-10 02:23:00,6254,"yes lew you are right down around deseronto,napenee area there is lots of robins that winter there   we see them all the time,its becuase that area has alot of a certain kind of berry that only becomes edible when they freeze,i have read about it as well and there is several other species of birds that are suposed to fly south yet stay in that area ..its the only area that these birds will be...kinda neat to see a robin when its  -20 and snowing....very interesting"
32894,Cookslav,2007-02-10 02:31:00,1457,I like the way you think Lew!!! I'll gladly take Spring....any day now.
32897,Greencoachdog,2007-02-10 02:41:00,8163,Don't Believe it Lew!!!... those good for nothin' Groundhogs would rather climb the tallest tree in the forest and tell a lie... than stand on the ground and tell the truth!
32907,GbayGiant,2007-02-10 03:30:00,1780," Ya, either way the ice is always out by the opening date,I'll be out the first day."
32952,dsn,2007-02-10 12:07:00,1018,"   I'm with you northwood, I haven't even touched the ice yet.  dsn"
32953,Rich Clemens,2007-02-10 12:16:00,3131,"Hmmmm ... I wonder when the folks of eastern New York will see spring ?    At 8' of snow on the ground in some places, it may be a while for them.  Geez, I can't image having that much on the ground."
