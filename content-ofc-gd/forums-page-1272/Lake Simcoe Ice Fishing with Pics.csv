31650,spoonman,2007-02-06 21:15:00,103,I managed to get out on the weekend for some Ice fishing at Jackson Point on Simcoe. Due to the really cold weather and winds we decided to rent a hut for the day. It turned out to be a good decision because the wind chill was -30. We fished in roughly 60 feet of water for whitefish and Lake trout. We ended up 1 for 3. We had spreaders on the bottom and then jigging spoons on our rods. There were tons of people out and lots of skidoo traffic as well.  Here is a picture of our hut   Lots of hut out now   Shaun with his 1st ever whitefish   Cheers AL www.alsadventures.ca
