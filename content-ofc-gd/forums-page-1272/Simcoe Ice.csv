32858,lilkynan,2007-02-10 00:56:00,173,I am hearing the the ice is failing on Cookes bay at the top?? - any one else hear or know  - was planning on hitting line 9 in the morning - TY
32866,T Fisher,2007-02-10 01:20:00,139,"Sorry not near the 8 line but I was at Kemp Bay today and ice was 5 to 7 inches coverd with fresh snow. Add to that 2 inches of slush made my 1k walk feel more like 10k, I'm hurting now ADVIL here I come."
32871,irishfield,2007-02-10 01:30:00,26272,"All this snow can't be good...if Barrie got the 2 to 3 feet we got here in Penetang since I left on Tuesday.  Also note that while everyone thinks a few days of -15C produces ice like crazy...I just came back from Temagami and some easy drilling, as there was only 11 inches of ice around my dock and it's been in the -30C area for weeks up there. Also really not any snow (6inches max!) to insulate...but obviously enough to really slow ice formation. Be safe out there and be sure you know the area you are playing in."

32925,xrap,2007-02-10 04:23:00,683,I was wlaking on a lake and there was slush in some parts and I thogut it meant that the ice is unsafe. Is it still ok to walk if you see slush in the middle of the lake?
32947,Clampet,2007-02-10 09:32:00,1947,"Yes. Wear rubberized insulated boots, of course, and check fer the thickness every 10-20 feet or so. When snowmobiling thru slush, it is important to go as quickly as possible thru it or the machine will bog down in it."
32950,dsn,2007-02-10 11:51:00,1018,"As I always said if you walk out on your own... ""you're on your own!"" If your with an operator they watch your back.     dsn  stay safe!!"
32959,boatman,2007-02-10 12:59:00,350,"Take a tip from a professional...  Always check the ice as you go. Walk with a needle bar or a (very sharp) ice chisel and throw the end into the ice ahead of you as you walk. If it goes through on the first throw it is too thin. Occassionally, check for thickness. The ice might be 4"" in one spot, but less than 2"" just a few feet away."
