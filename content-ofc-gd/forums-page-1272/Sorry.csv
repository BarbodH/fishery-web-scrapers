31982,fishnsled,2007-02-07 16:16:00,3520,"I guess that with the software change over there was a glich and I had a few of my friends end up on my blocked list.  For the record I don't have anyone blocked, well now there isn't.  So if anyone was trying to contact me and it said you were block, sorry.  Messages should come in fine now.  Anyone else have this problem?"
31987,misfish,2007-02-07 16:19:00,29133,"Thats a shame cause I sent you one to ask if you want a share of the million dollars I won,no reply so no dough.LOL"

31996,caper,2007-02-07 16:30:00,210,"After reading this I thought oh, mine must have blocked everyone out cause no messages.. I checked, nope nobody blocked out!! Oh well..."
31998,Joey,2007-02-07 16:38:00,9122,"Yep, ditto here too.  Mine had dear old TJQ blocked      I thought the admins were trying to tell me something    , .....or are they"

32148,wuchikubo,2007-02-07 23:50:00,1114,"Same thing happened here, I just deleted all the one's listed as blocked. I guess anyone who had others listed as ""friends"" before got this problem.  Everyone, remember to check ""My Controls"" to make sure it hasn't happened accidentally to you too.  Stan"
