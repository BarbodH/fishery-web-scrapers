The detail was fantastic I could see my MEEGS lure at 80ft on half sensitvitey in both flasher and the regular screen. A great unit for sure. I did have one complant, the swing arm that holds the transduser is Mickey Mouse LOWRANCE YOU NEED TO HAVE A FOAM AND STOPPER FOR THE TRANSDUSER TAKE A LOOK AT THE VEXLAR."
