32921,007,2007-02-10 04:19:00,537,I've seen a few people mention bait spreaders in relation to ice fishing but I can't find what they are in any of the books/mags I've got.  What are they? Do I need one for Lake Simcoe? Are they for a particular way of fishing or for targetting a particular species?  Cheers 007

One word of caution, if putting a ""high hook"" (5-15 ft up the line) for lakers or suspended whitefish, be careful handlining the last few feet it the fish runs-ouch."
33053,camillj,2007-02-10 20:44:00,1988,I stopped using spreaders ... too much twisting and tangling .... I have found I get much more action on a single hook with a split shot above the minnow ... ok ..I'll admit it ... sometimes theres a stinger involved for bigger baits (laid in the mud) but the spreaders seem to be more trouble and I dont like the 'clunky' look.. it seems to me the smaller fish get confused watching the minnows chase each other in circles .... and I think it scares away the bigger wiser fish  I guess its all about confidence really ...
