As you drive along, you'll come to a little fork in the road; keep left, and you'll be right at a few summer parking spots.  I don't know the condition in winter, though.  If you keep driving north, you'll come to a second parking and boat-launch area."
32828,Grimace,2007-02-09 23:03:00,2020,"I went out the other day and parked at Gilford.   Park right out on the ice near shore.   People were driving right out but they are braver than I.  I wouldnt suggest parking lot style parking on the ice either, go up a bit and find your own little spot."

Cost about $10 I think, but you're right at the lake. I would think it's very tough to walk right now.  Just spoke to The Pines Hut Rental in Oro Station. My dad and uncle store their hut there for the off season and get it brought in / out of the lake in winter. They said people with snowmobiles were getting stuck. Lots of snow, water and slush on top of the ice.  Good luck."
