32445,Mike Pike,2007-02-08 19:23:00,1332,A friend of mine said she drives by this plaza in Kitchener on Albert Street near Philip and notices a portable sign that says there is a tackle store opening up there in March.  It's close to where I work so I'm happy!  Hoping it's a nice shop.   Just an FYI for K-W anglers.
32457,troutologist,2007-02-08 20:14:00,951,Thatd be sweet cuz both now are a ways of a drive from me. Im gonna keep an eye out.
32470,jordan,2007-02-08 21:04:00,136,It is called fishing Fanatics. And i know the guys who run it and they r really nice guys.     jordan
32499,Bob Devine,2007-02-08 23:16:00,251,I have had the chance to meet the Finactics and would like to wish them the best at their new location. They are great guys and very knowledgeable.
32615,jediangler,2007-02-09 09:35:00,1923,Can't wait to check them out. We need some alternative choices now that Rainbow Tackle is gone.
32657,mikemcmillan,2007-02-09 13:38:00,50,"There is a place in Guelph on Hwy 7 near the Hanlon, I think it's new as well, drove past it the other day, first time I've seen it, don't know if it's new or not but I will be checking both places out. Hope they both prosper."
32658,Mike Pike,2007-02-09 13:39:00,1332,"Fishing Fanatics, eh?  That's a cool name.  I wish the boys luck.  I always thought that for a place the size of K-W, it was short a tackle store or two.  Natural Sports is a great store (IMHO) with a good stock of specialty stuff, and now it sounds like there's gonna be a a place for people who live on the other side of town."
32659,troutologist,2007-02-09 13:43:00,951,  Rainbow is back open under new management....
32660,snackpack5150,2007-02-09 13:44:00,79,Thanks for the info... maybe it will give the guys at Natural sports a little run and bring prices in line a bit.  Always want to support the local guys instead of the big onese like BPS.  Ken
32693,Fanatic,2007-02-09 15:17:00,2,"Jordan and Bob we appreciate the compliments.  It’s nice to hear the interest and we’re looking forward to meeting everyone.  We’ll be opening March 10th, can’t wait!!"
32817,joonmoon,2007-02-09 22:47:00,528,"Sounds good the more the merrier. Just gotta luv the competition this could spark, eh!."
32823,silveradosheriff,2007-02-09 22:59:00,1025,"Excellent news, well that there is a new store.....not that Rainbow has re-opened.  :-)"
32936,Lenny,2007-02-10 05:15:00,1,"Hello everyone!  I am also one of the Fanatics.  It is great to see all the interest in our store.  Being nuts about fishing is what Fanatics is all about, and I can assure you that we are all very avid anglers.  Jordan is one of my fishing buddies, I netted that big buck in his avatar after it put up quite a spirited fight."
32956,JEREMY,2007-02-10 12:50:00,300,Good luck with the store guys.If i am ever that way i will stop in and say hi.
