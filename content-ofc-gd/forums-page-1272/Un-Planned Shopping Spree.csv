Have a problem with a product... doesnt matter if it was 30 seconds old... you deal with the manufacturer and send it off... To be honest? I am surprised it took this long.... Good Riddance ProGear....  I just hope your employees can find other jobs that are NOT involved with dealing with the public.... I hope you are getting raped by selling your remaining inventory at a loss....  I should add I was counting the days...knowing this was going to happen.. you can only get so far business without offering customer service.... then people (Like myself) would rather pay more, but know if we have a problem it will be looked after... this has been a long time coming and I am GLAD to see it finally happen .... do yourself a favour... stay OUT of retail.. leave it to the shops that actually care about repeat business.
