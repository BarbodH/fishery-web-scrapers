31514,Smokey,2007-02-06 14:01:00,1278,Nice fish. Looks like you had a great time up there congrats on the beauty pike.
31720,joonmoon,2007-02-07 00:39:00,528,"Yup thanks all, I think the Cherryhill Gang should all wear their PJ's on Pike opener Jedi...afterall thats what I fish in almost exclusively...lol."
33089,JEREMY,2007-02-10 23:16:00,300,I was just on canadian sport fishing site just browsing and said to myself hey i have allready seen that pic on OFC its you and  the wife wearing the pjs.looks like a good time had by all
31040,joonmoon,2007-02-05 16:18:00,528,"Hey guys/gals finally we get out for some of the hardwater action. Headed up to Chilly Willys for the weekend to fish the South Bay area. We were pleasantly surprized when we arrived, the fish were on. We had a few good bites right off the hop, but missed em. Then jigging a buckshot and minnow I picked up a nice eye in the slot so he was promptly released.    The local railway workin guys were out at their shack close to us and had found a pattern for decent eyes, they were cookin em as quik as they were catchin em. But the bite slowed for us. The next day after breakfast the bite started again. My wife got serious with this 38"" and decided its time to show everyone how to land a pike.    Then the bite was gone for the majority of the day til later in the afternoon when I iced this little guy.    In total we didn't have numbers but we did get some fish. A few perch and the one eye, and a couple of pike. Overall the accomodations were great and the company was as good.     We were both sick this weekend and thought some fresh northern air might help. She battling a head and chest cold and I fighting the flu. We would recommend http://www.chillywillys.ca/ to anyone, the heated jonny was a nice addition to our ice weekend."
31049,trapshooter,2007-02-05 16:25:00,1234,"That's one of the nicest pike I've seen reported this winter!  What a HOG..... did she get it jigging or on tip-up?  Thanks for the great report!  Cheers, ben."
31052,mattyk,2007-02-05 16:27:00,2110,"Thats a dandy of a pike, nice work."
31053,ccmtcanada,2007-02-05 16:29:00,7971,Wow!!! Fantasic fish..esp that pike!  Great going guys.  Hope the outing helped with your cold/flu.  It looked like you had a good time.  Thanks for takin the time to post this report...it was a great one.
31055,Fishnfiend,2007-02-05 16:33:00,357,Nice report and AWESOME pike!
31057,joonmoon,2007-02-05 16:34:00,528,"That fish hit a small panfish sized jig/live minnow. The rod was in a wire holder and I just happened to see it twitch out of the corner of my eye, as I picked it up and felt the weight of a fish I handed it to her and she thumped em and the 10 min battle on 6lb test began. Having to shove the rod down into the hole several times and the reel just a screamin. The owner of Chilly Willy's was there and he reached down the hole on a second attempt to land it and came up with it. It sure made the trip a beauty. Too bad the weather really sucked on the way home. It took us 4 hours to get to Orillia and then once we hit Barrie clear skies. Kitchener looked the same as Gravenhurst when we pulled into town."
31059,Sherriff,2007-02-05 16:35:00,252,Great pike and looks like the trip was a blast....  Sherriff
31063,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-05 16:39:00,0,Great report and a beauty pike.  Congrats
31066,joonmoon,2007-02-05 16:41:00,528,Thanks everyone and we did have a good time.
31067,lew,2007-02-05 16:41:00,12767,"Awesome pike, definetely the best I've seen thru the ice this year !!"
31073,OhioFisherman,2007-02-05 16:47:00,6623,Nice fat pike! Dang them condos look better than some of the houses down here!
31075,cityfisher,2007-02-05 16:51:00,959,wow amazing ! me and a couple buddies were also staying in a bungalow in the south shore area over the weekend.... the bite was SLOWWWWW .. but we managed 5 walleye all under the slot 12-15 inches and some dinky perch...  a couple bungalows over landed a 14 lb pike on sat also ...good to see the big boyz around
31090,Greencoachdog,2007-02-05 17:14:00,8163,That is one heckuva Pike on 6 lb. line!!!
31096,irishfield,2007-02-05 17:26:00,26272,Nothing wrong with catchin a large pike while still wearin your jammies! LOL  Great stuff...driving trucks on the lake now? How thicks the ice?
31110,1leggedangler,2007-02-05 17:41:00,364,"Awesome report! Thanks for sharing.  Cheers, 1leg"
31111,trapshooter,2007-02-05 17:44:00,1234," Wayne, they have been driving trucks on Nipissing for a while now.  I've punched through (by hand) 18"" on the south shore, over a mile out."
31132,joonmoon,2007-02-05 18:28:00,528,"Yup the ice hiways are all open but there is some heavy duty snow on top. Seen several guys get stuck, sleds pullin huts and ATVs and a few pick up trucks all bottoming out and plowing snow. If ya got tank tracks use em."
31133,cityfisher,2007-02-05 18:30:00,959,i saw 3 hummers out on the lake going FAST along with HUNDREDS of trucks / cars not to mention atv/sleds... its a zoo out there
31159,Clampet,2007-02-05 19:10:00,1947,"Joon Moon, I guestimate that Pike to be 17.5 lbs.  Nice one! I also like the size of the windows on the ice shanty.  That is rare.  Most have tiny little windows near the ceiling.  Good to hear cars and truck on the ice, but like you said, ifn ya don't have experience drivin on the lake, you'll get stuck.  An ol friend of mine prctically lived on the ice, and he drove an old 2 wheel drive pick-up truck, and went places on the lake where people got stuck in their new 4x4s.  You gotta know when to speed up Know when ta slow down (Sung to the tune ""The gambler"" by Kenny Rogers)."
31173,Joey,2007-02-05 19:27:00,9122,Great report Joonmoon.  Tell your wife I LOVE the pajamas  Joey

31413,jediangler,2007-02-06 01:58:00,1923,"Another great report Joonmoon. Congrats to Goog on that beauty pike, and in her PJ's as well. I think I'll wear mine on pike opener this spring and see if I can't land one that big."
