32672,krawler,2007-02-09 14:13:00,167,Anyone been fishing this area recently??  looking for any reports from the area.  lots of fishing opportunites up there.  will be up for the next few weekends.  thanks
32943,irishfield,2007-02-10 05:59:00,26272,No fishing...but there is now over 2 feet of snow on top of the ice..and the ice in Midland Harbour is less than 8 inches thick.
32945,camillj,2007-02-10 06:35:00,1988,"Wow thats scarey Wayne ... I drove through Waubaushene on the weekend and saw an entire hut ""village"" out there ... I was pretty surprised as theres a fair amount of current and we all know how iffy the ice has been even in the 'best' locations ...."
32946,irishfield,2007-02-10 06:51:00,26272,Yep saw that hut zoo on the way home this afternoon. There's always lots of huts out there and I've seen them out there within 50 feet of open water many years. I guess it's all about knowing exactly where it's safe there...with the flow from the Severn locks and the flow out of Matchedash Bay.

33025,irishfield,2007-02-10 18:29:00,26272,I'd imagine the huts at Waub are pike and pickeral. Pickeral most likely considering the currents there. Don't leave the beaten path if you go there...that's for sure.  Others good bets would be Hoggs bay in Victoria Harbour as it would be well packed every day..and Midland Harbour the sled trail goes across from the coal dock headin for Honey Harbour so you could walk out on it as well. We are in a squall again up here today.
