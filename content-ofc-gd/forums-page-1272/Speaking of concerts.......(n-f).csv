He says he rarely leaves the confines of his home, but would make an exception to attend the Black Sabbath show (Heaven and Hell) at the Air Canada Center. Says he's a big Ronnie James Dio Fan.  I say out load to myself, ""Hey, I'll be there too John.""  Got home tonight and these were waiting for me.     If I find anyone in my seat, they'll be asked nicely and politely to move....once! Should the individual(s) choose to ignore my reasonable and rightful request, well........see my new signature."
32563,Castmaster,2007-02-09 03:03:00,86,Saw Ozzy play with Sabbth for the first time in 20 years at The Ozzfest in Detroit. Outdoor show! It was awesome!!!    From what I remember. LOL!
32590,Carp,2007-02-09 04:34:00,1488, Not sure if they're doing any material before Ronnie James Dio joined the band. (Ozzy era) I heard it's mostly Dio era material with a few new songs. Still going to be a great time.
32604,gone_fishin,2007-02-09 07:11:00,481,"i hope the sound at the ACC is better than it usually is...i really hate that venue for concerts, I've seen Aerosmith there twice and Nickelback once...it's just aweful, very echoey, it's not very good! Molson Amphitheatre is much better...but i prefer shows in small venues anyways...never the less i hope it's a good show. Have fun!"
32610,SBCregal,2007-02-09 08:24:00,688,"heheh, I don't think it matters  WHERE you see Nickelback  just kidding.... I believe I read that ozzy was going to do all of Ozzfest for free this yr."

Sharone Osbourne said, ""we have bands committed, but we're hoping that after today's announcement we'll have a whole influx of artists who want to be a part of something this ground breaking. We know there aren't any major headlining acts that would tour all summer for nothing, but we're confident we can turn some of the genre's biggest bands on to what we're doing and have them come out to play a date or two. If they're in town and want the rush of performing in front of 20,000 frenzied kids, they're more than welcome to join us.""

32614,jediangler,2007-02-09 09:17:00,1923,"I saw Black Sabbath at the Aud in Kitchener w/Dio touring for the ""Mob Rules"" album. They did some ""Heaven and Hell"" tunes then. What I remember most was that we booed the opener off the stage after 3 songs. Some band called Wrabit, the album was ""Wrough & Wready"". Brutal, just brutal. Seen the ""Blizzard of Oz"" tour w/Randy Rhoades at the Center in the Square in Kitchener. Ozzy was not at his best that night but getting to see RR play guitar was worth the price of admission. I wish I could have seen the band back in the early years. Have fun, dust off your black leather jacket, and headbang away."
32616,dwc67,2007-02-09 10:29:00,140,ya we got tickets to.  seeing sabbath sober is going to be a first for me
32618,Baldy,2007-02-09 10:41:00,44,"Wow, didn't realize that Black Sabbath were still around.  We saw them with Humble Pie at Beggars Banquet in the Borough of East York Stadium in 1970.  It's all kind of a fog now, was then too I believe. That must make all of these guys well into their 60's.  Must be hard to jump around at that age."
32639,Crazyhook,2007-02-09 12:45:00,1154,Got mine yesterday as well!!!  I love the opening bands as well ( Down and Megadeth)
32681,Headhunter,2007-02-09 14:47:00,5703,"""The world is full of Kings and Queens who blind your eyes and steal your dreams, it's Heaven and Hell!"" Probably my most favorite Black Sabbath album. Neon Knights is a killer tune! Caught the Heaven and Hell tour in Detroit in the early 80's and also saw Ozzy in London, with Randy Rhodes. (Got some fantastic pics of that show as well  ) You will most likely hear ""Long Live Rock n Roll"" at the show as well and if history is any indication of the future, you'll also get some of the classic Black Sabbath tunes. Enjoy the show! HH"
32687,lilkynan,2007-02-09 14:58:00,173,Ozzy - Saw him in Hamilton plce way back with the Blizzard of Oz tour - with Randy Rhoads on guitar - that was a show to remember!!!
