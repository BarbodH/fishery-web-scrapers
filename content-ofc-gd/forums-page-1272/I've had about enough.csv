31779,motv8tr,2007-02-07 02:36:00,2587,"Well it's snowing once again, or should I say still?  It has snowed for the past 6 days here now, and no sign of it letting up  .  We have had over two feet in the past few days, and since I've been at work for the last couple of days I haven't been able to keep up with it out back.   Thankfully I have someone clear my driveway for me     Too bad he can't get the tractore into the yard to make a nice big clearing for the dogs  That's my rant for the evening...good night all"
31787,Greencoachdog,2007-02-07 03:01:00,8163,The Heck you say??? it snowed in Canada?... *whistles*... imagine that!
31854,motv8tr,2007-02-07 10:14:00,2587,"Smart alec   ...my mom and Beans have had a couple of inches in that time, Toronto hasn't even had an inch  sheesh.....I think I'm getting another 6 inches of snow today....  Maureen"
31857,misfish,2007-02-07 11:07:00,29133,"Mo,  once again we just finished plowing the lot here,and in the last 1/2 hour,another 2 inches has fallen. I love the white stuff,just not this much.LOL"

31901,Eddyk,2007-02-07 13:24:00,195,Hey Mo. I hear they need transit drivers in Florida.
31905,Blake,2007-02-07 13:25:00,418,"Sorry Mo but your right in St.Kitts it has just been bitter cold with little snow,"
31918,motv8tr,2007-02-07 13:55:00,2587," Eddy, there are days I think about that...but then Florida has it's own weather issues....at least the snow isn't likely to wipe out my house in less than 10 seconds...I'll stick with what I know....but thanks for the suggestion  , although Arizona might be nice  Maureen"
31924,ehg,2007-02-07 14:14:00,2666,"They say those squalls off Georgian Bay could continue for next 5 days. Maybe you could post snowpile pics eventually?  Have fun digging out,  ehg"
31930,motv8tr,2007-02-07 14:27:00,2587,"Ya I know   I'll try to take pictures of it later today.  I think I'm going to have to get someone in to clear off the roof though  .  I just hope they clean out what they pull off, I can't shovel it from in front of the door or garage.  I cleaned some off the edges this morning, and cleaned out a little by the back door so I can get out there with the dogs.  Barrie is getting it pretty good today, they say there's a band about to go through that will drop 15cm/hr  Maureen"
31958,knotaclue,2007-02-07 15:32:00,136,"Where's Mel so we can ""Call in the army""... sorry motv8tr just kidding, but ya got to love the snow belts in Ontario"
31961,Castmaster,2007-02-07 15:38:00,86,"I'd love to get some snow down here in Windsor! Supposed to plow 43 driveways if we get 2"". WE've had 2""combined all year so far. Hard to make $$$ plowing with no snow."
32003,fishnsled,2007-02-07 16:48:00,3520,"MORE SNOW NEEDED!!!!  I haven't had to use my snow blower for 2 years now!    (sorry, couldn't resist)   Bring some to Oshawa when you come down if you like."
32319,misfish,2007-02-08 12:21:00,29133,"FNS you just come up here and that will cure that illness you have.LOL  These are from just the past 2 days,the last three are just 15 minutes ago.                  We are going to get hammered again today."

32325,blaque,2007-02-08 12:34:00,2419,No such thing as to much snow! Love It!

32473,TAllboy,2007-02-08 21:09:00,4, That's gonna bring up the slush on Simcoe and pretty well kill it for ATV's until it gets packed down.  Heard some clowns tried to take van on the ice yesterday.  Don't let common sense get in the way!
32942,irishfield,2007-02-10 05:54:00,26272,"Yep...we had enough and left on Tuesday Maureen. IT gets tiring living in the butt hole of the world in the winter. Was snowing about 5 inches per hour when we headed out Tuesday am. I flipped a coin under the Waub underpass on #12 to decide which way to go (Parry sound or Orillia) for the trip North. Headed for Parry Sound and drove into beautiful sunshine by Port Severn. Clear sky and sunshine for the next 4 hours North. Was like driving South instead...with less and less snow as we went. There is only 6"" of total snow on the ground in Temagami. Came back today to snowbanks higher than my F150 in the laneway. Thank God the son figured out how to use the plow truck for a change with the 3 feet or so that fell since we left on Tuesday."
