It looks like a Persian used car salesman or maybe Herb Tarlek from WKRP in Cincinatti.    :rofl2: You use these things to chase little green baitfish correct? I would think the bling factor alone would warn the little green suckkas that you were coming from 2 time zones away!!!!!!    :tease: When you're tooling down the lake do you wear the bling bling? Couldn't find a pic of you but I did find this one of your home girl Laquisha-May!!!   Sorry man, I just couldn't help myself."
