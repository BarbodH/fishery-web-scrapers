702640,10point,2012-06-04 12:11:00,165,Suppossed to be leaving late Friday or early Saturday morning to come up to Ontario for a week of fishing with my Son and a friend and his son. My friend just sent me a note saying we needed to talk about the departure date. He says his wedding anniversary is on the 9th and his wife works Thursday night so they can't do anything until Friday night. Like he didn't know this before now! I replied back that I hate to lose a day on a trip we have been planning for 5 months and asked if he could do something before Thursday.

Not sure how you're losing a day if Sat was an option but hopefully it'll work out and you'll be on the blacktop as planned !"
702645,10point,2012-06-04 12:33:00,165, I consider it loosing a day becuase we were talking about leaving Friday night or 2 or 3 in the morning on Sat but now he is talking about leaving Sat evening.
702646,glen,2012-06-04 12:36:00,2641,Cut him loose now while you have the chance.    For real though he and wife can party when he gets back.
702649,woodenboater,2012-06-04 12:42:00,2277,"Yeah, that bites. Still could work out but anniversaries area funny thing. Personally, #9 was not a big deal for my wife and I, 10 was more important. If they don't stay out too late, boogying at 2 or 3 is still possible, unless he has to pack. Maybe it's time for him to lay down a guilt trip..."
702650,fishindevil,2012-06-04 12:43:00,6254,"remember    ""fishing is not a matter of life or death,ITS MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT ""       nothing is more serious than a fishing trip,especially an aniversory !!! hahah..."
702651,johnnyb,2012-06-04 12:43:00,3413,"Maybe his wife can switch shifts at work....she can work the rest of the weekend, since he won't be around"
702656,bushart,2012-06-04 12:47:00,2628,A guy has to take a stand on Anglin  27 years ago---my best friend was gettin married and wanted me to be his best man  His wife to be (not anymore) wanted the last Saturday in April----TROUT OPENER  My point was short---if ya want me for best man-----pick another date---they did  Winter is too long to give up an opener to put on a monkey suit and sweat in a hall
702690,adempsey,2012-06-04 13:59:00,1498,Tell him he can meet you there.
702713,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-04 14:43:00,10439," Exactly!!!! He's a big boy and if he can't stand up for himself he sure as heck can drive his own car, unless his wife says he can't of course!!!!"

702728,bigcreekdad,2012-06-04 15:28:00,546,"  Been there...done that.  I used to take trips with 4-5 other guys every year. Something like you are experiencing, as well as deciding to leave go home earlier than planned, finally caused me to either go alone, or take my son.  I would tell him....""this is when I'm leaving... if you are there, fine, if not, that's fine too.  Fishing trips to Canada are sacred to me.....apparently not to him."
702733,10point,2012-06-04 15:37:00,165,He agreed to do something after we return. Just hope nothing else comes up.
702737,bigcreekdad,2012-06-04 15:50:00,546,  Hope you have a good trip.....where are you headed?
