700335,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-28 03:11:00,535," Georgian Bay is more of a trophy water, isn't it? Not as many numbers (or harder to pinpoint)?     Also, how is the Bay of Quinte for musky fishing? I never hear of anyone fishing musky there which is weird considering most of the waters around here are pretty good in terms of size and numbers."
700338,Dan668,2012-05-28 03:16:00,1120,Ill most likely be on Pigeon on Saturday. Whats your guys plan of attack? Ill probably be casting for them.
700345,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-28 03:26:00,535,"Casting for sure for me, maybe break it up with some trolling later on to stay fresh. I think the first lure I'll be using will be a new walk the dog topwater I'm dying to try out early Sat morning, see if I can at least get a musky to show herself early on."
700347,cl_fishin,2012-05-28 03:37:00,138,"I will miss the opener, but hope to get out shortly after. Good Luck and 50 inchers to all who get out. "
700349,BillM,2012-05-28 03:37:00,17367,"I didn't use my 8ft Compre at all last year, gotta definitely change that this year!"
700434,Squid,2012-05-28 14:28:00,1656,"If the winds are blowing from the South I will be on St Clair, if not then in the K's looking for the big girls."
700436,outllaw,2012-05-28 14:40:00,1232,"we willbe dredging st clair. we dont deal with the 10,000 casts lol."
700452,ehg,2012-05-28 15:32:00,2666,Have always been curious of Quinte musky. Get the feeling they are usually caught accidentally while targeting other species. Maybe some big ones since Lake O/St. Lawrence are close and connected.
700460,Roy,2012-05-28 16:04:00,13728,19 days to go here.
700474,Rich Nelson,2012-05-28 17:13:00,332,"     They are there, and prob some real big ones.... Same as  Georgian bay. Very low density. You can go for days without even as much as a follow."
700480,Gregoire,2012-05-28 17:20:00,1397, I was planning on sleeping on your dock.
700482,mike rousseau,2012-05-28 17:33:00,4661,UH OH...  i just made plans for Mercman to come up for musky opener....  and hes sleeping at my house the night before....  SLUMBER PARTY!!!!!  :devil:  smores and pizza and musky hunter DVDs and sharpening hooks....oh boy  :clapping:
700490,JoshS,2012-05-28 18:13:00,729,"I'm having a tough time deciding on whether to start at midnight or first light. Will be in the kawartha's, first year fishing it out of a real boat for me. Can't wait!!!"
700493,mike rousseau,2012-05-28 18:34:00,4661,  Being out on a body of water that your not really familiar with in the middle of the night probably isn't a great idea...   I would try to launch just before sunrise... Then putter your way to your first spot and get your lines ready.... Have a coffee... Whatever...  That way your lines are in during sunrise...   My .02
700494,mercman,2012-05-28 18:36:00,7054, Hide the wimmins and lock up yer pets!!!!!!!!!!!!Mercman is in the house !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I aint sleepin all week !!!!
700497,JoshS,2012-05-28 18:47:00,729, I've been fishing this lake for years.. The lunar calendar has me thinking night time will be hot this year. Probably just do first light however as it's already a long day from sunrise till sunset this time of year. Probably won't sleep anyway as I never do before openers!
700499,mike rousseau,2012-05-28 18:50:00,4661, Well then... Have at her
700501,lew,2012-05-28 18:53:00,12766," It's been my experience over many years that one of the best times for a musky is in the 1st few minutes after the sun breaks over the horizon and that sudden burst of bright light hits the water.  It's just like a trigger for the fish, but obviously you have to be on a prime spot when it happens.  Same principle as when the sun dips below the horizon in the evening and those 1st few minutes with the sudden change."
700505,JoshS,2012-05-28 19:03:00,729, Love when the sun just peaks and your confidently working your bait over your prime spot. Nothing really beats that.
700525,muskeybugged,2012-05-28 20:32:00,282,giggidy goo!!!!  North end of Pigeon!
700756,Jigger,2012-05-29 13:16:00,1237,Ill be hunting some Haliburton skis come first light Sat. Going to get the file out shortly...
700759,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-29 13:21:00,535,"  I'll be heading there next Sunday, going with my brother who's never fished musky before so hopefully we get into some fish."
702449,fishboy,2012-06-03 17:55:00,550, how did it go...I couldn't swing a trip up
702531,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 00:24:00,535,"So how did everybody make out? I only managed 1 pike since musky opened (caught a small one Friday) but with how tough it was even finding a musky, I'll gladly take it. Plus I beat my previous best pike by an inch (my old PB was my very first, 29.5"" caught last June), caught on a bucktail. Nice to finally get a 30"" pike after catching 2 that were 29.5"" last year. Had another pike just miss a different bucktail on sat, had a hit and a miss on a jerkbait too (didn't see what it was) and a big blow up on a figure 8 Sat night after I pulled my lure out of the water. Stupid me, I thought there was no fish around and never kept the figure 8 going longer than a couple of turns.    This morning I caught 1 small bass who's eyes were bigger than his belly, then the aforementioned pike. Funny, the pike blew up and missed my bucktail 4-5 feet from the boat, I got a good look at him and was hoping he might try to hit again since I never got any hooks in him so I backed up and worked the area again and got him after 10-15 more casts."
700161,mistyriver1,2012-05-27 21:00:00,600,I made this video a few months ago and threw it up but probably better timing now that musky opener is less than a week away (in some places).     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnaJ9US2CDo
700170,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 21:12:00,4661,so where you heading for opener?  i just made plans to hit the rideau river with a buddy for some skinny water skis....  hes a newby so im really hoping we get into a few... hes got a new st.croix legend extreme hes gotta break in....   ...
700173,Musky or Specks,2012-05-27 21:19:00,2710,OMG OMG OMG Can't wait.
700177,lew,2012-05-27 21:21:00,12766,My daughter and I will be fishing Upper Buck and maybe Pigeon too.  Good luck to everyone.
700178,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 21:23:00,4661,another sleepless friday night.....  :wallbash:   lol
700179,Terry,2012-05-27 21:25:00,14456,lets see  went 0 for 0 last year  so this just makes me remember how bad I did  oh well maybe this year...LOL
700194,Gregoire,2012-05-27 21:49:00,1397,"Not sure if I'll make it out for opener, but really excited nonetheless. I should be spending more time on the water this year than I have in a long time."
700198,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 21:56:00,4661,  just gotta put in time on a productive water body and it should happen... just a matter of how much time....  fish of a 1000 casts for most...
700210,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-27 22:23:00,535,"Can't wait! Going to the Trent River on the weekend, then I have the next week off and I'm hoping to go every day that week, maybe bounce between Moira Lake/River and Stoco. Anybody around Belleville wanna try for some musky? lol"
700213,Terry,2012-05-27 22:26:00,14456,then I'm down 20 fish....LOL  balsam and Georgian bay ain't bad spots
700214,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 22:30:00,4661, Ouch...  That's tough....  Maybe your efforts will be rewarded with a big 50+ incher.... And this way you didn't have to deal with all those pesky 40 inchers....lol
700215,lew,2012-05-27 22:31:00,12766," If it takes someone 1000 casts to catch a musky, they need to either change locations or take up bowling."
700217,Terry,2012-05-27 22:32:00,14456,33 boated the year before...so maybe things will turn around this year
700219,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 22:36:00,4661, That's why I said 1000 casts for most...lol  Not me... I'd be bowling if that were the case...lol  How many casts you think a person puts in in a day...? Gotta be 200+ I would think... I dunno... I mostly troll...
700220,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-27 22:37:00,535," I don't want to know how many casts it took me before I caught my first musky, but I must have been way more than 10,000 lol. That's what I get for fishing low numbers lakes like Baptiste and Elephant when starting out. Bowling would have been way easier lol."
700221,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 22:37:00,4661, 33 in one year then 0...  You change your handsoap or something...?...lol
700222,Pigeontroller,2012-05-27 22:40:00,2793,I'll be with 7 very good friends on Pigeon Lake...Very much looking forward to it!
700224,lew,2012-05-27 22:44:00,12766,You still driving the white LUND Dax ??
700231,ehg,2012-05-27 23:05:00,2666,Looking forward to Pigeon Lake for rest of season as well.
700235,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-27 23:10:00,535,  I gotta go to the Kawarthas sometime. What's the typical size in Pigeon?
700245,Pigeontroller,2012-05-27 23:28:00,2793," Yes Sir, last year I was in a friends boat, this year I'll be in mine."
700255,lew,2012-05-27 23:43:00,12766,"OK Dax, maybe see you if I get that far west."
700259,cowanjo,2012-05-27 23:52:00,249,I hope to see Lew and Dax in Pigeon - after going to Kentucky a few weeks ago I cannot sleep. hope fisher greg appears on my dock Saturday morning at 5am. good luck to all.
700280,Rizzo,2012-05-28 00:56:00,4754,"can't get out Saturday, but will be out from Wed to Saturday the next week for my 3rd annual musky trip. Will probably fish anywhere from 3 to 5 different lakes depending on how we are doing. First year caught 6 from 3 lakes, last year was 7 from 4 lakes, here's hoping for 8 this year!"
700298,Handlebarz,2012-05-28 01:30:00,3790,Very nice Jim  I hope we will be out but tge wife's father is not well depending how things go this week jade and I will make our choice.  Good luck to everyone
