701934,mike rousseau,2012-06-01 18:08:00,4661,well my neighbor had to do some serious foundation work...  but in order to get the kubota into his backyard the company had to go across my driveway and grass...and also kinda had to park on my grass so they wouldnt have to park 2 blocks away...   they first asked permission to do so and i did not hesitate to say go ahead... im not fussy about how my lawn looks and my boat was at the mechanic so there was plenty of room...  well after 2-3 weeks of work they are finished...  then a couple minutes ago i get a knock on the door...  its one of the workers and he hands me an envelope... inside is a thank you letter and a gift card for kelsey's for me and the wife to go out for dinner....   i thought that was awesome... the guys could tell i didnt really care about them crossing my yard and they still went out of their way to give us a thank you gift...   2 thumbs way up for  Londondale - Chimney & Foundation Services
