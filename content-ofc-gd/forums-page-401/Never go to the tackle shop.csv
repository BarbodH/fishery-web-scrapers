702222,cynmar,2012-06-02 18:42:00,169,"I was just going to pick up a live target hollow body frog, yep that's all. Lord help me, I couldn't control myself. I left with a SWEET: new Curado 200G6 for pike fishing combined with a Shimano Compre 6'6 med heavy, fast action rod. Couldn't help myself also a new Shimano Compre 6'6 medium, fast action spinning rod for my Pflueger President that didn't balance well on the Ugly Stick. Add to that some assorted yamasenkos, buzz bait, tungsten drop shot weights, swim bait. and I am in crap for a while now. I tried, hon but I couldn't help myself. Think it will work:"
702223,ketchenany,2012-06-02 18:53:00,3229,"Does she tell tou when she buys shoes, make up. . . .  No worries mate, she'll get over it after another pair of shoes!"
702228,Roy,2012-06-02 19:11:00,13728,She should be grateful you didn't invest it in a strip club. You got some decent purchases there.
702231,lew,2012-06-02 19:21:00,12766,"I know the feeling oldbassguy, I went to the Spring Fishing Show a couple years ago to buy a new musky reel and walked away with a Skeeter instead.  My wife still wonders where the reel is"
702232,rmarentette,2012-06-02 19:22:00,124,She should be thankful you didn't invest all that money in Facebook!
702246,bushart,2012-06-02 20:47:00,2628,I'm also gonna buy one of those live Target frogs---they look cool

702258,Toad Hunter,2012-06-02 21:46:00,261,"I've bought a few of the frogs and had some luck, with minimal use- I'm now on to the mice lol - but know how u feel - just renewing my lic. Every year usually costs me a cool 200 in other ""must haves"""
702260,mercman,2012-06-02 21:53:00,7054,"oh do i know the feeling. Man toys are irresistable to me. Coming back from the Rideau today, Mike(Musky Mike) asked if i wanted to stop at PaddleTales. I shouted NO!!!!!! and broke out in a cold sweat that lasted all the way back to Montreal"

702281,davey buoy,2012-06-02 23:15:00,5505,The live target green/black /yellow I have caught quite a few bass.To see them charge up from behind and grab it is about as good as it gets.!!!!! They also hit and miss a lot.

702308,mercman,2012-06-03 01:11:00,7054,"  Its been 3 days since my last visit to Sail,BPS,Gander Mountain, Le Baron, ETackle, or thier websites.

702356,adempsey,2012-06-03 04:42:00,1498,"Lol, I know what you mean.  I think you have it worse than me though.  Although, I am at the point that I feel that I have way too much stuff and end up buying stuff for other people instead."
702357,Toad Hunter,2012-06-03 04:51:00,261,FishLogic --> I could use a new boat just sayin...
702358,Dave Bailey,2012-06-03 05:20:00,1641,"Excuse #1 Hey, I just got a call today from the fishing show I went to, I won a door prize!  Excuse #2 I just went to the tackle shop and they said I was the millionth customer to walk in, so they let me have all this stuff!  Excuse #3 Sheesh, you wouldn't believe the crap people are leaving down by the creek!"
702362,fishindevil,2012-06-03 08:24:00,6254,It happens to all of us fishing addicts !!! Hahah and yes those live target frogs are the best that's all I used last year !!! But many times I go in for one or 2 things and yes 300$ later !!! Lol .. Remember : who ever has the most at the end wins !!! Lol.
702370,brw,2012-06-03 10:48:00,101,"  I've come to believe in a couple inassailable absolutes that are down right genetic in males: the (1) ""it is impossible for me not to leave with SOMETHING when I walk into a tackle store"" gene; and ( 2) the ""make good time on the road"" gene when heading on any vacation.  So don't fight it--not yer fault!!!"
702380,krixxer,2012-06-03 11:54:00,274,I feel the pain.  Last time I went out to get hooks and sinkers figured I'll be good with 20$.  Walked out with a Daiwa T3 and a new Abu Villan.
702381,Rod Caster,2012-06-03 11:55:00,5784," Haha that gave me a good morning laugh, especially after I saw rthe share price and the massive class action lawsuits."
