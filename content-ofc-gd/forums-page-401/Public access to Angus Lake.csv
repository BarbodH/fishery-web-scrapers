702687,lew,2012-06-04 13:55:00,12766,We stayed in a small cottage resort on Angus a few years back and I'm sure they'd let you use the ramp for a day. Can't recall the name of the place but it was right on #11 and just south of a bait shop.
702718,Black_Blade,2012-06-04 14:53:00,258,"Thanks Lew, I am hoping to get up there for a weekend excursion at some point this season, will drop in and ask them.  How was the fishing there, btw?"
702721,lew,2012-06-04 15:07:00,12766,"Most of the fish we got on Angus were small pickeral but the fella that owned the cabins had boats on a bunch of surrounding lakes. There's a path that goes up and over the hill from the west shore of Angus that leads to a whole string of lakes you can boat to and we got some very nice fish there, including a very big pike that my brother got...maybe 18-20 pounds or so.  If he's not booked up...and for a fee...he may even rent you a boat on the other lakes, but I'm just guessing here."
