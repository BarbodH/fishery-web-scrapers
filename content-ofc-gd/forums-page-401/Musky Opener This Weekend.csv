701794,mike rousseau,2012-06-01 11:04:00,4661,Yeah... Cold front last night.....lol
701796,Roy,2012-06-01 11:14:00,13728,"Good luck to all who can get out to a zone that opens on the 1st Sat. in June. It should be an interesting opener given the weather over the past few months. Most importantly, play safe and have a good time."
701799,UglyBug,2012-06-01 11:20:00,148,"  Bass Pro Shops 100MPH is best IMO Paul, won't be cheap but you can't put a price on happiness"
701800,Christopheraaron,2012-06-01 11:27:00,3525,"Sorry, thanks for stopping me"
701802,K_F,2012-06-01 11:33:00,107, Well I know I will be throwing some Handlebarz on the Kawarthas.

701866,BucktownAngler,2012-06-01 15:18:00,582,hoping that the thunderstorms stay away :S

701992,Christopheraaron,2012-06-01 20:14:00,3525,Trout looks like it should be really good this weekend with all this rain.
702007,Live2fish85,2012-06-01 21:02:00,1633, Other then the fact that the rivers will be blown out with all the rain.
702289,Christopheraaron,2012-06-02 23:38:00,3525,"Change of plans, will be hitting the trent around Lindsay or Peterburough for musky and walleye (don't worry checked the regs more closely this time ) will be fishing from a canoe, anyone know if this is a good plan or should I do something else, would like to be east."
701511,BucktownAngler,2012-05-31 14:29:00,582,"Musky opener this weekend  the weather isn't looking too great, looks like it could be windy and possible thunderstorms in zone 17  Where are you guys heading this weekend?"
701518,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-31 14:54:00,535,Trent River. Looks like I'll be bringing my rainsuit.
701537,Pigeontroller,2012-05-31 15:49:00,2793,Pigeon lake. Looking forward to enjoying my Cabelas Guidewear Rainsuit that was 73% off last year!
701539,fishnsled,2012-05-31 15:53:00,3520, I know that I'll be enjoying mine as well (heck of a sweet deal that was!) on Lake Travers.
701540,mercman,2012-05-31 15:54:00,7054,"Rideau, gonna have to get a good rain suit though."
701545,Millhouse2020,2012-05-31 16:07:00,152,I'm gonna have to wait until the 3rd Saturday to hit Nippissing...  Good luck to all you guys though.
701548,BucktownAngler,2012-05-31 16:19:00,582,"  Me too.  I have a lower end Helly Hansen suit that is not insulated, and gets pretty chilly underneath in the rain"
701549,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-31 16:26:00,2690,"  Man, I missed a good deal!!!!!  Possibly Scugog targetting walleye as well as musky."
701592,Brettiop,2012-05-31 18:41:00,279,"Doubt ill be getting out with whats forecasted, was planning on being out on LSC all day...  Bummer!"
701602,Lungelarry,2012-05-31 19:09:00,294,"Rule #1 in muskie fishing...never complain about the weather,its when the bigs girls go."
701605,jedimaster,2012-05-31 19:35:00,3472,"In most of my musky pictures I am wearing a rain suit, or there are clouds in the sky."
701609,Squid,2012-05-31 19:45:00,1656,"Thanks Larry, I did not realize that"
701618,Jigger,2012-05-31 20:17:00,1237,Fish are always wet... Dont know how many people ive said that to this week.
701668,mike rousseau,2012-05-31 21:57:00,4661,I'm pumped that the weather is gunna be wet...  It'll keep the damn pleasure boaters off the water...  Wakeboards Cruisers Speedboats  And hopefully a few less dedicated anglers will stay home...
701677,tightline,2012-05-31 22:25:00,322,I thought this was going to be like asking a Leprechaun where his pot of gold is!!! I've gotta say a little surprised over here..
701679,Christopheraaron,2012-05-31 22:25:00,3525,"Elora trout this weekend, gonna see if I can hit up some skis shore fishing this little inlet on the niagara next weekend. Should be great (first time musky fishing!)"
701682,Handlebarz,2012-05-31 22:31:00,3790,Our plans were for LSC but family things are coming first. Good luck to everyone hitting the lakes this weekend.
701700,Pigeontroller,2012-05-31 23:32:00,2793, You'd best wait a week...The Niagara(both Upper and Lower) does not open for Muskie till the 3rd Saturday in June!  Doesn't anyone read the regs?
701701,Joeytier,2012-05-31 23:34:00,3990,Only calling for scattered clouds and rain on saturday?  You guys are wimps.
701702,mike rousseau,2012-05-31 23:37:00,4661,  10-15mm where im going...  id say thats significant rainfall....  GO GUIDEWEAR   :thumbsup_anim:
701704,Christopheraaron,2012-05-31 23:52:00,3525," Wrong, upstream of the falls it is zone 19, first Saturday. Also next week will be the second week in June not the third."
701706,Walshskie,2012-06-01 00:04:00,58,Your right read the regs from falls to peace bridge 3rd sat in june.  If your going to be a smart a$$ at least be right.
701710,Rich Nelson,2012-06-01 00:10:00,332,  Times 2. Season closed!!!!
701724,Pigeontroller,2012-06-01 00:46:00,2793," Read the exceptions...You're proof that we need to have a test to get your fishing license!  The poster I responded too made reference to fishing NEXT weekend, hence my comment about waiting a week...Hows that shoe taste?"
701767,Live2fish85,2012-06-01 04:04:00,1633, Just quit while your ahead.
