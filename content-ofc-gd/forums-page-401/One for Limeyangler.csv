701655,Christopheraaron,2012-05-31 21:38:00,3525,Best comedy group ever! I have pretty much memorized the whole script of Monty Python and the Holy Grail!
701720,spincast,2012-06-01 00:30:00,3279,"one of their all time classics.   Monthy Python live at the hollywood bowl - and the Secret Policemans Other Ball - 2 of their classics - I believe the above is from the latter, which also has some classic music"

702009,hammercarp,2012-06-01 21:03:00,964,"Not only is it a very funny skit but like all real good humour it has a strong element of truth to it.
