701876,Slayingm,2012-06-01 15:46:00,204,Congrats on your PB and a awesome Walleye! WTG Captpeirre!
701887,tb4me,2012-06-01 16:16:00,3295,Awesome fish! I have a friend that owns a cottage resort on the Trent river..He says the gut bucket in the fish hut has been over half full every morning when he goes out. The walleye have been on fire this season so far..I'm on my way there tonight for the weekend!    The neat thing is he takes the gut bucket to a secret spot and feeds all the turtles.. There will be some fat turtles this year if the eyes keep biting the way they have been.. Anyway sorry to hijack your thread nice fish ya got there..Congrats on the PB!!!

701089,captpierre,2012-05-30 02:47:00,2521,Fished a 10 ft deep weed flat with a perch crankbait at the cottage.  Thought I had a musky on the way it was pulling.  Very happy to see a 26 inch walleye.  Nice and fat.  Big breeder fish.  Had to go back in. Slot size is 30-50cm  Water temp 73.  Water clear
