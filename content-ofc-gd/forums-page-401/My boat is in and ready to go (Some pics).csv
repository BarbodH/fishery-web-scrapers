701615,RangerGuy,2012-05-31 20:13:00,564,Yup max HP 75  Those names are funny!  75 hp is same as 90 hp but what I read ECU has a different part number.. and really what's the performance improvement with 15hp.. I think it would be very minimal. Oh and from my understand it's not in the exhaust it's in the intake which changes fuel/air mixture.. DANGER! with out ECU change
701616,misfish,2012-05-31 20:16:00,29133,Sweet ride.Love the reed cover.
701709,RangerGuy,2012-06-01 00:08:00,564,Anybody know why Lund paints a black square on the transom where the motor is mounted?
701752,hooked!,2012-06-01 02:47:00,38,Nice rig!  Enjoy!
701755,Mike the Pike,2012-06-01 03:01:00,3421," Congrats RG on the new Lund,I have a similar set  up a 2008 Lund 1660 Classic with a 60 Yamaha tiller unlike you my dealer let me position my seat before it was screwed down. The Yamaha runs so smoothly and you will like the rpm control when you want to troll slower.  Now get it slimed and Quaked or ducked lol"
701981,aplumma,2012-06-01 19:35:00,6896, It might be to hide staining from assorted motor liquids or exhaust gas from marking ????  However on your boat I am sure it was to hide the 4 great big holes they drilled wrong and had to patch....    Art
702025,Sinker,2012-06-01 21:36:00,8692,"Congrats on the new ride, RG! Thats a killer rig! I love it!!  IMO, its the perfect ""do all"" boat for guys who fish and hunt out of thier boats!  S."

701480,RangerGuy,2012-05-31 13:08:00,564,"These pics are from my phone, they don't really do her justice.. Now I just need to come up with a good name.

Need to install my new Terrova, batteries, onboard charge and depth finder and find a used Avery Quick Set Blind for the fall"

701510,fishnsled,2012-05-31 14:27:00,3520,     Congrats on the new ride!
701513,RangerGuy,2012-05-31 14:40:00,564,"Yup I'm a duck hunter  I actually think it would be cool to put a 2"" powered jack plate not for speed but for raising the motor up when the water gets shallower. I've read a few message boards that say jack plates void your warranty. I have to look into this.  Turns out they didn't install my extra seat base..it wasn't ordered ARGH! so I will install the base myself when it comes in.  Apperantly, the drivers seat doesn't come installed from the factory for tillers, that's the one they installed.  Would have been nice if they waited for the customer to specify where I liked it but..it's not in a terrible spot so not a real big deal.  Cant' wait to get her broken in..that's my next post LOL!"
701526,lew,2012-05-31 15:20:00,12766,Nice ride RG and good to see you finally got it.

701543,NAW,2012-05-31 16:01:00,4022,"Nice rig for sure.  I've got a camo'd up duck boat too, but it sure aint as fancy as that!  Mine's named the ""swamp donkey""."
701563,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-31 17:05:00,535,"  That's even better than ""The Dirty Oar"".     Sweet boat, lunds look great."
701564,Joey,2012-05-31 17:10:00,9122,"Cool looking boat, congrats."
701573,Steve,2012-05-31 17:31:00,2075,if it is a yamaha 50hp - don't forget to get the marina/dealer to pop out the exhaust governer...  you actually have a fully functioning 60hp on your hands.  have a look at the specs between a 50hp and a 60hp.  identical!
701574,fishindevil,2012-05-31 17:35:00,6254,does that appy to a 2011 50hp four stroke as well ??? didnt know that ???
701580,Steve,2012-05-31 18:01:00,2075,yamaha doesn't want folks to know...  especially when you look at the price difference between a 50hp and a 60hp....  have a look (a VERY close look) at the specs...
701590,Pigeontroller,2012-05-31 18:38:00,2793,Looks like a 75 to me! Which is indentical to the 90...
701593,aplumma,2012-05-31 18:42:00,6896,Nice boat glad you arn't left handed like me....    Art
