701822,Billy Bob,2012-06-01 12:53:00,5865," Pretty much BINGO......but when I took a rod building class years ago the instructor gave us this tip to clean not only the handle but the complete rod.......as you know...if you use minnows the scales get everywhere on the rod....  Take the complete rod, minus the reel into the shower with  you....and for the handle do as BillM said....dish soap and a light scrub pad.....also use the dish soap on the rod blank but DO NOT USE the scrub pad on it...it will take off the shiny finish....  Doing this the rod handle always looks like new afterward and all those little minnow scales come right off the blank too because of how much water it's expose to during your shower.  Bob"
701979,aplumma,2012-06-01 19:31:00,6896,I found hooking a strong line on it and then blasting down the lake at 50 or so gets them scales off too.   Art

702130,hooked!,2012-06-02 04:12:00,38,Great tips folks!  Might be an opportunity to pick up a few brownie points when shopping with your wife - imagine her surprise when you throw some cleaning supplies into the shopping cart!
702209,OhioFisherman,2012-06-02 16:44:00,6623,Softscrub on a damp sponge always worked for me.
701355,jedimaster,2012-05-31 00:25:00,3472,"Ok so I am not sure if this is a recomended way to clean your rod handles, but I had 2 vrods that were so dirty and slick that I almost threw thew out of the boat by accident last year in the rain a few times. I saw a tip to use a mr.clean magic eraser and I thought i would give it a whirl. and WOW they came out brand fricken new.  I am wondering if I need to seal them now, but I'll do some more digging on that. anyway just thought I would pass this on. I wish I took a before picture. So impressed."
701358,bassman87,2012-05-31 00:35:00,586,great tip. thanks
701362,Dan668,2012-05-31 00:56:00,1120,That's what I use. Works great
701363,jedimaster,2012-05-31 01:09:00,3472,"ok I did another one and took some pics...  Here is the Vrod I cleaned...   Here is what it looked like before(the dirty one is a quantum but it was the same as this.    So here is the quantum on its own before...   Quantum after I scrubbed half...   and the clean quantum with the vrod..   and here is a cropped version of both rods so you can see a bit closer...    These photos were taken with a Canon T2i on manual focus, with no flash, and no editing. I resized them all to 1600 pixel's wide. The only edit was the final shot where I cropped it and then resized so you could get a closeup   The process I usesd is as follows..  Wet the cork fully(alot ran off as they were oily and dirty but dampened them as best i could) Then rub them in long strokes from end to end with a dampened magic eraser, about 3 or 4 strokes is all it took, Repeated around the whole thing Rinsed them off in water Then dried with a towel  P.S. water was just cluke warm so I didn't freeze or burn my hands. lol   The magic eraser I used was the white one called Mr.Clean Magic erase extra power. It came in a 2 pack for about 5 bucks at Metro. I imagine they sell this at every grocery store...You know the place wher eyou buy fish when you get skunked...   Anyway I hope some of you find this useful.   Here are a couple more before and after, these wern't as bad...  Shimano Convergence, St.Croix Premier and Quantum Tour   "
701364,mercman,2012-05-31 01:11:00,7054,"What a great idea !!! I leave mine a bit dirty so that it looks like i am a crusty old fisher.Which i am, but thats besides the point"
701365,jedimaster,2012-05-31 01:12:00,3472,"And BTW we all know the age of V-rods so you know that this is an older rod that has seen many fish and many outings. The quantum is a cheapo one so the cork is clearly not as good, but even it came out amazing. P.S. if you wreck yours don't blame me, cause if yours got ruined so did mine. lol do this at your own risk I guess."

701378,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-05-31 02:19:00,1107,I just use the 3M scrub pads from under the sink
701379,BillM,2012-05-31 02:20:00,17367,Dish soap and a scrub pad work great.   It's alot easier to keep them clean if you don't let them get that dirty
701380,jedimaster,2012-05-31 02:27:00,3472,"Bleh...my hands inevitably get dirty when I am fishing, and I am too paranoid to wash my hands while fishing. Plus I am too busy catching fish to worry about my hands... Poke poke jab jab...ha ha"

701494,Millhouse2020,2012-05-31 13:29:00,152,"Great tip, I'm going to try this.  I never used sandpaper to clean my handles before but I did find a useful method with regular dish soap, some baking soda and a toothbrush.  I just made a past of the soap, baking soda and some water and used the toothbrush to scrub it into the handles.  Clean all the surfaces you need to, then rinse with water.  It works with foam handles too.  It cleans and refreshes the cork nicely without removing material like an abrasive sandpaper does.  Its worked well for me but I will try your method since I think it may be just a bit faster.  Thanks for sharing."
