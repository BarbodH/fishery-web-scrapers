700684,Photoz,2012-05-29 03:18:00,792,"Up until about 3 years ago, once the trout left in April, and before the September salmon run, the river was LOADED with carp. Then about 3 years ago the numbers were noticeably fewer, and the last 2 years very scarce? There were few kept and many who tried landing them om light equipment usually got broken off. My cousin (retired) lives a 5 minute walk from the river, and spends a lot of time fishing . . .    in the last 2 months since the rainbow run, he's got 16 carp . . . .  total! No die-offs along the lake . . . .   where could they have disappeared to?"
700728,Christopheraaron,2012-05-29 12:14:00,3525,Could they be hiding around the plant?
700730,Ralph Field,2012-05-29 12:17:00,1018,"Perhaps someone dumped chemicals in the river during the summer, but then you would have expected someone to report on the die off."
700740,Christopheraaron,2012-05-29 12:31:00,3525,"Remember, no die off, chemicals would kill trout and salmon first, carp are very resilient."
702243,bassfighter,2012-06-02 20:26:00,366,"Carp fishing seems to be slower than ever this year .  THEY ARE THERE, JUST WOULD NOT BITE! I have been to few places , saw them but they are ready to spawn right now and lesser quantity compared to last year , water was also lower than normal."
702256,MJL,2012-06-02 21:35:00,2427,"In some spots along the north shore of Lake O, the carp finished spawning well over a month ago and are now back to cruising around the big lake."
702441,Photoz,2012-06-03 17:03:00,792,"Even our pal, Ron up in Peterpatch goes a day or 2 between fish . . . .   now there's a guy who knows his carp, if Ron ain't catching, very few others are!"
702443,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-03 17:20:00,2582,Steve I was so disgusted with my carping last year in Bobcaygeon that I gave up and started going out in my boat for other fish.  And this year I have not even got my stuff organized yet. I have totally lost interest. Don't know what's going on...but it sure has slowed way down up there.
702453,hammercarp,2012-06-03 18:07:00,964,I fished Bronte and 16 in Oakville and blanked at both places. Not a twitch. I put it down to water temps. I came across water temps in Hamilton Harbour at the end of April of 36 degrees F. These were shallow water areas that should have been much warmer. The weather in May did not do much to warm the water. One of the places we fish pre spawn carp usually produces fish in ever increasing numbers for about 6 weeks. This year the carp came in and spawned then left. We had about two weeks instead of 6.
702492,esoxansteel,2012-06-03 21:14:00,1307,"They have been splashin in the shallow weed flats on Rice, but no where near the amount i usually see this time of the year."
702505,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 22:25:00,3525,"I did notice some good sized carp on rice today, and also amazing numbers on simcoe a couple weeks ago."
702507,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-03 22:30:00,535,"Saw tons of them in the Trent today and yesterday, all over the place. Saw some people carp fising too which I don't often see."
