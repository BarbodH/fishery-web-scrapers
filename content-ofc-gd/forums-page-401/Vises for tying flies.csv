702576,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 02:21:00,1633,"Hey all. I am looking for a decent vise for trying flies and such.  I had a cheap one. That came with a kit I got for a gift, well as I said cheap lol, it broke already.  I am not sure what you need to spend to get a good one, I was thinking about spending around $100 dollars.  Any help would be appreciated.  Chris."

Good Luck Chris
702597,SlowPoke,2012-06-04 03:16:00,2984,I had a Danvise and really liked it for its versatility. Great clamping power on the smallest fly hooks all the way up to 5/0 muskie trebles. There are aesthetically nicer vises but it did the job well for the money.
702611,Sawyer,2012-06-04 05:13:00,48,"Live2fish85,  Hands down, dollar for dollar (based on the other rotary vises outthere) I would recommend the Peak rotary vise with the pedestal base.  I think the jaws is the most, if not one of the most important features of the vise - it handles all of my hooks from size 4-22.  Also, the rotary function is simply amazing - you can adjust the rotation of the fly rather than the rotation of hands (works well when tying body material).  I know you have a budget of $100 - but to spend the extra few bucks on a 'forever' vise I think is money well spent.  -Sawyer"
702618,ChrisK,2012-06-04 09:33:00,2772,I have a Apex and a Integra and I like them both. The Apex is a rotary vise which comes in handy sometimes. They both were in that 100 dollar range.
702638,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 12:05:00,1633,Thanks a ton guys. I will have to look at the ones both Chris and.Sawyet mentioned.  Slowpoke I looked at the Davise and from what I see and what I read I like that one.  Thanks Dave as well. Have you ordered from that site?
702644,bigcreekdad,2012-06-04 12:26:00,546," I've been tying on a Barracuda vice for 15+ years. Besides tying for myself, I tie commercially 100- 150 dozen flies per year. The 'Cuda is nothing short of excellent, and the customer service is awesome.  A lot more than $100, but trly a lifetime vice."
702653,dannyboy,2012-06-04 12:44:00,367,"Peak vice is a good value, $150 new for the rotary.  Dan"
702664,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 13:09:00,1633,Thanks a ton guys.  Bigcreekdad that vise looks awesome. Only thing is if I were to get that I would have find another place to live lol. I have a hard time explaining $200 on a rod lol.
702731,bigcreekdad,2012-06-04 15:34:00,546,"  Explain?????  There's your first mistake. Tell her it cost just a tad over $100.  Kinda a white lie, if you get my drift. If you get into fly tying in a big way, you'll end up with a high end vice (Barracuda, Renzetti Master) anyway. Consider it a wise investment.   Also, look on the net for a used one."
702732,bigcreekdad,2012-06-04 15:37:00,546,Just saw a few on Ebay for around $150
702736,rover1.5dx,2012-06-04 15:50:00,23,"Most name brand vises are very capable for tying flies.  Two brands that stand out are Renzetti and Dyna-King.  I own a Ron Abbey Signature of the later.  Well above $100 but tying flies is supposed to be an enjoyable time so why not tie on a beautifully made vise.  For $145 the Renzetti Traveller Rotary is hard to beat.  I highly advise a rotary vise as it can help a lot for many types of flies and tying techniques.  Also in that price category is the Peak Vise which has been mentioned.  A couple of my buddies have them and enjoy them.  If you win the lottery consider a LAW (if you can find one), and/or Renzetti Master. "
702741,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-04 16:05:00,10439,I have a Renzetti Traveller and it is a very good vise. IMHO
702759,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 16:47:00,1633,Thanks guys. Those are some very good points. I just started tying awhile back and I do enjoy it alot.  Maybe my budget will raise and a white lie will be due.  Just like when I spent the $200 on the rod I told the wife that the Curado 301e came with it lol.
702768,SlowPoke,2012-06-04 17:03:00,2984,LOL!!! Nothing white about that lie!
702770,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-04 17:05:00,10439," Nope, that one can be catagorized as a Bold Faced lie!!!    :rofl2:"
702779,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 17:17:00,1633,Lol that may be true. I did get a deal though.  Mind you the difference from a $100 to some of the mentioned vises would be the same difference.
702780,Moosebunk,2012-06-04 17:18:00,3970,"Been a long time since talking with old John here...  http://www.freewebs.com/johnsflymaterials/  ... but he was always a great fella to deal with.  He also had a good selection of vises, start-up kits and all sorts of materials.   Been using a Standard AA vise since 2001.  Withstood the test of about 2000 flies, probably a few hundred bucktail jigs, dressed trebles, big hook projects like muskie bucks... Durable all around vise."
