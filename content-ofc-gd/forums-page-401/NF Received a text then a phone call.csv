This time it was to tell me hes not feeling well, and hes not going anywhere besides to a hospital visit. This obviously threw me by surprise, I figured he was hurt when he called, but NO!!! He has lung cancer!!!! Which blew me away only because he is moderately fit, never smoked, nor drinks!!!!!!! He surely doesnt deserve to go through this carp called cancer,esp lung cancer!!!If it was going to be anyone in the group, it should be ME!"

Positive thoughts go a long way in recovery. Take the time to visit as well. The visits from friends are what kept my buddy going! It really helps!  S."
