702329,pikehunter,2012-06-03 02:31:00,1659,  Good one Dave. I too am proud to say I know you.
702332,Moosebunk,2012-06-03 02:35:00,3970,Great example Dave.  Kudos is right!  Thanks Spiel.
702415,pics,2012-06-03 15:10:00,1268,You and Harvey both deserve kudos!!!
701546,Spiel,2012-05-31 16:08:00,9065,My good buddy Fish Farmer has been selflessly donating his time and boat for many years now to help our mutual friend Harvey from the Golden Horsehoe Club along with the good folks at the Straitline Anglers to take kids out on Lake O fishing.  While he never makes any posts here about it I thought I would.  Kudos to Dave (first picture holding the Coke) and all involved!   
701550,adempsey,2012-05-31 16:27:00,1498,I'll bet they will never forget being on the water and catching those fish!!  Great stuff!

701583,Fish Farmer,2012-05-31 18:17:00,2234,"Thanks Chris and everyone for the kind words, I don't know what to say. It comes a time in life that it's good to give back to people that may not be so fortunate to go fishing and other. I had a father that did all for me. I guess it's a way to say thanks dad. If you know Harvey, he gives all to kids and if I can help him, I'm all in."
