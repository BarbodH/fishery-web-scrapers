701835,Millhouse2020,2012-06-01 13:24:00,152,  I'm confused.  When is the best/optimum time to water???
701842,chessy,2012-06-01 13:59:00,610,water first thing in the morning if that is not possible water in middle of the day.. you want your grass to be dry going into the night... if we have a reall hot spell you can water during the day to keep your turf cool. as most of the damage to your lawn is being done in the middle of the day... 1 inch of water per week ... or more if you can ..
701844,DanD,2012-06-01 14:23:00,2223, You already have your dandelion problem cure and youâ€™re not using it.  Get out there and start picking kids; no supper until all I see is green. LOL  Dan.
701845,Cast-Away,2012-06-01 14:28:00,790,"My lawn looks amazing and I do two simple things starting in April. #1, Fertilize while the grass is still brown and just starting to green up. Use a fertilizer with a high first number. #2 Two weeks later when the grass is starting, over seed with good quality grass seed. Two weeks later over seed again.  The result is a very thick lawn that the weeds have a difficult time penetrating. I still have to pull a few weeds every week before I mow, but not too many. My neighbours all say that I have the nicest lawn around and ask what my secret is. Pretty simple eh?  I only use Scotts products which I purchase at Costco. My lawn is so thick that I have to raise my lawnmower higher until the summer heat kicks in and the growing season slows down."
701849,manitoubass2,2012-06-01 14:47:00,11391," Yeah, I wish. I don't know about your area, but do you see how much homework kids get nowadays??? Plus we got soccer 4 nights per week. If were not doing those were usually out fishing, or cooking. Maybe when school is over I'll get my slave drive on.    I think thats what I'm gonna have to do, just focus on getting the grass thicker and healthier. I had mentioned we share a large lawn with other houses, and their yards have dandelion as well. So if I treat my lawn it's inevitable that I'll get more, unless my lawn is thick enough to withstand the constant barrage.  Thanks again everyone for all the input, very much appreciated! Here I thought I'd get like 2 posts in this thread, lol. Turns out there are alot of weedheads on this board talking bout grass!   "

701864,cynmar,2012-06-01 15:12:00,169,"One of the main controls is not to cut your grass too short. Recommended turf height should be around 2.5"". Establishes long roots in the grass and helps to crowd out as well as curtail weed seed growth. There isn't really much in Ontario that can be used as a spray to rid your lawn. Even the so called ""safe"" iron based herbicide has been shown to harm pets and children if ingested. For our lawns, if it's a minor problem we simply use a weed puller, one that pulls the smallest plug possible. I know pain the the ass but it works. Serious problems are a 2-3 year proposition with proper lawn maintenance ie cutting, fertilizing , aerating etc.  Bill"

702208,Roy,2012-06-02 16:10:00,13728,"I like my lawn to look half decent. It's not easy for some folks who get up at 6am to go to work...they get back home at 6PM, have supper and lawn care is probably the last thing on their mind. Most of the folks in my neighborhood have a contractor do that stuff for them and most of those still have weedy lawns. The ones who don't hire a contractor, for the most part, have terrible looking lawns. If your neighbors don't look after their lawns, you'll have problems with yours. I don't use chemicals on mine... not because I'm a tree hugger but because chemicals are not efficient. What we do now and have done for the last 30 or so years is in the spring, I pick a nice day and J and I have a weed bee. Take a few hours and pull every dandelion or any other weed out of the lawn. I have a weed extractor for the front and one for the back that I keep handy. When either J or I go outside, we have a habit of pulling a weed or two out when we come across one. A couple of weeks into the season, there are none left and they become rare even. A good hint I can give to city dwellers whose lawn butts up against a sidewalk is to keep an inch or so space between the lawn and the concrete walk. The concrete holds the heat of the sun and the lawn burn starts from there. Keeping them apart will keep the lawn cooler.  My front lawn is not very big...took these pics yesterday.        I'll take some of the back lawn when I get a chance."
702213,BillM,2012-06-02 17:16:00,17367,"Roy, do you thatch every year as well?   We've got a lot of sand up here in Barrie, my front lawn is extremely patchy.. Also doesn't help that the city puts about 500lbs of sand/salt on the sidewalk beside my house which makes it's way onto my lawn anything they clear the snow."
702224,Roy,2012-06-02 18:53:00,13728,"Yes Bill, I thatch every year and aerate every 2-3 years. For me, the trick to thatching is not to do it too early. Folks are gung-ho to get outside in the spring and want to get things done and out of the way but with the water content in the soil early in the season, thatching just rips out the good growth. Get it done when it's a little drier..and not too vigourously either. Also, doing anything to your lawn when it's wet makes the soil harder from walking on it. I think the bottom line with lawns is that rather than get a whole lot done at the beginning, do very little but more often. It won't seem like such a chore that way. As for the salt, they spread way too much of it here as well. All I can say is keep good tires on your vehicle and learn to drive.....folks should know how to do that. It's not like they were just parachuted in from Central America.  Edited to add: It's all sand and clay here but for the first 4-5 years, J (Bless her little black heart) would buy me a 10 wheeler of lawn soil and have it dropped in the driveway....this usually always happened around pickerel opening. It got to be a joke around here....neighbours thought I was building a ski hill out back."
702327,pikehunter,2012-06-03 02:23:00,1659,"Sodded the front lawn when we bought this place 6 years ago, ever since I have been able to control the weeds by digging them out. Have one dandelion in a spot alongside the driveway that I cannot kill as the root is under the pavement and by now the root is probably is likely about a foot long!  My backyard has a problem with creeping charlie, I can't get rid of it! Before the herbicide ban I tried the stuff to kill it, didn't work, it flourished and spread like crazy. Tried pulling it out after that with no luck. Last year I tried the ""new friendly version"" of weed b gone and it turned a little dark and then it began to thrive. Tried 3 times to get rid of it and spent over a hundred bucks on that crap! All it is is rusty water, same goes for the path clear and the other kill all stuff, it's just vinegar, turns the weeds dark but doesn't kill the root. Save your money.  If you want to kill everything you can still buy the ""good stuff"" wipeout I think it's called, at Lowes but they keep it under lock and key. Home Depot only carries the so called environment friendly garbage and the only one it's friendly with is the manufacturer and the weeds that love it.  The old formula versions did seem to work, but not on my creeping charlie or yellow clover. They have been proven safe if they were used as instructed.  Just my worthless opinion. And I hate creeping charlie but I have learned to live with it, for now at least."
702333,Moosebunk,2012-06-03 02:40:00,3970,Dandelions suck!  And they seem to get worse every year that you do nothing about them.  Have 3 1/2 acres of lawn to cut here and no sooner finish that they pop up again.  But for those ones growing up in the driveway and walkways..... shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..... Round Up.    It's really for the thistle and ivy though.

Only thing I see on the shelves is the crap with iron in it, or as I call it, ""rusty water."" I will look around though.  My neighbour had a ""weed killer"" pro do his 2 years ago. Spent a whole lot of money to kill charlie and it didn't work. They were using their version of the ""environment friendly"" rusty water treatment.  Just went back to the link to find location where available. Funny thing, it asked for my postal code, not my zip code so I thought that, OK maybe it is available over here. Nope! All locations were on your side of the river. Next trip to your side of Lake Erie's butt hole (the falls) I will look for it.  Thanks."
702389,Billy Bob,2012-06-03 13:27:00,5865,I got it at Home Depot......it runs about $10.....  How do you golf courses and ball diamonds control weeds......

This year we had a huge bloom of dandelion in our yard, and we've never previously had them other then a few. Whats the best way to get rid of them without harming the lawn??? I should mention I have kids and ones just a lil toddler, loves rolling around in the grass. We also have dogs. So I don't want to use a bunch of super chemicals all over causing health issues.  Any thoughts/help are always appreciated"
701641,Ralph Field,2012-05-31 21:11:00,1018,"We have a pesticide ban where I live so we use a product named Weed-be- Gone. It kills weeds and leaves a small dark patch where the weed was. With a toddler rolling in the grass I would as you suggest study all products very carefully. It hasn't bothered our dog yet, but my youngest is 31 and doesn't roll on my lawn anymore."
701644,Millhouse2020,2012-05-31 21:17:00,152,"I know that in Ontario, the over the counter stuff is far more benign than it used to be but if you have serious concerns, I would check with the experts at a garden supply store or something who could give you an informed opinion.   I finally cried uncle this year and called in the pros the other day.  I did so much work on my lawn last year to improve it only to wake up one morning this spring to see a sea of yellow, I almost cried...  I have some neighbours whose weeds are out of control and spreading.  Anyways, I purchased a package from Turf King recently that includes several treatments of fertilizer and weed control, plus soil areation and some other stuff from now till the fall.  It cost $350 in total which seemed like a lot at first to me but when I thought about the bags of fertilizer, seeds and weed control I buy and spread myself otherwise its not that much more to have someone do it for you and use stronger stuff.   I think the more common weed control product now contains iron as the main ingredient that kills weeds without harming your lawn or the environment.  I'm no expert of course but this has been my recent experience.  I think you should call of the pros, Weedman, TurfKing, Nutrilawn and see what they have that meets your needs for safety with your kids and pets.   Hope this helps."
701646,solopaddler,2012-05-31 21:23:00,8605,There is only one answer. Head Stateside and bring a couple jugs of weed killer back.
701652,Billy Bob,2012-05-31 21:32:00,5865,"If you truelly love a good lawn like I do it take some work in the beginning but then it comes easy........  FIRST APPLICATION.......GRABCRASS BLASTER by Scotts.....late March early April...maybe a week or two later in your area but it don't hurt to apply early.....DO NOT SKIP this application....as it takes years to get crabgrass under control.......so don't give up on this part of lawn care.......it will show results 3-4 years down the line....  SECOND APPLICATION.....WEED & FEED by Scotts.......now this isn't like all other applications.......IT MUST BE APPLIED CORRECTLY....Weed & Feed works like this....it must be applied when the grass is wet....best after a good dew (FIRST PART OF THE MORNING...daybreak).....the fertilizer sticks to the the broad weeds (dandelions) and OVER feeds them which kills them....you want to apply when the grass is wet but it should NOT rain for the next 24 hours, but better if it's 48 hours.....if it does rain before then the feed part of the application is still good for growing the grass but it might not be so good to kill the weeds.  THIRD APPLICATION is just fertilizer to thicken the lawn during the harsh dry summer months....  FOURTH APPLICATION is a bit more nitrogen and feed to get your lawn ready for winter.  IF you keep doing this for 3-4 years you WILL HAVE THE BEST LAWN in the neighbourhood .....Mine is MUCH better then all the neighbours that have a commercial lawn care service do it for them...  AND just keep the kids off the lawn for 2-3 days after each application....my boys had no trouble growing up on my lushest lawn...."
701656,rmarentette,2012-05-31 21:41:00,124,"I removed my dandelions with a Weed Hound I bought at Canadian Tire. It's a metal bar with spikes that you put on the dandelion and use your foot to drive it down, give it a twist and it removes them by the roots. I then throw some grass seed down to fill in the patches. The lawn comes in so thick it chokes out the weeds. It's a little bit of work but it's safe for the kids and pets and better for the environment. It took a couple of years but my lawn is virtually weed free."

I think for now, I'm going to use some weed-b-gone once or twice just for cosmetic purposes, and keep the kids off the lawn for a few days. I found one with iron as the ingredient, but I need to look into abit more.  Crappy thing is, we share a yard with like 6 other houses, its sort of an open field in the back, so were kinda damned regardless, cause they still have dandelions.  Overall Im gonna try to improve my grass, I think thats the best long term solution. Get some corn gluten and just keep feeding it, cutting it, and watering it.  My darned obsessive compulsiveness is gonna make this tough on me, lol. I could spend the next year digging them all out by hand and becoming obsessed with my lawn, lol"

701694,Raf,2012-05-31 23:11:00,3495,"BBs suggestions are useless unless you are willing to cross the border for the weed killers.  You wont find those items available for sale here.  Weed-b-gone may work if its not too bad.  Head over to a TSC near you and see if you can find the concentrated formula you dilute yourself.  The stuff in the pre-mix bottles/sprayers is a bit of a waste of money (you're paying for water).  If your neighbours lawns are filled with dandelions, it's a losing battle, the seeds will just blow in the wind right onto your lawn.  To clear a patch for my garden, I got a hold of farm grade Round Up and 2,4-d (you have to know a farmer to get this stuff) this year but this is not a selective herbicide (it kills everything including grass)."

May and June not so much. And I have never spent a dime on killing weeds or fertilizing. I keep my flowerbeds and vegetable garden weeded and let the weeds coexist with my lawn.

701783,Billy Bob,2012-06-01 09:54:00,5865," Actually everything I suggested is just fertilizer......weed and feed simply over feeds broadweeds while feeding the grass because it sticks to the broad leafs when it's applied to a wet lawn....only, maybe, the crabgrass blaster that is applied in early spring might have a weed killer in it....but it works to stop the germination of the already planted  grabgrass seeds from sprouting....that's why it's so important to get it applied early....once crabgrass start to sprout it's too late...they do make a spray that will kill it once it's growing but you can NEVER catch up because more seed is still in the ground that will pop up almost every other day....you would be spraying every 2 or 3 day for the rest of the summer.....crabgrass loves HOT WEATHER.....once late summer/early fall comes it dies off but it has already planted it seeds for next year....always keep using a crabgrass blaster....and it's the first fertilizer for the year.  The dandelions (one of the broad leaf weeds) are really very easy to control using Scotts Weed and Feed...if applied correctly as I have already stated.....it can be applied and should be applied once the weeds have sprouted.....all the yellow dandelions will tell you it's time...putting on before is useless....it has to stick to the broad leafs to kill the plant.  Weed B Gone is a very good product made by Scotts.....it works very well but it really should be used to kill the occasional dandelion that the Weed and Feed missed...it's really not to do the whole lawn with.....also using Weed B Gone does nothing to feed and enrich the grass....a thick grass keeps out weeds naturally......also you should cut your grass so it's about 4"" high AFTER mowing it....and never less then 3"" high...this helps in draught conditions (looks like this year will be one) and again keeps the weeds out......  Here are the products that we can purchase just about anywhere here....including Lowe's, Home Depot, Walmart, Kmart, Value Home Centers and every corner hardware store also carries these Scott products, plus some of their own cheaper versions.  All the other applications is just fertilizer to thicken your lawn....makes a HUGE difference after 2-3 years of following this program....you will not see a difference over night...it takes time...but I guarantee you 100% that you will have best lawn in your neighbourhood if you do follow this program for 3 years.  http://www.scotts.com/smg/learn/annualProgramBuilder/apbstep4.jsp?navId=300031&parentId=19300170&navId=19600030&parentId=19300170&_requestid=2967285&_DARGS=/smg/learn/annualProgramBuilder/grassType2.jsp&_requestid=2967408  So are you guys saying you can't purchase these fertilizers but you can by Weed B Gone that is nothing but a weed killing chemical ....."
