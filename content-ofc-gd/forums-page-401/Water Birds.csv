701781,Roy,2012-06-01 09:49:00,13728,Nice pics but you should have used a gun on the first one.
701801,fishindevil,2012-06-01 11:28:00,6254,roy you said it first !!!!   thats what i was gonna say....theo other shots are great !!!!
701805,Jacob,2012-06-01 11:47:00,186,Wow great shots.
701828,Twocoda,2012-06-01 13:04:00,4130,i agree Roy but from what i was witnessing i think the white ones should be shot too....i sat watching them pull crayfish ( no big deal) but rainbow smolts???...i was unaware that seagulls could do such a thing actually dive underwater and come up with fish...in the photo its a sucker but every now and again they were small bows....it cant rain fast enough or hard enough right now...  Thanks for the compliments guys
701907,hoby5,2012-06-01 17:08:00,42,nice photo's for sure yep 12 gauge would have been a better option to shoot that first one with but camera will do this time i guess
