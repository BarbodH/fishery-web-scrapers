702166,Spiel,2012-06-02 12:55:00,9065,5 more minutes.
702198,Handlebarz,2012-06-02 15:41:00,3790,I guess by now you know they are open they are closed on Sundays
702200,SlowPoke,2012-06-02 15:44:00,2984,It wouldn't have surprised me if they were closed today; they had a ton of water leaks through the roof yesterday. I'm holding out for a flood sale... 80% off all water damaged fishing tackle!!!
702211,Handlebarz,2012-06-02 16:47:00,3790,Lol Brian that would be great LMK when it's on.
702233,Christopheraaron,2012-06-02 19:25:00,3525,It would be pretty sad to see water leaks damaging FISHING tackle
