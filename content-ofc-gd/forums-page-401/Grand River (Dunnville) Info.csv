Plan is to launch in Port Maitland.  I would love to get into some fish for him as we have struck out on perch on the main lake so far... Even sunfish would be great ( but dad wants a walleye).  Any advice/ suggestions appreciated.  Thanks in advance."

701558,dannyboy,2012-05-31 16:48:00,367,"If Lake Erie is up the launch at Port Maitland can be difficult, you can launch at Fishmaster's just outside Dunnville it used to be $5 with parking - they will be able to put you on fish in the river or the lake if it turns out decent.  Dan"
701571,Live2fish85,2012-05-31 17:29:00,1633,Theres an even better launch at the bridge in Dunnville. Fishmasters is good but can be hard if you got a small vehicle or low traction lol.  Also they are getting lots of fish up at the dam.
701645,smally21,2012-05-31 21:21:00,993,"if you aren't fishing the lake launch in dunville at the arena/marina for 10$, try the dam, if not too busy, then troll the river out towards the lake. its a nice boat ride and a very deep part of the grand no real hazards..  if you want to hit the lake its only about 8-10kms from the dam..."
702335,pikehunter,2012-06-03 02:42:00,1659,"There are some good areas to troll below the dam. As said, Fishmaster's ramp is steep but his price is good and he has good worms at a fair price. I like the ramp at the Grand Island BBQ and you can grab a lunch there when you're done. Keep an eye on your depth/fishfinder as the depth can change quickly. One spot close to the bank goes from over 20' to under 2 feet in seconds! Never know what will hit your lure, a 2 foot long sheaphead or 20 pound cat can add some fun and liven up your day.  Have a good day and catch some fish!"
