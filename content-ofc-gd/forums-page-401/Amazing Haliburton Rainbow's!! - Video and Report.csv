After a number of successful trips for Walleye, Jumbo Perch and Crappie it was time to change gears. Since my upcoming weeks are booked with Guided Fishing Trips I was fortunate to hook up with fellow NPS Pro-staffer, great friend and tournament partner Steve Delyea for a couple of fun days chasing Rainbow trout on a couple of my fav. lakes in the Haliburtons. One of the lakes we targeted had slow action due to a major May fly bug hatch.... the flies and lava were all over the surface and fish gorged on them... we made a lake change in the afternoon and bingo!!!!... hit another lake where the hatch had no yet happened and the action was simply amazing. A combination of light line trolling with small crankbaits and gang-trolls with a fly tipped with a small piece of worm was the ticket. We could see on our graph that most of the Rainbows were suspended 10 to 20ft down over 25 to 45 FOW so we focused on those areas with great success. These trout offer not only some of the best acrobatic jumps you will see but also some of the best table fair around!. Check out the MNR offices for a listing of stocked lakes and next time your up in the Haliburton's or Muskoka's give these amazing fish a try!! Good luck and don't forget your bug repellant! .... Greg.  "
701322,Joeytier,2012-05-30 22:10:00,3990,Awesome!  I have fished a couple rainbow lakes in the area in the winter and have yet to dial them in like you clearly have.

That lake wouldn't be on a hydro right a way, running north of Haliburton Lake up to Whitney would it??? our best bow lake was in that vicinity."

701544,Millhouse2020,2012-05-31 16:05:00,152,Great post!  Its making me more anxious to get out for rainbows on Huron....
701958,Slayingm,2012-06-01 18:40:00,204," Hi Dave, lol!!!!..... no was not that lake but know the one you mean... have fished it lots over the years and taken some limits from there also.... and another good lake approx a 10km ATV ride N. from there on the powerline trail have done well on that one also. I have a log cabin on 25acres on Harburn Rd 10min N. of Haliburton village and get up there and into the back lakes as much as possible!"
701993,dave524,2012-06-01 20:16:00,4508," Of course you know that if the Bows aren't cooperating on the lake I mentioned, you can put in at a marker about mid point on the south shore and portage a few hundred yards to another lake where the Spec fishing is pretty good."
