702503,NAW,2012-06-03 22:20:00,4022,  $80.??  Where are you shopping for rod holders?  Tiffany's  You can get a combo pack with two rod holders for about $20 on sale.  I actually thought you where joking around in this post.
702506,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 22:26:00,3525,bass pro and sail (hadn't done much looking really)
702523,bare foot wader,2012-06-03 23:47:00,1354,"using 2 c-clamps take a 6"" piece of 2x4 and clamp it the gunnel of your canoe...you can then mount virtually any rod holder...that's how i mounted scotty's to my canoe...use a piece of plywood on the non 2x4 side of the clamps to help distribute the pressure, avoid damaging the canoe and to prevent the clamps from slipping  and yes, i've hooked into musky's this way, so it'll hold up just fine"
702525,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 23:58:00,3525,"Thanks barefoot, that does sound like a fairly good plan. Now could you give me some advice on landing a musky in a canoe!"
702532,bare foot wader,2012-06-04 00:25:00,1354,  make sure you have a net lol
702534,Rich Nelson,2012-06-04 00:27:00,332," U have never caught a Musky have you....my advise would be to go with someone who knows what they are doing. (to a body of water that is actually open for Musky). Have proper release tools... Hook cutters. Musky net, or cradle etc.  heavy rod, reel and line. Its a huge learning curve to catch a Musky anyway, and not recommended in a canoe."
702536,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 00:31:00,535,"  Musky Mike recomended those to me, I picked one up and they are great! Well worth the price."
702537,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 00:34:00,535,  
702538,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 00:37:00,3525,"Yikes, but I always have a net"
702544,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 00:58:00,1633," When it comes to musky, having a net and having the proper net are two different things."
702545,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 01:03:00,3525,That is definitely true and I really should invest in a cradle.
702547,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 01:05:00,1633,If your fishing in a canoe a cradle would be the last thing you want.
702549,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 01:07:00,535,"  Do you fish by yourself or always with a partner? A cradle isn't very good fishing alone, even more difficult in a canoe. A net would be better for a canoe."
702550,Handlebarz,2012-06-04 01:08:00,3790,Get the proper net before a cradle get some good bolt cutters jaw spreaders long nose pliers. Then go to the $ store and get some coiled phone cord and attach it to your release tools this way you will nor loose them.
702553,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 01:11:00,3525,"OK, it's always 2 right now but a net probably would be easier."
702555,Live2fish85,2012-06-04 01:22:00,1633,"Until you fish them in a boat, an your comfortble with them.I would stick to bass and that.  Not trying to be rude but they aren't like fishing for bass. You don't want them thrashing around in the canoe and leaning over to unhook them in the net isn't a smart idea.  If they are laying the the canoe there is a good chance that you will get a hook or teeth in your legs or anywhere."
702560,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 01:29:00,3525,"That's what I was worried about, I had planned to take it straight out, take the picture then unhook it and revitalize it in the water. I'll take a break from muskie until I can rent a boat next."
702337,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 02:46:00,3525,"Kind of a pointless topic, just thought that I would show off my ""handyman skills."" Got caught off guard when plans for tomorrow changed from trout to muskie, had a few lures that I knew would work but when fishing from a canoe I knew from experience that it's not easy trolling from a canoe, so 5 minutes later and some duct tape and this is what happens, it's actually fairly sturdy.  Now to choose between south sturgeon and the trent in peterburough. "
702339,mercman,2012-06-03 02:54:00,7054,"nice try, but it looks a little flimsy"
702340,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 02:56:00,3525,"Only needs to hold the rod until a fish bites  and trust me the clamp handle adds a lot of backbone, but I'll have more duct tape on hand, learned that from solo."
702342,Live2fish85,2012-06-03 03:01:00,1633,Good luck with that. A bass will rip that thing off let alone a musky.
702344,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 03:20:00,3525,"Just curious, what did your post say at first?"
702345,mercman,2012-06-03 03:22:00,7054," Make sure you use a rod that you dont mind loosing The idea is fine, the material not so much"
702346,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 03:26:00,3525,"You just gave me an idea about the rod coming out, thanks!"
702347,woodenboater,2012-06-03 03:28:00,2277,"yep, clamp and tube are gonna pivot in the direction of fish and rod will say bye bye. ymmv. esp on the chance you hook a musky  still better to be on the water than not"
702350,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 03:43:00,3525,"My idea was to have a bungee wrapped (and duct taped of coarse) to the clamp then hooked to my bail, it might give me just enough time to save my rod."
702352,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 03:56:00,3525,I could probably loop the bungee over the area between the reel and rod?
702354,Sinker,2012-06-03 04:10:00,8692, :w00t:
702355,adolson,2012-06-03 04:27:00,783,"It's probably cheaper for you to just buy one than waste a roll of duct tape on your Red Green Rod Holder. It's like $4 for a proper, metal rod holder at my local flea market and it works rather well in my canoe."
702365,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 09:03:00,3525,I didn't really want to get one because the only ones I've ever seen are $80. But I guess it's either that or hand trolling which you can't do in a canoe.
702366,fishindevil,2012-06-03 09:19:00,6254,Go get an old salty down east rod holder !!! Alot of salmon and Muskie guys use them they are bullet proof and last forever all steel to and fully adjustable !!! They make 2 styles !!!! About $40 each !!!!! Google it and see they are quick release to by just lifting your rod up and out !!! That one you made will explode when you are going northbound and a 42inch Muskie is going southbound !!!! And you will lose it all !!!!!
702367,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 09:29:00,3525,"Thanks fishn devil, maybe I'll just try for some walleye today."
702374,Rizzo,2012-06-03 11:40:00,4754,"for a second I thought that was just for rod storage while you were not fishing, and thought that was a bad idea. Then I realized it was for trolling - really bad idea. As many have said, a musky would make that go bye bye. It would never come to that, just the pull from trolling a musky lure would make that go bye bye"
702377,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 11:44:00,3525,"I've already realized that but thanks for reminding me, like I said 5 minutes and duct tape, that's where all bad ideas come from, right?"
702378,krixxer,2012-06-03 11:48:00,274,$15 get you a real nice ABS cannon rod holder at LeBarons

702384,Rod Caster,2012-06-03 12:25:00,5784,I'm getting one for my canoe delivered from wholesale sports. Around 12 bones. I'll let you know how it works.
702386,Handlebarz,2012-06-03 12:47:00,3790,Wolf beat me to it as the down east rod holders are on sale through Phil st etackle.ca he also has some great deals on musky tackle
702396,woodenboater,2012-06-03 14:10:00,2277,"regardless of the holder, I think if you did hook a musky, you'd probably be taken on a scenic cruise of the Trent with said musky pulling your canoe which ever way it so chose"
702397,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 14:12:00,3525,"Well it looks like it'll be wallys today, just entered port hope and on my way up 28"
702399,Toad Hunter,2012-06-03 14:19:00,261,surely your rod cost more than this - http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Fishing/Downriggers/PRDOVR~0784367P/Powerlock+Rod+Holder+for+Downriggers.jsp?locale=en
702484,Christopheraaron,2012-06-03 20:45:00,3525,Thanks toad hunter but it can't lock to the canoe.
