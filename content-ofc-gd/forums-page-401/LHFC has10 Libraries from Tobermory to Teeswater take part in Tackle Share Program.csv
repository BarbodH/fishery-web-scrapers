We have 10 Libraries on board they are Pt Elgin, Southampton, Kincardine, Sauble Beach, Tobermory, Wiarton, Teeswater, Paisley, Cargill, & Ripley. With a possibility of having 3 more next year, right now Mildmay is confirmed. The way this works is, anyone with a Library card can go and sign out a rod and reel and tackle just like they would for a book. The number of times the fishing equipment borrowed in 2011 was 176 poles, the previous year was 88. I am pleased to say that OFAH Zone H is helping to support this program, and to help get our Kids out Fishing and enjoy the out doors. Thanx to Harold Cowan Tackle Share Co-ordinator Tight Lines SBK"

702249,misfish,2012-06-02 20:58:00,29133,"Dave,why more public areas for fishing like that are not made,I have no idea.  Thats awesome what you have there."
702276,Twocoda,2012-06-02 22:42:00,4130,"I agree B... our area is PRO fishing largely to do with the Lake Huron Fishing Club, Ontario Steelheaders and the support of the community...These positive activities ripple ten fold through out the community by keeping young kids minds occupied and educated Richard  has taken it a step further by introducing interest and education right into our classrooms with his micro hatcheries. All along the Huron Coast the response seems to be nothing but positive.Personally i think EVERY coastal community in Ontario could learn alot from this area. Embrace and respect the resource and nothing bad can become of that."
702287,spincast,2012-06-02 23:36:00,3279,"Thats a great program Richard. Two thumbs up to you and the others involved.  I think maybe we should send the councillors from Cobourg up to Port Elgin, - what a great idea Dave."
