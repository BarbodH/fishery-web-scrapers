'What do you think you're doing?' asks the wife  'They're on sale, only $10.00 for 24 cans', he says  'Put them back. We can't afford it,' says the wife and they carry on shopping...  A few aisles later the woman picks up a $20.00 jar of face cream and sticks it into the cart.  'What do you think you're doing?' asks the man, 'It's my face cream. It makes me look beautiful,' she says. The man replies... 'SO DOES 24 CANS OF BEER AND IT'S HALF THE DAM PRICE'"
