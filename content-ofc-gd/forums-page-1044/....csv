192190,ccmtcanada,2008-04-25 12:23:00,7971,"LOL Glen....great report!  Glad to hear the repairs were done properly.  Ahhh...the wall is back in your pics...something just wasn't quite right in your shore reports.  We're hoping to take the boat out this weekend with our little one (not looking great at this point), and have her use those sabiki rigs you gave us at Quinte.  Saturday is looking bad...rain/thundershowers and winds up to 50km/h....and Sunday morning plans may put a damper on fishing.  At the least we'll take her to a local pond.  Do they warn you when the dams are going to open?  Is there a strict schedule they follow?  Thanks for the pics and report....nice to see you out there again....hope the temps cool down there soon...so you can put yer shirt back on....."

Duck wasn't hard to find but it took me a couple of looks before I saw the rabbit in the brush on the left side.  At least you got to fish! Here I am behind the keyboard at work and hoping to get out sunday morning.
