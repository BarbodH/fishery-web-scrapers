I suspect they are trying to hold it back to take some of the pressure off of the the people down stream, an inconvenience for me but a small price to pay to save someone elses home.  Anyway, if I can I would like to shoot for a week this Sunday, same time. Would those who had offered to help please confirm that you have seen this, if I haven't heard from all of you by tomorrow evening, I will try to contact you by other means.  Thanks again!  Big Cliff"
