192692,Fang,2008-04-26 15:20:00,1330,"Water was super clear and fish were very tight to cover. Worms, roe and 2 fish on a #10 stonefly pattern. All fish were spawned out and many heading back downriver through the morning.  Bite was on till about 9 am then it went very quiet.  This one was very long and had a big chunk out of the side. Around 28"" maybe all of 5 lbs though   nice color   this was a battler, many jumps and took me through 2 log jams,   Well I don't think there'll be anything left in the river for next weekend so I'm going salmon or crappie fishing"

192734,johnnyb,2008-04-26 16:54:00,3413,those 'r some beauties!  I knew I should've got some time in before work this morning!
192749,misfish,2008-04-26 17:26:00,29133,Nice report Paul. Thought you would be a turkey kinda guy this time of year.
192765,Fang,2008-04-26 18:11:00,1330,MF  For sure something I'd really like to try. Got the mouth calls which drive the wife nuts.  Just never have been able to make the committment on scouting to find a spot and birds. My brother just bought 9 acres north of hamilton and has seen a bunch of Jakes - must be some toms around too.  Maybe 1 of these years - it's hard to break tradition for me same spot 22 years running now!
192917,Master of Bait,2008-04-27 03:03:00,196,Awesome fish.  Great report.
