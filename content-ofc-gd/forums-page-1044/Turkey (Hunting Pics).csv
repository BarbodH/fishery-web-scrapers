192563,huntervasili,2008-04-26 03:03:00,1604,"2 3/4"" Mag #4 Shot, one and a half ounces of shot... owww... I spent a lot of time scouting and I had their patterns down, plus I got communication skills  had em gobble back a few times. The season is a cakewalk now! If anyone wants a hunting partner within a reasonable drive of here (burlington) I am game, well not to shoot but to be a partner... I told my landowner one turkey and will see what he says to another... Good luck to all!"

192180,huntervasili,2008-04-25 12:05:00,1604,"Well I got a nice ol tom about 710 this morning... Locator didn't get them talking so I was dissapointed but I had faith in the spot where I was so remained. at about 640 I heard the first gobble in response to my clucking and sure enough after 5 minutes a turkey comes out. A hen mind you but that meant a Tom would be in behind, and I was right. While the hen was feeding within 30 yards the Tom decided to put on a show for my decoys, about 55 yards out, thats 20 yards or so out of my range. sure enough some soft clucking brought him in, inch by inch quite literally. The bugger was strutting so close but so far away. Finally he got in within range and he made a mistake, he stuck out that big 'ol ugly head and got clobbered. Here is my trophy!  "
192181,ccmtcanada,2008-04-25 12:07:00,7971,Does it count when they wander in your back yard like that?  LOL.  Great stuff Bill!!!

192224,huntervasili,2008-04-25 13:32:00,1604,"The measurements are: 10"" Beard and 3/4"" spurs. Gotta go get me another tag now! Anyone know of a decent taxidermist in the area? I know of a few but want some input."

192231,misfish,2008-04-25 13:42:00,29133,Thats a real nice bird Bill. Saddly my morning was filled with disappointment with having to argue with two guys that tresspassed and shot a huge Tom 100 yards from me.  I wont go into it as this is your thread and congrats.
192252,huntervasili,2008-04-25 14:35:00,1604,"That was you I was arguing with? nah, sorry to hear Brian. Still have a month to go though."
192259,walleyejigger,2008-04-25 14:53:00,876,"congrats, nice bird,  just curious what gets mounted on  a turkey?  the whole bird? the spurs and beard? also how many tags are u allowed?"
192262,Greencoachdog,2008-04-25 14:57:00,8163,"Congrats Bill... now you gotta clean the nasty thing!... and if you skin it out for taxidermy, it'll be tough to cook a decent meal with it.   .... so remember to number the feathers!"
192286,douG,2008-04-25 15:58:00,2693,"Nice shootin there, Mr. Parker.  Good for you.  Funny right there, Glen - number the feathers."
192300,huntervasili,2008-04-25 16:27:00,1604,"I don't know yet which way I will mount it... but the options I am looking at are: Full mount, Tail mount, tail and back mount regardless I would have the beard and tail mounted at the least. Its Quick, Cheap and the bird doesn't have to be skinned."
192301,Bernie,2008-04-25 16:33:00,3190,Well Bill.....I have this here big pot for deep frying them things. Great stuff Bill!!!! Nice bird!
