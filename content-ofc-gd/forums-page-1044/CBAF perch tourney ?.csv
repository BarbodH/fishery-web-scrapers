It will be on: Saturday, April 26th, 2008 Sibbald Point Provincial Park (Back up is Virginia Beach if ice doesn't clear) 8:00 am - 4:00 pm Team Event $80 entry - 90% payback $10 big fish - 100% payback Fish Fry to follow at the covered picnic area 15 fish limit (all females weighed in to be released) other well can be used to keep eaters  If there are any boaters and nons looking for partners please post here and hopefully all can be accommodated.  Please post if you are attending this event with your partners name on this thread.  This is by far the best fishing for numbers and size. Look for 20 pounds to win it this year if the warm weather continues.  Looking forward to it already!!!"

New members are always welcome in our Federation and can fish the Scugog crappie or Walleye events if you join now.  Information on all of our events are on our board.  BTW, we will be tagging and releasing 300 perch for the MNR at this event which will be held at Sibbald Pt. Provincial Park and if you'd like to come watch the weigh-in and/or tagging, it begins at 4 PM.  Charles"
