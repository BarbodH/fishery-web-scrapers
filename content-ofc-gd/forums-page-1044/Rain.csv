192701,fishboy,2008-04-26 15:51:00,550,my dad's wise advice was to run between the drops so as not to get wet...
192703,ccmtcanada,2008-04-26 15:52:00,7971,"Get good rain gear to keep yourself dry.  I've had luck in the rain....the fish don't care, they are already wet....  As rain/storms approach, it seems to turn the fish on at times.  Seriously though...a good rain coat and rain pants will make the time out there more bearable.  If you are uncomfortable, you'll tend to not do the finesse things that you'd normally do in good weather.  Hope this helped."
192731,Hotrod2066,2008-04-26 16:44:00,40,I love fishing in the rain as long as it isn't a downpour. The low light conditions make the fish less wary and it's a great time to throw the buzzer. Just don't stay out if the lightning comes around.

192865,huntervasili,2008-04-27 00:37:00,1604,"Why'd ya want to do that? holding a 14' graphite float rod in a river during a thunderstorm is a great idea... make sure its a cork hadle and it will be ok... NOT. I have had some good luck before the storms, the pressure change seems to turn on the fish, and they can stay on throughout a storm"
192867,livinisfishin,2008-04-27 00:40:00,661,Nice Double insulated rods workwell in that kind of situation Bill!
192870,Victor,2008-04-27 00:47:00,1609,double insulated rods?
192878,livinisfishin,2008-04-27 01:16:00,661,"yes victor double insulated rods..actually there isnt such a thing but it would be great if there was, less lightning strikes.....anybody know of anybody who has been electrocuted through a fishing rod, never heard of it so far..im sure it probably has happened"
