192562,mpitcher,2008-04-26 02:57:00,2,Hello all:  newbie here.  does anyone have a link to good satellite imaging to monitor ice (updated daily)?  Is there still a lot of ice up temagami way?
192566,irishfield,2008-04-26 03:15:00,26272,There's still about 10 to 12 inches of ice on most of Lake Temagami. A few brave soles are still sledding it throttle to the bar! North West Arm is starting to open up...with about 1/2 of it open water now. Boating should start late next week.  http://www.ottertooth.com/Temagami/News/08/sat08-05.htm
