Right now we are having winds of 45kmph its a wind chill of -17 and we got 10 inches of fresh snow.  I had fun coming home this morning from night shift on a highway with an ice base, and moguls on the travelled portion of the road. I was luck, my lane had been plowed the northbound lane still had 6 inches of snow on it.  All the highways in the area are closed due to the weather, Highway 17 is closed from Ignace to the Manitoba border and the highway north to Red Lake is closed too.  Enjoy your sping guys and PRAY FOR US; maybe it will help bring in the spirng."
192799,kickingfrog,2008-04-26 20:26:00,8333,I feel for you. On the bright side... no bugs... for now. Good thing you're not travelling in it. Throw a log on the fire and put the kettle on.
