192304,Maverick,2008-04-25 16:38:00,371,"Hey guys, I'm going to visit the girlfriends parents next week in Collingwood / Wasaga Beach area and I am dying to do some fishing. The thing is that I have no idea where to fish in that area and I won't have my boat so it will have to be done off shore. I did some research and I could fish in zone 16 or zone 14 (Georgian Bay). Looks like all that is off limits is walleye, bass and pike in zone 16 and just bass in Georgian Bay. Does anybody know where I can catch something, anything, off shore that isn't too far away from that area? I don't really care what it is, I just want to fish   ."

192405,Maverick,2008-04-25 19:30:00,371,"Sweet, I've never fished for steelhead or carp. What do you use for these? I heard corn for carp but how do you rig it?"
192482,Musky or Specks,2008-04-25 23:00:00,2710,"To bad you didnt have a little boat or canoe if the wind is co-operative Ive always had great luck fishing the Mary Ward Shoals just off of North Winds beach in Collingwood at this time of the year. Mixed bag of salmonids,bows,salmon, atlantic salmon, and splake/lakers."

192539,Maverick,2008-04-26 01:18:00,371,"Might try for carp. What do you use for carp and what depth do they hang out in? Should I be looking for rock, mud or sand?"
192551,Musky or Specks,2008-04-26 02:27:00,2710,I know from my days doing work for the RAP program that Collingwood harbour is full of carp try off the mouth of Black Ash Creek
192574,GbayGiant,2008-04-26 04:04:00,1780,"Shallow, try behind McDonald's in town, I use to just use 4 or 5 worms on a large single hook and let it sit on bottom for carp other than that it's a salmon/trout area, go anywhere along the georgian bay shore line near rivers/tribs and cast out a egg sinker as far as you can with a floating roe bag 4-5 inches off bottom and wait."
