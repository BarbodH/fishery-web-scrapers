192294,OhioFisherman,2008-04-25 16:09:00,6623,"Caught a program on MythBusters last night, no good way to hit a moose with the average car( they used a dummy Moose and a remote controlled car). Slowing down had a better effect than speeding up and trying to send the Moose over the top of the car.  Best bet? Keep your Mooses off the street."
192295,BillM,2008-04-25 16:12:00,17367,Mooses?

192565,Dondorfish,2008-04-26 03:14:00,1000,Don't know about a moose - never hit one - but I know first hand how much damage a cow can do!  A little over $12000 in damages - and I spilt my coffee!   Don  
192584,danc,2008-04-26 05:26:00,4677,"Moose are getting scarce up here. I haven't seen one in over a week now. Global warming, parasites and the increasing Deer population are driving them out. Sad to see."
