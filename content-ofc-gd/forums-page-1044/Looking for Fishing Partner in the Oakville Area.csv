I am looking for someone with experience fishing in the area to partner up with and learn from - I love to fish all kinds, and am also looking to get out this year on the lake and just around (1/2 radius or so) the Oakville and surrounding area.  If anyone is willing to share knowledge and a morning or two with a newbie, please drop me an email and we can arrange a good time to meet on the river.  I am out there this weekend experience or no - just would prefer it to be a more fruitful experience than my trouting on the mouths thus far this season!  Cheers Mike  [emailÂ protected]"
