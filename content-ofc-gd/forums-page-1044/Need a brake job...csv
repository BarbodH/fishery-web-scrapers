190363,Gerritt,2008-04-21 16:59:00,6129,"Thanks for the advice Paul.. I wont cheap out on the parts, infact I will probably by the best I can.  Thanks for the heads up on the white boxes though.   Any manufacturers I should consider purchasing? I was thinking Raybestos were probably the ones I would be looking at no?  G"
190370,Tybo,2008-04-21 17:07:00,1373,"Raybesto is very good brake,Just put a set on Joey's van.  I use ceramics on the truck.Great stopping but very hard on the disc's Ceramics are costly though.  At work we only use Ray's. It a different style braking system, but we are also trying to stop 300.000 lbs."
190376,Tybo,2008-04-21 17:11:00,1373,"Monroe's are very good too.  If you want to go cheap, Jaspers will get the job done."
190470,cork soaker,2008-04-21 20:38:00,23,"jaspers have a reputation for squealing like a stuck pig for a couple weeks though! be warned.  I won't put em on again, they where a fine pad, and lasted quite well considering the price, but it was lesson learned with the squealing i buy the primo stuff now."
192854,Gerritt,2008-04-27 00:12:00,6129,"Well I did the brakes and did not wind up with any extra parts!    It was pretty straight forward, I had a neighbour help me as he had the proper greases etc  it got interesting though.....  I removed the rotor only to have the emergency shoes fall apart in my hands..... Great.....  Off to the parts shop for new shoes and the hardware kit...  tested the E-Brakes.. one side works properly... on the drivers side the cable is seized... ARGH... I manually released the shoes... and will be leaving the cable be till next week, I just wont use the E-Brake... I never do anyways unless on a ramp... So I will replace the cable on both sides just to be safe..  So it looks like the E-Brakes were in contact with the rotor the last time I used it... and therefor the reason they fell apart... and possibly warped my rotors due to the heat generated..  I still have a slight pulsating when braking so it looks as though the front will require attention as well in the near future.... but fixing the rears certainly resolved 95% of the pulsating..  I would like to thank everyone for their advice and PM's  I wound up with top of the line Raybestos pads... cost $68.00 and the rotors cost 35.00, New Raybestos e-brake shoes were 60.00 and the hardware kit was 25.00.. Learning to do a brake job... Priceless!  I learned alot today working on the truck... now to get that E-Cable fixed..  G"
192936,maybe,2008-04-27 05:07:00,307,Way to go!!  Glad to hear you made it through without the extra pieces.
190201,maybe,2008-04-21 08:12:00,307," You remove your customers' emergency brakes on a daily basis?  Have I missed something?  From the Highway Traffic Act, specifically Part VI section 64 - Brakes.  Brakes, two systems required 64.  (1)  Every motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, when driven on a highway shall be equipped with at least two braking systems, each with a separate means of application and effective on at least two wheels, one of which shall be adequate to stop the vehicle as required by regulations made by the Ministry and the other of which shall be adequate to hold the vehicle stationary. R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 64 (1).  Condition of brakes (7)  All such brakes and braking systems shall be maintained in good working order and shall conform to the regulations made under this section. R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 64 (7).  Penalty (9)  Every person who contravenes subsection (1), (5) or (7) or a regulation made under subsection (6) is guilty of an offence and, if the offence was committed by means of a commercial motor vehicle within the meaning of subsection 16 (1) or any trailer within the meaning of subsection (5) that is drawn by a commercial motor vehicle within the meaning of subsection 16 (1), on conviction is liable to a fine of not less than $400 and not more than $20,000. 1996, c. 20, s. 14."
190277,Maverick,2008-04-21 13:40:00,371,"I just bought front rotors for my chev. CT was charging me $120 per rotor, Napa even more. I looked around and found this site http://www.autopartsonlinecanada.com/ and found them for $42 a piece with free shipping on orders over $75. If you order them there call in the order because when I called to make sure I was getting the right part for my truck they said that the online orders go into a cue whereas the phone orders get processed immediately. You shouldn't need to take it to a specialist because they just charge you ridiculous $$ for doing something most people can do. If you know anybody that plays with vehicles for fun, offer them a case of beer and they'll most likely help you out."
190301,cork soaker,2008-04-21 14:46:00,23,"at least one of your neighbours will know how to do a break job, ask for assistance.  it is one of the simplest and most straightforward jobs you can do on your own vehicle.  the ones claiming concern on here are just mystified because they believe its a safety issue, and thats fine, but anyone who is even a little bit handy can do a rotor/pad job, with limited effort!  by all means purchase a manual if it makes things easier, but for the most part its a straightforward job!"
190339,bbog,2008-04-21 16:14:00,665,"Hey Gerrit, brakes are pretty straight forward but there are a few details to be aware of (as others have said). Have a look at this link then decide for yourself.  http://www.fordf150.net/howto/brakerepair.php  Seems a little drastic that some are suggesting this is life and death. Are you really going screw up all 4 corners?"
190341,Gerritt,2008-04-21 16:20:00,6129,"Hi guys thanks for all your input on this.. I am a fairly handy guy and am not afraid to getting my hands dirty..  It is something I wanted to do myself just for the simple fact of doing it.. it is not a money issue, more of a I wanna do it issue, if that makes any sense.  I do have some neighbors I could call on... great advice thanks!  Time to start calling around for prices..  Thanks again guys!!  G"
190342,Gerritt,2008-04-21 16:22:00,6129,Maverick.. Thanks for the link   but it appears the rotors are not in stock..   My Truck is a 2002 F150 XLT 2WD Supercab   Thanks for your effort though!  G
190358,Tybo,2008-04-21 16:52:00,1373,"GERRITT!!! Stay away from WHITE box parts.Their crap or stolen parts. If I was you, I would only buy top quality parts. Expressly if you plan to drive the truck for another 5 years."
