188629,wuchikubo,2008-04-17 13:21:00,1114,"Okay, I'm looking to gather info on where the best sucker fishing spot would be. I'd like to target some channel cats later on and would like to get some cut bait for it. Seeing that nobody much cares for these coarse fish, I'll like to target them on some small rivers.  Yeah, I know about the thread with about CO's checking so I will use my 6' rod with worms just to make sure I don't tick off any steelie anglers.  Wouldn't removing some suckers from the rivers help with the trout's survival chances?  Looking for a spot within 45 min of Markham. PM if you wish to keep it secret LOL.  Stan"
188639,super dave,2008-04-17 13:44:00,323,"Humber river by old mill station.  Don't fish by the dam though.  Santuary even if you are targetting suckers.  Plenty below in the rapids. Or Oshawa creek. I haven't been to both locations yet this year, but have seen plenty of them in both rivers before."
188640,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-17 13:48:00,2050,"well last year I caught a ton of them in the credit river - between dundas and burnhamthorpe....using a pink trout worm, and raw shrimp to...suckers love raw shrimp..  good luck"
188642,Roy,2008-04-17 13:49:00,13728,"Stan, I'm not so sure that that many people want to admit to knowing anything at all about suckers.  Good luck in your search."

188646,wuchikubo,2008-04-17 14:02:00,1114," UF, I gotta feeling that using a pink trout worm might work against me if the CO came by to chat.  Shrimp?! I'm thinking that's luxury food for them, I'm thinking cheap of course. Worms picked up off the road when it was wet is going to be my bait."
188650,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-17 14:18:00,2050,"big fat juicy earthworms are just as good as anything, I just use the pinkies for near everything because I tend to fish spur of the moment kind of thing and they're always good to go.  I also like the fact that I can catch a few fish on 1 worm, and don't have to keep any critters in the fridge.  As for shrimp, I wrap up small chunks of raw shrimp in roe bags, along with a couple of those colored buoyant balls as a suppliment for not having roe.  Unless things have changed from last year that stretch of the river is an extended season.  I don't live in the sauga anymore.  Cheers dude, UF"
188653,brooks999,2008-04-17 14:39:00,38,"I know when I was a kid, Duffins Creek in Pickering Village or Ajax as it is now called....had a lot of suckers.  Have no idea about now though."
188655,Silver Tracker,2008-04-17 14:48:00,12,"Maple Leaf Box Office- about 20,000 suckers every Saturday and Wednesday night."
188665,wolfville,2008-04-17 15:23:00,396,"HF, that pond very close to where you are has tons of suckers in it. I tried it a few days ago and caught about 20 in 1.5 hrs. Light line with a small piece of worm is the ticket."
188675,wuchikubo,2008-04-17 15:55:00,1114,  Above or below?
188687,ccmtcanada,2008-04-17 16:20:00,7971,I'd think the fish are below the water line...but hey...I don't know that spot....LOL.  Stan....Checking a few things regarding that PM....be back to you soon!

189198,andrey7474,2008-04-18 16:56:00,47,"  LOL, so true"
192485,Domi Fish,2008-04-25 23:13:00,46,"Yea it's only 2 miles away...  Good call on Duffins Creek.  You can always find plenty of suckers there, even today.  Another place I would check out is Lynde Creek. It's always been a good spot for suckers as long as I can remember. Pringle Creek also.  Just get yourself some nightcrawlers and you're in business."
