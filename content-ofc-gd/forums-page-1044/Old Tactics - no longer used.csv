190980,bucktail,2008-04-22 19:30:00,1857,Funny old techniques and lures can come back into favour especially in pressured waters. Guides like to cast and retrieve spoons on Lake Fork for largemouths now. The last 2 winners on the B.A.S.S. circuit were using old style Carolina rigs. Whats iold is new again eventually....kinda like fashion! My brother used to troll a Diamond Jim...I think by Luhr Jenson...not sure...he caught some big fish on  that ugly bait!
191038,Jigger,2008-04-22 21:24:00,1237,"How many have switched from grubs to tubes to senkos? I try and keep in mind techniques that have helped over the years. Last year I remember a real slow bite and was skunked up to this point. I found a pack of largemouth and threw just about every ""modern"" technique I could think of. Still the smell remained. I took out a pack of 7"" power worms that had been sitting in the bottom of the box for I don't know how long and threw one on a 1/4oz ballhead jig. Wouldn't you know it, I went through the whole bag and caught largie after Largie. Since then, the jig and worm combo was brought back to life! Man I can't wait to get out there."
191058,Kerry,2008-04-22 22:25:00,383,"I'm still tossin' a BIG O but in the chartreuse/white.Still clobbers walleye bass pike and even the odd crappie or perch will hit it. As to the twitchin' rapala, I always have a soft spot for the old light perch Ripplin' Redfin with a more pronounced rip to keep it down a foot or so.Great for hot to trot bass and pike.  Kerry"
191062,Beans,2008-04-22 22:29:00,3339,"WOW !...Jitterbugs, River Runts, Diamond Jims, Jointed Pikie Minnows, June Bug spinners...all pre Rapala...long skinny baits like Benos and Lazy Ikes for pickerel...  All we ever used for pike at West Lake at Wellington was Dominion 36 or 197 Willow Leaf Spinners...  I found a couple of ""Rooster Tail"" spinners way back in a box and will give them a try as I understand Dawg uses them with success...even calls himself after the color of one of them...  Great thread for memories..."
191070,JohnF,2008-04-22 22:42:00,3494," Funny. The guy who got me back into creek fishing after a 50 year hiatus is an old buddy from diaper days (the ones Bill has just moved away from) who never stopped fishing. He's an artist (not of fishing, of art) who spends the winters in the Everglades fishing with his kayaks and his summers wet-wading the Thames or Nine Mile Creek. He got me re-started a couple of years ago and introduced me to the grey floating Raps with exactly the technique you described. I have no idea how long he's used them but they're all he uses, and they work, for smallies and for pike.  After a few times on the river the gearpig virus caught me and I went out and bought plastic - fake Mann red worms on big Gamakatsu (sp?) hooks and they worked great. He started ripping me off for those and was very impressed that a newby like me figgered that out all by myself. I haven't told him about you guys yet. Then I tried gold curly-tailed grubs and discovered that when nothing else wants to play the rock bass will always try to eat them. That's a great last resort when nothing else was biting, if only for a chance to get some fishy smell on my hands to offend my wife when I get home. In any case the grey Raps are always our goto lures, we're never without 'em. I had no idea they were so antidiluvean.  8)  Speaking of gearpigs, I'm gonna screw my friend up totally once I learn to use a flyrod and the new baitcaster. He's been whining already about how I've totally corrupted him. He has no idea what's in store. After years of using nothing but really cheap Shakespeare spincasters with the cheapest line and really crappy rods, my new Quantum Energy spincaster and the complementary rod have spoiled him. He had to buy one of 'em. Now he knows he's gonna be getting a baitcaster and a flyrod etc - he's well on his way to perdition and damnation - and loving it. He's always fished alone. He had no idea that there was anything but grey floating Raps and really crappy reels. It's fun being an evil influence and y'all can take some of the credit.  JF"
191080,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 22:53:00,2710,As a kid we use to fish for nothing but carp on the river till one day this older gentleman came down the river hammering these green and black fish that fought  like stink. We asked him what he was using and what he was catching. He was kind enough to stop and explain the whole thing to a couple of ten year olds. This was the early seventies when tten yr olds could still disappear by themselves for the day down to the banks of a river and fish without them being reported abducted by their paranoid parents. He was using black and gold rapalas and he was hammering smallmouth. The amount of lawns we mowed and pop bottles we collected so we could keep ourselves supplied with them that summer was staggering.
191090,misfish,2008-04-22 23:06:00,29133,"Now dont that bring back the days out with my grandfather. My pop and he had a box full of them.  I was a hulla popper guy,then this sinko thing came along and then this thing called a tube and then theres the jerk bait.   I wonder what would happen if one went back to the old school.Would they win a tourny or two?"
191102,GbayGiant,2008-04-22 23:20:00,1780,"I've tried all the ""NEW"" in fashion techniques over the years and always fall back to the trusty all around jig and minnow or gulp now. It's what I'm good at and always works if fish are swimming. For me it's finding the fish, after that a jig will always work on almost every species. Certain situations call for different techniques but I stay tossing jigs all year and realized after trying everything else over the years, this is usually all I need and trust the most, majority of the time I only take a box of various sized/styled jigs and leave the extra weight at home. Musky or trolling is usually the only time I don't jig and even then it still works sometimes.  And the pros always tell you to change it up all day untill you find something that works, but all it is really is the rite time and place, chances are if you didn't switch baits you would have still caught the fish, not always, but a jig will always work if your on top of fish.  Anything that's shinny and spins is a close second."
191200,forrest,2008-04-23 01:58:00,1032,I'll tell ya...way back in them depression years a lot of us used dynooomite.....yep......it worked real good.  Fell out of fashion after all those fancy fishing lures started becoming more popular.
191368,tinbanger,2008-04-23 14:10:00,1028,"Live bait was our fav 30 years plus ago ( worms and frogs ) Picked the dew worms a night or two before and stoped along the way to see if we could catch a few frogs for them bass.  Havn;t used live bait ( except for perch,walleye) for years!  Still have my dad's old metal tackle box , lots of good memories there , dusty roads ,leaky wooden rental boats and the  occaisional outboard fire ! In the mis 70'3 we 'upgraded ' to a 14 ' fibreglass my dad found on a creek , hauled it out, patched and painted her and it became 'our' boat for the next few years Heavy as hell but stable. Used to trailer it on a snowmobile trailer with an old tire under the keel .One of our backroad excursions had the tire flying off and headed down an embankment towards some coattages . Luckily the trees stopped it just short of the cabin .  Thanks for stirring up those memories.  TB"
192581,fishboy,2008-04-26 04:38:00,550,jitterbug and the crazy crawler..
192582,danbo,2008-04-26 05:01:00,2646,That Strawberry Vamp Spook was a Scugog musky slayer.  http://www.musky-lures.com/colcht.htm  The old Meadow Mouse was a bass getter on Chemong.  http://fishingcollectables.com/images/he326.jpg
192596,danbo,2008-04-26 09:14:00,2646,I used a single frog's tongue on a small hook to catch 50 Rock Bass with as a youngster!  Sorta invented the 1st curlytail micro-grub with it! Lol. Honest to God..
192599,danbo,2008-04-26 10:02:00,2646,Cisco Kid jointed perch was good too!  http://www.ustacould.com/lures/
190926,Mike Pike,2008-04-22 17:17:00,1332,"That's funny that you mention the good ol' reliable Mepps spinners.  The Aglia #3 in both the copper and silver finishes always occupied a bin in my tackle box.  And I always had two of each because of the 'snaggability' factor as you mentioned!  (lol)  Maybe that's why they lost their popularity, as you suggest.  I'd say line twist is another reason people stopped fishing with 'em.  Funny though, two years ago I remembered those lures and the fun I had casting them on rivers and ponds and bought a few and started casting with 'em once again.  What a blast.  I'd add a swivel to help eleviate the line twisting and started catching bass after bass again, mostly in river situations( the Grand and it's tributaries ).  They cast like a dream and always have a special place in the fishing vest when heading out on the rivers and streams.  Probably have a few when I hit the trout stream on the opener!"
190927,fishnsled,2008-04-22 17:19:00,3520,"Red Devils(Don't have to tell some people here that they still catch fish  ), Hulla Poppers, Mepps, Beetle spins are a few of my oldies that I don't use anymore.  Rattling Spot  and the redfin are others that seem to sit in the tackle box these days.  No reason for this, I better bring them out this year.  Great thread!"
190930,OhioFisherman,2008-04-22 17:23:00,6623,"LOL 40 years ago I used plastic worms a lot, still do, a lot of the names have changed, they still catch fish. Used to do the Rapala thing also, still carry then but not used often.  Went from Jitterbug, Hula Popper, Buzzbait at night to jigs and soft plastics most of the time, just better results."
190932,Casey123,2008-04-22 17:26:00,461,Hulla Poppers and Strawberry Spooks - Would like to get some more Strawberry Spooks - use to drive the Musky nuts on Kashabog Lake
190935,kickingfrog,2008-04-22 17:36:00,8333, Strawberry spooks??? Is this a colour/ pattern of a Zara spook? Or something totally different?
190938,OhioFisherman,2008-04-22 17:47:00,6623,"Strawberry must be an Ontario color, back in the day a Heddon Vamp (wood) was the lure of choice in Pointe Au Baril, maybe Kennedy`s and E&E just got a deal on them? Seemed to be the ones they sold most often."
190940,kickingfrog,2008-04-22 17:54:00,8333,As a kid I'd raid my Dad's tackle box. The two lures I'd go for first... a big green/yellow crazy crawler and a perch pattern river runt. I don't think the river runt is made any more. I think it Heddon made them. I'll have to look that up.
190942,bpsbassman,2008-04-22 17:59:00,941," Great story!!  I remember my first trip to my lake 36 years ago.  5 day trip, rained everyday, but was the best fishing I had ever experienced.  I had a #5 Mepps Black Fury on and never took it off.  Never used it much after a couple of years.  I think I will try it again this year.  Also had great success with Berkley 7"" Motor Oil Power Worms.  Went through them by the 100's.  Haven't used them much the last few years, but picked up a few bags in the States earlier this year and will give them a try again.  Great thread!"
190943,kickingfrog,2008-04-22 18:06:00,8333,Well how about that. What I called a River Runt the Heddon site has as a River Runt Spook. And there is a strawberry pattern. As well as a coach dog and a Fluorescent Green Coach Dog from the 70's.  Neat site.  http://www.tacklecollecting.com/laterriverruntcolors.htm
