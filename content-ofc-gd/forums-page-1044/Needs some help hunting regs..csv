192740,evster,2008-04-26 17:10:00,367,"I found this map a while ago...don't know if I would trust it though but it might give you an idea.  http://publicdocs.mnr.gov.on.ca/View.asp?D...chment_ID=25451  It doesn't go by WMU either.  For example, I hunt in 92D which is mostly no sunday gun hunting, but since I hunt in Bayham there is sunday hunting.  Safest bet is to contact the MNR I would think."
192747,misfish,2008-04-26 17:24:00,29133,"Looking at that map, it would be a NO,but I know last year while archury hunting deer(same area),there were guys hunting ducks and geese in the fields. Guess I,ll play it safe til monday and use the bow. Heck I might even try that fishing thing,I did after all,buy a lic today . Caught up in all the excitement.LOL  Thanks Bud."
192753,Fisherman,2008-04-26 17:39:00,7201,"Brian, found the link that you need, it shows 76D open on the sundays, the rest of 76 not. Here:   http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001312.pdf Good luck."
192757,misfish,2008-04-26 17:47:00,29133,"Thanks to you aswell. It is not clear enough. I,ll have to take the cons rd and ask monday. I cant remember if it,s c or d. Pretty bad eh."
192760,Smokey,2008-04-26 17:50:00,1278,"Here is the latest up to date map from the OFAH site. It does show some hunting in certain parts of 76. By looking at it you can hunt in Ramara, Tay, and Clearview Townships. I don't know the area well so you have to have a look at it and see if this makes sense.  OFAH map.  Good Luck  Mike"
192763,misfish,2008-04-26 18:02:00,29133,"Didnt work Mike. I just talk to my buddy and he,s says Im good. I would hate to make a mistake like this."
192766,Smokey,2008-04-26 18:11:00,1278,Try again I screwed it up somehow. That map was updated on April 15th so should be accurate.
192772,misfish,2008-04-26 18:47:00,29133,"Thanks again Mike. Like the others, it gives no DEFINATIVE boundry. I google satilited the area,no way up to date as there is new homes built there. Hoped to find something but not 100% sure. No worries,Monday I,ll get the right answer."
192846,Fisherman,2008-04-26 23:36:00,7201,"Brian, here's another good eye in the sky for Simcoe County. You can pretty much zoom in on the fly on the cows butt with this one. http://www.discoversimcoe.com/InteractiveMapping/index.htm"
