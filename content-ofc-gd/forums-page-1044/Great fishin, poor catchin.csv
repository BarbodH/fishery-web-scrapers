The wind was blowin all the warm water to one side of the lake, and we were left with the colder water.  Needless to say, I tried to feed the fish plenty of tasty chum and cooked up corn, but they were simply not there. Not even a sunfish today.  Was still great to get out though, despite some brief rainy periods.  In a couple of weeks when the weather warms up a bit more I'll be back out there. In the meantime it's all about sushi.  Hope everyone's season is goin well."

In four or five feet of water, along a 100 meter section of shoreline, we found Crappie and large Sunfish stacked up and feeding. Better luck next time. Garry2Rs"
