192499,muskymike,2008-04-25 23:38:00,772,"Minnow's new Ranger has got me thinking....if I were in the market (if I had indispensable cash) which of these boats would I purchase.  1) Ranger 2) Champion 3) Bass Cat  All three are well recognized, well built boats, with Ranger being the ""Brand"" in Canada as you dont seem much of either Champion or Bass Cat.  Personally I would purchase a Champion but thats just me.  What would you purchase?"

192595,Guest skeeter99,2008-04-26 09:07:00,0,"SKEETER BOATS ALL THE WAY  LOL!!!!!!   second would be a gambler, They only build about 50 a year maybe third would be a bass cat bullet boat not a bad choice either   rangers are way to heavy you need to put 350 hp on her to run with same size boat in other manufacturer is only running a 200 hp, but you could run it into a wall and probably make it  nitros forget it , I am not into cookie cutter boats made with chop guns, and not to mention they look are are made cheap    did you know skeeter made the first bass boat  I want the i class boat check the baby out below  http://www.skeeterboats.com/products/7"
192598,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-26 10:00:00,2050," I Agree %100 on the skeeter choice!  Nice looking boats, stable in bigger water, built strong, Lots of room for fishing and storage, and I've been over 77 MPH in Mercer's - Full load, two people + camera gear.  As for the Gambler, I just saw a brand new one a few weeks ago in Alabama, DUUUUUDE they've gotta be the ugliest boats on the market.  I swear they haven't changed their molds since the 70's.  No thanks!  Cheers, UF"
192601,Guest skeeter99,2008-04-26 10:25:00,0,"they aint ugly  just very unique   they are built for speed, they are a racing hull  unless they bring back the javelin's  they were the fastest boat built extremely light and durable   what is the matter with a gambler? very clean lines and all the deck space to fish that you could dream of  http://www.gamblerboats.com/Outlaw1900-3.html  another real good one is the allison boats, fastest tested bass boat out there now over 100 mph  centre console and once again more fishable deck space  http://www.allisonboats.com/bass_boats/xb2002_index.php  http://www.allisonboats.com/bass_boats/xb2003_index.php   but I would buy a skeeter again, got 12 k set aside now and probably in a year or two trade in my skeeter for the new bug !!!LOL!!"
