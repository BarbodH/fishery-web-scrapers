A few steelhead were being caught, I caught a sucker, a walleye and a smallmouth bass (no photos) but no rainbows. I've never seen or caught walleye or smallmouth in that spot before, but it's not too far of a stretch I guess?  Took the long way home to look at the spot we'll be starting at tomorrow. Sure enough there were fish there.       How'd I do with the backgrounds???"
