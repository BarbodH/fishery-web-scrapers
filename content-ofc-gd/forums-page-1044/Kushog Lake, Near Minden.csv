192579,fishboy,2008-04-26 04:25:00,550,"it's a typical Shield lake; smallmouth, lake trout & whitefish + the usual suspects for panfish (pumpkinseed, perch & the elusive rock bass)"

Big large and smallmouth as well.  My grandmother has a cottage on one of the smaller connecting lakes to Kushog. Fished Kushog many times and always did well. Laker fishing is good on the north end of the lake."
192691,swahrer,2008-04-26 15:17:00,28,Thanks guys.  So I take it there are no Walleye to ber had?  Pike & Bass are always fun.  Would you prefer to fish Kushog over Little Gull??
