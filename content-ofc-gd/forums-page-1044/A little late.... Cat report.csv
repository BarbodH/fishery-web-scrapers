Hit Fishmasters marina and he was more than helpful in telling me were to fish and sharing some info, Thanks for that. Our group did alright with some monster carp, good drum and a gauntlet of cats from 1/4 lb to my 17lb cat. Never targeted them before but will make a point to try it again next year. Many dew worms threaded on the hook was the ticket, hope ya got a backyard full of them cause it can get expensive LOL...   Tight lines RF"
