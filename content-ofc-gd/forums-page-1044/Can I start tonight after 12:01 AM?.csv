192209,GBW,2008-04-25 13:06:00,8460,Hey all.  Just wondering if you are aloud to start fishing tonight after midnight as technically it is Sat.  Let me know cause this itch needs to be scratched!  Thanks.
192210,johnnyb,2008-04-25 13:09:00,3413,Yup!  I'm sure you won't be the only one either --- I remember going down and keeping the fire going through the night so we could fish from midnight into the morning --- I also remember not catching anything until the sun came up      Good luck!
192211,FLEX ROD,2008-04-25 13:09:00,394,"Yes you can, good luck and have fun.  See you out their.  FLEX"

192220,cityfisher,2008-04-25 13:21:00,959,"yes you can,,, watch out for drunk punk kids running around the rivers at night... had that problem a couple times before"
192223,Beans,2008-04-25 13:24:00,3339,You sure can...and with a bit of luck using a micro tube under a lighted float...you just may run into a nice school of crappie...
192261,walleyejigger,2008-04-25 14:56:00,876,"yep, where we fish walleye opener on the long weekend of may, alot of ppl go out for the night bite at midnight"
192268,GBW,2008-04-25 15:13:00,8460,"someone has set up a tent already where I'm going, HAHAHA. the only thing I found in the water just now (where I plan on going) was a bever..."
192269,Stoty,2008-04-25 15:15:00,2910,Dont start at 11:59 though......
192270,Canuck2fan,2008-04-25 15:19:00,1444,"Just make sure your watch is syncronzied with the local CO and you should be good to go. Expect there to be 10 or 12 people drunk and in a group splashing around for hours before you get there unless you leave now and stand there for 10 or 12 hours, if where you are going has less than a 5 mile walk from a road.  I was just at the local Tackle and the number of wahoos are loading up to be on the water by 7PM was shocking.... Personally, I am going to wait and go up late Saturday night after all the drunks have passed out and wait for dawn Sunday."
