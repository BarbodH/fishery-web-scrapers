Just wondering exactly what and where is this ""hole in the wall""? Also, why is called the ""hole in the wall""? I've googled it but I can't find any references to it.  Thanks."

LOL!!!  it is where the snowmobile trail comes out of the bush about halfway between west shore marine and the nonquon on the west side of the lake, if you are close to shore you can see the snowmobile signs right at the edge of the lake   this trail is about only a sled wide  so basically when you were lurking the fishing scugog messageboard, he was referring to and area lets say to keep it simple a little north of stephenson's point to the white boat house on seven mile island(which is in the goreski;s entrance to the marina to the north) on the island side   but it is well know for walleye in winter and spring from the whole in the wall to 7 mile island  here is a map from the port perry snowmobile club  look at PPSC #2 ice crossing just north of port perry (that is the hole in the wall)  http://www.portperrysnowmobileclub.com/Images/CORSA_Map.jpg"
