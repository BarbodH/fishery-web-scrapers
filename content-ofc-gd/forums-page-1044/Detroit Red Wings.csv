191835,kickingfrog,2008-04-24 16:29:00,8333," Wait until you see the empty seats. Hockey town my butt.  Play-off games are great. Bring a rod and fish the river, it's right there."
191839,Stoty,2008-04-24 16:59:00,2910,"Ha ha ha, never though of that!   Anyone have a Red Wings Jersey they want to get rid of?!?!"
191969,walleyejigger,2008-04-24 22:56:00,876,"you lucky dude, wow 70 bucks now that's a deal, just checked the sites and Wings ticket range from $55-150, habs  $44.30-305.65, sharks $55-255, Dallas $19-188, Pens $75-225 didn't check the rest"
191972,irishfield,2008-04-24 23:01:00,26272,You forgot the Air Canada Centre Walleyjigger....  $650 just to sit in the seat and remenise about the good 'ol days.. pre '68 !
192057,Zubris21,2008-04-25 01:14:00,563," Im living in Windsor right now and made it over to a couple games.  It's true they had trouble filling the seats at the beginning of the season, I got tickets to 3 games at $9 a seat to fix the problem.  Seems like as I went the seats filled up and the radio shows are starting to talk about how the fan based turned around.  I also recommend bringing a rod.  The river truly is right there and there have been plenty of boats and shore anglers alike the past couple weeks.  Im going to try to get out tomorrow or sat for one last fish before moving back home to kingston."
192094,chickenhawk,2008-04-25 02:05:00,612,LETS GO RED WINGS!!
192133,AzuluSpookd,2008-04-25 04:01:00,348,The last few years I've been down for about 6 games....last year in particular they could not sell out a playoff game. It was quite disturbing.  We walked around the downtown core and there was nobody and I mean nobody else walking around. Kinda creepy
192264,Stoty,2008-04-25 15:08:00,2910,"I cant wait! This will be my 1st playoff experience.  My buddy and I are so pumped up! And they allow camera's too, which is wicked! Cant wait to get some get shots!"
192403,Kirk,2008-04-25 19:28:00,347,"Theres no bad seats in Detroit, smaller type of venue versus ACC.  I saw Guy Lafleur play there when he was with the Nordiques.  Fish on the Windsor side, bring a 'fillet' knife if you are on the Detroit side LOL"
192420,irishfield,2008-04-25 20:19:00,26272,..or a flare gun !
192481,muskymike,2008-04-25 22:59:00,772," Dont bring anything shiny, you will be spotted far to quickly!  Have a good time Stoty you lucky #*&@()%^"
192506,misfish,2008-04-25 23:54:00,29133,Game 5 ????????Will there be one??????????
192557,lickmyarmpit,2008-04-26 02:41:00,359,"I've got seasons at the joe, couldn't belive how cheap they were.......about the cost of a large draft at the ACC.  Habs wings for the cup how much do you think i can get for those ticks.  GO WINGS GO"
192810,Maverick,2008-04-26 20:58:00,371,Not lookin good for game 5 Stoty. 4-0 after 2 in game 2. Hope Colorado can win one at home. It would be sweet if you were there to close out the series.  Go Avalanche! At least for one game   .
192817,kickingfrog,2008-04-26 21:12:00,8333,"Agreed, it's not looking good for Colorado, but I've always believed in the theory that a 7 game series doesn't get ""interesting"" until a team losses at home. As a neutral observer I'd just like the games to be close and competitive.  Just role those game 5's for the third round if the Avs don't ring at least one up at home."
