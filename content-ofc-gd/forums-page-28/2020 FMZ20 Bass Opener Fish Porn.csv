Great to see with the weather that we've been having that a lot of the Smallies have done there thing already. Obviously there are still some bedding fish, but I do believe that most of them are done. They must still be in a bit in a bit of a post spawn funk as we were unable to catch anything of note on a horizontal presentation, one day the drop shot was the deal and the next day it was the Ned rig. We probably caught over 100 fish on Sat. and 60 on Sun. but the fish on Sun were definitely a better average size with probably 25 in the 5-6 lbs. range. Definitely one of the best Smallmouth Bass fisheries in the world.            "
