1063526,grimsbylander,2020-06-22 16:27:00,3016,I can imagine that owning a business which is structured around having thousands of people in a building could be very fragile. I would have to assume that there are a lot of long term contracts in place to solidify pricing and availability fr each event. ie the rental of the venues are most likely locked in for multi-year leases. This means the dollars are going out regardless of whether the show doors open. Glad to see Master Promotions is a Canadian company.
