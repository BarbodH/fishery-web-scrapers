1063634,Garnet,2020-06-25 13:53:00,2056,I have a story like yours. My buddy sent his bassboat into factory for repair. It was total brand new and the few things factory didn't replace he did. First trip with the new outfitted boat I said you catch the first wally so I waited like 5-6 cast maybe 10. You need to understand we new where the fish where and he is not catching. I make a weak cast telling him it's to long. Got the greats bucktail jig crack from a wally I set hook and land a 8ib wally. We still laugh about me steal first fish.
