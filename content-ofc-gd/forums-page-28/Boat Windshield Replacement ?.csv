1063084,Raycaster,2020-06-11 12:31:00,528,"Just purchased a used 2003ish Legend Xcite 164 and wondering about replacing the console windshield that is missing. As usual, the funds are pretty low so looking for as economical choice as possible. I’m wondering if a DIY plexiglass heatgun project would do it? I love DIY but if it’s going to look sketchy than not a option. Custom windshield online sound scary $$$ so any suggestions are welcome. Maybe scouring boat graveyards might be an option. "
1063121,Pigeontroller,2020-06-12 01:10:00,2793,"Should work, make a template out of paper or cardboard. Go to your local Glass company and get some nice Grey Plexiglass, use a heat gun cautiously...Maybe get a small test piece and practice."
1063126,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-12 10:01:00,720,"I suggest Lexan over plexi. Plexi cracks easily and lexan/polycarbonate won’t. If your bends are long and crisp, I’d check to see if the glass shop can do the heat bends."
1063130,Garnet,2020-06-12 12:18:00,2056,You have 3 options Don't replace . Pay the price. DIY Think I would go fishing worry about that next year.
1063142,OhioFisherman,2020-06-12 13:59:00,6623, 25 hp? might not need a windshield?
1063148,Raycaster,2020-06-12 16:33:00,528,"Actually took out yesterday on choppy Hamilton Bay. Over 20mph quickly with 2 people total. Not sure if windshield would of prevented me from getting soaked but would look better for sure. On a side note and not on topic, the 16ft Legend leans heavy to the right. I know a 200lb. driver doesn’t help but the other person 150lb. sat on left side. Also had 2 heavy trolling motor batteries in front left side. There is a empty live well on left side might level boat a bit. Will have to research more, will be looking for comparable boat during summer to ask Owner questions."
1063149,OhioFisherman,2020-06-12 16:44:00,6623,"roughly 8 pounds a gallon for water, a ten gallon livewell that would be a small one will change the weight balance quickly."
1063150,lew,2020-06-12 17:10:00,12766,Actually 10 pounds per Imperial gallon here in Canada Paul
1063155,pics,2020-06-12 20:33:00,1268,Boat graveyards exist but where would you find one??
1063159,Raycaster,2020-06-12 21:13:00,528,Isn't there a wrecking yard between Hamilton and Port Dover filled with some boats? 
1063160,irishfield,2020-06-12 21:46:00,26272,"As others have noted, Lexan and you can bend it cold in a metal brake to suit your needs.. Clean it with Pledge if you don't want to spring for plastic cleaner."
1063161,Raycaster,2020-06-12 21:54:00,528,I inquired at the plastic place downtown Hamilton and waiting for the email reply. I think a 45” x 20” piece should be ok. Did up a quick design and looks not too hard. Will probably round some corners too.    
1063179,OhioFisherman,2020-06-13 14:01:00,6623,Might be your best bet? I am guessing most in a boat graveyard might already be broken?
1063205,Chris J,2020-06-14 00:37:00,44,Custom mold and tint.  Out of Texas but if you want a windshield that looks stock. http://getaboatwindshield.com/ 
1063218,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-14 12:50:00,720,Read the google reviews before you go. I wouldn’t go to one in particular
1063219,shanty gord,2020-06-14 14:16:00,16,There is a place in Brampton called Acrylics by design that can make that for you give them a call
