1062822,David Chong,2020-06-04 22:58:00,836,"They're in Simcoe and they're in Quinte so chances are pretty good they're in the Kawartha's! Surprised that they're as far in as Chemong, sure it wasn't a Sculpin?"
1062823,kickingfrog,2020-06-04 23:21:00,8333,Gopys areÂ invasive. Sculpins are not. Fused/separate pectoral fins is an easy tell.
1062824,Tjames09,2020-06-05 00:43:00,664,Oh they do look very similar. I didnâ€™t take a picture. Iâ€™ll take a picture of the next one. Could be sculpin.
1062825,captpierre,2020-06-05 00:43:00,2521,Hope youâ€™re wrong. Next come the pike. ðŸ˜³
1062828,Garfisher,2020-06-05 01:15:00,229,"https://www.eddmaps.org/ontario/distribution/viewmap.cfm?sub=12252 Chemong has had gobies for a few years now. Chemong seems to be the ""eastern"" front in the Kawarthas, while in the western Kawarthas it seems that they haven't been able to make it into Canal with the Trent-Severn draining the canal every winter"
1062839,AKRISONER,2020-06-05 11:51:00,5558,I couldnâ€™t imagine what would happen to those panfish in that lake if more than just musky started eating them. The tri lakes are my second favourite fishery in Ontario because they are big butÂ just entirely different than any other lakes around Ontario. I hope they never change much aside from the fish getting bigger and more plentiful.

1062844,fishindevil,2020-06-05 15:08:00,6254,its a fact they are in buckhorn lake as well as pigeon lake as well but as usual the ministry has to officially say it....some may remember about 10yrs ago i caught a pike in a haliburton lake where there was none i took pics and measurements and everything and because i did not keep the fish or take a scale sample they could not confirm...2yrs later they confirmed in a trap there was pike in the lake ....i said oh really i told you that years before...but yes they are in most kawartha lakes now and will keep spreading for sure and there have been confirmed catches of pike in sturgen lake as well as pigen too...
1063024,Tjames09,2020-06-10 09:41:00,664,"I got another one this week, looks like goby from google comparison. "
1063042,AKRISONER,2020-06-10 15:50:00,5558,Iâ€™m saying sculpin  
1063144,David Chong,2020-06-12 14:37:00,836,The pelvic fins are the easy way to tell the difference between a Sculpin & a Goby! The Goby's are fused together and a Sculpin's are separate! Look at it's underside and you'll know! 
1063145,misfish,2020-06-12 14:41:00,29133,"Looks like white fish bait to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ðŸ¤£"
1063172,cisco,2020-06-13 12:19:00,597,Definitely need look at the bottom fins. Does look like sculpin due to wee top fins.
1063177,OhioFisherman,2020-06-13 13:48:00,6623,"LOL, since they are already in Lake Erie? why not as a legal bait? "
