1063089,DRIFTER_016,2020-06-11 16:24:00,10439,Season premier on tonight. Another season trying to survived on Great Slave Lake.  
1063090,TJQ,2020-06-11 16:33:00,7806,I love that show!!
1063091,Terry,2020-06-11 16:43:00,14456,I will be watching it
1063093,wkrp,2020-06-11 16:52:00,656,Looking forward to it.
1063100,NAW,2020-06-11 18:16:00,4022,Is it on Netflix or any online places?  I don't get it on my crappy cable package.
1063101,misfish,2020-06-11 18:39:00,29133,"I would put a million $$$$$$ on you Nick, if you competed in this. Nick is a machine ya,ll."
1063108,Chrispy,2020-06-11 20:01:00,168,"I can't wait!!  It is not on Netflix, they have another one called Win the Wilderness.  Tried watching it late Friday night and fell asleep so not to sure if it is good or not!  LOL!  Chrispy!"
1063117,LostAnotherOne,2020-06-11 22:55:00,956,Anybody remember the cop tapping out after the first night.  It was a few seasons ago.  Hilarious
1063133,NAW,2020-06-12 12:30:00,4022,"Dude, I would love to be alone in the bush for that long!!!"
1063156,pics,2020-06-12 20:35:00,1268,"Man, the first guy to tap out seemed a little off..lol.. the Canadian girl has the best shelter by far.. she has the skills but I don't know about her mental toughness.."
1063158,Terry,2020-06-12 20:53:00,14456,If she is going to cry every time she kills food she isn’t going to last
1063162,misfish,2020-06-12 22:24:00,29133,"So I just watched. 1st time watcher. Explain please? All by themselves, yet there are cameras everywhere .  Even one on a tripod in the water .How much time do they spend setting up the cameras, before they start to try and get their food and what ever else to survive ?  Also,how dumb are the ones that have bows,yet go walking without them ? 2 of them. One seen a bear,the other a wolverine. None had their bows. LOL  Also to much time spent by the guy with the hot tub. This is not club med, or maybe it is. Felt for the guy that lost his fire starter, but a good zip loc glad bag with a 1000 wooden matches would of been better IMO.  Maybe against the rules ? The poor bunny was crying. So was I. LOL  She did build a very nice hut though. KUDOS to here. So far,I like her chances."
1063163,Terry,2020-06-12 22:43:00,14456,Let see what the next 6 people are doing for the first ten days.   I guess that’s how they are going to do it. Showcase so many each week and now a talk session at the end of the show.
1063164,misfish,2020-06-12 23:01:00,29133,I am going to re watch all the RAMBO movies and prepare for the next season.  Just need to know if they have shore line delivery  beer. LOL
1063165,canoecarrier,2020-06-12 23:45:00,54,"How the hell would you know 1-3 people could possibly last the 100 days? What then, seems like it must be set up somehow. I have watched most of the bush shows, and this one I have not followed after the first season as it was pretty slow. You can only watch a camera zoomed in on some guys face going on about nothing for so long haha. As the other guy said, I had a good laugh when the girl trapped the rabbit and started crying. Day 1 ... Gave it a shot today and was very similar but a couple of things happen to keep you somewhat interested. Not a horrible show but maybe best with a couple of drinks. "
1063166,DRIFTER_016,2020-06-13 02:06:00,10439,Wait til they start burning their huts down in the middle of November.  😂 I started watching last year because they were on Great Slave and I know the area where they are. For supposedly professional outdoors people and survival experts they make tons of mistakes. The guy that lost his fire steel and tapped out was building a kick donkey cabin though. I think I would make out OK if they dropped me off out there where these guys are trying to survive.  The longest anyone has survived so far is 87 days in a warmer climate. The guy who won last year lasted 77 days. 
1063174,wkrp,2020-06-13 12:47:00,656,"That guy having a hot bath should have looked around around his bathtub for the fire steel ,or did i miss something."
1063175,Terry,2020-06-13 12:54:00,14456,While true they only stayed that long because everyone else tapped out. I’m sure some of them could have stayed much longer if the others had survived longer to keep the game going
1063272,LefroyFisherman,2020-06-16 12:42:00,602,"I was also surprised that the guy that lost his fire starter couldn't last one night and then look again in the morning, I realize your basically screwed without a fire but still. Can't believe one guy didn't bring a bow, it would certainly help a little even if your not great with it."
1063278,Sinker,2020-06-16 19:28:00,8692,Why does nobody ever bring a fishing rod? 
1063279,gordy28,2020-06-16 19:52:00,638,Thanks for the reminder - will have to try to catch up I do love this show Also just finished Life Below Zero Canada as well and really enjoyed it - its on Cottage Life network or Crave Cheers Andrew

1063282,DRIFTER_016,2020-06-16 20:27:00,10439,"Yeah, I watch it too. Have known Mike for over 20 years."
1063290,gordy28,2020-06-16 20:58:00,638,Cool - Pike Mike is great  - they are all very interesting - the one Swede guy w the pipe cracks me up.  When he was climbing the shots made me dizzy just watching on the couch!
1063298,DRIFTER_016,2020-06-17 01:39:00,10439,He's pretty cool. I like the guy in Ontario ehhh!! He's pretty cool too ehhh!!  😁
