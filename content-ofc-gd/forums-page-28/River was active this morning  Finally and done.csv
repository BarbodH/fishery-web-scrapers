1063715,dave524,2020-06-28 19:52:00,4508,Are the bigger resident fish Browns?
1063716,misfish,2020-06-28 20:28:00,29133,"Mixed Get those nice flabby belly res bows with the very colorful fins. I have seen browns caught, but yet to get one myself."
1063717,dave524,2020-06-28 21:37:00,4508,"Hatchery Frankenfish shaped like footballs, thought got rid of that broodstock years ago."
1063789,misfish,2020-07-01 15:06:00,29133,"This will be my last outing til fall now. Water is up to 67 deg, and I was baking by 8 am. Walked past my last furthest spot of last time and found a great stretch. There was another hatch going on. These ones were small and black.  I actually watched them rise off the water. That was cool . I  found the tungsten bead head flys I made in #16. They were in another fly box buried in my bag. They were the ticket. Caught 2 ,  12"" res bows close to the tail out of the pool.  Allowing the fly to start the sweep and retive quick as to make the fly look like it is rising. That is my theory anyways.LOL These fish have such great colors. They even fight very well.  Good way to finish off and I  have a brain filled of what to have and watch on the water and hatch going on.  Thanks for reading my trial and errors and thanks again for the advice guys.  B   "
1063484,misfish,2020-06-21 14:46:00,29133,"When I arrived at 5 am,the fly hatch was amazing. I could see all these small fish hitting the flys on the surface. I even seen a few bigger fish,but could only manage about a  7 ,in this size range. All on my morning dun flys. Only took a pic of this one just to prove my own tie works . So many times I had a fish take and miss the fly right on landing in the water . That is crazy active feeding . Was a fun morning forsure, even if they were small.  There was a mix of flys. Large white ones and small.  Came upon a dead resident. Not sure how it got dragged up to the bank. That would of been a fun one to catch.  It would seem it is also turtle egg laying time. Came  upon this big lady.    And this one crossing the road path.  I have seen a few real big brutes in the water system. Just a short vid. Funny thing,they were really active til I clicked to make a vid.LOL If you watch close,you will see a decent fish move in the riffle. "
1063485,Terry,2020-06-21 14:53:00,14456,Looks like a good morning
1063487,John,2020-06-21 15:19:00,2956,What size are you tying there Brian? Over the years I had more hook up success tying very small.
1063489,Streamhound,2020-06-21 15:35:00,36,Many years ago I came across a pair of snappers that were as big as coffee tables on the south Saugeen river..
1063490,misfish,2020-06-21 15:41:00,29133,"Most are 14 John. I have been watching lots of you tube while I have been off. I can tie smaller no dought, but this seems to be a common size. Maybe my material needs to be less."
1063491,misfish,2020-06-21 15:41:00,29133,"In my younger years,I seen the same on the credit. MONSTERS."
1063492,John,2020-06-21 15:48:00,2956,I tied pretty much exclusively 16 and 18 for browns in smaller rivers and streams. Started off with 12 and 14 when I first started fly fishing and doubled my hookups when I when significantly smaller.
1063493,misfish,2020-06-21 15:51:00,29133,Thanks  I have to start some where and I know I will get better and be able to go smaller.  I need to get some dry fly powder as well.  Any recommendations ? I know Loon has a product. Thought maybe there was a generic source out there .
1063505,AKRISONER,2020-06-21 21:48:00,5558,"i personally use the loon oil, its pretty darn good. A drop every 20 casts or so. Keeps the flies dry to. You can blow the excess water off and keep it floating. Seems to not allow them to get saturated."
1063512,Gil Levesque,2020-06-22 09:42:00,103,"Brian,try going with less hackle,sizes to the hook! (1.5-2 times hook gape)Ive tied some 16s. Not fun for my old eyes. Ive also tied lots of klinkhammers in 14 and 16 lately. Parachute post are easy and the sighter really helps old eyes! Lol! Sure wish i had a river close by!    "
1063513,dave524,2020-06-22 10:32:00,4508,"Don't get hung up on that Dry Fly purist mentality, I caught more and better fish using simple wet flies , streamers and nymphs."
1063515,misfish,2020-06-22 11:12:00,29133,"I have tied a few with the post. My firsts. I would post,but they are in the truck. That post is a great visual for me as well. I split the thickness,but I think my next ones will have the full chunk. Also need to use thinner hackle for sure . Picking up some small hooks this morning. Rain day Tuesday,so lots of tying to do .  When they are taking bugs like they were yesterday Dave, I just stuck with the dry . I am taking baby steps, but my next outing I will have a drop with a small wet. One outing at a time ."
1063516,John,2020-06-22 11:47:00,2956,Don't worry about dressing that fly too much Brian. If it sinks so be it. I caught some of my best fish with a sinking dry fly.
1063559,misfish,2020-06-23 16:00:00,29133,"Well I went right to the #16 this morning . I have to say,it was fun . I have a mag lite,so it is very easy to tie once you have the basics down . Also they are time consuming,but it,s not like I am whipping up a wolley bugger.LOL Using thinner thread diameter is another learning curve for me. Cannot be hauling on that thread . Also making wings that small is gratifying to me. Now to go and give them a go . Might be a couple of days as we have rain now . I looked for a pencil with a eraser on it Gil, so it would show the true size. Not a one in the house. LOL      "
1063560,Terry,2020-06-23 16:02:00,14456,"Dang, they look good"
1063594,mamona,2020-06-24 14:49:00,597,Open Instagram account or something
1063631,John,2020-06-25 11:39:00,2956,Those are great looking flies Brian.
1063701,misfish,2020-06-28 15:44:00,29133,"Well down sizing sure made for more hook ups, ( Thanks John and Gil for the PM )but still small fish , but fun just the same. I did have a nice take and even got to see it turn, but got off. Met another new friend and some critters. LOL Arrived at 5 am and made my way up the river. Further then I have ever gone. Every time I go further,I find more great waters to fish. My biggest problem is my knees. They get sore now when walking this kind of terrain . I have come to take my time and take in all that is out there. Sometimes it,s a flower or what not, then there are those things that catch your eye and make you more intrigued with nature. I guess when you get older and slower,this happens.  I noticed a lot of flying going on in the air. Another hatch of a different fly. They looked like my spinner ties . Managed to get some what of a decent pic. Tried to get one to land on my hand by holding it out,but they had nothing to do with it. I do see though , when tiers say they make the tails longer then the hook shank. Pretty cool .   Worked my way back down working each spot.  Like I said,lots of small fish.  Seen this beaver twice. Think he wanted a friend .    Seen 2 caterpillars. One was taking a drink, the other was just sunning. Cool colors.    Lots of these on the rocks through out the water system .   Some of the great waters I fished this morning . I tried hellgrammites under a float in the deep pools, thought that would of been the ticket,but not. Still small fish. There has got to be a good fish that wants to play. LOL         "
1063702,Terry,2020-06-28 15:49:00,14456,Looks like a great way to spend a morning
1063703,John,2020-06-28 15:52:00,2956,Love these stretches Brian...Reminds me of water I used to fish for browns as a teen.  
1063704,misfish,2020-06-28 16:02:00,29133,I almost looked for a fresh worm John. Almost.LOL
1063708,Streamhound,2020-06-28 17:23:00,36,Fished the Grey Highlands Tues and Wednesday and also all small fish..biggest was 10 in.
1063709,dave524,2020-06-28 18:18:00,4508,"I've rarely seen a bow bigger than that in any great lakes trib after the spring spawning run,  that is about the size when they smolt and head for the big water, actually,  they do that about this time of year so probably most will be gone in a few weeks."
1063710,Streamhound,2020-06-28 18:30:00,36,Maybe I should of said Brookies... My bad
1063713,misfish,2020-06-28 19:48:00,29133,"I am way up this trib  Dave . I saw just the same as I seen last weekend .  Many small fish jumping and eating flys .There are some good residential  fish on this system , just have not yet  hooked up on one this year . Water was still cool, but warmer temps will keep me from heading back,unless we get some cool rains."
