I am trying to figure out how far we can get each day - but also to make sure we have a place to stay (Marina and/or hotel with docking).  Has anyone done this trip all the way to Trenton?  It appears if I am calculating correctly, that we can do it in 3 days (if there are no issues).  Day one the plan would be to get as far as Young's Point.  Day Two - to Campbellford.  Day 3 - to Kingston (have family there). Any tips, experiences, etc. would be greatly appreciated."

You may want to pad yoru schedule a bit to give some leeway ... and to allow time for a few casts here and there. Seriously --> buy the PORTS cruising guide to the Trent-Severn (see https://www.portsbooks.com/trent-severn-lake-simcoe/). It's the most detailed info you can get on where to stay, where to get fuel, where to find groceries and the LCBO, marina facilities, launch ramps, locks, distance between various things, and some useful fishing info if you read between the lines. Book is loaded with high resolution aerial photos and maps. Only $30 and absolutely worth its weight in gold."
