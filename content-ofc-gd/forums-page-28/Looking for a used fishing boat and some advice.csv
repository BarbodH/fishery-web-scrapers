Only issue I‚Äôm having is with the trolling motor but I think it‚Äôs because I have two different size batteries (one group 27 and one group 31) of different ages (one brand new one 3 years old) so I‚Äôll have to sort that out.

1062613,Hack_Fisherman,2020-05-31 13:52:00,720,"I'd be all over that. Floors are a big job and the nautolex is not cheap. He's put considerable time and money into this boat. In my¬†opinion, he's taking a loss. I'd make sure the owner didnt use pressure treated ply. Check the transom. If its soft, expect spending a weekend or two replacing it - easy if you're handy. I'd also look at the splashwell. Any cracks of the aluminum can indicate twisting. Also check the knee brace at the keel/transom for cracks. Check for pitting and corrosion at or under the waterline and¬†where you can see inside. If the hull looks good, the lower unit and compression test on the motor checked out, I'd grab this in a heartbeat. Edit; you probaly meant thoughts on using instead of mechanicals...disregard¬†if you're already in the know on this stuff."
1062637,FishFinder17,2020-06-01 06:59:00,139,Went to see it today. Waited 20 mins on the road while he showed it to another guy. Boat looked okay for its age but really the only nice thing about it was the floors. Then once the guy told me it leaks I lost all interest. Went and did some running around afterwards then headed home. While on the QEW I look to my right and there‚Äôs the boat I just looked at. The same guy came back and picked it up haha.

1062667,pics,2020-06-01 20:17:00,1268,I used to have the same boat with a 30 hp Yamaha and loved it.. when I saw a Sylvan recently in Windsor I was pretty sure that I was buying it if it was in as good of shape as the pictures indicated so I brought some cash and a money order and took it home right away..

1062384,FishFinder17,2020-05-27 12:57:00,139,"Hi folks, I‚Äôm in search of a new (to me) fishing boat for this season. I enjoy Lake O salmon fishing so had planned on buying a 23ft cruiser but with COVID I‚Äôm looking at something smaller...which is why I‚Äôm now looking for some advice. I‚Äôd like to have something 17ft or bigger that I can still tow with my V6 Jeep Cherokee. Ideally I would be able to mount a trolling motor to the bow and downriggers on the back. Would like to be able to hit smaller lakes for pike and muskie but also fish Lake O on her good days. Budget is $6500 max so I‚Äôm likely looking at something 15+ years old. What would the anglers here recommend? I have seen side consoles, centre consoles, and walk thrus but not sure what would be best. I have also owned nearly every brand of outboard at some point but curious what you might recommend for something that age? I have been covering Kijiji for over a month but is there anywhere else I should be looking? Any help would be appreciated. Also, if you have a boat for sale that fits the criteria above shoot me a pm. Thanks in advance, FF17"
1062386,AKRISONER,2020-05-27 13:32:00,5558,"you are going to be very hard pressed to find a boat that is big enough to do what you are thinking in that price range. I know you are saying 15+ years old...my boat is 22 years old and I could probably sell it no problem for $12,000 1st tip, get a boat that doesnt have a trolling motor or electronics or any other stuff on it if you can. You'll most likely ending up wanting to upgrade those things anyways and its just an excuse for the seller to jack up the price. I think i saved $1,000 immediately by telling the guy that sold me his boat that i didnt want his screens. I slowly outfitted mine over the course of the next year with what I actually wanted buying both my trolling motor and screens on the used market. From what it sounds like is you need a simple aluminum fishing boat. A side console would probably work well. The challenge is that you want something big enough to go on the great lakes and thats going to be really tough to find in that price range. If I were you Id be looking for something that needs TLC and invest hard work in order to save some money. The problem with that is that you are going to be kept off of the water working on the boat. Theres lots of boats with rotted out decks and carpet, and maybe some bad rivets with enough power to get out on the great lakes on the cheap.¬† The challenge then is going to be finding someone with a boat with enough power to get you out on the bigger lakes. My buddy has a 16 foot legend that actually fishes very nicely and it can do absolutely everything you are describing. Ive fished it on the right days on lake Ontario and bass fished in slop with it in the kawarthas, but the problem is that its got a 25 horse on it and it really struggles with two people in the boat. I would hate to see it on big water when things get nasty. My personal suggestion is find an old japanese two stroke from the 90's. Those motors are literally invincible and are actually very easy to work on should something be wrong. Recent looks at the used boat market incredibly tell me that the market has increased along with the price of everything else. For example a similar boat to mine seems to be going for at least 4-5 thousand more than when i bought it 3 years ago...ridiculous but I dont control the market. Im just glad i bloody bought my boat when I did! Good luck with your hunt!"
1062387,FishFinder17,2020-05-27 13:41:00,139,"Thanks AKRISONER, those are definitely good tips. The budget¬†is definitely tight which is why I‚Äôm looking for some advice. Im realizing if I¬†had $5k more I would have had a boat a month ago... I missed a good opportunity on an 19ft crestliner with a 2001 Yamaha 2 stroke 115. Seller wanted $5k and it went quick. You‚Äôre absolutely right about the prices going up. I was lucky to capitalize on that last fall when I sold my boat for $18k when I purchased for $11k two years earlier. I did some work on it so I‚Äôm not shy on finding something that needs TLC. when you say Japanese motors are you referring to only Yamaha or would that include Honda too?"
1062389,AKRISONER,2020-05-27 13:54:00,5558,"Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki Ive got a 93 honda, a 88 suzuki and a 98 yamaha and guess what...they all still run without issue...The suzuki's carb is finally starting to flood a bit after 32 years. I can get a new carb for it on ebay for $100...the bloody oil pump still works! That crestliner deal scares me...it seems too good to be true...The year of the motor is what scares me most In 2000-2001ish the EPA changed its regulations and basically all of the two stroke motor manufacturers changed over to direct oil injection two strokes to meet emissions standards. RIP to the smoke billowing carb two stroke. Those late 90's yamahas are stupid bulletproof. The proof is in the pudding, go down to mexico or cuba and every single boat is running one. the early 2000's¬†is basically when 2 stroke outboards turned to ticking time bombs. The manufacturers didnt have the oil delivery on the direct injection¬†dialed in and hence you dont¬†see as¬†many early 2000 two stroke engines around because a heck of a lot of them blew up. The proof is in the fact that Yamaha just completely bailed out on making two stroke motors. The VMax went four stroke and the rest is history. Im sure plenty of folks around here will say my opinion on the matter is Bull because they have one that runs, but my bone stock 98 yamaha on my skeeter I think has had the valve cover gaskets changed and then Ive obviously changed the impeller since I bought it. The thing fires like its brand new and hardly blows any amount of smoke, part of that is also the oil I use but the motor runs as good as new.¬†There is definitely something to be said for that! "
