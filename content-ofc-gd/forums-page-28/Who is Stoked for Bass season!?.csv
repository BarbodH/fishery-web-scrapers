Were 10 days out! Where are you fishing on opener? Ill be on the tri-lakes hopefully flippin up some llamas!
1063067,Paudash,2020-06-10 22:43:00,273,"Still 3 weeks for me but can’t wait,  boat is ready so I will pick it up tomorrow for a test run"
1063077,Pigeontroller,2020-06-11 02:41:00,2793,Always enjoy Bass opener on Erie if the weather cooperates! lol 
1063125,BillM,2020-06-12 04:57:00,17367,Got my GBay milk run ready.  Always a good time out there.
1063131,Garnet,2020-06-12 12:20:00,2056,These last 2 years have been fabulous most run off chase bass and I keep pounding on the wally's. 
1063139,AKRISONER,2020-06-12 13:49:00,5558,"you can bare to wait the extra week! You're nuts Bill! Tradition for me, but a little different due to covid. We have a family and friends derby on the tri lakes I do that for the weekend and then the following weekend I take the entire week off and crush G bay for a week straight. The fishing is quite literally world class in every sense of the word. You want to throw the lure, you will get bit with size. Large or smallmouth, its going off! Might be a little different this year than the past few with opener being a week later, its crazy to watch the transition happen during opener week from basically freshly off the bed but still shallow to post spawn. Top water smallmouth in <4fow. oh budddyy  "
1063141,OhioFisherman,2020-06-12 13:54:00,6623,"I wish, probably could have fished a couple tournaments here already."
1063146,David Chong,2020-06-12 14:41:00,836,"Can't come soon enough, been looking forward to it for quite a while!"
1063167,boombap,2020-06-13 02:13:00,310,Kayaking the kawarthas instead of a boat this opener.. cant wait
1063168,dave524,2020-06-13 09:14:00,4508,"Seeing it is the last season to open, I find it somewhat anti-climatic,  but then,   I really don't like them on the table so I don't target them often."
1063199,BillM,2020-06-13 21:55:00,17367,Bass opener is always 4th Sat in June    I'll muskie/'pike fish before that.   Bass aren't going anywhere.
