Today he caught a 7-8 pound Bowfin. He caught it all by himself, I'm surprised the line didn't snap! Got a good picture of it flipping out of our hands. He managed to catch some sunfish, rockbass, bass, perch, Bowfin, and 2 gobies today which we killed.     "

1063834,Bill,2020-07-03 01:03:00,140,Great catch for the young lad
1063860,Garfisher,2020-07-03 22:36:00,229,If you hold them upside down they'll go into a tonic state and not thrash about haha
1063861,LefroyFisherman,2020-07-03 23:36:00,602,Interesting
1063883,David Chong,2020-07-06 01:30:00,836,Did your hands go green?
1063884,LefroyFisherman,2020-07-06 01:38:00,602,"Nope, is that a thing? Because of the spawning I guess."
1063886,David Chong,2020-07-06 11:35:00,836,"Yes, I've had  the fluorescent green on their underside come off on my carpet in the past. Really weird!"
1063892,lew,2020-07-06 17:44:00,12766,"The smile on the little guys face tells the whole story !! I never caught a bowfin, infact don't think I've ever even seen one but they sure look like they could give you a real tussle."
1063893,misfish,2020-07-06 18:40:00,29133,"I,ll bet he was real excited to fight that one . Have a caught a few while flipp,n for bass . They hit hard and fight like crazy. You think you got a mother of a bucket on, til their head comes up and ya say,well you know.LOL "
1063894,LefroyFisherman,2020-07-06 18:48:00,602,"Oh ya it was a good fight, I’ve never caught one either lol! His rod was bent over like crazy."
1063896,AKRISONER,2020-07-06 20:35:00,5558,Buggers always make me think I’ve got a PB largemouth on lol. They eat frogs too and cut 40lb braid like a bugger!
1063910,OhioFisherman,2020-07-07 12:07:00,6623,"We used to catch them once in awhile were Akri is located, they seemed to average around 4=6 pounds, they get much bigger though, one of my friends got one pushing 20 pounds there."
