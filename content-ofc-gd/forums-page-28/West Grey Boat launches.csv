Might just be leisurely boat ride with the wife. Can anyone give me some info on where to launch on the lakes up there? I don't have any particular lake in mind...the ones I have heard of by name include Arran, Rosalind, Louise, Williams, McCullough, Wilder...but it really doesn't matter. If you have a suggestion I would be happy to hear it."
