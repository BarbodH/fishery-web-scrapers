1062998,KraTToR,2020-06-09 14:16:00,506,I'm assuming things are pretty hot down at the west end.  Waiting for the hot bite to move east to Leamington...  Every day was a limit day last year.

1063019,porkpie,2020-06-10 01:26:00,2521,"Fished Glasgow today.  We had to work hard.  Very few marks, some bait.  Did best in 35 fow.  8 in the box plus a bow.  Tough bite, lots of knock offs on riggers And blew several fish, several rips on the boards resulting in lost fish, dropped 3 at the net, and changed rigs all day just to produce what we did.  It was a good day of fishing as we actually had to work for em.  Biggest came in  at 8lbs.  It was not the usual hot fishing that you’d see there in a few weeks, but it was definitely worth it for our first Erie shake down this year.  Whackum purple redfins put the majority in the boat.  Good luck!"
1063227,KraTToR,2020-06-14 20:56:00,506,Thanks everyone! I've always found bigger fish in the eastern basin.. Nice one!  How many did you boat that day? 
1063228,misfish,2020-06-14 20:59:00,29133,Do they work on a fly rod ? LOL
