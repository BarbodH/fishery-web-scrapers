1063855,misfish,2020-07-03 18:57:00,29133,LOL  More then you know pal.  We got out once in awhile.
1063866,Scott S,2020-07-04 15:57:00,203,Haven't fished there in a couple of years. Lots of traffic in the summer with cottagers!! Still get the odd walleye(not like the good ol days when you went to camp!!) Â Pike and Bass and yes sunfish. They put a artificial lung in the deepest spot on the lake to help the oxygen levels about 10 years ago maybe longer?? Was my favourite lake growing up!! Speerzy
