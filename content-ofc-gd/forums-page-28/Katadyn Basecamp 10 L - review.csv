The seals in my MSR pump are on the fritz, and it takes for ever to get a few litres of water.  Id much rather be jigging then pumping water!!!  Thanks for the review man.  Much appreciated. "
1063814,gordy28,2020-07-02 13:31:00,638,Hey - awesome - glad to provide a useful service! 
1063816,Jon,2020-07-02 15:55:00,209,"I have an older MSR gravity filter, which was a replacement for an even older hand pump system. It is a great filter and I assume pretty similar to the one here. One small disadvantage is that the water in the reservoir warms up during the day whereas with a pump, you may get cooler water if your intake is a bit deeper than the water's surface. I would buy another gravity filter in a heartbeat rather than one of the hand pump ones. Here is the filter I have - MSR Water Filter  Jon"
1063862,pics,2020-07-04 04:08:00,1268,I have an MSR pump as well as a platypus drip filter and the pump is definitely more work but certainly manageable for 2 people.  While both produce safe water I find that with the MSR it is clearer and better tasting...
1063898,Dutch01,2020-07-06 22:45:00,1431,I have the Platypus GravityWorks and I like it. Easy to use and I've never used one before. They make a 4L I think (I have a 2L). Bonus: when your first filter is up you can put a Sawyer filter inline with this system which is cheaper than the Platypus filter. I have no affiliation with Platypus and I haven't used any others to have much frame of reference.
