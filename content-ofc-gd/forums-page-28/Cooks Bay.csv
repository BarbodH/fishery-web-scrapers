1063336,300,2020-06-17 21:12:00,16,"Hello. Iâ€™ve never fished cooks bay. Want to go sometime this summer for bass fishing with my son. Thereâ€™s a launch at Gilford I believe. Iâ€™ve goggled bass fishing apparently good at south end around pads and weeds. Not looking for spots, but is it good bass fishing. Thank you"
1063341,Terry,2020-06-17 21:29:00,14456,The gilford launch is residents only. So if you donâ€™t live in Innisfil you will need to launch at a marina. Â  Â  It isÂ Â possible that it could change Â but for now no
1063344,300,2020-06-17 21:35:00,16,Ok. I just googled Cooks bay Marina. Â  Â  Anything you can tell me about Cooks bay. Thank you
1063352,misfish,2020-06-17 22:20:00,29133,"I would tell you all his ""HOT"" spots,but he has none,,,,,,,,,,"
1063353,300,2020-06-17 22:27:00,16,Lol. Not looking for hot spots. Just asking if itâ€™s good bass fishing there. Thanks
1063354,misfish,2020-06-17 22:31:00,29133,"Hit the mouth of the river. You will see many others doing the same. As for the bay it,s self,you need to know the area. Look for weed edges on drops.. Crank baits and senkos work best."
1063831,300,2020-07-02 23:39:00,16,Well itâ€™s time on cooks bay with all the other boats. My son caught a couple

1063835,300,2020-07-03 01:12:00,16,Thanks. Might go back again. Lol. Not on opening day thou
1063871,captpierre,2020-07-05 13:18:00,2521,Those largies are decent but Simcoe is famous for its tank smallies. 4-5 lb not uncommon. They run in schools around sholes and islands at the top of Cooks Bay and elsewhereÂ Â on Simcoe. Find one you usually find more. Google it. Thereâ€™s lots of info out there.
1063872,bushart,2020-07-05 13:43:00,2628,I hate when the fish interrupt my sandwichÂ ðŸ˜ƒ
