562172,pidge,2011-03-15 23:56:00,438,"Long story short, anyone needing some parts for there Porta-Bote should get ahold of Patrica thru this link http://www.ontarioportableboats.com/home.html Picked up a new transom for $140.00 today. Not bad I figure considering the cost of a new boat. Anywho just wanted to say dealing with thses people was painless and a good transaction. Very satisified here"
562173,Terry,2011-03-16 00:00:00,14456,is it a plastic or wood transom....   I love my Portabote
562174,irishfield,2011-03-16 00:02:00,26272,"Good to hear they're good to deal with.. but that's an expensive piece of 3/4"" plywood.  Now that you have a new one.. reinforce it with a piece of 1"" x 1"" x 0.125 alum angle. It will make the world of difference and your transom board won't warp when parked in the sun with the motor up.    This one's Terry's.. he had to have the drink holders...  "
562196,pidge,2011-03-16 00:49:00,438,Its the plastic one guys. Its a Genises IV. Mines got the cup holders as well   Cant wait to put on the used Nissan 5hp I bought back in November.
562199,irishfield,2011-03-16 00:52:00,26272,"But it's still a wooden transom board.. no? Terry's is wood, or I've lost my beans... and his is a Genesis IV. I sold it to him.  Just recruised their site and I see they're now using a moulded transom. Since you have that one... did you forget it somewhere??"
562205,pidge,2011-03-16 01:14:00,438,"You know what Irish, I bought the boat a few years back on here from a member and it came with the plastic one. Wheather its the origional or not?????? I've seen one other in person and it to had the plastic transom. No I didnt leave it somewhere, it actually cracked. Hard to explain, but I dont know my own strenght  The hand tighteners on motors, well I overtightened it a wee bit with my old electric motor. Its hard to picture and explain, but theres a ridge along the top. Well the motor screw thingies are supose to sit under it. Well I split the difference and made a mess of it. Lesson learned."
562208,d_paluch,2011-03-16 01:17:00,343,"IF anyone here is interested in selling there porta-bote, I would be more than willing to take it off their hands  Until then, my rubber dinghy will do!"
562211,irishfield,2011-03-16 01:19:00,26272,"That's too bad pilge... if you do it again.. make a wooden one ! Never had issue with mine and it's still going strong, as far as I know, after over a decade."
562287,pidge,2011-03-16 04:07:00,438,"Cool will keep it in mind Irish. ""Paluch"" keep checkin KIJIJI or Craigslist"
562309,Terry,2011-03-16 09:04:00,14456,yup..mine is wood
562314,solopaddler,2011-03-16 09:55:00,8605,"I had one very briefly, then sold it.  Hated the thing. Very uncomfortable to fish out of, at least for me.  Only real reason I can see to own one is if you own an atv or use it to fly in with.  For my purposes a squareback canoe is much better."
562361,Terry,2011-03-16 13:37:00,14456,I find it just as good and comfortable as any 12.6ft boat and twice as stable but yes I had mounting brackets on my atv and it was great I had it out in 4 ft waves on simcoe on Jan 1 a few years ago and would never even consider doing that with a canoe
562403,pidge,2011-03-16 16:20:00,438,"hopefully this works guys. Its a pic from a google serch and I really suck at computers. Theres the ""lip"" I was talking about (TOP)and the bottom piece has been reenforced apparently since 07 model year??? You can kinda see the new ""C"" channel theve put in place. http://sv-timemachine.net/images/0706/transom.jpg"
1063403,Tom,2020-06-19 01:38:00,10,"I bought from a yard sale a new porta bote genesis iv boat still boxed. When i opened it i found out i was missing transum, bow cover and seats. Where can i get these pieces or does anybody want to buy what i have. New boat 2 wheels a seat and some other pieces that were also in a box .thanks for your help .  "
1063407,Terry,2020-06-19 01:48:00,14456,You can contact the company and ask  Porta-bote 
1063408,Tom,2020-06-19 01:59:00,10,I did they told me they dont support the gensis iv with parts any more and i should contact this site for help or to sell what i have Maybe i just didnt take all of the boxes anyway hrre i am lol
1063411,Terry,2020-06-19 09:51:00,14456,So it would be hard to get parts what do you want for the parts you have
1063417,Tom,2020-06-19 11:37:00,10,I did they told me they dont support the gensis iv with parts any more and i should contact this site for help or to sell what i have Maybe i just didnt take all of the boxes anyway hrre i am lol. Make me an offer i have the boat . 2 wheels 1 seat and some other stuff that came in the boxes
1063419,Terry,2020-06-19 11:46:00,14456,Problem is if we can’t get parts it ain’t worth much. If we can get parts it’s worth a lot
1063420,Tom,2020-06-19 12:46:00,10,"I figured i. An make a transum and seats out of solid oak or plywood the question is do i want to spend the time now that im pissed off at myself.... lol what do you think i could get for what i have. The boat has to be the largest part of the value, what do you think"
1063421,Tom,2020-06-19 12:48:00,10,
1063440,irishfield,2020-06-19 23:58:00,26272,"You'll need to make the seat braces also and you could use door hinges. Seats are just 5/8"" plywood with foam on top.        "
1063441,Tom,2020-06-20 01:12:00,10,Thank you but i think im just going to sell what i have
1063445,woodenboater,2020-06-20 13:06:00,2277,"doesn't look like too much work to make seats and a transom tbh. No idea what you paid, so no idea if you will take a hair cut selling what you have. What Wayne said about the seats and transom tells me it's worth the work. Otherwise you're back to square one. good luck whatever you do"
