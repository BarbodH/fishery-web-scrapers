1063732,Dave A,2020-06-29 16:02:00,34,"Due to the power demands of today's electronics and the use of multiple sonar units, many of us run a house battery as well as an electronics battery. Is there a single gauge available (2""-2-1/2"" dia.) that monitors voltage for 2 batteries? Due to space limitation, this would be a great gauge to have. So, in short, I'm looking for 1 gauge with two volt scales on it."
