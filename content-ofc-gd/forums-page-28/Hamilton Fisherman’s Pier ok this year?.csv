1063873,Raycaster,2020-07-05 13:57:00,528,Just looking for a easy launch to get on Lake O for some trolling. Could launch from Hamilton Bayfront but my boats not the quickest and paying boat ramp fees is probably worth it. I saw  Fifty Point mentioned but bad reviews? ($$$). I have launched from under the skyway before with friends in past years. I’d rather stay on the Hamilton side instead of Burlington. Only have a 16ft so have to pick the days with the weather network. Going out next week with daughter and gladly will accept any hints for trolling success. Grabbed a salmon last week in 100ft of water off Fifty Point last week with a friend. Thx ahead.

If the pass still includes launches it works out pretty cheap."
1063899,Fish Farmer,2020-07-06 23:01:00,2234,$135.00 now for senior pass with launch sticker 50 PT. I think it's $25.00 for day pass.
