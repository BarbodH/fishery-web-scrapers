1063844,misfish,2020-07-03 14:40:00,29133,That is cool . Well kinda. LOL  
1063847,OhioFisherman,2020-07-03 15:33:00,6623,I remember living in Avon Lake about 1/2 mile from Lake Erie and trying to get into my condo without letting 100's of them or midges in at the same time.
1063848,kickingfrog,2020-07-03 16:32:00,8333,Would a caddis hatch be more likely?
1063857,AKRISONER,2020-07-03 20:39:00,5558,"Big time hatch up here in PAB  turned the smallies right off for a day, the couple we caught were puking them up by the bunches"
1063863,dave524,2020-07-04 10:44:00,4508,I recall the Port Dover fire dept had to bring out the pumper truck years ago to wash down the hill out of town so cars could get up it was so slick from squished bodies.
1063864,OhioFisherman,2020-07-04 12:59:00,6623,"Kick, I have heard of those, but from the pics I saw when I looked them up? no, just Mayflies. Dave, Port Clinton by the Erie Islands on this side of the lake has to do things like that. Scott, one year we went to PAB and they were all over, rafts of them floating on the water and fish rolling on them all over. It might have been real close to the bass opener or 4th of July, usually went up mid July to early August and then again in September for a guy trip. That year the fishing was tough, what ever was eating Mayflies seemed to be getting eaten by bigger fish. "
