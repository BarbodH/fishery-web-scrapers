1060054,irishfield,2020-04-16 21:29:00,26272,"Everything ""public"" is cancelled from now 'till NEXT Fall. No concerts, no fishing tourneys, no car shows.. even Moparfest has already cancelled this years event in Kitchener."
1060064,Old Ironmaker,2020-04-16 23:45:00,8243,And I thought I was going to see a thread telling of someone's death. Tragedy is a word to describe something a bit more serious than cancelling a fishing derby. Even those that are going to lose big money that the event generates I would say it is sad but tragic it is not.

Pretty sure youâ€™ve got it figured out at this point. This is supposed to be a friendly post. But I thought I should clarify, JustÂ on the off chance That your dementia is acting up, rather than your dyslexia....you know Iâ€™m ribbing ya. Love your posts."

1060422,AKRISONER,2020-04-21 16:58:00,5558,"lots of hope that some restrictions will be lifted by July...i kind of personally believe that the July long weekend is the governments target for restriction reduction. I do however not forsee the large gathering restriction being lifted for perhaps a year or maybe even more. Depending on the size of your bass club, I think this may be a bit of a pipe dream. if the weigh in involves a crowd of over 50 people, not much hope! Ive personally given up hope on any chance of fishing tournaments this year. Im simply continuing to pray that i will be able to launch my boat and fish bass at all!"
1060487,LeXXington,2020-04-21 23:37:00,1928,When they state that its COV-19.Â  I don't think its all about the virus.Â Â  There is a large shortfall of sponsors for a number of events or sponsors backing out.
