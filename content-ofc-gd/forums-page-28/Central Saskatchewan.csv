1063902,bigugli,2020-07-07 00:37:00,6138,"Finally, a worthy fishing report. As a gift for my birthday, The family paid to fly me out to the prairies for a 10 day fishing trip. What a fantastic time with my family. Then there was the fishing. Never hit the water for more than 4-5 hours each day, yet we were catching 50-120 fish per session. The tactics were simple. Baitholders with leeches, and our worm harnesses tipped with worm, leech or minnow.¬† Minnow and ball jigs , with a sickle hook or casting jigs tipped with twisters or paddle tales. The fish were insane. Walleye out there were fighters, not dead weight.¬† Pike were a lot thicker across the back as compared to pike in southern Ontario. Did not manage any trophy pike, but we landed a lot of solid ones in the 30-36"" range. Managed to land¬†a lot of 25-28"" walleye         "
