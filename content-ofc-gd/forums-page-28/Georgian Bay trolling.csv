1063468,porkpie,2020-06-21 01:21:00,2521,"I fish further west than that,  but here is some general info that will help you on the bay.  Fish early.  People showing up and launching at 7am, and getting rods in the water late have missed the best fishing.  I launch in the dark.  Fish long leads, and run much lighter rigs than your standard salmon fare.  That's all I got for you, I can't help you with Collingwood area, but my understanding is those guys start to do better around August, but I really can't say.  Good luck!"
