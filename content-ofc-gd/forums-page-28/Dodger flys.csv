Buddy said I should tie some on a siwash hooks for behind dodgers for salmon trolling. So i did and wait to hear back how they work. The green and black one has a trailer hook. It stuck me like 6 X tying the front hook.ðŸ˜‚ Hooks I used are super sharp and strong         The trailer one. I call it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  I BITE BACK     "
1063562,Terry,2020-06-23 16:27:00,14456,Dude they are great where do I place my order lol
1063563,BillM,2020-06-23 17:13:00,17367,Even tying those behind a Williams would be killer.Â  Â Early season laker killer!
1063564,dave524,2020-06-23 17:20:00,4508,"I'd tie them with a second hook facing up as a stinger , dodger fly was the hot setup 40+ years ago when Lake Ontario was Coho fishery. Blue zone ( but that name evolved later ) 20 feet down,Â  Red Luhr Jensen dodger blue Jonsfly , six feet behind the ball ,Â  Cohoes all summer until they stacked up at the mouths."
1063565,misfish,2020-06-23 17:29:00,29133,"Thats what I did. That,s why I got stuck so many times. LOL"
1063566,misfish,2020-06-23 17:31:00,29133,That is what I was thinking when I made the 1st 3 . I even told him they were coho baits. Thanks Dave  
1063567,misfish,2020-06-23 17:38:00,29133,"Elaborate Bill please,,,,,,,,  You mean tie a treble up for the spoon, or for a trailer behind it ? The spoon would act as a mini dodger ? I can visually see that working .  EDIT Making a trailer in a shiner/herring pattern would work I am sure . Food for thought. Will have to keep my eye open for those old William spoons. The large ones."
1063598,dave524,2020-06-24 16:33:00,4508,Even used a wooly worm fly a foot or so behind a hookless Williams for trolling spring Specs.
1063602,BillM,2020-06-24 18:04:00,17367,"Yup, I've used it a few time.  Brian, yeah.Â  The Williams basically becomes the dodger in this case.Â  Â Remove the hook , run a lead and tie on that fly."
1063604,misfish,2020-06-24 18:56:00,29133,"Thanks Bill for the reply  Guess I got to make a few for Terry now. LOL  PayPal or direct cash in hand WITH COVID proof gloves, woks for me. LMAO ðŸ¤£"
1063606,Terry,2020-06-24 19:16:00,14456,Dang  lol
1063610,misfish,2020-06-24 20:14:00,29133,"Tomorrows project buddy,  What else am I going to do at 4 am ??????????"
1063673,John,2020-06-26 23:35:00,2956,They are the cats behind Brian. If I get back the fishing bug I will look you up!ðŸ™‚
