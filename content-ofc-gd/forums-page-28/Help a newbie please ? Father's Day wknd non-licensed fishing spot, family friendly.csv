We would like to go tomorrow, as Father's Day weekend is open to non-licensed fishing. 2 adults.  3 teens. No boat. Oshawa / Durham region area suggestions please ?"
1063463,Woodsman,2020-06-20 21:46:00,1286,Sorry not from the area. Have you seen people fishing other places?
1063464,HOWsMom,2020-06-20 22:25:00,3,"Mostly in the Oshawa Creek, but it is often guys with wading gear (hip waders?). We would like to just fish from shore or a dock-type, especially for our first time out. I hope that makes sense."
1063466,Kawartha Kev,2020-06-20 23:35:00,281,Not sure what you mean by non licensed fishing? Sorry didn't remember fathers day weekend was free .
