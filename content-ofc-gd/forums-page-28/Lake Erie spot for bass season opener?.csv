Bass season opener is around the corner and I was wondering where some good spots would be this time of year for bass. Any help will do! I’m still very new to Erie. Ive fished Tecumseh reed in late August into September last year and had some solid ones from there but wondering where they hang out during the bass opener time?  thanks in advance guys!"
1063310,BillM,2020-06-17 13:40:00,17367,Shallow.   Long bomber casts with spybaits would be the first thing I toss for Erie bass come opener.
1063312,OhioFisherman,2020-06-17 15:07:00,6623,"A lot of people from this side of the lake make the run over to PeLee island, any rocky protected from pounding waves. "
1063313,GaraldT,2020-06-17 15:57:00,52,Thank you!
1063314,GaraldT,2020-06-17 15:57:00,52,thanks for the advice. Anything closer to the Burlington hamilton area?
1063315,grimsbylander,2020-06-17 16:05:00,3016,"The entire shoreline from Tecumseh to the Niagara River has both quantity and quality of fish. Pick a launch and go. Use basic knowledge of structure fishing to locate fish. Start shallow and work deep...you'll find them. Once you find fish, it's rinse and repeat; work that depth and follow the contour. You don't need to ask for specific spots. Good luck! "
1063321,GaraldT,2020-06-17 17:37:00,52,Awesome appreciate the help. Would Tecumseh reef itself be good this time of year?  thanks again
1063322,grimsbylander,2020-06-17 17:57:00,3016,"Absolutely. There are resident fish everywhere along the north side of the lake. It’s true there is a migration that happens in the fall whereas fish stack up on particular pieces of structure, however, that’s a long way off and for now, the typical summer pattern is in place."

1063328,Old Ironmaker,2020-06-17 20:11:00,8243, ooops
1063340,GaraldT,2020-06-17 21:26:00,52,"Haha thanks as usual Old Ironmaker. if you had to chose long point vs tecumseh reef around this time, what would you chose?"
1063400,Old Ironmaker,2020-06-19 01:23:00,8243,Believe it or not neither. I have fished Long Point Bay for Largemouth a few times over the years but have never fished Tecumseh. There are so many Smallie locations post spawn no need to fish that reef this time of year. It is usually fished hard in the late summer and Fall. I tell everyone that asks is to launch at Hoovers Marina heading  east and work the shoreline of Peacock. It is ALL good fishable waters. I can tell you where it's up to you to do the how.
1063430,GaraldT,2020-06-19 16:59:00,52,Awesome. Appreciate all the help!
1063433,Old Ironmaker,2020-06-19 18:08:00,8243,"Best of luck to you GeraldT. 4th Saturday in June can never get here too early. I won't be fishing from the boat, but will toss some hardware from the shore. My fishing partners wife is flipping out about this coved thing as they have 3 little grand babies and is afraid my buddy is going to get the virus from me I guess if we fish together. It seems all my old fishin' pals are too old to go out fishing in the boat, so they say. Maybe they just don't want to go in the boat with me!!!! I know my wife won't fish with me anymore. We got caught in a storm here on Erie and it was touchy to say the least and promised The Lord if we didn't drown she will never go out on this lake again. Look at your wind and weather reports 1st thing that Saturday AM. Things can change rapidly on this lake. I use sailflow.com and windfinder.com plus our official Canadian Marine weather site. This might help all. Heed weather forecasts, closely, please. It seems when ever winds are up on the day of Bass opener we get search aircraft from Trenton here, we don't want that. https://weather.gc.ca/marine/forecast_e.html?mapID=11&siteID=07503"
