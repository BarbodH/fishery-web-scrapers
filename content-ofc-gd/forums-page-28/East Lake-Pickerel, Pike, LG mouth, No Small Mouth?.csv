I've caught a decent amount of Pickerel (no size), lots of Pike (no size), and lots of Large mouth (decent size, not targeting), and don't understand why I haven't caught a single Small mouth. I've mainly been casting a twister tail, and Little Chloe. Any thoughts on the lack of Small Mouth???  Cheers!  "

1063429,Rizzo,2020-06-19 15:11:00,4754,"Love that lake. Spent a week there every summer with my grandparents when I was growing up. Stayed at Martin's Outlet Park or Log Cabin Point. Probably went for 10 years in a row? This is during late 70's into the 80's. Crap I am getting old. Wish I could remember better...we did catch a lot of fish, but can't seem to recall smallies. And just like you said, good quantity but no real lunkers. One time got around a 10lb pike but all the others were typical snotrockets"
