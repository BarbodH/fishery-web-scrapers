1052421,bigcreekdad,2019-11-14 13:52:00,546,My dog went berserk barking when I listened to it.
1052432,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-14 17:05:00,10439,It's obviously aÂ chupacabra!!!!

1052465,Gil Levesque,2019-11-14 22:18:00,103,Ok guys and girls I'll tell u what this sound is! It's my ex howling when she didn't get half my pension!!!!! Lmao!!
1052466,irishfield,2019-11-14 22:49:00,26272,"That'd makeÂ  you crap your pants? Ever heard Fox pupsÂ at night, now that'll make you sit up and take notice. They sound like some prehistoric pterodactyl"
1052467,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-14 23:21:00,10439,No but I've heard a large grizzly bear sniffing at the side of my tent!!!Â Â ðŸ˜® That's a real sphincter tightener!!!!

1052505,NAW,2019-11-15 18:21:00,4022,"I just listened to the video again with my head phone cranked up.  Originally, I thought it was the baby noise you where talking about.Â  Cuz that sounds like a rabbit in distress.Â Â Â But now that I have herd that demonic sound in the back ground, I am confused. My guess would be a wolf or dog as mentioned earlier.  Creepy noise that's for sure.  I used to have a pile of fishers in my bush, and they would make some hair raising sounds.Â  But nothing that deep.  It's a big K9 or sasquash..Â  Gotta be. "
1052515,LostAnotherOne,2019-11-15 19:04:00,956,You should write a book one day Drifter. Write everything from grizzly bears outside your tent lol to building your new home.
1052541,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-15 21:11:00,10439, Has happened more than once. Had a full growed moose run right past my tent one night too!!!!
1052553,brkygetr,2019-11-16 02:01:00,425,"Well I knew if I logged in their would be some discussion on this! I can honestly say I have no clue, however I know one thing for sure... if its not a hoax whatever it is has a lot of lungs. Now I know full well how sound can travel in the bush and be completely distorted either sounding way further away or much closer than it actually is.. if I had to guess I would say that is travelling from a bush line out over an old swamp/beaver meadow and then echoing through the trees. as to what it is...well my best guess would be a bull moose (on the roar side of things) but the first few seconds definitelyÂ  sound wolf howl like."

1052853,SirCranksalot,2019-11-21 04:11:00,3291,Ouch---painful to imagine!! 
1052856,cisco,2019-11-21 04:37:00,597,Right time of year for a lost deer dog. They come in all shapes and sizes from beagles to elk hounds. Also it may be caught in a leg snare or some such thing. I have seen the aftermath of a few bears caught in illegal snares and they must have gone through an awful painful death.
1052329,TJQ,2019-11-12 22:29:00,7806,Ive been in the bush my whole life... Id crap my pants and run!!  LOL

1052332,wkrp,2019-11-12 22:51:00,656,That is definetly a Guzorce.
1052333,OhioFisherman,2019-11-12 23:06:00,6623,A space alien!
1052334,misfish,2019-11-13 00:10:00,29133,"Sounds like a hound that has got lost from it,s hunting party."

1052339,T-Bone,2019-11-13 01:52:00,160,My dog just heard a whisper of it and started barking in a very protective way. My guess would be a wolf with a bad boy howl. I wouldnâ€™t be around to find out though thatâ€™s for sure.
1052348,Whitespinnerbait,2019-11-13 10:18:00,2038,A Hoax
1052351,Gil Levesque,2019-11-13 11:55:00,103,Heard the same sound last week deer hunting. A fox yowling is my guess!
1052353,NAW,2019-11-13 12:34:00,4022,"Some little critter.Â  Maybe a young rabbit or fox of yearling deer whimpering?  I do some coyote hunting, and my electronic call has several distress calls that sound similar to that.Â  Some sort of distress call."
1052370,outllaw,2019-11-13 16:34:00,1232,wolf.
1052373,MJIG,2019-11-13 16:37:00,227,My guess would be aÂ vixen. 
1052380,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-13 17:30:00,8243,"And a waste of 14 minutes of my life. But I FF'd to 13 minutes and still wasted 2 mins of my life. I truly believe there are things in the woods we shouldn't mess with, not this time, the guy needs acting lessons. Why would anyone set a camera up to tape him moving firewood? Come on Man! We went into the woods andÂ  came across 2 Coyotes when we took my 2 baby nieces for a walk before dinner here on Thanksgiving Day. Don't go into the woods with little soft tasty appetizers in tow. ."
1052386,T-Bone,2019-11-13 17:46:00,160,The clip is only a little over 2 minutes long.
1052390,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-13 17:59:00,10439,Maybe he's still on dial up and it took that long to load the video!!!!!
1052391,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-13 18:01:00,8243,"No not dial up, come on Man, we are in the sticks, we have smoke signals. The link brought me to U Tube and that was 14 mins long."
1052393,TJQ,2019-11-13 18:05:00,7806,If its for real... thats a possibility!!!
1052397,lew,2019-11-13 20:02:00,12766,"Probably 45 years ago my Dad and I were camping east of Algonquin Park in November during the deer hunt. One day we heard a hound howling off in the distance and then heard it again thru the night, again the next day & then on the 2nd evening while we were sitting around the campfire she came outta the bush and walked up to us. Guess she was cold and wanted to be near the fire. The poor pooch was starving so we fed her a good supper and then she slept in the tent with us. Thru the night she was making some weird noises so I got my flashlight and realized she was giving birth toÂ a pup.Â  Turns out the pup was dead so I took it outside and buried it. The dog was going crazy and dug it up so I buried it again and put a big rock on it. Anyways, the dog had a tag on her collar with a phone #Â so we called the owner in Ottawa. He said they'd lost the dog a week ago so we gave him directions to our camp and he showed up in the afternoon and picked up his pooch. Don't know if that's what's in the video TJ but a lost dog is sure a possibility"
1052406,Rich Clemens,2019-11-13 23:48:00,3131,I don't see the bird ??????
1052407,Rizzo,2019-11-14 01:32:00,4754,that there is some Blair Witch Project noises...so...hoax
1052409,Mad Scientist,2019-11-14 01:51:00,4,I think it is a lynx. They can make some very strange sounds and one of their sounds is described as sounding like a baby crying.
