1052185,cheaptackle,2019-11-10 14:39:00,849,Out of 10 separate orders 9 were complete rip offs.  Won't ever try them again and heavily recommend to anyone to stay away from them.  Michael
1051854,SirCranksalot,2019-11-02 01:32:00,3291,I get promos from them for deals that seem too good to be true---also with 'orig price' unbelievably high.Has anybody at all used them or heard of them?  thx
1051855,grt1,2019-11-02 02:36:00,638,"my wife has ordered from them. she ordered a blouse and when it came it was too small, so she called them and they arranged for a new one to be shipped,, just the other day one of the guys at coffee told me that his bank called and said they had a charge of over 400 dollars on his visa from wish, he didin't make any purchase so the bank is checking into it. that would be enough to scare me ofany purchase."
1051856,BillM,2019-11-02 08:02:00,17367,"It's basically AliExpress.  All goods from China.  If you're good with that, then go for it."
1051858,dave524,2019-11-02 11:01:00,4508,No different than shopping at Dollarama or CTC's own brands.
1051861,bobowski,2019-11-02 12:46:00,360,I have ordered a few things from them. You get what you pay for. Don't expect good quality stuff and be patient as the orders usually take weeks to arrive. Also make sure you look at the shipping costs. Some times the shipping cost will exceed the cost of the product on small items.
1051866,SirCranksalot,2019-11-02 13:49:00,3291,thx guys---I don't think I have ever ordered from Ali. I have ordered a few cheap items from China with free shipping---e.g.a fish bite alarm for about $5 delivered!! May have been Ali
1051869,Big Cliff,2019-11-02 16:08:00,6899,I have looked at a few things on there but wasn't impressed with the quality. I do order a few things from China through Ebay and Ali and have never had any problems.
1051875,irishfield,2019-11-02 16:56:00,26272,No matter how you wear it.. it won't look like the gals in the pictures!
1051888,GBW,2019-11-02 20:04:00,8460,I have a few thing's coming from Wish such as lures and sunglasses and small crap.  I will not order clothing due to size issues as stated above. I can let you know how I make out with my items if you like.
1051894,dave524,2019-11-02 20:37:00,4508,"I got one of these for my shortwave radio hobby from China on EBay, $45 US cost me $60 Canuck and got it in 12 days, everyone says they work as good as the 3-4 C note similar items made in the US and I concur. The screen shot is me receiving and decoding a weather fax from New Orleans on my software defined radio.    https://www.ebay.ca/itm/MLA-30-100kHz-30MHz-Ring-Active-Receive-Antenna-Low-Noise-Medium-ShortWave/283557477378?hash=item420557bc02:g:Au4AAOSwOPldNsST "
1051898,OhioFisherman,2019-11-02 21:36:00,6623,"I have ordered from Ali and Ebay, never tried Wish and really have no particular reason to. With Ali the stuff I ordered was usually dirt cheap, and with the free shipping a lot of them offer makes the price way better than most places stateside that have a minimum order to get free shipping. Quality? some of the things I ordered weren't bad, but you really can't expect to pay 4 bucks for 100 hooks and get Trokar or Gammi quality?"
1051905,Big Cliff,2019-11-02 22:11:00,6899,"I ordered a whole new cylinder and piston for my son in laws chainsaw, complete kit was $63.00, took about 3 weeks but that same kit here would have cost almost $300.00. The quality was just as good as the one I could have got here."
1051916,chris.brock,2019-11-03 03:17:00,4053,"I've used wish a fair bit, and would never order something like that though it's Chinese junk, it's a gamble, it's kinda like a dollar store but with way more stuff"
1051921,Big Cliff,2019-11-03 08:58:00,6899,"I didn't use Wish for it, I ordered it through EBay. As for the quality; that was 5 years ago and the saw is still running fine and he cuts a lot of wood."
1051922,dave524,2019-11-03 10:00:00,4508,"My wife does a lot of various crafting, she uses Amazon prime, usually here next day, a LOT CHEAPER than Michael's. "
1051923,GBW,2019-11-03 12:18:00,8460,I use Amazon too as I share a Prime account with 3 others and yes shipping tends to be very quick and free due to paying for the prime account.  You still need to be price smart when shopping online vs real store fronts.  Not often but most of the time the prices between the two are close in price.
1052014,OhioFisherman,2019-11-05 15:15:00,6623,"When you buy off any of those sites ebay included you have to look at the feedback of the seller and or comments, but that is probably true with any online purchase. Ali charges you to use paypal, their alipay is free. "
1052015,limeyangler,2019-11-05 15:26:00,5204,"I don't have an issue with the goods being from China, I have an issue withe goods 'coming' from China, the shipping can take MONTHS!"
1052049,SirCranksalot,2019-11-06 00:58:00,3291,"Here's 1 reason why I distrust that site----might be a good bargain, but 6 grand????????? "
1052057,OhioFisherman,2019-11-06 13:08:00,6623,"I have tracked some of the stuff I have ordered, it can reach the states and then seems to take weeks clearing customs, but on some they do seem to take a while getting out of their country."
1052076,GBW,2019-11-07 00:43:00,8460,I ordered this for my bike Oct 20 and got it today yet the delivery date is Nov 18 and I paid less too.  I paid $35.44 after item and shipping.  Holding the item now and it looks well made too. *added* I just installed this in 1 min and a great fit too!  Happy with my purchase here. 
1052080,misfish,2019-11-07 11:14:00,29133,Nice  What the $%&^$ are they for ? LOL
1052083,Big Cliff,2019-11-07 12:26:00,6899,"I suspect the original price might be in Chinese yuan, it converts at .19 CDN  which would seem much more reasionable"
1052086,NAW,2019-11-07 14:22:00,4022,"We where just talking about them in my office this morning.  No good reviews from the guys here who have used it.  One guys wife bought a ring and a lap top bag.  Slid the ring on her finger, and it broke in half.  Put the laptop in the bag and lifted it up, and the bottom fell out of the bag and laptop smashed on the ground...     They vowed never to buy from wish again after that!"
1052091,GBW,2019-11-07 21:54:00,8460,It goes through the rear axle on my bike so a universal rear wheel stand can lift the back wheel up off the ground for servicing the Yammy...
