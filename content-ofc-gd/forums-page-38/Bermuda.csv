I recently saw an article about bone fishing in Bermuda. I realize this is a bit outside Ontario waters, but has anyone gone to and fished in Bermuda?"
1052422,bigcreekdad,2019-11-14 13:53:00,546,Guess not
1052425,mamona,2019-11-14 14:19:00,597,I am interested as well.
1052439,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-14 17:54:00,10439,Fish the triangle!!! You never know what yer gonna get!!!¬†üòÅ
1052489,Big Cliff,2019-11-15 14:23:00,6899,Sorry I can't help you with the fishing there (but I'd love to go). Wouldn't the recent devastation there be cause for concern? I would be a bit worried about the availability of facilities at least until they have had a chance to rebuild.
1052491,dave524,2019-11-15 14:33:00,4508,Wasn't that the Bahamas ?
1052501,Duckie,2019-11-15 17:24:00,305,"i fished there while on vacation years ago, i caught barracuda, trumpet fish casting rattle traps off the rocks around the beaches (eg. at John Smith Bay). i used a 3 piece travel rod, 12 pound mono and a steel leader,  We also used squid on the bottom and caught many kinds of saltwater fish¬†(like wrasses) There are bonefish in Harrington Sound. I didn't see or catch any but if you go on youtube there are videos..  I have caught bonefish on jigs off the beach in Nassau Bahamas though (in front of Sandals while on honeymoon)"
1052528,Big Cliff,2019-11-15 20:04:00,6899,"The Bahamas got it really bad but Bermuda took a pretty good hit too from what I understand, trees down, roofs blown off, flooding. It may be fine now but I think I'd want to be sure before I planned a trip there this soon."
1052530,zenon11,2019-11-15 20:11:00,75,"Never fished, but have been there before. It‚Äôs not as warm as Bahamas, so if you‚Äôre looking for similar fishing you might be disappointed"
