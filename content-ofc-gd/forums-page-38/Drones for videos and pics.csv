1052675,captpierre,2019-11-18 02:49:00,2521,Looking at drones for the first time. Looks like good ones start at $1000. Â Are the ones under $100 worth considering for pics and videoÂ at the cottage?
1052676,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-18 03:13:00,10439,I have a DJI Spark but it has been discontinued. Works great and gets great pics and video. It's replacement is the brand new Mavic Mini which is even better and priced right @ $460 CAD. It's also under the 250gm limit so you don't need to license it. https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/collection/dji-mavic-mini/262138   
1052677,captpierre,2019-11-18 03:20:00,2521,Looks good. Thanks. Didnt know about the 250 g issue.
1052680,Yellow Fever,2019-11-18 11:54:00,139,"As Drifter said get the mini, my buddy has the Mavic ( not sure of the model but it was $1200.) The problem is since we fish near an airport there is a 5 minute tutorial he has to go over everytime he fires it up. New regs helped me change my mind, they are fun though."
1052689,Jon,2019-11-18 14:54:00,209,"I too have a Spark, which was a great drone until it got a little wet. The Mavic Mini looks like a better value and the sub-250g is an added bonus. Get the Fly More combo - you'll appreciate the extra batteries immediately."
1052702,limeyangler,2019-11-18 19:41:00,5204,"Yup, I have not used my Mavic Pro since they decided to practically crimiNalize drones over 250g. I intend to jump through all the hoops to fly legally, but what a load of Bull for someone living in the wilderness, I agree with the restrictions around airports etc, but holy man, way to kill the fun out of using your drone!"
1052722,irishfield,2019-11-18 22:38:00,26272,"I've taken one out with my wing, one a float tip and another skipped off my windshield.. I have no use for them...."
1052723,Fisherman,2019-11-18 22:48:00,7201,That's serious stuff
1052727,Terry,2019-11-18 23:07:00,14456,I had two of them hit me  before I learnt how to control it
1052729,irishfield,2019-11-18 23:11:00,26272,It's almost become a competition with me and the local charter base to see how many we can hit!Â That and we have guys flying R/C float planes in the channel between us and the Provincial Park.. that is also illegal !
1052731,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-18 23:17:00,10439,Mount a .22 gatling gun on your plane.
1052732,Fisherman,2019-11-18 23:22:00,7201,"Yes that's highly illegal, those guys are probably not charter club members that would frown on that practice.Â  There's other puddles they can infest."
1052750,DanD,2019-11-19 12:35:00,2223,"Licensing for new ""toys"" has been around since almost forever. It was only after the novelty of driving aÂ car became the norm; that in 1927Â a driver needed an operators driver's license. Back in 1909 theyÂ needed a chauffeurs license, ifÂ driving was your means of making a living. (Truck drivers) So a device like a drone that can be a safety or a privacy issue; is for sureÂ going to have legislation and licensing towards their uses. Dan."
1052759,limeyangler,2019-11-19 15:41:00,5204,"Absolutely, good points. I think the privacy issue is interesting. So many of the complaints I hear from people about their privacy being invaded by a drone make me scratch my head though (no, I don't have fleas). Personally I don't have any interest in filming people, they are boring....lol.....but understand that others could and would you a drone for that purpose. Having said that, we are voluntarily giving away our private/personal info daily (Facebook, web browsing, loyalty cards, credit cards, algorithms that now what i'm thinking before I do and post ads accordingly on this platform) cctv is everywhere, everyone has a phone with a camera and can take pictures and video of anyone and anything in an instant, a drone flying across my bay is the last of my worries....lol."
1052760,Rattletrap2,2019-11-19 16:42:00,1652,"Yes, the limit is 250 grams and the new Mavic Mini is 249 grams!ðŸ˜š I also have the Spark. DJI is the way to go for sure."
1052761,Rattletrap2,2019-11-19 16:47:00,1652,"Agreed Simon! Other than shots of family at gatherings and such, I have no interest in video of people! I can see why flying one over a crowd of strangers can present a problem though. Privacy and also the liability should the thing crash."
1052767,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-19 18:02:00,10439,"Regulations also state you mustÂ not fly within 75m of people, vehicles etc."
1052782,chris.brock,2019-11-19 21:12:00,4053,"I have DJI phantom 3, they are about $600, it's not the latest and greatest but it's still DJI quality and amazing technology"
