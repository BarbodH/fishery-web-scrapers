1051929,Canuck,2019-11-03 14:42:00,491,Saw this on another forum. http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/wildlife-home/post/ohio-wildlife-council-approves-3rd-fishing-line-for-lake-erie-ohio-river As long as they don't increase the limits it won't impact anything.Â  I don't know why they don't allow 2 rods per person on Georgian Bay except that it is a way to have limits that are very hard to reach.Â  If would be nice to have a 2 rod rule on G-Bay.
1051939,OhioFisherman,2019-11-03 15:59:00,6623,"I have seen comments here on some of our local state boards with people wanting a return to the 10 fish limit for Walleye on Lake Erie, it's just my opinion it is a bad plan, better to try and keep the population stable and make some wiggle room for years that may have a poor spawn? Never fished the Ohio River and the club I was in used to schedule a bass tournament there once in a while, noted for smaller bass from what I saw in club results, just a long way for me to drive to catch bass I would cull on other waters here.

1051953,Yellow Fever,2019-11-04 11:30:00,139,I fish Erie and will never fish more than 6 rods regardless of how many in the boat. I could see a big mess o lines
1051995,muskybw,2019-11-05 00:30:00,116,start building bigger planer boards & longer tow lines ? WOW.
1052009,dave524,2019-11-05 11:34:00,4508,"Spend more time fighting tackle than fish, for what ? getting your limit in 2 hours rather than 3Â ðŸ¤£"
1052012,OhioFisherman,2019-11-05 15:04:00,6623,"LOL, after the repeated claims I see here about the Walleye fishing being the best ever I do wonder about the need for a third rod? I don't know how the charter captains work, are you done for the day once your charter has limit of legal size fish? It might allow them to book 2 charters a day?"
1052055,Yellow Fever,2019-11-06 12:05:00,139,Those large charter boats allready cut a 300 foot swath through the pack.
