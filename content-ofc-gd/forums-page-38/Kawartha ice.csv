1052549,captpierre,2019-11-15 23:33:00,2521,Took a ride to the cottage. Scugog is frozen as far as the eye can see from the causeway. Chemong is partly frozen. South Pigeon is frozen. North Pigeon is ice free. Gannon Narrows wide open. Cold and big winds tonight. Forecast for next 2 weeks is more moderate temps Â but still a bit below normal.
