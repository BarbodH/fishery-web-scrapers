1052182,Terry,2019-11-10 14:10:00,14456,I am sure he is smart enough to know that i had to measure the forward movement of front and back wheels with the tracks on the back so I could calculate the size of tires I needed to match the forward movement of both it was the first thing I considered when I started to built it   
1052183,Terry,2019-11-10 14:12:00,14456,t
1052186,Woodsman,2019-11-10 14:59:00,1286,Terry I don't see chains on the front so it will allow for some slippage.
1052187,Woodsman,2019-11-10 15:05:00,1286,Also chains on a Sidekick's front wheels could easily cause clearance issues and illegal to use on public roads. Chaining up every time you hit the ice would be a pain. 
1052188,Terry,2019-11-10 15:07:00,14456,Don’t need chains but don’t worry about slippage front and back are matched but I run on pavement 16km to get on the ice at big bay point and I run in 4x4 because the tracks push me very straight on pavement so I need power to the front wheels to steer.  No slippage there
1052189,SirCranksalot,2019-11-10 15:10:00,3291,If I were you I wouldn't look down either!!😁😆😝
1052191,Woodsman,2019-11-10 15:12:00,1286,Terry a track set up like yours won't fit a Sidekicker without removing a lot of bodywork. Matching drive ratios will be more difficult.
1052192,Terry,2019-11-10 15:19:00,14456,"could be but you are thinking up all these problems (without knowing his design plan) , i have seen some of the things he has built and I believe he know the math to make it all work"
1052194,Woodsman,2019-11-10 15:28:00,1286,I'm sure it can be made to work but it won't be easy. To make it work could also bring up some legal issues.
1052195,Terry,2019-11-10 15:46:00,14456,I think a sidekick is small enough to register as a ORV so would have no issue if it’s older then 2001 it doesn’t need the dot ORV compliance sticker
1052198,Woodsman,2019-11-10 17:14:00,1286,Yes it could be registered as an ORV. Finding insurance would be difficult and as an ORV it would not be legal on the roads. Trailering it to the lake would be a pain.
1052199,Terry,2019-11-10 17:20:00,14456,"I never thought for a second that he would not be trailering insuring a ORV isn’t hard and is legal any where a atv is legal to drive ,if it meets the ORV standards or is older then 2001  i think I will wait and see if he wants to share his  plans for this thing "
1052203,Woodsman,2019-11-10 18:11:00,1286,A modified street legal vehicle to an ORV will not be legal on the roadways. The HTA is quite specific on what ORV's vehicles can use the roadways. And insurance for a modified vehicle will be quite hard to find. Yes I would also like to see his plans. Can it be done? Yes but it may turn into a far bigger/more expensive project than expected. Keeping it street legal would be an easier option. And it would be a magnet for any LEO to checkout for proper registration and insurance. 
1052208,DanD,2019-11-10 20:29:00,2223,"Well guys I too always did and some what still do have respect for Tim Hale's operation; used them many many times. Never had a complain and if I were to rent a hut from him; I would still likley not have a complaint. He's a good operator. That being said he also dislikes ""weekend worriers that think we can infringe of ""HIS"" fishing grounds"" not my words his! Wish I had taken a picture or two of my location compared to his; like I said I was an 1/8 of a mile or more away from him or any other huts. How far is far enough away? It was after the CO put him in his place; that the buzzing of or hut began. I know what Tim Hale's bombardies look like and I'm sorry; but Hale and his crew do not have hailows. As for the Sidekick. I have already locked (welded the spider gears) in both the front & rear diferentials. Now looking at ways of locking and unlocking the tranfercase as needed. If that becomes an issue I'lll leave the T-case alone. Add an ajustable proporsioning valve to the rear brake system. This will allow me to lower the pressure applied to the rear brakes; allowing the front brakes to apply with greater force percentage wise. The T-case in turn will send the power to the rear wheels/tracks. I'm not talking of standing on the brake peddel; but just enough to send applied power into the T-case and then to the rear drive wheels. It will never see the road again; yes an ugly trailer queen. LOL Already checked into registering it as an off road rebuilt vehicle and getting an off road plate; no issues. As for equired off road insurance my broker said it would be the same rate as the quod and to call him when I'm ready to insure it Thanks for your comments and concerns on my other post and another chance of explaining my interaction with a well known good operator. I guess he just doesn't like my aftershave or the lack of? LOL Dan."
1051864,bobowski,2019-11-02 13:00:00,360,Who's starting to get excited for ice fishing season? I know the itch has started for me.
1051865,limeyangler,2019-11-02 13:43:00,5204,"Another avid hardwater angler here. Not long now. Boat is put away last week but I still got out yesterday from shore. Makes me laugh, people in town always asking if I'm sad fishing season is over, there is no such thing as fishing season being over except for the 2 weeks it takes from first ice to safe ice.  "
1051867,porkpie,2019-11-02 15:28:00,2521,"I like to do a bit of perch fishing and I just booked a couple of days on nippising, but truth be told I’d rather be in my boat or on a riverbank these days, although I ice fished a lot when I was younger."
1051868,Big Cliff,2019-11-02 16:05:00,6899,"Sitting in a nice warm hut on Simco, a pot of chicken noodle soup simmering on the stove, a big bag of home made jerky and those beautiful big Simco perch hammering your line....... come on hard water 😊"
1051870,misfish,2019-11-02 16:18:00,29133,"HAHAHAHAHA I just put the toon away this morning, brought out the ice gear. Flipped the hut open to wax the poles. I started day dreaming. Oh and put 300 lbs in the back of the truck box for weight. Plenty of river stuff to do til then. I have another 9 day adventure planned in 2 weeks. Then it,s whitiefest."
1051889,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-02 20:06:00,10439,"We may well have safe ice by next weekend here. We already have ice, just needs to thicken up some.    Gettin' frosty this week.  😁  "
1051890,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-02 20:09:00,10439,"I finally put the boat away, pulled out the sled and gassed up the snowblower this morning."

1051928,Beans,2019-11-03 14:37:00,3339,I used to be an avid ice fishing addict but poor health has me shorebound....my boys rent a pontoon boat and I manage getting on and off  that and am good for about 4 hours fishing from it but the rest of the time it is shorefishing.... I have given up ice fishing but enjoy living vicariously through your adventures... Keep 'em comin'

1052123,captpierre,2019-11-08 21:05:00,2521,I haven’t caught this disease yet. Not sure I want to but as retirement looms might have  to
1052124,DanD,2019-11-08 22:06:00,2223,"Can't wait to get back out on the perch grounds of lake Simcoe; out off of Beaverton. I like planting my hut somewhere between Georgina Island and Thorah Island.  Last year I got crap from Tim Hale; saying I was to close to his rental huts. I was at least an 1/8 of a mile away, on the other side of the main trail? He tried telling me that my hut was causing his huts to flood? LOL  OK. Your huts are 2-300 feet apart, mines an 1/8 of a mile away; how is it that I'm the cause of your huts flooding? He couldn't give me an answer. LOL Ministry (CO) showed up while Tim and I were having our conversation that was starting to get heated. The CO more or less told Tim to go pound salt; he didn't own the lake and if I wanted I could place my hut right up to but not against one of his.  I did eventually move my hut. Mr. Hale (going well out of his way) kept buzzing around my hut with his bombardiers. So I guess he's not going to be a friend of mine? LOL My hut is big and heavy and the 700cc quad has all it can do to pull it on clear ice. That's why I'm going to put together a half track system on the rear wheels of a Suzuki Sidekick and chains on the front wheels. 98hp and about another 900lbs of weight should allow me to move the hut much easier. I never go out unless I see the the operators out there with their Bombardiers; so I should be OK; staying on marked trails?  So if you see a navy blue hut out there with a Canadian flag on the door; stop in and say hi. Dan. "
1052127,Sinker,2019-11-08 22:58:00,8692,"That is odd behavior for Tim. Are you sure it was actually Tim, or one of his staff? Maybe on of Floyd Hales guys? Tim has been nothing but great to me and many I know. That seems odd. Not saying its not true, just really out of character for him and his crew. Im out that way often. If ever any problems, get in touch.  S."
1052130,misfish,2019-11-08 23:28:00,29133,"There were reports of huts getting buzzed  last year on another site. I too, do not believe Tim would do this. Been out there to many years to be pulling that crap, and with the WWW he knows word spreads fast."
1052131,misfish,2019-11-08 23:32:00,29133,BTW The steam was rising off the bay this morning real good. Might be an early freeze up.  Jan 1st works for me.
1052132,lew,2019-11-08 23:44:00,12766,"I never became a fan of ice fishing, just something I never took an interest in. My Grandparents had a water front home on Simcoe for years and had a hut that I think I used once and my brother had a waterfront home on Scugog with a hut also that I used once. Went out with the boys from this site a few times but again no interest. Staring down a hole in the ice all day just never became my thing I spose."
1052133,Fisherman,2019-11-09 00:15:00,7201,Noted that some of the shallow bays on couch by highway #11 were frozen early this morning and still on the way back around 1030.
1052134,misfish,2019-11-09 00:23:00,29133,"Lew  I like the early morning shift. Real early shift. On ice at 6 am, off by 9-10 am. I try not to look down the hole. Scares the fish away. Just watch the screen, drink coffee and catch a few fish. LOL  What are you saying ? Hell is going to freeze over ? Did you get some brown fur this morning ?"
1052136,Fisherman,2019-11-09 01:18:00,7201,"Don't know about hell freezing over any time soon according to the blond waffle twat that climate minister.  No, no brown fur, we went up to check cameras at a buddies place just past Gravenhurst, 2 tracks and some dink stole one of the portable blinds.  Nothing is sacred anymore.   Most of the gravel pits on #90 were frozen over and then I just about crap when I saw the bays frozen over on couchiching,  maybe an early ice season for a change."
1052138,porkpie,2019-11-09 03:57:00,2521,"I can tell you I’ve been buzzed by a Floyd Hales bomber.  He had to go out of his way and off his track to do it and passed way too close to my portable, and I was nowhere near his huts."
1052140,Big Cliff,2019-11-09 09:10:00,6899,"I would be very disappointed if it was Tim! Tim, Kim,  and their crew have always been top notch with me and any of my friends. Sounds more like something Floyd would do."

1052148,Fisherman,2019-11-09 17:28:00,7201,You just keep that up there and make good use of it.
1052181,Woodsman,2019-11-10 13:58:00,1286,Not sure if that set-up will work too good. The tracks most likely  will have a different drive ratio slower than the front wheels. With the front wheels engaged they will be turning faster then the tracks and will spin and put a lot of stress on the drivetrain. Also steering will be compromised.
