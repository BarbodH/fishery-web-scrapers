1052157,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-09 18:24:00,8243,"I have always wanted to get an old glass cruiser cut the top off and use it as a deck on the shore. Plenty of ideas and time, no energy any longer."
1052164,misfish,2019-11-09 22:47:00,29133,That is what cash and deck hands are for. LOL
1052167,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-10 00:14:00,8243,"And a big bag full of cash Bri. We are sitting at a bar in Miami Beach one night many years ago. A boat pulls up. A nice big boat. A crew of about 4 or 5 guys come down the ramp and reboard with their arms with bag fulls of food. It was a nice boat from what we could see. As it pulled away only then did we see the Pete Fountain off shore hanging off a davit arm and a helicopter at the rear. It was a small helicopter. Sometimes a bag of cash ain't enough. I bet there are folks here much happier than the guy that owned it was. No I don't bet I know. edit: of course I have a story or 2 about deck hands. One is aboutÂ  a few scantily clad deck hands that danced in the Ballet in their off hours on a fishing charter out of St. Kitts that isn't for prime time viewing or reading. I wasn't always a crippled up 65 year old crimongeon , and happily married. "
