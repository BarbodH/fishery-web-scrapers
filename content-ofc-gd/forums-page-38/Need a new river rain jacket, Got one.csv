1052200,misfish,2019-11-10 17:29:00,29133,"Well there was no rain to test, but there was certainlyÂ  wind ,and I will say, with the hood up and secured, it was very nice to have something that kept me warm and comfortable . -0 high +3. I even fooled a couple of the regulars standing out in the pool. Usually I have my camo coat on and hat. I was bundled up, and they had no idea it was me . That was until I lit up a stogy. They complimented me on my new purchase. They were impressed with the quality. This coming from decked out Simms guys."
1051558,misfish,2019-10-27 16:22:00,29133,"Heading out this morning, I grabbed my Viking rain jacket to wear . Well it was ok for the first hour, then it started to allow water in. I sure do like those Simms jackets and know they are probly the best, but they are dear in price. Would really like one,but is there others out there that compare and maybe half the price ?  Managed a couple of quick ones this morning.    "

1051572,SirCranksalot,2019-10-27 19:03:00,3291,Why not just reg a reg rubber lined rain coat----the kind that commercial fishers use. That 'breathability' stuff is way overblown IMO(And get yerself a Sou'Wester to keep the rain off you neck!! 
1051580,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-27 22:34:00,10439,I've got a Simms jacket and have never worn a drier jacket than it. Yes they cost a few bucks but they are worth the $$$ IMHO.
1051592,porkpie,2019-10-28 00:58:00,2521,"Iâ€™m in the same boat. Â Everything leaking from waders to my jacket. Â I patched waders Â for the last time, and i DWRâ€™d my goretex for probably the last time. Â Looks like itâ€™ll be an expensive Xmas. Â Again.... I canâ€™t complain, did pretty well on the last bargain bin pair of Simms waders and my coat has given more than can be expected of a coat. Â Iâ€™ll be watching this thread. Â But sadly I donâ€™t think cheap lasts very long. Â Best way to do it is watch for a clearout sale on last years model of a brand name. Thatâ€™s what I did last time."
1051601,Garnet,2019-10-28 10:16:00,2056,I check the 50% off area at Sail regular. Was aÂ couple nice Columbia coats at Oshawa.  
1051602,Yellow Fever,2019-10-28 10:49:00,139,"Just buy the Simms, you wont regret it. Only money. I was on a $5000.00 fly in trip to the BC coast ( free trip) and in the dry room one of the other guests was raving about my Simms suit. I figured he could afford one but he kept going on about mine. Are the Simms waders not under warranty? I would shoot them a note before you buy new"
1051604,mitch seguin,2019-10-28 10:57:00,98,"I have a Simms G4 that has a few years on it.Â  The original was returned due to material defect.Â  The second jacket has been good but is showing signs of wear.Â  I did purchase a Patagonia River Salt jacket a few years ago and IMO this jacket is superior to the Simms.Â  As for the cost, Patagonia has a fall and a spring sale where this jacket may be on sale and if so it is for 40% off regular price."
1051612,bigcreekdad,2019-10-28 12:51:00,546,"I had a Simms Guide Jacket for about 5 years or so. StartedÂ to have problems with the zipper. I contacted Simms to see if they could put a new zipper in. They had me send them the jacket.Two weeks later, I received from them a brand new. No questions asked re: my original purchase. I'm sure I was out of warranty. I also have their lightweight rain jacket, and a 10 year old set of stocking foot waders...still no leaks. Compare that with the sets of Orvis boot foot waders I go through every two years. Go Simms...pricey, but very high quality, and absurdly good customer service. BTW, when I'm in my boat and it's going to be a soaker day, I wear my waders under the Guide Vest. Completely dry, and no more waterÂ down the butt crack. "
1051616,Lape0019,2019-10-28 13:01:00,647,I have a BPS 100MPH jacket and my buddy has cabelas guideware. Both are more affordable than the Simms and keep us dry. But the Simms seems to be a bit more flexible. I recently bought a Gore-Tex ski jacket at Sail for $275 (Spyder) that is lightly insulated and it has worked great on my last two outings as well.
1051652,gordy28,2019-10-28 22:59:00,638,"I have a Bass Pro Pro Qualifier rain suit I really like it, comfortable, lots of pockets and keeps me dry.Â  I have fished all day in a heavy downpour in it on our fly in trips and not had any leaks If you watch the BPS flyer they usually go on sale a few times a year Cheers Gordy "

Problem with the BPS or Cabela'sÂ is they're too long for wading. 
1051776,misfish,2019-10-31 10:58:00,29133,Hey I like that . Will look into this more. Need to know what their policy is about returning if it does not fit right. Thanks pal
1051797,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-31 15:32:00,10439,I find them too bulky as well. Much better suited to boat fishing than wading.
1051805,J Roelofsen,2019-10-31 20:47:00,84,I've got an LL bean pro shell wading jacket I've been wearing for 10yrs or so. Every bit as good as Simms ðŸ˜‰ and better designed IMO. Their Emerger jacket is very nice for the price.. Josh
1052149,misfish,2019-11-09 17:38:00,29133,"First off, thanks to all you guys for your input. Yes the Simms is a great jacket. I tried a couple on this morning at Sails, and tried to convince myself to pay the big ticket item price, but I just couldn't pull the trigger. Headed over to BPS and they had limited selection, but the FroggTogg Pilot II was just as nice fitting and at 1/2 the price of a cheaper Simms . I was comfortable with making this purchase. Got X-large so I can layer up under it. The neoprene cuffs are a nice fit,lots of pocket space, nice tight waist band and well, I am happy to have a life time warranty jacket and the 5 star report made it for me . Now to put it to the test.    "
