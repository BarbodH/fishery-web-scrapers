1052586,misfish,2019-11-16 19:08:00,29133,Water Wolf is the original if I am not mistaken. https://www.waterwolfhd.com/
1052587,fisherman7,2019-11-16 19:24:00,325,Does anyone use one that has a live view? 
1052593,captpierre,2019-11-16 20:51:00,2521,I’m thinking an underwater camera would be useful for the type of fishing I do most. Humps and weededges.  But this one doesn’t look around. Only towards lure
1052609,Terry,2019-11-17 00:20:00,14456,I too have the water wolf and it does work well but I think the gofish has wireless monitor abilities
1052613,Terry,2019-11-17 01:12:00,14456,Well that sucks was thinking of buying one
