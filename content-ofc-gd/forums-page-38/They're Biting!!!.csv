1052335,misfish,2019-11-13 00:29:00,29133,He needs a snowdog for all that gear.  Right Terry ? LOL Thanks for the pump up for ice fishing Dave.
1052336,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-13 01:08:00,10439,Luckily there's only an inch of snow or dragging that thing would kill a fella!!!! Should be sled safe by the weekend.
