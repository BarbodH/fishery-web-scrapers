1051908,ketchenany,2019-11-03 00:31:00,3229,"been looking at that Cliff. they said  they were trying to vent the gasses and fell through the roof. I read one comment, at 680 news “why were they on the roof”. Can’t believe people who comment and have no facts as to why! Hope it all  works out well for them."
