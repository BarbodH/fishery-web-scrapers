1051833,woodenboater,2019-11-01 17:09:00,2277,Weather was pouring pretty good last night but still got more kids at the door than I thought would show up. Have lots of Old Dutch chips and soooo many Oh Henry and mini Reeses pieces to polish off. Wonder how trick or treating will go in Montreal tonight lolol
1051834,lew,2019-11-01 17:28:00,12766,There's no kids on my road so no Trick or Treating either so all candy in this house belongs to me LOL
1051835,muskybw,2019-11-01 17:30:00,116,lol.  we ate 3 boxes of the mini bars ( 50 a box ) the last 2 weeks !  had to go out yesterday morning to get goodies for last night ????
1051838,bigugli,2019-11-01 17:52:00,6138,We had lots of kids and no leftover candy.
1051840,porkpie,2019-11-01 18:49:00,2521,I had 8 mini bars last night before I stopped myself in disgust.  The extras are going in to work.
1051841,DanD,2019-11-01 19:52:00,2223,"We had a far amount of kids last night. Shut it down around 8:30; when the kids looked like their 5 O'clock shadow was a dark as mine. LOL The remaining candy (Other then a few of my favorites) went to a woman's shelter; here in London. A lot of the families there are not comfortable to go out at night.  We've done this a lot the last few years; with different items. Last Labour day, I cooked (Using my spit) for a sick kids hospital fund raiser pig roast. (We raised $4500.00 that day; between the roast and silent auction.) what a great day! The remaining unopened salads (Potato, Mac and Coleslaw) were all brought to a woman's shelter. That's my wife's doing; very proud of her! Dan "

Bad place for trick or treating here, no street lights and homes and driveways are a good distance apart, and a 55 mph speed limit and no sidewalks makes safety a serious issue."
