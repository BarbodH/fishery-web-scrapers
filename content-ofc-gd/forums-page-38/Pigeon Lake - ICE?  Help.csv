1052578,LostAnotherOne,2019-11-16 18:48:00,956,Give Smith and Sons bait store a call.  They may be able to help you.
1052583,Tjames09,2019-11-16 19:03:00,664,"Not sure how the north end is, but the southern end of all kawartha lakes ive seen are frozen as far as I can see. Sturgeon, pigeon, chemong, and scugog. It was -15*c last night, it made a lot of ice."
1052589,fisherman7,2019-11-16 19:25:00,325,Upper Buckhorn is pretty much frozen.
1052595,Rizzo,2019-11-16 20:58:00,4754,gross. Hope to get out one more time before season closes. Gonna need some warmer weather for that to happen. Even down on st c the water is 32.5 my buddy tells me who went yesterday
1052602,captpierre,2019-11-16 21:27:00,2521,My guess frozen unless there’s significant current
1052605,misfish,2019-11-16 22:48:00,29133,"Weather here next week is -2/3 over night, +3/6  day time highs for the week. Picked a great week to be off on the river Rog.  Hope you get out atleast 1or2 more times bud."
1052629,captpierre,2019-11-17 14:20:00,2521,Looks locked up 
1052636,Sinker,2019-11-17 16:02:00,8692,You could probably launch in bobcaygeon.
