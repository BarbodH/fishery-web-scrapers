1052218,captpierre,2019-11-11 13:55:00,2521,Iâ€™ve been cheating 
1052226,Fisherman,2019-11-11 16:47:00,7201,"Yup, tried fuel stabilizer once and found it made big globs of a jello like substance in the bottom of the gas can.Â  No ethanol regular can still be found in certain areas, and seafoam."
1052229,BillM,2019-11-11 17:35:00,17367,Don't let you boat sit with the same tank of fuel in it for 6 months.Â  I've never had issues running ethanol fuel.Â  A slash of Startron here and there and before it's gone for winter is all I ever do.
1052231,AKRISONER,2019-11-11 18:59:00,5558,canadian tire premium and Shell Premium are both ethanol free. I run nothing but shell v power in my outboard and snowmobiles now.
1052251,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-11 22:51:00,8243,"We didn't get the bottom of the boat wet this year and hardly last year, maybe 2 trips. I only filled it once in spring of 17'. I didn't go through that fuel in 2017. So I have a 1/2 tank of fuel from 2 years ago. I will pump it all out before I even think about turning the key. The carbs should be dry when winterized in fall of 17'. I use Shell premium and still put in Seafoam and or 2 plus 4. Many boat Guru's call Seafoam is fake tune up in a bottle and say it's a waste of money. We never think we are going to have 2 year old fuel in our barges because we plan on using it. Sometimes plans don't work out like we would like. I broke my back the end of 16'. I brought in my kicker tank to the county hazardous goods recycle day in Sept. They said they need to keep the tank. I don't think so, now I have to find some old cheap red containers to dump it into. I think I paid around 75 bucks for the low profile tank with gas gauge. What do they do with all the gas cans/portable tanks they keep? They should have an exchange set up. Sad to say but I know where some fuel ends up and lots of it."
1052271,Tjames09,2019-11-12 02:44:00,664,"Not all 91 fuel is ethanol free though. Lots of 91 has ethanol, it will say on the pump."
1052273,AKRISONER,2019-11-12 02:49:00,5558,"unfortunately the 91's that arent (esso, petro) dont tell you the E grade anymore. Safe bet is shell and canadian tire, because they come from the same refinery."
1052284,floater,2019-11-12 11:51:00,220,I had to dumbp200 liters of water contaminated fuel. They tried to keep my 10 gas cans and I said no way. I went to a restaurant and grabbed a bunch of empty fry oil containers. Dropped those off and no issues.
1052295,JoshS,2019-11-12 14:41:00,729,Anyone know if all shell 91 is ethanol free? I thought it was only select Shell's. I check the pure gas app and was looking for a place by bobcaygeon last weekend and the shell there doesn't say ethanol free anymore.
1052300,AKRISONER,2019-11-12 16:10:00,5558,"As far as I was aware, that shell 91 is all produced at the same refinery which is distinctively ethanol free. not sure about small locations but I know our shell in pointe au baril has e free 91"
1052304,KawarthaAngler,2019-11-12 16:24:00,273,That vid was very interesting. ThanksÂ Â ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
1052309,Headhunter,2019-11-12 17:18:00,5703,At .20 cents a litre more than most others nearby.... I stopped there once and got robbed for the fueI bought. HH
1052324,captpierre,2019-11-12 20:31:00,2521,Iâ€™m a cheap bugger and hate to waste money. Iâ€™m guessing that I use 300 litres of gas during The boating season not including the last tank of the year where I already Â useÂ Â Shell 91 to store. @ 30 cents /litre more than regular will cost $90 more per year.Â Thatâ€™s likely worthÂ Â it watching this video. Although no problems after 12 yrs running untreated regular gas during the summers
