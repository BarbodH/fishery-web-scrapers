1052408,Locnar,2019-11-14 01:47:00,645,"Hey fellas, A couple work buddies and I are looking to rent a cabin for a few days next June, and was wondering if anyone had any information. So many places to chose from, all claiming they're the greatest. Preferably within 8hrs of Toronto and hopefully not overly expensive. As for fish species... walleye, pike, maybe rainbow trout. Anything is greatly appreciated.  Tight lines"

1052473,smitty55,2019-11-15 02:11:00,928,Hard to get a cabin for just a few days sometimes. Most lodges try and rent for the week. Good luck. 
1052519,Woodsman,2019-11-15 19:26:00,1286,Although most lodges prefer to rent by the week June isn't always full occupancy. July and August would be another situation. The addition of rainbows will narrow the options.
1052525,BillM,2019-11-15 19:59:00,17367,I'd probably cross rainbows off the list.   All kinds of walleye/pike lakes out there that are accessible by either plane or drive in within 8hrs of Toronto.
1052548,Jmeyer,2019-11-15 23:20:00,83,"I would look around the gowganda or blind river area if rainbows are on the want list, some stocked lakes around gowganda and stocked bows in the river close to laurentian lodge which also has small mouth pike and Lakers in the lake. If you take rainbow off the list it will open up more options for sure. 8 hours can put you as far west as the Sault or as north as Cochrane with lots of great spots in that catchment area."
1052557,Locnar,2019-11-16 05:34:00,645,"Well the idea of rainbows was just a long shot, walleye and pike are the main targets. What would you consider a reasonable price for a decent outfitter?"
1052558,Jmeyer,2019-11-16 11:52:00,83,"I  would check out rays fish camp on Ramsey lake near Sudbury, I see he has daily rates plus I've heard good things about Ramsey. My experience in your range is very limited, I hope Chris Brock or Adam Dempsey chimes in they would definitely be a huge help. Check out Adams directory https://fishingoutposts.com or post the same question on Mike Borger' s site canadafishingguide.net"

1052560,Big Cliff,2019-11-16 13:37:00,6899,"Check this one out, it's a very clean lake  My son and I have had some good success here"
1052564,OhioFisherman,2019-11-16 16:50:00,6623,"Just something to consider, it's probably going to be a lot easier to find a place to stay for a few days before school lets out for the summer."
1052659,pike slayer,2019-11-17 19:38:00,1177,https://bluefoxcamp.com If rainbow what your truely after then this is the place you want to go. They have rainbow Brook and lake trout. I personally haven't been there but fish n' Canada did a show a few years ago there and would love to go.
1052678,Chuck Enwinde,2019-11-18 06:45:00,247,"Agree with what's been said.  Rainbows just complicates things.  Never stayed at Ray's Camp but, Ramsey is good fun. If you want some variety, check out Moosehorn lodge in Chapleau.  Decent walleye fishing on the lake but the set up is a bit unique in that they have boats cached at lots of different lakes in the area.  They'll give you a key and an appropriate motor and you can choose your own adventure- Pike, walleye, brook trout, whitefish or smallmouth (open all year).  You can do a week for about $500 a person including boat, gas and bait."
1052745,chris.brock,2019-11-19 06:46:00,4053,"It's been quite a few years, but I spent a week at Rays and the walleye fishing was like a fly in. Brennan Harbour, Lady Evelyn, West Arm and Upper French stuff are worth a look. Contact Borger, he gave me a little tid bit, I can't mention it, but maybe he'll pass it your way. "
1052811,north560,2019-11-20 14:52:00,38,"Looking for Gowganda area check out gowbushkon.com located on Gowganda Lake with Rainbow lakes a short distance away. Pickeral is the main fish of the lake along with small mouth bass,pike, lake trout,perch . Reasonable prices depending on what dates you want should have something available."
1052888,Locnar,2019-11-22 02:08:00,645,"Gowganda seems like a good balance of distance and pricing... and remoteness. Thanks fellas, I'll be browsing and contacting some folks."
1052889,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-22 02:56:00,8243,Man we are blessed to live where we do with the best fishing and accommodations in the World right here in Ontario. Keep It Beautiful.
1052898,lew,2019-11-22 13:00:00,12766,About 18 years ago my brother and I went to Lost Lake Lodge near Gowganda and had a great trip. They had boats on a bunch of different lakes and you just made small portages between them carrying your gear and small outboard motor. No Idea what it's like now but may be worth checking out and if it's as good as it used to be you'll have a nice trip.
1052930,Locnar,2019-11-23 13:51:00,645,"I was looking at their site the other day, they seem like a good option. Just gotta talk with my buddies and figure it out. Thanks for the input"
