1052540,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-15 20:58:00,8243,"My phone is screwed to the wall. How am I supposed to find a curly cord long enough to reach the lake and attach a TV to it? Come on man don't be silly. As far as a trolling thing for back water fishing. I attached a trolling line clip behind my nephews remote controlled boat a few years ago. And it worked, the problem was you need 2 guys to fish 1 line. One to control the remote and the other to hold the rod."
1018959,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-07 05:14:00,8243,A similar system as used by pier fishermen all over the world. Sometimes the water is 25 feet or more depending on the tide below the piers. You slide the fish over the open net and pull the rope and the bottom closes. 30 foot net handles are rare.
1018966,Terry,2017-12-07 12:12:00,14456,"this is what i would build to stop fish from going back down the hole buy a pipe style wood clamp put a rod through the pipe with a round plate on one end a bit smaller then the hole and a 90 deg handle at the other end, clamp it to the ice  with the round plate against the ice, when you get a fish in the hole you turn the handle which puts the plate blocking the bottom of the hole, sorry if i am not explaining it well enough "
1018968,Acountdeleted,2017-12-07 12:48:00,2562,Makes total sense. I really really like this idea. doesn't add anything extra for the fish or line to get stuck on.
1018970,Cast-Away,2017-12-07 13:39:00,790,I once saw a heated discussion between a guide and one of the guests at the fishing resort!

1052223,limeyangler,2019-11-11 14:31:00,5204,A small underwater camera that connects directly to your phone. All these aqua view things cost a fortune and are big and clunky. I know the big guys in the business could easily do it but then they would not sell as many of their over priced over size gadgets. 
1052411,Mad Scientist,2019-11-14 02:02:00,4,I sometimes hike into lakes with no road access. Fishing from shore is limited by how far I can cast. I would love to have a remote control boat (toy sized)  that could carry my line and bait out deeper in the lake and release it where I think the fish might be lurking. Better yet would be a boat that could troll a lure around the lake and release it when a fish strikes.I think all the techno exists but needs to be put together in one package.

1052433,Fisherman,2019-11-14 17:23:00,7201,"I know this is reviving an old post, the only thing you would have to regulate is the heat on the guides. Too hot and you would melt your fishing line, not warm enough, annoyed customer."
1052434,BillM,2019-11-14 17:25:00,17367,"Yup, voltage regulator should do it.  Keep those guides at about 50 degrees and you'll be all set."
1052436,Sterling,2019-11-14 17:34:00,477,"Bill, considering the nature of the product I'd avoid the voltage regulator entirely. Best solution is to stop heating when the target temperature is reached (maybe 1-2 degrees)."
1052437,NAW,2019-11-14 17:35:00,4022,"I think you could mold your own ceramic guides, with a w copper wire buried in the center.   Each wire from each guide could run through a small hole drilled in the blank, and back to the handle where you can have a double A battery buried in the cork handle.  There.  Design problem solved.  Give me some money"

1052442,BillM,2019-11-14 18:20:00,17367,Problem is all guides aren't the same size or thickness.   Unless an average was take (A few will be over a few will be under) and do it that way.
1052449,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-14 19:08:00,8243,"Last spring I gave my genius buddy (don't tell him I said that) to run with the light weight hi R value fish hut. He told me all we need is about 200K cash to run with it. Drawings, a to scale prototype, a Patent Lawyer, a full prototype, travelling over seas to find a cheap manufacturer and then local distribution for the product oh and then an inventory to supply Bass Pro and CTC if you get a meeting and they say yes give us 10,000 for a trial run. 200 grand probably isn't enough. There is a reason some of the best inventions in the world sit in someone's basement or garage. Cash poor."
1052454,Sterling,2019-11-14 20:01:00,477,That is true but the voltage regulator won't fix the problem. I would probably measure temperature at the smallest guide and call it a day.
1052469,BillM,2019-11-14 23:53:00,17367,That's probably your safest bet.  As they're the ones getting iced up first anyhow.

1018830,Sterling,2017-12-05 00:58:00,477,"With the long winter ahead I've decided to put some time and effort into developing what I think would be useful/cool fishing gadgets. I have an engineering background, CAD abilities and some manufacturing connections (both onshore and abroad). Also my sister in law is from China so she can act as an intermediate if I decide to manufacture there. I was wondering if some of you have ideas to toss my way. Maybe something you always wanted to invent but never had the time. Hate to see a good idea go to waste you know. So far I have the following underway; 1. Diver that can be attached anywhere on the line. Similar to Slide Diver but no small parts and can be installed within seconds. I have this one 80% figured out. 2. Fixed ""slider"" that can be attached/removed in 1 second flat. Completely fixed, as in, will not move even when a strike occurs. Allows you to easily stack a bunch of lures. This one is 95% figured out. Going to prototype it soon. Do you think these products would be useful? If so - what are the MUST have features for each? Let's hear it folks!"
1018831,BillM,2017-12-05 01:13:00,17367,"Heated guides.  I get 50% of the millions you'll make off this, lol.   I'm guessing all you'd need is some copper wire and a small battery."
1018832,Sterling,2017-12-05 01:18:00,477,Which guides are you referring to?
1018833,Fisherman,2017-12-05 01:28:00,7201,The ones where the fishing line goes through on the rod.  In winter they freeze up and then you have to dick around blowing on them or breaking off the little bits of ice so the line can be let out or reeled in.
1018835,porkpie,2017-12-05 03:25:00,2521,"Let me know when you have your slide diver figured out, I'll buy a couple."
1018836,Acountdeleted,2017-12-05 03:46:00,2562,"An Ice fishing 'net' I'll explain how it works. You drill your ice fishing hole (6 inch, 8 inch, whatever) then you slide this tube down the hole right on the inside. Anchors to the top. The tube could be 24-36 inches. When you are reeling the fish up and you get it to the top of the ice, you hit a button (either on the tube or a remote control) and the bottom of the tube closes up. Lift the tube out of the water (tube has water drain holes at the bottom) and you have your fish.  I'd have a dozen or so trophie Lakers and whitefish I wouldn't have lost at the ice if this exsisted.  I'll take 5% of the profits for giving you the idea."

1018850,NAW,2017-12-05 17:22:00,4022,"Sounds like you have some fun winter projects! I have a modular ice hut design that can be broken down in to 4 smaller (4x8) ice huts.  But they can all be clamped together with a removable wall,   That way you can have a few huts out at different spots early season.  And when you find the honey hole, snap all the huts together and it turns in to a 8x16 sleeper cabin..   Breaks down for easy transport and I can tow the smaller huts individually with my bravo or even by hand.   Snap them together in your back yard in the summer, and you have a big 8x16 shed to store your winter gear (which for me is massive between all the kids toys, and all of my toys/gear, etc.) Just working out some of the fine details on how to clamp the walls, and where to put the holes.  How to make them snap together and have the hole orientations still work, door locations, heat source, etc... I have a similar one designed in Solidworks right now.. I just have no time at all to work on the design any more... If you need a hand with any design work, or manufacturing.. Let me know.  I work for a large fab/machine/automation shop with an extremely wide range of capabilities.. If you need any complex machining or welding, I can hook you up!"

Now we can show the big one that didn't get away! Introducing the Crappie Coffin, the only ice fishing net on the market today. Born out of the frustration of losing that big fish at the top of the hole. I decided to go to work on a solution to this problem. The Crappie Coffin is the result of this effort. Placed in the drilled ice hole, you drop your jig down through the center of the Crappie Coffin and fish as always. The hooked fish is reeled up and enters through the one way passage at the bottom and is then trapped within the net. Also your sonar transducer will work normally placed inside the unit. No more lost fish wrapped around your transducer. Once you use the Crappie Coffin you'll never want to fish without one."""

1018953,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-07 04:09:00,8243,"A small battery powered hook sharpener. Along the lines of an electric tooth brush or Dremell tool. Small, cheap and most importantly easy to use when the boat is tossing around like a cork in the water and you won't impale the hook into your flesh. Nothing like having the exact lure they want and the hook gets dull. If they exist already please tell me were, I'll buy them all. For any of you guys that need the perfect material for your ice huts/hotels get some 2"" thick Sunroom wall materials. Close cell insulation clad in aluminum or a poly composite. A 4'X8'X2"" (R-15) sheet might weigh 2 pounds. It also comes in 4X8 foot sheets that are 3 3/4"" thick and might weigh 5 lbs each (R-22). The materials are Hurricane rated. The walls and roofs snap and slide together on a track system. Find the wall materials at Temo Sunrooms out of Clinton Township Michigan. Locally Leisure Living Sunrooms out of Burlington may source them from you locally. We made one when I was in the sunroom business for one of our guys, it was 6'X12' and could be moved by 1 person once erected. If it wasn't spiked down it would blow away and another plus is the aluminum material was fire rated as well. I think it came in at around 60 pounds including sliding plexiglas windows.  Perfect for a remote hunt/fish camp too. I wanted to go into the ice hut business back then, should a could a, might still you never know. Please don't quote me on exact weight or R value, it's close for sure, 12 years ago."
