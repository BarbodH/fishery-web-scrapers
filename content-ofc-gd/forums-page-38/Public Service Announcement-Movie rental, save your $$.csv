1050900,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-11 01:30:00,8243,You beat me to it Terry. That Google guy knows everything. I do have to wonder who counted them all?
1050904,lew,2019-10-11 12:04:00,12766,Someone who obviously needs to get a life me thinks.
1050933,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-12 03:14:00,8243,Come to think of it I counted for 1/2 hour. There is a great movie on right now on Turner Classic Movie channel. Invasion of Astro-Monster. (1965) A Japanese production in Technicolor. An astronaut goes to Planet-X to fetch Rodan and Godzilla that Earth lent to aliens supposedly in distress. The dubbing in English is the best.
1052554,misfish,2019-11-16 02:26:00,29133,Going to start watching Primal. Cage is the director and main actor. Give my review later .
1052600,misfish,2019-11-16 21:19:00,29133,Fell a sleep 1/3 the way though. Re watched today.  B- 
1048745,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-24 03:26:00,8243,"Typical Nickolas Cage movie, It starts for 90 minutes and then doesn't finish. """" LOOKING GLASS"" Cage owes 100's of 1000's in back taxes to the IRS. He did this one to pay down the debt I guess. Terrible way to waste 2 hours. If he spoke the worst line in movie history it might have been worth it. In a movie called """"Straw Man"" if I can recall he stops a woman riding her bicycle,  pulls a gun on her and says ""Step away from the bike!"" Then he is burned at the stake by the locals."
1048749,dave524,2019-08-24 10:42:00,4508,"You can still rent movies ? ?  only liked him in "" Conair "" that was eons ago"
1048751,grimsbylander,2019-08-24 13:09:00,3016,I thought The Rock with Sean Connery and Ed Harris was a good movie too.
1048752,woodenboater,2019-08-24 13:10:00,2277,"c'mon, The Rock was was pretty good, esp with Sean Connery and Ed Harris in it. Con Air was fun, and John Malkovitch and Steve Buschemi help round out a good cast in that movie. "
1048755,grimsbylander,2019-08-24 13:22:00,3016,I agree!! Lol
1048760,porkpie,2019-08-24 13:53:00,2521,Don’t bother with 211 either.  Another Cage dive bomb.
1048762,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-24 14:03:00,8243,"We live in a village called Selkirk for gosh sakes. We even got a flashing red light a few years ago and the Mayor cut the ribbon. And yes we can still rent movies, for $2.99, $6.99 from Bell TV, unfortunately VHS is no longer available Dave. Even Blue Ray whatever that is, doesn't work on my machine. When we move we are going to join the 21st Century and get streaming video, if I can enough band width, I'm learning, slowly."
1048767,dave524,2019-08-24 14:40:00,4508,"Yeah , you gotta get bandwidth. We cut the Bell/Cogeco,  C note a month TV cord a year ago, right now between Live Net TV as a free IPTV and Cyberflix for binge watching TV  shows and movies we don't miss a thing, even get all the SportsNet and TSN channels for live sports."

1050812,ketchenany,2019-10-08 23:24:00,3229,"Lew I think we are in the same zone. I think they dragged me in ‘78, what a waste of time.  Did enjoy the drive-in in the early 70s. One of my son in-laws used to live at Langstaff and  Hwy 27. Used to sit in his backyard;  HUGE, and watch them across the street for free. NO sound! the colossus centre at 400 and 7 was A drive in! I probably sat in COSTCO!   "
1050813,misfish,2019-10-08 23:33:00,29133," Ok ok, stop with the dating yerselves era. LMAO  I remember going to the 400 drive in as a kid. It was super exciting for us kids. Get thjere for the right spot,enjoy the play ground. When the car lights starting flashing to get the movie started,we would book it to the car. Dodge dart, 3 boys in the back seat.   We would get through the 1st movie,then it was nighty night. Pop always had a huge bag of popcorn  made in paper bags. Lots of butter and salt. The odd time,we got  a treat. Super hot dogs from the vendor.  Thanks for the remember Albert."
1050814,ketchenany,2019-10-08 23:42:00,3229,Your parents took you? I drove! And ended up living at 7 and Pine valley many years later. I was there when they started the Colossus centre and  demolished the drive in. I don’t remember going for treats

I’m writing a short story about my evolution in the typesetting trade, from day one to today and backing it up with pictures and lots of collectibles. The changes that I have survived but MY kid have no clue what got them where they are now. Hard work. It was a long journey, no days off and it got me some amazing memories and friends.  I even hired some of  my teachers. Work in progress and even fishing experiences.  "

1050867,ckewley,2019-10-10 11:14:00,699,"He certainly has been in his fair share of dogs but Cage always shines when he gets to play unhinged characters & his latest ones still prove this. Army of One, Mom & Dad, Mandy (perhaps his unhinged best), Colour out of Space (fantastic Lovecraft adaptation) but then he drops movies like Joe out of nowhere where he shows he really has the ability to act. All this comes from a guy who considers Cannibal Ferox & Brain Damage to be masterpieces so take that for what its worth!"
1050871,AKRISONER,2019-10-10 13:58:00,5558,wicker man may be one of the funniest unintentional comedies of all time.
1050875,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-10 17:14:00,8243,"I watched John Wick latest killer flic last week. I actually wrote down how many he killed in the 1st 30 minutes. He killed 13, he got stabbed in the neck and took a blade to his liver, got hit by the same Caddy twice then shot his Doc to make it look good as he wasn't to receive any help."
1050876,NAW,2019-10-10 18:06:00,4022,Now they are making a spin off called Ballerina. Which follows one of the ballerina's from that scene who goes on a rampage...  Then John Wick 4 soon to follow.  Love those movies.
1050878,AKRISONER,2019-10-10 18:33:00,5558,"john wick is a sweet action movie. Ridiculous, but still awesome. Another one of my favourites is Ong Bak Thai Warrior  that was the only movie ive ever been in in the theatre where people stood up and went OOOOOOHHHHHHHH! DURING THE FIGHT SCENES!"
1050895,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-11 00:36:00,8243,I wonder how many that Wick guy has killed on screen?  I'm sure someone out in internet land has counted. There's a Google question you don't hear everyday. The girl in the last flic killed her share of villains.
