I guess I fell behind on the information highway......only found out today that Ranger boats were bought by Bass Pro Shops......in 2014!  Yikes!"
1051755,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-30 22:39:00,10439,I was super impressed with my Fisher early on. A few years after I got it I wanted to paint and re carpet it to match my truck. When I dove into the job I was surprised to find the floor and all the stringers were aluminium. The only wood on the entire boat was the core of the transom and 2 pieces of teak trim one to mount the TM on and one at the stern of the boat. As I had it completely stripped I could see how well it was put together as well.
1051757,Terry,2019-10-30 22:49:00,14456,That’s good to know I will only have to replace the wood in the transom on my 16 ft fisher bass boat

I bought a one year old Ranger 620 in 2011, had some issues (minor) in 2017 and called Ranger, they told me if i brought it down they would fix the issues as a courtesy. I like to drive so away i went. Took a tour of the factory and said good buy to my boat. Went back 5 months later (April) to get it ( and another tour of the factory) Put new bunks and fenders,new keel guard and did the brakes all FREE. You can't top that"

1051871,John Bacon,2019-11-02 16:18:00,3277,"I believe that Legend gets hulls from more than one source.  So, some, but not all, Legend hulls come from the Smokercraft/Starcraft factory.  Also, while Legend gets their hulls from other companies, I believe they do their own interiors.  And same factory doesn't always mean same quality... Starcraft is the premium line of Smokercraft.  So, if Smokercraft is there, Starcraft should be too."

The hull was like the day it came out of the factory...nothing loose, nothing leaked...and its been on Lake Erie and Lake St.Clair a lot. Amazing hull construction. The only drawback with the early-mid 2000's with Lund is they used CRAP for wood in the floors and transom. I replaced 2 of the floor sections where the seat bases bolted through, and replaced the transom. The wood wasnt sealed epoxied glassed, etc...so check carefully with a used one. Lund changed the materials mid-2000's and I think they are way better now. "

I looked at a bunch of other brands and they all have some things that I liked better/worse but smokercraft met most of my wants. The 90HO motor is just amazing, the hole shot is instantaneous and top end is in the low 40's.. My previous boat was a 1997 Sea Nymph FM161 with a 50 Johnson, severed me well for many years but cant even compare to the new boat. If you have any questions PM me and I will answer them as best I can Scott "
1051681,AKRISONER,2019-10-29 15:57:00,5558,"I am also going to chime in about the Smokercraft hull failures...My best friend had an 10 year old smokercraft that is ""smoked"" the rivets blew and she sank. Not to mention the thing felt like you were getting in a car crash with every bit of chop or boat wake you hit. Myself and the close people that I associate with fish out of/have fished out of Smokercraft, starcraft, Lund, Crestliner, Alumacraft, Glasstron, Skeeter, Triton, Basscat (understanding the last 4 are glass boats) Myself/my dad have run Yamaha, suzuki, johnson and mercury outboards. Ill lay it out simply, Hulls - The smokercraft sank. The starcraft is 12 years old, is fine, but kinda rides like crap, the Lund Crestliner and Alumacraft all look great, but the styling/finish of the lund and alumacraft is probably a bit nicer. The alumcrafts have Lund quality at a slightly lower price IMO. The hulls on em make them like tanks, stable, unshakable fishing beasts. Outboards? The Johnson is dead (electrical issues that left us stranded multiple times) the 2012 mercury causes us grief more electrical issues (my best friends mercury's lower end leaks like sieve its 6 years old) my 88 Suzuki on my starcraft runs just fine having never been properly winterized and treated like crap its entire life. We clean the carb occasionally with carb cleaner and run a can of seafoam through it and it runs first pull. My 98 Yamaha 130 is bone stock and runs like the day it was bought and gets tournament driven and takes me out on the lake for over 300 fishing hours a year, the lower end has 0 water in it every fall and the 2 stroke starts easily and runs clean with minimal smoke. the 2016 four stroke yamaha is like a car, it hasnt had a single issue yet Close family friend runs an evinrude G1 and has had electrical issues. Thats plainly put for your consideration. Its my raw experience with no real bias, its just reality. I will also say BUY USED! I bought my 98 skeeter for $9,000, came with a trolling motor and stainless prop and I put about $2000 of work into it, upgrading electronics, trolling motor, rewiring, new seats and the thing is a tournament fishing machine. Its not a hulking beast like a 20 foot bassboat, but has a couple storage compartments, a rod locker, two livewells and goes 55mph. Does pretty much everything you could ask of a boat. I get compliments regularly at the launch about how nice my boat is. Not bad if you ask me for $11,000.  "
1051684,dave524,2019-10-29 16:44:00,4508,"Kinda strange about Smokercraft hull failures, I always thought that Smokercraft, Sylvan and Starcraft all started with the same hull ?"
1051685,AKRISONER,2019-10-29 17:35:00,5558,"Starcraft and smoker were the same, not sure about sylvan as I don’t know about them."
1051687,Therealgooseman,2019-10-29 17:47:00,7,Lots of stories about older Smokercraft hulls with issues but seemed to have been resolved around 2005/2006. They also offer a lifetime warranty on their hulls. I agree with the Lund and Crestliner maybe a little nicer boat but I rode in a 2018 Lund Rebel and the rough water ride in the smokercraft was better in my opinion. It may have to do with the wider beam on a the Pro Angler xl.
1051692,AKRISONER,2019-10-29 19:20:00,5558,The one that I know that sank was later than 06 and they couldn’t make a warranty claim...
1051695,Therealgooseman,2019-10-29 19:32:00,7,Only a few reasons why a warranty claim is denied and usually has to do with improper use... could explain hull issues
1051696,Terry,2019-10-29 19:44:00,14456,Yeah it would be crazy talk to say a boat manufacturer would try to get out of honouring their warranty  yeah

1051726,bigbuck,2019-10-30 13:43:00,2449,"Stick to Lund, Alumacraft, Princecraft, Crestliner, Smokercraft, those brands are more expensive for a reason. Yamaha 4stroke on the back for bulletproof reliability and you will be happy for many years to come."
1051727,Fishing Rod,2019-10-30 13:57:00,5,"I've been shopping for a boat for a year and have found out a few things. Now is the time to buy a new boat. Dealers want to move them and manufacturers are offering rebates. They are also able to give you the boat show extended warranty on the motor. Also now is a good time to buy a used boat, but people are starting to store them and take them off the market. Very few good boats come up used. Finding a used Lund or Alumacraft that is only a couple of years old is almost impossible in the 18' range. Almost all used boats for sale are under powered. I caulk that up to slimy salesman selling a boat to an unknowing person at a price point they can afford. Be careful of people telling you how great there brand of boat is. Most people don't know s##t. (other than you guys lol) I would listen to people that have had problems though."
1051731,AKRISONER,2019-10-30 15:07:00,5558,"thats the problem with most things when it comes to getting opinions about boats is people are very brand loyal. Just like with cars, you wont see to many dodge guys telling you how great an f150 or vice versa. I can honestly say with 100% conviction that having spent my life with quads, skidoos, and boats, two things are consistent. Sometimes you have a bad one, sometimes you have something that just seems to last forever. The only weird one is that every japanese motor myself or my family or very close friends have owned has lasted. We had/have a suzuki quad from 1986 that my uncle who just passed away still had. A very good friend of mine's 85 three wheeler honda still runs (hes had the head redone), my nephews 89 suzuki 4 wheeler runs, my 88 suzuki 15 outboard still runs, and my 1998 yamaha 2 stroke outboard runs. None of them seem to die. Go to Mexico or cuba and check what outboards they are running, they are literally 100% old beat to hell yamahas...that...still run? That was enough to sell me when I was buying an 20 year old outboard with my boat last year. I went with what I knew would probably keep running, and not surprisingly aside from an impeller change, I havent had a single issue."

1051736,Fishing Rod,2019-10-30 16:28:00,5,My opinion is that why the Japanese outboards last so long is that they are old technology that is tried and true. Evenrude and Mercury both try to push the envelope .... and sometimes go boom.
1051739,mikeh,2019-10-30 16:51:00,824,"If you buy a boat in the US some of the outboards do not let you transfer the warranty to Canada, i believe Yamaha doesn't"

I have been really pleased with it and when I went deep into it to run cables and wiring I was totally impressed with the construction of it.

1051594,John Bacon,2019-10-28 03:40:00,3277,"I think some of the trim is added in Canada, but the hulls are imported from the U.S.  Legend doesn't manufacture their own hulls.  However, I think that the recommendation not to buy Legend is about quality; not where they're made."

1051600,Garnet,2019-10-28 10:06:00,2056,"Sounds like you trailer some so go for good trailer 14 tires oil bath bearings. Get everything on the boat electronics, trolling motor, kicker. This is the time to negotiate. Those show special boats are not that good when you put the good stuff on them. I haven't been in the Aluminum market for years. But I've seen many Crestliners that turned my head."
1051603,Yellow Fever,2019-10-28 10:54:00,139,"If you want your best bang for the buck buy a used boat....so many boats for sale, I bought my boat used and it still had warranty so i had no worries.  There are a ton of good boats out there, the Princecraft,Crestliner and Kingfisher are good choices."
1051607,lew,2019-10-28 11:14:00,12766,I bought a new 1650 Crestliner in '99 and drove it for 10 years with zero issues then sold it to a bud who has been driving it now for another 10 years and it's still good. I'd definitely recommend Crestliner for anyone looking for a well made boat.
1051610,dave524,2019-10-28 12:42:00,4508,"Any chance you have the time and ability to rebuild the Smokercraft, new floor and transom, carpet, vinyl etc? I ran an 80's 18 ' Sylvan , likely the same hull, it's a good hull but you would want to upgrade the motor to 115 anyways, it would be a bit of a dog with a 70. The max on that hull was 140 horses. You be dollars ahead, insane prices on even a 18 tinner new these days, I paid less for my house than some listings."
1051611,bigcreekdad,2019-10-28 12:42:00,546,"I've had an Alumacraft tiller Magnum 165 for 20 years, pared now with a Yamaha 60 4 stroke. It is an awesome fishing boat. I'm likely too old to justify a new one, but wouldn't look further if I was. The Buy used recommendation has a lot of merit. If you are on Facebook there is a Used Walleye Boats For Sale site that will alert you to anything new. I've seen some very nice used boats on it."
1051613,Cast-Away,2019-10-28 12:53:00,790,"I have a 2000 17' Legend with the riveted hull and ""100 gauge"" aluminum. I just dropped $5,000 on the boat having it gutted in order to replace 9 rivets. 5 were gone and another 4 were leaking. The 1/2"" plywood floor was replaced as well with 1 1/2"" thick laminated plywood and of course new carpeting. Lot's of labour to repair it. Two years into owning the boat from brand new I had it back to Legend to replace rivets in the same area of the hull. I decided to fix up the boat because we plan to use it for many more years. The quality of the cockpit was not very good on the boat as well. I've had to re-mount it with extra screws a few times now. I can't speak for the quality of new boats welded or riveted, however, this was my experience. If I bought a new boat tomorrow it would be a Lund."
1051614,Lape0019,2019-10-28 12:57:00,647,"First off,  There really isn't anything wrong with a Legend or a Tracker but you need to understand that they are entry level boats. Their fit and finish, components used and the motors they put on the package boats leave a lot to be desired. Once you adequately power the boat with the proper HP, you are not that far off in price from the better alternatives in there.  It has been said before and I will echo it. Lund, Princecraft, Crestline or Alumacraft all make excellent boats. I am not sure about Alumacraft (because I have never really paid attention to them for sale on the used market) but the other 3 for sure hold their value."
1051632,Sinker,2019-10-28 18:24:00,8692,"Take a good long hard look at the starcrafts! People always tend to forget about them, but they are an awesome boat! Be careful of certain year LUNDS, the transoms are rotten, or rotting out of them. Make sure its a newer one with the composite transom, or an old one. My tops picks if I had your money would be almumacraft, starcraft, Lund.  Nothing but yamaha engines, i wouldn't even buy it if its not a yammy.  S."
1051635,BillM,2019-10-28 18:54:00,17367,"Spend your money in the used market, it will go a lot further."
1051638,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-28 19:16:00,8243,"Your purchase is all about your budget. Buying slightly used will save you many thousands vs. buying brand new. Glass or aluminum, welded or riveted, many things to consider. This is a great time to buy new though. Winter sales for new boats is a killer for Marine businesses, they do not want to carry over last years inventory, they need cash to survive the winter. I am a StarCraft owner and can't say enough about them and their deep V design. As far as a family friendly as well as fishing boat to trailer you are looking at a minimum 18' aluminum bowrider with full windshield and interchangeable seating in my opinion. Getting into a new 18'er with a 150 4 stroke regardless of manufacturer you are looking at the high side of $50,000.00. Last week I saw a 17' Crestliner side council at my Marine dealer with a 125 4 stroke on sale for 40K. DO NOT consider a Cracker errrrr I should say Tracker. There is no need for me to explain why here just Google Tracker boat problems, there is plenty to read from owners. I strongly suggest you go to iboats.com, join and enter your question. At any given time there can be 100,000 people on that site. Plus they have hundreds of used boats there to check and compare prices."
1051639,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-28 19:25:00,10439,I bought my boat from Legend back in 1991. The hull is a Fisher on my particular boat and has been a good boat over the years. I did upgrade the motor when I purchased it and back in 2013 upgraded to a bigger 4 stroke. If I had to buy a new boat today to replace it I would most likely get a Crestliner. If I was looking for an upgrade from what I have I would likely get a Kingfisher with hard top. But I haven't won the lottery yet soooooooooooo................................................................
1051641,irishfield,2019-10-28 20:20:00,26272,"But there is.. Legends lose rivets.. I mean actually totally lose the rivet in numerous cases. Seat pedestals break right out of the floor. Trackers crack open and on an attempted warranty claim they'll tell you the weld didn't break so you're not covered. Of course, the weld never breaks.. it breaks beside it due to degraded material from the heat of the weld. I've fixed many for members here. Lunds and Crestliners, not so much..."
1051643,mistyriver1,2019-10-28 20:38:00,600,"As Lew said, I bought his boat 10 years ago and she is still going strong.  Another vote for Crestliner here."
1051645,dave524,2019-10-28 20:58:00,4508,"Yeah, buddy bought an early Crestliner welded about 1990, that is exactly how it failed, immediately adjacent to the weld, luckily he was a welder at Dofasco with a string of tickets and took it to work on the offshift and repaired it with the proper gear as warranty would do squat, he pounded it pretty hard offshore Lake Ontario. It was an open 16 with a tiller and he sold it to a duck hunter for marsh work."
1051648,irishfield,2019-10-28 21:29:00,26272,No issues when you fix aluminum boats the correct way...  A Grumman I fixed for a member back in 2009.. 
1051654,tb4me,2019-10-28 23:30:00,3295,I did this already. Sad part in the plywood is going AGAIN only after 3 years.. used marine grade plywood. Cut to fit then primed. Then coated with resin. Then installed marine grade vinyl over top . The transom is starting to get soft and it looks like the flotation foam is in need of replacment. Id rather sell it to a handy person then go thru all that work again. Just heartbreaking to have a floor failure that fast..
1051655,tb4me,2019-10-28 23:33:00,3295,So I was out to my local dealer. Had a look at the new smoker crafts. Man are they ever nice . I hear what a few of you have said about buying used.  It seems as though the banks only want to finance a new boat. I still want to go check out the crestliner and alumna crafts. Who sells them in the hamilton brantford area?
