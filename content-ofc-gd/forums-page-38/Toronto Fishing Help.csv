I do have some questions as far as fish species and locations if you don’t mind helping. 1. Is it too late to fish for salmon up the streams?  	2. Are there rules for fishing with spinning rods and lures (mepps, worms, etc). 3. what are some good locations for a tourist to go fishing? ( at this time of the year) thank you guys for your helping!"
