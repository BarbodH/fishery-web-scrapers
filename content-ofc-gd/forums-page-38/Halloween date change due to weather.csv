1051930,Toronto_Angler,2019-11-03 14:51:00,698,Well we both pretty much had the same point on this one lol My sarcasm was for the curmudgeons who are always complaining kids aren't tough enough like in their day
1051933,misfish,2019-11-03 15:49:00,29133,"Yup, me as well Chris. Just back from a rain/snow morning,water conditions were tough, but gave it a go. I need no more rain for the next week or so. Just to bring the river down."
1051935,misfish,2019-11-03 15:51:00,29133,"Would this be a good thing or a bad thing in your mind ? Tough up,or suck out ?"
1051936,BillM,2019-11-03 15:52:00,17367,I think the OP meant to post this on Reddit and not a fishing forum.Â  Take this crap somewhere else.
1051937,Toronto_Angler,2019-11-03 15:52:00,698, I dont know anymore lol. I hate the cold Im a wimp Ill admit it thats why I need to move to florida. That and the year round soft water fishing
1051960,AKRISONER,2019-11-04 14:35:00,5558,"And this is why western canada hates us.  What do you think kids in Flin Flon did? When I was of trick or treating age, it was standard procedure, your halloween costume could fit your snowsuit underneath it. I recall Halloween 94 or 95 it was legitimately -20 when we were trick or treating.  I felt the same way when i first moved to ontario and they would force us to have recess inside any time Ontario issued an ""extreme cold weather alert"" because daytime temperatures didnt reach over -10. In flin flon you didnt see warmer than -10 from december to April every year lol."
1051966,Headhunter,2019-11-04 17:16:00,5703,"Knowing that the weather was going to be what it was, I was out dishing candy from 6:00pm until 7:30 when the downpour hit. We had more kids this year, than the last ten! Might have been the parents directing them here as I had a bottle of ""99"" for the dads and a bottle of pre-mixed ""chocolate martini's "" for the moms. No one complained about the weather.... NOW GET OFF MY LAWN! HH"
1051969,crappieperchhunter,2019-11-04 17:56:00,2582,Funny HH I keep track every year just because and we had a record number of kids this year too. 35 trick or treaters this year....most years don't get over 20. Put a major dint in the left overs that I get to snack onðŸ˜¡
1051980,Headhunter,2019-11-04 20:49:00,5703,"That's why I buy lots of ""extra""... and why I have a muffin top! HH"
1051844,cisco,2019-11-01 20:18:00,597,"As a kid I recall the less fortunate coming to the door with pillow sacks and little makeup/costume. They came to the door early and late compared to the general population of trick-or-treaters. Last night I though of the less fortunate out there trying to get candy in the rain, cold temps and high winds while the more fortunate had lessÂ cause to 'venture forth'. Hearing that some places near Montreal postponed the date while the GTA didn't got me thinking about it.Â  The kids out there need our protection from the elements and vehicle traffic. I am considering asking gov't to consider this aspect if they haven't thought about it. Thoughts?"
1051848,BillM,2019-11-01 22:07:00,17367,"Changing Halloween is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.Â  Enough helicopter parenting.Â  If you want candy that badly, grab a poncho and an umbrella, also a flash light and go get your candy."
1051849,crappieperchhunter,2019-11-02 00:03:00,2582,Big family chat about this last night because of the news about Montreals plans.Â Â  The winning choice in our group comprised of grandparents and parents was more about when thenÂ weather. Our group would all like Halloween to be relegated to a Friday or Saturday night so everyone has the next day off rather then worrying about babysitting Â or having to work in the morning. Make it like fishing seasons. Example bass opens last Friday in June around here. Make trick or treat night the last saturday in October. Easy Peasy.  Edit to add. I'm retired and could care less. Just thinking it would be good for families dealing with daycare and 2 working parents. Something us older generations never ever had to give any thought too.
1051853,wkrp,2019-11-02 01:19:00,656,I really dont give S or a F about halloween .
1051857,porkpie,2019-11-02 11:00:00,2521,"I stood in the rain with my 2 youngest. Â They didnt seem to mind, and neither did I. Â Sometimes life throws you lemons. Â Showing kids how to make the best of it despite the circumstances helps them develop personal strength."
1051859,bigugli,2019-11-02 11:11:00,6138,Canada is turning into a nation of marshmallows. Why not just buy 5lbs of candy stay home and plunk the kids in front of the screen
1051860,Mister G,2019-11-02 12:33:00,1429,So we teach the kids NOT to take candy from strangers and then send them out in the dark to get candy from STRANGERS......... am I missing something here.
1051872,Sinker,2019-11-02 16:34:00,8692,"I'd bet that is what a lot of ""parents"" did.  I agree, a bunch of whining, entitledÂ pussies.  S."
1051873,bigugli,2019-11-02 16:40:00,6138,"A few parents from my grandaughter's class were keeping their kids indoors. We still had over 70 kids at our door. A whole bunch shouting ""trick or treat, and I've been good Santa"" Must have something to do with my jovial image "
1051874,misfish,2019-11-02 16:45:00,29133,A little early for the tree aint it ? LOL I was in Wally world this morning. Christmas is already in full force. LOL
1051876,Sinker,2019-11-02 17:33:00,8692,"I'm too far out of town to get any trick or treaters, but when I was a kid, we didn't care one bit what the weather was. We could not wait to get off school and get at those free candies! So, are we going to change the date for christmas too, if there's no snow? What about easter? Too cold, lets wait til next weekend? I can't even understand where someone comes up with such a stupid idea. S. "
1051877,Sinker,2019-11-02 17:50:00,8692,"I can understand that reasoning, but Why change it now? What if it rains or snows on the last friday? Do we change it to the next day with a nice forecast? How about we leave it as it has been for hundreds of years, and deal with the weather as it comes.  S. "
1051878,misfish,2019-11-02 18:00:00,29133,"LOL Shane We would be out, fill a bag, head home to do the drop, grab another pillow case and be gone for another load. Fun times then.ðŸ¤£"
1051879,crappieperchhunter,2019-11-02 18:01:00,2582,Like I said Shayne I could care less and our discussion the other night had nothing to do with changing dates because of the weather which just opens a whole can of worms I don't care about either.Â It was all about making it a Friday or Saturday night so the vast majorityÂ could have a nice evening out....or in... and not worry about work or school the next day. Â The kids don't care at all as long as they get there sugar fix...lol.
1051880,Toronto_Angler,2019-11-02 18:19:00,698,When I was young I used to walk 50 miles barefoot in the snow to school and I had to pay for halloween candy with money I earned working night shift at the grain mill...Blah Blah Blah the horses in here are mighty high
1051882,Fisherman,2019-11-02 18:34:00,7201,"I remember our first Hallowe'en in Manitoba,Â  -10 and 2 feet of snow.Â  Do you think that stopped the kids, nope.Â  Dress right and fill the pillow case.Â  My boys went out twice to make sure they got a full load."
1051884,cisco,2019-11-02 19:10:00,597,"Poor kids can't afford ""flashlights and ponchos"" or ""buy candy"" to stay at home. Many get meals at school since they don't get fed at home before. I was just thinking of a way to keep them safer than having to deal with the 80km winds and rain experienced this Halloween. I can imagine that some of us here had it tough growing up and this hardening proved useful.Â Kudos!!! But I'm talking about poor kids on their own out in the stuff your kids and grandkids didn't have to go out in last night or that didn't go out in for long. But OK guess the issue is not worth bothering about. Next time you don't go out fishing or hunting due to bad weather I hope you change your mind and go knowing you'd send poor young kids out in it."
1051885,DanD,2019-11-02 19:12:00,2223,"Changing the date of holoween is just another chip off of our cultureâ€™s history.Â  	Whatâ€™s next, no Lordâ€™s Prayer at school. Oh wait thatâ€™s already happened! How many more of our customs will be changed, to satisfy new wave and new Canadians. Customs/annual events should stay as is; or they are not ANNIAL OR OUR CUSTOMS! Dan."
1051892,Sinker,2019-11-02 20:19:00,8692,"I grew up poor. We made due with what we had, and if we didn't have it, we'd find a way to make it or work towards getting it. Babying every human on the earth has watered down society so much that all we are left with are whining, entitled brats. Suck it up and get outside. Its good for you.  P.S....since when has weather ever stopped me from going fishing or hunting? Never has and never will.  S."
1051901,bigugli,2019-11-02 21:54:00,6138,"Not go fishing because of some rain or snow??Â  That's a larf.Â  Something some ""city type"" might do. but not where I grew up, and definitely not now. Mom didn't raise no sissies ( even though the step-dad was )"

1051906,irishfield,2019-11-02 23:23:00,26272,"Sad part is , that most of the kids that get free breakfast at school do so because the parents are too f'n lazy to deal with their own before they head off to work and dump it on the free provider. In my day parents would have been ashamed, but the free for all societyÂ has apparently dismissed any dignity!Â  5 % I feel sorry for, because they truly need the hand out."
1051907,pics,2019-11-03 00:00:00,1268,Did we trigger the millennial?.. go to your safe space and colour..
1051909,cisco,2019-11-03 00:33:00,597,Wayne. Those are the 5% kids I was getting input on whether to try and help. The rest have parents looking out for them. Oh re P3TA ... good joke! No I'm not. I've killed many critters sometimes in tough weather. Some here know I diver duck hunt. Oh and I'm not a narcissist either.
1051914,chris.brock,2019-11-03 02:54:00,4053,"even as an adult, I love Halloween, for the kids, for the getting together of neighbors, for the community I'm against the grain here I don't like Montreal for NHL and political reasons, but I like their Halloween call, john tory is too much of a generic, politician, robot to ever make a call like that as it turned out here in Oakville, the weather wasn't that bad, lol, and it was a great night"
