One for fishing and cooking and the other for sleeping. Always on the fish. Perch, pike, ling and a few pickeral."

1052325,jimmer,2019-11-12 21:02:00,2730,"My suggestion is to find a place that has you stay in a cottage with all the amenities, then have them take you out to your hut for the day.  Much more comfortable after a long day of fishing, more room to spread out and you can even have a shower.  I don't find night fishing that great through the ice."
1052326,Fisherman,2019-11-12 21:31:00,7201,"Bear Creek Cottages and Ice Fishing, they have both options, sleep on ice huts or stay in nice cottages with day huts."
