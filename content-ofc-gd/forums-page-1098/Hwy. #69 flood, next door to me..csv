149590,walleyejigger,2008-01-10 18:29:00,876,"my old man went thru yesterday morning and the water was over his hood, cops were directing vehicles 1 at a time, he just got home now and said he came back thru again this morning no problems, but a big sign saying the road is closed is still up south of point au baril but plenty of traffic goin thru"
149592,GbayGiant,2008-01-10 18:34:00,1780," Ha, yeah he did, I'll still take him out fishing , I never herd from him after he fixed the starter but let him know in the spring if he wants and you too if you feel like it. Whether or not we find a musky is another story   Thanks. I'm not sure why it flooded,  obvious factors was the amount of snow we had this year and 2 days of heavy rain and wind, I've only been here for a few years but a old local told me the only time it flooded before was a 1953 hurricane. Wouldn't that be nice if you didn't have to walk the whole 50 yards to the LCBO, lol, boat through window.      OK the road is open again guys as of around 5am, I guess when the heavy winds died down the water leveled out, the water on the road is gone. The gas station is still under ice but the traffic is fine on 69.."
149598,Big Cliff,2008-01-10 18:59:00,6899,"Thanks for the update, that will make life a lot easier for quite a few people."
149603,irishfield,2008-01-10 19:09:00,26272,Thanks John!
149605,Cast-Away,2008-01-10 19:38:00,790,"John, do you know Eldon, the manager of the LCBO? Him and I grew up together south of Parry Sound."
149634,fishindevil,2008-01-10 21:00:00,6254,"WOW..what a mess,they were showing lots of areas on the news today about all the flooding up that way !!!!there sure is going to be lots of damage when all this is over,and now they are going to be getting a storm with lots of snow & rain,i think its going to get worse before it gets better,i hope nobody is hurt or trapped by floodwaters....."
149660,GbayGiant,2008-01-10 22:02:00,1780,"No problem guys, looks like the weathers calling for colder temps again so hopfully it's back to normal for a gradual melting spring.    Yeah, great guy, I've had a couple people ask me about him he's a popular fella."
149295,GbayGiant,2008-01-09 19:07:00,1780,"The creek next door to my parents store flooded out and the hwy is closed, it's around 4 feet deep across the road, my parents are lucky they are up on a hill off to the side but the liquor store gas station and bait shop are all in trouble.   Here's just looking from my parents driveway on a little hill.           The Gazebo by the liquor store, floated over there from the other side of the gas station.       Now I'm just waiting for a muskie to jump."
149296,Grimace,2008-01-09 19:14:00,2020,"Holy cow.   That looks like the liquor store and gas station near the cut off to Alban.   Am I correct?    Never good when a gas station floods, thats for sure.  glad to hear your store is out of the muck"
149298,GbayGiant,2008-01-09 19:20:00,1780,"It's in Pointe au Baril, past Parry Sound. Yes, I hope the gas doesn't leak into the water Gbay is rite behind the gas station. It will be interesting to see if it freezes over night because so far no pumps or any man power is being used to get rid of it."
149303,tonyb,2008-01-09 19:39:00,1637,Yikes!  What a mess...if it freezes it is going to be much worse.
149306,misfish,2008-01-09 19:48:00,29133,"Gas in the water????????? I wouldnt be buying gas from that place for sometime,water in the gas.   What a mess."
149308,wuchikubo,2008-01-09 19:57:00,1114,Now that's a reason why people should prefer gradual heat up slow melts than sudden heat during winter. I hope it doesn't affect the local environment too much.
149315,mistyriver1,2008-01-09 20:25:00,600,"Yeah I recognize that area.  Yikes, were those taken today John ?"
149317,GbayGiant,2008-01-09 20:31:00,1780," Yup, just a few minutes before the post, I was the first photographer on the scene, I was going to email the pics to the news paper, lol, but I decided to come to the great OFC community first. I think a reporters down there now taking pics."
149329,fatherof3,2008-01-09 20:52:00,1769,"wow,what a mess"
149340,JorgeCarlos,2008-01-09 21:10:00,109,"I have been there,what a mess!!!"
149341,Big Cliff,2008-01-09 21:25:00,6899,"I've made many trips through there, the last one on Monday afternoon. What a mess but as long as no one gets hurt, the insurance should cover the damages. Glad to hear your parents are OK though."
149352,snag,2008-01-09 21:58:00,1932,One of my favourite places.  Hope the LCBO is not too soggy.  Did the grocery store across the street survive? They were kinda elevated.  Best to head north to Larry's for a drink and avoid that soup!
149356,irishfield,2008-01-09 22:22:00,26272,"John... can you let us know when the highway reopens. Sister in law needs to get thru there on Friday. Thanks, Wayne  Wouldn't be buying gas at the shell anytime soon!"
149387,Raf,2008-01-09 23:41:00,3495,glad you werent affect negatively.  i am hoping to get through there friday too.
149425,Rattletrap2,2008-01-10 01:30:00,1652,"Gas Station, Liquor store,...and Bait Shop affected????? Might as well shut the town down! What else is left? Glad to hear that your parents place is ok."
149430,Joey,2008-01-10 01:39:00,9122,"Wow, that's going to be a mess to clean up.  Thanks for the pictures.  You getting the boat out now  Joey"
149437,Bernie,2008-01-10 01:47:00,3190,That much water should bring up the lake level a little bit anyway. The rivers around my area are sure flowing hard. Lots of road closures as well.
149449,moemoe,2008-01-10 02:36:00,352,"Ah well, that shell's gas price was always 6-7 cents higher than anybody else, drove me nuts, it's a shame about the lcbo though......"
149472,discophish,2008-01-10 04:03:00,392,"Hey John.  Thanks for sharing the images.  I hope all of the business aren't overly affected from this flood.  Good thing your parents are elevated.  I have been zooming past your parents house for 32 years now ... and finally see that route from a different angle, unfortunately under water.  I hope the spawn won't be affected in the spring.  I have that gas station to be thankful for when I had a bad kayak accident on the Magnetawan, driving south in the Jeep trying to get to the hospital and almost passing out.  They called me an ambulance and kept my gear and Jeep safe for the night.  I hope they are ok.  Did CC Kennedy go under as well?  ... what drives me nuts is a leaking boat."
149480,GbayGiant,2008-01-10 04:43:00,1780," That's my parents store, we are ok because of the little elevation.   Wayne as of now 11:45 pm, I just walked home from a buddies on the other side and fell knee deep. It got a little deeper if anything and it is starting to freeze but the police and firemen said they will sand and salt it as much as possible to stop it from freezing to much overnight.  I'll keep you posted on this thread, it's not looking to good at the moment."
149481,GbayGiant,2008-01-10 04:49:00,1780," No, it stops just before Kennedy's. I forgot my camera but there is a boathouse in the creek on the other side on the way out that got demolished from the rushing water flowing back out to the bay.  Thanks guys. I'll keep you posted on the road (hwy #69 north), but I wouldn't plan on going this way tomorrow it will most likely be closed again.  When it does open make sure to fill up at Nobel or Shaunnaga station before Pointe au Baril because after that it's a little stretch with no gas stations."
149499,Rich Clemens,2008-01-10 11:54:00,3131,"That's wild ... I travel that road at least once a year, sometime twice."
149543,snag,2008-01-10 14:40:00,1932," Then I've probably met your folks a few times.  Nice people, glad to hear they escaped the flood."
149556,OhioFisherman,2008-01-10 15:17:00,6623,"Dang John! That creek usually wasn`t more than a slow trickle, some kid of blockage from the ice? Global warming means you can now go by boat all the way for beer runs? Store? WOW Last time I was up the only store I remembered was Kennedy`s.  Hope everyone makes out OK!"
149558,bigbuck,2008-01-10 15:26:00,2449,"I thought it looked familiar, I've passed it a few times on the way to LOTW to visit the out-laws. I have a buddy that has a cabin up there and I wonder if this affected his place."
