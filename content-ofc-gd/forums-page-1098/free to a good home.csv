149585,Big Cliff,2008-01-10 18:11:00,6899,I have a couple of down rigger balls (weights) that a friend gave me years ago and I don't use. They have been sitting in my garage collecting dust and thought someone here might be able to put them to good use. They are free to the first person that wants them but you'll have to pick them up here in Lindsay.
