149260,Squid,2008-01-09 15:47:00,1656,"Whew, good to hear that they are home and recovering."
149278,brickNblock,2008-01-09 17:23:00,598,"Joey.... Thanx for the news however horrific...... Charmaine sent her an E-mail this morning as we were just notified of this accident through your post. We have been trying to reach either Chuck or Shell by phone with no luck at all. Most likely they are real occupied.......terrible, rotten news for this family. Please keep us all up to date Joey........again, thanx. PeteNCharmaine."
149402,camillj,2008-01-10 00:22:00,1988,"Sorry to hear, I just got back from Muskoka .... the fog was terrible up there for the past few days.  Hope everyone makes a full and speedy recovery !"
149418,Crazyhook,2008-01-10 01:10:00,1154,my thoughts and prayers are sent
149423,Rattletrap2,2008-01-10 01:19:00,1652,"Hoping for a speedy recovery for all three of them! Glad to hear they are alive and on their way to mending.  The seat belt thing is a big one. My Oldest Daughter was involved in a serious wreck this past spring. We received the call that a mini van had tried to pass her on highway 10 on the soft shoulder doing over 100km per hour! The van rolled several times and threw three girls from the back seat out onto the road. The male driver and passenger were wearing seat belts, but the girls were not. To my knowledge one of the girls and the driver have not come out of a comma to this day.  My daughter was thankfully not injured and was only very shook up from what she saw. I know how it feels to go to the scene and see 4 air ambulances circling over head and not being able to reach our children. Very sad.  Godspeed in their recovery."
149511,Shelley Cooper,2008-01-10 12:27:00,394,"An  update on Justin...  Justin is still in the Toronto hospital.. they have done an MRI and have put a back brace on him.  They want to see if this will take enough pressure off his disks, to allow them to heal.  He will have to stay a couple more days and if all goes well, he'll be going home with an aprox. 4 month recovery period.  If they don't feel he is healing with this back brace, in the next couple days, he will have to have surgery...  It will be another couple days before we know anything more...  Dustin and Chandelle are still very sore and i think still in shock, but they started moving around a little yesterday.. and that can only be a good thing....  Thank you again to everyone for your thoughts and prayers....  Shelley...."
149513,lew,2008-01-10 12:37:00,12767,Thanks for the update Shelley and hopefully the brace will be all Justin needs to fix him up.  Good to hear the others are coming along better now too.
149571,motv8tr,2008-01-10 17:19:00,2587,"Thanks Shelly, I'm hoping the brace does the job and he'll be up and about again in no time.  Glad to hear that Dustin and Chandelle are slowly on the mend as well.  Maureen"
149949,Shelley Cooper,2008-01-11 21:46:00,394,"UPDATE....  Justin IS HOME,      just a short while ago.. but he's home.. in a back brace still and hopefully it will continue that way until he is FULLY healed ....  Thanks again to everyone for their thoughts and prayers...  Shelley"

149967,wuchikubo,2008-01-11 22:39:00,1114,That is really great news. Wishing them all a smooth recovery!
149073,Shelley Cooper,2008-01-08 19:21:00,394,"My son and his girlfriend were brought home this morning... They are banged up pretty good and will take some time to heal, but they are alive, and they will heal... The police say they are very lucky to have survived such a terrible accident and come out of it as well as they did.  Justin, the friend in the back seat, is still in hospital and being transferred to St. Mike’s in Toronto to see some specialist’s for his back.  He has cracked vertebrae and they are worried it is moving towards his spine.  He will more than likely have to have back surgery.  But he too is alive and thankful for that…He seems to be in good spirits, and we are keeping close contact with his mother.  It surely was a terrifying experience for us parents that made it to the scene…. And something I hope I never have to see again.  We are all so VERY thankful that we still have our children…. It could have been so much worse....  Thank you to everyone for your well wishes and thoughts....  Shelley…"

149014,Joey,2008-01-08 15:12:00,9122,"Shelley's son has been in terrible car accident.  It happened yesterday in the fog in Innisfil.  Their vehicle was t-boned at an intersection and then rolled several times into the ditch.  I have just spoken with her again today and she would like our prayers and good thoughts for her son, his girlfriend Chandell and their friend Justin.  Shelley's son has a broken knee and ribs and they are worried about his lungs being punctured, Chandell has a broken leg, a concussion and stitches to her right side, which was pretty beat up, and their friend Justin, who was a backseat passenger (and was not wearing a seatbelt) was thrown around the vehicle and may have a broken back.  He was unconsious at the scene.  I will update you as I hear from her.  The accident was on the 6 o'clock news last night on A-Channel.  There is a snippet of it on their website for anyone interested.  Joey"
