149933,Sinker,2008-01-11 21:00:00,8692,"Does anyone put anything on the poles of thier portable  huts to make them slide open/close better?  Mine seems to get harder and harder to slide every year. Last time I had mine out, I had to pound on them to get it down. Now the bolts where it connects to the sled are starting to bend a little. Its not a real big deal, but there must be something I can put on there....  I've sprayed them with WD-40....but it didn't seem to help much.  Any suggestions?  Sinker"
149936,irishfield,2008-01-11 21:07:00,26272,"All WD-40 does is dry stuff out. Great for ignitions..terrible for lubing anything. I'd try either ""spray lube"" (blue label/red cap at CTC) or some silicon spray."

149939,danbo,2008-01-11 21:21:00,2646,"Use sandpaper & steel-wool to clean off the oxidation (on the male ends,) then rub candle wax on 'em."
149940,Guest skeeter99,2008-01-11 21:21:00,0,get a candle and rub them down with wax and while you are there do the zippers to and will have no more ice up  works like a charm  u might want to pull them out first and sandpaper them a bit to clean up then rub wax on them will not ice up or rust up
149944,misfish,2008-01-11 21:43:00,29133,"Well after the report back from my bro,I,ll be spraying my poles with dry grafite.  A little rust hurt nothin aslong as you treat it right.  Grafite is the ticket here Sinker. It lubes and will not allow adhiering."
149945,Sinker,2008-01-11 21:43:00,8692,"Right on....I'll try the wax. Should have thought of that myself.....duh....  I did the sandpaper already, then sprayed the wd-40 on the male ends. It didn't do much, but like IF said, wd only dries stuff up......thought maybe they were freezing a bit in there......guess not.....just too dry I guess.  Wax it is.....I'll let ya know how I make out...  Thanks for the info!  Sinker"
149948,misfish,2008-01-11 21:45:00,29133," Wayne, Wayne, Wayne,IGNITIONS?????????? Very bad. It is very explosive that WD-40. Guess you had to be there as my  mustang went ka plooy. Or is that ka powyLOL"
149950,Sinker,2008-01-11 21:46:00,8692, Graphite eh.....hmm.....  I have no rust.....they're galvanized poles.....just don't want to slide to well for me this year.  I have lots of candles......well...the wife does ......I think I'll try that out and see what happens.  Can't make it any worse I guess.....  Sinker
149952,misfish,2008-01-11 21:49:00,29133,"Galv still gets a bit of rust particals. Dont kid yerself.  If Justin is reading,I sent him a can of the stuff. Must of worked.LOL  Who ya go,na trust,a counrty bumpkin or a brother from the rock. L M A O"
149963,wallyboss,2008-01-11 22:33:00,1095,I use candle wax also. but now I have 2 of my poles that if I am not carefull they come right out when I am opening it up. I also used the wax where the seat slides on.
149975,JustinHoffman,2008-01-11 23:02:00,482,"Hey Brian,  Yep, Justin is reading...  The can of graphite you sent worked well for the two-man hut last season. For some reason, that hut had some real issues with the poles being very stiff and not sliding. I actually took along a rubber mallet to help in the process when times were very tough!  The new one-man hut has no issues with the poles.....but I'll be saving that can for other things for sure.. (thanks again, bud..)  Good Fishing, Justin"
149981,Guest skeeter99,2008-01-11 23:12:00,0,i guess that is why we should all buy clams(fish traps) all aluminum tubes on mine you just breathe on it and it is up or down!!  my 2 cents
