149138,danc,2008-01-08 23:47:00,4677,Geez. I thought that you had a date lined up with Paris Hilton or something.  Two years ago I saw a mosquito in January up here Gerritt. No go and get them worms!!!
149139,Riparian,2008-01-08 23:51:00,269,"My father has acres of land that makes more money contracting it to worm pickers than he does cropping it. Its incredible how many large earthworms are out there at night, you go out there with a flashlight and you can litteraly see hundreds just darting everywhere. and they dont seem to be bothered by the light its vibrations of your footsteps that cause them to flee.  free bait is right."
149150,linweir,2008-01-09 00:45:00,202,Guess steelheading is good this weekend. Bring some worm.
149154,FISHINGNUT,2008-01-09 00:58:00,253,I was just about to post the same thing noticed them on the driveway while out for a smoke.My son and I just gathered up about three dozen in 20 min.Iam going to save them for the perch if we ever get the ice back
149155,drwxr,2008-01-09 00:58:00,453,"use red light, worms cant see it. and yes, be very silent on the ground."
149163,Mike the Pike,2008-01-09 01:14:00,3421,Well I remember picking up worms last year at this time but there is 3 feet of snow remaining in my yard.Ah you Southern folks
149169,HTHM,2008-01-09 01:31:00,4082,"But, how long will they last in the fridge?"
149172,kickingfrog,2008-01-09 01:36:00,8333,  Only a nano second after the wife finds them.
149174,kickingfrog,2008-01-09 01:39:00,8333,"Three days ago I had drifts of over a metre in the back yard. Today, grass and over a months worth of dog crap."
149175,irishfield,2008-01-09 01:39:00,26272," I had the same container of worms in the fridge from May 16th 'till I released them in the garden in October. Lively as can be. Just don't let them get loose into the krisper tray and lettuce...or you'll be in kickingfrogs ""boat""!"
149179,FISHINGNUT,2008-01-09 01:44:00,253,Thats why I have my own fridge in the workshop BEER and BAIT
149331,LeXXington,2008-01-09 20:56:00,1928," LOL, I told my wife needed to get the fridge for the bait thats how it was approved by management,, The beer was just a nice perk"
149378,Canuck2fan,2008-01-09 23:14:00,1444," Just go to Crappy tire and grab a bale of the fabril worm bedding food basics to get some distilled water. The worm bedding has food for them in it. You just wet it down with distilled water drain it well. Keep the worms in it in the fridge and they will last for 2 or 3 months easy.... if you notice them not doing well just add some of the worm food from frabil to the mix.  I have tried lots of different methods but the frabil worm bedding is the best because the worms last forever in it. Also it isn't soil and therefore it doesn't get all over your hands and reel when you are fishing like the ""dirt"" from the commercial beddings when you buy worms."
