149773,steelhedrmatt,2008-01-11 10:43:00,278,Is the launch useable? Thinking of dragging the boat up on Saturday.
149774,misfish,2008-01-11 10:44:00,29133,"I,ll have a check and get back to you.  Im pretty sure they are open."
149777,steelhedrmatt,2008-01-11 10:53:00,278,"That would be GREAT!! It's either Simcoe or Quinte. Cant sit around the house all weekend, plus I start holidays today"
149780,misfish,2008-01-11 11:38:00,29133,"The Tiffin st launch (RAMP) is clear,but there is ice chunks floating around in the water. You should be able to launch. The Marina is froze in with UNSAFE ICE."
