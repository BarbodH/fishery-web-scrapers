Go to your local Home Hardware and pick up the ""two for one"" coupon from their customer service. I just did. Much better deal (in case you are not going alone) than the $3 off if you buy tickets online. And the $3 off expires today anyways where the Home Hardware coupons are good at any time during the show. I may see some of you there  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
