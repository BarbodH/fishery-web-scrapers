149637,kickingfrog,2008-01-10 21:10:00,8333,I do remember them. Le barons used to have them in their catalog (I'm sure many other places had them as well).  I have not seen them for a 3-4 years however. Ebay might be an option.

149838,bassjnkie,2008-01-11 17:03:00,1101,Tried ebay with no luck. Skel I figured they were probably crap.  Thanx guys Daniel OCH
149848,Fang,2008-01-11 17:44:00,1330,I bought one and was not impressed with quality for the $ charged. I took it back to Lebarons after it stopped working second time out. It would turn on but you could see the counter not registering when letting out line.   Better off to look for a Daiwa or Okuma
