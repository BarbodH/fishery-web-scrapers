149806,Terry,2008-01-11 14:08:00,14456,"well myself, at times when I am fishing for small pickeral, I  use my 8' TDR rod and a snap swivel and hook it on the planer board and stick it in the front rod holder then I use my light action spinning rod and reel and lightly clip it on the planer board and put it in the back rod holder or even hang on to it... yes I use the 8' TDR rod and reel as a planer board mast on inline planer boards...... it's a little more work, but it make catching small pickeral a lot more fun  I just don't enjoy dragging in something that comes in like a wet sock or less with the heavy duty rod and reels"
149810,Steve,2008-01-11 14:42:00,2075,"I'd go with a nice, light, setup.  7'10"" Shimano Compre Trolling Rod  Okuma Magda 20 reel.  Spend the little extra on the rod (100 dollars) and save the money on the reel (35 dollars, or less)    Hope this helps a bit lew.  Steve"
149638,SlowPoke,2008-01-10 21:10:00,2984,"Lew, just get yourself another Tekota 600LC and you'll be set for two rods on LSC this year as well. Buy a pair of rods for the 'eyes and swap the reels over. TDR 8' M or MH Daiwa Heartland 8' M or MH Both are around $30 each -Brian"

149671,fishindevil,2008-01-10 23:00:00,6254,"Well lew there has been some awesome information here for you from everyone,but i was just thinking if you only do walleyes a few times in the year,you should consider a set-up that is ok,and not overkill for walleyes yet still enough power to use for those ski's.....that way you will get good use out of it,lots of guys use their salmon rods for walleyes too,but sometimes the rods and reels are a bit much,and you loose your sensitivity,as they are meant for salmon as oposed to walleyes,i have several medium combos that will handle both quinte walleyes yet still ok to use for salmon,and its amazing to get big salmon on a nice walleye setup,you sure get a good fight...so good-luck with whatever you go with....cheers    oh ya and lew what ernie said might not be a bad idea,and almost all my combos for that reason are around $150-300 bucks, just remember to get a reel with a line counter as its a must,to run crancks at the proper depth,with the trolling bible !!!!!"
149799,Cookslav,2008-01-11 13:32:00,1457,"I have the same off shore board complete with the tattle flag upgrade and it works great....unless its below freezing It tends to accumulate a bit of ice, rendering the Tatle flag pretty much encased in ice, and rather useless. But the boards still ran good. (found that out on my December misadventure to Merlin Park  )  I use a med/Heavy 7.5 foot Izumi series Shimano rod & a 5000 series Shimano spinning reel....nothing high end but I've had no issues with the set up what so ever. Its got enough Backbone, and its not really over kill either, so there is still some play to the fish.  Have fun with the new toy!"
