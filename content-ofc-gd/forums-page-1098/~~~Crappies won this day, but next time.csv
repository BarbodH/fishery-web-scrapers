Started out great crisp morning air as we walked out about an inch of snow over 5"" of black ice and 4"" of frozen slush. Got to our usual spots had WD started punching holes, I set up in 28', and marked phish just off the bottom, while WD move over 32', and also marked some phish, but only received some very light taps. MoonstoneRick joined us and, betweem him and WD they punched hole al over the area going from one hole to another Runnen and Gunn, MR was the first to put Crappie on ice, and the 2nd, 3rd. 4th., finally this 3/4lber took a liking to my minnow  and shortly after MR was able to put another on the ice before he had to leave  But the weather was turning sour and the phish weren't helping so we packed up and headed home . I had 3 phish on, landing 1 WD had about 6 land landing only 1 very small one while MR out did us, with 5, keeping 2. It was great to meet up with MR, whoI haven't seen since the last M&G on this lake, great seeing again bud, hope we can get out again this season. As alwys it was a great time phishen with WD, and his son Karol, who was a great assist helping me pull my hut out and back in. Going to keep an eye on the weather I'm a thuken it's Perchen time, next weekend"
