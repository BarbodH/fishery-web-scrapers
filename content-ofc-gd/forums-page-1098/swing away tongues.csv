149185,silveradosheriff,2008-01-09 02:12:00,1025,Love mine...is the only way I can get the boat in garage! Mine was from the factory - I believe Aaron Shirley knows a welding shop not far from you that does retro fits.  :-)

149212,icefisherman,2008-01-09 06:09:00,952,"I installed mine month ago. Got is as part of the package with my new boat. It is Fulton and of very good quality. No way to fit the boat in the garage without it. Easy installation - cut the tongue, drill few holes and bolt in the swing tongue....Dealer didn't want to install it for liability reason, so I did it myself.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

I had saved this article just in case.  http://www.bwbmag.com/output.cfm?id=1141615   By the way, I LOVE my swing away tongue....my shins have never been better.  FT"
149552,Silver Tracker,2008-01-10 15:01:00,12,I believe the Tracker Marine Shop at BPS has them or will install  I call BPS before the thaw looking for an auger and was told they were completely sold out- Went to the store late in the day - they had maybe 200 of them  I bought it from Le Baron instead- I get better service from the small local dealers and most of the time the price is the same or lower
149586,bbog,2008-01-10 18:14:00,665,Fishing buddy has one (a Fulton I believe) and it is sagging noticeably. Don't know if it's a bad install or what.
