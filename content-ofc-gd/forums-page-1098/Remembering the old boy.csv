149878,Ramble,2008-01-11 18:52:00,713,"great post. It reminded me of one of my favourite quotes. ""Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing it is not the fish they are after."" -Henry Thorbeau  It also got me thinking about my grandfather who spent a good part of his life out in the bush travelling around enjoying the country side. He was probably the greatest influence on my life.  They would go for weeks at a time. I dug up this picture of him on the ""Obabika river West of lake Temagami from August 1942."" (that's what it says on the back of the photo)    Great post.  -Ramble On"
149787,ccmtcanada,2008-01-11 12:23:00,7971,"Great post hookset!  And no, you did not sound like a knob.  My father also passed away from cancer that spread to his brain back in 1995.  Your post is timely for me as just this week I visited my dad's gravesite to chat with him about my familiy and life.  Memories are all I have left of my father....I would give almost anything to have him back for 5 minutes so he could meet my wife and his grandchildren....just one time.  I know he'd be proud....he fished a LOT when he was alive and I'm happy that his last fishing trip was with my and my younger brother before he passed.  I also have no regrets....great memories...and that will suffice until we meet again one day."

I think sometimes we just make everything too complicated or fancy. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. Every once in a while we need to be ""tuned in"" again and reminded of what's really important.Thanks for putting things in proper perspective again."
149811,Headhunter,2008-01-11 15:01:00,5703,"Thanks for your post... I lost my Dad back in October and your post brought back so many memories of the man who taught me the value of fishing, the outdoors and so many other things. I suspect the pain of the loss will continue to diminish over time, but the memories will stay forever. Thanks for posting your thoughts, I for one really appreciate it! HH"
149812,bigbuck,2008-01-11 15:06:00,2449,How things have changed!!! Great read and a fantastic tribute to your dad. He's up there somewhere smiling down on you.
149819,1leggedangler,2008-01-11 15:34:00,364,"Competely awesome tribute to your Pops!!! He sure knew what spending time outdoors with the boys was all about. Thanks for sharing.  Cheers, 1leg"
149820,Hookset,2008-01-11 15:35:00,367,"Thank You All Very Much for the replies.  It sure looks like a lot of us are in the same boat when it comes to Family which is no longer with us, and the great memories they left us with.  Thanks again,  Hookset."
149827,wolfville,2008-01-11 16:17:00,396,Thank you man. I live to hope my sons will one day say the same thing. And the memory I leave them with is as beautiful as your old boy does.
149839,John,2008-01-11 17:05:00,2956,"Great post and a great tribute Hookset. You are absolutely right, a lot of us are at that time in our lives where our parents are no longer with us. You put into words what many of us feel and think on a practically daily basis. I for one will try to be some of the things to my grandchildren that my Dad was to me. Thank you......"
