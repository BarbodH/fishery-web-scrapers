149562,Entropy,2008-01-10 16:17:00,747,"Who has Hydro ??  Just got a text message back from my Buddy who lives in Windermere, says he is still without power, I feel for him, he’s a stay at home day Dad, with a 1.5 year old on the loose.  And does some property maintenance for a few million dollar “cottages”.  I guess we lost power yesterday, only for 20 min.  How are you making out?  Entropy"
149563,Terry,2008-01-10 16:19:00,14456,out for 45 min. yesterday good today
149577,Sinker,2008-01-10 17:37:00,8692,"Thank god I didnt lose power, I'd be pumping out my basement right about now!!"
149580,wuchikubo,2008-01-10 17:58:00,1114,"No problem here, never stopped for me."
149581,Big Cliff,2008-01-10 18:07:00,6899,"All good here in Lindsay, a few short bumps yesterday but that was all. Sinker, if you are ever in a jam and need a generator let me know, I work for a rent all place so I can probably get my hands on a rental one for you on short notice and at whatever my boss would charge me for it. (probably free but if not, at a good discount)."

149599,OhioFisherman,2008-01-10 19:00:00,6623,"Just a tip, get a large boat bilge pump and a float switch, 12 volts and may save a flooded basement. You can always take a battery out of the boat or car to run it."
149602,irishfield,2008-01-10 19:06:00,26272,Out for about 5 hours yesterday..but good today!

149633,Sinker,2008-01-10 20:57:00,8692," Cliff,  I will keep that in mind for sure!! TYVM for the offer!!
