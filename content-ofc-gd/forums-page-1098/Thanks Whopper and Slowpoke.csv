The BOQ weekend was not to far away so I arranged with Brian to give his item to Wayne and if I'm not mistaken GCD picked up the item from Phil.  I finally managed to get myself in gear and drive over to Wayne's today to pick them up...a whole 10 minute drive  .  Phil was good enough to give me a compass to mount in the boat so I don't get lost....this is a good thing as it's not hard for me to do   Brian gave me an Eagle Z7500 Sonar System.  I'm hoping a friend of Steve's will help me hook it up and all I'll have to do is fiugre out how to use it  Thanks again to everyone, Brian and Phil for your generosity and Wayne and GCD for helping me get them    Now all I need is for spring to arrive so I can play with my new toys  Maureen"

Hope it serves you well!   PS Thanks to Glen and Wayne, I figured that was the best way for it to get there safe and sound."

149789,motv8tr,2008-01-11 12:27:00,2587,"  Not to worry Glen,I got ya covered, I'll take care of it at Lakair  Maureen"
