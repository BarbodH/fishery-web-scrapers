Went out on Sunday (I know the report is a little late) and fished the entire day. We got there at 6am and ended at 5pm. I manged to land 10 fish, snapped 2 off and lost at least another 10. 6 were in the 4-5lb range and the other 4 were in the 1-2lb range.  One of the fish that I snapped off must of been a monster!! I couldn't even get it off of the bottom and I was using power pro braided line. We were fishing in 29 FOW using chartreuse and silver pimples tipped with 2 muddlers. The action was non stop. As I write this, I keep thinking about the feeling when you go to jig your lure and your rod stops dead in your hand. You know you have a monster on then!!! What a feeling!!! Anyway, here is a pic of one of the fish that were in the 4-5lb range. As a note to the light hearted, there were no gaffs used and all fish were released :-)   "

149943,superdad,2008-01-11 21:36:00,353,You made it just under the wire as the ice has broken up in many places and is totally unsafe - bring your boats for this weekend.  We were out Sunday also for a couple of hours and managed one nice 3.5lber on Little Cleo in 25 FOW with a couple muds.
