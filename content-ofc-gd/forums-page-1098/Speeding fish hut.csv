149453,Bernie,2008-01-10 03:14:00,3190,Heres a video of a fish hut on Nipissing featured on our local papers website. It's a little far away but you get the idea of how fast they will travel.  http://nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=849265
149455,ccmtcanada,2008-01-10 03:16:00,7971,I suppose it's not funny if you are the owner...but then why was I laughing out loud at that sight??? LOL.
149456,Bernie,2008-01-10 03:21:00,3190,Here are some pics as a result.  
149457,Dondorfish,2008-01-10 03:26:00,1000,First picture looks like a redneck pontoon boat!  - guess its not really funny - I wouldn't like it if that happened to my hut.   Don   
149459,Mike the Pike,2008-01-10 03:32:00,3421,ouch lots of debris will be floating on the lake in the spring.Beware
149460,Joey,2008-01-10 03:35:00,9122,"Yep, it sure was windy today.  All you can do is laugh really     Would have been a fun ride if you were in it, til the end part  Joey"
149461,Bernie,2008-01-10 03:35:00,3190,Yes Mike. Maybe enough will wash up on my beach to build something.
149474,speck5,2008-01-10 04:08:00,8,"Actually """"""Trolling"""""" is not a bad idea."
149506,Greencoachdog,2008-01-10 12:08:00,8163,There are easy ways to anchor those huts to the ice and should be a requirement for setting one up. Somebody could get hurt badly by one of those things if they had their back to it.
149512,Terry,2008-01-10 12:35:00,14456,same thing happening around lake simcoe too
149515,ccmtcanada,2008-01-10 12:37:00,7971," Yeah Joey...it's like falling from a building, it's pretty exhilirating until that sudden stop at the end. "
149518,motv8tr,2008-01-10 12:46:00,2587,"Yup, saw the same thing on Penetang Bay yesterday morning...one might have gone in the water, not sure though.  Maureen"
149519,pikehunter,2008-01-10 12:53:00,1659,Maybe he was trolling
149632,fishindevil,2008-01-10 20:56:00,6254,"Well i guy i know that lives right on lake scugog says,yesterday with all that wind storm,there was huts blowing everywhere and there is several he can see that are smashed to pieces,and lots of debris everywhere,there is going to be lots of guys looking for their huts this weekend and they just wont be there,as well as ones that are smashed to bits!!!!!!!...."
