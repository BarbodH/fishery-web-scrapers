149412,Nater,2008-01-10 00:54:00,68,"Thanks woodsman for being realistic...We don't live in a perfect world that everyone seems to think we do.  Anyone here watch the news?  You shouldn't have to lock your doors but when you leave them open I mean come on how can you not expect something like that to happen eventually?  It's sad but it's REALITY.  As for your statement about not being constructive I would do a search, I did a lengthy positive post about rod building and a few positive comments on different reports.  You can't trust anyone these days and you sure don't need to give people reasons to commit crimes  Nate the negative nelly"
149413,Bernie,2008-01-10 00:56:00,3190,Hey Bill . I know how you feel. I had an ATV stolen from me about 10 years ago (No key in it). My heart sunk because I had just purchased and finished overhauling and was ready to go deer hunting. No insurance was on it yet.....Geeeeez. I'm still mad as hell when I think about it. Some low life dude never did get caught because I never did get it back. Yet some here say thats the way society is and its your fault it happened.?????? Something is terribly wrong with that statement. Its sad we need a key or a lock for anything really.
149414,PERCHER,2008-01-10 00:58:00,787,I dont understand it sounds like your saying its the victims fault.And it does not matter if your doors are locked or not they will get in if they want.
149417,FishFinder,2008-01-10 01:07:00,481,For once I totally agree with Nater. Your mother left her purse with cash in an unlocked car???? What exactly was she expecting? This rant is the dumbest i have seen here in a while... Should be a harsh lesson learned for you and your mother Bill. Next time hopefully you will know better.   Try telling your insurance company that.
149420,Nater,2008-01-10 01:13:00,68,"If there was nothing in sight and the doors were locked I HIGHLY doubt they would bother breaking in.  If they did I'm sure they would have stolen the car not cash or valuables etc.  Couple of guys at my highschool got arrested last spring for doing the same thing.  Stealing cell phones, sunglasses, change etc, it was pretty big news at school.  They got off with a slap on the wrist and ahd to return what they had stolen, which I think is rediculous I'm sure there is a worse punishment that they should have received.  I highly doubt they would have broken into a locked car where they couldn't see anything valuable worth taking.  I think it's terrible that people will do things like this I'm just saying if you leave things unlocked, the reality is that it's more tempting for the scum to tamper with.  Nate"
149426,Woodsman,2008-01-10 01:31:00,1286,"Daplumma/Joe When I used your quote I had enough respect to use your quote in whole as writen. ""Nothing added"" or ""nothing deleted"". When quoting me in the future I request you show me the same respect. When you delete parts of the quote or add text within the quote you can create false impressions. As for your question(inserted within my quote) I said ""Not saying it was your or your mother fault but it was not unexpected in todays society."" In other words, ""although you left it available to take it still should not of been taken. Just don't be amazed if it is"".  Rick"
149428,Bernie,2008-01-10 01:35:00,3190,Woodsman I believe that reply would have been best in a Pm. Out of respect.
149429,Nater,2008-01-10 01:37:00,68,Because Daplumma showed everyone else on here the same respect right?  Nate
149432,Driftin,2008-01-10 01:42:00,1,"And im sure that moron is at home counting his money calling you a dumb @ss for not locking the doors, just a easy grab and there gone. Not a safe world with lollipops and sour gummy bears with a chocolate fountains where the billy goat drink from their jr. You just had to learn the hard way"
149436,Woodsman,2008-01-10 01:46:00,1286," Bernie: As the mis-quote was made on the open forum I feel the reply should of also been there. As your reply was also made on the open forum, I will respond here also. I believe that Pm's should be kept private but open forum correspondence should be open and accurate. If I'm sent a Pm, I respond by Pm.  Rick"
149438,Roy,2008-01-10 01:48:00,13728,"Sorry to hear about you Mom's problem, Bill.  Take it private guys."
149371,Gerritt,2008-01-09 22:51:00,6129,"Tough pill to swallow for sure... You live in a nice area (I know first hand) and you have to deal with crap like this....  I would say with 99% certainty it is someone that lives close to you... Given your location.. It would not be someone from the other side of town for sure... It could even be someone that lives in your complex....  Sorry to hear about bad things happening to good people... Although I joke around alot your Mother, Brother and yourself are good people...  Perhaps this is a bit of a wake up call for your mom...? might make you guys think twice about leaving valuables unattended..   Nater... yet again you cease to amaze me in just how inconsiderate you are... this seems to be an ongoing issue.... perhaps people are like yourself on the Steelheading Elitist Boards? that carp dont wash here..  Bill... I know you cant do the Feb trip... but if you wanna hookup for the day and hit some hardwater lemmie know!  G"
149373,addict,2008-01-09 22:53:00,475,"i too have been robbed.before i got underground parking i had to leave my pickup parked in a lot downtown oshawa.ocasionally the crack fiends would rummage through my stuff.the first time they got my cds after that they got nothing because i left nothing valuable.but this was mostly my fault the truck is 20yrs old and im sick of fixing stuff the drivers door broke a few times handles,locks window winder so this time i said screw it now i leave it unlocked its too old for resale and like i said i dont leave valuables in it."
149375,huntervasili,2008-01-09 22:58:00,1604,"Thanks Gerr... We'll hook up for sure... I appreciate most all of your comments lessons have obviously been learned. Nater, If it makes any difference which I am sure it wont, Please avoid posting whatsoever on any of my threads, I have yet to hear a constuctive comment from you, I will give the same courtesy"
149386,FUSION,2008-01-09 23:39:00,81,"Be thankfull all that was lost was a couple of dollars. When I came out of Costco about a year and a half ago all that was there was an empty space were $75k was once sitting. Locked door, Alarm, On-star didn't do a wrong word thing. If they want it they find a way around it, thats what the cops told me anyways...  FUSION."
149398,Woodsman,2008-01-10 00:13:00,1286," Daplumma: Your response to Nater's post above is by far more "" the dumbest statement I have have seen here in a while"". Although I wish you were correct, Nater's statement reflects reality. He was only stating the obvious. Provide a thief an opportunity & it will be jumped on. As an former military person also, I know how barrack room justice was used to good effect, but times have changed. It won't get too far in the military any more & will sure backfire on you quick on civy street. I agree with your advice not to dwell on the scum. But remember to cover your butt & don't ever bend over, or some scum will not think twice of screwing you. Wish it wasn't so, but that's not reality.  Bill: Don't take this wrong as I am always disturbed when things like this happen. As you already said, lessons have been learned. It should not ever happen in a perfect world but we do not have a perfect world. Not saying it was your or your mother fault but it was not unexpected in todays society.  Best Wishes: Rick"

149406,PERCHER,2008-01-10 00:45:00,787,Bill I am sorry to hear about what happened.Your right there is a alot of loser around.Their just to dam lazy to find work and just find it easier to steal from those who do actually work for a living.I have no use at all for people like that.Just dont worry buddy the old saying what goes round comes round is true.People like that always get theirs one way or the other.Just dont let it be you that gives it to them.Because people like that are not worth it.
