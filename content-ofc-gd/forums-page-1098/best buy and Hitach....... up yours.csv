I haven't seen much on the TV that is worth spending that kind of money   on that everyone is   talking about. It's bad enough paying the cable bill!  $500 bucks just for a bulb! WOW! I was in the Home Depot in Bronte just before XMas. Right inside the front door was a pallet of 27"" TV's for $99 bucks each! I will continue to ignore the newer technology as long as possible. For 99 bucks you don't even need to concern yourself with an extended warranty!   I have an Aunt and Uncle that may have the best solution...not even one TV in the house!  Best of luck on finding a cheap replacement bulb."

148972,Big Cliff,2008-01-08 11:57:00,6899,"I bought a 37"" LCD Acer about a year ago at the Source, $1200.00 and we love it! Our house is open concept and there is a big window with lots of light that use to reflect off our old CRT TV and at times it was hard to see the screen. The LCD doesn't have this problem at all so it was perfect for our room. My computer moniter is also an Acer LCD and again, I really like it. I have had no problems with either."

I would not be too worried if I bought a Sharp, Toshiba, and Panasonic.  If the manufacturer's Warranty expires less than 2 years you may want an extended.  Consumers Reports doesn't recommend extended warranties because they believe with most electronics  problems will occur within the first year.  For newer type TVs, Check the Warranty and the Repair frequency in Consumers Reports when and if they print them.  Stay away from RCA, not a good history"

148997,Headhunter,2008-01-08 14:10:00,5703,"i refuse to even look at anything made by Sony, much less purchase it! Sony outsourced the manufacturing and assembly of their products to the lowest bidder early this decade. They are now no better than any of the other southeast Asia sweat shops manufacturing equipment for the world market. Have you ever tried to get Sony to service their broken down pieces of junk? Good luck! Now, not to hijack this thread, but Clampet, you need to open your ears and listen to some audio equipment make by an audio specific company, you will be amazed at what you've been missing in your music all this time. It's like the difference between buying a Canadian Tire special rod and reel combo and buying a high end rod and reel! HH"

149048,Abberz,2008-01-08 17:10:00,140,"I feel you pain.  I used to work for an affiliate of best buy.....I'm sure you can guess which one. PSP is joke. Sales associates will go as far as lying to sell you on their plans. With the high turnover in retail sales the associate who sold you your Tv probably doesnt even work there anymore. They are paid 15% commission on that 500 plan and roughly 75-100 commission on the tv, therefor they can double their salary if they can get you on the PSP plan.  Here's the catch too, if you are a sales associate not selling PSP to 15-25 percent of your customers....GOODBYE....so thats why people lie and so on.  Knowing what I know now.  Don't pay to fix something that isn't broke when its brand new. The $500 PSP would have paid for the new bulbs....which do go from time to time....it usually is based on usage. With electronics if they are going to have problems they usually go within the first year which is generally covered under manf. warranty.  Conclusion dont ever buy PSP."
149059,KyleM,2008-01-08 18:06:00,218,"When I moved out west in August we purchased a 42 inch Toshiba LCD...no probs yet.  3 weeks ago I purchased another accept Plasma this time and it was an LG.  The Plasma has much better picture although it gets ghost images very easily.   They were both fairly cheap.  Toshiba 1400, LG was reg 1900 and we got it for 1400. The trick is to wait for sales, I never pay full price for anything.  I also told them to shove the 3 year deal up the ying yang.  The place I shop out here (Visions) has a great program. If you purchase the extended program and never end up using it, they give you a store credit for what the program is worth."
149099,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-08 21:32:00,2585,well 30 years ago you bought a tv and it lasted 30 years lol.  today you buy a tv and it lasts a few years  Good thing they have come down in price!  however they sure dont last that long.  I have a 42 inch samsung and its been great but i was warned that the bulb may go on it as well so its not just the hitachi its all of them.  Cheers!

149678,Dutch,2008-01-10 23:27:00,831,"Home theatre has been a passion of mine for going on 2 years now.  Ask questions before you buy - the sale associate would have probably known the PSP did not cover bulb replacement (hopefully).  Never, ever buy PSP - they make waaayyy too much off them for what they are worth.  Every website you read says to stay away - so stay away.  Brings me to my next point - do your research.  DLP's and RP LCD's many times have a bulb setting, kind of like high, medium, low - have it set on low or medium and you will get longer bulb life.  Calibrate your TV - the first thing you should do is take it out of ""torch mode.""   Reduce your contrast and brightness setting they are usually set at 100% and 75% respectively out of the box.  A properly calibrated TV should be, in most cases, set at less than 50% in contrast and similar in brightness.  I love this stuff and read Home Theatre websites and forums daily - PM me for advice on anything HT related.  One last tip - DON'T buy expensive cables - they make no difference at all.  The same $150 cable costs $10-$15 online."
149708,danc,2008-01-11 01:19:00,4677," The only time that it's not good is when you never use it. I had my entire ""light engine"" replaced just over a year after my factory warranty was up. Basically, the ""light engine"" was the complete inside of my tv. I bought new, unproven technology when I bought my $2000.00 DLP. So I was comfortable buying the psp. And it paid off.  To say ""Never, ever buy PSP"" is just wrong. It's an insurance policy. You don't buy house insurance hoping that your house burns down and you can cash in. There's 2 ways at looking at it."
149751,John Bacon,2008-01-11 04:00:00,3277," I figure that I have saved several thousand dollars by not buying extended warranties on anything that I buy.  I have yet to have to replace or have anything repaired during the period that would have been covered by an extended warranty.  Even if I do eventually have to replace one or two items that would have been covered by an extended warranty, I will still be ahead of the game by not having paid for extended warranties on anything that I buy.  The only time that an extended warranty would have come in handy is for my oven.  It still works except for the self cleaning feature.  I have a wife so not having the self cleaning feature really isn't that important.  Certainly not worth the cost of the warranty.  I would say that if you never buy extended warranties will almost certainly come out ahead of the person who does buy them; even if that other person does ending up using them on a couple of purchases.  This is especially true of high tech items; you will probably be able to buy something better for less money in the 2-4 year period that the extended warranty would cover."
149755,Dutch,2008-01-11 04:26:00,831," Definitely like buying insurance - who likes to throw away cash on auto insurance and house insurance each year when you never have a claim?  The only difference with a PSP is that you have a choice to buy it - with home and auto it is not a choice.  I guess we can agree to disagree - my opinion is that in the short and long run PSP will cost you more than not buying them.  I always laugh when I remember the time some guy at The Source tried to sell me a PSP on a disposable $10 pack of AA batteries - that's right batteries - for the bargain basement price of $2.99.  The only thing about buying a PSP is you can get a lower price on your electronics purchase is you agree to buy one.  Their policy states you can return the PSP within 30 days.  Get the lower price and voila, money saved and refunded when you return it within the 30 days.....it's not cheating, it's just being frugal."
149756,danc,2008-01-11 04:28:00,4677," The repair on my tv would have cost around $1500.00. I don't buy psp for everything. In fact I've only bought it for 3 things ever. Two of the three things have had to be totally replaced. I guess that I'm a smart shopper. But to say that one should never buy psp is wrong. Like anything else, you have to do your homework. I'm way ahead of the game because of it."
148879,bassboy,2008-01-08 01:08:00,161,"  All depends on what you consider high end.......if you are talking best buy and future shop high end.....well.....they arent even high low end.  Last year I went to purchase new audio equipment......and all the affordable stuff I listened to did not compare to the 25 year old mid fi Sansui system I got in my late teens. That system cost me almost $3000 back then, and it was by no means hi end. Unless you spend $5000 for a Bryston 875HT or something along those lines, well.....you arent getting your moneys worth IMO.  And yes....you CAN tell the difference. My wife could hear the difference between her 5 year old JVC $1200 unit, and my 25 year old middle of the road unit. So what did I buy?  Believe it or not I scoured Epray for another 25 year old Sansui, though a higher end unit at the time. And you can tell the difference between the 2 25 year old units.....in fact the differences are quite stark even though they are from a similar era.  All boils down to how much money a manufacturer wants to spend on the technology, and these days, its not much.....most of the affordable audio nowadays lacks any tonal warmth of the equipment of yesteryear. And if you want to go one step further and talk Vaccum tubes thats a different beast altogether......hit one of the rooms at Bay Bloor radio one day and see.....you will be amazed.  And since I am in a very noisy environment 9 hours a day (Steel fabrication shop and yes, I wear hearing protection 29dB's worth LOL) and I can still tell the difference, I would LOVE to see the what the difference is if my ears were good  LOL Like I said......all boils down to the outlay the manufacturer wants to put into manufacturing and components.....not very often you see equipment thats manufactured like this any more:    Not just applicable to A/V stuff either.....seems there is an epidemic of 'throw away' stuff any more.....drives me nuts!!  Anyway.....sorry for the rant  :blahblah1:  ......just wanted to add my 2 cents worth.......cant help out much in the video department, though the 33 inch Sony CRT  we bought last year is fantastic, even if it does weigh 175 pounds and we almost couldnt get it through the door    Bill"
148932,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-08 03:56:00,957,"Hey bassboy, I got the Sony CRT 34"" (194 pounds) November 2006 and got a second one three days later.  I'm pleased with both and they came with a two year warranty, which I read.  Close out prices were good also.  I thought a CRT would be good to get at a time when they should be perfected.  As good as they are, they can't make Ohio State University look good against L.S.U. right now."
148938,bow slayer,2008-01-08 04:45:00,1074,"well searching around  and talking to a repair tech these bulbs usually last about 1-2 years normally something about using all the gas inside the bulb..Funny how the best buy sales guy never mentioned that,spending 3-400 every 18 months on a bulb. Also there is a class action suit against Panasonic for this very reason. It seems there bulbs are needing replacing every year or sooner. Nice spend 2500 on a tv and then spend another 400 a year to keep it working. It is almost like the manufactors want the TV industry to go the way of the small appliance industry. Make cheaper products to the point where it is cheaper to buy new than repair. Just imagine the landfills in 20 years full of microwaves,toasters,dvd players and now maybe tvs. I wish I couild buy a 50 inch old school tube."
