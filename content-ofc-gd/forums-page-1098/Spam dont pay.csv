149620,Terry,2008-01-10 20:09:00,14456,"that wa why beyond spamming, but he needs to do lots of time  and internet crimes need to be dealt with  a big hammer"
149645,BLACKFISH88,2008-01-10 21:36:00,191,I don't know about you but I don't open email from people I don't know although what he did was wrong why shouldn't the people who opened the emails be punished as well because if everybody opened those emails and you can tell when they come what they are. For example I get the penis enlarger emails and these so called stock emails and the email addresses are usually ridiculous nothing like that of what normal people make their email addies. They are the dumb ones who opened them.
149658,misfish,2008-01-10 21:55:00,29133,Does it really work

149716,GbayGiant,2008-01-11 01:40:00,1780,"Oh man, I get at least 20 Viagra ,hoodia, casino sites and penis enlarger spams a day. I feel sorry for anyone nieve enough to pay these idiots or open the attachments but obviously there are many people who do or they wouldn't be sending so many emails to the world.  Maybe I should quit surfing through all the pr0n sites."
149737,BLACKFISH88,2008-01-11 02:35:00,191,The wife isn't complaining
149740,danc,2008-01-11 02:53:00,4677,Does spam still exist??? I haven't seen any in ages.
149758,snag,2008-01-11 04:41:00,1932, Classic!
149792,Corey,2008-01-11 12:41:00,355," What you fail to notice is that the spam does cost people money. There are millions of small websites which are only allocated a certain amount of bandwidth. Once that is exceeded there are additional costs. If you are a small business owner and your website costs are increased because of spam coming to your email address, you are gonna be cheesed off. Sure spam filters work fairly well these days, but they work after the mail has been delivered to your mail server, which means the bandwisth for the spam on the way in is costing you money. I am sure if I came to your house and plugged in to a 120v outlet on the outside of your house you would complain, simular situation."
149801,Headhunter,2008-01-11 13:48:00,5703,"I was out of the office for two full weeks during the Xmas holidays. After sparking up my computer at work, I found 956 messages in my in box.  About 35 were real messages. I hope they set a real example for this dude... but alas, I doubt it! HH"
149804,mcallister.grant,2008-01-11 13:59:00,327,Internet fraud costs Canadians millions every year. The unfortunate part is that a majority of it comes from the middle east from individuals in refugee camps. It's almost impossible to track.
