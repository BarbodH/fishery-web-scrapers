149444,Woodsman,2008-01-10 02:05:00,1286,I live about 50 mins east of there. All rivers in this area are very high & muddy. I suspect both rivers are also very high & muddy also. The area's between where I live and these rivers have been getting even more rain than here. I'd be very amazed if the rivers will drop a lot or clean up much by the weekend.  Best Wishes: Rick
