149704,irishfield,2008-01-11 01:04:00,26272,Bad assumption if you didn't also purchase the copyright from the artist.
149709,ccmtcanada,2008-01-11 01:29:00,7971,Hey TJ....Here's a male in spawning colours....  
149731,Roy,2008-01-11 02:18:00,13728,"Cliff, I think TJ was more interested in the fish."

149769,Spiel,2008-01-11 10:01:00,9065,....This would have been a great shot of DanC's hand if the Brookie hadn't got in the way.  
149776,misfish,2008-01-11 10:47:00,29133,  Maybe there should be a warning added to this thread this morning. I think there will be a few coffee spitters this AM.  Good one Roy.  All nice fish BTW.
149779,steelhedrmatt,2008-01-11 10:58:00,278,How do I reduce a photo's size. Seems all my pics are too big
