149385,buckster,2008-01-09 23:37:00,530,So with the ice being so questionable anyone thinking of hitting some local tribs.   Do u think that the water is clearing up yet?   Should be lots of fish around?
149391,rhare,2008-01-09 23:55:00,387,first thing that came to my mind!   the rivers are raging right now around my neck of the woods but the weather looks good for them to clear up by next week. Lets hope the high water brings in some chrome.
149392,Canuck2fan,2008-01-09 23:55:00,1444,"Around here I don't think you could actually find the tribs as the rivers are over their banks by about 30 feet in most cases. If it doesn't precipitate too much more I am thinking, hoping for Saturday to be awesome fishing."
149401,solopaddler,2008-01-10 00:16:00,8605,"Depending on exactly where you're fishing, steelheading has already been phenominal this week  . Every river is different and each will clear to fishable levels at a different rate. The next 4-5 days will be spectacular. Choose your destination wisely..."
149404,rhare,2008-01-10 00:37:00,387,   cant wait to see some reports mike
149410,buckster,2008-01-10 00:52:00,530,gonna try my luck out east... see what happens
149450,kemper,2008-01-10 02:53:00,2232,"Hooked a few high water bows myself between the time the ice was out and the water turned unfishable...which was about the span of an hour and a half.  No pics because i was alone and the cell phone cam was inside my pants pocket which was under my waders.   Look for a report later this week, I expect the steel to be on fire in my area friday/saterday"
