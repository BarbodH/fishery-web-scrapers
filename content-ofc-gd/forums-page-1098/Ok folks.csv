149688,Roy,2008-01-11 00:16:00,13728,There's a tornado (Eliza) going through Alabama...Taladega County to be more precise. That's right over Glen's (Green Coach Dog) head. The warning sirens have just gone off at his place. Maybe a few well placed powerful thoughts in his direction might help. Thanks folks.
149691,Whopper,2008-01-11 00:23:00,2174,Thanks for the heads up Roy!  I'm thinking here
149700,Fisherman,2008-01-11 00:54:00,7201,"Hoping for his safety, big thumbs up."

149703,irishfield,2008-01-11 01:00:00,26272,"Ah.. Glen will get out one of his sibakie (sp) rig specials, on 100lb PPro, hook that bugger in 4 spots and hog tie it before it finds his house."
149711,Greencoachdog,2008-01-11 01:34:00,8163,"Thanks for the good thoughts y'all!!! The Tornado was diverted and passed to the west of me on a NNW track! Wasn't really worried about the house, truck, or boat... just as long as my precious fence came thru unscathed!!!"
149725,Dondorfish,2008-01-11 02:04:00,1000,Hey Glen - Glad to hear all is well.  Don
149739,Daplumma,2008-01-11 02:46:00,1961,"Funny,my first thought was that you was gonna be ticked if that fence gets knocked down! Joe"
149752,ecxstriper,2008-01-11 04:04:00,343,DID the goat house come threw ok ?
149753,douG,2008-01-11 04:15:00,2693,Glad all is well with the Dawg AND the fence.

149759,douG,2008-01-11 04:43:00,2693,Great to hear from Glen after that scare.  Those January twisters have always been the worst.
149765,troutologist,2008-01-11 07:41:00,951,Glad nothing too serious came of it. my fence took a tumble into the neighbors yard. Serves him right from being downwind I guess. An unexpected job come thaw. Sunfa gun wind....

149772,misfish,2008-01-11 10:42:00,29133,  Glad to read it all worked out.  Sometimes it ok for a man to click his heels together and say those magical words.
149786,ccmtcanada,2008-01-11 12:14:00,7971,Phew!  Glad to hear the tornado changed directions.  It must have seen you without a shirt on and hightailed it away!
149788,Greencoachdog,2008-01-11 12:24:00,8163,  No... but that's a good idea for the next time one is in the area!... and a damn good excuse not to wear any clothes at all!!!  Stay tuned for my next fishin' report!!!
149796,fishindevil,2008-01-11 13:19:00,6254,"See glen,all it took was for you to take your shirt off !!!!.  ..you might be on to somethin there...LOL..LOL..LOL. we knew that tornado would be scared to death if it seen you standing by your fence with no shirt on cursing & swearing at it !!!!.  ...cheers buddy"

149836,John,2008-01-11 16:56:00,2956,"Glad that all is well Glen. I was flying over top of you yesterday early evening en-route back home. It was pretty rough at 30,000' too."
