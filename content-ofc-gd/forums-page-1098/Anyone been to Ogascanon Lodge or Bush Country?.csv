Both are near each other, and both are actually just over the Ontario border into Quebec, Just west of Nipissing?  Joe K."

Unfortunately for us, we were weathered out and there just were not many places to fish during the inclement weather we endured. Scenic lake, great hosts and good accomodations. Bush Country Camp is very close by on Lake Sasseginaga. I believe Bush Country Camp imposes his own walleye max length limits that can be harvested while at his camps. You can fish Sasseginaga without those restrictions by staying with the other outfitter on the lake - Lake Sasseginga Outpost - see http://www.sasseginaga.com/  Do a search here on OFC or on walleyecentral.com for more comments from fishermen who have visited these lakes. Our group has fished Lake Kipawa the last 7 years."
