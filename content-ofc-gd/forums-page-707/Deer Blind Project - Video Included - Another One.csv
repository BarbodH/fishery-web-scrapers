445933,Leecher,2010-03-21 19:22:00,7832,"Hey guys and gals.... hows you doing after the site upgrade?? For me was a long process but got through it   Wish I could bring you a fishing report but unfortunately it's hunting related  For those hunting deer and setting up deer feeders..... it's now time to start with the warm weather we've been having.  Yesterday spent a good 10 hours in the bush prepping our hunting area for my brother and I, cutting trees and shrubs and setting up a saline mineral feeder (not sure if this is the right translation  ) in range of our ground blinds and wish I could of taken pics but unfortunately forgot the cam at home  Started to look for a big old cedar stomp that could be easily cut with the chainsaw..... found one, cut it to length and cut a grove in the middle so we could apply our recipe.  The recipe consist of sulfur, bicarbonate, salt and cocaine in powder form..... I know some of you might think drugs but NONONO    not for us but our 4 legged friends.  We also dropped apples that we squish with our boots so that the perfume would escape into the air / environment.  Needless to say... there was a great scent that we could ourselves smell being so close to the feeder and spreading into the wind.  We found several areas with deer dunk which let us to believe that there was several animals around, which is a good thing and promising  We are going to be heading out to the spot in a couple of weeks to check on the progress and also to cut the shrubs that needs to be eliminated in our view from our ground position.... at the same time will be taken pics and will report back from ground control  So stay tuned for some more!!!

446075,Daplumma,2010-03-22 00:06:00,1961,Good stuff but against the law here. Joe
446084,Leecher,2010-03-22 00:21:00,7832, Thanks Joe!!!  We can also do this for moose hunting up here.... just find it odd that it would be against the law down your way
446107,Daplumma,2010-03-22 00:47:00,1961,"No baiting of any sort here.Wish we could to get rid of more of them rats with hooves.The season ends here next week.It started last September,long season and yet there is still an overpopulation. Joe"
446113,Leecher,2010-03-22 00:52:00,7832," Baiting, in your case would make sense if only you were allowed.  Up here we have a short season, riffle that is..... only a couple of weeks, maybe that's why they allow us to bait the area we are hunting. Jacques"
448560,Leecher,2010-03-26 23:11:00,7832,Well guys like my status says..... our deer feeder has been robed      It only took 5 days and the deer had a feast with our recipe  The land owner checked it yesterday and stumble upon a deer that was laying not too far from where I'm going to be setting up my ground blind  I just can't believe that last year we did not see any deer     Mind you the temps were kind of like a yoyo  It's looking good so far and made a detour to Home Depot for some lumber.... going to be starting on the one man blind.... looking to build a 5' wide by 4' deep and 6' high  Will keep you posted on the development Leechman
