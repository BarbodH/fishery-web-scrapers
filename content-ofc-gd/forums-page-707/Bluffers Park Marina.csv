444142,JPD,2010-03-15 22:26:00,296,Does anyone know if the boat launch is clear from ice at Bluffers Park or Ashbridges Bay? I have a buddy with a new boat looking to put some break in hours on his engine.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  JP
444152,myot,2010-03-15 23:12:00,131,Bluffers is open and clear of ice
444157,JPD,2010-03-15 23:24:00,296,"Thanks myot, I really appreciate it!"
444165,Dozer,2010-03-15 23:54:00,896,"Bluffers wide open, the sail club is open too.  Watch out for surfers, I was there a few days ago and there were 6 of them, right outside the boat launch."
444173,JPD,2010-03-16 00:00:00,296,"Thanks Dozer, they'll have a tough time surfing tomorrow with 5 knot winds from the North"
444177,mbac31,2010-03-16 00:06:00,904,I have been launching for a few weeks JP. Good to go. Frenchmans is good to go as well.
444229,castgame,2010-03-16 01:31:00,161,is there fishing this time of year in the marina? pike?
444235,justin elia,2010-03-16 01:54:00,151,"I would be concerned about the debris and stumps.  With all of the high dirty water recently, tell your friend to keep a close watch."
444237,mbac31,2010-03-16 01:57:00,904,"Good point. There is alot of floating debris out there with ths high water. The Marina, you cant fish there without permission from the owners. I go in there but dont do it unless you hav their sweet grace. Lol. Someone tried that a few years back and it went to court I believe"
449770,fish_d00d,2010-03-30 03:37:00,38,"Hi All, I'm thinking about trying for Pike around Leslie Spit/Ashbridges Bay this weekend.  I've never tried fishing in Lake Ontario by boat before. I'm assuming from the previous posts that there are public (free) launches at Ashbridges and at Bluffers Park. Does anyone know if you need a special permit/license to fish in that area?  Thanks in advance"
449785,BFSC Kevin,2010-03-30 05:38:00,1351," Well, I don't think you should be fishing for pike this weekend.. pike season is closed in April for Lake O. You don't need a special license to fish at ashbridges, but you do need a special boating license if you boat in that area. At Bluffer's there are a few signs saying 'NO FISHING' around the boats, but you could fish over by the rocks I believe? Not 100% sure since I've yet to fish there.  O yeah, free launches at Ashbridges and Bluffers."
449804,dsn,2010-03-30 11:25:00,1018,Ashbridges is clear. I was down there few days ago.  dsn
449811,fish_d00d,2010-03-30 12:12:00,38,"Thanks for the info ... was thinking of taking my boat there, but I don't think I'd get a license in time. Plus, as you said, Pike is off-season in Lake O (just realized Lake O is zone 20).  Oh well ... I guess I'm heading to Dunnville for catfish"
