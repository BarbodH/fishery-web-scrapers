Im just wondering if anyone one has an old map of the bay that harold may have given to you on your last visit if you do and are able to scan it, that would be awesome thanks again everyone."

I had one, but I am almost certain that it got thrown out not more than 2 weeks ago, while I was cleaning out our boat.    Sorry about that.  If you are already booked, drop Harold an E-mail.    He may be able to E-mail you a copy of it.  EDIT:  Sorry.  I checked around and I don't have one of Harald's maps."
