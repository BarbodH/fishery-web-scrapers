449345,waterwolf,2010-03-29 03:07:00,556,"fishin solo in a canoe is an awesome way to escape but it does have it's draw-backs. great weather today for tour of the leslie spit today but man,, that one fish kicked the snot out of me!!!!  at first ,,damn snag ,, the weight of the initial hit was so strong and steady it felt like a huge drifting log ,,, wrong !!!  the headshakes and deep continuous runs after that convinced me otherwise. this was a brute.  38in long and 17 3/4girth. this is something i've wanted to do for a long time ,the spit at ice-out,this is why.  dealing with a pike this size in a canoe is one thing ,, solo is another. the winds were light and she was very cold. boatside release seemed impossible with double-treble hook-up but i remained patient and finally got the 2nd set of trebles free of her upper jaw. she was too big to be in the canoe with me so this worked out well. solo fishin' sucks, that is the pic's do.the ones i did get i can't even show,, tech crap!! even my daughter can't figure it out.  so exuse the absence of pic's ,, the comp. has them on file from my camera but for some reason can not upload to this site.  any suggestions before i go to GEEK SQUAD?  thanks"

449384,splashhopper,2010-03-29 11:48:00,2931,I second using www.Photobucket.com  ... easy as pie for this NON geek.
449392,skeeter,2010-03-29 12:41:00,1907,"i agree with photo bucket too. if i can learn it ANYONE can... well except Tracker, he can't figure out where you insert the film."
449427,ehg,2010-03-29 14:54:00,2666,The spit at ice out... used to always do it in the past. There is a ton of big pike there! Luckily with the ice;  then season closing the pike are fairly protected.  Sounds like a great time you are lucky guy
