Cook bacon until crispy.Take 3 tablespoons of grease and put in large stock pot. Chop bacon and reserve. Add leeks and scallions and cook over medium heat until soft and coated with bacon fat. Add flour and cook additional 4 minutes,scraping bottom of pot to keep flour from burning. Add 4 cups of chicken broth,slowly at first to keep flour from clumping. Press  each clove of garlic by squeezing cloves between thumb and forefinger.I wear rubber gloves. Do the same to the shallots. Add Garlic and shallots to pot. Bring to boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes and puree with food processer or blender. Add rest of chicken broth and peppers and bring to boil.simmer 30 minutes until peppers are soft Saute scallops in butter or bacon fat and add to pot. Add shrimp,corn,potatoes and peppers.
