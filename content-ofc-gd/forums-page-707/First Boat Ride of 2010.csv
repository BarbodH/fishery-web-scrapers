448954,danbouck,2010-03-28 00:29:00,4380,Went out with a buddy on Erie today perch fishing. The water was low and murky and we didn't even get a bite. It was nice being out on the water though. We spent the afternoon making a parody fishing show that I am still laughing about. It will be on youtube soon lol.  We ended the day by me falling in the water between the boat and the boathouse   She was a wee bit chilly but I'm still laughing about it! Should have seen my wife's face when I walked in the door with no pants on
448959,skeeter,2010-03-28 00:47:00,1907,one can only imagine her thought. you go out fishing with the guys and come home with no pants on
448960,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-28 00:48:00,1107,Were you guys out front of old cut/PP around 1ish I fished the channels for pike with no luck I couldn't imagine the pain of the shrinkage you went through lol.
448962,irishfield,2010-03-28 00:50:00,26272, Dan's wonderful wife was saddened by same...  
448964,danbouck,2010-03-28 00:50:00,4380, ya we went and tried in front of the pp and then tried St. Williams around 1.
448969,danbouck,2010-03-28 01:02:00,4380,Some random pics from the day        
448979,backbay,2010-03-28 01:18:00,773,"Dan, do you have a handle on how much lower the water is than normal? All these pics and such is pretty worrisome..... Thanks, Chris"
448982,danbouck,2010-03-28 01:20:00,4380,"It didn't seem like much. Maybe 6"". But it was fairly shallow getting out of the channel."
448989,backbay,2010-03-28 01:31:00,773,"Cool, thanks. I'm looking forward to May 1st, but starting to wonder what things are going to look like."
449007,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-28 02:59:00,1107,I'm heading out in a couple weeks for pike I hate perch fishing my father-inlaw gives me all the perch I need. So I can focus on the toothy critters and bucket mouths (when they open)can't wait to get out on the bay.
449008,ohhenrygsr,2010-03-28 03:07:00,947,Very jealous.  I can't wait to unwrap my boat.  It's gonna be like Christmas all over again
449087,Mike the Pike,2010-03-28 13:42:00,3421,Dan you are a true diehard.I won't pick my boat up until mid April.What was the water temp Dan?
449093,danbouck,2010-03-28 13:54:00,4380, 38.5 degrees
449094,Mike the Pike,2010-03-28 13:56:00,3421,Now thats cold Dan I hope you did not get hypothermia.Coldest I ever fished in was 47F.You don't look cold on the water!
449096,Roy,2010-03-28 14:00:00,13728, I've never been very lucky fishing anywhere near PP. I try to stay away from it.  I wouldn't recommend fishing near caca either.
449097,danbouck,2010-03-28 14:01:00,4380,"I don't get cold very easily. On the water, with the top up it was fine. I am always well prepared for such things with blankets, hats, gloves etc."
449098,danbouck,2010-03-28 14:02:00,4380, 
449104,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-28 14:27:00,4399, Thanks for the belly laugh Roy!!
449236,Rizzo,2010-03-28 22:49:00,4754,haha Roy you sick puppy. Dan every time I come on here you've gone fishing! If its not tunnel-burrowing carp its perch on Erie. Good for you on landing the best one of all...a very understanding wife.
449305,danbouck,2010-03-29 01:08:00,4380, Ya my wife is good to me. T.J. still can't figure out why she is with me (neither can I).  I'm trying to make it a habit to go fishing at least 3 times a week this year. Lucky for me the family loves heading out.
449342,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-03-29 03:02:00,160,you had fun right? Thats all that matters
449349,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-29 03:28:00,2050,"Thanks for the report buddy!  I'm going to try to get out next weekend, but if the lake blow's up we'll likely be panfishing one of the local ponds or reservoirs..  Cheer,s Ryan"
