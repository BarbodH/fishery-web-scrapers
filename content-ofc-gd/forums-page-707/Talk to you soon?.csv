448573,Radnine,2010-03-26 23:33:00,1538,Have a great trip! Jim
448574,GBW,2010-03-26 23:37:00,8460,"If there is a report I sure will post about it. It might have to do with golf more then fishing as that's what they do down there...  Look out Tiger, here I come...  LOL"
448576,Roy,2010-03-26 23:43:00,13728," Not too sure you want to be saying that to him, Bud."
448845,GBW,2010-03-27 18:07:00,8460,Oh man Roy... Just found out the kids post was just stocked with some bluegills.
448852,young_one,2010-03-27 18:48:00,620,"Geoff, have a good trip! FLA sure beats Scugog Remember to post pictures when you are back!  - Will"
449003,GBW,2010-03-28 02:48:00,8460,"Thanks Will.  I hope it's better, LOL! I just got the kids a new rod and reel as well (we had one here) and one for myself too for the panfish.  Yee haa, going softwater fishing in 2 days.... (first some golf)"
449285,GBW,2010-03-29 00:37:00,8460,"For those that don't know me, I've got decent size ""mit's"" and use a LG/cadet glove.  Today I took the wife and kid's down to the kid's pond in FLA for some blue gill fishing.  It was a great day even though a nasty cold front and rain srorm blew in.  We fished for just under an hour and we landed a few fish and the bigest was the size on my hand with my fingers spread out.  Fish were caught on worms and micro tubes.  Next time I'll try and bring the camera...  cheers. Geoff"
449428,GBW,2010-03-29 14:55:00,8460,"Hey all.  I hear your guys are getting better weather this week then I am, down in not so sunny FLA.  I found a really cool bait shop the other day called Anglers Outpost and Jim was a solid guy to deal with. He even gave my 1/2 price on a new spincast rod for my kids to use and a few free custom jigs. I sure didn't expect to get that kind of service when I was only spending $20 (not incl. kids rod) is his store.  I'm going to tie on one of those custom jigs later on this week and if they produce like he said they would for the blue gills then I'll be back to buy more as they should lay a beating on the crappie back home.  Well that's all for now, have a good one. Cheers.  Geoff"
