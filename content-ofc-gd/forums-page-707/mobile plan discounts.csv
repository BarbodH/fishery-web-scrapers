Whenever I have a concern I talk with Customer Relations and they usually address it with more minutes, more texts, monthly credits, etc."
449767,drwxr,2010-03-30 03:28:00,453," you're right it it old, because people were bargaining with customer relations all time.Â its just that it's never been worth matching few dollars, but $150 is worth a shot.   i'm not saying read all 400+ pages of posts but you can go back to the link i gave and read the last posts of some people who got really good deals.
