445564,Victor,2010-03-19 20:43:00,1609,
445568,Marko,2010-03-19 20:56:00,854,Hey Vic you comming out with us??
445571,Uncle Buck,2010-03-19 21:06:00,1000,I'm gonna try and make this one... i've got a new quiver i'm itching to try out!!
447683,hammercarp,2010-03-24 18:32:00,964,"Winds out of the south, high of 8, partialy cloudy. Not too bad of a forecast for Sun."
447704,Victor,2010-03-24 19:45:00,1609," Unfortunately no... as much as I want to be out there, I'm 3 weeks away from finishing my undergrad and exams are coming up. The ""put bait in swim, pick up book and study while I wait for a run"" didn't work all that well last term lol! I purposely left my gear at home so I won't get tempted  Good luck to all who plan to attend!"
447830,dsn,2010-03-25 01:01:00,1018,Boy that all sounds like fun. But I won't be able to make it.   Good Luck out there !!    DSN
448703,dsn,2010-03-27 11:42:00,1018,Looking forward to this report. But it might be calling for rain tomorrow.   dsn
448731,hammercarp,2010-03-27 13:25:00,964,"The weather for Sun. Cloudy, high of 9, showers in the afternoon, winds out of the south with a falling barometer. Perfect! See you all there."
448736,dsn,2010-03-27 13:46:00,1018,"  I would love to be there but someone has to ""Stay in the gap for mankind.""  Sorta speaking,  DSN  "
448878,hammercarp,2010-03-27 21:12:00,964,The Around The Bay Roadrace is being held tomorrow in Hamilton. You may want to avoid these streets.  My link
449086,Marko,2010-03-28 13:37:00,854,"How is the fishing guys?? I am just getting ready to leave, had to wait on a friend to finish up his chores so he could join me. See you all in a bit"
449092,danbouck,2010-03-28 13:52:00,4380,
449426,CLofchik,2010-03-29 14:45:00,854,I'm guessing there wasn't much going on?  Stopped by walking the dogs later in the day and there wasn't a whole lot of anybody left.
449480,Victor,2010-03-29 17:50:00,1609,I heard that it was a slow day. I think the only fish caught was a channel cat?  Lorne? Marko? update us!
449481,hammercarp,2010-03-29 17:50:00,964,Unfortunately Ya. Just bullheads. I was good to meet everyone though.
449487,Marko,2010-03-29 18:03:00,854," Yea while i was there nothing was caught, and people had already started leaving. Stayed there until about 3 30 and not even a single hit between 3 of us who were there.  Couple more weeks and there should be fish thick in there"
449491,Uncle Buck,2010-03-29 18:10:00,1000,"We left around 3...  slow day, no carp caught that i was aware of... just small bullheads...  still good to get out and see the old faces again"
449596,hammercarp,2010-03-29 22:08:00,964,Uncle Buck Thanks for the coffee. Since I broke my thermos that morning   you offer was very much appreciated.
436632,hammercarp,2010-02-24 20:32:00,964,Hey Guys The Carp Anglers Group is having a fish in under the High Level bridge at the desjardin canal the last Sun. in Mar. Come on down for some fun and fishing comradery.
436646,Marko,2010-02-24 21:12:00,854,Sweet! Looking forward to that and catching up with fellow carpers.
436765,CLofchik,2010-02-25 01:44:00,854,"You're talking the Carp Barrier right? I'll be by, either to fish or heckle with the dogs.  ""But...they're just carp?!?!"""
436784,Spiel,2010-02-25 02:36:00,9065,"Bump this back a day or two ahead of the day Lorne, I'm likely to forget. Not sure I'll fish but I may come down for a visit. The dog loves long walks."
436791,hammercarp,2010-02-25 02:54:00,964,All right! If you can't fish just drop by and say hi. I will bump this up closer to the day of the fish-in.
436792,fishindude,2010-02-25 02:55:00,220,"Hey, just wanted to inform that the last Saturday in March is the 27th!  Also, what kind of tackle/baits is required to hook one of these big boys? I don't own any specific carp tackle but can probably make my own boilies (do people still use these?) and a 7'M spinning rod, is this somewhat appropriate? I figure if I hook into a real behemoth, I may have some trouble/fun landing it!"
436809,Paully,2010-02-25 03:29:00,712,Perhaps thats a bit early for spring carp.. no?  I've always had better success a little further into the season.. once you see some greenery growing on the ground. The warm water always get them moving.
436824,MJL,2010-02-25 03:53:00,2427," Any tackle will do…Literally.  Over the years I’ve targeted carp using: 7’ Medium action spinning rods, 8’6” & 10’6” salmon/steelhead baitcasting outfits, 10-11ft salmon/steelhead rods, 10’6”-12ft noodle rods, 13’6” steelhead float rods, 11-13ft European match type float rods, 11-12’6” carp rods and 9ft 8wt fly rods. The only rods I haven’t tried are musky outfits.  A few things are constant when it comes to gear: You gotta have a smooth drag on your reel and you gotta play the angles right with the rod.   Currently writing an article on carp fishing for TJ which will go deeper into tackle selection…Just waiting till spring so I can take a few more pics for the article (hopefully I can convince my friend to loan me his waterproof digi-cam for some cool underwater shots).  As for bait, a can of corn and a few slices of white bread go a long way in winter.  In the UK, maggots are also a staple bait for their winter carp fishing.  Water temperature plays a huge role in how active they are.  Chumming heavily in cold water can be the kiss of death in winter.   Hamilton harbour offers a year round fishery for carp.  Some places stay warm enough not to ice over and from what I gather, there are some spots where warm water discharges into the bay.  Find an area which discharges warm water (like the outflow from a nuclear, coal powered plant or an industrial manufacturing plant) and you can have an insanely good day of fishing in -30 degree C temps."
436827,hammercarp,2010-02-25 04:00:00,964,Thanks I meant Sun. Mar.28
436829,hammercarp,2010-02-25 04:07:00,964,"Michael is right. I picked up some bread today at No Frills It's on sale for a buck a loaf. Just chop it fine in a food processor and put it back in the bag, Then squeeze the air out and freeze. Thaw it out before you come down to the canal."
436832,hammercarp,2010-02-25 04:13:00,964,Here's the thing about that swim (spot). The water flowing through there is from Cootes Paradise marsh. It is very shallow and once the ice goes it can warm up fast. It will the supply warmer water to the harbour which attracts fish. We caught carp there last year at that time.
436836,CLofchik,2010-02-25 04:27:00,854,"As an added bonus for this spot the gobies aren't up yet, and there's a few other species around, if the carp bite is slow there's a good shot at decent early season channel cats and the odd trout."
436844,Kinger,2010-02-25 05:47:00,351,"Damn, this would be a great excuse to visit my uncle in Hamilton, hmmmm."
443764,hammercarp,2010-03-14 19:12:00,964,"Just thought I'd bump this up. Lots of water flushing out the system now. With the coming warm weather Cootes will warm quickly and that warm water will flow into the harbour. This will bring the carp to the mouth of the canal. Should be a good turn out and a great way to meet other carp anglers, discuss carp tactics  and have some fun."
443767,Burtess,2010-03-14 19:23:00,901, Thats what I am thinking..... bows may be in that area.  What is the current / depth / water clarity generally like at this spot?  Maybe worth drifting some roe or chucking some hardware for rainbows....  Burt
443778,vinnimon,2010-03-14 19:55:00,2593,The bows will be in the vicinity.Im sure it will be murky.
444053,stela,2010-03-15 18:19:00,4,"Hi All,  I am new to the Carp fishing, I would like to meet some Carp fishing expert and learn from them if that's okay. I am trying to find the location of the high level bridge through Google map but I am not really having any success. I really appreciate if someone can give me the direction from Mississauga to the high level bridge. I am able to find the The Desjardins Canal but I am not sure were is the bridge."
444056,stela,2010-03-15 18:55:00,4,"Hi all,   I have managed to find the bridge."
445036,vinnimon,2010-03-18 16:19:00,2593,There is a set of stairs leadind down from the high level bridge.
445054,Marko,2010-03-18 16:59:00,854," If you are not sure of the location, let me know. I can send you a modified map where the fish in is and of the  parking lot."
445102,stela,2010-03-18 19:43:00,4,"Hi Marko,  I really appreciated if you can send me the modified map."
445333,Marko,2010-03-19 07:58:00,854,"Hope this helps   The red line would be the path from the parking lot to the bridge,.    If thats not correct somebody please do correct me."
445343,vinnimon,2010-03-19 09:56:00,2593,heres another 
445385,stela,2010-03-19 12:38:00,4,Thanks guys I really appreciate that.
