In it was all the pics from one of the best days i've had fishing for smallmouth. Better still was my wife was with me, and after the first small pike hammered her topwater lure right next to the boat she decided she actually did like fishing afterall!  We caught soooo many bass that day, it was a gorgeous hot summer day too, it was early summer 2008...happy memories, i think i might have done a post back then...but i strung all the pics and vid clips together as they were sequenced on the camera...thought i'd share it with ya ....it certainly has me looking forward to summer already...even though there is still 15"" of ice on the lakes here.   ONE OF THOSE 'BEST DAYS FISHING'  <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="""
