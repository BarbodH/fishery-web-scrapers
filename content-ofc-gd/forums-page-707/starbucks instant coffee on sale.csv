(and measuring 240 mls. might be tough as times)  As of yesterday, each 3 serving packet was on sale for a dollar off. Might want to stock up. Not sure how long the sale will last. Available in medium, strong, and decaf."

449387,Governator,2010-03-29 12:17:00,879,"Love starbucks via, I bought the larger pack last time (10-12 packets, can't remember).  Are they on sale too?  I have to pick some up soon regardless."
449406,blue pickeral,2010-03-29 13:41:00,267," I think the larger packs are on sale, but you only get a dollar off the whole large pack. The smaller ones are a dollar off each pack of 3. Don't have the variables here to do the math. Check in store I guess."

449412,solopaddler,2010-03-29 14:00:00,8605, I use it only for camping/canoeing. Believe me when I tell you I take my morning coffee very seriously. This stuff is expensive but tastes exactly like fresh ground. When you're carrying everything on your back and every ounce counts it's good stuff.
449420,bigugli,2010-03-29 14:36:00,6138,"Back when I could go on such trips I never parted with the old tin pot. Still have it, dents and all. Only once did I do without. That was a 10 day hiking trip along the Bruce and we were carrying ABC rat. packs from the Forces as our source of sustenance."

449445,solopaddler,2010-03-29 15:46:00,8605, I guarantee if we manage to hook up for some speck fishing in May you'll be tasting it.
