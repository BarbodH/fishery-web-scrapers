449179,tb4me,2010-03-28 19:38:00,3295,thats cool. But why remove eggs and why clip one fin? sorry for silly questions....
449183,SBCregal,2010-03-28 19:48:00,688,"my guess is for stocking programs, and to identify fish that they've implanted etc to monitor where/when they're caught and all of that.  ryan"
