449493,Warthaug,2010-03-29 18:16:00,30,"So I realise the official spring opening for fishing on the Credit, Humbler, etc, is about 1 month away.  But to say the missus and I have the itch is an understatement - we've found ourselves wandering the isles of bass pro for no reason other than ""it seems like a good idea"".  I know the lower reaches of many TO area rivers are open year 'round, but the question I have is if its worth it?  I know many here are doing real well fly fishing right now - prob is neither the wife nor I fly fish, and we don't have the gear.  So we'd be casting spinners (or perhaps fake ""roe"") from shore.  Is it worth it?  Do we have even the slightest chance?  Bryan"
449497,brifishrgy,2010-03-29 18:32:00,559,stretches of the Credit are open year round ..  with this warm weather coming up the next little while just getting out is worth it .. catching something is a bonus
449498,steverowbotham,2010-03-29 18:32:00,1800," I think the majority of us are ""float fishing"" not ""fly fishing"" The reels look similar but are used for a totally different purpose although a lot of us drift flies under floats.  You can do it with spinning gear too.  Definitely worth it if the conditions are right"

This year will be even worse on our so called ""opener"" because of the early spring.  To answer your question yes it's definitely worth it to try right now. Based on your question and comments you'd be best hiring a guide for a day though."
449513,Raf,2010-03-29 19:03:00,3495,these posts always get me  You can't catch a fish from your couch
449574,Warthaug,2010-03-29 21:12:00,30," While I'm replying to Solopaddlers comment, this is directed at everyone - thank you for your replies!  A guide would be nice, but I doubt the misses is willing to admit she needs help  Bryan"
