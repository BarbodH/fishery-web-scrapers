449090,ChrisK,2010-03-28 13:45:00,2772,Congrads on your first solid encounter with steelhead.Just a little tidbit though... The ones that get off always seem to be the biggest one ever Now that you got your icebreaker behind you and your confidence levels elevated you can now go back to the river with a clear mind knowing that your methods are sound. Thats really half of the battle. The other half is putting yourself in the right place at the right time....  Cheers !
449114,MJL,2010-03-28 14:53:00,2427,"Congrats!  You are now on your way towards, living, breathing and dreaming steelhead for the rest of your life.  There's no cure for it.  You'll be looking at weather and river forecasts on an hourly basis in fall, winter and spring.  You'll fondle dozens of centrepin reels and 13ft float rods in tackle shops convincing yourself that owning 1 just isn't enough and off the shelf factory rods just don't cut it.  You'll never look at rabbits in the pet shop the same way again.  Every bead, sponge, piece of yarn and wine cork you see in your daily life becomes more than the inanimate objects that they are.  You get over stimulated when you see rain and anything emerald green in colour.  You just screwed yourself for life"
