And made that claim.   Second paragraph... at end of the 12th sentence !  Iowa Department Of Natural Resources      yummy !!  So You going give it try?  It's all good news  DSN"

448735,charlesn,2010-03-27 13:38:00,551,"Had a young man visiting from Georgia and he had never seen one before.  Caught one and was offered $20 if he could eat it on the spot.  He tried...  He said he was doing okay until he bit in to the squishy part and the juice flowed out...  lol  He chummed over the side.  Ah, the joys of youth.  I can't see myself eating one, they feel soft and squishy like they are all just skin and guts (aka fishpoo).  I can see why game fish like them, no spines like a perch or sunfish."

448743,OhioFisherman,2010-03-27 13:54:00,6623,"LMAO, soft and squishy? a swimming turd? They even have the color? I did a lot of live bait fishing in the past, chubs, shiners, emerald shiners, bluegill, perch. A soft ray fish like a chub or shiner will get you bit a lot faster that a fish with spines in their fins.  Some inland lakes down here have already been affected my zebra mussels, probably not a good plan to see gobies spread. They can`t be used for bait here either."

448819,Dondorfish,2010-03-27 16:35:00,1000,"  Funny - What about the first guy who said -  "" I am going to eat the next thing that comes out that chicken's azz!"
448922,Twocoda,2010-03-27 23:20:00,4130, i see im not alone with my twisted sense of humour...

449148,Mykester,2010-03-28 17:34:00,241, What about the first guy who tried honey? It takes balls of steel to stick your hand into a bee hive!
449324,gogu392,2010-03-29 01:48:00,142,"I have eat fried gobies 35 years ago, somewhere in eastern Europe. I was a child at that time. They are indeed very tasty. Actualy the gobie was the first fish that I fish/catch in my life. They are a pest for Great Lakes but are not considerate so in their native habitat (Caspian & Black Sea). It is very easy to catch them, just a piece of meat (worm, mussel, salami, s.o.) in a small hook and fish on. The fish is realy agresive, the fight is good for the relative size of the fish. Enjoy."
