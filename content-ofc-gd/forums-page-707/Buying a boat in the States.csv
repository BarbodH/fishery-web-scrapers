449089,Mike the Pike,2010-03-28 13:44:00,3421,You should be talking to Joey and Tybo.
449107,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-28 14:34:00,4399,"  I didn`t realize they bought their Lund in the States, I am sure there is still a bargain or two left but with dealers importing truck loads of boats the pickin`s are getting a little slimmer."
449128,Gerry,2010-03-28 16:10:00,257,"Bringing it across is easy, just make sure you have all documents in order and be prepared to prove the purchase price. You have to pay the taxes at the border. As to where to find deals, well that depends on what kind of boat you're looking for...bassboat or walleye boat.....new or used? Walleye Central is a great place for used walleye rigs and my Ranger was acquired via that website. I sold my previous Triton bassboat through BigFatBass.com. There are plenty of deals but you still have to be fair to the seller. Good luck."
