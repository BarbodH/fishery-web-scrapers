449070,bassman87,2010-03-28 12:32:00,586,"DAM carwins got insane power behind those lunchbox hands. He didnt even lean into those uppercuts and he laid the bamboozlements on mir. And that dan hardy is one tough cookie, did you see how hard gsp cranked on the armbar and kimura and still he didnt tap. seriously, gsp needs to move up a weight class and test himself, the ww division has no test for him."
449082,Mattones,2010-03-28 13:05:00,587,I watched the last match on the internet for free. I always seem to walk into a link that is hosting it on one of my forums.  Its lile Justin.tv or something.  Great fight BTW! I swear  Hardy is rubber!!
449101,Cudz,2010-03-28 14:08:00,2652,"Bocek got robbed.  Carwin is legit and I can't wait for the Lesnar fight. If JDS can gain about 15 to 20 pounds he might challenge as well. Since GSP lost to Sera he fights the way he knows he can win, without taking the risks that used to make him such a dynamic fighter.  At 170 he is overpowering and still too fast for other fighters and he knows this and uses it.  He has found a winning formula at the expense of his former excitement (that is just my opinion).  He is still a head above everyone in WW division."
449102,Terry,2010-03-28 14:15:00,14456,"I don't know how he didnt tap man the thing was bent, Hardy is tough. GSP is the man"
449116,trevy727,2010-03-28 14:54:00,351,  now we're talking
449122,steverowbotham,2010-03-28 15:25:00,1800," The kimura wasnt locked in properly, he never had the shoulder isolated, he needed to lift it upwards and in closer to the body.  The armbar though, I dont know how he didnt tap"
449132,pike slayer,2010-03-28 16:20:00,1177,"carwin destroyed mir, i thought that was gonna be a close fight to the death but nope not even a chance for mir. i cant wait to see carwin take on the lensar. the Gsp fight with hardy was LAME!!! what a boring fight!! come on gsp FINISH a fight! i want to see gsp lose with some guy on top of him finishing him with a ground and pound just didnt want hardy to do that hes to cocky but one strong bugger!"
449224,Lunatic,2010-03-28 22:35:00,536,"well, not too bad, gsp/hardy was boring, gsp dominated hardy on the ground but barely put a bruise on him. went to the judges and not 1st round TKO's like 90% of the planet predicted. carwin wins ground n pound ref stoppage."
449232,trevy727,2010-03-28 22:43:00,351, What do you mean not too bad? you only predicted one out of two correctly. I'd say that sucks.
449238,misfish,2010-03-28 22:52:00,29133," LOL  Hardy was never a threat from the begining.GSP was in full control.Heck he was even watching the clock to see what else he could do to Hardy.I know GSP really wanted to take him out,but like he said,he made some mistakes.Rematch,Im thinking so.Still the same results. But,I for one, will give Hardy full credit for hanging in there.Man that arm was stretched,but like Steve said,not set the right way.I was expecting more from the bad mouth,but hey,talk is cheap. As for Mirs?????????????? I knew Carwin had hands,but to take Mirs that fast?????????? Mirs,what next,drop down a wieght? LOL  Brock will set Carwin straight in June.   Did get a laugh from Brock teaseing Carwin.  It will be a great bout Im sure."
449269,steverowbotham,2010-03-29 00:08:00,1800," Brock turtles when he gets hit, not a smart thing to do against Carwin.  Hard to say how that fight goes... Mir drop down in weight?  Hell no, he'll be in the top 5 Heavyweights in the UFC for a long time."
449271,misfish,2010-03-29 00:13:00,29133,"Top 5??????????,NUMBER ONE, IS ALL THAT MATTERS. Long road back for him.IMO    I havent seen him ""turtle yet"" Maybe you been watching to much, WWF.LOL"
449273,Terry,2010-03-29 00:17:00,14456,yeah but Brock was a newbie and he looks twice as good with each fight
449277,BillM,2010-03-29 00:27:00,17367,"Carwin needs to get past the first round with Lesnar.  After that, Brock will gas and it will be all over."
449330,Lunatic,2010-03-29 02:08:00,536,"LOL, 50% ""sucks"" wow talk about sour grapes.  to be honest i was pretty sure gsp would win,but i gave a good chance to hardy who everyone here and on my facebook counted out, and not only counted him out they had him out in round 1 or 2. hardy will be back and his ground game and take down defence will be better. gsp fight came to quickly for hardy.  btw i not only predicted carwin win,but they way he won,and i said gsp/hardy would go to the judges.  not bad!!!! eat it."
449341,bassman87,2010-03-29 02:52:00,586,"Come on guys, let's grow up. It's all just our opinions. We sound like a bunch of couch critics with our panties in a bunch."

449460,steverowbotham,2010-03-29 16:31:00,1800,"  If Mir can make Lesnar turtle up and look away, he is in for a world of hurt against Carwin... just sayin"
449476,Lunatic,2010-03-29 17:30:00,536,"i dont see lesner turtle in that clip? unless you think turtle means avoid the stand straight up and get boxed in the face?  lesner like gsp want the fight on the ground and stand up is there weak point. expect lesner to want the carwin fight on the ground asap,or end up acting like a hotshot like mir, and we saw how that turned out."
448796,Terry,2010-03-27 15:44:00,14456,prelims are on spike tv then the show is on PVV you need to pay or download it off the internet the next day or 2

448815,Mike the Pike,2010-03-27 16:27:00,3421,George St.Pierre it will be a tough one but he will remain champ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
448825,richyb,2010-03-27 17:06:00,774,GSP- MIR ( if he can dodge the keg sized fists and get in close) ... Too bad Alves is out. I was thinking Alves vs Fitch would be the fight of the night.
448831,bassman87,2010-03-27 17:13:00,586,"Yeah, it's a shame to think that there's a possibility his career might be over. All his fights are always entertaining"
448844,steverowbotham,2010-03-27 18:04:00,1800,"Carwin is NOT the best striker in the heavyweight division!  He has heavy hands no doubt, but that doesnt make him the best striker  Junior Dos Santos, Cheick Kongo, Cro Cop, Gilbert Yvel are among the elite strikers in the division.  As for Demian Maia beating Anderson Silva, crazier things have happened, but if you think the same guy that got BLASTED by Nate Marquardt in under a minute is going to get through Silva's range and beat him on the mat, you've got another thing coming. Anderson Silva is also a black belt in BJJ and even if it does go to the mat, he is good enough to at least nullify Maia while punishing him with elbows or forcing a standup, and trust me, the referees will look for a standup"

448854,misfish,2010-03-27 19:00:00,29133,"After what I seen last Sunday,Junior Dos Santos is fast, and hits a ton. Thats power."
448873,Mykester,2010-03-27 21:02:00,241,How is groping another man for 5 minutes a sport? Or punching him in the face when he's down?
448877,Terry,2010-03-27 21:10:00,14456,well compared to figure skating....LOL or curling  bowling  I guess to each their own
448879,Jigger,2010-03-27 21:14:00,1237,"You guys are dreaming if you think Kongo, Cro Cop and Yvel can be considered elite strikers. Kongo is like Carwin. If he catches you, you get hurt. Look at what he did against Buentello. Would you consider Buentello ""elite""? Doubt it. Kongo wanted no part of the stand up there. CroCop and Yvel were once upon a time considered among the best, but those days are gone. Dos Santos has VERY good hands and would be the only guy on that list that may even be considered a top tier striker. Velasquez is very close and is,IMO, a more complete fighter then any of them. Junior/Cain will be a great fight!  As far as tonights event, I have GSP being a little too good for Hardy. With a but...Hardy is much closer in size to Georges than any of the other WW that GSPs faced in the recent past. His boxing is also more convincing. GSP is going to bring the best we've seen and, as long as he doesn't get caught too often, will prevail. 3rd Round TKO.  Carwin hits Mir. Mir wakes up sometime next week.1st Round."
448885,steverowbotham,2010-03-27 21:34:00,1800," Elite strikers are never elite strikers in mma because there's too many other aspects of the game to worry about.  When Yvel and Cro Cop were in K1 they were incredible, in Pride they were also very good but how many ground fighters did Pride really have?  Japanese promotions are about entertainment, not sport, you get carded for a lack of action now and wrestling is frowned upon.  It's a different game.  I would hardly even call Dos Santos an elite striker.  He's an excellent boxer, but would not do great against an elite boxer and we havent even seen him throw a kick that I can recall.  And Kongo, I wouldnt call him an ELITE striker but he is an excellent striker.  You need to look at the Buentello fight from Kongo's point of view.  He's fight a one dimensional guy and he is coming off of 2 straight losses.  Another loss could put him out of the UFC and with 4oz gloves, one punch could send him packing.  He chose to fight a smart fight against Buentello.  I'd have wrestled him too."
448887,steverowbotham,2010-03-27 21:38:00,1800,"   How is hitting a ball with a piece of wood a sport?  How is kicking a ball into a net the size of a canadian tire a sport?  MMA has athletes that train harder than almost any other sport, there are so many aspects of the sport to train."

448902,canoeing north,2010-03-27 22:25:00,12,"GSP- MIR ( if he can dodge the keg sized fists and get in close) ... Too bad Alves is out. I was thinking Alves vs Fitch would be the fight of the night.   I agree , the Alves and Fitch fight would have told us alot .  You gotta love our Canadian Boy , his work ethic and abilty to keep focussed with all his success , a true champion . There is alot of good compitition in his weight devision , alot of talent on the way ( ANTHONY JOHNSON )and alot of talent that he has already defended . I think that as long as his head doesn't get to big ( which I don't think it ever will ) and he and the Greg Johnson camp stay together , he will be a champ for along time . He takes every opponent serious now, and trains as hard as any true champion and ambassador to the sport . When you have the best teacher and student in the game it will be hard for someone to beat . I was in a bar in Cobourg for his Fitch fight and people were yelling GSP during the entire fight card starting at 10pm until his fight at midnight . It was a great atmosphere , espically with the champion being from Canada and living just a few hours down the road . It seems like every time GSP fights he looks bigger , faster and has something new to offer , I wouldn't be surprised if he has been working on his punch power as it would be quite fitting to see him ""knock out"" the ""knock out artist"" just to show everyone how complete a fighter he really is . Go GSP Go !!!!"
448908,bassman87,2010-03-27 22:45:00,586,"LOL at valesquez being a good striker. HHAHAHA the guy has no power in his punches, even he knows that."
448913,steverowbotham,2010-03-27 22:56:00,1800, Tell that to Nogueira  Cain has excellent striking and puts together great combinations.  He may not be a power puncher but he is an excellent striker.
448928,bassman87,2010-03-27 23:39:00,586," I love Big Nog, one of my favourite fighters of all time. But sad to say I think he`s taken too many shots to the head. He looked sloppy amd hesitant to exchange. His chin is nowhere close to what it used to be. I want to see Caains next fight, if he stands and bangs with someone like JDS Ill eat my words.  IN OTHER NEWS, GOT TICKETS FOR UFC 114 IN VEGAS TODAY. Rashad and Rampage is gonna be an awesome fight."
448932,misfish,2010-03-27 23:50:00,29133," Lucky you.Enjoy.  I,ll take Rashad in that one.Jacksons a hot head and a   If you look at the back ground of alot of these fighters,Crocop comes to mind here.He,s a professinal body gaurd.Could you amagine if he could use all what he knows in the octigon? Grab yer head and snap it off.LOL"
448936,bassman87,2010-03-27 23:55:00,586," Thanks, me and a co-worker has a conference to attend on may 27. so we just gonna stay for the weekend. tickets went on sale today and we got decent tickets for 600 for the pair. Will be an awesome weekend. Yeah cro cop shows no emotion at all which makes him even more scary"

449022,pike n' whities,2010-03-28 03:35:00,131,"I dont know much about carwin so im gunna say mir is winning that one.  For the main i would deffinately go for GSP!  going to the gym and sparring with your buddies is actually a great stress relief though! work your way into some MMA (not like full on knee flying stuff though haha!!!) who knows, maybe i'll need the skills one day? i think its the next best thing to fishing. which of course is the top stress reliever. just wear a mouth guard..... chipped teeth aren't fun."
449025,misfish,2010-03-28 03:43:00,29133,WRONG
449028,pike n' whities,2010-03-28 03:50:00,131, what 'r you talkin about cracker?   well maybe it'll be a close and interesting one.... i havent seen either one of them fight much so who knows.

GSP vs Hardy  It will be GSP all the way.He will knock Hardy down,then pick him up, and knock him around more.Hardy has the same potty mouth as bisbong.Typical trash talk.HARDY,WHO HAVE YOU REALLY BEATEN TO BE HERE???????????????   Mirs vs Carwin  If Mirs holds back and waits for an opening,Carwins going to knock him out.Ya Mirs has put on wieghtLOOK HOW BIG I AM (yea,to TRYand look big ,like Lestner LOL)Im taking Carwin,,,,,,2nd round.Be generous here.   No matter who wins,they got to meet the the man in June.I pitty the one that wins this one."
448611,pike slayer,2010-03-27 01:20:00,1177,GSP will destroy him! will be a blood bath! i have a few buddies that flew down to new jersey to watch the fight tonight! lucky pricks! although for semi good seats $350!!
448616,steverowbotham,2010-03-27 01:33:00,1800,"Mir is a far more technical fighter than Carwin, he will be faster on the feet, smarter and his jiu jitsu will give Carwin fits on the mat.  I like Carwin and I'd love to see him KO Mir, but Mir takes this one IMO  GSP and Hardy.  GSP by Ground and Pound TKO in Rd 2"
448617,trevy727,2010-03-27 01:35:00,351,"I agree... GSP will win easily, 1st or 2nd round. Who has Hardy beat? Mike Swick? Marcus Davis? He couldn't even finish them. Oh, he knocked out Rory Markham. Ohhhhhhhh, big deal. I hope George knocks him out like Henderson knocked out Bisping. Another loud mouth.  I also agree with Carwin winning. He's big and strong and good. Knocked out Gabriel Gonzaga, Neil Wain, Christian Wellisch, and submitted Carlton Jones. All he has to watch out for is Mir's Knee bar or whatever he does with the legs."
448618,bassman87,2010-03-27 01:37:00,586,GSP - too obvious Mir - a hungry and determined frank mir is scary
448620,misfish,2010-03-27 01:43:00,29133," I dont disaggree Steve,but,when you know yer up against a guy that you know ,can take yer head off with one swing/punch,it,s a hit or miss match. I,ll stick with Carwin on this one.  It.s an interm match,really means nothing."
448621,trevy727,2010-03-27 01:43:00,351,"  I think Carwin is much scarier than Mir. He's 265lbs and pretty ripped. Mir is only 240lbs and a little chubby. Don't forget, Mir lost to Brandon Vera who is a light heavy weight now. Couldn't stay up at heavy weight. I know, it was a while ago (2006). I hope it's a good fight."
448626,misfish,2010-03-27 01:52:00,29133,"Mirs is looking ahead of the game, to fight Brock.  This alone,will be his down fall.   Exactly  trevy727."
448627,BUSTER,2010-03-27 01:52:00,1336,gsp/mir
448640,Cudz,2010-03-27 02:35:00,2652,I would like GSP to win and as long as he doesn't get caught he will win. Mir Carwin is not as cut and dry.  Carwin has heavy hand but lacks the experience of taking a fight the distance.  Almost all of Carwin's fights last about a minute.  He hasn't truly been tested.  If it gets out of the first round my money is on Frank.  If Carwin wins then he is the legit #1 contender.  I love the fact that the HW division finally has some talent with 5 solid fighters.
448642,Cudz,2010-03-27 02:37:00,2652,"WRONG!  Mir is now fighting at 265 and in the best shape of his life.  240 was old Mir.  Watch the weigh ins.  Read This! The UFC 111 weigh ins are complete with one fighter not making the required weight.  UFC 111 weigh ins were held at 4 PM EST at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.  Main card fighters Georges St. Pierre and Dan Hardy came in at 170 pounds for their welterweight fight tomorrow.  The UFC 111 weigh in featured two heavyweights that both made the maximum weight allowed in the division.  Frank Mir and Shane Carwin both weighed in at 265 pounds today for their interim heavyweight fight.  With Brock Lesnar out due to an intestinal problem for the last year, a decision was made to fight for an interim belt.  The winner is rumored to have the next fight against Lesnar for the heavyweight belt."
448657,steverowbotham,2010-03-27 03:04:00,1800, He weighed at 265 for the Kongo fight too.  He's been working with a powerlifter and gained 25lbs in muscle mass since his last fight with Lesnar
448664,Lunatic,2010-03-27 03:35:00,536,"I have been following the ufc back when gracie was running it and my pick percentage is pretty good. i am a fan of both hardy and GSP so the outcome will not upset me, but because everyone has GSP to win, i am picking Hardy to win. i think he is under-rated big time. but GSP is smart.  this one will go to the judges and it will be a split decision for Dan Hardy.  Mir and carwin is another tough call,but im going to give it to carwin. i think it will be a ground n pound stoppage by the referee.  mir wants brock so bad and is on a tear and even put on the pounds,but his focus on brock looking past carwin will be his downfall, plus carwin has a good chin."

448683,Lunatic,2010-03-27 06:06:00,536,Funnier things have happened. did anyone see the shogun/machida fight? anyone?  guess we'll all find out the results soon enough.
448694,Terry,2010-03-27 10:30:00,14456,"I think this may be GSPs hardest fight, Hardy is a real good fighter but GSP seems to have a new talent in each fight....  I hope it's a close fight"
448708,bassman87,2010-03-27 12:02:00,586,"Mir lost to vera when he was a trainwreck from the accident long time ago, you're forgetting mir just knocked out the best striker in the heavyweight division"
448721,Cudz,2010-03-27 12:51:00,2652,That was no surprise.  Shogun is top class.  That should not have surprised anyone.  Way more surprising than that was when shogun lost to forrest or when serra beat gsp.
448722,bassman87,2010-03-27 12:53:00,586, or when demian maia is gonna beat anderson silva
448734,trevy727,2010-03-27 13:37:00,351,"  Who? Kongo? Whatever. What about Cain Velasquez. He'd kick Mir's ass. Right now, Carwin is the best striker in the heavy weight division. You'll see that tonight."
448739,trevy727,2010-03-27 13:49:00,351,"  You're joking, right?"

448754,bassman87,2010-03-27 14:11:00,586, Lol carwin is the most heavy handed striker but he's slow. Kongo is the best striker there's no debate about it.
448756,bassman87,2010-03-27 14:13:00,586,"If cain fought mir all he would do is wrestle him to the ground and try to do some lay n pray, but then mir would break his arm"
