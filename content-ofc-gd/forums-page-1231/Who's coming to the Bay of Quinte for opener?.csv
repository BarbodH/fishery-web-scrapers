61909,sonny,2007-04-19 00:34:00,511,"Hey here's an idea,,,,how about we dedicata a cannel on the vhf radios to us OFC'rs,,,that way we can talk and hear how all of us are doin,,,as well as meet??   sound like a plan?"
61915,Mike the Pike,2007-04-19 00:41:00,3421,How about we all meet some where in the evening.Sorry Sonny I don't have a VHS radio.Since it is a tournament I would prefer to meet friday night when we can not fish. I don't like cutting into tournament fishing time.Some may be fishing at night .Friday no one can fish until midnight.Just an Idea.Alot of folks going to fosters and some in Hay Bay need a half away meeting place.MTP
62143,duber,2007-04-19 13:45:00,220,"After geting set-up on Friday I don't figure I will be able to drive anywere , if you know what I mean"
62248,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-19 18:45:00,835,I slept on the boat one year....Figure we went about 3 miles
62270,jedimaster,2007-04-19 19:30:00,3472,I was thinking of fishing from midnight til about 3am then anchoring and snoozing off til about 5ish. Is there anywhere at the trent river you can do this safely?
62321,superdad,2007-04-19 21:07:00,353,"Hey Lew,  We'll see you around your 'island paradise'.  Our Hay Bay base is Bayview Resort (Trailer parked there)  Hope it's a good as last year - nothing under 26""."
62493,sonny,2007-04-20 01:13:00,511,"ok,,,channel 72 it is,,,i'll be following ya dad,,lol"
62617,lew,2007-04-20 09:18:00,12767," Lookin forward to it as always David, we'll be there every night as the sun goes down.  Best of luck to you this season"
62639,jedimaster,2007-04-20 12:31:00,3472,"I was told the trent is the plaace to be during the day and evening, is Hay bay better at night?"
61151,duber,2007-04-17 15:18:00,220,"Just wondering who is coming down for opening day on the bay.  Although I only live a couple miles from a boat launch on Big Island I will be camping at Fosters Fishing center for opening weekend with a couple buddies.Should be a good time.Everything we need is right there.They have bait,a weigh station for the derby and are having a fish fry Saturday evening.We can dock the boat for the weekend and don't have worry about driving anywere so we can have a beverage or two and meet up with some fisher folk to exchange a story or two.Can't wait!  I do think it is going to be tough fishing thow as the walleye are just starting to spawn cause of the cold weather.  Anybody from the board going to Fosters?  Wes"
61155,Terry,2007-04-17 15:24:00,14456,I wish I was
61156,Hooked,2007-04-17 15:25:00,891,"I'll be up there for the opener, and looking forward to it!"
61158,lew,2007-04-17 15:29:00,12767,"Leave a few pickeral for us Duber, we'll all be down the following Friday for 4 days.  We camp at Bass Cove Park on County Rd. 8 just north of Adolphustown."
61162,easton13th,2007-04-17 15:42:00,371,"@ Pickerel Park, 3 of us from the board and some others...2 min from you Lew..."
61186,tundra,2007-04-17 16:37:00,18,"Me and a few buddies are going   We are staying at the West Lake Willows Campground, right by Sandbanks PP. We were there last year, didn't catch much,   but had a great time."
61198,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-17 16:59:00,835,I might slip down for a dusk till dawn on the bay Saturday night if I get a derby ticket.
61209,lew,2007-04-17 17:15:00,12767," Easton, we started camping at Pickeral Park in 1955 when it was basically just the backyard of the General Store, and we pitched our tents right on the beach. I don't think permanent trailer sights had even been invented yet  That place sure has changed alot in the last 50 odd years and the original owner, Ernie Mepstead, has been gone about 30 years now.  Maybe we'll see you on Hay Bay on the long weekend."
61213,fishingguy28,2007-04-17 17:22:00,98,hey man me and a few buddies will be at fosters aswell.... never fished that area so should be good.... !!!!!
61247,easton13th,2007-04-17 18:44:00,371,Lew My family started going to the bay about 60 years ago. My Grandparents had a 2 cottages a stone throw away from the park I have been going there all my life. When there were two parks on the site Pickerel and Sundowner. We've had a place there for 20 years and now it is all one park 255 sites. A couple of owner changes over the years.  It would be great to meet up at some point over the weekend....and swap stories.
61268,lew,2007-04-17 19:28:00,12767,"Easton, here's some of the docks going in at Pickeral Park about 40 years ago.  "
61273,easton13th,2007-04-17 19:35:00,371,Thanks Lew that great photo!....I will try and dig some old ones pics of my Dad's from the cottages (all in B&W) I will try and post them. That spot is still the same it is the boat launch now. Other than that jam about 20 trailers in that area now and a row of rental cottages.
61325,Gerritt,2007-04-17 21:18:00,6129,"Hey Guys,  Funny you should mention the Sundowner my grandparents owned it. I grew up spending summers in Picton on my Grandparents farm tending to the animals and fishing in my spare time as a wee lad... brings back alot of memories  Thank you!  Gerritt."
61333,easton13th,2007-04-17 21:37:00,371,That's great! Spent a lot of time there in my youth! I remember when they had the pool table and a store in what is now the lodge @ Pickerel Park. The Cottages my family had were on the same side of the road. 2 lane ways down from Sundowner. Did your grandparents own it when it was sold to P.P.
61336,Heybud_e,2007-04-17 21:41:00,208,"i would love to go, first time for everything they say !!  i've heard so much about it and read even more about it.. sounds like a fantastic getaway! anyone from niagara going?"
61352,Gerritt,2007-04-17 22:13:00,6129,"Easton, I would have to ask them... and right now my family is not on talking terms  (My own personal choice)I do remember alot about the Sundowner however and helped out quite a bit in between the Farm duties... it was great! I always looked forward to my summers... Drinking raw milk and Eating a cow named after me LOL... I remember picking up the ""metal muffins"" (hated that part) getting chickens ready for the table etc...  I had a great time growing up there during the summers, it defiantly taught me all about what a fulls day work was all about.   Gerritt"
61358,irishfield,2007-04-17 22:22:00,26272, I'm not even gonna touch that one bud!!  Have a great time on BOQ everyone...I'll be up North by then...or at least that's the plan!
61359,sonny,2007-04-17 22:22:00,511,"i'll be there on the opening weekend too,,,plan to get an OFC flag to hang on the antenna of the boat,,,will be there with easton and jen,,,if ya see us swim on over and say hi!"
61371,Mike the Pike,2007-04-17 22:45:00,3421,"I will be there opening weekend with my BOQ partner I will be in my buddies new boat.He insists on bringing his boat,I think its because the Novelty has not warn off.We are staying at Bayside Cottages in Picton not far from Green Point and the power lines.  I will be in a grey Lund 1660 Classic  side console with blue striping and a 60hp Mercury.Like to meet some of you guys.  I will be back with my boat on the 18th,19,20,and21st of May.Staying at Mohawk Bay Park Campground.  Lew the following Friday is the 11th.I thought you were going on the long weekend.  Who will be going for the May long weekend.  Mike"
61381,lew,2007-04-17 23:06:00,12767," Yup your right Mike, my mistake on the date, I thought opening weekend was the one before the long weekend, but it looks like someone slipped in an extra weekend when I wasn't lookin.  We'll be there from the 18th till the 21st."
61447,bucktail,2007-04-18 01:42:00,1857,Trying to convince the hormonal 16 year old daughter to do the weekend with me. Have to get her while she still thinks dad is cool.
61620,duber,2007-04-18 14:15:00,220,"See you there fishingguy28.I will be in a 26 foot Golden Falcon (mid 80's) towed by 1996 white Chev extenedcab 4x4 and fishing out of a older Lund Mr Pike with a Suzukie motor.I'll be with two other guys.One will be driving the boat and one will be whinning ""theres no fish""or""why can't I catch anything""   . Should be a blast.  Wes  P.S. Lew, I usally don't hurt the population too much"
61631,Jen,2007-04-18 14:50:00,833,"Hmm, it seems I will be there as well, although, since Sonny has given me a ton of homework, reading and preparation and Easton has a list of chores as long as his arm that need doing, I am not sure I will be on time.  LOL.  Very much looking forward to it! With all of us up that way we should think of getting together somewhere!  Just a thought... when not fishing of course.  (somehow I think I am going to be very busy on the water and should possibly bring a sleeping bag for the boat, thanks Bro!)  Cheers to all, not long now!  Jen"
61639,LeXXington,2007-04-18 15:13:00,1928,"Hey All. I will be there..  Can't miss me in my Legend with the OFC flag  Also be on the VHF all weekend,. Where I am staying is still not worked out yet, Maybe fosters or depending on the weather maybe sleeping on the boat..  See you all there"
61736,jedimaster,2007-04-18 19:16:00,3472,"I will be sleeping in my boat. Gonna be fishign from friday night til Sunday, unless we hook the big one."
