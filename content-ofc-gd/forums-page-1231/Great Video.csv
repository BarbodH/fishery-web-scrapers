62242,Roy,2007-04-19 18:33:00,13728,"Beauty video, Joey!  Thanks."
62244,snag,2007-04-19 18:39:00,1932,"OMG,  That poor, poor man.  My heart goes out to him."
62253,ccmtcanada,2007-04-19 18:54:00,7971,"He looks like a kid who just had all his Hallowe'en candy taken from him.  I think we've all ""been there and done that"" before.  You could feel the disappointment and I'm sure we all envisioned the ""big one that got away"" from our own experiences.  For some reason, it still made me laugh though....LOL"
62258,charlie,2007-04-19 19:06:00,6,"Excellent video, thanks, Joey!  As for you CCMT,   ""For some reason, it still made me laugh though....LOL ""   You need help!!!!!!....  Charlie"

62302,huntervasili,2007-04-19 20:23:00,1604,aww man... that really would be an awful experience... that Muskie had the jaws of a shark...

62312,xrap,2007-04-19 20:44:00,683,Wow thats gotta suck..

62345,mepps,2007-04-19 22:02:00,1301,sweet! The look of disapointment was priceless!
62350,bassmaster4,2007-04-19 22:11:00,801,he looked like he was gonna cry
62361,darsky,2007-04-19 22:22:00,586,I am no expert but looks to be in the 40-45 lb class.Heartbreaking fer sure
62362,ecxstriper,2007-04-19 22:23:00,343," I almost cried for him. Nice slow motion action as the hook  came out, and CCMT she is not kidding. She has done it to me on several occasions"
62368,ccmtcanada,2007-04-19 22:32:00,7971,"Ok....let me explain myself...THIS video made me laugh.  If I was in a closed space (like a boat) with bly, and this happened, I wouldn't laugh...I'd look to get as far away from her as possible....shiver with fright...and hope that her fishing gear didn't end up in the lake or wrapped around my head"
62415,Tybo,2007-04-19 23:32:00,1373,"HA! Cliff, that one is going into the Grey zone.   The Grey Zone.  All women are born with it.  It is a little area in the back of their brain.  It is used for one thing.  to store anything a man said out of female contras.  Then they can process and recall that info at anytime and I do mean anytime.  Then they can use it against you offensively or defensively.  You will know when they are going to use it.  the fist thing said is. DO YOU REMEMBER(and a course you don't)"
62434,ccmtcanada,2007-04-20 00:06:00,7971,LOL....when will I learn to just keep my mouth shut????  
62438,mattyk,2007-04-20 00:14:00,2110,cool vid.
62441,easton13th,2007-04-20 00:18:00,371,I almost shed a tear for him.
62494,Rich Clemens,2007-04-20 01:15:00,3131,I'd be lying on the bottom of the boat kickin' and screaming like a 2 year old.   Very cool video.
62500,GbayGiant,2007-04-20 01:21:00,1780,"Awesome. I wish he got to see it up close, It's hard to tell in the water, but she certainly left a nice size splash."
