62046,young_one,2007-04-19 04:05:00,620,"This is UNREAL! I've either been busy, or sick for the last few weekends, and I couldn't wait to go out to the tribes. With all the steelhead pics on this web for the last 2 weeks, my anxiety was about to burst. Two days ago, I finally received my copy of the Steelheading -  Jim Butler. Tell you the truth, I really don’t like reading, but I was reading this book like there’s no tomorrow, even with my 39*C fever. Just yesterday, I was planning to hit the tribes on Friday morning and practice some of the stuff taught in the book. One of the few Fridays where I don’t have school. Now, CC is putting down his rod… What chance is there for me. This sucks, I guess I should just sleep-in and recover 100% from the flu."
