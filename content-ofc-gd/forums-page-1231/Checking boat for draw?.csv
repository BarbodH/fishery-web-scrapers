62255,jedimaster,2007-04-19 18:59:00,3472,Is there a way to test for draw while the ignition is off?
62257,misfish,2007-04-19 19:03:00,29133,"You have to check with an amp meter,remove the lead and check between the lead and the battery."
62259,jedimaster,2007-04-19 19:07:00,3472,Someoen was telling me that it is normal for a tach to sometimes register a reading when the ignition is off. Is that true?
62461,taper,2007-04-20 00:44:00,611,Some of the gauges can show a reading when they shouldn't but check as misfish said at the battery to be sure there is no draw. I don't believe it would be your tach if there was a drain.
62471,sonny,2007-04-20 00:54:00,511,"ok step one!!   turn off all accesories and take key out of ignition,,,,disconect either battery cable and conect a test light inbetween the two terminals,,,,if th light illuminates,,,you have a draw,,,the next step would be to either pull fuses or diconnect anything that uses power untill the light goes out,,,then you've found your draw!"
