62131,Squid,2007-04-19 13:35:00,1656,"Hercules: The World's Biggest Dog Ever According to Guinness World Records   Hercules was recently awarded the honorable distinction of Worlds Biggest Dog by Guinness World Records. Hercules is an English Mastiff and has a 38 inch neck and weighs 282 pounds.   With ""paws the size of softballs"" (reports the Boston Herald), the three-year-old monster is far larger and heavier than his breed's standard 200lb. limit. Hercules owner Mr. Flynn says that Hercules weight is natural and not induced by a bizarre diet: ""I fed him normal food and he just grew"".... and grew, and grew, and grew. "
62135,nautifish,2007-04-19 13:40:00,1416,Holy crap he is huge.  Would not want to have to clean up after him while taking for his daily walks thats for sure........You would have to take a pitch fork and wheel barrow.......lol.......Forget a grocery bag.....lol
62139,Guest mistyriver1,2007-04-19 13:43:00,0,WOW.  His name sure suits him.
62140,bigfish1965,2007-04-19 13:44:00,3382,My gawd! What is that thing?? Hows that for a guard dog...even better as a hunting dog. He'd just scare the animals into a heart attack.
62142,Uncle Buck,2007-04-19 13:45:00,1000,Can you image the Turd that thing leaves  I'd hate to walk him in the park and have to clean up after him...
62152,Joey,2007-04-19 14:10:00,9122,Better get a bigger bed if you let your dog sleep on the bed  That dog is Massive - Wow.  Joey
62154,lew,2007-04-19 14:32:00,12767,Marvin could whupp him
62159,ricoboxing,2007-04-19 14:38:00,398,thats fake!
62160,caper,2007-04-19 14:38:00,210,According to snopes  http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/hercules.asp
62163,Squid,2007-04-19 14:42:00,1656,"OOPs!! Freaking snopes, to bad it sure looked good."
62164,douG,2007-04-19 14:44:00,2693,I always thought that this was the world's biggest dog.  
62175,snag,2007-04-19 15:25:00,1932,lol Doug!  CLIFFORD!  Never understood why he was red??? Radiation is the usual supect.
62181,BITEME,2007-04-19 15:30:00,1969,My old english(CYRIBUS) at his full potential when he was 6 clocked in a 235lbs one year and did not look even remotely close to that picture even at 195  looking at that picture and having owned the breed i would say the dog in that picture pushes 500lbs+  It has to be fake if it is not i hope he is not fixed because that guy could make a fortune with that blood line
62192,walleyejigger,2007-04-19 15:40:00,876,"  he's red because he's clifford the big red dog, if he was called clifford the big blue dog, i doubt he'd be red"
62337,GbayGiant,2007-04-19 21:53:00,1780,"It sure looks cool, lol. But I agree it's far beyond 282lbs, it's bigger that the horse.  My buddy and his dad breed Mastiffs and they have some close to 250lbs that are 10 times smaller than that thing."
62436,GbayGiant,2007-04-20 00:09:00,1780,So I looked into the Hurk situation caus I love dogs. Heres what I found. He is a real dog but not that pic.     
62610,kennyman,2007-04-20 04:47:00,737,"I have a customer that brought a mastiff into our store and I couldn't believe the size of the thing. I was a ""brindle"" colour and looked like a lion at first glance. His dog wasn't fat but weighed a svelt 200 and change. My customer was driving an older Impala (like a taxi) and when he put the dog in the car and it laid in the back seat I swear it went from one side right to the other. It however didn't look as big as the one in the pics. Hey,maybe the people are only four feet tall LOL."
