62305,taper,2007-04-19 20:31:00,611,"I am going to look at a new rod and reel tonight. Mainly for pike but want it to be able to handle musky as well, so I am looking for a baitcaster. I don't do a lot of trolling mainly casting. I really like power pro but this is my first baitcaster so I am wondering if I should stick with mono until I get the hang of it. What do you guys recommend."
62307,Golfisher,2007-04-19 20:36:00,586,I put 30 lb PP on my first baitcaster and didn't encounter much trouble.  Worked beautifully.
62311,lew,2007-04-19 20:43:00,12767,"Go with 80 pound PP taper, and just take it easy till you get the hang of it.  Baitcasters aren't nearly as tempermental as alot of folks make them out to be and you'll get the hang of it in no time.  When your casting larger musky sized baits and get a backlash, the 80 # will keep your line from snapping."
62318,Golfisher,2007-04-19 20:57:00,586,"Lew, is that recommendation on 80 lb pp just for muskies or for other species as well?"
62333,lew,2007-04-19 21:40:00,12767,"Golfisher, it's not so much for the fish, but to prevent line breakage due to backlash.  Musky baits are generally quite heavy, and if you get a backlash while using too light line, it'll snap and you'll lose the bait, which isn't a good thing considering the price of them. Nothing worse than seeing a $50 bait sailing off into the sunset  The heavier line also helps to control the fish and make her go where YOU want, not where SHE wants"
62342,mepps,2007-04-19 22:01:00,1301,"AT lesat 50lb power pro, but 65 or 80(as lew said)is probably best.  I think its better to use a tough braid while learning fora a couple reasons, 1. Less breakage 2. When you have a birdsnest you can often PULL the knots out with brute force (of course this sometimes means you will make the knot tighter)  With mono you will strech line, or break it whiel tryign to forcefully undo birdsnests."
62344,misfish,2007-04-19 22:02:00,29133,"If your throwing spinner baits for pike,even musky or bass,it,s more of a reaction hit and the line thickness makes no dif.  I throw 12-17 pound for spinnerbaits for bass,and never had an issue.  Hope that helps."
62446,silveradosheriff,2007-04-20 00:25:00,1025,"I would start with 14-17lb mono until you get the hang of it, and then move to 65 or 80lb pp."
62447,fishboy,2007-04-20 00:27:00,550,"if using power pro, go with at least the 50# as it has the diameter of 12# mono.  It's a bit more forgiving with a baitcaster when learning to have a thicker line diameter."
62504,jnic,2007-04-20 01:25:00,158,"50lb power pro, no problem. good luck"
