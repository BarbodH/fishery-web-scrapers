We were talking to Mark's grandpa and he told us not to buy a boat, we get to use his again for the summer! Same as what I was looking at the other day. YES!!!!! Love you grandpa!!!!! He also told us that if he decides to ever sell it then it is ours. ""don't worry, we can work something out"" how great is that. My truck will be paid for in July so we're going to talk to him then."
