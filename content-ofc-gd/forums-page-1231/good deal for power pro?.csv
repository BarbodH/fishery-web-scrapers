61517,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-18 04:09:00,1351,http://cgi.ebay.ca/PowerPro-Spectra-Fishin...1QQcmdZViewItem  right now going for $45 + 25shipping USD.. if sold for say $55 .. that would be roughly in the end$91.. but for 1500yards of line..  thats like 6 cents a yard.. compared to reg price for 300 yards for 13 cents.. half price! for hell lotta line!
62570,jnic,2007-04-20 02:47:00,158,my buddy got a similiar deal off ebay. said the line was great.
62575,irishfield,2007-04-20 02:50:00,26272,Yep they come up daily and generally go about $100cdn a spool for 1500 yards.  I picked up one of 80 lb and one of 30 lb last year... that should last me a few years.
62611,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-20 05:29:00,1351,few years? that'd last me a decade.. .. lol.. considering they last a couple years then just reverse the spool.. and that'll add another couple years.. plus.. i don't have that many reels.. haha..  i guess just a heads up for some ofners
