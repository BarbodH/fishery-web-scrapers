When we were down last May it was quite a bit lower than usual and it was even tough getting outta the channel from our camp at Dorland. We had to trim our motors all the way up to keep from hitting bottom.  Here along the Toronto shoreline, it's up about a foot from last year."
62654,Terry,2007-04-20 13:06:00,14456,from what I know about water then BOQ has to be the same as TO so I will make a guess that it is up a foot from last year
62660,ccmtcanada,2007-04-20 13:20:00,7971,"Hey Lew...  Lew....here's a link I found to some Lake O data....  http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/_kd/go.cfm?d...amp;pge_id=1139  In summary though...here's the scoop....for Lake Ontario in April....  Current Level - 246.0 feet Long term average - 245.7 feet Average Last Year - 245.0 feet  Seems like your ""one foot"" observation was bang on!!!"
62661,duber,2007-04-20 13:25:00,220,"Heh Lew,  The water level in the bay is a little higher than it was last year but still is lower than normal for this time of the year.With all this rain in the last few days the rivers and creeks have came up a little which is good news for the spwan cause the level in the rivers was way below what it should have been.The walleye run should be wrapping up soon , they have been running for about a week now.With the spawn being a little late I would imagine the river mouths will be a little busy for the opener.They will deffinently be biting better when you come down.  Wes"
62667,lew,2007-04-20 13:46:00,12767,"Thanks Duber, let's hope the levels come up some more then before we all head down that way in a few weeks. It was so bad last year, the boats were practically sitting in the mud at the docks.  Good link Cliff, thanks."
62728,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-20 17:10:00,835,"I called Al and he said if you put 3,000 boats in the water it will raise the water level to disastrous levels  so everyone should stay on shore, except me and Al of coarse."
