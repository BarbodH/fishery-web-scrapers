61881,panfisherboy,2007-04-18 23:57:00,14,hey everyone. i was just wondering if anyone knows how to cook smelt. a local grocery store sells them not sure if you eat them whole or fillete them?thanks for any responses. pfb
61883,huntervasili,2007-04-18 23:59:00,1604,used to just fry em up whole with some batter and add some lemon after their cooked... eat em bones and all if theyre the little ones... But i guess you could eat the meat off the bones too...
61888,Roy,2007-04-19 00:02:00,13728,Just fry them and eat them as they are.  Never smelt a smelt that smelt like the smelt I smelt.
61893,huntervasili,2007-04-19 00:08:00,1604,you smelt a smelt?
61901,taper,2007-04-19 00:22:00,611,The ones in your local grocer may be different than the smelt the guys are catching locally.
61902,Roy,2007-04-19 00:24:00,13728,"Taper, I believe they're the same."
61927,pikehunter,2007-04-19 00:57:00,1659,They taste like smelt  Actually they taste great! But a couple of meals of them and that pretty much satisfies the need it til next year
61933,jil101ca,2007-04-19 01:03:00,41,Could you just imagine trying to fillet one?
61987,Sinker,2007-04-19 02:22:00,8692,"I don't know of a fish that has sweeter meat than a smelt.  Just fry them up whole, some people gut them, but it depends on the  size of them.  I get mine from NB, saltwater, YUMMY!!  Sinker"
61996,Fishmaster,2007-04-19 02:29:00,920,Take the head off gut them roll in flour fry in a pan of peanut oil ..YUMMY ..
61998,bigfish1965,2007-04-19 02:30:00,3382,mmmm...smelt
62061,lew,2007-04-19 09:05:00,12767,"It's been about 35 years since we fished for smelts, but we did them just like the others suggested, gut them and remove the head, then fry in butter.......deeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious !!"
62138,Headhunter,2007-04-19 13:43:00,5703,"We used to catch them by the garbage bag full off of the Port Stanley pier. We'd use scissors to cut off the head, a quick slice up the gut, thumb through the cavity to pull the guts out. A little flour, some hot Lard a sprinkle of Kosher salt and your good to go! HH"
62165,douG,2007-04-19 14:47:00,2693,Definitely another one of those things that tastes like fish.
62169,misfish,2007-04-19 15:16:00,29133,Ya think douG.  The best part is the crispy tails. Smelts are second to Kaplin. Yum.
62183,mattyk,2007-04-19 15:33:00,2110,"tastes like chicken. Ha ha, not really sorry. There not bad. Fry em up in some butter and a little bit a lemon or lime juice and your in business."
62188,walleyejigger,2007-04-19 15:38:00,876,"most times grocery stores sell sea smelts, totally different than what we catch from our great lakes, sea smelts are usually bigger, (so u may want to remove the bones after cooking) and sea smelts have a much sweeter / richer taste, i find they taste a little like crab legs, sea smelts and ""regular"" smelts are barely comparible"
