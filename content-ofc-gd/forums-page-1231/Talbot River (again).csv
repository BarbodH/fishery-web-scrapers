62328,Mattitude,2007-04-19 21:17:00,155, Took a friend of mine who has been fishing for about 30+ years out to the Talbot yesterday to see the Walleye run.  Needless to say he was awestruck at the size of these monsters.  He was telling me stories the way there about seeing people with big walleye etc...When we got there he was at a loss for words.  Anyway if you can get the chance take the family out to see this event.
