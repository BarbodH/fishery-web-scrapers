62620,SlowPoke,2007-04-20 10:06:00,2984,"Thanks everyone!  Kind of a crappy day... only saw my family for about ten minutes in the morning... spent the day running around wasting time and spending money and my b-day meal was a Chicken Caeser Salad at McDonalds around 11PM. The highlight of my day was getting an extra packet of salad dressing. Fortunately the family and I celebrated last weekend... cake.. fishing toys.. hugs & kisses etc.  JJ, as for white hair? I just hope to have hair at all in a couple more years!"
