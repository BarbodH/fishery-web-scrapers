61825,AlanJ,2007-04-18 22:16:00,3,"GaryV was admitted to the Sarnia Hospital April 9th, then had abdominal surgery April 12th.  I talked to his wife a few times during the week and got through to GaryV today. Gary is doing well and is anxious to get home and rest. It looks like he will miss the spring sarnia salmon derby, but should be able to make the Lakair camp.  Gary said he was enjoying the sponge bathes from the cute nurses, which he asked for 4 times a day. What a dirty, dirty man...  Joing me in wishing GaryV all the best and getting back into fishing shape soon,  AlanJ"
