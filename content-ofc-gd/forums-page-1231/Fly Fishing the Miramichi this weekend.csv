I am in the east coast on business for two weeks and seeing as I have a weekend in there with nothin to do I figure I would give it a shot and see if I could get out with a guide. Sure enough I have a horseshoe in the right place and I managed to get a ride with Country Haven lodge. I was talking to the head guide today, he said the season opened last weekend and they have had days with 70-120 fish so far. Ohhhhh Man I am excited for Atlantic Salmon. I will take as many pics as I can and post em  Cheers  Gnoddy"
