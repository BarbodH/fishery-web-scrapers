61876,pikeie,2007-04-18 23:50:00,380,"well i decided that i would take my bro, down to a secret creek today and see if the suckers were in yet. when we got there, there wasnt any fish to be seen but i tossed out a worm anyways and caught a few chubs lol ahaha, the next drift i was about to bring the worm in to start another drift and my line started peeling off the reel had a good fight for about 2 minutes then the net was under her, i say her because she was sprayin eggs in the net, got pic but,now my phone camera wont send it to my pc. anyways heres one of the release anyways. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1176940095 this fish measured 24 inches  my brother lost one then he got his first http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1176940129 this one was 22 inches  took lots more pics but like i said my phone wont upload them  i went 4/6 and my bro went 1/5 lots of fun, and those bigger suckers sure can pull some line on those light action rods. for anyone that says those fish dont fight, they sure did in the current "
61914,007,2007-04-19 00:41:00,537,Thanks for the report Pikeie.  Sounds like good fun on light tackle.  I'm looking forward to maybe catching my first sucker at the weekend. I hope there are some in the Humber River in T.O. Sounds like float fishing a worm on the river bottom is the way to go.  007
