62695,Harv,2007-04-20 15:13:00,19,"  Actually, I did hook up with Dom through the Quest Board.  He made the cork for the rod in my Avatar picture.  It is funny because he is making me another grip right now for a short spin rod and I had him do it with green burl something like yours.  I saw the picture of yours on his website and thought it looked very sharp - especially with the green reelseat and butt cap.  When I saw your post and pics from the 'Geen there was no mistaking that grip.  He does very nice work.  Again, great pics Mike.  Harv"
62360,solopaddler,2007-04-19 22:22:00,8605,"Well, with prospects for some decent steelheading being pretty grim for the lake Ontario trib's, I decided to head north today. It was a solo trip as the rest of my friends had this annoying ""work"" thing getting in the way. Anyhow, since I'm so wiped out I'm not going to get too wordy here. All in all it was a very decent day. The weather was amazing and I went 6 for 8 on the fish with some very long and epic battles. At one point I had a beauty fish in the 15lb class beached at my feet. I grabbed the tippet with one hand while I fumbled for the camera, she lunged and got off So no pic's of the big one, you'll have to take me at my word.                         Cheers,   Mike"

62533,bucktail,2007-04-20 02:05:00,1857,Absolutely great pictures....thank you!
62560,sconceptor,2007-04-20 02:36:00,146,"Saugeen Rules!!!!!!  All those fish picks from Lake Ontario tribs were beginning to piss of the West Coast of Ontario.  Now our big rivers are fishable, we can share some success.  The past two days I've gone 5for5 for steel, 4 x 2-3lb silver snot rockets and 1 x 6lb drop back hen, plus 2 suckers.  I won't be fishing the weekends as the crowds are worse, so I get my time on the river when I work nights, and go out mid week.  That's the worst dam! I wish the fish ladders were better, so more fish could get up it.  At least Darryl Cronzy has helped to start up a trout stocking program on the river and the Kincardine hatchery as already taken some eggs and sperm to get the stocking program going!  Going to make it into one of the best trout rivers on the East Coast of North America we hope!!!!  Good fishing forum is GreyBruceOutdoors.com  lots of Huron and GeoBay rivers on it!"
62564,Mike the Pike,2007-04-20 02:39:00,3421,Mike thanks for that report beauty pics .Like the shots of steam coming off the water.  MTP
62591,jdmls,2007-04-20 03:23:00,575,"Ah Denny's , these pictures really hurt !! . I bet you were dreaming of fishing that pool when you were there !!! Come opening morning it has more people on it than a Union station Subway at 8:30AM !!! Its the only pool you can fish opening morning with 1000 guys and not have to hear one of them bickering and complaining...gotta love Denny's roar !!"
62599,douG,2007-04-20 03:32:00,2693,"I think we have a contender for post of the year.  That was a 'felt like I was there' post for sure.  Thanks, solopaddler."
62629,solopaddler,2007-04-20 11:05:00,8605," How in the heck did you know that?! LOL!  You must be a member of the Quest Board! If you're not, then VERY good eye. It's not like Domenic Frederico is a household name!"
62630,xrap,2007-04-20 11:16:00,683,Nice fish and those shots are amazing.
62631,ccmtcanada,2007-04-20 11:21:00,7971,Another great report!!! I can only hope that in a decade or two that I yield results like you.  Keep em coming!!!  Keeps me motivated!!!
62635,Douger,2007-04-20 11:56:00,116,"nice work.  as a newbie i can't wait to be able to have a day like that....  but that's the good part.  with all the miles & tangles you put in as a newbie, it will likely be years before i feel i've accomplished what i want.  -d-"
62652,Whopper,2007-04-20 13:05:00,2174,Great report solo!  Looks like a good time!  Whopper

62673,snag,2007-04-20 13:55:00,1932,You definately have a great eye for the camera!
62678,kennyman,2007-04-20 14:13:00,737,"That was a very cool report. Thanks solopaddler. I just look at reports like that in absolute awe. To be honest I have no idea how to fish salmonidae at all. I just try to pick up little tidbits of info and store them away each time. So, if you could,  throw in a little extra help for ""us dum dums"", like what you caught it on,technique etc. I'm sure judging from your success that even some of those who have experience could learn something from you. By the way,beauty pics too!"
