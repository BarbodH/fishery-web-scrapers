I took my camera this morning and got a couple pictures of the sun as it peeked over the horizon.  I never could understand why folks want to sleep late in the mornings.      The city seems so far away too when it's seen from the Bay.    Nuthin special, but it's a nice way to start the day"

62116,bpsbassman,2007-04-19 12:36:00,941,Beauty shots Lew.  I have a heck of a time getting up early (unless its for fishing).  I hope to be able to do it more often once I'm retired and enjoy a siesta in the afternoon. You are definitely right about it being the best part of the day.
62118,Pigeontroller,2007-04-19 12:38:00,2793,"I like to be in my boat looking at that! Muskie rod in hand!  Nice pics Lew, thanks."
62119,nautifish,2007-04-19 12:41:00,1416,"I agree lew i was down by the water at 6.00am this morning. I love that time of day, air allways smells so fresh crisp and clean.......Great pictures thanx for shareing."

62126,caper,2007-04-19 12:55:00,210,Don't see the sun rise too often unless I'm fishing or working midnights....  Nice shot's Lew
62134,OhioFisherman,2007-04-19 13:39:00,6623,"Great pictures Lew, nothing like the sun coming up, better when your on the water!"
62156,Joey,2007-04-19 14:35:00,9122,"Nice to see the sun again, seems like its been hiding for some time now.  Great pics Lew, thanks for sharing them.  Joey"
62219,Eddyk,2007-04-19 16:53:00,195,"Are you kidding me. If your driving in from the west and the sun is coming up you cant see anything. The waves crashing on the beech so loud you cant hear your radio. It smells like goose poop'',dam seagulls squaking. Opp's I've got to go and fill my cup up. It's half empty."
62223,Spiel,2007-04-19 17:05:00,9065,"....I often get to see the sunrise Lew. Mind you it has to be a clear day and I'm usually on my way home form nightshift....lol Great pics though, nothing like a morning sunrise over water unless of course it's a sunset over water."
62229,mattyk,2007-04-19 17:07:00,2110,nice!
62231,GbayGiant,2007-04-19 17:12:00,1780,Nice shots Lew. Can't wait for those early spring fishing mornings with the mist coming off the water.
62402,foggy,2007-04-19 23:10:00,38,"nice pics!!  its really weird for me to see  toronto  from that angle, behind the trees, it must look nice when the leaves come out."
