61910,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-19 00:37:00,108, I totally agree with Sinker.  I don't believe crappies kill the population of walleyes/pickerals.  There is no concrete evidence that this is true.  Myths have always been misinterpreted as the truth.  Until studies of the feeding habits of crappies comes out ... then I will believe in this myth.
61950,mrdylan,2007-04-19 01:34:00,111,Man is to blame for the decline in Walleye ask the average person what local fish they like the most the pickerel is the #1 answer. Only anglers know Crappie to be better (and even that is debatable for many) On the way up to our trailer on an indian reserve there is a Chip truck that sells pickerel and fries wonder how many they are getting to meet demands.  Anyways I am hoping to get some Crappies when our trailer opens in May we go up on the 4th of May to open.

62018,T Fisher,2007-04-19 02:56:00,139,"Im on for supporting the BOG Walleye those 12 and 14inch slabs gonna pay, yes 14inch lot's out there, look for the warmer water small bays, old weed bed cut outs, creek mouth."
62045,jediangler,2007-04-19 03:56:00,1923,"When people had trouble catching walleyes on Scugog 20yrs ago they blamed the musky, 10yrs ago they blamed the ""White Bucket Brigade"" and now they are sure they can't catch them because of the crappie. I don't dispute that they may be harder to come by these days but lets put the blame where it belongs, on walleye fishermen. Last time I was there was 4 yrs ago and I caught a walleye on my first cast. It was 20"" long and I kept it to eat. So if you want you can blame me."
62054,Golfisher,2007-04-19 07:30:00,586,"Those walleye never had a chance; they were up against a Jedi!  I mean, who can resist the force, eh?"
61555,jeffw,2007-04-18 11:49:00,267,"Just thought I would see who's hitting the opener for crappies instead of trout. I will be fishing on sturgeon lake but may try out scugog. I will be hitting the marinas and back bays with small tubes, crayfish and fin s minnows and a float and might even try my 5wt fly rod. Cheers Jeff"
61666,Beans,2007-04-18 16:21:00,3339,You Betcha ! Can't wait ! Don't know if we will hit any but we sure as hell will be chasing them on Pigeon...LOL  Don't know what this cold spring will do to them this year...assuming the ice goes out this weekend it will be a full week later than last year (Apr 13)...  Opener last year they didn't start biting good until the afternoon after the sun had warmed things up a bit...so much for getting up early...LOL
61668,misfish,2007-04-18 16:36:00,29133,Looks like ya got lots of room on that dock there Norm.
61673,Victor,2007-04-18 16:47:00,1609,i'll be heading out on the canoe but haven't decided on a location yet. First time targetting them in spring and first time fishing open water for crappie so i'll see how that goes.  Good luck to everyone who's heading out on the opener (trout/crappie)!!
61675,Beans,2007-04-18 16:55:00,3339,T'aint mine Brian...Private Property...Tresspassers suffer the wrath of Uncle Vinny (The Chin) and Guido...not a nice thing to witness my son...
61680,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-18 17:07:00,4399,Well since I have been vocal about the effects of the crappy crappie on my Scugog walleye population I should do my part and try to help thin the population.  Support walleye KILL a CRAPPIE!!!!!
61682,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-18 17:08:00,4399, Please come to Scugog!!!!
61687,keram,2007-04-18 17:18:00,585,"I think I will try Scugog too ( and  I really mean TRY ), Looking for my third crappie    ( the only two I've ever caught were on different lake on Muskie size spinnerbait  ). I still have no idea where to find them   , but again I will try"
61745,FishingAdik,2007-04-18 19:40:00,14,i would love to try crappie fishing but just don't know where to go. i mainly fish from shore though.
61751,xrap,2007-04-18 19:46:00,683,Gonna hit some crappies on the weekend. Open all year around here
61755,misfish,2007-04-18 19:53:00,29133," Hey there cat,I know acouple of fellas like that,I just bring some canollis and Im in like that."
61764,bbog,2007-04-18 20:17:00,665,I can't wait to try out my new Fenwick HMx ultralight set-up on the Crappies! You bet I'll be there for the opener!!

61777,jeffw,2007-04-18 20:47:00,267,Bucktail the kawarthas open next weekend. Cheers Jeff
61784,nel,2007-04-18 20:57:00,52,I would also like to support the walleye population on scugog...anyone got any pointers on finding the crappie there?
61785,Guest skeeter99,2007-04-18 20:59:00,0,hitting scugog  might even bring the white bucket and put it in the middle of the bass boat .....................HEHEHE
61786,canadian_copper,2007-04-18 21:04:00,925,never have caught a crappie in my life!!! anyone willing to take a newbie on???? can i use my floatreel so i feel sort of at home?? LOL
61797,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-18 21:33:00,4399, I know the marina`s/docks will be loaded with the pesky buggers so that`s where I will be. Bring a big bucket and fill it there is no limit!  Support Scugog Walleye kill a Crappy Crappie!!!!
61799,tbayboy,2007-04-18 21:35:00,1497,Has anyone rented a canoe on Scugog before and can tell me where they got it from? I'd love a lazy day of floating around looking for crappies (I've never fished them before or even been to Scugog) but I don't think there's a lot of shore spots (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) so rental it is.  Or of course if anyone is looking for someone to split gas and confirm your stories about the record slabs you caught I'm your man.
61800,misfish,2007-04-18 21:36:00,29133,"I,ll take five nice slabs over an eye. Just my opinion on that."
61804,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-18 21:43:00,108,any marina's accesible on scuggog for shore fishing?
61811,Sinker,2007-04-18 21:58:00,8692," The only time I use my float rod is for crappies. Easy to make long casts with a float. Long casts are usually the key in catching a bunch of crappies. Its also nice to see the old loomis bent over with a nice slab on the end  I usually hit rice or pigeon, but I have pulled some slabs thru the ice on the bog.....maybe its better there now? I'll have to give it a shot.  Anyone get into them good on Sturgeon?  sinker"
61826,frozen-fire,2007-04-18 22:18:00,542, X2... i'm willing to help the walleye population and kill a crappie or two.
61838,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-18 22:42:00,4399, Please accept this as a standing invite to fish Scugog or any of other kawartha lake and help thin out the bands of marauding Walleye fry eaters!   Support Scugog Walleye kill a Crappy Crappie!!!!
61879,Sinker,2007-04-18 23:55:00,8692," Do you really think the crappies have had that much of an impact on the eyes in scugog?  I know the eye fishing isn't as good as it once was, but I don't think crappies are the blame. Maybe too many people fishing....hard and softwater.....the lake  gets pounded! Release the eyes and feast on crappies!!  Sinker"
