62067,dsn,2007-04-19 10:22:00,1018,I was out yesterday just preapring the areas I fish. Then I gave a try..... nothing.  Time to do the leg work and hunt them out.  Nothing at the island yet either. Water temps have to warm up more in some areas.  dsn
62069,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-19 10:34:00,181,It's suppose to warm up this weekend!
62076,xrap,2007-04-19 11:03:00,683,"I've been trying some new areas. Used corn worm, strawberry doe but nothing."
62088,JEREMY,2007-04-19 12:07:00,300,I got a few last weekend nothing big 2 or 3 pounds.But they were all over the place though.
62090,nautifish,2007-04-19 12:09:00,1416,Yup in the last two weeks have probably caught 20 or more......  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3aubIxDWGo
62109,trapshooter,2007-04-19 12:31:00,1234,"Back when I lived in London (ON) I  used to start carpin in the River in Mid April.  Mind you, this april has been especially chilly so that might effect things a bit.  Keep at it and you'll get on some real soon."
62151,fish4me,2007-04-19 14:07:00,59,I don't start until May and even then it is very challenging to hook into multiples.  Lots of big fish but we need a nice warm spell for probably 2 weeks to get them going.  This April has been tough for sure as far as cold weather.  Give it till May if this warm spell stays with us.
62206,Victor,2007-04-19 16:16:00,1609,gone out 5 times over the last 3 weeks and not even a single hit ... used canned corn and worms now that it's finally warming up ... it might take a while for them to finish all the groundbait/chum that's still out there lol
62221,Golfisher,2007-04-19 16:59:00,586,The weather looks beautiful for this weekend; hopefully it will wake them up and get their metabolism going.
62236,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-19 17:39:00,2050," Yeah, went to college in london, last three years I was able to start getting them at the beginning of april!  Can't wait for this years carp season.....there's to many damn species out there!  I wanna fish them all! haha  UF"
