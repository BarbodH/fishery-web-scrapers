As long as you don't have any breakdowns, you are gonna have a great day on the water.  The weather forecast is perfect, too, with an accompanying high UV level.  Wear a hat.  No,  no, not a cap, but a real hat with a circular brim.  Buddy sailed for many years wearing a ball cap. At 58, he lost a thumbnail sized piece o ear to melanoma.  I can't understand how folks fish wearing a ball cap.  Better now.  Expectations are outa sight on this report.  Pictures, please."
