565317,Oggie,2011-03-24 01:06:00,588,"I've got a princecraft DLX that has really uncommon gunales.  The lip is over an 1.5"" (haven't measured it since fall). I'm trying to find rod holders that mount to a gunwale that isn't square or round and it's quite a deep edge on the inside. Anyone found a rod holder that works and how do you install it. I've bought a Scotty rod holder and I'm wondering if I just need the back accessory that allows instalation.  Thanks for any help you can offer. I'd take a pic but the boat's stored.  Dan O."
565322,Ricky Bobby,2011-03-24 01:15:00,35,What I did was add a piece of 3 x 6 aluminum and screwed it to the side wood and the under wood (you will know what I mean) back by the rope tie off. Then I screwed the rod holder there on top of the aluminum. Has worked well for muskie fishing.

565337,John Bacon,2011-03-24 01:28:00,3277,Is this the Holiday DLX?  If so can you mount them to the decking in the back corners at the stern instead of on the gunwhales?  I ran a plank across the whole width of the boat so that I could mount downriggers.  It would be overkill for just downriggers but it would work.
565357,Oggie,2011-03-24 02:09:00,588,"Thanks guys. John its the Starfish DLX. I did mount one holder on the small aluminum plate on the corner. The other one has a nav light in it.  I'm gathering the gunwhales are a problem then for most mounts.  Rick, do you mean on the stern wall next to the motor above the shelf that runs across the back?  Is Ok to mount rods that far back? I figured it might be better up the boat a ways.  Dan O."
565469,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-24 13:23:00,1022,"I wouldn't mount it all the way at the back, as it decreases the amount of leverage you have to set the hook, especially if you fish toothy things. Just my opinion."
