Mine was in the water from March 28 until Nov 29 this year...dress for it and wear goggles or shades.  Tillers have bigger casting decks, more room overall and better control.  I've got no use for a windshield."
565377,irishfield,2011-03-24 03:13:00,26272,"It comes right down to... what do you use your boat for.. and who do you want to enjoy that experience with you!?  I could sit in an open boat 12 months a year... family on the other hand, that I'd like to share that experience with can't.  Wife has lung issues... so rain/wind and getting wet aren't high on the priority list. Having a windshield and full top with rear curtain allow us to go out fishing in any weather. A bit of sun makes that interior like a green house, while still allowing full fishing capability.  "

565385,landry,2011-03-24 03:47:00,1005,"I have a side console crestliner fish hawk (16') and love it. I always hit the boat show and I think alumacraft and crestliner are my 2 favourites - wide, well-laid out and good reputation. The lund and princecrafts are nice too of course - but too much $$$$ for me. I would happily take a tiller or side console in a 16' - as mentioned full windshield would be too big for a 16'er. Full windshield would not suit me as I like rarely troll and side console keeps me dry enough and drier than my friend - he doesn't complain in November, cause he is just happy to be fishing:) I like the console for tubing with the kids as opposed to the tiller too. BTW - the crestliner and alumacraft pictured are nice rigs guys!!!!  You can't lose either way cause you're getting a new boat!!!!! Have you considered buying a slightly used one in the states??? That's what I did - twice. Great deals and easy to do.  Landry"
565391,BFSC Kevin,2011-03-24 04:18:00,1351,I have found it really annoying to try to look over the bow while driving a tiller!!
565394,Henricus,2011-03-24 05:13:00,118,"Excellent debate.  Personally, I think you have to strongly consider your past experience.  If all you have fished in is a boat with a console, you will miss it by choosing a tiller and vice versa, if all you have fished with is a tiller, you will miss the lost space in a boat with a console.  Either way, be sure to test run each of them before you buy.  I drove to Alabama to buy my boat and it was over 5' longer than my previous boat.  During the test drive my first thought was ""uh oh, this thing weighs a ton"".   I had done my homework though and after a lengthy test drive and putting the boat through it's paces I warmed up to it pretty quickly.  The moral of the story is don't buy something you haven't tested or had any previous experience with.  As far as advice, you can't beat this site as there are a lot of great comments throughout the thread   Good luck."
565423,Roy,2011-03-24 10:57:00,13728,"Well I'm very happy with my tiller. And something else that some of you might want to verify. I never, at any speed have trouble seeing over the bow. You might want to check your trim settings. Just sayin'....."
565429,Bernie,2011-03-24 11:44:00,3190,"Ya, but Roy, what do you do if you get a big fat guy sitting at the front?"
565431,Roy,2011-03-24 11:49:00,13728, Well then I guess the console dude has the same problem eh?
565467,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-24 13:13:00,1022,"My rule of thumb is you spend 95% of your time fishing and 5% of the time driving the boat, so I like to have the most room when I'm fishing. If the fishing spots you go to involve driving a considerable distance, then I would go console. Tiller I find makes it easier to drive the boat up onto the trailer, as opposed to guiding it on with the ropes. I love when people stare at me at the launch thinking that I'm going to miss the trailer . Mind you, boating experience does play a big role in this."

565545,camillj,2011-03-24 17:37:00,1988,Yep .. I was thinking exactly that .. one (tiller) for fishin alone in smaller waters... and one big plush-wagon side console with completely closeable stand-up top to keep out the nasty weather when needed ... (of course a bimini top for the sunny hot days)
565601,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-24 20:33:00,1107," In my 14' tinner the motor was a manual trim and it didn't matter were I put it I had a hard time seeing over the bow while coming up on plane or slow speeds tried everything even spacers my buddy made wouldn't do it.I put a hydrofoil on it and that helped a lot but still had some issues, power trim it's not a issue at all."
565633,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-24 22:03:00,10439," It can be rough on those smaller tiller boats due to their lower weight handling. You put the motor, gas can and a person right in the back they are going to want to run nose high until you are on plane. That all goes away with a larger boat. I ran 16, 17 and 18 foot tillers on Great Bear and never had those issues (even when running alone with my fat   a 30 hp OB and 15 gallons of gas under the back seat).  My first boat a little 12' tinny and 5 1/2 Johnson would ride nose high and I'm pretty sure my 8' inflatable with 4 hp Merc will probably ride nose high, but I won't know until late May or early June when I get a chance to run her for the first time."

I'm looking at a 16-16.5 ft boat and am undecided now as to tiller or Console.

I am considering the new Lund Fury 1600 SS and also a few Alumacraft models lunker 2 and fisherman CS. I didn't make it to the boat show so to be honest I haven't looked at these boats close enough. Does anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks  G"

564881,Bernie,2011-03-23 02:36:00,3190,I like a boat with a windshield and a top. Not everyday you go out and the weather is perfect. Protects from nasty cold and wet weather and those baking hot sunny days.
564885,danc,2011-03-23 02:47:00,4677, I've had the same situation in May on more than one occasion Wayne. I couldn't imagine the ride with a tiller.

YOU really have to check the boats out, sit in them, pretend your fishing, and see what works, and what doesn't, then weight the pros/cons of each. Only YOU can decide what YOU want.  I have a tiller. This boat is coming to the grave with me, but there are a couple times a year, where a full windshield/console would have been nice. I'm still, hands down, a tiller guy. Once I wieght the pros/cons, it always comes out ahead.  you guys who complain about cold/wet/hot/sunny weather shouldn't be fisherman. I'm going to call the whaaaaambulance....  S."

564953,devy,2011-03-23 11:24:00,13,Went from an old springbok tiller to Lund 1625 REbel XL sport with console!. Console the way to go as it breaks the wind and splash up from waves especially during spring and late fall! Rebel is a great stable boat 
564967,Moosebunk,2011-03-23 12:25:00,3970,"Lunds or Alumacrafts... both were my top two choices when buying as well.  With two Lund dealers nearby, one just 15 minutes away, I chose the 16 foot Rebel XL.  Plus, I think I just wanted a Lund having always really liked my buddies 16 foot Classic tiller.  Tiller vs console is a very personal choice as only you know what your comfort level, season and fishing needs are on the water.  I'd love to have both, but was happy to take the tiller.  I fished last year into December, spent some time on two of Ontario's Great Lakes, chased everything fishy that swims, got wet a couple times because of having a tiller, but it never once really bothered me.  Rainsuit and/or goggles came out a couple times.   I like having the full boat in front of me, engaging everything ahead.  The extra room and the quick response of the tiller is great as well.  If fishing the GL's more often, then an 18 foot with a console would have been the choice, but the Lund handled BOQ well this year when picking the right days, same as the Ottawa River... and I got in and out of some smaller lakes with shallow launches unscathed as well.  16 foot is the workable size for big and small water.  Enjoy whatever you get.  Lund or Aluma, tiller or console, when it's yours it's the best thing on the water."
564989,lew,2011-03-23 13:11:00,12766,"I've fished from all the styles of boats over the years and have owned most of them and every one has it's good points and bad points and depends what you need.  Tillers are great because of the extra room you get and are nice for precise boat control but can be miserable in really nasty weather.  Single & dual consols are great for running WOT down the lake on a cold moring but somewhat cut down on your space if you have a smaller boat and are also uncomfortable on those miserable cold rainy days.  Full windshields give the most protection when running down the lake but unless you have a bigger boat your movements are also somewhat limited.  My personal favorite after all the boats I've owned is a full windshield with a standup, fully enclosed  top.  As mentioned a few times previously in this post, when your fishing big water in November & December and the winds are howling and the snow is blowing, it's great to have the full encloser to keep you warm, dry and comfy.

565020,Radnine,2011-03-23 14:50:00,1538," ""Why, yes Reverend Jones, I am a little parched. Could you pass the Kool-Aid please...""   Did you go to the boat show? That is the place to jump in and out of boats and see what the room vs. comfort debate is all about. I have a side console and love the control and the room that I have to run about. My passengers do not like the fact that I blast around everywhere because I am shielded while they are frozen and wind blasted (I remain unsympathetic). The truth of the matter is that the console does not offer really great cover, I mean it is better than nothing, but hardly complete. I think for me it was really more about the comfort of a steering wheel and the freedom to multi-task form one spot, including quick un-impeded access to the front and the back of the boat. I am also a fair weather type, so rigging for winter, or extreme weather is not as important to me as it would be to the hardcore types. See the picture below. It is my boat during a trip to Rice last spring. You can see how quickly a 16' side console fills up (that is the stuff for two guys!) There is not much room for walk-throughs or dual consoles.    Good luck!! Jim"
565027,linweir,2011-03-23 15:02:00,202,"Under same model, console type boat can carry bigger motor, of course it's heavy. Max HP of my Tiller boat is 60 HP comparing with 75 HP for Console. Not sure if it affects speed alot since Tiller is much light."
565054,bassman,2011-03-23 16:13:00,384,"I've got an Alumacraft Navigator 165 (full windshield), thanks Gord.  I fish with family and friends, so the full windshield is great for everyones comfort.  In regards to Lund vs Alumacraft, you cant go wrong either way. Both are top quality, however, Alumacraft does not have the marketing machine or the sponsorship that Lund has, therefore more Lunds out there and a higher price. I have had Lund owners in my boat and they have been impressed with the quality, and the smooth ride of my Alumacraft. In my two year search for a used boat, I was primarily looking at Lunds, but I found the AC, and I have been very pleased with my purchase. At the end of the day, you will not be making a mistake either way, just find a boat layout that will meet your,and your passengers, criteria.  Cheers!"
565068,Raf,2011-03-23 16:55:00,3495,IMO once you go 17-18'+ the extra length affords you the luxury of going console.  in a 16' I think I'd go tiller for the extra room. a full windshield would just take up too much room.
565176,aplumma,2011-03-23 20:20:00,6896,"Yaa but look at how cool you look standing up in the back of the boat with a tiller in your hand.

565212,trapshooter,2011-03-23 21:40:00,1234,"First off..... TILLER and ALUMACRAFT.  That would be my choice.  Like Sinker, I'm a tiller guy till I die!  I love backtrolling for walleye and love the open space for muskies.  I am willing to sacrifice creature comforts for fishability.  Wiser's boat is an AWESOME RIG!  I agree w/ Raf too, if you're going 16' there's not enough space for a console.  I once worked for a lodge that ran 18' Lund Pro V tillers.  After 5 seasons the boats were beat up so badly and they took on a lot of water when backtrolling.  They switched to Alumacraft and the difference is unbelievable.  They don't show the wear and tear on the interior and best of all, they still backtroll into big waves without taking on water."
