I've done a search online and only managed to come up with 1 shop.  The 1 I manged to find was called ""Sport Fishing Tackle and Supplies"" located @ 12 Finley Road (Brampton).  Just a few questions...  1) Is Sport Fishing Tackle and Supplies"" open to the public? or is it a warehouse of sorts? 2) Does anyone know of any local tackle shops in the brampton area?  Any information provided would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance!!  Thanks OFC'ers, RoB"

565565,waterwolf,2011-03-24 19:00:00,556,"can tire or walmart are the only suppliers left regarding tackle sadly.lucky lou's was the last standing in brampton at steeles and dixie. fishing plus has a good inventory at martingrove and 401, then there's always BPS.bit of a hike though."
565570,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-24 19:09:00,1022,"Bass Pro is close enough and probably much cheaper than any small shop. The choice is obvious. No offense, but if you can afford to live in Brampton, whats a 20min drive?"
565584,fisher12,2011-03-24 19:55:00,81,So it seems there are no fishing shops in Brampton.
565596,toca,2011-03-24 20:21:00,274,Bronte Outdoors Is Probably The Closest.......
