564776,mercman,2011-03-23 00:48:00,7054," So, really all i would have to do, is fill with grease to the desired level, then drill a small hole just above that level.If i overfill, it will come out of the hole, when the washer passes over the hole. Is that right."
564780,dave524,2011-03-23 00:55:00,4508, That is exactly how the ones I have work.
564783,NANUK,2011-03-23 01:00:00,797," EXACTLY !!  Bearing Buddies do work !! The key to remember is ""NOT TO OVER FILL"" Provided the bearings were packed right with grease in the first place (inner, outer and in between). If you can rock the plate with two fingers, Do not put anymore grease. I have taken the hubs apart on my boat trailer after 5 years(just to see) and the bearings looked brand new with clean grease in them. and I trailer my boat every weekend during summer."
564909,Sinker,2011-03-23 04:04:00,8692,"The problem is people think that since there is a grease nipple on there, that they should grease it every time they move the trailer..............which leads to overfilling, and blowing out the seal.  I have the EZ lubes that put grease from the center of the axle, to the inside bearing, but in the two years I've had this axle, I haven't touched them. I pop the cap off once or twice a season and make sure the grease isn't milky, but that's about it.  Your better off to be light on grease, than too much. If you can't see any grease on the inside, or outside of your wheels, you don't have to add any.   I've never blown a bearing on a trailer. I've blown tires, and snapped axles, but the bearings always hold up. I swear, its because I just leave them alone, and let them do thier thing.  s."
564935,fish_fishburn,2011-03-23 09:37:00,1311,I second exactly what Wayne said. On my 15 th season and never an issue with bearings cause I use Bearing Buddies. So they must work.
564937,pikehunter,2011-03-23 09:43:00,1659,"Mine has had bearing buddys right from the dealer, also has grease fittings on the backside of he hub from the trailer manufaturer. Yes I did once get water into a bearing. When I inspected it and replaced the bearings and seals I found out why. When the hubs were machined they left a small bur on the axle, right where the inner seal sits. Bur wore the seal and hence the milky grease. All is fine since. I believe in them and other than that no troubles.  Funny thing about the dealer is he never responded to the email I sent to him in regards to this, not that I was after him for compensation just wanted him to know about it."
565044,ch312,2011-03-23 15:33:00,1590, you honestly believe that the guys who make their living off repairing trailers are going to recommend using a product that puts less $$$ in their pockets?   i've never heard of anyone being afraid to get their trailer bearings wet. i can only imagine what people are thinking when they see a guy at the ramp that's afraid to get his boat trailer wet.  my homemade boat trailer with bearing buddies is 20 years old and the original bearings are showing no sign of failing anytime soon. a few squirts of grease every year sure seems a lot easier than your launching method...
565057,Billy Bob,2011-03-23 16:23:00,5865," I would love to demonstrate my easy method....it's been a proven one for my boat and trailer for the last 26 years...trust me it real easy...just stop the trailer when the hubs are just above the water and shove off the boat....repeat method for retrieving....it takes me about 1 minute or less to launch and maybe 3-4 minutes to retrieve by myself.  I have watch the clowns at the boat ramp for YEARS dunking their trailers in so far that they need waders....the exhaust of the tow vehicle is under water, when they pull the boat out of the water it's sitting crooked on the trailer and have to do it again and again, etc....I have never needed boats to launch or retrieve my boat even without a dock."
565120,smally21,2011-03-23 18:40:00,993,"ez lube axles are the better option over bearing buddies. if you have the option when purchasing a new trailer or doing a rebuild request ez lube, this system greases inner and outer with a few pumps of the grease gun. not something you can add after the fact, like bearing buddies. all my customers got ezlube whether they wanted it or not.  maintenance with ezlube is so easy i actually do it!  and trailers go in the water its where the boats are. maintenance is key!"
565141,skeeter,2011-03-23 19:15:00,1907,"I have a 1985 chriscraft. It has the original bearings in the trailer with bearing buddies on it.I have never had a problem with them, and when it gets launched the hubs have to get wet to get the boat off. That puts them at 26 years old. I hauled it up from keywest florida to peterborough on the back of a 92 plymouth grand voyageur Ya that was a heck of a drive, from 30 mpg going down there to 8mpg coming home.

565161,skeeter,2011-03-23 19:51:00,1907," LOL, ya think? It was just a little over on the towing capacity.    You are absolutly right Wayne, that thing cuts threw the biggest of waves and keeps on going. It came with  150 merc, but it is rated for a 250 hp. I would like a 200-250 on it, any brand is good. The lowest i would go is a 150 but would prefer bigger."
565162,irishfield,2011-03-23 19:53:00,26272,I'll ask around.. so it has Merc controls right now.. old two stroke. But an upgrade to a 4 stroke and the required throttle/shift etc would be better...

564486,bucktail,2011-03-22 14:12:00,1857,My buddy and I were having this discussion the other day wether you need to repack your berrings if you are you using bearing buddies or not. I have no idea since the bearing buddies apply pressure and hand packing bearings does get the grease in but i dont think it would do it any better then the bearing buddies. Anybody no the answer or is it one of those questions that is allways asked and has no definate answer?  Darren
564497,cuzza,2011-03-22 14:44:00,467,"Never seen those before - clever idea, the website says ""Eliminates bearing re-packing"" so I guess as long as your seals are in good condition (if there is grease in the bearing buddy they must be) then they shouldn't need re-packing.  http://www.bearingbuddy.com/"
564509,bushart,2011-03-22 15:04:00,2628,All's I know is I do all I can---bearing buddy wise and greasing....and getting them checked.  I pray I never lose a wheel on the road--I've seen a few as I drove by over the years---not pretty
564510,Woodsman,2011-03-22 15:08:00,1286,Bearing buddies will get grease to the outside bearings but the inside ones may suffer. Best to re-pack yearly. This is coming from someone who had a bearing seize on the road destroying the tire in the process.
564514,Bigfisherman,2011-03-22 15:24:00,100,"I repack almost twice a year, even with bearing buddies I always check my seals any sign of grease coming out of the seal I repack & inspect. Also good idea to carry an extra pregreased hub, spare tire + tools just in case. Better safe then sorry.  The main cause to grease leaking out of the seal is high speed then launching in cold water. I try to avoid but in most cases I can only wait a few minutes before launching:)"
564535,OhioFisherman,2011-03-22 16:15:00,6623,"My last boat trailer came with an off brand style of bearing buddies, I still repacked the bearings and inspected things once a year, in the fall at the end of my fishing season. I had the boat, motor and trailer for 20 years, and never a problem on the highway. I have seen too many people, in a hurry, lazy, wind up with a problem along side the road after a long day of fishing for me to be comfortable taking a chance."
564543,Fisherman,2011-03-22 16:28:00,7201,"Like the others said above, simple bearing buddies do little for the inner bearing set, once the hub is full there's no where for the grease to go except out through the rear seal. Is there grease between the seal and inner bearing, can't see it, ya don't know.   Warm bearings into cold water, guess where the water gets sucked into, past the seal and into the hub.  Even the newer Dexter axles that are specifically made to grease the inners and outers recommend service.   If you do your own bearings, go to the bearing shop and get the double lip or double seal bearing, much better quality.  I get mine from Canada Bearing in Barrie, seal is made by Chicago Rawhide.  It's also recommended to use a quality no wash out grease, similar to what snowmobiles use. I had bearing buddies for a couple seasons,  I got rid of them and went back to the tried and true method."
564565,Garnet,2011-03-22 16:58:00,2056,"My trailer guys tell me that bearing buddy's are the worst thing invented.  We all keep putting grease in until we fill the cavity, at that point the bearing has so much grease around it may never generate enough heat to turn grease into oil. And that scores your bearing."
564576,bubbles,2011-03-22 17:16:00,591,  That is very interesting.  Have not heard that one before.
564578,Billy Bob,2011-03-22 17:20:00,5865,I have always said Bearing Buddies do NOT get grease to the inside bearing....  I repack my bearing about every 15 years if they need it or not....I'm am not kidding....the trick to good bearing maintenance is do NOT but them in the water...When I got my boat (26 years ago) I lowered the rollers and bunks down as low as they can go BUT kept as much weight on the rollers as possible...then I spray the bunks down ONCE a year with a full can of silicone which drenches with it AND grease the rollers about every 3-4 years......then when I back down to launch or retrieve my boat I stop the trailer just before the hubs go into the water...no water in hubs means no problems down the road....
564587,mercman,2011-03-22 17:51:00,7054," One would think that since the trailer is meant as a means to launch a boat, that they could design bearings that are waterproof and maintenance free."
564591,irishfield,2011-03-22 17:56:00,26272, They did... they're called Bearing Buddies and a good set of seals! LOL  The mechanic mentioned above only hates them for one reason.. it's cut down on his annual trailer labour income. They work just fine... IF.. AND ONLY IF.. you don't overfill them and blow the rear seal.
564594,skeeter,2011-03-22 18:04:00,1907,I have been using bearing buddies for 26 years and have never had a problem !
564601,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-22 18:13:00,0,Buddies all the way. In the long run they work. Better than nothing. Check your bearings before each trip. If there is 'in and out' play on your wheel...it's time to change your bearings and races.. It is very easy to do. It's all part of pulling a trailer.
564639,glen,2011-03-22 20:12:00,2641,The center of my axle is drilled and has a grease fitting.  It puts grease on the inner bearing then the outer bearing.  With bearing buddies i would repack every year.  Be sure to use marine grease.
564709,mercman,2011-03-22 21:53:00,7054,"While we are talking about it, how do you know when you have enough grease in your bearings.I notice a grease nipple in the center of each wheel to fill, but what indicates when they are full."
564711,irishfield,2011-03-22 21:56:00,26272,You talking a bearing buddy Paul.. grease nipple on a spring loaded plate?? As long as you can rock the plate there is still enough grease in it. When you do grease.. fill until the plate comes back about 1/2 away against the spring. NEVER fill until the plate is bottomed tight to the spring.  
564714,mercman,2011-03-22 22:11:00,7054, Thanks Wayne !! You are talking to a guy who thought a lower unit was a ........ well....you know
564720,Garnet,2011-03-22 22:22:00,2056,These guys have built and maintained trailers for 30 years and they are saying bearing buddy's are making them money.  Those ones with the grease nibble on the end of your axle are the same as mine. They also have a cigar ring that fits over your axle  with a hole in it. Nightmare to find and your inner seal is odd size.
564725,Billy Bob,2011-03-22 22:35:00,5865,"With Bearing Buddies you are putting ALL your FAITH in that rear (inside) axle seal....as a mechanic almost my whole life I'm not prepared to do that...my ""guess"" would be 50-60% or more overfill their hubs with Bearing Buddies (as witnessed by grease everywhere) and thus blow out that rear (inside) seal because it's the weakest point within the wheel bearing system....just saying.....  I'll stick with not getting the bearings wet.... much like your tow vehicle wheel bearings..."
564726,mercman,2011-03-22 22:41:00,7054,"I Dunno Bob. The last thing i'm thinking about whem i'm backing down a ramp is ""Oh my  I can't get my ball barings wet"""

564731,Billy Bob,2011-03-22 22:46:00,5865, And that's the FIRST thing on my mind.....EVERYONE I take is given specific instructions on when and how to stop me from backing down into the water too far....when I'm by myself it may take 1-3 stops before I get it just right.....but you know what Paul......I have gone 15 years without worring about my wheel bearings without repacking them babies (treat them like babies and they last).....do you know anyone else that can say that ???
564757,dave524,2011-03-23 00:06:00,4508,"My old easy loader trailer has a no name set of bearing buddies on it , it has a relief hole drilled in from the side so you can't overfill, once the disc with the nipple gets to the hole the grease just comes out the side. should be simple to modify any set to work the same."
564775,Roe Bag,2011-03-23 00:47:00,246,"I have 2000 EZ loader trailer that came equipped with ""Bearing Buddies."" I have yet to repack the bearings. You don't have to worry about getting them wet. When full, the spring is under load creating a positive pressure within the cavity which prevents water from entering. The only maintenance I do is make sure they are kept full. Over time the heat generated will break the grease down and occasional top ups are required. As an indication of being full, grease will show around the plate (pressure relief) that the nipple is attached to. They cannot be overfilled. I check the inner seals regularly for signs of leakage especially before and after long hauls. No issues in ten years.  http://www.bearingbuddy.com/why.html"
