566189,cwpowell,2011-03-26 17:45:00,265,"Hehe, I like to play the game here and there. I've had it for about 3 weeks and I just got the 5 hour playing time notice. So that tells you how much I play. But I do enjoy playing it as the day winds down. Of course I don't skip work or school to play, And while my girlfriend is home from school Thursday to Sunday, the game system doesn't get touched."
566190,cwpowell,2011-03-26 17:46:00,265,It's also more of a winter season thing for me. Once you can put shorts on you won't catch me in the house. I'll be on the boat or on the bike.

565224,PikeMolester,2011-03-23 21:56:00,428,dont get me started on the PS vs Xbox and BattleField vs COD cause I will destroy you all in an argument. I get heated about this stuff.
565232,DundasSteelheader,2011-03-23 22:12:00,166,I play cod4. Im 11th prestige hahah
565305,GoneFishin,2011-03-24 00:53:00,349,Thinking about getting black ops off my buddy tomorrow since I just got my hd projector lamp replaced yesterday
565399,chaarsawbees,2011-03-24 06:42:00,6," YES!!! BFBC 2 is the best first person military shooting game out there! COD is so cartoonish and the guns sound so weird! I have all COD games for PS3 since COD 4 but I only buy them to try them and so far nothing beats Bad Company 2, so they sit there and collect dust. If anyone plays BFBC 2 online, feel free to add me on PS3! My ID is: superdeluxe639"
565400,chaarsawbees,2011-03-24 06:50:00,6," No worries man, it's all just an opinion. Some people like Battlefield better than COD, and PS3 more than XBOX. It's just a matter of opinion, not fact. Whatever you like better is your choice as long as you enjoy it, that's all that matters. Although the only matter of fact is that BFBC 2 is better than any COD ;P Kidding, that's just my opinion, I enjoy the game way more. But then again, I own a sound recording and post-production studio as a business, and we do post-production sound mixing for film and television, and the occasional video game trailer, and I'll tell you for certain that the sound in BFBC 2 is FAR superior to COD. That doesn't make it better for everyone, perhaps that's why I like it better, but hey to each their own..."

I tried XBOX360 once, had my man spinning like a ballet dancer, twas quite comical.  My son is addicted he truly is and its quite sad.  He needs to get a JOB, a life, away from that life sucking machine!!  Someday I may just accidentally take a hammer to it....and blame him for driving me mad with the constant sounds of war."

565422,12footspringbok,2011-03-24 10:37:00,459,   I used to have a couple buddies big into the online shooter games. I'm sure they're probably still in their mothers basements playing right now...LOL
565438,ch312,2011-03-24 12:20:00,1590, you need to get out a bit more if you get into heated arguments about video games...
565442,ch312,2011-03-24 12:30:00,1590," considering how many kids are obese, lazy, antisocial and unwilling to work because of video games, i highly recommend that you smash that thing before your kid turns into one of those people i make fun of.  a few of my buddies have younger siblings that got hooked on video games and it's rather pathetic how low some people can go. never leave the house, 8 hours of game play a day, skipping school, no friends, 18 and never had girlfriends, etc. what makes it even worse is their parents just sit back and let it happen. put your foot down and put a time limit on daily usage."
565466,scotty61,2011-03-24 13:12:00,3," Yep, guys at worked got me hooked on Modern Warfare and now BlackOps.  Usually get my ass shot off but its a lot of fun.  Find the servers on PS3 are flakey, but its free so cant complain.  Between seasons it passes the time as opposed to watching the boob tube"
565482,Beans,2011-03-24 14:02:00,3339,  I'm with you Lew. I've heard of pac-man but never played it...

565922,Lunker777,2011-03-25 19:29:00,866," Im calling Bull on this !!!!! over 30 days of play time ???? that would mean you average 5 and a half hours of play time a day SINCE the game came out in november.... I cant remember exactly, but I think it came out Nov. 9th.  Bragging about how much time you waste inside isnt ""COOL"" ... and if infact you can prove that number, its even more pathetic !  I have seen guys with 10-12-15 days play time with top prestige.  On the other hand.... Black ops is pretty sweet, I have about 6 days play time now. Im on 4th prestige. Im kind of losing interest now though. Ive got a house to renovate, work to be done and fish to catch !!!!  See ya on the water !   PS.... PS3 rules all !!!! hands down !"
565924,Lunker777,2011-03-25 19:31:00,866, He should be on the 50th prestige about 6 times by now if he is still playin COD4 !!!!! Its been out for what... 3 years now ?
565926,DundasSteelheader,2011-03-25 19:33:00,166, It's still the best call of duty imo   
565935,solopaddler,2011-03-25 19:53:00,8605,  Yeah whatever. As far as I'm concerned anyone over the age of 12 who plays these things needs to get a life.
565936,ranksda58,2011-03-25 19:55:00,69," gotta disagree with you on this statement...i'm 26 with a job, home, wife and newborn baby...i do plenty through the day that doesnt involve a gaming system...if i want to sit down for an hour or 2 and play some COD after the wife and baby have gone to bed, i dont see any problem with that nor do i feel like i need to get a life"

566002,Grimace,2011-03-25 23:33:00,2020," I am in the same boat except I am 34. Beats the hell out of watching survivor  or any of the garbage television programming.  I do not watch tv anymore.  I either read books or essays or I lose myself in a game for a bit.  And as it happens, I personally believe that it has helped me professionally.  I am a Crane operator by trade but sometimes run other machines.  My learn time on different machines over the years probably was cut in half at least."

565055,JohnF,2011-03-23 16:17:00,3494," Played 'em all except the newest one. I only play solo, not online. They're fun. My problem is I get them as hand me downs from my son so some are on the PC and some are on his old XBox which he gave me when he got the newer XBox360. He also has PS but I haven't got a handmedown of that yet.  JF"

565061,solopaddler,2011-03-23 16:32:00,8605,   I was going to say I've never played a video game in my life.  But I did play that 30 years ago.
565065,young_one,2011-03-23 16:44:00,620,"Xbox is where the competition's at! I personally prefer MWF2 over BlackOps, but that didn't stop me from lining up midnight at Dundas Best Buy.  Less COD more fishing!"
565066,Grimace,2011-03-23 16:50:00,2020,I am playing Killzone3. Great game.  I like it better than black ops.

565074,solopaddler,2011-03-23 17:09:00,8605, Buddy I can't even hook the thing up.  I watched them play a couple times when they first got it. They havn't touched it once since we moved in July.  Biggest waste of money ever.
