565503,misfish,2011-03-24 15:08:00,29133,"Im still smiling after I opened the tube  which arrived a half hour ago.It contained a Quantum Tour Edition PT 13' that I bought from JohnF.  It is one sweet rod my friend. Gave me goose bumps when I pulled it out, and the other guys at the shop wanted to hold it, said get yer grubby hands away.  Great doing bussiness with you and the shipping was hassel free.  Just had to share .  Now I need two Islanders."
565504,Roy,2011-03-24 15:10:00,13728, TWO?? Is it a double butt rod me son?
565509,JohnF,2011-03-24 15:23:00,3494, You made it easy. I'm shocked that it got there so fast. The pickup was only at 4:15 yesterday.  Hope the fish cooperate on the weekend. I'm glad to hear it's going to get some use. If I'd kept it all it would have done was get dusty in the storage unit.  Keep us posted. I'd love to hear it caught you a PB.  JF
565511,misfish,2011-03-24 15:26:00,29133," No Roy,turns out it,s another float reel rod.Yes a spinning reel would do,but not for this one."
565525,misfish,2011-03-24 16:24:00,29133, I know our UPS driver personally.He was keeping an eye out for the package.

565637,Jer,2011-03-24 22:18:00,1426,"   Context...or the lack there of, can sometimes be a wonderful thing."
565791,JohnF,2011-03-25 12:48:00,3494," Brian, sorry if I mislead you. What kind of rod did you think it was? I figured the slip rings were a dead giveaway. I'll refund your money if it isn't what you wanted. I want happy customers.  JF"
