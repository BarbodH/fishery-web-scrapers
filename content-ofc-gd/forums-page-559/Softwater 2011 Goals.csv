564921,Garry2Rs,2011-03-23 05:03:00,1425,  I saw an article in Bass Master Magazine where a guy used a float with a wacky-worm over weed beds.  He said that it worked best on windy days when the float would bob and work the bait. Garry2rs
564980,Harrison,2011-03-23 12:46:00,2202," Interesting, I was more thinking along the weed edges in 8-12ft of water.  Either a wacky or nose hook with a slip float to shake it around.  This should leave it in the zone longer and hopefully peeve them enough to come out... we'll see."
565003,Beans,2011-03-23 14:04:00,3339, Thanks Garry...I use the float method with tubes quite often and never thought  to use a senko ... will have to give it a try this season...

My buddy does a lot of Salmon fishing and I'm trying to get out for some ""Spring King's"".  He says they put up an amazing fight! This summer I hope to hit the kawarthas for some more panfish action!  I might try and get my older kids onto a bass or two. I might be headed to Lake Kennisis for a crack at my first soft water Laker.  At least the kids will hammer the Rock Bass! We've got a 2 week camping trip planned for McRae point on Simcoe.  I want to try and get the kids on some fast perch action.  I hope to beat my PB smallie. I'm hoping to get my first Muskie in the boat.  I'll have to plan a few trips to Scugog and Pigeon.

564016,PainInTheBass,2011-03-21 14:43:00,102,"Many anglers get stuck in a rut when fishing, complacent to continue to do only those things with which they are comfortable. While some are content with this, others are not. I am one of the latter. I long to better myself as an angler; to be more flexible and adaptable to the varying conditions I may face. As such, I have come up with 3 goals for myself this coming softwater season (these goals are discussed more colourfully and in greater detail on my blog if you care to read it lol); "
564019,goteeboy,2011-03-21 14:50:00,175,My goals are to learn simcoe smallies. Never really tried that before. Related to that I want to become more skilled at dropshotting.  I also want to improve on my crankbait techniques.  And teach my boys how to use a baitcaster.

My goals are to get out more and be able to spend more time power fishing as opposed to just an hour here and there. My list of goals: 48+ inch musky 42+ inch pike 3+ lb smallie 3+ lb largie any walleye for the pan slab crappies (agian, for the pan)"
564023,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-21 14:55:00,3761,"  Good post, I'm on the same path. Each season I try and master/learn a new technique or two. Last season it was flipping and pirching jigs, being good at fishing froggy's and spinnerbait fishing...season before that it was things like small topwaters and some plastic fishing, this season it's about swimbaits, and fishing deep water structure for bass....without good electronics.  That's what fishing should be about, learning new techniques and being versatile. As a young angler I will be in the tournament scene once through college so why not spend a hundred days each season in a boat fishing and learning...It's what I love"
564030,Harrison,2011-03-21 15:09:00,2202,"Being a hard core jig fisherman for bass, it will be hard to drop that rod.  But, I would like to try dailing in cranks a bit more for largies.  Also, I AM GOING TO TRY THIS - THIS YEAR, I have to engrave that in my brain.  I have an idea to use a slip float for finiky bass around weedlines and other structure when there is a undergrowth.  I've pondered it for a few years now.. but sometimes it's tough to try new things when you are pressed for time on the water.  I figure this would still give a vertical presentation when you usually have to fish this water horizontally to avoid burying your bait in the undergrowth/silt.  I AM GOING TO TRY THIS - THIS YEAR."

So this year I would like to put one in the boat during a tourney. I am going to be changing it up as last year was a learning experience for me fishing from the back of the boat is alot different. I am going to be moving away from the slow weightless finese fishing, and go more for power fishing with some weighted presentations.I found during the prefishing when I was in my own boat I had lots of time to let the baits hit the bottom but during the tournies I didn't have enough time to hit all the spots I wanted. so this year I am going to change it up.

I started to get into the small stream stuff at the end of last year, but I couldn't find one bigger than about 8"".  - I've never caught a crappie or a Musky.  These are polar opposites on the gear and style spectrum but hopefully I get a chance to at least try for either.  - I want to top my PB in for SM bass.  I have access to a great smallie lake that gets very little fishing pressure at my cottage.  Last year, my family put in a new floating dock with a detachable 8x12 piece that has a build in transom.  Basically, it's a perfect casting deck, and my girlfriend can just suntan all day while I fish.  My PB is a 21""er, but I know there's some pigs in there.  I will target them on a fly for the first time.  - Lastly, I hope to catch a Pike that isn't tiny.  I've caught tons of pike, but never one greater than 30"".  I want to try getting out up north for some nice post spawn pike, possibly on flies.  As you can tell I have flies on the brain.  I'm addicted."
