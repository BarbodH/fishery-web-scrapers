565621,scugpg,2011-03-24 21:36:00,1373,I might be in the market for a vehicle and was wondering if carcostcanada.com is worth the subscription to get a better idea on pricing? Does anyone have experience with the site?  Thanks.

565666,John,2011-03-25 01:09:00,2956, PM me with what you are interested in Scugog. I probably have one or two wholesale reports left on my subscription. You are welcome to use them up.
565670,Burtess,2011-03-25 01:19:00,901,Check out this thread in RedFlagDeals.com.  You may find some info on the car you are looking for in here for free. I just posted asking for a report for a Chevy Cruze.  Burt

You might also consider joining the Automobile Protection Association - www.apa.ca  They have a new car buying plan where you are guaranteed dealer invoice plus a few percent (2-3)that is pre-negotiated and haggle free. It also includes whatever incentives are current as well as some that are exclusive to APA members.  Bought one car using APA directly and on purchase of a truck, used their price quotes to negotiate best deal which included a trade in with a non-APA dealer."
