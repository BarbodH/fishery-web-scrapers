564388,Pikeslayer,2011-03-22 02:55:00,1443,"Thanks for the heads up A.L. Based on your less than positive experience & Quantums absolute refusal to make it right; I will never, ever, not even come close to buying any of their product. Sorry, but you got hosed. If I have time tomorrow, I'll try to email this thread to some of the executive staff if I can find their email on line. Maybe other fellow members who would like to stand behind one of our own could do the same? This kind of crap really bugs the heck out of me.  Regards, Slayer"
564419,adempsey,2011-03-22 04:31:00,1498," Quantum was willing to make it right.  However, it wasn't clear if they would pay the shipping costs TO them or not.  This is pretty typical for a lot manufacturers.  I don't agree with it, but that's what they do."
564421,ah_long,2011-03-22 04:38:00,354," well... I totally understand if I use the reel... and something goes wrong, and I need warranty work and I am responsible for shipping..  but in this case... I purchased a brand new reel which is clearly defective, and I have received very poor support from the manufacturer....  I don't really blame LeBaron as this is their no tax sales event... in fact they went an extra mile to allow me to return the reel is a huge plus... but this is clearly YMMV...."
564426,mike rousseau,2011-03-22 07:38:00,4661,I think you should look at the equipment a bit closer when you dropping $200 on it...  Think about your purchase and always check a real out before buying it... Take it out of the box...  My 2 cents
564452,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-22 12:43:00,4399,"  I would not be so quick to let Lebaron off the hook scott free right off they should have offered to a refund,exchange,store credit. A no tax sale removes their responsibility how excatly? Lebaron should go after Quantum.  There is no excuse for shoddy customer service at the store level or the mfg. level."
564467,Headhunter,2011-03-22 13:07:00,5703,"I have to completely agree with you... Quantum's position not with standing, would you buy a car without driving it? Would you buy a TV without looking at it? Firstly, that kind of money for a reel is just crazy, IMHO, but if I was dropping that kind of coin on anything, you would be correct in assuming that I would take that critter out of the box and do a once/twice/three times over, before I dropped my money on the counter... So, again, IMHO, there are a lot of things that went wrong in this transaction and the three parties involved, share blame. HH"
564471,ADB,2011-03-22 13:17:00,444," There is no comparison between a car and a $200 fishing reel.  Besides, when you buy a new car, do you look under the hood?  Get on a creeper and check out underneath?  Examine the brake pads to make sure they're new?  No...I doubt you do, because there is a certain level of inherent trust between the customer, dealership, and manufacturer.  I'm pretty sure he played with the reel before he bought it anyways.  He might have missed Quantum's mistakes, but in the end, they are Quantum's mistakes...not his.  This argument is like blaming a girl for getting assaulted because she was wearing a short skirt."
564477,Headhunter,2011-03-22 13:29:00,5703,"Well then, I guess you and I don't make buying decision the same way... and your analogy is rather insulting on many levels. I look at EVERYTHING before I buy, be it a head of lettuce or a car... and yes, I do look under the hood. Here's where I come from... I play guitar, I buy many and would not think about buying a guitar without trying it first... yes, that means taking it out of the case (the box if you will), looking it over for any kind of defect and giving it a whirl so to speak. Now I have bought $200.00 guitars and each one of them have received the same attention to detail from me, that my $3000.00 one's do... So, if you assume that everything is ok with a product, any product, right out of the box, well you get what you deserve. I believe it's called... buyer beware! HH"
564479,ADB,2011-03-22 13:42:00,444," My point is:  where do you have to stop when inspecting a purchase?  I'm sure he took the reel for a whirl, as you put it.  The consumer can't be responsible for inspecting everything they purchase with a fine tooth comb.  That's ridiculous and unrealistic.  And I'm pretty sure as far as whatever consumer laws are in place are concerned, the onus is on the manufacturer and not the buyer."
564482,Headhunter,2011-03-22 13:53:00,5703,"well again, it's obvious that you and I make purchasing decisions very differently... I look at EVERYTHING! As far as I am concerned, that's my job in this consumer/retailer relationship... especially in a situation like the O.P. where he knew going in, what the terms of the sale were. I guess when you have been around the block as many times as me, you get sceptical about parting with you hard earned cash... I stop ""looking things over"" as soon as I lay my money down... until then, I will tear the thing a part! BTW - $200.00 for a reel is obsurd to me, that in no way diminishes my stand here. HH"
564484,ADB,2011-03-22 14:00:00,444," Alright, fair enough HH. No offense meant."
564487,JohnF,2011-03-22 14:19:00,3494, One of the problems we discovered with dive gear was being charged duty on the purchase price on items sent in for service work. Specifically the dive computers. Some of them are sealed and battery replacement requires return to the factory in the States. At the same time they reload the software and update it. But to have to pay the duty on a $500 wrist computer each time this is done is annoying. I took one in to the service shop in Florida on one of my trips and picked it up on the way home. Cost me $35 total. This is okay if you have extra computers but not too practical if you need the computer for your holiday.  Check this out beforehand.  JF
564489,solopaddler,2011-03-22 14:20:00,8605,I guess I agree with ADB.  Primarily because 99% of my major tackle purchases are now done online.  So far I havn't been burned once with anything defective.  I've spent a fair bit more than $200 on a reel as well.

564522,2jack2,2011-03-22 15:49:00,92,"good service or bad service, depends how you look at it what is the customer's expectation, quantum is willing to exchange it so they are backing up their product, most customer will be happy with this service and it is good service, some customer dont feel they should pay for shipping which to them, is bad service. For those who got good service from Shimano, took a short drive to Peterbourogh, got your reel or rod fixed or repair no charge, great service for sure, but if you try to tell them you want to be paid for your time and gas to get there, they mostlikely will tell you to take a hike, will that be bad service? how about people taking products back to the store for exchange or returns? lots of peoples do asking for their gas money back, store will do the exchange or refund, but no way the store wil pay you gas money, I met someone even ask for 407 troll charge becasue they choose to take 407, they won't get anything from the store, is the store giving bad service? Here is how I see it, yes, we drop lots of money on the toys we want and manufacture is responsible to make sure to have the best quality product to offer to consumer. we as a buyer also have to take responsibility to check the product before paying. Thinking that since we are the one droping the money and therefore no liability on our part is not smart. Smart cousmer should always check the products, and check the recipt after paid to ensure the store did not over charge you, it is common sence. Lebaron also need to step up to take care their customer, no tax=no return? what kind of policy is that? but if you do buy from them, that means you are agree with their policy, at the end, customer is responsible for their action. We always try to save a few bucks whereever we can, especialy when buying products, we always focus who has the lowest price on the products only and forgot what kind of the service they provide behind the products. Some time cheapest may not be the best deal."

564672,JohnF,2011-03-22 20:54:00,3494, I missed Garry's post but I had it happen and I know a few other guys who got dinged. It's now a pretty well known fact amongst divers with certain computers.  JF
564702,umKthxbye,2011-03-22 21:48:00,247," As I mentioned in another post on page 3, customs can't charge duties on something you already paid for and was sent in for warranty repairs. You must ALWAYS write above the address or somewhere around it saying ""Warranty repair"" or something indicating its a repair. I'd also make it in big bold letters, and include the same thing inside the packaged box. It's also the responsibility of the company repairing the item to mark the package are return for warranty when they ship it back. Never have I paid duties on repairs and warranty products because I make damn sure they write it when they ship it back. It's never happened to me before that I had to pay fees, but if it did I would call the company and have them refund me ASAP for their negligence. Duties are only owed on products that you purchase and import from another country. This also depends on the size and what the item is. If it's not available in Canada they may not charge duties on it. It's the Canadian government that charges these fees for not ""Shopping Canada"". Another option is trying to deal with the Canadian Duties Offices and try and get your money back. Like I said, I've never had to go through this and hope to never have to **knocks on wood**."
564706,ADB,2011-03-22 21:51:00,444," I think John's point is that, regardless of if its right or wrong, it happens anyways."

565011,pomoxis,2011-03-23 14:29:00,10,"I was at Markham LeBaron and did check the Quantum Smoke after having read the OP regarding the quality/finish issues. They had one reel left and it did have the cosmetic blemishes described earlier. I personally own 1 Quantum Catalyst PTi spinning reel that I use for my ultralight/panfish fishing. I've stayed away from their baitcasters, and own Daiwa, Shimano and Abu Garcia products. After checking the Smoke it reinforced why I made the decision to stay away from Quantum. It did not feel that smooth and I felt that the handle was positioned too far away from the body of the reel. Also the handle has that annoying backplay that all Shimano baitcasters have. The only two positive things going for the Smoke are its strong drag, and being lightweight for an all aluminum reel. I then checked out the Shimano Curado 51 and while it felt a bit better, and more palmable due to its size, it still did not feel that smooth. Again like all Shimano baitcasters, it did have the handle backplay. The drag cranked down, was not as strong as the Smoke. No cosmetic blemishes observed. I own the 201E7 and prefer it over the 51 because of the longer handle and bigger Septon knobs. Moving on, I then checked the Abu Revo STX, and for the $200 range, this is the reel to beat. Super smooth, bearing supported knobs, dual braking system (centrifugal and magnetic), and very strong drag when cranked down. The reel just felt solid. the only category where it loses out to the previous reel would be in the weight, as it's slightly heavier. Like all other Revo reels, it did not have handle backplay. No cosmetic blemishes observed So if I were to spend $200-$220 at this point it would be on a Revo STX or if you're lucky a Premier on eBay. Now in the $150 range, the Daiwa Advantage HSTA would be my pick."
565346,chong,2011-03-24 01:48:00,102,You should post your problems with the smoke on the Quantum facebook page.  http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Quantum-Fishing/80010513232  
564151,bucktail,2011-03-21 19:23:00,1857,"Man thats crazy!! those pieces arent even finished machine wise. I had a quantum ONCE the first day out on Head lake the side panel fell off as i cast, landed right in the lake...... needless to say all i buy are curados now."
564171,Snidley,2011-03-21 20:13:00,620,"Bottom line this has been Quantums reputation in the past. They have tried to restore their reputation in the last few years BUT clearly that particular reel  and it seems other reels in the same batch have regressed to the ""old ways"" I agree that a call to Rockey would be prudent he might even be prepared to ship it back as part of his warranty returns. Still this customer service is the kind of run around that is off putting, to the customer and now to others reading this thread. I have had a similar situation that might be usefull to you. I owned 5 Pflueger Supremes and I love them BUT they have a problem with the clicker mechanisim on the spin reel's spool. In effect they failed on every reel I owned. On the first one the problem happened right away and I called customer service in the USA and they immadiatly mailed off a new spool to me. Problem solved until there were failures in further reels AND Pflueger opened a Canadian service depot (in Brantford I believe and it's a Pure Fishing depot not just Pflueger)I tried to get replacement spoools from them (by this time even the one replacement spool's clicker had failed). The service rep., a girl and new to the job at that, could not help me and really did not even comprehend what was the problem. Eventually I contacted the Canadian president of Pflueger and after a time I recieved multiple new spools for all of my reels. Clearly there is a problem with these reel's clicker (my reels were way out of warrenty)and I am pleased that my reels all work properly now BUT I'm not buying any more Pflueger and probably Pure Fishing product as a result of this poor customer service. The irony is that in the past Pure Fishing out of Manitoba had by far the BEST customer service in the fishing industry and having made multiple warranty claims on Fenwick and  Berkley products I got faboulous customer service, from a female (one that fished herself and knew very well details of their products). The result was that I own or have owned about 10 Fenwick Technas, 4 Abu baitcast reels, 5 Penn reels among other Pure Fishing products. NOT ANYMORE. My suggestion Long is to try and findout who is in charge and the higher the better. Talk on the phone to him and insist that they make it good and entirely to your satisfaction (at the minimum free shipping or product to compensate for expense and trouble or even better a free reel).  One further issue about inspecting goods prior to leaving the store. I heartily agree as it is not just a Quantum problem. I visited multiple tackle shops in the GTA area with a buddy intent on buying a high end rod. We looked at Daiwa Steeze's first and they were beautiful rods but buddy could not find one that fit his fishing style. I suggested Loomis GLX's so we looked them over. I really liked them and buddy who is finikey, like them too, until he looked at the rods lenghtwise and discovered that the guides were tied on crooked. Not on one or two rods either. On ALL of the GLX rods we looked at at 5 different stores(about 40 rods). We looked at some Daiwa Zillions as well and out of 4 we looked at 2 were tied with crooked guides. When I pointed this guide situation out to a friend that works at a popular fishing store he was suprised and dismayed since GLX's are expensive inventory for independant tackle shops...they SHOULD look top end product over very carefully before puting it on sale for $400+ but they don't. The only high end rods that we looked at that had straight ties, a bare minimum in performance criteria, were St Croix Legend Elites. It was  a shock to me since even my cheap Chinese made sub $100 Airrus rods have the guides on straight. So clearly ALL companies have quality problems (Loomis is a Shimano firm) and a smart consumer should inspect high dollar purchases before leaving the store if possible but in the end it is up to the company to solve their issues to the satisfaction of the customer or face the inevitable backlash of disatisfaction from formerly loyal customers. I know at one toime I wads a loyal and profitable customer for Pure Fishing but this blip in their service has soured me on their product line."
564174,solopaddler,2011-03-21 20:27:00,8605,"  Funny thing Wayne, when I had my issues with ABU my ONLY recourse initially was to deal with either Aikmens or Rocky's and have the reel repaired.  If ABU had said right away ""mail your reel to us and we'll exchange it for you"" I would have been ecstatic.  Ultimately that's what they did for me and I was more than happy to mail my reel to them.  Feel free to dig up my old thread."

564180,umKthxbye,2011-03-21 20:53:00,247,"@Snidley So your saying that if a product goes defective to never buy from that company again? That's a little much don't you think? I mean if a company only delivers garbage after garbage after garbage, then yeah stop buying from them. But if one bad product come out but they have great everything else, why stop based on a single poorly designed or manufactured product? If I shopped like that I would never be buying computer parts ever again. If the greatest product manufacturer in the world delivered a few poor products you would stop buying from them just because, a few things haven't worked out? Just doesn't make sense to me."
564182,aplumma,2011-03-21 20:58:00,6896,I would think your wrath should be at Le Barons were you bought the reel. Even then it seems it should be little if any. Le Barons has offered to trade it in for you but the others were defective. I would ask them to trade it in for a future shipment if they are not also poorly made. I can't fault the makers of the Quantum since they have offered to make it right. They are only asking for you to return the reel for a new one. That seems pretty fair to me.Yes you will be paying the shipping to them and they will pay the shipping back to you. It was their fault for putting a reel out that had a flaw and it was your fault for not looking closely at a non returnable item. I think that the quantum line should not be faulted because you want them to do other than what is fair to both parties. I Have dealt with companies that reside in Canada and when I had a warrentee issue it was requested that I send it back to Canada. I had no issues with that because it is were the companies experts are who evaluate the product for warrentee issues. I know this is a catch 22 issue who made the first mistake and what should have been done but hind sight here will not move the issue forward. Best to box it up with a note and take them up on their offer of meeting you half way.  Art

564187,ADB,2011-03-21 21:04:00,444," I'm sure they would do that, but I'm guessing it's not what he wants.  The problem with asking for a future shipment is the frequency (or infrequency) of the orders placed.  They tend to do a few large orders instead of many smaller ones.  In terms of turnaround time, he would be much better off sending it to the states."
564188,Bernie,2011-03-21 21:07:00,3190,"Shoddy craftsmanship there, not sure of the inner workings if the outside looks like that. I'll bet they all look like that. Mass production. Is sending it back going to change anything? You just may end up with the same thing.  Tried a supposedly good Quantum a few years ago. Used it one day and gave it away to someone. Bought another Shimano. At least you know Shimano is going to be well made. Even the cheap ones are good, still have the first one I ever bought. Why the other reel companies can't seem to step it up I don't know."
564191,solopaddler,2011-03-21 21:10:00,8605,  Correct.
564214,ah_long,2011-03-21 21:47:00,354,"well.. an update...  I managed to get LeBaron to give me a refund.. so I'm going to pick up either a Core 51MG, Zillion Type R, Zillion Coastal, or the Steez  however, I'm still trying to get a resolution for my friend as he isn't willing to pay any extra to get a reel of the same weight class... so I'm still trying to work it out with Quantum (though there hasn't been much working on Quantum's part)  And while I agree that this is a lesson learnt for me... I don't see a reason of why I have to go through the trouble of sending the reel to the States, I'm sure if one spends $200 on a reel, he/she is not asking to much to have a properly finished product."

Any company can experience production or quality issues...fact is that it happens. The real opportunity is what your customer experiences after they have an issue. Quantum had a golden opportunity to turn a quality issue into an awesome experience by standing behind thier new product...this would have been a very different thread if they took the approach Shimano takes.  I had quality issues with Shimano rods and reals...but everytime they stand behind thier product, create an awesome experience and I end up tell other anglers. In fact last summer I broke the handle spindle on my brand new Curado...fell on it, my fault. Brought it to Shimano expecting to pay for a repair, told them what happened, clearly my fault, not a quality issue...thier response...""doesnt matter if you fell on it,it should not have snapped""...refused to charge me.

564374,umKthxbye,2011-03-22 02:34:00,247," That customs fee should never have happened. They cant charge customs fees on repairs. The shipper never labeled it as a return from repair. When i send return for repairs/warranty i mark it in the address field. Some companies that have to pay custom fees will ship it the same way they got it to ""compensate"" for them having to pay the fees. General rule of thumb is to alway mark ""Warranty/repair/return"" in the address area on the package and inside the package.

564036,solopaddler,2011-03-21 15:13:00,8605, What's the big deal? Ship it to Quantum. It's obvious they'll exchange it for a better finished reel.
564038,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-21 15:15:00,3761,"I like Shimano cause when I have a problem I know it will be solved for me...been 2 years since having shimano reels,...both20-40% cheaper than that reel and well they look and fish great....don't think I would consider them, we have a shimano place close in peterborough to get things fixes...sending to the US sucks."
564040,ah_long,2011-03-21 15:19:00,354,"  I don't know about you, but the reel is less than a week old, never fished, never have line on it, it's brand new. I don't really want to shell out another $20~$30 to ship it out (and god knows how long that's going to take). "
564045,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-21 15:25:00,10439, Walk into LeBarons with your reciept and exchange or refund. Probably cost way less than $30.
564046,ah_long,2011-03-21 15:26:00,354," been there, done that... no returns on the no tax sale items... as for exchange, they all have the same problems"
564047,tb4me,2011-03-21 15:27:00,3295,wow that's disgusting. Think ill stick to shimano on my future purchases...  I have seen better finishes from a highschool machine shop
564062,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-21 15:59:00,4399,"Nice commercial for Shimano!!!  Lebaron should be doing something as well you would think they would be on Quantums case if all there stock is like that, I know one thing for sure if I bought a 200 dollar defective reel from a store and they did not want to help they would not be getting anymore of my money!!!"
564065,fishrking,2011-03-21 16:05:00,24,It won't cost $30 to ship the reel back to them and with a phone call you might be able to convince them to pay for the shipping as well.  It seems they agree with your complaint and will make it right - what exactly are you looking for them to do for you - send you a box to send it back to them?
564066,ah_long,2011-03-21 16:12:00,354,"I'm hoping to get this done locally.. and hopefully I can get a swap... I don't want them to hold on to my reel, order the handles and the drag star and then have me pick it up at a later date..  If I'm sending it in Canada, it probably wouldn't cost $30, but shipping to the states would cost that much... esp for a $200 reel, I won't ship with anything without tracking."
564068,irishfield,2011-03-21 16:33:00,26272,Made some assumptions.. 900 grams.. bit larger box than it's currently in.  Expedited Parcel™ - USA 4 to 5 business days $20.78 Delivery Confirmation Incl. Rate Summary Base Price $17.81 $200 insurance Coverage* $Update  $1.50 Fuel Surcharge $1.47 Options $0.00 Tax $0.00 Total $20.78  Sucks.. bit it is what it is. Other option... Canadian Tire.. $7.99 for a small file!
564069,mercman,2011-03-21 16:33:00,7054,"Before i drop 200 on anything, i always open it up and inspect it before leaving the store.These companies shold have drop off points and/or repaircenters everywhere they sell their product.  "
564071,ah_long,2011-03-21 16:45:00,354," that's about right... but I'll see if I can do anything locally first.. I never dealt with Quantum and I don't know what the normal turnaround time is. On top of that, I really don't want to pay anything out of my own pocket to cover for their mistakes.....  I understand it's partially my fault that I didn't thoroughly inspect it when I got it, but lesson learnt... I never had such problems with any of my Shimano reels... (over 10 of them ranging from Sedona to Core 101 MG)"
564072,tb4me,2011-03-21 16:45:00,3295,"It would be a cold day in Hell before I bought an 8 dollar file to finish the job they were  paid $200.00 to do in the first place.. Thats just insane. If this company were half as good as they were supposed to be those reels would have never left the factory in that shape, in the first place..Thats just horrible workmanship."
564073,uglyfish,2011-03-21 16:47:00,981,"Calla rockys tackle repair. They are a quantum warrenty center in orillia. Great to deal with. Give them a ring and explain the situation, u may be able to send it to them and have them take care of it for u."
564133,OhioFisherman,2011-03-21 18:43:00,6623,"Dang, it looks like it was made in China!"
564143,umKthxbye,2011-03-21 19:01:00,247,"Ive shipped plenty of thing the same size as a reel box with insurance and have never paid $30 for shipping. I had my own computer business. If the company is based in US you wont get it fixed in Canada, it doesn't work like that. You have the right to be angry with the way it looks but they are trying to help you. Call them and ask for a prepaid shipping sticker. Not all companies are the same. Some will send you a new product with the shipping sticker to return the old one. Some don't. Complaining about what they ask you to do (which is very reasonable) is just delaying the process even more. Don't procrastinate when dealing with big companies. LeBaron should, to keep customers handle this for you but they are kinda bad for this since they seem to always have no tax weekends and weeks. It would be hard for them to accept returns on everything that goes out. Its also your responsibility as a customer to inspect the product first on a final sale, no return policy item. Id be angry too but either do what Quantum wants so they can help you or cry about it. Thats business."
564146,adempsey,2011-03-21 19:06:00,1498,Sure hope it's not a knock off because that's what I would expect one to look like.  That's the last thing I want to start worrying about.  Hopefully Quantum makes things right.   It sounds like they are willing to do so.
564148,solopaddler,2011-03-21 19:07:00,8605,"Look, I went through the exact same issue recently with an ABU Garcia baitcaster.  I mailed ABU my defective reel and they sent me back a brand spanking new one.  The fact that returning it to Le Barons isn't an issue leaves you with few choices.  Your only other option is if you can deal with Canadian distributor direct.  Personally I'd send it to Quantum in the states. Print off their email reply to you and put it in the box. I'd also include a very polite letter explaining your dissatisfaction in having to mail it across the border.  It's highly probably they'll take care of you. Assuming you play nice and don't start ranting.  Seriously, suck it up, spend the 12 bucks or whatever it is on shipping and your problem is solved."
564150,irishfield,2011-03-21 19:20:00,26272,"  LOL Mike.. funny when the shoe's on the other foot. I'm not gonna dig the thread up but I remember someone doing some serious ranting to get to the ""send it back get a new one"" stage...  But like you said.. Quantum opened the door.. pack it up.. put a note in as Solo says with your expectations and the fact you didn't appreciate the expense of $21 to ship it back and the wait. I'm sure they've got something at their end that they'll stuff in the return box for your troubles.  Those stating shipping costs certainly don't mail much out insured and trackable ! Just sent a 360 gram envelope to the Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton $12.98... sent them a 550gram box last Thursday.. $14.23  I'm guessin the estimate I pulled up in page 1 of $20.68, to Oklahoma, for expedited will be purdy darn close.. Xpress estimate was OVER $30"
