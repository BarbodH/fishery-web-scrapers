Managed to talk the wife and kid in to going fishing so it was a good start to the day, I was down there fishing for a while tried a bunch nothing was working and a older gentlemen that volunteered there was talking to me and asking how my day was going and I told him no luck and he brought me over to his truck and he pulled out the tackle box and handed me a lure hes had for along time and you can see it's been used and caught plenty told me he had tons of luck with it over the years but he doesn't get out much due to sore knees, and he doesn't get out in the boat much anymore. The rocks make it difficult. But in the end I didn't catch anything lol but I did manage one to follow the lure in and it was the lure he gave me. Even though I caught nothing he made for a great fishing day. Sorry to ramble I just wanted to tell you how fishing always leads to a great day for me. Even getting skunked.  Chris"

564947,mercman,2011-03-23 10:48:00,7054,Great story. Warms ny heart and renews my faith in my fellow man. Thanks for sharing it with me Paul
564988,Live2fish85,2011-03-23 13:09:00,1633,"Thanks that's why I posted it because unfortunately now a days there aren't a lot of people with the respect there used to be. I live in Hamilton now and for the most part people don't even smile or nod, your more likely to see the bird lol. It made my day and I'm off to a good start today going to play hockey now."
565023,Mike Pike,2011-03-23 14:57:00,1332,Thanks for sharing that Chris.  Experience always counts for something and it was pretty nice of that fellow to share his with ya.  Good luck next time out!
565024,Joey,2011-03-23 14:58:00,9122,That's so sweet.  I feel bad for the old guy.  That was very nice of him.  I bet you'll catch a ton of fish with that lure
565249,Rustic-Fisher,2011-03-23 22:50:00,826,"Great day, and the makings for a piece of tackle to be handed from generation to generation. The nostalgia of a story like this is priceless!"
565296,Rattletrap2,2011-03-24 00:38:00,1652,"Just one more case that shows that it is much more than just about catching fish, that we get out there and enjoy this sport. Thanks for sharing that."
565335,Oggie,2011-03-24 01:26:00,588,Fishing is as much about the people you meet as the fish you catch that's for sure. It just took me alot of years to figure that out!  Dan O.
565403,chaarsawbees,2011-03-24 07:26:00,6,"That's awesome! What a guy! I really love how most anglers are so helpful and generous to one another. We always seem to have a mutual respect for one another when we're out, and I always run into to people that make for a great day even when the bite is slow. Very few bad apples out there, but there are more good people than bad in the fishing world I would say..."
