565938,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 20:06:00,4399,  I have a couple other BPS reels and have not had a grease problem and like you say BPS stands behind their products unlike another store and reel company that shall remain nameless!!!
565946,misfish,2011-03-25 20:35:00,29133," If Im wrong here, Im wrong,but I recall being told the BPS reels were made by Shimano or through contact."
565949,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 20:39:00,4399,  I thought it was Pflueger!
565952,GBW,2011-03-25 20:55:00,8460,    I'll ask while I'm there tomorrow.
565954,irishfield,2011-03-25 21:02:00,26272,"And you guys question your better halfs when they run out to a shoe sale, when they already have a good pair......  More baits for the bottom of the big tackle box that'll never see water...  (yah.. I know.. I'm one to talk! LOL)"
565961,bucktail,2011-03-25 21:19:00,1857,I was there this morning as well. The guys attacked those table of spinnerbaits like Oprah Winfrey at an all you can eat buffet!!! If you toook your time there were a few good ones in the pile. Im lucky the ddint have any Loomis NRX spinning rods there or I would have been very broke. Picked up a cople inline planer rods and some lure eyes....thats about it
565995,jedimaster,2011-03-25 23:07:00,3472,Nothin left for spinner baits.
566009,fishindude,2011-03-25 23:50:00,220,"^ Thanks for the heads up, was gonna make my way over there to check it out but I guess I shouldn't bother"
566062,Handlebarz,2011-03-26 02:42:00,3790,  Wayne if you dont want them double D's to sit in your box let me know LOL
566068,irishfield,2011-03-26 02:50:00,26272,LOL Mike... someone would have to mail them to me first!!
566071,Rattletrap2,2011-03-26 02:57:00,1652,"  Brian, I believe Gord is correct here. I was told that Pflueger was their major supplier of house brand reels. This info came from a friend and looong time employee of the Headquarters store in Missouri. Of course other companies might produce specific models or types of reel for them. I have had several BPS brand reels for many years and were trouble free."
566075,Handlebarz,2011-03-26 03:05:00,3790,I just thought you needed to be reminded that it was just this week for your last purchase. I have a bunch of them DD's and they work great I had a bunch custom painted for LSC and dang they are great.
566078,targaboy175,2011-03-26 03:27:00,76,i was there this morning ! have to bring my gf to help me to grap another 10  this should last me for a few years !!!!
566082,Raddi55,2011-03-26 04:03:00,5,"I went first thing before class this morning to grab some of the spinners...On my way I was thinking of sitting in the car for a few minutes until BPS opened...you know...so not to look like I was JUST DYING TO GET THOSE LURES!!heh...but when I arrived around 8:50 or so, there was a lineup from the doors almost to the parking lot...wasn't expecting that, though I probably should have.  i was kind of pressed for time, so I picked a few lucky colours, escaped the frenzy and went on my way...Apparently there were more than a few guys that grabbed 10...threw 'em in the car...came back, grabbed 10 more...and so on. A few brought their wives to ""buy 10 for themselves""(good call, gentlemen). I saw one guy carrying around a basket FULL of them, looked like 100 of em! haha (I wish I could have seen the look on his face when he got to the checkout and was told ""10 per customer""  Anywho, on my way home from school I came back to meet a buddy there around dinner time. Nothin' left but some white/chartreuse Super Stainless/T-2'S and the odd Pond Hopper. In hindsight I wish I grabbed more T-1s instead of the SS's this morning (better buy and I reckon the SS's wont last long in pike waters)...but hey, at 2 bucks a pop, I guess I can afford to bust a few this summer.  Gettin' the itch..."
566261,GBW,2011-03-26 22:10:00,8460,I didn't even see them...     mind you all I was thinking about was teh new rod and reel I was getting.  I even had the list from Brian to get them too.  I guess being up since 2:30 was having an affect on me.
566275,GBW,2011-03-26 22:47:00,8460,"Were you with a buddy and pull in front of a dark grey Subaru at 8:50?  If so, that was me in front of you.  I had time to kill after being up since 2:30 AM... HAHA  I was there right when it opened too to pick up a few new things.  The JMS reel being top on my list followed but the new lures.  The rod I picked at the end of it all was never on my short list of rods to look at, in fact it was never on the list at all.      I think I got lucky only spending as much as I did cause I could have spent a whole lot more and then had to beg the Mrs to keep it when she get's home..."
566290,wildeye rainbow,2011-03-26 23:18:00,123,I spent some time and money at the BPS today.  I didn't see too many deals - live target frogs were cheaper this week at CTC as was the Sufix braid. 2 of my must-have items (so I bought them at CTC).  Still it's a fun way to spend an afternoon along with the lunch buffet at the Mandarin that's nearby - although I'm paying for it right now.
565836,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 14:42:00,4399,"Stopped by my favorite store this morning and picked up the Terminator spinner baits 10 for 20 bucks and picked up a BPS JM signiture bait caster for 89 bucks, man what a smooth reel that is way smoother than my new Curado. I should have bought two!!"
565841,GBW,2011-03-25 14:47:00,8460,why did you have to go and say that...  I'm going to get one of those reels...
565852,skeeter,2011-03-25 15:12:00,1907,"Whats the famous last words you will hear when you get there Geoff????  Im sorry, we just sold the last one!"
565855,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 15:16:00,4399,"They had a whole pile of them there at 9:30 in all 3 gear ratios, there was quite the feeding frenzy at the spinner bait bins though!!!"
565857,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 15:17:00,4399,Picked up 6 spools of 660 yd trilene for 5 bucks a spool yesterday aswell!!! super deal.
565858,GBW,2011-03-25 15:18:00,8460,I have a plan Dann.
565869,Stoty,2011-03-25 15:44:00,2910,Where are the daily specials listed?
565871,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 15:46:00,4399,  The last couple of pages in the Spring flyer!
565873,misfish,2011-03-25 15:48:00,29133,"Geoff,if you go,grab me 10 spinner baits.All white with brass culorado/nickle willow blades."
565874,Stoty,2011-03-25 15:48:00,2910,I'm looking at that right now... I don't see them??
565876,Stoty,2011-03-25 15:50:00,2910,Found them....  Guess the laser eye surgery finally kicked in! LOL
565878,Stoty,2011-03-25 15:51:00,2910,"I wonder if there are any spinnerbaits left? I was thinking about going right now, but won't get there until 1ish."
565882,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 15:59:00,4399, There was tons left at 9:30 they had a few tables full and a couple of carts full!!
565883,GBW,2011-03-25 16:04:00,8460,I can if there are any left but I'm going tomorrow.
565886,solopaddler,2011-03-25 16:16:00,8605, Overstock Bait was selling 3000yd spools of Stren Magnathin a while back for $3.99.  I bought several.   If anyone does happen to be at the Vaughn location I'm looking for the Browning Worm binders in all 3 sizes.
565887,misfish,2011-03-25 16:19:00,29133," It,s one day I think,but if thier there go for it."
565888,GBW,2011-03-25 16:20:00,8460,Ok.  It is a 1 day thing but you never know...
565891,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-25 16:35:00,4399, I would have loved to get in on that deal!
565893,Stoty,2011-03-25 16:43:00,2910,I'm on my way....lol.
565900,danbouck,2011-03-25 17:07:00,4380,They still have plenty of spinnerbaits left
565905,MSBruno,2011-03-25 17:42:00,369,"only 1/2 a table of spinnerbaits left at 1PM  these are very small, mixture of ti's and ss, spinnerbaits, buzzbaits, pond hoppers, etc"
565908,adempsey,2011-03-25 17:58:00,1498,"I was at BPS this morning as well.  I went for the daily specials last year and never saw the feeding frenzy I saw today.  It was crazy, lol!   Of course, I stopped by CT on my way home and picked up some stuff and the same spinnerbaits were $10 there.  I was wondering, which ones are the best quality? T-1, T-2 or SS???  I grabbed all T-1's since I thought these were the more expensive of the three."
565917,jedimaster,2011-03-25 18:52:00,3472,Any spinner baits left. I thought this sale was tomorow. crap.
565921,bdox,2011-03-25 19:14:00,329,"Good luck with your BPS baitcaster. Let us know how smooth it is when the pound of grease they lubed up the gears with ends up all over the inside of the reel. At least BPS is good with returns of their own products.  Did anyone notice if they have restocked the Pro Qualifier gore-Tex suits? All the bibs left over were 2xl, 3xl or small. Need the blue in a large."
565923,misfish,2011-03-25 19:31:00,29133," All mine have been fine bdox.Maybe like cars,they were made on a wednesday.LOL All reels require cleaning and lubing a few times a year. As for thier return policy.This is why I went with redhead products.Life time warrenty.This time I put the reciept in the safe.LOL   Geoff,if thats all that left, then forgedaboutit."
