I will be walking... is it still okay for lakers or just perch this day is availble for the ice?  thnx again OFC'ers  bfisher"
565890,Terry,2011-03-25 16:35:00,14456,"well lakers and whitefish are closed so I would say it's not ok...LOL  lots of ice in most locations except shorelines  so you need to find a good spot to get out on the ice, once out there you should be fine.. if there is current or a river mouth near by, the consider it unsafe"
565902,beginner,2011-03-25 17:23:00,542,"thnx for the reply, I didnt know its closed I thought its open all yr for whitefish and laker till end of sept..  but I guess I will try for perch then..  thnx"
565929,camillj,2011-03-25 19:45:00,1988,Not closed everywhere
565937,BillM,2011-03-25 20:01:00,17367," You definitely don't wanna be out on Simcoe fishing for whities and lakers.  You'll be a prime target for the MNR, lol."
565941,toca,2011-03-25 20:11:00,274," Not To Be An Ass But I Did The 1 Hour Driving For Ya.  If You Have Nerves Of Steele(Including A Floater Suit) Then It Would Be Fine.  The Cold Temperature Has Done Some Good But When The Damn Sun Shines Like A bugger The Pressure Cracks Makes Pearl Habour Like Nothing.  There Is Approximately 8-10"" of Ice Where I Was Shorline Had 1""."
565942,toca,2011-03-25 20:14:00,274, Yeah I Hoping I Can One Day Tag-A-Long With Somebody Here For Lakers And Whitefish Next Year.
565943,BillM,2011-03-25 20:23:00,17367," Bring a portable graph and follow the pack.  I usually start just outside the main pack of guys and usually do fairly well    Key is to not sit on fish that aren't biting..  Move until you find an active school.  Also, if you have a boat the May opener for whities is a riot.  A couple of hundred boats, a few crazy guys in dingies and lots of fish."
565944,beginner,2011-03-25 20:30:00,542,thnx guys.. oh I dont want that to happen hehe...  good thing I asked
565948,beginner,2011-03-25 20:38:00,542, how about lake joseph?? is that good guys??
565950,misfish,2011-03-25 20:41:00,29133," So thier crazy, but got lots of fish? LOL  Ya a dingy is not the best choice IMO."
565959,BillM,2011-03-25 21:13:00,17367," I dunno if they caught anything, I think they were more preoccupied trying not to capsize in the 3ft waves, lol"
566080,camillj,2011-03-26 03:49:00,1988,  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001334.pdf  Looks good as far as the regs go .. can't comment on ice safety though.
