Black bear spotted roaming in Pickering 680News staff Mar 23, 2011 15:39:41 PM  Police have issued a warning about a black bear roaming around the Greenwood Conservation Area in Pickering.  A resident out hiking last Friday spotted the adult black bear alongside a creek and the animal didn't react to human presence.  People who live in the area are being told to remove all outside sources of food around their homes and backyards including garbage, compost and bird feeders.  This is the time of year when bears emerge from hibernation and being the search for food."

565217,tdotfisherman,2011-03-23 21:49:00,317,Wow.. Pickering is a haven for animals that shouldn't be there. Wasn't there talk about a Cougar spotting there 2 years ago around Duffins Creek?

565225,camillj,2011-03-23 21:56:00,1988,That was about 30 years ago and she was seen hanging around just outside the Falcons Nest ... on a Thursday night (if memory serves)... but I managed to sneak out the back door
565227,Garry2Rs,2011-03-23 21:59:00,1425,We seldom had this problem when the province had a Spring Bear hunt. But don't worry the politicians will phone Bambi to come and take his friends home!
565323,HTHM,2011-03-24 01:15:00,4082,"Isn't it a little chilly to hunt bare in the spring, I thought mid-summer would be more comfortable???"
565433,Billy Bob,2011-03-24 12:04:00,5865," I'm sure all the local tree hugging politicians will be saying ""Please bare with us""....."
565435,Harrison,2011-03-24 12:06:00,2202,"Great, now I have to share a favourite stretch of river with another angler."
565437,oldphart,2011-03-24 12:16:00,665,"~~~Wife saw it about 1/4 mile from the stables where we keep our horse, on Church, just N. of Taunten R. and later spotted going through MacDonald Trash container."

565459,Twocoda,2011-03-24 13:06:00,4130, lol...where is the motor city mad man!!!!!
565463,bigbuck,2011-03-24 13:09:00,2449, Falcon's Nest was in Scarborough up the road from my old high school....memories I think you may be thinking of Operators in the south end of Pickering off of Brock Rd........
565528,camillj,2011-03-24 16:31:00,1988,Oh trust me .. it was definitely the Falcon's nest ... (I went to L'Am so I am familiar with that neck of the woods) ... and she was Definitely an EASTERN  C-O-U-G-A-R !  But I escaped (narrowly)  At least that's my story and I'm stickin to it
565732,danc,2011-03-25 03:44:00,4677," I don't understand what the problem is. Someone saw a bear? Can you explain just what the problem is? If I had to relate everytime I've seen a bear to a political problem, I wouldn't have time for anything else."
565741,chefboi17,2011-03-25 05:51:00,128,"Sounds like the problem lies in the fact that the bear was not afraid of the hikers. I've seen evidence of bears along the duffins watershed last season but I try to walk with my fishing bag that has hemostats and clippers attached to the side. I've heard that will usually alert the bear that somthing is approaching and scare the bear away. I might consider a can of bear mace though, just incase"
