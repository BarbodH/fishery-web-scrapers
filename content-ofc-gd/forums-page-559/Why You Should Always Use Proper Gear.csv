First off, I had 3 setups where I was thinking of using, and for the hour I had to fish, there probably wasn't even a chance for me using more than 1. Instead of taking a spinning setup or a cranking baitcast setup, out of impulse and me wanting to take out my smoothest combo, I took a $500 dollar flipping setup to go out and cast cranks, jerks, and spinnerbaits.  This combo could barely cast half ounce baits because it was such a broomstick. I was trying to cast about twice as hard as I usually would, and probably got a decrease of about 20% in casting distance. That's no biggie, if the fish were there and I had the right presentation, casting far didn't mean too much right?  Well it did happen, I did hook into a couple of fish only to find my go to spinnerbait has been worn out so bad over the last year that it wasn't even sharp enough to hook myself with it. Worst part is, I got to get a good look at both fish And they were both in the 5-7lb range!!!! I guess I was also kinda lucky to have the flipping setup because I don't own another rod that can make a pike surface on the hookset. Lesson learned, BRING OUT THE RIGHT GEAR, SHARPEN HOOKS, AND GO CATCH FISH!"

I needed line that day, Im a die hard braided line guy but was too cheap to buy a 20$ spool because ""that junk reel was coming off and a new Tierra was going on"" the next payday anyways...   I lost 3 fish because of the crappy hook sets Trilene EXTRA LAME (XL) provides. Was like fishing with a bungee cord.  Lesson learned."
