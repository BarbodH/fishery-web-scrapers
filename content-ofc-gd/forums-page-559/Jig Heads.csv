565014,bubbles,2011-03-23 14:39:00,591,"Anyone know where I can get unpainted ultra minnow jig heads?  Looking for 50-100 of them.  I would prefer to get them in Canada.  I have found light ones, I am looking for 5/8-3/4oz"
565015,Roy,2011-03-23 14:42:00,13728,luremaking.com has them.
565017,bubbles,2011-03-23 14:48:00,591,"Really, I can only find the molds, not the jigs themselves, maybe I am missing something.  Can you shoot me a link?"
565022,Roy,2011-03-23 14:57:00,13728,You're RIGHT! I just checked. It was the ultra minnow spinnerbait heads that I'd seen. You can call Steve or Helene though and see what they say.

565338,chong,2011-03-24 01:28:00,102,Theres a place here in Montreal but not sure if he is still opened. http://www.lcdistributions.com/index.htm
565361,bigugli,2011-03-24 02:18:00,6138,Not really been any demand for the much larger jig sizes for freshwater fishing.
565424,bubbles,2011-03-24 11:12:00,591,  Unless ofcourse you fish the Detroit River!
565456,bigugli,2011-03-24 13:02:00,6138,"I cast minnow jigs for folks fishing the Niagara, and they usually ask for 3/8 or 1/2, so I've never gotten the larger mold."
565710,watertight,2011-03-25 02:50:00,50,"Bigugli, how much do you charge for your ultra minnow jigs?"
565723,bigugli,2011-03-25 03:21:00,6138, Buck a pack
565925,carll2,2011-03-25 19:32:00,443,  order from these guys every year about 500-1000 jig heads...good quality and cheap
566017,watertight,2011-03-26 00:09:00,50,"bigugli, thanks for the quick reply, good to know where I can get 1/4 & 3/80z as I only have the bigger mold."
