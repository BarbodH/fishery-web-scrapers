A paraprosdokian is a figure of speech in which the latter part of a sentence or phrase is surprising or unexpected in a way that causes the reader or listener to reframe or reinterpret the first part. It is frequently used for humorous or dramatic effect, sometimes producing an anticlimax.   1. Do not argue with an idiot. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.  2.

How is it one careless match can start a forest fire, but it takes a whole box to start a campfire?  11. Dolphins are so smart that within a few weeks of captivity, they can train people to stand on the very edge of the pool and throw them fish.  12. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted pay checks.  13. Whenever I fill out an application, in the part that says ""In an emergency, notify:"" I put, ""Doctor"".  14. I didn't say it was your fault, I said I was blaming you.  15. Behind every successful man is his woman. Behind the fall of a successful man is usually another woman.  16. You do not need a parachute to skydive. You only need a parachute to skydive twice.  17. The voices in my head may not be real, but they have some good ideas!  18. Hospitality: Making your guests feel like they're at home, even if you wish they were.  19. I discovered I scream the same way whether I'm about to be devoured by a great white shark or if a piece of seaweed touches my foot.  20. There's a fine line between cuddling and holding someone down so they can't get away.  21. I always take life with a grain of salt, plus a slice of lemon, and a shot of tequila.  22. When tempted to fight fire with fire, remember that the Fire Department usually uses water.  23. You're never too old to learn something stupid.  24.
