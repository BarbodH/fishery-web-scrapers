555767,Doctrt,2011-02-26 23:28:00,141,"Heading up tomorrow with a few buddies to do some laker fishing on lake Joseph.  In the past we've had good days, great days and the odd poor day.  I was just wondering if anyone has been up there lately, and if so, how has it been thus far?  Thanks in advance. Tim"
555779,Skud,2011-02-26 23:57:00,739,Just got back from fishing there yesterday and today. lots of fish showed up on the radar but real finicky. Took a lot of work to get them to hit. The two of us landed only nine over the two days with the biggest being 22 inches. Spoons had the best results.
555789,FishAbout,2011-02-27 00:25:00,106,"minnows are not working as well now.  Some days are better then others, have had to work for them for the most part this winter."
555794,Fang,2011-02-27 00:39:00,1330,"Had a so-so day today (saturday). Marked more trout in 125 and a little deeper. We fished in 109 to start, minnows and spoons. Moved to 135 and went 2-2 on successive drops. Bigger shiners just got knocked around with all the small trout. We had a couple 8""ers  typical joseph fish 12-14"" and lots of them. went 14-20 with  alot of fish later in the day taken on small meegs and minnow with a stinger hook. Fished right on bottom just like fishing for whitefish on simcoe. We walked out 2 miles pulling the 2 man hut and hardly noticed it on behind  18"" laker was todays big fish, saw one group with a 3-lber  wear cleats as there is very little snow and it's slippery"
555803,FishAbout,2011-02-27 00:56:00,106,I have been catch less fish but bigger. Don't seem to get much under 2 pounds. Largest today was 10 pounds.  Did not fish deeper then 75ft.
556164,camillj,2011-02-28 02:09:00,1988,Try a little shallower .. 40 - 60 FOW ... for quality vs quantity.... and dont be afraid to go smaller with the shiners... and a little aggressive jiggin never hurts either
556293,Court R,2011-02-28 14:35:00,213,"I was up that way last week, lots of dinks in the deep water 100+ feet,give it a go in under 50' that where I found the bigger ones.  "
556334,BillM,2011-02-28 16:09:00,17367,One thing I learned this year is that fishing Simcoe for lakers and whities REALLY skewed my perception on how deep these fish really should be.  40-60ft is where I'd be starting.
