While the wives are doing their thing, the men are going to be heading out and  possibly be doing some fishing - depending on water conditions.  Can anyone be kind enough to provide an update on the water conditions? Is there still a lot of ice? or has most of it melted? We'd like to do some shore fishing. I live in Brampton, so I wouldn't be able to drive out there just to find out the conditions myself; otherwise I would.  If anyone could provide an update, I would really appreciate it.  Thanks OFC'ers, A2F (Rob)"

565911,bucktail,2011-03-25 18:08:00,1857,With this forcast it may refreeze before it starts to open up anymore. There calling for a cold spring...they have got it right so far.
