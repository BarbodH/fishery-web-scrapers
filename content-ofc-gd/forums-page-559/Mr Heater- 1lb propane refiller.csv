564627,pics,2011-03-22 19:36:00,1268,Lowes in East Hamilton has them on clearance for $15....It's a small device that transfers propane from the 20 lb tanks to the 1 lb tanks.It pays for itself in only 4 refills. I'm not sure on the legalities of it all but it saves the tanks from going to the dump  .....I have only had 1 that leaked and I put it onto a heater..leak solved... They are on an end isle near the plants etc....
564628,GBW,2011-03-22 19:37:00,8460,"as far as I know all Lowes has them, BBQ section."
564629,irishfield,2011-03-22 19:40:00,26272,Hard item to find in Canada though.. as they're technically not legal here. Grab one while you can... good price!
564630,BFSC Kevin,2011-03-22 19:41:00,1351,I'm right beside one right now. I'm going to grab one! Thanks!
564631,mbac31,2011-03-22 19:45:00,904,I've been doing this for a while now. Great product but not exactly sure if its legal. I do have a gas licence so maybe its ok for me.
564634,Terry,2011-03-22 19:53:00,14456,been doing it for 35 years  it is legal  however it it illegal to transport the tanks once refilled
564641,misfish,2011-03-22 20:13:00,29133,"  Thats why you said here,put these in yer pocket."
564642,Terry,2011-03-22 20:15:00,14456,yes it was propane I was getting you to carried through customs..............
564985,Woodsman,2011-03-23 13:04:00,1286,Actually I believe it's illegal to transport them for commercial purposes.
565076,Homer Is King,2011-03-23 17:12:00,305,That a great idea.  Didn't even think you could get something like that.  I'm hitting Lowe's after work!
565078,Homer Is King,2011-03-23 17:23:00,305,Here a great article on how to refill your disposable bottles.  It looks like the writer takes all proper precautions.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Refill-Disposable-Propane-Tank-from-a-Standard-BBQ/  He's got a great point about getting empty tanks from campgrounds / parks.  This saves you even more money.
565099,Terry,2011-03-23 18:07:00,14456,"the trick is you want the small bottles really cold and you want the big tank warm  so winter time small bottles outside and bring big tank inside to warm up before you do it  summer time big tank outside and bottles in freezer before filling them  big tank upside down and you are best to fill them twice fill then let them stand for 10 minutes in the cold and refill  it is possible to over fill but no worry of them exploding as they would need a lot more pressure then that to explode..but if they are completely filled with liquid propane they will spit out liquid, not gas so the heater will not work right..if that happens just let a bit squirt out...   don't do it in a fish hut, because when you do get it to light the hut will lift off the ground..at that point knuckle hair and eyebrows will be optional ...  after a few of years of use some valves do stick open and the propane will all leak out of the 1lb bottle..(if you take good care of them and put the black caps back on them between uses this may not happen..I don't)  you can screw it onto the heater to stop it or have a blowtorch ready to screw onto it to stop the leaking......once you use a leaking valve bottle throw it out  I have had 2 do it in the last 3 years...no big deal"
565115,GBW,2011-03-23 18:36:00,8460,"HAHA, do tell how you know this Terry..."
565118,skeeter,2011-03-23 18:38:00,1907,"""don't do it in a fish hut, because when you do get it to light the hut will lift off the ground..at that point knuckle hair and eyebrows will be optional ...""  inquiring minds what to know. you know this how Terry????"
565119,Terry,2011-03-23 18:38:00,14456,advise I give is always form personal experience....enough said....LOL:whistling:
565132,irishfield,2011-03-23 18:54:00,26272,"That was the best moment of 2010... for US anyhow.. Terry not so much !  And as he says, although I didn't think it was possible, you can definitely overfill them. Lloyd almost burned down my newly renovated bathroom when he sparked up the portable shower unit one night! Liquid flames..."
565341,Terry,2011-03-24 01:34:00,14456, if only we had video
565343,camillj,2011-03-24 01:40:00,1988,And you wonder why i always make excuses about coming up there !
565412,Handlebarz,2011-03-24 09:59:00,3790,Dang good post I had forgotten about this device I think I might hit lowes today as I need new 1 lbs tanks cool reminder.  Thanks for the chuckle Terry
565761,Homer Is King,2011-03-25 11:35:00,305,"I went by Lowe's on Wednesday and pick up an adaptor.  I went by again on Thursday to pick one up for my buddy (his Lowe's was sold out).  It turns out mine is out of stock now as well!?  I ask the guy and he checks his computer.  ""That's the wierdes thing"" he says. ""We sold 4 yesterday...We only sold 4 ALL last year!""  Did this post cause a run on this adaptor??  Could that be the power of OFC!"
565885,Terry,2011-03-25 16:16:00,14456,yes it is  pretty scary if you ask me
565892,ch312,2011-03-25 16:38:00,1590, thats the exact reason why many people are reluctant to post their fishing spots online and get angry when others post honey holes....  im goin to get my adapter today
