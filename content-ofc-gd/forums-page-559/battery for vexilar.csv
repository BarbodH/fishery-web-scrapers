565319,babaganoush,2011-03-24 01:12:00,105,In need of a new battery for my unit and wondering if there is anywhere around the guelph area that would sell them.  Thanks
565321,Lunkerhunter,2011-03-24 01:13:00,455,radioworld has them. 35 dollars i believe. might be worth the drive.
565332,irishfield,2011-03-24 01:22:00,26272,Local alarm company..
565559,sirfish,2011-03-24 18:52:00,175,There is a battery place in hamilton that has them for about $20 i believe..not sure of the name.
565904,SylvanOwner,2011-03-25 17:39:00,266,I know not Guelph but LeBaron's are about $30
565907,fishnsled,2011-03-25 17:58:00,3520,I've been using these guys for a few years now. Last time I ordered it was there the next day. No complaints.  Total Battery
565932,dwc67,2011-03-25 19:48:00,140,x 2 these didn't cost me a cent and i got 10 of the 35 amp/hr ones 
565947,Fisherman,2011-03-25 20:38:00,7201," Well, didn't you score big, that's handy, I've still got a 7A one that has to be around 20 years old, date stamp of 32/89, still has enough to power the F/F for a couple days."
565951,irishfield,2011-03-25 20:43:00,26272,Best I've got so far are the 9ah batteries out of APC computer back up supplies. Exact same size as the 7ah...
565956,Terry,2011-03-25 21:08:00,14456, if you are going to buy one the 9ah is a better battery for the price
