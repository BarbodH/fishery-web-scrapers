565500,johnnyb,2011-03-24 15:03:00,3413,"Amazing video...but when that thing swam right back in to get stuck a second time, I think I'd be adding the harpoon attachment to the claw and serving up fresh marlin steak for dinner"

565811,Mike01,2011-03-25 13:39:00,378,I'm pretty sure that was a swordfish. I wonder how long it was stuck in there before they realized it??
565838,ehg,2011-03-25 14:46:00,2666,I guess they removed it so it wouldn't damage wires with its bill. Or did they remove it to save its life? Regardless great video and nice work removing it.
565848,Carp,2011-03-25 14:57:00,1488,How did they even know that fish was stuck down there ??? Good job of getting it free though.
