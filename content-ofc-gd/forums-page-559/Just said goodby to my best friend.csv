565508,Squid,2011-03-24 15:17:00,1656,"So sorry to hear the news Cliff; Not easy saying goodbye to a friend who nver questioned you and was always there for you no matter how hurt he was. My Ben is 15 years old and he is a cross between Golden Retriever and Collie with a bit of Sheperd in him. He is 105 lbs and still kicking, well not kicking but still around. He has been having trouble standing up too and the day is coming when we will have to say goodbye to the most good natured, laid back, easy going intelligent dog I ever met or owned. I know in my heart that I have been blessed with the best luck a man could ever have, a dog that unequivocally loves me and anyone that comes to greet him.  I believe that you and Sue had the exact same relationship with Andy, God bless him and he is in Dog heaven chasing after what ever he wants."
565577,lovetofish,2011-03-24 19:28:00,500,"I feel for u, but u really did whats best for him.  My golden retriever is just over 3 years old now and i can't imagine loosing him already.  Sounds like he had a great life and u had a great time with him!  Keep the memories close.  lovetofish"

565620,Black_Blade,2011-03-24 21:27:00,258,"Reading your post was like watching a rerun of Old Yeller, tears welling up and everything...pretty soon I will be in the same boat, have an old guy who's pushing 13 and is having rough days with arthritis in his front paws and his hearing playing tricks on him.  So I'm bracing myself...got two other younger ones to take the edge off it, but hey, he's got the seniority!  You'll remember all the good times and who knows maybe another little guy will step into your lives.  Nothing like a few chewed up shoes and slippers to keep you distracted"
566357,ccmtcanada,2011-03-27 02:28:00,7971,"We have chatted a bit back and forth through PM's, but I wanted to say that I have many great memories of Andy...and he will never be forgotten."

564777,bigugli,2011-03-23 00:48:00,6138,"So sorry to hear this Cliff. It is hard to even think about, let alone deal with. Your Andy was family, not just a pet. Lucky is 15 and getting close to her time as well. You did right by your dog, and that is the important thing.  Sorry for the mismash of thoughts. Sad news About a loved friend always evokes a whole bunch of feelings"
564917,Sinker,2011-03-23 04:25:00,8692,"I tell ya Cliff, its gotta be the hardest thing a man has to do. I've been there twice now, and it never gets any easier. I know how you feel. Its so hard when you know deep down, that its the right thing to do. I found for me, the best thing was to get another one to take thier place.  Its the only downfall with dogs. They just don't last forever. 14 years is great, for any dog.  He will live on in your heart and memories my friend. That, I know for sure. I think about my passed dogs all the time, and it always brings a smile to my face.  S."
564939,tknohpy,2011-03-23 09:53:00,162,So sorry for your loss Cliff...harder than losing human companion sometimes.
564941,Tarzan's Jane,2011-03-23 10:21:00,1183,"Very sorry to hear this and like so many have said, you did the right thing.  The grieving part will be bitter sweet. Brought a smile to my face when I read FUR-NITURE.  Keep watch for he is going to let you know that he's okay.  A good friend had to put her cat down last summer, the cat was 14 years old and loved butterflies.  When they got home from the vet, the backyard was full of butterflies.  They had never seen that many - ever - and it gave them great comfort."
564942,Jer,2011-03-23 10:22:00,1426,"So sorry to hear, Cliff. I just gave Moosy an extra hug."

565199,Big Cliff,2011-03-23 21:09:00,6899,"Thank you one and all for your words of understanding, for posting the pictures, and for all the PMs. Those of you that have been here before know how much they all mean and how much they really help. It makes you feel that you are not alone.  They say the price of love is grief, I guess we loved him a lot. They say that time will heal! I don't know if it will really heal but it will help us to walk in the door without the tears when we don't hear his foot steps comming down the hall to great us. It will take time, this we know.  Reading and re-reading all your posts sometimes cause the tears to flow but each and everyone of them are helping us cope. Thank you all!"
565210,express168,2011-03-23 21:34:00,327,"Sorry you had to do it Cliff, I am in the same process. I have a lab/rodesian ridgeback cross that is 12 years old now, he has been a cherished member of the family but I am seeing him struggle upstairs and being tentative with his right leg (hip). A dog will never let you know they are in pain or suffering, I believe I will be in the same situation as you soon so I can understand how hard a decision it is."
565306,Rattletrap2,2011-03-24 00:54:00,1652," Sorry to read this Cliff and Sue. My condolences go out to you both. It has only been a few short months for us since we had to do the same thing. I think Wayne nailed it. The coming home part still hurts when there is no one there to greet us and at bed time, something still feels missing. All those years of our nightly routine are hard to get past. Take care."
565316,Rich Clemens,2011-03-24 01:06:00,3131,That's tough Cliff.  Been 3 years since I put mine down ... still miss her.   Have her pictures here at home and at work.   Never will be another one like her.  My tribute and remembrance is my avatar.

564547,Big Cliff,2011-03-22 16:36:00,6899,"Katiebo's Andy, 14 years 3 months. His health had been failing for a while now but this morning I got a call from Sue to let me know that Andy couldn't stand anymore so I turned around and headed back home. We took him over to the vets and they confirmed our worst fears, it was time.  I got Andy from a breader in McHenery Illinois in the middle of Jan. in the worst snow storm of the winter. He was only 6 1/2 weeks old but it was love at first sight. I had looked for over a year for just the right pup and was lucky enough to get first pick of the litter. Funny thing is, I think Andy picked me rather than the other way around.  From that day on we were seldome apart for more than a day or two at a time. We trained together, hunted together, fished together (fishing was just another form of hunting to Andy). Over the years Andy won so many awards from his very first field trial at 5 1/2 months it was obvious that Andy was special, he filled a wall with them but most of all he won the hearts of everyone that knew him, didn't matter if you liked dogs or not.  We were quite a team always looking out for each other, he didn't have a mean bone in his body but would stand his ground when he had to or if he thought someone was a threat to Sue or I.  A few years ago when he was having trouble getting up onto our bed, I built him a set of stairs so he could get up when he wanted and in our house it was called FUR-NITURE for a reason!  Anyway, I know I am rambling but so many OFNr's have met Andy that I just had to let them know!  OK, I got to go now."
564550,solopaddler,2011-03-22 16:39:00,8605,"Sad news Cliff. From someone who's been through it before, condolences.  Time will heal the wound and you'll just remember the good times."
564551,Fisherman,2011-03-22 16:41:00,7201,"Sad, sad moment.  You had the gumption to keep him from suffering any further, the best an animal lover can do."

564605,skeeter,2011-03-22 18:25:00,1907,We are sad to hear this Cliff. Remember the good times and keep your chin up. He was the best friend you had and You and Sue were the best friend he had !!!! He was blessed to be with you guy's and he gave it right back.
564610,Big Cliff,2011-03-22 18:36:00,6899," Andy was a German Short Haired Pointer: They are a versitle hunting dog. Have the instincts of a pointer, the nose of a blood hound, the web feet of a retriever, and the love of a mother.  I am sorry, I just can't figure out how to post a picture right now! I am having trouble just thinking but thanks for asking."
564618,Spiel,2011-03-22 19:07:00,9065,My sincerest condolences Cliff and Sue.  We are most certainly blessed by their companionship but alas it is (unfortunately) only for a short time. I however (like so many here) would not ever give up that short period of time.
564621,Joey,2011-03-22 19:16:00,9122,"I'm really sorry to hear that Cliff, my thoughts are with you today.  My 17 year old cat/buddy had a rough night last night and I thought if he doesn't come around by noon, its probably time, but he was fine when I went home at lunch.  The bad days are coming more often so I know it will be coming soon now, and I'm not looking foward to it just like I know you were not.  Pets are really little, furry family members and they really are missed when they are gone.  Sorry Cliff.  Joey"
