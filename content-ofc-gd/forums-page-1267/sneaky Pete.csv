36422,lew,2007-02-19 16:38:00,12767,"Sneaky Pete's are actually a very good musky bait, especially when used in shallow water, among the weeds.  They have a reversed skirt on them and if you pause your retrieves every 5' or so, drop your tip back, then begin cranking again, you can get the skirt pulsating, which is very effective for attracting the fish.  A very small bait by musky standards, but also an excellent bait, and particularily good when you can get the action working properly.  I've had good success with them in shallow water and this is one that came out of 5'  "
