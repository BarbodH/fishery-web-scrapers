36437,Buddy,2007-02-19 17:30:00,2,What day can you ice fish on Nipissing till?  I read somewhere that it was extended an additional week?  Thanks.
36439,Clampet,2007-02-19 17:32:00,1947,"12 Midnight March 15, 2007."
36449,bigfish1965,2007-02-19 18:18:00,3382,You can icefish until there is no more ice. However the non-portable huts must be off by March 15th
36502,Guest skeeter99,2007-02-19 21:04:00,0,"maybe i am seeing things in the regs, but division 27 lake nipissing is jan1 to march 7 and victoria day to oct 15th so no u cannot fish untuil there is no ice left unless u want a fine   so the last day would be march 7th until 11:59 pm"
36513,Clampet,2007-02-19 21:22:00,1947," How old are the regs you read? I beleive there was an amendment, providing an extra week to carry it over to the 15th of March this year."
36517,Northhunter,2007-02-19 21:31:00,214,"I thaught the 2007 regs weren't approved yet, and we were to follow the 2006 regs?  Or was that changed..."
36528,Guest skeeter99,2007-02-19 21:46:00,0,"yes u are correct for the ""2008"" fishing season right on the first page of the fishing regulations there is a HUGE notice saying to follow the old regs because the new ones are not ready yet until further notice   so it would be march 7th"
36530,stasbrute,2007-02-19 21:54:00,206,Thank you to our lovely Government for making things so clear
36535,Guest skeeter99,2007-02-19 21:58:00,0,"no clampet is right i did take effect jan 1 2007  march 15th for nip  The following regulation changes take effect January 1, 2007:  The walleye season will be open year-round on all of Lake Erie. The catch and possession limit for walleye in the eastern basin of Lake Erie will increase to six fish from four.  On Lake Nipissing, the winter season for walleye and some other species is being extended by one week. This change, along with a longer fall season and changes in catch limits, will apply to the entire lake including the West Arm.  On Golden Lake, the walleye fishery will re-open after being closed for five years. There will be a 50 cm minimum size limit, and a catch and possession limit of two walleye (under a sport fishing licence) and one walleye (under a conservation fishing licence). The province is extending the bass season across the province by moving the opening day from the last Saturday in June to the fourth Saturday in June."
36555,IceguyD,2007-02-19 22:46:00,6,"Skeeter and Clampet are right the season ends on March the 15th at midnight. The season for muskie, bass and pike has been extended in the fall from October 15th and will now close on November 30th. Walleye will however still close on October 15th. Cheers Don"
36560,Jer,2007-02-19 22:56:00,1426,I'm so confused....
36581,Clampet,2007-02-19 23:50:00,1947,I'm always right.
36583,Northhunter,2007-02-19 23:54:00,214,"So am I... confused that is.  So we're to follow the 2006 regs until the 2007 regs are approved. But there's regulation changes that were supposed to be effective Jan 1st, 2007. Are these changes part of the 2007 regs (which we are to disregard until further notice) or mentioned somewhere else altogether??  Even if they were to take effect Jan 1st we're being told to go by the old regs - which would close the season March 7th.  Anyone talk to a hut operator lately? What date are they going by?"
36590,Clampet,2007-02-20 00:06:00,1947,"Google up Ontario Out Of Doors mag, I think they mention it there."
