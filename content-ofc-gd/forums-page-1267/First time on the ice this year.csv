36226,keram,2007-02-19 02:22:00,585,"Finally I’ve stepped on the ice this year. Temperature was little bit on the low side ( I’m a walker without any shelter), but I could not wait any longer  . The trek to the “perch grounds” took about 1.5 hr. Seeing quite few huts in the area I’ve was going to fish I’ve decided to leave the crowd and try some other spots ( looked promising on hydro map). Twenty minutes later first hole ( 27’ ) tried for about 15 min, nothing. I was moving parallel  to the shore, so my distance to parking lot will not change much. Second hole nothing, third the same. After drilling (hand auger) and walking my temperature raised significantly  . Sweating and little bit tired I’ve decided to start my way back to the shore. Few more holes with same result. Now I’m really ticked off and hungry  . Stopped for lunch and little bit of rest. Drilled one more hole (30’ and bottom like a table ), but I will stay here for few minutes anyway. Well, I had to postpone my lunch the action was fast and furious  . Five or six double headers,  range 8-12”. In little bit more then 1.5 hr landed 35 perch and the frenzy has stopped. O.K. I’m more hungry, but not pi**ed  off any more. Finished lunch, checked my bearing to the shore and I’m on my way home ( with the smell of  the fresh fish fry as motivation.)  I did not take too many pictures (cold fingers, numb fingers, and battery dead.  My version of “ automatic fisherman “ in action. It works      The icing was a real problem. See the “snowman” in the middle of the hole. It  took about 5 min for this build-up ( blowing snow). BTW, I think I discover ( or not ) new method to prevent line and guides icing. You see in the picture that my sled has 2 skies attached. To make it easier to pull I’ve used some ski wax on them. Well, I’ve had this wax with me, so I’ve used it on the line and guides. Did not cut the icing 100% but what a difference.    After camera refused to cooperate on ice  I’ve took the  picture of kitchen sink   little bit later.    Last two pictures are from Sunday. Went to the Bog, but nothing to show, just sunshine then sunset, -30 wind-chill ( hope you see the wind blowing)    "

36466,keram,2007-02-19 19:01:00,585,"Hopefully next time will be next weekend. After walking 4-5 km in the snow (12"" + deep + some deeper drifts + some slushy spots without snow shoes) I feel little bit ""wasted"" today   . In the morning I could not convince my butt to go to the shower ( waaaaay too painfu  l  ). I hope I will recover for the weekend"
