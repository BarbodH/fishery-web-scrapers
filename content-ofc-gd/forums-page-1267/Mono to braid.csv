36249,FishFinder,2007-02-19 03:02:00,481,anyone know what the equivelant to 6 and 8 lb mono is in braid (diamater wise) Thanks
36252,taper,2007-02-19 03:08:00,611,I am not positive but I think 8 lb. mono is equivalent to 30 lb. power pro.
36274,douG,2007-02-19 03:46:00,2693,"6  / 8 lb mono is 20 / 30 lb power pro.  Use a Uni  / Uni knot to join the two.  with braid like PP or Tufline, you only need two knots: the uni knot and the palomar knot.  Jes' let me know if you need more info about PP.  Fishfinder, this is easy info to find;  you looked, right?"
