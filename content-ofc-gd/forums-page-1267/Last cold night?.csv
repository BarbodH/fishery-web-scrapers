36213,Garyv,2007-02-19 02:06:00,547,Just looked at the long range forecast for Southwestern Ontario and even though right now 9:06 PM it's -12C ( 4F ) according to the predictions the cold spell will end starting tomorrow with temps above freezing.  Suppose to be like this for a week or so with possible rain mixed in.  If true be careful all you ice fishermen and watch for changing conditions.

36299,camillj,2007-02-19 05:54:00,1988,"Just another little note of caution guys ... and this is VERY serious ... I was out on Lk Joseph this weekend and while there was proabably 12 inches of ice .. at least 7 of this was 'bad' ice ... if any moisture at all gets into it, it COMPLETELY loses its integrity very quickly so please do NOT go on the basis of the ice you saw last weekend"
