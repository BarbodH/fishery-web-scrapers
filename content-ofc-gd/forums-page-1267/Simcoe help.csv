I don't have a sled or atv so I don't know any places where I can walk out not to far. What are some basic lures I should bring with me. Iv heard meggs work real good but what do you tip them with?? Iv also heard you have to chum your holes before fishing or its very hard to catch them, is that true? Anyone?  -Fishnpro"
