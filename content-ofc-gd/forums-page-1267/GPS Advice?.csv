36050,douG,2007-02-18 19:23:00,2693,Anyone have experience with a Garmin GPSMap 76 CSX?  Or willing to suggest alternatives to this Kick Donkey machine?  TigerDirect has it for $375USD.
36052,Roy,2007-02-18 19:26:00,13728,"How about a map, Doug less."
36053,Carp,2007-02-18 19:34:00,1488,Sorry douggiE. No experience with that unit.  I have a 17 year Lowrance Sonar/GPS on the boat and a Magellan hand held that's a few years old.
36054,SlowPoke,2007-02-18 19:35:00,2984,"I have the base model GPSMap 76 and I'm impressed with it. Good battery life, easy to use, nice size screen and the only gripe would be needing an external antenna for in-vehicle use. The antenna issue might be commen amongst all hand helds, dunno, this is my first. If I place it on the dash with a view through the windshield it's fine but I have to pick it up to read it. As I understand it, the CSX is colour with more memory and some nifty extra features.  -Brian"
36065,camillj,2007-02-18 20:14:00,1988,Doug I got the Lowrance H20c (handheld) last year with the 6 CD Mapcreate Cdn Topo map and a 1gig mem card ... I absolutely LOVE it every road and every pond show up on the maps ... very accurate and water 'resistant' .. supposedly even floats - though I havent tested that part ... sorry I have no info on the unit you described but if you're looking at options consider this one ... you can download your maps from anywhere in Canada ... only thing I am waiting for is better marine charts to come out (supposedly this year)
36067,tjsa,2007-02-18 20:22:00,1578,"Same as slowpoke, my bud owns the Map76(I own the GPS V), and that is about the only gripe he has(mine has the removable antenna, which is why I bought it, made a cable up for it at work). We don't use ours for marine use though, only land. We do have them with us during our fishing exploits, but not for hydrographic purposes. I love the track log, lots of new roads and trails up here, set it to record, and download when I get home. Make my own maps up now with the roads and trails on them."
36172,Rob,2007-02-19 00:57:00,467,"Hey douG, I went to TigerDirect.ca and .com and could not find it, was it an instore special? If so that is a very good price over 450usd. I have a Garmin Etrex which I like but I would like to get the colour version. I have the maps with mine and find Garmin's support to be very good, (even gave me a free software upgrade) Hope it helps you a little.  Rob C"
36175,mikeh,2007-02-19 01:06:00,824,"I bought the garmin vistac and I should have bought the one your looking at, everytime at the front of the boat I keep thinking I am going to drop it over the side. The floating version would have been worth the extra money. and at $375 that is a really good price."
36198,Terry,2007-02-19 01:46:00,14456,"I have the map76cs, which is one step down from that one and I love it there is nothing more that I need in a  portable gps, it does it all has a great list of add-on maps I don't think you could go wrong with it"
36207,douG,2007-02-19 02:00:00,2693,"Thanks everyone for their replies, except Roy.  Jerk.  I'm checking cause i think that price might be outa NY, gonna keep looking in the GWN."
36211,Smokey,2007-02-19 02:03:00,1278,Doug I have the 60csx and pretty much the same unit. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the garmins. I'm really impressed with mine.
36229,Tdel,2007-02-19 02:24:00,393,"I have been thinking of purchasing a Garmin Map76Cx because I have heard nothing but  great reviews about them. The price you quoted for the Map76 CSx ($375) is the best that I have seen so far.  Radio World and Durham Radio both have them on for $449 Canadian.  I don't think you can go wrong with the purchase of the Map76CSx.  Tom  Edit: Forgot to include ""great"" reviews."
36285,Deano,2007-02-19 04:13:00,767,"I have the 60CSX, basically the same unit, but different casing because the 76CSX floats. You'll love it, best investment for any outdoors enthusiast. You'll be able to get reception even in your basement. And the geocaching features will bring you to an all new world of outdoors."
36312,Big Cliff,2007-02-19 11:30:00,6899,"I have both the garmin 76 & the 76 Map. Love them! excellent quality, good battery life, and they do float! (and I'm really glad they do or I wouldn't have two LOL)."
36501,SlowPoke,2007-02-19 21:03:00,2984,If you're buying a Garmin and want nautical software Cabela's has the BlueChart on sale now.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...sp?id=cat601399
36730,carll2,2007-02-20 04:02:00,443,does the garmin blue chart have the lakes in quebec? ok yeah and on the cablas site it says the  blue chart has limited compatability with the legend..what does that mean?
