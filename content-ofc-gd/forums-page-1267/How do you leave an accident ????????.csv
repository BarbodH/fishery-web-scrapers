36347,dustink,2007-02-19 13:28:00,526,"Wow!  Glad Sheri is going to have a full recovery....and remember, somewhere down the road, that nimrod will get his....  dk"
36367,Headhunter,2007-02-19 14:25:00,5703,"Best wishes and a speedy recovery! Yah really gotta be careful out there, way too many people think they are invincible and have no regard for their fellow man! HH"
36373,snag,2007-02-19 14:41:00,1932,I can't believe that Lew.  I'm at a loss for words.  You could have lost your daughter.  I can't imagine how that must feel.
36378,Joey,2007-02-19 14:50:00,9122,"Geez Lew, that's just aweful.  But I see it in my occupation all the time.  Karma will come back and bite them in the you know what for it.  Hope Sheri is feeling better.  Joey"
36385,ryanheritage,2007-02-19 15:03:00,180,"I hope everything goes well and your daughter is ok and mends quick. I know the pain of dealing with the morons on the dvp they risk life and limb for a carlength. I hope all is ok with you and your daughter, and lets hope that person gets a flat or gets pulled over by the karma police!"
36390,caper,2007-02-19 15:12:00,210,"That's brutal Lew, glad to hear the she is going to be ok. Scary stuff but unfortunately an everyday occurrence as you know. Hope she has a speedy recovery.."
36407,Squid,2007-02-19 16:05:00,1656,"Yup, see the idiots on the road every day. Sheri, glad to hear that you are ok and hope all heals well."
36436,bigbuck,2007-02-19 17:23:00,2449,"There is NO defence for speeding. Yes, I go over the limit by a bit when there is no traffic but when there are a lot of cars around, WATCH OUT FOR GRAMPS!! Saving a few minutes is not worth it, it only takes a split second and you could kill yourself or even worse, KILL OR MAIM another person. Every time I got a speeding ticket, I never argued with the officer, I just took my medicine. And speaking of moron drivers, I just saw a guy in a blue Lexus soccer mom-mobile drive off after getting pulled over by the 401/DVP area, takes off like a bat out of hell, leaves me standing (I'm doing 105), and by the time I reached Avenue road, guess who got pulled over again?? What a Moron!!!!"
36275,wuchikubo,2007-02-19 03:52:00,1114,"This reminds me of an accident I saw just in front of me over the bayview ramp about 15yrs ago. I was lucky not to be involved but it was about the same, I was just over the limit at about 95 in the left lane when a moron is flashing his high beams to get me out of the way, the moron decided to cut 2 lanes over the the right and then back into the left lane not seeing there was another car ahead of me, t-boned the car in front of me and then had the nerve to put the car into reverse when they came to a stop, hitting another minivan passing the slowed traffice in the right lane!!! I remember 2 guys and a girl getting out of the CRX, felt like getting out and bashing them (but that wouldn't have gotten anywhere).  Anyways, Lew and Sheri, I hope Sheri feels and gets better soon. Why don't these aggressive drivers ever think about others on the road!! If they wish to take their own lives, do it without involving other innocent people!  Stan"
36276,Jigatollah,2007-02-19 03:57:00,53,It's too bad a plate number couldn't have been taken down to nail that idiot. Hopefully someone did and it's just a matter of time to nail them. Speedy recovery to Sheri Lew.
36327,Chris,2007-02-19 12:40:00,405,"Glad to hear that Sherri is, for the most part, OK Lew. Hopefully the idiot will get what's coming to him.  Unfortunately we will always share the road with idiot drivers. Heck, a while back, there was even a thread on OFC where several of the respondants defended their excessive speeds, with many of them disrespecting drivers who ""held them up"".  Slow down!!!!!"
36341,lew,2007-02-19 13:01:00,12767," And that's the biggest part of the problem Chris, far too many folks think their driving skills are so superior to everyone elses, they don't need to slow down for poor road conditions or heavy traffic. They figure they can just go roaring along on their merry way and the whole world will just move over and let them through,  and to hell with anybody that dares to get in their way.  Morons !!!!"
36028,Beans,2007-02-18 17:41:00,3339,"DAMN !!!...dang' idiots...  Glad to hear Sherri is going to be OK...  Somewhat the same happened to Maribeth the first winter we were up her...she was on her way home from grocery shopping just after dark and because it was snowing quite a bit she was driving slower than the limit...too slow for some jerk in a pick-up...he went flying past her causing her to be blinded by the crap his truck threw up and she ended upside down in a ditch...luckily she had her seatbelt done up and was not injured,except for shock, but the car was a write-off...A good samaritan and his wife helped her down and out of the vehicle to wait for the police but it all happened too fast for taking down license numbers..."
36029,OhioFisherman,2007-02-18 17:41:00,6623,"I hope you get well soon Sheri. Not driving much doesn`t bother me Lew, I am not graying as fast! It`s a circus on the roads, and to many clowns with a drivers license."
36044,tjsa,2007-02-18 18:46:00,1578,"Yes, glad to hear Sheri is going to be OK Lew.  You're wondering how someone can leave an accident scene? That ingrate probably did not even know what mayhem he cause behind him, probably never looked back, was basically driving with blinders on, what was ahead of him was the only thing worth his attention.  Maybe we should have cameras in vehicles now, much like cockpit voice recorders on aircraft, to record the last 10 or so minutes during operation on a repeating loop. Might help to catch the people who cause this crap to happen, and make them pay for it."
36045,Gerritt,2007-02-18 18:47:00,6129,"Lew,   WOW... I am glad your daughter is ok.. things could have been alot worse, she had angels with her for sure....   Gerritt."
36057,FishHeadRic,2007-02-18 19:50:00,226,"Lew, I learned to drive on Long Island and NYC and can honestly say that Toronto has some of the worst drivers I have ever seen!  I gave up my car when I moved up here 8 years ago and God's honest truth I'm glad I did. Some of the drivers up here just scare the Bajesus out of me. I'm not sure if it's the advent of cell phones or just the fact that a lot of the folks up here just can't drive with any sort of concideration. At least Sheri's alive and that's what really counts here. Send her our best on a quick recovery.     That DVP is just a horror some times.   Ric De La Cruz"
