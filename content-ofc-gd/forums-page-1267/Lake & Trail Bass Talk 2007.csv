36365,David Chong,2007-02-19 14:18:00,836,The next leg of the BASS TALK 2007 seminar sessions takes us to LAKE & TRAIL located in Perth on Sat. March 3rd! Doug Brownridge and myself will be spending this Sat. at the Ottawa Sportsman Show. We will be there to promo the event and will accept registrations on site! We'll be walking the floor and hanging out at the Minn Kota or Lake & Trail booths. Feel free to stop us and talk a little bass fishing! It's a can't miss event and if you're not sure talk to anyone who attended the first session in Vaughan! See photo of the Day 1 lecturers at the Vaughan event below!  Dave Chong
