36187,Whopper,2007-02-19 01:25:00,2174,Well I had such a good time yesterday that I went back today. It was a lot colder today but the sun was out. Kinda of weird staring at a hole in the ice not paying to much attention to what was going on around me when all of the sudden I hear sleigh bells and there getting louder  :???: Turned around and watch these guys pull up to shore. This little lake is located in a metro park that has a working farm from the 1800's and they came to harvest ice the old fashion way it was kinda of neat to watch.    Well after watching for a while had to get at it because I only had a couple hours to fish. Picked up right where I left off last evening.     I had fun again today  Whopper
