35836,Joey,2007-02-18 03:05:00,9122,"Just got back from the show and the mini swill.  I have to say, it was the same as last year and Paul and I discussed that we sure miss the old days when you could barter for a deal.  I think those days are gone forever tho.  Oh well, with TJ coming through with the admission tickets (thanks bud   ), we managed to get a few things that are hard, if not impossible to find at the stores we ususally shop, and at 15% off with no tax also, we did pretty good .  The special edition Lund was a beaut (I think Fishindevil referred to it in his post).  I took a couple of pics of what stood out for me, the giganto fishfinder (you could watch a movie on that thing) and the ridiculously large Merc on the back - talk about hair by Mercury   .         We seemed to have missed alot of people by the time we got there and just by luck got out of our vehicle at the very moment TJ, Monique and Avery were walking back to their car   .  Chatted for a bit and they were off to do some family things.  Met up with Maureen and her nephew, DouG and Loonietoon, all of whom we met up with later for a bit of grub and chat at Arizona Bar & Grill.  Lexxington and his wife and kidlets showed up too.  It was nice to talk to all of you and share some laughs and great food.  Some pics at Arizona's.  Maureen & DouG    Paul    DouG, Me and Loonietoon    Lexxington & his newborn Max (both are still on the bottle   )    Cheers,  Joey"
35841,Greencoachdog,2007-02-18 03:11:00,8163,Great pics and report Joey!!!
35842,Clampet,2007-02-18 03:13:00,1947,"Thanks, Joey, I was supposed to go to Arizona's and I usually am a man of my word. I went fishing today, and I am exhausted from tramping through the slush, so I elected to stay home.  I prolly would have been boring company anyway because I was sorta wiped out by the fresh air and cardio workout.  Doug if you read this I apologise, I was lookin' forward to having a brewski with you."
35847,SlowPoke,2007-02-18 03:19:00,2984,LOL!! Is that Paul looking at that Verado longingly? Man that Verado is a monster... you'd need a step ladder to change the plugs on it! I'm not even sure it would clear a standard garage door. It makes the kicker look like a Minn-Kota! Nice report Jo and even if it wasn't the best show ever at least you got to hang out with a few members. -Brian
35850,Joey,2007-02-18 03:24:00,9122," Yes Brian, that is Paul, and longingly isn't the word.  I had to wipe the dribble from the corner of his mouth and coax him away with the promise of more beer     It sure is a brute tho eh!  And Clampet, how bad was the slush and snow, we're thinking of going tomorrow, but after driving in the drizzle on the way home, wondered how bad it would be?  Joey"
35852,irishfield,2007-02-18 03:33:00,26272,"Sorry we didn't make it to the show or the restaurant either...our daughter missed the train to TO from Ottawa...so quess what we did instead.  And Joey, I'll give you ""hair by Merc"" for free in June. Mercs are supposed to be BLACK. I even hate the gray ""beard"" on my Verado, and it may see some paint .  "
35855,motv8tr,2007-02-18 03:39:00,2587,"Yup it was a good day, just got home now.  I managed to meet a couple of new people at the show today, Nautifish and John Bacon, saw a few others and missed TJ, Monique, Avery and Rick.  Food and company were good at Arizona's.  As for the show, I liked it, Blake was great helping me get a few more prizes for the G2G next week .  Bit of a long drive home tonight though...got talking with my nephew Rob, seems I missed the 400, didn't realize it until I saw the sign for Brimley road though   , some days I can be a real bone head   .  Managed to get turned around only to get to Innisfil and right into a mini squall...man I'm sick of those things.  Fortunately by the time I got on to the extension it was all good, just some snow covered roads the rest of the way home.  Maureen"
35856,Joey,2007-02-18 03:39:00,9122," Well I'll take you up on that offer Wayne  And I can't believe you said that about the Merc.  Paul stood there and said ""Merc's aren't supposed to be gray, I don't think I could take that, I'd have to paint it.""  Hahahaha, too funny.  Joey"
35863,nautifish,2007-02-18 03:57:00,1416,"man am i ever havin a screwy time with this site, Grrrr That post was not even sopost to be in this thread.......How the hell did that get in here, Blimey!......lol"
35864,SlowPoke,2007-02-18 03:58:00,2984,Not to hi-jack the thread but... I'm with you guys on the gray (beard LOL). I'm not even fussy about all the colour on this one but I'm willing to overlook it for the number on the back http://www.mercurygovsales.com/products/vi...hp?productID=42  -Brian

35876,irishfield,2007-02-18 04:20:00,26272,"What was the actual boat? a 2025 Pro-V? It may be a limited edition...but if that's the price, well that's cheaper than ordering a regular 2025 IFS/SE with those motors and LCX11x on it."
35970,Tybo,2007-02-18 14:49:00,1373,"I was trying to figure out how much it would be, to kick that sucker up to 350hp.  Port and polish, Shave the heads, Go 60 over, EFI it, Nose cone, CLE gears, Tune the living bejusus out of the blower."
36048,SlowPoke,2007-02-18 19:17:00,2984, Take your pick...
