It sure does take a while on dial up though  My boys, well sort of...this is my nepwhew Rob who is staying with me, and his son Ryan....closest I'll get to a son and grandson    This is the little guy being too cute, he'll be coming to visit this weekend    This is Austin, the fence is 5ft high so that will give you an idea of how much snow we have here.    Now all I have to do is work on my resizing skills to get rid of the graininess in the pictures.  Maureen"
