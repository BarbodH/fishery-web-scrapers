36514,Smed,2007-02-19 21:25:00,20,I have been told a few times of people ice fishing for salmon on Geogian Bay.  Does anyone know of where you can go to do this and how you would fish for them and also if its something that is worth giving a shot.  Smed

Rainbows would be closer to shore and you could pick up a Salmon if they were around but I suspect they are to far off shore."

Both have relatively narrow sheltered bays and the ice could setup well. There are loads of salmon there come Spring if I recall correctly.  Try calling the tackle shops up there.  John
