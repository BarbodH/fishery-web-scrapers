35965,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-18 14:42:00,1351,Im looking at a maxxum 50lb but currently have the endura 30. Is it worth it grabbing the maxxum? only reason for me to purchase it is because of the maximizer feature and the more thrust.  i've used the endura only twice and it seems to be sufficient though. but who doesn't want a better toy
35967,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-18 14:46:00,1351,"aswell, the maxxum has the weedless prop 2, tilt tiller and 6inch long  shaft."
35982,Mike the Pike,2007-02-18 15:16:00,3421,For me I would not buy the endura I have a minnekota 46lbs of thrust with a maximiser. when fishing with my buddies on a lake for trout .(electric motors only)my batterie lasts almost twice as long as there enduras.As for the weedless prop which I have it is not totally weedless if you get into the thick weeds you will have to take some weeds off.Spend the extra money on the maxxum and you will use the oars less.unless you want the exercise.MTP
35986,taper,2007-02-18 15:23:00,611,My bow mount has the maximizer feature and I do think it gives more run time on the same charge level which is great as long as the cost of the upgrade isn't too much.
36055,jediangler,2007-02-18 19:40:00,1923,Go for the variable speed control model rather than the one with 5 forward speeds and 3 reverse. It's much nicer to dial in the exact speed you need to control a drift or fight a current. It almost doubles the price but it's worth it in my opinion.
36085,setomonkey,2007-02-18 21:55:00,872,"Quite the coincidence, I was making a decision about buying a Maxxum vs. Endura, and decided on the Maxxum for the variable speed control and longer battery life. It cost more but I wanted the option.  Mike"
36089,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-18 22:15:00,1351,"i wont be buying the maxxum, maybe wait for a really good deal on the maxxum, my endura sells or get rich"
36176,Cookslav,2007-02-19 01:06:00,1457,Have Never used a maxxum...but I like my endura just fine. No complaints. Plenty of power and the battery life seems to be alright as well. But if I compared one maybe I'd be inclined to switch?
