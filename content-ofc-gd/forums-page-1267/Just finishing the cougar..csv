35867,pameladallaire,2007-02-18 04:04:00,470,"I want to thank Dan C. for supplying me with the reference photo for this painting.  I'm deciding on a name, and kind of like ""Secluded"".  Any other suggestions?  It will be going to the Ontario Puma Foundation.  I better sign it before I varnish it.  Pam  "
35874,danc,2007-02-18 04:17:00,4677,"That is incredible Pam. I've been following the progress on your blog. You'll have your release form this week. For the record, here's the photo that I sent to Pam.  "

35887,huntervasili,2007-02-18 04:49:00,1604,"I am just wondering... How many hours does it take to do something that size, and whatever other factors there may be... Really nice though I can believe it took not only a pile of time but just as much dedication and hard work..."

35933,Rich Clemens,2007-02-18 13:20:00,3131,You sure do bring a photo to life with your paintings.  Simply amazing.
35934,motv8tr,2007-02-18 13:23:00,2587,Incredible as always Pam...thanks for continuing to share your talent with us.  Maureen
35937,crappiesteve,2007-02-18 13:27:00,220,"Thats just outstanding Pam,  Steve"
35944,Big Cliff,2007-02-18 13:47:00,6899,"That is just beautiful Pam. I am always amazed at how people like you and Roy (and many others on here) can take a piece of canvas, wood, paper,  some paints, inks, tools, and create something of such beauty!  Thank you so much for sharing!  Cliff"
35969,ChrisK,2007-02-18 14:48:00,2772,"Very well done Pam....I like the ""cougar in the shadows"" look...."
35973,pameladallaire,2007-02-18 14:54:00,470,"Thank you everyone.  You know that I'm not out for compliments.  The majority of my work comes from inspiration provided by OFNers, and they are the amazing ones.  I look at a thread and say, wow, I'd like to paint that!  And Bill; since this was to be a donation, I spent a LOT more time than I normally would on a painting.  I had it almost done and didn't like the result, too bland.  So...I went ahead and started the cougar over.  LOL  I'm not afraid to be my own worst critic, I have to be because I don't even ask my sister for comments along the way.  I do enjoy hearing from the people that follow my work.  They know how long my projects take.  Pam"
36059,GbayGiant,2007-02-18 19:52:00,1780,"That's just amazing, looks like the photo. Why is it backwards from Dans photo though ? was there a mirror involved somewhere."
36289,pameladallaire,2007-02-19 04:19:00,470,"No mirror, just a little before painting photoshop involved. For some reason, I liked it looking left better.  Just my own taste.  Pam"
36293,Deano,2007-02-19 04:26:00,767,"Very nice painting, always share your painting post with the family, I love seeing great outdoors pics and paintings."
36344,dustink,2007-02-19 13:15:00,526,"Great as always, Pam!  dk"
36357,ccmtcanada,2007-02-19 13:53:00,7971,Awesome stuff Pam!  I always love seeing your posts of your work.
