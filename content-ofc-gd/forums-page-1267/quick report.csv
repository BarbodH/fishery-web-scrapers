36237,Clampet,2007-02-19 02:32:00,1947,Thanks fer the report.  Nice Pike.  Did you try Google for the sled parts?
36250,ecmilley,2007-02-19 03:07:00,2163,dootalk.com or hardcoresledder both have good classified sections or just phone the dealer may be fairly inexpensive

Measure the distance between the spring perches on your ski and see what leaf is broken, you may be able to buy just the leaf you need to help keep the cost low. Leaf springs can get pricey even used."
