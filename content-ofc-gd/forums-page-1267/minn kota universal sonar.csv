36241,exterminator,2007-02-19 02:38:00,4,I am looking to pick up a new trolling motor for my boat.  The one I want has the option of a universal sonar.  Does any one have this option if so is it worth it???  Thanks Joe  PS The fish finder that I have is compatible with the universal sonar.
36253,bucktail,2007-02-19 03:09:00,1857,I have it and I find it works perfect. It's hooked to my Lowrance graph on the front and I love it. No extra wires!

The Lowrance was working great. When I went to change spots, I pulled the trolling motor out and took off down the river. I glanced up at the Lowrance and the screen was black. I thought, what the heck is wrong with my Lowrance. Stop the boat and start checking the unit....all wires connected, power is on, everything seems fine. Then it hit me...duhhhhh.....I pulled the trolling motor up, along comes the sonar out of the water too. A few laughs and some teasing afterwards but everything OK."

The only drawback I have is that the unit I am using has sidescan capability which I can't take advantage of with the universal sonar.  Other than that, it is great."
