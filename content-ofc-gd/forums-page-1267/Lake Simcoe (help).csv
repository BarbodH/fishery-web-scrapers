Were planning on just going and having some fun catch a few fish here and there. Not planning on getting a guide or renting a hut. Can anyone share with my a popular spot or some spot there and maybe were to park. The fish were planning on catching are perch crappie or pikerel, doesn't really matter aslong as something is biting."
36719,Master of Bait,2007-02-20 03:47:00,196,"Hey xrap,  If you're just up to scoot around for the day you should go for some perch as they are accessible within a short walk from shore and are readily available.  Lots of areas to access the lake but parking is tricky.  Most of the hut operators will let you park at their place for a fee and you can set out on foot from there.  Tons of info on Simcoe within these pages so browse away and enjoy.  As a novice I can tell you it's not too complicated.  Good luck out there!"
