The plan is to place it on Lake Simcoe at Cooks Bay. I am making it in large sections that can be transported on a large snowmobile trailer to the shoreline, and then assembled before going out onto the ice. However one thing I don't know is how to get it on and off the ice. Are there folks with skidoos or ATVs that will haul them out for some cash at the start and end of the season? Also, any idea where one might store a hut for the off season for some cash? Lastly, does one require a license or permit for a hut?  Thanks for any insights,  John"
