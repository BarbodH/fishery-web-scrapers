35436,Abberz,2007-02-16 19:50:00,140,Smoke and his #20 Home Depot Chevy will be in victory lane on sunday.
35510,Tybo,2007-02-16 22:40:00,1373,"NO WAY MAN!!! MARK MARTIN IN A CHEVY.  If he can drive that CHEVY half as good as the ford(Got to go wash my mouth out now). They will be crashing in to him,to try and slow him down."
35517,danc,2007-02-16 22:51:00,4677," Look for Bowyer to make the chase this year. I'm not sure that he can pull off the win this weekend, but I'm predicting a banner year for him. Casey Mears too."
35524,Daplumma,2007-02-16 23:02:00,1961,"I would like to see smoke do it.I have a bad feeling it will be Kurt bush,I cant stand the guy though. Joe"
35536,glirw,2007-02-16 23:38:00,200,whoever drives an imported car.
35553,fishindevil,2007-02-17 00:34:00,6254,ill go with #8 jr...or kevin harvick....like it was said in a post already with restrictor plate racing anyone can win....so i say good luck to everyone cheers
35557,Canuck2fan,2007-02-17 00:51:00,1444,The 99 all the way. Actually he doesn't have a prayer but since Rusty retired I have cheered for Edwards so I have to pick him now.....  Thinking about watching Rusty lose all those 500's I might as well go fishing my driver usually has the worst luck at Daytona. LOL
35563,Will,2007-02-17 01:15:00,4,wouldn't be surprised if Jimmie Johnson took the checkered but it'd be great to see Rudd pull off a come-back win.
35620,walleye_whitey,2007-02-17 05:33:00,8,"Surprised to see #48 only mentioned once. Even though he is starting middle of the pack, he should be up front in no time as long as he doesn't get caught up in any trouble.  Although I am picking Johnson in my pool, I would like to see Hamlin start off his sophmore season with a bang."
36136,MuskyBill,2007-02-19 00:20:00,311,"Hahaha, told ya...Way to go, Happy..."
36219,crusty,2007-02-19 02:14:00,83,Hey Muskybill I believe this is in order  
35248,MuskyBill,2007-02-16 06:27:00,311,"I'm gonna hope Kevin Harvick pulls it off, but I'm not liking his new car colours.  Where's all the black??  Who's your pick?"
35263,misfish,2007-02-16 11:02:00,29133,
35269,Gerry,2007-02-16 11:49:00,257,My pick is Tony Stewart.
35272,xrap,2007-02-16 12:03:00,683,Jeff Gordon
35273,danbo,2007-02-16 12:12:00,2646,#24
35274,Whopper,2007-02-16 12:13:00,2174,"I'd like to see Jr win it, if he can't then Smoke."
35275,danc,2007-02-16 12:13:00,4677,I'll go with Kyle Busch. The kid can drive.
35279,misfish,2007-02-16 12:38:00,29133," Yes DanC I have to agree with that one,and he is a much nicer guy then his brother.He shows respect."
35282,bpsbassman,2007-02-16 12:47:00,941,You know I gotta be pulling for Martin Truex Does he have a chance?
35285,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-02-16 13:00:00,0,Stewart has something to prove this year. Watch for him to smoke 'em in 07. He'll start right here at Daytona. He'll win the championship over Gordon and Earnhart will finish third.
35289,muskieb,2007-02-16 13:02:00,58,"Right on MuskyBill!  I hope Harvick can pull it off too, he is normally just a little short on the super speedways, he is due.  And the colors, couldn't agree more, yellow is is just not the same as the black!  Any bets on where he finishes at the end of the season?"
35292,fishdawg,2007-02-16 13:06:00,912," agreed!!!  All of my horses have had there turn to win in the last 3 (8, 24, 48) if none of them take the flag, I just hope its another Chev!  hmmm.. why not Clint Boywer?"
35295,JFR,2007-02-16 13:09:00,498,"Junior all the way, if he can keep his focus and not let his fight with Theresa cloud him out,  or maybe Tony Stewart, but anyone but Gordon"
35303,Deano,2007-02-16 13:22:00,767,"In the duels, Junior get's in front, gets spun out by waltrip, ends up a lap down and come back to finish 2nd, all in 60 laps. He's a true champion. I vote for junior, johnson is my second favorite, but with the new rule changes, I think Kasey Kayne will win the season."
35319,Raf,2007-02-16 13:47:00,3495,Ron Fellows!
35335,crusty,2007-02-16 14:06:00,83,"#20 home de pot Tony has been working out If he was as tiny as the rest of them, he would have cleaned up last year"
35338,Bernie,2007-02-16 14:14:00,3190,"As much as I dont like the guy,Tony Stewart can really drive. Its hard to pick a winner in Nascar because of all the possibilties. DanC may have a good pick as well. Curious about Casey Mears too."
35387,walleyejigger,2007-02-16 16:21:00,876,JR. then Busch
35393,spanky,2007-02-16 16:50:00,195,i'm gonna say Denny Hamlin
35396,moosehead,2007-02-16 16:59:00,90,I like the #31 car Jeff Burton
35398,lilkynan,2007-02-16 17:03:00,173,Anyone but Stewart!!!! - Whiny always cried about bumping in the corners for the past couple years in Daytona - so what does he do - bump in the corner last week.  Dale - Go and clean his clock - stright into the WALL!!!!
35413,misfish,2007-02-16 18:06:00,29133,"BARE.Dont forget about Gorden,he was always whining about dale pushing in the corners.LOL  Best place to make a pass.LOL"
35415,Gerry,2007-02-16 18:33:00,257,"I agree Misfish. When it comes to whiners, Gordon is the king! I just can't warm up to that guy. Actually, with restrictor plate racing anyone can win. It's largley a matter of luck, being at the right place at the right time, having a good pit crew, and making the right decisons about pitting and tires. I sure miss #3."
35416,misfish,2007-02-16 18:43:00,29133,I know Musky Bill does aswell.He has a large collection of the man in black.  Racing just has not been the same.
35432,ecmilley,2007-02-16 19:41:00,2163,as long as #24's dress doesn't blow up over his eyes he'll do ok but would much rather see junior or harvick with the checkerd flag
