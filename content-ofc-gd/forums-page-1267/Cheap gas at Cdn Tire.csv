If you're in the area go for it, the lines move quickly it seems.  Last night gas was 90.9cents, they have it on sale for 74.0cents  Maureen"
36317,liam,2007-02-19 12:11:00,1,Nice price!
36329,ccmtcanada,2007-02-19 12:44:00,7971,Yeh...I work for Canadian Tire head office...every Monday this month we've chosen one station in the GTA and take 20 cents off per liter.  It's pretty good publicity for us...

36434,ccmtcanada,2007-02-19 17:21:00,7971," LOL...if I knew where it was going to be, I couldn't tell you anyways.  Thankfully I dont know the location....LOL.  I think we are doing this every Monday in the month of Feb...not 100% sure though."
36483,walleyejigger,2007-02-19 19:38:00,876,u don't see those to words together very often....... cheap...&......gas
36503,motv8tr,2007-02-19 21:05:00,2587, According to Breakfast Television it is every Monday if Feb.  I'm pretty sure they did it the same time last year...too bd they don't include diesel in that  Maureen
36526,tonyb,2007-02-19 21:44:00,1637,Wouldn't it be nice if they stopped fluctuating gas prices during the day so you wouldn't have to wait until the middle of the night to buy gas.  95 cents all day until late night then the price drops?!  I assume this is so that they can say their 'average' price wasn't 95 cents but 80 cents over the day.  Whatever  Tony
36668,kemper,2007-02-20 02:30:00,2232,Put gas in my dads car the other day. Boy was that fun at almost a buck a litre.    I sure do like the 4.6L Northstar V8 though
