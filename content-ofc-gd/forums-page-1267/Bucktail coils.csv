They look like they would make things much easier, or are they not really that big a deal?  I have found them at Stamina, but that is the only place so far.  I have found lately that the duties on shipments from south of the border have been really high, so much so I am going to try harder to buy locally, only trouble is I can't seem to find the same quality or selection."
36485,JFR,2007-02-19 19:54:00,498,"I'm not sure what you mean.  A couple of years ago, I attended a lure making seminar put on by a couple of board members, Musky_Man, 2Rs and Outtolunge, 2Rs makes bucktails and was using clutch cable. Covering a piece with thread, then adding his bucktail.  When finished would slide it onto the piece onto the wire shaft.  Perhaps an auto supply shop may be your best source.  Good hunting,  John"
36486,muskieb,2007-02-19 20:00:00,58,"Someone else has since suggested the same thing to me, never thought of that on my own.  What I was refering to is essentially the same thing, a piece of throttle cable with a piece of lead on the one end for weighting the lure.  I am going to try a couple auto shops and see what I can find, should hopefully be cheaper, and I will figure something else out for weighting them.  Thankyou."
36491,GbayGiant,2007-02-19 20:20:00,1780,"It is cheaper and I know what you mean about Canada not having a selection like the US. Lawnmower pull cords come in like 5-6', you'll have to look around locally to find them and melt your own lead onto them or just use separate lead pieces same thing, if not US is the only place."
