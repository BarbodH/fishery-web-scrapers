36206,Garyv,2007-02-19 01:59:00,547,Well next weekend is the London show.  For some reason I feel it has got better the past few years after a real decline in the early 2000's.  If your there on Sunday the 25th stop by the Bluewater Anglers salmon derby booth between 10AM and 1PM and say hello.  I'll be selling tickets with my friend Paul.
36251,eyefish,2007-02-19 03:07:00,135,I'll be there for the entire show at the tightlines booth...stop by and say HI.
36255,taper,2007-02-19 03:10:00,611,"Gary I will be there but not sure when yet, considering I couldn't make the TO show I don't want to miss this one."
36305,SlowPoke,2007-02-19 09:29:00,2984,"I'll be going, maybe twice. Not sure when but If I am there Sunday I will drop in Gary. Eyefish, I'll see you there at some point I'm sure.  Does anybody know if I will be able to find a Helly Delta suit at the show? My local shop has size 2X but it's too short and probably not enough room for layering. I'm having trouble finding a 3X to try on.  -Brian"
