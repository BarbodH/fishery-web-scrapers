725604,Cudz,2012-08-28 02:29:00,2652,I went fishing on a lake in southern Ontario and caught a walleye at night on a topwater lure in 3 ft of water. I also caught a nightime smallie and a couple largies. The next morning we decided to go Musky fishing and my buddy Jaydub caught a very very large LMB a new PB for him.  This largemouth had no problem taking on this musky bait.

725681,Garfisher,2012-08-28 16:04:00,229,Must be annoying getting big bass while chasing those muskies rofl. Very nice largie.
725686,Cookslav,2012-08-28 16:16:00,1457,"I had the same thing happen last year. I was using a Top water plastic weedless frog, working the edge of some pads and slop for largmemouth at dusk and picked up a nice pickerel. That was a first and...so far the last Pickerel I've caught on a surface bait? I've caught many a pickerel on Stick baits and floating raps, but they still run a few feet down, but hey....I guess Pickerel like frogs to"
