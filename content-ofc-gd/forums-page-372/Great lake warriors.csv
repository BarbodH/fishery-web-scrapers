725735,davey buoy,2012-08-28 20:28:00,5505, Watching it right now!
725804,pike slayer,2012-08-29 01:42:00,1177,i watched it and it wasnt as good as i thought it'd be. and i was also hoping there would be sault stuff but no southern michigan and thunderbay. i'll keep watching it might get better.
726022,hawk-eye,2012-08-30 00:13:00,141,"I agree, not as good as I expected. I was hoping the show was going to have a little more then just tugs and barges in Michigan. Would be nice to see some footage from the canal pilots or fishing tugs in Erie, even some of the construction project out in the lakes. See how it goes, for now Im still watching."
