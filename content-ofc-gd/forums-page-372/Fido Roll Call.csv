He even knows how to vocalize ""hello"" in his doggy accent. He is currently number 2 and was at number 1 a couple of days ago, Token needs your vote if you have the time.  I recall seeing Maureen's dog up there as well and have also clicked him as well as all dogs can get a vote each day.  http://fidocastingcall.ca/dog/1656720496/  Thanks, Stanley"
