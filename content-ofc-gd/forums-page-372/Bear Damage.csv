I was up at my uncles cottage on the french river a couple weeks ago for a family vacation weekend. I head up there every year in sept for a week trip for some hard fishing, but this trip was more cottaging oriented then fishing. I did manage to talk my father and my uncle into heading back to a lake that my uncles family has a camp on. It has some decent bass and pike fishing so i was excited to get back there. It was a cold day with the fishing a little slow so we decided to head in to the camp to get out of the wind and rain. As we got out of the boat I noticed the screen was ripped to the front porch. As we unlocked the door and went inside this is what happened.                Those pesky bears. It looked like someone had left pop bottles and some dog treats in a garbage bag on the screened in porch. I figure thats what got his attention. We actually went back the next day as well to look at the damage again and there was bear scat where it wasnt yesterday. The bugger had been back again to see if he had missed anything."
725574,GbayGiant,2012-08-28 00:54:00,1780,He or she will keep coming back. Best thing to do is stay there soon and make it realize that food stop is taken.  
725575,mercman,2012-08-28 00:56:00,7054,"Dang !!!!! What a bloody mess He will be back for a while, now he knows there has been a free meal there."
725578,Handlebarz,2012-08-28 01:00:00,3790,Yep sounds like you need to take three weeks off work to go fishing I mean bear duty
725588,NAW,2012-08-28 01:22:00,4022,Wow.  That sucks.  Had to spend some time cleaning up instead of fishing  Is that the first time something like this has happened at the camp?  Might have to board the place up when you not there
725593,archer379,2012-08-28 01:37:00,277,Dam a bear must be breaking into my kids room doesn't look much different lol
725599,HTHM,2012-08-28 02:04:00,4082,A reverse Goldilocks...a 12 gauge & a bear tag will put an end to that.
725606,simonl,2012-08-28 02:35:00,28,"We had a bear get into the screened porch at our camp one year to get into the bbq. Of course the bbq has since been removed and zero scraps are left behind, but every year we know we have to replace screens because he kept on coming back regardless. This year I had enough, and enclosed the porch and put solid windows in figuring this will stop the unwanted entries......was just in a couple weeks ago to check on things and find that the bugger has now resorted to pulling the exterior siding boards off in an attempt to get in! Once they get a taste of something they are pretty persistant! I saw a neat idea at a camp in Quebec that I may try, and you might want to as well....these hunters put bear boards down under every windo and door. All they were was a peice of plywood with a bunch of nails and screws driven thru then laid down with the pointy ends up.....the bear won't put their weight on it and therefore can't get near the window or door to gain access."
725634,Toad Hunter,2012-08-28 11:40:00,261,"Wow, just lucky the thing was out before you got back"
725643,Headhunter,2012-08-28 12:44:00,5703,Looks like Sunday morning at Bernie's! I like the nail idea above! HH
725663,BassMan11,2012-08-28 14:04:00,583,This is the second time in 25 years a bear has broke in. First time one has actually got into the cabin. The camp hasn't been used much this year so it has been quiet up there. Also there was moose droppings on a near by trail as well. I will find out what has been done about it when I head back up there in 2 weeks
725665,Toad Hunter,2012-08-28 14:08:00,261,"I don't think quiet would be the right word, looks like they had quite a party lol"
725728,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-28 19:26:00,10439,If you think that's bad you certainly don't want to see what a Grizz or Wolverine will do to a cabin!!!  Or an expensive SUV  for that matter!!!!!
725732,fishnsled,2012-08-28 20:01:00,3520, Pretty much! lol!   I have no experience with this but it sounds like you have your work cut out for you. Maybe we all do a week at your camp of fishing (I mean bear) duty to help you out.
725775,danc,2012-08-28 23:27:00,4677,I haven't seen damage from a bear breaking into a cabin for almost two weeks now. I should get out more often I guess.
725782,OhioFisherman,2012-08-29 00:07:00,6623," My buddy`s son and a friend own and run the Lunge Lodge on the French, they have had some issues too. I have no idea what the weather has been like up there, it had been a hot dry summer here. Bears are probably having more issues finding food if it is the same there."
725798,BassMan11,2012-08-29 01:30:00,583," Believe me, we made lots of noise as we went in. Just in case it was taking a nap on one of the beds."
