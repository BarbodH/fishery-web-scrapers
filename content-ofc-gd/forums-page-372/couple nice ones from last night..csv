Managed 3 over 25"" and a couple keepers. My buddy cliff could not get a fish to bite...preetty frustrating for him....almost felt bad....almost...lol....i had to watch him the other day on another lake, so things balanced out!        <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/-XdpW2j4wVo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                              "
