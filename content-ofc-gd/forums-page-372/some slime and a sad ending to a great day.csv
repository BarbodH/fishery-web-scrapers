725189,Handlebarz,2012-08-26 13:32:00,3790,The wife and I made it out Saturday for a couple hours casting for some more LSC musky action it was a great day light chop perfect conditions but just like last Saturday they were few and far between. We hit the lake around 6:20 and were fishing by 6:45 we did not move a fish until 9:40 which was right at the major for the morning. I will let the video tell the story non the less it was another great short day on the water with my wife we were done fishing by 10:15
