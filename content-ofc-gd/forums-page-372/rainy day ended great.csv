725788,mike rousseau,2012-08-29 00:30:00,4661,well my shift got cancelled last nigh... so after a phone call to the wife i started getting ready to go fishing... after a few phone calls it was clear that it was gunna be a solo mission... and that was fine with me... some time to relax and explore a little... slow down and just have some fun...  as soon as i got to the launch.... drip... drip... drip... got on my rain suit then it started to rain pretty good for a few hours...then it cleared right up and the wind settled down....    so i cruise out to my first spot... drop my crank back 100 feet... engage the reel and bang... hit almost immediately... dont even think it made it to depth yet...    nice 3 pound walleye... i decide to complete the pass instead of going over where i got that one... ended up getting another on in the same pass... great...  next spot i got 2 more... then about every second spot i caught fish...  finished the day with 10 walleye... biggest was 25-26 inches...  even kept a few for supper tomorrow...
