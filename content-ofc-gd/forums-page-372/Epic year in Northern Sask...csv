725400,iceslayer,2012-08-27 14:02:00,97,"Spent the season on Wollaston lake in Northern Sask and it was everything I've dreamed it to be.... Topped out at 46.5""s which matches my PB from Northern Ont but I believe my 50""r is reserved for next season.. Fished a fly-out lake with 2 boats (4 fisherman) and boated 39 pike all  between 38""-44""....  Many more in the mid thirties!!!  Blew my freakin mind!!!  Hope you guys enjoy the pics..  Just rented a place on Cooch for the fall and winter..  Anyone wanna get out gator hunt'n just say the word..  Cheers!! Jim          "

725403,NAW,2012-08-27 14:18:00,4022,"Man, those are some monsters!  Great pics man  Hope to see some pike reports from Cooch.  You gunna fish for them thru the ice this winter?"
725405,woodenboater,2012-08-27 14:23:00,2277,Last pic.. OWWW !!!!!
725406,SlowPoke,2012-08-27 14:25:00,2984,"What hurt more, the arms or the hook injury? Some monsters on that trip!"
725407,backbay,2012-08-27 14:27:00,773,"So, please tell us about the hook! Great fish, btw...."
725410,iceslayer,2012-08-27 14:41:00,97,"Haha!! Thats my PB!!!  Landing a 32""r, I grabbed him behind the head. The main hook was in his mouth and the second (stinger) hook was free.....  He decided to thrash and threw the second hook staight into my hand....  Lol.. Should have seen the look on my guest's faces!! Priceless!!  Got the fish off and grabed the hook and tried shoving it all the way through and it wouldnt budge at all.. Unfortunetely this wasnt in Sask, with barbless hooks it was at the end of my season in Northern Ont at Sabourin Lake Lodge...  HUGE Barb!!!  Back to the lodge, little help getting it through and chopped and out, then right back on the water..  Couldnt shake hands for a couple days though.."
725412,iceslayer,2012-08-27 14:43:00,97,Arms hurt way more!!!!  So worth it...lol..
725413,iceslayer,2012-08-27 14:45:00,97,Thats my plan..  And every fishable lake around it.. Not tooo familiar with the area though so it's gonna take some time..  Jim
725416,NAW,2012-08-27 14:52:00,4022,"I live in the area, and ice fish every weekend.  PM we when the lakes harden up, I can show you a few spots."
