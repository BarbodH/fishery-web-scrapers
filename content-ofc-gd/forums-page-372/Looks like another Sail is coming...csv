725510,okumasheffield,2012-08-27 20:49:00,318,"WOW, they are really aggressive!"
725513,Roy,2012-08-27 20:56:00,13728,Cabelas will be buying up a few of their locations when it's time to pay the piper. Let's just wait and see.
725514,misfish,2012-08-27 21:03:00,29133,  Thats why Sails wont be in Barrie.Cabelas will build from the ground up.
725515,davey buoy,2012-08-27 21:03:00,5505,Do you think all these big box stores are going to survive.?Seems like a whole lot in a short time.
725516,kickingfrog,2012-08-27 21:04:00,8333,"For all the consuming I, do I know almost nothing about retailing."
725517,woodenboater,2012-08-27 21:15:00,2277,"I think they're hoping to snag the ""Buy from a Canadian company"" shopper for some part. I was impressed with the tent selection on the floor and they had Esquif canoes (no surprise since it's a Quebec company that makes very good canoes). My guess is that they're also looking to steal a few customers from MEC and I think they will get some who don't feel comfortable with or like the co-op concept.  I'll be happy not to have to schlepp to Vaughan or Oshawa"
725540,bucktail,2012-08-27 22:37:00,1857,"Really bummed that they have no archery section, a few crossbows and thats it, for a souther ontario store I think there really not in touch with the hunting crowd."
725541,misfish,2012-08-27 22:44:00,29133, The Vaughan store has a good selection. I will stick with the wolfs den here.I can stop in after a day on the river.
