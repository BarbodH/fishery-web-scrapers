We leave Sat Am for our week at Brennan Harbour - many thanks to all of those who have replied or send me PMS for tips - greatly appreciated! Weather man good right now - although a small cold front is blowing in mid week - but wind looks down which is the main concern - we will fish no matter what - even if we are just piking in the bay where the lodge is Will do my best to post a good report when back - taking my new camera and will also try for a few videos Any last minute tips - spots. areas to fish when weather is rough - fire away Cheers Gordy"
