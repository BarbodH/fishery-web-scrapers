It works but isn't the quality you'd find at a store so I'll probably find one a t a store instead of this one.       Next, Just a tiny report, got out on the river today and nailed 10 smallies, none of much size, most about this guys size..       And finally, found this little guy in my backyard pond and havn't seen anything in there like this before.. Nor do I know what kinda fish this guy is! he's about 4 inches or so. Does anyone know what kind of fish this is growing up to be/ or is?            Thanks, Caleb"
