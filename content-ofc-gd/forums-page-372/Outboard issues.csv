724398,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-22 19:31:00,1107, I am going to try that and replace the plugs hope that's the end of it
724589,fishboy,2012-08-23 17:24:00,550,Had the same problem once-hairline crack in the insulator of one of the plugs.
724650,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 00:16:00,5865,Looking forward to the answer.....................
725289,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-26 21:38:00,1107,"Thanks for the info guys I went and bought a sparkplug tester and my top plug is bad (Thanks Tybo) hope that will be the end of my issues the coils are all firing so it must be that plug (found out the coils work the hard way DON""T touch a inline spark tester while the engine is running LOL)"
725301,ttahhan,2012-08-26 23:36:00,191," Hello start by replacing the spark plugs one of them might have a hair line crack, Fuel problem being a year in a half old highly unlikley however the fuel filter could be clogged and the worst case scenerio which again i doubt cause of age of motor, the lower end clutch packs could be burned out, caused by water entering through a worn out seal at the [propeller shaft....to check this open up drain plug and ensure the oil is not milky white....hope that helps"
725307,SlowPoke,2012-08-27 00:03:00,2984,"Ohhhh, did we forget to warn you about that? That'll straighten your hair!"
725308,davey buoy,2012-08-27 00:09:00,5505, That was the the easiest and cheapest way to start. Congrats on a fairly easy fix!Except for the shock treatment:w00t:
725333,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-27 01:23:00,1107,  Meh it was like getting nailed by a BBQ lighter but really fast LOL but it did elimanate the posibility of coil probs I checked the one that didn't light up the tester  on purpose to make sure the coil was firing
725371,Billy Bob,2012-08-27 09:43:00,5865," Actually ""maybe"" not....hopefully it's the plug and probably is, but the coil could be failing under load and not at idle."
725543,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-27 22:48:00,1107, Shhhhooooosh LOL I moved the plug to another cylinder and it failed there to
724202,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-21 17:47:00,1107,"I fished a tourney on st clair sunday and on the way out we were running 40mph and the motor bogged and we went down to 25mph but it sounded normal just no power , when we slow down you can feel the 3rd cylynder kick back on and start powering the boat it works fine at idle but as soon a you throttle it it boggs down I think it's a coil/plug or a carb/fuel prob . I am just looking for advice before I take it in hope this is the end of my engine issues it's only a year and a half old"
724204,ecmilley,2012-08-21 17:57:00,2163,change your plugs then go from there
724206,Spiel,2012-08-21 18:50:00,9065,"I had a bad coil giving me similar issues once, good place to start."
724208,misfish,2012-08-21 19:11:00,29133, WARRANTY?
724210,davey buoy,2012-08-21 19:38:00,5505,"I'd start with the plug,swap coils if easy enough,than you'll know if you have a greater problem. 2 stroke ,right?."
724213,Lunker Larry,2012-08-21 19:45:00,122,"If it is still under warranty, don't go fiddling around with it. There may be a known problem with an immediate fix. Playing around with it yourself may violate your warranty or take an easy warranty fix and turn it into a real headache. About the only thing you can do without violating your warranty is the plugs. Easy enough to narrow down the cylinder if you want to but don't go changing coils or the like.  Good luck. Motor issues really bum me out."
724215,danbouck,2012-08-21 19:48:00,4380,Warranty is up
724216,misfish,2012-08-21 19:49:00,29133, One and a half year later???????????
724219,davey buoy,2012-08-21 19:51:00,5505," Larry,we don't know when he bought it exactly?, I'd still do a quick coil change if necessary, the problem cyl will be wet. Quick coil swap,no ONE will know the diff except for us .lol."
724223,Dan668,2012-08-21 19:59:00,1120,Wasnt your rig new from last year? Shouldve gotten 5 years on the merc
724224,mercman,2012-08-21 20:07:00,7054,MERC IS 5 YEARS FROM 2010 ON. Check your bill of sale.
724230,davey buoy,2012-08-21 20:12:00,5505," As Victor says ""Well l'll be damned"".. On at 4:30. lol. I know you watch it!!!!!!!!!!!."
724236,SlowPoke,2012-08-21 20:28:00,2984,Probably a camp motor.
724251,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-21 21:09:00,1107,"No it was a brand new 2 stroke warranty is only 1 year factory and the offer up to 5 years extended for $2800 which I couldn't justify paying 50% of the retail cost of the motor on extended warranty .Thanks for the imput guys the bottom cylinder is ""wet"" and I am going to replace the plugs and the coil on the bottom cylinder and hope that's the end of it I have suspected the coils were messing up as it occationally would hesitate while accelerating wish me luck"
724252,davey buoy,2012-08-21 21:14:00,5505, Also take a close look at the plug wire to the coil. Could be cut or damaged somehow.
724253,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-21 21:17:00,1107, I did inspect the wire but I suspect it is the coil itself from the kicking back in at low rpm's my buddy is a small engine mech and fixes seadoo's regularily I just cant seem to get ahold of him LOL Thanks for the idea's
724255,davey buoy,2012-08-21 21:22:00,5505," I'm with you on the coil,you can't easily swap them to see if a different plug fouls?.At least you'll know more when you talk to him. Just thinking about it a spare coil if that's not the problem ,still not a bad idea."
724257,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-21 21:39:00,1107,yes I can do that I unfortunately am on vacay and that doesn't fit into the plans for the week LOL have to wait till labour day weekend to trouble shoot it because it runs normal on the muffs in the drive way ?
724262,SlowPoke,2012-08-21 22:06:00,2984,$2800!!!! I don't blame you for passing on that; you can buy a lot of coils for that kinda bread! I guess I'm pretty fortunate getting 6yrs at no additional cost. Good luck with the repair.
724267,Tybo,2012-08-21 22:51:00,1373,Bottom plug should be wet.It`s wet from the other cyls draining down.A fouled plug should have heavy carbon build up. Get a spark tester it will make things easier.
724270,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-21 23:15:00,1107,That makes sense and yes it had alot of junk on it when I looked at them they are (plugs) NGK without the bent peice for the spark to jump to (not sure what it's called ) but  the the white insulation on the plug has black marks across it . the thing that is bugging me is it works good at idle and just above but bogs when you hit the throttle.
724272,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-21 23:39:00,10439, I had the same issue with my '91 2 stroke this spring. Problem was a bad plug. Been fine since it was replaced. Change it first and if the problem is still there change the coil.
724275,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-21 23:50:00,1107, Thanks that's re-assuring to hear someone had the same problem I will let ya's know how it works out
724305,Handlebarz,2012-08-22 02:36:00,3790,IO had the same thing on my 94 mariner changed the plugs and life was GREAT
724328,mike rousseau,2012-08-22 11:15:00,4661,I had that same problem... With my last motor...  High speed jet was plugged in my carb.... Seafoam cleaned it out... Heavy heavy dose of seafoam...
