726208,NAC,2012-08-30 20:10:00,369,Call Ken at Kashaga Lodge.  It isn't pretty but its pretty cheap and has all you need.
726215,cityfisher,2012-08-30 20:40:00,959,id also recommend kenesis lake lodge... also not pretty(lake and dock area is ) .. but the price is right
726217,ctered,2012-08-30 20:56:00,40,A friend rennted a place on Oak lake north of Havelock. The lake is only about 1.5 miles square and they found fish easily. Sorry I do not know the name of the cottages he rented from but you could google the lake and see what shows up.
726233,adempsey,2012-08-30 22:12:00,1498,  Probably Leisure Cottages.  I considered going there for an ice fishing trip last winter.
726235,Rod Caster,2012-08-30 22:26:00,5784,Beautiful lake and super nice owners!!
726287,Rich,2012-08-31 02:01:00,3927,"Thanks everyone kindly for your information. I believe my girlfriend likes the oak lake idea, so that will likely be where we go. Thanks again, much appreciated!"
