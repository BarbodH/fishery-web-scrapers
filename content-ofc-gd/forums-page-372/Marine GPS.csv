725271,Steve2012,2012-08-26 20:13:00,15,Hi guys  Any suggestions on a good marine GPS? Just looking for something effective at a reasonable cost.  Thx
725290,mike rousseau,2012-08-26 21:39:00,4661,Just gps? Or gps sonar combo?  What's your budget?
725305,Dabluz,2012-08-26 23:58:00,701,  No such thing as a marine GPS.  All GPS's do the same thing.  The only difference is in the mapping software.  You either get topographical maps or marine maps.
725309,SlowPoke,2012-08-27 00:16:00,2984," That's not quite the case. Some are directed towards pilots, geo-cachers, marine, automotive. Marine units tend to float and are water resistant.  Garmin is probably your best bet for map detail but you'll have to purchase the map software separately. Your budget will dictate what unit you purchase. Lot's of choice."

725605,ctered,2012-08-28 02:31:00,40,"Take a look at a Garmin 60c or 76c. they should fall in your budget. As for the mapping, it is another expense but can be obtained from other sources if you understand what I mean."

(these are from Radioworld) Cheapest buy is the Garmin 78 for $220 and the charts are $160 but it is a handheld unit, not sure if that is what you were looking for . I've picked out a couple of other less expensive options but will put you over your budget. Seems like everything is going in the combo direction of Chartplotters and Sounders. That's really too bad as I like having the separated units.  Lowrance Monochrome screen Edit - This is a bit cheaper then the Garmin 78 but no colour screen  Lowrance  Humminbird  Handheld Garmin 78  Handheld Garmin 78s  Garmin Charts  Navionics"
