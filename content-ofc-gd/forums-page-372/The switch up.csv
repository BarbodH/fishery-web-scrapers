725953,Luke V.,2012-08-29 20:14:00,286,"Headed out this morning at 6. Launch at 7 on the Upper Niagara river. Fished for 3 hours with out catching anything. Seemed like everything was on lock jaw. Decided to pack it in and head to the lower river. Was a really good decision. Launched at Queenston at 11am off by 2:30. Boated 10-12 smallies. Most around the 14"" mark. Great time on the water  Ill let the pics do the talking          Thanks for looking"

725959,Luke V.,2012-08-29 20:31:00,286,"Chris, Thing is the bar has been dead lately, Living 10 mins from Queenston is the cats meow!  All the smallies are in the river!"

726085,Luke V.,2012-08-30 12:18:00,286,"Hey mark! Long time not seeing you!  Yesterday the north wind had the bar rolling nicely. In sure they were active on the bar, however our 14' tinner isn't up for that"
