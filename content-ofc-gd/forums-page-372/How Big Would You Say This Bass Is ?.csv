726038,ttahhan,2012-08-30 01:16:00,191,"Hi Forum, i came across this on You Tube and wanted to share with y'all. The gentleman gets a topwater strike out of his kayak big bass. Wondering out of curiosity how much would you all think this would weigh in at ? "
726039,ProFishermanJones,2012-08-30 01:21:00,77,i would say 10lbs + typical florida strain bass. they get hawgs over that way
726040,Cudz,2012-08-30 01:25:00,2652,That fish would weigh alot.  9+ maybe more.  that is a viscious hit.  wow.
726043,largemouthtrout,2012-08-30 01:36:00,53,"I,de love to catch a bass like that .. those frog lures of his look awsome ."
726048,cram,2012-08-30 02:19:00,1733,4-6 lbs.
726051,GreenCanada,2012-08-30 02:31:00,375,"IMO it looks closer to 7, maybe 8 lb max.  Everyone will have their guess but no one is correct unless we see a scale.  "

726089,Terry,2012-08-30 12:22:00,14456,too much of an ad for some product for me to bother watching
726092,kemper,2012-08-30 12:49:00,2232,  So I wasn't the only one that noticed....
726095,woodenboater,2012-08-30 13:16:00,2277,"I'd like to try one of the lures out but the price is insane, and I thought LiveTarget frogs were pricey  They look great and are handmade but I'd be tossing those with VERY heavy leaders to avoid any breakoffs, esp with pike."
726102,cram,2012-08-30 13:41:00,1733,"Hey guys - on a scale of 1-10, how pretty is this girl?  "
726103,Roy,2012-08-30 13:48:00,13728," Before or after the beer?  And yeah, it's another of those questions."

726258,ttahhan,2012-08-31 00:20:00,191," Hi there just want to let you know its not the frog im trying to show off but more the topwater strike....as for frogs i personally use 30 lb Power Pro with, the Live Target Frog in Black with Chartreuse, works great for pike and bass in Frenchman's Bay (Pickering Ont)"
