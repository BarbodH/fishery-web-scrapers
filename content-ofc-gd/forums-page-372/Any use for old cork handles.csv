725649,Rod Caster,2012-08-28 13:03:00,5784,"I keep hearing about a ""cork shortage"", and it seems to be reflected in the reduction of full-cork rod handles on the market. Does anyone on the board have use for old cork handles from broken/used fishing rods?? This goes for for any rod/reel parts actually. I'd gladly save a few of these and ship them out.   I'm not sure if cork can be refurbished or recycled, but I'd rather save someone $ and reuse something that is potentially useful than just keep throwing things out."
725651,Spiel,2012-08-28 13:07:00,9065,Very generous of you RC. I have dozens of them here I've collected over the years. Reels seats may be salvageable if they are of decent quality but the cork sadly is pretty much scrap.
725652,kemper,2012-08-28 13:09:00,2232,I keep collecting old ones too - but I have yet to actually find a use for one...
725653,Lip-ripper,2012-08-28 13:16:00,228,Add a flyswatter to the end!  
725655,Rod Caster,2012-08-28 13:25:00,5784, This is from a Fenwick Highlander. Any worth to you?    
725658,Spiel,2012-08-28 13:41:00,9065," Sadly, no.  "
725659,Rod Caster,2012-08-28 13:42:00,5784," No prob, I'll take Trouty's idea then. The wife will get a laugh out of that."
725662,reelinrolly,2012-08-28 14:03:00,281,We have used them to make ice fishing rods in the past
725669,kickingfrog,2012-08-28 15:16:00,8333,That grip is so last year. Everyone who is anyone is using split grips.
725683,Harrison,2012-08-28 16:13:00,2202,Tomatoe Stakes!  I like the fly swatter idea! Are there any other creative ideas for butt sections?
725696,Spiel,2012-08-28 16:34:00,9065,"Cut the rod off just in front of the fore grip of several old rods, glue them into a decorative wood plaque, spaced far enough apart to display old reels. Hang it up in your man cave.  Old butt sections can also be used as a curtain rod in the man cave, guides removed of course."
725698,Jigger,2012-08-28 16:38:00,1237,X2 to what Harrison said! Ive got teepees made of old rod ends.  Edit: seems that theres a growing interest in cork reel handles. Any way to convert the rodends Spiel?
725700,Spiel,2012-08-28 16:40:00,9065,"Oh ya, I also have couple I use in conjunction with a chumming can."
725960,Woodsman,2012-08-29 20:32:00,1286,For those into downrigging sliders can be wrapped around the cork & secured with thumb tacks.
