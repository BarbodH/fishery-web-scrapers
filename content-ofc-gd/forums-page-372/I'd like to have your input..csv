726137,Roy,2012-08-30 16:17:00,13728,Yup....found it and a couple of others thanks to a few observant members here.
726175,mistyriver1,2012-08-30 18:00:00,600,"Roy, I would vote for Lake St. Francis.   I'm a little biased cause that's the lake my Dad taught me to fish on and we caught a ton of nice fish.  I haven't fished there since the late 80's and would love to get back there soon."
726185,mercman,2012-08-30 18:54:00,7054,"  I will be up there for Musky tomorrow, MR !!! I will catch one for ya !!!"
726238,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-30 22:31:00,2038,"Scratch Lac Ste-Marie off the list, well for Bass anyways !!! The bite has been absolutely brutal of late.   "
726249,Lungelarry,2012-08-30 23:43:00,294,"Roy ,according to wind guru..........wsw 30km,gust to 65km. Not the best to be on Franny,you could try louis ,but still very tough with these winds. Really the most intelligent is to fish St. Larry. Sorry but wind trumps all............"
726282,Roy,2012-08-31 01:40:00,13728,"Thanks for your input Larry. The winds were called for today and tomorrow (Friday) but the weekend appears to be reasonable from most predictions. I'm going to play this one by ear I guess. Thanks again, Bud."
726330,John,2012-08-31 12:43:00,2956,Have fun Bud...
725975,Roy,2012-08-29 22:06:00,13728,"I have a shot at fishing a day or two away from the Larry this weekend. I was thinking the Ottawa River, maybe the Gatineau area Lac Ste Marie, Lac des 31 milles, the St Francis maybe? Any suggestions? I'm equipped for muskie, walleye, bass, pike, trout...anything really."
725976,Skipper D,2012-08-29 22:10:00,1970,"I think you should take me  , and it realy dose'nt matter , you pick the place ..............."
725977,mike rousseau,2012-08-29 22:11:00,4661,I have room Friday Roy... Your welcome to join me and Paul... Musky hunting...  Or any other day this weekend for some walleyes... Just you and me...
725980,Roy,2012-08-29 22:16:00,13728,"Thanks for the offer Mike. I'm working Friday.   And Skip, that's the point, I don't want to pick the place this time."
725981,mike rousseau,2012-08-29 22:20:00,4661,Well... Either way Francis is ON right now... Walleye are jumpin in the boat....
725982,speedtroll,2012-08-29 22:22:00,52,Go where they are the BIGGEST Roy. you can never go wrong with that!   
725985,Roy,2012-08-29 22:24:00,13728," Thank you Robbie, you're a real gem. Nice to see you online. Hope everything is good with you."
725986,Fish Farmer,2012-08-29 22:30:00,2234,"Love to fish those places you mention Roy, never been there, sound interesting, new water  , Son's getting married Sat. then going to see the Cat's beat the ARGOS Hope to see some Roy pictures holding fish"

725991,speedtroll,2012-08-29 22:46:00,52,Its all good my friend. Thanks for asking. I am always kickin around. Aren't we kinda over due to get together for an Old Mill?
725993,Jigger,2012-08-29 22:50:00,1237,Friends dont let friends drink Old Mill.  Id go with the one that would be most quiet as far as boat traffic goes. The weather looks spotless and that will bring them out in numbers.
725994,mercman,2012-08-29 22:52:00,7054," So am i, but that never stopped me from fishin'  Launch in Aylmer, Go straight accross the river to Shirleys Bay.Dad and i would haul walleye outta there all day. Just outside the bay.He caught a 48 inch musky off Haycock Island too."
725995,Skipper D,2012-08-29 22:54:00,1970,"Lac St Francis . Sanite Barbe side if you go aloan , Saint Zotique side if i meet you ...... lol  "

726000,misfish,2012-08-29 23:07:00,29133," If i lived that close to there,that would be my choice me brudder. Im surprised,you havent had an offer to fish there,or maybe you have.  If you were closer to I,we would walk the river,like brudders in arms,talk about what ever,and wet a line . A yet,your so far,yet I so near.  One day my friend.  Enjoy,what ever trail you take.  "
726003,aplumma,2012-08-29 23:21:00,6896,I can pick you up at the airport if you want to fish a little further South Roy. Free room and board with guide service too.   Art
726005,motv8tr,2012-08-29 23:23:00,2587,"My vote is for Lac Ste Marie, seems like good variety from what I can find...where ever you end up, have a great time!!!  Maureen"
726011,backbay,2012-08-29 23:32:00,773,"Fish at Hawkesbury, and say hi to everyone for me!"
