725796,hotsky,2012-08-29 01:23:00,400,"I've been to Cootes a number of times by Princess point early in the summer, all the fish I got were small lm and silver bass. Went there again for an hour yesterday and noticed water was much lower (by about 2 feet)... I've often seen people on kayaks and canoes there and I was wondering if electric motors were allowed? Maybe I could take my inflatable with a TM. Or maybe even just the boat even if I have to paddle. What other fish is in there? I know they took the carp out some years ago. Is it worth it?"
725802,hammercarp,2012-08-29 01:40:00,964,There are still plenty of carp in Cootes. The carp trap is a failure at taxpayer expense. Why not fish the harbour? Lots of different species there.
725809,northernpike56,2012-08-29 01:54:00,717,Not too many fish in cootes asides from carp and mini bullheads. Maybe the odd white bass too. Thats all I've caught there anyways.Hamilton Harbor is better. Try bayfront for bass or go to the fisherman's pier for salmon soon.
725810,hotsky,2012-08-29 01:54:00,400,"I've tried Harbour a few times and no luck, I've learned a few things since and have more tackle so might be worth a try again sometime.  Btw any good places for carp fishing at the harbour? I've seen them jumping out on the water under that bridge by the coots."
725822,hotsky,2012-08-29 03:43:00,400,Haven't fished for salmon yet...I don't have any rods over 7' would that work?
725823,northernpike56,2012-08-29 03:58:00,717,I use my 6'6 M spooled with 10 lb braid on a 2500 size reel. Go for it!
725860,hammercarp,2012-08-29 13:35:00,964, Here's a few places to fish carp in the harbour. Pier 8 is your best bet right now. 
725901,hotsky,2012-08-29 16:41:00,400,"Hey thanks a lot! I've seen a lot of them at the Windermere basin or where it used to be, it's just the channel now, but they might've finished the work there by now. Saw some huge fish in that canal, it's very dirty tho; lots of tampon applicators floating around and last time I saw a couple of condoms too, kinda grossed me out lol."
726116,Rich,2012-08-30 14:34:00,3927,"I used to fish cootes as a kid. Never caught anything worthwhile , really.. An eel once in a while was about the main event. Big carp back then, far, far less carp there now since the carp traps were put in. I heard rumours of pike, but always caught them rather easily in the harbour."
726181,hotsky,2012-08-30 18:16:00,400,"I'd love to catch pike in the harbour, any good spots? bait or lures?"
726297,Rich,2012-08-31 02:48:00,3927,"Pier 4 to desjardins canal mouth, mepps #5 spinners"
726300,northernpike56,2012-08-31 03:04:00,717,I've seen a fatty caught at la salle in sept a few years ago. on a spinnerbait.
726308,hotsky,2012-08-31 04:33:00,400,"Awesome, I will try that for sure! thanks."
