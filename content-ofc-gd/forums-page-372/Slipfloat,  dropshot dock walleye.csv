725741,captpierre,2012-08-28 20:55:00,2521,"Going to spend a week at the cottage.  I have a weedbed about 10 ft out from my dock.  At 30 ft out, it stops and there is about 15-20ft deep water  I bought some glow in the dark slip floats and I was going to try some slammers or Gulp dropshotting just beyond the weedbed after dark from the dock.  Will this work?  Anybody try it?  peter"
725742,mike rousseau,2012-08-28 20:59:00,4661,I was actually planning on trying slip float walleye soon... But drifting an offering under the float...
725743,mike rousseau,2012-08-28 21:03:00,4661,Your biggest issue would be reeling a walleye through a weed bed I would think...
725746,Fang,2012-08-28 21:10:00,1330,"One of my go to techniques now up north. If I can see them on the graph on distinct structure and the bite is slow, out comes the slip bobber.  Rig a whole dew worm nose hooked on a 1/8 oz jig head and get it about a foot off the bottom. The biggest problem you might have is getting the bobber stop smoothly through the guides on a 7ft rod when casting. I run a 9 ft rod and change over to the dacron stops you get in the Lindy float packs. They travel through the guides a bit better than the rubber beads  Northland tackle makes a short shank bait jig head that is perfect for this presentation."

I have a thrill lighted bobber that I use, set the depth to 5 ft, and put on either a leech, minnow, or worm. I had the most luck on a big fat leech last time. I have some pics as proof of what it can do on my laptop but don't know how to post. I also had very good luck casting a floating original rapala. I got a 16"" and lost an even larger one in one night doing that as well as numerous 12-14""."

725875,Fang,2012-08-29 14:22:00,1330,"Yep that's what we do. I keep a whack of 8"" pieces of dacron in my box and some beads and tie up as needed"
726007,steel&chrome,2012-08-29 23:24:00,46,"I would give it a try, you never know! the benefit is that the slip float plus the heavier weight of the drop-shot will allow you to cast much farther, helping you to target the drop-off...goodluck!"
