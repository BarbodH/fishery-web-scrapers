726126,Musky or Specks,2012-08-30 15:25:00,2710,MMMM dodging waterskiers or Algae Bloom ??? Probably go flip the pads in Teeterville for some largies
726131,Rich,2012-08-30 15:45:00,3927," lol.. Teeterville like many of the ponds around here this year is almost dried up. Those pads are in 2"" of water. We took the boat in there 2 weeks ago and I was very sad to see the even the carp barely had room to swim.  I'm just looking for a place a little further from home to catch some bass and pike. Preferrably pike. I'm rather sick of LMB fishing."
726132,Musky or Specks,2012-08-30 15:47:00,2710,Actually been sick of bass fishing myself and was thinking the same. Might head up to Fishermans Cove or Purvis lake for some pike fishing.

726159,i2cool2fool,2012-08-30 17:12:00,349,Not Pittock. I was there two weeks ago. The water is very low and holy algae!  I recommend the inner bay at Long Point instead. That's where I am heading from here on out.
726285,Rich,2012-08-31 01:48:00,3927,"Hmm. Well. It was an idea. Lol  As for long point bay.. Thats pretty much been my home my whole life. Just looking for a change of scenery, relatively small water with some pike to catch. Or walleye, smallmouth.. Something interesting. Haha"
726288,i2cool2fool,2012-08-31 02:04:00,349,Good luck.  It's not really small but I'd like to try Lake St. Clair some time or Detroit River.  I am looking forward to Long Point being my new go to fishing area for the next while.
726302,Musky or Specks,2012-08-31 03:28:00,2710,Rich have you been to Fisherman's Cove before? You should give it a go or Aarons Lake
726317,Rich,2012-08-31 10:03:00,3927,"Long point bay = 2lb bass, 20"" pike and meat hunters galore. Fun to catch a lot of tiny fish, but big bass (5+) literally dont exist there, and big pike are rare and deep. Long boat ride to big fish.  Havent heard of those place M or S, will have to look them up."
