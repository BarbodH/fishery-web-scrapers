I know something about it interested me.  Unfortunately, I have not been there.  Ultimately I think a longer drive is always better."

726074,Rod Caster,2012-08-30 10:36:00,5784,"Its a bit more upscale than most fishing resorts which can be a good thing. The fishing is pretty good in that lake, huge walleye and pike in there and not very much pressure"

726079,olivethelake,2012-08-30 11:50:00,8,Hey Guys! Appreciate your consideration about coming to Olive the Lake.. If I can help you with any questions please let me know... my email is [emailÂ protected] - Each of our cottages have been renovated and are equipped with Tempur-Pedic mattresses and Randy is correct we are located on a private lake which only has 2 cottages on it. No public access. You get the true Northern Ontario experience here with no other boats to bother you while you are fishing.. Let me know if I can answer any questions..
