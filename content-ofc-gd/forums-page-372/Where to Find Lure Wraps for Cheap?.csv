724538,rhymobot,2012-08-23 13:46:00,174,They are very useful when putting rods away in the car because you don't have to take off the lure which you know you'll be using again soon. I have one from BPS. They cost like $6.79. I saw two other sites and they are also over 6 bucks each.  For something so simple you would think they'd cost like 2 bucks.  Do you know where to find them cheaper? Hell I think a handy person could probably make them too. Cut some fabric into a square and either sew or glue some velcro on.  
724549,bassman87,2012-08-23 14:38:00,586,"The cost of the fabric, velcro, glue, labour will probably be more than $2. Do you need 100s of them or something? Or are you just that frugal"
724554,rhymobot,2012-08-23 14:53:00,174,"i am frugal. not a hardcore angler. basically i have an inflatable with a 30lb thrust troller i got for free. i have 10 rods. all were no more than $25 on sale. all my braided line i got from china for $15 all in. for 300m. haven't bought a lure in 4 years (except a $5 spinner i bought from a local guy who makes them) because i keep finding them when i'm on the water or wading. my anchor is a 10lb dumbbell and the rope is from dollarama. anyway you see where i'm going with this.  when i started out i bought a bunch of lures and accessories, etc including one of these BPS wraps. but there's not a big market for them so there's no incentive i guess for a company to mass produce them to a point where they cost only cents to make and therefore could sell them for 2 bucks a pop. for instance, if there was more of a market for them then dollarama could probably find a manufacturer to produce them and then sell at the store for $1-2 like their lures and $2 retractable rods.  i'd like 3 more lure wraps. don't want to have to spend $22 to buy those 3 little things when i have so many other hobbies i spend money on!  if i had more time i could probably come up with some cheap, crappy alternative with some material lying around in the basement like an old rain coat that'll never be worn again and then buy some velcro dots from dollarama and use crazy glue."

724557,rhymobot,2012-08-23 15:09:00,174, Great site. Thanks for posting it. 3 for $10 is very reasonable. My cousin is the opposite of me. He just got into doing CBAF tournaments and now has a bass boat and was also interested in these since he's probably gonna have 15+ rods on the boat at once between him and his partner.  The other stuff on that link he'll probably be interested in as well.
726134,rhymobot,2012-08-30 15:56:00,174,"  Thanks again. Got the wraps. They are much bigger than my BPS one, which sometimes didn't fully cover a couple of jerk baits I have. These ones can fully close over the lure.  Also got the line spooler. Works awesome. Now I don't have to get someone else to hold the spool or hold the spool in between my toes using a pencil."

726271,gordy28,2012-08-31 01:09:00,638,Glad you got them-other option is to hit BPS in the spring-usually they put there wraps on for 30 to 50 % off (things a Scotsman like myself would know )
726275,mike rousseau,2012-08-31 01:16:00,4661,if your that ... frugal... why not take the 30 seconds to remove all your lures?  i remove all my baits and clean up the boat on the water before i get back to the launch...   ...
726276,danc,2012-08-31 01:18:00,4677," Yup. And a fresh, new knot on your next outing can't hurt either Mike."
726278,rhymobot,2012-08-31 01:22:00,174," frugal but also lazy. after being on the water for so long and deflating the boat and walking all the gear and battery and motor and mount, etc to the car i am too tired for the rest of the details. would rather do all this stuff at home later on with a cold beer nearby.  perhaps if i had a real boat where hooks touching the boat weren't an issue then i'd do that too. but often when i'm river fishing like in spring and fall i know i'm gonna use the same lures over and over again."
726281,woodenboater,2012-08-31 01:34:00,2277,agree with Mike. I have Fastach clips on my lines for quick changes.
