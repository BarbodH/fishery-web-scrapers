725905,mattyk,2012-08-29 16:44:00,2110,Anybody have any experience with these rods? I was thinking of getting a spinning and a casting rod.
725907,Live2fish85,2012-08-29 16:57:00,1633,"They are good rods, I own a few and like them. For what you pay you get a good rod."
725909,Hooked,2012-08-29 17:00:00,891,"I have a spinning one and like it.  I say go for it.  As mentioned, good price for a quality rod."
725910,bigmac1984,2012-08-29 17:01:00,193,"I have had 3 of these (1 spinning, 2 casting) and they are a good rod for the price point of around $100.  I have since started buying mostly shimono stuff and for that same $100 price point, my personal belief is that the Shimano Compre rods are much better for sensitivity and durability.  The other thing to consider is howit feels in YOUR hands.... Take the reels to the stores that you think you will be pairing the rod with and check how it balances and feels in your hands.  Good luck"
725911,Live2fish85,2012-08-29 17:06:00,1633," I own a Compre as well and I don't like it as much as the mojo, saying that though the Compre has a lifetime warranty which is something to think about.  The crucial on the other hand is an amazing rod."
725926,musky_hunter,2012-08-29 18:08:00,328,"The older gen crucials are better than the current ones. Many pros won't use the new ones, too tip heavy and unbalanced."
725943,jedimaster,2012-08-29 19:39:00,3472,"I have a crankbait baitcasting mojo bass rod, and I like it."
725947,DaveMc,2012-08-29 19:56:00,89," i have 4 crucials paired with stradics and 3 paired with chronarcs and find they balance nicely. nice and sensitive as well. Compre's are a very nice rod as well, and you cant beat the warranty."
725948,Bernie66,2012-08-29 20:03:00,123,"I have the Mojo 1 pc spinning dropshot rod.  Like the others have said, great rod for the money. It balances quite well with my new Daiwa Ballistic reel.  Its basically their Premier blank with upgraded cosmetics.  I like purple."
725962,Ainsley,2012-08-29 20:38:00,142,"Pretty nice rods. Haven't used one on the water but they seemed tip heavy in the store. For a step up from that the avid series is very nice. My brother has one and I prefer it to my older shimano crucial. That said, all my new rods have been dobyns."
725967,Cudz,2012-08-29 21:29:00,2652,I have one and it is fine.  For $79.99 you can have a much lighter garcia vendetta.  That is what I would buy.  I have a bps carbonlite that I like way better than the St. Croix
725973,bare foot wader,2012-08-29 21:59:00,1354," x2 on carbon lite (standard guides, not micro guides) johnny morris is a very good rod for 130 as well"
725987,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-29 22:33:00,2038,Absolutely Phenomenal rods !!!!
725992,MCTFisher9120,2012-08-29 22:48:00,3761,"Have a look at Shimano Compre rods, no for grip, great graphite, through blank reel seats so you get fingers on the blank, the eva foam lasts a lifetime and is a lighter material,  and yes as other's mentioned Lifetime Warranty. Not sponsored but I'll bring you to a Compre way before a mojo.  Hope this helps,  MTBF"
726002,steel&chrome,2012-08-29 23:20:00,46,"Great rod for the money! I'm pretty sure it's one of St. croix's top selling rods. Compre is nice too, unless your not a fan of the synthetic foam. If you wanna go crazy you can go a couple steps above and get the Rage, totally different neoprene handle (that doesn't get slippery when wet). Rod is extremely light and has the second smallest guides (next to microguides) such that you can still run knots through the guides without having it affect the casting. But if your set on the mojo, i'd go for it, getting a great product for what you pay for. 5 year warranty only covers manufacture defects!  good luck on the choice!"
726053,Pigeontroller,2012-08-30 02:38:00,2793,I have 2 Mojo Bass Spinning rods and 3 Castings...All good rods for the money.
726070,singingdog,2012-08-30 10:11:00,1047,"IMHO, Compres are a much better rod for the $. Mojos just seem unbalanced to me."
726083,danbouck,2012-08-30 12:08:00,4380,I have a few Mojo's and love them. I hate the feel of Compre's
726093,mattyk,2012-08-30 12:58:00,2110,Thanks for all the feedback buys. Sounds like a toss up between the compres and the mojos.
726101,cl_fishin,2012-08-30 13:37:00,138,I have several Mojo's and love them!!
726125,kickingfrog,2012-08-30 15:21:00,8333, Try them side by side with the reel. Different strokes for different folks.
726144,LucG,2012-08-30 16:42:00,779,"I've never owned a crucials, however I own and have fish the last 3 years with mostly St-Croix, and several mojo bass', both casting and spinning.  I have never broke one yet, not even a guide. Very durable and great for the $. I would recomend them 100%"
726220,Pigeontroller,2012-08-30 21:13:00,2793," Unbalanced...LOL, ironic..."
726272,Cudz,2012-08-31 01:10:00,2652,for $79.99 I meant Abu Garcia Veritas not vendetta.  If you want a real deal on a veritas (the white rod) then go to Canadian Tire.  THey sell the Veritas for $99.99 but sail and BPS sell it for $79.99.  Canadian Tire will price match plus give you 10% back in ctc money of the lowest price item in this case the $80 so you get $8 ctc back.  My CTC in Barrie sells compre rods so all you have to do is find the cheapest compre within 100 km or 250 km (not sure) and they will price match plus give 10% back in CTC money of the lowest price.  Pretty good deal.
