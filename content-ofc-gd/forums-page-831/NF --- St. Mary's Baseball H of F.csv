353931,JohnF,2009-06-20 18:15:00,3494,  Yup. That would be the place.  My sister was actually on the committee that originally started the HOF project. She still gets emails etc from some of the inductees she's met since the opening.  JF
353941,Jonny,2009-06-20 18:45:00,1380,Cool.  Another reason to re-visit the area some time.
353950,aniceguy,2009-06-20 19:16:00,1094,actually at a baseball tournament there in a few weeks and was looking forward to touring it...

353979,Musky or Specks,2009-06-20 20:38:00,2710,aeball Hall of Fame is a pretty cool gig for us baseball geeks. My son and I had the pleasure one year of watching the Jr Nationals from oth the US and Canada play a game and then went swimming with the US national team at the quarry. Lots of current major leaguers were on that team.

354031,fishing n autograph,2009-06-21 00:00:00,2540,"Yeah, the cdn HOF is a neat little attraction and you'll find some awesome players do show up. I missed this year because I couldn't get the day off, but when I have been down there I met Tommy Lasorda, Andre Dawson, Dave Stieb, Steve Rogers, Tony Perez, Doc Taylor, just to name a few. But for the ulitmate baseball geek, the Hall in Cooperstown is a great trip. Was there last year and will be seeing it again in August"
