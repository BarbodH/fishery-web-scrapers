If my memory serves me correct, there were a number of cottages on the lake but LOTS of kayakers. We were passing through in the evening and it was a gorgeous paddle...  Hmm, not portaging really limits your options between those two lakes. I'd guess Cache would be the nicest paddle, lots of islands and whatnot. Both Canisbay and Smoke can get windswept, especially the latter.  Enjoy!"
