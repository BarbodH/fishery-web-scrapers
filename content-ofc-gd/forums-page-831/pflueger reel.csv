352116,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-15 12:41:00,1022,"I bought a pflueger reel last summer, and i'm noticing that when i pull line out the drag does not make the usual noise it used to (it is silenced, and does not make a noise at all). Adjusting the drag still works fine, but I would like to hear it especially when I catch a fish, so I can adjust it if need be. Any suggestions?"

352533,Uncle Buck,2009-06-16 17:09:00,1000,maybe the fish you catch are so small that they aren't pulling any drag
