Normally I don't pass these on, but this one is interesting, and applies equally to our Canadian gov't too. So here goes - Dawg, sorry for the long read sans pics.  JF    It is a slow day in the East Texas town of Madisonville.   It is raining, and the little town looks totally deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt and everybody lives on credit. On this particular day a rich tourist from the East is driving through town.   He enters the only hotel in the sleepy town and lays a hundred dollar billon the desk stating he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.   As soon as the man walks up the stairs, the hotel proprietor takes the hundred dollar bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.   The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to pay his debt to the pig farmer. The pig farmer then takes the $100 and heads off to pay his debt to the supplier of feed and fuel.   The guy at the Farmer's Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has lately had to offer her ""services"" on credit.   The hooker runs to the hotel and pays off her debt with the $100 to the hotel proprietor, paying for the rooms that she had rented when she brought clients to that establishment.   The hotel proprietor then lays the $100 bill back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.   At that moment the traveler from the East walks back down the stairs, after inspecting the rooms.   He picks up the $100 bill and states that the rooms are not satisfactory...... Pockets the money and walks out the door and leaves town.   No one earned anything. However the whole town is now out of debt, and looks to the future with a lot of optimism.   That, ladies and gentlemen, is how the United States Government is conducting business today.   If that doesn't scare the hell out of you, then I don't know what will."

353231,NAW,2009-06-18 15:49:00,4022,That's good stuf.  I wonder where the rich guy spent the night??  Probly with the hooker!
353236,Rich Clemens,2009-06-18 16:06:00,3131,  Thus starts the vicious cycle again
353237,Dara,2009-06-18 16:08:00,3052,Sounds fishy to me.  Thought you said this was non fishing
353244,JohnF,2009-06-18 16:59:00,3494,"It's kinda like that ""If a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it.."" things.  I've occasionally wondered where the money really is when I pay my bills over the internet from an account to which I made a deposit of a piece of paper purported to have a particular value but never did I actually see any of this currency.  It adds new meaning to ""The buck stops here.""  JF"
353285,Radnine,2009-06-18 19:39:00,1538,"So, there are hookers in Texas? Jim"
353286,JohnF,2009-06-18 19:44:00,3494, Evidently. Whoda thunk it?  JF
353380,HTHM,2009-06-19 00:34:00,4082,"Yes of course, fishing is very popular down there....."
