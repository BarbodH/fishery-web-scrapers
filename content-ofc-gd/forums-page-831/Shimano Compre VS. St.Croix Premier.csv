353455,CrappieCamo,2009-06-19 03:37:00,14,"2 pcs med. heavy rod, what do you guys' vote? One piece rod should be better, but due to the convenience, need to get a 2pcs one. Prices for these two rods are quite the same, so, give me your 2cents:)  Shimano Compre (IM-8 graphite):  CPC-X610MHB2 6'10"" MH XF LINE10-20 lURE 3/8-1 2pcs  St.Croix Premier (Premium-quality SCII graphite): PC66MHF2  6'6"" MH Fast LINE 10-20 lURE 3/8-1 2pcs"
353457,Pigeontroller,2009-06-19 03:42:00,2793,Can't go wrong with either!
353481,archie_james_c,2009-06-19 08:43:00,618,"The St.Croix, being that its only a ""fast action"" will have more of a spongy tip to it. Were as the Shimano is ""extra-fast action"" will be a stiffer tip.  Two rods almost identical...yet so different.  I'd also bug you to bump up to the Avid Series St.Croix's. They're 50ish dollars more but you get a lifetim ewarranty as opposed to the 5 year...but still, you'll be happy with either I'm sure   ."
353490,mattyk,2009-06-19 11:24:00,2110,St Croix gets my vote.
353504,silveradosheriff,2009-06-19 12:11:00,1025,"I fish with both and love them both....comes down to a value decision, IMHO. Good point about the Avid warranty too!"
353506,Pigeontroller,2009-06-19 12:17:00,2793,"Generally, the more you spend, the lighter and nicer the rod. I bought my first St Croix Legend Tournament Muskie rod yesterday, its a thing of beauty!!!"
353509,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-19 12:22:00,1022,For me it would come down to the warranty. The compre is lifetime and st croix is 5 years.
353515,Raf,2009-06-19 12:38:00,3495,"go to a store, pick em up and see which one feels better to you.  i bet it'll be the st.croix.  warranty shmarantee. just my opinion"
353524,fish-miester,2009-06-19 13:08:00,864,"both nice rods, have both of them in 7' but honestly im a big fan of warranties .. so shimano has my vote.."
353533,CrappieCamo,2009-06-19 13:27:00,14,"Thank you, all of you gave great info.  About Avid series, St.Croix only has one piece casting rod, but i need it to be two pieces... I have a Avid MH spinning rod, love it so much, totally worth for the money.  Considering the warranty is a good point! I think i might go for Shimano Compre for life time warranty. Thanks!"
353645,ecmilley,2009-06-19 20:14:00,2163,"I have a couple compres and a couple premiers there both good rods it'll come down to which one you like, i prefer the feel and weight of the st.croix"
353819,singingdog,2009-06-20 11:06:00,1047,"The Compres are lots of rod for the $, and they seem to be very lenient with the lifetime warranty. I know of 2 folks that have slammed rod tips in car doors, been very up front about it with shimano, and still had the rods replaced. I have 4 Compres and like them a lot.  The difference between extra fast and fast could make a difference. If it's a huck-and-crank rod (crankbaits, spinnerbaits) then the slower action of the St Croix might be nice. IMHO, the speed and sensitivity of the Compres really lend themselves to jig fishing."
