I don't have a boat, and usually end up on the shore of Rice, and down the Severn to Brighton and Trenton area..  Im out of Colborne, and would like to find a few spots that I can drive to and fish from shore.. and stay with in about a 1hr drive..  Even PM if you don't want to post public.  Thanks"
