I wonder if the bass are behind their romping schedule...  Almost July and it's raining and 60F right now... I was hoping for warm sunny weather for my camping trip.. but i better bring my early season gear...  Global warming, eh? this is last year all over again..."
353106,Greencoachdog,2009-06-18 01:24:00,8163,It was 95*F+ here at 5:30 pm today... and hotter than a blistered pinocha in a pepper patch!!!
353142,bigugli,2009-06-18 03:18:00,6138,"A cooler spring, yes. Has it adversely affected the bite?  Not in Niagara."
353381,Rich,2009-06-19 00:34:00,3927,It hasn't really been that cool though.. everyone keeps saying that. I remember very few nights this time of year last year that I could be out in a t-shirt.. this June the majority of nights I can comfortably be out ... sans the mosquitos
353383,Spiel,2009-06-19 00:40:00,9065,I'm betting lots of bass will still be on the beds come opening weekend.
353624,Beans,2009-06-19 19:28:00,3339,I don't know if this is a true indicator but these flowers (peonies) are at least 12 days later blooming than when I took pictures of them a couple of years ago  
353702,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-19 22:37:00,10439,"Quit yer whining, at least you have open water!!!! Here are some shots my boss took last Thursday on a flight South. I have provided a map with the areas still ice covered for your amusement.  ;D I had planned a trip to the East Arm over the July holiday, but she's still gonna be frozed up!!! It was a long cold winter in these parts.        "
353738,Jonny,2009-06-19 23:59:00,1380,You can even see ice on the map!!!
353759,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-20 01:14:00,10439,  That's my awesome photo editing work. I wanted to show where the ice was.
353760,Kenny G,2009-06-20 01:21:00,118,You have some awesome photos in your website. Do you spend the winter up there as well? Kenny G.
353788,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-20 02:23:00,10439," Thanks Yep, been living up here full time since the winter of 2005."
