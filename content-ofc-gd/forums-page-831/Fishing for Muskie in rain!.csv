Or should I ask has anyone caught one while it's been pissing? Going Satarday by myself and wondering if they are more aggresive when it rains. Last week my son and I caught a 4lb bucket mouth off a red bucktail tipped with a white grub, also surprised to see a crappie hit it too! I have pic's but can't figure out how to crop them to fit without keeping them that size."
353435,Governator,2009-06-19 02:42:00,879,"My best pike day this year (10 fish) was caught in the pouring rain.  I don't know about muskies, but from my limited experience fishing has always been better in the rain or at least overcast."
353436,Handlebarz,2009-06-19 02:44:00,3790,try using photobucket for your pics.  As for rainy day musky yes they love the rain one reason I like the rain is that not many others are out they are sitting at home watching fishing
353445,splashhopper,2009-06-19 02:57:00,2931,  Use www.photobucket.com for the pics  set up an account... upload photos to it...  then copy and paste from the last drop down item on the pic... paste it here and voila... a nice pic for you
353453,Rizzo,2009-06-19 03:15:00,4754,"I only get out about 10 times a year and I can't recall any really rainy days (lots of snowy ones though, and muskies seem to like them!). Looks like I can get out Saturday morning for a few hours...hope I have a positive answer for you. Regardless, you can't catch em from your living room (unless you have a really awesome living room) so give it a shot rain or shine."
353459,Sinker,2009-06-19 03:54:00,8692,The nastier the better for musky. We got a few in the rain today. It was good and windy too!!   S.
353471,gone_fishin,2009-06-19 05:20:00,481,"i was out on scugog today (thursday), started fishing at 9:30am and didn't get any skis until the clouds blew over at 8:45pm... then between me and my buddy we landed 1 each and i lost one boatside... all three came within 20 minutes!!!"

353484,Weeds,2009-06-19 10:18:00,782,The majority of my musky catches have come on bright and hot days although I have caught one or two in the rain.
353500,Greencoachdog,2009-06-19 11:46:00,8163,"If it's not thundering and lightning I usually do well for almost all fish.... they don't care if it's raining, they're already wet!  I find if there's a big electrical storm the fish will be kinda spooked and slow to bite for a day or two after."
353514,tipupesox,2009-06-19 12:35:00,167,"I had one of my best musky fishing days on Sturgeon lake on a rainy day.  Went 6/9 on a chartruese/red bucktail.  We had fronts moving through all day with on and off rain.  Some of the fish were caught casting close to the banks and shoreline structure.  I will be out trolling Buffalo Harbor tomorrow morning for the NY state muskie opener.  Hope to hook in to a nice trophy size Lake Erie lunge.  Good Luck, Tom"
353529,ChrisK,2009-06-19 13:14:00,2772,My best days of fishing reguardless for what was always the calm before the storm....Its like the fish know whats coming and they put on the feed bag...
