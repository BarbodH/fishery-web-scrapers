353261,camillj,2009-06-18 17:52:00,1988,"Yep .. my first car was was a souped up '69 Camaro Z28 ... I used to get a huge fist pump from anyone driving anything remotely sporty with a chevy logo on it ... and the one finger salute from the Pontiac - Firebird folks (when they got left in the dust)  There was definitely a ""we"" - ""they"" thing going on back then ... too many different teams now since the expansion"
353263,EC1,2009-06-18 17:56:00,930," I drive a subaru myself, but nothing modded..and yes, the winter is amazingly fun!!!"
353265,Dara,2009-06-18 18:02:00,3052,  Do you get some good riding there?
353295,Tybo,2009-06-18 20:17:00,1373,Waving on a boat was not a gesture. I was too tell the other craft what side you where going to pass.
353296,Tybo,2009-06-18 20:19:00,1373,Billy Bob. you do realize that trailer is not attached to the truck.
353311,ecmilley,2009-06-18 21:02:00,2163," i rode from mid november to the end of march this past winter, we have about 200 km trails we make  ourselves, the lake and ofsc trails on the otherside of the lake, so we get lots of good riding"
353351,Great Lake Steel,2009-06-18 23:06:00,41," Mine's not really modded, not yet anyways it's still under warranty. What are you driving?"
353357,Greencoachdog,2009-06-18 23:23:00,8163,"Don't stop for the ""wavers"", unless you're a ""waver"" too...   .. not that there's anything wrong with that..."
353429,Dara,2009-06-19 02:32:00,3052,  don't tell me....GM
353464,Raf,2009-06-19 04:27:00,3495," so that was you waving...    ps, luv the church st. camo."
353467,holdfast,2009-06-19 04:54:00,1813,Caught you. You must be Danbos Twin Brother.
353505,Billy Bob,2009-06-19 12:11:00,5865," YES, COFFEE is over with and everyone was to go to LUNCH..."
353034,JohnF,2009-06-17 22:35:00,3494," Well, that explains how my Subaru driving single buddy scores all the women he does. I guess I should tell him they're all lesbians, d'ya think? That might spoil his day.  JF"
353037,Fishnwire,2009-06-17 22:40:00,983,"  The YJ is a direct descendant of the original and still the greatest off-road vehicle ever made...hands down.  All others are mere pretenders.  All bragging and kidding aside...when it comes to off-roading, tires are probably more important than what spins 'em.  Driver know-how is right up there too."
353039,Billy Bob,2009-06-17 22:47:00,5865," Hey, I'm a Tundra hugger, like in Toyota Tundra.................but before Tundra I was in a GM club and I would do a lot of waving to tow trucks to stop....."
353042,Great Lake Steel,2009-06-17 22:58:00,41," Yes, we're out there and have our own club.  And sinker, I think I stole the first redneck in a scooby title. The guys that fish eastern tribs have likely seen me around.  Usually, you only get waves from modified scoobys to other modified scoobys, there's just too many 'normal' ones around. If you think you love it when you first get it... wait until the winter!  check out the toronto subaru club (really all of ontario) for some meets, parts hookups etc."
353051,Sinker,2009-06-17 23:11:00,8692," I'm not even going to ask why your on a gay wheels site........  If you knew the deal I got on it, you'd snatch it up too.  I know nothing about subaru's at all.......I'm a dodge ram kinda guy myself. This thing is gonna get a work out  S."
353068,Raf,2009-06-18 00:16:00,3495," I was just uhh.. confirming the rumours.    Could be worse, it could be a Miata.  I'm teasing, I've owned a AWD/Turbo before and even if yours is non-turbo, you will love it.  It will go places in conditions you'd never expect."
353070,Sinker,2009-06-18 00:19:00,8692,"If it wasn't turbo, I wouldn't have it  Seems like all the people who have never had one are the ones knocking them..........jealousy makes people do crazy stuff  S."
353077,JohnF,2009-06-18 00:28:00,3494," Back in the day I had some pretty nifty (read fast) sleds, but I haven't even been on one in close to 30 years. It would be fun to try some of the new stuff.  JF"
353078,Pigeontroller,2009-06-18 00:35:00,2793,Waving at another driver cause they are driving the same brand/model is dumb.
353082,JohnF,2009-06-18 00:41:00,3494, Why do boaters wave as they pass on the waterways?  JF
353086,HTHM,2009-06-18 00:55:00,4082,Because they are hoping that the seatcovers in the other boat are comperable to the seatcovers in yours'.
353091,Spiel,2009-06-18 01:00:00,9065," I always thought that was a courtesy extended in lieu of shouting over the old 2 stroke for ""thanks for not ramming into me""."
353093,CLofchik,2009-06-18 01:01:00,854," Here's the lowdown on biker waves for the unintiated.   I don't get why people in cages wave at each other, other than people pointing & laughing at a man driving a Miata."
353095,JohnF,2009-06-18 01:01:00,3494, Mebbe that's all drivers are doing.  JF
353126,corvette1,2009-06-18 02:11:00,1765,yes it's a corvette thing too
353130,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-18 02:23:00,10439,  Spoken like a true Pacer owner!!!
353133,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-18 02:40:00,10439, Yamaha has a turbo upgrade the will bring there top performance sleds up to 205 HP!!!! That's a whole lot of YEE HAA!!!!!! right there.
353146,Fishnwire,2009-06-18 03:23:00,983,"  I used to think so until I owned a Jeep.  It's not the vehicle for everyone...there's lots about them that some people find off-putting...but it's the perfect fit for me.  I guess it's all about identifying with others who also find them so appealing.  I tend to imagine (rightly or wrongly) that all Jeepers have similar lifestyles and interests to myself.  I've driven over beaver dams in my YJ to get where I want to go.  I've taken it into places some people wouldn't take their quads.  It's literally changed the way I think about bush access.  When I see another guy whose got that figured out too, I feel just fine about flashing him a wave."
353156,Jonny,2009-06-18 04:26:00,1380,"Hunters wave too.  It's kind of a ""Hey you DO see me here, don't you?"" wave.  Kind of looking for reassurance that a shot won't come your way."
353174,outllaw,2009-06-18 10:45:00,1232,jeep for sure. its kinda nice to know you aint gettin stuck. my jeep has never been back to the dealer.
353197,holdfast,2009-06-18 13:02:00,1813, Thats because they were Pink.
353228,Dara,2009-06-18 15:37:00,3052,"  Gotta love em. I have a Rage right now and figure on upgrading to something a bit quicker next year. 12,500 k in 3 seasons.  As for on the road, I have a Toyota Tundra right now with the 5.7. We have a quiet club. When you see that 5.7 on it, you know that guy has a whole lot of get up an go. You don't realize till you own one just what they will do."
353248,ecmilley,2009-06-18 17:12:00,2163,"have an apex here and it's been worked over alittle around 155hp and a stage3 clutch kit     bigger sway bar ect, get some shoulders with that one"
353251,Billy Bob,2009-06-18 17:22:00,5865, YEP..........nobody beats TUNDRA........ 
353254,Stoty,2009-06-18 17:31:00,2910,"I used to do that when I had my Z28, and Xtreme.  I only do it now to guys towing boats, when I have the Ranger on the back."
352862,Fishnwire,2009-06-17 13:54:00,983,"I've been driving a Jeep YJ for a couple years now.  I noticed shortly after I bought it that other Jeep Wrangler drivers would comonly wave (or give the two-finger peace sign) as we pass each other on the street.  My Jeep is obviously modified...lift kit, big mudders, winch, bush lights, etc...so I notice that while most Jeep drivers will wave at me, guys with units that have been worked on will almost always wave.  It's like we're in a club.  My question is this:  Has anyone else driven a vehicle that they waved to other owners of?  I have heard Toyota Prius drivers wave to each other.  Also, I'm pretty sure guys on motorbikes wave, unless one guy's on a crotch-rocket and the other is on a Harely.  There are usually little ""rules"" that come along with being in the ""club.""  Boaters often wave, as do guys on quads if they meet up on a backroad in the middle of no where.  Can anyone add to that?"
352864,Raf,2009-06-17 13:58:00,3495,as a fellower heeper (XJ) i've noticed it too.  noticed it in my former vehicles as well.
352867,Roy,2009-06-17 14:08:00,13728,"YJ here. It's kind of a neighbourly thing to do. I always wave and almost always get waved AT. But  I sometimes notice that owners of other vehicles  wave at me too. I think some of the friendliest are Mercedes owners. When I pass one in traffic and look in my rearview I can almost always count on them waving at me...well, it's kind of a wave."
352869,JohnF,2009-06-17 14:09:00,3494,"Back in the day all us sports car drivers would acknowledge the others as we passed, usually the v-sign (in the 60's and early 70's, what else?) and then I remember bikers all doing it, except for the too cool chopper leathervests who didn't deign to acknowledge anyone else unless they flew the colours. The bike salute was a little under the bars finger flick.  JF"
352870,Fishnwire,2009-06-17 14:10:00,983,"Roy, that's a one finger wave...most Jeepers use at least two.  "
352878,cranks bait,2009-06-17 14:41:00,721,I guess you could say I'm in a club.  When other people pass by me driving a Honda Ridgeline I get the wave.  I was one of the first to drive one so I've noticed it since the beginning.  I'm now on my second one.  I tend to not really notice any more.  When ever my now ex-wife was with me she called it the ridgewave?
352879,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-17 14:45:00,10439,Us snowmobiling types do the wave thing too.
352884,JohnF,2009-06-17 15:03:00,3494, I just thought they were protecting their eyes from the blast of snow and ice as I passed.  JF
352899,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-17 16:05:00,10439,"   PFFFFFFFT, PUHLEEZE!!!!!! I just cruise around on me little grocery getter.  "
352906,JohnF,2009-06-17 16:15:00,3494, Jeez. That looks raunchier than any of my racing sleds ever did back in the early 70's.  JF
352908,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-17 16:20:00,1022,"I drive VW's and people wave to me. My girlfriend drives a beetle, and when she drives by kids they start punching each other. Children refer to them as ""punch buggies"". Maybe one day i'll see a good scrap....lol j/k"
352916,bdox,2009-06-17 16:46:00,329,"I have a ZR2 Blazer, and notice other ZR2 owners will usually give a little wave or nod."
352923,JohnF,2009-06-17 17:30:00,3494,Mebbe I should start a Flex club. Instead of waving we might just pop a bicep or something. In my case it'll be a very subtle acknowledgement.  JF
352945,shane,2009-06-17 18:33:00,652,"Back in my Volkswagon van days, it was the 'snail wave'.  Kind of a modified, wiggle your two fingers, peace sign.  Man, I miss that van.  And those days."
352948,JohnF,2009-06-17 18:36:00,3494, And there had to be dense whitish smoke leaking out of every opening.  JF
