One thing that ive always disliked with northern King spoons is that the tape comes off after afew good fish.  alot of times it only last afew hours when the lakers are on fire...  before    after        after they dried..    they were ready for the real test!    heck of alot cheaper than buying new ones.   i sealed them all with a good epoxy clear coat so the paint should last a long long time!
