The Lowrance was not showing much so we moved to the north and found an active school of good sized fish. We C&R 4 that were over 27"" and the young fellow I was fishing with kept his 6 for his family. With the fronts that came thru the fish were a bit deeper, but still were hungry for a baitfish image blade with a fat crawler.  "
