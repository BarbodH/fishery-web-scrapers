352124,silveradosheriff,2009-06-15 13:09:00,1025,"Hello fellow anglers….headed out with a couple of buddies to try our luck for Musky on Lake Scugog.  After wiping the dust off my vessel and fuelling up (thank God it only takes 80L) we headed off to Port Perry.  Less than an hour into it, my buddy Rob (Iceguy) nails this lovely 43” off a spinnerbait in heavy cover.  Took off like a bat out of hell upon release…..  It was great to be back out chasing skies!    "
