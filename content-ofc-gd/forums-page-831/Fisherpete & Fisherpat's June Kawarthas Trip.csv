353465,Fisherpete,2009-06-19 04:29:00,1814,"Well, our second annual June fishing trip has come and gone. It was a great week, despite some poor weather for the first five days. We had eight amazing days of good food and drink, tons of fishing time and fresh air. Balsam (4 days), Dalrymple (2 days) and Rice (2 days, but never left the dock - didn't have to!) were the lakes of choice this time. The final big fish tally:  Fisherpete - total 39  Muskie landed = 0 Muskie hooked/lost = 1 (mid 30's fish on a figure eight) Muskie follows = 3 (and one was the biggest I have ever seen, high 40's+) Walleye = 10 SM bass = 3 LM bass = 9 Pike = 14 Carp = 2 Panfish - 1* (we only counted panfish over the OFAH award minimum size  - I caught a PB 9.5"" bluegill)  Fisherpat - total 20, but really the champ due to musky being king!  Muskie landed = 2 (24"" and 36"", no pic of the 36"" as it jumped out of the cradle after unhooking!) Muskie hooked/lost = 0 Muskie follows = 2 (one small, one mid 40's class fish) Walleye = 3 SM bass = 3 LM bass = 5 Pike = 7 Carp = 2  The two of us are true casters, jigging and trolling just does not keep us interested for very long. Of all the time we spent on the water, maybe 3 or 4 hours in total was spent trolling. The same goes for jigging, I have no problem doing it in the winter through the ice, but give me open water and I just have to chuck lures all day!  There were a few really nice bass caught, and they actually came from deep water so I doubt they were spawning, but out of respect for the whole OOS issue I won't post any of them. I still find it incredible that a 19"" largemouth will nail a 10"" believer, or a huge bucktail. Shy they ain't!  Anyways, enjoy the pics - we sure had fun in the making and taking of them.  First fish of the trip, a nice walleye. All 15 walleye caught on the trip were in the slot size for Balsam, so no yummy Chronzy-style shore lunches  Another.  Pike time... no true biggies, but lots in the 22-25"" range, and some fought like champs.  Pat gets his first pike of the trip.  Another for me. Notice a theme with the rain gear? Didn't hurt the fishing or dampen our spirits though.  Nice walleye by Pat.  A few more walleyes by me to close out the evening.     Time for some more Pike action... I was on fire on this day, 12 pike over 6 hours, 11 of them coming in the final 1.5! Pat got five for the day.  A deer came by the shore to say hello, not shy of us at all.        Nice sunset on this night.  Pat's second muskie, 24"". The cast before this guy followed right to the side of the boat. Next cast, he SMASHED the lure.  Walleyes came out to play, despite bluebird skies and glassy water.     Final sunset at Balsam before heading to Rice.  Our target at Rice was carp, and at my cottage you don't even have to leave the dock. Throw out some corn and wait, and ye shall soon be rewarded! Anyone who hasn't yet caught a carp - TRY IT. These things fight harder than you can imagine! The kids had a blast with the panfish right off the dock as well, Rice is perhaps one of the best places to bring the little ones as the action is constant, and the sunfish are pretty big too! I hit the first two carp within minutes of getting there, a 28"" and a 32.5"". The second one fought like a freight train for a good ten minutes, screaming drag off my Stradic making long runs.   My son Nick and his friend Justin had a blast in the little tinny with my minn kota hooked up to the back. They stayed close to the dock, and caught piles of sunfish.  Justin's sister Chrystal was quite the little fishergirl!  I had some fun with the sunfish on the ultralight. Amazing colours on the various species of sunfish.   Pat gets his first carp, 28.5"".  Nick with a sunny.  Chrystal with one.  Pat with carp #2, a 29"".   Next fishing holiday - first week of July! Bass better beware, and hopefully a muskie will grace my line."
353477,Roy,2009-06-19 06:52:00,13728,"Great report Pete! Glad you, Pat and the young'ns had a good time. You certainly hit a smorgasbord of fish there. Great pics too, thanks for sharing."
353487,bigugli,2009-06-19 10:46:00,6138,Great report. You got a good mix of fish over the week.   Nice to see the young ones having fun as well.
353489,laszlo,2009-06-19 11:06:00,487,I too am a casting machine. When my brother in-law and I go on our fishing trip we must make a million cast by the end of it. We're good for about 30 minutes of trolling a day and the same for jigging.  There's nothing better then finding structure and placing that perfect cast to be rewarded with a good size fish.
353491,Tom McCutcheon,2009-06-19 11:25:00,627,Love the pictures Pete. It's good to see youngsters getting experience like that. Well done.  Tom.

353525,Headhunter,2009-06-19 13:09:00,5703,"Looks like you guys had a blast, but more so the kids! Although, not really a carp fan, those carp looks pretty clean and healthy! Thanks for the report and BTW - really nice pics! HH"

353747,Fisherpete,2009-06-20 00:21:00,1814,"No, thank god, they were all from Dalrymple, aka 'hammerhandle lake"". I have never caught a pike yet from Balsam, but two tigers."
353750,Kerry,2009-06-20 00:31:00,383,Great pics and I'm glad those pike aren't from balsam.Had me thinkin' of doing some preventative catching and eatin' Kerry
