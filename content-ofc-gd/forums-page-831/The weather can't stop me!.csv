Spent the entire day soaked, but it was worth it. The fish were biting non stop and that's all that mattered       May not be bass, but the cats fight, and that Bowfin ran. Catching 7-8 fish an hour sure keeps you busy."
353368,Spiel,2009-06-19 00:03:00,9065,A regular plethora of fishies you got there Bruce. I'll bet the weather kept the bug bites to a minimum.

353486,bigugli,2009-06-19 10:30:00,6138," The oldtimers always put them in the smokehouse along with the sheephead, ling, etc...  She certainly put up a scrap. Hefty too. Near as long as my bait net is wide"
