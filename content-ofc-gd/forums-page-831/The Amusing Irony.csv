353873,DANIMAL,2009-06-20 15:20:00,215,"  I believe that what humans are doing is the natural order of evolution. Its suvival of the fittest. We have just evolved so greatly that in order for any thing to survive including ourselves, we must controll and not just conquer."
353890,JohnF,2009-06-20 16:17:00,3494," Air pollution, destruction of the rain forests, nuclear waste dumps, ground water contamination, contaminated industrial wastelands, total or partial extinction of species, decimation of non-renewable resources, and so on - definitely we're at the apex for the moment, and we're surviving (sort of), but should those things really be a part of the natural order? We have come to a belated acknowledgement of the harm we're doing, and are taking steps, albeit inadequately, to fix the problems we've created, but all in all our imprint on our world has not exactly covered man in glory.  That being said I agree that man's impact is an absolutely intrinsic part of evolution.  But as the apex critter we have to rein in our collective ego and greed and appreciate that we have an obligation to responsibly manage the resources, not just exploit them to our advantage. And a very small part of that responsible decision making has to be whether we have the ethical or moral right to redesign nature simply to provide better sport fisheries. Remember the law of physics ""For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."" That applies here. Unfortunately the equal and opposite reaction isn't always too easy to predict. Back to the bunnies in Australia.  Sorry if I'm belabouring this. I just find it an interesting exercise. I'm certainly no fan of Green Peace or P3TA. I think they started off with good intentions but have fallen victim to their own whackoness.  Oh, and one other comment - there are some who suggest that man has ceased to evolve and has actually begun the devolution process, kind of one step forward, two back.  I'll quit now,  JF"

Now I think it's over 6 billion. We in Canada are growing slowly but other areas of the world are not. We are attuned to management and conservation. Other areas of the world are not. The problems of the wider world will encroach more and more upon us, and there's little we can do about it.  I am satisfied that we are pretty good as far as the enviroment is concerned and we are very fortunate to live where we do."

353929,Garry2Rs,2009-06-20 18:12:00,1425,"I apologies to those who are really north of #17, for referring to the Kawarthas as being ""up north."" It was just a figure if speech. I was aiming at those peculiar people from the City, who think we country folks want their city-litter.  Interesting irony with Zebra Mussels and Gobies... Whenever Zebra Mussels arrived in the Great Lakes they had no natural enemies and found an abundant food supply in our dirty water. They bred out of control and soon did harm by plugging water inlet pipes etc. At the same time as a fringe benefit they did good by making the water LOOK cleaner...but did bad for some waters by allowing deeper weed growth, but did good for other waters by allowing more food carrying weed growth. The mussels, who had now filtered our  toxins out of the water, became, themselves,  highly toxic.  Goby are considered an important prey fish in many waters. When they arrived, in our waters, it was considered bad because they competed with native prey fish... But the Goby eat the Zebra mussels, which was good.  Since there were tons of Zebra Mussels, it was the Gobies turn to breed out of control... They concentrated the poisons from the mussels further,  so they themselves become very toxic. When they are in turn eaten by Bass and Walleye, they pass the poison up stream.  The obvious result of an expanding supply of Goby was that SMBass and Walleye have experienced an explosion in size and population.  Where there are Trout and Salmon, more fish, means more food for them too. In the long run, more and bigger game fish further Sport fishing...  The net results, you ask? Well as the Zebra population is reduced the Goby population will decrease as well. The classic case of eating ones self out of house and home...grin. Bass populations will fall back toward more normal levels as will the Walleye. There will still be more and better fishing than we had before, because the Zebra Mussels found a new unutilized food source, and in turn through the Gobies, passed this new food source up to the game fish.  Whether those fish are fit to eat doesn't concern me. The lowly Zebra Mussels have increased the carrying capacity of the water! As the idiom suggests, ""It's an ill wind that blows no good."" Which means, that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems at the time, it always benefits someone! Hahaha."

Do we ever stop to think that man is the ultimate invasive species? Everywhere man has moved on this planet he has altered habitats and eradicated indigenous critters with cavalier disregard for the long term effects.  A small part of me can't help but chuckle at our righteous indignation when we see zebra mussels, pike, carp, crappie, gobies and all the others moving into our hallowed grounds. Some of them remain evil while others are ultimately accepted, sometimes with relish.  I'm not saying we're wrong to be unhappy about the changes, but we really need to keep it in perspective, and perhaps think about our own invasive tendencies. I for one sure hope the critters don't go into some kind of superevolution and gang up on us as invasive. We'd be in deep doodoo. We may only be the alpha critter temporarily.

Every so called ""invasive"" was transplanted willingly, or unwittingly by human hand. Time will tell the real outcome.  However, consider this.  Mother nature, in her complexity, is flexible.  Evolution is all about adaptation, but it does take time. There is  a certain amount of upheaval and ecological instability until nature rebalances. Native species have adapted to the new species and include them in the diet. Small mouth eat gobies, as will perch.  Panfish are eating smaller zebra and quagga mussels.  Yes we may lose a species or two, like the blue pickerel, but that can result from climate shift and the warming of our more southern lakes."

For example gobbies I never thought anything ate thoes things but when Rich, Splenda and I were out a few weeks ago Splenda had one on his line and a largemouth was on it like a fat kid on a smartie not saying that they are any help to the waters they invade but nature has adapted to them. Zebra mussels and pike on the othere hand mother earth hasn't tackled that one quit yet but eventually it all seems to equal out.   oh and on garry2rs its not just city folk that litter almost everyone does it and it does suck but its great that your making some cash off of it"

(I'm not saying there's nothing we can do to help this situation)  Might as well enjoy whatever aspects of it as we can.  Example: I love shooting carp in Simcoe.  I don't like the fact that they destroy habitat for other native species.  Me shooting a few carp each year isn't going to lower the number enough to make a difference.  BUT, I still love shooting them!"
353545,JohnF,2009-06-19 14:05:00,3494, That's part of it.  But what actually got me thinking about it was the post about turtle nesting season and the difficulties we've created for the turtles in their procreation. Having spent a lot of hours over the last few years fishing the same creeks I played on as a kid in the 50's I can tell you for certain there are fewer turtles of all varieties nowadays in their old haunts. We don't see mudpuppies or Kingfishers any more either. I guess the cormorants are nature's payback.  JF
353546,blaque,2009-06-19 14:05:00,2419,"In all seriousness....i see your point. We even introduce,.....purposely,......... non indigenous creatures into what we like to think are ""our"" own little custom made fisheries.........but the word custom here is exactly that. Its tailored to some, not all. One mans trash is another mans treasure. Some see bass as a garbage fish, and some see carp as a game fish , some see pike as a prize fish.......and some see musky as more valuable. And the exact opposite is true for others. Its all subjective i guess. Im suppporting your post by the way, not sure if its coming off that way lol.  Gobies and zebra mussels are a different topic i think. The actual ""invasive"" species list so to speak. And even these species.....there are some that see them as a positive. Zebra mussles are improving water quality which to some is good...to some its bad. On the same token, they are full of the toxins they filter and some species feed off this. Not good?. Unless its the goby that feeds off of them someday, then it turns into a good thing? Gobies die off? Or is that a bad thing because our shores will be filled with dead rotting disease carrying gobies that will need an emergency clean up? The gobies are also even being looked at positively by many smallmouth anglers on Erie, professional tournament anglers and others. Because the smallmouth gorge on them and it is creating a trophy smally fishery. Its all way too crazy to manage and even think about. Im glad im not a fisheries biologist in this day and age LOL"

353668,Jonny,2009-06-19 21:02:00,1380,"Like most things there's a balance to be struck. We humans have our needs and preferences too. We shouldn't feel guilty about that. The whole issue is a little more visible with animals than with fish, in particular because issues don't impact only those who are after the animals, but the public at large.  For example, black bears and people don't mix. When bears exist in areas that people expand into, or if they get into areas where people live, they can cause all sorts of problems, some of them dangerous. We're not going to move over, so the bears have to.  Similarly, large populations of deer can impact the general human population because of the increased risk of collisions.  Now you can say we created or established the conditions for conflict in the first place, but that's just the way it is.  Where populations of animals are endangered we rightly have to protect or otherwise manage them with care. We might even have to subordinate our needs and wishes to the existence of the species.  Where populations are healthy and sustainable, and provide an enhancement, we should use them wisely.  Where animals are numerous and come into conflict with our needs, we have to control them. Whether it's pike killing off a highly desirable muskie fishery, or cormorants degrading the environment, or bears causing problems for people, we should not feel guilty, or be made to feel guilty, for acting in our own interests, whether for safety or simply for our own preferences ."

Not to be too argumentative, and frankly I suspect we agree on this whole thing, but at what point does man accept subordination to the best interests of the critters. For example, is the protection and advancement of a really good sport fishery (muskies) as important as the natural order of evolution? And again, I'm just playing devil's advocate here.

I don't think people realize the drastic effects we've caused. I wonder if people will feel the same about invaders when (not if, but when) the asian carp show up in the great lakes. I think then we'll wish we'd have done a lot more to protect our waters.  For those who think this is the way nature has always been, you're more than a little off.

353733,Jonny,2009-06-19 23:45:00,1380," Well in the case of the muskie fishery, we've already messed with the natural progression, as I understand it, by creating  a fish-navigable waterway where before there was none (not to mention the changes to the system caused by human habitation and effluent, and artificial water levels, and human harvest of fish). After a certain point, things aren't particularly ""natural"" any more --- not in the sense of what would have been there if the area had been left untouched. So it becomes a ""managed"" area."
