Usually how it goes is a local marina will get a good buy on some and unless you live in the area you tend to have a hard time finding out ! haha  I was just wondering if any of you OFC'ers know of a good deal on a 1448 Jon boat any where right now ??? Old stock or anything like that.... maybe your local dealer has one, or a few !  My buddies dad boat an all welded 1448 Tracker Jon boat for about $1700 brand new !!!! Thats a steal. He got it from Hully Gully last year... aparently they bought a wack load of them when the dollar was strong and then blasted them out the door ! To bad I missed out ! haha  Thanks !"
