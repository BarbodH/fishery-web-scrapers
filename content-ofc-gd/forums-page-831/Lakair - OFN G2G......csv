We are wondering who will be interested in having meals in our dining room. This is important for us to know in order that we can plan ahead and have the right amount of food on hand.  Breakfast ($8.00) is eggs with bacon/sausage or pancakes or French toast any combination.  Packed lunches ($12.00) include a couple of really good sandwiches, homemade cookies? Fresh fruit, chocolate bars and/or chips and something to drink.  Dinner meals ($25.00); fixed menu -  includes salads, main course, desert (home made pies?) and non-alcoholic beverages. You are allowed to bring your own wine/beer if you like.  Please email us ([emailÂ protected]) if you plan on having meals and let us know your requirements. We need to know #of persons and what meals.   Many thanks,   the cap't."
