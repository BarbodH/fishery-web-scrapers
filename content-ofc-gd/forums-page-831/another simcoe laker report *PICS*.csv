I allowed myself some sleeping time and was on the water for 9am.  I started in 72 feet of water and caught 7 perch, it still boggles my mind how deep they get sometimes.  Made a move to 86 feet of water and marked a bunch of fish right away.  They were not interested in any of my offerings.  I tried spoons, tubes, and badd boys to no avail.  Moved again to 94 feet and dropped down a fluke on a 3/8 oz jighead, I immediately had a fish chase me up to 40 feet and drop back down, then a new streak ripped up the graph and  i set the hook on my first laker of the day.  I landed 4 more in 40 minutes, and then the action died for me.  I fished for another 2 hours with nothing but herring, so I put my rods away and went scouting for opener.  I found a lot of empty nests, but saw some big fish cruising up shallow.  Man 8 days seems like an eternity!!!!  Ahh, the joy of taking pics by myself ... i've got to work on this lol.      "
