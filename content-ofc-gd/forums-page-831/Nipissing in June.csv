351925,jdmls,2009-06-14 16:55:00,575,nice fish dude .. I miss that lake
351929,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-14 17:16:00,3761,"Great multi-species trip you guys. Your brother knows how to catch the giants eh! Also love those white bass and the sunset pictures, but um...why did you do that rod shot thing I invented lol (joking).  Great report and pictures!   Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
352118,kickingfrog,2009-06-15 12:48:00,8333,"  Trout Lake is great.  Nipissing can be a challenge even in a large boat sometimes, other times it can be a paddlers dream. The South Bay area has more islands that offer some protection from the wind.  I use only scented plastics on my harnesses. That and some jigs with a few different plastic bodies is all some people ever use on Nipissing, and they do quite well."
352151,Trevor0179,2009-06-15 14:52:00,65,NICE FISH ALL AROUND GOOD REPORT

353441,kickingfrog,2009-06-19 02:55:00,8333," Ya, thanks Marty.  The PFD under the clothes doesn't help, but while my wife lost her baby weight, I seem to be finding more and more."
351484,kickingfrog,2009-06-12 20:19:00,8333,"My brother and I made it up to Nipissing for our annual trip that is getting harder and harder to pull together every year.  We had heard it all.. the water is high, the water is cold, the spring was cold, the fish aren't bitting, the fish have disapeared...      Too bad, we're fishin'  We like to use controlled drifts to find the walleye and determine their ""mood"". This year we did not have much wind and what wind we did have was from the north east most of the time.  First fish of the trip... a white bass, I've never caught one before in Nipissing.   Second fish... 2nd ever white bass I've seen caught in Nipissing. Little bigger, they both tasted just fine.   We got into a few walleye drifting crawler harnesses. Chartreuse blades landed the most. Slot fish 22 inches   21 inches   An eater     My brother finally getting into the action, slot fish.   I had been giving him a hard time because he had been using live worms on his harness and I was using power worms. That stopped however...   28 inches    Biggest walleye either of us has caught in Nipissing. It swims on.  The next day Jim caught a small drum, and wanted to clean and eat it. Very subtle flavour, we'll be eating more of them to fill-out the walleye frys.   More slot fish.       My brother got another hog. This time on a live chub minnow.  27 inches   Another eater, we only caught 3 fish under the slot. The 2 over went back into the lake.   Lone pike caught this trip.     Tough fishin', but the 2 biggest walleye we've seen caught in Nipissing, and the highest average inches for a trip. Fish were caught on crawler harnesses, jigs with gulp alive and a Salmo jigging minnow, and my brother got most of his with chub minnows.            Thanks for taking the time."
351488,Roy,2009-06-12 20:28:00,13728,WOW!!! Some excellent fish there Rob! Congrats to you and your brother. Thanks for taking the time to post of your adventure.
351490,Ron,2009-06-12 20:32:00,1683,"Looks like you had an excellent time up there Kicking Frog.  Some nice hogs to hooked into as well.  Cheers, Ron..."
351495,glen,2009-06-12 20:52:00,2641,WTG Rob.  Nice job on the big eyes.
351497,Joey,2009-06-12 20:52:00,9122,"Awesome, what a great trip.  Looks like you dialed into those pickerel big time  Great photos too!!!  Joey"
351500,Nippissinger,2009-06-12 21:00:00,53,Nice catche kickin frog... You and Bro really jacked up some nice eyes.... Looks like a niceweekend of fun fishin... Thanx for the report and especially the pics...  We are pic hoes in here...LOL  Will
351502,ozaibak1,2009-06-12 21:08:00,401,"Holy crap, nice report! Those walleye look tasty! Guess that report puts down all the Nippissing naysayers for a little while, the weather sure seemed like it was ideal though."
351506,bigugli,2009-06-12 21:31:00,6138,Despite a slow bite you still got some prime fish. A slow drift has always worked well for me on Nipp.. this time of year.   WTG
351509,Forester,2009-06-12 21:38:00,46,
351511,Cudz,2009-06-12 21:41:00,2652,Nice Work Rob and Bro. You guys did good!
351553,johnnyb,2009-06-13 00:54:00,3413,"WOW those are some beauties!!! Very well done!  I love the look on your brother's face in that first shot of the 28 incher... ""NOW whaddyou think of my live bait? Hmmm??!!!  """
351556,Flappn,2009-06-13 01:03:00,245,Wow some real nice fish there. Guess that wasn't last Saturday as we where up there and we faced gail force winds..so it seemed. We couldn't get out till 7 at night.  Nice haul!!
351640,Greencoachdog,2009-06-13 10:42:00,8163,"Excellent report, pics, and fish Rob!!!  Is that the West Arm?  Your canoe looks somehow... bigger!"
351641,b2kptbo,2009-06-13 10:47:00,1505,"Thats some good fishing Rob, WTG..."
351644,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-06-13 11:08:00,1362,"Nice eyes, pics and report!!....thanks for sharing!!"
351647,Spiel,2009-06-13 11:24:00,9065,You're not making the next two weeks any easier Rob.
351661,solopaddler,2009-06-13 12:28:00,8605,Great job those are some really nice walleye!
351666,kickingfrog,2009-06-13 13:32:00,8333," I still don't know how to post multiple quotes.  Actually we prefer more wind/waves because my uncle's boat is not suitable for trolling, so quick drifts are our only way to cover water effectively, but we did alright and did get those two big ones just not as many as we would have expected."
351667,kickingfrog,2009-06-13 13:36:00,8333,  Ya is wasn't any easier sitting in the boat either...smug son of a gun. Second one didn't help at ALL! At least I ended up with a few more than he did.
351670,kickingfrog,2009-06-13 13:44:00,8333," No, my Uncle's place place is on the south shore a few small bays west of the Waltonian Inn.  My Uncle's boat has a few more horsepower than my canoe, but only half as reliable  . My brother is more than a 100lbs bigger than me as well, so the two of us haven't been in the same canoe at the same time for 20 plus years."
351671,kickingfrog,2009-06-13 13:47:00,8333, Tell me about it. I didn't want to leave.
351694,Scott S,2009-06-13 17:05:00,203,Nice fish Rob!!  My brothers and I just got back from Callander. The weather sucked but will still managed some fish out at gautier's bay. We didn't get many in the slot and the bigest was 21inches. Look's like all the big fish are still in the south shore area. The nippising jig in orange and chartruse was the hot lure. Scooter
351708,blarg,2009-06-13 20:01:00,289,"Nice fish there, I caught a couple about 22-23 ins yesterday and another about 20, im catching more big fish than anything on Nipissing this year."
351739,Black_Blade,2009-06-13 23:25:00,258,"Really nice fish!  Just moved up to North Bay and was wondering where some good spots to try.  I just have my 14 foot Sportspal with a 3 HP, wasn't too sure about taking it out on Nipissing, after seeing how fast the wind can pick up out there.  Have never caught a walleye...so using a worm harness is good, by the looks of it, lol...I have Gulp natural crawlers, they seem to to do well in many other applications, would they work?  This slow drifting you speak of, is that accomplished with electric trolling motor?  If so, I'll have to wait for a bit on that...lol.  Any pointers welcome tho...love it up here, Trout Lake looks awesome too and all the string of lakes connected down to Mattawa!"
351761,Nippissinger,2009-06-14 01:22:00,53,"Hey Black Blade,  Moving to North Bay is a good thing...Especially if you like to fish...  The Nipper is one of the Best multi species lakes to fish...  The harness or the ever popular 1/4 jig tipped with live bait is a surefire stinger for the Nippising predators.  Slow drifting is basically just open water drift with no power. You can use the electric if you like, I prefer to find the drop offs then start a dead drift in the deep up onto the flat...They will nail you every time if they are there.  A sonar really helps get you to the fish quicker...  Nice hookin' Rob and Bro, and thanx for the fish porn...  Will"
