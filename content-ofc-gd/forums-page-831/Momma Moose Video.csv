Fished in and around Cache Bay again for a couple of days with only one pike to show for it.  The water temperature was much higher than 2 weeks earlier having gone from the high 50's to the low 70's according to my fish finder.  Also saw about a million decaying minnow remains in the water.  I'm not sure how close you are to the area or if you've fished it during the past week, but I sure would be interested in your views if the pike have moved out to deeper and cooler water or if the bite was just off.  yakpiker"
