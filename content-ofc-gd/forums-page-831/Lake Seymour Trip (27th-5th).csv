Hopefully I'll do as good as i did last year, maybe catch a bigger Gar Pike at my little spot and another big bass like i did last year. Just would like to know some info on the water conditions out there, how are the weeds, waters levels high? anything that may hamper or be good to know for my trip.  Going to be bringing my little inflatable to fish just off out past the docks(don't want to voyage too far out lol) so if the bite is slow off the several docks i'll try that. As always, I'll set up a report and hopefully a nice bass for Team 4!   Thanks for any info guys, I'm pretty excited!
