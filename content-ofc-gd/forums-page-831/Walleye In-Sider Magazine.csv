353193,Headhunter,2009-06-18 12:54:00,5703,"I have been a subscriber of this magazine for a number of years. Yesterday in the mail, I received notice that Walleye In-Sider Magazine will no longer be published. I can't say I'm surprised, as the magazine is so closely tied to the former, now defunct PWT. In place of my regular subscritption, I will now be receiving a regional edition of Game and Fish magazine. I won't comment on that mag,. as I have never seen it. I'll let you know my thoughts upon arrival. Just thought I'd pass the news along! HH"
353202,Mike Pike,2009-06-18 13:27:00,1332,The danger of extinction is always present when you 'over specialize' like a magazine that focuses on pro walleye tourneys.  Hopefully we'll see the writers and photographers re-surface in other publications and enjoy their work there.  I love fishing mags!
353413,superdad,2009-06-19 01:42:00,353,"I guess that leaves the FLW - Walleye magazine and The Next Bite as sources for walleye info.  That's what happens when a big fish takes over a small fish - after a while it disappears also.  Sorry to see Walleye In-Sider go, have a LOT of back issues, inlcuding many in the original newspaper format, May have to hang to them a llittle while longer.  Cheers"
353460,Cudz,2009-06-19 03:57:00,2652,That is odd. I too subscribed to the Walleye In-Sider mag and I too got the little white notice in the mail.  What is odd is that I will be receiving the In-Fisherman magazine until my sub runs out. Is that what you were offered?
353528,Headhunter,2009-06-19 13:14:00,5703,"The paper I received indicated I would be getting ""Game and Fish"" magazine... although I would rather get In-Fisherman as a consolation. I have recently recieved an In-Fisherman in the mail, I thought it was just a promotion... oh well, we'll just see what shows up! HH"
353534,doubleheader,2009-06-19 13:30:00,497,"What was a few years back a really informative magazine went on a steady decline until it was almost just one big Berkley advertisement. I cancelled my subscription a couple years back, but hold on to those older editions because the information is still valid and the magazines themselves may be worth a few bucks some day."
353547,bigbuck,2009-06-19 14:06:00,2449,"Unfortunately, there is not much new material in the 'Insider' mags, most of it is rehashed from InFisherman. I don't buy the magazines any longer on a regular basis."
353551,Billy Bob,2009-06-19 14:22:00,5865,"For me all the magazines are just rehashing over old stuff..........not much more can be said about a fish after all these years. At one time I use to subscribe to In-Fishermen and still have many back issues. Now I don't even pick one up to look at when I pass the magazine rack in a store.  I also find most fishing shows BORING as the market is watered down with it, especially now that most shows are just a info commercial........"
353592,kickingfrog,2009-06-19 18:12:00,8333,SON OF A GUN! I just signed-up for a subscription on-line a few weeks ago.  I have not had any correspondence from the company at all.  I hope I get the regular In-Fisherman a fall-back. I'll have to check the difference in rates.
353651,bigugli,2009-06-19 20:27:00,6138,"Fishing magazines have come and gone over and over. How many new twists to the same story can one have? How often does a magazine turn into nothing more than a giant advert. After all, the first rule of journalism. 'We don't sell news. We sell advertising'. Once that magazine gets that old/tired image, the readership drops and so does revenue. Over time it is hard to keep it fresh and interesting. With a pissy economy, and an abundance of rags out there, articles have to reflect the advertising dollar.  If my big dollar comes from Shimano, I'm not going to do a feature review on Quantum reels. Nor would you rip apart Shimano product. You lose the revenue right quick.  Same difficulties for the TV shows. Too many"
