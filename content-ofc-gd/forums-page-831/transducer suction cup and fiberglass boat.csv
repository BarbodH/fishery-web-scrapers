Eventually we duct taped it to the bottom of the hull and it did give us depth, but you can't get temp that way. Is there anyway of keeping a suction cup on fiberglass, or do I need to bring up c-clamp and rig something up?"

Get it good and dry and get a hard piece of plastic or aluminum, something smooth that will hold a suction.. Have it a little larger then the suction cup, and get some 3-m double sided tape, and dry the hull well and even clean it with some rubbing alcohol, and stick the base with the tape to the boat, and hold presure for about 30 seconds. and you should be good to go, stick on your suction cup and away you go.  Bascially same thing is the flat plastic disc that comes with GPS's so you can stick it to your dash and stick the suction cup to it.. So if you can find one of those discs they come loaded with the tape and your good to go.. Just don't expect to remove the disc later lol. You can but will have to replace the tape."
