353801,Sinker,2009-06-20 03:11:00,8692,"I'm from the northern peninsula. I don't know where to go where your going?? You can get lobsters most anywhere though. Shouldn't be a problem. Best way is live off the boat, boiled in real salt water on an open fire right on the beach!! You'll need a BIG pot  DON'T FORGET THE SCREECH!!!!  Sinker"

Last year I did a road trip out west to BC and it was fun.  If you have never done the road trip it's something you MUST do atleast once.  Oh by the way the once you leave ontario the prairies are so boring and flat.  Hopefully, going to Newfoundland by car would be a blast."
