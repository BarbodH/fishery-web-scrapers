353002,Spiel,2009-06-17 21:03:00,9065,"Why were you Googling ""Lake Nipissing Girls"" in the first place? What were you hoping to find?  Inquiring minds want to know."
353011,Terry,2009-06-17 21:30:00,14456,"LOL, now how did that happen   Lake Nipissing Girls google link click here"
353026,Roy,2009-06-17 22:15:00,13728,"Yep, the site's looking good Kevin and Leslie. Congrats on that.  There are at least two pics of OFC gatherings used as page headers. The one in Terry's link is the very first OFC Lakair gathering. It was dubbed the Crayola Invitational undoubtedly because of the presence of so many colouful characters. The other header where we're pictured on the dock is a newer pic......probably 4-5 years ago as I see TNT (Todd) in there.  Good memories.  edit:  I must add that the biggest surprise of that first gathering was the unexpected appearance of Spiel. He and Marty hit it off real good! There were even bears up there then banging on vans. I didn't witness too much of that though as I was busy and tied up."

353272,Beans,2009-06-18 18:44:00,3339,"Better not let Leslie catch you surfing the net for ""Nipissing"" porn sites or you might find yourself having shore lunches over on that rock island alone...  Just kidding Kevin..."
