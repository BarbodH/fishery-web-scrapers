639715,solopaddler,2011-11-13 13:48:00,8605,"The last week has been pretty special. I've been rolling up the km's on the odometer travelling both north and south in search of steelhead.  I've been having a blast with fish just hammering hardware with a ferocity I've never before experienced.  I had two fish recently destroy my Spro snap swivels on the strike, opening them up and making off with my lure.  On another occasion I had 3 fish in the 10lb class rush in right to my feet before one sped up and smashed my lure almost stopping my heart in the process.  Fish have been caught floatfishing and bottom bouncing as well. If you're not being versatile you're missing out on fish.  Speaking of floatfishing some guys on another board I frequent were recently touting the virtues of Berkley Nanofil as mainline so I gave it a shot.  Let me tell you this stuff is incredible! It's a super line, so zero stretch but is not a braid. It's perfectly round and has this slippery almost slick finish. Casts like a dream.  Best thing from a floatfishing perspective it floats! On a windy day on a long drift I had my entire mainline blow off the water.  Obviously hooksets and mending are greatly enhanced as well.  Check it out, I think you'll be impressed!  Anyhow, here's just a few more from my recent outings. I'm still waiting for a buddy to send me pic's of a thick 38"" beast that's high teens minimum, maybe bigger.                  "

639722,GBW,2011-11-13 14:12:00,8460,nice fish man! I have nanofil on one reel and so far so good.  Just watch the line for knick's.  I bib land a PB musky on #12 nanofil tho...
639723,Musky or Specks,2011-11-13 14:15:00,2710,Good stuff Mike Almost makes me want to start steelheading again and then I regain my senses
639724,rocheleauc,2011-11-13 14:30:00,205,awesome report! last two fish are monsters
639726,corvette1,2011-11-13 14:34:00,1765,awesome mike
639730,mercman,2011-11-13 15:02:00,7054,"Mike, you are an incredible writer, and an even more incredible angler.Nice fish and as always, great report  Thanks  Paul"
639732,spinnerdoc,2011-11-13 15:08:00,556,"I'll second that....Damn  Mike i just love reading your well written reports, they are simply full of information and inspiration to get out there and fish. Of course i love the fish pics as well"
639733,Moosebunk,2011-11-13 15:09:00,3970,"You are hammerring them Mike.  And I bet whichever store owners whom carry that spoon, are greatly appreciating the business.  Fine steelheading.   You try the P-Line snap/swivels?  They've served me well for strength in smaller size."
639740,solopaddler,2011-11-13 15:31:00,8605,"Thanks gents, glad you enjoyed the porn.     Can't imagine anything being stronger than Spro, but I'm open to suggestions. I'll give them a shot bud, thanks."
639900,Paulus,2011-11-14 02:54:00,522,"Glad to have been one of your spectators, bud, but even happier to have had a chance to experience one of those strikes. It was literally like hooking into a train going the other way   !!!  Can't wait to see the pic of that 38 incher  p.-"
639963,solopaddler,2011-11-14 10:30:00,8605,"  That's so ironic. That's pretty much exactly what Aaron Shirley said when we were out LOL!  I think he said it was a bus though, not a train."
639982,Fish Farmer,2011-11-14 13:22:00,2234,"Beauty catch Mike.  , I can see Spiel's fingers twitching now."
639985,Harrison,2011-11-14 13:44:00,2202,"Awesome Mike!! I tried this for a couple hours out this way on the weekend.  Nadda, but there is some other water I'll give it a go this week.  Thanks for sparking something different for me to give a go."
639988,Eazy,2011-11-14 13:55:00,260,
639993,msp,2011-11-14 14:34:00,1336,Nice job on the steelies. I like that spinning reel with the short wide spool. What type is it ?
639995,Harrison,2011-11-14 14:40:00,2202, It is a US Reel.  http://www.usreel.com/products/SpinningFeatures.aspx
639998,asdve23rveavwa,2011-11-14 14:52:00,2690,"Great stuff, Mike!!! Hoping to get out this weekend for some more chrome. That spoon looks an awful lot like a Moonshine...one of the ""oldtimers"" at a spot I like to frequent started using them this year."
640002,fishindevil,2011-11-14 15:32:00,6254,some brutes there for sure mike !!!   awesome report & pics too..
640028,4x4bassin,2011-11-14 17:48:00,1025,"Very nice Mike , makes me want to dust off the rainbow gear and get out there."
640030,solopaddler,2011-11-14 18:00:00,8605," I'm sure I don't have to tell you, but out your way you've got to scale everything down and slow down the presentation. Out your way I'm partial to micro sized Kwikfish and Flatfish and spinners no bigger than a #2.    Phil already answered the question, it is indeed an SX series US Reel. It's a true longcast spinning reel.  Decent reel, not overly expensive....but...the drag needs to be tweaked if you're using it for steelhead.  I've switched out the stock washers in mine with some leather and felt to improve performance.  For any other fish the stock drag is just fine, but these steelhead are hitting so hard and violently that the drag needs to be absolutely butter smooth.  Another similar reel that's also decent for the purpose is the Pfleuger Arbor.  If I'm not mistaken Phil has them on sale in his online store.  Been meaning to order one from etackle.ca myself to give it a whirl."
640109,ccmtcanada,2011-11-14 23:37:00,7971,Another great report Mike!  I haven't hit the creeks nearly as much as I'd like....hoping to change that soon.  I haven't landed one in over a year....can't catch them from my living room tho. Lol  Some real tanks there Mike!
