639525,Cookslav,2011-11-12 15:39:00,1457,Is it worth my time to fish Quinte in 30km south winds...  I am getting some mixed reactions and am curious to hear what the lot of you say. The next 3 days are forecast with winds of 30km hour and I'm told The bay is a bit dicey.   I've seen her in 40km winds and I didn't bother to launch...but those were north winds. Any advice is appreciated...I just don't want to drive for hours only to turn around because of conditions.

If you  get into Hay Bay the wind tends to be a little less agressive there too.  If you are staying over night then fish picton harbour at night.  The Adolphus Reach and Long Reach are the areas where high winds make it nasty.  Good luck I would say go for it!!!!!!!!!!!

But if you aren't able to really pick your days you gotta go when you gotta go.  Eastly weather this season has really slowed things down twice for me this season.  Try and pick calm... during a season that is tough enough for numbers, being able to have perfect boat/board/lure control certainly will help."
