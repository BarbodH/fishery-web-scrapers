Last year we had to fight the 30 to 40 km winds and it took us two days to get our first fish. There was 6 of us and everyone caught fish, just not the numbers from the previous years there. I caught only one fish in 4 days but it was the biggest of our group at 12.4 lbs which was released unharmed.  Four yrs ago my buddy and I landed 24 fish in 4 days with the smallest being 10.4 and the largest weighing in at 13.3lbs. I am pumped and ready to go I just got a order of new baits in last week. A half dozen new tail dancers and about 25 new reefrunners. For me the tail dancers have put the largest fish in the boat for the last 4 years in a row."
