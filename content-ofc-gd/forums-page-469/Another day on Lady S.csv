Poor peanut was going stir crazy cause we had not put any victims in the boat for her to chew on. Finally met Photoz, but he didn't stay long. Must have been experiencing the same poor luck. By 1, we had finally got a steady bite. Lots of dinks to keep peanut happy, and a steady supply of decent fish. Even so it was a soft bite. Most of the larger perch kept getting unbuttoned close to the boat. All in all, Steve and I had a nice day on the water, under beautiful sunny skies."

Peanut must have put on a couple of miles running from one end of my boat to the other...bet she slept well during the car ride home  Thx for a good day again my friend.
638234,Rizzo,2011-11-07 23:32:00,4754,hey at least it was a gorgeous day even if the fishing was hit and miss
640164,bigugli,2011-11-15 01:48:00,6138,Finally found where I left the camera.  Peanut was oh so happy when we finally started to catch some fish.   When the little thief gets her paws on a perch it will be beheaded and disemboweled in all of 30 seconds. THen she leaves the remains at your feet to dispose of the evidence.
