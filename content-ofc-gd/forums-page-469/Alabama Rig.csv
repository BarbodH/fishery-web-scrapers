639446,ah_long,2011-11-12 00:36:00,354,"Seems like it's all the fire now, anyone have first hand experience with the rig?  and how many hooks are we allowed in Ontario?  for those who never heard  The Alabama Rig  seems like 4 hooks is the max in Ontario  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165347.html "
639459,JCRG,2011-11-12 01:26:00,57,"Saw this in an FLW tourney. Crazy stuff, don't know what the regulations are on this kind of setup"
639466,ah_long,2011-11-12 02:02:00,354,i think the only regulation would be how many hooks you're allowed on one rod... so basically you could have 4 bait on hooks and one decoy if the reg says 4 hooks max
639480,dnb_cbr,2011-11-12 03:51:00,61,This looks like more fun 
639481,Gregoire,2011-11-12 03:52:00,1397,"It seems like you could run this rig as long as you are only running baits with single hooks, spinner baits or jigs. I don't think crankbaits would be allowed, unless they were those new sebile snag proof single hook ones."
639484,ah_long,2011-11-12 04:03:00,354, that's AWESOME
639492,Handlebarz,2011-11-12 11:24:00,3790,this is something we have been doing since I was a kid. I learned this from the older guys from Detroit that would come here fishing daily the stuff they used was not a nice looking but just made with fishing line but the same idea. I like the ideas that they have down there they can get creative.
639494,Roy,2011-11-12 11:42:00,13728,"Most of those poachers make them out of dollar store kitchen whisks. Alabama rigs...sabiki rigs....octopus rigs have all been used for decades. They're great for pail fillers and meat hunters. But hey, that's just my opinion."
639522,Handlebarz,2011-11-12 15:12:00,3790,"Roy your right there they would fill the pails with silver bass and head home but its fun has hell to have 2 16"" silver bass on the line. the most they used was 4 hooks here alot were three some were two. It would be neat to catch 4-5 LM on one at a time."
639537,ah_long,2011-11-12 16:43:00,354,"I actually think these would be awesome for smallies..  there are many times when you're fighting with a smallie, there would be a school following...  one smallie = a good fight two smallie = a very good fight three smallie = a very very good fight  and if you hit the jackpot with 4 smallies on the line, it would be an epic fight"
639592,Rod Caster,2011-11-12 23:01:00,5784," Hahaha 4 bass on the line. I can barely catch one. If I could do that with walleye, I would have my limit in one cast. This sounds like the type of rig that would make an angry angler  step on your gear."
639862,dada2727,2011-11-14 01:07:00,108,And for the low price of $75 a rig it can all be yours.......although I have seen some knockoffs for considerably cheaper.
