If anyone has done this to an older ford truck I could use a bit of advice...  How did you get the coils off the rear plugs? when you can get you're hand in there...  How did you deal with the fuel rail and ""sensor?"" attached to the fuel rail right above the 3rd plug on the driver side..  I could use any and all suggestions at this point... I only have 3 plugs left to go.  G"

639752,skeeter99,2011-11-13 18:25:00,109,can be done from the top u just have to work in tight spaces done it for quite a few buddies over the past  even the guys at the dealership do it from the top I witnessed it once but it was a older smarter mechanic

639770,Gerritt,2011-11-13 19:39:00,6129,it is an 2002... and I just cannot get my hands in there let alone a ratchet to pull the bolt holding the coil in place... and then I have to try and get ratchet extensions down to remove the plug... seems impossible!  any tips on removing the fuel rail on drivers side to remove those plugs? there is a sensor or regulator right over top of the third plug.... can I get in any trouble removing this rail? as it is connected to each cylinders fuel injectors.....  could use any and all advice right now.

639827,archer379,2011-11-13 23:23:00,277,there is no proplem removing the fuel rail just watch for the o rings there are 2 bolts on each side the hard part is if you have to remove the fuel lines that come into the fuel rail u need a little tool that slides over the line its a pain in the uknow. The 98 doesn't have the coil on the plug it has 2 coil packs so i can't really help with the removal.
