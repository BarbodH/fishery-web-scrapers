Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

639678,Old Man,2011-11-13 04:56:00,822,"As kids on the farm growing up, our rubber boots and the barb wire fences were always a bad mix. Parents would have been broke trying to keep us in new boots. They use to take ours into the local tire shop for patching. It wasn't uncommon to have 4 or 5 patches on a pair before you out grew them."

639711,GBW,2011-11-13 13:35:00,8460,and so you have been told I have a tube at home for just about anything because it works so well.
639775,Sinker,2011-11-13 20:09:00,8692,I like the goop a lot better than shoe goo. It will seal anything up. Goood stuff for sure!!  S.

639945,Moosebunk,2011-11-14 05:40:00,3970,Goop or Goo with little rubber patch.  The Red Green that sucka down with some duct tape just for coolness effect.  Any guy wearing duct tapes on his boots ain't no ice fishing poser.  That's fo' shnizzle!

640017,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-14 16:46:00,0,aquaseal works wonders on my waders...
640018,bare foot wader,2011-11-14 16:53:00,1354,"how long does the aqueseal last for you guys? I find it'll crack after a few seasons, never liked it  for on the water fixes i have the loon UV glue and light....works well enough to get through the day but not long term IMO"
