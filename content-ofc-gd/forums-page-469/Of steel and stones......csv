639904,ChrisK,2011-11-14 02:58:00,2772,Was a great weekend at the river. Love the colder temps this time of year which brings on my favorite of all stone fly bite . Last week the odd fish on stones but this weekend a complete change over to the little buggers. Others may have had some luck with various offerings but it was full bore for us and our stones.  The fish fought hard in the cold highly oxygenated waters many taking to the air and finding there freedom while others took to the depths only to find themselves looking straight into a camera before they made there escape back to the awaiting pools. Devon did well landing yet another personal best on his own hand tied stone fly.   The old man even got into a couple    There was another first this weekend as well that made me feel all fuzzy but that could of been the JD at work ?? The kid finally learned how to whip finish his fly's   . Sorry for the blurry shot but I was feeling pretty blurry when I took it  Looking forward to next weekend !!!

639940,Moosebunk,2011-11-14 05:21:00,3970,Cool little fly tying spot for the lad.  It's something he'll be glad he learned young and took with him through a lifetime of more steelhead and fishing.
639955,Remastered,2011-11-14 07:33:00,143, I guess you could say it's like rod length. Some people have that extra few inches.
639965,solopaddler,2011-11-14 10:41:00,8605,"Nice! March for the tiny winter blacks crawling all over the snow, and this hatch in mid-late November always produces good fish."
640011,ccmtcanada,2011-11-14 16:11:00,7971,Great to see you guys getting into the fish like that!!  Wish you were closer or I'd be there all the freaking time....  ....probably best it's not....LOL  Great job guys!
