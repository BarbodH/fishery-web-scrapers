638727,manitoubass2,2011-11-09 14:00:00,11391, Wednesday morning funny!   
638753,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-09 16:02:00,10439,I'm not worried as I'm sure they will turn this nasty 2 game losing spree around tomorrow against the Blues. But if not tomorrow Saturday for sure.
639144,Rod Caster,2011-11-10 21:32:00,5784,"I had a good time watching this thread develop so I'll revive it. We are missing are a few hahahabs fans and maybe a Vancouver rioter to really spark this thread to life.  Looks like Scrivens will get an opportunity to prove himself tonight... Goofstavsen is pretty scary in net, but I guess that's why they call him the Monster"
639149,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-10 22:03:00,10439,I was watching the telly last night and I happened upon a game. Seems the Ottawa team lost to the New York Rangers. Sorry about your loss Matt. Seems that's #4 in a row.  I sure hope the Leafs don't lose 2 more games in a row as then they would be just as bad as the Sens.  Here's hoping the Leafs extend your losing streak to 6 on Saturday (that is if you manage to lose to the Blues on Friday). If not we'll just start your next losing streak!!!    :rofl2:
639228,tb4me,2011-11-11 01:53:00,3295,Up 2-0 after 1...Kessel with #12 of the year...lookin good on the pp.. GO LEAFS GO!!!!! Insert beer drinking emoticon here..
639238,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-11 02:18:00,10439,  
639270,tb4me,2011-11-11 04:57:00,3295,lol funny..where did you find them...I didnt see them on the list
639275,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-11 05:10:00,10439,  Got em saved in my photobucket acct.
639276,manitoubass2,2011-11-11 05:48:00,11391,Both goaltenders tonight had some amazing stops!  Who else is looking forward to the Leafs vs. Ottawa on Saturday?
639483,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-12 03:56:00,10439,I wonder what happened to poor ole Matt? His sorry team lost another game tonight.   That would be a 5 game skid if'n you're counting.   Maybe your lads will get a win tomorrow against the Leafs.
639496,muskymatt,2011-11-12 12:55:00,2608,"  I'm here, and can take the lumps as good as I can give them  Yeah the sens are losing, as everyone expected them to this year, but not as bad as predicted ie. last place  It'll be an interesting game, but boy the laffs sure have turned it around since the 7-0 pounding and 12 GA in 2 games, should be clear sailing for them from here on in...  :rofl2:"
639508,Jer,2011-11-12 14:37:00,1426,  ...give em time....they'll get there.
639622,danc,2011-11-13 00:41:00,4677,Loved the hall of fame opening ceremonies tonight. Toronto puts on a good show. Here's to a great game tonight.
639651,muskymatt,2011-11-13 02:49:00,2608,"Bwahaahahhahahahahahhahaha......boo'd again, lose to the Sens bwahahahhaahaahahhaa.....score on their own net.....bwhahahahhahaa.....I said I could dish it as good as I caould take it........bwahahahahahahahahaa"
639659,muskymatt,2011-11-13 03:10:00,2608,"Hey, where did everybody go????  Bwhahahahahhahaahahahhaha"
639660,danc,2011-11-13 03:15:00,4677,  Leafs fan here Matt and all I can say is that I'm glad that I didn't get involved in this conversation. Congrats.
639661,manitoubass2,2011-11-13 03:17:00,11391,"+1 for musktmatt!  I'm a leafs fan, and I hate Ottawa, but it is what it is. Enjoy your bragging rights"
639667,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-13 03:29:00,10439,Ottawa deserved to win. They fore checked very well and their defence was awesome tonight. You couple that with some stupid penalties by the Leafs and you end up with an Ottawa win. Til next time!!!
639668,kickingfrog,2011-11-13 03:39:00,8333,Don't worry mm nobody is going to think differently about you. Although I'm sure most won't think of you at all and that is why the T dot is hated so much.
639902,Paulus,2011-11-14 02:57:00,522,Slowly coming back to reality now... 3 losses in the last 4...  Oh well... it was nice while it lasted.  p.-
637408,manitoubass2,2011-11-04 16:04:00,11391," Good point, their dead last in this category   "
637409,jughead,2011-11-04 16:05:00,92," Sens have about the same identity as the Leafs right now, young hard working team, both surprisingly higher in the standing than people thought they would be.  Sens much younger on D but much deeper in prospects there. Kessel and Spezza largely interchangeable although Spezza is better in his own end (now, not always and certainly not when he was Kessel's age) Spezza more consistent in putting up points historically.  Both teams have decent goaltending.  There really is very little difference in the two teams although the Sens have better prospects coming along. The biggest difference being the Sens are in the first year of a big rebuild and the Leafs are in the 6-7th year of a big rebuild."
637501,davey buoy,2011-11-04 22:17:00,5505,"There in first overall for the moment,let.s just have a moment silence:worthy:Best start in years,I hope they do well:clapping:"
637738,muskymatt,2011-11-06 01:23:00,2608,"hahaha Toronto fans are boooing the team,you call yourselves fans? Stands are empty...and tml are in first overall in years......lolololol....losing 7-0 to the Bruins.......it was only a matter of time for the bubble to burst and they go back to haw they always play...  :jerry:  :thumbsup_anim:  :clapping:"
637740,Grimace,2011-11-06 01:31:00,2020,"Welcome back Muskymatt.  Your timing matches your class.  Lol (joking).  To the guy that said the Sens have more prospects than the Leafs right now.  ------    Open your eyes.   The problem with the Sens right now is that they have no prospects.   None.  Zip, zilch, nada.  The Leafs will not finish first this year of course, but it is looking more and more like they are going to go into the playoffs.   Wouldn't that be nice, eh lads?  I predicted last year that they would finish 10th in the East.  I predict a 5th place finish this year (lofty, I know)."

637786,Rizzo,2011-11-06 12:17:00,4754, ...could mid season have started last night?
637795,muskymatt,2011-11-06 12:58:00,2608,"    I have to agree with this comment    the leafs peel off a couple wins (like every start to the season) and all the so called fans (who even boo them when they are in first place) think it's cup time again (like usual), then they crash (since1967) and play brutal hockey (and the so called fans leave early)until they (at seasons end)put together a couple panic games, and get enough wins to miss out on the draft.  Then the rebuild talk starts.....(Groundhog day)  "
637812,lhousesoccer,2011-11-06 14:10:00,442,.
637815,muskymatt,2011-11-06 14:19:00,2608,"  lol....actually, I'm quite proficient in math.....it's understanding leaf fans that has me stumped!!!    "
637819,kickingfrog,2011-11-06 14:25:00,8333," Please provide an example of these ""so called fans"" overt enthusiasm.  BTW the centurions are not only headed for a ruff few season on the ice, but off it as well. Their so call fans have stopped showing up at the arena, so enjoy them while you got 'em."
637820,Jer,2011-11-06 14:36:00,1426,"Always lotsa fans in Ottawa for a Leaf game, they just happen to cheer for the visitors.  I guess in Ottawa they cheer a 7-0 loss, rather than boo..."
637831,muskymatt,2011-11-06 15:37:00,2608," TSN...quote:  ""This is how they thank a first place team in Toronto""  while playing the game tape showing the empty seats and booing loudly....  It was watched by all viewers, not just me,,  Jer....in Ottawa we always cheer a 7-0 laff loss...  "
637832,muskymatt,2011-11-06 15:49:00,2608,  Good one Terry  :clapping:
637942,John Bacon,2011-11-07 01:32:00,3277, Isn't that the opposite of overt enthusiasm?
637952,Grimace,2011-11-07 02:31:00,2020,"Yeah, your going to have to make up your mind Matt.  Are we overly enthusiastic or a bunch of deadbeat, ungrateful fans.  Your petty vitriol for the Leaf's speaks volumes about yourself.  I would be willing to wager that you are a former Leaf fan that now hates the organization for not giving you a winning team and hates the current fans because you see a weak and heartbroken version of yourself in them.   When the Leaf's finally start to succeed you will probably really start to crank up the vitriol for them as you will be devastated at that point, that you did not stick with them and have placed your hopes in a very lousy Senator team.  The next time you go to Local Heroes up there in Ottawa to take in the game, remember it is ok to break down.   You can cry, it feels good to cry.   Let it out Matt, just let it out man.  Bwahahaha."
637956,kickingfrog,2011-11-07 02:58:00,8333," That's what I thought, but I didn't ask nicely enough I guess.   Angry fans are loyal, apathetic ones just go away... or pick another team... and then another."
637969,fishinguypat,2011-11-07 06:17:00,547,Just wait until February when they are trying to get the 8th spot... seen it happen like this to many times before
637996,Rizzo,2011-11-07 11:59:00,4754," Houston we have a winner...good start, tank till they're last place or close to it, make a run in the last month or so to make it interesting, don't make the playoffs but get a worse draft position due to late season rally. This has been a common trend the last decade (except when they didn't own a draft pick they did not make the run to ruin said draft position). HOWEVER, I think this depressing cycle may be over. They will definitely hit the skids at some point, but they might just make the play-offs this time"
638022,muskymatt,2011-11-07 13:42:00,2608,"They deleted my additional comments in which I gave example  , I have to assume they will delete them if I post them again.  Nuff said, leafs suck, the bubble has burst, I can't wait to post on the next thread a leaf fan posts with a title like  ""WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEAFS, THEY STARTED OUT SO GOOD""  Even leaf fans have made reference to ""can Kessel keep up this pace?"" and many other questionables..... McArthur lol.....please....lol...you think this guy is going to be a consistent go getter. Penalty killing?  Just watching the results and fallout from the loss was entertainment at its best..  Spoken like a true pro eh Grimace  ,,,,40 yrs of breaking down and crying(as a leaf fan) can certainly qualify you to offer advice on just that!  :clapping:"
638024,muskymatt,2011-11-07 13:44:00,2608," What happened to ""Comprehension""? "
638046,Grimace,2011-11-07 14:42:00,2020, Lol.  Yep.   I saw a cartoon a while back in one of the papers the had a Leaf's fan handing his psychologist's business card to a Senator's fan.
638059,muskymatt,2011-11-07 15:01:00,2608, Now that's funny And probably somewhat true.
638662,muskymatt,2011-11-09 02:48:00,2608,So did anybody catch the score of the TML game tonight?  
638725,Jer,2011-11-09 13:55:00,1426,"  Just checked the standings...still in second place in the conference.  ...had trouble finding the Sens, had to scroll down underneath that bold line at the 8th spot."

637241,GBW,2011-11-04 00:42:00,8460,Let's not forget who the top two points leaders are right now too....  *edit for spelling cops *
637243,ccmtcanada,2011-11-04 00:48:00,7971,And they are up 4-1 in the second period...
637250,tb4me,2011-11-04 00:55:00,3295,"With Kessel and Lupal 1 and 2 in NHL scoring and Scrivens playing the way he does tonight, the future is brighter then ever for Leafers! All these points were getting now are points we dont have to get this spring. but we will anyway!  If the Leafs win tonight (and it looks as thou they will) they will be #1 in the east. oh and one last thing to say here...GO LEAFS GO BABY!!!!!!"

637256,tb4me,2011-11-04 01:09:00,3295,Good one Terry! Funny On a side note they took Liles's goal away from and gave Kessel his 11th goal of the season on a tip from Liles shot
637261,kickingfrog,2011-11-04 01:30:00,8333,"It's a long way to March, but being in first is better then anything else."
637263,JDMITR,2011-11-04 01:31:00,12, Not only #1 in the East.  Leafs are #1 in the NHL as of now!!!
637265,skeeter,2011-11-04 01:33:00,1907,They did it!!!!!!!  And Terry:  
637267,Rizzo,2011-11-04 01:39:00,4754,"holy smokes...they MIGHT make the playoffs. Pretty sure they were in first place for a while last season as well...but this time it might be somewhat real. I was very happy to see Scrivens in net. Gustaffsaon is not even an adequate back-up. Leafs have been winning, but in spite of Gustaffsson, not because of him. This other guy tonight played far better than ""the monster"". Time to cut the losses on that guy and move on, he is not a kid"
637279,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-04 02:26:00,4399, I think I could have scored on Mason tonite!!!

637281,otter649,2011-11-04 02:36:00,118,Good time for coach Ron Wilson to try/attempt and get his expiring contract extended......
637286,johnl,2011-11-04 02:46:00,197,it is early but they are looking really good and its enjoyable to watch the games even their losses i'm not saying cup but at least some playoffs would be nice things are looking good for their future too go leafs go !
637288,Jds63,2011-11-04 03:02:00,1365,yes we were optimistic at the start of the season and it looks like things are staying optimistic even with Reimer being out for a while  they didn't have 9 wins until December last year ....  they just need to stay healthy and keep all cylinders firing
637290,GBW,2011-11-04 03:08:00,8460,Burke already said a month or so ago he's looking to extend it.
637295,ccmtcanada,2011-11-04 03:22:00,7971,"I am a die hard Leaf fan....always have been.  Some of the best memories of my childhood are watching games with my dad.  I loved Peter Puck in the first intermission and if I begged he'd let me stay up for Showdown and the third period.  That being said, I am also a realist....I don't have delusions of the cup, but high hopes for playoff action...  Go Leafs go!"
637318,jughead,2011-11-04 08:56:00,92,"I'm a die hard Sens fan living in Toronto but happy the Leafs are doing well and equally happy the Sens are rolling pretty well even though they are in the first year of a massive rebuild and icing 8 rookies some nights. Leafs took way way longer than they should have for a rebuild but seem to be in a good position finally.  The battle of Ontario has actually become fun to watch again.  Also great to see the Oilers rolling, far and away the most enjoyable team to watch in the league this year."

637331,Rizzo,2011-11-04 11:57:00,4754, hard to rebuild without draft picks. At least Phil the Thrill is showing glimpses of why they gave up a huge price to get him. Not his fault Burke built a crap team and thought he had a contender
637350,Whitemikeca,2011-11-04 13:01:00,138,  SSHHHHHH!  Don't jinx it!  I have tickets for the Boston game on Saturday.  I can't wait to go to a game and actually be proud of this team.  Its been so long.

Right now though they are playing some exciting hockey, and thats nice to see. Dion looks real good too, which is a major plus"
637401,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-04 15:52:00,10439, I'm more worried about their poor penalty killing.
