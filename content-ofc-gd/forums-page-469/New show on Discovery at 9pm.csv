639470,Rod Caster,2011-11-12 02:28:00,5784,Make that noodling for musky and we are talking real entertainment!
639474,rocheleauc,2011-11-12 02:55:00,205, I'd pay to see that LOL
639475,mercman,2011-11-12 02:57:00,7054,  Musky taunting tournaments
639534,HTHM,2011-11-12 16:27:00,4082,"""Now go away or we will taunt you a second time""   "
639582,highdrifter,2011-11-12 21:50:00,2534,By gawd u whatch an appalling amount of TV!!
639611,mike rousseau,2011-11-13 00:20:00,4661, I wouldn't wish that on anybody...  Wha.... That would suck... Crippled for life...
639616,Rod Caster,2011-11-13 00:30:00,5784,  ...you know the chained gloves they use to feed sharks?
639618,mike rousseau,2011-11-13 00:36:00,4661, That would help...  A single musky tooth can send you for stitches... Can't imagine what a mouthfull would do...  Well... I guess it would look like a big sucker after a musky chewed on it for a bit... I know what that looks like... Lol   Ouch
639620,Rod Caster,2011-11-13 00:38:00,5784,  Good comparison... anyone noodling for musky is indeed a big sucker.... for punishment!
639630,mercman,2011-11-13 01:23:00,7054,"well, they have every extreme sport you can think of. Musky noodling would definately seperate the men from the boys I bet it would draw a crowd too"
639633,Rod Caster,2011-11-13 01:31:00,5784,If I was in the musky-noodling crowd I would pre-dial 9-1  on my phone... those extra few seconds might save a few fingers.  Those cops on the show had MASSIVE shoulders eh? I wonder if FNA is built like a steam roller too.
639719,Musky or Specks,2011-11-13 14:07:00,2710,"I would never do it. I was working the fyke nets at Moon River one year in a musky spawning survey and we had a huge channel cat about 22lbs in the bottom of the net that we were having trouble getting out. Having just seen an episode on some fishing show about noodling I spoke up and volunteered to try it on this channel. It works, as soon as I got my hand in his mouth he chomped down and held on. Problem is they have vomerine teeth which is like 40 grit sandpaper all along their lips. Picture 20+ lbs of catfish clamped onto your knuckles suspended and thrashing around as you get him into the measuring board. My knuckles were bleeding and torn up pretty bad. Not medical emergency bad or anything but I certainly learned my lesson about noodlin...leave it to the hillbillies"
