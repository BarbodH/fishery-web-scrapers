Banana peel hits the water... Couple minutes later...musky   Another time in a friends boat... One of the guys had a banana...tossed the peel when he was done... Reeled in the musky Ross at the end of the troll... The banana peel managed to get hooked on the banana eaters lure...  Crazy...

Boated fish every trip this year to Quinte, we'll wait and see what happens at the G2G.  I've got a couple of ""lucky hats"" so I'm not too upset it one goes missing. Not really to superstitious but Lloyd is right about paying the fish gods on the big water...forgot to do that last weekend and Joe caught the fish.  Must have been my guiding and driving skills that help that to happen as well as no Terapoopa in the boat."
