The lake we are lucky enough to live on is beatiful and all, but is well known to be a challenging lake to fish...this year has been particularly 'challenging' with next to no fish from the lawn....not even a fall bite materialised this year.  It has been so bad on our lake out the front it has all but stopped me from even wetting a line there at all since the spring....which has allowed me to get a few other things sorted...so not all bad.   Anyway.....the ice needs to hurry up and get here so i can get into some fishes again, meanwhile we will just keep trying from our shore while we can, build snowmen and throw snowballs as high as we can!    NOT MANY FISH....BUT FUN TRYING  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/zOtVYwTZDes"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>    JACK'S FIRST SNOWMAN                                 HOW HIGH CAN YOU THROW A SNOWBALL?
