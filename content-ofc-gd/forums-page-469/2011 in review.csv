This year must rank first in my most productive year fishing. I got to travel far north out east and got onto the Kawartha's more than I ever get to. It was a fun year and all I can do now and work and count down the days until ice fishing begins!  Here are pictures from ice fishing at the start of this year.  Pike fishing was slow this winter only landing a few fish and having all of them be small they still are a fun fight   A Perch, got out with my dad a few times too thats always fun   And some more   Well the ice season was short lived with only a few trips out and mostly perch to show for it.  March came quick and my friend Gone Fishin and I got out one cold day onto Lake Ontario for some trolling action. With our first trip out I picked up my first brown, what a strong fish...still stunned at the fight it gave me.    After that I did some perch fishing off shore in Lindsay and a little blugill fishing like every spring until Pike opener in May. We got 10 Pike on our opening day on spinnerbaits. Here were my two nicer fish.    And another    After this very day it was only a few weeks from my leaving of Oshawa and onto the north. I worked as a guide at Kesagami Wilderness Lodge for the summer and loved it. Such a fun experience. I think I'll be back there again.  Here are some of my catch's during ""work"" on the water  A Big Perch haha, kinda rare up there   My first fish on the lake and even on my first cast of that silver minnow    O the cold temps in May/Early June   Another one of hundreds of walleye I caught   My PB Pike, a 37"" fatty   Once back from a summer of guiding I was chomping at the bit to get out bass fishing missing a few weeks of the season being up north. I was home for a week then gone to my summer haunt out in Leeds and the Thousand Islands bass fishing every day for 30 days this time around. With a little engine on my boat and a couple rods I was ready to do some damage. Still didn't find my 6lb largemouth but that's fishing. I'll catch her next year  First of the trip       Got to love my confidence bait.   The little bassin machine parked in it's spot   It took a week into August before I got into bigger than average size bass, starting with this 4lb range fish   Morning fishing   A little guy on the jig, that 20ft rock wall fishing I had success with the year before wasn't so good this time around. Only a few fish on the jigs on this camp trip.   My uncle convinced me to wake up for the first light fishing the last few days of the trip...I should of been doing it since day 1. In just 2 mornings I got two bass over 5lbs...next year I'll be up using that popper for all 30 haha    This was the first fish, it was a 5.0 on the scale. Caught it over 12ft of water close to the pads...the jumps this fish did was awesome   Another frog fish    Like I have had before I was fishing the frog really quickly past this thinner surface cover behind me and this nice pike blew up on the frog...covering water quickly gives some surprises sometimes   A day or so later that second largemouth yet again hit the popper. It was a 5lb 8oz...caught it on the same shoreline area...might of found a little morning hotspot    Another picture   And my last bass of that trip, I love going out there to visit family and just plain out relax for a while.   Once back home I got out onto some of the kawartha lakes for a few days on the water and even a little fishing tournament between a small group of boats. Had a great end of summer.  A nice 3-12 fishing docks. Was nice getting into a few nice bass once home from my topwater heaven   Next trip out we were faced with strong winds, and just the norm in cold front conditions and still had a great day bass fishing. Having approx 17 or 18lbs in out days biggest 5 bass  Here was my 5lb 2oz kawartha PB   2nd pic   Was a brute of a fight, caught this pig pitching a little jig.  After this I got out to Seymour for a tough day of fishing with a turnover. The weather was awesome I remember.    And since then not much fishing has been going on for me, tried for pike once and didn't get any. Think it's time to put the gear away and get ready for ice fishing...planning on making some big trips this year.  Thanks for looking guys,  MTBF"

I remember in the previous years your annual report is like a picture summary of all your reports throughout the year, and I would have already seen alot of them. Unfortunately I haven't been on OFC as much as of late but this is a nice way to catch up!"
