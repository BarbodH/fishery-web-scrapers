639614,mike rousseau,2011-11-13 00:27:00,4661,Hopefully I get a pic this time...  Last weekend I got a 9.6lb walleye and buddy took the pic with his finger over the lense...  I was so mad!!!!!!
639615,Skipper D,2011-11-13 00:29:00,1970,That would hurt alright ......... no pic .
639617,Rod Caster,2011-11-13 00:34:00,5784,"Nice day indeed. I was making sure that a bunch of diesel doesn't reach White River.... I'm glad it didn't, but I'd still rather be fishing the river. The pike and walleye are safe for now.  ..oh, and I have to drive by all them nice steelhead rivers between Marathon and Thunder Bay with no fishing rod...woe is me.  As a consolation, I get to watch the hockey game from the comfort of a Jacuzzi tub. Woe is me"
