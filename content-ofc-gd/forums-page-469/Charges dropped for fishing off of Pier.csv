639392,Ron,2011-11-11 20:40:00,1683,"Just an update for everyone.  I received a letter in the mail in regards to my fine for fishing in the Cobourg Harbour. They have dropped the charges as it is legal to fish where it is otherwise clearly posted.  However, the by law is under review and they are still potentially going to close the harbour to fishing.  I have a meeting set with OFAH in the following week to see if this is of interest to them as well. Once I have the meeting with OFAH, I will be setting a date to address the town council.  Cheers, Ron..."

639400,Terry,2011-11-11 21:07:00,14456,keep up the good work  I owe you a beer or something
639401,Handlebarz,2011-11-11 21:11:00,3790,Ron your one of a kind not many would do what your doing to just keep spots for kids to fish most are to busy in the own life to make time for others. I know your a very busy guy and dont know how or where you find the time for this stuff.  Keep up the good fight
639407,Musky or Specks,2011-11-11 21:46:00,2710,Don't know how a group without jurisdiction can close a harbor.
639415,Joey,2011-11-11 22:11:00,9122,"Excellent news Ron, keep up the good fight"
639432,Miracon,2011-11-11 23:13:00,200,Awesome Ron! Great perseverance!
639435,Fish Farmer,2011-11-11 23:25:00,2234,Don't give in Ron. Stick to your guns. We've had to may rocks thrown at us anglers. We need more like you to stand up and fight for whats ours I know I've had just about enough of Boat Launch Gouging  . Thinking of sending something to the OFAH Thanks
639577,Dabluz,2011-11-12 21:04:00,701,"Great news Ron.  Even though I'm in Quebec, this will still have some effect on fishermen's rights and I'm sure that your example will incite other fishermen across Canada to question other similar decisions made to limit the sport of fishing."
639905,Paulus,2011-11-14 03:00:00,522,"Awesome job, Ron. Thanks for representing us.  p.-"

639991,Harrison,2011-11-14 14:07:00,2202,"Good fight sir.  Would be nice to have a couple of those kids that were originally kicked off to join you at the town council meeting.  If you can't find'em maybe we could dress a few of us up if the need be.  Keep on, keeping on!"
640000,capt bruce,2011-11-14 15:26:00,820,"Just had a very very scarey thought , TJ and LEW dressed as the guitar player in ac/dc, beanys and all , holding Rons hand as he steps up to give his speach .  great work Ron we are losing so many  shore fishing spots ,soon only people with boats and deep pockets for launch fees will be able to fish most lakes ."
640074,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-14 21:25:00,655,Good stuff Ron. You're a good man.
640099,Ron,2011-11-14 22:53:00,1683,"Thanks everyone.  I had an ""on site"" meeting with representatives from OFAH today. It went very well. This is of great interest to them as well and are going to carry on with me to ensure there is fishing within the harbour of Cobourg! For anyone who is in fishing clubs, talk to your chair members to see if a letter of encouragement could be written up showing the positive reasons for having kids getting an interest in fishing. I think the town council has forgotten they were kids once too.  Cheers, Ron..."
640102,spinnerbaitking,2011-11-14 23:24:00,1622,"Great to hear & Best of luck to you, the more places for kids to fish the Better Thanx & Tight Lines SBK"
640106,Michael_Brown,2011-11-14 23:32:00,411,"The Rice Lake Fishing Festival and the Bridgenorth Winter Panfish Festival will be writing letters of support. With over 2000 kids attending our free events last year to enjoy fishing with their family and friends, I hope it means something to them. It is in everyone's interest to have our youth engaged in positive activities with their families instead of standing around a street corner or at home on a computer."
640108,Billy Bob,2011-11-14 23:35:00,5865,"Great Job Ron,  Remember, it's better to have kids hooked on fishing instead of drugs.   Bob"
640192,Moosebunk,2011-11-15 03:20:00,3970,A champion for other anglers.  Good stuff Ron.
