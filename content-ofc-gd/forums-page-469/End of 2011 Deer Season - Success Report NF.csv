639983,Leecher,2011-11-14 13:30:00,7832," Yes it is, riffle and bow... Looks like the deer population is out of control in your area    If you hunt... good luck harvesting"
639990,Daplumma,2011-11-14 13:58:00,1961,"  I do hunt here and the deer population is out of control here.I'm surprised that y'all have such and early and short season but I guess that is how they manage the herd.Congradulations of your score,gonna get some fine venison from that. Joe"
639992,Leecher,2011-11-14 14:10:00,7832," Thanks Joe!!!  The riffle season is short over here (first 2 weeks of November) If I was going bow hunt, I would have from mid September to mid October.  We also have doe draw but I haven't had the luxury of wining in a few years    but I keep applying  Thanks again Joe and wish you the best of luck in your hunt Jacques"
