638426,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 14:38:00,4661,  thanks roy...  but i give my business to cabelas and in return they take good care of me...  my issues with my humminbird are gunna be taken care of... they are even bending the rules for me by extending my 90 days so i can keep my sonar till ice up then send it back...  for reasons like this... ill pay a bit more here and there to show that im a loyal costumer with a long long and expensive order history...   unless they dont have what i want...
638429,Roy,2011-11-08 15:01:00,13728," Good that you're loyal Mike. So am I, I think. It's just that Cabela's doesn't carry muskie sizes. Not the kind I use anyhow."
638431,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 15:16:00,4661,  very true...  for 90% of my musky gear i stick to rollie and helens musky shop... they are fast and if there are issues with your order you get a phone call from an employee at the store to help choosing a substitute color or size...  between cabelas and the musky shop im very well treated and very well taken care of...  ive tried ordering from canadian stores... they just arent as good... ive been waiting 3 weeks for an order from pro tackle musky shop in bellville... cabelas or musky shop 4-5 days and usually cheaper prices as well as cheaper shipping
638435,Raf,2011-11-08 15:24:00,3495,I like replacing trebles on small cranks with appropriate size single siwashes.  Frees up the lures.
638444,Roy,2011-11-08 15:50:00,13728," That's something I don't take advantage of enough, Raf. I need to get into the habit."
638445,Harrison,2011-11-08 15:54:00,2202, Not all of them Mikie!
638464,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 16:30:00,4661,  sorry  i didnt mean to lump all canadian stores together...  i have experienced SOME quality retailers in canada... but like i said... my loyalty has been recognized and appreciated... and for the baits and gear i use... these are the stores for me...  also... i live on the canada usa border... so i ship to a ship it shop... so any orders under 75 bucks are tax free coming back across the border...  and shipping is very cheap within usa... usually $10 for $100 orders...
640051,mike rousseau,2011-11-14 20:28:00,4661,"well... i tried the triple grips last night...  you guys were right... ""when"" they hook a fish they grab deep...  but i missed half the hits i had... i was afraid of this due to the inward bend of these hooks...  im gunna give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that the fish were bumping the baits last night..."
640072,manitoubass2,2011-11-14 21:24:00,11391,"  That surprises me MM. I've landed walleye on these after very subtle hits, where as before I never would have boated half of those light hits.  Maybe it was just one of those nights??? Or if it continues, maybe try some minor changes to your hook sets. When I'm using cranks/stick baits etc, I find a reel set is the best method, at least for me.  "
640076,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-14 21:30:00,655,I've always switched out my hooks for Gamakatsu trebles because they are sticky sharp and I lose few fish on them.
640077,mike rousseau,2011-11-14 21:36:00,4661,  on the other hand i caught 4 walleye and a pike and my dad running stock hooks only got one... maybe he couldnt feel the missed fish... maybe i got more bites...  all the hits were very light last night... and i know after dark they dont hit the bullzeye every time...  they are very very sharp tho... pricked my fingers a couple of times and the fish that did get hooked were not getting off... they really grab deep in the flesh...
640079,manitoubass2,2011-11-14 21:39:00,11391,"  Yep, sounds about right.  I'll be using these trebles for quite sometime, they do work well.  "
638146,mike rousseau,2011-11-07 19:45:00,4661,the hooks on my walleye cranks take an absolute beating cause i literally drag the bottom with em sometimes...  i regularly have to change the hooks on my baits... i just ordered a pile of split rings and pliers... but im having a hard time deciding what trebles to buy...  im leaning towards ultra point cause they sound very durable... more specificaly the - mustad ultra point triple grip - trebles...  or do you use others that you would recomend?  thnx everyone...  again... these are for cranks only if that makes a difference
638152,mike rousseau,2011-11-07 19:57:00,4661,i dont want 2x strong cause the weight will throw off the action of my cranks...  but thanks for the triple grip vote...
638153,manitoubass2,2011-11-07 20:04:00,11391," Go with these. I started using them a few months back on my cranks and I really like them. They do hold up well, and I like to ""drag"" my cranks as well at times. These hooks reduce snags as well (they still snag, but a little less then conventional trebles). Your odds of landing fish go up abit as well, these hook really well.  If I have one complaint, its that they hook almost too well (if there is such a thing). If your trolling for walleye, you'll need the pliers on alot of fish.    "
638154,solopaddler,2011-11-07 20:08:00,8605,I switch out the hooks on almost all of my lures and I always put Owner trebles on them.  Great hooks.
638155,mike rousseau,2011-11-07 20:10:00,4661, i read a report where someone said the same thing... a hook that hooks too well... thats a good thing in my mind..... i get a lot of walleye bumping and tapping my baits... maybe these hooks will help turn those fish into caught fish....
638157,manitoubass2,2011-11-07 20:14:00,11391," It will help, for sure. I would def. use these hooks if your guiding, especially for those with less experience in landing big walleye and how to keep the pressure on.  The KVD ones work well also.  I got mine from lureparts and the price is good. Def. worth switching out your trebles if your gonna catch more fish  "
638159,myot,2011-11-07 20:18:00,131,The KVD hooks from mustad are some of the best I have fished   Dan
638161,Leecher,2011-11-07 20:21:00,7832,I use Excaliber on all my lures and this is my personal choice Leechman
638162,northernpike56,2011-11-07 20:23:00,717,"i like the mustad ones as well, replaced some of my cranks and spoons with them"
638166,manitoubass2,2011-11-07 20:40:00,11391, Those are VMC hooks if I'm reading you correct. The Sureset Treble I believe?   
638171,adolson,2011-11-07 20:51:00,783,"I was wondering the same thing as Musky Mike, so I'll pick up some of the Mustad hooks. I put some Eagle Claw trebles on a couple of my lures that needed new hooks, and they worked well... But nobody talks about Eagle Claw so I am guessing they're not very well-liked by more experienced fisherpeople.  I really like the Kamakazi baitholder hooks, and I put those on some of my spoons. I have a hard time finding them though, and I haven't seen their trebles in stores. They were recommended to me by a friend who helped reignite my passion for the sport."
638175,manitoubass2,2011-11-07 21:06:00,11391,"Dana,  Eagle Claw makes some good hooks, just depends on what type of hook you are looking to use. I have yet to see a company that makes the best hooks for every style. I like the Trokar Drop shot hooks, they work very well (now I'm waiting to try the VMC Drop shot hooks)  Sinclair, I don't think Mustad has a treble hook like that. Gamakatsu does though"
638180,tonyb,2011-11-07 21:14:00,1637,Owner ST-41 trebles for strong fish Gamakatsu round bend trebles for weak fish
638183,Hooked,2011-11-07 21:39:00,891,"I replace virtually all my trebles on my cranks and spoons with Owner trebles, with some Gammy's mixed in. I find Owner hooks to be extremely strong and sharp.  Gammy's are nice too."
638184,kuhaman,2011-11-07 21:46:00,503,Excalibur rotating trebles are my weapon of choice! Super sharp!
638210,OhioFisherman,2011-11-07 22:58:00,6623,"Another vote for Excaliber, just a far better percentage of hookups and less losses. It seemed like more than one point was always in. The old style black nickel were kind of brittle."
638223,adempsey,2011-11-07 23:14:00,1498,"My preference is also for Owner hooks, but I still think the Mustad Ultra Points are decent hooks.  My biggest problem has always been finding the hooks in the size/style I want in the retail stores, so I often just buy the best they have."
638282,Handlebarz,2011-11-08 00:33:00,3790,not sure about hooks for the little fish but anyone looking for good pliers check out walmart they have some very nice ones for $11 I have about 6 pairs just so I dont leave home with out them they are great better then some of the $20-$30 ones I had.
638291,solopaddler,2011-11-08 00:45:00,8605,  Mike how do you jump from replacement trebles to cheap pliers at Walmart?  Thanks for the tip I'll check them out.
638293,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 00:47:00,4661,For musky I use VMC 4x strong black buckle trebles
638377,Dabluz,2011-11-08 05:26:00,701,"I also like the Excalibur rotating hooks.  One thing for sure, most lures need higher quality hooks.  VMC, Gamakatsu, Owner, Excalibur are all great hooks.  I like my hooks to be short, wide gap, very light wire.  But I often use 4 and 6 lb mono so I need to use hooks that penetrate easily and quickly.  My reel's brake is never very tight.  I sure would like to know who makes the hooks on Panther Martins.  They are extremely sharp, stay sharp, very thin yet strong and seem rustproof."
638389,outllaw,2011-11-08 11:37:00,1232,"failing to mention crankbait types. thru the years we change up to vmc cone cut trebles, on walleye cranks. they are shorter shank round bends. on musky baits hooks depend upon lures themselves.. i normally hook and t over 10,000 hooks per year. my personal preference on muskys is longer shank thinner wire for excellent penetration."
638414,superdad,2011-11-08 13:41:00,353,"Mustad Triple Grips for this angler, they hold fish. As mentioned, be prepared to use yor pliers a lot - they're that good.  David  aka  Superdad"
638418,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 13:48:00,4661,just ordered the triple grips...  from what you guys are saying... they are the hooks im looking for...  i needed hooks that sting em and hold...  thnx for all the input on all brands metioned...
638424,Roy,2011-11-08 14:33:00,13728,I use a fair number of trebles and the best place I've found for price and service is: http://www.captainhookswarehouse.com/index.cfm?page=products Unbelievable choice and great service. Try to get your retailer to match these prices.
