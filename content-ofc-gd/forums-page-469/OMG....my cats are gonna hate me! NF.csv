I had always said that we would get a dog as soon as we had only 2 cats.  Well we chose this little choc Labrador this week. My son has already told us his name is Roloff...dont know where he pulled that name from...but its as good as any.     CUTE LITTLE DEVIL       UPDATED PICS AND VIDEO   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/wINKIxBYHws"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                 "

639636,Rod Caster,2011-11-13 01:33:00,5784,the cats might like him at first... that is until he grows to be 8 times their size
639637,woodenboater,2011-11-13 01:48:00,2277,you're going to have a hard time getting him out of the boat yano

639653,bigugli,2011-11-13 03:04:00,6138,"Cute pup.  Chocs love to chase bobbers, or anything hurled to the water."
639654,misfish,2011-11-13 03:07:00,29133,"You got one of the best breeds. Good looking pup.Jack will like him now,but in 6 months,he,ll be bumping Jack around.LOL   Nice addition to the family Simon."
639665,danc,2011-11-13 03:27:00,4677,"Awesome Simon. Jack will grow up with him and love him. Nothing like a new puppy for a young boy.  On another note, I'll be working at the new OPP station in Dryden for about 8 months or so, starting in a couple of weeks. That should give me plenty of time to cash in on the lunch that you owe me.  Talk to you soon Bud..."
639674,Joey,2011-11-13 04:27:00,9122,"Beautiful pup Simon, congrats.  Be prepared for alot less sleep for awhile"
639681,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-13 05:11:00,10439, And this!!!  
639695,spincast,2011-11-13 12:23:00,3279,"congrats Simon - nothing like  a dog for companionship. Oh, and add to Daves picture a few shoes....chewed shoes... That pic is hilarious Dave -"
639728,corvette1,2011-11-13 14:38:00,1765,cute pup simon
639736,Blue Lk,2011-11-13 15:14:00,337,"I would like to add another piece of advise,keep an eye on your vehicle seat belts. Puppies love chewing seat belts"
639743,limeyangler,2011-11-13 16:06:00,5204,Thanks for the replies guys....i'm just heading out to give the puppy a new collar...we are due to have Roloff home by December 10th.  I'll have a couple of pics in about 2 hrs to add.     Thanks Skeets...we like him a little bit too.    Thanks Rick....i cant think of a better place for a lake loving breed to be.   LOL....thanks Paul...he does look like a Roloff....weird eh?    Thats why we always said we would not get a grown pup....give the chance for the cats to establish who is in charge!   Bit of a WIN/WIN SITUATION.... thanks dude.   That will be fun and awkward all at once Bruce.
639744,limeyangler,2011-11-13 16:07:00,5204, Thanks brian....should be good for all of us.    Look forward to lunch Dan. Hey...were you walking past the mill in Dryden with a rather large zoom lensed camera last week....if not you have a double.    Thanks Joey....i know that advice is fresh off the press.....lol.    FFS Dave....lol.  Thats what my living room looks like after 2 hrs playing with Jack!    Thanks Spin.    Thanks Corvy   Taking notes here Rick...thanks bud.
639746,Jer,2011-11-13 17:23:00,1426,"Regardless of what Bill Murray says...dogs and cats can live together.  Before long, you'll have this...    ...but in brown, of course.  Enjoy the pup, next thing you know...they've become a dog."
639771,Leecher,2011-11-13 19:42:00,7832,He's adorable Simon
639774,Big Cliff,2011-11-13 20:08:00,6899,"Cats rule, dogs drool!  Oh man you are going to have your hands full now but it will be worth it! (I hope) LOL."
639837,limeyangler,2011-11-14 00:02:00,5204, I love that bit in Ghostbusters....classic line. I certainly will enjoy hm being a pup...like kittens and people...they get big....QUICK!      Thanks Jacques...looking forward to some pics of your successful hunts     I have to admit i am a cat person...but i think Roloff is winning me over already and we've only met twice!
639859,motion,2011-11-14 00:59:00,403,"Well congrats on the new family member. I have a 14 month old chocolate lab as well, named Toby.Thats him at 13 months in my avatar. They can be a handful at times but itÂ’s all worth it. He is a good fishing companion for me and my son. As others have already told you, they grow up way too fast. My guy is already pushing 75 lbs. They are also an efficient vacuum cleaner so watch out for ANYTHING you leave lying around the floor.  We have a 12 year old Shih Tzu that is more like a cat than a dog. Our Toby has learned to accept that the Shih Tzu (Ozzie) is the boss. Its funny watching the 9 lb Ozzie put the big guy in his place. They have been together now almost a year now and they are finally able to be in the same room together.  Enjoy your new little guy!"
639861,Grimace,2011-11-14 01:02:00,2020,Beautiful puppy.  My dream dog is a chocolate lab.  When I get one his name will be Bill.
