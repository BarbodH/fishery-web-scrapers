639634,Fang,2011-11-13 01:33:00,1330,Headed up to Radioworld this morning to spend some money that was burning a whole in my pocket. Had recently picked up an HB 1197 SI and was looking for the right Great Lakes Chip. Had my eye on the Platinum Plus map with Fish N Chips for Eastern Great Lakes as I don't think I'd ever need anything for Lake Superior. Well when asked what unit I had the sales rep pulled the tech guy out of the back and they took the demo card for the Platinum Plus and went over to the display units. They tried for a few minutes to get the Fish n Chips map up on the Bird but to no avail!!!! The Platinum PLus map only shows the standard depth and does not allow you to load manually or select the Fish n Chip mode.  They took the card out and plugged it right into the HDS8 beside it and boom! the Lowrance unit auto loads the Fish N chips charts when you zoom in past a certain point. The Radioworld sales guy turns to the tech and says - see I told you so!  The Fish N Chips maps will only work in a bird if it's not part of a Platinum plus map(?) I guess so as they put the Platinum chip back and handed me the Fish N Chip only map. Got home tonight and did load it in the bird. Like the detail and found some nnice ridges out in front of Hamilton harbor that might be worth checking out this summer. Also scrolled up to see some wicked shoal structure in Lake Superior.  Just thought I'd let you know as I had never heard about this and was kinda peeved. Oh well saved me a $100 bucks.
