73696,Carp,2007-05-21 22:13:00,1488,"I think this topic was covered not long ago. Still nasty seeing the video the second time.  I'll stick to community swimming pools near home. Although, some cougars and the odd barracuda are known to frequent the area. Guess you just can't escape the dangers of the wild, even in a large city."
73804,John Bacon,2007-05-22 02:54:00,3277,  Why not use a toilet or urinal???
73822,Carp,2007-05-22 04:04:00,1488,You're a funny guy JB. Got a good laugh out of me with that one.

73854,Roy,2007-05-22 10:54:00,13728," If you're gunna be using a urinal, don't throw your cigarette butts in there. They get soggy and they're hard to light. And those peppermints taste terrible."
