I've been through alot in the last little while, but I'm back and online again, and ready to take on the world. I've moved back home with my parents... Probably a few people know what that's all about.. yep.. gettin' a divorce. So if anyone wants to go fishing in the Brantford area in the next little while drop me a line... looking forward to frequenting some old haunts lol  I hope I can be online and participate more, I have nothing but great memories of OFC"

Sue and I have been together 25 years now, married 23, and I wouldn't trade her for any woman in the world, fortunatly she seems to feel the same about me.  Glad to see you back, posting, and getting on with your life!"
