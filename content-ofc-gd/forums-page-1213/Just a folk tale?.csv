72144,Coach B,2007-05-16 03:55:00,18,"My brother (older of course) has been traveling to Ontario for over 15 years to fish and every time I go with him at somepoint he mentions someone catching an ealpout. What the heck is an ealpout???? Next week will be my fourth trip up there with him and I have never seen one of them. I'm thinking of calling Bull on him. If they are true, they give me a the heebie jeebies from their description."
72145,Nemo,2007-05-16 04:00:00,727,Burbot or eelpout  
72147,Coach B,2007-05-16 04:04:00,18,"I had them pictured more snake/eal like. don't get me wrong, they aren't handsome. So the tales are true."
72153,kickingfrog,2007-05-16 04:41:00,8333,"Nemo's got it.  As with a lot of fish there are many common or local names: burbot, ling, freshwater cod, ling cod, lawyer, eelpout, loche, luch and I'm sure a few others. I think the scientific name still is Lota lota, but even those names change occasionally. They're found in just about every province and most northern states.   Rob"
72376,icedude,2007-05-16 20:06:00,459,don't quote me..but here on Lake Simcoe some of the older guyz call them LING!  have heard that terminology before-that same family of fish  Cheers  ID1
72400,Bob,2007-05-16 21:23:00,370,The term eelpout came from a suggestion that they look like a cross between an eel and a mudpout (catfish).  They are the only freshwater member of the codfish family and are quite tasty.
72402,rickster,2007-05-16 21:26:00,495,Poor mans lobster.  Chunk the meat and boil it and then dip it in melted butter and enjoy
72516,Tacklebuster,2007-05-17 02:22:00,303,how can anything that ugly taste good?
72530,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-17 03:13:00,2585,damn ugly looking fish.  call Bull on your brother just to get him going.  Cheers!
72533,Coach B,2007-05-17 03:18:00,18,"I think I will. One of his stories is about catching one at night and the fish curling around his buddies arm when he reached down to pull it out of the water.  That would be enough for me to stop night fishing - just thinking about it gives me the shivers. Just don't think I could eat one unless I was really, really hungry!"
72534,outdoorguy61,2007-05-17 03:18:00,220,I have only tried ling once and rally enjoyed it. I understand that they are skinned and deep fried like with fish and chips. Some used to throw them away on Simcoe as I recall as a kid icefishing there.  outdoorguy61
72566,OhioFisherman,2007-05-17 08:33:00,6623,"Never caught one myself, or even seen one. They used to be pretty common in Lake Erie, dad used to ice fish for them, but I think it was in the late 40`s, early 50`s. There have been some reports here of them being caught once in a while."
73642,mpt,2007-05-21 16:46:00,158,Fry up the livers in butter for a real taste treat.
