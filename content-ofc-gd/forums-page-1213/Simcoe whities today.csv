Pretty much the whole park was empty and to ourselves only. Nice day, almost no wind...few flies but not too bad...whities were waiting for us...lost track on how many we've lost on the way up... The only bad point of the day was me dropping my company cell phone in the lake while trying to load my boat onto the trailer. Oh well...on the way home stopped by the office and got a new one but I've lost the pictures I took with the phone. As a compensation here are some better ones taken with my digital camcorder at home.  On to Lake O. tomorrow for the big fight with the big boys and girls again ha ha. Cheers and fishing, fishing and MORE fishing ;-)  Here are the pictures:        Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
