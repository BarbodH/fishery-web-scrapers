For those on Bell Express-vu it will be 10:00 on the movie network, for others it's HBO, but I imagine it's on the movie network for those who get it.  My nepwhew Dan will be playing the role of Tommy.  Hope you can watch it.  Here's his website....put together by his older brother John http://www.danielsamonas.com/  Maureen"

Then I can brag when my nephews made for TV movie comes on.  He plays the lead too.  Nice having actors in the family.  I love watching their careers emerge.  Pam"
