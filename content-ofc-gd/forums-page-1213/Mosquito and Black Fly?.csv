73615,tjsa,2007-05-21 14:43:00,1578,"Ummmm...............when are you going to be in the Ear Falls area??????????  When I was out saturday, none to be found, but since it was only 5 celcius, and getting colder, that had something to do with it. I am a bit further east of Ear Falls, but the temps were probably much the same that day."
73622,Bob Apple,2007-05-21 15:29:00,37,"We will be at Bluffy lake, which I beleive is south east about 30 miles. Is it still that cold! Were the fish biting and on what?"
