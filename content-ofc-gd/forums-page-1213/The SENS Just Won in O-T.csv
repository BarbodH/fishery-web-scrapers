73300,Mattitude,2007-05-20 07:48:00,155,"I heard a stat the other day that was pretty interesting.  Any year ending in the number 7, either Detroit or a Canadian team has won the cup."
73326,brifishrgy,2007-05-20 12:59:00,559,If it wasn't for Hasek the wings would be done already .. hes hit and miss and against an offence like Ottawa there is no hope for the Wings ... Ottawa in 6
