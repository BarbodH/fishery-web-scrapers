Cause after fishing the same location for days in and days out I finally figured out the carp pattern where the big ones lurk today. The only scarey part is that if your standing on the shoreline too long the red ants are going to eat you alive like they did me today almost.  They started climbing on my shoes then some where all over my back pack. And they bite too.   dsn
