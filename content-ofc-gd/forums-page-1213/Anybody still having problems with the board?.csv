73240,Joey,2007-05-19 23:27:00,9122,"Its about enough to drive a grown woman to go shopping instead of read the board.  Anyone still having problems?  It was okay right after the change, but now its back to the same old slow and hard to reply to threads?  Just curious.  Joey"
73249,tjsa,2007-05-20 00:23:00,1578,"Not me Joey, but I did not have much problem even before the change."

73267,bigfish1965,2007-05-20 01:28:00,3382,"You guys are in the new block of IP addies that Rogers added. Much problems with them. Seems anyone with a 99.*.*.* series ip address is having issues. Call Rogers and let them know. They will deny it, but keep on them. If they deny it ask them why anyone with a 99 addy cannot get in and everyone else is just fine."
73268,tbayboy,2007-05-20 01:32:00,1497,I've been buggin them all week (see other post)  and no luck yet (dealing with Rogers support is like pulling teeth) but if you do get through to someone reference ticket #KMM30683959C0KM - if we get enough people tied to a single ticket they'll start to realize its not just one person.  Eventually they'll figure it out and big thanks to Rick for trying everything in his power to help us even though its definitely not a problem with the site itself (they went though this with a bunch of sites back in April when they first started the 99.* range so hopefully one of the CSRs there recognizes that this is the same issue).
73273,Joey,2007-05-20 01:55:00,9122,"Okay, I'll call rogers then.  But can anyone explain why it is only this site I have problems with?  If its Rogers, why are all the other sites I visit fast?  Thanks,  Joey"
73291,Spiel,2007-05-20 04:26:00,9065,....No problems before and none now. Bell Sympatico for those wondering.
73298,Bob,2007-05-20 06:50:00,370,I'm on Vianet here for quite a few years and I've never had a problem with this site or any other.
73303,Big Cliff,2007-05-20 10:01:00,6899,"Heck, I'm on dialup and I'm not having any problems! When you talk to Rogers Joey, yell them you want to know why people on Bell Dialup can access the site faster."
73322,ChrisK,2007-05-20 12:21:00,2772,Smooth as silk here on Bell
