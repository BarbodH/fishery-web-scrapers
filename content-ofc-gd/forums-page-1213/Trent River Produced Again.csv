After a very nice dinner   ( lobster and BBQ steak)  , I ventured out, on the ol'mighty Trent. When we arrived, there was several people fishing. Thought it was going to be a waste of time, but, BAAM.  4Lb pike, very nice battle. Then my buddy got a small but nice eye. So after a beer, I got the last eye. All in All, I gotz to say, Missed a good trip Todd!!!!!"
