73388,glen,2007-05-20 18:08:00,2641,Maybe i will use indoor outdoor.  But i dont want to.
73389,Muskieman,2007-05-20 18:11:00,2472,EH!   you can go to any floor covering store and ask for silicone based carpeting. we just put some on my deck.. and that's whats gonna go in the boat in a few weeks. good stuff. in door .. out door burns easy in the sun. .we bought ours at Home Depot. Randy
73392,Muskieman,2007-05-20 18:15:00,2472,you can also use a color matched spray on bedliner ... add a little silica sand to your mixture for no slip propertys. shoot it with schutz gun it's for undercoating .. a lot of tourist ops. are doing that now.  it works too.. spray off to clean and u/v resistant..    good luck!   Randy
73393,Shaky,2007-05-20 18:18:00,25,Home Depot will be the best price.   You could also try e-bay.
73423,aniceguy,2007-05-20 20:47:00,1094,"hands down home depot.  re carpeted the entire boat 2 yrs ago, contact cement and carpet ran me under 200 bills.  They are marine carpets just not the plush stuff that comes with the new boats.  Although I remember the person telling me they can order it in.  Regardless off the rack at the depot is serving me perfectly fine"
73467,Greencoachdog,2007-05-21 00:59:00,8163,BassPro has more marine carpet and vinyl than you can shake a stick at!  Check it out:  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...RINECARPETVINYL
73482,fishdawg,2007-05-21 01:36:00,912,there is a good marine supplies place at the end of Burlighton St. in Hamilton right on the bay - the name currently escapes me. I was there a couple months ago to get VHF antena wire - may be wortha try to see if they have what you need
73503,ch312,2007-05-21 03:06:00,1590,a carpet/flooring store....
73507,glen,2007-05-21 03:26:00,2641,Bass Pro in toronto dosnt carry carpet.  I got the vinyl from home depot.  cost $250 with the glue.  Thats about $200 more than i wanted.  The indoor outdoor i saw didnt have any rubber on the back so it would have trapped moisture.  I am at about $600 to do the floor and i aint done yet.  Thanks for the replies.  the bed liner stuff might be good too.
73543,hawg_hauler,2007-05-21 11:46:00,69,I bought mine through BRP's Johnson Evinrude accessory catalog. Very reasonable price. Go to your local Johnson/Evinrude dealer and check it out.
73608,Zib,2007-05-21 14:17:00,369,I bought my marine carpet from Cabela's. Spend the extra $$$ & buy the premium carpet.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/common/s...t&noImage=0
