73516,glen,2007-05-21 04:04:00,2641,What is the best type of seat base and pedestal??   I want to put one on the front deck that wont fall out when going fast and hitting waves.  But i want to be able to remove it and use it high or low.  Thanks for any help.

They seem a bit pricey but after upgrading to these from the manual ones that came with the boat I wished I had done it years ago. They lock into place but are easily removed by depressing the locking latch with your foot while lifting up. Here's Cabela's site on them. http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&id=0001725

73593,glen,2007-05-21 13:44:00,2641,I would like one that has a removable post so the seat will go right on the floor.  I am worried that the ones that just slip together with no thread or lock with come out when i hit a wave.  Any thoughts.  Thanks.

I fish Lake Erie a LOT and they can't come out but yet the post is removable very easily. But I will say my older seat pedestals just sat into the bases without locking and they never came out of there bases either. Your worrying about nothing. However, I still endorse the Swivl-Eze Wedge Power Pedestals over the manual ones. You will not regret getting them."
