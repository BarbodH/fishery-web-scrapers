Oh well, met a couple of nice guys out there and Thea was catching her sunfish that made her happy! Even the guy fishing beside me had a nice jumbo surprise smallmouth bass, must have been around 6 pounds easy! Thea had a couple of pike and/or muskie follow he sunfish and Perch in to shore. All in all a nice afternoon!! Pictures are coming!  Tinman "
