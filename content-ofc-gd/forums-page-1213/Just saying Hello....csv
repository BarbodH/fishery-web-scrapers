73174,TangerineDream,2007-05-19 17:17:00,47,Just wanted to say hello to everyone here now that I am living in Ontario. Manitoba is such a great fishery although Ontario does have its Muskie and Largemouth as well as salmonoids and trout. Whoo Hoo Ontario is great!  Looking forward to posting on the site regularly.  If anyone has questions about Manitoba please feel free to ask.
