73404,bassmaster4,2007-05-20 19:27:00,801,Went fishing for pike today with my dad. Started off looking like nothing was going to come out of the day but things made a turn for the better. It had started to rain and we were thinking of packing it in but instead we went to the car and waited a couple minutes. The rain had stopped and we went back to fishing but this time to a different spot on the lake. We had been there for almost 5 hours and nothing. But then as i was reeling my medium minnow back to recast it i felt a strike. I set the hook and the fight was oni ended up pulling in a nice 19 incher.  19 inch pike    We kept fishing and I caught a smallmouth bass no pic of that OOS. Took the hook out and she was back in the water.  An hour later we packed it in the wind really started to pick up and we were out of minnows. I'm probably going to head back tomorrow.   Bassmaster4
