73427,Grandman,2007-05-20 21:16:00,31,"Myself and a buddy went out to try a little known ""backwoods"" lake another friend of ours discovered last year.A long drive north and a two hour walk through the bush rewarded us big time. We ended up catching about 50 beautiful crappies and a couple oos bass.  Came home with 15 big slabs measuring 12.5 all the way to 16.25 inches!!  The big girl was the largest either of us had ever seen (too bad it was on his line not mine).  This fish looked like it had eaten a couple golf balls!  It weiged over 2 pounds on the digital scale.  Anyways, I'll post pics when I develop my film of it (don't have a digi camera)  Later"
73430,TangerineDream,2007-05-20 22:00:00,47,So what is it gonna cost to get the location of this backwoods lake? 
73441,tjsa,2007-05-20 23:14:00,1578,"I know where it is.  Its lake 82, paragraph 48, subsection c, tab F, line item 22,   :lol:  :lol:"
73442,bassmaster4,2007-05-20 23:16:00,801,dang 16.25 inches is one heck of a slab
73445,Grandman,2007-05-20 23:24:00,31,"No letting go of this secret bud, jumbo crappies can be fished out in 2-3 years easily on ANY lake"
73450,TangerineDream,2007-05-20 23:43:00,47,I'll settle for a blindfolded excursion lol..............
