73796,Doop,2007-05-22 02:21:00,22,"Thanks guys, I really appreciate it.  My uncle passed about away about 2 months ago...my aunt passed away about a week before him and my Grandpa a week before my aunt.  After my uncle passed away, and our family had time to breathe...my aunt decided I should have my uncle's smoker.  I'm not sure what kind it is....i'm sure it's nice because he never did anything half-way....always the best and top of the line  I just hope I can take good care of his smoker and make some good meals.  I'll check out the sites you guys suggested and let you know how the first go-around comes out.  Thanks for your help everyone."
