73522,Black_Blade,2007-05-21 05:15:00,258,"I would just replace it, if its that bad, with a piece of marine grade plywood.  Pretty straight forward really...."
73527,charlied,2007-05-21 06:34:00,584,i am going thru the same process.....like blackblade said just replace it.  I just have to find the time...LOL.   I was told I should use a silicone of some sort around where the screws or bolts go...can anyone confirm this?
73552,b2kptbo,2007-05-21 12:16:00,1505,"Just did a 12' last year and a dab of silicone is good, gave mine a coat of paint as well..."
73556,ssauvain,2007-05-21 12:35:00,77,So Marine grade plywood cut to same dimensions...how do I adhere it besides the screws and just put silicone around the screws??? As in filling the holes or what...I am a visual learner....LOL....
73562,b2kptbo,2007-05-21 13:00:00,1505,"Add the silicone around the screw head and bolt/washer before you tighten them down. This should be enough to seal around the threads and hole opening, what leaks out can be wiped off easily (more is better than not enough)..."
73564,Smokey,2007-05-21 13:04:00,1278,I replaced mine on the 12 ftr with a piece of pressure treated plywood. Just remember to treat the cut ends as you put it together.
73569,Black_Blade,2007-05-21 13:11:00,258,"When I got my 12 footer out on the water the first time, I realized that somebody had forgotten to seal the bolts on the plywood.  I got a few of those little water tap washers and used a little dap of silicone as well for insurance...been a bone dry boat ever since.  Also got some nylon lock nuts to make sure the bolts dont work lose with vibration."
73607,ssauvain,2007-05-21 14:15:00,77,Great help guys....as always....!!! I too found out as I put the boat in this weekend and water coming in on the screws....then started to tighten them and they just ripped right through the wood!!!!!
