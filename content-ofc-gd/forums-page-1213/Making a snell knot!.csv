Well....the snell knot has got to be the hardest d**n knot I have come across yet to do!  I have looked at that animated knot site, but it really doesn't help....finally just thrown it all down in disgust."

73364,tjsa,2007-05-20 16:08:00,1578,"LOL, snelling hooks is not that big of a deal, but snelling 2 hooks, with a specific spacing between them,can be a bit of a challenge. I make my own worm harnesses also, and snell the first hook, but I just use a clinch not for the 2nd one. I am snelling challenged also with regards to multiple hooks, one is OK."

73367,Andy,2007-05-20 16:21:00,330,Fear snell knots no more! The link provided shows a quick and easy snell knot. I have used it and it has not failed me. It's also easy to tie two hooks and get the distance between just right. Andy  http://www.fishingkites.co.nz/fishingknots...hing_knots.html
