72592,Billy Bob,2007-05-17 12:55:00,5865,"I would need more info. How is your son. Would it be OK if I brought my bride. And where is Lakair, what kind of fishing are we talking about (walleye, pike etc.....) What would be the cost involved. I am assuming two different boats ? ? ?"

72724,Daplumma,2007-05-17 19:30:00,1961,You may want to contact the owners at Lakair as I think(dont quote me on this)that they charge per person in the cabin.Looking forward to meeting all y'all there. Joe
72727,douG,2007-05-17 19:34:00,2693,"I think Kevin and Leslie show their rates for the facility, and you can stack as many as you want in there, but as Joe suggests, double check."
