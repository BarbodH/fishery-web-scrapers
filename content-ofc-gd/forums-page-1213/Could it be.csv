73180,misfish,2007-05-19 17:39:00,29133,"WOW what a morning to head out and get out to fish some open water and the weather gods were right on the money this morning. Launched out from Oro. Nothing but glass.           Made for a nice ride over to the whitie grounds. I arrive and there are already a hand full of boats and everyone is catching.  I tye on my mini green monster and it didnt take long for the first fish to be on.Nice laker and he took it big time.                I marked fish from 30 fow all the way to the bottom.UNREAL. I always heard the action was hot off JP,but what I seen was so unreal. After about two and a half hours of busting chops,I headed down to cooks for some pike,n. The bite wasnt fast and furious as the morning but manged a few toothy critter.     Even had a X-Rap finally break on me,but Im sure after 50 or so hit on one lure,it would happen. That lure sure caught me alot of fish.     Good entertaining morning out.  Back at it again in the AM.  Hey Jiggy,Webster say hello. I looked for ya,but never found ya.  Who said ya cant catch whities and lakers from a bass boat."

73345,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-20 14:13:00,0,Excellant report. I am surprised you were marking fish as shallow as 30 feet! Every year I say I am going to go for crappies and white fish but never end up doing it.
