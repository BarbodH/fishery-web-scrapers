I'm hoping to test out some new inline spinner baits I've made recently and catch my first fish of the season (last year I had one January 1st!)   Anyone else gonna be pike fishing tomorrow? If you see us with a  small entarage (5 adults, 3 children) make sure you say hello!"

73319,mepps,2007-05-20 12:19:00,1301,I'll be the part of the entourage catching pike Grant   I'm not sure if I have neough time to post pic of the lures before I leave - hopefully I will have pictures of them hanging from the mouth of a TO pike!
