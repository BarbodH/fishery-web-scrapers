73678,Bob Devine,2007-05-21 19:56:00,251,Not sure what part of the western basin you are going to fish but here is my report from Colchester to Leamington. HOT HOT and HOT. I have been running Northland crawler harnesses with a #4 or 5 Rainbow blade. I have been fishing many different depths from 12-35 fow and doing well.
