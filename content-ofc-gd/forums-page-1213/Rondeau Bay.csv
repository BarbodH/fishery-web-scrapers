73197,jjcanoe,2007-05-19 18:43:00,744,Never fished Rondeau bay before and am possibly headed out there tommorrow with the boat and gonna search for some pike.  Anyone have any tips on baits or spots?  Don't need the secret spots just the well known spots everyone fishes. PM me if you don't want to reveal anything over the web.  Thanks in advance jjcanoe
73424,jjcanoe,2007-05-20 20:52:00,744,Anybody?  jjcanoe
73425,lickmyarmpit,2007-05-20 20:55:00,359,I've never fished there myself but it looks like a shallow weedy bay like long point.  Id say light coloured spinnerbaits they allways produce for me in long point.

Got my box of spinnerbaits packed.  I guess I'll try and find where the other boats are fishing and hope that they're not all out at Colchester!  jjcanoe"
