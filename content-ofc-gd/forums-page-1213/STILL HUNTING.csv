73355,ccmtcanada,2007-05-20 15:36:00,7971,Great job out there!!  Bly and I tried a bit of night time fishing...had a few hits...saw a flash of chrome and that was about it.  Bly pulled in a nice 11 inch rock bass...hit a fly....LOL.  We're hoping to catch one or two more...maybe today...gotta use up about 10 roe bags...dont want them to go to waste.  Thanks for the pics bro....hope the moving and job still allows an hour or two for fishing!
