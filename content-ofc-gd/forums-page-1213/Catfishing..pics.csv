73693,aplumma,2007-05-21 22:04:00,6896,"Hey Roy,  Well the truth be told I had my Ipod going in the speaker system and we had it on shuffle...... It was hooked while Buckwheat was singin Toot Toot one of my favorite songs. After releasing it the next song that came up was the theme from Jaws. Then the Valkyrie was next from Apocalypse now.  Kind of scarry huh?   Art"
73698,Roy,2007-05-21 22:15:00,13728,"Lard tunderin' Jaisus, Art, what y'all smokin' down there to be listening to those tunes. I was pretty dang sure you'd have Desmond Dekker on deck."
73701,Daplumma,2007-05-21 22:17:00,1961,"It was Arts Ipod,Roy.Not mine! Joe"
73705,crappiesteve,2007-05-21 22:25:00,220,"Yeah..What Joe said,wasn,t his Ipod LOL.  He would not listen to that kind of music.  Steve"
73731,Dutch,2007-05-22 00:11:00,831,"WTG, great big blue.  Nice tunes too, lol."

Man by sunday you going to know every song they do by heart.......   So I am guilty of listening to a few classical T.V. themes wait till I break out the Ska for you Roy I bet I can get you to dive off the boat by the 3rd song.  Art
73219,Daplumma,2007-05-19 22:10:00,1961,"Went out on the boat for some big cats today.They were calling for cloudy and rain so it should have been a great day.Turned out to be bright sunny,windy and clear as a bell.Not so good but might as well give it a try.Just set out the lines and ""Fish on""! It was Arts line with a big Makeral head on it but he had a hook stuck in his hand or something so I grabbed the rod.  Did not feel like a little kitty  and when we got her to the boat we both knew we would need a bigger net!Art took the Boga Grip and leaned out over the side and pulled this baby into the boat.No measurement or weight just wanted to get this girl back in the water.Just a couple of quick pics.If I was pushed for a weight I would say 35-40 lbs.Heres a couple of pics..   My PB for Catfish,sorry team 6 Its not a channel cat or that would be some serious inches! Joe"
73223,motv8tr,2007-05-19 22:17:00,2587,Dang that's a BIG fish...so what happened to Art again that he couldn't handle it  Maureen

73242,crappiesteve,2007-05-19 23:29:00,220,"Congrats Joe,and like you said, Art no where to be found,He was so scared of that big Pussy Cat.  What a wuss  Steve"
73248,tjsa,2007-05-20 00:23:00,1578,"YEEESSHHHH!!!  Thats a serious bend in that rod, good thing it was hooked on the muskie rod.   And that for sure ain't no kitty, more like a leopard."
73258,Greencoachdog,2007-05-20 00:58:00,8163,"'Bout time ya found the Blues! Ya aint gonna find'em in no skinny water, that's for sure.  Excellent report and pic!  Catfish stealin' is a ""Walk the Plank"" ofense around these parts, I wouldnt've blamed Art a bit if ya had to swim home.  Next time ya get one like that, get a magic marker and put freckles on that baby... the Canucks will never know the difference, that's what I'm gonna do!"

73306,b2kptbo,2007-05-20 11:15:00,1505,"Thats one fat cat, beauty..."
73313,crappiesteve,2007-05-20 11:47:00,220,"Joe,was that monster caught out of the new boat?And that cats girth,is as big as your waist.LOL  Steve"
73323,aplumma,2007-05-20 12:27:00,6896,Well I was tying on a hook and had 3 oz of lead dragging it into the meat of my hand when that fish struck. It was pulling the tip of the rod down towards  the water and the drag was steady slippin out so Joe got to catch the 1st fish of the day. It just so happened to be this great big monster of a fish that had already spawned out. Now for the story that Steve wants to hear....... Well when I saw that fishin thinggy bend way over towards the water I just raised my skirt up and ran towards the front of the boat screaming for Joe to get that ugly animal off my fishin thinggy.... and Yes thats the new boat out their with the radio playing and the twin 318's idling at a low rumble and the gas gauge going from right to left.   Art
73324,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-20 12:30:00,0,That is one HUGE catfish! It must have gave you a royal battle!  I though the blues were part of the channel cat family anyways.
73342,Spiel,2007-05-20 13:43:00,9065," ....LOL, somehow I imagined it happening just like that!"

73686,Row Boat,2007-05-21 20:35:00,19,"Man...if I was catching cats like that, I'd be calling that my catfish rod that I occasionally use for ski fishing...  Thanks for the post !  RB"
