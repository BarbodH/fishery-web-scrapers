847410,Joeytier,2014-04-12 22:50:00,3990,"I live on the northern tip of the Ottawa river, and starting in late fall they begin draining the system from Lake Temiskaming and Kipawa all down thru the river.  So by this time of the year, the river is typically about 10 feet below normal levels making for some cool hiking, plus I wanted to scope out some potential spots for season opener.Along the way I scored a nice husky jerk in need of a little tlc and dragged about 2 km of line out of the river bed too.        "
847433,EME411,2014-04-12 23:44:00,13,"The last two years the river has been very low during the summer here in Pet. Last year I camped up river at Drift Wood PC, water was at normal levels there. Guess they were holding it back at the Swisha Dam"
847493,Rod Caster,2014-04-13 12:32:00,5784,"can't see the pics, but I did that a couple years ago closer to Mattawa. It's not everyday you get to see 10 feet of riverbed from a major water system!"
847504,NAW,2014-04-13 13:16:00,4022,I can't see the pics either.  But it sounds friggen cool!
847508,Roy,2014-04-13 13:37:00,13728,These might be your images Joey?       
847526,Joeytier,2014-04-13 15:08:00,3990,"Thanks Roy.  Linking codes weren't done right  Yeah, the levels seemed fairly normal here for the last couple summers"
847541,misfish,2014-04-13 16:38:00,29133," I see them. Wow look at all that structure.  Is there something going on with the site,or is it that updating thing again Roy?  I remember one time we stopped at some provincial park on our way to Kanta.. Hot as hell. River was very low. Couldnt even get the canoe in where we stayed. We were an hour or so from an air conditioned hotel.Packed up and left. Thank god we did. That was when the tornado went through that very night."
847654,EME411,2014-04-14 00:52:00,13,"I noticed the ice is out in one of your pic's, Still lots of ice here, it is open where the current is stronger."
847656,chris.brock,2014-04-14 00:57:00,4053,"that's like a dream come true, to actually see what's down there, I'd retire that husky jerk and hang it up somewhere  cool pics"
847659,Joeytier,2014-04-14 01:12:00,3990,The stretch up here is open 12 months a year.  Even after a week straight of -35 to -40 overnight there was very minimal ice
847704,Maverick,2014-04-14 03:04:00,371,"I drove by on the weekend on the way to Ottawa, it's like the next step from down and side imaging. I saw one spot where there was what looked like an old bridge that was used before they flooded the area. Pretty cool."

847747,highdrifter,2014-04-14 14:07:00,2534,Very cool.  I grew up on Wabi Bay but I've never ventured the Kipawa.  It's pretty flat on our side so you could walk several hundred yards out from the shoreline in early spring.  Great way to find all kinds of baits!  I've heard that you can get lakers in the Kipawa.  I know the lake has them but I've never seen one caught.  Thanks for the pics!
848034,Joeytier,2014-04-15 15:51:00,3990,L. Temiskaming has lots of lakers and the odd one is pulled out of the river downstream as well.
