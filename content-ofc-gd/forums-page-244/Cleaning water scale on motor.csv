847267,mike rousseau,2014-04-11 22:21:00,4661,The title kinda says it all...  I have a fair bit of water scale on my motor...  What do you guys use to clean it???  I was thinking magic eraser....
847273,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-11 22:30:00,4399,I would try vinegar first or perhaps CLR.
847274,landry,2014-04-11 22:42:00,1005,Vinegar works great. Magic eraser will work but it is a subtle abrasive.
847277,DropShot'r,2014-04-11 22:57:00,62,"I use CLR, it works great."
847281,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-11 23:08:00,10439,Another vote for CLR here!!!
847285,NANUK,2014-04-11 23:32:00,797,"Clean with vinegar & water solution, then give it a good treatment of auto or marine wax to protect against UV and hard water spots."
847290,esoxansteel,2014-04-11 23:45:00,1307,spray 9 marine works great as well
847292,mike rousseau,2014-04-11 23:59:00,4661,Sounds like vinigar...  I'd do that tonight but the wife brought it to work to descale the coffee machine....  Cripes...  Lol
847444,Fishing4Tails,2014-04-13 00:30:00,38,Mike .. Use 50/50 water (spray bottle and micro fibre cloths )and vinegar not straight vinegar .  Wipe boat down every trip you never have water marks take 5 min to do . If stains are bad I use clr soap and water mix . Don't let it dry and water very well after !
847461,mike rousseau,2014-04-13 02:16:00,4661,Thanks Greg... Wanna keep the new yammy looking good...  Btw... Nice boat...
847469,tender52,2014-04-13 04:30:00,270,"x2... 50/50 vinegar water. I use baby clothes to wipe, clean and wax.  Waxing will help a lot."
