848330,misfish,2014-04-16 21:01:00,29133,"its a larger one upon my request. I'd guess 2.75"". I'm not a fly fisherman. I want these for one specific spot that I'll be fishing on light spinning tackle:) he even bulked them up for me  Nice. Im thinking your targeting eyes with that up your way. They look like a great smallie bait. Like you said,on a light spinning reel combo. I LIKE."
