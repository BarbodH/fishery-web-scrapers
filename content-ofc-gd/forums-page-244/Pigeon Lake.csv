847627,captpierre,2014-04-13 23:20:00,2521,Got back from the cottage tonight.  Water levels 2 ft higher than 10 days ago.  Levels rose 4 inches last 2 days- without the rain.  Still slushy ice everywhere  Ice pulling back from the shore by 2-6 ft.  Stopped by the dam in Buckhorn.  All 4 gates open and a torrent of water coming thru.  Might actually be thawed by month end.
