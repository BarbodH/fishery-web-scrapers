838320,agoertzen,2014-02-25 15:29:00,23,"for you hunters, I got a question. im thinking of getting my hunting license and firearms done all at once in the one stop program.  has anyone gone through the program recently and how hard is the course?"
838323,BillM,2014-02-25 15:32:00,17367,Course is cake.
838325,highdrifter,2014-02-25 15:35:00,2534,Course is cake.  Oh man you're a hunter too?!?!
838329,agoertzen,2014-02-25 15:38:00,23,"awesome, ty for the info. looks like ill get by the end of march  when they got the course set up for my town. now I got to talk a couple buddies into taking it with me."
838374,kickingfrog,2014-02-25 18:59:00,8333,I don't know how much I remembered from the fac days but I would have had no problem with the 2 written tests without the course. But I've only handled lever action rifles and auto shotguns in class so that classroom part helped with that aspect of the practical exam. It is more efficient to do both wt once anyway.
838406,PikeyArea,2014-02-25 23:09:00,19,Better to do both at once but ya almost impossible to fail. instructors will help u get thru if you need it.
838412,bare foot wader,2014-02-25 23:22:00,1354,"Better to do both at once but ya almost impossible to fail. instructors will help u get thru if you need it.   instructors are taking heat for that just recently, might expect things to get a bit tougher but basic common sense and the slightest knowledge of firearms will get most people passing with flying colours   cbc sent in an undercover instructor to audit the testing standards in each province apparently  http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/#!/content/1.2544002"
838423,Rod Caster,2014-02-26 00:17:00,5784,"I did my full courses this past summer. I come from a hunting family/community so it was literally the easiest written test I've ever taken. For the practical portion, just take your time and think of what you are doing, don't be all nervous and weird like some of the people; who probably shouldn't be holding guns at all haha."
838430,agoertzen,2014-02-26 00:42:00,23,thanks for the tips. contacted one instructor today and he is dropping off the hunters handbook and the pal book tomorrow for 40 bones. I wanted to get the books so I can read them a couple times before I go take the class.
838473,Sinker,2014-02-26 04:23:00,8692,"My son turns 12 tomorrow. He's taking the course in 2 weeks. He'll have no probs passing, so you shouldnt either  S."

838589,DOS,2014-02-26 21:58:00,119,"100% pass rate so far in my store, you wont have a problem,  just don't point the gun at the instructors foot and you will do fine.  RED"
838614,iFish4real,2014-02-27 00:00:00,386,just don't point the gun at the instructors foot... ...anywhere else is OK
838625,akaShag,2014-02-27 00:54:00,2073,"First of all, CONGRATULATIONS on choosing to join the hunting community!  I hope that you will be able to find a mentor, after your course is complete, who can help you to put into practice the knowledge you will gain on the course.  The Ontario (hunting) course is excellent, and the federal firearms course is, shall we say, skewed somewhat because of the origins of the Firearms Act.  All of the knowledge is useful, some marginally so, but most directly applicable to modern day hunting.  Your instructor(s) will ensure you know the material, and have practiced the practical aspects, so by the time you take your tests you should have no problems whatsoever in achieving passing grades.  Remember:  there is no such thing as a stupid question.  If you don't understand something, ASK.  And good luck to you!  Doug"
847631,agoertzen,2014-04-13 23:37:00,23,well guys i am now fully certified!!!! just finished the courses.
847645,akaShag,2014-04-14 00:29:00,2073,"Congratulations!  Turkey season opens 25 April, but you will also need a turkey course to hunt them.  Keep an eye on the cut-off dates for deer tags and all of that.  And if you need advice about buying a firearm please send me a note.  I do have significant expertise in that regard.  Doug"
847673,chris.brock,2014-04-14 01:42:00,4053,"when you get into your tree stand, what is the first thing you do?  1) tie yourself off  or  2) take a couple practise shots"
847677,agoertzen,2014-04-14 01:59:00,23,tie yourself off with the proper harness
847685,chris.brock,2014-04-14 02:16:00,4053,"I like to have a sip from the flask and then touch a few off just to get into the rhythm, but your answer is the right one  anyways, congrats, and all joking aside, be safe"
847693,agoertzen,2014-04-14 02:38:00,23,Its all good bud. Everyone has their own ritual. Thanks. Finding a mentor is going to be my hardest part.
847698,porkpie,2014-04-14 02:51:00,2521,"My oldest boy just took the course recently.  He had no problems, said the instructors where quite helpful and found it all quite enjoyable!  just have to get his turkey course done now!"
847701,mcdougy,2014-04-14 02:58:00,274,"Congratulations, Hunting is a signicant talent to practice and learn in my books.  Respect your weapon and its direction/backdrop, Respect Nature,and Respect Landowners. You do those things, you will have a lifetime of fun. Someone will take you under their wing a bit, thats the hunter way."
