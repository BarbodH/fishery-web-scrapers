847936,livinisfishin,2014-04-15 01:36:00,661,I have a friend that has two manual big jon down riggers he wants to sell to me. My question is can I add a line counter to them somehow?
847957,Freshtrax,2014-04-15 02:49:00,2215,"If you have line counter reels,  and your running 30 ft leads,   When you get to 100 ft of line out your roughly down 70 ft."
847958,Gallie,2014-04-15 02:52:00,1215,"My first riggers were invaders with broken counters, we measured how long each turn was (2.5ft) and counted turns to the desired depth. Tedious at times but it worked. I tried to find counters for them but with no luck. Hope this helps."
847959,NANUK,2014-04-15 02:53:00,797,"Hard to say without looking at the rigger, all depends on the model, on most models you can add a counter Can you get some pictures ? specially from the top, between the handle and pully,"
847961,John Bacon,2014-04-15 03:07:00,3277,"If not, you can try colouring your down rigger cable the way lead core is coloured.  That will give you a good estimate of how much line is out."
847986,BillM,2014-04-15 11:37:00,17367,"Shouldn't be very hard to add a counter, although not an ideal setup.... What happened to the counters that were on them originally?"
