847675,206,2014-04-14 01:47:00,563,"Looking for answers on where one waterway becomes another, I googled a lil but not sure even how to input such a search. I'm hoping the knowledgeable members here could add there input.  1. Note the Blue River it is a fish sanctuary from jan to may. 2. The Red Creek, Brown Brook and Green river are open but flow into said sanctuary.  Question, can one fish any of these waterways and at what point could a line be drawn as to where the sanctuary would start?  "
847696,HTHM,2014-04-14 02:50:00,4082,"The limit should be, logically speaking at the mouths of the tributaries i would think,"
847725,mike rousseau,2014-04-14 11:54:00,4661,In some regs the mouth would be considered part of the main (closed) river up to the first bridge/obstruction on the smaller river/creek  That's how the NY tribs are on the st lawrence...
847727,BillM,2014-04-14 11:59:00,17367,You better call the local CO before getting nailed for fishing a sanctuary    I would guess that once the river ends and opens up into the 'mouth' you're technically fishing the main river and not the trib anymore.
847844,Fisherman,2014-04-14 19:54:00,7201,"Like the others said, Red Creek would most likely be along the imaginary continuing line on the right (west) side of Blue River.  the other two cold be the same or may go upstream to where the shown pools end.  Further check in the regs states if it's not listed, check with your local MNR office."
847846,Sinker,2014-04-14 19:58:00,8692,"I'd consider it all one watershed, and all one sanctuary.  S."
847895,Canuck2fan,2014-04-14 22:19:00,1444,In my limited experience boundaries are where one C/O says there are on any given day... I would be very interested to see what 3 independently contacted MNR officials say about this situation. The reason is I have been fishing a WELL known river and been told 2 different starting areas for the a sanctuary by 2 C\O's in the same week LOL. The difference was only about 10yds but the second C\O was letting people fish where the first one claimed it would have been a fine?
847921,fishindevil,2014-04-14 23:55:00,6254,Isn't the law no fishing within 300yrds of a sanctuary ??
847930,BillM,2014-04-15 01:12:00,17367,"Isn't the law no fishing within 300yrds of a sanctuary ??  Depends on the regulations, this will be stated in the exceptions for that specific FMZ if there is a 300yrd boundary (or other that applies)"
847967,solopaddler,2014-04-15 03:49:00,8605,Rivers that are closed from Jan-May in Ontario are generally closed to protect spawning rainbow trout. I've never heard of any scenario where smaller trib's of bigger rivers were open to angling.  I'd be curious to know what species of fish you plan on targetting in these smaller rivers.

847985,BillM,2014-04-15 11:35:00,17367,"Like Mike stated, unless those rivers are in the exceptions as being open, they are closed until opener...."
847993,snoozer,2014-04-15 12:17:00,7,"In FMZ 17 the Otonabee River is a sanctuary from Lock 19 in Peterborough to Bensfort  Bridge until the 3rd Saturday in May. There are several tributaries along that stretch of river that are open to angling all year for panfish and coarse fish, as well as game fish when their respective seasons open. Having said that, I have no idea how close to the main river you could get before the law deems you too close, especially at this time of year when the mouths are flooded."

848018,Dara,2014-04-15 15:02:00,3052,If it was legal...there would already be a hundred people fishing it
848023,Sinker,2014-04-15 15:16:00,8692," Thats pretty clear if you ask me. Otonabee river between lock 19 and bensfort bridge. The intent of the regulation is to protect spawning walleye....right?  The intent of a river being a sanctuary is to protect spawning fish, no? So, with that said, if only the main river is mentioned in the regs, that would lead ME to believe the whole watershed is a sanctuary to protect whatever fish are spawning. If those fish can run the tributaries, they would (read should) be closed to fishing as well.   IN MY OPINION  S."
848056,snoozer,2014-04-15 17:39:00,7,"Actually some of these tributaries become trout streams not too far away from the Otonabee, and since trout season opens nearly a month before the sanctuary ends closing the entire watershed would make as much sense as closing an entire lake because the season for one species is closed. I think that in this case there are factors such as lack of access and very marshy conditions near the main river that have kept this from becoming a problem."
848066,Sinker,2014-04-15 18:42:00,8692,"Thats my point. The otonabee is clearly ONLY a sanctuary from LOCK 19 to  BENSFORT BRIDGE.  Pretty clear, right?  IF it said Otonabee River closed from Feb-april that would be a different story.  The rest of the grey areas are grey for a reason.  Understand what I'm saying?  S."
