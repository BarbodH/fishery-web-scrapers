847662,chris.brock,2014-04-14 01:19:00,4053,Anything going on? Is it worth stopping by next Friday (Good Friday)? thanks
847668,irishfield,2014-04-14 01:25:00,26272,Drove by there  yesterday.. river is so swollen and flooded you'd think Parks Canada would crack the slushes open on the locks to eaze some flow / flooding.
847695,Entropy,2014-04-14 02:43:00,747,"Lindsay locks are the same.  Went there to check for the run.  Can't see much in the shallows, but there is lots of water gushing through.  I did see a couple of people looking at the water on the down side of the lock, .....  Entropy"

I have never seen the water that high there in my life, it's up to the house on the right hand side, right to their block wall, deck."

847740,Shloim,2014-04-14 13:17:00,515,I hear in a lot of government depts.  the old guys are retiring snd new people are running things . The new guys aren't as experienced as the old guys were.... Not sure how true it is but I heard somebody talking about it
847800,irishfield,2014-04-14 17:06:00,26272,Yep.. them old guys always know more about spawning !
847835,musky666,2014-04-14 19:28:00,126,Drove by on the highway yesterday Irish and thought the same thing- why not use the locks to flow more water downstream? Talbot is sooo over its banks...
847852,irishfield,2014-04-14 20:06:00,26272,At least use the canal as a reservoir to fill during the day.. and drain when it's cooler at night..
