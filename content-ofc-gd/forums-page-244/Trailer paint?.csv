847278,scugpg,2014-04-11 23:00:00,1373,I'm going to sand and touch up my boat trailer which is painted white and made of steel. Was wondering what spray paint you guys would recommend for holding up for a few years?  Thanks
847279,HTHM,2014-04-11 23:02:00,4082,Rustoleum over primer. If you really want it to last powder coat. $$$$

847303,wormdunker,2014-04-12 02:43:00,1711,"I tried tremclad, didn't last 6 months, armour coat same thing.  So I figured I'd try Plasti dip from Home Hardware.  It didn't last 4 months, even after I removed 98% of the old paint & rust with a knotted wire brush on my grinder.  (lottsa elbow grease).  Plasti dip is $20.00 per spray can, figured it was the cure - nope!  Home Hardware did refund the 100 bux (5 spray cans, numerous coats I spent on paint.  Now I have to wire brush it again.  I'm going to search out a coating at Dura Coat in Hamilton.  I've been told they have a good product - but expensive."

847317,aplumma,2014-04-12 12:07:00,6896,Sand blasting with an epoxy based paint should be the ticket. It will cost you a lot of time and some money so check over the trailer to see if it really is worth it.   Art

847434,Rob,2014-04-12 23:47:00,467,Por 15 works great but will fade if you don't use the uv protector over top. But that paint loves rust and will hold really well. Its not cheap though.  Rob C
847477,musky666,2014-04-13 10:11:00,126,My father used to scrape and touch up my steel trailer every summer for me- got me this far at least but now I am looking to replace the 16 year old trailer- about $2000 for a galvanized ride from Excaliber- gonna bite the bullet and not worry about rust anymore. I trailer too much to worry about repainting etc and stone chips just start the process over again.
847482,scugpg,2014-04-13 11:28:00,1373,"thanks all. its not much rust, just a bit below the carpeted steps on the trailer. Spraying might be a bit of a pain so I'm thinking of brushing on. it will likely last me at least 5yrs with my light use and by that time might go with a new trailer.  what kind of brush could I use to keep stroke lines to a minimum?  Thanks"
847511,chefboi17,2014-04-13 13:41:00,128,You could probably use a roller for the large coverage areas

Should be here early next week.  Hopefully my rusted trailer will be a thing of the past.  Once my painting is completed I'll shoot you guys an update."
