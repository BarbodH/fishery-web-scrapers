847512,mike rousseau,2014-04-13 13:42:00,4661,Good morning...  So I'm experiencing a clunk while rolling slow in reverse...  Usually first drive of the day backing outta the driveway...  Feels like someone hitting my frame on the rear end with a hammer...  Them I'm usually good for the rest of the day
847517,Freshtrax,2014-04-13 13:50:00,2215,Mine did that when I had a snapped leaf spring.
847521,archer379,2014-04-13 13:59:00,277,U joint maybe
847537,Muskieman,2014-04-13 16:22:00,2472,Rear disc or drum ?
847538,Muskieman,2014-04-13 16:24:00,2472,"Rear disc or drum ? Often the e-break shoes( rear disc ) fall apart and make noise especially in reverse , common on the f150"
847559,blarg,2014-04-13 17:53:00,289,U joint maybe I think thats a common complaint on the f150
847568,Mike the Pike,2014-04-13 19:29:00,3421,same problem on my Odyssey Mike Mechanic says its a sensor that has to be changed not sure about your truck though
847573,Bernie,2014-04-13 19:47:00,3190,If the noise is higher pitched and almost a clanging noise it's most likely a bad U Joint. Two piece driveshafts where the slip sleeve rides over the front section can also stick on the splines. Some have a grease fitting.  Also run across leaf springs sticking on one another and when the body weight shifts they let go and make a racket.
847591,Sinker,2014-04-13 21:00:00,8692,I was thinking brakes too....  S.
847602,mike rousseau,2014-04-13 21:46:00,4661,I changed the pads and calipers and still getting the clunk...  Might do shoes ... My ebrake light has been lighting up off and on lately....
847848,Sinker,2014-04-14 20:02:00,8692,My money is on your E-brake.  S.
847863,mike rousseau,2014-04-14 20:19:00,4661,That's what I'm gunna try next
848199,mike rousseau,2014-04-16 04:16:00,4661,So I got to thinking...  If we are thinking ebrake... And it clunks in reverse... The why not apply the e brake in reverse????  BANG!!!!!  Rear end locked up and even after releasing the ebrake it wouldn't reverse... I hade to go in foreword first then reverse...  Looks like she's getting me shoes for Easter... Lol   Thanks everyone

848227,Big Cliff,2014-04-16 12:45:00,6899,Glad you got it figured out!
848249,Beans,2014-04-16 14:55:00,3339,"With my old (1995) F150 I would get that ""BANG"" at the back when I stepped on the gas after coasting to a stop and the light changed to green...figured it had sumpin' to do with the transmission...  It's gone to the big scrap yard in the sky now..."
