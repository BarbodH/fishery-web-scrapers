847417,leaf4,2014-04-12 23:14:00,2466,"awesome thanks I'll have to keep them in mind if something happens, I've been told by a few people that a lot of the parts are able to be used off of weed wackers & other small engines, so that could be helpful lol.  and it only weighs12 pounds! great little motor for the price I got it for they were also made in 2.7 and I think a 4.5, kinda noisy but it'll do the job"
847446,Weeds,2014-04-13 00:33:00,782,"I've got an identical motor I believe, but a game fisher 1.2. I think they were also sold under another name as well.  It's my understanding that certain parts are no longer made for these motors and others are difficult to find. Air cooled which is pretty cool though..."
