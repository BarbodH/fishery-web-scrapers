Up at 2:30am and on the ice at 7am after a few pit stops.The day started off slow, landed a few 12""ers and finally hooked into something big....so I thought. Turns out I had hooked a skinny laker in the tail. I thought I had a 15lb'er on by the way it was fighting. 1/2hr later, I hook up with something with some size to it. After a lengthy battle, a nice northern lake trout surfaced! Wow, they fight like crazy here!!Everyone landed fish today which was awesome! Big thanks to my fellow Bass Magnet Lures pro-staffers Michael McNaught and Matthew Heayn for a great day out there! Bass Magnet Lures supplied the Simcoe Pearl which was my ""go-to"" tube today. It got every fish for me that day.      "
