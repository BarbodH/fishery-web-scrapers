You think a tank base is going to destroy a lake but a river running THROUGH an active base will somehow remain untouched?   Seriously man?  Apples and oranges?  Really?  If Borden was that big of an impact to the Notty.... or the Pine.....or the Mad don't you think we would have seen it by now?  You keep saying 'lack of merit'  If you want examples just look at your silly replies.  Did I or anyone say that it will destroy the lake? I don't recall reading that or saying that. Will it have some effect on it? Yah I would think it would. What would the affect be? Who really knows. There are lots of pieces of land for sale that aren't adjacent to a well used waterway where the effect would most certainly be nothing. Put it there. There are lots of properties for sale. No need for it to go in that specific place. You can't possibly think that you know or understand ever single fragment of the information with regards to waterways, fisheries and preservation do you?  Personally I think you are taking something way too personally about a location that apparently you care nothing about. I would think the reaction locally would be exactly the same if any large corp wanted to buy up 1700 acres on ANY lake in ontario. As for it being a ""Not in my bvackyard"" thing. Well yes that is exactly what it is. Noone locally wants it. Even the owner of the property doesn't want to sell it to someone that is going to potentially destroy the property."

We have so much pristine water here. Why go the route of other countries and leave ourselves open to the potential of destroying even one piece. It just doesn't make sense. The potential is there for damage, to say otherwise is nieve and narrow. Besides we have bigger concerns like who is the next captain assuming its not phaneuf. haha"

Prior to the decision, the company hosted an information session at the Harcourt Community Centre in February and were part of the public planning meeting in March at the Haliburton Legion. Both events gave the public a chance to voice their opinions about the proposal and ask questions. The municipality also accepted written letters from the public, most of which expressed opposition to the project.Founded in 1997, Armatec provides military with ""holistic survivability solutions for both wheeled and tracked armoured vehicles."" The company planned on building the testing facility on a property south of Elephant Lake Road and east of Benoir Lake Road. It would have included an administration centre, two storage facilities, a primary research and testing area and mobility test area for vehicles.“The process was very interesting,"" said Karl Pfister, president and CEO of Armatec. ""We had considered that site precisely because it allowed for a win-win solution.""Pfister said the facility would have initially brought five well-paying, full-time jobs to the area with an additional 10 jobs available once fully operational.""It is my opinion that the township has missed an opportunity here as this would have been an economic benefit to the area,"" said Pfister.According to the press release, Armatec has been approached by other municipalities interested in having the test site in their community.

Benoir is an important spawning place for the lake chain, there could be no ill effect, or it could be terrible, the point is we don't know. If you look up survivability testing, it's driving tanks and APCs across large trails, as well as detonating explosives beneath them. Before I could say the lakes would NOT suffer at all, there would have to be a lot of proof over large periods of time showing that.  i'm a business man and appreciate job creation.  just another example of nimby'ism.  Armatec will just find another plot of land...and this time they'll make sure they are in a less affluent area ......  I appreciate job creation, but I also appreciate job loss. Tourism is a major economic driver for that area, as is the income provided from the residents that are there for cottaging. If you had a choice between buying a cottage (or booking your hard earned vacation) on a pristine lake that is beautiful and untouched vs a cottage for the same price on a lake with a testing facility beside it, which would you pick? As a result, the visitors to the region go elsewhere and all that income (and redistribution of that income to secondary businesses within the local community) gets displaced to another community. So the question is, is there a net benefit to it hypothetically being built.  I absolutely don't want it in my backyard, for reasons that directly impact me, but also for reasons that impact one of the places I love and the community around it. Hopefully that clears a few things up."

Yeah, because soooooo many people are going to score jobs there.  ""While Fearrey admits that the economic benefit (estimated at five to 15 jobs by Armatec) “isn’t huge” he says""     I'm thinking one major area of concern for locals is the fact that 2,300 acres of land is going to be lost to this testing site which will negatively effect fishing, hunting, sledding, and atving, all thing's that local campground and cottage owners rely on for their income.

Borden was built before the area became populated and tourism wasn't the sole provider of income back then. Times are way different these days in Southern Ontario.

They would be performing survivability tests-ie blowing up tanks and running them through obstacle courses..They have applied for re-zoning and this will be addressed at the council meeting in Haliburton this coming Monday March 3rd at 5pm. If they don't get re-zoning they will go to the OMB. If you are opposed to this, please sign this petition that has been started on Change.org (link below) it would be great to get as many signatures as possible before the council meeting Monday. Armatec has most likely chosen this time to try and push it through as most cottagers are currently away and unaware this is happening.

Heres why: about 30 years ago a plant called Combiboard opened on the Y Road near Birds Creek. Soon people as far away as Fort Stewart and Boulter started complaining about ""THE HUM."" It wasn't a joke, because of rock formations in the area the noise and vibration carried up to at least 30 kms. The problem was only solved when the plant was taken over by Georgia Pacific and proper equipment was installed. So now we have the threat of huge explosions occurring almost under the lake. The fish will be affected, don't know how but they certainly will.""  I'm asking for anyone who's willing to help here to preserve this wonderful fishery and area. Be it signing the petition, writing to the Councillor or forwarding this on to friends and family. I can't think of anything more terrible for the area for both our generation and the next.  I started going to the area as a young boy and while I'm still fairly young it's a special place for me (and a lot of others). A place to get away and relax (and do some serious fishing), and a place that I want to enjoy tank free. Thank you guys for taking the time to read and hopefully help out!  Max"

It's about the perception of a military testing site in the area, the drop in property values and tourism that result from it (as a relator apparently you have to disclose if there is a military site nearby when selling property) and the longterm impact on the area. If the company decides to rezone and expand in the future it will be much harder to stop.  What everyone else hasn't mentioned is the noise of the survivability testing, not just the explosives. They are going to be running tanks and military vehicles through obstacle courses for up to 12 weeks a year.  There are a lot of valid points and concerns here, last night at the council meeting it was recommended by the council that they deny the motion (the vote is later in March).

While I don't agree with some of the comments in the meeting about the war machine, a big piece of this for me is the nature and the proximity to the lake and Algonquin, and the property values in the area. Also, if they chose to expand in the future it will be very easy to do so on that property with unforeseen effects in the future.  Property value wise, there are a lot of good hardworking folks in that area who have spent their whole life building in that area. While the noise may not be as bad as everyone fears the perception will drive down prices in the area resulting in serious effects for residents (and cottagers) there.  Ecologically, there may not be runoff, but what about the survivability testing of running the vehicles through their courses. If you look up some videos of the tests, they're not short and they're VERY loud.  It is also worth noting that the company hasn't actually bought the land yet. They have a conditional offer on it assuming the rezoning goes through and all the studies come back okay. Starting over at a new site would be a pain but not impossible for them.  I see both sides, but I'm strongly with the not in my backyard group."

839720,jedimaster,2014-03-04 23:18:00,3472,Everyone's home/business is in what was someones 'back yard' at one point. The problem the number of backyards like that are not as plentiful as they once were. How much deforestation is acceptable until it's too much? How many backyards need to give way to business?

The benefits I see for not only Canadas prosperity and  both of our military troops improving the safety of our men is worth its weight in gold. I do know how this feels though being I live 45 minutes from Washington D.C. housing the CIA, FBI,ATF and 6 major military bases. We have test sites on top of test sites here.   Art"

Look no further than Bala if you want to see what will happen if business does not move to central Ontario. No gas station, nothing open during the off season months. Worthless trendy junk clothing stores in the summer.  A company has been trying to develop a hydro electric plant there for years now. Would create economic possibilities for the town. But -  The current mayor and council have fought tooth and nail defeat it - bad for the rich people's property values.  So far, their appeals have cost local taxpayers close to $200,000 but the dumb mayor is going to spend more money trying again.  The mayor also turned down a fully funded low income housing development for local people. Said it didn't meet the planning guidelines when it certainly did. She approved a Yoga studio instead....  Now look to Bracebridge. Built a nice hydro plant, incorporated a fish ladder and an interpretive centre. That's the way to do business."
839832,woodenboater,2014-03-05 16:06:00,2277,"approved a Yoga studio instead....    Sounds like what happened in Toronto a few years back. A local yoga studio rallied the neighbourhood (Queen West=trendy, hipster, cool crowd) to fight a proposed Tim Hortons because it didn't fit the character or some kind of Bull. They won. Still bugs me and I don't even live near there.  Regardless, I think in this case, the proposed financial benefits are probably exaggerated to some extent imo. Why plunk this down in a beautiful part of southern Ont when there are plenty of other options available ?"
