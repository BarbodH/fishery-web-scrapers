Started fishing at 0800, trolling west in 6 - 10 feet of water dragging stickbaits.  Some of our 'Shallow' baits began hooking bottom on the lake side, must have been some rocks?????.Trolled an hour west and turned back, changing lures, going to a pattern that worked last year, the Evil Eye spoon. At 0925, the inside board of the shore side fired and the fish jumped right away.  Brought the board in and with only 30 feet behind it, the fish was close. John scooped and the fish was ours.We continued to troll the shoreline with no further results, finishing the day exploring the deeper water to see if the fish had moved out from the shallows with the bright sun, nothing...Took a shot for the history file of the 1st fishing tip of 2014 (Soft-water version)Hit the launch at 1430 and headed home, there were still five other trailers there when we left, it was a very busy ramp.Snapped another shot - just in case.It was a great day to be out on the water, sunny, slight breeze adn to escape the grasps of the long and cold winter made it most enjoyable.Stay Tuned - at Least one more trip before the 3rd of MayDavid  aka  Superdad"
