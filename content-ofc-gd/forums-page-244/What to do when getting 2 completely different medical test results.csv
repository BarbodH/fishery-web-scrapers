Not trusting too much about the system we have, 2 days later he went to the 2nd doctor and was also told to get another ultrasound test done.  1 week later, the 1st doctor told him that he is perfectly fine based on the ultrasound report which stated ""No abnormalies were found"".  1 week + 2 days later, the 2nd doctor told him that he needs to get a CT scan for further analysis based on the 2nd ultrasound report which stated ""Right kidney was found severely swollen"". Even though he was puzzled, he asked the 2nd doctor that how long it would normally take for a kidney to get as swollen as his and the answer was ""At least 2 months"". After the CT scan, he also got a enteroscopy done to determine that he actually got a kidney infection & went on the treatment.  In other words, if he were never to get 2nd ultrasound done, his condition would have gotten worse to the point it might be too late!  My questions are: 1) Who/where can this be reported to for an answer/justice? - want to get actual ultrasound images of each test to figure out whether there was a mistake  by radiologist or mistake by technician who took images  2) Should he always get a 2nd opinion from now on? - it might mean a waste of medical resources"

847942,cram,2014-04-15 01:49:00,1733,Someone made a mistake.  It happens.
847949,TennesseeGuy,2014-04-15 02:22:00,957,"No problems were found with the first test.   Doesn't mean the abnormality wasn't there.  My urologist did a prostate biopsy on me and none of the 13 chunks showed signs of cancer.   Dr. ""Goldfinger"" told me he didn't find cancer cells, but that doesn't mean I don't have them.  Be happy you found the problem and it's being treated."
847953,irishfield,2014-04-15 02:33:00,26272,"I'm still trying to figure out how, in our system, he found two doctors in as many days..  ... Usound.. CT..... all depends on how it was done and from what angle etc. Same reason they have a 10% ""error"" allowance for measuring cancer tumours on growth and shrinkage.  .. and what TG said, be glad it was found and it's being treated and move on."
847966,Duckie,2014-04-15 03:45:00,305,"to be fair here, the mistake was not made by either doctor.  family doctors and specialists do not interpret Ultrasound/ CT results.  this is done by a radiologist, who then sends their interpretation in the form of a report to the physician issuing the request for the tests.  so, yes a radiologist potentially made a mistake.  but it was not either doctor's fault by the sounds of it. they are reporting what they were told."
847972,okumasheffield,2014-04-15 05:53:00,318,"It is interesting you said that. Guess you are suggesting to get the 2nd opinion, JUST IN CASE if someone made a mistake"
847973,okumasheffield,2014-04-15 05:56:00,318,Exactly. Family doctors just reported what they were told.  I am troubled with which radiologist to trust.
