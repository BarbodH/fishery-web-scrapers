848224,Big Cliff,2014-04-16 12:44:00,6899,"Well, we finally have open water in the river and channel down to about the Moorings Marina. Still plenty of ice along the shore line in the main body of the lake. Ice out here is typically about 7-10 days after that so there is a chance that I might be able to get my boat in the water by mid next week. We are easily 4-5 weeks behind the average this year, should make opening for walleye really interesting this year!"
848228,Sinker,2014-04-16 12:49:00,8692,"How is the water level, Cliff?  S."
848231,Big Cliff,2014-04-16 12:52:00,6899,Much lower this year than last! I would say that right now it is probably at very close to summer levels.

Hopefully the trent guys can keep it all under control, but they usually use the tri lakes to hold water back.....then sturg. I also hear flooding has started on the burnt river. Someone told me today 10ft higher than normal...  S."

Hopefully the trent guys can keep it all under control, but they usually use the tri lakes to hold water back.....then sturg.  I was at the Youngs Point locks an hour ago and the water is completely over top of the concrete pier where you tie up the boats while waiting to lock through. Some of the cottages downstream now have water right up almost to their doorsteps and I can only guess it'll get worse before it gets better.  Gonna be plenty of water heading down to Rice Lake yet.  The northern half of Clear Lake now has lots of open water ."
848248,Sinker,2014-04-16 14:50:00,8692,"Rice lake is rising 8cm per day, and will continue to rise for quite a few days yet.  I can only assume the homes/cottages thru campbellford/hastings will be flooded again. I remember a few years ago sandbagging over there for days. Lakefield is flowing full bore as well.  S."

There is nothing more that TSW can do if the levels continue to rise in Scugog.    "
