846839,solopaddler,2014-04-10 02:18:00,8605,"you can never be too cautious, zombies and sasquatches love fresh fish  Rednecks do too. I was fishing in Pennsylvania a few years back and watched from the opposite side of the stream as 3 really rough looking camo clad hillbillies sneaked up behind my buddy and grabbed a trout lying on a snowbank 10' behind him. He had no clue.  One of the funnier things I've seen while fishing."

847096,aplumma,2014-04-10 22:28:00,6896,"Some areas we fish in a side arm is needed, as a kid we always had one in the boat for gators and snakes in the trees. You are running the boat thru canals that are sometimes 8 ft across with a complete canape of trees over your head in Louisiana. A nice tasty gator presents itself and you had gator and fish to fry up.   Art"
