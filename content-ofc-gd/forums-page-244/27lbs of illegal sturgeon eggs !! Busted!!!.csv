848008,ljadug,2014-04-15 14:02:00,11,What about the guy who sold eggs? I bet he never been charged....
848022,Dara,2014-04-15 15:14:00,3052,Here's the local take on it.  Scroll down and read the comments section   http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/details.asp?c=71515
848026,jimmer,2014-04-15 15:22:00,2730,"I was thinking along the same lines as moxie. Make them eat 27 lbs of roe all at once, then watch out!"
848038,ljadug,2014-04-15 16:05:00,11,"Thanks Dara for the link. That was my point exactly. Busting two guys from Richmond Hill will not help much sturgeon population if seller is not punished. Unfortunately I have my doubts it will ever happen, even he clearly broke the law."
848049,Dara,2014-04-15 17:10:00,3052,"Ijadug  I don't believe the seller broke the law.  Treaty rights trump game laws, even endangered species laws.  The buyers broke the law by possesing. And they knew it was illegal.  There is only a reason to sell illegal materials if there is a buyer. Nobody is going to harvest sturgeon eggs if they can't sell them and I know 2 guys that won't be buying them anymore  Same as stolen tools and fishing equipment...if people buy it then other people will steal it"
848052,ljadug,2014-04-15 17:27:00,11,"He broke the law by selling to non-natives(unless I don't understant treaty act). Here is take(very honorable) of one of your local natives from link you provided:  mister p 4/11/2014 8:05:20 PM Reporthe is talking about natives. and yes they do take what they want, when they want it and how they want to take it, it was written in the treaty act, by your government. as a native, I believe that we should be punished and charged in situations like these, those are resources that will never be replenished, and taking advantage of our rights to make a few dollars is idiotic and childish. if it can be proven, whomever supplied the eggs to people who cannot otherwise get them, should be punished just as severe!  Generally when people steal, it is much more effective to go after seller then buyer."
848053,Headhunter,2014-04-15 17:31:00,5703,"Ijadug  I don't believe the seller broke the law.  Treaty rights trump game laws, even endangered species laws.  The buyers broke the law by possesing.

I bet their the market for illegal Sturgeon eggs hads diminished as of late. That's not to say it doesn't still exist, but I bet the rumour mill amongst that crowd has them second guessing their activities. That said, I'm also pretty sure that it won't take long before there are two more who will take their place. I have to wonder though, if those folks who have ""the right"" to catch what they want, when they want it, have any internal discipline, that could inhibit those takers, from selling to the non-entitled? HH"
848058,Dara,2014-04-15 17:46:00,3052,I don't know what the treaty act says.  I see that its fine for natives to sell walleyes out of nip  I do know that the takers in this instance weren't charged. Whether or not this is a lack of intestinal fortitude by the government I have no idea.

847247,manitoubass2,2014-04-11 20:03:00,11391,Wow! Why such a low fine though???
847248,fishindevil,2014-04-11 20:07:00,6254,Ya really should be prison time !!!
847249,misfish,2014-04-11 20:19:00,29133,But they are still allowed to fish??????????????  Thats our system for ya.
847251,dracokaos,2014-04-11 20:34:00,116,i wonder if the fine was low and they are still allowed to fish because they got the eggs and fish from someone. They didn't actually do the poaching. Plus they may have given some info to help nail the guy who they got it from...
847252,misfish,2014-04-11 20:43:00,29133,i wonder if the fine was low and they are still allowed to fish because they got the eggs and fish from someone. They didn't actually do the poaching. Plus they may have given some info to help nail the guy who they got it from...   Like I said            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Our system.  I dont give a rats  They were part of the on goings.   GUILTY
847259,BucktownAngler,2014-04-11 21:37:00,582,since when is 10k low?  i've seen poachers get fined way less
847260,BucktownAngler,2014-04-11 21:39:00,582,Ya really should be prison time !!!  LOL
847261,misfish,2014-04-11 21:49:00,29133,"since when is 10k low?  i've seen poachers get fined way less  $10,000 is a hefty fine IMO  BUT  Why do they get to keep fishing?  3-5 year fishing ban should of been added as well IMO."
847264,fishindevil,2014-04-11 22:10:00,6254,Lifetime ban !!!! Never mind 3-5 !!!!
847266,misfish,2014-04-11 22:20:00,29133,Lifetime ban !!!! Never mind 3-5 !!!!  Now we both know that a life time ban would only mean they would fish again. Nothing more to lose but cash and fishing gear.
847268,porkpie,2014-04-11 22:22:00,2521,"10k a piece for possession of roe and meat is pretty hefty.  It reads to me that the only offence is possessing it, and that they sourced the fish and eggs from another party.  Pretty hard to ban them from fishing when you can't prove they obtained the roe from angling!  Seriously though, people suggesting jail time for fisheries offences is a bit over the top.  A 10k fine is pretty stiff for that sort of charge."
847270,kickingfrog,2014-04-11 22:25:00,8333,I understand the symbolism but Poachers aren't going to care if they have their licences revoked.
847271,misfish,2014-04-11 22:27:00,29133,"10k a piece for possession of roe and meat is pretty hefty.

A 10k fine is pretty stiff for that sort of charge.  Jail time I can understand that point. Not going to happen. They were caught in a fish and game act. Give the stiffest fine possible,which means,add ban of fishing too."
847275,redpearl99,2014-04-11 22:47:00,259,you cant possess sturgeon eggs at all????  what about the ones I can buy at the St. Lawrence Market??
847276,manitoubass2,2014-04-11 22:55:00,11391,
847293,Vtucciarone,2014-04-12 00:06:00,38,I think giving them 10 years of mandatory community service geared towards fishery enhancement would be more beneficial. The 20 thousand in fines will never make it back into improving the fishery and a prison sentence   will only end up costing us way more.
847295,BowSlayer101,2014-04-12 00:41:00,296,"should have been fined waaay more IMO, they could have sold those eggs illegally, which they most likely would, they would easily make $250 for 100 gram of roe, they had 27 pounds of the stuff! You be the judge, i think a 3-5 years ban would be fair but they would most likely keep fishing illegally."
847296,BowSlayer101,2014-04-12 00:42:00,296,you cant possess sturgeon eggs at all????  what about the ones I can buy at the St. Lawrence Market?? you can buy them but you can't catch a sturgeon and take the eggs.
847300,Christopheraaron,2014-04-12 01:48:00,3525,"you cant possess sturgeon eggs at all????  what about the ones I can buy at the St. Lawrence Market?? Those are farmed with a license, you can't catch and sell sturgeon or any protected species in Ontario."
847301,BowSlayer101,2014-04-12 01:52:00,296,"Those are farmed with a license, you can't catch and sell sturgeon or any protected species in Ontario. or shipped from Europe....."
847370,ch312,2014-04-12 19:19:00,1590,"$10k each isn't enough and the fines should have been higher with jail time? People, they are FISH. It's not like they committed crimes against other humans.   As for lifetime fishing bans, that wouldn't solve anything. If they knowingly broke the law, why on earth would an order not to fish somehow stop them?"
847707,Maverick,2014-04-14 03:18:00,371,"Just sever their right hands and be done with it, if that doesn't learn them then there's always the left  But seriously, the charges should be similar to drug charges. You get a smaller sentence if it's under a certain amount and a larger sentence if you have intent to traffic. With the quantities these guys had, they didn't have it for personal consumption, the intent to sell is surely there. Should be a stiffer punishment for sure."
847898,moxie,2014-04-14 22:24:00,1566,How about they were tied up and forced to eat the roe and raw meat until they stopped moving? No need to waste dollars housing them in a corrections spa or need to revoke fishing privileges or worry about them being a party to such endeavours again.
847926,Gallie,2014-04-15 01:00:00,1215,"You know, i dont think i agree with a few of the things you say(it happens) but i love this idea. At least it wont go to waste..."
