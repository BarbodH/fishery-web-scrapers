848308,lew,2014-04-16 19:08:00,12766,Lots of water flowing through the Trent System now and it could cause even more problems as it increases down stream.  I took these at Burleigh Falls earlier today            And this is the old bridge and lock at Youngs Point with parts of it completely under water.    
848309,knightfisher,2014-04-16 19:14:00,237,Wow that is high. Fished the area lots in the past. Daughter also swam the falls with the locals when she was younger.
848313,jimmer,2014-04-16 19:32:00,2730,Holy!
848317,Sinker,2014-04-16 19:52:00,8692,"Yep, its coming folks. If your on a flood plain, prepare.  We're approaching record water levels in most watersheds right now.  Cool pics Lew! Thanks for sharing. It would be cool to see the change over the weekend.  S."
848320,lew,2014-04-16 19:59:00,12766,It's too bad the camera doesn't capture the power or size of the waves cause it's actually far rougher  than it looks here.
848322,Sinker,2014-04-16 20:00:00,8692,Take a video  S.
848325,lew,2014-04-16 20:13:00,12766,Maybe I'll go up in a few days when the waters higher and see if I can figure how to work the video on my camera.
848328,chris.brock,2014-04-16 20:54:00,4053,"bring your canoe and shoot video while you run the rapid  you guys likely have this, if not, here's a cool site for Trent Severn water levels  http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/on/trentsevern/visit/ne-wl/trent_e.asp"
848331,esoxansteel,2014-04-16 21:02:00,1307,"Wheres your Kayak Lew, you could speed troll, about 6 weeks early"
848332,davey buoy,2014-04-16 21:06:00,5505,And to think this is only the start for most.Take care people and listen to the warnings .
848333,lew,2014-04-16 21:07:00,12766,"We used to run those rapids on an air mattress 50 odd years ago, course it wasn't quite as rough LOL  Thanks for that link chris"
848344,Big Cliff,2014-04-16 21:57:00,6899,Didn't you get some pictures last year? It would be interesting to see how they compair to where it is at right now.
848348,lew,2014-04-16 22:34:00,12766,"Didn't you get some pictures last year? It would be interesting to see how they compair to where it is at right now.  You've got a good memory Cliff.  Here's the same place a year ago and it's alot calmer        And just for comparison, here it is mid-winter      "
848353,OhioFisherman,2014-04-16 23:23:00,6623,"Consider yourself lucky, any water that is moving that fast here is definitely brown. You probably wouldn't be able to see concrete on the locks if the water was more than an inch or two deep."
848378,captpierre,2014-04-17 01:01:00,2521,Looks just as bad as last year  good thing we had a cold snap
848379,captpierre,2014-04-17 01:04:00,2521,check this out for the area  http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/on/trentsevern/visit/ne-wl/trent_e.asp
848380,SirCranksalot,2014-04-17 01:11:00,3291,Those dumb hydro guys---putting poles in the middle of the river!!
848397,4x4bassin,2014-04-17 03:44:00,1025,"Those are some impressive pictures Lew .That is an ""angry"" river right there ! Looks a little worse then last years pictures."
848411,mattybculp,2014-04-17 11:14:00,388,Last night I loaded up and dropped about 100 sandbags at buddy of mines place on lower chemong. The water is on his front lawn and won't be long until it's right at his house. Pretty scary stuff.
