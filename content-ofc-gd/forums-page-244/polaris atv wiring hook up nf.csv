847445,mr blizzard,2014-04-13 00:33:00,1589,Quick question  My son replaced our atv battery last spring.  The battery froze and we just replaced it with an agm.  Our hand warmers used to work but now they do not.  I think he has hooked up some wiring to the battery wrong.  Question....there is a wire that is half red and half black...which terminal should it go on.  Thanks for any assistance Blizz

Other than that, it's a Polaris, bottom of the totem pole for reliabilty and quality.  Sorry."

847476,wormdunker,2014-04-13 10:04:00,1711,I installed hand warmers on my 2012 Polaris 500 this past winter.  They work great.  All the wiring from the warmers are installed to an existing harness inside the headlight pod.  No wires go to the battery.
