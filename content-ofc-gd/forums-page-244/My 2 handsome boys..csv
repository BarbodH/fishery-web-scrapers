We even got a couple of small ones when the sun went down.

Thanks man,  I use a second hand Canon Powershot SD960 IS Digital Elph. I got sand in the last one this summer  and because they are discontinued I picked up another on Ebay for $35. Really,really, really good little point and shoot cameras with HD Video. Optical zoom is crap at only 4x, but has some good preset shooting options. Shooting sunsets in 'underwater' mode…..WOW!"

847738,bigugli,2014-04-14 13:04:00,6138,Watching the pics and video of your lad growing up has me green with envy. I know it sounds selfish but  ..... Just sometimes wish my kids would hurry up and make with the grandkids
847744,Jds63,2014-04-14 13:41:00,1365,Great photos Simon ... looks like ice out will be in June ... LOL
847775,fishnsled,2014-04-14 16:00:00,3520,"Great photos Simon!  What is your prediction for ice out up there?  How much ice is there?  I've got a fly in trip booked and concerned that the ice will still be on the lake at the end of May, hence the questions."
847784,Moosebunk,2014-04-14 16:28:00,3970,Crisp photos Simon.  Lotsa reds in those skies and on the lad's head.
