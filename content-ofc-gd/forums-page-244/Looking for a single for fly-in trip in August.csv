843189,forgop,2014-03-24 23:03:00,9,"So, I'm new here and came across this site via Mike Borger.  Mike has some great reviews and is really helpful guy when it comes to trying to plan for my trip.  I've put down a deposit at Anjigaming Lake for the week of Aug 9-16 with Parks and will be flying out of Wawa.  .  We had a 4th member of our group bow out due to a wedding and we need a 4th.  The 3 of us so far are my cousin and I (both 39) and his step father (just turned 70) and we're all from north central Indiana.  His step father (Smitty) has been going on fly-in trips since '67 all through Air Ivanhoe.  Once he saw Mike's reviews, he's been convinced to make a trip with a different outfitter.  My cousin will meet at my house in Indianapolis and will venture a bit north to pick up Smitty, so you could join us at any point along the route.  We're all easy to get along with and will enjoy some cigars and beer...maybe even some good bourbon.  May play some cards if time permits and we've called it an evening off the water, but we do like to hit the water for most of the day.  Might even give it a shot to see if anything is hitting after dark as well.  Here is one of Mike's reviews in case you need a reminder: http://www.canadafishingguide.net/the-land-of-giant-walleye-anjigaming-lake-fly-in/  Pricing info from Parks here: http://www.outpostcamps.com/fishing/  Smitty has a group of ~ 10 guys that have been going on annual trips and he has yet to really ask if any of his normal group can be our 4th, so we're looking for a backup in case someone within our inner circle so to speak is unable to go.  We know several people who want to go, but just can't due to work or fear of even asking their wife.  Smitty's normal group is going up 2 weeks after we get back, so he's unsure if anyone could go twice in less than a month like he is.  If you're interested, please send me a PM and a bit about yourself.  It'll be a good trip.  Thanks."

I'm not that far from your leaving point, in fact I drive through Indy on my way to Northwest Ontario. Heck I've even been known to meet up with total strangers miles and miles from home just to go fishing lol.  Good luck in your search"

845754,solopaddler,2014-04-05 13:22:00,8605,"FWIW, Duane just sent me a package as thanks for helping him. A bunch of really primo hand rolled cigars and a couple of big bags of exotic coffee beans that smell absolutely fantastic.  Thank you sir!  The man is a true gentleman and I wouldn't hesitate to take him up on his offer if I could."
848252,forgop,2014-04-16 15:09:00,9,Bump again. Anyone?
