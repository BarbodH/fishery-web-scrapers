848010,BillM,2014-04-15 14:23:00,17367,Going to replace all the standard sidemarker/clearance lights on the Shoreland'r trailer and was wondering if anyone had a local source for these instead of me ordering them from the US?
848015,outllaw,2014-04-15 14:39:00,1232,any trailer shop locally or princess auto ...tsc supply
848016,BillM,2014-04-15 14:40:00,17367,"Good call on TSC, didn't even think of that one    I'll check PA as well."
848024,Sinker,2014-04-15 15:18:00,8692,Eastons  What did you end up doing with your axle?  S.
848025,BillM,2014-04-15 15:19:00,17367,"Eastons  What did you end up doing with your axle?  S.  Frame shop straightened it out.   Two new tires later and we are all good, lol."
848032,Fang,2014-04-15 15:46:00,1330,I've bought bits and pieces from Princess Auto as they've been putting various LED trailer lights on sale over the winter. Just have to replace the running lights and I'm done.  The 12V rectangle submersible LED kit is on sale now on the web. Not sure about in store  http://www.princessauto.com/pal/en/Light-Kits/12V-Submersible-LED-Trailer-Light-Kit/8434235.p
848033,BillM,2014-04-15 15:50:00,17367,"I've already got the LED tail lights on the trailer (they work great BTW), problem is the clearance lights are a pretty specific size..   I'll run by there and take a look today."
848046,RickOnt,2014-04-15 16:55:00,669,"Fang Thanks for that info, 50% off!!   Just ordered a set.  and Bill for the recommendation"
848047,BillM,2014-04-15 17:07:00,17367,"Rick, they bolted right up to the stock holes I had them installed in about 15 mins, lol.  Only thing  I did was bend a piece of aluminum from the back mounting plate around to the side to protect the back/corner of the lights from rocks off the tires.   They stuck out a wee bit further then the stock lights so they were kinda out in the open a bit."
848091,RickOnt,2014-04-15 20:09:00,669,OK Thanks Bill  I will check that out
848147,206,2014-04-16 00:45:00,563,SOLD OUT   wish i seen this earlier lol
848151,BillM,2014-04-16 00:56:00,17367,"Just got back from Princess Auto, their LED selection gets better and better anytime I go there.  Had EXACTLY what I needed, I couldn't believe it.  Also lots of the rear LED lights that are on sale as well if anyone in and around Barrie needs a set.  Now I need some auxilary LED back up lights for the truck that I can put under the rear bumper for those pitch black boat ramps!"
