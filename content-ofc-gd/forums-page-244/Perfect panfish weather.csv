Got to give a lot of our crappie jigs a workout, but in the muddy water, blacks were the preferred jig. Lots of crappie, bull gills and perch. . This sink load Saturday night made for a great shore brekkie this morning.  The younger crowd is still out fishing, but I needed a rest. It's a long walk carrying a bucket full of fish back to the car. Legs just don't work like they used to"
847640,tender52,2014-04-14 00:13:00,270,Make sure the younger crowd still have enough energy to clean fish
847643,dhickey,2014-04-14 00:17:00,1038,Nice Good catch.
847644,stasbrute,2014-04-14 00:27:00,206,"Very nice I tried one of my spots Niagara way on Friday, and nuttin biting, glad you got some"

847647,Locnar,2014-04-14 00:35:00,645,"Well done! I tried one of my go-to rivers, but she was bursting her banks and flowing like crazy. I got a big ol skunk and a cold, wet foot."
847648,EC1,2014-04-14 00:37:00,930,First softwater panfish report. Nice! I can see the lakes close to Lake O getting ready soon enough!
847666,crappieperchhunter,2014-04-14 01:24:00,2582,I'm gonna have to get down there sometime Bruce. Nice report
847670,Joeytier,2014-04-14 01:27:00,3990,Looks delicious.  Outrageously jealous over here
847671,Maverick,2014-04-14 01:30:00,371,That's a nice bucket of fish!
847689,pairofgreenhorns,2014-04-14 02:26:00,133,Nice outing and an even better brekkie i bet! Well done
847703,Nipfisher,2014-04-14 03:02:00,2449,We catch 100 sunfish/blue gills an hour off the dock in the late spring and I have never thought of cleaning one.

Only worth it if you are keeping the big bulls in 7-10"" size.  Flesh is tastier, and firmer, than the crappie. At least the smaller gills aren't too interested in the crappie jigs"
847714,crappieperchhunter,2014-04-14 09:28:00,2582,"Flesh is tastier, and firmer, than the crappie. X2. I love catching crappie...but if I'm catching both all the crappie get released because the gills are just that much better tasting."
847715,wormdunker,2014-04-14 09:32:00,1711,Nice looking crappies!  Thanx for posting pix.
847717,Musky or Specks,2014-04-14 09:42:00,2710,Tasty catch
847736,akaShag,2014-04-14 13:00:00,2073,"They are ALL good, that's why they call them PANfish!  The smaller bluegills are certainly worth filleting to make a fish chowder, yum yum!  Doug"
847751,Beans,2014-04-14 14:42:00,3339,X2. I love catching crappie...but if I'm catching both all the crappie get released because the gills are just that much better tasting.  Hey CPH...you sound like Uncle Dave...
