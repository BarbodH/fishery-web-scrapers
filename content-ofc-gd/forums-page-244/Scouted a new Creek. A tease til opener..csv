847532,misfish,2014-04-13 16:03:00,29133,"Plan this morning was to look for some open shore for perch,but that went bust. Then I hit a spot that had some great picture taking,so did that for an hour or so.  Thinking about this up coming trout opener,I decided to go scouting.   I have been going through some maps of different townships looking for new trout waters to fish. I found one that looked like it would have public access,but not that many would know it was. So off I was this with plan C thismorning to see if it was worthy of a travel.  Walking through some bush and deep snow areas,I found water. And some real nice water. Clear as gin,Nice wood structure and pools.  Anyways. This is just a tease til opener. I dont even know if there is trout in it.LOL                        Time to get all my fly stuff together.  And NO,this is not the creek you think Rob.LOL"

847546,Ralph Field,2014-04-13 16:47:00,1018,"well worth exploring ,once the season begins. The walking looks like a chore."
847548,misfish,2014-04-13 16:50:00,29133,"well worth exploring ,once the season begins. The walking looks like a chore.  Nothing like a back pack full of cold pizza slices and some OJ when doing these long treks Ralph."
847550,davey buoy,2014-04-13 17:03:00,5505,"Oh ya!!Pristine water there bud,I'm sure there is a little something in there.Nice find!!"
847564,kickingfrog,2014-04-13 18:33:00,8333,"   And NO,this is not the creek you think Rob.LOL  I do know more than one."
847565,misfish,2014-04-13 18:42:00,29133, I do know more than one.  Noted. LOL  Go Colts.
847581,Rob,2014-04-13 20:24:00,467,Oh yes it is! I recognize that log going across the creek that is now a river!  Rob C
847583,EC1,2014-04-13 20:28:00,930,"Looks good if you ask me! Don't go trooting myself, but would like to see what you pull out of it! Finding your own is so rewarding!"
847585,misfish,2014-04-13 20:38:00,29133,Oh yes it is! I recognize that log going across the creek that is now a river!  Rob C  Wrong Rob.LOL  Hope alls well bud.  Did you find the perch?
847621,esoxansteel,2014-04-13 23:03:00,1307,"Couple of weeks to hone your roll casting skills Brian, looks a little tight in there, but very trouty"
847623,irishfield,2014-04-13 23:08:00,26272,You sure that's a creek and not just melt runoff... kinda looks like each side of my runway...
847626,dave524,2014-04-13 23:15:00,4508,"You sure that's a creek and not just melt runoff... kinda looks like each side of my runway...  I didn't want to be the first to rain on your parade Misfish, but I was thinking the same thing. Is it marked as a creek on a top sheet? or are you familiar with it say on Aug 1st. flow levels."
847638,FloatnFly,2014-04-14 00:06:00,1640,"if it connects to the lake, you're golden, people don't fish a lot of the small feeder creeks, but they're usually the gems"
847655,Christopheraaron,2014-04-14 00:53:00,3525," I didn't want to be the first to rain on your parade Misfish, but I was thinking the same thing. Is it marked as a creek on a top sheet? or are you familiar with it say on Aug 1st. flow levels. Na that's definitely a creek, there's a defined river bottom down there. Great find there Brian! Now I suppose you need some royal wulffs and humpies right? LOL"
847678,BillM,2014-04-14 02:01:00,17367,That creek will be a trickle once all the snow melt is done
847719,misfish,2014-04-14 10:02:00,29133,"There are enough deep pools to hold fish once the higher waters drop. Yes it is a feeder creek to a lake.  It might even be spring fed.There is another I will be checking out. Spring fed as well. That one for sure I know should hold specks as I have caught them on joining creeks,  Yes I will need to be practicing my roll cast.  I,ll get back to you Chris.LOL"
847804,Headhunter,2014-04-14 17:17:00,5703,That creek should hold some decent bait Brian! I can't imagine fighting all that bush for an opportuntity to hook into bait! But that's just me! HH
847806,Moosebunk,2014-04-14 17:19:00,3970,Fish'er and find out dood!  That's the only answer to your creek question Brian.
