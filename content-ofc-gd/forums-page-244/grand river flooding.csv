847090,Raf,2014-04-10 21:51:00,3495,Lady Grand breached her banks here in town (Grand Valley) today.  I suspect they'll be closing 25 shortly as there's already water over the road and it's just rising.  Hopefully Belwood / Shand Dam can handle all the water to avoid flooding down below

847094,BillM,2014-04-10 22:26:00,17367,Going to be lots and lots and lots of flooding after these warms temps!   Notty will bust over the banks in the next few days I'm sure in some places.

847371,ch312,2014-04-12 19:22:00,1590,"The Grand in Brantford has remained surprisingly low considering how much snow there was around here. Some area's are a bit flooded, but I have seen it much higher during the summer months after heavy rainfall.  Let's hope it stays that way."

847833,Raf,2014-04-14 19:27:00,3495,"this was in town this wknd        i know west montrose was flooded pretty bad this wknd too.  the grca is saying their reservoirs are at capacity now so they have no choice but to open them up.. possibly affecting those downstreams of the dams.  there's still a bit of snow pack left up here and likely more up at dundalk area so while the bulk of the melt is done, it's not over yet.  the rains this wknd really did not help matters and they're calling for 5 cms of snow tomorrow plus 10mm of rain overnight."
