641627,Mike the Pike,2011-11-21 01:47:00,3421,OMG its going to be a tough one my friend.  Was one of my worst trips in the 6 years going to BOQ in November.  Mostly high winds since last Thursday.The Shad are more than abundant.  I know how to catch walleye in November but this year was the toughest.NO takers for 3 days of fishing.  Did not take the boat out this morning as there were 6 foot plus waves in Adolphus Reach.  I could  could see hundreds of thousands of tiny shad in Picton Harbour for the entire time we were there.  Right now they are well fed.Now we know of one OFNer whou caught a nice double digit but we will let him post it.  Someone with above average computer skills  Until next year.Skunk is all I have to say.  MTP

By Sat evening there was no wind to speak of for 2 hours.  This morning winds were 40km/h but by noon it dropped so it was quite fishable."
