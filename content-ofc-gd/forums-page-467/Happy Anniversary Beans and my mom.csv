640464,Beans,2011-11-16 02:45:00,3339,"Thanks all...actually we had a quiet day...never got out of our bathrobes...we were on the run since last Thursday and needed a day of rest...besides, the restaurant we wanted to go to is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so we will hit it tomorrow evening (most of the good ones are closed for the season)...  We had our great-grandson here for the weekend to take in the Christmas festivities at Settler's Village...  As some know we have had Chiquita here for over a year now and we were a bit leary as to whether she would take to having a kid around...but as you can see, her and Ryan James got along famously...
