The rooming house buddies i made took me under their wing  and showed me how you could save your money and live off the land  so to speak . I went along with it for a while as i did'nt have much money when i landed in the big city , 3.75 to be exact . For Ketchenany, Jer and Woodenboater you'll know where i mean when i say , my new buddies would take me to the place beside the Silver Dollar... lol ."

641577,ch312,2011-11-20 23:10:00,1590," anyone can visit a gas station on the six nations reserve and get gas for at least 5 cents cheaper than off the res. but, you'll save much more if you have a gas card. since the gas cards are issued on the spot and there's basically no control, it's quite easy to find a native that will sell you their card. gas attendants don't ask and the seller will get a new card (for free) the next time they fill up.  that said, i refuse to use gas from the reserve as it makes my atv run bad and i get lower MPG in both my truck and atv. i know of a few people that fill up out there and they've all seen the same thing.   ="
641176,ketchenany,2011-11-18 19:50:00,3229,"Well, here we go again.  Yesterday's futures markets saw a clear drop of more than 12 cents a gallon or 3 cents a litre for gasoline. Normally this would be reflected at the pumps overnight, less the routine withhold by Canadian refiners of a penny, more or less, because they can. You pay for this clear lack of competition at the refinery level in Canada. No surprise there.  But it gets better  Despite initial wholesale trends among most of the major players, that late yesterday afternoon were settling on a 2.2 cent a litre drop, Esso decided to defy this undeniable market signal and actually raise prices, which all others then followed.  Do you need any more proof of who dominates the downstream price structure in the GTA ?"
