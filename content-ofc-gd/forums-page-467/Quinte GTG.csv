640573,mike rousseau,2011-11-16 19:01:00,4661,its only 30-40km winds...  quinte isnt that big...  youll just get sprayed a lot...
640577,Headhunter,2011-11-16 19:14:00,5703,"They are calling for 50k sustained on Sunday... there will be 6 footers at the ferry and substancially bigger waves down Adolphus... and Quinte aint like Lake O, the waves are much closer together than the big lake... HH"
640581,mike rousseau,2011-11-16 19:23:00,4661, you should be able to find SOME calm waters to fish... just have to bang your way out there...  i know what kinda waves will be out... same as what we get on lake st.francis... the kind that get you airborn... and make you walk funny the next day...lol
640587,Headhunter,2011-11-16 19:39:00,5703,"Yup, there will be fishable waters, yah just gotta know where to launch... unfortuantely, it will restrict us to only a few areas, but it is still way better than watching fishin shows on the weekend! HH"
640928,Joey,2011-11-17 22:08:00,9122,"So for all who are planning on going to the Texas Grill again on Saturday night, what time should we plan for?  7:00 ish?

640951,Joey,2011-11-17 23:44:00,9122,"Okay, looks like 6 p.m. for anyone interested in going.  Bring your appetite for steak, they make a mean one"

639564,SlowPoke,2011-11-12 20:15:00,2984, I love that place!! I hope they still have the steak special on.
639601,Joey,2011-11-12 23:47:00,9122,"I hope so too Brian.  Looks like we won't be arriving until late Friday now, after work (why does work always get in the way of fishing   )"

640267,Headhunter,2011-11-15 14:46:00,5703,"Forecast is lookin like we will have a bit of a ""walleye chop""! http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0540?ref=topnav_weather_savedcity  HH"
640342,fishnsled,2011-11-15 19:49:00,3520,At least the weather seems to be stable.....stable winds at 30 to 55K everyday this week??!!  Guess the Gortex will get a workout. Next boat will have full windshield.
640349,GBW,2011-11-15 20:08:00,8460,"my plans have been changed and I will not be able to make it.  feel free to let it go to anyone else, my loss..."
640350,ccmtcanada,2011-11-15 20:12:00,7971, Chop?? LOL    55 is a little breazy
640566,Headhunter,2011-11-16 18:41:00,5703,"Well, as the time draws nearer, it looks like it's definately going to have a bit of a chop going on.... I especially like it when the wind blows the white caps off of the top of the wave... thank goodness Quinte hardly ever gets rough in west or south west winds! On the bright side, these forecast winds should keep some of the ""less hardy"" types off the water and open up space for those of us who missed our recent head examinations... and if it does rain on us, we won't get wet... the wind will blow it right off of us! (Note to self... bring extra booze!) HH"
633236,walleyemaster,2011-10-22 20:07:00,325,"im not sure i can get out there this year , no time, work is crazy and boat already put away  .. maybe sneek in a ride with a pal or two  "
633306,Joey,2011-10-23 01:35:00,9122,I think we're meeting up for supper on Saturday night with Terry and the gang aswell.  Can't remember the name of the restaurant!!
633307,irishfield,2011-10-23 01:39:00,26272,If Lloyd has anything to do with it ... that would be Gus's !
633311,LeXXington,2011-10-23 01:56:00,1928, It would be great to see you there Wayne.
633314,irishfield,2011-10-23 02:05:00,26272,Thanks Paul... I'm working on it but have a years worth of backlog to schedule and work around... but I'm getting closer to being there and taking my spot back !    (that means I'm up 2nd !)
633357,GBW,2011-10-23 13:03:00,8460,"after your dinner, come by for a fire.  that is if we can get one lit...  lol"
633469,Mike the Pike,2011-10-23 23:07:00,3421, I have decided to go one week later later Roy as the fishing has slowed over the last few yrs around the 11th and 12th.There seems to be more success towards the end of November.  Last year when we went around November 12th is was so warm we had to peel off the survival suits.  I will be there Nov 17.18.19 and 20th.  Hope to see y'a there Papa Smurf.
633473,Mike the Pike,2011-10-23 23:14:00,3421, Do you want to go back to the Texas Grill Joey?
633505,Joey,2011-10-24 01:00:00,9122," Ya, I think that's the one we usually go to Saturday night.  Where you staying for the  weekend Mike?"
633569,Mike the Pike,2011-10-24 03:43:00,3421, Picton Harbour Inn
633571,irishfield,2011-10-24 03:44:00,26272,Jesus.. the PHI is going to hell in a hand basket !
633842,Terry,2011-10-24 23:50:00,14456,"That is where we are staying too,they have wireless internet for those who have laptops or lap dances or lap dogs"
633867,Gord,2011-10-25 00:40:00,20, Sorry to but in here guys but.....I was always wondering about staying in the picton harbour inn. Do they have boat launch and docking and what are the accommodations like. What is the walleye fishing like there now. Thanks
633869,Terry,2011-10-25 00:43:00,14456,the free boat launch (and a nice one) is just around the corner from it and there is docking too  I heard the fishing has been slow but it always picks up around November
633872,irishfield,2011-10-25 00:46:00,26272,Rooms are booked WAY in advance at PHInn.. Lloyd booked ours back in August. If you're wanting to stay there I'd get on the phone...
633893,Gord,2011-10-25 01:46:00,20, Thanks guys now can I go out on a limb and ask where from there do you go to drop your line. Do you go as far up as Hay Bay. Thanks again
633897,irishfield,2011-10-25 01:52:00,26272,"Depends on the boat and what the weather allows you to do. Many a fish have been caught in front of the first cement factory as soon as you start out of Picton. You can then continue on towards Hay bay and go ""up"" towards Deseronto or you can bear right and go down the straight beyond the ferry and use 2 lines per person down there. Some years we've been all the way down to the gap that goes out into Lake Ontario to get on fish... but not in recent years. Late fall they are usually well up to the ferry or close."
633975,Gord,2011-10-25 12:43:00,20,  Thanks again for your help. We fished a couple years ago from Merland. Water rough and Merlin rough need not say more. Thanks so much
634002,BUSTER,2011-10-25 14:15:00,1336,
636512,Fish Farmer,2011-11-01 12:38:00,2234,"Looks like I'm going to miss you guys again this year. I'll be there 20,21,22,23. staying at Harbor Inn small apartment#401. We used to get the penthouse#601 but it's rented out now  If you want a good breakfast, harbor inn restaurant is the place. Save me some fish guys, don't catch them all. I just need one big one. Not a sheephead"
636578,fishnsled,2011-11-01 15:36:00,3520,  We'll try to leave you a couple Dave. How about some silver bass or perch?
636585,Headhunter,2011-11-01 16:00:00,5703,"Or, we could catch all the wet socks and leave you the sheepies... so you could ""play lambs"" all day! HH"
636647,bassnass,2011-11-01 21:02:00,174,So who is going down early on the Friday - and is there a spot in a boat?  I'll make you a star...
636665,GBW,2011-11-01 22:50:00,8460,young_one and I are but that all depends on what time you call early.
636693,Fish Farmer,2011-11-02 00:38:00,2234,"  Gezz, you guys are all heart   Just save me one  , but if I have to take the back seat, I'll take a lamb"

620726,fishnsled,2011-09-12 19:29:00,3520, I think that the other dates were better.....what were they again??
620729,John,2011-09-12 19:41:00,2956, Was thinking the same thing..........lol
620841,LeXXington,2011-09-13 00:49:00,1928,I will be there what ever date is decided... Unless it's frozen over of course
620865,ccmtcanada,2011-09-13 01:25:00,7971, Count me in for those dates!
620869,mike rousseau,2011-09-13 01:32:00,4661,Can't make everyone happy...  Whoever decides these things.... Just pick... Then plans can be made/changed...
620872,Roy,2011-09-13 01:38:00,13728,"How about the 25th, 26th and 27th?"
620875,danbouck,2011-09-13 01:41:00,4380,I'm in for May
620879,mercman,2011-09-13 01:43:00,7054,"Hey, we could book the place for every weekend, and have the longest lasting G2G in history That way everyone could make it for at least 1 weekend."
620882,Terry,2011-09-13 01:47:00,14456,"I have 4 weekends vacation left, so yeah that works for me"
620883,fishnsled,2011-09-13 01:47:00,3520," These dates are fine as are any dates in November. The sooner I know which ones, the easier to book off the days needed."
620889,Roy,2011-09-13 01:54:00,13728,"The dates were posted at the beginning of the thread. We'll never all be in agreement. That's the way it works and some peoples' feelings will be hurt because you're not using THEIR dates. Have you ever registered for a fishing tourney where they've asked you which dates would be the most convenient for you? Lakair G2G dates are set and people either can make it or they can't. Most people get there somehow. We've been doing this long enough to know. On the other hand.....you can try to please everyone and this thread will last and last and last. Walleye season closes sometimes though so....  From personal experience, the people who will have crusaded for a specific date will in all likelihood have something important come up that weekend and will not show up."
620891,GBW,2011-09-13 01:56:00,8460,As far as I know those dates work for me too
620918,Ron,2011-09-13 02:45:00,1683,"November 18 - 20th????  Finally, one I can put down on the calendar and make! Sleeping in the back of my truck for the weekend, perfect!  Cheers, Ron..."
620923,DT10Sam,2011-09-13 02:55:00,480,"I know that you guys are set on November and we are getting word and some pics posted on another forum of good size walleyes being caught east of the ferry.  I'm going to try and get out this weekend, however I will let you know what is happening as it develops. I am thinking that October will also be a very good month for monster walleye.  Regards, Sam"
621287,fishhunter,2011-09-14 00:35:00,604,Hey Joe he was holding off posting till I got a clean bill of health from the heart doctor.  All is good now and I guess you know what date we are going ) it was the only weeekend I had open in November.
621410,bassnass,2011-09-14 13:00:00,174,Throwin' my hat in the ring...
621423,GBW,2011-09-14 13:25:00,8460,I think I just heard a scream that sounded like it could have been young_one...
621496,Bitsmith2k,2011-09-14 18:27:00,396,"can't wait! i found these deals online, should be deadly in november:    not sure if they work with the multicoloured marshmallows though.."
621499,Terry,2011-09-14 18:32:00,14456,so  what date are you guys shooting for  or are we looking at 2 dates......
621515,fishnsled,2011-09-14 19:27:00,3520,"It looks like the majority are fine with the 18, 19th, 20th. I'd say those are the dates. All in favour?  Thanks for getting this started Joe.  PS - Glad to hear things are OK Lloyd. Scarey stuff when dealing with the ticker."
621516,GBW,2011-09-14 19:27:00,8460,I just heard the Link got a new set of these to celebrate the weekend too...  
621517,fishnsled,2011-09-14 19:32:00,3520,  Are these for you nipples Geoff???? Which cabin/room/place are you staying at? I don't won't to be too close....
621519,GBW,2011-09-14 19:41:00,8460,"if they were, they still wouldn't be near as nice as what you wore last year..."
621522,fishhunter,2011-09-14 20:01:00,604,WE ARE BOOKED IN AT THE PICTON HARBOUR INN http://prince-edward-county.com/?page_id=947
620667,Headhunter,2011-09-12 17:19:00,5703,"Hey folks, Well, we are fast approaching that time of year again and as such, I was hoping that we could establish a date for our November GTG. I know it's too early to be posting a sticky, but in order to secure accomadation, we should start thinkin about a date. HH"
620674,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 17:35:00,4661,X2
620677,Harrison,2011-09-12 17:40:00,2202," Oct 2nd is to early.  I vote for 11, 12, 13 of Nov.  Some of us could make it a 3 day'er.  Or at least pitch it to the misses as one."
620678,Roy,2011-09-12 17:41:00,13728,So? Establish a date already Joe. If you ask people what they'd like you'll never get a consensus. Just grab the bull by the b.. uhh horns.
620679,Roy,2011-09-12 17:43:00,13728,"OK, Phil has the dates. Lock'em in."
620680,misfish,2011-09-12 17:45:00,29133," Good dates Phil,as it wont interfer with the deer hunt."
620682,Headhunter,2011-09-12 17:56:00,5703,"You are absolutely correct Roy and I'll ""third"" Fil's suggestion of Nov. 11th, 12th and 13th. SO, the next big question is... WHERE ARE WE GOING TO STAY!!!!! This should get fun fast! HH"
620683,fishindevil,2011-09-12 17:56:00,6254,phil thats usually our regular g2g dates anyways !!! im in for sure its bbeen a few years since i was at the OFC quinte g2g !! ...
620684,Spiel,2011-09-12 17:57:00,9065,"Hmmmmm, November walleye on Quinte, lemme think.......Uhhhh......No thanks!"
620687,Harrison,2011-09-12 17:59:00,2202," Hmmmm, was HH looking for date opinions or just opinions.  If the latter I would like to change my answer.  And for supporting my new biz I would like to sponsor this event and give everyone going a split shot."
620688,Headhunter,2011-09-12 17:59:00,5703,"Ya know Chris, we could put you on to some spotted carp that weekend... I know where they hide! But then, you'd be stuck reeling in something that in no way resembles a big wet sock and you might get too tired! HH"
620691,Spiel,2011-09-12 18:04:00,9065," If it's great company you're after you can't go wrong Phil, IMHO!  But as for the fish/fishing...... ""no comment!""    Just thought I'd add to our weekend conversation Joe, you know where I stand."
620699,Headhunter,2011-09-12 18:34:00,5703,"I know... no worries, I like wet socks! HH"
620701,ccmtcanada,2011-09-12 18:37:00,7971,Crap....I'm out...can't that weekend!
620702,Spiel,2011-09-12 18:38:00,9065,  Maybe that's what I should have said....  
620703,Roy,2011-09-12 18:39:00,13728, How can you do that with your camera? Are you a contortionist?
620705,ccmtcanada,2011-09-12 18:42:00,7971, Damn...and I miss out on a split shot too???
620707,Terry,2011-09-12 18:45:00,14456,crap we already settled with Lloyd we are going 18 19 20th............  and I do think that was the same date last year........double crap
620708,Harrison,2011-09-12 18:46:00,2202," Wannabe cartoonist close enough?   I was saving a BB #4 for you too if you brought your guitar.  I'll save it for Joe, love to hear the bass line to brown eyed girl again.  Love that tune!"
620711,Headhunter,2011-09-12 18:49:00,5703,"Well isn't that great for youse guys... never really occured to any of you to perhaps let the rest of the class in on the little secret? (Dam Roy, you were so right!) Ok, so in an effort to build a consensus, do we stay with the 11th, 12th and 13th or move to the following weekend so we can watch/hear Lloyd blow his air horn at the morons trolling in his way? HH"
620713,Spiel,2011-09-12 18:51:00,9065,"   Hmmmm, maybe I should go, I haven't been able to find my split shot for months, thinking I lost it!"
620716,ccmtcanada,2011-09-12 18:55:00,7971, I can make it if it's the following weekend....  BB#4...I need one of those...
620717,fishindevil,2011-09-12 18:59:00,6254,"yes i checked it was the following weekend the last 2 times i did the g2g..im good for either weekend fishing is the priority for me so lets do it !!! pick a date phil,the fishing is awesome from then till freeze up....anyways"
620718,Terry,2011-09-12 19:00:00,14456," We were going to start a thread some time this week...  Lloyd has to use weekends that are not booked for charters so, he was dealing with what he had to work with and being the same as last year we thought would most likely work"
620719,Headhunter,2011-09-12 19:11:00,5703,"Ok... so lets try this again... it's like herding freakin cats here!... Is everybody ok with the 18th, 19th and 20th? HH"
