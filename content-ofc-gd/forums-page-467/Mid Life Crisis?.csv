641231,NAW,2011-11-18 23:36:00,4022,"I'm moving in a few weeks my self.  Exciting times.  I'm sure you'll find work soon too.  But with no mortgage, whats the rush eh!  And as far as the 250 bravo.  I've been running one for years.  Great little sled!  They haven't changed much over the years.  Here's a pic of my 89.   They are under powered.  And Slow!  But they're light, and very reliable."
641320,woodenboater,2011-11-19 15:28:00,2277,"Congratulations on shaking off the shackles ! Along with others here, I envy this move you're making and look forward to reports with lots of photos.  Relatively close to Pukaskwa, Missinaibi, and endless crown land in all directions...yep, mid life crisis  Get a nice size sled, make a komatik with hdpe runners and life will be sweet in the winter."
641338,limeyangler,2011-11-19 19:44:00,5204,"Awesome stuff...i did a similar move 5 years ago....loving my midlife crisis!  Gets pretty snowy up here, the Bravo is an incredible machine. Like someone else said if you can get a long track one with a little more power (350) you will have all you need for where you are going.  Hope the move goes smoothly."
641064,Basskicker,2011-11-18 13:45:00,421,"I must be going through mid life crisis, already given notice to quit my job, already sold the house and moving north....way north to Manitouwadge, Ontario. My wife got a great job in town and her family lives up there. Leaving next weekend to buy a house and be mortgage free.  Definitely a life changing event, I have no job lined up, but I know and believe everything happens for a reason and things will work out!!  We have always wanted to live up north, so we are doing it, enough of this rat race!!  I already have most of my toys, but I need a snowmobile....looking a getting a 2011 Yamaha Bravo 250.....looked at other new machines but cost WAY TOO MUCH-10-15 grand, the bravo I can probably get for 5000 cash.  I just wanted some opinions on this machine, already have 2 feet of snow up there  Cheers Jason"
641067,scugpg,2011-11-18 13:53:00,1373,"Jason I really admire you making the decision to make the move, I hope to make that happen in the future.  I'd call that having your priorities straight and not a crisis.  Good luck and happy fishing!"
641068,ricoboxing,2011-11-18 13:54:00,398,"If that is considered a mid life crisis, then I can't wait to go through mine."
641092,chuckymcd,2011-11-18 14:44:00,144,"a 250 isnt much power, if I were you the lowest i would go is around a 500 cc. but thats just me.  Can find some nice sleds in the $5000.00 range that are a couple of years older, and make sure its good in powder if they already have that much snow haha.  Good luck"
641098,solopaddler,2011-11-18 14:57:00,8605,Jason are you kidding me? Wow did that ever come out of left field.  Give me a call when you have a second.
641107,msp,2011-11-18 15:34:00,1336,Can I come with you ? I can hide in a suitcase or something. Im getting sick of this rat race too. Goood luck to ypu and your wife.
641112,Parisite,2011-11-18 15:43:00,66,I used to live in Manitouwadge! I haven't been back in a while but it is a nice little town. You can probably find a good used sled there with more power than the 250 for less $$$.
641119,Rod Caster,2011-11-18 16:00:00,5784,"Nice move! Congrats and I'm sure you'll enjoy the true north.  The Bravos are very light and float like a boat... There is no comparison unless its a similar trapping sled. I like fast sleds, but I'd probably get a Bravo or similar if I was buying new. It'll be one of your favorite tools I'm sure."
641121,motion,2011-11-18 16:12:00,403,"X2 on the 500cc minimum. I've always looked at the Bravo as a kids machine. They are great machines, however, go big or go home!"
641130,Remastered,2011-11-18 16:34:00,143,I'm glad this isn't an actual midlife crisis. A fishermans midlife crisis is like one of the worst ones. They cut the hook off their dry flies and if you ask them why they tell you it's the bite they're looking for.
641132,Sinker,2011-11-18 16:40:00,8692,"You can't go wrong with a Bravo. I've taken them into a TON of places a bigger machine wouldn't get close to. Its the first machine I go to when its time to break a trail!! Light, reliable, and easy to repair....if ti breaks down!  If you can find the 340 long track, grab one.  Probably the best bushwacking sled going. You don't need anything big to get places. A bravo will get you anywhere..........just not fast!!  S."
641141,Basskicker,2011-11-18 16:53:00,421," Thanks...that's what I was hoping to here!! I don't need a machine to do Mach 1....just get there and back, there is over 400 small back lakes within 150km in every direction!!!  I can't wait"
641143,Basskicker,2011-11-18 16:54:00,421,"  I tried, your son said you were out...getting you nails done lol"
641144,misfish,2011-11-18 16:56:00,29133,"Crisis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sounds like my dream.  Good luck with everything."
641149,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-18 17:11:00,10439," Yep, a Bravo is a great machine especially when there is no groomed trail and tight woods to get through.  I did the midlife crisis thing 6 years ago and moved to Yellowknife. Best thing I ever did!!!! Have fun in the North country."
641151,kickingfrog,2011-11-18 17:20:00,8333,Zing!!!
641156,WeedLine,2011-11-18 17:48:00,322,Good luck with your move and let us know how the fishing is up there
641158,tb4me,2011-11-18 17:49:00,3295,Hey Drifter your hard water fishing season start out there yet?
641164,12footspringbok,2011-11-18 18:49:00,459,"Away from the rat race, up north, with no mortgage. I'm green with envy. Good on ya. I hope this is what my midlife crisis looks like."
641182,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-18 20:09:00,10439, Yep. There was some safe ice around last weekend but I was unable to get out. Will be on the ice on Sunday though. Hitting up my early season laker hole for some fun.
641195,Jds63,2011-11-18 20:53:00,1365,"Hey Jason, will you be gone before ice fishing starts here ? was going to give you a call to get on the ice in 2012"
641201,Basskicker,2011-11-18 21:18:00,421," Hey bud, yes my wife's new job starts Nov 29/11 so I will be gone by Dec 15/11, but if your crazy enough to drive 13 hours north your more than welcome to join me for a few days."
641204,lew,2011-11-18 21:25:00,12766,"Can't help you with the sled Jason, but congrats on the move and getting away from the rat race !!"
641219,solopaddler,2011-11-18 22:30:00,8605,"Just wanted to congratulate you guys publicly, you must be super excited!  It'll be nice knowing someone in Manitouwage now."
641221,Big Cliff,2011-11-18 22:42:00,6899,"That isn't a mid life crises, that is a young man making a very smart decision!!!!!! Good for you! God bless and enjoy the rest of your life because you will be living what most people will work the rest of their lives only to dream about!"
