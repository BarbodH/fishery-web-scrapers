Didn't really have a choice though. Thx for the comments!"

641957,mike rousseau,2011-11-22 02:14:00,4661,"I don't think the name would have been a big deal...  But at the end of his posts he was making reference to a substance that isn't ""family"" friendly...  So I can see how the image he was putting out there wasn't right for this ""family"" site...   Sweet fishing man...  Can't wait to get my first steelhead on a float..."
