Or, is there anything which you guys could recommend which would be equivalent to a navionics program>?? I'm interested in using the unit for scopeing out ice fishing spots ahead of time, but also want to use it in the summer to locate the drop offs/rocks etc.  Thanks!"

641715,jjcanoe,2011-11-21 14:02:00,744," Lowrance seems to discontinue every good product they come out with, I use my XOG (discontinued) on the boat as well as the ice and in the big rig out on the road  unfortunatly it's not updateable any more,  no Linc, no Trans Canada hwy in New Brunswick etc. since these roads were completed after the last available updates. :-(  jjcanoe"
