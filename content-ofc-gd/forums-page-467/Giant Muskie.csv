640961,Remastered,2011-11-18 00:21:00,143,Should have mounted it. That muskie won't be alive much longer proper catch and release or not.
640964,cram,2011-11-18 00:44:00,1733,"Whatever it was, it's a really nice catch and likely the fish of a lifetime for him.  Congrats to the angler."
640967,Rich Nelson,2011-11-18 00:53:00,332,"This article is hilarious... So full of Bull its not even remotely believable. 1.""pickeral"" angler with 600 ft of 100 pound test line. 2. Fishing in 220 fow 3. Pulled out 200 feet of line on runs 4. The whole boat was bouncing 5. Took an hr to land ( on 100 lb test) 6. Weighed on a spring scale ( dont know too many walleye anglers that carry 70 lb scales) 7. Was a 65 lb muskie released that was a catch n realease record 8. ( i really hope this one isnt true) Bass Pro would pay 10 k for a mount of the fish? Ever heard of replicas? Im hoping that is Bull, just like the rest of the article. Facts. Angler landed a very nice musky, and congrats to him for releasing it. As for the rest of the story... Was good for a laugh"
640972,Gregoire,2011-11-18 01:17:00,1397,The more I think about it the more I wonder if there is a spot on the Larry bear brockville that goes down 200+ feet? I just checked my navionics and it seems like it does get that deep...surprising news to me.
640976,Rizzo,2011-11-18 01:21:00,4754," my thoughts exactly. a real nice fish for the guy, but the story is one of the best ""fish tales"" I have ever heard. Good thing they took the part out where the boat actually submarined a few times and how they debated on cutting the line to save their lives"
640978,Moosebunk,2011-11-18 01:26:00,3970,"What Urban Fisherman said and,  I'd be over the MOON if that was my first muskie.   Used to think the first big walleye I caught was about 8lbs.  Called it that a good long while ti'll learning better.  It was about a 5. lol."
641167,bucktail,2011-11-18 18:57:00,1857,I never knew it got that deep there!
641263,cranks bait,2011-11-19 01:48:00,721,Congrats to the guy who caught and released the fish.  Yes the story is a little fishy.  The local reporters here are likely at fault as well?  I know the area quite well as it is literally my back yard   I too am questioning the water depth?  Although I cannot find my charts (there here in the house somewhere?) to verify.  Reguardless they are here.  Had a big one swimming around me while standing in the water putting out my duck decoys a couple of weeks ago.  Funny how something like that makes you scream like a little girl.....
641266,mercman,2011-11-19 01:53:00,7054, I woulda added a few ounces of fluid to the river It was probably sizing up your decoys as a meal.I hear the big ones can actually swallow a duck.
641272,glen,2011-11-19 02:39:00,2641,I never new it  got that deep either.  But it sure is piling up.
641274,GBW,2011-11-19 02:49:00,8460,
641286,Rich Nelson,2011-11-19 04:08:00,332,"No need to keep quiet, or kill the fish. He should be proud of a fish like that. If the story didnt turn out to be a fairy tale full of added Bull it would be a lot more believable..."
641323,tightline,2011-11-19 15:51:00,322,"That is a Monster none the less. 70pds? Not likely, but who cares, thats his first Ski and not one person on this board wouldn't be happy with it!! Bad hold, sure, will it die, maybe maybe not.  Hopefully in the future he'll do better and educate himself.  Hate how all these Musky posts allways get so wrong!  Good On Ya Bud!!! Way to snap your virginity with a Monster!!"
641325,lew,2011-11-19 16:02:00,12766," The reason many of us seldom, if ever, post musky reports anymore."
641331,Lungelarry,2011-11-19 17:49:00,294,"So ,its alright for a writer to write a bunch of lies(just because its fishing and fisherman are all liars,worst than crackheads)he never checked out anything that the guy told him,also his editor did no checking. Very reliable newspaper there.The news is not supposed to entertainment,just the facts ma'am just the facts.So to me this isn,t about muskies,its about how people accept bull,what if this was a very important story and all the facts were wrong??????????????"
641337,Rich Nelson,2011-11-19 19:30:00,332,"Exactly what Lungelarry said. A great catch for the angler ( minus the hold, but he obviously didnt know better) and its great that he released it. The rest of the story just goes to show how the media twists facts to the point that half of what we read is made up!"
641409,BassMan11,2011-11-20 01:44:00,583,Poor guy. All he wanted was to catch a 40lb walleye that night.  Imagine he was actually fishing for Muskie? What would he use? A marlin outfit?
640854,BassMan11,2011-11-17 17:48:00,583,If you haven't seen it. A story from the Ottawa sun.  http://m.ottawasun.com/2011/11/17/huge--muskie-unbelievable-catch  And i know I know. The hold.
640855,BillM,2011-11-17 17:50:00,17367,"I'll start it off.   That's not a 70lb muskie, lol."
640857,Djeep,2011-11-17 17:56:00,199,"No net, but a hand scale that goes past 50lbs?  Something smells a lil more fishy then even that muskie could muster lol"
640862,The Urban Fisherman,2011-11-17 18:05:00,2050," He could just be a really big dude...    hah  But seriously, you can't knock the guy.... it's his first Ski, and he likely genuinely thought it was that big.... with the excitement of the battle, the minutes it took to land likely felt like an hour to him... haha I fished for close to 20 years before I joined OFC and really got into the sport...and if somebody showed me that picture 7 or 8 years ago I'd have believed out of shear ignorance that it was 70lbs...  And let's just assume for a second that they put it on two rusty old 35lb spring scales... it could have bottomed them out, even though it wasn't actually 70lbs... those scales are garbage, and not designed to weigh something that big....  At the end of the day, I say congrats to him for catching a fish of a lifetime... hopefully the fish lived despite how it's been held and weighed.  I'm sure he's been told enough times by how that you shouldn't hold a fish like that, and will hopefully learn a lesson or two about musky fishing and getting your facts strait before telling stories of grandeur...  Cheers, Ryan"
640863,backbay,2011-11-17 18:08:00,773,This has all the makings of a classic.....  :jerry:
640864,Fishing4Tails,2011-11-17 18:11:00,38,"But he did get his picture in the paper !! Lol ..  Not even close to 50 lbs .. Sad to see them print that with again no proof photos measurements proper scales etc. Gotta love the hour long fights , of course the way he holds it ."
640865,BillM,2011-11-17 18:19:00,17367," I've been guilty of the same thing!  You get so excited your brain stops working   70lbs or not, that's a nice fish."
640867,ccmtcanada,2011-11-17 18:22:00,7971,"WOW!! Monster fish!!!  I just went to the ofah weight caluclator...and a 54"" muskie would need have a girth of 34"" to weigh in at 69 pounds.  Either way, it was a fish of a lifetime!"
640875,jimmer,2011-11-17 18:53:00,2730,"I mounted a 59"" muskie out of the St Lawrence for a guy about 20 years ago and it weighed 49 lbs. So, I would guess that fish was around 35-40lbs."
640876,capt bruce,2011-11-17 18:56:00,820,"He didnt grow up to lie , do we have to kill eatch fish to make you guys stop yapping . dare anyone here to produce a fish of even 3/4 of those proportions, wow so many haters !!????"
640877,Lunkerhunter,2011-11-17 18:59:00,455,"lol no way 70 lbs and what a brutal hold. gotta love how people think it takes hours to reel in big muskie.  nice fish either way i suppose. doubt it lived after being held like that, fought for an hour and weighed and pics taken. lol ah well."
640880,lew,2011-11-17 19:13:00,12766,"It's a nice fish and who really cares how big it was.  Only thing I'm wondering though, is who uses 100# line to fish for pickeral ??"
640882,Roy,2011-11-17 19:22:00,13728,"The fish could have been over 40 pounds. Can't really blame the dude though for being excited. He's a newbie and just learned a very valuable lesson. Never take your enthusiasm to the press...it'll haunt him for the rest of his life. For the sake of this thread though, I'm glad he forgot the net and remembered the camera instead of the other way around."
640883,mike rousseau,2011-11-17 19:23:00,4661,   what?  it was 54 inches... my friend boated a fat 52incher this fall that weighed about 40lbs... you actually think a 54 inch musky can weigh almost 50% more...    i think this is a bit of a prank... or the guy is a bit new to the game ...
640885,Pigeontroller,2011-11-17 19:35:00,2793,Definately the worst kind of vertical hold! And definately not 70 lbs. Kudos to the angler for releasing it.
640893,esoxansteel,2011-11-17 19:44:00,1307,"Very nice muskie no other comments, its all been mentioned"
640902,K_F,2011-11-17 20:18:00,107,"ya, do you believe the nerve of this guy.  accidently catches a trophy fish and wasnt even an expert"
640905,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-17 20:31:00,10439,"My biggest musky was a Wolsley Bay/French River monster that was 53 1/2"" long and weighed in a 42#'s. That is a really nice looking fish though. Too bad about the hold."
640913,mercman,2011-11-17 21:23:00,7054,  
640916,danbouck,2011-11-17 21:32:00,4380,"Come on guys, he's 7'3"" and 425lbs"
640918,Rizzo,2011-11-17 21:35:00,4754,"...not to mention 600 feet of it!  Gotta love the guys face, but I guess if I had my hand jammed up in a big musky's gills I'd pull an expression too. Perhaps another angler bit by the musky bug now?"
640925,jedimaster,2011-11-17 22:02:00,3472,"I have compared some musky pics and have acaught a few good sized musky, I would say its in the 54-58inch range... Looks bigger than this one and its a 54 similar hold and angles... 70 pounds? I don't think so, but if its over 54"" it could very well be over 50 pounds. Stuff like this does happen, my cousin caught a big ling on nippising and they took a picture and tossed it down the hole. They weighed it and it turned out it was a half pound under the ontario record ling according to his spring scale. They had no idea at the time.   http://www.musky.ca/muskiestore/mattmuskiebig.jpg"
640940,Musky or Specks,2011-11-17 22:56:00,2710,And this is why you keep your mouth shut or you just kill the musky or no one will ever believe you.
640948,Gregoire,2011-11-17 23:20:00,1397,"I find it funny that most news stories need to go through vigorous fact checking, yet anyone can send a picture of a big musky and claim it weighs a ton and the paper will print that story no questions asked.  Regardless it is a catch of a lifetime, and at least he tried to release it."
