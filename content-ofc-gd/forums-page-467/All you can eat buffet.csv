641003,mike rousseau,2011-11-18 02:44:00,4661,Well the Walters are getting FAT...  They've been THICK for a while now... But they have been gourging lately... Cleaned a couple that where so full of minnows they practically exploded when I cut their belly...  And the big girls are coming out to play...  And the little ones are schooling in big numbers...  I recently got my heaviest fish so far this year as well as an all time PB for numbers... I managed to boat 105 walleye by myself in one day!!!!  Heres a couple of the bigger ones...a 9lb 6oz and a 8lb 12oz...           Sorry about the first pic quality... Moron for a camera man...  Mike
641009,Ben_Daniels,2011-11-18 02:50:00,435,Sweet Fish!!! I'd never forgive myself if I blurred a pic of a 9lb walleye...but that would be a fish of a life time to me....something tells me you'll see many fish bigger than that!
641010,Pikeslayer8,2011-11-18 02:51:00,336,"Congrats, spectacular hogs you got there.   Looks like a bit of a nip in the air."
641012,mercman,2011-11-18 02:59:00,7054,Sigh.........

641045,Handlebarz,2011-11-18 09:28:00,3790,dang that is awesome Mike congrats on the PB and amazing day out
641047,spincast,2011-11-18 10:28:00,3279,nice pair of pick pics  there - congrats on the pb. Guess the camera man was shaking with excitement?
641059,Lunkerhunter,2011-11-18 13:11:00,455,awesome walleye dude. too bad about the camera man. maybe you should give him a lesson or two on shore so he doesnt mess up any more pics.  and 105 in one day is just amazing.
641061,mike rousseau,2011-11-18 13:32:00,4661,"The worst part is I edited that pic... The original had a finger covering the left side... Lol  Thing is I wanted to get her back fast...  I asked ""you get a good pic?"" He said ""yup""  I laughed about it as soon as i saw the pic...  I should have known better and checked the picture before releasing the fish..."
641082,wantabigone,2011-11-18 14:26:00,97,"awesome day out for you... How late were you fishing until? 105 in a day, I have surfed some fishing chat boards and you seem to have hit it right that day. It seems to be tough fishing the past week on BOQ. Need any gas money during the week next week? LOL I'm available!"
641089,mike rousseau,2011-11-18 14:36:00,4661,Actually 100 of them were in about 5 hours... Little ones...  The after hitting the 100 mark I thought I'd try for some bigger fish...  So I moved locations and fished the sunset bite... Got 5 more and one was 9lb 6oz...
641109,msp,2011-11-18 15:38:00,1336,When Musky Mike gets a P.B. it must be good ! congrats on a stellar day out there !

641451,mike rousseau,2011-11-20 13:41:00,4661,Little cold once the sun goes down... But for mid November its awesome weather do far....
641741,Lunkerhunter,2011-11-21 15:59:00,455,  im sure mike will correct me if im wrong but im pretty certain he is NOT fishing BOQ for those eyes.
641917,mike rousseau,2011-11-22 00:27:00,4661,Not BOQ...
