641247,Familyfisherman,2011-11-19 00:24:00,188,So I took a fellow OFNer out Friday to catch some fall bass on Simcoe.  The day started out with shovelling off the boat since I forgot to put the cover on...    Fished for about 10 minutes before we had a nice sunrise fish to start the day.    Fished a bit longer and Nick hot his first fall bass...4.1lbs    I managed our biggest of the day -- weighed 5.8lbs on the digital scale...    Nick managed another nice one as well.    Decent day -- our top five might've been just over 21lbs.  No real brutes but a solid outing -- we were off the water by 10am as the bite died off and the wind picked up.  Good luck if you're out this weekend.

641253,misfish,2011-11-19 00:46:00,29133,"Thats a nice fish right there Nick.   You packing up Saturday? I,ll drop by."
641254,NAW,2011-11-19 00:49:00,4022, That's the plan.  Gotta a few people coming to help load up the storage unit.  The more the merrier!
641257,cl_fishin,2011-11-19 01:05:00,138,"Nice fish, late season bassin is the best!"
641335,Familyfisherman,2011-11-19 18:14:00,188,  Agreed!  Dress for the weather and enjoy!
641405,msp,2011-11-20 01:30:00,1336,Good job guys ! some quality fish for late November. That fish in your avatar looks huge.
641440,Familyfisherman,2011-11-20 12:37:00,188," That one was 6.9lbs on the digital scale...it hit an 8 inch rapala while pike fishing in May...so it was OOS, but it's the biggest I've landed....so far"
641662,mikeseb,2011-11-21 04:14:00,201,"admitting you took a pic of an OOS fish on this forum isnt a good idea from what ive seen lol just sayin, monster fish though"
641670,Remastered,2011-11-21 05:25:00,143,Nothing beats the feeling of out-of-season bass.
641683,Skipper D,2011-11-21 10:56:00,1970,??? catch and release ???
641687,Roy,2011-11-21 11:10:00,13728,"Great report guys. Some obese fish in there.   There's nothing wrong with your avatar, Kev, let it be."
641708,Familyfisherman,2011-11-21 13:36:00,188,"Yeah I'm not worried, we were clearly targeting pike -- we had 6 pike boated, then caught 2 absolute monster smallies in 2 casts...I took a pic of the first, after the second we left the area...we were using 8 inch rapalas, leaders, and 50lb braid...  Of course they were released...but I thought it was worth a picture...that fish in November might've been well over 7lbs...truly a giant in my mind...  Targeting OOS fish isn't cool, but if you fish areas with mixed species it happens...  Anyways, yes, I'll keep the Avatar"
