641781,GBW,2011-11-21 18:55:00,8460,I have seen a few of these rod holders that keep your line in place so I decided I would try and make one.  So far go good but I might make a change to it...   
641788,mikeseb,2011-11-21 19:33:00,201,looks pretty solid!! if you dont mind me asking what is that coil holding the rod?  Would it be somthing one could pick up at home depot etc. Ive been looking into making somthing like this as well but havent decided what will actually keep the rod in place.  I had attempted to make one using some plastic tubing from an old hockey net and it was a little to wide to hold the rod nice and snug.  Thanks Mike
641794,GBW,2011-11-21 19:53:00,8460,it's a rod holder that I cut shorter http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Fishing/RodReelCombos/PRD~0783321P/Berkley+Spiral+Rod+Holder.jsp?locale=en
641797,NAW,2011-11-21 19:59:00,4022,"You sure that's legal?  Just askin, not trying to start anything"
641802,GBW,2011-11-21 20:24:00,8460,I have read it on many boards and CO's say it's fine.  it's a line down rigger and you can buy them all over the place.  this is the one I got the idea from http://www.icefish.com/catalog/inventory.php?fam=110&cat=152
641805,Spiel,2011-11-21 20:31:00,9065," Totally legal as long as it's not left unattended.  Good work Geoff, should work nicely."
641807,GBW,2011-11-21 20:35:00,8460,Thanks Spiel
641810,NAW,2011-11-21 20:46:00,4022,Good to know guys!  Looks like a nice simple design.  Good work GBW
641824,adolson,2011-11-21 21:30:00,783,I saw ice on a lake near my house on my drive home! Wonder if it'll hold me...
641833,adempsey,2011-11-21 21:59:00,1498, Only if you're that fish in your avatar
641867,GBW,2011-11-21 22:58:00,8460,"thanks Nick.  I used 2 nails, then covered in tube to hold the line still.  I might make or buy a clip of some sort though..."
641872,misfish,2011-11-21 23:01:00,29133,Looks like it will rip the lips off.
641923,GBW,2011-11-22 00:32:00,8460,"the best part is Brian, I can set it reel soft or like in the pic.  If I set it the soft way (that I intend to use it) you might not have seen the rod loaded up at all in the pic.  I did a bit of over-kill in the pic to show what it does."
641965,spooner_jr,2011-11-22 02:59:00,193,"Don't test it out in the garage, with a hook tied on it; it works, and it hurts."
642024,GBW,2011-11-22 14:02:00,8460,"yeah, when testing I took the hook off after the 1st test     I didn't want to have a new piercing"
642086,DanD,2011-11-22 16:43:00,2223,"I think a down rigger release, as the line holder; would work great for this set up?  Dan."
642115,GBW,2011-11-22 17:53:00,8460,"something like that is what I'm looking to change it to, cheers."
