640943,Billy Bob,2011-11-17 23:09:00,5865,My hat is off for Mr Lightfoot....
640947,Old Man,2011-11-17 23:20:00,822,Was at a concert of his in Brandon Manitoba many years ago on the day of his birthday. The crowd sang happy birthday to him at the end of the concert. His response was to treat us to several encores which was enjoyed and appreciated by the crowd. Definitely one of Canada's greatest talents. Happy Birthday Gord.
640956,bigbuck,2011-11-17 23:59:00,2449,Love his music but not his politics. He was out supporting the Occupiers downtown last week. Happy bday Gordo!
640989,Muskieman,2011-11-18 01:54:00,2472,:canadian:  Happy Birthday!!!  ♪♫♪♫♪♫♪♫    
640997,mercman,2011-11-18 02:20:00,7054,One of my favorite songs by Gord. Always makes me misty 
641022,Old Man,2011-11-18 03:35:00,822,My personal favorite of Gord's.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDHJAIAozkI
641025,johnl,2011-11-18 03:44:00,197,"he's a great singer that's for sure,theres a funny video on youtube where burton cummings impersonates gordan its good lol"
641027,bigugli,2011-11-18 03:49:00,6138,Beautiful song of spring. How does someone pick a favourite from all that he wrote or performed.   Another one of those great musicians that played Massey Hall year after year.
641028,Rattletrap2,2011-11-18 03:51:00,1652," Love the song too, Paul. I know Mr. Lightfoot penned it, but I actually like the version by Valdy even more! I can't find a You tube version that was studio recorded, only a more recent ""live"" version that is not as good."
641039,Pigeontroller,2011-11-18 04:51:00,2793,"  Actually he was there supporting his Daughter, who was a protester..."
641053,mercman,2011-11-18 11:52:00,7054,"  You like Valdy Man...I know the words to every one of his songs, by heart !!!!"
641054,Roy,2011-11-18 11:59:00,13728,Rainy day people here.
641055,backbay,2011-11-18 12:36:00,773,"I don't have just one, but aside from his better-known epic tunes, Summer Side of Life is a favourite of mine."
641424,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-20 04:44:00,2582,  How can you possibly pick a Lightfoot favourite? But this is one of mine.
641937,chris.brock,2011-11-22 00:53:00,4053,"a great Canadian, unlike others, I was happy to see him at Occupy Toronto, I'm not in the 1% so keep occupying!"
641940,danbouck,2011-11-22 01:01:00,4380,For Lovin' Me & Bitter Green
