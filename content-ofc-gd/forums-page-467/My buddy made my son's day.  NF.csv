641496,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 17:36:00,449,My buddy is the drummer for the heavy metal band MEGADETH and he had a few days off before Halloween so he popped over and made my son's day by rocking out on his drums and signing his cymbols. I know most of you won't be into this type of music but it still was pretty cool. The next day he flew out to LA to play on Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel Live Video

641519,wantabigone,2011-11-20 18:40:00,97,Your kid will never forget that. May even light that passion to get even better on the drums. Too cool. Also a great big thumbs up to the drummer for taking the time to do that.
641525,Carp,2011-11-20 19:14:00,1488,Very cool !!!
641526,woodenboater,2011-11-20 19:27:00,2277,"That is so very cool of your buddy to do this, he sounds like a well grounded kind of guy. Your son must have been super stoked to have him play his kit and I'm sure he'll be the talk of his school tomorrow !"
641527,Leecher,2011-11-20 19:31:00,7832,One word..... PRICELESS

641544,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 20:44:00,449, That's exactly what he said! lol
641572,BillM,2011-11-20 22:39:00,17367,"Wow man, that's insane!!!!  Mind if I ask how you met him?"
641574,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 22:52:00,449,"My neighbour of 15yrs is his brother. Actually, my neighbour has 2 brothers, Glen and Shawn that both were in Megadeth. Glen, the guitarist, has since quit the band to be with his family. I've been to MANY concerts and even on their tour bus a few times and met some really cool guys from other bands like Lamb of God, Dream Theater, Symphony X....etc. I have a few pics of us drinkin' in the backyard somewhere. lol. I gotta tell you, Dave Mustaine (the lead singer and founder of Megadeth...and one of the original members of Metallica) is one weird dude! lol"
641575,Joey,2011-11-20 22:53:00,9122,That is sooooo awesome     Your son is lucky
641675,adolson,2011-11-21 06:51:00,783,"Epic! I knew Shawn was Canadian, but didn't expect this thread to pop up here!  The first, and only time so far, I got to see Megadeth, Shawn and Glen were both in the band (I forget which bassist it was though, they've gone through a few since David left and has now returned). They're one of my favorite bands, my wife's also. They surpassed Metallica in overall quality at least as far back as the Black Album / Countdown to Extinction days.  I wish i could say that NOW!  ... Now you know I need details. lol He seems, at least in recent years, to have gotten his head screwed on straight. And even back when he was on Celebrity Jeopardy, seemed like a pretty smart dude.  So, uh, wanna go fishing sometime? I'm looking for a friend.. Hey! Maybe you could invite along the band... Uhh.. Buddy ol' pal?"
641694,fishindevil,2011-11-21 12:16:00,6254,so very cool !!!!
641763,GBW,2011-11-21 16:58:00,8460,"man, that is SO COOL!  Now you just need to get him fishing and posting here too..."
641767,ckrb2007,2011-11-21 17:31:00,449,"lol...He's more of a golfer and he tours a crazy amount...plus, he lives in Atlanta. Hmmmmmm, I hear the bass is pretty darn good down there though!! heehee ROAD TRIP!"
641768,ckrb2007,2011-11-21 17:33:00,449,"Also, my kid said that if he ever sells his kit, the price just doubled. lol"
