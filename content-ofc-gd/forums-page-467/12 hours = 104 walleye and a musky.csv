641876,mike rousseau,2011-11-21 23:15:00,4661,had another great weekend...  managed 95 walleye on saturday... in about 8 hours... most were small fish on the jig but 10 were 20-24 inches on the troll at dark...  then with the nasty weather on sunday i only got out for the evening bite... managed 9 walleye from 20-24 inches and a tiny little musky in about 2-3 hours...  no pics cause they were small....  but next time out im gunna keep a couple for a fish fry so ill get some pics of these goofy looking fat fat walleye... they are literally like footballs...
641893,Rod Caster,2011-11-22 00:00:00,5784,hahahaha.  I'm laughing because I caught one walleye in 8 hours of fishing.  YOU SUCK MIKE.
641897,mike rousseau,2011-11-22 00:12:00,4661,  lol  hey... this is new to me also... i figured out this pattern this fall and its a blast....  loads of walleye in huge schools... but they are very small... or  at least smaller then im used to... 18 inches and under...  then in the evening i can usually manage to troll up about 10 nicer size eyes...  makes for a really fun day
641898,mercman,2011-11-22 00:13:00,7054,"Awesome Mike !!! You know something, Rod Caster and I are gonna have to book a day with you. What d'ya Think RC?"
641904,Rod Caster,2011-11-22 00:17:00,5784, That would make for a good roadtrip with my gf next summer.   I'll put this idea in my backpocket.
641925,chris.brock,2011-11-22 00:35:00,4053,"I'm not asking for specifics, but what area are you fishing? I'm guessing NW Ontario"
641934,Roy,2011-11-22 00:44:00,13728,I'll guess south eastern.
641936,mike rousseau,2011-11-22 00:52:00,4661, South east...  Roy wins...lol
641946,northernpike56,2011-11-22 01:27:00,717,"congrats, you have caught more walleye in 8 hours then I have in my lifetime"
