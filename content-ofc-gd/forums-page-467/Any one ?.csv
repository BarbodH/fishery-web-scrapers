641298,Skipper D,2011-11-19 11:26:00,1970,"I should'nt , but i realy would like to go try bass fishing this morning on Simcoe . I had fish lesson #3 and know all about drop shot and tube jigs and have to gear to do it and just echin to give it a try . Any one want to come along ? If not then i think i'll go out and winterize the boat and call it quits for this year . I hate going alone ."
641300,Skipper D,2011-11-19 12:05:00,1970,"Funny how thease kinds of threads never get replys , its too bad  . Remember if ya ever choose to come a long the Tim Hortons , food afterwards , and boat gas are always free , i would'nt have it any other way . The offer is just my way of giving back i guess and to have some one to run the dam camera ...... lol . Take care all , i am off to winterize the boat and have some space back in my shop ."
641303,Roy,2011-11-19 12:41:00,13728,"Well Skip....you see, some of us live 700 KMs away....some are probably not waiting around to see if someone will invite them fishing....y'know? But thanks for the offer."
641304,mike rousseau,2011-11-19 12:41:00,4661,I'd go but it's too far skip...  I got nobody to fish with either... I'm going out solo today...
641306,GBW,2011-11-19 12:51:00,8460,I would go but Brooklin to the Barrie area after a 6AM hockey practice isn't a fun drive.  I would love to be out on the water fishing today.  Anyone close feel free to msg me too...

641365,Twocoda,2011-11-19 23:14:00,4130,Bass ya say?....hmmmm i thought that was a summer time fish when there are no other fish to catch   although no one has taken you up on your offer ....i thinks its a very noble gesture for you to throw it on the table....Good on ya dude!
641374,Gregoire,2011-11-19 23:44:00,1397,A very nice offer. I'm surprised no one took you up on it. Good luck on the musky hunt liverelease...i've only gone out once in the fall and returned with a lot of clean lures and nothing else.
641425,wantabigone,2011-11-20 05:09:00,97,Anyone looking fora fishing partner this tues-friday? I am in Brampton and willing to fish for anything that swims! PM if interested.
641429,Skipper D,2011-11-20 09:34:00,1970,"Thanks every one , i understand things dont work out for every one at times . It  was one of those things were i was holding off putting the boat away because of wanting to try bass fishing for the first time and after a friend showing me how it was done and fixing me up with the gear i needed  and waiting to see how i would make out at it .  Then at the same time  i knew i should'nt because of outstanding  demands my company has on me right now , so with being the boss i thru it all up in the air to do which ever landed first at that moment . Now i realy have every one to thank that you's kept me on trac , the boat got put away like it should and my paper work is almost done for the new invoicing program that i need to get up and running . Ther will be many other days for fish and perhaps then i will be better ready .   Take care all and thank you for your threads ."
