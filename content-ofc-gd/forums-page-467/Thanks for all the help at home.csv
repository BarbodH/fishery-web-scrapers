I try to return the favor as much as possible, especially since we have a large family. It really helps for us to allow each other time away for some quiet (fishing, shopping, etc).  I'll just say this, it takes a very unselfish person to love/understand an angler, especially when WE can be very selfish at times (even though I try not to be).  Kudos to those that contribute to their partners passions!!!"
