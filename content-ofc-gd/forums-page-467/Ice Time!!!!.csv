Should have been out last week or even earlier but was dealing with an infection that needed fixing so the ice had to wait a couple of weeks. Got out to my preferred early season troot lake around 11 AM and found around 10"" of clear black ice with about an inch of snow on it.    We need another good snowfall to make the snowmobling good but the trails were fair today.      The fishing was decent but the landing sucked!! LOL I had several nice trout hammer my airplane jig scream off a bunch of line only to spit the hook. Dang you NWT and your barbless rule!! I had bites on tube jigs as well as said airplane jig but the tube bites were super light and I only managed to stick one or two fish on the tube (they both got away unfortunately). I think the change in weather put the fish down today. It has been overcast with a little snow the last few days and today it was pretty much cloudless. Temp when I hit the lake was -24C with a light North breeze making it feel like -30C or so.      Notice the Sunflower heater mod for cooking and boiling water for a cup of tea or soup.        All in all not a bad day. Hooked a bunch of fish (none landed), got out on the sled and got some excersize. Now to wait until next week."

641622,ckrb2007,2011-11-21 01:32:00,449,"Just 10"" of ice eh. Pfft! lol Sure.....rub it in."
641623,BillM,2011-11-21 01:33:00,17367,"Dave, you should have stuck around in Alaska for another month"
641625,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-21 01:42:00,10439, Wish I could have Bill but I gots to work to pay da bills ya know.
641652,mike rousseau,2011-11-21 03:30:00,4661,Ice...  I still got a month in the boat... I hope...  Then I'm back in the boat mid march...
641658,Moosebunk,2011-11-21 03:55:00,3970,"What Bill said.  Good to see you live for both seasons Dave.  As I understand it, many in Yellowknife just buckle down to work hard through the long winters so to enjoy the short summers.  My buddy Dan up there working with First Air tells me he doesn't get out much for the ice fishing.  Probably having a Frabill like yours would make it easier.  This gets me hungry for a little ice time soon.  Pulled much of the gear out this afternoon actually."
641693,fishindevil,2011-11-21 12:14:00,6254,"that looks awesome up there dave !!! glad you hooked a few,oh well next time...like you said it was nice to get out and on the sled...thanks for the way,way up north report...cheers"
641728,adempsey,2011-11-21 15:08:00,1498,Nice!  You look pretty dang cold though!!   Looking forward to the season.
641737,bassmaster4,2011-11-21 15:46:00,801,"getting ready for it down here, BRING ON THE ICE!   you got a nice setup with the hut and the sonar"
641762,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-21 16:56:00,10439," Yeah, seems a lot of people do hibernate for the winter up here. Personally I don't get it. In the winter I get to fish all of those lakes that you can only get to by plane the rest of the year. I will go out in temps down to -30 (without windchill) but any colder and I'll usually stay indoors and  fix gear, work on rods, lures, floats etc."
