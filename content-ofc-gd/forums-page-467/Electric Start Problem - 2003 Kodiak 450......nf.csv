641736,ckrb2007,2011-11-21 15:43:00,449,You must have some sweet snorkels!! heehee.  Good idea about greasing the connections. Point well taken!
641749,ckrb2007,2011-11-21 16:36:00,449,"****Update*****  Was able to jump it with a screwdriver on the solenoid. Fired right up first touch. I also took apart the handlebar attachment with the choke/kill-switch/start button on it to see if it was corroded but it looked like new inside. After I got it back together and on the bar I pressed the start button and wouldn't you know, it fired up.?!?!?!  I tried it 3-4 more times and it kept on starting. But......on the 5th time it didn't again. ARGH!!! so I kinda played with the kill-switch and wiggled the wires and bit and it fired up again. So, my conclusion would be a loose wire or faulty kill switch. I'll be digging into it a bit more this week.  Thanks for all the helps gents! Colin"
641828,ch312,2011-11-21 21:50:00,1590," i just have decent 12-14"" homemade snorks. one 3"" for the air box coming out between the pod and seat and the exhaust/intake for the cvt are up front on one side.  for deep water just keep it in 2wd and you can work the throttle to keep the front end up for very long distances. i've even crossed the grand river down towards caledonia a couple times, but i think ill stick to ponds from now on..."
641830,Big Cliff,2011-11-21 21:54:00,6899,"Dielectric grease is a nonconductive grease. As such, it does not enhance the flow of electrical current. Do not use it on things like trailer hitch pigtails and such. If you are goint to use it, make sure your connections are clean and tightened, then apply a coating of dielectric greas to the outside of the connection. if you want to make sure that connections don't corode, apply a light coating of battery terminal grease to the surfaces of the connection then make the connection. You could then apply a light coat of dielectric grease to the outside of that but it really isn't necessary."
641841,Skipper D,2011-11-21 22:06:00,1970,"I am not trying to be smart by no means , but i am laughing when i think of the snorkle , ten feet of water , and how nice it would be to drive the atv around on the bottom of a river looking at the differant kinds of fish you might see on a trip like that ......"
641890,carll2,2011-11-21 23:50:00,443,ya man i ordered a snorkel kit for my grizz after trying to cross a 5 ft deep river and stalled her hahahaa
641992,Big Cliff,2011-11-22 10:40:00,6899," Ya well I'm wondering what sort of snorkle I'd need for a short guy like me if I was driving my ATV around under 10 fow, my head would still be at least 4' below the surface even if I stood on the seat LOL.  I did submarine my old ATV once, wasn't a good thing. It was one of those famous moments, we get to a big mud hole, everyone else stops, and I say ""watch this, I'll show you how it's done!"" When the guys finally stopped laughing they did throw me a rope and helped me tow it out. I'm a lot more careful with the new one LOL."
642007,Skipper D,2011-11-22 13:02:00,1970,"""watch this""....... lol ... lol , good one Cliff ."
642074,ch312,2011-11-22 16:09:00,1590," well, i guess you shoulda bought a grizzly  i cant tell if you guys are yanking my chain or really dont know what a water wheelie is. keep in mind this guy isnt in deep water, but you'll get the idea. you really need to know your machine and know how to ride in order to succeed...  "
642079,Harrison,2011-11-22 16:24:00,2202,"From this weekend in Newtonville.  We still fish on our days off, sometimes we don't use rods though!!   "
642164,Big Cliff,2011-11-22 20:25:00,6899," Trust me, I wasn't yanking your chain LOL, I had never even heard of a water wheely but in 10 fow? I am guessing you'd need some serious snorkels. That was a neat video though, I am guessing I'll have to learn how to do that some day.  Keep in mind I don't drive my bike too hard, mostly just trail riding or to go hunting most of which is just through some fields and things like that. I could probably walk anywhere I drive my bike but the bike sure makes it easier for me."
642178,bigbuck,2011-11-22 21:39:00,2449,"From the looks of the hydro towers, my guess is just off Elizabethville rd north of hwy 2. Pretty cool. I did some bogging that way as a kid on my Honda dirtbike and rode many of the trails in the area for years."
641482,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 17:00:00,449,"I'm wondering if anyone can help me with my ATV problem. I moved my atv to the backyard last weekend to make some room in my garage.......it starting like a champ like it always, has so I drove it around back. It was parked for 5mins and I went back to try to start it up again and nothing. No clicking, no noise. All gauges still light up and it still starts first pull on the manual start but when I press the elec. start button nothing happens. I checked the battery and and the fuses they're all perfect.  Any help would be appreciated.  Cheers, Colin"
641484,tb4me,2011-11-20 17:14:00,3295,Can you hear the motor turn? Sometimes the solenoid  sticks and doesn't engage the flywheel. A friends quad did the same thing..The spring that pushes the starter out snapped and was just spinning without engaging the flywheel..It was a cheap and easy fix..
641486,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 17:18:00,449,"No noise at all. To me, it seems like no power is getting to the motor. I'm thinking it could be a grounding issue?!?! I'm not sure where the switch or whatever would be grounded. Very frustrating. lol"
641487,Fisherman,2011-11-20 17:20:00,7201," May be the neutral switch, we have one at work that does that, rattle the shifter a bit while holding the start button."
641491,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 17:27:00,449, I've tried to start it both in neutral and in park and still nothing. I'll give it another go though. I'm willing to try anything...again and again! LOL
641502,Big Cliff,2011-11-20 17:51:00,6899,Have you got a multi meter and do you know how to use it?
641503,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 17:54:00,449,I do have a multi meter.....maybe not the best at using one but I can tell if the battery is good. lol
641505,misfish,2011-11-20 17:58:00,29133,"You have power like you say,check the wire to the starter.Take it off and clean and put it back on.If still nothing,jumping the solenoid can tell you if it,s good or not.."
641507,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 18:01:00,449,I'm going to take all these helpful tips and ideas and bulk test them tomorrow in the day. I just didn't know where else to look or try.
641510,Big Cliff,2011-11-20 18:06:00,6899," OK, Well it could be your starter switch or it could be your solinoid. So, hook the ground lead from your multi meter to the ground on your battery. Then find your solinoid. There will be two large posts on it, one from the battery, the other goes to the starter. There will also be either one or two small posts on it. If it is one small post that will be your + from the starter switch. If there are two small posts then one will be ground, the other will be +. You need to connect the positive lead from your multi meter to the small + post on your solinoid then try to start your bike. If the multi meter shows 12 v+/1 a bit then you know your starter switch is working and your solinoid is fried. If it doesn't show 12 V +/- then there is no power coming from the starter switch. Could be a blown fuse, could be a safety interlock, could be a faulty starter switch and now you are into trouble shooting that circuit.  Hope this is some help!"
641512,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-20 18:09:00,0,did you fully charge your battery before you load tested it?  when you ran the atv while testing did the battery drain? my brain doesn't want to move on from a battery issue.
641513,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 18:10:00,449,Makes sense Big Cliff. I'll give 'er a go tomorrow and post my findings.
641514,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-20 18:13:00,0,is there perhaps a relay between the starter and the solenoid?
641515,ckrb2007,2011-11-20 18:14:00,449," My battery has been A-1 since I bought it new last year. I mean, when the elec. start was working, I would barely press the start button and it would fire right up instantly. Tested it with the mulit-meter and it read just over 12 volts when everything was off."
641529,Skipper D,2011-11-20 19:47:00,1970,Dose it have a kill switch ? on by mistake ?
641592,RickOnt,2011-11-21 00:32:00,669,Colin  Is the 'Neutral' light comming on??  Rick
641619,ckrb2007,2011-11-21 01:29:00,449,"Rick......yes, all gauges and lights work properly....including the neutral light."
641655,carll2,2011-11-21 03:39:00,443,"my grizzly did the same last weekend..no starting noise or anything, recharged the battery still wouldent work. jumped the solenoid and it worked"
641657,BillM,2011-11-21 03:53:00,17367,I've guessing solenoid as well.
641681,Big Cliff,2011-11-21 10:32:00,6899, Jumping the solenoid is fine and it tells you that there is a problem in that circuit but the problem could be in the circuit that provides the power to activate the solenoid. If the solenoid isn't getting 12V to activate it then it can't work. I have seen several solenoids replaced when they weren't the problem LOL.
641682,Big Cliff,2011-11-21 10:39:00,6899," It could be as simple as that, I have a Polaris 450 Sportsman and on the left handle there is a three position switch Off/run/Off unless that switch is in the run position everything works but the starter circuit. It has happened a few times that someone or somehow that switch got moved to the off position. You jump on the bike to start it and nada."
641699,ckrb2007,2011-11-21 13:05:00,449,"That's what I thought right off the bat.........maybe my kid flipped the kill switch over to the ""off"" position but no such luck."
641703,lew,2011-11-21 13:12:00,12766,Any chance it could be as simple as a loose wire on the back of the start button ??
641704,simonl,2011-11-21 13:23:00,28,"I have 02 Kodiak and it is notorious for the push button start switch failing and displaying the exact same problem that you have. If, when you start to fault find as has been previously described, you have no 12v at the solenoid post when the button is pushed, I would imagine that the starter button has failed due to dirty contacts. They are small, but fairly easy to get apart and give a thorough cleaning with contact cleaner. I think a google search provided me with some fairly descriptive directions the first time I did mine. Once cleaned and re-assembled, mine is good for another couple yrs."
641723,ch312,2011-11-21 14:51:00,1590,"the key to preventing electrical problems (and stalling in deep water/heavy steam) on an atv is dielectric grease. it takes a while to go through almost every connection and contact point on the machine, but it's nice knowing corrosion and loose contacts won't cause problems. i like to use a small piece of masking tape on each wire to keep track of which connections have been greased.  take apart your push start and get it cleaned up. then trace those wires both ways and make sure each of those connections is cleaned, greased, and secured.  i often ride in water that's 5-10ft deep and have zero issues with electrical. gotta make sure you're electrical system is waterproof when riding like this as a stall at the wrong time results in a wet rider and hydro locked motor.  saturday was the 5th time this year i had the pleasure of helping with a swamped atv. at least it was only a polaris and not my grizzly this time"
