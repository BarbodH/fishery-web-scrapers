636924,wallacio,2011-11-02 23:08:00,475,"Ditto what Bill said.   A ""small"" 'eye from one of their lakes.  "

There are definetly some great fish populations on these lakes.  I prefer some of the smaller lakes for some incredible pike numbers and the average size is well above most drive to lakes.  Some great trout (mainly lakers) opportunities at certain times as well.  We would just use a few williams spoons as you were lucky to see a rapala last more than a few hours, if that.  I am sure you wont be disapointed if you choose them as your trip."
637365,gordy28,2011-11-04 13:57:00,638,"Thanks for all of the replies I hear you about Parks - the reports from Anjigaming and Morin lake are definitely a huge selling point - just not sure if we want to burn 2 days of our trip driving Thanks for the Sunbury Info as well - any particular lake you would choose - we have been lookie at Coonie Lake - bass, walleye and pike Cheers and again thanks for the input A   Anjigaming"

Asked for a new digital camera for Christmas so ideally I'll post a good trip report as well Cheers Gordy"
642105,adempsey,2011-11-22 17:24:00,1498,"Have a good trip!  That's one place I also wanted to try.  They have some great rental boats, some of the best I have seen available.  Hopefully we'll see a report in a years time =)"
