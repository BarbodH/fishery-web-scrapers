Transducer you'll need depending on your unit.  http://store.humminbird.com/products/314001/XI_9_20  The pack you'll need.  http://store.humminbird.com/products/322965/PTC_U  I have both of these and ran my 747c last year out on Simcoe, this year I'll be running the same pack/transducer with my 788ci."
