641470,mike rousseau,2011-11-20 15:51:00,4661,thought you carp guys would like to see this beast of a carp caught by an angler i know...  
641474,Beans,2011-11-20 16:34:00,3339,WOW !!!  My arm aches just thinking about catching it...
641476,Victor,2011-11-20 16:37:00,1609,holy cow that is a beast!! I can only keep dreaming   ...
641488,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-20 17:25:00,2582,I can't believe he released it.  Think of the nice grain fed steaks you could get off of that beast  Without weighing them I'm pretty sure I have been lucky enough to get some over 30...but a 40 ...WOW that would be fun.
641508,mike rousseau,2011-11-20 18:01:00,4661,I haven't got a 40 yet...  36lb 12oz And 36lb 8oz  Are my biggest so far...
641518,lhousesoccer,2011-11-20 18:35:00,442,I don't know.  I don't believe it's an ounce over 39.75-lbs.
641522,J-M,2011-11-20 18:59:00,65,"What a beast! Healthy looking fish, looks like he's been actively gorging  "
641524,Carp,2011-11-20 19:13:00,1488,Big fish !  WOW !!!
641569,Ron,2011-11-20 22:34:00,1683,A new Ontario record that is!  Existing record is 39.88 lbs  Nice!
641579,MJL,2011-11-20 23:18:00,2427,Very nice fish. Paul definitely is doing great out there.   The record has been shattered a many times (unofficially of course). You'll be hard pressed to find dedicated carpers willing to kill a fish for the records.  A friend of mine landed a 56lber on the St. Lawrence which won him a weeks stay at a motel that caters to carpers.
641580,mercman,2011-11-20 23:20:00,7054,What a pig of a fish that is The guy musta had serious cramps in his arms after that one
641590,limeyangler,2011-11-21 00:12:00,5204,That's obscene...disgusting...disturbing and AWESOME!  Great fish your buddy got there Mike.  PM sent btw.
641651,mike rousseau,2011-11-21 03:23:00,4661,  yeah...  the record is broken every year ron...  just carpers are very protective of their fish..  this is the second 40+lb fish between the group of guy i know that fish carp...  most years a fish pushing 50lbs gets caught in my area...
641760,frozen-fire,2011-11-21 16:46:00,542,HOLY CARP!!!!  I'm still waiting to break 30!  What a magnificent fish... love the underwater release footage as well.
