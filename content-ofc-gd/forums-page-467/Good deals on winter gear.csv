640970,Rod Caster,2011-11-18 01:02:00,5784,"Last year, my Gf and I did a bit of ice fishing together but she was often too cold to enjoy it and therefore she held a grudge against winter in general. I told her we'd outfit her with quality gear this year and today was a great start towards getting her into the sport.  ASM in North Bay has these boots on sale for over 60 percent off at $69.99. I have a pair of Cabela's Saskatchewan Pac boots and in comparison, these ones are essentially weightless!!! Rated to -85, I'm hoping they'll keep her feet warm.  http://www.allsnowmo...oduct_info.html  She also picked up some nice snowpants for around $70 from these guys in North Bay.  www.asmstores.com  Next on the list: how to put a live minnow on a hook  Anyone have good deals on winter gear to report?"
640984,Rizzo,2011-11-18 01:41:00,4754,got a brand new Coleman stove (knock-off) from some dusty old antique shop in Parry Sound for 35.00 Add that to the hut I picked up from Aaron Shirley last year and I'm ready to go...as soon as musky season ends...oh ya and as soon as there is ice
641051,hirk,2011-11-18 11:35:00,571,I have some new mustang integrity float coats for $140. She may end up sweating lol
641105,mike rousseau,2011-11-18 15:16:00,4661,my old lady comes ice fishing...  as long as shes warm she'll stay out...  one trick is bring a piece of wood for her to put her feet on while fishing... the separation from the ice will help keep her feet warm...  hot paws?... those single use heat pads from canadian tire... priceless  thermos with soup or coffee...  and if you can afford it... a portable shack and a good heater...   i know im off topic... i dont know of any deals... but i thought id let you know the things i do to keep her warm...
641118,Rod Caster,2011-11-18 15:54:00,5784," X2 on the hot paws. Those things have saved my fingers a couple times. I like the piece of wood idea, I never would have thought of that."
641120,mike rousseau,2011-11-18 16:10:00,4661,  makes a huge differnce...  a 2x6 or 2x8 is perfect...  i keep one thats as wide as my portable...  helps keep you drier as well as warmer...
641163,moose,2011-11-18 18:08:00,266,Baffin makes a boot called Titan good too -100 Celsius never been cold in these Also buy her a floater suit and she will never be cold
641285,Stef,2011-11-19 03:54:00,63,"One of the problems with winter boots that have light liners is that the bottom of the liner is compressed from the weight of the user, making it thin and essentially useless while the top and sides stay lofted.  Boots with deep grips help a bit in keeping the bottom of the foot away from the snow but a good thick felt insole or two works even better.  Felt pac boots are usually warmer as the felt at the bottom doesn't compress as much.  Some good boots come with a separate insole included and the best pair I've owned had an extra layer of insulation molded into the foot bottom in the rubber itself.  One of the reasons that keeping your feet of the snow on a board works well....."
641307,GBW,2011-11-19 12:56:00,8460,"I find a floor mat with a rubber bottom works better for the feet on the ice and you can roll it up for packing.  as for a deal, I was at the Whitby North CTC yesterday and they had #6 Nanofil line on for $13.99 and all other #'s were reg. price.  Going to try it ice fishing this season as it's been ok for me (#12 that is) during the soft water season."
