I know how old Dad in the video feels about getting rid of that beauty !!  Mine was identical to this one except I had white seats.  They sure don't make em like that anymore  "

Rob sold his Baby (1971 RoadRunner) a few years back and regrets it now. He was tight on finances and it was too expensive to drive with the price of gas. Every spring though, he wishes he'd have just kept it and stored it for a while. My goal is to one day buy it back for him and put a big bow on it! Mostly, I miss doing burnouts on it myself!  "

641161,wallyboss,2011-11-18 18:03:00,1095,"I found my Dad's first snowmobile a 1966 Bombardier this August, I talke dwith the son of the man that owned it for about 40 years and he told me that his Dad had restored it 12 years ago. And he had sold it 3 years ago to a childhood friend.  I got into contact with that friend and after a few converstions he decided that he would sell it to me. He had told me that one his buddy that owns the Antique Snowmobile Museum in Cochrane, Ontario wanted to do something with it. But my friend told that he is very Computer illetarate. Another one of my friends from the same town told me that he had seen him drive that snowmobile almost every weekend at the lake and that the sled was in very good shape. And becasue of this I never asked the owner to send me some pictures.  So about 3 weeks ago I drove 800 km to go pick up my new(to me)snowmobile. Got there and started shooting the S**T with my buddy. He started showing me around his place and every time we entered one of his garages I would look around to see if I could finally spot my Dad's sled. Finally I spot a nice old sled and I start walking towards it, he shows it to me and all I could think is that "" this isn't my dad's sled ""  But then  he tells me that this is his 1968 Bombardier and that hes has been driving it every weekend at the lake for about 3-4 years(see story above)  Then he says ""let's go see your sled""  So we get behind one of his garages and all of a sudden he stops and grabs the end of a tarp. He starts pulling it up and I almost puked because of the sad shape that the sled was in. I quickly figured out that the previous owners son's idea of a restored sled was quite a bit different from my idea of a restored one.  I am not too mechanically inclined(I am more electronically inclined but not much of that on this sled) plus I do not have any of metal working machines ( welders, ect..) And i do not even have a garage at the moment. This job was way over my head but reluctantly I put it in the back of my pickup telling myself that I will figure something out. That night after really thinking about it I called the guy back and see if he wanted back and he said yes. So I actually owned the same sled as my Dad for about 12 hours.   Moral of this long story is  ""Be careful of what you want, cause it might break your heart"""
