Over the last several months the supply of instant mushroom soup(regardless of brand) has dwindled to nothing, no more Lipton or Swiss Knorr or No Name brand instant Mushroom soup. I had finally located some at the Bulk Barn, got a big container a while back, went back yesterday for a fill up...none, nada.  Asked the clerk, he had no idea, they just weren't getting any more.  What gives?  I like using a bit here and there in stews or making a sauce for pork chops or chicken."
641392,Fish Farmer,2011-11-20 00:45:00,2234,"Just an idea, what about Campbell's mushroom soup in the can. That's what we use. I know it's not dry. Just a thought."
641399,misfish,2011-11-20 00:58:00,29133,"I like the ""magic"" brand."
641407,Fisherman,2011-11-20 01:41:00,7201,"Oh I use that too, just when you want a solitary cup of soup, they pull the rug out from under ya."
641408,Fisherman,2011-11-20 01:42:00,7201," Ever find ""Smurf"" mushrooms? they turn smurf blue when you break them and they are pretty poisonous."
