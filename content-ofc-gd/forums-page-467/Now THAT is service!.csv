641782,Ron,2011-11-21 18:59:00,1683,"So, here I am enjoying my lunch and a knock on the door is heard. Low and behold Big Cliff is at my doorstep hand delivering a sample bottle of ""Nok Out"". He claims to say he was just in the neighbourhood but I know differently, he wanted to meet the famous Ron! ha ha ha  Cliff gave me a quick demo on this product, I must say, it has many more uses than just odour control for hunting. Cliff goes on to tell me of the many uses this has, from eliminating cigarette smoke odours in the car to controlling litter box odours from cats. You know that musty smell you get from the leather seats in your boat? Well give this stuff a spray or 2 and I know it will take care of it. This is not a scent blocker in the sense that it adds another scent to hide the foul odour. This product attacks the enzymes that creates the original odour and neutralizes them.  So, once again, the perks of being an OFC member, you get to meet great people!  Thanks Cliff! I look forward to trying this stuff out.   Cheers, Ron..."
641784,Roy,2011-11-21 19:03:00,13728,Yeah....so he stopped off eh Ron....he must be headed east then. He should be here by Saturday then I guess.

641795,bigugli,2011-11-21 19:55:00,6138,I got a bottle from Cliff a month back. Works real good on my shoes
641834,Big Cliff,2011-11-21 21:59:00,6899,"LOL, you caught me at it Ron. It was nice to see you again. I did try to catch up with Brad by the way but he is one busy dude, everyone seemed to think he was at one of the other stores, I'll bet he was out hunting or something. If you do get a chance and it isn't too much trouble, could you see if you can get me a number where I might be able to reach him? I would really appreciate it! Just PM me if you do.  Take care.  Cliff"

641854,Big Cliff,2011-11-21 22:39:00,6899,"It sure does, ask ccmt"
