641536,Jigger,2011-11-20 20:02:00,1237,"The fish in question wasnt a monster. But when it happens that fast and tgen a considerable time goes by, doubt definately starts to creep in and the ""jinx"" gets harder to shake. You get away from what it was that got the first one and spend too much effort on shaking the voodoo and not the presentation or area. Didnt help that everyone that we talked to had negative things to say about the fish activity that day."
641559,Skipper D,2011-11-20 22:11:00,1970,Things would have been differant if the two of yous would have spent the day in the boat with me ...........lol....lol....lol .
641698,Rizzo,2011-11-21 12:57:00,4754," yes, probably only the two of them would have made it back to shore"
641349,GBW,2011-11-19 22:43:00,8460,"Well, like the title says; does a big fish in the first 5 min. of fishing jinx the rest of your day?  Thoughts?  This came from a chat in the boat today and from what happenednd in the boat today with Jigger...  Geoff"
641353,GoneFishin,2011-11-19 22:52:00,349,"I couldn't tell you how many times I take my first cast, hook into a fish and say, now this is gonna be a good day  Just to be let down by very poor fishing conditions (ie. They won't bite my lure!!)"
641356,bushart,2011-11-19 22:55:00,2628,No
641361,ketchenany,2011-11-19 23:02:00,3229,"  Since we have no pics, you didn't get one! Yes it has happened 'dropping' (set the depth on a 'stick' and drop it) a Williams ice fishing and was taken on the way down, should have went home right there and then!"
641362,duber,2011-11-19 23:03:00,220,"Yes,every time!"
641363,Roy,2011-11-19 23:07:00,13728,"Look at it this way. If you go out and fish all day.....no bites, but you keep working at it then just before you're about to call it a day you hit a big one. Wouldn't you think that you saved the day and it turned out good cause you got a big one? I think so."
641366,rocheleauc,2011-11-19 23:19:00,205," Now that I think of it, that's happened to me a few times recently"
641368,Twocoda,2011-11-19 23:23:00,4130,although you set your pesidence higher first thing in the morning....it gives you something to think about until/when/if the next one bites....you know how the saying goes....a bad day fishin...is better then a good day at work...and catching a big or little one in the morning IMO..is not a bad day at all...just some days are better then others...i went 0 for 2 this morning in a couple of hours but it was still a good day  Cheers
641370,misfish,2011-11-19 23:26:00,29133,"Then theres the day you go out,make 8 casts and have 20+ pounds in the well.Thats the day that makes up for those days that you didnt get nada."
641376,mercman,2011-11-19 23:46:00,7054,sigh....... Nope.
641379,Twocoda,2011-11-20 00:13:00,4130,are you suggesting that you have caught a big fish before Paul?
641381,Ralph Field,2011-11-20 00:18:00,1018,There have been many days when catching a big fish in the first five minutes would have been a blessing. When it does occur than I usually have to wait a few hours for the next big one.
641382,Victor,2011-11-20 00:18:00,1609,Big fish any time = good day.
641386,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-20 00:29:00,3761,The couple day's I got into 5lbr's early the bite continued for me throughout...There is always a quite time between 10-1 it seems then it fires up again...Who knows why
641387,Rod Caster,2011-11-20 00:30:00,5784,"  Considering my skunk today, a big fish would have broken my recent ""curse"" of bad luck."
641388,smally21,2011-11-20 00:34:00,993,its kinda like getting back to back birdies on the first two holes - nowhere to go but down....
641398,kickingfrog,2011-11-20 00:58:00,8333,"My immediate response was/is no.  And by the true definition of the word jinx (bad luck/curse) that is the only correct answer, because there is no such thing.  However because we anglers tend to get in our own way sometimes I could invision a scenario where you catch a big fish with a technique/presentation that really shouldn't work based on any number of reasons. You then think you are on a pattern that works and spend the rest of the day fishing based that one fluke fish at the start."

641401,misfish,2011-11-20 01:00:00,29133, 
641411,Rizzo,2011-11-20 01:58:00,4754,every time I get one early I joke that I should just go home because the rest of the day will bring nothing (and most often its unfortunately true)
641414,mercman,2011-11-20 02:38:00,7054,"  Yup, and it doesnt mater if i catch the biggest one first or last either. However, if i keep my fish in a live well, and release them before changing places, I find i get more fish.I find releasing them as soon as i catch them, reduces the amount i catch. Something about pheremones."
641415,misfish,2011-11-20 02:42:00,29133,"  You need a guide, LOL"
641468,mike rousseau,2011-11-20 15:38:00,4661,NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!  any day i get a big fish... my day is made... regardless of what happens next...  the 2 biggest musky i got this year were first fish of the day... we boated 2 more each day after the big ones...  the hard thing is when you boat a pig of a fish all the rest seem so small afterwords...lol
641469,Skipper D,2011-11-20 15:50:00,1970,If you carried a few garlic bulbs and some holy water in the boat i think the jinx thing would just go away .
641471,Skipper D,2011-11-20 15:57:00,1970,"  Thats right Paul , i am taking note's here : don't let them out to go tell the others ..... lol"
