1083920,John Bacon,2023-02-18 03:11:00,3277,I plan to go to the Sportsman Show.  I find that it's usually a bigger show with more to see. 
1083921,16 Footer,2023-02-18 12:09:00,191,I went to the fishing show Friday. It was busy but not big show as in the past. Some big exhibitors like Mercury were missing. Found some deals on tackle but not great. I did met Bob Izumi after his talk.
1083983,Jordansazerland,2023-02-23 12:56:00,2,"Both the Spring Fishing Show and Sportsman Show are significant events for outdoor enthusiasts. If you're more into fishing, the Spring Fishing Show might be a better fit, but if you're interested in a broader range of outdoor activities, the Sportsman Show might be the way to go. It depends on your interests. Either way, you'll have a great time and learn a lot. Consider buying fishing equipment or Hunting Gear Clearance in advance. Have fun!"

1084131,craigdritchie,2023-03-08 11:56:00,1586,"It costs outfitters a lot of money to exhibit at shows. Apart from paying for their travel to the show, and paying for their display space, they also have to pay for a week or so of living in a nearby hotel, and eating virtually every single meal at nearby restaurants. All of this costs money, and since these are often family-owned businesses to begin with, it's hard for them to then start chopping prices on their only way of earning that money back and putting some cash in their jeans.
