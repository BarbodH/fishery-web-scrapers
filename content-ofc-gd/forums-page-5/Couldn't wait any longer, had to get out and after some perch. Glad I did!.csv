1084045,Barry Willis,2023-02-27 00:12:00,180,I should have mentioned - I caught several more right around the 10-11in. range which I released. I love eating fish but seldom keep them. I would like there to be some around for my grand kids grand kids to catch. My grand kids release most all their fish and love to see them swim away.
1084046,lovetofish,2023-02-27 01:55:00,500,I fish a lot and eat fish two or three times a year. I love me a feed of cold water perch and a northern Ontario fish fry of pike or walleye and thatâ€™s it. I catch and release 90% of what I catch. Love to watch the big ones swim away! Nothing better
