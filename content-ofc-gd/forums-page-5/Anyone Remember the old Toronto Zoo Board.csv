1083950,CrowMan,2023-02-20 17:57:00,413,"""It was shorter than melton mowbray"" While we're reminiscing...PorkPies' comment brought back memories of John ""Tiny"" Bennett. Tiny was the outdoors/fishing columnist for the old Toronto Telegram, and then briefly for the Toronto Sun when that paper rose out of the ashes of the Telegram. Tiny, a 6' 5"" 260lb Englishman, was originally from Leicestershire, the home of the Melton Mowbray pie. He once wrote an entire column extolling the virtues of this wonderful concoction...it was his favourite lunch to take fishing. He even published his own family's recipe...as he claimed it could only be made a certain way, with specific ingredients. That column spurred me as a young man to bake my own MM pies...which I still do to this day. Tiny's columns and his book, ""The Art of Angling"" were way ahead of their time...it was his approach to fishing that instilled in me the passion I still have today...to appreciate the activity as a form of ""art"",¬† rather than something where the end result is to just put some food on the table. Even today, his book is still well worth a read. My apologies to the OP for getting¬† sidetracked.  "

1084121,John,2023-03-07 13:09:00,2956,"Don't remember the Zoo Board but joined OFC (OFC) back in the early days, probably more than 20 years ago. Posted a fair bit in the early years then things became silly and there were those that jumped all over anything that was posted. A little like the wild west, LOL. Was invited to an early days Lakair GTG and had a blast and never missed one, not sure how my liver survived but it did. Fond memories of those days and of those that are no longer with us. Some good, no, some great people on this site. Have ongoing long term friendships made at those Lakair GTG's.

1084276,Jon,2023-03-19 16:32:00,209,"This brings back memories. I think it was called, ""What's Biting in the Toronto Area"" and it was the first fishing chat board I ever used. Probably mid-90s. It was run by Andy Rubaczek (might not have the spelling correct) and the url might have been www.zoo.utoronto.ca.¬†I think he was an IT guy with an interest in fishing. Super nice guy and he was active with the Metro East Anglers and Ringwood Hatchery when MNRF stopped running it. I spent a few minutes with Google but couldn't find any info or archived images."
