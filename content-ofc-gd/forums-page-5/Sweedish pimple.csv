I'm used to using the little guys (not sure of the number) about 2 - 2 1/2 in. long for trout, perch, white fish etc. and have had nothing but good success with them. I told the guy having the sale, this for deep sea fishing, he say's yeah, real deep. Any way after our chuckle I got it and an arm full of other goodies for three bucks. I wish he'd had the rod and reel that was used to jig it. Not that I'll ever use it except in my dreams but a cool wall piece.  "
