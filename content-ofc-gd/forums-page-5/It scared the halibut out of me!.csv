After catching a few I headed in. As I got near shore I thought I'd drill a hole out of curiosity. The ice was about 8"" thick and less than two feet of water beneath it. I lied on the ice to see down and dropped in a little Cleo. It was only a matter of seconds and about a six lb. rainbow came in like a torpedo. It startled me so that I swear my whole body came off the ice and went skyward. As I jumped, I inadvertently hooked the rainbow. Happy Days."
