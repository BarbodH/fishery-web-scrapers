1083721,AKRISONER,2023-02-09 20:51:00,5558,Most lakes in the area have a heck of a lot of pike. Most likely small perch and sunnies. Might get lucky and catch a walleye or crappie.
1083722,CrowMan,2023-02-09 22:03:00,413,"Check out the OMNR on-line tool: https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/fishonline/Index.html?viewer=FishONLine.FishONLine&locale=en-CA Looks like there's a bit of everything in there including Pike, both Bass, Whitefish, Cisco and Smelt. What caught my attention is that it's been stocked with Walleye in the past...most recently in 2017 with almost 20,000 fry. They or their progeny may still be swimming around. You'll also see the depth contours...looks like a couple of long points leading in to deep water...probably a good starting point. FYI, if you have Navionics there'sÂ  a chart there too. Best of luck !"
