1083836,GBW,2023-02-14 21:04:00,8460,I am Gooderham area and everything is slush!  I was off work today and didn't even bother to try and fish.  Rather clean up around the house in the + temps on the much needed outdoor work seeing as my road is a slushy river.
1083847,brkygetr,2023-02-15 12:22:00,425,Thanks GBW. Was planning a trip that way this weekend just not sure the ice is gonna hold up with this weather and slush factor.
1083860,AKRISONER,2023-02-15 15:53:00,5558,Speaking from my experience with bad ice this year this thaw might be doing us a favour eating away that really soft problematic layer. A cold snap Thursday and Friday might actually clean up our slush problem and make a bunch of that classic Ontario white ice.
