This morning a couple of nice surprises though. 2 nice jumbos snatching the high hook blood worm. Then the whities came in. 3 swings and miss. Then finally one was so hungry,he nearly swallowed the meegs. Nice morning for sure. Snow still a pita,and calling for more this weekend. DAMIT. Ole well,slow my roll.  Whities tight to the bottom  Nice perch    "
1084070,Barry Willis,2023-03-01 17:34:00,180,Very nice Shag. Beautiful perch and a heck of a nice white fish. You got some nice eating there.
1084072,misfish,2023-03-01 18:47:00,29133,I am not shag. LOL 
1084073,Barry Willis,2023-03-01 18:58:00,180,"Sorry misfish, no disrespect intended, I though I'd seen on some of your posts ""aka Shag"" Any way nice catch. You sure seem very adept at catchingÂ  white fish. Thanks to your grubs you build I expect if I may call them that. I hope I at least got that part right. If not my apologies again. I may have a couple of you guys mixed up. It happens when you're approaching 70years. If you are anything like me you may have been called worse at one time or another Haha. Best regards."
