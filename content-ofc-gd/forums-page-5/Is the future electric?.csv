I just saw it as stating the results from testing of the present lithium battery EV technology.  Kind of hard to assume what advancements there will be. Bottom line is that all batteries don't perform well in cold climates like most of Canada has. Add heavy loads to them and it just gets worse. 
1083973,AKRISONER,2023-02-22 18:53:00,5558,"call me crazy...but if I think of my buddies 2004 chevy, that thing burned like 30+L/100 when towing, we were pulling over to fill up for gas every few hours too and that was just skidoos! I 100% agree, a 2023 ford lightning is probably a terrible option for towing a giant camper, thats the job of a diesel for sure. No different than towing my 20 foot glass boat, it gets towed by a diesel too."
1083976,woodenboater,2023-02-22 20:42:00,2277,"another article from the Globe and Mail, this one about testing EVs in Norway. looks like story is behind a paywall.  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-norway-electric-vehicles/  ""Norway has embraced electric cars like no other country on earth, with batteries powering 79.3 per cent of all new cars sold in 2022. But adoption rates have been slower in Finnmark, where just over half of cars sold last year were electric. In the darkness of Arctic winter, shoppers leave diesel station wagons idling in the parking lot as they stock up on groceries. Not everyone is convinced electric will be better. “The effectiveness of the battery is not so good in this cold,” said Pererik Larsen, a paramedic in Hesseng. His coverage area extends to Bugøynes, a drive of nearly 100 kilometres. As technology progresses and electric range extends, he can imagine using an electric ambulance. But not now. “In this kind of weather, I would be really worried,” he said.  story gets more optimistic about EV however  fwiw, if I can scrounge the pennies, I'm hoping my next vehicle is this https://www.jeep.ca/en/grandcherokee4xe/2022 "

Not a single boat would have been running lithium? Lead acid is basically quickly becoming a dinosaur. Unfortunately I needed new batteries last year and couldnt front the bill for a new charger and batteries to go lithium, but im basically 100% certain when these ones go, ill be making the switch. Ive made the switch for my ice fishing eletronics, to say that im blown away with the performance would be an understatement.

Some of the major automakers are already heavily investing in it as the next wave after lithium. 3 X the capacity and 70 X the charging speed compared to lithium. You will be able to achieve a full charge quicker than filling your tank with gas... Canada is one of the leading producers of graphite (graphene is a derivative). There is a publicly traded company called Northern Graphite that may be worth looking at, if you have some play money in your portfolio."

The disc brake. whoever invented the caliper rotar combo is a bloody wizard, the invention was so good thay not a single manufacturer has a disc brake that is any different than the other. The literal only difference is the composition of the rotars and pads. you want to teach your kid one of the most valuable life lessons? Teach them how to change out pads and rotars, it’s a universal knowledge, I learned how to do it back on my first car, and I’ve done them on every car I’ve owned since. EV’s may throw a stick in the spokes though, I wonder if the regen system gets in the way? I know they still have standard rotar caliper combo’s but my understanding is that they can actually become problematic on EV’s because of their lack of use! They actually seize up prematurely because driving around city driving the driver rarely uses the brakes!"
1083885,CrowMan,2023-02-16 18:30:00,413,"Occasionally, my wife let's me drive her new iX. Yes, braking is a bit of a learning curve...you basically learn to drive with just the accelerator (I was about to say gas...lol) pedal. Although the Beemer does allow you to adjust (0 to 100%) how much re-gen it's using to make it feel more ""natural"". The re-gen system actually makes the vehicle even more ""environmentally friendly""...all that heat that the brakes create is no longer just warming  up the atmosphere....lol Anyway, with the amount that you use the brakes on this thing, I'm sure it's going to be a long time between brake jobs. Just from a cursory look at the set up...the calipers and rotors themselves look identical to an ICE vehicle. I will say this vehicle is incredibly fun to drive...the instant acceleration creates G's that feel like a big hand is pushing you back in your seat...and the handling with the low center of gravity makes this SUV feel like a sports car."
1083889,DanD,2023-02-16 21:28:00,2223,"You're 100% right you will not be doing brake jobs on the vehicle due to ware-out of the pads. Along with what AKRISONER said, you will be doing brake work due to corrosion, seized components, brake rotors with heavy rust scaled; that if you do have to apply the brakes hard, it'll likely all but shake you out of the vehicle. After a couple of years, you may notice that the brake pedal seems to have a bit more travel then it did and once you do feel resistants' on the pedal it will likely feel a bit spongy. Monitor this and when you do notice this, get it in for a brake servicing! It may save you some money, if a tech can clean things up and maybe machine the rotors. I used to service the Canadian Food inspection Agencies vehicles here in London. They had a number of hybrid Ford Escapes. After 2-3 years the brakes looked like they spent their life sitting in a pond. The drivers had all the complaint I listed above. The brake pads looked as they were new thickness wise; but the friction material was beginning to separate from the pad's backing plate. The fix for that was to replace all the brake components at the wheels. An easy grand+ repair, if we could save the calipers. So I'm just giving a heads up!  You say you don't drive the vehicle very often. That a good thing. Your wife will not notice the change in the brakes; due to it happening so gradually. If you can try and remember what the brakes felt like the last time you drove it and then compare it to how they feel the next time. Again if there is extra pedal travel and on a relatively hard braking, if there's a shudder, get it in for a brake servicing. This is not a knock against the EV, it's just the nature of the beast!!!!  Dan... "

1083667,BassMan11,2023-02-07 20:53:00,583,"Right... so who cares about the 6.6 million or so Canadians to where all battery everything wouldn't work. As for the ice auger.... I can get in board with that.... but it's a $700-$900 ice auger... about $200-$300 more expensive that a gas auger. I use a drill myself. The tools are not on the high end... they are what a decent item costs in the battery world. I cited tools from Milwaukee, Ego, Sthil (battery), and an Ecoflow - Delta 6500w electric generator (which are awesome). Not many people who live north of Barrie would have a single stage snow blower so I stand by my Ego $2500 2 stage snow blower. And for the maintenance.. you still have  belts, bearings, drivetrain, shear pins, axels, and rust that all need to be tended to. So is it really that much less yearly maintenance? I guess you don't have to do an oil change? Plus yearly v-power and seafoam which can also be used in other engines throughout the year. I'm really not against the transition for most things as an option... but extremes like what they are doing in California for example seem ridiculous. I'm fine with being the minority... it's quieter out here.... just shouldn't mean I don't matter.  "
1083669,scuro2,2023-02-07 21:25:00,904,"Your price estimate on the snowblower is still high even for the two stage. At Lowes for $2000. But the real issue of course is cost. Global warming is costing us already with crop failures and extreme weather events and insurance. These costs impact everyone no matter where you live. Now imagine the prairies being a permanent dust bowl. Real flooding in much of Florida and other low lying areas. That is coming sooner then later and that is when we are really going to pay. Conservative means to conserve and not waste money. It means to maintain and do things better. Economically I am definitely conservative. I've voted conservative several times. The Conservatives should be leading the charge. They can definitely do it better the Trudeau but if I see repeal the carbon tax there is no way I am voting conservative.  	How do you do it? How do you cut green house gas emissions? It's going to to require a move away from fossil fuels. I see no reason why you can't take into account your address when raising the price of fuel. I live in a city of 30000. I saw a women driving a Hummer. She had high heels on and was 5 ft tall. I'm sure her driveway is short and paved. That sort of lunacy has to be curtailed. If not a hummer I see plenty of huge expensive trucks in driveways for people who don't have a job requiring a truck. Most of these vehicles are spotless, no wear and tear.  	It's got to be a group effort like hydrocarbons and the Ozone layer was. The carbon tax is the solution offered by the brightest minds in the world. It likely will not be enough. Too little too late."

Have the real heavy hitters make significant progress and maybe then we can fine tune some stuff on our end. Until then... I feel like I am doing enough already. Needs to be curtailed? Yikes. Do you really need a Truck? do you really need that boat? Do you really need to burn wood? Do you really need to mow your lawn 5 times a week? Do you really need to keep your house 25 in the winter?...  Where does that end? Until Private Jet travel is looked at... please leave me alone.

1083674,CrowMan,2023-02-07 23:11:00,413,"""but extremes like what they are doing in California for example seem ridiculous"" I was in LA in the late '80's on a business trip. During the week I was there, there was a temperature inversion trapping all the smog in the LA basin. This was before the stricter emissions regulations had kicked in. I was hacking up brown crud for the next week after...and I was a smoker then, so my lungs were already ""broken in"". The air there was literally killing 1000's of people a year...they had to do something. Yes..even small steps help. Countries like China are still building coal-fired generating plants daily, but does that mean we just throw our hands up in the air ? To me, that's the same mentality as...I'll just throw that Tim's cup out the window, because the roadside is already full of trash. It's apparent that we can't just continue on the path we're on and ignore the science. At some point, we have to do something. Do we just keep kicking the can down the road, or start to do at least something. I've got four grandkids...do I just toss the problem in their lap ?   "

Humour me, assume this is totally true and projections are accurate. We are the number one emitter of CO2 per capita and the 7th largest emitter globally. That is not insignificant. Granted there are reasons for this but guess what China is going to say if we make zero progress and they want to keep their coal power plants. You do it together or it doesn't get done. You can ""pay"" now or pay many multiples more in the future.  	The question isn't, ""do you really need"". It's more shaping behaviour through market forces. I don't know why any fossil fuel is subsidized by any government. Gradually make it more expensive to buy gas. Do it so that ALL the taxes collected go directly to all citizens. Less people will buy an ICE Hummer. More people will buy fuel efficient vehicles, perhaps a plug in hybrid or an EV. At some point GM will drop the ICE Hummer line. We saw this in the 70s where people no longer wanted the big gas guzzlers. So it will be again."

1083684,scuro2,2023-02-08 15:27:00,904,We moved from a city house to a lot that is two thirds forest. I bought a lot of electric tools and can comment on them.  	Snow blower - We have a 60ft double driveway. It was only challenged when we had  15inches of snow. The opening of the mouth is smaller than that but it got the job done. It just took longer and I couldn’t complete it all in one go. You could buy a bigger two stage model.  	Pole saw - I'd never buy a gas one.  	Weed wacker - I'd never buy a gas one  	hedge trimmer - I'd never buy a gas one  	Chain saw - it is limited by the length of the blade. I think they top out around 18 inches. The batteries would wear down quickly with say oak that is 3ft thick and you are constantly cutting. I live on ravine and it does 95% of my jobs well. If I have really big stuff I call my brother and we use his gas saw.  	Lawn mower - for most lawns it’s great. It’s not economical to cut your grass when it is really long. It will do the job but burn through the battery quickly. So best is regular cutting. I can usually get both my front and back done on one battery. That is about 70 minutes of cutting.  	Leaf blower - if you got a really big lawn and there are lots of leaves gas would be better.  There are variable settings for the leave blower. Mostly I don't have it on high. On high I could run it for an hour. Gas would blow harder.  	My basic rule of thumb for electric tools is that if you will use the tool consistently for really big jobs gas is better.

1083807,scuro2,2023-02-13 04:29:00,904,I saw a prediction recently that by 2030 half the new cars will be EVs. I can tell you that likely isn't going to happen by 2030. The only company able get you an EV in a few months is Tesla with the model Y which is expensive. Plug-in hybrids like the Rave4 are a 3-5 year wait. Most other EVs are about a 2 year wait. You might be able to get certain models in a year to year and a half. Demand is seriously outstripping supply. Current EV adoption is under 6%. The governments goal is 60% by 2030
1083810,CrowMan,2023-02-13 16:11:00,413,"I don't disagree that demand for EV's is outstripping supply...so I'm not sure why the mfgr's are spending a whack of dough promoting them. Last night on the US feed of the Super Bowl, five different car companies had ads flogging their EV's...at $7 million USD for a 30 second spot. EV's have certainly become mainstream...it wasn't too long ago that the Super Bowl ads were all about who had the toughest, baddest truck. Anyway, it would seem that a lot of new manufacturing capacity it set to come up to speed in the next year or two, to fill the anticipated demand for EV's. On another note...Dave Grohl was featured in a whiskey ad during the game...extolling the virtues of Canada. Nice to see, as the Yanks are usually blind to their northern friends. "
1083817,DanD,2023-02-13 22:10:00,2223,The simple answer propaganda !!!! Feed enough half-truths to the public and they will eventually start to believe anything. Dan...
1083819,CrowMan,2023-02-13 23:23:00,413,"I'm confused. So...a TV commercial from an automobile manufacturer is ""propaganda"" ? Isn't that called ""advertising"" ? Like all businesses big and small have done for 100's of  years ? The same ""advertising"" that is governed by laws that prevent ""half-truths"" and ""lies"" through false or misleading advertising, ie. fraud in the criminal code or state legislation. What are the ""half-truths"" or ""lies"" that Chrysler, Hyundai, GM, etc are promoting in these commercials ? My original statement was just an observation that the mfgr's currently can't keep up with demand for EV's. My wife waited a year for her EV...I'm sure BMW would have preferred to have her money much sooner. So my point was why do they need to bother to advertise EV's at great expense if there's already a waiting list.  Well perhaps I should've elaborated...yes, in business there are other reasons to advertise than just getting the immediate sale...building the brand, protecting market share, customer awareness, etc. I just think using the term "" propanda"" implies something  nefarious on the part of these mfgr's. They, like any business simply want to promote their products. There is obviously a big demand for EV's...for a lot of people (not everybody) they make sense. The mfgr's see that's where the market is headed. I'm sure the last thing the auto mfgr's want to do is to spend a bunch of cash re-tooling their plants and re-training their workers in switching over from ICE vehicles...which they were perfectly happy to produce for the last 100 years or so. Please take no offense...like I said, I'm just confused on why you would use the word ""propaganda"" to describe an ad for a pick-up truck."
1083822,smitty55,2023-02-14 03:49:00,928,"If you notice with all those ads pushing EVs they never talk about any of the negative issues like replacing 25-$30K batteries after 7 years or the fire issues with electrical shorts that even firemen won't touch because its so dangerous, let alone dealing with a northern environment like Canada and having enough power to drive the car along with all other power demands like heating, lights at night and availability of charging infrastructure. It's all about alarmist climate change and making money. I believe China has the biggest supply of Lithium in the world too so that's another huge issue.

I get it, if you need a big truck to haul things for significant distances in the north then EVs are not for you. Most people have none of those needs. The average distance travelled in a day is 50 to 60km. Any EV can handle that no matter what the temperature. Even most plug in hybrids can do that all on that mini battery.   	Like it or not EVs will be the future chosen vehicle regardless of any subsidies. We are in the infancy of EV development. Lithium is expensive and already there are technologies that are better that don't use Lithium. As the batteries become lighter and and more efficient the weight will be similar to ICE cars. The power of the market will decide this one.  	If propaganda decided everything we would be driving Ladas and we there would be the Canadian units pushing towards Kiev with Putin! "

Just like  McDonald's doesn't talk about its French fries making you fat...or Toyota telling you need to change the oil four times a year in its commercials. It's a free marketplace...you absorb the information from advertising and your own independent research and you make a buying decision on what's best for you. I don't believe we're being fed ""propaganda"" in some nefarious plot by 99% of the world's scientists in some kind of  ""alarmist climate change"" scam.

1083828,DanD,2023-02-14 17:35:00,2223,"All ads are a form of propaganda to sway the manufacturer’s ideals on the public.  	You say the mfgrs are following what the people want. I say they are working hard to convince people that EV’s are what they want. Hence all the expensive advertising.  	No offence taken with what you posted.  	When I used the word propaganda I’m not talking propaganda like what Hitler, Goebbles and the Nazis used in the 1930’s to change a countries mind set.  	I just hate when big businesses try and lead people down a path that they may not have ever gone.   	I don’t dislike the EV but it’s hard to find stats on what the estimated EV’s total environmental footprint is or will be. I’m talking right from the manufacturer of materials (batteries especially) required to build, to maintain and the disposal of the vehicle at the end of its useful life. I wonder if the EV is as green as “advertised”? 	I believe that battery powered cars are here for the interim; that's until the hydrogen fuel cell and or hydrogen internal combustion engines are perfected. Even Tesla is working on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Elon Musk has stopped calling them fool cell vehicles now that he’s looking at throwing his batteries in the garbage. BMW and Toyota are in bed together trying to perfect a hydrogen combustion engine. BMW actually have one version of it’s engine in vehicles running around Europe.

1083842,CrowMan,2023-02-15 01:21:00,413,"My background is in HVAC...my company took a long hard look as hydrogen as a potential heating fuel. In a lot of ways it makes sense...afterall, there is already extensive infrastructure in place to transport it to homes and businesses. There are existing cross-country pipelines, pipes under the streets and meters on homes/buildings that currently deliver Natural Gas, and on the surface would seem a seamless transition to hydrogen. However, as Musk alluded to it has issues. The molecule is so small (it's the smallest atom in the universe) that conventional sealing methods can't contain it. Traditional O-rings and pipe thread compounds are ineffective and result in leaks. It's also extremely volatile...see the Hindenburg. None of these are deal breakers...there are existing work arounds. The biggest issue is producing the stuff. At this point, it takes more energy (through electrolysis) to produce hydrogen than the energy that it can provide. Of course, technology is always changing, and down the road who knows, it could be a major player in the energy mix. For now, lithium batteries seem to be the most effe⁶ctive solution as an EV power source. And again to clarify...most Lithium comes from Australia, not China...and we're about to mine it ourselves in Ontario. On top of that, Chrysler and LG are building a $5 Billion lithium battery plant right here in Windsor. We will potentially soon being manufacturing 100% built in Ontario EV's...which I think (as Martha Stewart would say) is a good thing. https://www.northernontariobusiness.com/mining-the-northwest/northwestern-ontario-sees-the-green-lithium-rush-6526470 https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/march/stellantis-and-lg-energy-solution-to-invest-over-5-billion-cad-in-joint-venture-for-first-large-scale-lithium-Ion-battery-production-plant-in-canada  "

1083517,CrowMan,2023-01-27 17:35:00,413,Nuclear power (despite the fear mongering in some media) has proven to be very safe. In the over 65 years that we've had 100's of nuclear power plants around the globe...there have only been three incidents. 1. Three Mile Island...failed due to human error. Basically the equivalent of the Koebel Brothers from Walkerton were running the plant at the time. 2.  Chernobyl....constructed and operated by the Russians... see their track record with commercial aircraft...I think enough said.. 3.

The electric was better in every single imaginable way. I could not think of a single negative to say about it. I wasn’t even aware that these augers feature a reverse button, which of course allowed you to basically push 90% of the ice shavings back down the hole. Once you’d punched through.

The low hanging fruit is coal burning power plants. We have none in Ontario so two stoke motors are another easy target. They can produce a lot more pollution. For most Ontarioians switching out gas powered tools for electric is a wash. The added benefit of electric is that the tool doesn't need oil changes and you don't have to worry about your gasoline in the engine over the winter. It is also a clean and less noisy experience to operate. That and you have a button start, full power as soon as you press it.  	I've got a big lawn and can cut it with one battery, I have a second battery. You would need more then an acre of lawn before gas is necessary. Ditto for electric cars. To me it's a no brainer if you live the GTA and have a detached house to get electric for commuting and regular use. Ditto the snow blower, chain saw etc etc. Some will need gas but the vast majority of people won't. You could encourage this with something as simple as eliminating tax on electric tools. Better is a slowly rising carbon tax. On top of that battery technology is improving all the time. To do nothing will eventually end the civilized world as we know it. Global warming is happening and all us older ones know it. Here we didn't have real winter this year until Jan 23rd.

Are we trading the devil we know for one that we don't? I still think we/they should be working on better management/use of the resources we have. If it turns out to be electric so be it as long as the reactors and coal fired plants are not part of the big business plans to make their profits. I'm being naïve with that last sustenance; everything revolves around profit. The monies that are needed to make change has to show some form of profit to the investor. No profit no change!!! Dan...
1083660,CrowMan,2023-02-07 01:33:00,413,"Yes, some of the stuff in lithium batteries is toxic...but all the components are 100% recyclable. So long as we don't throw them in to landfills it's all good. Just like lead acid batteries, I assume there will be some financial incentive to trade them in, rather than just throw them in the dump. Keep in mind, that with our reliance on oil that we are dependent on a relatively small number of non-local producers (Alberta, Middle East, Russia, etc). The suppliers influence the price on the supply side through organizations like OPEC (I never understood how that is even legal). With electrification, we can produce  energy locally (nuclear, hydro, solar) so we're not hostage to the whim of some Sheiks...blue eyed or not. In fact, you can make your own electricity and not be reliant on anyone...I dont think you can make your own gasoline. Electrical production fosters a lot more competitive market as it can be created in a number of ways on a macro and micro level. At this point, I think the debate is over...whether you like it not...in 30 years ICEs will be niche products limited to few small market segments. "
1083661,scuro2,2023-02-07 12:14:00,904,"Just looked it up, 34 per cent nuclear, 28 per cent natural gas, 23 per cent hydro, 13 per cent wind, one per cent solar and less than one per cent biofuel.  	That is more natural gas then I thought. Likely the natural gas is used to meet peak demand especially during the hottest and coldest parts of the year. Based on those percentages I am assuming it would be more environmentally friendly to power your car from electricity vrs gas. EV cars are not the answer to global warming. I am eyeing one but can't wait 2 years to get one and the model Y is still expensive at about $72000 all in. I'm likely going to buy a used car and then buy in 4-5 years when the EVs will be cheaper and more efficient.  	I did buy solar panels but this definitely is not for everyone. Ideally you want direct sun so your roof has to be positioned right and you can't have much shade hitting the roof. There is a $5000 dollar incentive for this. In the end I did it mainly as an investment. It should pay for itself in 7-8 years. They promised a bit better. The panels should get me at least 30 years of production. No normal household can go off the grid with solar. You do get credits for overproduction from Ontario Hydro which you use up during the winter when the sun is weak. The other key reason I did this was it reduces the need for peak time electricity in the summer. I don't need all the electricity I produce during the day for my air conditioning. It is used by the houses in my neighbourhood for their air conditioning and energy during that time. It will also save OH on transportation costs."

Hopefully you don't wreck any of those batteries because they cost 25K for the SUV and even $350 for the chainsaw.

Now the other electric tools are cheaper then their gas counterparts and they are much cheaper to run and maintain.  Base model EGO snowblower is $899. Electric tools are perfect for a good majority of the population. There are plenty of EV SUVs at $50000 all in and they qualify for a $5000 EV grant. Hybrid plug ins with 80kms of range also. You have gas but if you do all your driving in your community you can mostly run off of the battery. People are doing this type of math and choosing this because it makes economical sense for them. I get it, not for you.  	I'm not sure what you mean by electric generator? Do you mean a solar backup battery? If you need a generator you need a generator regardless of electrical tools. I did not get a solar backup battery. You would need an expensive battery to power your air conditioner. One option I was looking at was installing a switch to your furnace that could hook up to a car battery. You could power your furnace for a while if there was a blackout in the winter. I wonder if anyone on this board has done this? That is the big worry, the cold instead of heat.

Unfortunately, in this country (and frankly around the globe) there's a lot of political pressure to support sunset industries like the oil sands...in my opinion that's money not well spent. Yes, gasoline will never go away completely for some applications, and we still need oil to manufacture plastics...but there is more than enough "" clean"" oil around to satisfy those needs. BTW...average starting cost of an EV is $100k ??? You can buy a Hyundai Ioniq 5 for $48k and get $5K back in gov't rebates. My brother bought one last summer...fantastic vehicle, with great range, quick charge capability and super acceleration...and yes, you have to charge it every 400km, but you have to gas up with a ICE vehicle too. In fact, in some ways it's less time out of your day...you can charge at home rather stopping at the gas station.  "

I remember back around 2000 that emission standards for snowmobiles were introduced. Manufacturers were warned and developed cleaner machines. Hence the 4 stroke and super clean 2 strokes. Government can only require what is possible though and they are pushing and waiting for electric. On the same note, when they offered a good 4 stroke snowmobile I bought one. It saved me a bunch of money on oil and fuel and performed."

Not sure if I'm using the proper wording to make my point; but if anyone tells me that an electric vehicle is 100% or even 50% green I call crap. We all need to look at everything from the first transistor to the last bolt that goes into building these vehicles? Then what is it going to take to build up the infrastructure to run these vehicles. As in generating enough electricity so that Mom and Pop don't miss a rerun of Jeopardy due to a black out. Thousands of miles worth of cabling, tones of solder (Lead) to build all the required electronic components; green my ass. I could go on and on; but I'll go with the flow and see where all this takes us? I believe better money would be spent on developing a better Internal combustion engine for the interim until an alternate power source is found that will be considered ""greener"". I cannot find the link to the video I watched but it was of a highspeed (RPM) engine That could run on anything from fuel oil to hydrogen. Highspeed as in 20,000 plus rpm and only two friction points as in the roller bearings at either end of the crankshaft. Through gearing that rpm can be converted into horsepower. A piston engine is something like 20-25% efficient in extracting the power from it's fuel. This engine is approx. 80-85% efficient. I've looked and looked but I cannot find the link? Dan...

Also in today's news, I see that Suncor and Cenovus (the major oilsands extractors) want a piece of the $15 billion Canada Growth Fund unveiled in the last federal budget. Imo, this is not wise way to invest the taxpayer's money. About 20 years ago, I spent 6 months in Fort Mac selling equipment. The environmental devastation of trying to extract oil from tar embedded in sand made me literally and figuratively sick.

Re:looking at the total energy costs of electric vs oil, yes of course everything has a footprint nothing will be perfect in that regard, it doesn’t mean you should just stop because it’s not perfect, that’s a pretty flawed logic. It would be like saying we should have never built beyond the Wright brother’s kitty hawk because the thing couldn’t fly super sonic. ”green” is a concept not an identified “standard” the certainty is that electric vehicles even with their dirty mines, and additional copper etc are still cleaner than an oil guzzling carbon emitting gas engine.

We are closing nuclear powered plants because they are wore out and the anti nucers won't let us build new ones. China opens new coal fired plants every day.

Clean, endless, safe energy (it shuts down immediately when power input is turned off) and no radioactive waste to deal with.. Yes, it may sound far off...but remember we split the first atom (nuclear fission) in 1942...the first large scale nuclear reactor was supplying electricity to cities by 1958..

Humans although we are disgusting, war mongering, polluting plague to the planet, also are incredible purely for our minds. thats what people need to remember here, remember that electric cars weren’t even on the road in 2010! Tesla are now one of the biggest auto manufacturers on the planet, and every single other major auto maker has electric vehicles that you see on the road every day. 10 years is a literal blink of the eye in the grand scheme of things. heck many of you on this forum see me as a young bozo…the internet didn’t even exist when I was born imagine the limits of human engineering with this relatively brand new electric vehicle technology. It’s kind of mind blowing when you really think about where this can go. I really have no doubt that I’m not much time at all relatively that we are going to see battery tech that allows for most vehicles to easily go 1000+km on a charge. We’re already up to 600-7with the original technology. my friends bought a Tesla this year and drove to florida in it, they stopped a total of 4 times for 30 minutes+ so effectively, the drove to florida and drove the same way that anyone would lol. Every mall, etc that they needed to stop at had chargers. Their total bill for “fuel” for the trip was something like $30 there and back.

The battery, at least on the 7.5e model, loads into the top of the motor and is removable, so you can swap it out for a second battery if you run low.   This is a sensible arrangement and given its size, there should be plenty of capacity. I was skeptical of my electric lawn mower when I got it, but it goes a long, long time with a battery not much bigger than what I have on my drill.  These are first steps, but it's pretty clear this is the future. I can tell you one thing - when you hit the throttle with an electric outboard it doesn't take a second or two to rev up to speed like a gas engine does. You get full throttle to the prop instantly, so the hole shots are just unbelievable. The motors are also silent, no fumes, no messing around with fuel, loads of advantages.

1083364,craigdritchie,2023-01-12 15:19:00,1586,"Mercury didn't release pricing info for its new motors at CES, but it's a pretty good bet they will have that later this month when the Toronto Boat Show opens. I would expect it to be in the same range as its competitors (i.e. $3k to $4k) but that's only a guess on my part. As far as electric aircraft go, some people may have missed the announcement last fall that Air Canada is buying 30 electric planes from Heart Aerospace. These will be used on short-haul flights ... Toronto to the Soo, for example. They're supposed to enter service within 5 years, so that's pretty exciting. Widespread electrification is becoming reality, it's no longer just science fiction that might happen one day, maybe, perhaps, somewhere far off in the future. It's happening right now. This year's CES was a real eye opener, it is amazing how much things have changed since before the pandemic. The number of electric cars, bikes, trucks and boats on display there was unreal."
1083365,Dara,2023-01-12 16:12:00,3052,I guess they better get at building some generating stations to charge these batteries. I know I won't be able to afford the gas to do it with my 2200 Honda. Sure would make for a nice quiet ride to Toronto from here. As long as they don't make the seats smaller than the current Dash 8's
1083370,limeyangler,2023-01-13 00:34:00,5204,mic drop….awesome.
1083371,Dara,2023-01-13 00:49:00,3052,"I could get SOOOO political here, and with the quoted post...LOOOL"
1083372,limeyangler,2023-01-13 00:52:00,5204,You’re not the only one.
1083373,Weeds,2023-01-13 01:07:00,782,Let sleeping dogs lie. Interesting thread. In the pic with the bank of 3 of them  I think they look vaguely like some kind of high tech urinals.  The props might make you hesitant though..
1083374,Dara,2023-01-13 02:14:00,3052,Not going there either. To me they look like the old Chrysler outboards in the 70's
1083380,BassMan11,2023-01-13 14:58:00,583,Neat idea. This is where we are going I guess. But i'd rather an old 2 stroke that will run forever if maintained properly.
1083383,Dara,2023-01-14 00:35:00,3052,And I wish we had enough ice and snow to enjoy winter

1083302,captpierre,2023-01-07 22:43:00,2521,Equivalent to 3.5hp 4 str Can run 1 hr 20 min at full throttle on 1 fully charged lithium battery

1083305,Fisherman,2023-01-08 00:55:00,7201,Don't forget 20 feet of rope for a tow and oars. 
1083306,dave524,2023-01-08 01:15:00,4508,Looks like an old McCulloch outboard 😜
1083307,Dara,2023-01-08 03:24:00,3052,A bit more voltage and power but basically an electric trolling motor. Just keep making better batteries. The rest is easy
1083308,DanD,2023-01-08 19:43:00,2223,"You'll still need to haul gasoline with you for the generator, that's to recharge the boat's motor's battery. Not just any old generator either, an inverter type that won't burn out the motor's electronics with unstable charging voltage. I agree 100%. When there's a battery that can deliver a minimum  of 4X's the available power or maybe better said longevity then I might be interested? Dan..."
1083309,AKRISONER,2023-01-08 19:46:00,5558,"Absolutely, everything about electric is higher performance than any ICB. the battery tech just needs more advancement but that doesn’t seem very concerning when you consider how far the tech has come just within the past 8? Years. boats especially, how often are you driving your outboard 300+km in a trip?  the battery tech to troll all day already exists, heck most of us have an electric motor on our boats already and use it all day. imagine the hole shot?! 😮"
1083311,DanD,2023-01-08 20:24:00,2223,Yeah the bottom end torque that electrics have is very impressive. It's the longevity of the battery that concerns me? It would be like herring your motor running out of gas. It's easy and cost effective to have a second fuel tank. At this point in time you can't say that about an extra battery. Dan..
1083312,glen,2023-01-08 20:28:00,2641,Battery is expensive.  I do 250km on trips.   	It’s still 20y away for most boats.
1083315,OhioFisherman,2023-01-08 23:14:00,6623,No other mfgs batteries will fit it by design? Eliminates competition?
1083316,Spiel,2023-01-08 23:17:00,9065,"And when we run out of child mined lithium, then what?"
1083317,AKRISONER,2023-01-09 00:08:00,5558,I guess the same answer as when we run out of blood stained saudi oil?
1083318,AKRISONER,2023-01-09 00:09:00,5558,250km in a single boat ride…you can appreciate that this is just a wild outlier of regular usage when referring to the recreational boating market.  
1083319,Fisherman,2023-01-09 00:36:00,7201,"Now suppose someone goes to a derby that lasts a couple days to a week such as the Owen Sound Spectacular.  Where do you charge overnight.  Or you go and rent a cottage for a week somewhere,  will they have charge facilities."
1083320,glen,2023-01-09 02:05:00,2641,Boats take a lot of energy to move.  Imagine the size of the battery it would take to replace 20gal of gas.  It takes two big batteries to run a trolling motor.
1083321,Terry,2023-01-09 02:11:00,14456,And carrying to a back lake where you have a boat cached
1083324,woodenboater,2023-01-09 22:16:00,2277,"imagine if they could fuel cell outboards ? byproduct is water sooo... E-outboards are likely going to happen but will not be cheap. With LiFePo batteries, the area under the deck could be waterproof storage. An option to separate the banks in half so you run half the bank going out, and keep the second as backup. guy can dream I guess lol"
1083325,Fisherman,2023-01-09 22:31:00,7201,"Imagine the weight of the boat, a Tesla car battery weighs about 1500 lbs, I would guess a boat battery would weigh around 400 to get any time/distance."
1083326,OhioFisherman,2023-01-09 22:54:00,6623,"25 - 30 years ago? Minnkota was marketing hp electric motors, I believe theirs was 3 1/2 hp. Who's battery is better, merc or yamaha? lol"
1083328,Dara,2023-01-09 23:46:00,3052,I'm reading 750 watts at the prop which what I see is 1 hp What am I missing with 4 stroke
1083329,Dara,2023-01-09 23:50:00,3052,Couple years ago my son staked a claim bearing lithium in NWT. Lets see how that pans out    
1083334,Spiel,2023-01-10 15:35:00,9065,"The truth we don't need Saudi oil, we have plenty here we just need to get government out of the way."
1083335,AKRISONER,2023-01-10 15:40:00,5558,"I think some folks might be perceiving me as some kind of activist, I’ll make it abundantly clear, I drive a straight piped diesel truck that tows my boat that has a smoking two stroke on it. Such is the reality of boating in 2023 on a 35 year olds budget. Ya I’d love a new fuel sipping four stroke but it’s just not my financial reality.  but, as mentioned “one can dream” and the dream when you read into what’s going on in this space isn’t as far fetched as it seems. What’s perhaps most impressive and truthfully not something people can argue about is that the performance of electric engines is so high that in most ways except cost at the moment they outperform ICB’s. like most new technology the price decreases with time. It’s very very conceivable that in 30 years time you’d look back and laugh at the fact that you used to burn gas to power your boat. Especially with your new ultra performance electric outboard that outperforms your old gas engine in every way possible. remember, icb’s have been around 100+ years, companies have been provided with 100 years to improve and fine tune the things and maximize their efficiency. I don’t think a single person in this thread would willfully trade in their new 2020+ yamaha Honda or merc 4 stroke for a 1970 Chrysler outboard lol. give electric outboard companies 100 years to fine tune their stuff, holy cow the possibilities. On the weight issue? Sitting in my garage as we speak I’ve got 4 group 31agm’s in my boat, plus a 200hp outboard (remember you don’t need a heavy motor!), plus a full tank of 100 litres of gasoline, plus a tank of oil in my boat…the weight difference, is nowhere near as far as you think."
1083336,AKRISONER,2023-01-10 16:01:00,5558,I personally wish I could figure out a way to make the extraction of crude from the oil sands even 1% more efficient. Lots of companies working on this stuff. Then I could buy every boat I’d ever want lol.
