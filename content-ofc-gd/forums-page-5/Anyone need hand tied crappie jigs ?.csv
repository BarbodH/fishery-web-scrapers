He even went out of his way for me and brought in flat black for my bug jigs. Ugli Boys Baits. Thanks Bruce for stepping up. Also received my craft fur.   "

Snip out the binding thread and you get a good piece like that to tie streamers and tails. I don't think mine has blue/purple though. Take a look in the hair section in there too. The sell packs of small hair elastics in a bunch of different sizes widths and colors - most packs are nicely mixed. These make great body winding for those ice bugs, caddis flies too"
