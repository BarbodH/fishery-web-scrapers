Or maybe getting old is killer.ðŸ¤¯ 	Fish were tight to the bottom under all the herring and smelts. They would come in,but move on by. Finally the bait fish moved along and the it only took 5 min to hook up. One on the meegs , the other on a high hook preg scud I tied. 	Will be in the smoker in the AM.     "
