1083585,Big Cliff,2023-02-01 08:08:00,6899,"I finally got out ice fishing on Monday, last year it was a struggle to get enough decent perch for a feed, not a problem this year. I am not going to give you a number but from the time we got there until we left it was one after another, often with both of us pulling up double headers at the same time. There were a few dinks but most of them were 10+"" with a few monsters thrown in. I can honestly say it was probably the best day catching I can ever remember. (We both only kept about 20 fish) Conditions out there were pretty good, ice seemed to be 8- 10 "" but there seemed to be quite a bit of slush building up by the end of the day. Days like that I am glad i go out with an operator, it's worth the money for me to not have to worry getting stuck, that's work for a young man üòä Once again, thanks to Tim Hales and his crew for another fantastic day!
