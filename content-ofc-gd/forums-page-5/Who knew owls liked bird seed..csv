1083555,BillM,2023-01-30 01:43:00,17367,He's definitely not there for the seed lol
1083557,crappieperchhunter,2023-01-30 14:20:00,2582,Great picture Lew. We have all kinds of furry and feathery critters at our feeders at the cottage but never an Owl. Thx for sharing.
1083558,Beans,2023-01-30 15:08:00,3339,Our old pal Photoz had a knack for finding and photographing them...I have a lot of his pictures on file... Never see any hereabouts but sumpin' around here eats the mice we catch and dispose  of in the woods
