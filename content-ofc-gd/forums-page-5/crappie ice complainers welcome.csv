I do gotta laugh‚Ä¶we almost had a perfect set up with a couple of cold nights lined up to tighten things up a bit‚Ä¶nah forget that if that‚Äôs going to happen, better get a quick insulating dumping of snow in just as the thermometer hits 0 again‚Ä¶we can‚Äôt win this year I tell ya."
1084023,LefroyFisherman,2023-02-25 13:21:00,602,"My bay at 7th line of Innisfil, is finally decent, me and my boy went this past Monday, man it was super windy. The wind ripped out a peg for the pop out and popped the side into us lol. But we managed to catch a feed of Perch. Looks like we might have a bit of a season, getting colder again."
1083664,AKRISONER,2023-02-07 18:22:00,5558,"I know im long long longggg overdue for a report, but planning a wedding, renovating a house, work and of course fishing get in the way. Welcome to the thread where you can complain about the ice conditions on your local water hole. This fish may be one of only a handful of laketrout caught through a hole in the ice on the great lakes this year. You would think -31 degree temperatures would freeze water, instead we managed to lose ice this past weekend due to the intense wind, breaking up about 300 yards of ice, while also flooding the ice that I was fishing on with 6+inches of water. All i can say is, thank god for my (now defunct) Kast steelhead gloves that allowed for me to pull my tent's pegs out of the ice while they were under 4 inches of water in -22 with dry warm hands. The walk home through that knee deep snow and water was absolute hell, the slush instantly freezing to the bottom of my sled making a 300 meter walk back to the truck taking over half an hour. I actually started laughing maniacly at one point while trying to pack up my already busted up tent, the broken pole within managed to twist itself inside of another set of poles making it effectively impossible to fold away entirely without entirely re-deploying the tent, which was now impossible due to the 60kmh winds and water on the ice. I gave up, folded it best as i could into a pile on the sled and strapped it down. I found ice that ranged in depth from 8 inches to 2 50 meters apart from one spot to the next...at this rate we will be boating in no time.   "

1083678,CrowMan,2023-02-08 01:29:00,413,"Yeah...the ice conditions definitely suck this year. On the other hand, the glass is half full. The mild temps and liquid precip have kept the tribs open, and the migratories coming in at a steady pace. Much prefer to play with chrome on 13 ft of graphite rather than a 2 ft stick through a hole. Trout can't do cartwheels through the ice. Best winter Steelheading in 20 years.  "

It‚Äôs actually incredible how bad it‚Äôs getting right before our eyes. We used to get a thaw in the winter sometimes even two, a warm day here and there, I can never recall where 7 to 10 degrees above 0 for weeks on end was the dominant weather pattern in winter. a guy on my parents road said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived here 40 years I‚Äôve never seen this bay not freeze‚Äù when we asked about ice conditions the first year we moved to the new place, 3/4 of the bay froze, the rest is wide open water."
