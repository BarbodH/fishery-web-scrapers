60882,Northhunter,2007-04-16 21:50:00,214,It's 33 now. They're saying 29 injured.  I can't come anywhere close to imagining what the people there are going through now.
60925,dsn,2007-04-16 23:06:00,1018,Yeah its really sad and disturbing. They said this month is the anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting. And some folks are trying to immetaite that event.   its scarey

60998,fishergirl72,2007-04-17 01:10:00,455,My heartfelt condolences go out to the families and friends of the victims.
61018,oxcowboy,2007-04-17 02:09:00,544,"this is a very sad day not only for virginia tech, but for the entire u.s. and the world even.  this is such a senseless crime for all of humanity.  you can throw race,religion, political beliefs out the window, this wacko did nothing for the world.  there is no point, or agenda for such a rampage.  boo hoo your girl broke up with ya, go have a few beers and find another one.  what is wrong with people these days?  i have been screwed over by countless women, and the thought of killing a bunch of strangers would be the farthest thing from my mind.  i have spent a little time on the v-tech campus, i even thought of going to vt for awhile, but then decided on a college closer to home. i have some friends that went to school there,(graduated)  it seems like a great place for college, and excells in  many different majors.  i wish all of the students and especially the families of all the victims the strength to get through this horrible time.  it is truly a sad day for the human race.  jason"
61030,bigfish1965,2007-04-17 02:22:00,3382,"Out of respect to the families, I have cleaned up this thread. Please express your sympathies, but show some decorum and do not make this a thread about politics or gun control. We all know which side everyone is on and for now, it is irrelevant."
61036,irishfield,2007-04-17 02:30:00,26272,THANKS Rick ! From a father with a daughter in an Engineering program...
61046,wayne gatt,2007-04-17 02:47:00,7,"I would like to send out my prayers to everyone directly affected by this senseless waste. In the coming days and weeks there will be lots said as to what could, why didn't, may be if, well it's too late.  What it is, is time to understand that today is not yesterday and yesterday will never happen again. Change is what is required and it is the type of change that affects everyone. This too is not new, may be some day it will be understood and the action(s) required to stop these terrible things from taking place will come to pass.  Bless all those gone; hopefully the strength to shoulder the burden given them will be given, to the many that now desperately need it."
61052,finfan,2007-04-17 03:19:00,44,"What has this world come too? Thoughts and prayers for all the families effected by this senseless crime. May god grant those killed eternal rest, love and peace."

61101,ccmtcanada,2007-04-17 11:56:00,7971,Heard on the news on the way into the office that there may have been two separate gun men....unrelated incidents.  A possible murder/suicide in a dorm room (domestic in nature)...and then a few hours later another gunman stormed the campus which resulted in the remainder of the killings/injuries.  Very sad none-the-less.....
61103,Gerritt,2007-04-17 12:07:00,6129,"Cliff,  I heard different, The Gunman was Asian in decent, a Chinese National, and this happened after his GirlFriend left him.   Gerritt."
61109,ccmtcanada,2007-04-17 12:32:00,7971," Gerritt...yeah...that's the problem when no real info is available yet....I heard it on 680 news this morning and I just checked their website and this is part of their story....  ""The two attacks associated with the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that killed 33 people and wounded 15 came two hours apart, with the second one leaving 31 dead, including the gunman.  The motives for both shootings are yet known; however, earlier reports indicated that the first shooting incident at West Ambler Johnston, a co-ed dormitory, in which two people were killed, may be a separate, domestic incident.  It has been reported that he may have been an ex-boyfriend of the first victim, a woman who was killed in the dorm, but police have not confirmed that information.  Steger has said it is still unclear if there were two shooters, as the investigation is still unfolding.""  http://680news.com/news/topstory/article.j...416_104923_3216"
61120,Hookset,2007-04-17 13:27:00,367,"Sad that people can be taken from us in such a way. Disease, accidents, those we lose in fighting for our country, all tend to be regarded as facts of life that all of us face daily, right or wrong. But when the young, healthy, and innocent are taken in a senseless act there can be very few answers as to why. Our freedom and the cost of it will be questioned. Reactionary questions about security and policing will be thrown about but in the end how can you secure yourself from an act such as this and still live in a truly free society ?  I know one thing for certain. Here is proof of the importance of every single day we spend alive on this planet. Family and friends can be gone in the blink of an eye."
61122,lew,2007-04-17 13:46:00,12767," That sums it up right there Hookset, well said !!  Cherish your friends and family while you have the chance....you just never know."
61123,TennesseeGuy,2007-04-17 13:56:00,957,"Ballistics tests indicate all shootings were by same weapons, a 9 MM handgun and a .22-cal handgun.  Probably only one shooter.  Shooter was a 23 year old student from South Korea, majoring in English.  Cho Seung-Hui.  SN were filed off both guns."
61125,Marty,2007-04-17 14:03:00,873,Yesterday was a tough day.  My nephew is an engineering major at Virginia Tech.   Our family had a rough couple of hours yesterday.   Communication was virtually shut off for some time.   We have counted our blessings.  He's safe.
61126,ccmtcanada,2007-04-17 14:05:00,7971," Happy to hear your nephew is safe and sound...and I was wondering if anyone on this board had any ties to students at that school.  Very sad for all students, staff, friends and family that have to work through this."
61145,fishergirl72,2007-04-17 14:58:00,455, I am very glad to hear that he is safe! Please give him our best wishes and prayers to his schoolmates.
60709,urbanangler1990,2007-04-16 17:42:00,933,"just heard this in the news just now, school in virginia witnessed a shooting that killed 22 people including the gunmen, wow, this is terrifying..."

60720,Joey,2007-04-16 18:02:00,9122,"Just terrible.  I say bring back the schoolyard fight, with fists, the way it used to be.  Never heard of shootings back then.  Joey"
60727,Deano,2007-04-16 18:07:00,767,"I agree Joey, the zero tolerance just makes kids store the anger until one day they blowup. Terrible tragedy"
60733,Rich Clemens,2007-04-16 18:09:00,3131,Well my friends .... it's geting worse.   The one news channel just reported the death toll is now over 30.  Simply unbelievable that anyone would even consider doing such a thing.  What's this world coming to  ??
60743,GbayGiant,2007-04-16 18:17:00,1780,Unbelievable.
60753,solopaddler,2007-04-16 18:32:00,8605,What a nightmare
60756,ehg,2007-04-16 18:36:00,2666,They have upped the death toll to 31 people now. What an unnerving tragedy. Very sad stuff.
60757,misfish,2007-04-16 18:37:00,29133,"  Ah those were the days. A good  kick,n never hurt no one   ,made new friends if anything.   Thats just a cowardly act."
60763,blaque,2007-04-16 18:41:00,2419,"Its unfathomable what goes thru someones mind that would bring them to such a disregard for people, lives, families, children, its just pure evil. I believe there is a God, just as there is a devil. And a situation like this proves the latter!"
60782,RobHall,2007-04-16 19:10:00,261,  31?   holy ....this is tragic news.  It's got to be the worse rampage mass killing ever.  My heart goes out to the families of those killed in this horrific act.   FOTB
60793,PatrickGG,2007-04-16 19:20:00,562,"I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach after reading the article, I just cant imagine these kids sitting in a class room doing there work and some wack job walks in and starts shooting its terrible to even think how the parents are feeling, my prayers go out to the families that lost there kids."
60800,irishfield,2007-04-16 19:27:00,26272,Sick feeling for sure...I had CNN on in the shop when it came on about the shooting and haven't changed the channel. Makes a father with two daughters off at different Universities heart flutter I'll tell yah.
60801,Landlocked,2007-04-16 19:32:00,171,I was thinking the same thing Irish...sure makes a guy want to go home and give his young boys a good hug.  RIP
60802,huntervasili,2007-04-16 19:32:00,1604,"That is sick these pieces of scum are sick minded and horrifying to say the least. I could not even begin to comprehend what this and other murdurers could possibly be thinking. There are not words to describe it, but my sorrow goes out to all who were affected by this evil coward."
60805,urbanangler1990,2007-04-16 19:35:00,933,"hmm i wonder what they are gonna come up to with as a reason for this act, they are menatlly challenged, and its not their fault, thats usually whats said, no excuse for this!"
60809,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-16 19:40:00,181,Who would someone do such a thing? That makes you wonder! That's unbelievable!
60810,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 19:40:00,208,"that is tragic, unbelievable,  and sick,  it should be mandatory for schools to have metal detectors and xrays, sure it may go against human rights or whatever, but damn! when is that crap going to end??  im not blaming video games... Bud"
60821,Daplumma,2007-04-16 19:51:00,1961,"Its up to 31.The school is a very popular college,Virginia Tech.Not a whole lot of details out just yet.Really scary for the parents whose kids are there. Joe"
60830,Cowman,2007-04-16 20:03:00,18,"Daplumma, i heard 31 were killed too, is there a count on how many people are injured yet?"
60854,Daplumma,2007-04-16 20:47:00,1961,"They are not releasing much info,I know a lot of kids were hert jumping out of windows.There is something weird about this whole thing.Usually they have a descpition of the gunman and the types of weapons used but none of that this time.Wonder if it was a terrorist attack?Time will tell. Joe"
60856,lew,2007-04-16 20:56:00,12767," Joe, it was reported up here a couple hours ago that he used 2 handguns then committed suicide."
60858,blaque,2007-04-16 21:01:00,2419,"I believe i read he used a 9mm and a 22 caliber handgun. They werent counting out terrorism , well........not the way they refer to terrorism these days. Its definitely terrorism, but may or may not be linked to ""middle eastern terrorism"" lets call it. They definitely havent put out any description of the gunman though, that i know of anywya."
60859,steverowbotham,2007-04-16 21:03:00,1800,"Fox just reported 32 people killed, including the gunman.  Described as quiet, and kinda wierd but overall a nice guy.  Seems to me thats how they are all described, which is why I never befriend anyone I'm not sure about, but I never pick on them either."
60861,Big Cliff,2007-04-16 21:05:00,6899,What a very sad day this is that so many innocent lives should be lost for no apparent reason. That someone should be so sick in todays society that they could do something like this and no one saw it coming or did nothing about it really makes you wonder. I truly believe that when they took the strap out of school and stopped making kids accountable for their actions they started a trend that will cost many more lives before the pendulum swings the other way.
