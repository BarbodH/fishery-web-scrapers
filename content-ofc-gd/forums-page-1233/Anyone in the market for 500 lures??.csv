I like the ones where guys sell their personal collection, I've bought a nice lot on Ebay for like 50 or 60 musky lures a couple years ago that I still use, it ended up being a huge deal.  Nevermind, he does sell mixed lots."
61045,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-17 02:47:00,1351,that is true... 500 of the same stuff.. however the 100 lot is mixed.  me thinks ebay is getting alot of attn on this board... going to start having bidding wars against our own members and jacking up the prices..lol ahh shoot
