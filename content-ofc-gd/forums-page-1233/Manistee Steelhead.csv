60671,easton13th,2007-04-16 16:27:00,371,Absolutely stunning report! Great pics...Congrats on the day..Looks like a blast and some fish to boot.
60684,Moosebunk,2007-04-16 16:40:00,3970,"Stunning stuff.  Another ""kick in the head"" great bow report with super pics.  Makes me just the slightest, teenie weeniest bit envious."
60721,ehg,2007-04-16 18:04:00,2666,"Great story and pictures!   Maybe if Ontario MNR stocked more steelhead and opened a few select rivers a little more, we wouldn't have to travel to Michigan or Ohio, but could contribute to the economy here. Just a thought.  Again great post and excellent pictures!  ehg"
60768,solopaddler,2007-04-16 18:45:00,8605," Actually, I like the way the OMNR manages our steelhead by and large. The basic difference between Ontario and the States is they're into stocking and we're into habitat enhacement. The vast majority of the fish running our rivers are wild and there's definitely something to be said for that. Now, as far as never travelling to places like Michigan and Ohio? The reason I go is to experience different water and new challenges, not to catch fish. If all I was interested in was catching fish I'd head east of Toronto and beat those waters to froth with my float There's just soo many incredible rivers to fish! That's what makes being an avid steelheader living in this region so great And hey, thank's for the kind words everyone!"
60871,canadian_copper,2007-04-16 21:27:00,925,hard to make me jealous but mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!! dreamy waters and beauty steel!!! great report guys!!!
60992,majorlifts,2007-04-17 00:59:00,171,"NOW THAT IS A SWEET POST!!!! Good times and really nice pics. The water and the background look beautiful, and the fish, well....hey, BONUS!!!"
61011,ccmtcanada,2007-04-17 01:58:00,7971,"Wow...you're reports just keep getting better!  Seemed like only a few months ago the pics were a little fuzzy...kinda 70's loooking...oh wait...that was a few months ago...LOL.  Anyhow, I dream of having outings like you have!!!  Great work...sounded like a great time!"
61088,solopaddler,2007-04-17 09:14:00,8605," LOL! You guys are gonna see a few more of those fuzzy reports They're actually not all that old, it's just that I don't have a proper scanner and was just taking a picture of the photographs with my digital. I've got a few more canoe trips from the archives I've been meaning to post."
61097,ccmtcanada,2007-04-17 11:45:00,7971," I know they are not that old...you've explained that in your previous posts...I'm just yankin your chain....LOL.  Seriously though, your trips, results, pics and reports are absolutely amazing.  Your threads are always a must read for me.  Now..I gotta find out how to get on board the good ship solopaddler....LOL   I can carry bait, gear and I can gather a mean stack of firewood....haha."
61105,aniceguy,2007-04-17 12:19:00,1094,"[quote  Now..I gotta find out how to get on board the good ship solopaddler....LOL   I can carry bait, gear and I can gather a mean stack of firewood....haha.   I ve been steelheading a very long time and I have meet thousands upon thousands of steelheaders both die hard and float dunkers alike, having fished with solo a few times the dude is all out hardcore and one of the nicest guys I have shared a drift in all those yrs.....  Nice pics for sure solo"
60370,solopaddler,2007-04-15 22:53:00,8605,"Well, last Thursday as we packed our gear for our long weekend steelhead trip to Ohio, we were dismayed to find that most of the rivers down there were blown and more rain was in the forecast for Friday. Things didn't look great! Ohio stocks Manistee strain fish in their rivers, and, as mentioned before they're a particularly large, robust strain. After checking conditions on the net we decided to switch gears and head to the actual source where these Ohio fish originate from: the Big Manistee river in Michigan's upper peninsula, a good 61/2 hour drive from home. For veteran steelheaders around the great lakes the Big Manistee is revered, in fact it's almost considered holy water The area is gorgeous having a real Muskoka flair to it, with lots of granite rock and big white pines. It's truely beautiful. The river is big and broad averaging over 200' in width in spots, clear, but with a tea stain to it, and having some powerful currents which make landing fish a big challenge! I was last at the Big M 15 years earlier, so for me this was also a walk down memory lane, and I loved every minute of it! The highest concentration of fish is at Tippy dam and the coffer above it. The coffer dam stops the migration of fish in the river making it a mecca for steelheaders.  That's where we headed Here's me with my first fish, a spunky little hen:    My buddy Dave with a nice buck and a close up shot of the same fish:      Me with a small buck:    Andrew fighting a nice buck, a close up pic, then the release:        A decent buck that I caught:      Andrew with another:    Me with another buck and some nice close up shots:        Paul fighting a nice one, and landing it.      Me with a nice buck (when standing way out in deep water sometimes you've got to improvise with how you hold your rod  )    Me with another, and the release      Paul fighting another with Dave getting ready to help    Davey with a nice steelie and a bonus brown      Me with another      Close-up of another of Paul's fish      Andrew checking out Tippy dam    A view of the coffer dam above it    Davey and then me with another      It was just an unbelievable trip! We shared a lot of laughs over the 21/2 days, experienced some great weather, and caught a TON of fish! The shots I posted here are just a fraction of the actual numbers involved, it really was epic  Hope you enjoyed,  cheers,  Mike"
60374,Joey,2007-04-15 23:00:00,9122,"Wow, super pictures and a great report.  Thanks.  You guys really are out deep in that water!!  Joey"

60393,wallacio,2007-04-15 23:32:00,475,"That was another amazing road trip Mike!   I have to admit, I wasn't too enthralled about the idea of a 6 hour journey but it was definitely worth it to fish one of the most famous steelhead rivers east of the Rockies.    In the end, when you go with good friends the miles just melt away.   I look forward to exploring the rest of Michigan's fabled waters with you guys!!!"
60395,fishindevil,2007-04-15 23:34:00,6254,"WOW...what an awsome fishing trip.  ..thanks for sharing all your pics ,and that detailed report..thats a trip of a lifetime and you guys caught a ton of steelhead and had a blast doing it.man those fish had great colors to them,and were all very nice sized they must have all put up a great fight with all that current as well i sure wish i was there the scenery sure looks alot nicer than the creeks and rivers we have around here,and that river looks like it had a decent flow to it,no wonder its a number 1 rated steelhead river..  ..great trip thanks for sharing    cheers"
