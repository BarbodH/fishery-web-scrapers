Staying on the north side on the lake near cache bay we are going to be going after a little bit of everything.  Looking for the big pike, walleye, perch, and whatever else we may catch.  We are taking a boat with us and it has a 115 hp engine so we can move around pretty quickly.  What is the best plan of attack this time of year?  Any help would be much appreciated.  thanks!!!"
