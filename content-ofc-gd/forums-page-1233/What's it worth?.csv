60797,jil101ca,2007-04-16 19:21:00,41,I have an opportunity to buy a 14' princecraft with trailer and a Honda 9.9hp. The boat is 4/5 years old as is the trailer. The motor is also 4/5 years old with very little hours of use.There are no toys on the boat and the motor has electric start. Everything has been well maintained. How much would this boat package be worth?

60808,jil101ca,2007-04-16 19:38:00,41,"lol, the guys think you called me, I popped into chat just after you left."

60825,specktacklure,2007-04-16 19:57:00,56,I'm a dealer and looked in the book and without seeing it a 14ft tin can is $3300 and the motor is worth around $1600.These are just ballpark sight unseen but if you say it's in good condition total package around $5000 .Do not pay more than five !!!! hope this helps
60841,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-16 20:22:00,4399,I`ll say don`t pay 5 grand you can get a new rig like that for 5 grand or so.  3k max for the used but hey I`am a cheap bugger.
60878,Big Cliff,2007-04-16 21:40:00,6899,"Joyce, I am not a dealer or anything but I did a bit of looking on the internet and I think lookinforwalleye isn't too far off base here. Regardless, it is still a used package and I would think $3500.00 is probably in the right ball park. That would probably be my Max. on that package."
60886,Terry,2007-04-16 21:54:00,14456,I'm with Big Cliff on this one  $3500.00 is about right
60953,jil101ca,2007-04-16 23:40:00,41,"Thanks guys for the input, it is a very nice outfit. I know the person who is selling and i know it hasn't seen much water in the last 2 years. The price is $3500. We are doing some number crunching and trying to work out a payment plan but he wants the cash up front. So i don't know......All we can do is try."
60959,lew,2007-04-16 23:57:00,12767,"Good luck with the purchase Joyce, Princecraft is an excellent boat."
60965,GbayGiant,2007-04-17 00:06:00,1780,$2690 with the six finger discount.  
60985,Mike the Pike,2007-04-17 00:44:00,3421,"A friend of mine bought a 1996 Princecraft Ungava 12 footer 9.9 Honda manual start(motor was a 2003)oars anchor, trailer ,mint condition.The guy who owned it was so careful with it he put socks on the oars when trailering the boat so the oars would not scratch the metal seats.  My Buddy got it for $3200.00 2 yrs ago.  A 14 foot Princecraft Fisherman with a 2 stroke Mercury 9.9hp sells for $6000.00 new.  MTP"
60986,majorlifts,2007-04-17 00:44:00,171,"This is where the laws of attraction come into play, If you want it to be cheaper, and you vision yourself paying less and receiving the boat in that fashion, you will have it.  It works, BELIEVE."
