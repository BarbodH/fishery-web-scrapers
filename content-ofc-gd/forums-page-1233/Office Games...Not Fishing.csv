I am out of the office all week so I will have to do it at various airports.  Should be a HOOT  Game On......  ONE-POINT DARES  1    Run one lap around the office at top speed.  2    Groan out loud in the toilet cubicle (at least one other 'non-player' must be in the toilet at the time).  3     Ignore the first five people who say 'good morning' to you.  4    Phone someone in the office you barely know, leave your name and say, ""Just called to say I can't talk right now. Bye.""  5     To signal the end of a conversation, clamp your hands over your head.  6    When someone hands you a piece of paper, finger it, and whisper huskily, ""Mmmmmmm, that feels soooooo good!""  7    Leave your zipper open for one hour. If anyone points it out, say,""Sorry, I really prefer it this way"".  8    Walk sideways to the photocopier.  9    While riding in an elevator, gasp dramatically every time the doors open.    THREE-POINTS DARES  1    Say to your boss, ""I like your style"" and shoot him with double-barreled fingers.  2    Babble incoherently at a fellow employee then ask, ""Did you get all that, I don't want to have to repeat it"".  3    Page yourself over the intercom (do not disguise your voice).  4    Kneel in front of the water cooler and drink directly from the nozzle (there must be a 'non-player' within sight).  5    Shout random numbers while someone is counting.    FIVE POINT DARES  1    At the end of a meeting, suggest that, for once, it would be nice to conclude with the singing of the national anthem (extra points if you actually launch into it yourself).  2    Walk into a very busy person's office and while they watch you with growing irritation, turn the light switch on/off 10 times.  3    For an hour, refer to everyone you speak to as ""Bob"".  4    Announce to everyone in a meeting that you ""really have to go do a number two"".  5    After every sentence, say 'mon' in a really bad Jamaican accent. As in ""the report's on your desk, mon"". Keep this up for one hour.  6    While an office mate is out, move their chair into the elevator.  7    In a meeting or crowded situation, slap your forehead repeatedly and mutter, ""Shut up, damn it, all of you just shut up!""  8     At lunchtime, get down on your knees and announce, ""As God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again.""  9    In a colleague's diary, write in 10am: ""See how I look in tights"".  10    Carry your keyboard over to your colleague and ask ""You wanna trade?""  11.    Repeat the following conversation 10 times to the same person: ""Do >you hear that?"" ""What?"" ""Never mind, it's gone now"".  12    Come to work in army fatigues and when asked why, say, ""I can't talk about it"".  13    Posing as a maitre d', call a colleague and tell him he's won a lunch for four at a local restaurant. Let him go.  14     Speak with an accent (French, German, Porky Pig, etc) during a very important conference call.  15    Find the vacuum and start vacuuming around your desk.  16    Hang a two-foot long piece of toilet roll from the back of your pants and act genuinely surprised when someone points it out.  17    Present meeting attendees with a cup of coffee and biscuit, smash each biscuit with your fist.  18    During the course of a meeting, slowly edge your chair towards the door.  19    Arrange toy figures on the table to represent each meeting attendee, move them according to the movements of their real-life counterparts."
