What's the closest location to the GTA for channel cats?  Also, this might sound like a stupid question, but how can I tell the difference between a channel cat and a bullhead?  To me, ugly is ugly..."
60622,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 15:22:00,208,"the internet is full of information, try google maybe? sorry i cant help as i dont fish for them, as u said, ugly is ugly lol"
60626,fishinggeek,2007-04-16 15:27:00,325,"Thanks for the advice!  I tried googling first but couldn't find anything close.  I found Washago (Trent River) and Dunnville (Grand River), but both are a bit too far from Toronto.  It's weird how far I'll go for good Muskie, Trout, or Walleye, but for cats, especially my first time trying, I don't want to invest too much gasoline at over a dollar a litre."
60627,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 15:31:00,208,"yea i dont blame ya at all, where abouts are ya? PM me .. i am a good researcher"

60633,nautifish,2007-04-16 15:43:00,1416,Well the site is in the states but it tells you what to look for as far as distinguishing between the diferent cats.  Like i said it really is all in the tail.  Cats are fun to fish for.
60634,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 15:45:00,208,"yea i have caught one before when i was fishing with my grandfather (rest his soul) i was about 11 years old and man, it fought me for a good 10 minutes as i was using like 8 # test on a mickey mouse pole lol .. mind u i didnt have to touch it so i have no idea how to handle the buggers..."
60638,nautifish,2007-04-16 15:54:00,1416,LOL  You would be surprised at actually how many grown men will not touch a cat fish.......lol  I am often handling and removing hooks from catfish when the derby is on here in dover.....It makes me chuckle thats for sure.
