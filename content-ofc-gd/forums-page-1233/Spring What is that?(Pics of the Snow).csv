60594,tjsa,2007-04-16 13:54:00,1578," Darn it all, how did you get so lucky to get that precipitation??????????  I know you saw my post from last saturday, and noticed the complete lack of snow in the bush in the few pictures.  2 weeks ago, we had a small squall, which left us with about 4-6 inches of snow. Its all gone now, not melted, it evaporated. Did nothing for our current low water situation, nor provide any runoff for our steelhead spawn. Our rivers up here still have ice on them, no runoff to break it up, so it all sunk to the bottom. Gonna take a bit of time for it to melt, even in plus celcious weather.  Rain would help break it up, but none of any significance in the forecast. Fish kills in the rivers, because of the ice sinking to the bottom, will be common up here. Already happening in the Geraldton area. Seen the pictures, and heard the reports already.  Darn, you are one lucky dude MTP!"
