I have got a killer jigsaw puzzle, and I can't figure out how to get it started.""  Her boyfriend asks, ""What is it supposed to be when it's finished?""  The blonde says, ""According to the picture on the box it's a tiger.""  He decides to go over and help with the puzzle.  She lets him in, and shows him where she has the puzzle spread all over the table.  He studies the pieces for a moment, then looks at the box, then turns to her and says, ""First of all, no matter what we do, we're not going to be able to assemble all of these pieces into anything resembling a tiger.""  He takes her hand and says, ""Second, I want you to relax."" Let's have a nice cup of tea, and then .... .""  He sighed ... ""Let's put all the Frosted Flakes back in the box .."""
