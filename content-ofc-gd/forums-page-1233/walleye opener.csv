61222,Northhunter,2007-04-17 17:44:00,214,"Anyone know what the division boundary is? Hwy 64 used to be the boundary between 27 and 15. On the new map on the MNR site it looks like it is now 535, but I thought I had read that they were going with all ""navigable water"" or something of that extent to include all of the west arm ???"
