60092,jdmls,2007-04-15 04:10:00,575,"Got out this morning for day break, headed out to the bottom of Cooks to a local park (if you fish crappie on simcoe you know this park !!) . One after another of some decent size perch, but few crappie were being caught. Only managed two myself. Most guys were getting the odd one but nothing to get excided over yet. Seems as if the big run has not come in yet. Should be in with the next warm spell. Here's some pictures of the park in Keswick along with a few pics of the fury of boats in Holland Landing  Choice of the day was berkley power bait mini tubes which scared of the smaller fish only hooking the better sized ones, and of course tiny pin head minnows if you really want non stop action !!  LOL at the few die hearts who tried launching the boats and heading into the bay. It only took tops half an hour before they were back in the park fishing the canal de-frosting from the cold !!       "
60110,Big Cliff,2007-04-15 10:10:00,6899,"Thanks for the report and pictures, I was wondering if there was any action over there yet but it's a long drive just to check it out."
60118,b2kptbo,2007-04-15 11:44:00,1505,Thanks for the report and pic's...
60148,Rich Clemens,2007-04-15 12:52:00,3131,"NIce report there.   Looks like opening day of trout season down here - which was yesterday.   Elbow to elbow, while others wade down the middle.   Great to be out none-the-less."
60152,Steelcat,2007-04-15 13:01:00,191,"As usual it's crowded in both location.  I went there several days ago and same thing, the biggest crappie people caught were no bigger than 6 inches.  Even with the bad weather and a weekdays, those area are always packed."
60203,Row Boat,2007-04-15 15:22:00,19,"Thanks for report and pics JD.  I guess for some, the idea of getting the gear out and casting for the first time this year outweighs putting up with the weather and lack of big fish.  yep...I can relate to these folks.  RB"
60295,lovetofish,2007-04-15 18:37:00,500,"LOL.  I was fishing there yesterday with my girlfriend and the same guy was there.  The guy with the camo tracker.  Same story, only caught a few small crappie and a couple perch.  Nice report"
60312,fish4me,2007-04-15 20:23:00,59,"Thanks for the report.  I was there on Friday and managed half a dozen crappie, but all were 5 inchers, 100 perch and 3 sunfish.  Better than nothihng, still have some time to wait for them to come in I think."
60378,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-15 23:03:00,108, 5 inchers and you kept them?  Gosh!  I turn a blind eye on anything that is less than 8 inches on crappies.  Such small ones should be released.
60383,fishindevil,2007-04-15 23:16:00,6254,"Thanks for sharing,your report & pics, and man thats sure busy there...to many people for me well at least you got out for a few hours and did catch a few better than nothing i guess....cheers"
60397,Rizzo,2007-04-15 23:36:00,4754," I must've missed something, didn't see where anyone said they kept these 5 inchers."
60455,frozen-fire,2007-04-16 01:11:00,542,"i don't know, but maybe it's just me. last year, i tried the small canals for the first time, and only manage a few each outing, small...like what was said above, 5-6 inches. I throw them back. do the big ones ever come in? i will be trying it out tomorrow morning."
60471,fishboy,2007-04-16 01:39:00,550,yikes-holy crowd; not sure that's my flavour of fishing...
60488,fish4me,2007-04-16 02:34:00,59,small fish are great for soup .  Obvious the larger ones for filletting.
60489,fish4me,2007-04-16 02:37:00,59,"Aparently that area will be closed in 2009, too much garbage left behind by anglers, another area ruined by bad apples.  And no I did not keep all of them just 3 of them and 1 perch."
60494,frozen-fire,2007-04-16 02:51:00,542,so is this the false spawn or what?  aren't they supposed to be more dense than this?
60497,fish4me,2007-04-16 02:56:00,59,"I would say this is the false spawn, but the dam cold weather is creating havoc.  Lots of fish in transition which is why I think the size has been less than spectacular."
60502,Steelcat,2007-04-16 03:05:00,191,Closed in 2009?! God can people keep their trash to themselves?!  Very soon there will be no shore fishing spot at all anywhere within 3 hrs of Toronto if people keep leaving their trash.
60506,frozen-fire,2007-04-16 03:20:00,542,"it's pathetic ebcuase in that spot, there are so many garbage cans... why can't people just take a couple steps to throw the trash in a can, rather then dumping it on the ground or into the water?"
60507,fish4me,2007-04-16 03:24:00,59,"The spot just north of there was closed down for the same reason.  If you just walk around, you see line, plastics etc.. thrown around and no one seems to take their garbage since so many don't care unfortunately."
60583,cityfisher,2007-04-16 13:06:00,959,i drove by on saturday and it was a mess... cops and parking guys out in full force along with tones of people keeping 3-5 inch perch ???? WHY !
60592,Terry,2007-04-16 13:38:00,14456,another areas closed..man that sucks years and years and years ago I use to camp right there in the summers..
