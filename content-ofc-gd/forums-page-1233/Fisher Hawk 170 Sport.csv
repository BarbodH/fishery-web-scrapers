60377,leighfns,2007-04-15 23:03:00,103,I was looking at boats the other day and ran into this one...  http://www.fisherboats.com/boat/index.cfm?...y&boat=2070  It looked really nice and was a decent price with a 90hp Optimax.  I have never heard of Fisher Boats before but really liked the look and options.  Are these boats any good?
60380,leighfns,2007-04-15 23:06:00,103,Oh I was also wondering if I should go with the Optimax or a 4 Stroke Merc...
60382,Roy,2007-04-15 23:13:00,13728,Welcome aboard. Get the largest motor you can find. They look better too!
60388,leighfns,2007-04-15 23:23:00,103,I've actually been here for a while just haven't posted much since the new board opened....  You may know me as johnnynofish
60389,taper,2007-04-15 23:24:00,611,"I agree with Roy, go as big as you can afford. It helps for resale even if your not a power nut. If you do a lot of trolling and are not putting a kicker on then go 4 stroke. Some gys like the Opti because it is lighter. Personally I would go 115 hp 4 stroke on that boat."
60391,Rizzo,2007-04-15 23:28:00,4754,"looks great!   For a boat that size though, pretty small casting platform up front.  That would cause problems for a guy like me who likes to have 9 rods around my feet and at least 10 big baits scattered around!  Not to mention fishing with a buddy who wants to be up there too!  When I bought my boat the size of the casting platform was #1 priority.  I've only got a 14' boat but the platform must be 2-3 times the size of the one on that 17' boat.  Basically, it comes down to priorites.  If casting room at the bow is not a big deal, then it looks like you've found a nice boat!"
60419,silveradosheriff,2007-04-16 00:15:00,1025,"Not sure what the price is, but I would compare the equaivalent models from Lund, Princecraft, Crestliner and Alumacraft. If the deal seems too good to be true.......  My $0.02"
60424,Pigeontroller,2007-04-16 00:22:00,2793,Looks to be a nice boat! I'd go with a 115 4-Stroke or 150 if it'll take it.
60493,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-16 02:49:00,4399,I would agree with Dax nice boat but the 90 is probably too small that`s a heavy boat the 115 would be better and the 150 would be perfect especially if your planning on water sking/tubing with the fam on board. When I bought mine last year it came with a 60 but I upgraded to the max. HP 90 and I am glad I did.
60501,NANUK,2007-04-16 03:03:00,797,"Fisher is just another name for Tracker boats, a little different cosmetics and colour scheme but the hulls are the same, compare the prices or features with Trackers sold at BPS and other local dealers and you'll have a better idea."
60586,specktacklure,2007-04-16 13:18:00,56,"I would go 4 stroke before optimax. And a good rule of thumb with motors is to never go less than 75% of the max horsepower rating.I agree about maxing out the horsepower because you don't want your motor pushing and working any harder than it has to.People always forget that a marine motor is constantly pushing not like a car motor.Another option is the Evinrude Etec.Much lighter than a four stroke ,more fuel efficient,more torque, 2008 emission tested in California and Europe....just the best motor on the market !!! Just my two cents"
60716,bassassin,2007-04-16 17:53:00,152,"Believe that is a heck of a boat!  I have a fisher hawk 170 sport 06' model and i couldnt be happier.  We take it downrigging in pretty intimidating waters without worries, its just as comfortable on smaller lakes.  We have a 90 opti on it and im about to purches a ss prop as well. With 3 people in the boat all our gear and downriggers we manage 37mph.im sure ill break the 40 mph mark with the new prop, and im pretty satisfied with the performance, I dont think there is a quicker  wholeshot motor on the market.  The boat is over 8 feet wide to boot.  You should be really satisfied with the purchase, plus there is a lifetime warranty on the welds and floor!!!!  Jason"
