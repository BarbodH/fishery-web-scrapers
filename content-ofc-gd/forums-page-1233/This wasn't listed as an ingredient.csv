A few spoonfuls in i choke and hack this up.    Looks like a chicken type bone in a veg soup,(which has beef broth) listed. Over a half inch long and wide. Anyways my child coulda swallowed and choked on this so i'm peeved.  Saved the can and item but not sure how to proceed from there. Thought maybe someone here has had same experience or some advice.  Thanks  ehg"

60718,nautifish,2007-04-16 17:57:00,1416,"I'm Guessing this was store brought?   I would go back to the place you brought the soup from explain to the manager what has happened. Make sure you takle pics of not only the bone but also the can,container it came in and contact the company through either via email or post.  They will want dates,times,pictures where you brought it ect ect...........The manager of the store where you brought it from should be able to put you in the right direction as who to contact with in the company of the brand. I have over twenty yrs expereince in the retail industry. Some companys you deal with in these situations are good then their are those that are not so good. So make sure you are thorough.  Hope that helps......& glad too hear your son is okay.  Nauti"

60738,Roy,2007-04-16 18:14:00,13728,Glad the boy didn't get it. That is not a chicken bone.
60747,Terry,2007-04-16 18:24:00,14456,"oh that's part of a rats rib cage       just kidding, call the company that made it and get to the bottom of it"
60748,Andy,2007-04-16 18:24:00,330,"Likely a dried piece of stem from a vegetable plant, possibly green bean. Andy"
60754,ehg,2007-04-16 18:33:00,2666,"Andy your right could be a piece of stem, but it is rigid making me think it was bone. Just glad my daughter didn't have to deal with it.  I'll make sure i do this correctly before i make an issue with manufacturer. Thanks for advice thus far.  ehg"
