60434,PatrickGG,2007-04-16 00:41:00,562,"Sup everyone! i got a issue which maybe some of your ideas would help me out, over  the years i managed to buy a few opened face reels which came with a additional spool and now  looking at some of my spools i am tring to figure out what line i spooled on them, i notice some  people label there spools and i just don't like the thought of sticking labels on my spools so  whats sort of system do you guys use??"
60465,fliptheslop,2007-04-16 01:29:00,112,"I use the white cloth hockey tape, easy to write on, stays on when it gets wet and very easy to take off when you want, I just put a little picec on the spool where nothing else is writin, works great and never gets in the way"
60469,Daplumma,2007-04-16 01:35:00,1961,Tape or a p-touch or just write it on the spool with a sharpie.Just remember to write the date and type of line on the spool.Good question. Joe
60560,ccmtcanada,2007-04-16 11:35:00,7971,I have two spools...LOL.  The one with thick line is for Walleye and Pike....the one with thinner line is for Steelhead.  Pretty scientific eh??? haha.

60704,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-16 17:30:00,108,I use a spreadsheet and different coloured lines.
60705,fishdawg,2007-04-16 17:31:00,912,"I used to keep a list on my wall  - had each reel on the list & beside each,  read what kind of line, how much of it was on the spool, & the date it was spooled - pretty simple"
60714,Headhunter,2007-04-16 17:51:00,5703,"I post all my spool's line weight and capacity on my own private web site, which I can access through my ""Crackberry"" virtually anywhere in southern Ontario. When I need to change up, I consult the all knowing ""crack"" and pick accordingly from my selection within my dedicated spool box! Ok, now really, I don't have a system. If I'm not sure, I just re-spool! HH"
60787,PatrickGG,2007-04-16 19:14:00,562,  Funny! i thought at one point you was gonna mention bringing a lap top with you when you go fishing just to make sure you are going in the right direction.
60872,Victor,2007-04-16 21:30:00,1609,"if you're having a hard time trying to remember what line's on the spool, that means you have way too many spools/reels ... to solve that problem, send it over to my house and i'll remember them for you... PM me for my address  for spinning reels maybe you can stick a label on the inside of the spool (if the appearance is what makes you reject the idea of sticking labels)"
