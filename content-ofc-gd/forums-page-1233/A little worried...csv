I'm have a canoe trip to Algonquin May 2nd, and the lakes are still frozen right now. although they are not safe to walk on, and are melting fairly quickly....and the 23 degree weather forecast for next week should get them open.  Your up quite a bit futher north  but I'd imagine you'll be ok by then? I'll cross my my fingers for you"
