Has anyone here fished the reefs in Bermuda? If so, any tips on what species to go for and/or what techniques worked well? Obviously the boat ""captain"" will help with all of that but I was hoping to get some advice from all of the knowledgeable OFNers out there.  Thanks in advance and i'll be sure to post all the pics when i get back!"

60767,Headhunter,2007-04-16 18:44:00,5703,"I'd stay away from the reef fishin and book a deep sea excursion. My experience in the Carribean ""reef"" fishin was a small boat, out a few hundred yards from shore, lousy equipment and dinky little reef fish. If your down there, spend a few extra bucks and get out onto the big water for REAL fish! HH"
