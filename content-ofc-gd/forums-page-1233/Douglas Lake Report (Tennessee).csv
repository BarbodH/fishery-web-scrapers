60831,Guest mistyriver1,2007-04-16 20:04:00,0,"Greetings folks.  With this cold weather, thought it would be good to post a softwater report.  The family and I went down to Tennessee for the past 10 days.  Corey (mistyjr) and I rented a boat and fished for a couple of hours on Douglas Lake which was about half an hour from where we were staying in Seveirville, TN.  The weather was probably in the mid to high 60's and it was a slight overcast to clear day.  No wind whatsoever.  The finder on the boat didn't work the greatest but we were at least able to see depth.  It was sure nice to get out and the scenery, well, the pictures can do the talking.  Corey had a couple of hits on some of the new crappie gear he had bought and I landed my first ever Tennessee Bass.            Back you go Buddy... "

60849,Joey,2007-04-16 20:37:00,9122,Welcome home Jim.  Great report.  Is that a big beach or sandbar in the background of those pictures?  Sure looks nice.  Joey

60910,Lostchild,2007-04-16 22:46:00,153,"Very nicely done. That rental looked like it was a pretty nice ride, no little 9.9 on the back. The water levels look like they are way down, is the lake on a dam system?"
60931,GbayGiant,2007-04-16 23:10:00,1780,"Nice fish, I like the light coloration of them Tennessee hogs, that beach looks nice to."
