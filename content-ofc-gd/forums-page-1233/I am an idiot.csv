60678,huey graphite,2007-04-16 16:34:00,362,"I just learned over email that my 14' Lund curently stored in my brother's backyard was 3/4 full of water now that everything has melted. Sure enough, I forgot to take the drain plug out last fall. This is the first year I couldn't store it indoors. I am afraid to go look at it. Any ideas what to expect?  Remember, it takes a brave man to admit his mistakes...or is should that read ""foolish""."
60679,BITEME,2007-04-16 16:35:00,1969,Couple of ducks!@!!!
60680,Terry,2007-04-16 16:37:00,14456,"funny you should say that as I was making plans to pick up my boat this coming weekend, I just can't remember removing the plug when I stored it...  I am sure my trailer would be bent and the tires flat if I did forget oh well I will know next Saturday, one way or the other"
60682,easton13th,2007-04-16 16:39:00,371,"YUCK! Let it dry! Then you will know...The tires are a concern now...If they are older I would replace them, that's a lot of weight. Plus the wood is probably swelled pretty good...Time will tell how much damage there is...  Sorry to hear...."
60683,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 16:40:00,208,"well it all started when a seagull picked up that goby someone left out in the sun to bake, but the gull didnt feel like goby, so it flew over your boat with another seagull which had a goby in its mouth, but they dropped em both off... and now there is a goby farm in your boat!!!!! lo...l. j/k  hopefully with any luck, your boat is just full of water and the damage is minimal... Bud"
60690,pikehunter,2007-04-16 16:54:00,1659," I guess you now have one huge live well. Guess the worst that may have happened though is expansion from ice freezing during the winter inside the boat. If you have any new leaks this year you can figure out why, but I hope all is OK."
60703,misfish,2007-04-16 17:29:00,29133," I know I took mine out. I,ll be picking mine up aswell this weekend bud. Got to do the bearings and check the wiring and get the seats redone and and and and  Hey Huey,I wouldnt worry to much about it,I would try and get to the plug though,Maybe put the plug on the outside of the hull.Easier to get to. Also carry a spare if you do this.LOL"
60708,Hookset,2007-04-16 17:39:00,367,"You're not an idiot. Now if it happens twice....you're an idiot. If it only happens once it falls under the term ""education"". Yes, I too am well educated."
60760,Fisherman,2007-04-16 18:39:00,7201,"Not so hasty, this may be the perfect time to do some spring cleaning, add a box of  cold water Tide and take her for a ride up and down a bumpy road, see how much foam you can make."
60766,misfish,2007-04-16 18:43:00,29133,  
60777,TEP,2007-04-16 18:59:00,68,Do you have batteries in it? If so they'll likely be garbage if the water got to the top. And the paint will be lifted on the hull and the carpet will be toast. Happened to a buddy of mine 4 years ago. Messy!
60814,irishfield,2007-04-16 19:43:00,26272,The GOOD news is...it's full of water = you didn't crack the hull when it was ICE !
60868,Big Cliff,2007-04-16 21:17:00,6899,"Fisherman:   Always making the best of a bad situation! Got any insights for a badly bent marine railway? LOL  irishfield:   No there is the true mark of a man with a very high mechanical aptitude! Water didn't leak out = hull must be sound!  Huey: your mission for next year (should you decide to accept it) is to warn everyone that is storing their boat outside to ""remove the PLUG""  Hope everything works out OK for you and there isn't too much damage."
60888,Tybo,2007-04-16 21:58:00,1373,   VERY WISE...! GRASSHOPPER!
60897,Tybo,2007-04-16 22:09:00,1373,"Ice freezes from the top. In a boat with bench seats or a floor, It would jam the ice and create the path of lease resistance downward"
60920,lew,2007-04-16 23:03:00,12767,"A friend used to pull his 16' aluminum outta the water every fall, unhook the trailer from the truck, drop the tongue to the ground and walk away till May.  He never covered it with anything and the  boat would fill with water in the fall, then freeze solid and be covered in snow all winter, and in the spring, he'd syphon the water out, stick it back in the lake and fish for another season.  The boat never leaked a drop of water all the time I knew him.  You may be OK"
60930,Fisherman,2007-04-16 23:09:00,7201,"This one took a couple of minutes...Badly bent marine railway... You could advertise free launching for very large boats and then claim the first one bent it all to spagetti, make him pay for a new one... Honestly, hope it's not beyond the point of repair.  Maybe snatch a couple of rails from some backwoods CN line, they're on strike and will never kow, I sure as poop won't tell."
60938,Big Cliff,2007-04-16 23:25:00,6899,  Just too Funny!
60949,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-16 23:35:00,4399,Are you an idiot! Not at all I think most have done some thing stupid with our boats for example last year out on Simcoe when we finished our fishing for the day stowed all the gear put the life jackets on hit the throttle and lets go 2 seconds latter I say to myself why is the boat not getting on plane it took a good 15 seconds before i realized that i forgot to bring up the anchor. Dumb eh!
60955,pikehunter,2007-04-16 23:45:00,1659," That's true Wayne, I wasn't thinking clearly I guess. Either that or my brain is waterlogged!  I wouldn't say you were an idiot for leaving the plug in all winter. Now if you forget to put it in when you launch it for the first time after all of this, well, I have no comment."
60987,Greencoachdog,2007-04-17 00:45:00,8163,If you have a livewell aereator and/or bilge pump they're prolly @#$%ed up... plywood deck and carpet??? Prolly time to redeck and carpet.
60991,solopaddler,2007-04-17 00:58:00,8605,"I was busy and had to get my dad to close my water access cabin in N/W Quebec 2 falls ago. He left all the deep cycle batteries at the camp. I run 3 of them off a solar panel with a charge controller. He left the vent fan for the composting toilet running hooked up to one He left all my low voltage electric lights on hooked up to another He forgot to drain the water tank and bleed all the lines He left the gas powered jet pump in its little ""doghouse"" down on the dock He left my brand new Honda generator in the shed He didn't secure my floating dock properly for the harsh winter The boat? Yeah he forgot to put the cover on the boat, jack it up and pull the drain plug That was the least of my worries!  Can't help but love the old bugger"
61000,T Fisher,2007-04-17 01:21:00,139,"Your lucky its a LUND, a quality product, none better in my opinion it sure is worth the extra money."
61010,Rizzo,2007-04-17 01:57:00,4754,"mine has been indoors at my sister's farm,  so I'm not too worried about water.  Its the 3 racoons and 11 possums having a jamboree in there I'm worried about"
