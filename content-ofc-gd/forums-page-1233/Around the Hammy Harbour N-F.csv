59767,pikehunter,2007-04-14 01:23:00,1659,Took a little drive around today to see if there were any signs of the soon to come fishing and boating season and took a few pictures.  Putting up the seasonal breakwall at LaSalle Park Burlington   Docks waiting to be put in   Swans near the LaSalle ramp   The swans thought I was going to feed them and came swimming over   Hamilton Pier 4 ramp   A view looking back across the bay to LaSalle Park and LaSalle Towers Apartments through the centre of one of the many steels coil stored near Pier 4.   Some of the members from Toronto may recognize this ship?   And here is the starboard side of the Haida   If I'm lucky my next picture post just might be of some fish!
