60807,bucktail,2007-04-16 19:38:00,1857,I know it sucks outside but I did see a true sign of spring today. Hunkered down outside my window in oakville was a flock of about 100 swallows! They didnt look to impressed. If they can hang into friday and some warmer temps they should be ok. Not alot of calories in snow flakes.
60815,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-16 19:43:00,181,It should be about spring weather at the end of this week!
