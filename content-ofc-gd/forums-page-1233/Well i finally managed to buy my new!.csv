60615,nautifish,2007-04-16 15:12:00,1416,Well as some of you may remember i asked about cameras. and i just want to say thankyou so much to all those that took the time to reply and give advice very much appreciated sincerly.  Well i have yet to buy my SLR i really am having a hard time in decideing witht this camera. Because they are such big money i really want to make sure i get the right one for me.  But anyway i did pick up a new camera for my every day shots and video's. I am happy as larry with it. It is a Canon powershot S3IS that i picked up last week.  Now i am still getting familiar with it and playing around with it but having fun with it also. but so far i am very happy with it.  These are just a few pictures i have shot of birds in my yard and a few down by the lake here in port dover over the past weekend.                   
60617,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 15:15:00,208,"well, atleast you know it takes a really clear picture.... lady dover.. seen that a few times"
60624,easton13th,2007-04-16 15:25:00,371,Great looking shots! Canon never fails to deliver. Keep shooting!
60625,nautifish,2007-04-16 15:26:00,1416,  They are still a little grainy bud but i think thats me not the camera. There are so many different functions and settings so like i said still playing and learning with it....& yes it was actually really nice too see her out on the water yesterday. You know summer is just around the corner.
60650,tjsa,2007-04-16 16:05:00,1578,"An SLR, or an SLR digital, I am assuming the latter, lol. Huge difference in price, I can't get more than 50 bucks for my Canon AE-1."
60662,nautifish,2007-04-16 16:17:00,1416,No i am looking at the digital SLR  Tjsa. I know there is a huge difference in price. I was out again last week shopping around. Could not beleive the huge difference in price between a digital SLR & A film SLR.  sadley the digital SLR do not have the option of  movie footage yet.  I am hoping sometime down the road soon they will also have that option with the digital SLR.
60663,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 16:19:00,208,"yepper, and bass season closing in.. can hardly wait !! also will be making an appearance at the perch derby"
60665,nautifish,2007-04-16 16:20:00,1416,Well i will probably see you down there bud. This is my fifth yr doing the derby now & i love it its alot of fun.
60670,Deano,2007-04-16 16:25:00,767, Here's a pic my son got with my Sony camera DSC-H2. I took over 2000 pics in BC. My camera stopped working. Sent it out and was fixed under warranty by Sony. Hopefully I get a much longer life out of it now. Great pics with the Canon.
60672,Heybud_e,2007-04-16 16:28:00,208,"Sony is good about their customer service, i have a sony handycam and for some reason it stopped working, they sent me a new one to my place of work (we deliver sony products to the sony store in niagara falls) no shipping or handling fees.. just a quick exchange.. i have no probs with this one.... Bud"
60687,nautifish,2007-04-16 16:46:00,1416,Beautiful shot deano.........  Now if i could just figure out the right settings on my cam for them very same shots.....lol
60791,JFR,2007-04-16 19:18:00,498,"Very nice camera, takes exceptions photos.  Good luck  John"
60865,GbayGiant,2007-04-16 21:09:00,1780,"I would say it's a great camera, very nice clear shots."
60889,nautifish,2007-04-16 21:58:00,1416,Thanx GBG  I am hopeing as i get to know the camera more though that the pictures will get even better.
60894,bigbuck,2007-04-16 22:07:00,2449,"Enjoy the new toy!!! Canon makes a fantastic product. My old EOS 650 that's 20 years old still looks like new and more importantly, still takes awesome pictures. I loved our old little Canon digital but alas, after dropping it twice in the boat and then getting it wet, my wife killed it. Now we have a Sony but I liked the Canon more. Practice makes perfect in photography, keep at it."
60911,nautifish,2007-04-16 22:48:00,1416, Thanx alot guys....the camera is 12 x  opitical Zoom so i am going to be buying the extra lense that will give me 24 x optical zoom. They did not carry it it in the store so i have to order it on line.Go figure.
60914,bigfish1965,2007-04-16 22:53:00,3382,"Using a long zoom in low light gives you the grain, nauti.... at least thats my experience. On sunny days it ain't a problem. Happy as larry, huh? Crazy Dover sayings...."
60921,nautifish,2007-04-16 23:03:00,1416,  LOL actually not been using the lense yet rick......I think its more the setting i have set on it than anything else......Like isaid the blooming book is like the same thickness of an english dictionary.....lol  As for happy as larry!!!
