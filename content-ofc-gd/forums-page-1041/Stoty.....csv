194307,Mike the Pike,2008-04-30 12:17:00,3421,"GO HABS GO.A new canadian poll said Canadiens chose the Montreal Canadians as their favorite hockey team with 40% of the vote ,leafs had 24% of the vote.  Its been a while since we have seen the CUP in canada.Its time to bring it home."
194309,SlowPoke,2008-04-30 12:22:00,2984,"You can visit the cup anytime you like, it's in Toronto."
194310,Mike the Pike,2008-04-30 12:26:00,3421, Being born after 1967 Brian this is the only way you will ever see it .  I have seen it there and I saw it here in Montreal during the Stanley cup Parade not the stupid riot.
194325,Stoty,2008-04-30 12:57:00,2910,"I KNOW!!! I am hoping that Colorado wins tomorrow night!! Mind you, I hope its a high scoring game like 7-6 with the Avalanche coming out on top! I have COL and DET players in my playoff pools!  I dont think whoever was laughing at me for being in 33rd place in the OFC Playoff Pool is laughing anymore though. Sitting at #7. Not a bad turn around 33rd to 7th.  GO WINGS GO (after tomorrow night!)  Either way though, I am going to a game. If I cant go this weekend, I am getting tickets for the Conference Finals (hopefully)"
194365,bullybass,2008-04-30 14:57:00,144,Yes very nice Stoty.... I beat you though... I went from 42nd to 4th as of last night... WOO HOO!!!!  I do hope that Colorado wins for you though so you can enjoy the game Saturday!!!
194377,Stoty,2008-04-30 15:18:00,2910,"Wow, thats a pretty decent jump too! Now, lets hope that you and I can jump to #1 & #2! lol  Thanks, I am really pumped to see my 1st playoff game!"
194381,Marty,2008-04-30 15:33:00,873,"Stoty, I'll have a couple tix for you here in Pittsburgh in a couple weeks."
194383,Stoty,2008-04-30 15:37:00,2910,That is true!  How much?
