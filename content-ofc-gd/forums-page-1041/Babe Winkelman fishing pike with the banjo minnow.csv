193927,Maverick,2008-04-29 19:54:00,371,I am watching WFN and Babe Winkelman fishing pike up in the NWT with a banjo minnow and it was actually producing. Think I might dust off my set I picked up at a flea market down in Florida for $5 about 8 years ago and use them this season. Anybody ever use the banjo minnow?
193933,DANIMAL,2008-04-29 20:03:00,215,I've used them before and they're a decent soft plastic stickbait. They just get a bad rap because they're not the magical bait that they are made out to be in the infomercial.
193934,Stoty,2008-04-29 20:03:00,2910,I used them. Seemed to work for me.  Just not as well as the guys who were fishing in controlled environments on the infomercial! hahaah
193961,lew,2008-04-29 20:46:00,12767,"Was that the episode where Babe was fishing with Spence Petros ??  If so, the underwater footage of the big pike hitting the baits was unbelievable !! Really gives an  excellent perspective of how the pike attacks another fish."
193970,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-29 20:51:00,4399,I think Joe Whats his name could catch fish up there with just about any stupid infomercial bait ever made.  I wonder why he was using a Banjo minnow $$$$$ perhaps!
194052,fishdawg,2008-04-29 22:48:00,912,"a) Babe Winkleman - one of the good' ol boys - allways loved his shows & videos - no one can touch his hair, huge coffee mug & giant sunglasses!  Banjo minnow DOES catch fish - allmost as fun as a Senko to fish with"
194059,Maverick,2008-04-29 22:51:00,371," Yeah, the underwater footage was insane. I've fished pike in the NWT and it's exactly like that, one after the other of massive pike."
194060,joefish,2008-04-29 22:51:00,165,My name is Joe and I use the Banjo Minnow!!  Oh nuts!!  Wrong meeting!!!!!!!  I've used that a few times myself and caught a few fish....
194070,addict,2008-04-29 23:03:00,475,had a couple of them in my box last season started tossing them through the pads and the largies were smokin em.wouldnt spend my cash on them though plenty of better baits out there.
194206,GbayGiant,2008-04-30 01:27:00,1780,"I just watched that show today as well, nice big pike and underwater footage for sure. The banjo was working just fine but I have a feeling anything would have worked in that bay full of huge hungry aggressive pike, I'd take a live sucker/smelt or the big gulp baits any day over a banjo though, but spot fishing like that with fish everywhere in perfect sight makes things a lot easier too, a simple quarter ounce jig and 3"" plastic grub probably would have done the same job in that situation, so it made the banjo out to be a super bait but in reality anything would have worked."
194266,jediangler,2008-04-30 05:11:00,1923,"My brother, Joonmoon, caught a musky and a carp on a Banjo Minnow in the Pigeon river about 10 yrs ago. The carp gave him a better fight and destroyed the bait, big time."
194319,Billy Bob,2008-04-30 12:38:00,5865,I can personally attest to not believing everything you see on the Babe Winkleman's show.  Take some things with a grain of salt.
194330,Wes Bender,2008-04-30 13:21:00,105,I have used the Banjo minnow at the edge of weed lines for walleye. We hammered them. Not sure if it was the bait or the lake but every fish was close to or over 2 lbs. We must have caught over 20 in a couple hours.
194395,corvette1,2008-04-30 16:04:00,1765,my 16lbs walleye was caught on the banjo with 19 others in 70ft at quinte they work
