194581,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-04-30 21:11:00,0," I have to agree! And to think that some of these people try to justify this thievery is really sad!  What burns me up the most is when these wealthy people tell the rest of the world to stop complaining, meanwhile when the wealthy lose even a few cents they are the biggest cry babies!  And what does the amount the oil companies invest have to do with anything? They have been investing the same amount, if not less over the last few decades. When was the last refinery built?  If anything , what they have increased the most is PAY for CEO's! They have been walking away with 100's of millions of dollars in bonuses! And what they have increased is the price and thus profits. Thanks to OPEC's monopoly on oil. I bet Venenzuela could afford to ship oil to us at a quarter of that cost, but you wont hear them complaining anytime soon with the profits they are making.  And what was all that about borrowing from China and transfering wealth to Saudi Arabia? That article was almost laughable. What does China buying American debt have to do with the oil? It actually is the reason the American dollar has been sustained. China stops buying American debt, and the dollar starts to fall. And transfering wealth to Saudi Arabia? How is that?When Saudi Arabia invest mosts of its profits in the USA?  If Anything, North America's wealth is being transfered to Asia, not Saudi Arabia.  This is plain price gauging, thanks to capitalism. Now that they own almost everything?The ultra rich got us by the b**ls and now they are squeezing them. Thats what you get when corporations that are not accountable to anyone, have control of the nations wealth."

193822,holdfast,2008-04-29 12:51:00,1813," Record oil prices drive Shell 1Q profits up 25 percent By TOBY STERLING, AP Business Writer 44 minutes ago    AMSTERDAM, Netherlands - Royal Dutch Shell PLC reported a 25 percent rise in first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, crediting strong increases in oil prices.    Europe's largest oil company said its average selling price of crude oil leaped by 66 percent to more than $90 per barrel from the first quarter a year ago.  That sent net profit soaring to a record $9.08 billion, up from $7.28 billion. Sales rose 55 percent to $114 billion.  Analysts said the performance was impressive, especially because expectations were already high.  Shell ""delivered a very robust overall performance, with all the divisions outperforming the consensus and our estimates,"" wrote analyst Alexandre Weinberg of Petercam in a note on the earnings."

191698,jjcanoe,2008-04-24 09:06:00,744,1.60 euros/litre = $2.48/litre in Can$ here in Holland.

Thats why everyone takes the train/bus/bike or walks everywhere.  jjcanoe with a wooden shoe
191710,OhioFisherman,2008-04-24 10:54:00,6623,"LOL Wayne that might work up there, wild west here in the states, people punching holes in gas tanks on cars and trucks and draining fuel into buckets, story on the news the other day. Friend had his bulldozer parked in a field, someone pumped the diesel out of it. Seventy five bucks got me 10 gallons of gas in the van and 10 gallons for the lawn equipment. The 10 gallons in the van might last 2 months.  Gerritt your right, but economic news is not good here. News report yesterday? General Electric`s financial division chief says the economy is in the worst shape here since the great depression. Hmmm? People need jobs to buy? Just guns to steal? Right now more guns than jobs!"
191715,topraider,2008-04-24 11:07:00,30,"In this week's Fortune magazine there's an article about a new 6 billion dollar refinery being built in India that will be capable of producing 5% of the world's gasoline. 40% of the production will be shipped to the United States. As the North American gasoline market is integrated, it's good news for Canada too. Right now, refiners in North America aren't making money (all the money is being made in exploration and production), this additional supply can't be good news for the refiners, but it is good news for consumers.  There is no getting around the cost of a barrel of oil though, and the fuel taxes governments levy on top of that. Biofuels are not the answer, unless you are happy to see people around the world go hungry because food is being turned into ethanol.  Most of the world's oil is controlled by governments, not the big oil companies. Governments expropriate, and then run the resource down by not investing the profits back into the business."
