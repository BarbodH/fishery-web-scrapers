There are always lots of marshmallow-eating trout at beaver dams. They even take a chunk of wiener.  Hey if I float a wiener at the end of my rig will I also catch salmon? At the beaver dam?  Or, no. Egads. I'm confused now. I think I'll go spruce up my gear.... my fishing stuff, you know.  p.-"

194492,Puckhead,2008-04-30 19:16:00,377,Here's how you rig a marsh mellow!  lol  
194497,Paulus,2008-04-30 19:21:00,522," I haven't met Aniceguy yet, but I know about his good work (and have sampled some of it, thanks!) with the CRAA. As Solopaddler hinted, the above is where this whole thing went wrong, then actually very ridiculous and finally ridiculously funny.  Yes, they go for marshmallows, yes they will rise for something that you drop on the surface of a pool or pond, and all of that is true. But Aniceguy is 100% right when he calls the ""marshmallow rig,"" ""lining."" I've perfected the technique, so I should know.  Basically, if you fish for salmon in slack water, off a pier, in an estuary (river mouth) - i.e. anywhere that there is not enough current to push your bait around - you are probably lining most of your fish:  1) rod-------------------sinker----------------------------marshmallow 2) rod-------------------marshmallow--------------------sinker  This is not to say that you're immoral or a bad person who also steals cans of Red Bull from Mac's Milk, or let ""one"" rip and blame it on a 2 year old (which actually I've been accused of doing.... I'M INNOCENT!!!! INNOCENT, I SAY!... sister in law thinks she's Matlock) You probably think that they're biting. And maybe the odd one is, but most are not. You don't normally catch any other species when doing this do you? 99% are salmon, yes?  In the above equation, when you are out in late September getting salmon at Bronte or Credit, or whatever pier or estuary you are getting them from, try the following baits: cigarette butt; worm ; gummy bear; piece of cloth; cut-out picture of Dalton McGinty from the newspaper etc... ad nauseum. I guarantee you that if the marshmallows were working, then all of these other things will work too.  Oddly enough, I don't really have a problem with this technique myself when it concerns Chinook Salmon. They are so heavily stocked in the Great Lakes, and most of them are put-and-take (not all, I know). If people are catching steelhead this way, that's a different kettle of fish. Most Ontario tribs have 100% wild populations of Steelhead, and catching them this way IMO isn't fair to them.  I only mention all of this because I am a total, utter, elitist Steelheader snob. In fact, I pick my nose at you and &*^% in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.  Now if you'll excuse me, I will be having my tea, along with caviar, melba toast, pâté de foie gras and a discreet dab of grey poupon.  ""GREY POUPON!""  ""FETCHEZ LA VACHE!"" p.-"

194470,CLofchik,2008-04-30 18:26:00,854,"Lol damn, it's not even salmon season and already we're on a lining rant post!  Yes, using a marshmallow off bottom at a rivermouth or in a pool for salmon or trout you are lining fish.  No, the majority of fish are not ""striking"" your bait but being unintentionally hooked.  Swap your marshmallow out for anything else that floats and you'll hook into the same #'s of fish, probably more because an ear plug doesn't melt and floats higher.  Yes, lining is the same as snagging ethically, but in the eyes of the law if you snag them in the mouth area it is perfectly legal.  Although relying on lining you will snag some fish in non-legal areas, especially true if you are fishing pools and not rivermouths.  That's it, there's no denying those points.  You can switch up the presentation and catch the odd steel on a marshmallow under a float if you wanted (while occasionally stubborn they're not exactly bright), but there's more productive baits to use.   GreenCoachDog-  Your ""po-boy vs. The Man"" argument isn't going to fly.  This isn't the dew worm vs. perfectly tied hackle, it's about stream trash who plunks down in the middle of a pool and starts foul hooking everything in sight, screwing up the fishing for everybody that knows what they're doing."
194479,Guest gbfisher,2008-04-30 18:35:00,0, A fish that strikes with their mouth. What a concept.
194341,capt bruce,2008-04-30 13:58:00,820,"Johny bass and everyone else all bent out of shape read High drifters post I think he said it well . I remember the first years the browns came into bluffers in the fall I would sit all day at the launch and line browns never thinking anything of it as ""wrong "" would throw my line out with a 1 ounce weight and a mallow drop shot riged half way up , with a long cast I could run my line amost right across the pool, big kipped males would be lined easy , I would catch them let them go catch another again and again , because I was hooking them in the mouth no big deal . I had never heard of lining (I thought I was inventing a new way to hook fish ). THIS IS MUCH DIFFERENT than properly drifting a bait ,roe ,mallow or roe imation to a feeding fish. BECAUSE OF THE ease of ABUSE I think its not a way for the new to the sport to fish , MUCH BETTER TO TEACH new comers how to properly present a bait (mallow or otherwise)and than lineing would not become the issue it is . I agree LOTS OF GUYS fish mallows without lineing , the use the rigged properly presented properly but lots of guys line fish without KNOWING they are doing it because they just have not learned how to present a bait to a fish in a stream and just throw out a weighted floating line .I bought a big boat so I can go out into 350-400 feet of water and catch 50 or 60 bows a day every day (most days )all summer long and never see another fisher person for miles so I dont have to stream fish anymore lol I have taken out 8 people charters with all geting their 5 fish in a few hours when things are right 7 days a week , so much more fun to give this fish their due and fight them on long rods with light line in OPEN WATER (lol that will piss off the stream guys, I didnt mean anything just I dont like lots of people and trees and such getting in my way) ). I hope I got across what I wanted to say , I am not commenting to stir things up or to say anybody is WRONG , the more you learn the better fisher person you will become theres so much more FUN in fishing than just throwing out a line and hopeing something bites so instead of useing mallows and hopeing ,take the time to study baits and how to present them , tight lines ."

194347,blaque,2008-04-30 14:10:00,2419,"Ive taken part in the marshmallow technique years ago as well. Bottom bouncing them in Ontario Tribs......i think i tried it once or twice but did do well on them. I saw fish move to the mallo and strike it..........i also caught  a few at the end of the drift with my bait just sitting there and felt the WRAP WRAP Smack of a hit.......most were little jacks. So i have proof that they will strike the mallow. Having said that i can see both sides of this arguement. There are guys that are fishing this legally and ethically with no ill intent, and there are guys rigging this up with the sole purpose of lining a fish or hooking a fish any way necassary.......i dont think this can be specifically attributed or blamed on the marshmallow however. Bottom line in my eyes.......if your hooking the fish because of a voluntary ""take"" on the fishes behalf.........then carry on, if you notice that you are bringin in a large percentage of your fish with the hook on teh outside of the mouth, then change up your presentation........marshmallow or not. If you continue knowingly lining fish, then your not in the game for the right reasons. Might as well grab a net, scoop em up, put your hook in their mouth and let the drag scream.   Thats just my opinion, may be right, may be wrong, but its mine lol."

So fish must never hit CORKIES either then do they??? In fact corkies are an even better way to line fish being that your drifting the whole time, and ppl do from time to time so is that not a unethical way to fish??  Ive caught tons of salmon with the rod in a holder and they pound a marshmallow, its not hooked in there face its well in there mouth. Males and females. I always use bright colours and the fish hit out of aggression. I dont sang fish or try and line them and rarely have I ever foul hooked a fish."

Some People no matter how hard you try to explain something in a fashion that makes sense just dont get it... Let me say something that   any normal angler will understand......there is a difference between a fish chraging and attacking a bait because it thinks its food as opposed to it running into its mouth and you drive the hook home....anyone who thinks that the latter is sport well they are just loose a few....  This has nothing to do with elitism, or snoobish attitudes or mentality, rather it has everything to do with something that is imoral and lacks a huge amount of ethics, any angler who cares is going to step up and try and educate others......again if you dont understand it then dont ad you person Bull in stead let this thread die and next time try and do some research on it before engaging foot in mouth..

If you wish to enter a discussion on the merits of educating ppl on the right technique Im all ears but if you want to take it to some other level.............well I dont think so ........saw enough Bush this weekend for a while  On a side note I re read the initial response to the question asked....dont know where some of the comments came from, maybe someof you quaterbacks should answer it rather then jump on someone for actually answering the initial post..."
194120,danbouck,2008-04-29 23:50:00,4380,I am another who has witnessed fish coming to the surface to eat a marshmellow.  So to me there is nothing wrong with using it for bait. Those damn bass gotta stop swimming past my lures as well they might get it stuck in their mouths.
194122,Roy,2008-04-29 23:52:00,13728,"Has anyone read any mention in the regs about marshmallows being an illegal bait? Or corn maybe? How about foam? The problem with the thread right now as far as I can see (I may certainly be wrong) is that someone mentioned the word ""lining"" and everyone  and his dog who is a self proclaimed expert has chimed in. If you don't like the laws, get your act together and have them changed. In the meantime, don't get in someones face who asks a simple question about something that they read in a book about fishing."
194127,jonnybass,2008-04-29 23:56:00,346," I do get it. I think you're an   for trying to force your Bull on other people regarding something that is perfectly legal and doesn't require $1000 worth of steelhead gear to do. Sorry for not responding to the rest of your rant as I more than covered all of it in my previous post.  I will say this:  Is shooting a deer ""sport""? Are hunters ""loose a few"" too? Because the last time I checked, the deer didn't ""bite the bullet."" no pun intended."
194128,Guest gbfisher,2008-04-29 23:56:00,0,I use a williams ice jig. Mellow on each hook.
194133,Roy,2008-04-30 00:01:00,13728,"I'm trying to figure what this means Luis. ""If you wish to enter a discussion on the merits of educating ppl on the right technique Im all ears but if you want to take it to some other level.............well I dont think so ........saw enough Bush this weekend for a while"""
194135,irishfield,2008-04-30 00:01:00,26272,I haven't seen any bush in days...
194136,aniceguy,2008-04-30 00:02:00,1094,Im an ass eh........nice on you way to step down to the level of bubbles and crew...Im not even going to say what I think  The technique of using a marshmellow is going to get you charged.....using a treble hook that has lead added when not treated as a gaff isnt illegal but its gonna get you chaged 100%  God some people are just that dense I guess  how can you put hunting in the same context as fishing LOL  Im done Now Mod's you have someone calling me a name how are you going to respond to that Done here Roy I ll pm you the rest
193883,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-29 17:53:00,241,I just picked up a book from my local library branch entitled Great Fishing In Lake Ontario & Tributaries by Rich Giessuebel. It came out in 1986 so it's a little dated but it's still a good read. He mentions using small marshmallows as bait for catching steelhead and I've never heard of this technique. Does anyone do this? Does this really produce fish?
193894,Golfisher,2008-04-29 18:24:00,586,"Lining, perhaps?"
193906,cranks bait,2008-04-29 18:49:00,721,"Not sure about that, but I have used bubble gum to catch bass."
193911,GBW,2008-04-29 18:56:00,8460,I have seen them sold at some places.  i found something just like this at Gagnon's last time i was there...  
193917,nancur373,2008-04-29 19:35:00,1211,I caught a few speckles on orange marshmallows on Saturday. Found an old bag of mixed color mallows in the cuppboard. A guy at work caught a 32lb salmon in Port Credit on a white mallow last year.
193926,aniceguy,2008-04-29 19:52:00,1094,"The purpose to a marshmellow is to raise the hook off bottom.  Salmon and Rainbows when in a river face up stream and open and shut thier mouth to pass water and O2 over the gills to breath.  What the marshmellow rig does is  take advantage of this life process and allow the line to pass through its mouth, tension is felt and an angler ( I use that word loosely) sets the hook.  Regardless of its sale it is beyond immoral and in fact is illegal...You run the potential of being charged....  Hope that answers you question and I think a moderator should lock and delete  this thread"
193944,MuddyWater,2008-04-29 20:23:00,218,marshmallows are not illegal and they work good for salmon especially fire them off a peir around even in green colours and hold on. ive caught even big ass browns off a pier. salmon and trout like bright round objects and they always will try them out.
193946,mepps,2008-04-29 20:27:00,1301,When my stepdad owned a hardware store on the Credit River marshmellows were the number one bait. He normally just sold the big bags you see at the supermarket (both large and small marshmellows) - doesnt have to be scented to work I guess!
193948,Burtess,2008-04-29 20:30:00,901,"I will agree with aniceguy on this topic, most marshmallows (or earplugs, cig. butts, hockey cards, etc. lol...) are used at river mouths when the fish really come in and allow you to line the fish.  Most fish caught this way will be hooked on the outside of the mouth, and many will be lost after the initial run.  Whether the thread should be locked or not, I don't know.... usually makes for a heated discussion  Burt"
193952,MuddyWater,2008-04-29 20:33:00,218,so if your fishing roe bags you line them as well? whatever go fishing or something....
193954,Burtess,2008-04-29 20:40:00,901, Here we go  Burt
193958,snag,2008-04-29 20:44:00,1932,That Billy Curtiss is one bad seed. Knew he was trouble right from the start. Devil plays a banjo!
193959,capt bruce,2008-04-29 20:44:00,820,"OH oh BERT , Now look what ya done lol hahahahaha   I find they really go for the camp fire ones the best and the flameing mallow looks great on the cast lol"
193964,danbo,2008-04-29 20:47:00,2646,
193965,GBW,2008-04-29 20:47:00,8460,you must be using a super line...
193966,rhare,2008-04-29 20:47:00,387,"I agree with muddywater, I never line fish and I have caught plenty of salmon with marshmallows. Some days they only seem to hit the marshmallows and leave the roe alone.  Why should this thread be locked? Im sure theres plenty of other ppl on here that dont line fish with marshmallows."
193972,Disspatcher,2008-04-29 20:52:00,73,Ive never seen anyone Line a Steelhead. Salmon maybe but not a bow.
193975,Cory,2008-04-29 20:58:00,170,Maybe they should ban the sale of floating jig heads too....  And lock all threads posted about them.
193983,aniceguy,2008-04-29 21:11:00,1094,"man I sure could post a pile...Let me make this really simple........and blunt using a marshmellow rig in an estuary, is lining a salmon/rainbow, no they arent hitting it out of agression, or do they desire the wonderful taste that confectionary sugar even when loaded with great garlic scent as a meal.  Its lining, flossing, and beyond its immoral illegal ( please ask a CO ) any credible angler looks at someone with this rig as an utter and complete idiot who's aim is to hook a beast at all costs, in many cases they dont know better and thats where some simple education comes into place....where did someone post blah blah blah.....lets go find some musky's and walleye and fish for them with some marshmellows now"
193996,BillM,2008-04-29 21:29:00,17367,"I've never heard the term 'lining' before, but I am assuming you guys are referring to snagging?  I really don't know how using a marshmellow inplace of roe (Which I have done many times) means that I am intentionally trying to foul hook a fish.  If someone could explain that to me, I'd appreciate it."
194000,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-29 21:37:00,241,"What a thoroughly enjoyable read to wake up to after a nice afternoon nap! I don't believe the author was referring to lining at all. And if fish didn't go for marshmallows of their own volition, wouldn't the sale of these particular bait marshmallows be illegal as well? Isn't it true that many fish will potentially attack any lure out of curiosity and may be doing just that when they hit a marshmallow?"
194008,Burtess,2008-04-29 21:48:00,901,"Lining refers to hooking a fish by allowing the line to run through its mouth, eventually allowing the hook to catch on or in the mouth.  During the heat of the salmon run on Bronte for example.  You will see many people lining the walls of the harbour, lines cast out and held tight.  Most use marshmallows or earplugs for ""bait"".  Many have seen people fish salmon this way so this is what they believe is a legit way to catch them, they are oblivious to the real method they are using to hook them.  The ""bait"" is cast out as far as it will go, it is helpful to have the rod as close to the waters surface as possible, so to cut down on the angle of the line in relation to the lakes bottom.  This allows more ""fishable line"" to be used.  As the salmon or trout swim upstream the line is caught in their mouths.... (most salmonoids will develop a pronounced kype when ready to spawn.... this is also why most caught this way are males...) and as the continue swimming the line passes through until the hook finds its mark.  I will admit, when I was a teen I used to fish like this.  I used a large marshmallow threaded on a big siwash hook.  Effective but wrong.  At the time I thought they were eating it too..... don't fool yourselves though...  Burt"
194014,Burtess,2008-04-29 21:59:00,901," I know you didn't start the topic for this reason.  But the reality of the situation must be understood.  This is why I said that it is a popular topic for debate lol...  Louis is a very knowledgible steelheader and he doesn't post Bull... if he posts it he knows what he is talking about....  And if the salmonoids are attacking marshmallows out of curiosity, then there must be many curious fish out there since it is a quite effective method, even if only on the male of the species...  Burt"
194022,Greencoachdog,2008-04-29 22:09:00,8163," Maybe you should keep your morals to yourself.  Have you ever watched a marshmallow on a line in the current? It doesn't just sit out there flat and still, that thing is flapping in the current like a Pick handle beatin a garbage can 'Possum!!!... and for it to ""ring"" a fishes mouth without the fish grabbing it is highly unlikely!!!"
194023,steve_paul,2008-04-29 22:09:00,658,"The age old marshmallow debate, we have it at the trailer every time we have a fire.  Wife likes them just browned but I love the little suckers burning up and black.  Causes a fight everytime we pull them out."
