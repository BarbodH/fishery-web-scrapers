194786,kingofthesteelhead,2008-05-01 02:18:00,140,Got out this weekend to the Kawarthas for crappie. Went out Saturday with my Dad who is 88. We went out to our prime spot and not a boat in sight. First cast produced a decent crappie. Down goes the anchor and from 830am until 200pm we did not have to move. The first couple of hours your float wouldn't go a few inches and down it would go. Most of the fish were in the 8-10 inch range with a few 11-13 inchers in there for good measure. At one point my jig was hanging over the water when I was doing something and a fish came up to the surface and inhaled it. This was probably the most crappie I have ever caught in a single outing. We lost count but I would figure 300 or more between the two of us.    Sunday morning I went back there by myself and there were three boats on the spot and fishing was very spotty with a few fish here and there and mostly small ones. Moved around a bit and about 1230pm was almost ready to give up when I found a little cove and it was full of slab sized crappies with a lot of 12-14 inch fish. 60 crappie later and it is 430pm and finally they are slowing down and I am finally able to drag myself away from this honey hole.

194847,Sinker,2008-05-01 04:25:00,8692,"Nice! Do you know what the water temp was? What kind of depth were you fishing? Any colour produce better than others? My opener was slower than usual, but we managed a few for dinner.   My old man is on his way here from the rock right now. We'll be slayin slabs this weekend in the rain, and chasin pickeral next weekend. Can't freakin wait!!!  Thanks for the report!  Sinker"
