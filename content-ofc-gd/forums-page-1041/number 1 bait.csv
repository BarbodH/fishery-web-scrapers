Most times no piece of worm is need but sometimes they just want a little meat taste on it. This year I am going to try a piece of Berkley Gulp worm and see what it does. On the live crawler I like the dark end of the worm and pinch it off right below the collar. Using this short of a piece of worm there are no short bites and they have to take the hook.  One of the VERY nice things about using Bucktail jigs over plastics in the weeds is the bucktail holds up when ripped through the weeds while a plastic tail will start to come off. This is a HUGE advantage when popping jigs through weeds.  BTW I like to use a 6.5' LIGHT rod and 4# test but 6# test will work.  Good Luck, Bob"
