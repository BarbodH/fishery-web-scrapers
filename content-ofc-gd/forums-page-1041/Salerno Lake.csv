My wife and I are thinking about buying a cottage on Salerno and I want to make sure it has good fishing. I understand there are musky, small mouth and walleye. Thanks in advance."

I know they do better thru the ice for eyes, but we did fine in may. All kinds of bass.  Great area for a cottage too. Your close to lots of great water. More than you can fish in a lifetime.  I had a buddy with a place on fortesque, and its pretty good too.  There are a few portage in lakes around there as well. We get into some splake there one time......I can't remember exactly where we were, but I know it was accessed from fotescue lake.  Sinker"
