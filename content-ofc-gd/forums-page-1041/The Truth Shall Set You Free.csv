Back in 1976 we used to take the lakeshore bus from Hamilton to Bronte and fish with jet puffs under the hwy 2 bridge. We used to catch salmon on this rig--one note here--the bite was sudden and quick--now if this fish was swimming with his yap open and the line was dragging thru --the pull on the other end would have been more gradual---was'nt--matter of fact my buddy had his rod pulled into the water it was that sudden.  2. We started heading up creek around the first corner (Now that was before it became off limits because the anglers thought they could burn down living pine trees and peoples fences for firewood for those campfires) Anyway one day we met this guy throwing a skunk flatfish in this area and he was schooling all of us--so much for the not biting.  3. the largest steelhead I ever caught (15lbs) i caught in Lowville about 2 weeks after opener on a ---ready for it?? --you guessed--a yellow and red panther martin spinner----again when lowville was able to be fished before the picnic table tossers fixed it for the rest of us.  4. Lastly years ago I met a fella from newfoundland who was at Bronte the same time I was there in the fall--we got talking and we actually fished together for a while--again I watched as he repeatedly caught late run cohos on a perch coloured countdown rapala--go figure  So I guess at the end of this novel I will never say any bait will not work.
