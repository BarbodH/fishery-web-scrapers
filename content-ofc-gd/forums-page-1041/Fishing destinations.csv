Someone mentioned to me to try Island Lake conservation area  Can any one suggest any other spots or lakes we can access that we can get more action, we will only be doing fishing from the shore as dont have a boat.  any advice would be great. thanks"

194429,Golfisher,2008-04-30 17:07:00,586,"Check with the park beforehand to make sure that it's open.  It might still be closed.  Also, if you can, rent a boat & trolloing motor combo.  Prices have gone up a bit, but it won't break your bank.  Shore fishing is somewhat limited in that lake."
194435,hi09,2008-04-30 17:22:00,46,  so do you know any other places in or around that area we can try that may be a bit better for shore fishing? also any suggestions on where i may be able to rent a boat?
194443,Golfisher,2008-04-30 17:30:00,586,"You can rent a boat from the park.  Go here for details:  Island Lake  For other places close by, click this link for more info:  CVC"
