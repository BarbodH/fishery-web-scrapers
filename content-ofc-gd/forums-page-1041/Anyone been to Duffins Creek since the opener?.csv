194790,Paulus,2008-05-01 02:24:00,522,fished the confluence down to the barrier today. I should say I walked it. There were no fish to be seen in that stretch. Good luck!  p.-

The creek seemed pretty devoid of fish.  Always worth bringing a rod...Stop in at Tightlines and ask for info...If the steel aren't biting, stick a worm on a hook and fish for suckers if they're there."
