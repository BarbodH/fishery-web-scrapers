194388,taper,2008-04-30 15:55:00,611,Any ideas what a 2003 Lund V Rebel SS 1650 with a 25 hp Mercury bigfoot on a trailer is worth. From pictures looks to be in good shape.

194393,Gerritt,2008-04-30 16:01:00,6129,Does it come with any accessories? do you know if it leaks? is the lowerend water tight? how many hours? original owner? Console or Tiller? there are alot of variables here...  But I would safely say between 5-10k again depending on the above  MTP just bought a new hull... might give you a better idea..  G
