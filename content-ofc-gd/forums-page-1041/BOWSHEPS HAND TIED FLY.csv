194874,bowshep,2008-05-01 11:19:00,378,Your Welcome. Thank you for getting me hooked on tieing but my friends are mad because l don't get out much any more what an addiction.  Peace Ken
194875,MJL,2008-05-01 11:20:00,2427,Nicely done. Great work on Bowshep's part.  Would that happen to be a Thunder Creek silver shiner pattern lodged in its yap?
194877,bowshep,2008-05-01 11:26:00,378,"Yes it is with a double wrap wire, gold tinsel with brown and white deer tail on a #10 3x wire. It is really nice that l was able to reproduce a copy from the book but l have already started modifying. Thats the part that is so addicting. What if l did this. l already have 5 variations of the Thunder Creek and l was listening to ACDC at the time lol.  Peace Ken"
194878,canadian_copper,2008-05-01 11:27:00,925,NICE REPORTS DAVE AND BEAUTY FLY KEN!!!
194881,wuchikubo,2008-05-01 11:32:00,1114,"Nice post Dave.  Good looking fly Ken.  I was thinking about tying one of those too lately, but was questioning myself on what would take it. Now I know, thanks.  Time to tie some up for the weekend as it looks like it will be a quieter day at the office.  Stan"
194883,bowshep,2008-05-01 11:37:00,378,Stan l used a double wrap on the wire because l knew the water was faster than normal so it will drop quickly but in slower water you just need a single wrap. l also have added a bit of white Marabou under the wire to add more action with the tail. but don't let the Marabou extend past the tail.  Peace Ken
