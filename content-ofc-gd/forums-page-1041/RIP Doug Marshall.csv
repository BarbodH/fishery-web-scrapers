193757,chickenhawk,2008-04-29 06:24:00,612,I am from the Long Point area and just found out that Dougie Marshall has passed away.....he ran a charter boat out of Port Rowan for many years and was an avid angler like the rest of us....he will be missed greatly amongst the communities in the area.....and it will be unfortunate that I will not see his boat out on the bay no longer....
