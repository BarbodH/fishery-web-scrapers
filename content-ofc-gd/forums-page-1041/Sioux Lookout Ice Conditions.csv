193718,trapshooter,2008-04-29 02:47:00,1234,I heard they just got a bunch of snow in dryden.  I'm sure the ice is still on up there.  It can take as long as May 10th to all go.
193763,tjsa,2008-04-29 08:43:00,1578,"Probably still 20"" of ice in Sioux Lookout area. Our temps recently have been dipping down to an average of -5C overnight, and only getting up to about +5C. I do know Kenora got about 1 ft. of snow a couple days ago, saw pics from a guy living there. But still, the ice has got to be getting soft. We were out fishing 2 weekends ago about 2 hrs. west of Thunder Bay and the ice surface was getting soft, even though there was 24-30 inches of ice on the lake. We didn't go ice fishing last weekend, but I am sure we could get one last walk in trip this coming weekend if we choose to."
