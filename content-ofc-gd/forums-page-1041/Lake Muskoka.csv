194655,danc,2008-04-30 22:15:00,4677,"I'll be staying at a resort on the south end Lake Muskoka in mid June for 4 or 5 days this summer. I'll be going for my step daughters wedding, but of course I'll be bring some fishing gear along. What's in there? Is shore fishing feasible? I won't have boat access, or much time for that matter, but I wouldn't mind chucking a few lures when I get the chance. Any and all info is appreciated. Thanks.."
194693,Terry,2008-04-30 23:09:00,14456,"I don't know the lake at all, but there are enough of us around here I am sure we can get you out in a boat for part of the time too if you want"
194723,Hookset,2008-05-01 00:21:00,367,"It's a good Lake. Big Pike, Walleye and Smallmouth. There's Largies too but they're a little harder to find. Lake Trout as well and not sure about Whitefish or Ling lol. It's a big lake with great structure everywhere, deep and clear. Since it sounds like you're staying at, or close to, where I work I'm sure chucking a few should be no problem. There's some great Bass fishing within a 15 minute drive too, not that I'd rather try that or anything  Hookset."
194728,Raf,2008-05-01 00:37:00,3495,"deep, clear, pressured.  lakers and pike will likely already be deep that time of year.  i've never tried but i'd say shore opportunities are limited."
194730,Hookset,2008-05-01 00:38:00,367,dang i keep doing that. sorry. Bass would be opening later  Hookset.
194731,irishfield,2008-05-01 00:39:00,26272,Could always make a side trip on your way home Dan.. take 11 vs 17 !... if ya know what I mean...
194743,Roy,2008-05-01 01:09:00,13728,I'd be re-scheduling her wedding to coincide with the Lakair G2G.
194795,danc,2008-05-01 02:32:00,4677," If it was up to me Roy, the wedding would take place at Lakair on the third week of June.  Thanks for the replies guys. And thanks to those that pm'ed me. I'll be getting back to you guys in a day or two."
