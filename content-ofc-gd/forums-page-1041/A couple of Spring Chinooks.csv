193166,ccmtcanada,2008-04-27 22:54:00,7971,Great job out there!  The lake looked like glass out there and the fish had some great colours to them.  Congrats on a successful day!
193178,irishfield,2008-04-27 23:06:00,26272,Great stuff Dax... gotta do something to fill the time 'till June ! lol
193179,silveradosheriff,2008-04-27 23:06:00,1025,Nice work Dax - it was tough sledding out there today. Would you mind sharing some details? (PM me if you prefer).  Thanks!
193190,Pigeontroller,2008-04-27 23:28:00,2793,"Rod, I'm not an experienced enough Salmon guy to have any secrets! Both fish came off the rigger on a NK spoon(blue/white), 50 feet down and about 40 feet back. We were in 75-110 fow right off the canal. Fished from 7am till 1030am, both fish were about 930-945 back to back. marked lots of bait/hooks in that same area, nothing anywhere else. I was running 2 riggers with spoons, and 2 Dipseys on the 3 setting back about 75-100 feet, one with a Spin Doc & fly, the other with a spoon. Dipseys didn't get a sniff..."
