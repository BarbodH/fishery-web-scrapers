How do you guys add the multiple pictures to your reports and replies that makes them sooo good!  I was thinking about using the photobucket.com album i have but i don't know what option to choose from that site either.  any help in this would be greatly appreciated."
194610,Gerritt,2008-04-30 21:37:00,6129,photobucket is the way to go... once you upload you're pics use the IMG code and paste it in here.  I can walk you through this just drop me a PM if it does not work.  G
