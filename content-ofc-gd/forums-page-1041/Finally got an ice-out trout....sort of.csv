In the past couple years I've been out there in freezing rain and sleet, or if the weather was nice I was still paddling around ice sheets....maybe this year I would finally get the timing right.  Sunny day, no ice....but no shallow fish.  Good think I brought the heavy jigs, cause I pulled this guy up from about 40 feet!  Yesssss  "
194287,turtle,2008-04-30 10:58:00,274,Nice fish.  In early spring I get as many lake trout down 20-30 feet or 10 feet down suspended over deep water than I do in shallow water (less than 15 feet).  I find them scattered all over and get most by trolling.  I have caught the odd one shallow on a white tube.  Its great to be out that first time on a quiet lake by yourself.
