194174,shane,2008-04-30 00:44:00,652, I think someone's had a bit too much of Granny's tonic.
194282,Clampet,2008-04-30 10:16:00,1947," Really?  Check out the below thread. In that thread I was asking a civilised question, and was treated to an infantile answer by Lundguy, who then proceeds to chastise others to show maturity, that's what got me riled.  Now he is feigning ignorance. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=18540"
194288,lew,2008-04-30 10:59:00,12767,"Hey Jed, I think your confusing those Lund fellers.  Your having a spat with LundGUY and the feller in this thread is LundBOY  Course I could be wrong too"
194300,Cory,2008-04-30 11:46:00,170,Should have bought a crestliner
194334,Clampet,2008-04-30 13:39:00,1947," My apologies, Lundboy, I am indeed mistaken. I am done with my rant. Hope I provided (some form) of entertainment."
194356,Kirk,2008-04-30 14:32:00,347,Someone hears the F word and internet rants are posted and letters get sent...LOL
194577,Tinman,2008-04-30 20:55:00,376,"i got a call from the district manager, he is going to check with the store manager."
194578,Tinman,2008-04-30 20:58:00,376,"  Do you have any small kids that are just picking up language? Would you like to have them repeat what the guy said? Then maybe you may see my point. If it was just me, then i would have gotten mad, and told him about keeping comment to himself."
194710,Clampet,2008-04-30 23:47:00,1947,"I heard that the Steeped Tea will be back soon , as the last batch was ground too finely and was clogging their brewing filters."
194823,jil101ca,2008-05-01 03:23:00,41,"I don't think working at Timmie's means nobody else will hire you. I have awsome references and a great job history. I work at Timmies and have for 2 years. Not all Timmy workers are dead beats. I work there because I chose to and I enjoy the job except when the miserable people come in. How many of you hear the ""Good morning, how can I help you"" or ""how are you today?"".You would be amazed at how many customers are rude or just plain mean.  Steep tea will be back within a week. The tea leaves were not allowing the water to filter, that part is true."
194056,Guest lundboy,2008-04-29 22:49:00,0," huh? Wasn't directed at anyone here....  I was referring to someone I worked with who I don't think was you.  Unless you were in to spending your $8/hr paycheck every night bar hopping and partying from the time you were 23, and ended up with a criminal record for pulling a visa refund scam in a retail establishment when you were 27."
194062,Clampet,2008-04-29 22:54:00,1947," Ya got this here Lund guy tellin' people to behave like an adult, he should take his own advise or... CLAMP-IT."
193054,Guest lundboy,2008-04-27 16:08:00,0,Wow and you still ate or drank your order?  You are a very Brave guy....
193055,Tinman,2008-04-27 16:10:00,376, even telling me that would have been better
193059,shane,2008-04-27 16:19:00,652,"I'm not a big fan of Tim Hortons but I do go in my local one a couple times a week just because it's right there.  There is an older lady that works there regularly that is the sweetest, most polite person you could ever meet.  She calls everyone 'dear' and always 'please and thankyou' and (almost) always smiling.  I don't know how she does it considering how rude a lot of the customers are.  Also, it seems like Tim Hortons  is the very bottom of the job world.  One time I overheard two young staff girls talking and the one girl says ""God, I hope I get that job at 7/11""   Oh yeah..................steeped tea  (snicker, snicker, snicker)"
193060,Tinman,2008-04-27 16:21:00,376,"  I guess that is bad! I worked one summer at a fish store, i had cats follow me home."
193080,bassfighter,2008-04-27 17:28:00,366,"In the United States, you will get rewarded for your complaint. Many of my friend got theirs as well. They apologized, will get your address and other info on the phone, and mentioned you will be expecting food voucher on the mail soon.  My Dennis restaurant Problem - I got tickets valued at $40. my meal that had problem was only $12  My Ihop problem- We got $30 meal voucher  Dennis kid eat free meal on birthday.- my  son always fills out a form and get one from mail.  I try my best to drink other coffee brand, Timmis is making too much money , and their coffee at times seemed tasteless, if you take out the sugar and creme. Compare the taste to Starbuck coffee , it seemed to give you more coffee taste.  Will the employee at Calgary Timmis do better now that their pay is $15+  Joshua"
193085,Guest lundboy,2008-04-27 17:34:00,0," Nope, I know someone that works at a Calgary TH.  They only get paid that much because the cost of living is so high.  He has to rent a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 other guys to be able to afford the rent.  And it took them 4 months to get a place.  The $15/hr works out to be the equiv of the $8/hr minimum here in Ontario."
193104,Joey,2008-04-27 19:20:00,9122,"  Now that right there is funny, except I lived in Flin Flon for a few years and I Didn't play hockey  Joey"
193106,Cory,2008-04-27 19:27:00,170,Good reason to avoid drive thru's.....at least you get to deal with people face to face.  And you can always dump your coffee (tea) on them by mistake if they piss you off.
193141,Canuck2fan,2008-04-27 22:01:00,1444,  Sorry Joey.... and I picked Flin Flon to avoid such a problem on here.... The joke is usually about Sudbury but we have a lot of people on here from there so I didn't want to hurt anyones feelings.... Just goes to show it is a small world after all
193184,Joey,2008-04-27 23:09:00,9122," Hahahahaha, sokay, I wasn't born there.  There was some mighty fine fishing up there tho  Joey"
