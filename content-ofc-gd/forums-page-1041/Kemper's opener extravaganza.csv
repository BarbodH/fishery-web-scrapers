194193,kemper,2008-04-30 01:13:00,2232,Ill keep the words short and sweet here and let the picture talk for themselves. These are from opening weekend and a couple from tonight. I have more that I am not going to post because of landmarks in the backgrounds and there was also many more fish that were not caught on camera. Big male   fresh female from today   big male again   spawned out hen   nightime hen   early morning hen...long fish!   another early morning fish...very clean   All in all a good weekend of steelheading with countless fish landed and even more lost hahaa  You will probably see 1 or 2 more trout reports for me...and then its off to the lakes
