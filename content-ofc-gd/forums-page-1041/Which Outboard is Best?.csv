186949,irishfield,2008-04-14 14:26:00,26272, What do we need to wake up to... I've been in the boat and read the smart craft gauges !    Wasn't quite there in early October... but of course the season wasn't over yet either !  60 to 70 hours a week from May to Dec.. Don't need to live in Florida!
186954,Roy,2008-04-14 14:39:00,13728," Actually, he works 7 days a week and much more than 8 hours a day. The 2-3 times I was out on his boat last year we were out a full 12 hours each day and the motor ran all the time we were out there. But, I don't think he needs to justify that to anyone cause the man just doesn't lie."
187001,bucktail,2008-04-14 16:02:00,1857,"I have owned all 3 brands at one point or another  ( Evinrude, Merc and Yamaha ) and have to say that my lst 2 Yamahas are simply bulletproof. May not be the fastest but they will never leave you out there on the water and have never had one breakdown yet!!"

187901,2 tone z71,2008-04-16 01:32:00,1311,what kinda speeds ya running WOT with that 275 @ 21 pitch Wayne
187903,irishfield,2008-04-16 01:35:00,26272,"I saw 56mph on the GPS and 55 on the Smart Craft gauge... just before I blew the side curtain windows apart (3rd day of ownership! Warrantee replacement!). I wasn't anywhere near red line. The couple times I had the full top off I forgot to give it a good trimming run to see what it would do. Don't think it will make 60.  I forget for sure.. but I think that's a 14.25"" diameter prop."
187904,2 tone z71,2008-04-16 01:40:00,1311," thats awesome,great package forsure"
187908,HTHM,2008-04-16 01:47:00,4082,"Well one thing is apparent, when I buy my boat I am NOT gonna say one word about what brand of motor I have on it....... We need Lew on this thread to put out the flames!"
188434,Marc Thorpe,2008-04-17 01:15:00,621," No problems on the make of motor But....... It had better be a console  Hi Mazing,my point was,all manufactured products are prone to human error As far as stats, as a client once said to me one morning ""If your prop aint turning,you aint earning"" I have run 150 optimax's up to 1200/1400 hours on a single season(Good probability that in 15 years the main compressor for the fuel pump bearings may wear) ,Opti's growl like no other Verados 1200 hours,their Tanks (yet to have any failures)  I also sold my last OMC with somewhere between 6000 to 8000 hours (it was also the 60 degree engine which has been in production for 30 plus years),other than changing a power pack every 2 years,it ran perfect like a tractor  To be quite frank,other than maintenance and few evident wear downs on each manufacture,I was quite satisfied with both North American manufactures In any product the quality remains on the % of human error The last human on earth that was perfect,they put on a cross for it  I have not seen an Outboard made by man on a Cross yet   t"
188439,Mike the Pike,2008-04-17 01:19:00,3421, Ah Mark you too light for a tiller you would be blown off the back in an instant.Whats with the side console you prefer the full wrap windshield.  I have to admit trolling at 3 to 7mph with a tiller is brutal.
193292,walleyemaster,2008-04-28 04:09:00,325,yes i meant pitch not inches and i found out its a 23 pitch and my gps showed 58 mph...the boat is a harbercraft and yes it is lighter than most boats its 19.6 feet and nothing to it but aluminum 1.90 gauge and  no wood in this boat or carpet or plastic ...just aluminum..very cold boat....but smooth as silk on the water...i have owned many boats in my life all aluminum and i have to say this is the best boat by far ive ever owned....so i do appoligise for my mistakes on prop info and total speed 58 mph not 60mph .....friend of mine has a lund baron with a 150 yamaha...he cant keep up to me..boat is bigger than mine and i guess alot heavier.....the 150 suzuki on my boat is the same size as the 175 suzuki.....same size just less horsepower....
193840,Zib,2008-04-29 14:15:00,369,"I just bought a 25 HP Merc 4-stroke from Cabelas Bargin Cave. I never thought I would buy a 4-stroke but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. A new 2006 (display model) for $2,425 US. New retail is $3,400. So far I love the motor. It's quite, runs so smooth & it sips gas compared to my old 2-stroke."
194305,Mike the Pike,2008-04-30 12:12:00,3421, Zib you are going to love the 4 stroke world let us know  how its going as the season progresses.
186627,Mike the Pike,2008-04-13 21:39:00,3421, Well I am glad I still live in Canada now Communist China is building all Mercury outboards under 90hp and now Brunswick dictates to all Lund dealers in the USA that they must put Mercs on their Lund Boats boy am I glad I don't live in the good old USA  The Land of the free.  Sheesh pretty soon it will be all Mercury because Brunswick almost owns all the boat Companies.  Can't wait to see all the outboard motor companies duke out in court.  
186628,Fisherman,2008-04-13 21:41:00,7201,"Honestly, without any disdain where anyone is from, I think the guys are more interested what we buy here and how it's packaged than what happens south of the border with dealers."
186632,irishfield,2008-04-13 21:46:00,26272,"Like I said in my post... any Lund dealer can still buy an engineless boat. They don't have to order a ""pre-packaged"" boat.  Anybody got a recent satelitte shot to see if the ice pack is off our lakes yet..."
186691,Fisherman,2008-04-13 23:36:00,7201,"Here ya go Wayne, still looks pretty white, small spot on Cooks Bay appears to be open. http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...on.143.250m.jpg"

186714,Bernie,2008-04-14 00:14:00,3190,Its supposed to get close to 20 here by Friday. I might be able to plunk a boat in this coming weekend.

186758,Bernie,2008-04-14 01:06:00,3190,Geeez Dawg. Dont tempt me   Have to wait until May 19th for open season. Then I can go and see if I can find 'em.
186788,Mike the Pike,2008-04-14 01:51:00,3421, Common Bernie go get us some Brookies.
186793,Bernie,2008-04-14 01:57:00,3190, I might have tried Mike but I gotta wait until all them little creeks that have recently turned into rivers to drop. And I think by that time it will be almost pickerel season. But the smelts may soon run down at Eagle Lake west of South River....this week I suspect. Wouldn't mind a pail of them!
186901,Billy Bob,2008-04-14 12:20:00,5865, You consider Q Land part of Canada because I know a lot of Canadians don't.
186922,MAzing,2008-04-14 13:19:00,43,"I don't know which is ruder, the Rude dude or the 2000 hours a year dude. Come on folk wake up 2000 hours is a full time job 40 hours x 50 weeks or a full year, I don't think he's from Florida.  I for one would not trust a Rude or would not buy an import. Never had a problem with Mercury and I've had many."
186028,Roy,2008-04-12 17:07:00,13728,"Well, this thread is a lot of fun too! Some really good techie type info on motors. I've learned a lot from this. Evinrude Dude, you're not being very polite in our community. We're going to take down one of your member names. Should it be this one or the other? Let me know please. Someone mentioned that you had issues, I agree. I also think that Bombardier Recreational Products will be sending you an email.  Be well...."
186032,irishfield,2008-04-12 17:17:00,26272,I'm sure Mercury's wondering why they have them as a dealer/warrantee centre as well Roy. Maybe I'll give Art a call...
185058,irishfield,2008-04-10 21:54:00,26272,Yes that is interesting.. missed that one! What break in period.. E-Tec's don't have one according to thoust whos make'm and Spectacklure !

184505,Headhunter,2008-04-09 20:05:00,5703,You picked on heck of a topic for your first poll! You might consider searching out previous threads on this topic... a little hint... look for one's that are locked! LOL] HH
184510,Bernie,2008-04-09 20:22:00,3190,  Ha Ha Ha Ha .. I aint touching this one!!!!
184513,irishfield,2008-04-09 20:28:00,26272,Here's my two cents..  
184514,Moosebunk,2008-04-09 20:29:00,3970,"Like Honda's and Johnson.  Biased, sure.  For use up here I've seen too many soft lower ends break easy on the Yamahas.  Mercs no experience.  Talking smaller HP motors here."
184517,irishfield,2008-04-09 20:37:00,26272,"The above said... I also have a 5HP and a 25 HP Honda. Absolutely no issues. Had a 115 Johnson 2 stroke on the last ""fishing"" boat... motor was good (a tad noisy in comparison to what I have now and or a Honda) but no issues with it other than hard cold starting.  I'm pulling it with a Ford.. so you may as well add that debate to this while you're at it! LOL"
184520,Billy Bob,2008-04-09 20:38:00,5865,If you do a lot of trolling the Honda is by far the quietest I never heard  After the Honda I would pick the Yamaha but I did hear good things about Evinrudes ETECH engine in the higher HP's.
184521,carll2,2008-04-09 20:38:00,443,"personally i rather yamaha..where i work during the summer we have yamahas on our transport boat 2 x 115hps 4 stroke with 1800hrs on it and still running strong, we also have a 150 yam 4 stroke with 500 problem free hours, now for our smaller engines we are slowly changing to mercury since they came back with the gear engagement right on the throttle....seen a blown verado this summer  had something to do with the electronics..really nice machine but im a yamaha guy  "
184522,Uncle Buck,2008-04-09 20:42:00,1000,Has the tiller/console debate started yet? LOL
184523,irishfield,2008-04-09 20:42:00,26272, I can't hear my 275 Verado running if the 25 HP Honda is idling at the dock beside it..or Mike the Pike's for that matter !
184527,danbouck,2008-04-09 20:54:00,4380,and it starts...
184528,fishinggeek,2008-04-09 20:55:00,325,Can't think of why an honest thread about outboard motors could get locked!  Sorry I should've clarified.  I'm probably getting something around 25-30 HP on a tiller.
184529,Pigeontroller,2008-04-09 20:56:00,2793,"I'm a Yamaha fan, I have a 2005 F90 with nearly 500 hours on it and it has been trouble free. You won't be sorry with a Yamaha, Honda or Merc 4 stroke!"
184532,irishfield,2008-04-09 21:03:00,26272, HAHAHA... guess you haven't read the others for some reason!  I'd go Honda in that HP range myself ! Our 25 Honda has been top notch....pushing a heavy steel 16' work boat.
184535,carll2,2008-04-09 21:16:00,443,"we also have a 16 ft misty river with a 25hp yamaha tiller..goes well, me alone in the boat with some gas and i can do 28mph on gps..good motor "
184540,Burtess,2008-04-09 21:28:00,901,"To make it fair, you should add up the votes for both Johnson and Evinrude as they are both owned by Bombardier Recreational Products and share similar technology...  Burt"
184553,Bernie,2008-04-09 21:55:00,3190,"Said this before. They are all good outboards. Depends mostly on what you use it for, your local repair facility(yes they all need this), warranty's and initial cost of the unit. Also what kind of maintainence is required each year. I have personal favorites for different HP ranges but so do most of you. The one thing I do have to add is it does not always need to be a 4 stroke. 2 stroke engines are lighter and run strong so sometimes better on smaller boats. Most 4 strokes tend to be quieter and better on fuel- but not always. Choose carefully and do research. It's a big purchase and you should get an outfit that will suit your needs the first time around. I see it time and time again people buying a boat and are looking a year or two later for another."
184566,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-09 22:16:00,4399," Well if thats the case then add up the Yammy and the Merc totals.  Yamaha,Mercury,Honda they`ll be good to you if your good to them.  I run a Yamaha but that is because the boat I liked came with a Yamaha if it would have been packaged with a Mercury it would have made no difference."
184597,Sinker,2008-04-09 23:13:00,8692,"I like my mariner. Its a cross between a yamaha and a merc. Great engine, takes a beating from ice out till ice up every year.  Sinker"
184598,Mike01,2008-04-09 23:17:00,378,When I was down in Florida a couple of months ago I was checking out some boats.  Suzuki's are becoming very popular down there.  I have a 50hp Merc and I find it fairly quite and havn't had to do any repairs yet (2 years).  If you had a 2 stroke in the past you will notice a big difference between the two.
184601,Greencoachdog,2008-04-09 23:21:00,8163,The best outboard engine is the one that isn't a TILLER!!!
184614,Mike the Pike,2008-04-09 23:36:00,3421,  Thats Ok Wayne I can't hear it either.  Come to think of it last November there was so much talking goin on about that big smelly sheeps head that was caught by Terry  in your boat that I could not hear your motor either  I would buy any brand 4 stroke made today have heard very few issues with motors that are properly maintained.  Now the can of worms is getting empty .  Tiller
184616,Sinker,2008-04-09 23:37:00,8692, Um.....where is your console right now?       I thought so.......hahahahahahahahaha   Sinker
184622,Mike the Pike,2008-04-09 23:45:00,3421, Thanks Sinker I just could not say this to my Southern friend.  Of course Dog forgot to tell ya he has been running pure hootch moonshine for extra performance   Now look closely the man has not one but 2 Tiller handles behind him.  
184662,Greencoachdog,2008-04-10 00:51:00,8163,Tiller definition:  tiller n 1: a shoot that sprouts from the base of a grass 2: someone who tills land (prepares the soil for the planting of crops) 3: lever used to turn the rudder on a boat... one step above a row boat 4: a farm implement used to break up the surface of the soil (for aeration and weed control and conservation of moisture) [syn: cultivator] v : grow shoots in the form of stools or tillers [syn: stool]
