194308,cranks bait,2008-04-30 12:20:00,721,I just entered the WFN Canadian Open yesterday.  I figure it's a good one seeing who is putting it on.  There is also this one that I found http://www.csfl.ca/

194333,Stoty,2008-04-30 13:38:00,2910,"Bassmania and Top Bass are great tournaments.  But then again...anytime you can get out fishing, including in a tournament, is a good thing! I dont think there is a ""bad"" bass tournament, for that reason."
