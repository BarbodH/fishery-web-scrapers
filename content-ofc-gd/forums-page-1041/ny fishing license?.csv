193242,muskymike,2008-04-28 01:57:00,772,"You can only get an online license if you have previously bought one, if not go to any sporting goods store or any store that has one across the bridge and pick one up. they are $40 i think for the ny non resident"
193249,carll2,2008-04-28 02:17:00,443,hmmm will a simple gps without any marine charts or road maps tell me where the boarder is?
193305,walleyemen,2008-04-28 09:43:00,316,"Carl remeber as well the boating safety equipment regs are different as well, you will need a detstress flag, flares and a sound device, check the u.s coast guard site, they have quite a presence on the river"
193306,Alumacraft,2008-04-28 10:05:00,139,Carl don't worry about the different safety regs on the american side you won't need anything extra. I spend alot of time on the lower river and I've driven right up too the US coast guard zodiac and asked them specifically about the dif. safety regs. Your good as long as you have all of whats required in Canadian waters.
