I have two Uni track mounts with Scotty rod holders, two Scotty round flush deck mounts that I can mount a camera on or just use for additional rod holder locations and a Humminbird Helix 5 SI depth finder. Great yak! Excellent platform that is comfortable to spend all day on. If I get tired of sitting and need to stretch my legs I can just stand and keep casting!  "

When I was looking at getting a Yak, This is the one I was looking at. I liked the seat being able to rise up. I found it to heavy for my liking.  I went with this. Ya it,s not a yak, but gets me out there.  "

958111,Shloim,2016-02-17 00:14:00,515,Thanks Drifter now look at that handsome guy...
958128,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-17 06:18:00,8243,Them are some fancy fishin Yaks there boys. We did some fishing out of Kayaks way back. Much fun and great exercise. I love when I see the salt guys hook into a small tuna. Those tails thrash and they have a 20 horse kicker on the side.  What are the ultimate things you need on them in order to be the man on the water. BBQ's?
