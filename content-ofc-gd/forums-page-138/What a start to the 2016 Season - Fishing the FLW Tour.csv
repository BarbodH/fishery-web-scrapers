956967,ONbuckhunter,2016-02-10 00:58:00,39,Well done Vince.  I think you used to fish BBTS a few years ago against me.  Anyways hats off to ya.  You're a good stick for sure.  It would be a really cool experience there no doubt.  Congrats.
956969,jedimaster,2016-02-10 01:13:00,3472,I did fish bbt yes with my cousin. He still fishes them. I had lots of fun fishing those. Maybe will try and get to some again. Thanks to everyone for the kind words. Really I can't say it enough all the kind words meant and means so much to me. if you are a torunament guy or girl. It's something you should really experience. Unlike anything I have fished up here.
957005,OhioFisherman,2016-02-10 03:32:00,6623,Nice job! You're famous!   http://www.flwfishing.com/tournaments/2016-02-04-lake-okeechobee
957101,MCTFisher9120,2016-02-10 22:45:00,3761,"Wow man nice job down there followed the entire event. Must of been a blast, I guess so many emotions going through the mind sometimes but when you let it all go and fish is when the magic happens. It's on my bucket list to get down to Okeechobee for a week vacation. Bring some flipping stick's, frog rods and some rods for swim jigs and chatter baits. Suits my style, learning the new vegetation and water colour would be the tough part at first I would think. I would love to just flip reeds and cover all day looking for those same 2 bites you got in your picture haha!  Please keep posting as you fish new events! Good luck this year  MTBF"
957151,Freshtrax,2016-02-11 03:49:00,2215,way to go living the dream man!
957156,jedimaster,2016-02-11 05:56:00,3472,"Honestly when I started it, it was all about fishing a bucket list lake, I figured the entry is close to what I would have paid for guides for two days. I just fished as hard as I could and came away with an awesome couple days of fishing. If anyone goes down there blind feel free to drop me a line. I learn a lot while I was down there. Would be happy to help people out. Just an amazing fishery. Did you guys know that the state of Florida pays anglers 100 dollars cash for pictures and measurements of any 8 pound or larger fish as well as location and lure. They use that info and post it on a website to help boost the fishing tourism industry."
957157,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-11 06:00:00,8243,"Fantastic Vince, you sure are headed in the right direction if it's tourney Bass fishing in your future. You had then dialed in really well that weekend that's a for sure. It is nice to have one of own representing all of us fish heads."
957158,jedimaster,2016-02-11 06:13:00,3472,"Now if only I could learn to type, lol. I re read some of what I posted. Wow. I am gonna blame it on the nerves as I still get chills sitting here staring at the flw trophy on the shelf beside my tv. Really the best part of the whole thing as far as results go is having that top 5 on the first tournament of the season and having 195 points banked in 6 event series. Huge. Last year the 5th place guys got 995 points total. That leaves me 800 points to accumulate over the last 5 events to have a shot at a top 5 that nets a good chunk of cash, an invite into the tour invitationals and invite to go pro next season. A top 100 grants me entry back in as a co angler. It's getting ahead of myself I know but just as in any sport points watching starts day 1. Top 100's average all the way should get me in contention for an invite back and a top 40 average should get me close to a top 5. One cast, One fish, one bag, one tournament at a time. For me this year my eyes are set on learning the tour lakes, picking up tricks of the trade from the pros and continuing to build on my knowledge and of course enjoy fishing."

LOL, Florida must be getting fished out! 40 years ago you could walk into just about any doctor's, dentist's, or business persons office here and see a 10+ pound bass on the wall! All live shiner fish with a guide!  I watched the day one weigh in, still some big names in there and a chance to learn from guys that have been there! Of course a little luck always helps! Have fun at it!"
957228,alphaalpha,2016-02-11 18:10:00,475,"very cool read.  Thanks so much for sharing, can really feel the excitement in your posts!  Keep it up, there will be lots of people rooting for you up here  cheers,  AA."
957233,jedimaster,2016-02-11 18:41:00,3472,Really means alot to have everyone support. Thank you all. I will be certain to keep everyone update on the ups and downs of the season as it unfolds.
957261,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-11 22:31:00,8243,"I did cross Okeechobee off my bucket list before the term was popular. My PB was 7 pounds 6 ozs. Our guide said I lost bigger fish until I lost my fear of pulling through slop.I think that us non Largie guys that fineness fish here have that fear and loose nice fish. If I can get a small 8 pounder there anyone can.  Note, using 10"" or bigger shinners on balloon floats you can see from 100 feet and a guide that has xray vision must help."
952351,jedimaster,2016-01-08 21:40:00,3472,"Well I made a snap decision to Fish the FLW Tour's opening event at Okeechobee begining of Feb. Going to be an awesome experience, starting to research the lake. How awesome would it be to get paired up with one of the big pros and get on TV. haha. Just totally phsyced to fish that lake and to fish it in that series, awesome. Anyone spent any time on the lake in Feb or late jan before?"
952618,reelinrolly,2016-01-10 22:14:00,281,"right on!!!  Ive never been, but I hope you have a blast!!!  Either way it will be an awesome experience!!!"
952644,Garnet,2016-01-11 00:02:00,2056,"Florida bass are much different than our northern strain. Leave your rattles at home. Don't shake your baits. You will need a stick for the jungle 1.25 oz or 1.5.  The grass flats are never ending. 6.5-7.5 baitcaster mf 12lb flouro. Most of the guides swear Florida bass can hear braid. And don't shake your bait. Standard setup 1/8 worm weight 2/0 hook 12lb just slid it in nice and quiet and wait for the peck.  Senkos catch don't shakem. Swimbaits you cant go wrong with GAMBLER BAITS. Spinnerbait will come in handy 3/8 mostly.   The water is tanic colour look for clear water and lighter spots on the bottom.  Florida colours Eclectic blue, purples. And did I tell you don't shake your baits. The thing about Florida bass is they hang around before and after the spawn so they get spooky on noise and movement."
952690,jedimaster,2016-01-11 06:14:00,3472,"Should be a blast. I know some folks don't like the Scott Martin Challenge show, but It was may favorite for a long time. I can't wait to get down there. Would be crazy awesome to get paired up with him or really any of the big guys. Have been gathering tones of great info on the lake it all helps."
952739,Garnet,2016-01-11 15:40:00,2056,"Jungle = Matts if your pro is fishing this you won't get to many virgin cast. But you can be a little more aggressive with the big stick.  Is it a full moon. Always brings a wave of spawners. You will not likely get a quality cast all day.  I did tell you not to shake your bait don't drag it either. And set on the peck.  A swimbait like the skinny dipper is great for covering water replaces spinnerbait.  Buggy Whips you will notice a little gap right next the stem. Most like 3cm that's your entry for 1/8 worm weight.  Every marina has 50 shiner guides working out of. If you are within 4 miles of take off these areas get hammered.  Thiers a good possibility you will get pinned against channel bank. I wouldn't compete with the pro. Fish the outside and look for opportunities.  That goes for jungle fishing and spawners. Look for opportunities and fish them Florida style no drag no shake. leave it on the bottom until you can't stand it then count to 30 slowly, really slowly.  That's about 30 years of Florida fishing on the big lakes.  Yes I do take my braid off in Florida.  Couple my buddy's are fishing a Castrol at the Big O this week as non."
952800,jedimaster,2016-01-11 19:51:00,3472,"Yah, my goal is first and foremost to put on on the culling string. After that a limit each day. I have done a fair bit of back boat tournament fishing so I have a whole other mindset when fishing from the back and usually do pretty good fishing the already touched water and finding other pieces. Anyway the experience of the stage and lake is why I am going. Will be awesome and thanks for the info."
952809,Garnet,2016-01-11 21:04:00,2056,Back boat here and back boat in FLW are completely different.  You have a 50/50 chance of fishing The Monkey Box. It's a huge piece of water that 300 boats fish everyday. You never seen used water like this.  Have fun and go for a limit.
956558,Garnet,2016-02-06 23:44:00,2056,Congrats awesome 5th place finish.
956860,mattybculp,2016-02-09 14:40:00,388,Great Job ! I see Chris Johnston came 3rd. Good showing for a local guy. I've competed in local tourneys around here. Both brothers are good. Im happy to see some canucks making some noise down south !
956877,206,2016-02-09 16:40:00,563,Nice....edged out Spiro by 3oz lol  Good to see Canadians representing!
956905,jedimaster,2016-02-09 19:33:00,3472,"Hey guys. its been a crazy week so far. What a great tournament and series. Day 1 was awesome. I mean it didn't start out that way. I had a hit from a giant right at the boat and didn't get a hook into it. After that my first fish didn't come until about 2 hours later right when the camera boat came over. Once that first fish got boated it was on. I ended up taking the day 1 lead with 18pounds 11 ounces and two giants. They were fully spawned out and very skinny but man were they long and such huge heads. They would have been all of 8-10 pounds if they were pre spawn. Day 2 was a big more difficult but I landed a number of fish and ended up in 5th place as above mentioned. Couldn't have asked for a better result and experience. My pros were awesome, the new Ardent Grand reels were excellent as were the smattering of Ardent edge rods I had in the boat. I was being pretty versatile throughout the day changing techniques, colors and presentations throughout. I got so many messages between day 1 and 2 and even after that the congrats kept rolling in. I am all registered up to finish the season and am looking forward to the next event on Hartwell on March 17th and 18th. Here are a few of the pictures from the event.  I was edged out of 4th by one ounce and would have had the tie breaker as I had the single day bigger bag. No complaints at all though.              "

956930,jedimaster,2016-02-09 22:04:00,3472,"The one thing I will say is the anglers in the tournament both Pro's and Co Anglers were amazing people. Everyone was so friendly and openly shared info. People were helping eachother with advice, what was and wasn't working, areas that were hot or not even up until blast off. It really felt like a bunch of friends going to bag some fish together. Was an amazing experience. I mean up here at any tournament man you don't even get a sniff of what people are doing and even after as we all know its mums the word. I mean I guess with the TV coverage down there and the sheer size of the field with people fishing shoulder to shoulder at times its a little harder to keep secrets anyway. Truly though I made some great friends and continues to be a great experience. Anyone considering these events I would strongly recommend it. Even as my plan was just to get out there and see how the US pros fish is well worth the price of admission in my eyes.  The first day was actually pretty funny, I was meeting my pro at Walmart where the final day weigh in was to be held and I drove in and drove across the roped off area and dragged about 10 rebars 50 feet before realizing what I did. I got out and everyone was killing themselves laughing. We all had a good laugh together and not 2 minutes later a pro wheeled in and he dig the same thing ont he other end. Boy was that every a relief. I tell you this having 169 boats all shut down there motors and everyone rising to hear Leane Rhymes belt out the national anthem was bone chilling to say the least. I mean ok so I found out after it was a recording but yah I didn't know any better at the time. It was really awesome to see the big stage in person and here him hollering out Five Bass limit for 18 pounds 11 onces, your new tournament leader. Something I will never forget after watching that on TV for I don'tknow how many years.  Living the dream as they say... for this OFC'r the dream is living on one bite at a time."

956939,Steve,2016-02-09 23:14:00,2075,"Interesting note about how the tournament discussions work in tournies down there vs up here.  personally, I believe it is due to ""pro's"" vs ""wannabees"".  Pro's are already doing it. They have confidence. They see it as growing the sport. They don't mind sharing, right up to blast off.  Up here most guys are only dreaming of being a pro, working Monday to Friday and fishing on the weekend. Therefore, fewer folks want to share any success or help....now, there certainly are the exceptions, like Mr Hirk on this thread who was very helpful when I fished with him.  But the norm is ""tight lipped"" leading up to an event, and even after an event.  Great on you to see the success you did down there, and even better to report it to us up here.  Cheers!"

956953,Steve,2016-02-10 00:02:00,2075,"You were a great help!!  Believe it or not, I learned a tremendous amount that day. I think no matter how experienced or skilled an angler is, they can always keep learning. Bass clubs are also great for that...lots of sharing.  jedimaster, if you could, what was the main difference (or differences) to fishing your program down there vs the same program or similar up here? You adapted very quickly, clearly. (way to represent Canada!!!)"
956960,jedimaster,2016-02-10 00:25:00,3472,"To be honest I didn't really do anything different than I normally did it accept for fish with heavier braid and bigger hooks. As was in my interview on the flw website after day one I figured that my pro was smashing smaller ones but he was sure there was bigger ones, I caught a 3.5 puns female that was spawned out so so I went on the bigger ones having spawned out as well, I ran my lure deeper into the weeds. They seemed to be hiring at the end of casts so I thought maybe they are a bit spooky having spawned recently. So I started bomb casting. Really it sounds like an ad but those ardent grands damn so they cast far. I also had a new curado with me and it couldn't cast nearly as far. Long casts quick adaptations to colour and retrieve techniques to try and weed out the small ones. Varied the size and thickness of plastic but really I caught good fish on blue, black, green, purple. Dark seemed like the right colour more than the actually color. Technique wise it was a lite bite, I could feel them tail biting them, so when I was getting a bite I would drop and dead stick then wait for another pull and slam it home up on my toes and pull them in fast as I could with the drag set to max. I spent a lot of time watching the pro and adapting and varying different retrieve rates casting areas and lengths I didn't really stil to one pattern for very long til I found one that got me into big fish. After I started slamming them the pros were looking back and eye balling me a bit was a very cool experience. I will stick to the same plan, fish the water given to me with the stuff I know, try and figure what's working or not and try to dial in a better and better presentation as the day carries on."
956965,Steve,2016-02-10 00:37:00,2075,"absolutely awesome!!  thank you for the reply.  out of curiosity, who were your pro's?"
956966,jedimaster,2016-02-10 00:55:00,3472,"Scott Wiley on day 1 and Pete Ponds day 2. Although I out fished both guys I can tell these guys can flat out fish. Cast control, knowledge, driving skill, finding fish, these guys are pros in every sense. I plan on keeping my Facebook site more up to date and keep my progress and perpetration work documented so if anyone wants to follow my page that would be great.  https://www.facebook.com/Vince-Yonemitsu-Fishing-673589596113335/"
