956738,4x4bassin,2016-02-08 16:45:00,1025,"Um... Unfortunately your friend is wrong. If you are convicted of the speed your were travelling or 16kmph or higher above the speed limit then yes you would receive points. If you plead to 15kmpj over or under that speed then you receive no points. That being said, insurance companies look at convictions not points Exactly this , he should know     As well as what I mentioned earlier , insurance companies look at convictions (minor and major) not points .That 4 pointer is a major infraction that you don't want .  I used to question fighting tickets and never did it when I was younger, now they can affect my job so when I was hit with a ticket similar to the one you are talking about I decided to fight it. Man am I ever glad I did.  Showed up to court, the crown calls my name and brings me into an office, reviews what I am there for, I agree, he says he would reduce it to ""failing to obey a sign"" 2 points, I said I was hoping for no points as it affects my job, he said to take what I am offered and to remember this; when your insurance company asks you if you have any speeding tickets you can still say no because you now have a ticket for failing to obey a sign.......nice guy Into court I go, judge reads our agreement and asks me if I am good with it, I agree, pay the fine and I am done. I could have went in there and said yes 3 times and left, I was all prepared with my long winded explanation to fight it...no need. In and out in 20 minutes, WELL worth my time. Fight it, they don't put up much of a fight. Another exactly , this is what you have to do and it is so easy . You take the time to show up there the crown will always drop the ticket down to a lesser charge and yes that includes points . Now there are certain times when this won't happen and that is if you a complete idiot at roadside with the officer (cops make notes at roadside and the crown will have these notes) and i'm sure this does not pertain to you . That's why you should be very accommodating with the officer at roadside even though you want to tell him off , bite your tongue , explain yourself  and take ticket to court if you get one !"
956743,manitoubass2,2016-02-08 17:15:00,11391,Go to the courthouse and ask the clerk for a few minutes to speak to the crown. Thats all I did.  The crown is available outside of the courtroom

Out of the 5 times i have taken a ticket to him i got off clean 4 of them. My work doesnt look too kindly on tickets these days so i have to fight them regardless, however i have saved a ton on insurance by fighting them"
956847,Acountdeleted,2016-02-09 12:57:00,2562,Back in May I had a ticket for distracted driving (was turning my GPS off at a light because I missed a turn and the thing wouldn't shut up) I politely told the officer what happened but they gave me a ticket.  I filled the paperwork for a court date and found out the police officer never filed their paperwork on the ticket so I got off. (I was lucky).  Moral of the story: you never know until you try. Just don't be a dick about it and good things might happen.

Said the City of Kawartha Lakes court (Lindsay) is small and fairly inflexible. Will cost $300 for paralegal to plead my case. Unless the cop messed up his notes, points will likely not be reduced.

You do not need the services of an agent to do this."
956672,captpierre,2016-02-07 23:34:00,2521,Got caught by OPP coming the other way on HWY 35 south of Lindsay. He told me I was going 115km/hr.  Limit is 80. I may have been going a little fast but not 35 over. Ticket is $271 and 4 pts. I'd like to fight this. There has been a lot of talk on CBC about radar calibration problems. I wonder if there are added accuracy issues with the OPP car also moving towards me as well. I'll be talking to my insurance broker tomorrow. Anybody have any suggestions?  X-COPPER? Thanks

956675,porkpie,2016-02-07 23:50:00,2521,"See if they have early resolution, set an appointment with the prosecutor and see what they offer you.  Most often you can plead out on your own without paying a paralegal.  Most of them are mopes anyway.  If you don't like the deal the prosecutor offers you, tell them you need to retain council and get a paralegal."

956702,4x4bassin,2016-02-08 05:29:00,1025,"I understand what some are saying in paying the ticket and moving on but I will advise you not to do that , especially with a 4 point ticket . Not sure if you are aware of how infractions work but a 4 point ticket is considered a major infraction with your insurance company and you don't want that . Any infraction under that is considered a minor infraction and that is what you want to get the ticket reduced to . Remember the point system is a ministry of transportation thing and really has nothing to do with your insurance company so any major infraction like yours and your premium  will almost always go up . Also when the police say to you no points with your ticket , that's fine but it is still a minor infraction with your insurance company and that is what really counts and as long as you don't have a string of infractions on your record you should be ok . So your best bet is to fight it yourself by calling for a first appearance and talking to the crown on your appearance date . Been several times and have always had my infraction reduced. Good luck !"
