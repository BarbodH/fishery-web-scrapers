957713,kickingfrog,2016-02-14 03:57:00,8333,Love it Bernie! I assumed it was sunrise but as soon as it got up there I realized it was a sunset flight.

Managed to take a couple loads of firewood across today.Travel is pretty good although a 4X4 would best be used off the road. There are a few drifts."
