957690,glen,2016-02-14 01:06:00,2641,I have a basement apartment in my house but I don't have an outside entry.  I do have a spot that a door could be put in the basement wall.  A window is there now. Basement floor to ground level (grass) is about 5'.  The steps would run along one wall and into the other wall.  Like the inside of a L shape.   Door on the small leg of the L. I would enclose the steps with roof and a door at the top.  Is this a good idea?
957699,leaf4,2016-02-14 01:18:00,2466,So long as you ensure proper drainage is in place at the entry I don't see why not. (Ie weeping tile)  A concrete drilling and sawing company can make quick work on a door frame with a hydraulic wet chainsaw.
957705,glen,2016-02-14 01:52:00,2641,It's dry and enclosing the steps should help with keeping it dry.  Then the steps won't be slippery either. I see they make precast basement steps. I wonder if that's cheaper.   Maybe you don't need footings then?
957709,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-14 02:46:00,8243,"Of course you need footings and the mew structure needs to be underpinned to the basement foundation. Water does not always infiltrate from the roof down. Ground water moves vertically and horizontally, changes from gas to liquid to solid too."
957729,Shloim,2016-02-14 13:05:00,515,"Not just those reasons, im in construction and doing a window well exit/ window in downtown TO this coming week. Tgere are a couple of other variables to consider. One is drainaage indeed changes even that a neighhbour has made can result in water build up that could come in. The other most commonly overlooked is the newly lowered frost line in that area can cause drains and water lines to freeze if below. ive seen concrete heave as well.... Not hard to do but not entirely clear cut."
957747,glen,2016-02-14 14:08:00,2641,I've lived here a long time so I don't think water will be a problem. Closing in the steps and having a door at the top may help with keeping the frost out. It should make the step safer too.
957781,glen,2016-02-14 16:56:00,2641,I'm going to dig into this some more.  Get some quotes and check permits. Any other thoughts?
957787,mbac31,2016-02-14 18:16:00,904,"glen, you can message me if you wish. I build new homes and can walk you through it."
957796,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-14 19:25:00,8243,"Glen it isn't huge job depending on what one considers huge. To my kid brother hanging a picture requires borrowed tools and help. It just needs to be done right the first time or you will be doing it right all over again. Don't wait for a building inspector to tell you it's wrong and watch him walk away saying ""Call me when it's right"".  Very nice of Smallie to offer detailed assistance."
957864,glen,2016-02-15 00:46:00,2641,Thank you guys.   I will keep you updated on how it's going.  Maybe post a few pics.  I guess it's going to cut into my fishing time.
957910,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-15 10:33:00,8243,PM me as well Glen if you wish. I no longer use it but I did pass the test for my GC licence in Ont and have done more than a few.
