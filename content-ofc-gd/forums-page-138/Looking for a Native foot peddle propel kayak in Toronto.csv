957743,CRAPPIE,2016-02-14 13:57:00,213, Thanks so much for your information and reply. I went to Vaughan Sail few days ago and looked around but no Native foot peddle kayak there then I asked the associate and she said they don't carry the Foot Peddle Kayak because it is too expensive to stock in. Can you tell me which Sail Store has it?  Thanks again!

957757,Shloim,2016-02-14 15:05:00,515,"Last year I thought they had a couple on display in vaughn. Different model I think, but a couple propels... Have you tried one? Because the best advice on any yak is try before you buy! I loved most aspects of mine but felt very cramped in it. Sold it when i bought my motor boat, but had a canoe before the yak and liked the extra bit of space for landing fish etc. I want a solo canoe/ hybrid now for getting out on a small lake near my house...."
