Enjoy the memories. Remember him well. This I do know makes me smile and chuckle each time something happens that reminds me of the days back when.  Do the same I say. It,s not easy, but you will feel so much better not holding a heavy heart.  As for getting out there, it,s up to you to do if so be it. I  missed my nans funeral out east. I wanted to go, but there was no way I could afford it.  Just said a prayer and remembered my young days back when .  Thoughts are with you and Peg and the family.  B"

He was told you are not going to make it; if it was me I would consider that was my last day hearing that news.  Every day after is a reward.  One never knows really how long he has and I'm sorry to hear of the bad news.  I hope you can see him one last time.  I'm not one for prayers but I will be today for you all, mother included."

I'm through Yellowknife on Tuesday and at the airport for a couple early evening hours if you at all feel the need to visit over a coffee.  Also, not having checked other airlines, I do know YK to Ottawa has a direct with return for $850 via AirNorth.  Don't know if that's good or not, but I could likely help you out with accoms if having to go thru Ottawa at all.  You will do what you must, all know that.  Best wishes."

Bunk u are also the salt of the earth, as someone cool once said, yes we knew he would not be around forever but in the last few months his life according to the doctors just was fast forwarded, kinda caught all of guard, he taught me all about hunting fishing making the most of everyday and most importantly. to be a giver in life and not a user  I will pm u tomorrow  U are one class dude"

957303,mr blizzard,2016-02-12 03:38:00,1589,"My much older brother who served his whole life protecting people in Canada, who had his knee blown out by a gun shot while responding to a call at a reserve just outside parry sound many years ago, who also had his cruiser roof ripped open while chasing a bad guy around a curve just north of the nb tims just north of bradford york limits , this area used to house an old abandonded brick warehouse, my brothers car went thru it spun around and ended outside again, only for my brother to get out thank fully and grab the bad guys collar who was laying face down in a ditch after he too had been ejected, just to stop the bad guy from drowning, ya thats the way it was in the not so old not so political days  Anyways I was told at 70 he was given 6 months,,,,,,,tonight my mother at 90 his step mother told us he has 3 weeks, talked to him tonight, he heard us a bit thru chemo sad part is he was a heavy smoker most of his life.  For a variety of reasons,we have not seen each other for over 8 years, jobs, distance etc  but whatever if i cant get back if anyone can pray for him it would mean alot  Brian knows i am telling the truth  probably the last time i will hear his voice,  along with my son and wife  And he was still polite on the phone tonight even after all the chemo  Do something nice for someone you love this weekend even if it is just a phone call to say hi  thx john"
957309,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-12 04:13:00,8243,Man John that's bad. My empathy for you. The airlines do have bereavement rates if need be. I know a pal that came from BC to TO for 10% of the fare. I know we don't want to plan for the worse but it's reality. Contact them now for a pre approved rate.

957321,irishfield,2016-02-12 06:13:00,26272,"John.. you're too old for the ""what ever"" mentality. You'll be there, I know you will no matter what it takes.  I don't need to tell you that at 70+ he's done well. We've both lost a Daughter, I've also lost a sister at 49.. father at 59. Does any of that make it any easier, of course not, but we have to keep life in perspective and 72 is the average male age in Canada.  That said, if he's currently doing chemo I would suspect he's got a little more time than you think to make that trip you probably want to take.. but possibly not, considering how quickly Jennifer went down hill, but I certainly hope for your sake that if you need to make the trip to make ""things right"" that you can.  Probably not the best laid out reply... but I think you know where I'm coming from."

They saved her life. We couldn't be more appreciative of all the staff there. It was a big deal for the hospital too as this doesn't happen enough, TV interviews, print media and radio, she became the poster child for hope. My point is miracles happen John. She drove here for a visit last summer."
