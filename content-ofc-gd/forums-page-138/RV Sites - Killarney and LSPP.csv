Being that its 12 hours away, we are going to stop at Killarney for a day or 2 to break up the drive.  Can someone recommend any decent RV sites, fishing spots(to take the little ones aged 10 and 6), bike trails, etc. I'll be in a 24 ft RV and have my two boys and wife with me. I've never been to either place.  Write back here or PM, suggestions much appreciated..."

Go to the reservations page and it should give the proportions of each site, and the maximum RV length. George Lake is an excellent smallmouth fishery, if you need any tips just ask, we've been going there for years."
957172,Dara,2016-02-11 13:47:00,3052,LSPP has 3 campsites. All are quite nice. http://www.lakesuperiorpark.ca/index.php/camping/campgrounds Rabbet Blanket is a pretty little spot and the kids can likely catch some splake in the lake. Nice spot to teach them a bit about canoeing  There are lots of viewing stations for Lake Superior after you pass the Sault so don't be in a rush to get there  Back in the day when the kids were babies and we weren't so regulated before the actual season started the gates to Crescent lake would be open. We used to pack up the tent trailer and go up there and camp for free and have the whole park to ourselves

It's hit and miss as to what they have for offerings as it depends on what the fisherman catch that day. Expect perch or whitefish. I have a friend who has a place on the North Channel, 5 miles out form Killarney and spent a week there this past summer. A big plus 1 to ensuring that you have what you need, before turning off hwy 69. The general store has some basics, but fresh fruit and veggies are few and far between... and expensive! HH"
