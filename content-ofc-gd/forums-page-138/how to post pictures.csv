957345,dave524,2016-02-12 13:15:00,4508,"What is the trick to posting a video?   Go to the video on Youtube , hit where its says ""Share"" and then you will be presented with an option "" Imbed "" click there and a bunch of goobledegook will show in a box highlighted in blue, copy that and return to the tab where OFC is and where you want to put the video. Hit reply and use the more options Enable HTML and paste it in where you want it. Maybe there is an easier way but that is how I do  it.     "
957360,adempsey,2016-02-12 14:28:00,1498,     Yes. Just copy the URL link in your address bar and paste it in.  
957366,dave524,2016-02-12 15:15:00,4508," Yes. Just copy the URL link in your address bar and paste it in.    Well damn, that is a new one to me. At one time, all that would do would be to put a clickable link in your reply that would take you to the video on Youtube if you clicked on it."
957384,Bernie,2016-02-12 16:06:00,3190,Thank you kindly Dave. It's on photobucket. I'll transfer it to YouTube and give it a try.

957085,leaf4,2016-02-10 21:03:00,2466,"Create a photo bucket account,if you're on  mobile, upload to whichever album you want, press the share button and select IMG, probably a similar process on desktop but I've never used this site from one so I don't know!"
957090,mbac31,2016-02-10 21:24:00,904,"no, it doesn't work. I cant use photobucket as its to slow. I have no idea how to post pics here."

957103,mbac31,2016-02-10 23:05:00,904,I have googled it and still cant get it
957106,misfish,2016-02-10 23:14:00,29133,"no, it doesn't work. I cant use photobucket as its to slow. I have no idea how to post pics here.   What do you mean by slow?  Have you tried to use  Choose files? click on a pic and click load. If it,s too big, it will tell you.  You can also down load a picture resize program for free.   http://download.cnet.com/Free-Picture-Resizer/3000-12511_4-10297789.html"
957142,Joeytier,2016-02-11 02:07:00,3990,Photobucket is as fast as my internet connection will allow it to be.  Also not sure what you mean by that.  You must be an impatient man  :whistling:
957168,wormdunker,2016-02-11 13:12:00,1711,"I also need assistance.  So to confirm your instructions.  Would I want to do this?  Would I ""open a new folder"" on my desktop (I am familiar with this procedure), then click & drag my desired photos into the new folder.  Then upload that new folder to Photo Bucket?  Thanx"
957169,solopaddler,2016-02-11 13:22:00,8605,"no, it doesn't work. I cant use photobucket as its to slow. I have no idea how to post pics here.  Upload the photos to photobucket. Under each photo you uploaded there are a number of different codes. For this particular forum copy and paste the ""IMG"" code into your text. That's it, it's very simple."

957211,mbac31,2016-02-11 17:05:00,904,it works with every other site except for here for some reason. I can type but when I go to paste the img link. It wont type anything. Not sure why.
957212,manitoubass2,2016-02-11 17:06:00,11391,Just copy and paste the image in the comment on here

957218,mbac31,2016-02-11 17:15:00,904,I'm not sure how to tell which one I'm using
957219,mbac31,2016-02-11 17:24:00,904,I have internet explorer 11
957220,dave524,2016-02-11 17:29:00,4508,"I'm not sure how to tell which one I'm using  probably IE 11, that is what comes with Windows 10. I have 10 and have no problems with either cut and paste or the quote function using Edge as a browser. Go to your start button and look for Microsoft Edge and navigate here and logon, try it from there or if your have Google Chrome that works too , I know."
957221,solopaddler,2016-02-11 17:32:00,8605,I'm using windows 10 and I'm copying and pasting the link to here in the text. I can type no problem but it wont copy and paste for some reason. I'd be willing to bet that's a browser issue. Google Chrome or Firefox usually work well.
957223,mbac31,2016-02-11 17:39:00,904,i will try the edge one. I have both.Thanks
