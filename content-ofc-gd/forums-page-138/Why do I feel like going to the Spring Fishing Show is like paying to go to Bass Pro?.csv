958010,adam lancia,2016-02-16 03:06:00,234,"What I get out of it most is having a few manufacturers there to pick their brain before going into a store to talk with someone whose job it is to sell you something. I was able to try my personal reels on a few prospective rods while speaking with a company rep. Normally, I would have had to make a few stops in order to get that done.  Impact Baits had some great deals."
958011,John Bacon,2016-02-16 03:20:00,3277,"I went today for the first time in a few years and felt disappointed when I left.  $39.00 for the 3 of us to get in with the coupons they had on line.  I just found it a lot smaller than I remember, did it not use to be sections 5 & 6 and this year it was only in section 5.  I think that you are right; it did used to be more than one section.  It also used to be run by a different group.  I think OFAH had a show there for many years.  They merged with the Toronto Sportsman Show and then someone else organized a new show in the same location and time slot as the cancelled show.  I cannot remember which year that was.  But I don't think the new show was ever as big as the old one."
958016,James77,2016-02-16 03:39:00,175,"I think it needs to be put into perspective. Just like you're paying to get in the retailers are paying for a booth. A small booth this year was $1200+tax, not to mention hotel and transportation that is a really heavy overhead for them. I went expecting a day of entertainment just thinking about the coming fishing season, looking at some trips, maybe buying a few lures. I understand if you were driving quite a distance to get there it might be a bit more frustrating but for me it was worth the $13. Seeing a movie is an hour or two of entertainment and can be upwards of $20.  It's nice to support the little guys once in a while too!"
958022,Duckie,2016-02-16 04:49:00,305,"don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the show. like I said, I got a new curado 200i PG which I can't wait to use.  one thing I loved was being able to play with all kinds of rods and reels that just aren't at any one retail location.  I especially loved the feel of the new G. Loomis E6X walleye rods. they are sweet.  but it was much smaller than the last time I was out (a few years ago) when Fishing World was there (I know Steve there) and other retailers.  JB's had the largest display (as they are very close to the hall) and I ended up buying the curado from them. no one else seemed to have the PG (5.5:1) power version I was looking for. everyone had the faster gear ratio models."
958023,chris.brock,2016-02-16 05:33:00,4053,"By the time the work week is done and the weekend rolls around, crowds are the last thing I want.  So I went fishing."
958027,bobowski,2016-02-16 11:31:00,360,I was there yesterday and I agree that there wasn't too many deals to be had but there was a lot of fishing knowledge to be had if you were willing to chat with many of the great fishing minds that were there.
958030,Garnet,2016-02-16 11:58:00,2056,I worked Redwing Tackle booth. Good crowd lot's of people to talk to. Not one moron.  Biggest eye opener check the price of Yamamoto. I'm having a sale.
958034,north560,2016-02-16 14:42:00,38,"Missed this show, hoping to go to the Spring fishing and Boat show in March. Maybe nicer weather will bring out more people."
958043,Garnet,2016-02-16 17:48:00,2056,You Yammamotto freaks better hot foot it out to East Hills only $10 a bag.
958046,FloatnFly,2016-02-16 17:59:00,1640,"Missed this show, hoping to go to the Spring fishing and Boat show in March. Maybe nicer weather will bring out more people.   Thats the Toronto Sportsman Show"
958052,SuperDave,2016-02-16 18:52:00,204,"It may be the same thing every year, but my soft water fishing fever is at its peak so going to the show is mental therapy for me. The Muskie Sunday is well run and I bid on a new Tranx that will grace my boat this season. I enjoy talking to some of the muskie nuts I know."
958060,Sinker,2016-02-16 19:35:00,8692, Ding ding....we have a winner!  I fished all weekend in freezing temps happily with not a soul in sight.  S.
958065,Pigeontroller,2016-02-16 20:27:00,2793,Sitting on the ice dangling a line through a hole isn't my idea of fishing...
958070,BucktownAngler,2016-02-16 20:52:00,582,"doesnt help that the price on pretty much everything has increased.  so not only were there no deals, but everything was like 25% more expensive   the musky show/auction was good though"
958071,jedimaster,2016-02-16 21:03:00,3472,Well just between you and me the prices here in canada after the conversion on alot of stuff s actually cheaper than buying south of the border. Alot of americans are buying from canada right now.
958073,Pigeontroller,2016-02-16 21:10:00,2793,"doesnt help that the price on pretty much everything has increased.  so not only were there no deals, but everything was like 25% more expensive   the musky show/auction was good though  That's yer low Canadian dollar...Some stuff is old stock and all the new stuff from the US is way more expensive."
958076,Shloim,2016-02-16 21:24:00,515,"Ok so maybe you guys are right on the entertainment aspect, and the supporting of small business guys is also a draw for me... I have a connection on gear so maybe I'm biased that way. Or maybe its just that Im cheap!  Ill consider going next year... Good thread though"
958084,Sinker,2016-02-16 21:58:00,8692,"Me neither.  Ice fishing to me is spending time outdoors with family and friends, enjoying the scenery, and catching a few fish.  My weekends off certainly arent going to be spent cooped up in the city, inside, with a few thousand other people. Thats more like torture to me. Id rather freeze my balls off and get skunked where i was anytime.  S."
958091,Garnet,2016-02-16 22:23:00,2056,Have fun with those $13 senkos.
957733,Shloim,2016-02-14 13:20:00,515,I went last year and felt like i just paid to go shopping. If it wasnt for my Abu hat that i scored id have felt ripped off! Thoughts folks?
957741,Fisherman,2016-02-14 13:53:00,7201,"I've been saying that for years, long time ago there were ""deals"", no more."
957753,Ron,2016-02-14 14:52:00,1683,Pretty cheap for a days entertainment in my opinion.
957754,Shloim,2016-02-14 14:55:00,515,Well it depends how many people ur buying tickets for.
957755,206,2016-02-14 14:57:00,563,If your just shopping it aint worth it....if you wanna spend a day chatting it up with some of the most knowledgeable people in the area don't miss out.
957756,huzzsaba,2016-02-14 15:01:00,884,I'm going to check out RV show.  Not buying anything tho
957758,Acountdeleted,2016-02-14 15:06:00,2562," For those that have no patience (like myself) it's nice to see the new stuff. I'm actually jealous of my buddy that he already has some of the new live target stuff.  There are deals but you have to find em. Best deals are the independant operators, Mike's handlebar lures are great as well as Meegz and the place that sells pepperettes. That's why I go. Anything else is a bonus."
957765,Garnet,2016-02-14 15:39:00,2056,If you go to have a bad time you will have a bad time.  I like talking to everybody some you help some help me.  The twit brains I send them to somebody else.
957863,Pigeontroller,2016-02-15 00:45:00,2793,I seldom see one person I know at BPS. Today at the Fish'n show I saw at least 100 people I know.
957877,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-15 01:22:00,937,At least you didn't have to pay for parking at this years event.  This year I was happy to get a free Daiwa T-Shirt
957884,Loonietoon,2016-02-15 02:23:00,1450,You have never had to pay to park at the Spring Fishing & Boat Show... The Sportsman Show is the one you are thinking of.. That is WHY they have now moved to the International Center and the have also signed a long term contract there as well for the Spring Breaks
957886,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-15 02:34:00,937,You're right.  I'll be attending that one as well.
957891,landry,2016-02-15 03:11:00,1005,I thought the show was pretty lame. It was -25 otherwise I don't think I would've gone.
957894,Freshtrax,2016-02-15 03:39:00,2215,"Pretty weak,  full on retail.   Nice way to kill a few hours but not worth the drive from Kitchener."
957896,Duckie,2016-02-15 03:49:00,305,"I went with my Dad and his buddy. Compared to a few years ago there was far less retailers there.  eg. no le baron, no fishing world, no Sail, no Gagnon sports etc.  we still enjoyed it even though it was mostly boating displays and the cottage stuff.  I ended up getting a Curado 200i PG from JB's Fishing Depot display for my Loomis E6X 843c Mag Bass that Santa brought me.  it wasn't on sale but i was happy none the less.  Dad bought a fenwick methods travel rod (no tax) and his buddy bought a fenwick fly rod.  so none of us went home empty handed. not a bad way to spend a morning, even if there is less fishing retail displays and less deals to be had."
957929,Pigeontroller,2016-02-15 15:00:00,2793,"Le Baron, Fishing World, Gagnons haven't been there in years! And Sail never has.  Every year some starts a thread and there's whining about the fishing show. Next year just don't go!"
957939,landry,2016-02-15 16:04:00,1005,You are correct. I won't. Lol. Cause it sucks. I hope I remember this a year from now.
957973,wkrp,2016-02-15 20:11:00,656,I spent a very enjoyable 2 hours there today.
957974,misfish,2016-02-15 20:41:00,29133,"Le Baron, Fishing World, Gagnons haven't been there in years! And Sail never has.  Every year some starts a thread and there's whining about the fishing show. Next year just don't go!   Yes Sail has not been, but the others have been for years. I mean many years. Theres a reason they dont have booths anymore. They dont need to. They have the loyal customers and have great sales through out the year. I remember walking in the front of the shows and seeing Le Barons, right there front and center. Thier magazine with special flyers and a few free baits in a bag to try.  Im not bashing you here , just voicing  my opinion. These shows need creation. I know it,s not like it was bac then, but ya, for the kids, it,s a great day out."
957984,fishdawg,2016-02-15 22:26:00,912,"if your cheap and want deals stay in your PJs and check out Ebay  always a fun time out regardless when I go, which isnt every year"
957985,Fisherman,2016-02-15 22:30:00,7201, Every year some starts a thread and there's whining about the fishing show. Next year just don't go!  Well I guess than voicing an opinion isn't allowed according to you.
957986,jedimaster,2016-02-15 22:39:00,3472,"I dunno I took my kids today and they had a great time with the fish pond and climbin wall, I got a great deal on a couple cumulus rods and bumped into a few guys. I enjoyed my time."
957997,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-16 00:45:00,937,^^^ I believe I was looking at the rods when you were picking out yours.  Too bad they didn't have any medium/heavys.
957998,John Bacon,2016-02-16 00:47:00,3277," eg. no le baron, no fishing world, no Sail, no Gagnon sports etc.   LeBaron is listed for the Toronto Sportsman Show in March.  I don't see any of the others from your list though."
958006,Paudash,2016-02-16 02:03:00,273,"I went today for the first time in a few years and felt disappointed when I left.  $39.00 for the 3 of us to get in with the coupons they had on line.
