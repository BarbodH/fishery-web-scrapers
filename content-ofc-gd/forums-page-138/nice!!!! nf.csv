957725,Big Cliff,2016-02-14 11:26:00,6899,I've broken a few toes over the years but never had that much swelling or discoloration. Man that looks like it's painful! So did you wake up everyone in the house?
957750,Joey,2016-02-14 14:29:00,9122,"Oh man that looks painful.  Hope you enjoy your time off and the pain isn't too bad.  Now remember, drinking and painkillers makes people silly and they could walk into another doorframe"
957803,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-14 19:35:00,8243,"Looks like gangrene has set in there. Better amputate, then check the colour think on your camera."
957806,manitoubass2,2016-02-14 19:52:00,11391,"My camera is getting pooched, takes picture in some weird red or blue hues.  Starting to do it more and more.  Time to use the warrantee me thinks"
957908,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-15 10:06:00,8243,"Without anymore Bull how is that foot today?  OK more Bull, your foot model days are over. Man that is one ugly foot. I guess pedicures aren't big up there for guys. It looks like the before picture for toe fungus cream. Actually is that you on those commercials, maybe your career isn't done??? You can be the after guy in the metatarsal safety boot ad."

957645,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-13 21:06:00,8243,"The future Darwin Award winner? No you have a entire showcase full of them. No door handles eh. Maybe you just wanted time off to help breast feed the baby.  In Coach Ditka's voice "" COME ON MAN"".  OK I am also a previous recipient of the award in the category of what not to kick. When I ripping the old pine strip flooring out here to get to the joists to change I'm using the old flooring as fire starter for the wood stove. I don't bother to cut them small enough to fit I just decide lay it on an angle against the wood stove and come down and break it with ball of my foot. It's early I'm groggy and the miss the ball of my foot and come down square on the front of my arch. Has anyone ever seen the pointy end of a 45 year old rusty nail looking at them coming out of the arch of the foot, your own fit. Think that hurt? I can't drive to the hospital with a 28"" piece of pine stuck to the bottom of their foot. Frank says I'll drive you or you pull it out and drive yourself. Laugh, laugh, chuckle chuckle. He went next door to tell my neighbours to come over because Stupid did something else to himself. I swear he went out on Lakeshore drive stopping joggers and pulling people over to "" Ya gotta see this"".  Yea Rick, I feel for you. It hurts, hurts big time."
957647,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-13 21:08:00,8243,"Yep, it's broken. I don't need to tell you to ice, elevate, compress and stay off it until you can bear the weight. What did the Shamon say? No cast? Walking cast for sure, no?"
957648,manitoubass2,2016-02-13 21:09:00,11391,Lol 2 years ago i put a nail straight throught the same foot hahaha  Searching for a golf ball of all things.  Didnt hurt too bad though but it sure looked gross. Missed all the bones and went straight through.
957649,manitoubass2,2016-02-13 21:10:00,11391,"Yep, walking cast. Cant get it till tuesday however so im stuck with the pain for now"
957652,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-13 21:18:00,8243,"So tell me why it's not on? Do you only need it to walk, which won't be too soon."
957653,manitoubass2,2016-02-13 21:24:00,11391, Just got xrays and sent on my way.  Nurse practioner gave me t3's and said come back tuesday morning.  I could have it done in fort but that hospital is horrible. Id rather lay down and deal with the pain then be in emerge for 15 hours  I got a soft cast for now.
957659,aplumma,2016-02-13 22:20:00,6896,You got an ugly foot......just saying....lol  Art
957662,huzzsaba,2016-02-13 22:51:00,884,Is your foot really that blue from the injury or is the camera playing games?  Wow never seen something like that.  Hope that heals soon!
957667,GBW,2016-02-13 23:24:00,8460,"so you weren't kidding when I got that msg. at all, that is bad."
957682,FloatnFly,2016-02-14 00:15:00,1640,ouch.........
957692,manitoubass2,2016-02-14 01:13:00,11391,Yeah its that blue but my camera used some weird greyscale or something that makes my foot look a lil zombie ish lol
957693,manitoubass2,2016-02-14 01:14:00,11391,"Years of bush hiking, doesnt do wonders for your feet ?"
957694,esoxansteel,2016-02-14 01:14:00,1307,Yikes you must of been in a hurry to break toes and foot man
957695,mr blizzard,2016-02-14 01:14:00,1589," your hair looks like the tree line up here, trees on one side and nothing but snow on the other call ya bigfoot from now one lol how the heck can u walk into the frame"
957697,manitoubass2,2016-02-14 01:15:00,11391,"No, the doorframe is just pretty solid.  It doesnt move man!"
957698,Cast-Away,2016-02-14 01:15:00,790,Personally I think your foot looks swell!!!
957704,manitoubass2,2016-02-14 01:44:00,11391,???
957711,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-14 03:27:00,8243,"See the DR. Tuesday???!!!! I guess one can't die up there from an embolism caused due to blood pouring out of a broken bone or bones. Please keep it on ice and elevated and stay off it. It's no joke Rick, no time to be a tough guy. I'm surprised they didn't prescribe Warfarin temporarily at least. More than one person has died before they could get out of the bush and the break was set. I don't need to scare you I know you are familiar with the routine."
