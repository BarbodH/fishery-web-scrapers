If you are feeling up to a beautiful but long drive from there head to Cape d'Or for some amazing scenic views  & then up to Joggins for some fossil collecting (ya ya the main beach you aren't suppose to take from) but a 5 min walk west will put you in some great out of the way fossil hunting territory.  If you really dig fossil hunting I have a great spot on the Cape but it's a trek getting to. Any trip out east wouldn't be complete with out a stop at Willams Meats for the XXX hot pepperettes just out country side from Stewiacke. If you dig whisky then a stop at Glenora Disillery on the Cape is a must, absolutely stunning local. There is far to many things to name to do on the Cape but most require hiking inland. Someone else has mentioned Port Royal, interesting place for it's history, Halifax is a great little city & one of the best Blues Bars is called Bearly's on Barrington street, rock'n good time to be had there. My uncle is a regular at the Dutchman's. I receive some nice shipments of Dragon's Breath and Growler every year."

I've gotta lots of info from a friend who drives down there every other year. He said the best way is to drive 12 hrs or so to Edmunston NB and stay for the night. Then drive the rest of the way the next day.  We are renting a cottage in Anapolos Royal on the Minas basin.  Lots to see around there. Port Royal is the oldest settlement in Canada and has over 150 historic buildings to see. Plus the fort there.  Leuninberg is a nice town to see as well. Lots of small shops and the Bluenose II is docked there.  Blue beach is apparently pretty neat. You can walk around and pick up/find fossils everywhere.  Halifax is a beautiful city to tour.
