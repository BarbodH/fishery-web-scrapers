I figure with TRU being 5 minutes away from my office it makes sense to pick up minnows today and just head straight out tomorrow.  My big thing is, will shiners survive 24 hours in just a bag of water? If no, is there anything I can do to keep them alive longer? It would save me a lot of time tomorrow."

Do you have a minnow pail or something that could serve as 1? Dump them in there with some fresh water and they'll be OK."
957181,chris.brock,2016-02-11 14:48:00,4053,"Keep them cool. Buy an aerator, then you will have it for the next time you get minnies."
957182,Fang,2016-02-11 14:56:00,1330,The bait places I use have Oxygen tanks and can give the bag a good shot before sealing. We buy 2-3 bags for weekend trips each with enough minnows for a days fishing and open 1 each day. Keep the other bags unopened and sealed. Important to stay cold but not freezing and they'll be good for a couple days.
957186,cheaptackle,2016-02-11 15:10:00,849,"In the past I've kept them in the fridge for better than a week at a time, in a minnow bucket.  Toss in an ice cube once in a while (daily) - as it melts (slowly) it adds oxygen.  I live alone so no screaming about it ha ha!  Michael"
957190,BillM,2016-02-11 15:50:00,17367,"Leave the bag sealed and in the fridge until you get out on the ice, they'll be fine."
957192,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-11 16:14:00,8243,Buy them from a bait shop that can give them 02 and keep them cool. I have had them stay alive in the bag for at least 16 hours.
957209,Dutch01,2016-02-11 16:49:00,1431,This - I do it all the time.
957222,Acountdeleted,2016-02-11 17:36:00,2562,This is really great info everyone. Thanks!  This saves me about 2 hours tomorrow.
957232,BITEME,2016-02-11 18:23:00,1968,ice cubes and an areator
957243,davey buoy,2016-02-11 20:26:00,5505,"Not sure where or what you are fishing for,for me dead ones work just as well.just sayin"
957245,manitoubass2,2016-02-11 21:00:00,11391,Yep keep it sealed and cool.  Easily last 5 days in the fridge if not more.  Done it lots  Frozen shiners are the cats meow for ice fishing though. Ill take em over live bait anyday and its like 4 bucks for 2 dozen
957259,Acountdeleted,2016-02-11 22:26:00,2562,I don't usually do well ice fishing. I can use all the help I can get.
957271,misfish,2016-02-11 23:48:00,29133,"Buy them from a bait shop that can give them 02 and keep them cool. I have had them stay alive in the bag for at least 16 hours.   And here is another tip. You will have them in your car for the ride. Temp in the water will rise. DO NOT  get to your fishing spot and just open the bag and dump them in a pail. Auger a hole and put the bag in the hole for about 15 minutes. This will slowly bring the water back to a cold temp, the minnows will stay alive without being shocked ."
957272,BillM,2016-02-12 00:04:00,17367,"Brian, they should be in the bed of your truck for the ride  :)"
