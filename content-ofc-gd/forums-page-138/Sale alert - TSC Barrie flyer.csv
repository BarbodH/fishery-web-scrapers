The Barrie location carried Titans last season, I'd imagine they still do. I know myself and many, many others love them Just passing along a deal, nothing more. Tight lines"

957292,adempsey,2016-02-12 01:58:00,1498,I just bought some Baffins during the Black Friday sale too =\.  I think they were only 20% off.   Awesome boots for around $100.  I have two pairs now.
