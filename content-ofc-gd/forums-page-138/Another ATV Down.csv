957515,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-13 00:54:00,8243,But drinking and driving is idiotic and stupid. That you can't argue that someone that does that isn't.
957521,landry,2016-02-13 01:13:00,1005,Well - you are entitled to embarrass yourself then. Making a mistake does not make someone stupid. Everybody makes them - some people get lucky and a few get punished severely.

957558,SirCranksalot,2016-02-13 03:19:00,3291,"This was posted on another site:  ""George Snake is the man who drowned. He broke through thin ice and he was approximately 300 meters from the ferry channel.  He was a lifelong resident of Georgina Island and was aware of the ferry channel."""
957560,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-13 03:30:00,8243,"Drinking and driving continually is a conscious decision not a simple mistake. If someone makes a mistake once or twice and drinks and drives, OK a bad mistake and we pray no one is injured. Drive to a bar, a party, a game or anywhere and that person knows they will be drinking more than 3 in 4 hours and knows they drive home drunk that person is idiotic and stupid. Sorry off topic but I am big on not driving drunk."
957562,Woodsman,2016-02-13 03:49:00,1286, Yes but that area was open water only a couple days before. Tragic but he got turned arround in a storm at night & ventured too close to the ferry channel. This area was effected by the ferry route. RIP George.
957341,cheaptackle,2016-02-12 12:21:00,849,Let's be safe out there folks!  According to City news a 60 year old man on an ATV out from Virginia Beach went thru the ice.  Body was recovered by police last night.  I'd post a link but it's time for a new computer I guess...  Michael

I was out here on the lake the other day, there have been sleds and ATVs running back and forth for two weeks now and there was a good solid 6-8+"" of ice even over the chanel in front of our place. I took a little ride to where there were some guys were fishing huts and all. When I stopped to talk with them and asked how thick the ice was I was told a good 5"" where I was but only about 2"" less than 50' away. I followed my tracks right back to shore and parked the bike."
957361,mukluk,2016-02-12 14:50:00,196,From what I'm hearing on another board is the victim was a resident of  Georgina Island and got disoriented in the snow squalls and drove his atv into the open water channel of the ferry crossing .

957406,fishrking,2016-02-12 18:23:00,24,"CORRECT!  It's like guys are just waiting for an opportunity to call someone an idiot for taking a machine on the ice.  Before your next knee jerk reaction post READ THE NEWS REPORT! Not just the headlines.  Seeing these ""when are guys gonna learn"" comments all over the place for this horrible accident.  The victim got lost/disoriented and steered his machine too close to the ferry channel.  End of story."
957413,mbac31,2016-02-12 19:06:00,904,"sorry but this usually is gods way of weeding out the stupid people. when will people learn, same as the guys who buy a fast bike with no elmet in the us. Stupid,stupid,stupid, sad shame."
957414,Joeytier,2016-02-12 19:12:00,3990,Is that what you're going to say when it's a family member or a close friend?
957418,mbac31,2016-02-12 19:32:00,904,"I have had three close friends drown the same way. One has been missing since 1998 and they have never found his body. I myself broke through before, my own dam fault. I got careless, almost drowned. I should have known better. There are accidents, but to go out on the ice right now racing around on a sled with the temps being the way they have been is foolish. like I said in the post, sad but stupid all the same. His family has to endure a loss of life right now cause someone could not bother to take the proper precautions. Every year, same crap over and over again."

Well then according to your theory you have some pretty dumb friends and you aren't too smart yourself!  This guy wasn't out there ""racing around just for the heck of it"", he got disoriented in a snow squal, (been there, you think you are going one way and it just isn't so).  I could have gone through the ice here the other day yet I went where sleds and bikes have been going for two weeks now, just plain luck that I missed the one area where the ice wasn't fully formed but anyone following my tracks and going just 50' off to the side could have been in trouble.  None of these people go out there thinking they are going to get into trouble but sometimes bad things happen to good people through no fault of their own. My heart goes out to the ones that are left behind."

I broke through cause some asshat moved his hut and left the hole open, still my fault as I was to eager to get out there and never kept an eye on the ice,so correct, I wasn't to smart,  weather channel and news are everywhere. Most guys go through by themselves.  people have their opinion, this is an open forum and I have mine. I still stick to it."

Stop and think first. God rest his soul but he was an idiot for making that decision.  I had another friend who lost his life here that was a board member a few years ago in Hamilton in a Kayak, great guy, who the hell goes out in fridgid waters in a Kayak. Your asking for trouble. Miss him dearly and was just going through stuff that he gave me to fish with, but he was an idiot for chosing to do what he did."

He got disoriented in a snow squall and ended up in the open (or just skimmed over)  Ferry channel.  To call him an idiot is pretty ignorant. People have been driving vehicles across to the island and machines have been running all over that ice for 3 weeks now. I have been out there myself on my machine. The ice is plenty safe IN THAT AREA.  I feel sorry for his family and friends.  S.

957452,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-12 21:52:00,8243,"My deepest condolences to the family. To call anyone, alive or deceased an idiot or stupid doesn't have a grasp of the English language. There are phrases like "" a poor decision, unwise choice, ill informed, made an unfortunate decision etc."" But a stupid idiot, no.  This man was no kid at 60, he lived there so I am going to guess he was experienced. I have found lately as I get older my friends are also older. Some make poor decisions now that they wouldn't 10 or 15 years ago and it surprises me. In my opinion it is the ""I've been doing this for 40 years and never got hurt"" so I will be safe reason. That is as dangerous as a impetuous teen or 20 something doing crazy things because they are invincible. An example of senior ""stupidity"" is drinking and driving at 75 years old because it was nothing years ago now it's a big deal to everyone. I hear that from some older guys, 60 and up. I guess stupid can be used, I change my mind. Drinking and driving is stupid."
