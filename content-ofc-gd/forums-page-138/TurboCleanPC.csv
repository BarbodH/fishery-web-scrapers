I figure if it sounds too good to be true it probably is but I know that you guys will know the answer. Is it worth downloading or is there a catch?"
957062,Fisherman,2016-02-10 17:13:00,7201,"There's always a catch in there soomewhere.  I tried one of them once, had a beatch of a time trying to get rid of the add ons, changed my home page, etc."

I figure if it sounds too good to be true it probably is but I know that you guys will know the answer. Is it worth downloading or is there a catch? There are plenty of legit freeware programs out there that can do the same things as what some of these programs claim to do. CCleaner is a good one that comes to mind. As posted, MalwareBytes AntiMalware (MBAM)is an excellent tool. With the right version you can get active monitoring as well. It even has a chameleon ""mode"" to fool some malware from targeting it. But I digress... Best practice for sure is prevention in the first place by using adequate antivirus/spyware/adblocker etc (malware) programs. All mine is freeware. Just make sure not to run two antivirus programs at the same time. Firefox has some great extensions that I really like too  Here is the best advice I can offer to most any home user to further protect your computer. Most  home user accounts have admin privileges, which allows your account to do anything practically. This also allows malware access to your whole system to install programs or whatever once it has accessed your account. What we all should do is be signed on with a Standard User Account, which has limited privileges to install/run programs without an admin password, which you can supply when asked for things you want to use. It's free,   simple and effective protection. You can still sign on as an Admin if needed.  Cheers"

This thing is running fine, just saw all their hype and thought I'd ask. I have used Malwarebytes in the past based on the recomendation from Terry , did a fantastic job!  Oh, and as for the porn thing; I don't need to watch it, I got Sue!"
