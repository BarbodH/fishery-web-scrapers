957938,F7Firecat,2016-02-15 16:01:00,347,I am headed to Timmins on March break for a Provincial Ringette Tournament.  I will be dragging my son along and wish to possibly take him ice fishing.  Does anyone have any recommendations as far as outfitters in that area that could offer us a hut?  I don't care what we fish for just looking to get out for an afternoon or two.  Thanks  Bryan
