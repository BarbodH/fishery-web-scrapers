955755,manitoubass2,2016-02-02 07:13:00,11391,Geez!  Maybe they should try further out that 10ft from shore????  Epic extension
955775,4x4bassin,2016-02-02 16:07:00,1025,From what I'm seeing and hearing winter is not quite over yet so hold out some hope everyone . Starting next week the forecasts are showing a plunge of cold arctic air coming into the Ontario region with possible double digit minus temps. as highs later in the week  and going into the family day long weekend . Along with these cold temps. the Georgian Bay snow belts  will receive some significant lake effect snow . Lets see and hope for all you outfitters out there !
955778,Dara,2016-02-02 16:35:00,3052,I don't need double digit minuses for family day weekend...we have a 400 miles sledding trip planned for then and the last 2 years it was 30 below...I would like something around 5 to 9 below this year
955779,AKRISONER,2016-02-02 17:02:00,5558,"Well as far as bogus years go for winter, We fluked out at my families household.  My parents pulled the trigger this past summer and decided to do a big rebuild on the family cottage starting in September running through the entire ""winter"" I was expecting a long winter of crying as the trails would be open and ice fishing would be going on and Id be stuck with no cottage or sleds to ride. I got an update from the local marina yesterday and the channel 500 meters from regular ice fishing spot is rotting out and opening up. The snowmobile trails aren't open and guys just got on the ice with the sleds 2 weeks ago which is ridiculous considering ive ridden on december 10th on the ice.  I guess we picked the perfect year to have no use of our winter playland, however the way things are going maybe this is just a precursor to the new norm..which is disturbing to say the least."
955789,terry71,2016-02-02 19:36:00,21,"Hey Mitch,  May I ask what news you heard Dave Phillips on? I would like to hear his breakdown.  Thanks,  Terry"
955795,Joeytier,2016-02-02 21:10:00,3990,"Lots of snow and ice here, nice to have a break from the brutal cold of last year but still be able to enjoy winter.  Lakes are well behind schedule for ice but very sleddable and we've got about 3.5 feet of snow now."
955822,can u fish,2016-02-02 23:34:00,326,Hi  Terry it was on the CTV news for the North yesterday at noon.
956785,4x4bassin,2016-02-08 21:35:00,1025,Things are looking the same for this week and upcoming family day weekend when it comes to winter weather . Coldest air of the season is set to move into Ontario at the end of the week with the coldest day to be Saturday. Along with this cold plunge of arctic air there will be more then likely some moderate accumulation of snow in the Georgian Bay/Huron snow belts . Reports of -25 C to -30C are being forecasted for Saturday in central Ontario . This will I'm sure help with the ice on the lakes but might be a little to late . Be safe out there everyone .
956788,4x4bassin,2016-02-08 21:38:00,1025,"I don't need double digit minuses for family day weekend...we have a 400 miles sledding trip planned for then and the last 2 years it was 30 below...I would like something around 5 to 9 below this year Sorry Dara , it's looking like a frigid ride for you guys ."
956795,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-08 22:10:00,10439,We don't have that Family Day thing here in the NWT. We do have a different day at a warmer better time of year though. We have Aboriginal Day on June 21st instead.
956822,Dara,2016-02-09 02:37:00,3052,"Sorry Dara , it's looking like a frigid ride for you guys .   Yup, great. Oh well, nobody booked a room anyway so it may be cancelled...just day trips instead. Did another hundred miles this weekend so I have just about 1,000 so far this year"
956839,fishindevil,2016-02-09 09:31:00,6254,"There is lots of winter left you just have to drive to it !!!..... Head north .... Going on a 5 day snowmobile trip in a few days to cochrane & beyond probly do between 1,500km and 1,800km on my sled !!!! ?✌️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️"
956848,Dara,2016-02-09 13:11:00,3052,I take it you don't ride bar to bar up there eh

Talk about annoying, especially because I just switched over to my all seasons as I picked up a shard of metal on Friday sometime, so need to get that patched up asap"
956904,Joeytier,2016-02-09 19:33:00,3990,It hasn't stopped snowing here since Saturday evening.  Its a beeyootiful sight to have my driveway snowbank way over my head again
956915,Sinker,2016-02-09 20:20:00,8692,I'm not jealous.....my new sled sitting in the garage and my green grass almost needing cut.....   I hate you. LOL  S.
956917,ccmtcanada,2016-02-09 20:24:00,7971,We were supposed to get 5cm from last night til tonight.  What fell last night has melted and there's nothing on the ground here in Whitby.
957002,John Bacon,2016-02-10 03:24:00,3277,-18 on Saturday.  Winter is not quire over yet.
957007,ccmtcanada,2016-02-10 03:42:00,7971,"They are saying this weekend is likely our last cold snap.  Back up to + temps the next week then the winter pattern starts to break apart and warmer weather arrives.  But, since that's what they forecast, it'll be wrong.  Haha."
957013,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-10 04:37:00,8243,"I am empathetic Can U as cold means cash to you. But winter can't end soon enough for me. My DNA is embedded in a region of this planet where Palm trees are everywhere. I'm no longer built for cold days and colder nights. I don't know where my shovel is and I'm just happy to leave it wherever it is. Go north if it's cold you want, there's enough there for you all but leave us southerners be, please."
957088,bigbuck,2016-02-10 21:07:00,2449,"Horrendous lack of cold for those up north operating businesses that require cold and snow. Spoke to a buddy who sells Bombardier products up north and he said it was a lousy winter for sales. Mitch, I cannot imagine hiw it is for you where you need the winter business. Hopefulky we have a nice summer and with the crappy loonie, lots of Americans will come up for cheap to them vacations."
957170,Dara,2016-02-11 13:39:00,3052,Winter is just fine up here. I'm taking an extra day off and hitting the trails for 4 days this weekend and then next weekend we are doing an overnight ride to Elliott lake. I know its not fishing but it is winter fun anyway
955676,can u fish,2016-02-01 20:13:00,326,Well it has been 11 years since my wife and I have been in the Cottage Resort business and have never experienced a winter like this ice conditions have been so bad all winter I have not been able to get any of the ice huts out and to go along with that none of our snowmobile trails have opened here in District 10 in our area of the pssd and after hearing Dave Phillips from Environment Canada on the news this afternoon saying that the worst of winter may be behind us I have decided to write this winter off as the saying goes it is what it is and that is my rant for the day.  Cheers Mitch
955677,cheaptackle,2016-02-01 20:27:00,849,"Might be pulling the trigger a tad early, I'd give it another week or two, it's been a weird winter for sure and who's to say it won't get weirder (read fiercer!).  Hope it gets better soon for you, there's still time...  Michael"
955700,irishfield,2016-02-01 22:43:00,26272,"Lake Trout doesn't even open until Feb 15th in 11, but not sure that even Lake Temagami will be sleddible (if that's a word) by then. Currently snow covered, ice crust, then 12"" of water under that and then about 8"" of ice in the NE Arm. The South Arm apparently only has 2"" of ice. It was open water back on January 12th! Glad we moved our boys trip out about 10 days from normal."
955701,captpierre,2016-02-01 22:51:00,2521,Drove to the cottage today near Buckhorn. Quite a few huts out on Scugog Gannon Narrows channel open as far as you can see. Water levels low on Pigeon and ice looks soft.
