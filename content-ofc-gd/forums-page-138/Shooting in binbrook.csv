The way I see it is if he wasn't out there trying to steal somebody elses vehicle the whole situation never would have happened. Back when I had to report my truck stolen I was told that even if the police were to catch this certain group of auto thieves in the act upon fleeing they will not be persued because they are known to carry weapons and wont hesitate to endanger innocent lives in a high speed chase.

Hit me once, OK, Hit me again, OK, after 3 times not OK, after 5 times your whole out look will change your behaviour. Sorry, but it's human and animal nature. You poke a dog with a stick and think it's funny, NOT As some have stated, could you still pull the trigger, I don't think I'd have the balls,  I think the victim will have some sleepless nights.

956460,miami,2016-02-06 16:20:00,29,"I know were dealing with a attempted truck theft and the thief lost his life. So too has the shooter. It's basically over for him for the next decade or longer. He most likely loose his house, his job, his good name, his credit rating and god knows what else. Within a split section a decision to shoot and possibly take a life has taken his.  A few years ago my wife and I were awakened by a pounding on our side door. I got up and demanded to know what the person wanted. Just as the words were coming out of my mouth, he starts pushing in on the door - I yelled for my wife to dial 911. He must of heard that but a minute later he's now at our sliding door off the deck. I grabbed a knife and was prepared - this guy was intent on getting in - and I was scared. My neighbor across the street woke up hearing the pounding and the screaming. He appeared with rifle in hand and the guy took off dropping his phone on the road. (During the 1st door and the slider, the operator was online with my wife. She could hear the noise and the yelling.) The OPP arrived 40 minutes later and the officer looked disinterested. Since it was snowing he said ""no need it's a waste of time fingerprinting""............huh. He grabbed the cell phone and left. (Our house is 20 minutes from the main OPP headquarters in Orillia.) I lost a lot of faith that night - not just in the officer that arrived, but the whole department."

A bat or casserol dish might be a good choice if you are young and fit, I'm still in pretty good shape for my age. I was trained in unarmed combat, I was pretty good.

You will have a new truck on your driveway the next day so you can get right to work?  Poor guy protecting his property went to far. Should have dialed 911 and then gone out.

You never get back what they take, and your insurance penalizes you. I don't have any sympathy, sorry. One more Parasite gone.

Like many have said, I cannot say that him completely sniping the intruder without warning is called for, theres a very very fine line, but i personally feel that if you approach the situation, make clear your intentions by stating, back the eff off or i will shoot you...and the guy proceeds to continue to steal your vehicle or makes an aggressive move towards you, he would get dropped then and there.  Here we go on the old gun debate...its 3am, how does buddy know that the thief isn't armed? Is he supposed to wait till the scumbag who has nothing to lose shoots at him first? Once again, this isn't a situation where the shooter was out carrying a gun around and came across this scenario. he is at home in the middle of the night and some scumbag shows up at his house to do god knows what.   I personally think the amount of legal crap that the shooter is going to have to deal with is enough punishment, maybe probation etc. But does this guy really deserve to be behind bars for being thrown into a terrible situation on his own property!?"

I've had my car broken into enough times but I would never entertain the thought of swinging a Louisville at the lowlifes because I can't determine what the outcome of a swing/swings will be.

You can't shoot and kill people that are stealing your property. Not in this country!"
956166,manitoubass2,2016-02-04 23:31:00,11391,"See my post above.  You are correct.  You have the right to defend your life, your families life on your property.  Although a vehicle is your property, its not posing an immediate threat.  As much as I dislike thieves, the property owner is not judge, jury and executioner.  His charge is justifiable imo"
956173,leaf4,2016-02-05 00:05:00,2466,"This one sheds a bit more light, apparently there was an altercation, and its just who you think it'd be, sorry to say.  https://hamiltonpolice.on.ca/community/news/2016/02/news-release-homicide-detectives-charge-binbrook-man-second-degree-murder  Its tough owning a truck out haldimand/Norfolk way, a buddies dad has had his 2006 Silverado stolen, replaced with a similar one, stolen again, replaced with another and then stolen and replaced with his current, the last one was kinda funny, he was golfing in the afternoon with a buddy off of hwy 6, end of the day comes and he goes to his truck, only its not there anymore. An older truck with a slot screwdriver is running beside where his used to be"

Call the cops.  A quick call to 911 advising that you are WATCHING someone steal your truck will have cops there before he gets on the road (right FfA?).  You can't shoot and kill people that are stealing your property. Not in this country!   Nope, totally agree with you Steve. There was no imminent threat to life so he should have called the cops, even if truck was long gone. Sorry but there are consequences for discharging a firearm and he's now looking at it. A very quick decision has affected two lives, and more, if he had family."

Funny how so many people are almost happy to see someone get killed for merely attempting to steal a vehicle."
956184,pics,2016-02-05 00:30:00,1268,"As soon as I found out it was an older chev I kinda had an idea of what happened.. this has been going on for as far back as I can remember.. it happened to me 20 years ago when my truck was stolen and found burned out on the edge of the reserve. The problem here is a big one but there is little political willpower to fix it. Like Tims wife Sharlene said "" it's just a truck "".. it isn't worth anyone dying for but when you are young your stuff can be very important to you.. now that I'm older I realize that my family is the most precious thing I have..  harm them and you will pay the ultimate price. What I don't get is why was he stealing a truck? This guy is a member of the styres family which is very wealthy !!"

956190,manitoubass2,2016-02-05 00:59:00,11391,This is truth.  Im all for gun rights but not above human lives
956205,porkpie,2016-02-05 02:10:00,2521,"You won't get any flack from this gun guy.  On the face of it, a simple call to the police would have been the right choice.  Yes it sucks to have your property stolen, but we have insurance for that.  It doesn't sound like this thief was breaking down the front door of the house with a rusty pickaxe screaming I'll kill you.  If that where the case it's a fair shoot in my mind, but I'm not killing anyone over my truck."
956207,G.mech,2016-02-05 02:13:00,830,This will go south in a hurry. The parallel to the Bosma case is poignant.  How in the world does this compare to the Bosma case?????  There are no similarities whatsoever other than a vehicle and body.

They deserve zero sympathy and whatever they get from any brave person who decides to go against the Canadian way and actually defend themselves and their property.  I sure hope there is a support page of some sort started for this man.   That said, the only thing the article says is ""The resident, Peter KHILL while armed with a firearm confronted the man. During the confrontation the man attempting to steal the truck died as a result of gunshot related injuries."". We haven't a clue if the guy ran out there shooting away or confronted the thief and demanded that he leave or be shot before the thief attacked him. After reading about the man I would assume he showed self control and was attacked by the thief and defended himself. Need more details..."
