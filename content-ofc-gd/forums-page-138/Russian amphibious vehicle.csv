957018,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-10 09:00:00,8243,If I take a Russian farm tractor and build a box on the back is it still a tractor or is it a 45 HP Ruskie SUV?  Does anyone realize the amount of Armour All it would take to shine those tires? I do NOT want one. Parts can't be had at Princess Auto or CTC. My pal that bought a farm close by got a great deal on a Serbian or Romanian or some Iron Curtain country built tractor. When we went to the local JD dealer for a water pump they could still be heard laughing while we drove away. I pass.
