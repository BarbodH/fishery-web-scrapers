957424,richyb,2016-02-12 20:18:00,774,My galaxy ace2 cell phones camera is pretty much pooched. Pics are always fuzzy now and ive got my koodo tab paid off. I was looking at some new phones and was showed the HTC one m8. Reg price over $400 on clearance for $180 if its going on my koodo tab ( like 7$ a month).  Im not a gamer I just use it for texting and taking pics. Will likely upgrade my plan to have some data but just so I can text pics to people.  Does anyone use one? Is it a decent phone ?  thanks.

Good phone, but my mic (or the noise cancelling mic) is messed up and the camera pics are all purple in low light on the other one.    It's over 2 years old though, but they should last longer.    I'd probably still get another HTC, but I would never ""pay extra"" for a phone.   I am due for an upgrade, but waiting for a decent ""free"" phone to re-commit."

957575,16 Footer,2016-02-13 13:30:00,191,Got a HTC 601 phone from Bell almost 2 years ago for $50 extra and it has been good. The picture quality and videos are great. Could use more than 8 gigabytes in it.

957670,richyb,2016-02-13 23:30:00,774,I picked up the phone today and Got everything transferred over. Will take some getting used to thats for sure. Had to get my wife to figure most of it out lol. She was actually impressed with some of the features that her I phone doesnt have.

957686,Shloim,2016-02-14 00:53:00,515,You csn google how to do or change just about everything. There's also lots of sites woth demos on the phone that show you cool stuff
