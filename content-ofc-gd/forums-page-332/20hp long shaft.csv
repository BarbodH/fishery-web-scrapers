765367,irishfield,2013-02-05 04:42:00,26272,There's a 25 Honda in the classifieds... needs the bottom end inspected and a piece of alum welded on for a skeg... $1200 or BO. If I had time it would be gone already..
765381,Tayzak15,2013-02-05 07:51:00,318,"Thanks for the quick reply! I'd would consider that one my only concern with it would be the weight of a 25hp 4 stroke. My boat is rated for a 20 max, but I'm not too sure how it would handle a 25. Another thing that would concern me is the repair cost. I've never had to repair a lower unit on a motor before any estimate how much it would cost?"
765454,Fisherman,2013-02-05 17:39:00,7201,"Just me but after looking at those photos, I'd be looking at having the whole inside lower end checked for damage."
765468,Tayzak15,2013-02-05 18:24:00,318,Yeah I don't think Il be buying that one. The 25hp 4 stroke might be a bit too much weight. If it were a 2 stroke I would consider it.
765478,porkpie,2013-02-05 19:18:00,2521,"That 25 in the classifieds looks like it has been rode hard and put away wet!  Buy yourself a compression test kit and have lots of patience!  You will definately find something, but it takes a bit of time!!  I have come across several excellent used motors, but it always takes a bit of time to find the right one.  One rule of thumb that I have found to be almost universally true is that if it looks beat, it probably is beat!"
