I have another question for you guys.  I want to take my father out on Monday for some lakers on Simcoe. We will be walking out with our hut. My question is..... where is the general area where everbody goes? I am not looking for ""your spot"" just a location where everybody parks and walks out from. I have never been before. I have read posts about by-law and parking issues. I would like to make this a stress free as possible. I would be coming from hwy 400. I assume the location you send me to has ""safe ice"" LOL  If anybody wants to meet up with my father and I feel free to pm me. I always enjoy meeting new people. Thanks for all your help in the past and in advance.  Duxbware."
