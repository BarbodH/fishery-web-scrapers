765355,Freshtrax,2013-02-05 03:32:00,2215,"I've really struggled this season so far on simcoe. I have put in 5 days of hard fishing and not a decent fish to show for it.  I've bin all over my usual early ice haunts with no success.  Il be out next week for another three days and I'm comfotably gonna bring the snow machine on the main lake basin to hit some main lake basin waypoints.  Straight of BBP rd.   6 inches as far as the eye can see, (and your willing to walk) the shorelines busted up.  Mapleview rd.  6-8 inches.   All the way to the islands.   LOTS of cracks be carefull on quads"
765358,dhickey,2013-02-05 03:42:00,1038,Yep keep your head up.  But this weekend should be ok for hard ice.  Look out for presure craks. they dont seem to be in the usual places??  Don.
