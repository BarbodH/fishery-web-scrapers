764618,Christopheraaron,2013-02-02 16:22:00,3525,"I've been trying to use my Piranhamax 160 as an ice sonar this winter but whenever I have it out in the cold for extended periods of time it says that the transducer isn't connected. I can manage without a sonar for perch but tomorrow I'm going to simcoe for lakers and don't really want to go blind, anyone found a solution for this problem? Thanks!"
764625,BillM,2013-02-02 16:55:00,17367,"Didn't you make a thread like this a few weeks ago?   Did you hit the menu button like I suggested and selected 'normal' before it boots up?  If that's not it, you've got a bad connection somewhere or a bad transducer."
764626,Christopheraaron,2013-02-02 17:03:00,3525,"Ya, I remeber. I tried that but I didn't have that option."
764639,Burtess,2013-02-02 18:04:00,901,"I would say a bad connection as well, there are only like 3 pins on that connector.  I just started using a 160 on the ice as well, works great so far, I can see 4 or 5 maggots drop from the surface to the bottom, that really surprised me.  Burt "
764641,Christopheraaron,2013-02-02 18:22:00,3525,"Ok, so assuming it's a bad connection is there anyway to fix it? Or do I have to replace the transducer? Also could it be a bad connection if it still works in warm conditions (which it does)?"
764670,mike rousseau,2013-02-02 20:45:00,4661,Never hurts to try electrical contact cleaner  spray...  Might be the best $5 you ever spend...  Just give both male and female connections a good soaking and leave to dry before testing it out...
764694,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-02 21:19:00,10439,Could be a bad solder joint in the FF it's self. Connection goes bad in the cold and is fine in the warm.

764919,Sinker,2013-02-03 17:42:00,8692,Do you have the iceducer for it?
764969,Christopheraaron,2013-02-03 21:56:00,3525,"Alright, tried bill's way and for some reason I don't even get that option    Also tried trax's suggestion and it didn't seem to help. Sinker, no I don't have the ice ducer, just the normal transducer.  I tried it today and it started out fine (as always) but then after about an hour it started to glitch and when I tried to reboot it wouldn't accept the transducer. I'll try Mike's idea tomorrow. Thanks for the replies guys  :)"
