764757,Roy,2013-02-02 23:24:00,13728,"For those of you who weren't happy about the menu block at the upper left of the pages in the Aplitex Earth skin, We've installed a new skin called Earthbound. Basically the same colours as the Aplitex but this one seems cleaner. If you want to try it,  click on ""change theme"" at the bottom left of the page and choose ""Earthbound""  Thanks"

764797,Rod Caster,2013-02-03 01:01:00,5784,"Looks great. Now if only the IP website would work properly on my BB life would be better. I barely bother checking in anymore from my phone what a pain in the butt...  edit: everytime I change to IP Mobile on my phone, the site (on my computer) goes to IP Mobile, yet my phone reverts back to the default page which is not formatted for the phone. I might have to open a second account just so I can use my phone again."
