764955,chris.brock,2013-02-03 20:36:00,4053,"This daytrip was with my Dad and brother. We don't get out together alot anymore, so we went on a trek.  A pretty good drive to our starting point. We used 1 snowmobile (2 guys) and pulled a sled for the third guys so we could get everyone in, in one trip.  Here's the guys walking the last trail to our destination lake, alot of nice hemlock forests in the area.    We couldn't get large emerald shiners, we had some tiny emeralds and some larger common shiners. I was worried the common shiners weren't going to do the trick. We set up the tip-ups, no bites for the first 45 minutes, then the frenzy started.    the fish came in waves, all afternoon    when the bite was on, it was hard to keep all the lines set, and hard to warm up your hands    here's a nice male that looks more brookie-ish    we lit a fire in some pines on the shore,    flurries all day then a good snow squal later in the afternoon    we landed 11 fish on probably around 25 bites, the action would come in waves, then go quiet for awhile  We all had a great day, a good adventure, it was likely one of my top 50, all time fun fishing days "

764960,davey buoy,2013-02-03 20:56:00,5505,"Looks like a good day,nice pics ,that squall sure came in!!!"
764968,wuchikubo,2013-02-03 21:50:00,1114,"Good to see you got into some fish, definitely looked fun. Thanks for sharing."
764973,NAW,2013-02-03 22:06:00,4022,Awesome man!  I've really been enjoying your back lake reports this year!
764984,mikdor,2013-02-03 22:56:00,109,Great pics and report You guys had a good day. What Depth were most of your fish caught in. Thanks Mike
764985,Out4Trout,2013-02-03 22:57:00,98,"Sweet success!! Really nice fish there, and with family-  special times."
764990,Acountdeleted,2013-02-03 23:07:00,2562,"Man, love seeing big beautiful trout like that. Great catches."
764999,chris.brock,2013-02-03 23:42:00,4053," yeah, I seem to always want to explore the back lakes, sometimes it works out, sometimes not so much   I think the steady, fluffy snow added to our memories of the day, the squall was cool too   cool, thanks, next weekend is guys weekend at the cottage, 2 city slickers, fishin', sleddin', and probably some drinkin'   the shallowest was 5', the deepest was 20', all depths yielded strikes, only 1 tip-up never moved all day, I'd say optimum depth that day was 8'   thanks, the family aspect made it special"
765038,Joeytier,2013-02-04 03:39:00,3990,"Great fish, and tough to beat that average size.  I've yet to find a type of baitfish that splake won't clobber!"
765043,chris.brock,2013-02-04 03:53:00,4053," commons, emeralds, they didn't seem to mind, there was even a few suckers in there too that got hit  we could really notice the year classes of the fish caught, the lake's stocked every 2nd year, any tips on how find the old timers?"
765046,solopaddler,2013-02-04 04:06:00,8605,"Wow, another great day on the ice Chris!"
765072,Rod Caster,2013-02-04 13:27:00,5784,Great average size! I'd take a day like that anytime!
765073,asdve23rveavwa,2013-02-04 13:30:00,2690,"Fabulous report, with some beautiful fish!!!!!!"
765098,moxie,2013-02-04 15:18:00,1566,"Looks like a Smokin' Time had by all.....hehehe. Family fun never gets old, thanks for sharing Chris."
765101,fishindevil,2013-02-04 15:23:00,6254,awesome day back lake fishin !!!! some very nice sized fish...
765106,woodro,2013-02-04 15:27:00,168,Looked like a great trip. Definitely worth the trek in if you're catching those fish. That male fish looks like a brookie for sure. The coulouration and also the shape of the tail. Square tail vs fork tail is usually a dead give away thst its a brookie.  Thanks for sharing.
765160,kemper,2013-02-04 18:25:00,2232,"I tried to catch a few of those thru the ice once, all I caught was a cold.  That's how most of my ice fishing stories go actually...  Nice fish!"
765171,Sinker,2013-02-04 18:49:00,8692,"Great average size splake for sure! Thanks for the report.  Fishing with family is always great. Ya can't beat a back lake trout trip, the shore lunch fire under the pines, nice fresh snowfall.....beauties man! That's what my icefishing dreams are made of. Pounding on the trout is always a great bonus! Nice work!  S."
765195,jimmer,2013-02-04 19:39:00,2730,I was going to say the same thing. I think that is a brookie with the square tail.
765263,Musky or Specks,2013-02-04 23:25:00,2710,The green colour that I currently am is not from bad tuna salad. That my friend is Envy! Nice trip and report.
