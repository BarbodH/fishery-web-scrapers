I don't have a lot of ice specific gear, so I was thinking of jigging smaller spoons if I'm unable to grab something at crappy tire in the morning.  If I were to use spoons, what pattern or type would you recommend? I have a variety of cleos and other lighter spoons to try.  Thanks for your help!  Tight lines  GC"
