As I was going through my box today i found a pack Eagle Claw Grigsby HP hooks. Totally forgot I had them, didnt even use them. Upon closer inspection of the hooks, I noticed that the tie loop doesnt fully close. Theres a lock wire on the loop that digs into the tube but i can slip it right out of the loop. Does anyone know if that wire is strong enough that if I have a fish on, it will not break or slip off?  "
764823,Roy,2013-02-03 02:10:00,13728,I might not be understanding your question but your line has nothing to do with the SS clip. Your line is tied to the hook eye. The clip is simply there to keep your bait from sliding down the hook shank.

Instead of getting into it more, I'm going to trust your experience with them.  I got 2.75 inch tubes. Most wide gaps are way too big for them and someone suggested them.  Havent tried closing the gap since I'm not sure what its going to do to the lock. But, might as well give it a shot."
