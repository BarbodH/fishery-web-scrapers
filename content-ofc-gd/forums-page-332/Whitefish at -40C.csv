No trout today and I only managed 4 whitefish total. Plenty on the screen....they just did not want to play....cant say i blame them ....lol...too freekin' cold. My buddy cliff could not get a bite all afternoon.  We were going to head to a walleye lake up the road like we'd planned last Saturday. Again our plans were foiled....Apparently it was too cold for sleighs too as i have cracked my Otter flip over....hopefully i can repair it with some plastic weld epoxy.  The footage of the sled ride out is added from last week.....i finally managed to get my puter to upload the clips with sound....so while it is creative editing...it is footage of the journey to the same venue.            GOOD ONE TO GET TEAM 8 OFF THE MARK......23""              AHHHHHHH CRAPPY!          "

764865,Terry,2013-02-03 12:02:00,14456,cool video going though the trail to the lake
764870,TJQ,2013-02-03 12:50:00,7806,Wait a min.... you cant enter the fish if its frozen... could have come from the market!!!
764879,Rod Caster,2013-02-03 13:32:00,5784,Not too many guys would venture out in conditions like that. Cheers to you.
764916,Sinker,2013-02-03 17:34:00,8692,"Yikes! How old is that hut? That's a bad crack dude! Your going to have to drill it, and stitch it up with wire first, then try and seal it. It will look like frankenstien when your done. You'd think that would be warrantied, no? That's rough!  S."
764928,Jet,2013-02-03 18:25:00,364,Looked like that weather didn't phase you two at all dropping down to your hoodies! Really enjoyed the trek in. Those are the kinds of lakes I love looking for.
765024,limeyangler,2013-02-04 00:51:00,5204,  Not too many guys are that stoopid....lol   No warranty... 5 years old. What wire would you suggest?   There was no wind when we arrived....15 minutes later the wind picked up and the jackets and balaclavas were back on....QUICKLY!
765033,deffect,2013-02-04 01:54:00,15,Mechanics wire maybe? Or you could drill holes on either side and use decent size zip ties to cinch the crack together then epoxy over to make it smooth on the bottom again? Just a thought Good luck
