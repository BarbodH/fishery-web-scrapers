I know a lot of you like to hear the reel peel, but with the GoPro's waterproof case the sound gets muffled so I decided to put some tunes to the videos. I'm still getting use to the editing process with Sony Vegas but it's getting better.  Enjoy.         Colin."

765371,irishfield,2013-02-05 05:01:00,26272,"Great videos and some wonderful fish!!! You're like Lloyd.. 3"" at best of ice and you're trying to melt your way through with the heater!! LOL !!"
765388,Roy,2013-02-05 11:36:00,13728,"Very nice, Colin. Don't apologize for your video, it looks great to me. You seem to be a methodical type the way your stuff is laid out  but I must say that that lice still looks a little on the thin side for my liking. Thanks for sharing."
765400,ckrb2007,2013-02-05 13:27:00,449,"I know.....it does look thin but it was a solid 5""+ of excellent black ice and it's very clear with hardly any bubbles in the ice. It's like watching a big screen TV when you're fighting a fish. I haven't seen such great ice on Simcoe in well, 2 years!!    Also, thanks for the compliment....much appreciated."

765418,TJQ,2013-02-05 14:51:00,7806,Sweet...   watching through the ice must be something.. i dont think ive ever had ice like that.
765516,misfish,2013-02-05 21:28:00,29133,"Nice vid Colin. How you liking those rapala rods? I love the one I bought off of you. Great back bone,and large eyes.  Laughing at Waynes comment.  Goby tube?  Ok, spill the beans,where to get.LOL"
765635,ckrb2007,2013-02-06 03:12:00,449,"Loving the r-type rods. I have an extra 36""'er I might sell. Yeah, the trout have been hammering the TriggerX Goby tube. I'm not sure where you can get them...possibly Sail since they carry a lot of Rapala/triggerX stuff. I have a buddy who works at Rapala in Oshawa so I order direct through him."
