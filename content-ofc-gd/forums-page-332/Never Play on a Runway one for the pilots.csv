764914,tb4me,2013-02-03 17:33:00,3295,They are lucky to be alive thats for sure..
764921,GreenCanada,2013-02-03 17:46:00,375,"I saw this video a couple weeks ago and from the discussion that was had (on Reddit) the concensus was that the pilot was likely trying to scare the idiots, because they were on a runway that they shouldn't have been on. There were discussions about the physics involved and the lack of an approach and the style of plane.  I'm not an expert, but I'd have to throw out my undies if I was the camera man."
764927,SirCranksalot,2013-02-03 18:21:00,3291,"I'm no pilot, but he seemed to be going a bit fast for a landing.  Is that some kind of souped up biplane? Why is the white smoke or steam coming out of it?"
764936,BillM,2013-02-03 18:57:00,17367," It's a show plane, I'm sure the pilot knew exactly what he was doing."
764952,irishfield,2013-02-03 20:03:00,26272,"  Don't believe everything you see on the interweb... a totally staged event.. oh and the FAA ain't too happy with the pilot right now, although nobody was ever in any real danger.. and that wing's a LONG way from hitting the ground. I know guys that could have done that whole routine inverted, but I'd probably have to get TJ to ride the ATV for the whole effect.."
764995,tb4me,2013-02-03 23:16:00,3295,"Well I kind of thught it was staged some how. Being in fact staged, its an incredible expamle of performance."
