765119,BITEME,2013-02-04 16:03:00,1968,AH hahahahahaha that is the best one i have ssen in awhile almost fell of my chair  I have no pity for the seals I have seen first hand there destructive nature  cruel or whatever you wish to call this If it were my living to fish I can tell you there would be alot of floaters...Just saying
765399,BITEME,2013-02-05 13:17:00,1968,"Lets try to reason this out a bit  First let me say I have no love lost for seals. Once upon a time they were not an issue. The inshore fishermen led a happy life and so did they. Along comes the  giant offshore dragger fleet by the 100rds. Fishing is now a share holder event and the little guys are left out add in to the mix some weird insatiable fixation on shark fins let this play out for a decade and a half  and you know where this is headed I don’t blame the seals still though no love lost. Now picture present day you are trying to scrabble a living fishing you have been slapped with one quota after another to the point it is almost not worth going. Draggers and shark finners are full tilt and the destroyed off catch is enough to make you hurl just so you no if its not in the quota over the side it goes now if you were a fish compressed at the bottom of multiple tons of other fish what do you think your chances are of survival. Make no mistake this is not an easy life its what you know, your fathers fathers knew back 300 or so years. You’ve spent the better part of a day and a half steaming out to your spot another day dropping gear and now the wait. So couple days later you start pulling gear and the results are light on any particular trawl you seem to be doing alright not great alright. You come to your halibut spot and start pulling good run on restaurant fish they pay more per pound then the bigger fish. Next tub you start hitting big fish things are looking good lots of 150’ s  line loads up must be big fish coming you get it to the side of the boat and its chewed  ruined  couple more like this and you see the line is acting funny coming in, low and behold a seal attached to the next 200lber and he has got a lock on it like a pitbull. The solution is in the boat you draw the conclusion. I don’t blame the seals but a living needs to be made and there is nothing else in the water dealing with them the population is explosive and the patience of fishermen is very thin.  Just saying"
765401,bubbles,2013-02-05 13:29:00,591,Maybe you should consider clubbing the Draggers and shark finners as opposed to the seals.  As you pointed out everyone lived a happy life before them........................   Just sayin
765406,grimsbylander,2013-02-05 13:51:00,3016,"I fail to see the humour in this. Next time we have to defend our position as fisherman, outdoorsmen and conservationists, let's just tell jokes about illegally killing animals and leaving them to waste. Yeah, that'll swing the vote our way."
765414,mercman,2013-02-05 14:49:00,7054, Ya...that oughta do it.
764513,NAW,2013-02-02 03:26:00,4022,Someone bludgeoned around 50 seals to death on a beach in PEI.  Or atleast that's how many they left on the beach to rot.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2013/02/01/pei-dead-seals-bludgeoned-584.html  Brutal!
764516,bassman87,2013-02-02 03:54:00,586,Disgusting.
764530,Christopheraaron,2013-02-02 04:38:00,3525,Sad. And of course in the comments they instantly start to blame fishermen
764531,irishfield,2013-02-02 04:40:00,26272,Would you post the same link Nick if some veterinarians found 5000 Cormorants dead on the beach?
764544,outllaw,2013-02-02 11:14:00,1232,lmao. musta got the seal of approval.
764549,Rich,2013-02-02 11:50:00,3927,"Seems rather senseless.  Can't believe people would defend this.. no matter what your opinion, this is pretty black and white. Definitely illegal, anyway.  Irishfield would you use the cormorant comparison if it was a pile of dead, snagged, rotten walleye carcasses left to spoil?"
764553,Marko,2013-02-02 12:31:00,854,IT doesn't matter what animal is laying there dead....why kill it if you are not going to make use out of it. Its pretty sadistic actually
764561,Christopheraaron,2013-02-02 13:20:00,3525, Who's defending the idiots?
764564,krixxer,2013-02-02 13:46:00,274,Is it time to order my spotted seal trapper hat?
764591,glen,2013-02-02 15:13:00,2641,They make good boots too.
764597,Sinker,2013-02-02 15:20:00,8692,Even better mitts!!  S.
764605,NAW,2013-02-02 15:50:00,4022,  Yes.  But it would be followed with...  I do get your point though Wayne.
764621,irishfield,2013-02-02 16:32:00,26272,"I'm not defending anyone Rich... I'm making a point. There's been countless threads that  we, fishermen, have had here about blasting the fish eating Cormorants and leaving them to rot. Seals are the Cormorants of the east coast, as far as they're concerned down there, eating their fish stocks."
764622,misfish,2013-02-02 16:48:00,29133,BUT THE FLIPPERS MAKE GOOD TABLE FAIR.. Wasted meat.
764629,Fish Farmer,2013-02-02 17:29:00,2234,"You hit the nail on the head Wayne. Lobsters don't mined, probably put on a few pounds."
764632,muskeybugged,2013-02-02 17:38:00,282," How does this become ""their"" fish stocks?   Hit the seal on the head Wayne!"
764644,Rich,2013-02-02 18:44:00,3927,"Well cormorants arent edible, so that would be completely different in every way."
764652,fishindevil,2013-02-02 19:31:00,6254,Seal burger to be served at a restaurant near you !!! And yes they say the seal population ha exploded cause there isn't much of a seal hunt anymore and yes they are hated by fishermen big time as they have devestated some area stocks not only fish but other things they eat !!!!! They view seals like we do cormorants !!!!!!! Whoever did it should be held reponsible as they didn't have to leave them to Rot .....
764657,Twocoda,2013-02-02 20:03:00,4130,so everyone should be looking to the MNR and ask....why isnt there a controlled hunt on the seals to avoid situations like this... Poaching is poaching
764659,misfish,2013-02-02 20:16:00,29133,Poaching
764660,BillM,2013-02-02 20:20:00,17367,"I would just say mindless killing, it's not like they did anything with them after they were dead."
764859,Sinker,2013-02-03 06:32:00,8692,The east coast also has a cormmorant problem!  Someone should do something with those seals. They look tasty to me  S.
765051,BillM,2013-02-04 05:01:00,17367,Seal......sausages?
765077,Headhunter,2013-02-04 14:01:00,5703,Flipper Pie! HH
