764664,Terry,2013-02-02 20:36:00,14456,got out today with Lloyd  who as always shows off by getting more and bigger  fish then any one else I know he does it to bug me.....lol  we did a long run out and it was easy going the ride back I did by myself and didn't go as close to shore as I did on the way out and found a pressure crack I really didn't like. took a couple of km to find a nice spot to cross it..besides that it was a good ride              
764667,Joey,2013-02-02 20:39:00,9122,"Damn, wish I could have made it  How's tomorrow sound??  Way to go Lloyd, some nice lakers there - showoff"

764672,RickOnt,2013-02-02 20:48:00,669,Nice Laker!!  This wind is definitely pushing the ice around  Rick
764674,Terry,2013-02-02 20:52:00,14456,"7"" where  I was there are lots of small pressure cracks and one bad one ,I think it was north of long shoal  i hear the lake access at ibp has some broken ice..ok for skidoos but gave atv-ers a hard time"
