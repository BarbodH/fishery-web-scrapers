764726,Rich,2013-02-02 22:22:00,3927,How far of a walk would it be?  Hope this does not break the code of asking too much info publicly.  This is simply to plan whether to pack heavy or light.. (which hut to bring if any).. never done it before.
764729,misfish,2013-02-02 22:31:00,29133,"How far,are you willing to walk? How far,are you willing to drag,so called hut?"
764732,Rich,2013-02-02 22:42:00,3927,PM sent
764733,Terry,2013-02-02 22:44:00,14456,there are places that are a short  walk and places that are a hike and a half. many people walk well over a km to get into the big ones while others walked a couple hundred ft
764734,Rich,2013-02-02 22:51:00,3927,"I actually don't know the name of the place we're going. Some infamous bay. I really don't care about the distance, just would rather not be foot dragging buddy's otter several km's..."
764739,Live2fish85,2013-02-02 22:57:00,1633,"  Haha, you shouldn't be friends with him if he has an Otter. I mean you try and rip anyone that spends money on gear and Otter are one of the most expensive huts."
764741,Rich,2013-02-02 23:06:00,3927,"Let me put this effluently and truthfully, all honesty : I HATE his Otter."
764743,Rich,2013-02-02 23:07:00,3927,Good to see several weeks have gone by and you still missed the point of that thread that should remain in the past.
765013,Rich,2013-02-04 00:31:00,3927,"Wow. Obviously all my posts are a complete farce. Good job, you really got my grammar pegged there. Your students must love you."
765016,irishfield,2013-02-04 00:36:00,26272,But that is what he meant Sinclair... it's an absolute piece of crap to pull!
765028,Christopheraaron,2013-02-04 01:19:00,3525," Since you're smart you must be a teacher  Also, to answer the post, I think fox island is probably the farthest walk to popular grounds, I did it today in about 20 minutes"
765030,Freshtrax,2013-02-04 01:31:00,2215,"I usually put a km or two in a days fishing for lakers when I'm walking,  on the sled 10 or twenty on a tough day"
765060,Rich,2013-02-04 11:34:00,3927,"Thanks for the info guys. Sounds like I'd better pack light to be safe.  ""Effluent"" was ""eloquent"" being autocorrected btw."
