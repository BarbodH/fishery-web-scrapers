765462,Christopheraaron,2013-02-05 18:05:00,3525,"You can do it this way, It does take forever though, and wouldn't you rather be fishing"
765464,Christopheraaron,2013-02-05 18:07:00,3525,"I also skip the varnish and instead do it properly with dubbing, which gives it that ""leggy"" quality, the way trout fisherman prefer."
765595,fishindevil,2013-02-06 00:57:00,6254,The other addition you can do is put a little white pearl on the hook at the bend !!!! We used them 20yrs ago on simcoe and they worked amazing !!! I forget the name of them does anyone else remember them ...I might even still have some... They were the hottest bait around the Americans went crazy for them and guys were selling them for 10 time what they were worth.... Ahhhhh memories....
765247,mr blizzard,2013-02-04 22:24:00,1589,"When we moved up here a year ago from Barrie some things got lost in the move, most importantly was some fishing gear aka wooly bear.  Some of you from Barrie would have know George O'Brian. We had the priviledge of knowing him for over 20 years, the man could catch fish out of a pickle barrel, BUT most importantly we used to buy the wooly bears from him, they are used primarily for perch. They were sort of red and beige and fuzzy.  Can anyone help to locate some and get them up here, I would pay for them and the shipping.  Thanks Blizz"
765250,dhickey,2013-02-04 22:48:00,1038,Sounds like a wooly bugger? Incredible   cought every kind of fish on that...
765256,mr blizzard,2013-02-04 23:11:00,1589,"Your right wooly bugger, but when my son was 5 he thought I was swearing so we nicknamed it wooly bear lol .  I saw them in a store a couple of years before we left but I am drawing a blank."
765257,davey buoy,2013-02-04 23:13:00,5505,Ct sells them.Bought a few last year. Is it a bug or bugger?.
765260,Joey,2013-02-04 23:21:00,9122,Like this:  http://www.oakmountainoutfitters.com/yum-f2-wooly-bug.html
765272,Christopheraaron,2013-02-04 23:43:00,3525,Do you mean like a simcoe bug? I can make as many as you want if it is.
765283,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-05 00:28:00,10439,What does a Simcoe Bug look like?
765287,dhickey,2013-02-05 00:43:00,1038,Nope thats not a wooly bugger?
765288,dhickey,2013-02-05 00:46:00,1038,Ya I picked them up out in Alberta. They dont look the same here???  Don.
765289,mr blizzard,2013-02-05 00:47:00,1589,"Not really, it was like pipe cleaner material wrapped around the shaft, the length of the hook was no more than 1/2"""
765294,mr blizzard,2013-02-05 00:56:00,1589,Can u send me a picture of the simcoe bug to see if we are talking about the same thing.
765301,dhickey,2013-02-05 01:16:00,1038,Ya cant  find them anywhere...  I have another one its called a  Water DAWG  Cant find it? Got a couple other that I would like to find as well..  Don.
765304,Joey,2013-02-05 01:19:00,9122,"Lots of them on Ebay, if they are the ones  you are talking about!"
765305,Joeytier,2013-02-05 01:20:00,3990,Wooly buggers are not hard to find...probably the most popular fly in the world.
765306,Christopheraaron,2013-02-05 01:21:00,3525, 
765307,Christopheraaron,2013-02-05 01:22:00,3525,"It can also be tied on very small jigs, with a lead underbody or you can dropshot it with a split shot"
765319,Fisherman,2013-02-05 01:32:00,7201,"Last I saw George just around Christmas, he and his buddy were sitting beside the Barrie marina gas pumps just killing the perch.  Give him a call, 705 727 0446."
765322,mr blizzard,2013-02-05 01:36:00,1589,"  BINGO Christopher  That is exactly what it looked like with only slight colour variations, could u pm me with some colour varieties, and prices and thanks everyone for all your help, much appreciated."
765324,mr blizzard,2013-02-05 01:46:00,1589,"Thanks fisherman I will certainly give him a call, I remember when he would pick the crayfish out of the weeds when they combined the weeds from the finger docks, quite the character, glad to hear he is still going strong."
765327,Christopheraaron,2013-02-05 01:51:00,3525,PM sent
765335,dhickey,2013-02-05 02:34:00,1038,Not to say your wrong but I bought these 20 yrs ago and would like to get it made if not just for me then maby some others would enjoy?
765404,mr blizzard,2013-02-05 13:47:00,1589,"Hey Don, get a hold of Christopher, sounds like he could help. Blizz"
765405,Christopheraaron,2013-02-05 13:48:00,3525,"Yup, if anyone needs them I can do them."
765425,shane,2013-02-05 15:06:00,652,Sounds like something T.J. should carry in his store.  I also thought we were talking about wooly bugger flies. Probably the most common fly out there.
765457,Ron,2013-02-05 17:45:00,1683,"Or, you can make them yourself.  This is shots of my ""how to"" from several years back....          I use clear lacquer nail polish as a finish coat."
