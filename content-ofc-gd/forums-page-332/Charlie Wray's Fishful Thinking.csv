It's a good problem to have I guess.  I can't say I like or dislike any of them. I watch a show based solely on the criteria of ""does it interest me?"". I have favorite hosts that bug me sometimes too. Showing me how terrific a certain jig catches 2lb walleye on a fly-in lake doesn't excite or convince me of it's worth. But hey, that's just me and maybe only me."

But on that note I can`t seem to grasp any key pointers from Leo and Ron except for if you host a fishing show you can show a half hour of yourself sitting on a beach down south talking about and showing clips from previous shows. Sorta like a `best hits` episode

764848,Radnine,2013-02-03 05:07:00,1538,"This show has to be the worst outdoor program i have ever seen.  Have spoken to Charlie? I am here to tell you that he will chat to you about what ever you like if you go to a boat show or a spring fishing or Sportsman show. Now, I realize that is not what your post is about (it is about his show) but if you talked to him you might realize what his show is based on, and that is fishing and doing want it takes to catch fish. Slight nuances and little changes that catch fish. Has anyone else told you about using Spin-N-Glo's instead of blades to make worm harnesses out of? No. I think that we have gotten used to a fat old man (or men) pulling in tiny walleye after tiny walleye without telling us beens about where they are (other than the lodge that is paying them) why they are there, and what they are using. Or why they are using it. Charlie does all of that. He is brilliant, and a terrific guy. Don't watch his show if you want not to, but it is not him that is the problem, it is you. (change the channel and shut your pie-hole) I am in the process of pairing up a new Komodo bait caster with a Citrix rod, based on Charlie's advise when asked at at recent show.

He had top entries in a lot of different species categories. I used to enjoy seeing where the bigguns were coming from. They used to name the lake and everything.  There is no doubt in my mind that Charlie knows his stuff is worthy of a show.  Now having said that, I don't personally like or watch his shows anymore. He is a product of the industry just like all the others...especially here in Canada where they have to blatantly flog their sponsors name every third sentence.  Nothing but one big long 1/2 hour infomercial!  Like already mentioned, I think there would be a lot more value in just showing the products they are using and discretely promoting them instead of ramming the sponsors product at us constantly over and over.  I don't blame the hosts for this. They have to do what they have to do to stay on the air and make a living. It is the sponsor companies that disgust me. My 2 centavos worth! lol"

Then started a discussion. His opinion on a fishing show doesn't make him bad or stupid. Judging him based on his opinion on a fishing show, speaks wonders for your character though."
764868,frodobuggins,2013-02-03 12:42:00,127," Those old In-Fisherman shows were the best! I remember one segment in particular where Doug Stange was fan casting from a pier for salmon/trout. It was so well done with losts of the natural surrounding shown, and his casting was time lapsed. It was visually amazing and it gave me hope for when my dad would take me out to the credit pier or southampton.  I even remember and like those old french canadian ones that were from the 70's probably with two guys paddling around in a canoe that used to be shown on channel 12 randonmly   He does seem like a good guy, but i never stated the opposite. I wanted a discussion on what people thought of the show.   Barked up the wrong tree? Shut my pie hole?

He has a wonderful sense of humor, is very intelligent, very personable and all the rest of the qualities that are needed to become an accomplished television personality. I like his show. It's easy to watch and he raises many fine points.  Good stuff Charlie!"

""Outdoor Passion"" with Ray Carignon is a narrative written by what seems like a retired elementary school grammar teacher post lobotomy....no substance of any value but verbose beyond my level of tolerance. It really is quite horrible and so patronizing. The show has all the redeeming qualities of a bucket of poutine. Pet peve are shows that use computer generated heavy metal music with lead guitar licks as background which are just as intolerable."

765095,lew,2013-02-04 15:03:00,12766,"I'll always remember the episode where Charlie was trolling for muskies on LSC. He hooked a fish and before he landed it a minute later he'd advertised 6 different products.  Started off immediately by saying if it hadn't been for his extra quiet Honda he'd never have been able to sneak up on the fish and they were OK on the big lake because of his super safe Crestliner. He knew the fish was hooked solid because of his extra sharp Mustads and he'd have no problem cranking it in with his Okuma reel and his Okuma rod could handle the strain and when it got to the boat he'd land it easily with his fantastic Frabil net...whew !!!!  Pure spam fest, but sadly that's the way alot of the shows are now and the main reason I seldom watch any fishing shows anymore."

I am the type of guy who is  constantly looking for more information, any small detail that perhaps that i may not know. If my ""Fishing game "" was lacking in areas i would say it would be in the area around which a lot fishful thinking shows focus on ex. great lakes trolling, fishing for sturgeon, or big pacific river salmon etc. So for me i get a lot out of his shows because its sharpening up my knowledge on the weaker points of my game. I sometimes get bored watching clone bass being caught one after another becasue thats the strong part of my game and i find that a lot of the info they share on bass shows is common sense because its regular practice for me. I find charlie to be straight up, very knowledgable, and a decent guy. I would rather support a guy like that than some of the other chumps out there who dont remember where they came from and that its the viewers that are the back bone of there product. I also like ""facts of fishing"" just because daves personality seems close to mine, and is always good for a chuckle but holy was it three weeks in a row with him, doing 3 different shows of smallie fishing on beauchene. I maybe wrong and guys here im sure will correct me but i was shocked this saturday AM when i watched, and i actually had to laugh a little saying to my self is this really happening or is this groundhog day. I know he is probably a little busier lately with a lot more going on. But I do like his show. PS. Infisherman if your ok with the preaching at the  end still a great source for information."

Also seen some great bass shows that he has done; not trolling but he was using Live Target Baits before pretty much anyone else...  On another note, most fishing shows are pretty much infomercials: if hosts aren't pushing product say goodbye to the sponsers. and it's generally not viable to bankroll a show by yourself.  Sponsers definitely rule this business!"
764623,SlowPoke,2013-02-02 16:48:00,2984,"There are too many 'look how many fish I can catch' shows. I like a show that; - shows you why old school techniques still work. - offers new techniques and when/how to use them. - brings you to familiar surroundings as well as featuring remote outposts.  Charlie Wray doesn't always meet that criteria but he's likable, knowledgeable and I'll keep watching."

The only show I've really enjoyed in recent years was Mark Krupa's. But that's a direct result of the destinations he travelled to and the genius of his camera man/producer Ihor Macijiwsky. Macijiwsky is imo a master in his field."

764653,Rich,2013-02-02 19:43:00,3927,"I half agree. Charlie's show is great for people who prefer to fish that way. He is a human billboard so I dunno how anyone could say they like the lack pf advertising. Our running joke when I was growing up was ""oh look, the Luhr Jensen show is on!""  His show doesn't interest me personally as I don't fish his methods or spots.  What I do like is that he sticks to community holes. No secrets. I caught the fish ob such and such lake, looking for the following structure - this is how a fishing show SHOULD be. So you can actually learn something watching it, unlike fnc or the others who just promote a lodge the whole show."

764681,landry,2013-02-02 21:03:00,1005,In talking with him at fishing shows I have always found him to be a great guy. I hate trolling with every ounce of my being. Lol. I can't stop watching fishing shows even though I hate how ridiculous the almost constant product plugs have become on almost all shows. A lot of guys can't use a sentence without mentioning a sponsor's product. I think that approach is less effective than saying nothing and letting us see what they r using in the background. Landry

Its not like you have your life wrapped up in this!  As for Charlie Wray, I think he has a pretty decent show, although I haven't watched anything other than treehouse for the last 3.5 years and our youngest bundle showed up.  All the shows I saw previously where pretty good, and I like his personality as a host.  My 2 cents!"

764582,frodobuggins,2013-02-02 14:58:00,127,"Look, i  think the guy has fishing smarts. I just wish he would diversify his programming a bit. I dont mind Fishin Canada now that Reno is gone. Pete Bowman is the ultimate hoser angler"

764586,frodobuggins,2013-02-02 15:00:00,127, I guess its the opposite for me. I never long line.

764588,fishinmortician,2013-02-02 15:00:00,100,Hoser sums it up!
764590,Muskieman,2013-02-02 15:11:00,2472,"Charlie has an informative show, nothing wrong with trolling ( for fish ) , I find his show to be a whole lote better than some on WFN... a few shows from the 80's come to mind...  no names ,but I was stalked and trolled here at OFC on Facebook ,YouTube and by web-mail by an ex fishing show host a few years back , because of a few observations I made about him.  Randy "
764596,Jer,2013-02-02 15:19:00,1426,I have seen an episode with him casting for musky on Pigeon & Buckhorn...once...LOL     Sometimes Charlie's show is nothing but a half hour commercial.
764598,ch312,2013-02-02 15:20:00,1590," Awesome, thanks!  I guess it was the ""charlie"" that rang a bell. I used to love that show..."
764599,frodobuggins,2013-02-02 15:21:00,127," Yeah, for fuel..."
764601,Tim Mills,2013-02-02 15:40:00,476,"Agree about the trolling but I like the fact that Charlie will take the time to explain the technical aspects of how he is fishing.  Most fishing shows are either guided fishing days with the local expert or fishing at remote lodges with minimal pressure.  I prefer the episodes when a show/host fishes local places that are accessable to the average person.  Italo doea a nice job of mixing in some episodes like this.  Fishing the lower Niagara from shore, 18 mile , kayaking the lower Grand etc."
764603,BillM,2013-02-02 15:47:00,17367, You've gotta be kidding me..  Charlie Wray was a staple for me Sat mornings when I was a kid...
764606,Muskieman,2013-02-02 15:51:00,2472,"Note ; MANY ! TV hosts are members of this forum and are active, maybe even Charlie ..."
764608,frodobuggins,2013-02-02 15:56:00,127," Thats fine. I dont have a fishing show, so he's doing better than me there. If he's unhappy we can do a troll-off somewhere..."
764609,BillM,2013-02-02 15:58:00,17367,"I'm sure any fishing host is going to worry about the opinion of some random guy on a internet message forum, lol!!!  Opinions are like _______.   <--- fill in the blank."
764613,Muskieman,2013-02-02 16:09:00,2472,"You know , that's what I thought as well , I made similar comments about this particular guy , he managed to make my on-line life a sort of hell for almost a year ..."
764615,misfish,2013-02-02 16:17:00,29133,  WINNER  That was a great show. Very educating for those that troll.
