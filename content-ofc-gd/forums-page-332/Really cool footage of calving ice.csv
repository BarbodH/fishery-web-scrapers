764688,lew,2013-02-02 21:12:00,12766,"Nobody puts on a show like Mother nature, truly impressive !!"
764696,davey buoy,2013-02-02 21:21:00,5505,I could only imagine the real sound of that. Spectacular!!!
764719,misfish,2013-02-02 22:10:00,29133,"At 1:52,it looked like a huge ice whale was coming up.  What an great video."
764777,Fisherman,2013-02-03 00:12:00,7201,That's almost beyond comprehension.  Sort of like the whole of the Simcoe ice sheet flipping over at once.
764781,Rich Clemens,2013-02-03 00:26:00,3131,That would be cool to see in person - at a very safe distance of course.
764843,4x4bassin,2013-02-03 04:48:00,1025,"That is the power of mother nature for ya , can you just imagine being there to see and hear that !"
765062,mattyk,2013-02-04 12:02:00,2110,"Very cool, thanks for sharing."
765067,NAW,2013-02-04 13:05:00,4022,"That's a great video!  Felt like that on Simcoe yesterday when we where fishing near a big crack. The ice shifted so hard, I almost fell over..."
765091,adempsey,2013-02-04 14:45:00,1498,"I bet if there were trout under there, people would still try fishing it.  Pretty cool video though!  Going to have to find the full movie."
