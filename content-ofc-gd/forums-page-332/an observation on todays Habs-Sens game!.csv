764978,lookinforwalleye,2013-02-03 22:23:00,4399,Probably risking starting a hockey thread as they usually go down hill quickly but I just want to comment on the officiating in this game and in the NHL in general this year. In todays game Ottawa had a goal called back for goaltender interference it was a horrible call. Earlier in the game Georges and a Ottawa player were racing for the puck on a icing play and there was some very mild contact by both players and the official called Georges for boarding it was a horible call. Equally as frustrating is the constant throwing out of players during faceoffs.  As a side note Mr.  Bob Cole has had a very distinguished career but it may be time to hang up the microphone.

765127,jbailey,2013-02-04 16:21:00,866,"yes, this kicking players out of the face off is just getting ridiculous, drop the damn puck. The interference calls are soft and a lot of ""hooking"" calls that are questionable."
765128,BillM,2013-02-04 16:23:00,17367,"I am so sick of the refs thinking they are apart of this game... Drop the wrong word puck and get outta the way!!!   Also the interference call on Kadri was brutal, goalie was a foot outside of the circle!!  Komarov is also slowly starting to become my favourite Leaf!!  Reminds me a lot of Yushkevich...   Always surprising when a Russian or Euro is slamming guys into the boards!"
