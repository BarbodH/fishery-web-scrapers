I only have ever fished there during soft water  for bass and never trout. Was looking at the MNR stocking list and they put 6600 yearlings in there pretty much every year.Just wondering what to use and which road to use closest to the fishing spot since we will be walking. Whats the ice conditions like and what do you use for bait.
