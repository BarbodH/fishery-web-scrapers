763525,Christopheraaron,2013-01-29 20:52:00,3525,Nice fishies! Must be a blast catching them on centrepins
763528,Roy,2013-01-29 20:54:00,13728,Fantastic video. Thanks for sharing that. It was a pleasure to watch.
763529,Bill Shearer,2013-01-29 20:56:00,456,Well done!
763534,wallacio,2013-01-29 21:07:00,475,Awesome video...kudos to you for actually showing the technique in detail!
763555,moxie,2013-01-29 22:24:00,1566,WoW!!!  Whities off a float. Thanks for sharing.
763561,solopaddler,2013-01-29 22:38:00,8605,"Loved it, thanks!"
763570,misfish,2013-01-29 22:51:00,29133,"That looks like a blast.  Great vid. The way you removed the hooks,it seemed like you pinched the barb. Yes./no?  Also,what net were you using there? I have been looking for a small deep net one.  Thanks for sharing."
763584,cl_fishin,2013-01-29 23:23:00,138,"We were not fishing barbless, but we would not net fish that we were not going to keep, they are pretty delicate so we release them in the water, if it went in the net we kept it. As for the net I don't even know were it came from, had it for years and love it but wouldn't know were to get another"
763585,kemper,2013-01-29 23:24:00,2232,Cool!  I've never caught a whitie - but that seems like a fun way to do it.
763593,BillM,2013-01-30 00:04:00,17367,Awesome!
763640,Freshtrax,2013-01-30 02:02:00,2215,"Looks like a blast,  were you using slip floats?   Never caught one not through the ice"
763779,cl_fishin,2013-01-30 16:34:00,138,Yes....... we were using slip floats
763780,misfish,2013-01-30 16:37:00,29133,Care to share how you go about canning the white fish.  Thanks
763789,cl_fishin,2013-01-30 17:27:00,138,"I am no expert, we had alot of help from some older guys in camp, using their stuff, but basically we packed the jars with skinless chunks, added some of their ""secret"" recipe which was salt, hot sauce and something else. Then cooked the jars in a pressure canner for 100 minutes on a coleman stove maintaining the pressure at I believe 10-15lbs. It is fantastic , better than canned salmon for sure, hope to do it again this year. I'll be shopping for  pressure canner soon."
