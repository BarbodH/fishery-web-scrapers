Well today I noticed it was completely solid....  I've  been reading up on this and its normal I guess.... But I was wondering if there is a way to keep it in its liquid form...  I've already heated it back to its original state...  So is there anything I can do to keep it a liquid or is the heat till it liquifies method before I need it the best method....???  Thanks"
764820,Nipfisher,2013-02-03 01:58:00,2449,Mike I think you have to warm it up to liquify it.
764821,spincast,2013-02-03 02:00:00,3279,"yup, just throw it in the micro as if defrosting. If you keep it in the fridge it is less likely to separate"
764855,Rattletrap2,2013-02-03 06:07:00,1652,Honey is the only natural food that will not spoil....supposedly.
764881,cowanjo,2013-02-03 13:56:00,249,Different types of honey will crystalise at different rates all comes down to glucose contest. microwave will make liquid but will change back quickly. You can buy tulepo honey from florida. But then it doesnt taste real great.
765059,Marc Thorpe,2013-02-04 10:42:00,621,"Actually Honey is one of the few products that remain all naturalIts a natural occurring sugar.Most beekeepers prefer white or light honey which is derived from clovers,apple trees or blueberries in most casesLight honey tends to not crystallize as fast as dark honeyLight honey is easier and seems to be more visually appreciated in commercializationDark honey in most case is far more richer and tastier ,but its richness tends to lead to crystallization fasterMost dark honeys are derived for buckwheatNot much you can do to prevent crystallization"
765092,adempsey,2013-02-04 14:48:00,1498,Can you make a pre-mix with the honey and store that?  Could make a few batches of that.   That should reduce the number of times you have to reheat the honey at least.
765105,mike rousseau,2013-02-04 15:27:00,4661,Possibly  But the timing and moisture of the mix are key to it performing well... It has to be made 6+ hours before use... But no more then say 24 hours or else the properties I want start to go away.... I'm worried freezing it may ruin the effects of the bait...  I figured I'd get the same answer here as I did on google... Crystallization will happen and warm it to liquefy.... The joys of honey....  I guess I'll just buy fresh next year as I need it...
765316,registerfly,2013-02-05 01:28:00,198,"this is correct, just give it a quick nuke. cure all apparently too, heard if you take honey from within 100k you will eventually alleviate your allergies"
765339,Fish Farmer,2013-02-05 02:55:00,2234,"Someone told me you shouldn't nuke it because it kills the nutrients, just place the bottle in a pot of hot water."
765369,Old Man,2013-02-05 04:53:00,822,"For long term storage to keep it liquid, throw it in the freezer in smaller usable containers. Take it out a container as needed and allow to thaw naturally."
