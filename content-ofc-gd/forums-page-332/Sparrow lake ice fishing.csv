There is usually a couple huts out from there a short ways. i have not been out myself but have talked to someone who rents huts on the lake two weeks ago and they claim to have 10"" at that time. there are two rivers that enter the lake (severn and kashe) i would assume those areas would not be safe but kilworthy is north of that area. Unfortunately i cannot vouch for the fishing. Good luck"
