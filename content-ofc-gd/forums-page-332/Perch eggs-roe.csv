764887,Rod Caster,2013-02-03 14:25:00,5784,"Fairly bland and mushy on their own. Definitely safe to eat though. If you have some culinary creativity, I'm sure you could mix up a delicious way of eating them!"
764891,kickingfrog,2013-02-03 14:44:00,8333,"I've heard of people eating them, but I have not."
764892,Nipfisher,2013-02-03 14:46:00,2449,Last year I chummed my fishing holes with them. Didn't seem to work like I hoped.
764899,Slop,2013-02-03 15:26:00,151,Back in my Simcoe days I had friends that would turn their noses up at filets and only wanted the skiens...never did take them up on their offer to try some.
764902,Joeytier,2013-02-03 15:41:00,3990,Got a couple buddies that like to batter the egg sacs and eat em alongside the filets...they don't do much for me but they're certainly not bad
764937,chessy,2013-02-03 19:02:00,610,"PCBs and other organic contaminants, such as DDT and mirex, were elevated in the eggs, likely due to the fact that the eggs have a higher fat content. It is recommended that the consumption of eggs from any fish species, especially from the Great Lakes, be avoided due to elevated contaminant levels."
764940,Acountdeleted,2013-02-03 19:30:00,2562,Talk to Christopher K. He told me he fried up a few a week or so ago.
764962,Rich,2013-02-03 21:04:00,3927,Tie them in a large roe bag and see how long the spring channel cats turn it down..
764972,Christopheraaron,2013-02-03 22:05:00,3525,"Ya, I tried a few sacs, they taste exactly like the flesh, but the texture is a little strange. I think it would be pretty good in some sort of pasta dish, maybe with some shrimp and perch meat. Experiment, they are really good if you incorporate them into other things"
765004,EC1,2013-02-04 00:02:00,930,"If you're feeling adventurous, take the roe and add salt, pepper and pan fry until crispy. TBH, it's something that I'll eat once or twice a season.... Not really any bad flavours to it, but not really my favourite part of a fish either."
765281,sleded,2013-02-05 00:26:00,96,nothing like putting eggs on your toast with a little jam on it lol
765282,Rich,2013-02-05 00:28:00,3927,MMMMMM perch eggs and bacon nothin beats it.. dont forget the ONIONSSS
