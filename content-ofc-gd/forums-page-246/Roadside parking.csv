I tried Googling it but did not find anything in the act or elsewhere. I have been told that it's illegal to park on some, or maybe all, provincial highways I phoned the OPP but the officer was unhelpful in general an particularly unhelpful re which roads it's legal to park beside. People park all the time on the shoulder of county and township roads----dirt roads, two lane paved etc---so it must be legal in some places. The OPP said I'd need to phone the MOT to find out where it's covered in the act."

845758,kickingfrog,2014-04-05 13:39:00,8333,"Yep, need to look at the municipality that the road or secondary highway is located. Just because a vehicle is parked and not ticketed or towed doesn't mean that it won't be."
