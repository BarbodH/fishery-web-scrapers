Good news was it rained a lot last night, and I woke to see almost all the snow gone off my property which was nice, now I just hope my sump pump keeps up with this spring makes me think I should be putting in a battery back up. I hardly ever hear the pump come on but so far this spring she's been running pretty steadily."
