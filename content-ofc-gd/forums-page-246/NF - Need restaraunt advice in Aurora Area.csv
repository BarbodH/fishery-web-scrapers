845051,jedimaster,2014-04-02 12:09:00,3472,"Well, thanks for all the info guys. We ended up deciding on Made in Mexico, and when we got there it was closed. They are closed mon and Tues. Haha, we ended up going for a walk and had dinner at a beer house HBH. Had a great time regardless. Thanks again."
845053,Big Cliff,2014-04-02 12:12:00,6899,Sounds like a good first date!
845608,moxie,2014-04-04 19:40:00,1566,Goin back for seconds I presume??????
845612,jedimaster,2014-04-04 20:13:00,3472,"Haha, of course. Any girl that orders and drinks a stout without flinching is good in my books."
845620,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-04 20:57:00,4399,I hope she likes fishing!!!!
845622,David Chong,2014-04-04 21:17:00,836,"Orchid Thai on Yonge St. is pretty reasonable and food is excellent! Nice atmosphere as well, was just there last night! Chinook is also excellent but a little pricier!"
844683,jedimaster,2014-03-31 20:52:00,3472,"Anyone have a restaraunt they would share? Looking for something that isn't asian, has good food, quiet, can be out of the way of aurora but trying to keep somewhat local. Say from newmarket to richmondhill area. Not really looking to break the bank but not Mcdonalds either. Something in between. 20-25 dollar type entries are fine. umm yah so its a first date type thing so any other advice on a place to go in that area would be much appreciated... Toronto I have no problems finding somethign to do but I don't know the area."
844686,Roy,2014-03-31 20:58:00,13728,Impress the heck out of her and cook something for her.
844688,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-31 21:03:00,826,"Made in Mexico . Newmarket. It's been showcased in a few shows , and is always packed . AWESOME food !!"

Toronto I have no problems finding somethign to do but I don't know the area. Forget local. Wanna make a kick arse impression? O.NOIR. Trust me. If shes in for a second date after that shes a keeper. You'll have a blast as well.  http://www.onoir.com/TO/frames.htm  Roy's idea is a great one considering you can make a hell of a meal for $50-60. Only one problem. If she takes a liking to you and the feeling isn't mutual she'll know where you live. Good luck Capt."

844798,jedimaster,2014-04-01 04:08:00,3472,"I would normally cook as I am a good cook but circumstances here warrant an eat out type thing. Too bad it's supposed to rain, I had a few good outside ideas. I think it'll be coffee and a meal. I will check out each of the spots you guys mentioned. Keep them coming though it may be a last minute decision. I don't even know what she likes. Haha. crap I hope she isn't a member of this forum. Rofl  And thanks."
844803,turtle,2014-04-01 10:37:00,274,The mexican place or goulash place on Main St in Newmarket. Also for BBQ Big Bone on Eagle St. I know you don't want asian food but I also like Pho Saigon or Cambodian Noodle in Newmarket.
844810,Crazy Ivan,2014-04-01 12:04:00,184,Chinook restaurant in Aurora. And the name is even fishing related.

844813,alexmedic,2014-04-01 12:23:00,186,Golden Bell Thai.  William Row/Yonge Street  Small and Intimate.  Reasonably priced as well.
844821,captpierre,2014-04-01 12:55:00,2521,Big Bone has good BBQ but not appropriate for a first date.  Unless she's a butch
844822,Renegade67,2014-04-01 13:06:00,86,"""I would normally cook as I am a good cook but circumstances here warrant an eat out type thing""   Sounds like a ""Plenty of Fish"" type of date.    Good luck.  Hopefully you get a keeper right out of the gate! Sorry, not my area to recommend a place."
844826,jedimaster,2014-04-01 13:32:00,3472,"Haha, its a bit of  a story for another time. I think its gonna be a game time decision. I am leaning towards italian or mexican though."
844827,woodenboater,2014-04-01 13:34:00,2277,"first date ? Go Italian (better desserts and wine). If there's a second, Mexican  third date ? home cooking ftw !"
