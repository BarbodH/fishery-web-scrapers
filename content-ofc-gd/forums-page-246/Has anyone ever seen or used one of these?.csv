846438,muddler,2014-04-08 14:19:00,623,I was looking around and I saw this reel.  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Fly-Fishing-Raft-Fishing-Reel-Ratio-3-1-3-1BB-/371030772822?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item5663284c56  It seem a little odd. Has anyone ever used one? I can't see it used for fly fishing as the handle would probably catch any loose fly line.  Muddler
