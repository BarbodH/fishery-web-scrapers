846348,darsky,2014-04-08 02:01:00,586,Sorry Pauline-your dreams of a new nation are just that now-only dreams. This time my ballot counts. There was a black shade around the candidates check box so very hard to have your ballot thrown out due to improper check marks.Well done Elections Quebec. You learned well after the ballot debacle / fiasco during the last referendum.
