This year, I would have to say was by far the toughest ice season that I have had in recent memory.  There were a few days that we could do no wrong, but there were several that I could do nothing right.  Too many skunks for one season.  I fished several locations, but was limited to walking for the most part, and my own laziness got the best of me on several cold, windy occasions, when I just stayed put instead of moving.  Despite the tough trials, I was still able to find some good success here and there, mostly in the shallower ranges of 55-80 feet.  I had my best lake trout success using an Imperium Ace rigged on a 3/8oz darter head jig and an Imperium Ice tube, also rigged on a 3/8oz head.  There were a lot of ""high flyers"" this season, sitting in the top 30 feet of the water column, at one point I had a smallish (5-6 lbs) laker hit the tube just 5 feet under the ice in 122 ft of water.  Pretty wild stuff.  Hope you enjoy some of the photos from the season! Thanks for viewing.                      I kept 3 or 4 this season for the pan, but for the most part I practice catch and release.  To keep this fishery healthy, I encourage we all do our part to help, CPR. Catch, Photo, Release"
