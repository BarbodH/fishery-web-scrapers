808275,danc,2013-09-18 02:10:00,4677,"By Mickey Gilleys standards, the meaning of this phrase is obvious. But to a Brook Trout fisherman, closing time is the last few days of the open season, when both males and females look their best. Males are the real trophys at this time of year with their deep orange polka dotted flanks, hooked jaws, and humped backs, but they were few and far between for my Buds and I this time. So we had to put up with the girls. They too color up nicely in the fall as they look for a mate to spawn. It was far from our best closure in recent years, but despite the high winds and occasional down pour, we did ok while tenting in the middle of Heaven. We had to work hard for our 20 or so fish that we caught over 3 days. Not a lot of pics, but these are the best.        We did get a couple of nice males. Lousy shot in the low light, but this was the nicest.    Can't wait until May.."
808277,BillM,2013-09-18 02:32:00,17367,Let's hope the bugs aren't as bad as they were the last time I was up in May!!!    See ya up there!
808281,danc,2013-09-18 02:54:00,4677,  Bill. Those black flies were so bad when I bumped into you. I wouldn't have spent any more time if I had met Jennifer Aniston up there that day than I did with you.
808284,chris.brock,2013-09-18 03:25:00,4053,"beauty fish, you guys really do well for the brookies up there, looks like a big buck tail jig on the 1 guys line, pretty cool  looks like the trees haven't even started changing up there either, seems like a weird year in that respect"

We also found the fishing great this year, once you got through the wind, rain and waves. Glad you had a successful end to the brook trout season. Now we have a lot of time to plan for next year."
