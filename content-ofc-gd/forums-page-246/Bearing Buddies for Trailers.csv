845923,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-06 00:28:00,10439,"Yep, got em on my trailer since new. Trailer is now 23 years old and still on the original bearings. The only thing better are either Turbo Lube hub kits (http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=3841) or the Super Lube hub kits (http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=3731)"
845926,porkpie,2014-04-06 00:39:00,2521,"23 years has to be some sort of record!!  But to answer the question, yes I use buddies and they are very convenient!"
845945,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-06 02:17:00,10439,Amazing what a little preventative maintenance here and there can do.
845948,vance,2014-04-06 02:21:00,719,14 years on my buddies without a problem.  vance
845953,NANUK,2014-04-06 03:34:00,797,"10 years with Bearing Buddies, no problems what so ever. The key is to understand how they work and maintain the correct grease ""pressure"". and  NOT over grease them."
845964,dracokaos,2014-04-06 10:58:00,116,"Ok, Great!  Thanks for all the info  Cheers"
845993,4x4bassin,2014-04-06 14:27:00,1025,"I just bought a triton atv trailer last year and it has the bearing buddies on it , so far so good . What grease do you guys use , anything special ?"

846000,NANUK,2014-04-06 15:15:00,797,"I use Timken Premium all purpose grease. Any good quality/brand all purpose or wheel bearing grease will work, but don't use high temprature grease."
846002,4x4bassin,2014-04-06 15:24:00,1025,"I'm pretty sure I tried to get some of that grease last year Drifter but was unable to find it . Could only order it in a full box which was around $100 and 10 tubes . I will start looking around some more this week and see if I can find some , thanks !"

846005,outllaw,2014-04-06 15:43:00,1232,"great invention. but pulling the hubs regulary and re-packing is sure insurance,and check those inner seals."

846026,dave524,2014-04-06 17:50:00,4508, There's a reason my bearings have lasted 23 years.  How long is the open water boating season up there? 8 maybe 10 weeks on a good year
846027,EME411,2014-04-06 17:58:00,13,My previous boat trailer had bearing buddies and there was never a problem. The Princecraft package I purchased last year has sealed hub bearings. Anyone have experience or heard horror stories about these hubs?
846039,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-06 18:59:00,10439, How long is the open water boating season up there? 8 maybe 10 weeks on a good year  The first 15 years were spent in Southern Ontario. Up here the open water season is about 16 weeks!!!
846156,fishindevil,2014-04-07 10:10:00,6254,"my lund trailer has wet hubs !!!! there is oil inside the hubs not grease...and they are awesome 20,000km at least on my trailer and not a single issue you can also see through the plastic glass at the oil level in the hubs    they all should come like this !!!! its by far the best way out there"
