845998,big guy,2014-04-06 15:11:00,414,"No chance, won't be even close. The new target should be Mothers Day weekend, no joke."
846003,4x4bassin,2014-04-06 15:33:00,1025,"Ya , not a chance !"
846008,captpierre,2014-04-06 16:19:00,2521,auger likely still tool of choice then
846010,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-06 16:27:00,4399,I have a trailer on Rymple and I would not be surprised if there is still ice when I open on May 1st
846013,bushart,2014-04-06 16:39:00,2628,Pike season open on Easter??
846023,irishfield,2014-04-06 17:48:00,26272,Let me give that some thought for a minute....  If 6 mile and the pool are still this tight.. not a hope in hell.

846041,Musky or Specks,2014-04-06 19:12:00,2710,Wayne you let us know when things start opening up. I'm kinda hoping if the Park isn't open by May 5th I can go fish Lakers on the Sound.
846050,irishfield,2014-04-06 20:39:00,26272,"Probably my last opportunity to get out on snow... was cold enough this morning to get across the mud (frozen) from hangar to runway that still has 20"" of hard packed snow on it. Probably a month+ before I get out again and it will be on floats (I hope!), but who knows the weather man's been wrong MANY times before! lol  ..oh and M or S ...start planning to fish the Sound !"
