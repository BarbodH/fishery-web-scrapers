845912,landry,2014-04-05 23:37:00,1005,Sorry to beat a dead horse. Still holding out hope that the niagara below the outflows is not blown out. Did anyone fish it today???? Thanks Landry

845916,miller,2014-04-06 00:06:00,223,Apparently 2ft vis cloudy but greenish. Check out Cast Adventures on Facebook for updates
845920,landry,2014-04-06 00:19:00,1005,Thanks guys. Paul castellano just posted some pics. Clarity is workable. Big Ice chunks in river tonight - may get worse or may clear out.

845946,chris.brock,2014-04-06 02:19:00,4053,"oops, I forgot about the ice on Erie  some years there's very few fishable days down there, like you said, enjoy it while it lasts"
