845184,misfish,2014-04-02 21:06:00,29133,Come work for the Barrie CTV PLEASE.    http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=317273
845188,NAW,2014-04-02 21:19:00,4022,That's not good for the lake...  But hey. That's nature right.  What are we to do.. Aerate the lake during the bad winters....
845190,davey buoy,2014-04-02 21:23:00,5505,"That's sad,not just a few fish either.What can you do???"
845191,misfish,2014-04-02 21:23:00,29133,Nick  Im waiting to see what the kill off will be at the marina. Im sure it will be in the numbers.  Long locked up winter.
845198,NAW,2014-04-02 21:51:00,4022,"It's going to be nasty...    Simcoe will bounce back.  Puslich, might take a while eh?"
845200,misfish,2014-04-02 21:59:00,29133,"I think a guy like Rich knows more about this lake and it,s conditions and how it will rebound.  Rich,you out there? '"
845201,tender52,2014-04-02 22:10:00,270,I fish pushlinch a lot (6 min drive) I stopped by today after work. Pretty ugly! Its gonna be a while to bounce back from this one.
845205,landry,2014-04-02 22:26:00,1005,I live 4 min away. Gonna go look now.
845222,mike rousseau,2014-04-02 22:58:00,4661,"I've seen this once on a pond connected to the main river by a culvert,... All carp tho... Hundreds..."
845223,landry,2014-04-02 23:07:00,1005,"I just went. Pics r below. I fish the lake weekly and love it. I am concerned but at this point it is too early to tell how bad it really is as there r very few open water areas. The spot by the restaurant where CTV was, has very little deep water so maybe fish were more vulnerable there???? I am cautiously optimistic. I only saw two bass in that pile, quite a few pike and tons of panfish and a few nice perch. The lake has a massive population of stunted panfish so if the bass don't get hit too hard, nature could balance things out and it could be a good thing in the long term. We will see this spring. Keep in mind that the Lake Association would love nothing more than to see public usage reduced on the lake so the statement regarding ""avoiding fishing until later in the season"" may be genuine or a self serving statement."

845230,Musky or Specks,2014-04-02 23:25:00,2710,Boy I can't imagine how bad the winterkill is going to be on Bannister and Wrigley if its this bad on Puslinch
845297,SHAD,2014-04-03 03:14:00,134,mother nature can be nasty...have heard she√®s a serial killa
845312,misfish,2014-04-03 11:10:00,29133,That's just nasty Landry. Not just one type of fish either.
845381,Rich,2014-04-03 16:00:00,3927,"It seems bad, but it's only a little worse than usual, in actuality. Usually the snappers, muskrats, beavers and otters are out full force by now and clean up the mess. This year we have to wait for aquatic bacteria to do it in 37 degree water.. it's gonna look bad."
845425,Maverick,2014-04-03 22:19:00,371,"I dont know the lake, is there much ice fishing done on the lake? You would think all the ice fishing holes would provide some oxygen, no?"
845433,Musky or Specks,2014-04-03 22:43:00,2710,"I dont know the lake, is there much ice fishing done on the lake? You would think all the ice fishing holes would provide some oxygen, no? For this lake it is more a problem of aquatic weed dieing off and using all the dissolved oxygen in the decomposition process., As a child I use to swim across the lake for fun and if I needed to rest the weeds would hold you up there are so many of them. The majority of the lake is very shallow so the amount of dissolved oxygen is limited to begin with. All of the ice fishing (or most of ) takes place in one smalls section of the lake around the only deeper basin."

845626,David Chong,2014-04-04 21:34:00,836,"Winter Kills are going to major this year because of the severity of the winter! In the Kawarthas, Mitchell's and places like Goose Bay on Sturgeon are going to be hit hard!"
845627,Christopheraaron,2014-04-04 21:43:00,3525,"A local pond I fish for perch will regularly give up 100 fish in a morning, went this winter and didn't get a thing, think it could be gone for good, the whole thing is only 10 feet deep. Going to be an interesting spring that's for sure."
