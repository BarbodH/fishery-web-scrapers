846230,Christopheraaron,2014-04-07 17:05:00,3525,"I need some Mustad 32760's in a size 4, usually I would turn to angling specialties for these but they are awaiting their next shipment. Luremaking.com doesn't have them, sail, BPS, and wilson's don't either. I'd prefer the supplier to be in Canada so I don't have to deal with customs, but if the company has a good reputation for shipping times I'd be open to guys in the states as well.  Thanks for any help, Chris"

846241,Christopheraaron,2014-04-07 17:46:00,3525,"Chris take a look here. http://chuckanddeb.com/jig_hooks.htm Ya I checked them but they don't ship to Canada.  Looks like John has them - he's in London so shipping should be quick  http://www.freewebs.com/johnsflymaterials/ Just emailed him, thanks.  Here's the folks that I use. http://www.barlowstackle.com/ Hmmm, they don't seem to have them."

846245,bare foot wader,2014-04-07 18:10:00,1354,"it is definitely a chore to find small jig hooks  I have some size 12 tiemco's with a 45 degree eye, I tie them up using the beadhead/pin method, not sure if they have a 90 degree but maybe something to look at if you want small jig hooks"
