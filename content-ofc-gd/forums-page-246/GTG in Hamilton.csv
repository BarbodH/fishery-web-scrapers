845876,HTHM,2014-04-05 21:58:00,4082,It was good to see you again Chris! I think a sit down in your back yard is long overdue. Or mine.... BTW did I win anything? Loonietoon should know.
845927,Loonietoon,2014-04-06 00:49:00,1450,"It was good to see you again Chris! I think a sit down in your back yard is long overdue. Or mine.... BTW did I win anything? Loonietoon should know. No Albert, Just like Tim,s Roll up the rim & play again just like me"
845951,HTHM,2014-04-06 03:25:00,4082,"They lied to me when they sold me the tickets, they said mine were the winning ones."
843490,Loonietoon,2014-03-26 00:29:00,1450,I believe it might be time for another GTG in the Hammer....any one in for it ??????
843496,Christopheraaron,2014-03-26 00:41:00,3525,In. Where this time?
843527,HTHM,2014-03-26 01:21:00,4082,How's about the 477 Wing again?
843539,Loonietoon,2014-03-26 01:33:00,1450,I was thinking more like Buffalo Wings this time off 20 hwy
843559,bigugli,2014-03-26 02:15:00,6138,I'm game.
843566,HTHM,2014-03-26 02:49:00,4082,I'm game. Are you sure you don't mean gamey? Buffalo wings is fine with me.
843587,bigugli,2014-03-26 12:01:00,6138,Are you sure you don't mean gamey? Buffalo wings is fine with me. Only after cleaning fish for 2-3 hours
843791,Loonietoon,2014-03-27 01:35:00,1450,What no one else.. same old same old well at least we know who wants to GTG lets set date for Friday April 11 say around 8 or Saturday April 12 or any other date
844093,pics,2014-03-29 00:30:00,1268,Or you can go to the stelco fishing club awards night April 4th... fish farmer and spiel will be there... they have all the info if you need it... ( the beer is cheap)
844097,Loonietoon,2014-03-29 00:48:00,1450,Or you can go to the stelco fishing club awards night April 4th... fish farmer and spiel will be there... they have all the info if you need it... ( the beer is cheap) Ya but do they have WINGSSSSSSSSSSS   If the others want I'm game
844104,HTHM,2014-03-29 01:50:00,4082,Sounds fine to me.
844135,Fish Farmer,2014-03-29 10:54:00,2234,"Thanks Phil, Sounds good to me. We'll have Pizza and Pepperettes, I'll be there, but at the membership table. Wings would be good, but we would need a thousand Lbs. for that crowd."
844161,Loonietoon,2014-03-29 13:01:00,1450,"Thanks Phil, Sounds good to me. We'll have Pizza and Pepperettes, I'll be there, but at the membership table. Wings would be good, but we would need a thousand Lbs. for that crowd. So What is the problem"
844167,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-29 14:15:00,8243,"I have been following this thread with interest. I wanted to get closer to the date before committing. Now that I have a soft schedule I would like to invite myself if OK with you veterans. Loonietoon I've not met, nor Chris the kid, Albert and Dave I know, biggoodlookin have not yet met as well as pics.  As a few of the ""W's"" from W5 haven't been answered that are fairly important I need to know the when and where. Is it the 4th at St Nicks, no wings, or is it what Loonietoons suggested quote:  ""What no one else.. same old same old well at least we know who wants to GTG lets set date for Friday April 11 say around 8 or Saturday April 12 or any other date""  Or is it at the 477 Wing without wings or Buffalo Wings on Centennial Parkway, formerly Highway 20, sometimes still is.  And when is it, the 4th, 8th, 12th or as Loonietoon suggested "" any other date"". Man you guys are getting me confused which has been really easy as the big six O approaches so stealthily.  First time ever using caps WHICH IS IT AND WHEN IS IT OR IS IT ALL THOSE DATES????  Whew, that felt nice.  Seriously guys when and where? I'll be at The Stelco Club meeting on the 4th anyway, that works for me if I even get a vote. Plus they have 2 comedians that night. See PM Dave if I ever finish this.  Let me know guys, please. I can't eat wings so it doesn't much matter to me. Always room for Pizza as long as it's Roma Bakery's, inside joke."
844301,Loonietoon,2014-03-29 23:58:00,1450,"I'm set for April 4th at the Stelco Meeting hope others will come there. Been before and always have a great time.. Albert, myself who else come on guys this will be fun I know"
844430,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-30 17:16:00,8243,"OK Loonietunes, I'll recognize Albert and stop by for a cold one and meet you as well."
844442,Christopheraaron,2014-03-30 18:15:00,3525,"It's a maybe for me, I'll let you guys know soon though."
844464,leaf4,2014-03-30 20:16:00,2466,"I'll be there with the girlfriends father and her uncle, friends of Spiels.  Just in case anyone doesn't know it's $10 for entry, but I've been told the beers are only $2!"
844503,HTHM,2014-03-30 23:26:00,4082,"I'll be there with the girlfriends father and her uncle, friends of Spiels.   Spiel has FRIENDS!!??"
844510,leaf4,2014-03-30 23:54:00,2466,haha apparently so! since 1981 Bruce has known him as I've been told lol
844516,Loonietoon,2014-03-31 00:02:00,1450,"I'll be there with the girlfriends father and her uncle, friends of Spiels.  Just in case anyone doesn't know it's $10 for entry, but I've been told the beers are only $2! like Albert says Speil has friends Oh No he must be buying them"
844518,Loonietoon,2014-03-31 00:07:00,1450,Flyer says $15.00 at the door but I don't care going anyway
844523,leaf4,2014-03-31 00:14:00,2466,"woops might be, I was just told $10 I don't know if it's an advance price or not lol"
844543,johnl,2014-03-31 01:14:00,197,I might be down for this i will let you's know closer to th event.
