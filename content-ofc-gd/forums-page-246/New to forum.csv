845513,Fishwilly,2014-04-04 11:00:00,206,"HI all,  Just want to say hi to all. Avid fisherman from the Ottawa area. Stoked about picking up new Legend 18 Xtreme w/115 HP Merc Fourstroke soon. Got it outfitted with downriggers and hoping to try my hand at Lake Ontario for salmon this summer. Any advise on this is appreciated as I'm hoping this rig can take the big O.  Tight lines  Fishwilly"

845570,Gallie,2014-04-04 15:59:00,1215,"You have to be careful fishing the big o, a marine radio is an asset because you can listen for weather changes which happen fast. Keep your eyes and ears open always and you will be ok Check out the website weather underground for detailed wind and wave summarys Good luck"
845572,captpierre,2014-04-04 16:33:00,2521,"Welcome aboard.  Lake O can be sweet, or she can kick your  ass and laugh as you drown.  Always get a CURRENT and LOCAL report/forecast.  Winds can be fine at home.  You get to the lake and things are way different  An 18 ft,  deep V hull will be great, but no match for a 6+ ft wave  be safe above all  peter"

845746,akaShag,2014-04-05 13:01:00,2073,"I'm a new kid on the block here as well, and this is a good place.  Welcome aboard!  Just don't start threads about Lake Nipissing, or game wardens, both topics seem to bring out a certain amount of heated rhetoric.......  Yes that is enough boat for Lake Ontario if you know how to drive and keep an eye on the weather.  I have no personal experience with that particular hull and motor, but I am guessing you will need a kicker motor to get slow enough to run your riggers.  Doug"
845983,Fishwilly,2014-04-06 13:45:00,206,Hi akaShag  Yeah also got it ordered with the Merc 9.9 kicker.....now the waiting
846024,akaShag,2014-04-06 17:49:00,2073,"That is a very nice package indeed, and with the kicker is a multi-species fishing machine.  No problem waiting, there is no open water anyways!"
