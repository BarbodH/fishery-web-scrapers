846174,Shloim,2014-04-07 12:56:00,515,On the verge of getting my first fishing kayak and will likely try it on the holland river. Near the convenience store. Any suggestions or recomendations to a better spot perhaps?
846213,Gallie,2014-04-07 15:27:00,1215,Ive never really fished for pannys but i suspect if you hit the docks by the marina and the shores of soldiers bay you could get your fill. Suckers should be running soon if thats of any interest to you. I went for three hours yesterday on the holly for em but still too early i think
