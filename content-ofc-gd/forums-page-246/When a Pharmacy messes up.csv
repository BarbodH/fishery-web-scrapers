846066,Big Cliff,2014-04-06 22:56:00,6899,"When a pharmacy messes up and gives you the wrong perscription then calls you on a Sunday (4 days after you picked up the perscription) and tells you ""DON""T TAKE THOSE PILLS WE GAVE YOU, WE MADE A MISTAKE""!  Who do you report it to? We have been hearing a lot of complaints lately about this perticular pharmacy making mistakes but this is the first time it has happened to us. This mistake could have been fatal to Sue and I am madder than heck!"

846103,Entropy,2014-04-07 00:54:00,747,"I went to the walk-in Dr with a cold and sore chest from coughing, and got some wicked narcotic cough syrup, mouth wash stuff, and 112 Tylenol 3's with codeine.  Went to my family Dr. with a pulled muscle in my back and got some back stuff and 10 Tylenol 3's with codeine.  I'm almost certain the 112 was to be 12.  Heck I only took 1, and 112 is a heck of a lot!  I think typo's must make up a part of med mistakes.  Entropy"

846125,okumasheffield,2014-04-07 01:48:00,318,NO Way!  I thought long ER wait time was all there is for complaints ...
846128,okumasheffield,2014-04-07 01:51:00,318,How do we (I) check if it is the correct medicine or not?  I am not a DR/RN/pharmicists

846158,Big Cliff,2014-04-07 10:40:00,6899,"It was a repeat and we get them in blister packs. Because of Sue's previous heart attacks and surgery she takes quite a few different meds and from time to time there are changes sometimes to the dosages sometimes they switch to a generic (which can have a totally different shape and color). She checked the names and dosage on her pills when she noticed that one of them was different but the description was right so she just figured that they had just switched her to a generic version.  Saturday she wasn't feeling well, tired, weak, I checked her blood pressure it was 85/50. Since the heart attacks she has been on medication to keep her blood pressure down but this was quite a bit lower than usual (normal for Sue is about 116/65. I continued to monitor it but it stayed stable and as the day wore on it slowly started to climb slightly and she started feeling better.  Sunday morning we got the call from the pharamacy, the pills they had given her were to reduce blood pressure! Who knows how low it might have gone had she continued taking the pills they gave her.  Thanks for the link Terry, I will be filing a report today and I will be going in to the pharamacy!"

I now use an inhaler to clear my sinus at night before I wear my CPAP mask...The pharmacist gave me a different one the first repeat and I questioned it right away (fewer doses)...They apologized and gave me the right one...
