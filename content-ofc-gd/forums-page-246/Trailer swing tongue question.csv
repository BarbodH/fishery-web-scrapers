845106,ch312,2014-04-02 16:13:00,1590," If that swing tongue fails (Which it never will) that trailer is going to dig in with all that extra chain and bad bad things are going to happen.   If this was an issue, manufacturers would be doing this from the factory...  Never happens?  2 minutes on Google provided these from various websites:    Bill  I had this happen on my trailer last Fall. Broke off on bottom side of hinge just above the nylock. Bolt stayed in to prevent tongue from opening up. Called company, they sent me some new bolts and said to make sure it was very tight. This really makes no sense because you don't tighten it up against anything. The tongue pivots in the center between the two lobes you are tighting the nylock up against. Anyway put in the new bolt and hoping for the best in the future. My trailer is going on its fourth year of use. I have always carried a spare pin in the truck just in case someone decides they need one while the trailer is sitting in a launch lot. I now carry two pins just in case the bolt breaks again. I don't imagine these 5/8 pins are as hard as the bolt in the opposite hole.  I am not so sure we are looking for a harder bolt in this situation. This just makes it more brittle for this situation. The tolerances on these swing tongues could be a little tighter to allow less up and down movement in the hinge. I am not sure how much movement there is in the tongue while hooked up to the rear of the vehicle. (due to the weight and down force) I would guess that some of the bumps in the road give it some good movement from time to time. I would think the harder the bolt and one good strong jolt of force would snap it easier then say a soft bolt.  Any opinions from some of you others on a hardened bolt in this situation THANKS  A friend of mine has a swing away hitch on his Shorelander boat trailer. The other day he was coming back from the lake and when he stopped at a red light, the boat trailer swung around and hit his truck. He got out to check what happened and found that the bolt holding the hinge part of the swing away hitch had broken completely in two about a third of the way down. Luckily, only minor damage was done to his truck and bent the hitch and broke the crank down jack on his trailer. It would have been a lot worse had that happened while travelling down the highway.  After hearing that, I checked the bolt on my Shorelander trailer and found that it was cracked as well. Another trip or two would have been all it would have taken to have the same thing happen to me. When I went to Bolt Supply to get a replacement, the guy told me these were only grade 5 bolts and should have been at least a grade 8 bolt.  This really did happen, and I am just warning you to check the bolt in your swing away boat trailer hitch before this happens to anyone else "

Better call the trailer manufacturers and let them know they're doing it wrong"
845497,ch312,2014-04-04 03:18:00,1590," Better call the trailer manufacturers and let them know they're doing it wrong  I see you haven't had a job where failing to understand the concept of ""the weakest link"" can mean the difference between going home and taking a dirt nap.    Fulton has this in their installation instructions for their swing away coupler kit:   Why do you think they add that?   Why do you think chains are attached to solid points on the hitch and not the draw bar, which is held in place with a pin?"
845520,BillM,2014-04-04 12:21:00,17367,"Why are companies like Shoreland'r, EZ-Loader, etc not attaching chains behind the swing tongue?    And passing government safety regulations at the same time?    If this was such an issue, why isn't it regulated?"
845525,aplumma,2014-04-04 12:30:00,6896,Common sense is rarely regulated. You can look at it and see that it is safer and will do far more good attached at the point behind the joint. A company will take a short cut that saves them money if they are not called on it pretty common in today's competitive market. Some things are worth arguing but when it involves safety I prefer to error on the side of caution to cause yourself injury doing stupid things is your right to injure others isn't in my book.   Art
845528,BillM,2014-04-04 12:52:00,17367,Let's hope no one here ever has to test it this theory
845568,Fisherman,2014-04-04 15:45:00,7201,I think swing tongues are the weak link unless you check at every use.  That's like you should do a walk around once a week to check all your lights etc.  I'm sure everyone does that too  .  I would be more in favour of a sliding tongue (one inside the other) with an exterior doubler or stiffener.

845585,Crazy Ivan,2014-04-04 17:37:00,184,I don't really get the point of a swing tounge.....just to fit in the garage?    Yes. And I also like that I can lock the tongue back onto the the trailer to make it harder to steal.
845590,Fisherman,2014-04-04 17:56:00,7201," Yes. And I also like that I can lock the tongue back onto the the trailer to make it harder to steal. No different than having a coupler lock, an extra couple of seconds to slow the thief.  I would just take the front of the swing piece off, then there's no coupler."
845658,akaShag,2014-04-05 01:09:00,2073,"VERY interesting thread.  I had to get my trailer tongue made into a swing-away so it would fit into my new garage.  The machinist who did the work used seriously large bits and pieces and had to put a lot of effort into making everything work.  The kit was one from Fulton.  But yes my chains are forward of the pivot, and reading all of this makes me think I should get that re-jigged, even if it is a secondary chain from the primary set back to the main trailer body.  And as Fisherman knows, I am highly assiduous in ensuring a weekly check of everything mechanical..............  Doug"
844146,Cosmos,2014-03-29 12:30:00,588,"Hi guys,  I am wondering if you can give me another awesome advise as you always do.  I recently installed fulton swing tongue on my trailer to fit it in garage. By instructions it says that I have to extend safety chains, I didn't. Friend of mine bought new Lund Fury which came with trailer from shorelander with swing tongue installed by marina. Here is a picture:    I am wondering now if I should extend safety chain or leave it like that. Forgot to add - his is 3""x3"" and mine is 2""x3"" but rated the same 5000 lbs   Thanks"
844148,moxie,2014-03-29 12:34:00,1566,Is the reason because the chains are to be aft of the break? Mine are set up the same way. Only difference is it is welded to the trailer where yours is a bolt-on(looks solid none the less).

844166,Rob,2014-03-29 14:05:00,467,What I did was add chains behind the bracket and in front and crossed them and left enough slack so it could swing away. Works great and still provides t the safety if it breaks.  Rob C
844168,BillM,2014-03-29 14:19:00,17367,"We've got a swing tongue on our Shoreland'r as well (Came from the factory like that) chains are in a normal position, not extended at all.  If you did something on road to shear that bolt off, the trailer being disconnected will be the last of your worries, lol."
844198,Cosmos,2014-03-29 15:30:00,588,So you guys recommend it to leave it like that?  Bill can you clarify?
844202,Crazy Ivan,2014-03-29 15:48:00,184,"I have steel cables instead of chains that extend to behind the pivot point. The idea is that if the bolt snaps, your boat won't pass you on the highway.  Like this (not my photo)     http://www.thehulltruth.com/attachments/boating-forum/243054d1338053114-folding-trailer-tongue-issues-tongue.jpg  I like the rubber coated cables better than chains. You might want to check with MTO about what is required for swing away tongues."
844207,BillM,2014-03-29 16:09:00,17367,So you guys recommend it to leave it like that?  Bill can you clarify?  I wouldn't change anything.  If it's good enough for ShoreLand'r it's good enough for me.
844208,lew,2014-03-29 16:24:00,12766,"My last 2 trailers have come factory equipped with swing-away tongues and both had the cables mounted right behind the hitch.  Personal opinion though, but I much prefer chains to cables."

Weighs in at approx 1,400lbs as it sits. You should be fine. Like Bill said if something happened and it was enough to shear the bolts, the added safety chains would add  is negligible."
844245,ch312,2014-03-29 18:50:00,1590,"While the odds of the bolt and pin of the pivot coming loose or shearing off are extremely low, it could definitely happen as the pivot is the weakest link.  Let's say the pin that locks the trailer in the straight position comes loose because the driver forgot to put in the cotter pin. The result would be a trailer swaying back and fourth which would put a ton of stress on the one remaining pin that's keeping the trailer attached to the vehicle and could definitely shear it off. With the chains attached where they are you'd have a boat and trailer cruising into the ditch or other lanes uncontrollably where if they were attached to the main frame of the trailer it would still be attached to the vehicle.  Having the chains where they are is okay.  Attaching them to the main trailer is the best way.    My G3 Angler came with a Bear trailer that has a detachable trailer tongue. The manufacturer attached the chains to the main frame to eliminate any doubt and IMO is the proper way of doing it.  "
844273,nofish4me,2014-03-29 21:12:00,404,I'd follow reg's on that. No need to over think it. I've seen what happens when trailer comes off the hitch. Lead links in safety chains are a good idea. Hahaha  Just kidding about the lead links.
844283,aplumma,2014-03-29 22:07:00,6896,The force of the tongue of the trailer digging in the road will destroy the pivot point and the trailer will be free with the chains in front of the pivot. The chains the way you have them might as well be made of paper for all the good they will do if your trailer gets free.   Art

844956,didoban,2014-04-01 23:15:00,65,"My opinion only, others may differ. I would keep the chain with enough allowance that you can turn safely.  I would not want that much length of chain. In case the trailer got unhitched, the trailer tongue might swing so far out and pose a danger while in motion or it will slide further under your vehicle and cause more damage. The shorter chain will keep the trailer from traveling farther than you want incase of a mishap."
844963,irishfield,2014-04-01 23:26:00,26272,"Chains are to be at just enough secured length so that when the coupler lets go the tongue gets cradled on the chains for a non event. Is also why you're supposed to cross the chains underneath. Now that said... if my hitch ever pops at 100kph, my chains had better break !"
845055,Crazy Ivan,2014-04-02 12:23:00,184,"The chains on Costa's trailer run through a metal bracket under the hitch. So if the hitch came off, it wouldn't swing out very far."
