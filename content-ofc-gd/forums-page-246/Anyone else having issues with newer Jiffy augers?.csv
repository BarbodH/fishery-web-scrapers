845357,limeyangler,2014-04-03 14:55:00,5204,"Hi all,  Just wondering if anyone else has had issues with the newer Jiffy augers (last 2 years). I have at least three friends who are either selling them or just getting a new make because of issues with starting the darned things. customer service sounds totally uninterested too by the reports. I mean my one buddy got told that the machine is cold, thats why it wont start….FFS….its an ICE auger!?!?  My old Jiffy lightning starts in minus 30C without priming or anything, 5 or 6 pulls , a bit of coaxing with the throttle and choke and she's good to go.  New engines in the newer models?  "
845373,manitoubass2,2014-04-03 15:46:00,11391,I got two friends that bought jiffiies last year and hate them lol. They call to borrow mine all winter lol. I'm not sure what issues they have specifically but apparently they cause Tourette's syndrome lol. Another guy that fishes with us here and there has a jiffy that works nice. Maybe their abusing the machines?

No Gas to worry about, squeeze the trigger and it starts. I won't go back and I am a small engine mechanic!"
845426,Angler management,2014-04-03 22:26:00,280,"My 2 year old jiffy is a piece of junk. Every time i got it started i would think to myself "" looks like its gonna be my lucky day today""! Lol. Needless to say, i just bought a normark/husqvarna with 10"" blade. Wish i did at the beginning of season!"
845429,bare foot wader,2014-04-03 22:32:00,1354,"my buddy has a 3 yr old jiffy, bought it new and he seems to have issues getting it to start from day one  I bought an eskimo z51 2 yrs ago, best auger I've ever used, reliable and cuts quick (busted the handle from an impact, warranty was easy and fast)....I drilled holes for a couple guys with a jiffy my last day out, so maybe they do have some issues  I have experience with strikemaster and eskimo, almost bought a jiffy but glad I didn't, I used to think they were leaders in the ice auger world, maybe not now"

845469,Fisherman,2014-04-04 01:36:00,7201,"Part of the problem with the new augers in general is that the carbs are factory set for ""ideal"" conditions.  Some of the newer ones have a red cap over the adjustment screw,  pop that off with a pair of pliers and open it up about 1/8th to 1/4 turn counterclockwise."
