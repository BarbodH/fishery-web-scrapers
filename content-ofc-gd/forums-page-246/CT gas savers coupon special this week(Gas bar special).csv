845714,supercharged115,2014-04-05 12:00:00,8,I bought three for my boat last year (one for starting battery and one for each battery for 24 volt trolling motor) and worked a charm. Boat is outside all winter and just checked today and all at 100%.  Didn't see any real increase in hydro bill either!

I was skeptical the last time these went for sale, but I haven't picked up my air impact gun since buying the electric. This electric is more powerful than my Campbell air one.."

Thanks,just read a whole bunch of reviews.5/5 for the most part and lasts many years.It's a maintainer,not to be used to give cars a boost!.$17.88 sounds like a heck of a deal."
