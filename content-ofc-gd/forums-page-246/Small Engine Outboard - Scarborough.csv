I have a 175 Merc Black Max that needs some looking into. Turns over but doesn't get going. Was winterized by a boat dealer but not sure what it needs now.  Thanks"
845938,John Bacon,2014-04-06 01:57:00,3277,"Yes, there are not nearly as many marinas in the area as there used to be.  Central Outboard Marine at Woodbine and 7 is not too far from Scarborough.  I think there are few  east of the city too."
845966,dracokaos,2014-04-06 11:12:00,116,I think east of Scarborough may be your best bet. Pickering Marine Brock and 401 is one.
