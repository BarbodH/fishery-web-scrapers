845416,super dave,2014-04-03 20:53:00,323,I'm considering getting an older boat.  The motor has one issue.  Prop bearing needs to be replaced.  Its an older 65 merc.  what am I'm looking at to get this fixed?  Anyone?  Thanks!

845443,Sinker,2014-04-03 23:42:00,8692,I think I would be getting that checked out by a mechanic. What lead to the prop bearings failure? Is there any other damage inside the gear case? ( probably). Have you looked into a used lower unit for that engine?  S.
