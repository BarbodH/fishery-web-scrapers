845589,Oggie,2014-04-04 17:42:00,588,"Hi Guys. My son caught a jumbo perch over 15"" this winter on Simcoe. He wants to have it mounted.  Advanced Taxidermy isn't a possibility, he says it's too small a job. Just wondering if anyone can recommend another taxidermist in the Barrie to Guelph to Kincardine area. He'll drive but he doesn't want to just hand it off without a little feedback from someone. Thanks Dan O.  "

845613,jimmer,2014-04-04 20:13:00,2730,Chris Bowyer in Brentwood (around Angus) is a master taxidermist if he is still doing it. I think he is. A number on the internet is 705-424-6772. He is very good at painting and you should be happy with the results. I was a taxidermist for 25 years and saw his work at many competitions. He usually wiped up with the awards.

He did have quite a backlog of work last time I saw him, which was a few years back.  But if you are going to pay for taxidermy, you might as well get quality work done.  Doug"

I'm getting my 16 inch crappie done in a few weeks by him"
846310,Handlebarz,2014-04-07 22:48:00,3790,"I was just talking to James about getting a couple perch done he had no problem at all. I'm not sure who you talked to but with every dealing I have heard of at advanced they have always done the work. They are very busy right now and running a couple months behind.  Sorry to hear you had a bad experience there. As others have said lots of others out there that are not as busy.  Btw 15"" is a awesome perch."
