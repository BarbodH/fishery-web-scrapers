The past few years I have fished Erie for perch and have really dialed it in (they are easy to find on sonar when they are schooling).  I recently moved closer to Simcoe and want to try some ice out perch with my son (he is asking everday!). I have found a ton of videos...but they just show catching with music...no ""how to"".  I would be very appreciative if anyone can point me in the right direction.  I live in Brampton, so likely Gilford is where I am thinking of fishing.  Thanks in advance!"

845885,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-05 22:41:00,540,I have always used drop shot and minnow...same idea on Simcoe?  And thanks

Plastics work well if they're on, but I always bring some minnows just in case. Much easier and quicker with plastics though. I usually rig them under a float, but must guys dont.  S."
846157,turtle,2014-04-07 10:13:00,274,I fish the east side of the lake and fished perch yesterday on est. 28-30 inches of ice.  The shallow water Virginia -Sibald Pt-Jacksons Pt holds spring perch.. .
846178,Fish Farmer,2014-04-07 13:23:00,2234,You can also do the Orillia Perch Festival starting April 19th. Hoping the ice will be out. This event is great for the kids and big kids.
