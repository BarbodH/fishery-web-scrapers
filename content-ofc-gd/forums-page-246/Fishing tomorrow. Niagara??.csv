However, the niagara looks a little dirty right now - like 1-2' visibility:(  I was wondering if fishing the shoreline in my boat near Dalhousie or Jordan harbour would be a good option and I don't know if there is an ice free launch near Jordan harbour.  Any advice or ideas would be great appreciated.  Thanks Landry"
845726,BillM,2014-04-05 12:33:00,17367,Heard the mudline is quite big and the water temps are just above freezing..   A few guys on spoonpullers have been out and skunked.   I'd be waiting if it were me.
845736,landry,2014-04-05 12:44:00,1005,Darn. Thanks Bill. I really want to get out but who doesn't after this winter.
845750,BillM,2014-04-05 13:08:00,17367,"Yeah, you and me both man...  I can't wait to pull the boat down to Port D and troll around Weller for browns/lakers/whatever.   I've got a new planner board setup I'm dying to get wet!"

Would gave been a decent day, less than 6"" ripple and was 60F here today at my place, 100 yds from the lake.  edit: there is a webcam at 50 PT that gives a good shot of the lake conditions if that is any help.   http://www.fpyc.ca/webcam/default.php "
