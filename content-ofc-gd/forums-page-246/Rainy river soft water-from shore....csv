Woke up at 4am and trekked to look at launches, still another day or two away. Launch on the American side is good though. So i decided to find a shore fishing spot. First spot was good to go, a shallow river bay. The walk down was good until the sun started heating up lol then i was in 2 feet of snow haha. Nice sunny conditions, about plus 5, maybe 10km winds from the east. Water is crystal clear. StRted to set up and d'oh, brought the wrong tackle box lol. Still some decent lures to try. I started out by casting raps and got two nice big birds nests right away! Awesome! After I came to my senses i could see a few pike chasing or turning but not hitting my super slow presentation. Tried to speed up and the wouldnt even look. Then i switched to a Johnson silver minnow and started getting good hits! Sooo good of a feeling:) got 5 good bites and landed all those, ranging from 30-35"". Then before heading home for a quick snack, i see a bigger fish:) i cast to her a few times and finally get her to bite! After a good fish i get her to shore and just as i grab her out pops the hook. Nothing huge but a nice thick fish, pushing 40"". Awesome morning. I'm heading back down in an hour, with the right gear plus the silver minnow lol. I'm hoping my kiddos will come so we can snap a few pics this time:) pretty tough to get selfies with pike haha. I'm just excited, so fun to be out casting again!!!"
