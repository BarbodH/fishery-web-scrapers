I know every time I go shopping I look for items I can use or manipulate to to my fishing need, and I know I'm not the only one. Things like finding soup skimmers in the kitchen area or the local dollar store to use as ice skimmers, or this little find for tying roe bags I found in the wedding decoration area lol. This netting is less than half the price as the commercial brand, with more than double the material. Sure I'm still stuck buying the expensive stuff if I want the colors, but for white, I'm happy  I'm curious what you guys have found, or came up with to save some cash."
845214,manitoubass2,2014-04-02 22:43:00,11391,I buy a lot of beads for making walleye spinners and crawler harnesses at wal mart. Super cheap when ya can find the right ones. I also paint a lot of blades and crank baits myself
845215,GBW,2014-04-02 22:44:00,8460,Some dollarama's last year had some good stock on Northland items.  If ever in a store I too look for anything I can find for fishing purposes.
845218,chefboi17,2014-04-02 22:52:00,128,"I also use 1/2"" metal screws on the bottom of my wading boots as studs. They are much cheaper than the ones from Simms and if they get worn out or lost, they are easy to replace."
845232,knightfisher,2014-04-02 23:26:00,237,"Chef, I buy the food coloring at the dollar store. I'll tie 10-15 egg sacks, put them in a small container, put a few drops of color and your all set. I've caught many good size pike 30'' on dollar store stick baits. Never had one fail. You can save some good bucks on some items."
845246,Gallie,2014-04-03 00:29:00,1215,"My only issue with the cheaper lures is hooks. They snap way too easy, i have changed hooks out on a dollar store popper i got as a stocking stuffer and caught many fish on it."
845262,Nipfisher,2014-04-03 01:17:00,2449,"Knightfisher, I picked up a few dollar store stick baits and when trolled slowly then just don't run true."
845268,BillM,2014-04-03 01:37:00,17367,"I also use 1/2"" metal screws on the bottom of my wading boots as studs. They are much cheaper than the ones from Simms and if they get worn out or lost, they are easy to replace.  Yup, I do this as well, works awesome.  Also the clear containers they sell at the dollar store are great for bags!  Has a rubber o-ring to seal as well..  no gross roe juice all over the place if they flip over."
845279,knightfisher,2014-04-03 02:14:00,237,"Knightfisher, I picked up a few dollar store stick baits and when trolled slowly then just don't run true. I have experienced that with a few as well. Sometimes you can tweek them. Others I have work good. More times than not I'm casting them to the shore lines, trolling when I'm eating or need a break. Looking at the musky on your link, there would only be one or two baits from the dollar store I would use,  and probably not for long.  Different arsenal for those nice looking gals."
845281,Toronto_Angler,2014-04-03 02:25:00,698,This reminds me of a few years back some of the members here had a fishing derby using only tackle they bought from the dollar store. Wish I could find that thread lol
845291,chefboi17,2014-04-03 02:48:00,128,"I've seen some terrible looking rod and reel combos there, I can see it now, setting like a 10$ budget for everyone, and see what happens, I think there would be at least one guy using Vienna sausages as bait lol."
845294,HTHM,2014-04-03 02:51:00,4082,Time for another dollar store tourney...

845317,msp,2014-04-03 11:47:00,1336,For tying roe bags go to Fabricland and purchase some Knitting elastic. Its the same stuff as the spider thread in bulk. ten times cheaper too. you can also buy the scarf material in various colors for mesh
845329,bigugli,2014-04-03 12:52:00,6138,"http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=34786&view=&hl=&fromsearch=1 As I recall, I won that derby with a duct tape wrapped cane pole from D'rama.  Too bad they no longer carry that jig kit in the cool colours."
845350,Toronto_Angler,2014-04-03 14:23:00,698,Haha awesome! Thanks for finding that thread!
845353,manitoubass2,2014-04-03 14:40:00,11391,Oh my gawd that old thread had me in tears this morning! So so funny
845933,bassfighter,2014-04-06 01:06:00,366,"I was at Dollarama few days ago and was surprise to witness many fishing items went up to $2. Swimbaits are over price for $1 a piece. Most plastic lures are way too light due to inferior material used, few larger crank bait in 5-6"" are still fine so better grab them, old stock lures are still at $1 ,until they get sold out with new sticker showing $2. Hooks need to be re-harpened,... very dull. Some stores carry the floating frog which is fine but not available in most stores.  Some larger spinners can spin fine or miss. There are other fishing on line site that provides better quality, price and assortment. For other items not fishing related, DOLLAR TREE at $1.25 has better pricing, but they do not have  lures except ,some cheap fishing line."
845961,misfish,2014-04-06 10:00:00,29133,"I lost my ice scoop last weekend. Tried Wally world and CTC nothing. Then thought about the dollar store. They had what I needed for 2 bucks. I,ll have to remember this next time."
