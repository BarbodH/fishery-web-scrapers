I was planning want to try kayak fishing trip with a few friend at Welland River. All of us never fish there, so this will be our first trip at Welland river area. All or us was interest after watch the fishing show from Italo Labignan (Canadian Sportfishing Show), where he fish on Kayak at Welland River. We would like to fish for Walleye and Crappie, also for other species. Please from all members can give me some information where we can start our first trip at Welland River. Also information about where we can park the car and launch the kayak for fishing walleye and Crappie.  All information will be very appreciated.  Regards, Aan"
