845536,bassinator,2014-04-04 13:26:00,32,Hey all...bringing the family to Disney the beginning of May and was hoping to steal away one day of fishing. Can anyone recommend an offshore charter company whinin an hour or so of Disney. Any info would be much appreciated...thanks Jeff

There's lots of offshore stuff but after my trip in March I'd recommend an inshore day for redfish out of Mosquito Lagoon. The flats are fishable pretty much every day regardless of the winds and loads of fish around - redfish, trout, black drum.  You get to fish light tackle too and boy do redfish pull hard. In May you should find the Tarpon also getting good in the canals and offshore beaches."

He is sending me further into depression as I was supposed to go with himFirst he gets an 11 pound 7 ounce bass. Then he gets the biggest Amberjack his guide has ever seen. ( the guide hold 4 IGFA records )Plenty of fish to be had in Florida if you know where to look. Ahhhhh to be unmarried without children
