Even stayed out in that downpour on Sunday as they wouldn't leave us alone 6-8 fish in less than an hour . Brotherin law landed a nice 32"" and my nephew his first pike ( 20"").That was the season highlight so far .  Out again last night and 3 more fish .  Sorry no pics as it wwas to wet on sunday and forgot the camera last night in our rush to get out .  Lets hope we do as well with Muskie !  TB"
