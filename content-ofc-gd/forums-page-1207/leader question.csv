It worked well and caught fish but I noticed on the pause the front of the bait fell instead of staying flat in the water column. I was tempted to remove the leader but was afraid of losing lures.What do you guys do and have you seen similar action."

In fact I tie the leaders instead of using crimps and swivels (I am lazy however and still use a snap for the convenience of switching lures).  Braid to fluro I use a uni-to-uni knot.  On the other end, instead of a crimp, I use a perfection loop and put a snap on.  This helps a ton!"
