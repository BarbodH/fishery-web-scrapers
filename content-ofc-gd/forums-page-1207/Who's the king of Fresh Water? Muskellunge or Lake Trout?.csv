77554,char finder,2007-05-31 13:43:00,12,"Interesting discussion and comparison. I agree with Marc about crowned fishermen, not crowned fish! The comparison between the 2 fish types is very similar in my books.   I primarily fish for Trout, but I have learned and employ gear and tatics that the average muskie fisher utilizes. For lake trout we used the same reels and rods that muskie fishermen use, baits that are similar in size (one of our best baits last year was a 12"" Grandma made primarily for muskie). Most of our trout were caught in 10' of water or less. All fish were handled and care was taken to ensure they were released to live another day - we do this whether we are fshing for muskie or trout, or any other game fish. I spent a lot of money on gear - whether i use it again or not, it does not matter. There is no price on having fun and it is better to be prepared in any case. As for catching - I don't believe there is any one specific fish that is better than one another. it is all relative to the conditions and equipment used for that day and place - it is more about the ENJOYMENT! but i can tell you the 2 big lakers we caught  last year were crazy! They faught like big muskies without the big teeth!  this one was 59 lbs.   this one was 50"" long by 30"" girth "
77572,Moosebunk,2007-05-31 14:07:00,3970,Chinooks aren't really fresh water fish.  Muskies are cool and all.  Lake Trout are cool and all.  My vote goes to all of them.  They all have their own kingdoms too.
77586,lew,2007-05-31 14:49:00,12767,"We used to fish for lakers in Simcoe many many moons ago, but back then we used short, very stiff rods, huge 1-1 reels and copper lines, so even the big fish came in like old rubber boots, sorta like a broken down car on the hook of a tow truck..  I haven't done too much salmon fishing but get out on Lake O the odd time with friends, and my biggest is only about 15 pounds, and although it took some work to get it to the net, I found it kinda strange to be using such long, very soft rods, and only about 17 pound mono and trying to get control of a strong fish. It seemed to me the gear was inadequate and made the fish seem stronger that it really was.  I couldn't help but think that if I was using my musky gear with some backbone in the rod and some heavier Power Pro, the fish wouldn't be hard to handle at all.  I've caught about a gazillion muskies over the years and have always been very impressed with their nasty attitude and just plain meaness, and nothing compares to their aggressiveness, specially when they hit right beside the boat and go insane, but if they were caught on long soft rods and light mono as used in salmon rigs, they'd take a heck of a lot longer to control also but that's just putting a huge amount of undue stress on the fish.  I'm not saying salmon aren't a tough fish, as I know they are and I hate trying to compare one species against another, but I doubt they'd seem so tough if folks used heavier gear  to control them.  Sorta like going after 6 pound smallies with ultra lite tackle and lite mono line.......that fish will feel like a monster as compared to using heavier gear.  Course this is only my 5 Â¢ worth"

77622,Cowman,2007-05-31 16:05:00,18,I'd say Pike over Muskie but Muskie over Lake Trout
77625,Puckhead,2007-05-31 16:12:00,377,"Ling  I would say sturgeon.  I've been lucky enough to have pulled in kings, muskie, lakers, pike, etc. and they are fight differently - can't compare.  Never caught a sturgeon but the size of those things and the overall esteemed ""trophy"" status of hooking into a prehistoric fish gives it the nod as the ""king"" in my book.  But how can you really compare any type to another - apples to oranges IMO."

Biggest was around ten pounds and I was pretty sure I had a much larger fish on for the majority of the time it took to get a look at it! I can't imagine what kind of fight a 20lber would give! Also, I've caught some cats that just wouldn't give up! One day, I'll target Musky to compare! HH"

77289,kelvarnson,2007-05-31 00:19:00,15,"In celebration of the muskie opener, and the spectacular pictures of them posted today, let's start a debate. The argument over the world's greatest saltwater fish is a familiar one...black marlin, tarpon, sailfish, great white. It goes on.  Not as frequently heard - who's the King of Fresh Water? A lot of contenders, for different reasons.  Walleye - popularity and table qualities  Chinook (King) Salmon - power, agility, speed  Brook Trout - elegance, habitat, intelligence  I'm sure others have nominations. But I'll forward the big 2 in my opinion - Muskellunge and Lake Trout.  Each have strenghts, the Muskie is a legend...the fish of 10,000 casts. Who hasn't heard stories of water skiers getting bitten, bady ducks getting eaten. I remember the first muskie I ever encountered; it swam by the dock I was swimming from. It wasn't big...I've since caught bigger....but it was the way it moved. Just an incredible animal.  It's also great quarry; savy and unpredictable. Explosive strikes...dramatic follows....the 'figure 8'. What a fish!!  But the Lake Trout is in this discussion. When you come to these fish, your notions of what the sport is all about kind of change. Especially if you've been able to catch them in the Northern part of Canada. Not necessarily all the way to the NWT, even the provinces have them a bit farther up. But the agressiveness, the diversity (colours, body types, etc) and the sheer POWER they have astonishes. I was piking a few weeks ago at Belmont Lake and got snagged on a rock pile. I was pulling the boat over to the snag (wind was calm), and it felt EXACTLY like fighting a 25-lb laker, I swear.  So, let's hear everyone's thoughts."

77361,Muskieman,2007-05-31 01:50:00,2472,Ford  vs. Chevy  Lakers grow bigger than Muskies..lakers are usually caught deeper therefore a better fight cause lasts longer.. nowadays people are using more downriggers and lighter tackle to tackle these fish long -gone are the days of an old steel line and a big winch at one end attached to an old blue fishin pole...don't get me wrong steel-lining still works great i still use it on some lakes. I once caught a 35lbs  in Schefferville PQ .in 25 feet of water 10 trilene Xt .7' med Berkley Lightnin'Rod very good fight. it pulled hard at first but soon fizzeled out MUSKY: BY FAR WAY MORE EXCITING!!!!   CATCH A 35LB RIGHT BY THE BOAT IN 8 FEET OF WATER AND 4 FEET OF WEEDS...SUCCESFULLY LANDED AND RELEASED[photo's taken]' #1   CHECK YOUR PULSE  #2    CHECK YOUR SHORTS   I PICK THE MUSKY.   and oh .. when's the last time a Laker has swam up and stolen a Walleye off your line??  i like Laker fishin i do it alot they're in my top 5  Good Luck on the water .

77425,Canuck2fan,2007-05-31 03:23:00,1444,"I don't know if there is an answer to this one. I fish from shore so I will stick to what I go after.  I love fishing for rainbow\steelhead or salmon and from shore in the great lakes with current on light line they are certainly near the top of my list.  I also enjoy fishing for smallies for their smaller size they pack the most entertainment IMHO. Amazing tailwalking displays and the speed of their attack in clear water when you can see then nail the bait it is incredible.  The difference in tackle, tactics make comparing which is the king of my two favorite species more like comparing donuts to tires than apples to oranges.  For eating Perch are the KING though!!!!"
77429,fishdawg,2007-05-31 03:30:00,912,open water chinook salmon for sure!  do muskie instantly peel off hundreds of feet of line in less then a minute? we put a couple dandies in the boat this morning pushing 20 lbs      muskie a close second though - i'll be taking the downriggers off the boat for the weekend - making a short trip up to our place on the K-lakes for a coupla days

77459,Marc Thorpe,2007-05-31 09:47:00,621,"Fishdawg,I want you top take a calcutta 700 reel,lock it right down and catch a salmon on a 10 inch bait and tell me what kinda fight you had,I am almost certain,on impact you""ll snap the fishes vertabrae,the fight will last no more than 7 minutes  To even suggest a species is better than another is relevant to the methods and tactics one uses. to really try and find which species is stronger,one would have to apply the same method for all species  To be honest Salmon fight like Romo's,they run and come back,run and come back on 15 to 20 mono line with soft rods,so comparing a 410 gauge to a 303,its really not the way to compare Firearms and fish  Like I said,I yet to catch a fish with acrown on it,although I have met people who thought they should wear a crown   Tybo,I think a Dodge on Ultra light would beat a a chevy smallie"
77468,Steve,2007-05-31 10:51:00,2075,"my biggest salmon and biggest muskie are exactly 1 lbs apart.  the muskie fight, although fun, didn't compare in the slightest to the fight of the salmon....  it is different though. salmon basically spool ya, wrap ya on another line, or simply break ya.  muskie will thrash, shake, and wrap ya around anything in sight.....  both are fun.  but given the choice, i'd take the salmon......you really see the difference in smaller fish....compare a 10lbs salmon with a 10lbs muskie....with equal tackle.....no comparison."
