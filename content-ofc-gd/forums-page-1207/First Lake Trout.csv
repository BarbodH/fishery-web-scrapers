77192,bbog,2007-05-30 21:09:00,665,Had the day off work so headed up to Lake Simcoe with my neighbour. We launched at Bonnie Boats and followed the expressway to the usual spot. Jigged for a while for Whitefish but there were no takers (for us or anyone else nearby). The non-biting bugs were being a pest (pun intended) and so we thought we would get rid of them by trolling.  Marked alot of fish but didn't get any hits until we no longer marked them    sly devils.  Didn't do so well but did catch my first ever Laker    We were amused when a woman struggling to keep the bugs off ordered her companion to abandon fishing and return to shore. An hour later it was us doing the high speed evasive maneuver!! Still a great day to be out.
