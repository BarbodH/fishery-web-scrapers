77919,marvin,2007-06-01 03:37:00,37,Lake hasnt been that good as of yet. I've been there three times allready. To much traffic. WE got16 pike in total. No real big  ones.  We got into some nice crappie there though. The walleye bite is pretty hot there now. Pike are in the shallows next to the plant. Right at the plant sidw next to the boat launch in those weeds. Good luck. I will be there on saturday morning again.
