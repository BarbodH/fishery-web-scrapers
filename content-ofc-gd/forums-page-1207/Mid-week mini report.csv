77404,snag,2007-05-31 02:51:00,1932,I fish to escape. Always aware of what I'm return for.
76911,Roy,2007-05-30 10:28:00,13728,"Had a bit of a rough day yesterday and decided to go sit on the water for a coupla hours. Launched at 7PM or so and did a leisure, slow trip down river a mile or so. I thought I'd drag a ReefRunner or a Rapala DD behind a bottom bouncer.....hey!, it's easier than jigging. I thought it would be a quiet evening but there were two other guys trolling.   Surface temp was around 57F and I stayed in around 20FOW. Was marking fish pretty well everywhere. Only did  4 or so  1000 foot runs. I guess I got 7-8 fish. I kept  the 3 smallest for the table.   The walleye should be here (in this spot) in a week or two.    "
76912,Terry,2007-05-30 10:38:00,14456,sounds like good fishing  yup you find the fish and the big boats move in to troll around you
76919,misfish,2007-05-30 11:20:00,29133,"I thought maybe this was a walleye report,and it was. LOL  Nice job Roy."

76980,Smokey,2007-05-30 13:15:00,1278,Great job Roy. Been a long time since you've actually posted a fishing report. Hope you enjoy the meal.  Thanks
77014,setomonkey,2007-05-30 14:34:00,872,"Looks like a good dinner, Roy!  I'm not sure if I've ever caught a sauger, how do you tell the difference? I looked it up online and the only reliable sign I could see was that sauger don't have the white spot on the tail like walleye do, otherwise they can be quite similar in colour etc.  Mike"
77020,fishnsled,2007-05-30 14:48:00,3520,"  I haven't caught a sauger in years but I remember that they had patches on them.  If you look at Roy's pic of the fish, it's really prominent on the smaller one.  Nice report there Roy!  I can't believe those other boats moved in on ya.  The nerve."
77163,douG,2007-05-30 20:06:00,2693,"Attaboy, Lil' Buddy!"

77170,Whopper,2007-05-30 20:21:00,2174,"Well done Roy good report.  Last week I caught my first sauger and told the guy I was with ""this fish looks like the saugeye that I catch back home except no white spot on the tail"" and later that night someone brought a couple in to eat and showed me the difference.  Hope you enjoyed your dinner!  Whopper"
77255,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-30 23:14:00,0,I dont think I have ever seen a report from you Roy. I'm glad you got out there and caught some fish!That Lowrence fishfinder looks awesome!!
