Had a tooth pulled yesturday,cracked in three places,caused by biting some 30 pound mono backing.I have always cut/broke off my line with my teeth since I can remmember,but after this very discomfortable feeling,no more.  I hate pain,but ya got to like the comforting meds."

77582,bowshep,2007-05-31 14:42:00,378,Ever think of useing the milk bag cutters. Or to be Manly why not mount a 5 horse motor with a horizontal crank shaft and attach 4o straight razors on to it. It will cut your line fast and you can still use it to cut the kobassa for your finger sadwiches l mean subs. lol   Peace Ken
