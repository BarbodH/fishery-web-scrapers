Turns out it was a better rock bass ""chop""...shallow...deep...didn't matter...  Like I told my neighbor...when I'm out there the only worry I got in the whole world is if some dumb fish gets itself caught on my hook...and if I don't put any bait on it...I don't even have that to worry about...yep...good mental therapy this fishing !"
