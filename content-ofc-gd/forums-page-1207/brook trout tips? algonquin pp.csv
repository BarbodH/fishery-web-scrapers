77863,holdfast,2007-06-01 01:13:00,1813,"Use a small wedding band spinner and worm for casting or trolling.  Panther martins if you have no bait.  In streams a small split shot and worm.  I would take worms, spinners and a small countdown Rapalas for gear and lots of bug juice."
77869,mason05,2007-06-01 01:25:00,258,"If you've got any 2""-3"" salmo stickleback/perch patterns troll them 6 to 10 feet off the shore line.  Good luck man.    Corn Nug"
77874,pikeie,2007-06-01 01:38:00,380,what about any 2 inch rapalas blue and/ or green colour?
77882,danc,2007-06-01 01:57:00,4677, Perfect!!!
77892,Mike the Pike,2007-06-01 02:24:00,3421,Lake clear wobbler spoons 18 inch lead #6 0r # 8 hook with a worm troll slow or slow retrieve.  I f the fishing is slow use a lindy rig with a worm.  undefined  Good Luck.Mike
77902,danc,2007-06-01 02:47:00,4677, Leave the live/organic bait at home please. You don't need it. Live/organic bait only increases the possibility of deep hooking the fish. I can't estimate how many Brookies I've caught in the past 20 years and not one time have I used live bait.
