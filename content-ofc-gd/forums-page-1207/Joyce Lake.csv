My son and I went to Lake of the Woods last summer seeking pike.  Seeking more soltitude, bigger pike and wildlife we are going to Joyce Lake in a few weeks. It's a fly out from Red Lake.   Can anyone tell me what kind of fishing and wildlife we can expect?  I have attached a few pictures from last summers trip."

It looks like you are in for some trophy pike.   Joyce Lake's claim to fame are the titanic trophy pike that inhabit her waters. There's an army of savage Northerns in the 18 to 33 lb. size. This outpost has been catch and release for the pike since 1987.  There are some decent eyes to be had as well.  As far as wildlife and scenery goes...check these links out.  Wildlife Scenery Sunsets  From the looks of it....you will have a great time and i hope you enjoy the trip.  FOTB "
