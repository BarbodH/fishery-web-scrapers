My motor died on Lake O, got towed in etc. Took it into the shop for diagnosis and they said it was a switch box failure. They wanted $383 for it plus tax and installation. I decided to check out prices online and ordered one for $158US.. big savings! Problem is, it's not here yet! Anybody need gas money for LSC this weekend?? LOL -Brian"

I have a wedding to attend out that way in July... maybe we could set something up?  Very generous offer Steve!! PM Returned.  Thanks Mike, PM Returned. I know we discussed the opener/MCI Tourney in PM's but I didn't realize it was going to be in the same boat! We'll talk later today or tonight. Hopefully Steve can bring some homemade pizza LOL!!  Thanks Mike, things are looking up for the weekend! The way I see it, a 55""er will put us in first place and I can be a contributor to the team instead of dead weight. By the way, does this Team #4 cheerleading outfit make me look fat??  He is indeed a class act, we have quite a few on this forum and that's what keeps me coming back!  -Brian"
