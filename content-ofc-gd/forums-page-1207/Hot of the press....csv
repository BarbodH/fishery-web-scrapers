77385,Carp,2007-05-31 02:35:00,1488,Well done Pamela.  Some OFNCers have unbelievable talents (aside from the general angling abilities we share) and you're right up there with the cream of the crop. I can only dream about being able to produce that kind of art.

77419,Mike the Pike,2007-05-31 03:12:00,3421,Very nice painting Pamela.  Here is a painting my wife painted six months ago of a picture of my eldest daughter who is now 12 .  She was about 4 yrs old when the shot was taken on the beach of Lake Nippissing In Northbay.  I wish she had the time to paint as often as you.    MTP
