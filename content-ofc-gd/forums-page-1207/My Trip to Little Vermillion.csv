77326,mepps,2007-05-31 01:01:00,1301,"Nice Job Phil, good to meet you the other day.  I hope the lures I sent worked out well for you and Connie. The weather up here at LV is pretty cold right now.  Fishing has been tough, and staying dry has been tougher.  Luckily Jon and I have both managed to land a fish near 45 inches (we didnt measure them)"
77388,dustink,2007-05-31 02:36:00,526,"Wow, Phil!  That's an awesome report.....thanks for sharing.  Always nice when you can cross something off your ""to do before I die"" list....  dk"
77471,Whopper,2007-05-31 11:02:00,2174,"Thanks everyone for the kinda words!    Clive I caught a couple of small pike on one the baits, Thanks!  Sounds like you guys are getting some of the same weather we got all week, definetly tough conditions but the big fish made it worth the trip. Good Luck the rest of the week!  Whopper"
76949,Whopper,2007-05-30 12:33:00,2174,"On to the fish porn. With the weather conditions most of the week the bite was slow and the pike weren't really aggressive and sometimes we really had to work hard on the walleyes but we still managed to catch fish everday. Verticle jigging and drifting jigs worked on the eyes and every once in a while it worked on the pike to. I probably tied on a dozen baits for the pike and caught them on everyone that I used except for double jointed Rapala and a chub minnow in a walleye finish.  Caught plenty of these for the week   My first fish on a suick  This next shot was on of my favorites from the week  Some of the pike for the week    Last morning woke up the sun was shinning for a change but it was cold and snowing   Last evening of fishing on Friday night, the wind was brutal and man was it cold, still managed to catch some eyes though   Saturday the 26th it was time for the long trek home. Taxi please!   On the way home saw plenty of wild life, two moose and a linx (no pics) and a few deer  Pretty healthy looking black bear    Drove straight through (19hours 45minutes) on the way home only to stop for gas and for some wildlife shots.  Had a great time and look foward to returning to Sportsmans Lodge, Little Vermillion Lake.  Oh and the fish that made the trip for me, well I waited along time for this one.        A special THANKS to Connie, couldn't have asked for better company.  Hope you enjoyed my story!  Cheers  Whopper"
