77072,Tybo,2007-05-30 17:02:00,1373,"Does anyone use the plastic or metal cleaves in the loop of there leaders? If so , have you found any benefits from using them?"
77102,Kanatian,2007-05-30 18:00:00,3,I have been making 3 foot fluorocarbon muskie leaders for a number of years now.  I put a spring loop protector on each end to prevent the swivel or snap from rubbing directly on the fluorocarbon.  I have never had one fail yet.  Bill
77107,tonyb,2007-05-30 18:11:00,1637,"I don't see it as being necessary, Fluoro has great abrasion resistance, and the smooth surface on a welded ring swivel won't create enough abrasion to wear it out prematurely.  Hopefully teeth and fish scales cause more damage to the leader before a swivel wears through it  Keep it simple bud!  Tony"
77111,lew,2007-05-30 18:23:00,12767,"Marc Thorpe uses the spring protectors on his fluoro too Paul, seems to work pretty good for him."
77164,tonyb,2007-05-30 20:08:00,1637,Tybo & Lew...Are you guys talking about these?    So your swivel is contacting the thimble instead of the line?  Tony
77168,Raf,2007-05-30 20:15:00,3495,I'm not exactly sure what you mean either Tybo.  I know some guys put a bead ahead of the knot to their leader so that they can see their line at night and avoid smacking the swivel into their rod tip.
77178,irishfield,2007-05-30 20:47:00,26272,I >believe< Marc uses LIKE the spring out of a bic pen as a loop protector.
77182,tonyb,2007-05-30 20:53:00,1637,I still don't understand what that would protect from or the benefit...I'm confused now  Tony
77186,fishnsled,2007-05-30 21:02:00,3520,"Pictures!!!! We need pictures of this set up.  lol  A pic would be nice to help out, I'm confused as well Tonyb but that doesn't take much.    .  I'm thinking of going to Fluoro this year and the info would be nice."
77321,Marc Thorpe,2007-05-31 00:49:00,621,"  I must admit the Bic pen springs are pretty good,they get em all penned up  Thimballs or springs I used for years,do they prevent wear (I suspect so ) I've trolled the wiggle off of lures and the leaders with or without em lasted.Snaps,go through em like candy,Leaders maybe 6 a year Trolling. Whats more important is understanding wether tying a knot or using a crimped leader with a loop  is more advantagious depending on the fish modd and activity level  When you guys figure that one out,let me know  I did a piece on leaders on the Next Bite season 2 DVD,its also a pretty good show,but you se myself and Dave Fornara making leaders with springs"
77348,Greencoachdog,2007-05-31 01:41:00,8163,Tie one end directly to the hook and the other directly to a swivel and you've got it dikked!!!
77452,Tybo,2007-05-31 06:12:00,1373,"What got me thinking about this, Is at work, Do a lot of hoisting with wire rope slings. The ones with the thimbles in them are for rounder hook, not the type of hook you find on the end of a chain. The thimble is designed to cover a greater area, also help in the wear and tear of movement. When use on a narrower hook(not suppose to do that, Cheap company)  the thimble bends. Which is still usable only for a narrow hook now. Once the thimble is worn through,that a sharp edge appears and start to cut in to the wires.  So I know the thimble will stop wear on the line and have even stretch around the loop.  So i was wondering if the thimble bend or kinks, will that damage the line faster. The fluoro is alot smoother and you will get lubrication from the water."
77460,Marc Thorpe,2007-05-31 09:50:00,621,"Tybo,neither the spring or thimball get damaged,Ive never experienced it Snaps yes"
77530,tonyb,2007-05-31 13:07:00,1637,"Thanks for the input Marc!  I'm gonna have to get those DVD's, I've seen em at http://www.thenextbite.com  Tony"
77540,lew,2007-05-31 13:23:00,12767,"Tony, any idea where those Jinkai thimbles in your picture can be purchased in the Toronto area ??"
77585,tonyb,2007-05-31 14:48:00,1637,"Sorry Lew, I don't....But you can find a kit here http://cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/li...e&noImage=0"
