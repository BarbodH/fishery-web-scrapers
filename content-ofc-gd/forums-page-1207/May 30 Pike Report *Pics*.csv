I thought it would be a good idea to get out and scout after work this afternoon.  Sparrow does not have many big pike and would anticipate 15 pounds to win it for a 3 fish limit.  That being said, in 3.5 hours we caught about a dozen, and left every spot after 2 fish (followers or takers).  Got lots of fish, but none really bigger than 3-4 pounds.  Seeing as it was a tournament pre-fish, I will not reveal much information, but after the weekend, I may update the post. P.S. My girlfriend kicked my ass!!   5 minutes into the day!   Kelli's first of the day   The girl is on fire!   Another nice one   Kelli with yet another   Kelli with another   I got the last one of the day."
