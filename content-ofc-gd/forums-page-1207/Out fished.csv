76055,easton13th,2007-05-28 13:46:00,371,"My father and I headed to the BOQ again this weekend. My wife and son stayed home but my daughter wanted to come. After some convincing she decided to go out in the boat for a few hours with us. As the skipper of the boat she was doing a great job trolling. My father hooked into a small tree, attached to the tree was a spinner, silver and copper colour, my daughter wanted to try it. I changed the treble hook that was in rough shape, topped it off with a chunk of worm and she casted it off. A short time later her rod buckled over, her excitement grew and she fought and landed this beauty.    As a proud Dad and Grandfather, I promised her I would post this.  Easton"
76056,Rich Clemens,2007-05-28 13:51:00,3131,"Give your daughter an attagirl !!!      You see, we don't have to buy all the latest and greatest fishing tackle to catch fish.  The little girl knows exactly what works.   Take a lesson guys - she's taking us to school !!!   Congratulations"
76057,kennyman,2007-05-28 13:52:00,737,"Nice job. I think you better get her a Fishergirl shirt. That's a nice looking Wally there. Don't worry Dad, my boy outfished me last weekend too. I always hope my kids outfish me.  At least my wife didn't. I'd never here the end of that."
76096,PERCHER,2007-05-28 15:03:00,787,Fred give your daughter a big pat on the back.Nice looking walleye.Way to go and get out there again and catch some more.Dan
76118,ccmtcanada,2007-05-28 15:30:00,7971,Great report!  That's a great catch for sure!!  The smile says it all...something tells me that you'll have a fishing partner in her more often now.
76127,Jen,2007-05-28 15:47:00,833,"Awesome picture, sounds like you guys had a great weekend.  Shane knows exactly what needs to be done to keep those fish on her line.  Nice Job Fred...in raising her to fish!  Can't wait to get up there with you again!  Cheers,  Jen"
76270,easton13th,2007-05-28 21:12:00,371,At this time she is more interested in driving the boat! BUT I am sure this fish will keep her interested in the fishing part too!  Easton
76281,Rizzo,2007-05-28 21:33:00,4754,"Sweet fish and report.  I especially like the part about the ""rod buckled over"".  Seems like every Walleye I catch fights like a wet dishrag...they make hammerhandles look like Hercules.  Then again, I'm usually catching them on 50 or 80 lb powerpro.  I have to target these ferocious fish more often!"
76368,fishindevil,2007-05-29 01:45:00,6254,"Well thats one happy little girl...  ...and hey dad doesnt that make you feel proud,she will remember that forever,oh ya and the fact that she outfished you.  ...WTG....cheers"
76376,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-29 02:01:00,2585,that smile says it all!  cheers!
76394,Roy,2007-05-29 02:29:00,13728,"Great stuff Easton. If your daughter's prospective husband is a fisherman, he'd better get his act together if he wants to at least pretend that he can fish better than she can. WTG! Great picture of a happy daughter."
76536,JFR,2007-05-29 15:21:00,498,"Great report, pictures and smiles are worth a million.  John"
76938,Mike the Pike,2007-05-30 12:14:00,3421,Hey Fred I know the feeling my son out fished me on the trout opener landing a 3lb Lake Trout and me nothing but a skunking.I am yet to catch a Lake Trout.Great picture of your Happy Daughter this trip should get her out more often.  MTP
