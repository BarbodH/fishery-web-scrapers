The exam should be done by 11, so right after my buddy and I are heading to Lower Buckhorn, and then coming back the next evening.  We're launching/staying at Bay View Resort. (West shore of Deer Bay).  Plus, we're gonna have a chance to try out my buddy's brand new Yamaha 9.9.  Should be a great way to say goodbye to the school year!"

345807,ADB,2009-05-28 17:44:00,444,Thanks...I'm sure we will.  Hopefully the rain holds off.  We had decent success for bass there last summer.  More numbers than size though.
345811,Billy Bob,2009-05-28 17:49:00,5865,I have done very well there on Walleye's fishing the weed line where the bay meets the channel using black bucktail jigs.
345815,BillM,2009-05-28 17:52:00,17367,No pics of OOS bass please
345819,ozaibak1,2009-05-28 18:08:00,401,I wouldn't mind seeing them.
345833,ADB,2009-05-28 19:01:00,444,"Funny you mention that Billy Bob, because I picked up some black/purple bucktails at BPS for this Monday/Tuesday.  Thanks for the tip.  We will be fishing for walleye, but I'm sure we'll get some bass, and I'd rather have a tooth pulled than go through the whining that comes with posting pictures of OOS fish"
345926,Billy Bob,2009-05-29 00:09:00,5865,"If the bite is tight, tip the jig with just a pinch of a nightcrawler (about 1""). The taste of meat sometimes makes them bite on those slow days. I like the DARK end of the nightcrawler (where the collar) is the best for tipping a jig."
