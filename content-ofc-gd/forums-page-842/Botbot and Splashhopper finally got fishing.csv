I finally started fishing about 6 weeks ago.   caught my first pike of the year on a red devil   and then this thing scared the crap outa me when I wasn't looking,,, the damned frog grabbed my mepps spinner with a mouse tail on it !    Enough about me, Botbot has been busy Training for Taekwondo Canadian Nationals all spring as well.  She won the 2009 Nationals for 11 year old 2nd dan blackbelt (28 kilos)... woohoo!!!   Last weekend we finally got out fishing together at a local mill pond. She likes bringing her other Taekwondo friend with us too.    Nice spot to fish out of the direct sun too.  Not too long after she and her friend were into the bluegils, ""fast and furious""   and again >>   and again   and again.... welll lets just say,  she and her friend fished and i was unhooking them as fast as they caught em !  lol    We hope to put some fish up for our team soon..  Thanks for the great site again.  Splashhopper and Botbot"

345640,Bly,2009-05-28 11:10:00,1556,Great to see a report from the 2 of you again!   Looks like a great day     Hope the shoulder recovers completely.

345646,splashhopper,2009-05-28 11:27:00,2931," Botbot is pumped for fishing again this year... We are gonna try and target as many species as we can from the rivers we have access to.  Doc gave me a cortizone shot, finally ! I know it isn't a repair, but it sure as hell beats the pain at night and limited mobility for the work I do.  Hope to post soon and more often.  Thanks again"
