I would say I am a pretty good fisherman, and I love to catch walleyes, pike and bass. I even find myself on some river trying to catch some trout. I have a question for all of you.  I was thinking on renting a cottage on Golden lake. This lake is located near Eganville, Pembroke area, Does anyone have any advice of this lake on how the fishing is? I will be with my young family- 4 year old son, and my wife. Can anyone help with some recommendations on rentals? Any help would be appreciated; I will soon be posting some of my pictures to show off my skill  Thanks everyone, have a cold one for me!!!!"
