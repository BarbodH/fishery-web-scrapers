345049,ccmtcanada,2009-05-26 18:32:00,7971,"Great to see that you two finally got to meet and fish together after all this time!  I'd gladly fish with either of you at any time!  Even though one lake was a bust, the adventure was still there...and that's part of the whole experience.  Great report and pictures...great looking Pike there Jason!"
345125,camillj,2009-05-26 21:55:00,1988,Esoximus Maximus !!!  Still want to know about the specks though ..... love those back lakes ... great report !
345137,holdfast,2009-05-26 22:15:00,1813,"Totally Awsome Report Solo,  What a Bonus Pike and the Bass are not too Bad.  Love the Picture of the Predator Kill and liked the fact it took you two trips, the second getting the Canoe.  Done that a few times.  Question.  Was that Pike on one of the Back Lakes?  Disd you know that they could be that Size.  Also if it was a Back lake the Pike was caught/ is it a local secret?, or unknown."
345154,solopaddler,2009-05-26 22:35:00,8605," Rob the pike was indeed caught in the 2nd back lake. Not a secret lake (there's not many of those anymore), but lightly fished for sure. In my travels north of Armstrong and beyond I've caught numerous pike that size and larger in some of the tiniest most unassuming lakes you could possibly imagine. So yeah, the possibility always exists for larger than average pike in these small back lakes. They're not pike factories so you don't go expecting to catch one, but seasonally the possibility can be quite high that you will."

345587,Mike the Pike,2009-05-28 00:23:00,3421,That was an absolute pleasure to read this report Mike.What a beatiful Pike.  I look forward to taking my son on  an adventure like that in the near future when he grows a little taller and stronger.  Thank you so much for putting this report together it is a pleasure to have you as a member on this board.  Your contribution is endless same goes for your writing skills .  Now how about this summer's weather  what will this summer bring?
345593,solopaddler,2009-05-28 00:35:00,8605," In my best hippy dippy weatherman voice:  ""Our summer nights will be mostly.....DARK, followed by widely scattered light each morning. Wind? Yes of course! Much of our weather will be influenced by a Canadian low...... not to be confused with a Mexican high!  Hope that helped."
345631,Rich Clemens,2009-05-28 09:50:00,3131,Great report and read Mike.    Thanks for taking the time to put up the report.
344682,solopaddler,2009-05-25 16:18:00,8605,"The Arrival   I recently had the pleasure of spending a couple of days up at my camp with Jason (Basskicker on the OFC board). On tap were a couple of back lakes including a new one for me.  With the ongoing renovations it's really only been the last couple of years where I've had the time to explore the nearby back lakes, many are still completely unknown to me. A few years ago I had a discussion with an MNR biologist in Kirkland Lake concerning a small hard to get to lake just west of my camp. According to him there are natural brookies in the lake. As to how the fishing is or how to access the lake, he didn't know. That's all I needed to know and it was first on our list of lakes to try..  We arrived at my landing to find some unexpected additional fishing opportunities. Can you say high water?     Meat Coma   After unloading the boat at camp and prepping for the next day it was time to eat. Jason had brought a pile of moose meat, I had some pretty decent NY strips. We decided to have a wee bit of turf and turf.    I suffered a meat induced coma after dinner and crashed mightily, disturbing visions of ravenous moose and brook trout haunting me..    A Tough Row To Hoe  The next day dawned perfectly: sustained 60-80km S/W winds, and heavy rain that fell horizontally. (That was sarcasm  ) Still we were there to fish and fish we would. We bundled up for the boat ride across my lake, riding huge swells and whitecaps enroute to the landing.  Fittingly enough after the previous nights orgy of meat we almost had another close encounter with moose on the highway:      I knew where a side trail branched off from the main logging road that seemed to head towards the trout lake. That was our goal, and armed with a gps we started up the gravel road.  As mentioned it was just a bit wet:    The road got progessively rougher and narrower:        I could have easily driven in a bit further, but it was getting a bit too brushy and I didn't want to scratch the vehicle and face Joannes wrath in the process  .  Sooo... we unloaded the canoe and strapped it onto the cart with all our gear inside. Time to pull now.    After about a km or so the atv trail we were on quickly petered out and we had a decision to make, do we portage the canoe in with us, or leave it behind? According to the gps we were undoubtedly heading in the right direction, so we were fairly sure the trail was heading to the lake. I figured the smartest move was to leave the boat behind and walk in with fishing tackle and the paddles. Usually there's always a boat or canoe cached on these back lakes and we still had 11/2km to go, so that's what we did.  At first the trail was great, well defined and easy to follow:    It quickly deteriorated:    Obviously there were some predators about, we found some fresh innards on the trail.    Even though it was a tough slog, it was a beautiful forest and high winds and lashing rain aside our anticipation level was high:    We finally made it to the lake with the trail spitting us out in a meadow at the south end where a creek flowed out:    The big downer was there was no boat. It was already 12:30. We figured by the time we went all the way back and humped the canoe into the lake we'd be running out of time. It's not my favourite thing to do but with no other options we opted to walk the lake and fish from shore. The wind and rain were crazy as we picked our way along the steep rocky shoreline. The brush was unbelievably dense and there were still deep pockets of snow in the bush making progress difficult..  Along the way I crossed this beaver dam to avoid soaking my boots:      I wish I could say we slayed 'em, but we didn't even have a hit. Frustrating for sure as I still don't know whether there's trout in the lake or not. I'm going to have to go back again at some point with the canoe..  Anyhow we gave it our best shot walking almost halfway up the lake casting at likely looking spots. The wind and rain were right in our faces and that didn't help at all. Not making excuses, but it was a very tough go.  By around 4pm we were soaked to the bone and ready to head back out. There were no fish to be had but it was definitely a day to remember and we did see some amazing country.  The brook trout gods havn't been smiling on me lately, I have a feeling next time I'll be due.   Finally Some Fish!  The next day was a complete turnaround, perfect clear bue skies and light winds from the north.  We started out on a different logging road, canoe strapped to the roof and spirits high.        We quickly parked and loaded the boat:    We had a short run to the end of the lake followed by an easy portage into the lake we'd be fishing..  The scenery was amazing and Jason was snapping pictures like crazy enroute:    We approached the small rapids that we had to portage around and stopped for a few casts. No luck, but a nice spot:      We quickly hit the trail and hauled our gear over to the other side.    Soon enough we were motoring up to the north end of the lake where a small creek spills in.  Along the way we stopped and fished a few likely spots.    Finally we nosed our way up into the creek and managed a smattering of fish, smallies, walleye and pike:             While the walleye fishing was surprisingly slow the smallmouth were on fire.  They were in 3-6' of water, and aggressive as all get out smashing most anything thrown their way:            Lots-o-fun! Can't wait to get back there later this spring with my flyrod and some poppers!  After both catching numerous bass we nosed our way into another large back bay. A more textbook spot you'll never see: The bay's entrance was a rocky, deep neckdown protecting the bay from the main lake. In the back corner of the bay was another inflowing creek with 6-10' of water and newly emerging weeds. The temperature was a good 2-3 degrees warmer in there.....just perfect!  We worked the bay thoroughly and very surprisingly drew a blank. Jason was rigged up with a white 4"" senko style bait which he had hand poured himself when we stopped to fish the rocky neckdown at the bay's entrance...  It's pretty obvious Jason has done this before, he just doesn't get flustered, period.  I had stood up in the back of the canoe to answer a call of nature, my back to Jason, when suddenly in mid stream he calmly says: ""Uh, bad timing there bud. I think I've got a decent pike here"".  Decent indeed. I zipped up and sat down to watch an amazing battle. Primarily targeting bass he was using light spinning tackle, not really expecting any major surprises.  This fish went nuts, long blistering runs and I believe at least one sow-like wallow on the surface where she thrashed around wildly. Jason's caught a lot of large pike and even he admitted it was his best fight ever.  It took a few attempts to grab the fish at boatside (not easy in a canoe), but I finally managed, quickly ferrying us over to a nearby rock to hop out for pic's and the release.  Here she is, what a fish!!    43 awesome inches of esox fury! Not sure on the weight, but she was very fat, a respectable pike anywhere for sure.  Couple more shots including the release:      Big congrat's buddy you deserve it!  We worked the lake for a couple more hours and caught fish but it was all kind of anticlimactic after that...  We portaged out and motored back to the landing on a high, what a great day!  Jason's currently up in the Cochrane area for 12 days hunting more large esox, so I'm sure he'll have a few more tales to tell when he gets back.  I'll be back up at the camp soon enough, there's a couple more new back lakes that are calling me.   Cheers,  Mike"
