The morning was a light perch bite, but by about noon, the bigger fellas came out to play. The bowfin slammed the bait as it hit water.   The catfish, on the other hand, were nibbling like dink perch. Just had to patiently wait up to 10 minutes before they would commit. Every one ended up lip hooked. Lots of fun on light tackle. These are a few of the many that were caught.    "

345392,limeyangler,2009-05-27 14:34:00,5204,"Great report Bruce, looks like those fish gave a good battle.  I was fishing on Lake Erie about 6 years ago and we caught one of those Bowfin things...at least it looked similar.....do they also call them 'Dogfish'?"
345406,bigugli,2009-05-27 15:09:00,6138,One and the same

345556,Zubris21,2009-05-27 23:02:00,563,"Wish you had better pictures of the Bowfin.  I've never seen one in person but would like to catch one just to say I have.  They seem like they are a relatively rare species, but I'm told they can be caught in similar locations to largies?"
345789,Mike Pike,2009-05-28 16:35:00,1332,Now that's fishin'.  A little bit of everything including a bowfin!  That first pic looks like something out of a monster movie!  I'm still looking forward to catching my first one.
