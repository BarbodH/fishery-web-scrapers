345385,bigugli,2009-05-27 14:26:00,6138,Was  still slow early this morning.
345431,Muskieman,2009-05-27 16:21:00,2472,got a IPS error for the first 5 attempts ...seems fine now   was very slow loading though.  RFS
345432,johnnyb,2009-05-27 16:23:00,3413,Seemed fine this morning...but just took a whack of time to load....I guess everybody is checking the board on lunch
345433,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-27 16:33:00,10439,Took forever to open this post.
345434,Cookslav,2009-05-27 16:35:00,1457," Ditto, I noticed it takes a while to load compared to other sites I surfed earlier. Seemed ok the second time around though?...wierd"
345436,Cookslav,2009-05-27 16:43:00,1457,"OK I changed my Mind LOL!....just now took forever to change pages, and refreshing, re-loading, closeing down and strarting over didn't help at all. I checked a few other sites and there was no issue, so its definatly just this site?  But of course now....its fine again only 5 minutes later. Hope that helps?"
345454,TJQ,2009-05-27 17:25:00,7806,"They will be doing server maintenance tonite, hopefully all will be well by tomorrow morning!"
345455,John,2009-05-27 17:25:00,2956,"It has been bad off and on today, but better than yesterday. Trying to refresh a screen or swtching back and forth between screens has been OK to slow to very slow to non existant depending on the time."
345564,bigfish1965,2009-05-27 23:19:00,3382,"We have fried memory on the server...I don't know if it is RAM or not...I don't think so by the sounds of the email I got. But they have to replace some parts and we are sharing resources with another website's server  until they get under the hood to make the repair (no idea who, but a big thanks to whoever they are). The only problem with being on the 'cutting edge' of new technology is that few people know how to fix it. Memory problems are really hard to pinpoint sometimes...I know my old personal server had a pagefile error I never found."
