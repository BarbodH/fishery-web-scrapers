Any how... at the moment the tires are a 4.8x12 on a 5 bolt pattern (4.5"" spacing I believe) I want to step up the size of the tire because I want to be able to travel a fair distance with it. Plus all the water is a good 15-20 min drive from home aswell. I found some 5.3x12's for a good price..$70 rim and tire. But will those be big enough if I wanted to go up north.... say 6-7 hour drive ?  If you were replacing your wheels and upgrading... what would you go with ?  I'd like to go with some yokohomas on 20"" rims    hahah but I think thats a little outta the budget   Thanks"
345767,bigpikemike,2009-05-28 15:42:00,52,any tires that fit will be good...mine are the small ones and i have been using them for near 20 years...they need to be replaced and the replacements are the same tiny ones and they r in the garage....and i travel huge distances on them...truely u want the biggest ones u can fit for clearance and less rotation

I had the trailer heavily loaded and had to drive 5500kms. I made sure to have 2 spares just in case. I had a blow out in Peace river Alberta (about 4500kms into the trip) and had a slow leak in the other overnight  after I reached my destination. I would go with the wider tires if they will fit without hitting the fenders, but you should be fine which ever you get. Make sure you have a good spare and look after bearing maintenance."
345778,Nippissinger,2009-05-28 16:04:00,53,"The 530x12's should be perfect.  Tires depend on ur weight. The 530's will haul more weight obviously.  If ur haulin a 16' or less, u will have more than enough support.  I believe the 530 12's are rated for 840lb per tire with a ""B"" load rating...  The ST 145 R12 tires are rated for 1220lb per tire with a ""D"" load rating  So it all depends on ur cargo/trailer on what will work best for you.  and yes, bearing maintenance is MOST important..."
345802,big guy,2009-05-28 17:13:00,414,"  What you have now are perfectly fine, don't waste your money on the 5.3's, spend it on fishing gear and beer.  Just get 'er on the road and go."
345803,Lunker777,2009-05-28 17:21:00,866, hahaha there is always room in the budget for beer ! Fishing gear... well thats a different story !  I have found that 4.8x12 and 5.3x12 are around the same price so Im not gaining any more$$ by sticking with the 4.8s
345805,big guy,2009-05-28 17:27:00,414,"  Oh sorry, I misread.  I have 4.8's on mine as well, but only a 4 bolt pattern."
