344828,bassmaster4,2009-05-26 01:19:00,801,"I am thinking about going there for some pike this weekend but i'm wondering if it is worth the trip. I will be fishing from shore, i heard the weeds are pretty bad this time of year and will most likely be casting x-raps and spinnerbaits, is the lake fishable from shore or will i be pulling in weeds the whole time? Has anyone been there recently and fished from shore? How is it?"
344831,wolfmachine,2009-05-26 01:22:00,89,last time i was there in my canoe i landed a nice 40+ inch pike in the back right corner. its alot deeper back there. thats where the mommas hide
344833,timmeh,2009-05-26 01:23:00,609,"Before you go check that it's open for fishing. I know some of those conservation areas don't open for fishing until the end of June. I'm just not sure which ones, so make sure you check it out before wasting your gas."
344835,bassmaster4,2009-05-26 01:23:00,801,if you dont mind me asking where exactly is the back right corner (pm me if you want) if you dont want to let me in on anymore info thats cool but thanks anyway
344848,CLofchik,2009-05-26 01:33:00,854,"You really need an unpowered boat to fish Mountsberg, not a whole lot of water can be covered from shore."
344850,joonmoon,2009-05-26 01:34:00,528,"Mountsberg is open and has been since opener for Pike. Shorefishing is easier now than later in the summer due to the weeds. The lake is a little high now, the shoreline is flooded a little so wear appropriate footwear. Walking in a few yards is your best bet and fishing the boatlaunch is prolly your best starting point. Good luck and don't forget to pay for launching/parking even if you don't bring a boat. The ticket you will get is large. Read the conservation sign where you put your pay envelope. Enjoy your day."
344853,bassmaster4,2009-05-26 01:41:00,801,thanks for the info guys ill be sure to report back with some pictures of some fish hopefully
344918,jediangler,2009-05-26 12:44:00,1923,"This has been a slower year for the weeds at Mountsberg, along with higher water levels, shore fishing is as good as it gets there. A pair of waders will help you get your casts to more productive waters."
345172,SBCregal,2009-05-26 23:09:00,688,We'll be hitting the area this thursday.  the water is higher than ive seen it in the past like was mentioned.  we were there a couple of weekends ago in the rain and the cold wind and got 3-4 pike and a few OOS largemouth.  make sure  you dont go onto the railway tracks...its private property.  ryan
345297,Fish4Eyes,2009-05-27 06:33:00,1022,Can you launch a boat in there and trim the motor up?
345301,wolfmachine,2009-05-27 10:04:00,89,  it is not toyota friendly
345416,pokerdemon4,2009-05-27 15:24:00,135,No gas motor is allowed.  Only electric.  We were there on monday.  Lots of pike and oos largies around.  We were using spinnerbaits and jerkbaits.  Good luck.
345440,bdox,2009-05-27 16:57:00,329,"As long as you trim the motor up, you're fine. Same with Binbrook."
345469,jediangler,2009-05-27 17:52:00,1923,"The launch is a muddy mess and the grade is very shallow. Unless you have a light enough boat that you can push off the trailer and winch it back on from the waters edge, you'll be in the water with both wheels covered to launch. Getting back out will require a serious 4X4."
345479,SBCregal,2009-05-27 18:27:00,688,"aint that the truth!! me and my buddy were there a couple of weekends ago, with the rain/mud that there was we ended up carrying the boat back up the hill instead of risking driving the van down and not making it back up.  boy was that fun in torrents of rain!"
