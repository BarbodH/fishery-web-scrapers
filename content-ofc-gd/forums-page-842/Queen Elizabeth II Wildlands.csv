Any research I've done comes up with a lot of hiking trail info, but not much for water travel, even though there's a pile of lakes in there. Any info/experiences/feedback is appreciated, as always"

345501,troutologist,2009-05-27 19:38:00,951,Go the the forums on myccr.com and do a search. It has been discussed there. There were/are(?) some fishing lodges or camps on a couple of the lakes. Seems there maybe a potential for speckled trout but more predictably bass.  Don't believe any of the routes are maintained and may present a challenging trip.  I was looking into it when I lived in S. Ont but moved away before I made the trip.

I've been through a few lakes in there before it became a park, but with Fishog access closed and everybody being a parking nazi now I just drive an hour further North to real Crown Land and zero hassles.  For a one or two night easy weekender Kawartha Highlands would be a good choice, either Bottle/Sucker or with a little more work Serpentine."
345521,Nemo,2009-05-27 20:32:00,727,Look for posts on www.myccr. by a guy named Jedi Jeff. He has travelled that park extensively and put up a bunch of TR's.  Nemo

345634,singingdog,2009-05-28 10:42:00,1047,"It's not a great tripping area: the portages are not well established and access is not great. For a short trip in the area, I would reccomend Kawartha Highlands, Poker Lakes, Big East (no portages, great campsites), or somewhere in the Haliburton Highlands water trails system."
