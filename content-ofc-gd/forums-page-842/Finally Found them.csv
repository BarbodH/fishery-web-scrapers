345341,wuchikubo,2009-05-27 13:06:00,1114,Now there's a nice slab!!!  Live bait may catch more but it's not as fun if you ask me when compared to fishing a jig or fly.
345353,muskeybugged,2009-05-27 13:30:00,282,  And less deep/foul hooking.  Nice Crappie though!

345476,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-27 18:22:00,947,"Nope just a small Chartreuse Grub 2"" and a Red jig head to match the body of the grub and a small split shot about 6"" from the jig. i was very surprise to get them on the Grub usually there on minnows til mid June.  The majority of Slabs i catch are about 10-16"".  hehe opps more pictures to come as i hit them harder"
