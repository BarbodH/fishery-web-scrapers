I have never seen or heard of anyone catching them in the bay.  For all of you locals and others, do they in fact exist and does anyone fish for them in Callander in the spring?"
346009,Greencoachdog,2009-05-29 04:07:00,8163,"Surely they do!!!... with a limit of 25 on a Sportsmans license, I don't see how they couldn't!!!  ... but if I'm not mistaken, they're in suspended roving schools and pretty hard to locate!!!... also, they're not your ""jumbo"" type Simcoe Whitefish either, average size of what?... 2-4 lbs???  You'd prolly be lucky to catch 2 or 3 before the school passes you by... IF you can locate them to begin with!!!"

In the winter you will get the odd whitefish but it's primarily herring in that family that are caught.  I would not bother targeting them in the spring.  Like GCD said, they are very elusive.  I wouldn't have any idea where to point you."
