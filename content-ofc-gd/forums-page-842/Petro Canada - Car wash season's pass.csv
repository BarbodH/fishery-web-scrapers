345290,ADB,2009-05-27 02:49:00,444,"Anyone know the price of this thing? They don't advertise the price anywhere.  http://retail.petro-canada.ca/en/formycar/3181.aspx  Figured I'd take a shot here first, since I'm on.  If no one knows, then I'll have to go by a gas station and ask them."
345364,wuchikubo,2009-05-27 13:58:00,1114,About $150 plus taxes.  Good for 90 days.  I suggest to consider it during the winter months not so much during the summer.
345371,JohnF,2009-05-27 14:02:00,3494,I buy a bunch of prepaid wash tickets periodically to keep at the office for the sales staff. We save about a buck per wash that way but they're good forever. It's a great system.  JF
345508,tonyb,2009-05-27 20:05:00,1637,Yeah it would make more sense in the winter with the road salt.
345509,pigeonfisher,2009-05-27 20:07:00,696,We have one here in town that offers the full service wash pass for $30.00 per month.  That was is worth $13.00 for a single shot.
345535,danbouck,2009-05-27 21:10:00,4380,"I paid $130 for mine. It's great, wash all the work vehicles and personal vehicles with it."
345541,BillM,2009-05-27 21:33:00,17367,"Last thing I'd be doing in the winter is washing my car.  Leave the salt, it's not going to do any harm until it's activated by the water"
345809,ADB,2009-05-28 17:47:00,444,"Thanks for all in the info, guys.  I'll probably pick one up.  We've got two cars at home, so it definitely worth it."
