345503,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-05-27 19:49:00,0,shouldn't the southern tribs be just about done with steelies?
345505,bbnotty,2009-05-27 19:58:00,93,yes pretty much done now.
345512,BillM,2009-05-27 20:09:00,17367,"Google maps, backroads road map, let us know how you make out.  A lot of work goes into finding decent spots, not to many people will (or should) hand them out."
345514,CLofchik,2009-05-27 20:11:00,854,"There's some big browns in Whiteman's, you just have to dig for them.  They're pretty wary seeing how much pressure it gets.  Credit gets a ton of stocking and has alot of fish above Norval.  The Grand below Fergus also gets alot of stocking and is full of fish, check the regs for special bait exceptions.   Those are pretty much your best shots around Hamilton."
345550,timmeh,2009-05-27 22:17:00,609,"I second the Grand around the Fergus area. As previously mentioned most of the river in that area is subject to several restrictions (no live bait, single barbless hooks, catch and release only) but don't let that discourage you. The special regs lead to more fish in the water so if you don't mind C & R give it a try.  I really wish more rivers would designate regs similar to the Grand and Credit, it's undoubtedly great for the fishery. It doesn't have to be the entire river just a few key sections would make a difference."
345574,Kenny G,2009-05-27 23:42:00,118,Go to Niagara river or try some pier fishing. You'll get bigger trout at those spots. Kenny G.
345600,steelhead hunter,2009-05-28 00:58:00,152,try hitting bronte I was there last weekend and got fish but you will have to work for them they are spooked big time
345638,justin elia,2009-05-28 11:04:00,151,The Credit River still has steelhead throughout the systems.  Not sure what the rain did yesterday but you may want to wait and let it clear up.  Good Luck.
345832,wolfmachine,2009-05-28 18:59:00,89,"thanks everyone, i think i'm gonna try the upper grand first and see what happens"
