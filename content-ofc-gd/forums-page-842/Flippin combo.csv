Ive done a search, and I know that I can spend like $200 on a reel for flippin but I dont want to spend that hahah I know I need a long rod, 7'6"".  I just want a suggestion of maybe a brand thats a little better/cheaper than your average stick ya know ?  Im also wondering if I can use my spinning combo I have... its a 7' HEAVY action with a shimano sahara 3000 reel.  Thanks for any help !"
