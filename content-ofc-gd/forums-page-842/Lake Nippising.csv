340742,cram,2009-05-12 19:56:00,1733,Gold husky jerks for pike and walleye.  Also jigs with yellow/white twister grubs or minnows for pickerel.  Good luck!
340758,kickingfrog,2009-05-12 20:21:00,8333,When are you going?
340792,Angler16,2009-05-12 22:22:00,188,jig head live bait nothing but caught a 4 pound bass about 12 catfish about 6 perch and 1 10 pound sheepshead. If you wanna get fancy toss a frog into the weeds(weedless from that it) Fished in south shore seems to work for us last time all we used was jigs! good luck
340817,Muskieman,2009-05-12 23:10:00,2472,Which lodge  ...and When... I can give you some advice.
340868,BigGuppy,2009-05-13 00:38:00,19,We're not going to a lodge its a friend of a friends cottage on the western arm of Lake Nippising. We're going this weekend leaving early Saturday morning and coming back on Monday. Another friend has a decent bass boat that we will be taking out so I'm looking forward to it. I will pick up some jig heads and grubs this week. Not sure what a husky jerk bait is but I'm sure they'll know at Bass Pro. I have two weedless frogs so I'll try that as well. Thanks for all the help and any other suggestions would be appreciated. I'll try and take some pics if we're lucky!!!
340906,johnnyb,2009-05-13 01:41:00,3413,"Yep...get some husky jerks, some Gold Williams wablers, and jig heads.  Stinger hooks to go with your jig heads, and put minnows on them....right time and right place...good luck!! Green and white are good colours out there for spinnerbaits when pike fishing....something with a closed eye so you can clip it on to your wire leader.  Any weedy flats are good."
340920,bigugli,2009-05-13 02:00:00,6138,"Sometimes the bite shuts down on the arm, Switch to slow drifts with white, red or chartreuse harnesses right down to bottom in the 10-14ft depths on the many flats or ledges by the deep channels"
