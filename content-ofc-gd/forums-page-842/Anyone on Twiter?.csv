345786,Mike Pike,2009-05-28 16:26:00,1332,"Nope.  And here's an embarassing admission.  For all the times I've heard about it, I still have no clue what it is!!!"

346043,Fish Farmer,2009-05-29 11:49:00,2234,"Isn't that what you call someone??? If it's like Facebooks, don't want any part of it. I've heard horror stories about them."
346073,Handlebarz,2009-05-29 13:19:00,3790,I joined to follow dave and Jp there is not alot to the thing I guess I might delete my account as I can get the same info from Facebook. I dont use my cell for the net and I think that is the main reason for twitter.
