131411,Cory,2007-11-08 13:24:00,170,"Dang, thought I actually had a valid PM there for a moment.  Never a good idea to click on links supplied in unsolicited emails or PM’s.  I delete everything TJ sends me by mail for this reason….You never know what he has included in his always late newsletters.  The IP addy instead of a URL should have been a dead giveaway…"

131669,Woodsman,2007-11-08 23:36:00,1286,I also got one but not form this forum. Mine came from the Ice Fishing Chat Forum. It appears that it is targeting recent posters. Like any unsolicited sales pitch I just deleted it. Warnings on this scam is also on other boards.  Best Wishes: Rick
131673,RsX,2007-11-08 23:52:00,48,what happens now i opened it
131680,dsn,2007-11-09 00:08:00,1018,"  Me Too!! I knew I shouldn't have but I'm always a curious one so I went to the site. The page was blank and my comp froze so I did an enmergency shut down!! By holding the ""ON"" button to shut it down quick as possible instead of yanking the power plug out of the wall. That would have been my next choice.  dsn"
131683,douG,2007-11-09 00:16:00,2693,I clicked the link from work and the network filter chomped down on that one immediately.
