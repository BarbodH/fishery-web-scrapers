I plan on using 2 riggers, 2 planners and maybe some flat lines back 300ft.  Do spoons work of the riggers?  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers"
131956,largemouth,2007-11-09 20:59:00,112,Dr. Death Manns stretch 20's behind planner boards or flatlining. fasttracks or any slim long crank bait with a long lead behind the cannon ball. Worm harnesses behind cannon abll or dopsy.  all the above has put 10+# walleyes in my boat over the years.

Even when we fished with Lloyd Daume last year we went thru darn near every bait he had.... changing every 10 or 15 minutes to find the colours that would work. All that reeling in and out paid off....for the guys out with him the next day ! LOL A dozen hogs in the boat before noon....and it wasn't that pink fairy tail Dr. Death that was workin. Something a little more natural... anything that was close to perch colour, but it will change of course based on light penetration and who knows what else that sets them off.  We ran cranks on the planner lines and williams spoons on the down riggers last year..success on both. This year I have a whole box of Linquist Brother Cisco spoons to try in every colour they make."
