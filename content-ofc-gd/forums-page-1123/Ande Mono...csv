131425,Gerritt,2007-11-08 13:49:00,6129,Thinking of spooling up my Line Counters w/ Ande 20lb test.... anyone have any experience with it? any good?  G.
131428,Mike the Pike,2007-11-08 13:51:00,3421,Thats why your tired you got Mono
131429,Greencoachdog,2007-11-08 13:51:00,8163,"Ande is pretty good line for the price, they use it a lot down on the coast. I prefer Trilene Big Game though."
131432,Uncle Buck,2007-11-08 13:57:00,1000,"when they make trolling flies for salmon... unless it's flourocarbon, they make it out of 50lb ande mono, so it should be good..."
131438,tipupesox,2007-11-08 14:07:00,167,I used to use Ande fishing line on my downrigger lines for salmon.  Never had a problem with break offs .........
131454,Spiel,2007-11-08 14:35:00,9065,....Personally I think it's crap. Since this is soley for the use of trolling why not go with a superline? Back it up with some mono to save $.
131477,Gerritt,2007-11-08 15:18:00,6129,Superline... as in braid? I understand braid is no good for boards....  G
131484,Spiel,2007-11-08 15:35:00,9065, Yes.    Why?
131487,Raf,2007-11-08 15:38:00,3495,"Don't know about the Ande.  14lb-17lb XT is what I use for boards and dipseys for spring trout.  Big game would be another (cheaper) option.  If it can handle a 20# trout, it'll handle a wetsox. (i'm asuming this is for walleye)"
131488,Gerritt,2007-11-08 15:39:00,6129,  The clips on the board slip down the line.... from what I understand  G.
131498,PERCHER,2007-11-08 15:57:00,787,The clips on the Church Walleye Boards works well with braided line.The Offshore boards with the factory origanol clips does not.When I run inline boards I just use 12lbs PLINE Mono.
131505,Headhunter,2007-11-08 16:09:00,5703,"Well, here we go again! I have been using mono with my boards for at least 12 years. I like the way that mono stretch and imparts action on your board and in turn, your bait. I also like the fact that mono will stretch and act as a shock absorber when a big wet sock hits it hard. As well, when fighting said sock, it's considerably more forgiving then no stretch. I've been watching many Quinte reports over the years and it seems to me that a lot of talk about going 6 for 10 or 8 for 12, but those folks are losing way to many fish, IMHO. I think it can be attributed to a number of things; -not paying close enough attention to their rods/boards -hooks not sharp enough -using no stretch with boards. Unless you have a very soft tip rod, your gonna pull the hooks out of too many fish (1 is too many fish in my book!LOL) since most will continue trolling while fighting a fish. It aint complicated, simple is always better. The vast majority of the fish caught this time of year will at least be over 5 lbs... you won't have a problem identifying whether or not you have a fish on. Now if you were fishing in the spring, no-stretch will definately help you identify a 1 or 2lber being dragged behind your boat!LOL KISS has always worked for me! HH"
131507,POLLIWOGG,2007-11-08 16:10:00,835,I use it when I can find it. You notice a lot of stretch on the 10lb if you get a couple hundred yards out. I usually use 15 on the riggers. It will go a season and a half before it starts to break.
131508,Gerritt,2007-11-08 16:11:00,6129,  ok so Ande is crap.....  Big Game or Trilene it is!  G
131513,Spiel,2007-11-08 16:27:00,9065,"....I use offshore releases with braid and to solve the slippage problem I double up a few inches of line then twist it before putting it in the release, problem solved."
131534,Greencoachdog,2007-11-08 17:20:00,8163,  Sounds like a good solution to me.
