Man,nothing but rain and warm temps just made it hard to find them for us. We started our  first day hunt in 47. Opening day is always the best there,but it was not to be this season.  The start of the trail to the bush where we hunt,    Pops and my bro pose for a friendly.    If your wondering about the white hitch hicker thumb pops has there,well,lets just say he now knows to keep it to the side when shoting a crossbow. 15 stitches to fix that learning experince.  The next day we hunt pops back yard,150 acres of prime greens and hard wood.Oh did I say prime.LOL      A shot from pops new house stand.HAHAHAHA    And the sad sight of the deer hanger.    We had two sighting the whole weekend, but no safe shot.  We even thought about using the dogs,well as you can see,we would have to pick them up to get them over the fallen limbs. HAHAHAHA    Acouple other pics to share.        And last but not least,my relaxing time after walking 150 acres each day.    Heres a pics some will remember this hut.Pop still uses it.    Although no kill happened,got to hang out with family,had a great week laughing and having a few cold pops.And the wife got to go to North Bay,in a snow storm.LOL  Well it,s now time to bow hunt. I,ll be out there in the AM."

131912,Terry,2007-11-09 17:33:00,14456,great report looks like a real good time hunting with the family
131930,walleyejigger,2007-11-09 18:38:00,876,"succesfull or not, rain and warmth, is still better than not getting out at all, better luck bow hunting  we also hunt area 47, as of yesterday the 4 other guys havent seen anything but a bunch of moose, one buck walked right in front of the camp on sunday afternoon and all they can do is stare at it,  i'll be heading there monday till thursday  good luck"

131939,misfish,2007-11-09 19:40:00,29133," I dont know about that. Work seems so much easier.LOL Na,it,s great to get out and walk the bush and clean out the lunges. First day is hell,but the rest of the week was easy."
131967,rickster,2007-11-09 21:46:00,495,  got mine yesterday morning had to wait for a good five minutes before he finally left the doe alone and let her get far enough away to get a clean shot and yes I was in full orange when hunting this pic was taken just before we started to field dress it
131976,misfish,2007-11-09 22:04:00,29133,Very nice buck there Rick. No worries about the orange thing. I strip down when Im cleaning my kill aswell.
