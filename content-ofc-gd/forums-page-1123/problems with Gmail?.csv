It won't accept my password for either of my accounts, and one time it did, it even downloaded my messages...but then when I clicked on a message, back to the sign in page I went  Thanks for your help, now I'm off to work.  Maureen"
132132,mattyk,2007-11-10 10:31:00,2110,Hey Maureen  My gmail seems to be working. No problems with passwords or logging in.
132136,Terry,2007-11-10 11:09:00,14456,mine is working
132137,Spiel,2007-11-10 11:25:00,9065,"....Not sure if it'll help Mo but I had to dump my cookies (not as bad as it sounds) before I could access the board this morning, you might try that."
132163,evster,2007-11-10 14:09:00,367,"Not sure if this helps, but mine was doing some weird things, like when I clicked a message another one would open...  I noticed there was a link at the top right called ""Older Version"" when I clicked it everything went back to the way I remember.  If you can get logged in I would suggest trying that!  Evan"
132167,JohnF,2007-11-10 14:19:00,3494, Now that you mention it I've been having login probs for a couple of days. About every second time I tried to get in it would get hung up and give me an error on page message. I was using an old shortcut on my desktop. When I go to my Google start page to do it there are no problems. I can't try the old link now as I deleted it when it start getting even worse yesterday. Could be as someone says here there's a newer version or maybe just a change in the path at Google. If you're using an old shortcut or link you might try setting a new link from gmail.com or from google.ca  JF
