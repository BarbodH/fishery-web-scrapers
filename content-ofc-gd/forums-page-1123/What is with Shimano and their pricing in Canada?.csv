132012,Canuck2fan,2007-11-09 23:48:00,1444,I was just placing some orders online one from Lebaron and was thinking about getting some stuff from Cabelas that Lebaron doesn't have.  I was kind of shocked to see that Lebaron was the better deal on a lot of items when you factor in shipping handling and taxes. The major advantage is the lower shipping handling and no PST from Lebaron on 4 items that were actually cheaper or the same price than from Cabelas. However one major exception was the price on Shimano reels. I was looking at the Pflueger President 6740 reel and the Shimano Symetre 4000. The Pfluegers were the same price from both places while the Shimano is $20.00 more.... I looked back to last year's prices before the whole dollar parity thing happend and the Pflueger's were still the same price. The Shimanos were like 40 dollars different.  I wonder if it is all Shimano or is it partially Lebaron who is giving us a raw deal? I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how competitive LeBaron is right now.... and no I don't work there or own any shares.
132016,bassjnkie,2007-11-09 23:57:00,1101,LeBaron is even cheaper than Bass Pro in Vaughan.
132029,irishfield,2007-11-10 00:30:00,26272,It's Shimano itself. Calcutta TE400's are $200 more in Canada than the USA
132054,KyleM,2007-11-10 01:52:00,218,"As some have done (see the man above) Buy from the US.  Im sick of giving my business to Canadian retailers.  I dont really care if its the retailers or the brands that jack the prices up.......as a consumer, Im gonna purchase most things where its cheapest to me."
132065,holdfast,2007-11-10 02:20:00,1813,"I agree 100%.  Im sick and tired of getting the short end of the stick too.  I havent shopped in the states lately, but when you actually go to a store, and take advantage of their Sales.  Its a huge savings.  Were getting ripped off right to the end from our own people.  For example Cards and Magazines are now covering American prices.  But it sounds like that Cabalas is luring us Canadians for their Prices.  Oh by the way.  Out here I heard an advertisement from a car dealer where hell look and get a car from the states for a fee.  Another Gimmick."

132127,Canuck2fan,2007-11-10 08:34:00,1444," I totally agree with buying where it is cheaper which is why I bought from CANADA this time because my order from Lebaron was CHEAPER. I did not order a reel yet but I would actually prefer to have another Pflueger over the Shimano, just based on how well my other Presidents have worked compared with a friends Symetre. Another reason for not going Shimano is why reward them if they are part of the price gap problem by buying in the U.S of A?"
132129,Guest skeeter99,2007-11-10 09:40:00,0,"always buy shimano stuff in the u.s. always huge price difference even when our dollar was worthless  the only time shimano stuff is priced good and I have only seen it twice was at bass pro shops spring fishing sale, the curado's with a reel trade in was $10 cheaper than the u.s. price  In fact it was so good I actually found old ancient rusted out spining reels and they gave me $40 for each one, so I bought 5 curado's LOL!!!!   except now my gear does not match 6 old green curados realy clash with the 5 silver new curados on the deck of the boat"
132133,mattyk,2007-11-10 10:35:00,2110,that real trade in is a great deal at bass pro in Canada. Shimano U.S. does not participate in the real trade in program south of the border which is sad.
132141,OhioFisherman,2007-11-10 12:02:00,6623,"skeeter99, just your opinion, do you feel the new Curados are that much of an improvement over the old ones(green)? To warrant the drastic price increase?"
