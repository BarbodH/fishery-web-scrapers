131626,douG,2007-11-08 21:31:00,2693,"My Polish is a little rusty, but Raf and Keram can edit this as they see fit.  ""Hi to all you avid fishermen who are fans of fishing with Polish line.  When I saw this forum, I thought it would be a good idea to have our own Polish forum where we can talk about our hobby in Polish.  Unfortunately, we are few and very busy.  Whether or not we can create such a forum, we should be able to talk together and maybe even organize a G2G.  I've registered under the Polish word for pickerel, so that other Poles can recognize me easily.  I'd like to suggest that other Poles do the same, maybe even add PL to their board names.  We did the same thing for our small cars in Europe.  While I am waiting for your replies and opinions, I am adding a picture of my 6 1/2 year old daughter Cory, who is a big fan of fishing.  She is showing a big channel cat, 21 lbs which is close to the Ontario record of 25 lbs, caught in GB close to the Moon River.  Break a rod!""  I think the last is equivalent to 'Tight Lines'.  How did I do?"
