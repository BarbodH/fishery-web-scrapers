132036,douG,2007-11-10 01:12:00,2693,"Deb, I've watched this 30 times over the last couple of years, since Irishfield first showed us this.  I still get smacked each time.  The verse that hits me most is this one:  God forgive me for wanting to strike him. Give me strength so as not to be like him... My heart pounds in my breast, fingers pressed to my lips, My throat wants to bawl out, my tongue barely resists. But two minutes I will bide. It's a pittance of time.  Then I'll slap him silly."
