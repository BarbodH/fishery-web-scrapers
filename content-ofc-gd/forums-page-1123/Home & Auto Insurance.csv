131875,icefisherman,2007-11-09 15:52:00,952,"Try TD. They seem to have best rates as they sell directly to you without middleman. And you'll get a discound for insuring both your house and your car with them.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
131880,Bitsmith2k,2007-11-09 16:11:00,396,Presidents Choice.. my home + auto ins. is less than what TD quoted me just for my auto..
131881,Mike Pike,2007-11-09 16:12:00,1332,"I sorta felt like I was really getting hosed by my broker and the insurance company( Pilot ).  I believe I was one of their ""automatically renew this guy at a much high rate"" customers.  Anyhoo, I shopped around and went with CAA.  Same coverage but much cheaper.  Whoever you go with, shop around.  It's a pain and you spend a lot of time on the phone on hold, but when you're talking about saving hundreds of dollars, it's worth it."

131890,bigbuck,2007-11-09 16:48:00,2449,"If you've got a clean record, try ALLSTATE. Only if you have a clean record though, they tend to take the cream of the insurance business and discard the rest."
131892,Steve,2007-11-09 16:56:00,2075,"Fishmaster, MAKE SURE you disclose that use are using your vehicle for COMMERCIAL purposes.  Not for being honest, but in the event you have a loss during your guiding...i'd hate to hear its the Insurance Companies fault your not getting coverage...."
