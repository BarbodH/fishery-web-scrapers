131554,walleyejigger,2007-11-08 18:01:00,876,"what a PIG, that's terrible table manners"
131558,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 18:04:00,7971,Hey...my co-workers father's best buddy's cousin's barber caught that pike in a remote lake in Manitoba...it was HUGE....anyone want me to post a pic...even snapped a photo of the pike with the fish in it's mouth!!  
131595,mattyk,2007-11-08 19:18:00,2110,looks like a tiger to me.
131189,TJQ,2007-11-08 00:22:00,7806,"I came upon this.. .. pretty neat... circle of life stuff...  <p>  <object width=""425"" height=""355""><param name=""movie"" value="""
131191,Fisherman,2007-11-08 00:25:00,7201,"Jeez, I think he was eating with thoughts of voracious appetite rather than using a ruler to see if it would fit. Looks like he was trying to ram it in."
131195,Muskieman,2007-11-08 00:30:00,2472,  EH!!   pas mal cool..
131197,redx,2007-11-08 00:32:00,60,"Pike eating a brown trout. Very cool, kinda reminds me of river X. I was told some people kill any pike they catch there due to the number of brown they eat. Not a good thing to kill them...  I guess that was not taken in Canada is it? England?"
131200,Joey,2007-11-08 00:32:00,9122,"Oh, not that old video again  Seen that last year TJ, but its still cool. Some people were arguing whether it was a pike or a musky.  Joey"
131242,highdrifter,2007-11-08 01:09:00,2534, Mets-en!!  ahaah  cheers TJ
131250,irishfield,2007-11-08 01:21:00,26272, It's a musky..but I think we need a confirmation from Simcoe Peter.
131253,redx,2007-11-08 01:25:00,60," Sorry, I vote pike!  No hard feelings I hope! Since I'm right!  <joke btw>"
131270,Deano,2007-11-08 01:42:00,767,"Hey, we're sensitive and that is just wrong.  Ha, just kidding  Awesome video. Nature, it's so amazing."
131272,Dano,2007-11-08 01:44:00,719," Lol, thats what I thought too!"
131287,chickenhawk,2007-11-08 02:12:00,612,definite pike
131288,tdotfisherman,2007-11-08 02:15:00,317,"Looks like a Tiger Muskie to me.. anywho.. whatever it is, it clearly bit off a bit more then it could chew.."
131290,OhioFisherman,2007-11-08 02:17:00,6623,"Pig, all them smaller bait fish around! It might have choked on that one!"
131306,blizzcat,2007-11-08 03:02:00,92,haha that's crazy! silly fish being greedy.
131307,Beats,2007-11-08 03:05:00,543,scan through the other videos under that one and watch the one of a pike attacking a guy releasing a fish.
131312,Rizzo,2007-11-08 03:19:00,4754,absolutely no doubt about it 100% positively a tiger musky
131332,TJQ,2007-11-08 03:47:00,7806,Yup muskie... i was watching the poor trout... lol
131334,Musky or Specks,2007-11-08 03:52:00,2710,
131360,bassmastermike,2007-11-08 07:16:00,295,Ya i saw thet last week on Youtube i was trying to show my kids what a pike looked like LOL I had one of those attached to my walleye once LOL
131397,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 12:37:00,7971,"Muskie, Tiger Muskie, Pike....  I like to call it ""Big fish eat little fish""  There...someone disagree with me....LOL"
131457,wuchikubo,2007-11-08 14:36:00,1114,"A young Tiger muskie based on the markings. all the pike I've seen don't have the verticle bars that are so clear in the vid. poor brown trout, I don't think that fish was going to fit entirely in that muskie."
131471,fishindevil,2007-11-08 15:04:00,6254,"COOL VIDEO CLIP TJ..  ...mother nature at her finest !!!!! survival of the fittes,eat or be eaten....cheers"
131483,Kirk,2007-11-08 15:30:00,347,Not to often you see a 40 lb pike eating a 12 lb brook trout
131486,cranks bait,2007-11-08 15:37:00,721,"Note to self.  Never put hands, feet, or other body parts near water again.  Always use a net!!!  Those were some pretty cool vids.  Thanks for sharing."
131536,redx,2007-11-08 17:22:00,60,I wonder if that muskie survived after that... Won't be surprised if the trout got stuck.
