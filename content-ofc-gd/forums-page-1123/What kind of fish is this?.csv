131320,007,2007-11-08 03:34:00,537,"Hey all,  I was just looking through my photos from fishing trips this year and I found these of some type of fish that I caught in Mazinaw Lake, Bon Echo Provincial Park on the Thanksgiving weekend.  Bearing in the mind that I have caught my fair share of small fish this year I thought I knew what they all were but this was a new one for even me!    It's not a common shiner, golden shiner or a creek chub as I've caught those before - what is it?   Is it an Emerald Shiner?    There were lots of them hanging around a fallen tree - many of them were bigger than the perch I caught in there!      Thanks for reading - hopefully one of you will be able to identify it for me and then I can add it my list of species caught!   At least it's a fishing related post!  Cheers 007"
131321,Rizzo,2007-11-08 03:36:00,4754,I have no idea but it looks like it would make fantastic bait
131343,Greencoachdog,2007-11-08 04:29:00,8163,Yup!!!... bait!
131345,Badger Shark,2007-11-08 04:34:00,291,They almost look like small fallfish.  Was the mouth soft?  Not positive though.
131353,Nemo,2007-11-08 05:03:00,727,Check here great resource to ID all your fish..  http://www.fishbase.org/Country/CountrySpe...124&id=2953  If not Fall fish some kind of Cisco or Shiner but the dots in the lateral line scales and the scale shape seem to confirm Badger SHark  
131418,007,2007-11-08 13:37:00,537,Thanks guys.  I'm not convinced its a fallfish though - the colouration and fins don't seem to be right. Badgershark - the mouth was soft.  The band of blue colour down its side was very vibrant.  Any other suggestions welcome.  007
131421,Gerritt,2007-11-08 13:43:00,6129,looks like a Creek Chub to me...  http://www.gen.umn.edu/research/fish/fishes/creek_chub.html  G.
131431,BITEME,2007-11-08 13:53:00,1969,gizzard maybe me thinks emerald shiner but kicking Pike bait
131436,Wes Bender,2007-11-08 14:03:00,105,I am pretty sure it is a mooneye or possibly a goldeye. They are similar and both found in Ontario. MNR site says goldeye are found in Northestern Ontario.
131447,wuchikubo,2007-11-08 14:24:00,1114,"I would say it looks like a silver chub. Macrhybopsis  storeriana.  http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=2792   Doesn't look like the mooneye I caught before, eye is too small. Scales are too small too."
131616,Jon,2007-11-08 20:40:00,209,99% sure it is a fallfish.  An expert told me the pointed tips on the tail and the black pigment on the scales are what he looks at.  Jon
131617,tdotfisherman,2007-11-08 20:51:00,317,"I caught one of those this past summer.. I had never seen one before and I was a little confused.. I just told myself it was a baby Tarpon, and let it go.."
131623,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-08 21:16:00,2585,looks like agood bait to me lol.  that on a hook in some pike water woud be deadly!  Cheers!
131632,kickingfrog,2007-11-08 21:39:00,8333,"It's tough to make a positive id with just pictures but, by keying it out I'm leaning to wards fallfish. The main points I'd use being: each scale with dense pigment anteriorly and fewer than 50 scales along the lateral line.  Or... that's the monster Wayne, Glen and I saw in Georgian Bay the other week ;-)"
131672,Abberz,2007-11-08 23:52:00,140,Looks like a Creek Chub  Great for bass in the summer.
131693,kuhaman,2007-11-09 00:41:00,503,"Yup, that would be a fallfish. Lots of em in that part of ontario"
131699,keram,2007-11-09 00:48:00,585,"I'm not an expert by any means, but I would say it is a BAIT"
131708,Moosebunk,2007-11-09 01:02:00,3970,"I'm with fallfish.  And yep, they do make great bait."
