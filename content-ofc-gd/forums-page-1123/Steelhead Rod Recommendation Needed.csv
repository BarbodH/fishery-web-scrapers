131135,Headhunter,2007-11-07 21:05:00,5703,"Zib, I hope this thread helps you in your decision making process, it looks like there's some good info here, however as already mentioned, I just don't get why trout threads go south so fast? Every time I consider taking up trout fishing and learning more and or asking questions, threads like these make me give my head a shake! I'll stick to the Picker-eyes! Picker-eyes fisherman just don't get all that hung up on stuff, just to catch a 4lb fish!LOL HH"
131161,Spiel,2007-11-07 23:19:00,9065,"....Well I decided to clean up all the childishness in this post so as not to see it go bye-bye. There's plenty of good steelheaders out there and they're not all float fisherman so lets keep that in mind. Zib did ask ""Any other suggestions for a newbie steel header would be appreciated.""   Oh and I might as well add that I'm in the process of retiring my current float rod (center pin) in favour of a new level wind. That should make me the new elitist type in vogue steelheader.  Now if I could only find some cold hard cash for those nifty breathable waders."
131163,aniceguy,2007-11-07 23:22:00,1094,  Lol I understand Prada is making a line of breathables
131303,Zib,2007-11-08 02:39:00,369," Yes it is helping. Thanks for all the info guys.  I'm going to start with a spinning outfit first before I go dropping some coing on a float rod. I'll just have to wait to see how much $$$ I'll have left over after X-mas shopping for the wife & kids then I can buy myself a present or 2.  BTW, I'll most likely go with a St. Croix Avid (9 or 9.5 footer) since that's what I was looking at before I started this thread."
131509,tonyb,2007-11-08 16:16:00,1637,You won't regret it Zib
131511,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 16:19:00,7971,"I'm with you Zib....I just started hitting the tribs a year ago.  I had no idea if I'd even like it, so I went to the fishing show, bought a 60 dollar 10.5 footer, used my spinning reel and began learning how to fish for steelhead.  It wont take long before you begin to form your own opinions about what is right for you.  Good luck!"
131524,redx,2007-11-08 16:49:00,60, I'm self-professed steelhead noob! And I catch few steelhead when the other experts catch 10+!  I don't mind the others telling me what to use or do. I think that ego is the biggest down fall of all fisherman. That and marriage.
131528,tonyb,2007-11-08 16:59:00,1637,I agree Kory...I've fished for them for 15 years and still wouldn't consider myself an expert...there is always something to learn!  And marriage shouldn't be a downfall to us fisherman...choose wisely  Tony
131533,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 17:13:00,7971, I'm a lucky guy....my wife (bly) is just as obsessed with fishing (if not more) than I am!!  She gets insanely jealous when I head out without her....LOL.
131541,Zib,2007-11-08 17:34:00,369,"It looks like I may need to find a lower priced rod. As much as I'd love to have the St. Croix Avid, the $210 price tag is hard to swallow with my limited funds right now. I was looking at the Shimano Clarus that runs $90. Has anyone used the Shimano steelhead rods?"
131547,troutologist,2007-11-08 17:53:00,951,My buddy has had a Clarus for a year or so now and hes happy with it.  Lifetime warrenty as well.
131564,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 18:15:00,7971,I use a Shimano Convergence...i don't think it was any more than 100 bucks.  So far so good on it...not as whippy as some noodle rods I've used.
131597,Bly,2007-11-08 19:22:00,1556,"Zib,  Looks like you are getting some good advice and you have some great waters in Michigan to try out whatever you buy.  I am not sure if this option is available in the size fishing rod you are looking at but a nice feature of the float rod I bought......I can use either a spinning reel or a centerpin.  Nice option for when you are first starting out and think that you may want to change to a centerpin later.    Oh and Cliff......I think ""insanely jealous"" is a bit strong!  LOL"
131634,Milty,2007-11-08 21:56:00,121," Ive got a shimano convergence, 12'6"" 4-8lb rating,..I often use a spinner on it with a float set-up as my back-up,..works great for under $100."
131661,luv2drift,2007-11-08 23:00:00,147,"Spin casters who lobb large spoons, spinners or what ever other hard tacle they use......  I wouldn't consider to be too adaptable!"
131667,lucabrasi,2007-11-08 23:25:00,114,"Hello, new to the board here and I've been looking at a few steelhead rods myself for use with either a cp reel or a spinning reel. The convergence is one of the rods on my short list. For those of you who use this rod, do you use it with a spinning reel or a cp reel.  thanks"
131668,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 23:31:00,7971, I use a spinning rod...no problems whatsoever...if you have a good drag then you're good to go.
131689,Milty,2007-11-09 00:24:00,121," Ive had the rod for like 3 years,..landed many a salmon and steelies on it first with a spinner,..then a pin,..and now a spinner again,..same presntation,...just for use now in tight quarters or a back up set-up to the pin,...I highly recomend anyone learing to angle steelhead on the rivers use the Floating/CP set-up with a good spinning reel first,..learn the rivers and the fish patterns,..and how both behave,...then move onto a CP,..and discover a whole new learning experience,..lol,..but if u can drift 100' or more..and catch some fish with a stellar presentation in water where u will never see a fish unless it jumps,,...by all means bring a few rods with you,...I always bring atleast 2 rods and there is usually a 9'6"" spinner or a 7/8 wt flyrod involved in additional to the flaot CP method!!!"
131700,Canuck2fan,2007-11-09 00:50:00,1444," Definitely go with the convergence if money is tight. Great rods for the bucks and the warranty is good too. I am told you aren't really a steelheader till you spend half a trip fishing with a broken tip... I have been lucky but been there with a couple of folks who just don't get that the rating on the rod for lure weight is not just a suggestion. Nothing like seeing someone take their first cast with a 300.00 plus St. Croix, Fenwick or GLoomis an see the 3/4 oz weight/cleo snap the first half foot or so off the rod.... Seen that on all three of those types of rods. The warranty on those is NOT always over the counter either......  The thing is due to the nature of a noodle rod the chances of having a tip break are a lot higher than with a medium action 6.5 ft rod. So take that into account when you are buying because you might just find yourself buying another one sooner than you think if the company deems it abuse not normal usage."
131865,Zib,2007-11-09 15:26:00,369,What size/type line do you guys prefer using on the spinning reel for casting hardware for steelies?
131919,solopaddler,2007-11-09 17:54:00,8605, Personally I like 8lb on my spinning reels...
131921,tonyb,2007-11-09 17:58:00,1637,I use 6lb in the fall...the fish are rarely over 10lbs.
132014,Canuck2fan,2007-11-09 23:53:00,1444,I use 8lb when the salmonoid are about and 6lb the rest of the time....
130937,bowshep,2007-11-07 04:56:00,378,"My Trout fishing started with the Pocket Fisherman and 1"" long flat fish for Brookie's. Just hand feeding it down the creeks... l like the silence of float fishing... the majestic dance of Fly fishing...but thats my opinion opinion opinion opinion... Zib take away the sand box and you have a lot of options... do them all if you want ... the Trout don't care... just get out and walk the rivers. Appreciate the the sights... have fun... Peace Ken Ps... that's a nice pic... nice fish...it is a Quality shot... the sparkles of the fins and the true Chrome... look it matched well with the lslander CP... l took that shot and lm proud of it"
130940,barracuda,2007-11-07 05:49:00,41,"Original Question at hand: Definitely agree with the avid suggestion if you're going hardware only route. If you want to float fish AND hardware, it's going to be a compromise on both sides. Depending on your price range, perhaps something 10'-11'6""okuma, raven, or frontier?  As for bearings being an indication of drag smoothness...it really isn't. Drag smoothness will be determined mostly by the material/quality of the drag washers in the reel. Having tried a bunch, Daiwa definitely gets the nod for this from me. Bearing count tends to be one of two things: 1. gimmick for crappy companies to sell reels that are inferior to quality reels posessing less bearings or 2. increase in price/retrieve smoothness from reputable companies.  And as far as the debate of float vs bottom bounce vs hardware vs fly vs whatever else: I've done em all, they all catch fish, they each have their own strengthes/weaknesses, and if you want to be a good steelheader, you should learn em all. If I could only fish one way for steelhead though, it'd definitely be floatfishing."
130943,Photoz,2007-11-07 09:29:00,792,"I like my 11.5' & 13' Loomis GL2's . . . .     I use the 4000 Sustains on both . . . .    4 pound P-Line on the 13', & 6 pound Andeline on the 11.5'. My best trout came on the 13' . . . .     15.8 pounds. When it's kinda crowded, I use a 10.5' (8 - 14 pound) St. Croix Wild River with a 4000 Stradic & 8 pound line, so as not to tie up shoreline for a half hour trying to land a bigger fish. But . . . .   there are literally dozens of different combinations, a lot of them likely better suited than mine, and less expensive. Pick a few up, see how they feel to your hand . . . .    THEN look at the price tag . . . .    if the rod felt REALLY good . . . .    DON'T look at the price tag . . . .    just head for the cash register!  "
130971,aniceguy,2007-11-07 12:40:00,1094,here we go again
131027,Darek,2007-11-07 15:26:00,20,"Milty, the guy asked for opinions on a spinning rod for trout. Here you go again posting the same pic you posted in every floatfishing.net thread. WE GET IT, you caught a trout good for you. I love the expert advice even though you've been using a pin for what, a year maybe?"
131028,luv2drift,2007-11-07 15:26:00,147,Personally if you want to get into steelhead fishing...   the only way to go is by flyfishing or centrepin floatfishing.  Spin casting is looked down upon by the rest of the river fisherman it almost seems like there is a hiearchy. And that's just my opinion so no need for a whole bunch of negative comments back.
131031,solopaddler,2007-11-07 15:45:00,8605,"Hey c'mon guys give Milty a break, he was attempting to impart some knowledge and I'm sure his intentions were good. My response certainly wasn't a shot at him... Rule of thumb: don't say something on the net that you would never say to the person face to face. By putting someone down you just end up making yourself look small."
131036,solopaddler,2007-11-07 15:59:00,8605," Well, can't say that I agree here either. As mentioned before the mark of a truly great steelheader is one who's able to adapt to any conditions and succeed using multiple techniques. Not pidgeon holing themselves by ""just"" floatfishing. I suspect that most of the younger guys who're relatively new to the sport here in Ontario would have their eyes opened wide if they broadened their horizons. There's tons of incredible rivers all around the great lakes and out on the left coast each with their own unique challenges. Experience is the best and only teacher... There's no denying that there's an element of elitism amongst steelheaders. However it's usually the guys who can't back up the bravado with results with that attitude.  Why is it that it's always steelhead threads that go south?"
131040,tonyb,2007-11-07 16:20:00,1637,"Eveyone's a self-professed expert Steelheader Solo, didn't you know?  They're not really that hard to catch, especially drifting Roe..."
131064,solopaddler,2007-11-07 17:25:00,8605," True, but 10% of the steelheaders still catch 90% of the fish. And yeah no doubt they're possibly the easiest of all fish to catch, but you still have to time your trips properly, know how to read a river well, and present your bait correctly....  (I normally don't get on the soap box as much as this, guess I'm guilty of being a self-proclaimed expert too  )."
131127,Milty,2007-11-07 20:55:00,121,"  I agree with what you said here wholeheartedly,...In fact about 50% of the time I head out I also bring an ultralite 9'6"" spinning rod,..just have much better results with the floating set-up, however when the bite is strong and aggressive, I occasionally break it out to switch up the fun,..a different kind of fun,...but fun nonetheless!!!  BTW,..none of what you said in response to my post was taken the wrong way in the least,..this is a discussion board and input is what it is all about,..as for the gimps (same ones everytime) that feel the need to throw a jab,...just like u said,..i wonder what they would say on the river,...or not say for that matter...."
