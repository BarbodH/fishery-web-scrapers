If you go to www.canadiantire.ca, you will be able to print off two coupons. The first entitles you to $10 off a $40 or more purchase at any Canadian Tire store. The second coupon, if you have a Canadian Tire Options Mastercard, allows you to save $20 off a $40 or more purchase if you use the card. These coupons can only be used for in-store purchases. Not bad savings!  Coupons are valid until November 18.  Happy Shopping, Justin"
131586,TJQ,2007-11-08 19:00:00,7806,Thats sweet... I was looking at a $29 item for up at camp... add $11 in lures and Get $20 off!!  ...
131587,JustinHoffman,2007-11-08 19:03:00,482,"Better yet - the coupon states:  *One coupon per transaction per person per day.*  If you need to buy a bunch of stuff, stagger it throughout the week and save up to $20 each time. Could amount to good savings!  Merry Christmas, Justin  ha ha"
131631,irishfield,2007-11-08 21:38:00,26272,"My wife handed me the coupon as I walked in the door.... from spending $100 at CTC for flares and misc. Do I now take it all back..get my money back and then go get them to unlock the cabinet again, to get said flares and buy it again and get $20 off ! LOL"
131633,Kirk,2007-11-08 21:42:00,347,"I'd just go back with the receipt Wayne, they're good that way."
131685,pikehunter,2007-11-09 00:20:00,1659,"Hey thanks for the tip!  Ten bucks is 10 bucks, better in my pocket than theirs!"
131690,Carp,2007-11-09 00:24:00,1488,Thanks for the heads up Justin. A couple of things I need to pick up in the next little while.
131721,Weeds,2007-11-09 01:28:00,782,"Canadian Tire may not be the best spot for unusual baits like Depthraiders, Suicks, and Slopmasters but for the first few years I fished it was one of my number one providers. Canadian Tire is a good store in my books, pariticularly when they have sales on tools and car stuff. Also, some of those rural Canadian Tires have some pretty good fishin stuff. Thanks for the heads up."
