131837,Musky or Specks,2007-11-09 14:11:00,2710,Well I like what I hear about spawning habitat. Heres hoping we see some returns on the project. Not to sound like a glass is half empty person but did anyone ask when was the earlest we could expect to see any results.
131910,Ron,2007-11-09 17:32:00,1683,"  August 17th, 2009 is the first predicted fish to be caught.  Nah just kidding, That was one of the questions raised. Statistics show... most juvenile fish are not caught. Saying this, they feel fish won't be seen or caught until they are at least 3 - 4 yrs of age. Correct me if I'm wrong but that would put the muskie at around 24-30 inches.  http://mdc.mo.gov/fish/sport/muskie/habitat.htm"
131929,capt bruce,2007-11-09 18:23:00,820,"A Thank you to the mods allso for leaveing this thread up when at first it appeared to be heading south . It didnt head south and I for one got a lot of info that i didnt have before . Thanks to the muskies canada guys and Marc etc. for not getting into it and presenting the info . Weather you agree with the project or not I cant say enough good things about these guys who give their time and labour for projects like this, keep up the good work , I allso like Terry want to know how we can sign up ,show up , what ever , to help out in the spring ?Just because I think maybe other projects have more value , Ive been known to  be wrong in the past (ask my wife) and if this many good people think this is the way to go , im more than willing to help out and see things first hand . Please let us know Chris or Ron , lots of good people on the board im sure would want to help out ."
131966,Chris Purdy,2007-11-09 21:37:00,7,"For those who are interested in helping out next spring: either Ron or I will post something a little closer to the time (Apr/May - depends on the weather).  At the risk of sounding like I'm flogging the site, keep an eye on the MCI website (www.muskiescanada.ca) for more reports about the project as well as a heads up about volunteers next spring.  While Ron captured the highlights of Jason's presentation, he barely scratched the surface.  Had we all not kept quiet at one point, I'm sure the meeting would have lasted 4 hours - great to see the level of interest and enthusiasm that the project is generating.  I was especially mindful of the questions that had been raised here regarding habitat in the Lake.  Jason quickly allayed any concerns when he described a number of area's that were ""excellent"" habitat for the stocking that has been completed and for what is planned in the near future.  Thanks to all who came out and congratulations to all of the folks who have worked so hard on this project.  Chris"
132161,Terry,2007-11-10 13:59:00,14456,thanks for posting the info  I hope the date are posted as early a possible to I can fit them into my schedule
130540,capt bruce,2007-11-06 16:47:00,820,"Thanks Marc , you again show why your a well respected member of this forum or any forum you would care to share in. BUT perhaps I should remind you there were historically t-rexs in Alberta , hairy elephants in alaska , alantics in lake o , etc. etc. that was than (dont we all long to go back)  this is now . If all the money spent in taxes on fishhing went to fishing as it should we may be able to try to regain the past BUT IT AINT . and the small amount of cash and people power we do have needs to go towards just slowing down the losses . Time for clubs instaed of taking over hatcherys maybe should be thinking of buying /taking over  - what ever it takes - spawning habitat , wetlands etc. We need to make sure the very things these fish need to survive are preserved , This lake after lake every inch of shore line bought up , every little creek and inlet drained , every wetland swamp drained ,has to stop , we dont have the money to keep putting bandadges on the  wounds . And I think the lake simco muskie restoration is just that a rather large bandage, on a lake thats screaming in pain .."
130949,Marc Thorpe,2007-11-07 10:03:00,621,"Hi Bruce,muskies did not become extinct They were pilfered into Oblivian,by mankind  Atlantics suffered the same fate and the buildings of dams sealed their fate  I fully understand that Simcoe is screaming in pain,due to fishing pressure,home owner incroachement and farmland drain offs I dont think monnies accumalated from licenses in the province suffice to manage the entire provincial resource.Buying up land or lake front property,is far out of reach for organizations  Your damn if you and your dammed if you dont,in this case I consider being part of the solution is far better than being part of the problem"
131759,Bruski,2007-11-09 03:54:00,5,"I'm not much of a 'poster' on this site, but do check in from time to time.  Great thread, nice to hear the many opinions on the matter.   I'm also a member of Muskies Canada Hamilton Chapter.  Part of the reason for joining the group a few years ago was to learn more about this whole fishing thing and obviously Muskie fishing.  At the beginning I really didn't care much for the group as I didn't know what they did.  It's been a real adventure thus far and the future looks good too.  I've developed genuine respect for MCI's efforts over the years.  Quite frankly I would be just as happy helping out with other efforts and work with other fish species like Trout, Bass or even Carp.  I like to fish for them too.  Well on Wednesday I got in the truck and drove out to the Toronto MCI chapter meeting.  I would of gone to it even if I wasn't a member of MCI after reading this thread and knowing there was an 'invite from the group'.  The presentation by Jason Borwick on the status of the project was great!  It really gave me in-site into the passion and dedication some people have in this project.  Mr. Purdy was also at the meeting.  In fact I think I sat beside him while Jason was presenting.  At one point, the amount of questions from the group almost overtook the presentation and we had to ease up on Jason, so that he could finish presenting.  It was great to see a really active meeting with much discussion.  Reading this thread really helped contribute to the development of my own opinion.  I too was concerned about the viability of such an undertaking.  The idea of all this effort just to create a put/grow/take fishery didn't sit well with me.  So, I had a list of questions and concerns that I took with me to the meeting.  I'm glad I went and not only did I get answers, but I was able see other aspects of the project I wasn't aware of.  There were a few questions on habitat and all I can say is that they have done their homework.  Five locations on the lake are great for Muskie spawning and this is where the fish were installed.  Other less adequate locations have also been identified and more habitat surveys are going to be done next year.  These are my thoughts so far and I hope they contribute to your thoughts on the matter.  Bruno..."
131770,Ron,2007-11-09 05:24:00,1683,"The minute I get badgered for posting this information, it will get deleted just as fast.  We had an extraordinary presentation on the Project from Jason Borwick. Some great information has come out which I will be working on to submit to the MCI web page. For the time being, I have dug up a link which Jason also presented. It was on our local ch 12 news.  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/articles/Newsw...skieProject.WMV  He also had some excellent photos in his presentation as well. Here is one of them.    If you look closely at the dorsal fin, you will see one of the tags they insert into the fish for future data collecting.   Only one muskie has been recorded to have been caught with a tag, first time by a MCI member and remarkably a second time by another angler.  With all the netting they have done, they have yet to have caught another tagged muskie. (I think they have caught and tagged 59).  With this only being in the 3rd yr, the data collected can start to form useful information.  Some of the info I recall off hand, just don't quote me for the accuracy!  There have been 11 different pairs introduced, well on our way for 0% chance of genetic mutation, (my own words).  Existing habitat will sustain a viable healthy population, more habitat improvements are still planned though.  There has been a successful amount of stocking this year with over 1500 muskie stocked from 5 different parents.  There has also been muskie fingerling released back into Georgian Bay. The reason for this is due to the VHS waters where these fish were raised.  They have stocked fish in 6 different areas which has excellent habitat for muskie reproduction.  Unfortunately for Wisconsin, who have contributed a good chunk of change towards this project in return for muskie fingerling for their program, did not receive their portion.  This project has potential for lots of other projects, saying that the monies spent on setting the tanks and such up is already an investment where money won't have to be spent on again.   This project has been funded by numerous sources. Not only Muskies Canada, but also Canadian National Sportmen's Show, Sir Sanford Fleming College, Fishing Forever (Bob Izumi Outdoors), MCI Muskie Odyssey, One of our founding members, Paul Gasbarino personally donated an exceptional amount as well.  I am sure there is more but this is what I have recalled so far.  Be sure to check out the News coverage.  It was nice meeting you Bruno, nice to out a face to a name."
131789,Marc Thorpe,2007-11-09 12:41:00,621,"Ron,thanks once again for the info Kudos once again to all involved for attaining the level of success this year TKS Ron and Bruski for the info on spawning areas  Great public education on a project"
131810,mattyk,2007-11-09 13:20:00,2110,looks like there is some good work that is being done by all who are invovled! Its great to see.
131832,Terry,2007-11-09 13:59:00,14456,I couldn't find anywhere to sign up or get info on helping with the project in the spring
129859,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-04 15:16:00,2585,if it ever gets up and running the only way it will survive is if its a strictly catch and release lake.  There is way to much fishing pressure on that lake for muskie to survive anything but c and r.  My 2 cents anyway.  CHeers!
129866,musky66,2007-11-04 15:30:00,273,"What a topic! I certainly hope the stocking is sucessful as I think we could someday see very large fish in Simcoe- who cares if they are hard to find...that is the nature of Musky fishing. It took me four years to get my first 'ski from Georgian Bay- a memory that will last forever! Keep up the great work boys, learn from your mistakes and carry on. My son and I will be out again in the spring to help with the nets."
129952,Ron,2007-11-04 20:42:00,1683,"Well, Muskies Canada is working on the RESTORATION of Muskies in Lake Simcoe, not restocking of Simcoe.  There was a time when Muskie flourished very well in Simcoe but to over harvest and habitat loss the population has declined.  MCI along with several other clubs, organizations, Colleges and government have been working together to reconstruct the sustainable population.    In order to have a project like this get approved, there is protocol which has to be followed, I am sure Marc would know about this as he was one of the guys who first started this Simcoe Project. I am just glad he was involved in such an early stage with his knowledge, chances are the project wouldn’t be where it is today.  Yes, I agree the project has been in the working for several years now. If this project was strictly a stocking project, it would have been successful long ago.  MCI and others are interested in restoring with a strain of muskie that are not genetically altered. We are interested in seeing a viable population that will end up being a self sustaining population.  Some of the stocking programs in other areas are just that, a stocking program for PUT GROW and TAKE.  But this project is a restoration project, hence there has been some habitat restoration in some areas . There will be more habitat restoration to come. MCI is taking this project as one of it’s largest projects ever. There is a lot at stake here. Reintroduction of close to or probably over 2000 (the actual numbers have not been released at this time) muskie is just a start. There has been a moratorium on fishing for muskie on Simcoe and Couch until the year 2010 where a futher extension may be applied if deems necessary. This will reduce the angling pressure until such a time where this project is either a success or a downfall. We are hoping to start our habitat restoration in other various areas of Simcoe starting in the Spring of 08, any volunteers who wish to help out?  Perhaps this FACT SHEET will help everyone understand more of this project as well.  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/articles/lake_...ion_project.htm  An update of the project.  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/articles/lsmrp_oct292007.doc   As for the MNR using these funds to to pay for gas in their trucks, it is not their money. This is not what the money was raised for. This is a separate entity from which people like yourself have helped raise funds for. (Remember the St. Croix rod I won from Mr. JR? Then in turn I raffled it back off to raise funds for the LSMRP, (Joey won the rod btw).  I am certain there will be comments like “why don’t they spend the money on the walleye fisheries or why not contribute the money towards the Whitefish and Lake Trout PGT?” Well if I was a member of their club and that is what the funds were set out to be used for, I would support it 100 percent as well. This money was raised for the interest of Muskie in all of Canada, which I am proud to be a member of.   There are many different types of people in life, some have opinions and do nothing, some have opinions and talk about doing something, some have opinions and say “we” yet they are never around when the work needs to be done. Then there are the others who have opinions and get involved."
129954,irishfield,2007-11-04 20:48:00,26272,Thanks for a clear and concise response Ron with some useful details. Too bad your MCI president doesn't have the grace you do. Elections coming up soon... LOL !!
129956,mattyk,2007-11-04 20:54:00,2110,thanks Ron for the report on whats going on.
129959,Roy,2007-11-04 21:02:00,13728,"Thanks for posting that Ron. It'll clear up a lot of questions that had been up to this point, unanswered."
129974,Terry,2007-11-04 21:46:00,14456,now that was  good response  from muskiescanada...thanks Ron  where can I find info on volunteering in the spring
129989,Pigeontroller,2007-11-04 22:38:00,2793,"  Actually Wayne, we are quite happy with our current president! He is usually the voice of moderation, perhaps he like many others has gotten tired of hearing the same    from the same source.  MCI is certainly not a perfect organization, I'm sure there have been many problems over the years, but as with any volunteer group, you have people in it for both good and bad reasons, and you have doers and people who do nothing. Luckily for us we have guys like Chris who step up and help keep a good club moving forward."
129214,mattyk,2007-11-02 13:16:00,2110,"Why has the Green Bay, WI progam been succesful, what are they doing that we are not for lake simcoe? I have seen the pictures of fish from Green Bay and it looks like they have established a very good fishery there and it only looks like things are getting better for them. Maybe we need to bring them in and get their help?"
129221,Terry,2007-11-02 13:25:00,14456,most of the problems have been management and hatcheries  they couldn't get them to eat pellets so they died they need to get a large number of fish into the lake to make it work and that just has not happened yet
129277,steverowbotham,2007-11-02 15:26:00,1800,"The prject has been ongoing, however, it was in the wrong hands and not being done properly.  There are many new techniques being utilized this year for the stocking program, and a much higher survival rate in the hatchery due to this new protocol.  Also, a new strain of muskie is being used this time.  Most of the stock has come from Georgian Bay and Gloucester Pool, where pike and muskie have been known to coexist.  Why there and not elsewhere?  We're not too sure yet.  Also, they will avoid stocking the north end of the lake so as not to interfere with the current population in Lake Couchiching.  This year is a pioneer project, 70 muskies have been raised previously in a year, and that was the goal for this year.  Well folks, we are over 2000 fish this year, which is a great success, we'll see where it goes from here."
129280,misfish,2007-11-02 15:51:00,29133,"Heres the only thing that bothers me.   Hey son,nice musky. Pardon me? Yeah thats a nice looking musky.This is not a musky it,s a pike,theres no musky in this lake."
129282,charlesn,2007-11-02 16:02:00,551,"I've never seen or heard of a musky being caught in Simcoe in recent memory, weird thing is, I've caught several (and seen several more caught) in Cooch without even trying for them.  I've fished Simcoe about 20 times as often as Cooch.  Maybe they stick north of the narrows.  Is there a moratorium on keeping musky from Simcoe?  Maybe there should be while this process is on-going.  Charles"
129312,capt bruce,2007-11-02 16:57:00,820,"70 fish 2000 fish .. really not alot when you think about it , an adult female muskie can lay 50,000 - 150,000 egges in one spawn .. Stocking is not gonna help . The money and effort should go into spawning habitat ,why is it that a few gobies in a bait bucket put in the right (wrong) place and you have a gobie invasion 100,000 alantics in lake o and you still cant catch/see any ?? , if these fish cant spawn you can stock what ever and they are not gonna come back , but with the right spawning habitat you would not have a problem in the first place. If anything stocked fish will water down the population with undesireable cateristics for lake simcoe fish if and when spawning does occur."
129336,Pigeontroller,2007-11-02 18:29:00,2793,Muskie is closed on Simcoe and Couch indefinately. This project had a rough start but is doing much better this year with over 1000 12 inch Muskie stocked in recent months. Instead of voicing negative opinions why not join a club or conservation group and get involved with giving back to the fisheries we all love...
