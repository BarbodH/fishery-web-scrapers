They have a product showcase in the newsletter, but for those who don't get it or go through it, I thought I would post here... These guys are Canadian and for some reason thier products just intrigue me... I've never seen anything like it before.. but if you are looking for a unique xmas present.. here ya go.. Im sure YOUR wife will love it!!  http://www.glasstoilets.com  "
131563,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 18:13:00,7971,"I just about crapped when I saw the prices (pun intended).  Seriously though...very interesting...if I had loads of money I had no idea what to do with, this would be one of the first things I'd buy"
131566,TJQ,2007-11-08 18:19:00,7806, LOL... hey... art isn't cheap!!
131567,fishindevil,2007-11-08 18:20:00,6254,"Hey TJ....I hope you are putting one of those in at camp jiggy,jiggy!!!!!.  ...LOL..LOL..LOL man i gotta get one of those...man thats too cool,except im not sure how much the mrs,would like it.  .!!!!! that had to have been invented by a fisherman for sure...cheers"
131568,Daplumma,2007-11-08 18:22:00,1961,Those are great!Wonder if they are availble in the states?I know I could sell a few of them here.When I first saw the post I thought that the bowl was glass also.Ewwwwwww. Joe
131570,Guest lundboy,2007-11-08 18:24:00,0,The price isn't so bad!  By one comment I thought it was $1200.  $295 is pretty reasonable.  A good toilet these days usually runs about $495 like a Kohler.
131571,Guest lundboy,2007-11-08 18:26:00,0,"  You need to build yourself an ""Al Bundy's Reading Room"""
131572,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 18:29:00,7971, I suppose...but at least you get a tank and bowl for $495.  I see now the majority are 295...the ones that I clicked on at first ranged from $325 to over $400.
131785,Blake,2007-11-09 12:11:00,418,lol fishing on the crapper
131786,mattyk,2007-11-09 12:17:00,2110,thats too funny!
132178,TJQ,2007-11-10 15:03:00,7806,If you put it in the office.. you could write it off... hmmm...
132179,JohnF,2007-11-10 15:07:00,3494, Did I hear they're coming out with a Snapping Turtle model? It's more like a hologram so when the lid is up it's poised to strike at you.  JF
132180,Muskieman,2007-11-10 15:19:00,2472,I like this one...show your      to the BASS!
