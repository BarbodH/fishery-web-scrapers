First trip with water just around 60 degrees and a severe cold front/blue skies we hooked but lost a nice fish while jigging in 18 fow.  2nd trip w got a decent fish on a black spinnerbait in the weeds close to deeper water when the water was around 58 degrees.  Last trip, with the water cooled down to 52 we spent more time trolling deeper water but had no luck, ended up casting in some green weeds in 10 fow and caught/released a 7lb pickerel on a sledge, not even a sniff from a 'ski that 3rd day."
