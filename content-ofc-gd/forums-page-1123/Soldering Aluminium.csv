The plumbers torch worked fine but for a long weld on thick material like a boat hull it wasn't very good in my opinion.  Regular glass will work. Use a few layers laid in different directions so the fabric strength is evened out over the repair area. Just remember to use EPOXY resin and to STIR it for the time recommended.... 3 to 5 minutes. You have at least 1/2 hour working time with it befoe it goes off, so don't rush the job."
