131697,jdlivewell,2007-11-09 00:46:00,6,Do anyone know how to use the Line conversion chart in the Precision Trolling hand book for using a larger lb test line.  I know how to read the chart to get the corresponding value but what do you do with that number? IE  20lb  test Mono for 20 feet down gives me a number of 17 ??  Thanks

131716,jdlivewell,2007-11-09 01:19:00,6,I like to run a Yo-Zuri DD 7/8 oz 20 feet down at the bay but on 20 lb test. The chart only gives values for 10 lb test and  I am not shure how to use the comversion chart. I to have the 8th edition. Heading there tomorrow any help would be great. thanks
131725,fishindevil,2007-11-09 01:53:00,6254,"well i have the book right here in front of me and there is a conversion chart,from 6lb line right up to20lb line its on page 9 from the front,of the bookfor example:::: at 20ft down  with 20lb diameter,instead of using 10,your lure will be at 17ft,thats the conversion,and as the deeper you go that number will change....its confusing to type what it means but its easy to see in the book...does that make any sense????i typed it just like it says"
131734,jdlivewell,2007-11-09 02:06:00,6,So when it says to put out 80 feet of 10 lb line to reach 20 feet down how much more line do I put out using 20 lb test to reach the same depth?
