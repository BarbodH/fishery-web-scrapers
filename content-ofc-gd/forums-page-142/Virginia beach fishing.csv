I should warn everyone - ice is not safe anymore please dont try it. This morning ice was from 5 to 3,5 inches in most places. When we were leaving it was 1,5 to 3 inches. Rain was killing it pretty fast. Fishing was ok in the morning and died around 11 am. Kept 23 fish for pan. I hope next week we will have a good ice.   "

952478,crappieperchhunter,2016-01-10 01:00:00,2582,Good job   I was going to join a buddy on Cooch today but backed out because I didn't like the forecast or the current ice thickness. Next weekend for sure.  And I know that nervous feeling coming in from a days fishing on iffy ice. I hope to never experience it again. But man I'm still jealous.  Enjoy your fish fry.

You know it's thin ice when you walk by a guys hole 20 feet away and water comes up it. That was 5 years ago on Quinte, maybe 2""s. NFG for me.  Good for you Costa, but you know we don't keep anything under 12""s here on Erie. You know I jest, it's actually 10."
