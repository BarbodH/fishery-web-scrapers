953111,SirCranksalot,2016-01-13 23:39:00,3291,I just find it unfortunate that the developed world in general is throwing the middle class under the bus.  For a long time the US and Canada have been enthusiastic supporters of capitalism. For a long time it seemed to work in our favor but now maybe not so much. It's hard to see how any gov't that supports capitalism can stop profit seeking multi-nationals from moving jobs overseas----and we know how the alternative to capitalism worked out.

952893,Dara,2016-01-12 16:45:00,3052,"Actually, lowest price doesn't get these jobs.  Many factors are taken into account. Schedules, Canadian content, design. Sometimes MTO designs their own bridges, sometimes there is a design competition for artistic value, maintence requirements etc. It is a very complicated and involved process to put a project like this together. Inspection used to be done by MTO but about 25 years ago they started contracting it out to engineering materials laboratories and it is overseen by MTO engineers.  More than one engineer will be calculating and checking work like this.  Something really strange happened here and it will take a while to figure it out"
952896,dave524,2016-01-12 16:57:00,4508,"An eye witness account mentions a big gust of wind lifted the bridge , probably beyond the limits of what the expansion joint was designed for and it didn't mesh properly when it dropped."

952908,Dara,2016-01-12 18:06:00,3052,"Interesting article Glenn.  I have done a bit of bridge work and MTO engineering checks generally cover it but this could be different .  I can't see the design not being stamped by an Ontario registered engineer but the government does what they want.  Ms Wynne doesn't seem to understand the importance of this bridge for Canada.  All the beef and pork from western Canada coming by truck must cross this bridge. and her statements sound like she is thinking Hwy 17 from Nipigon to Wawa but it isn't like that.  I still don't understand how anybody would reopen this bridge given the failure that happened and the current unknowns.  Also, with how upset Sandro, CEO of Ontario eng society sounds, its possible they got shut out of this bridge and now have a great big I told You So on the way   Now I'm wondering if the same engineers will do the second bridge"

953013,wormdunker,2016-01-13 14:25:00,1711,"All in all it's a terrible situation.  What really bothers me is, every where you look our major projects are purchasing materials & other goods from over seas.  In Canada we have seen several large corporations close their doors.  Atlas Steel in Welland, John Deere in Welland, Hayes Dana in Thorold, Stelco Steel just to name a few.  Where are your grandchildren going to work?  Hell, even Arcteryx clothing which is a high end outdoor clothing manufacturer has their garments now made in China.  At one time they had a plant in British Columbia!  Yes - their clothing was Made In Canada!"

952687,crappieperchhunter,2016-01-11 04:31:00,2582,The article says the bridge opened Nov 29 2015 and  broke apart January 10 2016 . So a total of 42 days in operation. I'm thinking some engineers have some serious explaining to do

952691,wormdunker,2016-01-11 07:49:00,1711,"That's serious stuff!  At terrace Bay on Hwy 17 there is a logging road (the Mill Rd) which goes north to the town of Longlac on Hwy 11.  That would be an alternate route around Nipigon.  Truckers from Toronto heading west would have to travel #11 north to Cochrane then head west to Longlac.  My understanding is a lot of trucks will travel Hwy 11 in the winter due to the steep hills, curves & winter road conditions encountered while travelling Hwy 17 west of Marathon.  Lake Superior snow effect can be intense especially near Schreiber & Rossport.  Good luck to any one who must take this route."
952701,Yellow Fever,2016-01-11 12:12:00,139,"Wormdunker.....you can still get to Longlac....you are going 17 to 11, you would not cross that bridge to get to Longlac. It's traffic across the country that's an issue. This is a big deal for sure. There are a number of ways to get to Longlac off 17 but you aren't getting any farther west."
952704,Rod Caster,2016-01-11 12:50:00,5784,That is absolutely going to create havoc to local deliveries and cross-country shipping. I can't believe this occurred.  I'm driving to Wawa today... traffic wont be an issue!

952758,Dara,2016-01-11 16:56:00,3052,"You can't drive around Nipigon. Maybe if you know a few logging roads really well but nothing is paved and nothing is plowed this time of year. You have to go to US at the Sault and drive the south side of Superior.  We are on a project in White River with workers from Thunder Bay.  They have to drive around Superior to get home...about 1200 miles  This is actually a really bad thing.  They have reopened one lane but hearing what the damage is, this bridge is basically out of commision. This stops all traffic across Canada. Any truck driver that doesn't have a passport can't drive west or east of Thunder Bay. You can't get to Thunder bay from the east and you can't get to most of Ontario from the west.  The highway through Michigan on the south side of Superior M28 is no better than HWY 7 down near Toronto"
952763,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-11 17:13:00,10439,Seems they have one lane open now. Better than none.  A woman saw it happen and watched as a couple of pick up trucks nose dived off the ramp.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/intense-cold-splits-brand-new-bridge-strands-canadians-/62165/
