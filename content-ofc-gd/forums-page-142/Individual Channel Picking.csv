If you have a copy or access to the law that prohibits streaming please provide it, I do believe a US legal team asked cable companies to provide names of people who stream the Canadian courts basically told them to pound salt!!!"

952925,JoshS,2016-01-12 21:19:00,729,"Live streaming sports does suck quality-wise but like Raf said, just subscribe to a sports streaming service if you need it. That's the biggest thing I missed when cutting cable. I do stream my sports now and the quality is far from HD (I didn't feel the leafs warranted subscribing to NHL gamecentre this year lol)  Other than that, cable tv seems like a thing of the past, at least the way it is currently provided. I guess there are a few positives to cable...plug and play solution, easy to setup, supported, some people might like scheduled programming and flipping channels with options, etc. But cutting the cord and a little education you can set yourself up to avoid the monthly cable fee's and watch whatever you want, when you want. Much better that way.  I haven't been seduced into the android box, kodi etc yet. But between netflix, online streaming sites + chromecast and a crappy HD antenna with 11 channels, I don't miss cable other than the sports."

I don't feel the need for CMT or any franco channels.  Seems they have just changed the bundles around a bit and allow picking 15/20/30 channels or package prices.  We package your favourite channels.  Who the *@#* is Rogers to tell me what my favourite channels are. Any explanations would be welcome.   im logged into my rogers account now, go to your tv service, and under packages, you can choose individual channels, they're usually around $2.79 per month, I havce the fishing network as an extra channel, without all the extra channels in the package"

That sports talk show host you were listening to was probably on a Rogers owned station and spouting the company line about how it's sports leagues that are the reason your cable bill is too high.  Betcha he never mentioned his companies' profits over the past year.  That's the problem when the cable company owns the radio and TV stations.  Truth goes out the window.

It doesn't matter if it's Granny that has not 1 sports channel, she pays too. If the cable companies got together and decided not to pay these ridiculous prices to the networks that in turn pay huge to the leagues the days of multi million dollar players contracts  would end that day. What did ABC pay for Monday Night Football a few years back? Something like a billion $$$$. That's 16 games a year, no playoffs.The dollars are just insane that they pay the bigs.  A quick search and I find the NFL in 2011 made a 10 year deal with CBS, Fox and NBC to broadcast the Super Bowl. The cost? It averages out to 3.5 Billion dollars per game. For 1 game once a freaking year. Can you hear me screaming?  We may be ranting at the wrong people for crazy cable and satellite prices."
