He managed to get 3, 1 of them a slab the other 2 kinda small. I lost a huge walleye…..DARN!  There were scores of fish on the screen all morning but they had lockjaw, but the shack was nice and warm and the bucket seats waaaaaay more comfy than the old bench seat style I had before.  The fish were in 30'FOW and were only responding to tiny minnows on a plain hook with a small splitshot for weight, they ignored even the smallest jig presentations. I had a slip bobber on when the walleye hit, never used one on the ice before…kinda fun!  "
