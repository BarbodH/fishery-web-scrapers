From all I have heard about the potential walleye that come out of there, I figure its a good year to try it out. As I know very little about the area, I figure the best way to start is to hit up a good hut operator that can put us on some fish.  You guys know me, comfort and price take a back seat to the likelyhood of hooking into a couple of beauties. Any recommendations on which hut operators have the best success in terms of being put on fish?"
952883,jimmer,2016-01-12 15:11:00,2730,I think they have more portable guide services than hut operators. Ice might not be great this year. Sorry I can't recommend someone. There is a site that focuses on that area that might be worth checking out.
952885,Garnet,2016-01-12 15:27:00,2056,Dave Chatterson runs huts out of Carrying Place. Super important to get first light bite and last light. Good early year spot.
952973,Sinker,2016-01-13 00:59:00,8692,"I fish quinte a fair bit, but I dont know of any hut operators there. At least I dont see any in the locations I fish.....where the fish are.....first ice is the key, and start fishing in the dark, and stay til dark. I catch them at all times of day, but dusk/dawn are definitley the witching hours.  Its not too hard to figure out on your own. Just get out there and jig your arm off all day and you will get fish.  If you want any more specific info, pm me.  S."
952994,Garnet,2016-01-13 11:13:00,2056,Dave Chatterton Fish Finder Charters. He is full time walleye salmon and ice huts. Straight across from Trenton. The huts are in that trench between shoal and Island.  Nice huts.
952996,Acountdeleted,2016-01-13 11:45:00,2562,Thanks for the help guys. This is a great start. Will Dave be there/have the huts ready before sunup if I book in advance?
953003,Garnet,2016-01-13 12:47:00,2056,I think it was 6am. He lives on that shoreline. Maybe 200ft to ice and short walk. He takes you by skido. I sent my stuff out and walked. Just get bones lose walk.
953015,Sinker,2016-01-13 14:33:00,8692,"I heard the ice blew out of quinte on the weekend. I was planning on going there this weekend, but looks like I'll be playing it by ear. Once I get out there a time or two, I can help ya with what I know. For now though, quinte is a no go.  S."
953065,Garnet,2016-01-13 18:42:00,2056,I jig with both hands on Quinte. Set lines have never worked for me.  The last time in these hut we had a strong daylight bite on bottom and then messed with dinky perch until about 2;30 when a school of fish 5 feet down went threw. It was crazy for about 20 minutes.
953082,quickme,2016-01-13 20:58:00,261,do you have your own gear?  If so you'll be alright without going with an operator.  I know a guy that I could intro you that stays at quinte for the entire hardwater season.  He takes people out all the time and does it for free.  Nicest guy you'll ever meet.  Pray for quinte to ice up good and send me a PM on when you're interested in going.
953103,Acountdeleted,2016-01-13 22:47:00,2562,"Thanks guys. Quickme, I'm decked out in ice fishing gear. I just find tha fishing new lakes, I'm often starring at multiple holes in the ice with nothing to show for.  When Quinte locks up I'll send out some PM's. Thanks so much for the help everyone."
953105,Sinker,2016-01-13 22:55:00,8692,I would spend the money on a hotel room down there and fish two days on your own. I can help u out with locations etc....there is lots of access there. You could easily fish a couple different areas each day.  S.
953125,Garnet,2016-01-14 00:56:00,2056,To do well on Quinte you need to stay mobile. Just be every carful with ice conditions. Doesn't matter how cold it is. The best areas have current and need respect.  If you can buddy up do it. Thiers both resident walleyes and lake walleyes.
953127,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-14 01:37:00,10439,"UHHHHHHH, don't you need ice to fish out of huts?"
953135,Acountdeleted,2016-01-14 03:05:00,2562,Nope. I'm just going to flip the hut over and paddle it out to the middle of the lake.
