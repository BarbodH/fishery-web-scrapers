952711,RDR,2016-01-11 13:35:00,125,Creative to the end..........Sad news indeed!!!  
952715,John,2016-01-11 13:42:00,2956,One of only a handful in the last 50 years creative enough to continually reinvent himself..
952718,bigugli,2016-01-11 13:49:00,6138,Man I am feeling kinda old at the moment. I can still remember going out to get my 45 of Space Oddity at the Towers record counter.
952722,Acountdeleted,2016-01-11 14:15:00,2562,Seems to always happen in 3's  Scott Wallin Lemmy from Mot√∂rhead David Bowie.   A sad day indeed.
952729,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-11 14:59:00,8243,"I never ""got him"" until years after he wasn't putting music out regularly. I'm talking 70's and early 80's. Always appreciated the music but didn't like the theatrics until latter as I said. The documentary out recently (2 yrs?) was fantastic. Too young, too sad. He was a great actor as well."
952759,Joey,2016-01-11 16:57:00,9122,RIP Ziggy Stardust
952790,esoxansteel,2016-01-11 19:37:00,1307,"One of only a handful in the last 50 years creative enough to continually reinvent himself..    So absolutely true, a brilliant performer, and composer, and RDR's video upload of Lazarus shows the incredible talent that Bowie provided us all, right to the end of life on earth"
952799,Joeytier,2016-01-11 19:49:00,3990,"David was an outrageously brilliant songwriter, as well as performer.  His golden era of 'The Man Who Sold The World' through to 'Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)' in the 70's contains much of the most brilliant pop and rock and roll (and everything in between) I've ever heard.  His influence is heard in everything from bubblegum pop to heavy metal, and his sex, drugs, and rock and roll debauchery in his heyday surpassed just about anyone else this world has ever seen.  A true legend in every sense of the word, and it sounds as though his last album released just a few days is absolutely great, apparently the best thing hes done in years."
952828,wkrp,2016-01-11 22:45:00,656,I am grateful to have seen him in concert a couple times. Truly a powerful artist.
952876,Lape0019,2016-01-12 13:51:00,647,"I found it funny last night, I was talking to my wife and said I wasn't a huge fan and didn't like his music and couldn't really think of any of his songs. Until every channel on the radio was playing something different song, and I knew it, and I liked it.  I guess I never really looked into just how much this artist provided to the music scene over the years."
