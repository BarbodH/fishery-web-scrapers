952506,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-10 02:43:00,8243,"I have to say it is difficult for many here like myself to post a fish report when we get the brilliantly written trip reports complete with magnificent Hi Def photos and videos. I read them and love them, not just from Mike either. That I believe is one reason guys aren't posting reports as much as guys and gals feel they aren't worthy unless it is Pulitzer Prize contribution. I love each and every one of the reports. Actually some of the simple reports from guys just starting are some of my favorites, I remember how it felt and how proud I would get when I caught my first of a species or personal best, actually still do. Keep up the jabs and snide comments and some of our most valuable and talented contributors may just decide not to share here, come on man.  Keep them coming, each and every one, please."
952507,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-10 02:46:00,8243,No I won't marry you. I tried that once and it just wasn't a thing I would do again. Besides I don't go for guys with 15 kids. Get back to work.

952514,Steelheadphycho,2016-01-10 03:47:00,470,"100% true. The fact that no one has seen me post any fishing reports is, I haven't been fishing. I went twice this year. I know there isn't any excuse for it, but life has changed. Heck, I haven't been to Canada since 2012.  Hopefully, this year will be different."
953012,AKRISONER,2016-01-13 14:00:00,5558,"i might change my reports from a annual to a semi annual because now i feel bad lol. I could just throw in more photos of crappier fish ahaha.  Its true though, with the fly in reports it feels dumb to post anything that isnt trophy caliber, even my buddies and I have rules about what deserves a pic lol. I guess i could just be less selective and post more of my nature photos too!"
953025,Terry,2016-01-13 16:11:00,14456,It funny cause I was thinking more about a fishing guide that ONLY posts to support his business But that's ok.   You seem to have some guilt.  So I can live with that.
953044,GbayGiant,2016-01-13 17:30:00,1780, Nope. My suggestion to you is smoke another fatty and stick to the political threads. I don't smoke Mike!

952178,AKRISONER,2016-01-07 13:56:00,5558,"im one of the few lucky guys here that fishes at least 30 weekends a year. I just dont have the time to post up a report after every trip, hence i post an annual report of our best catches, trust me sometimes i get the itch to tell you about something awesome thats happened, but then i think why waste one photo of a new species or personal best that i caught for a whole thread.  now i feel kinda guilty lol"
952179,solopaddler,2016-01-07 13:57:00,8605,"I would vote for moosebunk It's fishing related and posted for the love of fishing with no other agenda or profit  Okay Terry. Literally the only person on this board who your comment could possibly be directed at is me, so I'm going to respond.  To date I have made nothing, not one dime directly or indirectly related to my online reports which take on average 40-60 hours to construct and post. I still have a full time job and while I do have the ability to take time off I sure don't get 8-9 weeks of paid holiday a year. When I go on these trips I lose money. I've told my wife it's for a reason...that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and she's always supported me, but there's a limit. This is what I love and yes, I'm trying against all odds to make a living at it, so if you want to call that an agenda then so be it. I call it following my dream. I have been an active member of this board for a long time and would hope that some of the other long time members would cut me some slack and offer even a little support. Many do, and I thank those people profusely.  The magazine that I launched late last fall cost more than $50,000 to release without a single cent being recouped. I'm selling that issue for $5 and trust me no one is making a dime on that either. Believe me when I tell you I'm currently on the edge of a deep precipice, things could quite easily go either way. Comments like yours hurt considering the effort I'm giving here with zero money being made at least to date.  Back to the thread...Bunk's report on Great Slave was easily my personal favorite. Thoroughly enjoyed reading that one."
952293,manitoubass2,2016-01-08 04:26:00,11391,I wanna fish in the middle of nowhere with borger.

952298,spincast,2016-01-08 11:24:00,3279,"hmm. I enjoy them all. Mike Rousseau and Fisherpete put together some greats stories and fish; Joeytier has some great backwoods adventures, Brian is a constant with some great escapades - especially those spring laker days, Limey's are fun, although the fact he can catch better fish from his back yard than I can after driving 3.5 hours one way has been known to drive the envy scale up a bit, Mike B and Bunk are in a league of their own,and then are those guys who only post one or two a year, but they are really cool, Like AK. As long as it has fishing in,  I enjoy all them. Another man in a league of his own is Irish. I walked with him through his struggles and frustration, anger and sadness,  I met the man and his wife, nicer, open folks you couldn't ask to meet. The sad end of that story this year was tough. I am still saddened by the fact I wasn't able to attend the funeral and say a final goodbye to Jen and personally show my support. To this day I see Jen, Wayne and Leah as an inspiration and role models  on how to fight and never be beaten.  Overall its quite the collection 'round here. That being said I agree with Terry's swipe at those who show up to promote their fishing biz, but that is the extent of their participation, and Mike - just to be clear, you are not one of the shameless self promoters in my eyes. You give freely of your knowledge and participate in the community at large. Of course, at the same time, I gotta tell you, these trips you post are driving me crazy - I get one place off my list a year of spots I want to fish before I die,and you add 10 edit: Ooops, and I meant to mention,  Rodbender and Whitespinnerbait also gotta be included in any awesome post designations. These guys never fail to amaze with their camera skills"

UH, cause I'm here in Ontario and the ice wasn't safe enough for me when I left to come here. Will be heading out there when I get home and am going to work on the inside with my 70,000 BTU propane heater running full bore!!!!  FYI: My favorite threads are Borger and Bunks epic adventures!!!"
