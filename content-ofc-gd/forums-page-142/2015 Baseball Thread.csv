But  1) There is no salary cap in baseball. Doesn't look like that is going to change.  2) Rogers makes billions. Billions! $210 million is just a blip on the radar. It's nothing.  The jays made it very clear when they traded all of their young prospects that they are going for it now. That's fine but they can't be half pregnant. Again, like Frank said, we have 2-3 years. Go for it all until 2017-2018 and then rebuild. If the Jays become a 72 win team after 3-4 good runs (regardless if they win a World Series or not) I will say it's worth it. They way they are going now try are setting back up to be another 85 win team.   Well, technically there IS a salary cap.....a soft one, but there is one, its around 145mil, if you go above that, you pay a luxary tax, Dodgers got hit for 47.5 million in luxary taxes for this season.  from rumours i've heard, the board can't stand the rogers son in the board room, so they gave him the jays to 'play' with, they figure theres less risk with him running the jays then there is with him in the board room calling shots, lot less money to lose.  This is the down side to having a major company owning a sports team vs a private ownership group.  it turns into a side project or play toy.  7 years and 200+ million for Price?? no way, way too much for way too long, hes going to turning 31 next year, 7 years, he'll he 38, most starters last until 35-36 years old.  you still want to have someone on the books for 60million+ for 2 years of retirement?  if he was 26, 27 or 28, a 7 year contract makes sense.  At his age, a 5 year contract makes sense, a 7 year is just asking for trouble for your teams future.  The off season is far from over, there are more big name pitchers available."

At this stage in his career, there are so many factors Price is considering, the money is just one component.  Signing on to live in Canada wasn't likely on his agenda.

947463,FrankTheRabbit,2015-12-02 06:26:00,479,"Dunno what's the hate on David Price for. He did an outstanding job during his short tenure with the Jays. The fact is, had we not got Price to come to Toronto, the Jays would have played another October of meaningless baseball and looking forward to 2016. He was 9-1 while he was with us and not to mention the games he pitched against division rivals. Sure, we would have liked to have seen him flourish in the playoffs, but I feel Gibby's decision to rest him for 11 days and have him pitch in the bullpen had some influence on that. Plus the impression he's made with the Jays will be everlasting, especially with our own pitchers.  Anyhow, I think it says more about Rogers and their so-called ""commitment"" to win as being pretenders and not contenders in the super competitive AL East. Signing JA Happ doesn't exactly make me feel excited for the 2016 season for the Jays."
947472,Acountdeleted,2015-12-02 12:49:00,2562,"I agree 100% with Frank. Price was less then mediocre in the playoffs but he got us there, which is not easy to do in the MLB.  If it's true that the Jays didn't even place an offer on Price, deciding instead to go after Happ, I find that very concerning. I heard Bob McCowan mention he would offer Price 4 years at something like $25-30 million a year with a chance for Price to walk after the first two. He probably wouldn't have taken it but it would have been a show of good faith by Jays management and, more importantly, Shapiro."
947473,netminder,2015-12-02 13:39:00,514,"We'll see how much fun the Red Sox have with Price once he starts breaking down at age 33-37. Fun fact: that is around the time the Jays would be looking to try and restock their team as it is well beyond their current ""window"".  There is no doubt Price helped the Jays make the playoffs last year, but I wonder how much that was symbolic and how much of that truly was on the back of his 9-1 record? The Jays were under performing badly by the trade deadline and I think Price was more of a shot in the arm to tell the team that the front office believed in them. I can honestly tell you that I think the team as it currently stands is still capable of making the playoffs. The Red Sox are by no means a complete team simply by adding Price to their rotation. With Price on the Jays they'd automatically be WS favourites without a doubt. There are still guys out there and I'm curious what someone like Greinke demands. Second tier guys like Cueto, Kazmir and Leake are still out there, and I have trouble believing the Jays don't at least take a shot at signing one of those three.  As I posted on sportsnet...  Let's play hypotheticals here.Let's assume the Jays are a playoff team in 2016 (which I still believe they are) and Boston figures things out and Price wins 30 games for them like everyone assumes he would in Toronto. On the shoulders of his 30 win season the Red Sox are 120-42 and win the East. Toronto somehow sneaks in and wins the wildcard game and goes up against Boston in the DS. After a 4 game slugfest we're in game 5 and it's Price v. Stroman. Who would you rather have on the mound in that situation?"

947522,FrankTheRabbit,2015-12-02 19:38:00,479,"Jays probably couldn't match the offer, but at least, in good faith, make an attempt to keep Price. If what I'm hearing is correct and the Jays didn't even bother pitching an honest offer, that really is troubling going forward. I don't think we'll ever hear the truth and certainly can't expect Rogers to tell it like it is.  Seeing how the Jays lineup currently stands, the players are ready NOW...not in a few years.  Comparing to KC, their 2014 lineup was not much different than their WS winning 2015 lineup. They got some key pieces and were able to repeat the success of WS contenders and actually winning it all. They were moving in a forward momentum. Compared to the Jays, it feels like we're moving backwards. I'm sure it's been mentioned before and I totally agree that we still need a bonafide ace and deeper relief pitching, provided our aging HR producers stay healthy. Bautista is turning 36, Encarnacion is turning 33, and Donaldson will be 30 less than a week."

The team is basically in place for next year and I'm pretty sure most everyone was ready for spring the day after the last game. There is no reason to believe whatsoever that anything has changed for the worse on the field. Yes he created the current team, and it will be the same team for a little while yet. Funny how I brought up the hockey disease in this city when Brian Burke was the face of the Leafs as opposed to the players, and then Jeremy brings it up when quoting me, lol. But to that point, you can still see Burke's finger prints all over the current Maple Leafs team. The only thing that has changed in BJ land so far is there is no GM. And personally I think it was just AA being stubborn and foolish. Or, maybe it was just him taking a stand against the way they handled Beeston's ""retirement"". Which is honourable, I guess. To some extent  Either way, one or two top tier starting pitcher free agents being signed will make everyone forget about AA. He sent us on a nice ride to finish off 5.5 years of mediocrity.

943128,FrankTheRabbit,2015-11-03 02:18:00,479,"Frank, you have to look at the time lines.... Last November, Rogers tried to replace Beeston with The Cubs GM. They had to ask permission to do so from the Cub's owner as their GM was under contract. Turns out that the owner of the Cubs is a very good friend of Beestons and he let Beeston know about the call. Frankly (no pun intended!), that pissed off both Beeston and AA. Showed a complete lack of class and given Beeston's loyalty to the Jays, it was a really stupid move. Fast forward to May/June timeline and now Rogers has a full blown search on, to replace Beeston. Remember, at that time, the Jays were a sub 500 team with a fairly large payroll. Their record at the indicated that they weren't going to be a playoff team and that they would again, lose money this year. Rogers finds Shapiro, who is accustomed to dealing with a limited budget and he tells Rogers what they want to hear... he can make the Jays a money maker. I took the better part of two to three months to get Shapiro's package together and guess what, the Jays are on a roll and people are coming to the park and watching on TV. The folks at Rogers were probably the most surprised people on the planet. They were caught completely off guard and have been in damage control since August, when they announced the signing of Shapiro. A little back history here... AA worked in his family business, HVAC and left it as he didn't feel it was the right career for him. He is a man of simple needs and is steadfast in his belief that he has to enjoy what he is doing. He could not see himself working for Rogers after the way they treated Beeston. I'm wiling to be that AA had made his mind up long before Shapiro was announced and that's why both he and Beeston, opened up and made the big trades. Hope that makes sense. HH Thanks bud for the insight. Today's conference really sounded like damage control. I'm sure Shapiro & Rogers have heard an earful of complaints and he's probably walking on eggshells.  I still don't like Shapiro...he reminds me of Paul Weller when he played Robocop, without the visor."
943149,Headhunter,2015-11-03 14:14:00,5703,"Yesterday's news conference did little to ease my concerns over the hiring of Shapiro.

His announcements regarding Lacava and Gibby may or may not have been genuine, but in my mind, he had little to no other options if he was in any way going to play to the hostile crowd. I'm still on the fence about this guy, but given the lack of choices the fans have at this point, I'm still going to give him the benefit of the doubt. I hope he doesn't disappoint.

The future of this team, especially this year, is going to be heavily dependant on who the next GM is. Sure, Shapiro is a ""baseball guy"" but there's a lot more to it than just him, and besides, baseball moves are much more up to the GM than the CEO.  After the last trade deadline this team is going to be very difficult to manage after this season. Very little in true talent coming down the pipeline and a big chunk of the core is getting old and beaten down. Hopefully free agency goes well.

The message seems to be prospects - which is what a small payroll team has to focus on - see Oakland, Tampa, and ""gasp"" - Cleveland.  It appears AA's hands were tied the last couple of years, but he got smart this past season, and did not spend to his budget, which then let him do what he did in July.  But I think he knew that it was unlikely Rogers would change their minds, even after they saw what a post season run was like.  He met several times - did not like the message he was hearing, and saw the writing on the wall.  Pure speculation on my part -> but going to call it now.  Rogers will reduce operating budget on the team for next season, with Tulo probably being the trade.  The reason will be they need pitching (and I am ok with Goins at short), but I expect it will not be top tier pitching, but ""controllable"" arms, which means lower cost."

If their storied past is of any indication, they're in the business to make money. The increase in cell plans/cable/internet/mobile data all providing less services for more money. I'll take a wild stab and say they're doing the same thing with the Jays.  Tupelo is calling it and The Sun was also mentioning the same thing, but there won't be any surprises if Rogers reduced payroll going forward...they've always been trying to provide the least product to make the most money, which is so sad and makes it even more of a tough pill to swallow considering how many loyal Jays fans there are in Canada. The Jays deserve much better than what Rogers is providing and I'm hoping in the near future, the team is owned by someone who actually cares about the team and doesn't see them as just another ""product"" adding to their bottom line."

942474,FloatnFly,2015-10-29 23:47:00,1640,"the Dykstra story here  During a recent appearance on Colin Cowherd's show on Fox Sports, former big leaguer Lenny Dykstra admitted to spending ""half a million bucks"" on private investigators to dig up dirt on umpires during his playing career. Dykstra says he then used the information not necessarily to bribe umpires, but to intimidate them into giving him favorable calls. ""Fear does a lot to a man,"" he says. Here's the video:  ""Their blood is just as red as ours. Some of them like women, some of them like men, some of them gamble,"" said Dykstra. He then imagined a scenario in which he asked the umpire if he ""covered the spread last night"" after a called strike, then the strike zone shrunk to his advantage. ""It wasn't a coincidence that I led the league in walks the next few years,"" he added. Dykstra led the league with 129 walks in 1993 while with the Phillies. His previous career high was 89 walks, though he missed plenty of time with injuries. Dykstra's walk rate did spike from 1993-94: (Graph via FanGraphs) Dykstra explained he was doing what ""I had to do what I had to do to win, and to support my family."" It's worth noting Dykstra has had all sorts of financial and legal trouble in recent years, so his reputation is not the best at this time. He also told Cowherd he is working on a book, so this story about hiring private investigators to dig up dirt on umpires could be a ruse to help book sales. If true though, these are some pretty serious admissions -- and allegations, he is saying umpires bet on baseball -- by Dykstra."

They recalled that the one hitter they were most concerned about. It wasn't EE, JB, or JD, but Pillar. The scouts felt that whenever Pillar got on base, Donaldson would bat the same inning. They felt that Pillar was the ""ignitor"" of the team. That's pretty amazing how they were able to analyze and neutralize the fact the Jays led the majors in HRs and runs scored.

As for Gibby, Im not a fan of his, he did well with what he had, but even he thought hiring him a second time around wasn't a good idea.  but did it anyway.  You have to look at this way, this was Beestons last year, hes retiring, done, where were the Jays when they started negotiating to bring in Shapiro, 27-30 in June? 51-50 in July?  Rogers had to act to find a replacement in the wake of a possible flunker season. At that point, they had already signed the agreement to bring Shapiro in.  They offered AA everything, they gave him a 1yr near the start of the season, then a 2yr in the middle, then a 5yr at the end.  But, its the amount of control AA wold have to give up under Shapiro in order to stay, because Shapiro is a baseball guy, always has been, Beeston was a business guy, didn't want much to do with the on field product, left that to the GM, Shapiro is more hands on.

Last I checked AA doesn't play on the field (I doubt he ever has in his life lol). Sure he is well liked by the team too, but when the players go out for a pint after the game I highly doubt they invite AA to come. I think the problem here is too many people get caught up in the corporate/front office politics of a team ala Toronto Maple Leafs and tend to forget that baseball is played on the field by the players more than any of the other big 4 sports.  Looking back at that lineup I posted there I am still very confident going into next season. Shapiro has never had a budget to work with in Cleveland, and has had success in the past. Think what might be possible when he's overseeing a team that has some money to spend. Up until July 31, everyone wanted AA's head anyway.

943050,FrankTheRabbit,2015-11-02 17:16:00,479,"I'm still in the mindset that all of this makes no sense at all and I'm struggling to find the reason why Rogers couldn't get AA to resign.  AA delivered the goods and Rogers ownership should have given anything that AA was asking for and if the speculation in the media is true, you give AA the reigns for final player decisions. He's been through it all, from beginning to end. So, for Rogers to hand the success of AA to someone with no Canadian market experience, let alone he's not even Canadian, is such a perplexing concept. Why would any owner of a company do that? Maybe, this concept of thinking is the reason why Ed Rogers is not the CEO of Rogers Co.  Again, not only was AA liked and respected by the players and staff, they trusted AA and with Shapiro coming in, he'll have to really dig deep and earn the trust of them.  What was noted in the media, but I don't think it was mentioned here, was how AA, knowing that his future wasn't certain, secured the future jobs of the front office and staff through to 2016. He went out of his way to make sure they were taken care of, before his own security was in place. That is a true sign of leadership and from that, I have an even greater amount of respect for him, both as a person and as the proper GM for the club. Heck, if anything, AA should have been promoted to President after this season's immense success. Rogers made a boatload of cash with the leadership of Beeston and AA, and Rogers couldn't be bothered to give him a slam dunk offer to re-sign him. It really puts an enormous question mark an even bigger ""what the hell"" remark on Rogers."
943055,Headhunter,2015-11-02 17:42:00,5703,"Frank, you have to look at the time lines.... Last November, Rogers tried to replace Beeston with The Cubs GM. They had to ask permission to do so from the Cub's owner as their GM was under contract. Turns out that the owner of the Cubs is a very good friend of Beestons and he let Beeston know about the call. Frankly (no pun intended!), that pissed off both Beeston and AA. Showed a complete lack of class and given Beeston's loyalty to the Jays, it was a really stupid move. Fast forward to May/June timeline and now Rogers has a full blown search on, to replace Beeston. Remember, at that time, the Jays were a sub 500 team with a fairly large payroll. Their record at the indicated that they weren't going to be a playoff team and that they would again, lose money this year. Rogers finds Shapiro, who is accustomed to dealing with a limited budget and he tells Rogers what they want to hear... he can make the Jays a money maker. I took the better part of two to three months to get Shapiro's package together and guess what, the Jays are on a roll and people are coming to the park and watching on TV. The folks at Rogers were probably the most surprised people on the planet. They were caught completely off guard and have been in damage control since August, when they announced the signing of Shapiro. A little back history here... AA worked in his family business, HVAC and left it as he didn't feel it was the right career for him. He is a man of simple needs and is steadfast in his belief that he has to enjoy what he is doing. He could not see himself working for Rogers after the way they treated Beeston. I'm wiling to be that AA had made his mind up long before Shapiro was announced and that's why both he and Beeston, opened up and made the big trades. Hope that makes sense. HH"

Leadership starts from top down and when you have an owner as much of a goofball as Ed Rogers, it spells trouble. You have to be a real dummy to go from one of the best seasons in Jays history and literally start from zero.  The players have huge respect for Alex and now that he's gone, how will you think the players will react? The stability is just not there anymore and say goodbye to Price, Estrada and any other high profile player that would come to Toronto. Alex has built a good reputation within the league and is pretty well respected.  Sad to see, but this is one of the most boneheaded moves from Rogers ever.

Price and Estrada might see this as instability and they probably will move on...What a total buzz kill. All that positive build up and momentum, wiped out by Rogers. SO disappointed and Ed Rogers only persisted with his myopic ""vision"" to keep his ego intact.  Personally, I think that the Jays Canadian market is different from the American market and I just don't believe Shapiro is the guy to understand and help the Jays succeed. Not 100% related, but look at Target...they came into Canada thinking that we would be wooed and swayed with their fancy flash and not-so-good prices and they ended up folding shop.  Alex and Beeston know and understand the Canadian market and now both are not returning. You certainly need stability to build a championship team."

Regarding the trades, I'm definitely on AA's side with the trades...Bautista & Encarncion aren't getting any younger. Every time JB is on the field, he's always doing some sort of stretches. The guy is 35 and ain't getting any younger and you wonder if his HR output will be affected. Sure, he gambled away some prospects, but when those prospects mature into the majors, what kind of run production will we have in a few years from now?  From my wild point of view, I'm guessing that Shapiro was brought in to make sure the Jays never make it to the playoffs in the near future. It was quite evident with Game 6 and the game changing lousy ump calls (yes, the Jays also didn't help themselves either...).  Even from a numbers standpoint...the Jays brought in an extra 40% in profit...what is Ed Rogers thinking? Is he aiming to have the team bring in more than 40% to their coffers?

942458,FloatnFly,2015-10-29 22:33:00,1640,"The Royals revealed their flaws. Admit it or not stick a fork in them, Jays are done. Maybe in another 10-15 years they will make it to the top in the east. It wouldn't be long  the Yanks and Red Sox will rise again with all the money they spend on players.   What flaws are you talking about? a depleted bullpen due to the injury to Cecil and Loup having to take care of his family?  I think its pretty clear by know that the royals have an edge somewhere, they know EXACTLY what pitch is coming.  there is no way that a team consistently hits so well against other teams ace pitcher that consistently, Im not just talking the jays, talking Keuchel, McHugh, Price, Stroman, and now deGrom.  deGrom especially, a pitcher like that rarely gives up 8 hits in a game, let alone 8 hits in a single inning.  you watch the batters, none of them are fooled by anything.  its almost as if they have a guy in the back room with a camera talking in their ear.    As for AA, yes he did great things THIS year, how about other years?  not so great.  however, when you are named the top executive, and then the incoming guy says you're taking a lesser role next season, thats a kick in the nuts.  I think he had his mind made up early, he was offered a 1 year, and then a 2 year.  turned them both down.  he probably did a lot of research on Shapiro to find out what kind of operation he runs, and then the Shapiro telling him how disappointed he was with AA for trading prospects BEFORE he even takes over as president.  thats a little too much Bull"
942466,Acountdeleted,2015-10-29 22:58:00,2562,"See, I didn't have a problem with with AA did before this year. He took a big shot when he brought in Dickey, Burhle, Reyes, and Johnson. It didn't work out but he took a huuuuuge shot then. What I was so impressed with him was the fact that after that shot was taken, it didn't take 5-8 years of recovery. He was able to load up and take another big swing just 3 seasons later (2? I don't remember now). The fact that he can 'go for it' more then once over a couple of years is a sign of how well the team has drafted and the minors were organized."

941462,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-24 04:26:00,479,"can't believe the ride is over...Price pitched pretty good, Bautista had 2 HRs (huge clutch!) and we had the tying run on 3rd with no one out. Just wasn't meant to be...to go along with the fan interference HR and Revere's 2nd strike call.  Was really hoping the Jays could have tied the game up!  Overall, the Jays certainly gave the city to cheer about in Oct...they were 50-51 at the break and made some good acquisitions and played phenomenal baseball.  The city certainly fell in love with the team and I hope we'll see them return again, but succeed into the World Series.  I'm certainly proud of the team!"
941463,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-24 04:29:00,956,Great job Jays.  This was a very exciting season.  Hopefully they can sign both pitchers.

941470,fishing n autograph,2015-10-24 12:36:00,2540,MLB should be embarrassed by All the fox screw ups. Saying that the royals win when Cain crossed the plate in the 8th inning and having that image pop up. Brutal
941472,grizzlybri,2015-10-24 12:40:00,565,"Let the conspiracy theories begin...they were already prepared to see the two teams go off before it was even over.  Even had two players from their respective teams in the banner.  mets vs royals.jpg  Now now lets not sound like Maple Leaf fans now, I agree that Fox messed up by showing that ""pop up"" mistake or not.  Yes the Jays lost momentum with the rain delay, but the Jays Bats were dead when their was a man in scoring positions, I don't care how many home runs you have during the season, just bunt the dam ball.  If the Jays had gotten home field would it have made a differences? If they did, they would still have to win games in KC because you can't take anything away from KC pitching, after all they do have a stronger pull pen.  Plus the Jays would have needed two wins in KC, would have been a tough task.  Regardless bad calls, conspiracies it was great to see the city and country get behind the Jays, now hopefully come April they will still be cheering the team on  I'm glad that I was able to get to Game 3 to watch them play, and see another in early September. I have never felt so much energy in any sports venue in the city.  I'm looking forward to the up coming off-season and seeing what the team does with the new president coming in."
941475,Acountdeleted,2015-10-24 13:14:00,2562,"Well, as much as the call on the home run sucked and would have made a difference, I just don't think this game was meant to be. Runners on first and third with no out and they couldn't cash them in. That seems rare to me.  All in all a great season. Some really entertaining baseball."
941495,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-24 14:42:00,479,I thought I heard the announcer say the same thing too! Thanks for confirming that and glad I didn't need to get my hearing checked lol.
941498,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-24 14:53:00,479,"hence Gibby's decision to put on scrubs after clinching their division was the wrong call and it came back and bit then in the butt. Same goes for putting Price out for 11 days before his post season start and we all know what happened in game 1 vs Texas.  I also agree with the FS1 commentators that they put Osuna in front of the Royals pitchers too often and their hitters started to pick up on his pitches and habits, which led to the HR by Morales back in Game 4 and the crucial hits in the ninth last night, which all points to a weak bullpen and the decision of not including Buerhle in the playoff roster resulting in having to use Price and Pennington as relief.  Plus the numerous on field errors committed by the Jays in the post season. I don't recall the Royals committing any errors this series...correct me if I'm wrong.  But all those things combined certainly don't make a championship caliber team.  I certainly was rooting for the home team and stuck through them through the ups and downs, but when you deconstruct all those things, including the gaffes from last night games from everything around them, it just wasn't meant to me.  Despite being eliminated last night, it certainly hasn't diminished any adoration I have for its players and the team and I'm hopeful of what is next to come next season.  KC was in the same situation last year and they've learned from mistakes made from being eliminated, which fuelled their determination to make it to the WS this year.  Congratulations are indeed earned by the Royals. Aside from punk-a$$ Ventura and his stare downs, they played a good clean game."
941509,davey buoy,2015-10-24 15:41:00,5505,"For a team at the half way mark was essentially out of it,they put on a great show.Congrats Jays,and hoping with at least 90% of the same players,I can see an even more exciting season next year !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

941780,netminder,2015-10-26 14:00:00,514,"They also could have tied it up late in game 7 of the world series and missed that opportunity. I will agree (and Don Cherry said the same thing) but the umpires blew some key calls. Shamus there in the bleachers reaching over the fence blew my mind. The fact they were so excited to go interview him and the ridiculous camera shots of him ""reaching"" over the fence were borderline disgraceful. Then 1, possibly 2 missed balks, the tag on Rios at second that was missed.... If there was any doubt there was bias in this post season it was basically confirmed in game 6. Not that I'm a conspiracy guy, but I think a lot of on field umpires were a lot more willing to give the tie on any play to the Royals than they were the Jays.  Whatever though. It was a lot of fun and way more than I typically expect from the Jays. Next year the whole organization will be primed to take a real run at it, right from the outset of spring training. They have some key holes to fill in the rotation but the main core of this team will be basically the same next year, which is truly exciting.  Hope eternal springs!"

Pretty sure they had determined to fire AA at the end of the Season - and then the trade deadline comes a bammmo.  Now what?  It might not be bad - but I have a feeling it will decimate the team.  Even the Marlins don't mess up like this - and they have won a World Series in recent years.
942326,netminder,2015-10-29 12:37:00,514,"Yeah, the writing was on the wall as soon as they hired Shapiro. Might not be the end of the world either though. 5 years of mediocrity and one meteoric rise to the post season when he knew there was nothing to lose?

What looms ahead will be difficult...I'm not sure if Rogers can sign Price and Estrada and that's going to be a difficult choice to make in the off season. Just enjoy the moment for now.  They have more than enough to sign both tbh, I think Buerhle is done, no Hawkins, They NEED that ace pitcher, Geinke or Kershaw?  As long as they get one of them. I know it's not ideal next year but I can live with a rotation of Stroman, Estrada, Sanchez, Dickey, Hutcheson.  I can't live with that rotation, I really like Sanchez as the 7th-8th inning guy, Hutcheson, can't win on the road, and gives up way too many runs, maybe their much needed long man out of the bullpen? or trade hm, and stretch out Hendriks for that role   but either way, they have some work to do for this season before they go to work in the off season"

941075,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-22 14:48:00,479,"KC exposed what the Jays are lacking and that's relief pitching. They sent in Pennington to avoid using Sanchez and Osuna.  As for Hutch, dunno if Gibby has any faith using him anymore and that can really knock a pitcher's confidence down a notch or two...perhaps he can bounce back, just look at Cecil. Was the closer at the beginning of the season, blew a couple of saves, loses his spot as closer, but has become an awesome relief pitcher.  I was watching a bit of the Cubs vs Mets game and was watching Colon pitch...wow! For a dude his age, he certainly looked like a better option that Hawkins. If we can pick up guys like Colon without having them go bust, next season will be a good one too.  And fingers crossed, hope we can get Estrada and Price back with the club and pick up another arm to replace Buerhle and Hutch."
941090,Acountdeleted,2015-10-22 16:11:00,2562,"Hutch has really had a few strange years but he hasn't been so bad that I would remove him from the rotation.

I'd rather have price and keep Sanchez in the pen but traditionally better pitchers graduate from the pen to starters. There is talk of Osuna moving from closing to a starter. Not sure I like that.

Osuna is not a starter, and never will be, hes said himself, hes a one inning guy, thats why they stopped using him for multiple inning relief appearances and into the closer role.  Some guys are just made for a certain role, Sanchez as a starter loses 5 mph off his fastball to save energy for the long run, and that makes it less effective and then he starts to get a little wild, hence the control issues in the minors.  he goes for an inning an inning and a half, he can let is fly, and all he has to focus on is those 3-5 outs.     also things are getting wierd!

No one seemed to pick up on the fact that, while they are free swingers, they don't swing from the from the -hole up like almost everyone on the Jays. That matches them up well against knuckleballers. Ask any guy who throws knucklers he'll tell you his biggest fear is the guys who'll single you to death.  The Jays are up against it again. Not feeling nearly as confident in this comeback as I did in the ALDS, but it can be done. It was 1985 and the roles were exactly reversed. The Royals at home won game 3, lost game 4 at home, then won game 5 at home and rattled off two more in T.O. to take it in 7. Maybe we can return the favour? Let's hope Estrada brings his A-game tonight."

940166,Acountdeleted,2015-10-17 18:07:00,2562,That was what worried me most about last nights game. KC was dialed in. About the 6th inning I really didn't see the jays coming back. KC was dominating in every aspect of the game. Jays need to be better. Plain and simple.

USE SOME COMMON SENSE LADY!  the baby wouldnt be able to tell the difference from a mid June weeknight game and a Game 5 elimination game.  Regarding the fix....let me point out that the umpire clearly called for timeout and a dead ball as soon as the play happened. The Jays players did not react due to the umpire calling time...at this point no run was scored...the player then reached home plate while the umpires hands were in the air clearly indicating time out. The fact that they put him back on the bag, and then let him score, is quite literally no different than a player stealing second...being called safe...asking for timeout...the umpire calling timeout...The player stepping off the bag to undo their gaurd etc...and then the player subsequently being tagged, and the umpire calling the player out. its literally the exact same situation.  If they would have called a double play on that pompey slide, all hell would have broken lose.  I heard an interview with the Tim Langton, the jays PA announcer...if play continued to be interrupted, the next message they had prepped for the board was a forfeit warning that would have stated that if the play continued to be interrupted the jays would be forced to forfeit...unreal.  Also the tulo butt slap...in a regular season game dyson was getting knocked out...no ifs and or buts about it."
939816,Acountdeleted,2015-10-15 16:03:00,2562,"It's interesting, I believe in 'the right call' and then the 'right call for the situation'.  Did the umps make the right call on the Martin error? Oh for sure. 100%. But do you make that call in game 5 of the ALDS when the game is tied in the top of the 7th? I have a hard time saying yes. I've always been of the mentality that you let the players determine the game and you don't try to take the game out of their hands.  It was already mentioned but should Pompey have been called for Catcher interference and the double play enforced? In terms of the rules I agree 100%. It should have been a double play. But imagine if that call was made. The game changes. Jays score 1 off of the Tulo single and Revere gets thrown out at second. The game is going to extras and  anything can happen. We may be talking different today.  You obviously can't let players get away with murder in the post season but I have always been of the impression that you let a few more calls go that may be game changers unless you absolutely have to. Let the best team win.  End rant."

They'll gain nothing from the experience and won't remember it at all. But you're right, people shouldn't get a free pass because they've had a couple already.

USE SOME COMMON SENSE LADY!  the baby wouldnt be able to tell the difference from a mid June weeknight game and a Game 5 elimination game.  I never mentioned emotions, I clearly stated behaviour/conduct. It's completely understandable to let your emotions run during the moment, but letting it dictate your conduct/behaviour afterwards is not and should not be condoned. The two should be mutually exclusive from one another and by all accounts, common sense should be used to prevent beers from being tossed from above.  The same example can be said when there were some Jays fans in the Texas crowd. I'm sure emotions were running high, but I have not heard of any of them being assaulted by any way. If you're a Rangers fan, sure, you might be pissed off that the Jays won, but in no way is it right for them to be assaulted. Again, emotions and conduct/behaviour are mutually exclusive. I hope you can see the difference now."

We went to a Nucks vs Leafs game and wore our Jearsys. We got heckled lots and kept our mouths shut or laughed it off. It's kind of an unwritten rule when you are in enemy territory. We made a few friends who were Nucks fans and they stood up for us.

939880,FloatnFly,2015-10-15 23:21:00,1640,"I scared the dog when Bautista hit that homerun.  I have honestly not felt that nervous excitement since I stopped playing ball competatively, I miss that feeling to be honest.   The ruling was correct on the Martin throw though, they originally had the rule confused, but they got it right, doesn't matter that the ump called time, the runner would have scored if he hadn't, and that was the ruling, Donaldson had no shot at throwing him out, even if he had reacted right away.  it sucks, but thats the way it is.  I commend the umpires in this game, they did a great job given the circumstances and high stakes, the throw out at third, the foul ball down the left field line, the non intentional interference, and the slide by pompey, which was a legal slide, he was well within reach of the base, did not even leave the running lane.  The strikezone was tight, but consistant.  I feel sorry for Andrus though, he was part of all 3 errors in that inning, thats a horrible feeling on its own, but to then have it lead to you losing the series, is worse"

No, it was pretty obvious there were additional police called inside too. Yellow jackets and bike helmets of all things. I actually spoke to a pair of officers outside my section after the game and they were VERY happy the Jays won. For many reasons. lol  Oddly enough though, as you mention police outside, after the game walking to our car I only saw one police officer. I actually ran into as many x-NHLers (Jeff O'Neil) than I did officers outside. I was expecting to see the mounted police and at least a smattering of riot gear, but nothing.  I'm glad I recorded the replay of the game once I got home because there was a lot going on that I didn't know about. TV didn't really do it justice, because the emotion in there was INTENSE. Down, then up, then WAY down then THROUGH THE ROOF. I don't want to say the antics were called for, but I almost want to say it was justifiable. The only thing that could have done the bat flip justice with all that built up emotion was if it exploded mid air. I actually forgot about those random bench clearings. As soon as I sat down to catch my breath everything got going again. I've been to rock concerts where I was crowd surfing and moshing, and I was just as exhausted after watching that game."

Also dyson can suck it! Who is he to tell someone what to do in their own barn in a game like that? Bat flip all day if you hit an hr like that lol"
939797,netminder,2015-10-15 14:02:00,514,"Reading this thread (aside from the hockey crap that got stuck in here somehow) helped me relive this a little bit. Yes, I was there last night and that was the most insane thing I've ever been part of. Hands down.  And trust me, I don't know how it looked on TV, but the beer throwing was just pure stupidity. I'm glad I was sitting under a balcony so there was no risk of being hit. One dumb girl in our section (200 level right field) decided she was done with her beer about 5 minutes after everyone threw theirs and was immediately pointed out and escorted by security/the police. I'm not sure if the kid in the front row was hit by the beer or just sprayed, but it was way too close. I watched the whole thing and was immediately terrified/disgusted. Why anyone would even try to throw something from 150 ft back in the upper deck behind home plate is beyond me. I was pretty sure there was going to be a riot if the game ended 3-2 and I was a little uncertain how I was going to escape TO. That all being said, out of a crowd of 50,000, even 0.1% of the population (50 people) doing that looks really bad. I was also a little nervous that if it got too out of hand they would even call the game. And I'm not uncertain it would have gone down similarly in any other stadium.  But in fairness, no one had any idea what was going on. Everyone thought the umpire made the right call sending him back to third. But to send him home AGAIN? The fix was in, and we could only watch.  And then afterwards everyone booed take me out to the ball game. That's when the baseball gods took notice.  My father said we should just score 10 in the bottom half and shove it up their  es.  Russell Martin, the unfortunate recipient of that undeserved error should have been thrown out twice, and his pinch runner a third time. After that, there was no way we could fail. Donaldson tied the game with a blooper that would probably be caught 75% of the time. The crowd is insane. Such highs and lows.  And then it happens. The bat flip to end all bat flips. Unfortunately I didn't see it in real time because I was too busy watching the ball fly out of the park and screaming at it, high five-ing anyone within reach. All I could say was, ""Never in my life."" Even this morning my hearing isn't right and my throat hurts.  Instant classic doesn't even start to describe it."
939799,manitoubass2,2015-10-15 14:12:00,11391,Awesome!!!
939800,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-15 14:13:00,956,Lucky you netminder.  That homer by Jose must of been one of your top moments.  Its impossible to even describe what went on.  Go Jays Go
939801,ccmtcanada,2015-10-15 14:21:00,7971,"Was a total team effort on this one.  Yes, Bautista is getting tons of attention, and he deserves it!   Goins  has been hitless this post season (0 for 17), but his two plays deep in the hole to deny hits stopped any kind of rally the Rangers tried to mount.  Superman Pillar did it again too with an outstanding catch in the outfield.  Martin, who was given an error on the weird play with Choo, threw out a runner at third base during a double steal.  So while the Rangers defence ultimately let them down, our defence stepped it up a notch!!  Onto the ALCS....let's hope there's less controversy in that series!!  GO JAYS GO!!!!"
939802,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-15 14:25:00,8243,"Netminder, that is an experience you will remember and recant the rest of your life. Why one would bring an infant into a crowd of 50,000 people I have no idea. There are so many things that can go wrong especially in a win or go home game, COME ON MAN!  If you think throwing beer is nuts you should have sat in section 26 at the old Ivor Wynne for Cat games in the 70's. The Homeside section we called it. Eventually each row had a Hamilton Cop responsible for it. They would throw empty whiskey bottles."
939808,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-15 15:26:00,479,"Why would bringing an infant to a ball game be a bad idea? It's a family venue for a family event. People need to hold themselves responsible and conduct themselves accordingly. Why is there blame upon the parents, when the beer tossers get a free pass to their bad conduct/behaviour?  Netminder: That was an awesome recap and watching the game at a sports pub, was as close to as being there as possible.  The confidence within the Jays group is immense! And the epic bat flip, from my point of view, is totally justified. Wasn't it only a few days ago when Holland took a Jays towel to wipe his ass? Rangers/media thought it was funny and now they're whining on Jose's bat flip and how it was classless act. lol  I think the match up with KC is gonna be a big rollercoaster too. The last time they played against each other in Toronto, emotions were high on that too. Donaldson getting plunked and almost getting hit a second time, and Volquez only getting a warning. Madson plunks Tulo...no ejection. Sanchez plunks Escobar and he gets tossed out. Gonna be an exciting game!  PS: Gotta feel for DeShields tho...two bunt attempts, one goes off his finger, the 2nd one the ball ricochets the bat and hits his mouth. lol Colabello had an entertaining ""swing and a miss"" moment. lol"
939811,netminder,2015-10-15 15:35:00,514,"I agree and disagree with the kids. Firstly, when they're small enough that they wouldn't need to buy a seat, maybe it's best to leave them at home. They'll gain nothing from the experience and won't remember it at all. But you're right, people shouldn't get a free pass because they've had a couple already.  I'll definitely remember that night for a long time. Just remembering the Bautista hit makes me laugh out loud. The atmosphere, at least in my section, was great. With how electric it was from the bottom of the 7th on, I can't imagine what it will be like there if the Jays (knock on wood) win the World Series.  I feel like I should get a 50% refund for my seat ticket because I don't think I used it for half the game.  The series with KC is going to be something else though. Definitely not going to be any love lost between those two teams."

Best bang for your buck, most enjoyable experiance, most championships and liklyhood to win more.  Tampa was the top NHL team at 3rd. The leafs were 122/122. I bleed blue and white but I agree with the list.   It is!!! It's great value for $$$ and a ton of fun!!                    They have a pair of these Tesla coils mounted in the ceiling. They go off at the beginning of each period and after every TB goal.  "

He said something like when you don't care who takes credit, it's amazing what a team can do.  He also said when you see a guy like David Price running in to take the ball, you have to feel good about that.  Gibby explained that he made the change because of Choo coming up and Price being a better matchup.  Also, in order to avoid the lineup seeing Dickie for another round.  While not put a guy who throws mid 90's to their order after coming from a knuckle baller?  At any rate, they won....there is a game 5.  I'm happy with that!"

I thought that the first two games, the Jays didn't execute to their potential. Even their win in Game 3, they left the bases loaded two times.  Today's game was definitely a different story and a game played that we've all seen before. Getting on base and hitting HRs.  These playoffs are all about momentum and right now, the Rangers have no answer to our bullpen."

939374,netminder,2015-10-13 13:37:00,514,"The Jays have a much better chance against a lefty and Stroman was likely the better option over Price regardless for game 5. The Jays have found their stroke again and have realized that the don't need to aim for the 500 level with every swing. The Rangers pitching is terrified of them and keep throwing down and away. They look terrified and over-matched.  I was just over on the Sportsnet website and going through the comments I can't believe how much second guessing of the move to bring in Price there was. Listen to Gibby after the game. He explained it perfectly. Slam the door while they're a quarter mile down the road. When the Jays went up 7-0 I said to myself that they should just make a complete joke of this game. Bringing in Price before they could even think about getting something going was the perfect move. And as I said, I have more confidence in Stroman right now anyway.  By the way, I have tickets to tomorrow's game. I feel like a kid on Christmas eve lol."
939375,AKRISONER,2015-10-13 13:40:00,5558,enjoy the game netminder! the atmosphere is electric to say the least.  If you dont come home completely horse you arent cheering hard enough.  The whole price move also has to do with ensuring Price isnt sitting for 11 days again. 4 days rest...he throws...then 4 more days and we are in round 2!
939379,lookinforwalleye,2015-10-13 13:54:00,4399,I think the move was more to ensure that Price was sitting and Stroman was starting Game 5...
939384,FloatnFly,2015-10-13 14:01:00,1640,"I think the move was more to ensure that Price was sitting and Stroman was starting Game 5...   uh no, Gibbons said the game before, he will use price or stroman out of the bullpen in game 4, whoever comes out of the pen will not get the start in game 5.  now, going back to pitching change, remember, dickey hadn't pitched in 10 days, hes up to 75 pitches, its hot, 35 celcius at game time, and knuckleballs need a dry hand to be effective.  could dickey have pitched the one more out, sure, but you have a string of left handed batters coming up.  no brett cecil, only other lefty is Loup who wasn't available due to family matters   my thoughts are this, if the guy being pulled isn't pissed off or upset about it, then why should people who aren't in the game be upset about it"
939385,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-13 14:02:00,479,"With Cecil injured and Loup away, there were no other lefties to match up with. Wouldn't hurt that Stroman pitches Game 5 either. Rangers seem to have Price dialled in."

Its nothing against any pitcher, its stopping a Rangers rally and any momentum.  look what happened in Houston."
939394,lookinforwalleye,2015-10-13 14:27:00,4399,Oh I am not upset about it I would much rather have the kid starting....Price has been mediocre at best lately....good thing we had a big lead yesterday because he just might have coughed up the lead!!!
939400,FloatnFly,2015-10-13 14:41:00,1640,"long as stroman can keep his emotions in check he'll be good.  even though its game 5, its just baseball, its just another game, nothings changed"
939411,Acountdeleted,2015-10-13 16:32:00,2562,I think Stroman is the right selection for game 5. The kid takes a big step on Wednesday. This may be a story we are telling our grand kids years from now.

939425,JoshS,2015-10-13 17:27:00,729,"They probably made up their mid to throw Stroman in game 5 before yesterday's game. I know there are a lot of critics out there but it makes sense what gibby did yesterday. Shut the door on texas with a lefty and leave him in as long as he could until we could throw sanchez in. Maybe Dicky could of gone longer considering the score and inning, but gibby didn't want to get texas going... and with Choo up and lots of game left, he wanted his lefty in. I still hope we have price ready in the pen should we need him in game 5. What a great game though! Such a great feeling seeing the boys light up texas finally, and the smiles and celebrations on the bench. If we were to end up 2-2, I'm kind of glad we won in texas going into game 5 with this momentum. Tomorrow is going to be fun."
939433,fishing n autograph,2015-10-13 18:14:00,2540,"My response to the whole Dickie thing is... Who cares they won. It was do or die, why let them up off the mat? Secondly he had a man on and choo and fielder up and combined they were 4/4 against him. It could have easily been 7-4 in two batters so just leave it be and get ready for game 5! Go jays!"

939153,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-12 04:30:00,8243,"Lucas I wouldn't put much solace in what a talking head doing baseball would say. Not many listen closely but if you do they all say stupid things to fill air time. Especially in the slower paced games like baseball and golf. If one listens intently, and I don't know why one would, they all actually have cards of quips pre written. I remember one NFL telecast when the great play by play man Pat Summerall well into his 70's by then must have shuffled his cards and said the exact same thing about one player 4 times before his partner John Madden the legend pointed it out. This stuff is scripted, the guys that go off the cuff usually say something to lose there jobs. Former NY Giant running back Tiki Barber lasted one day on NBC's Today Show  for saying something off colour. Golf channels Kelly Tillman was suspended for a month for saying they should take Tiger Woods out back and hang him, oops. She should have been fired but has nice legs.  As for Americans knowing nothing about Canadian, don't sweat it because they know nothing about Americans either."
939187,Steve,2015-10-12 13:52:00,2075,"entertaining game last night.....  which was very well received by the house full of jays fans I was with last night.  I think it was big for the jays confidence to see that they ""could"" win.....  tonight will say a lot!"

938805,AKRISONER,2015-10-09 12:24:00,5558,"Jitters...my best friend was at the game and he said the crowd's energy was less ""go jays"" and more, ""Lets just wait for something bad to happen""  Thats the nature of this city and being disappointed repeatedly.  Cant wait to hear that crowd today...im less nervous about the game today that im attending than the game that i listened to on the radio yesterday. I hope the jays feel the same way.  Did anyone notice that even the dugout was the same as it normally is. Usually its all smiles, people joking around staying loose, taking care of business. yesterday it was all serious and focused. Losen up a bit and get back to what made you unbeatable."
938818,netminder,2015-10-09 15:31:00,514,"  every other game is a 4pm or earlier start now I don't know exactly what you mean, but the Cowboys game is a 4:25 start. I assume there's something in it so the two games aren't on at the same time. Dallas is an hour behind us so I'm guessing noon would have been too early to start that game."

938856,Acountdeleted,2015-10-09 22:36:00,2562,Never mind the tag at second. Hawkins has been utterly horrible and Edwin was about a foot and a half away from ending it.
938860,glen,2015-10-09 22:59:00,2641,They are doing everything they can to lose.
938864,spincast,2015-10-09 23:30:00,3279,"IMO  Gibbons has to wear a lot of the blame for this one. Letting second strings play the last three games. 1 sure, but after that, no. We lost momentum, the pitchers got out of routine and didn't stay sharp. Price's performance yesterday ? And we didn't end up with the best match for the division play off because of it. I hope I'm wrong, but I got a bad feeling about our chances now."
938865,ccmtcanada,2015-10-09 23:32:00,7971,I blame Taylor Swift....
938869,Oggie,2015-10-10 00:04:00,588,Why do we need to listen to an American broadcast of the game?  Contract I assume but I miss the regular Jays broadcast.
938871,muddler,2015-10-10 00:51:00,623,It would have been nice if we got the same calls for strikes that Texas got.  Ok Jays in 5. Big Deal!
938888,Acountdeleted,2015-10-10 02:05:00,2562,Or one clearly overturnable call on a tag at second base.

939111,ccmtcanada,2015-10-12 01:22:00,7971,"What was with the comment after a ball went into the stands?? ""Well, up at Rogers centre, with those Canadians not playing ball much can't catch a fly ball"".  What???"
939113,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-12 01:34:00,8243,"I admit I have jumped on the Baseball Bandwagon, just like the thousands since these Jays have sparked the interest in Baseball I have to admit it is fun. I have not watched or followed MLB since that strike and cancellation of the Series. It broke my Baseball heart. So hear I am, cheering for a team that is behind badly, with little hope to advance, but, it's Baseball anything can happen and happen fast. Now I remember why I played for 35 years. It's fun and unpredictable."

938288,netminder,2015-10-05 14:15:00,514,"Gallardo is slated to start game one for Texas, who's had their number all year. Price allowed 2 runs in 6 innings when the Jays pounded the Rangers back in August 12-4. Game 1 has the feeling of an instant classic going in. The Jays, by the way, won the season series 4-2. If that means anything.  I do, however, feel like the Jays kind of backed into the postseason. The Rangers won a big game to avoid the wildcard game yesterday against the Angels. The Rangers have an almost identical record to the Jays since the All-Star break. I'd hate to have to make odds for this one. No easy task here."

I expect to see more regulars in Tampa. Tulo is supposed to play 1 or 2 games. Home field advantage is usually very important, but it's not like wildcard teams (non home field advantage) haven't made it all the way before. Home field in the CS would be nice, but they'll have it in the DS and the WS (thanks to the all star game), should they get there.  If the formatting for home and away teams in a 7 game series is what I think it is, they'll only need to win one of the first two games to get home field advantage for the remaining 5 games, although the last game will be a road game."

Two stud aces, the best infield in baseball, possibly two gold glovers in the outfield as well and the best hitting in baseball, its just too hard to play against these guys, everyone is a threat at all times.

937604,misfish,2015-10-01 18:18:00,29133,"I thought the wild card game was one game, one shot, to move on?"
937606,manitoubass2,2015-10-01 18:22:00,11391,Hahahaha  Im wondering the same
937608,lookinforwalleye,2015-10-01 18:35:00,4399,correct the two wild card teams play one game to see who plays in the divisional series....as it stands now the Jays will play the winner of NYY or Houston...the wild card winner plays the team with the highest win%....I believe that is the correct format!
937609,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-01 18:36:00,8243,"Maybe I have it. Jays play the winner of the 1 game playoff of the Wild Card teams.  Winner then plays for AL divisional series, 5 games??  2 ALDS winners play for ALCS (7 game saries)  Winner goes on to World Series against NLCS winners.  Jays need to play for best record in AL to gat home field throughout ALDS and ALCS."
937611,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-01 18:48:00,8243,""" Hey Johnny D, look a Band Wagon, lets jump on and see what the fuss is all about!!"""
937612,Brettiop,2015-10-01 18:54:00,279,"Here is how things would shake out if things ended the way they are...  Correct, Toronto will be playing a best of 5 against the the wild card game winner. (NYY, HOUS)  Then we move on to the winner of the other ALDS, in a best of 7 in the ALCS....Then on to the world series  "
937630,manitoubass2,2015-10-01 19:37:00,11391,Im guilty  Frig your good for a laugh???
937632,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-01 19:39:00,8243,"I'm watching the replay of game 6 of the ACLS series Jays and A's from 1992, a game I attended and heckled Ricky Henderson for 9 innings. I think Henderson had more interaction with the fans than the game, it was fun listening to him trying to make a date with a young lady sitting in front of us. Mullets galore back then. The think that strikes me is the number of fans today that dress in Jays garb. Hardly anyone did back then now it is a Blue sea of Jays shirts and hats, neat to see. I can't remember who won, Jays I think, that was a while back.  Of course they won that day, they won the ALCS, the rest is history and I hope history repeats."
937633,davey buoy,2015-10-01 19:44:00,5505,"Can't find anything on the delay,what would be the latest on finishing that game today?."
937667,FloatnFly,2015-10-01 22:58:00,1640,"This team feels and looks like the best team in baseball.  When your secondary guys are getting 5 hits in a game you know something is going right.  Two stud aces, the best infield in baseball, possibly two gold glovers in the outfield as well and the best hitting in baseball, its just too hard to play against these guys, everyone is a threat at all times.  They fear no one at this point...one step at a time, but i wanna see what the cards or pirates are made of.   those NL Central teams are scarey, in fact, if the jays were in the NL, they may not even be in the playoffs right now, both wildcard teams came from the NL Central, and they both have better records then the NL East leading NY Mets"
934240,muddler,2015-09-14 09:12:00,623,"I amazes me how these players can remain healthy after 140+ games. Injuries will happen, that's why expanded rosters are used. There is a good chance that Troy might be back in 2-3 weeks.  The Jays are playing amazingly. 3 out of 4, I'll take that any day.  The second game on Saturday was my favourite. By the 8th inning or so the loudest cheer picked up by the microphones was ""Go Jays Go"" and the loudest loudest baseball sound was the ball hitting the pitches glove from the catcher., much to the dismay of the 4 or 5 NY fans left behind home plate. Love it. Yeah, can't stand the Yankees.  All we have to do is control our own destiny and not worry about who's behind us.  Go Jays Go!.  muddler"
934241,Weeds,2015-09-14 09:30:00,782,I'm really liking Revere in the lead off spot. Hope they keep him there next year. Seems like a long time since they had an everyday player in that spot who can hit for average with good wheels.
934425,Acountdeleted,2015-09-15 03:15:00,2562,"My dad made a really good point with Revere.  He's a great leadoff man and gets on base lots. It'd be nice to see him steal a base, but every time he gets on it seems that Donaldson follows up with a homerun. Not that anyone is complaining."
934438,FloatnFly,2015-09-15 11:50:00,1640,"why risk stealing a base and being thrown out when you have josh, jose and edwin following you, a hit and run maybe useful, score from first on a single with his speed"

The real nice thing is is that the Jays are unpredictable. It seems when the bats are cool, their pitching is hot and when the pitching is cool their hitting is hot. And some days both are hot. On those rare occasions both are cold. That's 3 out of 4 times that they can win. I'll take that in October.  muddler"

Tepara - maybe a week and 1/2 (and it showed).  Gibbons is getting an idea of who he can rely on, and who he can't.  Did make it a litte hairy, but I would rather find out now, then in the playoffs."
936838,Acountdeleted,2015-09-28 00:14:00,2562,Baseball games don't end.  Josh Donaldson ends baseball games.   I started listening to that one when they were down 4-1. Can't believe they came back to win it. Something special is continuing to happen this year

937317,muddler,2015-09-30 11:39:00,623,"The way the Yanks are playing, the wildcard is NOT a sure thing. Now that would make my day. The Jays are in an excellent situation. Troy is almost ready to be back in the line up, the pitching is set and the Royals are struggling. I like Cecil's comment, "".... unless we're down like 15 runs, we're always in the game..."" Bring it ON!"
933362,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-09 17:35:00,4399,It will be interesting...despite what the stats say and leaving David Price out of the mix the Jays starting pitching worries me...you seem to get a great start or a dog breakfast...
933366,Acountdeleted,2015-09-09 17:57:00,2562,That's the problem. John Gibons could do any combination of pitchers for the DCS and no one could really blame him as long as he gets Price to pitch as much as possible. Hutcheson at home? Possible. Estrada for a game? Maybe? It's such a crap shoot.

933319,John Bacon,2015-09-09 14:54:00,3277,KC lost four in a row.  A nice winning streak can put them first in the league.
933331,netminder,2015-09-09 15:54:00,514,"Yup, and a winning streak over the Yankees this weekend could pretty much put the pennant race to bed."
933345,AKRISONER,2015-09-09 16:42:00,5558,KC lost four in a row.  A nice winning streak can put them first in the league.  umm KC won last night ?  The beautiful thing about having a lead and not trying to chase? You can afford to win 2-5 against the yankees and still lead them.  Keep on rollin boys!
933347,John Bacon,2015-09-09 16:47:00,3277, umm KC won last night ?   They lost four in row before last night.

Now who do you go with for your 3 pitchers in the playoffs? Price, Strollman, Dickey? Price, Bhurle, Dickey? Price, Strollman, Bhurle? Gonna be an interesting month and a half."
931543,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 16:35:00,8243,"I seem to be boarding the Jay's bandwagon. That's 3 games I've watched off and on now, but do watch the wrap ups like Baseball Central. What I have taken notice of Toronto and around the league is the numbers of unbelievable gloves these kids have out there. The athletic plays at second turning doubles for example is just amazing to say the least. Yes there were great fielding way back when but not with the consistency I see today. It looks like I'll tune in this afternoon too for a while."
931565,netminder,2015-08-27 19:38:00,514,"True that. It's almost like a Willie Mays type catch happens once a month. And while it's still a pretty play, it's pretty common now. Keep in mind the gear, science and athleticism will help on all sides of the diamond."
931571,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 19:49:00,8243,Yep all major sports have it down to a science. Serious pitching and QB clinics for 10 year olds at several thousands a week with the best coaches. Sports psychologists in College ball and even earlier. Pre teens throwing at 90MPH and up. Kids in grade 9 benching 225 for reps. Bone density tests and MRI's for teens in HS. Pre teens signing letters of intent to major NCAA schools before entering grade 9. For all the major sports today.  Revere 2 for 2. Tight game. Won't spoil it for the Tevo guys.

931608,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 21:45:00,8243,"Can anyone give me a quick explanation of the Managers Challenge. What happens if he looses it and how many in a game, extra innings as well?  Going on 3 hrs and 40 minutes now bottom of the 8th. Too long, I've seen 2 challenges by Gibbons today."
931619,fishing n autograph,2015-08-27 23:01:00,2540,You get one challenge a game. If you're successful and the call is over turned you don't lose it. If you're unsuccessful then you lose the challenge. Similar to the NFL
931681,Acountdeleted,2015-08-28 11:54:00,2562,You guys get me with the 'too long' comments. Bring an AM/FM radio on the boat with you and listen while you fish. IMO baseball is meant to be listened to and not watched anyways.
931701,fishing n autograph,2015-08-28 15:48:00,2540,One of the things that makes baseball so great is that it's not bound by a clock. Everyone gets 27 outs and it's the only sport where the defence gets the ball.
931723,manitoubass2,2015-08-28 18:23:00,11391,"My only gripe with baseball is not the lenght of the games, but the lenght of the season.  Drop it to 82 games( like nhl) and ill watch every friggen game i can"

931795,Acountdeleted,2015-08-29 13:38:00,2562,I bet no one will be complaining that the games are too long when October rolls around..... Unless their heart can't take it.  I agree with the season being too long but for a different reason. Make the season 150 games and make the wildcard a best of 5 with the division series being a best of 7. The fans deserve it.
931802,fishing n autograph,2015-08-29 14:21:00,2540,They should cut the season back to 156 games and have 16 teams in the play offs. Top two from each division plus 2 wild cards. First round best if three second round best of five and the last two best of seven
931803,Acountdeleted,2015-08-29 15:16:00,2562,I feel like being top 2 in the league should gain some sort of advantage. Especially with 5 game series where anything can happen.  I really like the playoff format in my sim baseball league. Too 2 teams in the conference get a bye to the division championship. Then it's the division winner with the lowest record vs the number 3 wildcard team and wildcard teams 1 vs 2 in a best of 5. The winners of those two series go on to the division series against teams 1 and 2. Allows 12 teams into the post season rather then 10.

931833,manitoubass2,2015-08-29 20:18:00,11391,Its unreal!  Biggest surprise in the MLB for sure
931025,FloatnFly,2015-08-24 14:10:00,1640,"The bats have always been there, they've just improved greatly defensively, they have a true outfielder, not an infielder trying to play left field, they've upgraded their SS, who can take hits away, like we saw yesterday a few times, they added Price and Hawkins which have added a more experienced veterans to help the youngsters, the pitchers, because of the great defense behind them, are now confident to pitch to contact, instead of trying to make the perfect pitch every time.  and their bench players are pretty damn good.  With September coming and going to a 40man roster, this team will only deeper and better"
931065,netminder,2015-08-24 19:02:00,514,"I was honestly concerned with how the outcome would be going into LAA, after they didn't seem to show up against Philly.  Wow. Was I wrong... And if any team isn't paying attention, they sure are now. That was an absolute curb-stomping of a team who is supposed to be contending.  While personal awards aren't really that important, it would be nice to see JD get recognized as the AL MVP. I'm sure the head-to-head matchup there against Trout will only help his cause."
931076,fishing n autograph,2015-08-24 20:23:00,2540,2 walks all weekend!! Incredible
931149,Acountdeleted,2015-08-25 01:53:00,2562,That show  just how much faith the pitching has in the D. They don't have to try to paint the corners or pitch around guys.
931214,netminder,2015-08-25 14:15:00,514,Yanks and Jays now have identical records. No more game in hand excuses for the rest of the season. Time for the sprint to the finish!
931235,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-25 16:47:00,956,One question.  Is there a salary cap in baseball?  I heard that there was and some teams go over it.  Thanks

I was surprised their closer walked Martin.  He was definitely not up to his usual standards.  Price pitches tonight.  Can't wait.  Now, what to make to enjoy the game.  Classic loaded nachos and a beer.  Maybe."

929344,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 16:11:00,2562,Ahead of the Yankees. Never look back.  I remember when I was a kid (late 80's early 90's) it seemed like the jays were in the playoffs every year. We were so spoiled we didn't even realize. Then 1994 hit and everything changed. With the leafs being terrible and me not being a big basketball fan I don't know if I should feel beyond excited or just cautiously optimistic.
929348,netminder,2015-08-13 16:40:00,514,"Don't forget the Jays have played 3 more games than the Yankees. I understand you're agreeing with me, but I will qualify that with the Yankees have only one fewer loss than the jays. One more win/loss and that stat doesn't have much meaning anymore."

929599,John Bacon,2015-08-15 02:24:00,3277,They just can't seem to crack that 11 game barrier.  Hopefully they can still take two out of three and get the division lead back.
929602,kickingfrog,2015-08-15 02:36:00,8333,Having the yanks closer throw 28 pitches might factor in the next 2 games.

Five outs to go, you've got to go with the big guys.  I'm more concerned that he apparently has never heard of a safety squeeze (Post game he gave some canned answers as to why you don't suicide squeeze). You had the bunter from the national league at the plate and a runner on 3rd and 2nd. Tie the game at home first, then worry about winning it."
929636,netminder,2015-08-15 14:48:00,514,I didn't hear the response but it might have something to do with revere being 3/6 against that pitcher and an excellent contact hitter to boot.

It did take me back to ALSC times in the early 90's during the 9th inning the other night. Sell out crowds, energy, fans having fun, players too, that was fun to watch. I did learn something though, Manager challenges, replay reviews? That's how long I've been away. I guess the game wasn't slow enough before some days. Oh my. As everything else some people just can't keep things alone and feel everything needs to be improved. Some things were just fine the way they were."

928808,davey buoy,2015-08-10 21:28:00,5505,"This team is now built for the long haul,from what I hear,teams are now worried to play against us.Six of the nine batters are home run guys,the rest are base hit guys at a minimum..Kudos to the General manager,he has done well SO FAR !!!!!!Mr Gibbons looks happy as well when he's not booted out  lol."
928834,netminder,2015-08-10 22:53:00,514,"even if it does come down to the wildcard game I'd still take the jay's offence + david price any day. Although he'd be nice to save for game one of the ALDS.  I was 7 years old when the jays won their last world series. Been a fan all my life but I finally get to experience what it's like to cheer for a good team when the games matter. This is a lot of fun. So much fun, in fact, I've felt OK on occasion not paying attention to the game. Just go into it with the impression they're going to win. Not sure if that clubhouse attitude is contagious all the way through my TV... I just wish I lived closer to downtown toronto. I'd have season tickets for sure."
929272,John Bacon,2015-08-13 02:09:00,3277,Jays take the division lead.  Half game up on the Yankees.
929276,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 02:28:00,11391,What was the final? Last I seen in was 10-2 jays in the second
929280,Nipfisher,2015-08-13 02:35:00,2449,10-3. Going to see Saturdays game with the wife and boys.
929317,netminder,2015-08-13 12:18:00,514,"10-3. Going to see Saturdays game with the wife and boys. Lucky. How long have you had the tickets for, and dare I ask how much you paid for them?"
929325,AKRISONER,2015-08-13 12:44:00,5558,"keep on rollin boys!  We wanna see more than just a wildcard game, the depth of the jays is heavily in their favour over a 7 game series.  Just realized that if they can keep the lead they avoid the royals in the first round as well!"
929328,netminder,2015-08-13 12:55:00,514,"keep on rollin boys!  We wanna see more than just a wildcard game, the depth of the jays is heavily in their favour over a 7 game series.  Just realized that if they can keep the lead they avoid the royals in the first round as well! Hell, who's to say they don't overtake the Royals too? Get the wildcard team in the ALDS.  My only advice now is to not get too far ahead of ourselves. There's still 47 games left to be played, and we saw how quickly the Jays overtook the Yankees. God forbid it should go the other way. The Jays will have to lose a couple games eventually."
927570,fishing n autograph,2015-08-04 00:07:00,2540,Price wasn't given away they got a stud in return... Just like we gave away Syndergaard for Dickey... Thor is dominating right now
927594,FloatnFly,2015-08-04 04:13:00,1640,"too bad they don't play KC again this year, would look real good to shut them up with all the Bull they're talking and the Bull from Sundays game"
927661,AKRISONER,2015-08-04 16:29:00,5558,how about David...that 4th was insane
927881,netminder,2015-08-05 14:43:00,514,"Beat the Royals 3/4 and didn't even have to trot out our new stud. Beat the twins two straight and now have sole possession of the second wildcard.  Let's go Hutch, lets show what you're made of. We all know you can pitch at home, lets get this done!  And damn those Yankees! They are smoking hot right now. Definitely not going to roll over for us. Can't wait to go head to head with them."
927884,Walleye72,2015-08-05 15:03:00,156,"This will most certainly be an interesting final 50 games or so.  I heard a stat last night that blew me away!  In games where the Jays scored 3 or fewer runs, they were 4 and 37.   I didn't know it was that skewed.  Now when I'm watching  the game in the 7th inning with only a few runs on the board, I'm not so worried it'll fall apart."
927887,AKRISONER,2015-08-05 15:15:00,5558,"the yankees are picking off bottom feeders they are 7-3 in their last 10 and split a series with the rangers.  Whats more important is that the jays are pretty much in the toughest stretch of their season and are handling business. After this stretch with the twins and yankees you get to face Oakland and Philadelphia.  Even more importantly is that the teams chasing the wild card have finally caught up in terms of games played, and have all lost while the jays have continued to win.  they are now 2 games in up in the wildcard.  These two upcoming yankees series will be as close to a deciding factor in their season as anything. If you can come away from those series at .500 or better you are in really really good shape."
927898,netminder,2015-08-05 15:34:00,514,"This will most certainly be an interesting final 50 games or so.  I heard a stat last night that blew me away!

Now when I'm watching  the game in the 7th inning with only a few runs on the board, I'm not so worried it'll fall apart. I heard that too, but what bothers me is what is every other team's record when scoring 3 of fewer runs? I'll bet the Jays are 0-fer when scoring 0 runs, which has only happened twice so far this year, if I'm not mistaken. It sounds a little misleading, considering there aren't many games won around the league by teams scoring 3 or fewer runs."
928335,glen,2015-08-07 22:54:00,2641,Game on.
928336,misfish,2015-08-07 22:57:00,29133,Im grabbing my broom.
928379,Walleye72,2015-08-08 04:08:00,156,"Well how about that!!!!   A   2  to   1  win  in the 10th vs the Yankees.   Such a great game to watch.   Had me on the edge of my seat for the whole game.  An excellent outing by Dickie against the best team in the division.  Who would have thought that back in June, although he has pitched great against the Yankees this year.  Can't wait to watch tomorrow's game."
928382,FrankTheRabbit,2015-08-08 06:06:00,479,"W-L records only tell part of the story. Despite Dickey's record, he's certainly pitching better than Hutch...that dude is soooo lucky! Lol.  Exciting times in Jays land for sure!"
928384,kickingfrog,2015-08-08 10:43:00,8333,Hard to believe it's been 23 years since baseball felt like this and I still can't quite wrap my head around there being people in their mid-late 20's that have no idea how things are going to be if there is a long play-off run for the Jays... I'm too immature to feel that old.
928385,davey buoy,2015-08-08 10:58:00,5505,It sure is exciting to be a Jays fan right now. Hopefully I'll be in by afternoon game time .
928412,misfish,2015-08-08 20:42:00,29133,They are for real
928414,FrankTheRabbit,2015-08-08 21:08:00,479,"For sure! I couldn't watch it on tv, but I was glued to the SportsNet app."
928418,ccmtcanada,2015-08-08 21:25:00,7971,The collapse usually happens after the all star break.  With the new guys here it's been exciting looking forward to each game.  It's been a while!!  LET'S GO BLUE JAYS!!
928422,Dave Bailey,2015-08-08 22:13:00,1641,"A game like today's must really confuse the Gibbons haters. They won after he got the thumb from Gibson, so he isn't needed!. But, they won after he got the thumb from Gibson, so he didn't screw them up!"
928424,Walleye72,2015-08-08 22:23:00,156,"Gibby being thrown out today was a joke.  He barely said a thing.  They think they're a bunch of big shots.  And today's ump:  his strike zone was all over the place.  No consistency at all for either pitcher.  I don't mind if an ump decides on a strike zone and sticks with it.  Gonna be tight inside, fine.  Gonna give a little.  Okay.  But be consistent.  Today was all over the place.  The only consistent thing was he screwed both sides.  Don't mean to complain after we won, just saying the umps this year are driving me crazy a lot of the time."
928461,Acountdeleted,2015-08-09 00:20:00,2562,Another big win! Watch out New York. We're coming for you!
928572,misfish,2015-08-09 20:13:00,29133,"Thats got to sting. I wonder what their saying in the yank locker room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,    DID THAT JUST HAPPEN????????????????"
928573,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-09 20:16:00,956,"Just wondering if this team is for real or not.  Want to see how they bounce back after a couple of loses, but they have to lose first lol."

928575,misfish,2015-08-09 20:20:00,29133,I had to watch (no sound ) it on the live update jays site. It was blacked out on 590. What a crock. Yet they seem to air the Bisons games. Theres home team service for ya.

926804,John Bacon,2015-07-30 17:53:00,3277,They just snagged Price.  I cant copy paste here.  https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--jays-agree-to-trade-for-ace-david-price-164509117.html
926807,misfish,2015-07-30 18:05:00,29133,Thanks John
926815,Brettiop,2015-07-30 18:37:00,279,"Well.... We'd better win this year because we just mortgaged the future for 2 months of baseball.   Wow, no one can say your GM isn't afraid to make a deal, but at what long term cost? To me it is shocking how much he gave up for a rental player.  Mortgaged the future? You mean Norris? Cant find the strike zone and struggling all season in AAA?  Boyd? that's found money he was a non prospect until this year...  Or maybe jairo labourt, the guy you just heard of this afternoon when the trade broke?....I'm impressed we gave up so little to be honest...  We still have Osuna Stroman and Sanchez as possible rotation PCs for next year, the budget looks good to sign a free agent pitcher in the winter as well."
926817,AKRISONER,2015-07-30 18:44:00,5558,i thought Osuna was gonna have to go to make a deal like this.
926818,Brettiop,2015-07-30 18:47:00,279,"Yupp, me too....Norris was a guy i figured was gone if we made any deals at all this season, getting arguably the best two players available and not giving up one of Osuna Stroman or sanchez is a great turn out for me."
926826,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-30 20:08:00,4399,No excuses now eh Joey Batts....AA got the best offence along with the best starting pitcher available at the deadline.....time to put up or shut up!!!
926827,netminder,2015-07-30 20:09:00,514,time for a good long winning streak! All the pieces are in place now. There is no way in hell this team (even before the trades) was a .500 team. Hopefully these moves put them right where they belong.
926847,FloatnFly,2015-07-30 23:01:00,1640,"They will push Price for a long term deal, they have their whole team basically locked in for the next 3 years, Price would be a fool to want to go anywhere else.  Future Starting rotation:  Price, Stroman, Hutchison, Sanchez, Dickie?"
926848,misfish,2015-07-30 23:05:00,29133,"So are they done now, or is there another block buster coming?"
926854,FloatnFly,2015-07-30 23:47:00,1640,"If there is, they gotta dig deep.  They currently have 3 catchers, if they can somehow package Navaro with Dickie or Hutchison for another top tier pitcher, they'd be sitting in pretty good spot"
926858,Acountdeleted,2015-07-30 23:54:00,2562,Price will go to LA or the Yankees next year for something insane like $300 million.
926952,fishing n autograph,2015-07-31 17:46:00,2540,They just snagged Mark Lowe from Seattle... That solidifies the bullpen
926954,AKRISONER,2015-07-31 17:56:00,5558,need a big big win streak now.
926955,hutch4113,2015-07-31 18:32:00,374,Sounds like they may also have gotten Ben Revere (Phillies) - which gives them a lead off guy - and an outfielder.
926957,fishing n autograph,2015-07-31 18:34:00,2540,And arguably one of the best hitters in baseball and they'll have him till 2018
926960,misfish,2015-07-31 19:12:00,29133,Looking forward to the yankie series.
926975,AKRISONER,2015-07-31 20:23:00,5558,"this team is stacked, no way around it."
926991,Acountdeleted,2015-07-31 21:15:00,2562,This is the year. If they don't make the playoffs there are no excuses.
927111,Acountdeleted,2015-08-01 15:24:00,2562,"Also, the newspapers have been saying, and it's true, now is the time for the fans to step up. The skydome needs to be filled to cheer on the team. If the attendance this year can exceede 2.5 million, we might even try to resign Price."
927494,Brettiop,2015-08-03 16:36:00,279,"How about that for a series VS. the top team in the AL...wow  And now we start a series VS, the Twins that could end up with us jumping them into the wildcard spot.....and were running out DAVID PRICE for game 1.....Awesome!"
927497,Walleye72,2015-08-03 16:41:00,156,"Okay it`s showtime kids.  Excited to see David Price on ""our"" mound this afternoon.   If we can win this series, we will have a jump on that wild card.  Who knows, if it all comes together, and Hutch can pitch well, we might even give New York a run for their money in the division.  And we still play them quite a lot of times this season."
927506,Acountdeleted,2015-08-03 18:03:00,2562,"Gotta say, I'm a lot more excited after that series."
927511,misfish,2015-08-03 18:55:00,29133,Playing poker online there was a tigers fan that said Price was given away. I said thank you anyways.LOL
927526,FloatnFly,2015-08-03 20:36:00,1640,Good game today.....lost a big bench player in Valencia though.  Claimed off waivers by Oakland
927545,Walleye72,2015-08-03 21:53:00,156,"Yeah, I don't know why they let Valencia go.  And he ends up in Oakland.  Yikes, I kind of feel bad for him.  LOL"
921265,AKRISONER,2015-06-23 16:25:00,5558,i didnt even think the wildcard was attainable but somehow the jays are right back in the race. Seems like the AL east is peaking and the rest are falling off.

921500,glen,2015-06-24 18:24:00,2641,Jays.  Foul ball. The catch = very nice.
921505,AKRISONER,2015-06-24 18:45:00,5558,anyone watching this? Get this guy some friggin run support holy crap!
921508,Walleye72,2015-06-24 18:54:00,156,"I sure as heck am!!!  We're going to the tenth.  Every time the game goes into extra innings, I'm reminded of the August 2014  19 inning game I listened to all day, into my picnic, and on the 1 hour drive home.  They were getting ready to use a starter if it went to the 20th inning. They had used every pitcher in the bull pen if I recall correctly, although I had some barley pops on the picnic so...."
921520,AKRISONER,2015-06-24 20:27:00,5558,ahhhhhh yaaaaaa
926521,Brettiop,2015-07-28 19:20:00,279,So how about that Tulo Trade! Iv'e always wanted to land him somehow but i just figured it was a pipe dream....  The GM AA sure likes to come outta nowhere and shock us with huge moves...See ya later Reyes and your sloppy Defense...I liked Reyes but i would hate to see him continue botching routine plays throughout the stretch that could easily turn W into L  Gave up some great Prospects for sure but there is still a lot left over to potentially trade for some more pitching help.
926548,FloatnFly,2015-07-28 22:54:00,1640,"Won't miss his defense, thats for sure.  what will be missed is the great mood he usually brings to clubhouse, and his bat.  but Tulo will make up for the bat and shoddy defense.  With Tulo locked in to 2020, that leaves room to move Goins, as well as Navaro, and possibly Carrera.  Thole is rotting down in AAA, and the faster you can be rid of Dickie, the better"
926568,Acountdeleted,2015-07-29 01:59:00,2562,"What a player to pick up. The jays now have:  The best 3B in baseball The best SS in baseball The best RF in baseball.  What a scary lineup.  Just sad to see Hoffman and Castro go, but you gotta spend money to make money."
926599,AKRISONER,2015-07-29 12:53:00,5558,would  be nice to see one of the top pitchers in baseball added to this line up.
926603,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-29 13:03:00,4399,The worst bullpen in baseball or close to it... The worst starting pitching in baseball or close to it...  Pitching gets you to the playoff and pitching wins you championships....as a general rule....  Just look back at the Jays championship teams....
926626,netminder,2015-07-29 14:25:00,514,"What a player to pick up. The jays now have:  The best 3B in baseball The best SS in baseball The best RF in baseball.  What a scary lineup.

The worst starting pitching in baseball or close to it...  Pitching gets you to the playoff and pitching wins you championships....as a general rule....  Just look back at the Jays championship teams.... And then there's this. The bullpen seems to have figured it out lately, but the starting rotation could use at least another arm. I think now that they picked up Hawkins they should think about making Sanchez a starter again, and pick up the best pitcher they can without selling the farm in the process."
926709,FloatnFly,2015-07-30 00:49:00,1640,"The bullpen is good, just overworked when you your starters can't get past the 4th or 5th inning.  Badly needed starting pitching, and a possibly a closer?  or run with Osuna/Sanchez in a shared closer roll  Samardzja (sp) is available, but with his contract up this year, take the risk he'll walk?  Or does AA have another trick up his sleeve that no one sees coming?"
926715,FloatnFly,2015-07-30 02:01:00,1640,TIGERS ARE SELLING!!!! Price and others are very much up for grabs
926718,Walleye72,2015-07-30 02:22:00,156,"When I first heard that they traded for Troy Tulowitzki, I thought maybe it was to trade him to another club for a good pitcher, and not just a rental.  It sounds like they mean to keep him though.  This should be an interesting week though."
926726,FloatnFly,2015-07-30 03:15:00,1640,"When I first heard that they traded for Troy Tulowitzki, I thought maybe it was to trade him to another club for a good pitcher, and not just a rental.  It sounds like they mean to keep him though.  This should be an interesting week though.  His contract has an activated no trade clause in it, meaning he can be traded once, and then the no trade clause kicks in.  he also under club control for the next 5 years.  was a good trade to upgrade a key position, and with the slower turf at the dome, his range will be increased.   The fans tonight welcomed him with open arms at the dome"
926727,Acountdeleted,2015-07-30 03:20:00,2562,"What a game by Tulo. Obviously he isn't going to show that magic every night but geez. 3-5 with 2 doubles and a home run. Welcome to Toronto!   As per the pitching I'm super nervous about a rental. I like the Tulo deal because the jays get to keep him for 5 years. If the Jays get Price, he goes 10-2 in his last 15 starts and the jays still miss the playoffs, it puts us in a real real bad spot."
926744,doubleheader,2015-07-30 11:45:00,497,"I look around the league and wonder, how do teams like Detroit not win? How are teams like Toronto and The Dodgers not 25 games over .500? On the other hand I am not a Yankees fan but they are really having a great year and no one wins more consistently than St. Louis. There line-up is only average, but their pitching is outstanding. More than that they simply know how to win; they rarely squander opportunities. Hopefully some day my Pirates will figure it out too."
926746,FloatnFly,2015-07-30 12:09:00,1640,"the Jays have 13+ blown saves in the first half, with a good closer that number would be around maybe 2, and the Jays would be in a great spot"
926764,Acountdeleted,2015-07-30 13:41:00,2562,"Totally agree. The problem is, Bob McCowan says it best, other then 2 or 3 guys, the closer position is a coin flip if the guy will be good or terrible."
926767,netminder,2015-07-30 13:52:00,514,"Not all those saves were blown by the ""closer"" so to speak. You can blow a save in the 7th or 8th, and not all of those turned into losses. However, I will contend It was a bad bullpen by committee for a long time early on. I think they've figured it out though. Dubront was DFA'ed so they need a starter by Sunday. My money is on someone from within, but anything can happen.  It's funny the tigers are a half game behind the jays for the wild card and they're selling, while the Jays seem to be all in so far.  Cole Hamels was picked up by the Rangers. They're not building for this year but for the future. The Jays might be doing the same thing hoping that the remaining young arms come up and produce next year. Who knows. There's still 30 hours until the trade deadline."
926793,AKRISONER,2015-07-30 16:53:00,5558,"There you go, they made the push...Norris is rumored to be gone...wow  They have their bonafied Ace"
926794,Acountdeleted,2015-07-30 17:01:00,2562,Well.... We'd better win this year because we just mortgaged the future for 2 months of baseball.

926801,misfish,2015-07-30 17:33:00,29133,They just snagged Price.  I cant copy paste here.
919521,Brettiop,2015-06-11 12:35:00,279,"Personally I think they are Showcasing Copeland to trade him, show that he's major league ready to draw interest to package him for a big time pitcher!  There was no other reason to push Sanchez back, especially after throwing a beauty of a game last outting, 9th inning and only 100 pitches! Your not getting anything 'big time' for scott copeland, Sanchez has been sore since his last start....young pitchers can have a day off every now and then, i think it was a fine call."

Once the scouting reports roll in the opposition will make adjustments, and he may not be as formidable as he was last night. But it still looked pretty good."

I wasn't too optimistic after we were down 5 to nothing, and was feeling even worse when we were down 8 to 1 in the 3rd.  But against all odds the Jays scored 3 in the 5th and an unbelievable 9 in the 7th without a single out being recorded.   It was a blast to listen to.  I'm glad I didn't bail.  I probably would have, but I had so much prep work to do I thought, I might as well see how Bo Schultz pitches for a few innings.  And then the improbable.  The streak is alive.  Can't wait for tomorrow's game."

If there is any team out there that is actually looking forward to meeting the Jays right now, MLB should require that they first change their team name to 'Masochists'.   That offensive line up and defense is insane.  There really isn't a weak spot to pitch to in the order.  If you're the opposing manager, pitch around the guys that are hot, and take your chance on the guy that isn't and hope he doesn't break out of his mini slump.  The only weak point on that team is their pitching.  The second half is where the cards will be played"

920811,fishing n autograph,2015-06-20 13:28:00,2540,CN Buckner is by far the worst MLB umpire and has been for years. The warning in the first inning was justified because the Orioles have been throwing at Jose all season and I understand Gibbons anger but to toss Osuna at that moment wasn't the right call. No one in their right mind would load the bases for a guy that's hit 100 home runs in 2 seasons..... Smh

Two more wins of the rays, combined with another yankee loss and were in a 3 way tie for first in the division."

911577,kickingfrog,2015-04-22 01:55:00,8333,Bautista is going to take matters into his own hands. I can see this getting ugly.  He has. Twice this season they've thrown behind his head and twice in the same at bat he's hit a home run. His pitchers are the ones that need to keep the things inline.
911671,netminder,2015-04-22 17:11:00,514,"Two sentences: Jose Bautista is a baus. Buck Showalter is an arse.  Showalter demanding respect for his players? You've got to be kidding. Every team he's managed has never been afraid to throw at guys. It'll be at the hands of one of his pitchers that someone will be ""lying on the ground in a pool of blood"" - his own words."
911674,Acountdeleted,2015-04-22 17:18:00,2562,"This is when things get scary. In the NHL if a guy takes a head hit you can argue that it was in the heat of the game. Savard is a prime example, it was terrible what happened to him but I doubt (hope) that intent to injure was not there.  What happens when you blatantly throw at a guys head and it ends his career or his life?  Look at the first time Baltimore threw the ball behind Jose. The Catcher was able to catch the ball. Either that Catcher has ninja reflexes or the intent is obvious."
911679,netminder,2015-04-22 17:30:00,514,"Was just reading the write-up from the game on the Baltimore Sun. Funny how they said in the article on April 12 Bautista was pitched ""high and tight"". It was thrown behind him! However, the people commenting on the article agreed with Jose's sentiment, even if they didn't appreciate his antics.  I for one hope nobody gets a ball thrown at their head. If you need to do something, hit Jones in the ribs or the hip. Otherwise, just beat up on them on the scoresheet. Things like this can get scary real quick."
911685,fishing n autograph,2015-04-22 17:35:00,2540,Unlike hockey there is an unwritten rule. Throw high and tight to back a guy off the plate but if you're gonna throw at him you hit him in the back or the backside
911703,kickingfrog,2015-04-22 19:02:00,8333,I hate watching pitchers hit (or bunt over a runner on first with 1 out) but at least in the National league they do have to answer for their actions.

Maybe the baseball gods are finally smiling on Canada's only entry into American past-time? I seriously think they've been punishing us since the back to back world series in 92-93 and finally had enough when the Expos were primed to keep the world series north of the border in 94.
919054,jimmer,2015-06-08 18:52:00,2730,I was cursing and swearing at them after they blew the lead. They must have heard me. LOL That was a great comeback with clutch hitting.

No Sportsnet, so I can't watch but I actually like to listen the the game on my radio.  You could absolutely hear the energy in the building as the inning unfolded.  Muni's leadoff double got the crowd going.  And then tonight, the starting pitcher chased out with only 1 out.  Let's hope they keep it going for a while."
919144,Dave Bailey,2015-06-09 04:31:00,1641,"Don't look now, but our boys are on a roll.  Oh crap, I just jinxed them."
919179,netminder,2015-06-09 12:46:00,514,"There is no rightful way the Jays should be a sub-500 team with the talent they have. They'll come back to earth in a little while, but hopefully by that time their record has normalized to what it should have been all season. In the meantime, a bullpen arm would be a godsend. You can really tell they're searching hard for one, trying to promote from within right now. But who do you give up?  Also, don't get too far ahead of yourself, but the Yankees have won 6 straight too. I guess it comes down to which team you think is more sustainable right now. I said at the start of the year the Yanks are too old to be competitive, but I guess you should never discount experience."
919288,FloatnFly,2015-06-09 23:39:00,1640,"no, they should not be a sub 500 team with that roster, think it boils down to whos driving the ship....gibbons, time for a change there i think.  a consistant starter and a bullpen arm would be great as well"

I think they need to do the same again today. Although this might be ""the test"" since I don't think the odds are in their favour with a AAA starter pitching. If they lose today they can't let a streak in the other way start."

909975,kickingfrog,2015-04-14 02:12:00,8333,"They can also change the way the field plays by adding, or removing filler as well."

For a 3rd baseman, I'll take a power hitter with an ok arm, good defence and moderate speed over the profile of Lawrie.  It just doesn't make sense to have Lawrie at 3rd. And in his last days with the Jays they finally pushed him to 2nd base in an attempt to keep him on the roster.  But he failed there too.  Just way too many strikeouts.  But if he actually could put 30-40HR and 80-100RBI on the board consistently, then his strikeout amounts would be acceptable.  But enough of him, he's gone now which is a good thing."

I can only think of one player that this happened to, Carlos Delgado  but again, a players batting ability rarely has anything to do with what position they play. i mean they were scouted, drafted, and groomed to play that position.  say for instance your second baseman becomes your leading HR hitter, a team isn't going to say, oh, thats not a power hitting position, so we're going to move you.  try telling Cal Ripkin or Mike Piazza, who are in the top 50 of all time HR leaders, they aren't going to play SS or catcher cause they hit too many HR's"

Dave Steib was an outfielder who really couldn't hit well enough to be a pro but had a strong arm and voila. Pitcher gets the yips, but can hit, he goes to the outfield. St' Louis had one that did that in the last 10 years or so.  With the emphases on power the last 20-25 years, defence and speed are selected for less now then they used to be.

I agree that it seems like a low number, especially once you start throwing 10ks in a game, i mean thats 30 pitches right there, which realistically is more like 45-50 once you factor in balls and foul balls and thats only 3 and 1/3 innings of outs, factor in a couple of walks, and few base hit, you reach 100 pitches damn fast.

Thats where he will shine, but only he if he doesnt strike out as much as he does.   Every position on the field has a predetermined set of skills needed to place the correct player in each spot.  There are exceptions, but reserved for only the exceptional player.  IMO, Lawrie should not be in the majors.  He reminds me of a guy I played with when I was younger, Scott Thorman.  Drafted number 1 by the Braves.  A true Giant at his age, with pure talent.  Unfortunately, the Braves brought him up too quickly because they invested so much money into him that they needed him to pay back on their investment, and in the end, he did not perform."
908829,FloatnFly,2015-04-08 15:49:00,1640,"my question is what does his bat have anything to do with what position he plays? all his bat does is determine where he bats in the lineup, he'll never be a top of the order batter, hes a 6-8 hitter, someone to turn the line up over.  you had aaron hill, then goins/kawasaki, kelly johnson and izturis, none of which have the arm for third base, thing is, lawrie has a good arm for third"
908844,mattybculp,2015-04-08 16:30:00,388,I'm not going to miss Brett Lawrie one bit. Josh Donaldson is a big upgrade !
908398,AKRISONER,2015-04-06 20:16:00,5558,"Im an avid Jays fan, i usually get out to at least 10 games a year, just finished watching them win their season opener. Im not entirely bullish on the jays this year, but they do have a lot of great pieces. Martin looks fantastic and so does donaldson.  A lot of rookies this year though, they will be relying on some young talent to get them by, its gonna be tough.  On the positive side their division is much weaker yet again this year, specifically the orioles are missing a couple of their top guys.  If today was any sign of how Tanaka's elbow is feeling, its going to be a long haul for the yankees this year.  The great thing about young guys, is that their potential is limitless, meaning there no expectation except to hope that they perform at a high level.  I am going to predict an 86 win season."

We're in the age of the pitcher now, there's less homeruns, fewer runs scored per game, 5 runs should be more than enough to win a game these days"

I was a seasons ticket holder when they were at the CNE and right up to the strike year. I couldn't name you 2 guys playing for my old team. Ask me if I miss the modern game, nope. Do I miss Baseball? Yep. It's just not the same game it was 25 years ago.

The artificial turf in those two coffins is terrible, but I'm not sure players are so repulsed by it that they want to leave or has anything against atracting big name free agents. I think the policy of not signing players to longer than 5 year contracts has something to do with the big A-list free agents. And before you say anything, artificial turf has no effect on pitchers, so don't even go there. When the team is consistently winning, players will play there even if it's an old sandlot behind Yasgur's farm.  I am a diehard Jays fan and I am also very cautiously optimistic about this season. They have to get out to a quick start and being 1-0 definitely helps. The true test of this team will be in August and September when these young pitchers are getting into pitching more than twice the number of innings they're used to. The situation they're in is very romantic, but I still think outside help is on the way if they can keep their heads above water come trade deadline."

908610,mattybculp,2015-04-07 17:59:00,388,"Man, Martin looks great behind the plate ! There has always been complaints at the rogers centre/ skydome about the field, that the turf is too hard and there isn't as much "" cushioning "" as a grass surface. which becomes hard on a atheletes body over the course of 81 games. I think if I had to choose I think I would prefer grass, as would a lot of pros. I remember seeing multiple times a fielder diving for a ball in the outfield and watching a knee or foot get caught up in the seams. Every year they are changing/ improving the turf qualities, I wouldn't be surprised to see it move to natural turf once they can figure out how to maintain it in a dome environment. I can say this I too have played on the turf at rogers centre where I dove for a ball, in the field and all I got for that besides an out was a 12inch burn on both legs, don't remember that happening on grass, just a stain that wouldn't come out. It burned through my tear away pants."
908615,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-07 18:19:00,8243,I think any athlete would play on fair grass than great artificial turf. The artificial stuff has come a long way since first introduced in the  60's but grass will always be better for the body. Having said that some bad grass fields I've played on could be deadly. I'd rather play on asphalt than a clay based grass field full of divots.

Phillies, Braves, Toronto, etc.  every game was fun to watch.   the weather has nothing to do with it, its the field surface itself, artificial turf is not as spongy as natural grass, which can be made more giving by adding more water to it.  fake grass is very hard on the legs, knees and back.  even pitchers don't like artificial turf, since the ground balls are a lot faster, a lot of outs on natural grass, turn into singles on turf.  the counter to that is the infield plays deeper, but that opens up the possibility for bunt singles  heres an excerpt from http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/field-of-dreams/article18955544/  The one thing most players agree on is that playing on artificial surfaces extracts more of a physical toll on the body. “Your back gets stiff a little bit,” said Blue Jays shortstop Jose Reyes. “And you also feel it in your legs, your knees.” Many players, including Reyes, soak in a tub filled with ice water for 15 to 20 minutes after nearly every game on artificial turf."
