952488,tb4me,2016-01-10 01:15:00,3295,Canadian Gun nutz That was the site a friend of mine told me about I couldn't remember the name for the life of me
952499,porkpie,2016-01-10 02:20:00,2521,"CGN is the place you want to go.  You'll have to register and apply for access to the equipment exchange.  Watch the prices carefully.  As anywhere, there are some great deals to be had, but sometimes guys ask ridiculous sums.  There is a trader rating system in place, and most guys are very good to deal with, although some people won't deal with someone with no trader rating.  Have fun."

952519,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-10 04:32:00,10439,"I want to pick up a .243 for wolf hunting here. Tons of them around my area and the hides are worth close to $1,000 a piece. A fella could make some extra $$$$$ whacking predators in his spare time. Take the gun on sledding and ice fishing trips just in case. Saw a giant wolf a few years ago on a lake not too far out of town. Had to go between 175 and 200 pounds!!!"
