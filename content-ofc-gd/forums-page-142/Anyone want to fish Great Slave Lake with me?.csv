953445,limeyangler,2016-01-16 16:29:00,5204,Mikeâ€¦contest sounds amazing. I personally think what you have achieved with your business ventures is awesome and should be applauded by the members of this forum.
953448,Crackerjack,2016-01-16 16:49:00,34,let the games begin
953458,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-16 17:43:00,8243,"Just a thought Mr. Borger. Set up a table with 4 or more screens going showing your videos and pics plus a big arse 55"" above and behind the table at the Spring Fishing Show in TO and maybe Buffalo as well, sell draw tickets after jumping through all the legal hoops. I'm sure you will do well unless they want an arm and a leg for a spot. There will plenty of folks there that will be more than interested. Crunch the numbers, 10 tickets at 25 or 30 each is better than selling 2 at 100. I would think you may be there anyway. These hospital lotteries for a C note give you a shot at several hundred thousand $$ in prizes. $100.00 each may be pushing it especially for us retirees and family folk trying to keep fed and warm. At $25.00 I'm in for sure, $100.00 not in the budget for a chance to fish with you Mike.  A big screen 8 feet in the air showing your stuff will draw customers like Bees to Honey."
953505,frodobuggins,2016-01-16 22:36:00,127,If this is a lottery/draw type situation you might be on the hook for the insurance. You would probably be liable for the health/safety?
953538,Salmonidstalker,2016-01-17 02:32:00,265,"Good point. i wonder how many people go out with guides and not ask them to see a copy of their insurance. Not implying that Mike doesn't have any, but guides in general."

Not implying that Mike doesn't have any, but guides in general.  Well considering it's a lodge and they will be guided by one of the lodges guides I'm pretty sure the lodges insurance covers them. I know I never had insurance as a guide and was covered by the lodges insurance all the years I guided up here."

Call a video dance off, all dance acts to be put onto a thread on this forum.   The only other fair and acceptable way to end this if there is no dance contest is a paper-rock-scissors tournament.  You run your business as you see fit but don't come crying to me when it all falls apart because you didn't take my advice."

Initially I didn't realize this and had just came from a meeting about the contest where we were bouncing all kinds of different ideas around. Like I said before there will be a free trip along with a bunch of other really cool stuff. Among other things I'm working hard with Tourism NWT to get flights to Yellowknife covered as well. I'm just not sure yet how the contest will be run, only that there will be one.  Cheers"
952536,Salmonidstalker,2016-01-10 14:57:00,265,Perhaps if people bought a subscription of your initial copy it would get them a ballot for the draw. Not sure if that still is legal but it seems fair.
952575,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-10 19:07:00,8243,"VXP, that's the problem that may be in this, there isn't a draw. The winner is chosen on merit based on an essay after paying a fee. If it was a draw it's simple, apply for a lottery and choose a charity to donate a percentage of the monies raised and go on a road trip, if you have sold enough tickets, if not you lose. If one person is more eloquent and able to express their feelings better than another it becomes subjective and then the fairness is the slippery slope. Who is more deserving? Mike will figure it out, it's early. There is an entire page of Lawyers in the yellow pages here for a county of 45,000 citizens"
953196,jimmer,2016-01-14 21:21:00,2730,"Just call the lottery and gaming commission or licencing office in your municipality, they are very good at saying no, especially if you are not a charity. It's just the way it is. Those laws are very grey, so be careful. Could you imagine the shady stuff that would go on without these rules. Mike will figure it out and I have my fishing gear packed already."

I will be holding a contest for one very lucky angler to join me August 6-13 at Frontier Lodge on the east arm of Great Slave! We will be guided by Corey Myers who is an unbelievably nice young man and truly excellent angler. Corey has been guiding at Frontier for years and his good humor and skill will add a lot to this trip!  There will be a number of other companies sponsoring this contest, meaning whoever wins is going to get a pretty epic prize package besides just the trip itself!  Epic trophy lake trout, giant pike, and ""maybe"" the best arctic grayling fishing in the world in the Stark River right next to the lodge.  Have a look at this:    And Frontier's website:  http://www.frontierfishinglodge.com/  To say I'm excited about this is an understatement, details to follow!"
