953191,bare foot wader,2016-01-14 20:16:00,1354,"legislated common sense...sad, but necessary it seems  I pulled out a little mazda b2000 that had one tire stuck in a massive hole over Christmas break, just spinning trying to get out, somebody had drilled 6 holes together to make one very large hole...wind blowing snow around and that hole is barely noticeable within 20 mins  I've witnessed 4 of my friends go through old holes over the years, only one went fully through, hit bottom and bounced straight up, others were knee or balls deep...a good reminded to keep spikes around your neck all season on the ice  I don't mark every single hole I drill, but I mark the holes on busy lakes in popular spots....a roll of flagging tape will last a season, and branches are free"
953192,Dara,2016-01-14 20:28:00,3052,Mt Blizzard...what do you think..8 or 10 for up there..my daughter is getting a gas one and your pm er is broke
