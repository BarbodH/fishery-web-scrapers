I noticed surfing around the operator's websites this year that many have hiked their prices to, like, $60 and even $70 per person, for the day.  Has anybody else been looking to book and noticed this?  Sure, I wish the rates were lower, but I'm not complaining, as every business has the right to charge what they think the market will bear.

953167,Sinker,2016-01-14 16:53:00,8692,Its been $50-70 every time I've gone out with an operator.
953170,Acountdeleted,2016-01-14 17:30:00,2562,That's interesting. When I used to go it was always $40 per person.
953174,Mike Pike,2016-01-14 17:50:00,1332,"I don't even wanna tell ya what I used to pay back in the day.  OK, I will.  $20 on the weekend, and only $18 if you booked a weekday!  Yup, I'm old."
953175,captpierre,2016-01-14 17:50:00,2521,Cooks Bay still pretty wide open off shore. Warm next day or 2. Colder next week. Hope those hut operators can make a buck or 2 this year.
953178,Mike Pike,2016-01-14 18:40:00,1332,"Ya, I remember in the 80s we'd be fishing deep water for Lakers and Whities by mid-January.  Today, even the shallow water perch guys can't guarantee having their hut out at this time of year."
953237,turtle,2016-01-15 10:53:00,274,"It's been $50-$60 for the last few years, more for the laker/whitefish grounds.  Apart from the previous 2 years the operator seasons and revenue has been short for the last 15 -this year maybe only 1.5 months."
