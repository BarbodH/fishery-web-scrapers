953594,Motojoe,2016-01-17 16:09:00,21,"Hi John,  The first thing is how you transport it to the lake, you will need to have a big car or trailer, I have a clam scout(one man) if I fish alone and a Nanook if fish with friend or my wife, they both work good and last years, scout is 8 years now and the Nanook is 7 years now, I have just purchase a thermal replacement tent for the Nanook 2 days ago. For the zipper, I don't have any issue at all."

I KNOW I feed a CT General Manager (BOWMANVILLE) who is also married to my daughter.  Yes do buy them an Tim's they will remember you the next time you are in need.  Good score! I once got a crap load of lures for 20 because they were torn off the hangers, so they put them all in a box and away we went."

Lmao good one Joeytier, shes pretty willing to gever when it comes to ice fishing, yesterday she stayed out for an hour and a half, sat in the truck for 10 minutes and was out again for another hour, she gets cold but is determined lol, yes u tend to do more scooping of the hole than jigging at those temps  You can get these socks up here with Merino wool, a pair of these with a pair of cotton socks and your feet are warm all day"

953470,Tom McCutcheon,2016-01-16 18:26:00,627,"It's your personal preference of which brand you purchase, but I have always used candle wax on the zippers and it keeps them pretty well lubricated and ice free."

Very true. I was just pointing out that all, not just one or two brands, have this issue. I guess with the design of the hub,it,s the only way the door can be made."

953482,Sandbag,2016-01-16 20:40:00,533,I picked up a Clam Bigfoot XL4000 Thermal today at BassPro for $344.00 (Reg $459).  It has 64 square feet of fishable space.  sets up and comes down in a snap.  Only time will tell how its lasts in the long run but it appears better constructed than the Frabil that i had for the last 5 years  Cheers  Craig
