952456,SuperDave,2016-01-09 23:30:00,204,Bought mine last year. Several dealers told me buy now as prices were going up. Figured they were just trying to get me to buy off them. Glad I listened.
952462,misfish,2016-01-10 00:03:00,29133,"Head of Cauliflower is $8.00, can you imagine a new boat.   You mean it dropped a buck since last weekend?  I need to go and take a video of a boat dealership in the morning.  Hope I read right."
952473,wkrp,2016-01-10 00:54:00,656,Looking forward to it and going on Monday.
952513,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-10 03:33:00,937,Will they have a fishing section at the boatshow?
952515,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-10 03:52:00,8243,"We went the winter before we bought our new to us boat. It was like being 18 and going to a Brothel and told you can look but no touch. It was nice to see the new stuff for sure though. No deals though, on anything."
952523,Toronto_Angler,2016-01-10 04:59:00,698,Heading over there tomorrow just to dream lol
952605,spincast,2016-01-10 21:13:00,3279,"Lund 2075 Tyee, ,$101,000 and misc change. I didn't look at the power, I was trying to find my lower jaw... Starcraft 175 Starfish, before show deals - 63k. After show deals, 45k with a 115 yammie.  sure glad I made my deal 2 years ago. Gotta review the insurance this year to make sure I'm covered for replacement. 31 foot Tiara, twin 330 diesels (had to look), ""In the low 4s, $US$"" Parking $14,"

That is sick!  I went because we are thinking of getting a Skeeter WX only 1 on 19' on the floor, I was impressed with the Fit & Finish. Factory rep was a good guy, spent a ton of time with me.  Sat in the $120,000 Ranger 620, man full windshield and it's only chest hieght, what's the point of that?  Also, spent a lot of time, playing with the new garmin electronics, all I can say is AMAZING!  I'm sure we'll have a Skeeter once the dollar is better"

That is sick!    Sick no, OUTRAGOUS, you bet your ass.  $20 bucks to enter, are you kidding me????????????????  They want to show and sell, it has to be free for the consumer. Cabelas and BPS, SAIL, LeBARONS, dont charge to enter.  I no longer will attend any shows.  $120 g,s for a bass boat,,,,,,,,,,,,,  The economy is going to crash eventually. When it does,it,s going down hard."
952734,bigbuck,2016-01-11 15:29:00,2449,It is a nice little getaway to break up the January blues. It's not cheap but what does it cost to go out these days?? Nothing is cheap. $120 k for a bass boat?? That's the Rolls Royce of BBs. I used to go with the kids but they lost interest so I don't bother. I like my 19ft fish n ski and it is more than enough for what I need it for so I do not want to go salivate over the new boats and big cruisers.
952737,captpierre,2016-01-11 15:36:00,2521,The kind of boats and equipment I'm interested in will be available to check out at the sportsman/fishing shows in March. I do like to see what some people will fork out for wakeboard boats and PWC that I see at the cottage all the time.
952743,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-11 15:53:00,8243,"There are the ""have's"", ""have some"" and ""have not's"" We all fall into one category. They must be selling 100K Bass boats, and profit from them or they wouldn't make them. We have always had a pay to play economy. To go to a GTG and have 10 chicken wings and 1 draft beer is 50 bucks with a 2 hour drive. You pay or you don't, or I should say you have or have not."
