952360,lovetofish,2016-01-08 22:40:00,500,"Hey guys looking for some opinions here. Looking to buy either a portable flip up hit or a tent, we are pulling by hand, like to move around a lot and have a small suv. There will either be two or three of us. Heard good things about the Clam Corp Bigfoot XL4000T Ice Fishing Shelter. Wondering how easy the huts that fold up into the sleds pull.  Thanks in advance! LTF"
952367,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-08 23:06:00,10439,"Personally I like my flip over better than my pop up tent, but I have a snowmobile to pull it around. If you're on foot I would suggest a popup as they are much lighter. You should also build yourself a Smitty Sled to haul your gear as it is much easier to pull by hand. Have heard good things about the Clam pop up shelters.  I have only pulled my 2 man flip over by hand once (early ice) and won't be doing that again. Thought I was gonna blow a lung!!!!"
952370,Acountdeleted,2016-01-08 23:36:00,2562,I got a 2 man clam nanook and I am full of regret. Thing was a tank to drag across the ice even with minimal snow. I have had the pleasure of using Chris K's 4 man Rapala before and it's super nice. Pop ups are your best bet unless you have a sled.
952377,lovetofish,2016-01-09 00:16:00,500,"Thanks so much for your input, that's kind of what I figured. I'm pretty used to hailing gear to my stationary hut (propane tanks, heaters, gear, farm jacks, etc) on sleds. That being said, lighter sounds pretty dam good! Drifter, I know exactly what you mean about blowing a lung! Been doing it almost every weekend (as long as there was safe ice) for 4 years now"
952379,Sinker,2016-01-09 00:19:00,8692,"I have both, and most times, since I got the pop up, I use the pop up. More room, easier to drag around, and really, they set up quick. If I'm walking, its the pop up for sure.....unless its glare ice.  With the sled, I will drag the flip hut every time.  The only downfall is if you want to move around. Then the pop up sucks. I hate taking it down to move. With the flip over, its a 5 minute take down and all your gear is already in the sled. With the pop up, you first have to take all your gear out of the hut, take it down, and load into the sled to move.....then re-set. If you can find one, the little tool that attaches to a cordless drill for turning in the ice screws is worth its weight in gold!  They are both better than sitting on a bucket in the wind though!  S."
952395,lovetofish,2016-01-09 02:58:00,500,Thanks Sinker for your reply. What kind of pop up do you use?
952410,GBW,2016-01-09 04:25:00,8460,"I had a Clam2000 fold up and went to the Clam Bigfoot XL2000 and love the Bigfoot! It fit's two men with a ton of gear with ease (rod's, tackle, stove for heat, food space and regular seats) and or me and my two kids with what needed NO problems at all. It's not to bad to move if the wind is down and like sinker said move gear around. If I know we are going to run and gun we tend to keep most of the stuff of the toboggan. The drill bit is a GREAT adaptor for the ice screws but they (the HT one at least) will break in the cold. Still way better than by hand. You will enjoy the Clam products I'm sure"
952418,wormdunker,2016-01-09 06:56:00,1711,I like the drill adapter idea for inserting screws into the ice.  l always carry a spud with me which has a sharp point on it instead of a flat chisel type.  1 whack into the ice & I find the screws turn in rather easily.
952423,Sinker,2016-01-09 14:13:00,8692,Its one my gf got at costco. Not sure the brand. Used it all last season with no issues....no complaints.  S.
952434,lovetofish,2016-01-09 18:32:00,500,"Thanks again guys for all your comments! Was checking out the drill adapters, will definitely be buying one of those when we make our purchase!"
952435,mike rousseau,2016-01-09 18:57:00,4661,Pop up  Me and my regular fishing buddy can pack everything down in about 5 minutes then set up in another 5 minutes
952436,misfish,2016-01-09 18:57:00,29133,"will definitely be buying one of those when we make our purchase!  Yup they are nice to have. The eskimo screws go in like butter by hand, but I like the adaptor.    "

953087,Sinker,2016-01-13 21:27:00,8692,"Yep, that's the one. My GF bought it because she doesn't like being cold, and since then I love the thing.  S."

That fabric on the orange costco one seems to be of good quality. Now if they only made it in black, that would be an even better hub."
953099,lovetofish,2016-01-13 22:41:00,500,Thanks so much for all your responses! Went out and bought the clam Bigfoot xl4000 t yesterday. Can't wait to test it out!  LTF
953107,Sinker,2016-01-13 22:57:00,8692,"For what she paid for it, it doesnt owe us a cent. It is nice with the two of us, one graph and the buddy heater going I must admit.  S."
