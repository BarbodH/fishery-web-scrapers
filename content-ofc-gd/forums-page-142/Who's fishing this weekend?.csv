953291,Dutch01,2016-01-15 16:58:00,1431,"Anyone risking the ice this weekend?  I was going to hit Cooks Bday but decided discretion is the better part of valor.  Besides, I have the luxury of taking a day off next week and going out so I won't have to wait long anyways."
953293,DanD,2016-01-15 17:05:00,2223,Cooks Bay still doesn't have safe ice; from what I've been told?  Dan.
953294,Dutch01,2016-01-15 17:16:00,1431,"I think you're right, I follow another board specific to cooks bay and they are saying stay off."
953296,Joeytier,2016-01-15 17:20:00,3990,Tons of ice up here now.  Sled trails are nice and another foot is on the way today.  I get to work all weekend with a brand new sled sitting in my truck
953297,Dara,2016-01-15 17:21:00,3052,We have ice here but you still have to watch where you go. I'm just going to put a couple hundred KM on the sled...Michigan trails are good now
953298,NAW,2016-01-15 17:26:00,4022,I am heading out both mornings.  Back bay crappies with some fellow OFC'er on Saturday.  Sunday..  I'm not to sure.  I may go for a poke at my pickerel hole.  Or maybe try a local lake for some pike.
953300,chris.brock,2016-01-15 17:54:00,4053,a brand new sled sitting in my truck  You can't say something like that without elaborating???   I could go to the cottage and go out Sunday (Julian is testing the waters as I write this) but it looks too cold for my wife and baby so I'm likely buggered.
953302,Dutch01,2016-01-15 17:56:00,1431,Forecast is calling for some pretty good wind at the beginning of next week. I'm thinking I'll take Wednesday or Thursday next week off and hit up Cooks.  Someone was out from Guilford today (crazy!) posted a pic of some beauty perch. I don't want to cross post from another board though.
953304,DanD,2016-01-15 18:02:00,2223,"I saw that post as well; waiting for Peter to elaborate, on where they might have gone?  Dan."
