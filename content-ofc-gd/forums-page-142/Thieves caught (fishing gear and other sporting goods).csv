953236,wormdunker,2016-01-15 10:37:00,1711,I'm happy they found the items & the rightful owners will be able to claim their goods.  As for the scum that stole the property I really hope the judge slaps them with a stiff sentence to show other criminals that stealing other people's property is going to cost you big time!  I'd like to see what the fines will be.
