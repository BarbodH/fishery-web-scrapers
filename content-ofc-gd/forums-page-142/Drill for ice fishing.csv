953098,Shloim,2016-01-13 22:40:00,515,The Dewalt XRP drills with hammer (yes you can turn it off) are the most solid ones in their line. I have at least 4 drills now and my guys (electricians) abuse them like crazy. But make sure you get the XRP drills and XRP batteries as they all look the same. Also as far as using the drills in the off season for deck etc. I advise avoiding that as it will cut into your fishing time!. Im even thinking about trying ice fishing this year so iof anyone wants company I can be available... just sayin
953102,JoshS,2016-01-13 22:47:00,729,"Thanks Brian and others, appreciate the advice. Brian good to know you are not getting ""out-holed"" by gassers lol. If I'm going to already own the drill, might as well use it on the ice too. Or maybe just go with that killer rig drifter posted!"
953106,Fisherpete,2016-01-13 22:56:00,1814,Not hammer drill... Bye bye blades! You can turn off that setting.

952891,JoshS,2016-01-12 16:21:00,729,"I'm thinking about putting my drill on the ""Clam auger conversion plate"" this winter. But I'm not sure my drill will cut it. This is my drill: http://www.boschtools.com/Products/Tools/Pages/BoschProductDetail.aspx?pid=ddb181-02  350lb torque, 2 x 1.5ah lit ion battery's, not brushless.  Does anyone have any experience with a drill similar to mine?  Also feedback is welcome on the clam auger tool. So many mixed reviews.  Thanks ya'll  "
952894,misfish,2016-01-12 16:54:00,29133,"350lb is not a lot and your battery juice will not last out there. I bought this combo last fall just to try it as it was cheap. I took it back. Didn't make 3  6"" holes on one battery.  If you want to go low budget, go with the dewalt 18 volt with the xrp batteries. If your going to be using a 6"" your gold. If your going with an 8"", the drill will work hard. I have been doing this now for a few years. Seen good / bad.  I now have upgraded to the millwackie brushless with 750 lb with 3 - 4ah and 1 - 5 ah battery. I have yet to go through 2 full batteries. I use the 8"" fin bor 3  What is your concerns with the adaptor?  Also what auger are you planning on using?"
952904,JoshS,2016-01-12 17:25:00,729,"Thanks Brian.  I've got an 8"" finbor.  Did you test the same drill I have?  Those Milwaukee's are sweet looking....."
952906,farsider,2016-01-12 17:52:00,456,"I use a Makita for my Fin-Bor III 8"".  I baby it.  I pull up on the drill and clear the hole often as I go.  I keep the batteries warm throughout the day(Store in cooler bag with hot water bottle, etc.).  I have (5) 18V 3ah batteries available to use but, I rarely use more than two for my purposes.  Every manufacturer now offers brushless and all now have bigger batteries available.  Makita now has a 5ah.  Beware of manufacturers claims as to ft/lbs, etc. as there isn't an industry standard on how these numbers are achieved and most are numbers achieved while not under load purely for advertising purposes.  Cheers, Mark"
952922,misfish,2016-01-12 21:06:00,29133,"Thanks Brian.  I've got an 8"" finbor.  Did you test the same drill I have?  Those Milwaukee's are sweet looking.....  If you have the 8"" then your not going anywhere with that drill you have. Like I mentioned in my reply, I used the same drill you have with my 6"" finbor. Only 3 holes from one battery. The dewalt one which is cheaper then the wackie, will do you. Like our member Mark above mentioned, you will have to cut a few inches,lift,to clear shavings and so on and so forth.  Thats using the dewalt, not the bosch. Keep that one for home projects.LOL"
952927,JoshS,2016-01-12 21:33:00,729,"Thanks, good insight. I bought the drill boxing day, haven't used it. Still returnable!  I'm looking around online for the dewalt drill you're talking about... Is XRP the new lithium ion? I have some research to do..."
952928,leaf4,2016-01-12 21:41:00,2466,"As good a name is Bosch in general, their drills aren't near the standard of what you can get from dewalt Milwaukee or makita. I really like the dewalt 20v compared to my Milwaukee set, but that's kind of apples to oranges as I don't have the Milwaukee fuel."
952931,misfish,2016-01-12 21:44:00,29133,"XRP is just a larger capacity battery, It is a ni-cad ."
952958,MJL,2016-01-12 23:40:00,2427,"From what I've read, 650lbs of torque seems like the bare minimum for an 8"" auger bit. Kevin tried out a Milwaukee drill with 550lbs and it had a tough time cutting through ice with an 8"" auger. Here's the video:     "
952963,misfish,2016-01-13 00:11:00,29133,"The fuel is a big step from that one Mike. It would work just fine with the 6"" though. Kevin is the one that got me hooked on the fuel.

If the drill fails, swap the drill out for your manual auger handle and you're still good to drill some holes."

Try using your Ion or gasser,  during the summer, while building a deck or other home projects.  The batterys you can get online for sweet deals.  My total cost was just around 320 bucks. 12 months use.  Also dont forget. It serves the purpose to those that dont want the wieght to drag around and also dont want to deal with the fuel/oil stuff.  It serves me well."

952971,misfish,2016-01-13 00:37:00,29133,"Hey Mike  Remember talking about that wobble? Well I did have that, but it was an easy fix. Once you have the shaft adaptor in place and set, just tap it with a piece of wood. a few times at both ends. The bearing just need to be set in place,thats all.  Mine is true, as true can be,"
952998,porkpie,2016-01-13 12:03:00,2521,"Not unless you want to own contractor grade tools for personal use.  I like quality stuff, so my tools are pretty decent, but I saw no need for brushless.  I have the 550 in lb Milwaukee, but only to spin a 6 inch auger.  We have a gasser for anything greater than a foot of ice.  I wouldn't even bother with an auger adapter if I didn't already own decent tools."
953032,Sinker,2016-01-13 16:44:00,8692,"Its really not hard to drill by hand you know. I do it all season long. No problem. Im usually done drilling my holes before the gasser is even started up too.....   Now, give me two feet of ice, and a group of kids to set up, and its JIFFY all the way!  S."
953035,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-13 17:06:00,10439,We don't believe in wimpy little battery powered augers here in the Great White North EH!!! We use something with a little more jam!!!!  
953037,JoshS,2016-01-13 17:08:00,729,I hear you sinker. I move around quite a bit and getting tired of drilling 25 holes in deep ice by hand. I need a new drill anyway so thinking why not use it on the ice as well.
953040,JoshS,2016-01-13 17:10:00,729,"Do you want to go with hammer drill, reg drill/driver, or impact?  I'm thinking the hammer drill is not good for this application... unless you can turn off that setting."
953045,SylvanOwner,2016-01-13 17:37:00,266,"JoshS - the Milwaukee FUEL hammer drill gives you an extra 100in. lbs of torque over the non-hammer version so was definitely worth it for me.  It was the difference between being able to use a 6"" or 8"" auger.  You can turn off the 'hammer' function and you definitely DO NOT want it on."
953047,leaf4,2016-01-13 17:41:00,2466,"Hammerdrill, and yes you can turn it off"

This will be ( if we get any good ice that is ) my 4th season going with the drill set up. Many whom have fished with me, and those even out there fishing when I start to drill, are amazed. Dont let those gasser guys fool ya either. I go all season with this set up. Have not had a holed drilled for me by a gasser in those years either. And thats no B  S ."
