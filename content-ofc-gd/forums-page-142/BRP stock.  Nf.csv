952761,Canuck2fan,2016-01-11 17:11:00,1444,All I know is they CONSTANTLY get bailed out by the taxpayers.... If they were so great why is all the corporate WELFARE so necessary every few years?

952774,captpierre,2016-01-11 17:53:00,2521,I think you are referring to Bombardier Inc. they make planes and trains. BRP was once part of them but was split out. BRP= Bombardier Recreational Products They make some cool stuff although I own none of them.

BRP= Bombardier Recreational Products They make some cool stuff although I own none of them.  The thing is without past bailouts BRP would have died in corporate infancy.... Also did they not spin off BRP so that Bombardier Inc could look worse on paper to get government WELFARE?  Who are the directors and shareholders? They probably still share a ton of them with each other, as well LOL."
