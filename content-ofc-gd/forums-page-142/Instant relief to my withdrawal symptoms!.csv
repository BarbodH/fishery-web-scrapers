952477,NAW,2016-01-10 00:59:00,4022,"Hey Nick that chunk of ice looks out of place.  Where did it come from?  Or do I need to upgrade my eyeglasses?? LOL! That was the center piece of a 16"" circular hole that I cut through about 4"" of ice with my spud pole. Then I use my spud pole to pop the center of the hole up on the ice.  I never bring an auger for early ice.  I like the workout of chipping holes!  Wonderful post Nick, nothing like getting out for the first time of a new season, those fillets look amazing, looks like good times were had by all. Great pics thx for posting Thanks!  Ya, they where tasty for sure!  We will fry the rest up tomorrow.  I have a hard time freezing them."
953046,AKRISONER,2016-01-13 17:38:00,5558,"dang i missed this report, seems like youve got err figured out!  My Crapola obsessed buddy would go nuts over a day like that.  Well done!"
953059,BillM,2016-01-13 18:22:00,17367,Nice job Nick!!!
953112,can u fish,2016-01-13 23:43:00,326,Looks like a great outing Nick hoping to get out on our lake this weekend thanks for the report and photos.  Cheers Mitch
953140,NAW,2016-01-14 04:51:00,4022,"Cheers!!   Went out today,but my battery was dead on my fishfinder!!..  We still managed a good feed. But would have doubled our haul if we had the electronics working..  I guess it's time for a new battery."
953165,Headhunter,2016-01-14 16:38:00,5703,"Nice report and sweet shot of the soon to be consumed tasty treats. I notice that your spud looks almost identical to mine! My brother made mine years ago, I have never seen one like it! HH"
953168,NAW,2016-01-14 17:05:00,4022,I made it a few years ago.  Works like a charm.  The chipper part is hardened tool steel.  Stays sharp for a long time!
952353,NAW,2016-01-08 21:50:00,4022,"I've been checking the ice in this spot for weeks now.  5 weeks later this year than last....  I was getting very punchy to say the least!!  But, I had some instant relief today!!  4"" of solid black ice this morning!.  Pick my favorite little spot, in the right place.  Dropped my line down, and got bit right away.  The action stayed steady for about an hour.  We iced 12 good keepers.  But then the bite died and we caught 5 bass in a row.  So we moved, and caught 5 more crappie right away.  All in 22 FOW.  I have to make this report short, because I need to go pick up the tots from day care.  We ended the day with 15 keepers.  Going to have a good old family fish fry tonight!!!!  No tanks, but lots of 9-10""  Caught about 30 fish.  It was a great 2.5 hours on the ice!  Brian lent me his Quickfish 2 to test out.  Good thing, because my girlfriend worked a night shift last night, and was fishing on about 15 minutes of sleep.  She was very tired, so she got cold, fast.  The hut was great!   Hey, Brian, I'll drop the money off early next week!!!   I'll let the pics to the rest of the talking.  Thanks for reading.        Poor Sam isn't quite ready to bait a minnow on to a hook yet.  She tried!!  But had to do the walk of shame over to me to get me to bait her hook!  Hahaha..  I told her to look defeated for the picture..    Found out I can jam my phone between the pole and the material, and it sticks in there good!  Who needs a camera man eh!         The sleigh fits perfect in the back the Pilot!   Quiet drive home   Yum!! "
952356,Fisherman,2016-01-08 22:03:00,7201,"The look on her face is just priceless, come here and put that minnow on."
952357,misfish,2016-01-08 22:11:00,29133,"Sam and Nicky,fishing in the hub, F I S H I N G  Glad your day worked out Nick. I was wondering why the pressure to get the hub yesterday.LOL   Edit to add  You might want to remove that tracking devise that fisherman attached to it last year."
952359,Acountdeleted,2016-01-08 22:36:00,2562,Nice haul bud. Glad to see that itch got scratched.

952384,NAW,2016-01-09 00:59:00,4022,"Don't worry Brian.  I gave the hub a thorough pat down.!   The kids devoured the crappie.  I cooked a pizza as well, because the 8 year old doesn't like fresh fish... And we ended with like half a pizza left over and hardly any fish.  Still have a bunch in the fridge to freeze."
952385,chris.brock,2016-01-09 01:20:00,4053,"You can't beat a day like that, topped off with a fish fry feast. Nice Nick."
