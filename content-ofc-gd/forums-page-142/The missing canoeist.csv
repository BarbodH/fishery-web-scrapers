I remember early 80's walking along Lake O. shoreline east of Oshawa Creek on a cold early spring day. Was casting huge egg sinker roe bag out in lake. I'd sit and wait for rod tip to twitch, stare out at lake etc... caught fresh chrome steelhead.  About 200 yards out a guy with grey beard went by in a packed canoe and waved. I waved back. It was weird i thought cold March morning. No one around for miles. He seemed to come out nowhere and silently passed.  After reading this story i wonder if it was him. Maybe just someone else like him."
