I always go more then I am told. Cooked is cooked to me.             I sliced a piece and yes, it,s brown not pink like the store, I fried a slice. . I tried it first. OMG The mrs,s was like I want some. So, what ya think?   When I knew it was all good, I sliced it up. THICK PLEASE.    Cooled and bagged. I didnt go the single slice thing. I will cook it a bag at a time.    The trimmed rind is candy.        Thanks to each of you for all your help .  BACONBOTIET"

953501,Consigliere,2016-01-16 22:00:00,121,Good work. Home made bacon is clearly much better. When you cook it the first thing you will notice is the meat Doesn't drop any water like store bought. It is definitely not any cheaper tho.
953520,FloatnFly,2016-01-17 00:59:00,1640,"Good work. Home made bacon is clearly much better. When you cook it the first thing you will notice is the meat Doesn't drop any water like store bought. It is definitely not any cheaper tho.   store bought prepacked bacon is brined, not salt cured, so basically they have a needle machine hooked up to a brine pump, they drop the needles through the rind, and inject the salt brine, which will basically be salt and water, they tend to over do it on the brine, and theres were you get a lot of loss when you cook it, as you're not only cooking off the fat, but also the water.  with the bacon we sell at the shop, it does not shrink up a whole lot."
953536,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-17 02:24:00,8243,"I have retained a few gallons of water reading this thread. I have never smoked any meat in all my years. Dad never did or any of the Zio's or Compares did so we never learned. I think it was a country thing to do maybe, we never saw let alone eat any smoked meats when I was a kid. I never even saw a smoker until my 30's. Regardless an interesting thread that has taught me a few things so I can join the conversation when the crew is talking smoking meat or fish. As far as curing with salt, oh man we all started helping as soon as you could reach the table top. The job I hated worse was scrapping the salt and mold off the Prosciutto and salamuti when they were ready, I detested everything and anything pork stuffed into a casing until I eventually stopped helping make it. To think of all that Prociutto I passed up, now no one is left that can do it well now or will take the time when we can go to Fortinos and pay an arm and a leg for it. Bacon isn't in my diet. We will eat Pea Meal once every few months and that I love, salt and I have a love hate relationship. I'm so happy your bacon turned out great Brian, way to go. With a nice thick piece of that I would make a deadly Carbonari sauce."
952706,FloatnFly,2016-01-11 13:02:00,1640,"Pink salt is not dyed. It's a naturally occurring salt from the Himalayas. Purest, best quality salt in the world. The only dyed pink salt that I know of is either dyed salt licks or the pink salt used by some merchants to make their meats appear fresher. This may or may not be good for your application but it is what it is. Happy brining brudder.   im sorry, but you are wrong on this, pink curing salt is tinted pink because the nitrates and nitrites are toxic at high levels, so its tinted to not confuse it with regular salt, the himalyan pink salt is naturally occuring and a completely different shade of pink.  pink curing salt is not sodium chloride (NaCl)  but it is made of sodium erythorbate  regular table salt and himalayan salt will not work well for curing meats because they aren't full of nitrates and nitrites  from http://barbecuebible.com/2014/08/26/guide-nitrites-prague-powder-curing-salts/  : Nitrates and nitrites can be toxic when not used at recommended levels. That’s why most curing salts are tinted pink—to make sure you don’t confuse them with ordinary table salt. (Do not confuse them with Himalayan pink salt, either.)"

What I've found when not using curing salt, is that the meats do not look ""normal"" as too what people's perception of what cured ham should look like, compared to what  grocery store cured meats look like. I have cured whole hams and pork belly (beacon) both ways and the both tasted exactly the same; but the one without the curing salt was much grayer in colour; looked more like an oven roasted meat, than cured and smoked. The fridge life of the cure 1 ham was also much longer; even vacuumed sealed the non cure 1 ham, after 4 or 5 days in the fridge, started to go off.  Dan."

952945,misfish,2016-01-12 22:50:00,29133,"So as the pork belly has been flipped on day three, I have been reading more about this.  I came across one that said 7 days is best for the size of slab I have. Not 5. Two days makes that much of a difference? Im thinking its more time for the salt to draw out the moisture.  I also came accross that once I wash it, it should be patted dry and put back in the fridge for an additional 48 hours uncovered. Then put in the oven for the time it takes at 200 deg til the meat reaches 150 deg internal.  What I  am asking is, 5 days or 7?  Wash and back in the fridge uncovered for 48 hours ? The oven time I have that covered. No brainer."
952954,Big Cliff,2016-01-12 23:24:00,6899,"5 days, 7 days, a matter of preferance, the extra 2 days isn't going to draw out much more moisture and will make the bacon dryer.  I wash then pat dry and put it back in the fridge 4 hours, 12 hours, 48 hours isn't going to make much differance, you are just allowing the surface to form a pelicule (sp) which seems to allow the smoke to adhear better.  If you put it in the oven after that until an internal temperature of 150 then you are just pre cooking it. Some people do it that way, I tried it and didn't like it so now I just cold smoke it and cook it when I take it out of the freezer and put it in the pan (just the same as I do when I used to buy bacon).  It's mostly about personal preferances like some people like corned beef, some people prefer Montreal smoked meat."

952965,Consigliere,2016-01-13 00:25:00,121,Just a note on the 5-7 day question. Cut a small piece off after 5 days and fry it and taste. If too salty then stop. If just right wash it. If not salty enough more time. That is the procedure. All cuts and brines will be different.  Like cliff said the extra fridge time is only for smoking.

You can also do it in a brine, I use a camping cooler for that.   real simple curing brine:  for every 1 gallon of water, add:  1/3 - 1 cup sea salt (depending if you're on a lo-salt diet) 1 cup granulated sugar or Splenda® 1 cup brown sugar or Splenda® brown sugar mix 1 tbsp cure no. 1 pink salt  stir thoroughly until clear amber color, pour over meat, inject if necessary to cure from inside-out as well as outside-in  weight down with a partially filled 1 qt or 1 gal. ziploc bag or bags to keep meat immersed  Curing times vary with meat, but generally overnight to 2-3 days for chickens and turkeys, 8-10 days buckboard bacon, 10-14 days belly bacon, pork shoulder, whole butts, 3-4 weeks whole hams, 10-20 days corned beef (fresh beef roasts, briskets, rolled rib roasts, etc.)   If whole muscle is more than 2"" thick, then inject so it can cure i/o as well as o/i, and/or in and around bone structures, etc.  You can add any other flavorings you'd like, this is just the basic curing brine. 1 heaping tablespoon of cure is about 1 ounce.  The maximum concentration allowed safely is 3.84 ounces per 1 gallon of brine (24 lbs.per 100 gallons: 16 oz. x 24 = 384 ounces, 1/100th is 3.84 ounces).

It is not Himalayan salt. It is salt with a component of nitrate 7.5 % I think.

The only dyed pink salt that I know of is either dyed salt licks or the pink salt used by some merchants to make their meats appear fresher. This may or may not be good for your application but it is what it is. Happy brining brudder."
