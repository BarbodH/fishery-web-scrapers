951954,captpierre,2016-01-05 15:10:00,2521,With this cold weather any ice? Rain coming on weekend.
951955,Gallie,2016-01-05 15:18:00,1215,"Cooks bay is frozen over for now, was wide open 2 days ago, my guess would be just a skim right now."
951956,Acountdeleted,2016-01-05 15:23:00,2562,"https://www.youtube.com/user/THEBLUEICEREPORT  All you need to know about Simcoe ice.  I can not stress this enough, do not go out until you see the guy on the video saying it is safe. He goes out with a few members of the Lake Simcoe board. When they find 5 inches of safe ice for about 200m, they give the thumbs up."
951959,Big Cliff,2016-01-05 15:47:00,6899,Jan. 2 we had 6 swans swimming on Sturgeon Lake in front of our house. As  of yesterday you couldn't see any open water from our place. I wouldn't even think of trying to go out on that ice!!!!!!

951965,BillM,2016-01-05 16:18:00,17367,"Any ice on Simcoe will be gone in a few days, look at the forecast."
951966,SirCranksalot,2016-01-05 16:32:00,3291,Why burst our bubble? Let's us dream on for a couple of more days!
951967,lew,2016-01-05 16:33:00,12766,"Clear Lake in the Kawarthas was wide open yesterday and today it's completely  frozen over but I sure wouldn't go out on it. I was by Chemong an hour ago and it's the same, basically frozen right across.  Sposed to be in the 40's later this week so that should get rid of it again.."
951968,misfish,2016-01-05 16:35:00,29133,"Small back lakes should be fishable. I,ll keep an eye on the water graph  tables though. Not getting over excited ice will be here anytime soon."
951972,BillM,2016-01-05 17:03:00,17367,Why burst our bubble? Let's us dream on for a couple of more days!  lol!  Hoping no one gets any silly ideas and ends up going for a swim
951974,SirCranksalot,2016-01-05 17:16:00,3291,You mean like these Darwin award wannabees??   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrSFFyolll0
951980,Dara,2016-01-05 18:36:00,3052,The ice isn't safe even here...how could it be down there....stay off
951983,mr blizzard,2016-01-05 18:49:00,1589,"Its frustrating waiting for the lakes to freeze but wait, not worth the risk, we only have  15 inches or so up here on some lakes some have a little more some a little less,,a couple of lakes we were driving on last winter with the truck in December are still not truck worthy with overflow etc  but that should change by weeks end   one of the ice roads in town was even 2 weeks behind last years opening , definitely a warmer winter across the board  Be safe and use common sense"
951984,Gallie,2016-01-05 18:51:00,1215,"Yes i guess i should have said stay off but i thought it was implied, i wouldnt be surprised to see some idiots out there today or tommorow. Just remember IF they save you in time you pay for it..."
951990,esoxansteel,2016-01-05 20:02:00,1307,"Only God and Percy Woodcock could walk on water, we use to go to Quinte off the Belleville Bridge, and Massassauga Narrows when we were desparate and stupid to catch big eyes, we would be on 2 inches of ice, and Percy would come out and ask us how much ice, we would say 2 inches and Percy would say thats lots and walk out another 200 feet towards bridge"
951996,Kawartha Kev,2016-01-05 21:26:00,281,Webcam from Lower Buckhorn in the Kawarthas from Reach Harbour shows the lake iced over and covered with snow but it was wide open just a couple days ago here's a link to the webcams http://www.reachharbour.com/weather.htm  Kawartha Kev  There are 3 cams.
952442,Kawartha Kev,2016-01-09 20:42:00,281,Looks like mostly open water again on Lower Buckhorn from the look of the webcams be careful around any ice for sure in the Kawartha's more rain on the way tomorrow.  Kawartha Kev
952560,Freshtrax,2016-01-10 17:56:00,2215,"there was abut 10 boats out of tiffin yesterday,   some guys did great, not so much for us."
