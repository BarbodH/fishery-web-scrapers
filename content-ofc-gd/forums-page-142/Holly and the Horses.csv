When we would go outside for a walk he wanted to go play with the little horse running around, that might not have gone well?  I was out for a walk with my youngest daughter when she was like 5-6, and she has a thing for horses too, so she was petting one of the adult horses thru the fence and I see a pained look on her face, the horse accidentally stepped on her foot! No damage, but she learned to watch when they moved."
