297026,dnb_cbr,2009-01-25 14:40:00,61,"Hi all!  First off, I would like to say how amazing this site is.  I've been lurking for a couple years now, and i must say OFC has helped me catch more fish, from steelhead to pike to bass.  Its just an unbelievable resource for information from some very knowledgeable fishermen.  I fish 12 months of the year and enjoy each trip as much as the last, from our yearly trip up to Kesagami Lodge to my weekly trips 5 mins up the road to my local reservoir.  Here are a few pics of my 2008 season:      Last day of the trip, spent an hour across from the lodge waiting for the plane...no cradle in the boat:                         It was a good year, caught more fish than any past season.  PB- pike, bass, walleye, and steelhead.  Im looking forward to being part of this wonderful community."
