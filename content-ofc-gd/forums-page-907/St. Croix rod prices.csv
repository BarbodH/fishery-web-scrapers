I have been looking at rods for a while now, trying to figure out what you get for what kind of money, are they worth it? etc, etc. And the other day I found myself at a local fishing store that happens to have a great selection of St. Croix rods. I was surprised to find that their prices for the new St. Croix's were within $10.00 of Cabela's. By the time you figure in shipping and exchange, you'd be daft to order from the big ""C"" (or am I missing something?) I am not bashing the practise of ordering from the states (I've done it loads myself), but I was really surprised to find what I did. Could it be a hangover from the dollar parity of last year? Jim"

296007,BillM,2009-01-23 03:33:00,17367,"Right now shipping and exchange get rid of any savings you get on the retail price.  Now, if you had a place in the US that you visited frequently and shipping/duty weren't and issue, then it might work out for you."

297048,Joeytier,2009-01-25 16:00:00,3990,Exactly.
297159,Photoz,2009-01-25 20:37:00,792,You're not too far from Fishing World in Hamilton . . .   Mike used to keep a pretty good collection of St. Croix . . .    likely still does?
297179,Radnine,2009-01-25 21:09:00,1538, Bingo! I didn't mention the name originally cause I didn't want to see this  . But I was quite pleasantly surprised with the favourable pricing. Jim
