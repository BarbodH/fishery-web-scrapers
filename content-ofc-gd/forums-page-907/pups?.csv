No shedding,protective as hell of his family great alarm for the house granted he cant defend the territory if someone broke in but as long as he lets me know theres someone around i can take care of the rest!!! and he loves to be close to you which is nice..... I would definitly look @ a shelter first though i got my other dog Shylo from a shelter BEST $100 i will ever spend, neither dog would hurt a fly unless you do something inexcusable..  "

297165,GBW,2009-01-25 20:47:00,8460,"open google and type the following ""small dogs that do not shed"" and the 1st site gives you some decent info. I have a dog that shed's a lot but I love her and wouldn't change a thing about her.  She's a Labrador Retriever Cross / Mutt..."

297184,OhioFisherman,2009-01-25 21:17:00,6623,"Poodle? The small one not the standard. Got two Boston Terriers ourselves, they shed but small short hair, great dogs though."
297194,fishforfun,2009-01-25 21:31:00,105,"Scottish terrier great little dogs, google scottish terriers non shedding etc. They are small but devoted dogs."
297213,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-25 22:08:00,2050,Yorkie's are awesome... you can usually find them on Kijiji for 6 to 7 hundres bucks....much better than the $2400.00 they'll cost you at a pet store in TO.
297219,jediangler,2009-01-25 22:16:00,1923,"Santa Claus just brought our daughter a eskimo spitz/shih-tzu cross. No shedding, tops out at around 12lbs and never barks. Santa found her on Kijiji for $275. "
297227,Angler16,2009-01-25 22:26:00,188,Santa aint no fool! lol
297239,danc,2009-01-25 22:48:00,4677, Great choice for a small dog.
297259,Dano,2009-01-25 23:29:00,719,Go see whats at the local animal shelter. I'll never understand people who buy a dog from a breeder when so many good dogs are available that need a home.
297275,lew,2009-01-25 23:47:00,12767,"You may want to have a look at a pooch similar to my little buddy, Ole Marv  Marvin's a 12 year old Yorkshire Terrier/ poodle mix (yorkypoo) who sounds like exactly what your looking for. He's about 12"" high at the shoulder and doesn't shed any hair at all, but the trade-off is we have to get him clipped every few months.  He's unbelievably loyal, loving, and just plain fun to have around, and we go for at least 2 long walks in the woods every day of the year no matter how cold or hot it is.........his choice, not mine    He'll swim all day if I let him and he loves riding in the truck or the boat.  I can honestly say he's never been nasty towards anyone or anything and his whole mission in life is to be everybodies friend.  Yorkypoo's  are a very popular dog for a reason  "

297333,bigugli,2009-01-26 00:54:00,6138,"I have 2 different Jack Russell crosses. Lucky is a Jack x Pappillon I found at the shelter. An abused and emaciated little dog, she saw and chose me. She sheds very little.  Peanut is a Jackapoo. Another low shedding mix. She is the  fish thief. Both have the most amazing personalities    Don't discount the dogs at the shelters. Most are there for all the wrong reasons. They just need to be loved."
297336,misfish,2009-01-26 00:58:00,29133,Little cuddles is a kakapoo. No shedding. She was the runt and never had a better LAP dog.LOL    Her eyes get me everytime. 
297338,ChrisK,2009-01-26 01:00:00,2772,My weener dog Arnie is no more than 12 inches high and hardly sheds at all. Dashunds have a long life expectancy as well..Pretty shure I saw some puppys for sale on Kijiji for labout $700    Good Luck !!
297373,Governator,2009-01-26 01:28:00,879,"If you're looking for a purebred, I would highly suggest a bichon frise or a mix with a bichon.  I had one growing up and she was a great dog, they don't shed (I'm highly allergic) and make great pets.  My wife and I now have a Bichon/Maltese/Poodle - We know its part bichon, not 100% sure the other.  They claimed Poodle but we think Maltese. - 4 years old:  "
297378,Stoty,2009-01-26 01:37:00,2910,Maltese or Mini-Chi    
297395,OhioFisherman,2009-01-26 01:48:00,6623,My wife`s girlfriend breeds Dachshunds can probably get you one for half of 700. Don`t know if she has any pups now though.
297402,danc,2009-01-26 01:53:00,4677,"A little bigger than you're looking for, but once you've had a Border Collie, you'll never own anything but. You don't have to teach them anything. They understand English. Seriously.  "
297405,Governator,2009-01-26 01:57:00,879,Quick note:  Most small dogs have a tooooon of energy (esp bichons).  They can be difficult to keep calm and are usually the yappiest things.  So it's important you do obedience training and don't let the dog become the boss from the get go.  The good thing is that they don't require a lot of space to stay active.  A small backyard can keep them running for hours.
297406,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-26 01:58:00,182,"Ive got a miniature schnauzer, she has a great temperment, and dosent shed, great dogs and there not very big"

297432,danc,2009-01-26 02:22:00,4677,Very loyal indeed GCG. How's Missey doing after the mishap? Ill bet that she's doing just great.
297552,FLEX ROD,2009-01-26 13:37:00,394,"Little Angler,  Cockapoo is what we ended up with, the wife and kids wanted a small dog I wanted a big dog he is a happy medium. He is the best and he is also extremly smart, that comes from the  poodle side he loves everybody and he is also right in your size range -  Cockapoo 10 to 15 inches 12 to 20 pounds. They are non alergic and such good dogs that when we got ours my brother in law fell in love with him and a week later we went and got his brother so we have both dogs in the family and the boys visit each other regulary and it is great when some body wants to go on holidays.  As a long time dog lover and owner, the second choice .... distant would be a Schnazure good dogs smart hard headed hey it is a terrier.  I would stay away from the Jack Russels as they require too much attention and the only way that i know how to keep a Jack happy is by adding a second one, it is not non alergic and they shed.  Good luck,   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockapoo   FLEX - John"
297622,wallyboss,2009-01-26 15:20:00,1095,Shadow is a Yorkie terrier /  Lhaso apso mix.  He doesn't shed at all.    Here he is a year later We call him Scruffy McScruff in this picture
