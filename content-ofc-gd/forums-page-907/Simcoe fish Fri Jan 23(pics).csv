296617,WeedLine,2009-01-24 15:37:00,322,"Had a great day on Simcoe Friday. Started at 10am in 80 feet, only caught herring. I suggested trying deeper and it paid off. Moved to 110 feet and started to hammer them. The hot bite started around 1pm and lasted 2.5 hrs then completely died off when the wind and clouds rolled in. I guess the calm before the storm theory was true for us. Right before the bad weather rolled in we iced over 20 lakers and only 2 whities. The biggest laker and biggest whitefish were released without being photographed only because the action was so good we really just wanted to get them back and drop our lines down again. We used set lines but most fish came off jigging williams spoons and tubes. My buddy was on fire and iced over 10 fish, the other 10 or so caught were split between me and another buddy.  We didn't land any true monsters but it was a fun day none the less. "
