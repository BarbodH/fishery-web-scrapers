A while ago I went way up north and hit some brutal temps and after every hole (sometime halfway through) I would have to chip the ice away from the blade and the spike.  I accepted it there because it was -30.  Yesterday at Lake Simcoe, not so brutaly cold, but same thing..  This is kinda taking away the joy and ease of owning one, finally.  Does anyone experience?  What can I do?  Some sort of oil base something????  Thanks  Jim"
297584,buckster,2009-01-26 14:32:00,530,I have had it happen to me if i wait to long between holes.  Maybe clean the area of the ice You wanna drill before u make the hole.  Or go get yourslef a jiffy model 30    I know a lot of my friends have a lot of problems with strike master.  But i guess as long as it cuts its all good.

297657,coreyL,2009-01-26 16:41:00,15,i have a ten year old  2hp jiffy and the same problem happens to me half way through or so i find if u just lift it up and down a couple times hard enough but not to hard to while cutting then resume cutting i find it solves the problem it works great you dont even have to take the auger out of the hole and i was fishing yesterday almost -40 at 530 in the morning
297724,iceslayer,2009-01-26 19:33:00,97,Ya I think clearing as much snow away as possible will help a lot.  A guy told me to try putting PAM or a vasoline on the area.... Anyone ever heard of that?  Thanks guy's   Jim
