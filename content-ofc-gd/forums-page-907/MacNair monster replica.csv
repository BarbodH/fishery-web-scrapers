Who the hell cares if its a record or not, that fact is he cared about the fish and the fishery, and released the fish so someone else might share in the excitement of one day catching that same fish. Hopefully it happens and we can all thank Dale for his decision on that cold November day. Maybe lightning will strike twice and he will once again be aquainted with an old flame."
296261,farsider,2009-01-23 20:58:00,456,"Forrest, Forrest, Forrest.  I think the big distinction your missing is the Catch & Release aspect of the record.  O'brien certainly kept his.  Cheers on Mr. MacNair for being the sportsmen he is.  Cheers, Mark"
296266,CLofchik,2009-01-23 21:13:00,854," Not to mention a few muskie guys who had their noses tweaked by such a record being held by an accountant in a rented boat caught with a Mepps & piece of a hotdog   Congrats though, that's a fish of a lifetime."
296275,misfish,2009-01-23 21:25:00,29133,"Never mind that Forest guy.LOL Dale, I can respect what you did and can say NO MATTER  what anyone else says,fish of a lifetime,is something that will never be forgotten. Im not a big musky guy,but can relate if I caught the next huge Simcoe smallie. Not sure I would put it back,but your catch would certianly be in the back of my mind.  Congratulations on your FISH OF A LIFE TIME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
296284,Handlebarz,2009-01-23 21:38:00,3790,Dale once again congrats on that monster she sure does look nice and I cant wait to see her at the show in April. Are you going to be sharing the MCI main booth? if so I think I will set up our chapter section right next to you well maybe not as there will be no one looking at us LOL. I cant wait to check out the monster first hand and also give ya a hand shake and try to steel some of your MOJO LOL. http://www.muskiescanada.ca/2009-Odyssey-Ad-Final.html
296290,capt bruce,2009-01-23 21:49:00,820,"Everyone asks why I just bought my retirement home in Brockville and not somewhere up north aways . Thanks Dale for putting her back , few more monthes of work and than see ya TO I did my 35 , i will be on the river (I will miss salmon fishing and the big boat but hey my son is takeing over I can allways visit) chaseing muskies ."
296307,OhioFisherman,2009-01-23 22:33:00,6623,"Congrats Dale! Nice job with the release! Too pretty of a fish to kill, but most are."
296349,Burtess,2009-01-24 00:01:00,901,"Bravo to you Mr. MacNair for releasing that fish, and an absolutely fantastic fish it was!!!!  The memories of the fight will last forever and hopefully the next person to land that fish gives it the respect that you did....  Burt"
296396,mistyriver1,2009-01-24 01:04:00,600,"Congrats Dale, that is one heck of a fish.  Look forward to seeing it at the Odessy and hopefully getting a chance to meet you."
296468,fishindevil,2009-01-24 03:19:00,6254,"Awesome fish man !!!!   congrats to you for live releasing the monster to swim another day !!!! you did a great thing for the fishery...cheers  and welcome to the board,dont let the negative stuff get to you ....."
296483,musky_man,2009-01-24 03:36:00,159,"Lew,  Could not agree with you more -- the best part is she is back in the drink.  Might be worth a trip in April just to see that brute."
296501,douG,2009-01-24 04:20:00,2693,"The first fish I ever posted here, mebbe 6 or 7 years ago, was caught using a piece of wiener.  Someone must have a shot of that huge fish."
296557,F7Firecat,2009-01-24 13:13:00,347,"Dale,  Its unfortunate that you have to defend yourself the way you do over catching a fish.  Awesome catch, and awesome job at the release, that fish is still swimming which makes it better than any dead mount, who cares about the record she is still ALIVE!  Once again, thanks for the realese!.  Bryan"
296559,lew,2009-01-24 13:19:00,12767," doug, you wouldn't be referring to Percy now, wouldya ??"
296591,Moosebunk,2009-01-24 14:41:00,3970,"That's a fantastic fish and angler right there.  Enjoyed the link, thanks."
296592,GoneFishin,2009-01-24 14:41:00,349,"That thing is HUGE!! Releasing that musky was a good move, and it looks like he doesn't have a single regret lol. There no doubt in my mind that it's a record, Good job!!"
296604,johnnyb,2009-01-24 15:05:00,3413,"Class act all the way around, Dale!  Great fish, amazing release, and remarkable grace under so much publicity."
296967,Markystang,2009-01-25 05:24:00,131,So....Dale....what'd ya get her on? Awesome fish man! Huge props to you for letting her swim!
297014,dmacnair,2009-01-25 13:52:00,6,"Markystang , She was caught on a 10"" Jake , Black Perch . 25 ft of water , flat line trolling at 195 ft of line .  Dale"
297156,Pete Maina,2009-01-25 20:30:00,213,"Hey Dale,  Awesome to see the video. I was just checking in here and saw the thread. Neato deal. Looks like a tremendous job on the replica ... such a tremendous example set - and proof that there is no need to harvest a fish of any size - in order to have a tremendous replication to hand on the wall to bring back memories.  Not to take anything away, at all, from the Williamson and Obrien fish. Both were monsters ... my opinion is nothing other than speculation based on quite a bit of experience & study. It is certain your release was in the same class at these fish; it is my opinion that if you'd chosen to harvest it, I'd have bet heavily on it weighing more than any other muskie ever legitimately weighed. I'm completely certain you did the right thing leaving it to speculation, and applaud the preservation of an exceptional genetic specimen."
297177,hammercarp,2009-01-25 21:08:00,964,Congradulations Sir.  Great fish.   Your are a winner twice over. Once for catching a brute like that and twice for the live release. You put that fish back knowing full well that it open up your catch to critisizm and it shows what a true conservationist and sportman you are.
297266,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-25 23:35:00,709,AWESOME BEAST!  congrats on the C&R  Not to stir the pot about anything but IMO bad mount. missing a little action in the mount.  but still a verry nice story!  love the way you fooled her!
297553,ehg,2009-01-26 13:38:00,2666,No doubt perhaps one of the largest muskies ever caught. Kudos on the release back to its environment to continue living. Probably the pinnacle of musky fishing especially since it was the goal. Awesome!

296124,BillM,2009-01-23 14:56:00,17367,"Man, that thing is FAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
296126,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-23 15:01:00,3761,"What a huge fish, catching a world record sized musky  wow must of been a amazing experience,  Congrads!!"
296127,Zubris21,2009-01-23 15:01:00,563,"Beautiful fish!  and its good seeing Doug Jeffries again,  haven't seen him in a while!"
296131,Stoty,2009-01-23 15:07:00,2910,"I think its total crap that the fish needs to be killed to actually have a ""record"". Especially now-a-days when green/conservation is such a HUGE issue around the world.  Kudos to him for being the bigger man and releasing that fish! Everyone KNOWS its a record, so that's all he needs to know!  Wicked fish!!!"
296134,Leecher,2009-01-23 15:10:00,7832,Biggest I've ever seen and the replica is enormous Thanks for sharing Leechman
296139,BillM,2009-01-23 15:14:00,17367," Unless every boat has a certified weigh scale, how exactly would that work?  I think there should be a live release category so he could get some recognition for that brute."
296142,anders,2009-01-23 15:23:00,1168,thats is a TANK!  Great job by the angler and the taxidermist for doing a great job!
296151,GBW,2009-01-23 15:54:00,8460,"1 word on that fish, MONSTER!!!"
296161,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-23 16:13:00,10439,That thing makes my 53 1/2 incher look tiny!!!! That is a sweet ski and even better it's still swimming!!!!!
296162,purekgw,2009-01-23 16:14:00,585,thats one big fishy
296165,trapshooter,2009-01-23 16:20:00,1234,Thanks for the link.  Great turn around time on that replica.  I assume it's making the rounds at the shows this winter.  Congrats again to Dale.  Awesome fish!!
296170,Musky or Specks,2009-01-23 16:27:00,2710,I would think so I remember williamsons fish made the rounds the winter after it was caught
296175,lew,2009-01-23 16:34:00,12767,"That fish is a definate brute & I'm looking forward to seeing the replica up close at the Musky Odyssee this coming April.  Also nice to see someone land that monster and not care about any record, just put her back in the river where she belongs.  That to me is the best part of this whole story !!"
296189,bucktail,2009-01-23 17:31:00,1857,"Very cool! Kudos to the angler, thats how every big fish story should end!"
296191,Pigeontroller,2009-01-23 17:34:00,2793,You said it Lew!
296217,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-23 18:20:00,2585,yeah im impressed he put it back!  it sure is a beauty fish that is for sure!  Cheers!
296234,forrest,2009-01-23 19:11:00,1032,"OK.....people can just send me PMs: call me every name in the book and make insults.  Let off the steam.  I won't take offence.  I WILL READ THEM, Please do not ruin the thread.  I am not jealous or envious it is a big fish that required a lot of dedication to catch and is a notable accomplishment.  I am part of everyone and I do not KNOW it is a WR.  Suddenly Mr. MacNair seems to be saying it is and the press is saying it is and that this beast now has an official weight of 65lbs when it is documented that only length measurements were taken.  Nothing like distorting the truth eh?  A little here a little there.....but that is what fish tales are (yeah....I must be guilty too   )  No doubt some tourism interests are helping to push this along.  Yes, thanks to Mr. MacNair that fish is out there ready reproduce and or be caught again.  Anyone want to go?  forrest  PS: 2nd place official WR Muskie: http://www.worldrecordmuskiealliance.com/images/obrien.jpg with a directly measured weight of 65lbs......give the guy credit he earned it.  His name is Ken O'Brien"
296237,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-23 19:21:00,1362,Whether's it's truely a World record or not....one thing's for sure....IT'S A BIG MUSKIE and probably the biggest I've seen so far....
296241,dmacnair,2009-01-23 19:36:00,6,"First off I would like to thank you for the great comments . You will be able to see the Replica at the 2009 Musky Odyssey in St. Catherine's .  Now onto business : Forrest ,  I don't think you listened to the interview fully, nowhere in that interview did I say that it was a World Record. I said that after I saw her jump out of the water 25 ft back of the boat , I Said "" I knew that I had a record fish "" The Gananoque Chapter of MCI who manages the BOARD , is posting my Muskie as the Largest Muskie caught for the 2008 season with a weight of 65.24 lbs , they gave it that weight using a formula : L X G / 25-10 = while doing the TV interview , I was asked if it was a World Record , I said "" depends on who you ask "". Not sure where you have been reading , but both length and girth measurments were take : 57 x 33  Hope you can attend the Odyessy and see her for yourself .  cheers Dale MacNair 57 x 33"
296248,lew,2009-01-23 20:02:00,12767,"Dale, good of you to stop by and it'd be nice to have you as a regular member of this board.  That was truley a monster fish and the fact that you released it to swim another day made the entire story that much better.  I'll definetely be listening to your tale at the Odyssee in a couple months."
296251,BillM,2009-01-23 20:14:00,17367,"Forrest, you need to give it up man.  You've ruined every single thread about this fish.  Dale, awesome fish and welcome to OFC!"
296252,Terry,2009-01-23 20:28:00,14456,"Dale, beautiful fish bud I am so jealous but it still swims out there so I have a chance of catching it thanks"
296255,forrest,2009-01-23 20:42:00,1032,"Thanks for clearing that up Dale....I had a feeling the press was doing a bit of bending.  I too think it took guts to release that fish.  I guess it would have taken guts to keep it too  .  Not everyone can be happy all the time.  The press has taken what you said and turned it into a World Record with an official weight of 65lbs.  How do most people (and some people here) read that?  I think they read it as Dale MacNair caught a World Record fish of 65lbs weighed on a scale.....he even said he knew it was a record as soon as he caught it.  The press is a bit disrespectful of Ken O'Brien, but, that is what the press and salesmen do.  I think there will be a few more Musky charters in the area next year....if I am close I will want to take a look at the replica for sure.  forrest"
296257,Whopper,2009-01-23 20:53:00,2174,"Nice turnabout Forrest since Mr MacNair showed up    The fish is a real brute, had some friends see (replica) it in person at the Chicago show and they said the none of the pics do this fish justice.  Well done Mr MacNair   edit to spell the man's name right"
