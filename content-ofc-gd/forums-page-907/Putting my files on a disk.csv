297867,rbaquial,2009-01-26 23:52:00,968,"How much information do you have to save? If you aren't sure... highlight ALL THE FILES YOU WANT SAVED (easier if they're all in the same directory) right-click > properties - if you look @ ""SIZE ON DISK"" it should give you the size of the files combined..."
297879,GBW,2009-01-27 00:02:00,8460,"Brian, porn comes and goes so do you really want to make a back up of it?  HAHAHA, JUST KIDDING! What burning software do you have now as this will help us too..."
297908,misfish,2009-01-27 00:36:00,29133,"I got all the porn I need right here bud.LOL I WANTED TO SAVE ALL MY PICS AND VIDS,1353. I JUST DID IT. Thanks A2F.  Im off to burn all my 1000+ songs now.    Looking for a new pc now."
297914,GBW,2009-01-27 00:50:00,8460,well that's not fun... Good to see you got it all worked out though.  It's very easy to do and worth the few minutes it takes every few months so you never miss that special pic's due to a pc problem...
297916,Terry,2009-01-27 00:52:00,14456,"if you are getting a new PC you could take the old hard drive out of your puter and hook it up to your new one windows will not work on it but all info pictures and porn  fish porn that is, could be accessible form your new puter"
