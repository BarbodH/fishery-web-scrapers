297577,bassman,2009-01-26 14:24:00,384,Can't go wrong with the Rapala knife. They're cheap and well made.
297581,sneak_e_pete,2009-01-26 14:27:00,540,"Does Rapala make just one model?  If not, which model would you recommend?  Thanks for the input."
297583,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-26 14:32:00,2582,I have the rapala knife family completely covered. 2 wooden handle 6 inch fillet knives and the electric at home and the 6 inch black plastic handled one at the cottage.  I think the black and wooden handled ones both have the same steel in them so go with whatever you like the best. As far as I am concerned you can't go wrong with any of there knives.
297596,iceslayer,2009-01-26 14:40:00,97,I agree 100%   Jim
297598,bucktail,2009-01-26 14:42:00,1857,"Rapala has one out with a TFE coating on the blade now, supposed to slide through fish easier. I looked for it last year and could never find it."
297613,bigugli,2009-01-26 15:02:00,6138,"For a blade with great flex it's the Rapala hands down. A good, durable knife. I've still got my first knife from 35 years back. For bigger fish, however a blade with a bit more backbone is more suitable. For that I have a knife from Mora. Made next door in Sweden, they keep a very keen edge and hold it better when cutting through the bigger fish."
297619,Billy Bob,2009-01-26 15:12:00,5865,"A FOUR INCH Rapala fillet knife. That's right 4"" blade has more control than a six inch blade and I have filleted Salmon up to 30 lbs with it. But most fish are much smaller and don't require anything larger.  I just replaced a fillet knife and you can see why "
297633,bassman,2009-01-26 15:35:00,384,   Wow! That must have filleted thousands of fish. It's now an ice pick.
297635,Zubris21,2009-01-26 15:36:00,563,  wow!  how long have you had that top knife?  I thought it was an oyster knife at first.
297637,Beats,2009-01-26 15:40:00,543,"  Wow,  have you been sharpening that on a skate sharpener or something??   That looks like some sort of prison weapon.  You must have cleaned a few fish in your day to wear a knife down like that."
297685,tinbanger,2009-01-26 17:47:00,1028,"Rapala for sure.  Keeping it sharp helps.  Best THing I found for sharpening ( cheap and easy ) is the red square ( 3"" x 3"") sharpener available from CTC ( find it in th efishing section) Works on all knives to give them a quick touch up. Cheap ( I lose things alot !) and easy to carry.  tb"
297723,Billy Bob,2009-01-26 19:31:00,5865, Over the years I would say several thousand. Mostly crappie and Lake Erie Perch but also a LOT of walleye. Now I release MANY more fish than keep except for those Lake Erie Perch. Can't see letting them go for the gill netters.  BTW.......... Perch are the toughest on a fillet knife. Their tough skin and scales dull a knife faster than any other fish I have ever filleted.  Bob
297787,bassjnkie,2009-01-26 21:14:00,1101,I like the Rapalas also. But my favorite is the Kershaw Clearwater II Fillet Knife.  http://www.discountcutlery.net/en-us/dept_23733.html
