Got set-up around 4:00PM and shortly afterwards, it was non stop action   ...I was off the ice by 5:30PM with a 5 out of 8 record...The bigger eyes were caught aggressively jigging a spoon tipped with a full size golden shiner....the Windlass tip-up had a jig head and same size shiners, but produced much smaller eyes...  I kept 2 for dinner and threw the others back for a chance to grow bigger...    "
296089,Leecher,2009-01-23 13:41:00,7832,"Great report and pics Steve  Real nice looking eyes    Got to love it when fish are active and get non stop action What was the length of the ones on the pics?  Looks to me like around 17"" - 19"" Good job Steve and thanks for sharing Jacques"
