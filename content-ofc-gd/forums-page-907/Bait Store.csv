295836,Shoredump,2009-01-22 18:03:00,2,"Long time ready, first time poster.  Each year we have a group of guys that travel north to do some fishing near the Moon River.  We have purchased bait from ""Bait On The Lake"" near Bracebridge ever since we started using live bait.  John at BOTL is a great guy - but we are looking for other locations that may have 3 to 6 inch chubs, suckers, shiners between Barrie and Mactier.  The key here is to not have to pass our destination, turn around and go back.  We hope to save some time, gas and get on the water more quickly.  Any locations someone could recommend?  Thanks,"
295842,Raf,2009-01-22 18:30:00,3495,"i'm sure you'll get a real reply soon but there should be a shop in port severn.. if not, i bet you can get bait in woods, arnolds bays or blackstone harbour at one of the lodges."
295862,Drew_10,2009-01-22 20:35:00,111,You could try Perk's in Bala right off the 169 near the Kee to Bala.  They may have some decent size baitfish
295902,Rombo,2009-01-22 23:12:00,39,purk's is closed for the winter. If you take hwy 11 go to elwood eps just past weber's (big yellow bridge). It used to be called pete's bait shop
295908,Cudz,2009-01-22 23:43:00,2652,He goes up the 400. There must be something near Severn. You can get shiners from Simcoe bait and tackle but it is 5 mins off the highway and in Barrie. You can always stop off at that truck stop rest area shop around king city (i know it is south of Barrie but it is right on the highway).  It is called fish Ontario.  Lots of guys here don't really like his prices though. I have been in teh shop but never bought anything there before.
295939,Rizzo,2009-01-23 00:46:00,4754,I think there is a place (fesserton?) about 5 minutes off the highway near hwy 400/hwy 12. the place in Barrie does not carry anything bigger than emerald shiners...ok for hammerhandles but not the big boys if you're after pike
295940,Drew_10,2009-01-23 00:46:00,111,"Whoops!   I didn't know Purks closes for the winter, I only ever that place up in the summer."
295945,misfish,2009-01-23 00:55:00,29133,Ever thought of trapping or netting while you are there? One of the best parts of the trip.IMO.
296937,Markystang,2009-01-25 03:50:00,131,"Check out that Fish On-tario store behind the Petro Canada at the service center on the 400. I don't know if he'll have the big ones, but I'm pretty sure he does have live bait, and he seems to be open pretty crazy hours too."
297007,duckdog,2009-01-25 13:21:00,162,"Bush's livery in Port Severn, and Derek's just as you go into Waub, I used to live in Port Severn but its bin years so check first"
297017,bigugli,2009-01-25 13:58:00,6138,"Best bet would be the bait shop in Fesserton on #12. Last time up to Pt Severn there were no bait shops any more in Port Severn, Honey Harbour, or Waubushene. They had closed down."
297100,camillj,2009-01-25 17:49:00,1988,"BOTL is now at Glen Orchard (not far from Mactier) ...and yes John is a great guy... it used to be in Port Carling... I believe the other fellow in Bracebridge is still there (I never go up hwy 11 any more so I am not sure)  I have often got the great BIG suckers from behind the PetroCan station on the 400 as mentioned ... its just before the King side road exit and normally has quite a wide variety of choices ... and they open long before the sun comes up ... so you can double up with a timmies stop and minnow pickup ... havent been in there in a while so I am not sure if they were affected by the whole who-can-sell-what-bait-where rigmarole  I am pretty sure most of the other bait shops on that route tend to be closed for the winter including Perks, Pier 69, Marshes .. although I understand that there is someone in Mactier who also sells bait in the winter ...  You may want to call these folks to see as well : Moon Basin Marina & Cottages Mactier, 722 Basin Marina Rd. Mactier  ON  CAN  P0C 1H0,    1 705 375-2288"
