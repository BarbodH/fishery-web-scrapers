297815,Weeds,2009-01-26 22:25:00,782,"Hi, I'd appreciate it if anyone could tell me what size and type of hook to use when wacky rigging a 5 inch Senko. I understand a 4/0 or 5/0 offset when texas rigging from using the search function but I never really found out what size to use when wacky rigging.  Thanks.  I'm slowly putting the Summer tackle box together now, helps to pass the Winter."

297820,tinbanger,2009-01-26 22:33:00,1028,"been using the same hook (4 or 5/0) but having said that don't wacky rig alot. tried the o ring idea but had difficaulty finding the right size.  Did see a neat tip while looking thru some old fishing mags . Cut a section ( 1/2 "" or so ) from an old used up tube and slide that over the plastic worm , piecring thru the tube and worm with the hook .  Also find the Strike King Zero's a more durable plastic.  TB"
297851,River Rat,2009-01-26 23:05:00,161,"I like to use circle hooks to, not sure what brand I bought last time but they were not as enclosed and work great. Zero gut hooks.  I run wacky when ever I can. Good way to keep em on and add a color to the bait is go to Princess Auto and buy some large heat shrink tubing. It comes in different colors like yellow, red, white, blue and black. cut it into little strips and heat shrink them on with a propane torch.....holds great under hooked or even better pierced.  Cheers  RR"

297911,Weeds,2009-01-27 00:45:00,782,Cool. Thanks.
297919,Garry2Rs,2009-01-27 00:58:00,1425,"I switch back and forth between wacky and texaposed, so I just use the 3/0 EWG that is my standard worm hook. I don't think the hook has any effect on the fish or the hook-up rate.  I like how easy it is to remove I did try some weedless hooks last summer and they worked okay, but unless your deep in the slop, a bare-naked EWG hook is good enough. Tinbanger... The key too the ""O"" ring trick is to buy the wacky worm tool from BPS or your local bait store. It's almost impossible to pull a worm through a small enough ""O"" ring without damaging it. The tool is simplicity it's self.  You could make one out of an oversize knitting needle, but the store bough one comes with a supply of ""O"" rinds and a screw to hold them on the tool."
