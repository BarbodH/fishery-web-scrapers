296989,Big Cliff,2009-01-25 09:29:00,6899,SCAM!
297004,Governator,2009-01-25 12:55:00,879,I'm pretty sure the real paypal would at least put copyright 2009 at the bottom lol...
297006,solopaddler,2009-01-25 13:06:00,8605,I received the same one yesterday as well.
297020,bullybass,2009-01-25 14:13:00,144,I clicked on all 3 links and the first 2 do indeed go to Paypal and the third one goes to a site ran by Washington Mutual insurance. I don't really think it is a scam. You probably just haven't used your paypal in a long time. But who knows. you will find that real secure websites that require any personal info from you will start with https instead of http... the s stands for secure. I only opened them because I have a mac and am not really worried about viruses. I am not a pro but they don't seem like scam links to me.
297025,John Bacon,2009-01-25 14:30:00,3277,"If you are ever in doubt about an email from Pay Pal, you can forward it to [email protected]  I would say that the one above is some sort of ""phishing email"" to get your account information."
297027,superdad,2009-01-25 14:45:00,353,PHISING  -  PHISING  - PHISHING  Just delete and move on
297038,GoneFishin,2009-01-25 15:37:00,349,"Report it to PayPal and they will deal will it very quickly. i got one of those before and I emailed paypal and they emailed me back not even 10 mins later telling me it was a fraudulent email and that they were taking care of it.  I must say, some people come up with some pretty impressive scams though."
297091,camillj,2009-01-25 17:12:00,1988, When you see emails like this  do NOT .. repeat NOT .. click on any of the links .. in fact just close and delete it immediately .. unfortunately even just moving your mouse around can permit nasty events to occur ... clicking on a link that you are suspicious of could do alot more than download a virus ... you could be 'permitting' a program to execute on your computer that could do literally ANYTHING ....
297096,bullybass,2009-01-25 17:39:00,144,Apparently my bad... but like I said... it did nothing to my computer and actually linked to paypal... except the last one.
297099,Baldy,2009-01-25 17:48:00,44,"What they want you to do is to go to Paypal and log in to your account, then they find out your password through keystrokes and rape your account. Don't know exactly how they do it and don't care (ignorance & apathy at work) but these people should be prosecuted to the full extent, or make them get a real job like the rest of us."
297101,bullybass,2009-01-25 18:00:00,144,Oh... ya.. that would be really bad then. Thanks for the explanation because I really didn't know that they could do that. I hope she emails paypal... I want to see the outcome of this.  Thanks Baldy.
297105,Tinman,2009-01-25 18:03:00,376,"got the same one a few times, kept deleting,"
297117,camillj,2009-01-25 18:24:00,1988," Ok folks listen up - this is serious stuff !!!!  No matter what you THINK you see ... the fact is, the folks that make this stuff are BAD GUYS and they spend alot of energy and they WILL fool you... even if you think you are reallllllly smart....I have been doing this stuff for 30+ years and EVERY SINGLE DAY I see something new.  When you got that email and just by opening it  (not only when you clicked on the link) there is a good chance that a program which logs your keystrokes and later sends them to the originator has been installed without asking or telling you ...in this case, you then get led around to legitimate sites to do legitamate things so that your private information can be stolen ... and even though spy-blockers and virus software do their best to identify, detect and block these actions, they cant always get the job done.  And NO you are not immune on a MAC or on a LINUX box ... its just that fewer bad guys spend their time working on attacks targetted specifically for these platforms ... and its not because they are safer or harder to fool ... its just because fewer of them exist (for now) ... but if you behave 'unsafely' you WILL get burned sooner or later ... in the win-tel world it takes about 5 minutes (or less) after you connect if you are not properly protected ... and even then you will see wierd things happen if you go messing around in the 'grey market' ... especially gambling and porn sites and places where you are offered things for free which you really SHOULD have to pay for ....   OK .. no more preaching ... lets get back to fishin"
297158,tjsa,2009-01-25 20:35:00,1578,"I have received at least 4 of those exact e-mails the last 9 months.  But, I don't have a registered paypal account.  BEWARE.................just delete the message."
297188,OhioFisherman,2009-01-25 21:21:00,6623,"Maureen, used to by and sell a lot of reels on e-bay years ago, that was one reason I stopped. Way to may phishing attempts."
297228,motv8tr,2009-01-25 22:27:00,2587,"I knew it was a scam and reported it as phishing, did a search as well and it has been around for a few years now....  Maureen"
