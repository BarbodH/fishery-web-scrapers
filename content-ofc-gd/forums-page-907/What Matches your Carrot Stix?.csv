They actually sound really awesome, and probably are really good rods for their price. They've even got the new styling cues with rods in the split grips, But then theres one thing I couldnt get over: The Wacky Orange Colour. .    My question is, who knows what reel to put with these rods? Has anyone ever thought about buying these rods only to not know what reel to put onto it?"
297464,danc,2009-01-26 03:32:00,4677,I think a black one would look nice.  Reel Colors
297470,Sinker,2009-01-26 03:46:00,8692,"Oh man, now our rods have to match our reels!!  You guys would laugh at my gear, but I'd still out fish ya's!!!!!!  Sinker"
297472,douG,2009-01-26 03:50:00,2693,"Ya, too.  When I fish, I walrus fish with my home colours.  I could fish with others than red, white, and blue, but then I would be embarrassed to use orange stuff after all that.  Mostley I  use grey."
297478,GBW,2009-01-26 04:14:00,8460,I would be putting a lefty on these but you may be a righty so now your stuck if you are...
297491,EC1,2009-01-26 05:28:00,930,"Haha, Thanks for the input guys. I guess it's REALLY about who has the ability to catch fish and not what colour your gear is.   And when I clicked that link, that even wackier reel might just actually go perfectly with this rod LOL. You can go brag to ALL of your friends that you use clown coloured gear and still catch more than them at the end of the day!"
297499,FishHeadRic,2009-01-26 06:38:00,226,"Here, throw this on there and get an orange spandex jump-suit and you'll be all set     FHR"
297512,GoneFishin,2009-01-26 11:32:00,349,the Daiwa outta luck is one of the only other reels I know that are orange. I wanted to get that rod but didn't like that feel that much when I picked it up in the store.
