297562,ChrisK,2009-01-26 13:56:00,2772,"KelfuN,  Great reel !!! I'm sure you'll do well with it....  I think enough has been said...."
296768,KelfuN,2009-01-24 21:39:00,246,"i was lucky enough to find a crazy colour combo. i wont write much, let the pictures do the talking.      "
296770,Streamerguy,2009-01-24 21:42:00,121,nice .....How much was it?
296814,solopaddler,2009-01-24 23:15:00,8605,"Dude, that's just a bit much LOL!"
296840,kemper,2009-01-25 00:11:00,2232,"Definately not something I would order, but cool!  Wicked reel, seems to be more and more of them popping up.  One day..."
296911,okumasheffield,2009-01-25 03:02:00,318,Why wouldnt you listen to me when I told you it was a knock-off? Now the whole world knows you got scammed!  I will stay A-W-A-Y from you when seeing THAT on the river ... THAT KNOCK-OFF is going to spook even fish with just one eye!
296945,KelfuN,2009-01-25 04:11:00,246,i got this KNOWING no one on the river will have this colour..lol
296956,MJL,2009-01-25 04:43:00,2427, I guess you're not going to say that these pics aren't photoshopped.LOL  Interesting colour choices for sure.  Also has a superman thing going on as well as a combination of Ronald McDonald meets the smurfs.
296961,Sinker,2009-01-25 04:55:00,8692,"I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be caught dead with that thing!  Sinker"
296964,Joeytier,2009-01-25 05:16:00,3990,I love it!  Dare I ask how much it set you back?
296970,young_one,2009-01-25 05:43:00,620,"Now you need a colour matchin pole and fishing suit! Imagine different Lego colours for each section between guides. Good purchase, be sure to report a pic of the reel and some Lego fish."
297013,kentooley,2009-01-25 13:51:00,208,That would look good with a Superman costume.
297032,canadian_copper,2009-01-25 15:16:00,925,definately an eye catcher!!! who cares what it is or what colour or what make!!! as long as it catches fish!!! might have trouble finding a rod to match though   lol
297054,BillM,2009-01-25 16:06:00,17367,"That reel should be nicknamed ""The Harlequin""  Just like the car VW put out in 1996  "
297146,okumasheffield,2009-01-25 20:05:00,318,"Bill-M,  See what you have done! Kelfun starts looking for that car now ... what is next?"
297207,Sinker,2009-01-25 22:05:00,8692, Or a clown suit!!
297367,jdmls,2009-01-26 01:23:00,575,"I really never though that anyone would spend that kind of $$ on that color, when there are so many other slick colors offered... KW produced this color for there opening batch, but has chosen not to produce it any longer, so I guess you can consider it rare  .... Dude , you really have to change that line color, it makes the reel look horrendous , to say the least ..."
297375,danc,2009-01-26 01:29:00,4677,Steelheaders and their reels. Something I'll never understand.  A fashion show on the river banks.
297426,msp,2009-01-26 02:16:00,1336,"Usually the guys on the river that have the most expensive gear and the most tackle, catch the least amount of fish. Its sad but true. I think that they get all geared up at home and practice their poses in the mirror. Ya know..... down on one knee, elbow bent at a 45 degree angle, float reel shinning in the sun.....or my personal favorite, the float reel resting on the back of their neck. We call them float fags."
297431,Sinker,2009-01-26 02:22:00,8692,    Best reply I've read on this site!!!!  Sinker
297521,solopaddler,2009-01-26 11:58:00,8605," Hey hey hey, I resemble that remark!"
297530,lew,2009-01-26 12:31:00,12767, Theres the best response so far
297531,solopaddler,2009-01-26 12:35:00,8605, No one could possibly argue that. It's just when you've got $600 to spend on a reel and you've got a choice on the colour.....
297540,blaque,2009-01-26 13:11:00,2419,"Do i detect a slight tinge of pin bashing, on OFC??? Wow.....this forum doesnt wear it well AT ALL!!!"
297549,KelfuN,2009-01-26 13:36:00,246,"ok so i spent a decent amount of money on this pin, and i chose a colour you guys think thats retarded. it's not like your using the pin, i am..so dont bash. i know i still catch the same amount of fish comparing to my old pin, but its the craftsmenship i paid (im sure people who have played around with a kingpin will know what i mean). are you guys going to bash on the next guy who buys a carrot stick??cause its so orange??   anyways, fishing is an expensive hobby."
297559,lew,2009-01-26 13:50:00,12767,"Well said KelfuN, it was your dollar and your bought what YOU wanted."
