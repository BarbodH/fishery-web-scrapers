297950,PERCHER,2009-01-27 01:52:00,787,"RangerGuy I have that motor on the bow of my 17ft Lund and it rocks.Easy to deploy lots of power and the auto pilot is a trollers dream.Just run your kicker locked in place and set the Terrova to auto pilot and you have hands free steering.Great for setting up lines when you are out fishiing salmon solo.The auto pilot will give you total boat controll for trolling.I used mine at Quinte this fall for walleye in 3ft chop and it never lost its course.It was a big part in catching as many eyes as we did.Ask FISHINDEVIL he was in the boat 5 minutes and it cost him 1,200.00 because he had to have one.

297960,fishindevil,2009-01-27 02:28:00,6254,"Yes percher is right !!!! after seeing that terrova autopilot in action for 3 days,and with rough water & wind,and 3 guys in the boat,that motor kept us on course for over 3 hrs !!! and never even touched the kicker or the electric !!!! and yes i now have one to install in a month or 2 when my lund comes out from her winter sleep....it will CHANGE THE WAY YOU FISH FOR SURE !!!! percher & myself both are big time trollers for eyes & kings,so it will be almost like having a another guy in the boat helping you control the boat ....good choice bud ...cheers"

The Fortrex is the successor to the Maxxum Pro and just came out for 2009.  http://www.wired2fish.com/WhatsUp.aspx?ArticleID=337 http://www.cabelas.com/spodw-1/0061188.shtml  I have the Fortrex 36V 101lb 62"" US2 shaft big momma on my boat and let me tell you the thing looks and feels indestructable.  The problem with the Terrova is that it is not as robust a unit and there is latency with the elctronic steering system vs the direct and instant steering with a cable system.  Just thought I would throw this out there for you or others who are in the market.  Tony"

296542,denisk,2009-01-24 11:26:00,163,"I used one all last season and it's AWESOME.  Pulls the 621 with no issue what so ever and the autopilot is SO MUCH EASIER to keep a track while trolling eyes in rough water.  Consider it the wheel man, your gonna love it"
