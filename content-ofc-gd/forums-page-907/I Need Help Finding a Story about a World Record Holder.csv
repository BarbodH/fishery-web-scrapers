297582,Zib,2009-01-26 14:28:00,369,"Hey guys,  I need some help finding a story about a World Record fish holder that said he had regretted reporting his record catch. The story was out at least a year ago probably longer than that. Someone posted a link to that article on this site in a post about ""What would you do it you caught a world record fish"". I spent a few hours searching for the story but I can't find it.  Thanks for your help."
