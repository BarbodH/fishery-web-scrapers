297653,coreyL,2009-01-26 16:30:00,15,someone told me that they crush up egg shells or use fish scales and dump them down  there hole to attract fish im just wondering if anyone has tried this technique???
297656,Beats,2009-01-26 16:37:00,543,"I""ve heard of egg noodles/pasta dropped down the hole to chum for whitefish, but never egg shells.  Can't imagine they taste too good."
297659,coreyL,2009-01-26 16:44:00,15,its not so much the taste its just there to get the fishes attention then you have ur minnow or bait there jigging......
297676,hotrod,2009-01-26 17:31:00,103,"I used to fish a hut in simcoe where the guy was a cook in a cafeteria so we had all kinds of shells down there. I agree, it's not food it's just an attractant. I don't know if it helped or not but I think anything you can do to give you an edge is helpfull."
297677,johnnyb,2009-01-26 17:32:00,3413,"I heard the same thing, CoreyL....didn't do much for me on Friday while out on Simcoe...might have scared the fish off to the guys that were around me though...they were doing just fine"
297680,xeon,2009-01-26 17:37:00,350,"People do it to light up the bottom of the holes. Its used allot for spearing. Do a search on it here, or you could even try the iceshanty website, they have allot on it."
297681,jwl,2009-01-26 17:40:00,1056,some people do the crushed eggshell trick as a way to cover the bottom with a light colour to make it easier to see down the hole if there are fish swimming under the hole.
297683,tinbanger,2009-01-26 17:42:00,1028,My dad used to use eggshells as well. Don't recall many fish caught though lol.  tb
297700,shane,2009-01-26 18:36:00,652,  We did that when I was a kid in Manitoba.  In the 60's.  The days before fish-finders and underwater cameras.
297710,hammercarp,2009-01-26 19:12:00,964,"I have done it the odd time. The idea is to dribble a few small pieces into the hole every once in a while as a visual attractant. They will flutter on the way down. As to covering a patch on the bottom with them to improve visability , this I think is not a good idea. Fish instinctively avoid light coloured bottoms so that preditors will have less of a chance at spotting them."
297732,OhioFisherman,2009-01-26 19:45:00,6623,"You can probably do the same with a can of cheap fish flavored cat food, plus the fish oils in it may also help to attract them."
297760,fishermccann,2009-01-26 20:42:00,655,"I have put eggshells down my holes on Simcoe for years, seems to work for me!"
297892,BassAsin,2009-01-27 00:17:00,806,i have been using egg shells for years often for speckle trout when looking down the hole when cleaning a few we have found shells in their stomachs.   and when fishin wallies on lake nipissing i use them for the sole purpose of an attractant a bright white area on a sand flat helps me outfish buddies all the time i still have not told them what i'm sliding down the pipe.
297896,wallyboss,2009-01-27 00:24:00,1095,Do the shells slowly flutter down. If so your flasher will be useless until they are all on bottom.  A firend had heard that you could use oatmeal to attract crappies to your hole.  Well he spent about 1/2 hours with his Vex that looked like a XMas tree all lit up.t
