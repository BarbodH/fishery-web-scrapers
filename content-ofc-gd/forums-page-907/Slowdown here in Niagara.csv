So me and my buddy Bill got out for 2 outings.  Fish just sucking on the minnows. No solid bites. There seems to be a big upswing in smelt #'s this year and they do a lot of hook robbing. The good side is they attract pike.     Of course, I can always find these   No fishing over the weekend. Not well enough to get out the past 2 days.  Instead. Some good ole home cooking. A big pot of stew with a couple of fresh baked loaves of bread to soak up all that gravy.   There wasn't enough drippings left for the dogs to lick up after the family had their fill"

297261,Dano,2009-01-25 23:31:00,719,"Nice to get out and like you say, no white stripe! Looks like good eats too."
297265,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-25 23:34:00,2050,Awesome dude!  Can you keep rock bass through the ice? I would assume they're open all year? I bet they'd taste good through the ice! Lol
297319,bigugli,2009-01-26 00:37:00,6138,Open all year here.
297329,Leecher,2009-01-26 00:48:00,7832,Great report and pics Bruce  Sounds like you guys had a blast out there and the table fare sure looks good Thanks for sharing Leechman
297347,jwl,2009-01-26 01:05:00,1056,"you guys been doing so much fishin over there if you drill any more holes you will have that whole area opened up pretty soon  looks like a good pot of stick to your ribs, belly warming food to take the chill off when you got home, it's been freekin cold, was out in the boat with Dan yesterday afternoon for some trout action, stopped off for a couple casts after we got back to the dock and everything was insta-frozen big time.....opted to stay warm today.  I am going to have to get out there with you guys soon, and you are going to have to get out in the boat with me if it ever gets above -10 out"
297369,bigugli,2009-01-26 01:25:00,6138, The temperatures are really hard on the boat and motor right now. Day temps have got to come up 5 degrees.  It's so cold that every new hole will fully freeze out in 2 days.
