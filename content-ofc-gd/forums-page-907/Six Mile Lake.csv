297457,steverowbotham,2009-01-26 03:16:00,1800,"never ice fished it, but fishing it in the open water season can be pretty incredible"
297458,BassAsin,2009-01-26 03:17:00,806,why is that? quite a bit of current in there?
297484,bigugli,2009-01-26 04:43:00,6138,"You have to be really careful on that ice. Current flows make for some skinny ice. Lost a friend up there going through the ice many years back.  As for fish there's walleye, pannies, pike, for icefishing. The days of the lakers are long gone. Last one I know of was caught in the mid 70's by one of my cousins.  On softwater, the lake has weeks worth of water to discover.  I'm a little biased. I grew up in the area, and my uncle's place was on the lake."
297597,buckster,2009-01-26 14:41:00,530,If you know where to go the icefishing can be great!  More of a timming thing too.
297638,ciceri,2009-01-26 15:41:00,535,"okay guys, sounds good. I'll put it on my list for one of the places to fish on the sled.  Go Home Lake McCrae Lake 12 Mile 6 Mile"
