Head down to the door and theres a fella with two potted plants of tulips,and a gift card to boot.He says these are from the Lowes people. Ok, thank you I say,and have a great day. I noticed at the local rink they have thier names on the back of the kids house league shirts too. They are not even open yet,and are doing thier best to be welcome to the city of Barrie and contributing.  Home depot never did this,Rona never did this,walmart never did this either.  I guess I can see where Jimmy gets his class from.  I for one give them, 2   for walking the beat sorta speak an saying TY and yer welcome ."

The result, generally, is a warmer and friendlier store at Lowes. They also want to be one level better than HD.  They believe in keeping their customers satisfied and happy."
297236,danc,2009-01-25 22:37:00,4677,They seem to be doing lots of things right Brian. At least for the past 3 years or so. I hope that they'll open up shop here soon.  
297471,rickster,2009-01-26 03:48:00,495,lowes might be a good store but lets remember that HOME HARDWARE is a GOOD CANADIAN chain
297473,BillM,2009-01-26 03:50:00,17367,"Crap Brian, you sure your house coat wasn't open or something?  I haven't gotten any flowers yet  :)"
297490,bigugli,2009-01-26 04:59:00,6138," Quite right. There are many great stores like Kala's, Minden, Gravenhurst, that carry everything and do all they can for their customers. Unfortunately our local store is a waste of time, so I have to travel to the next town.  Few can carry the  inventory or selection or the price breaks."
