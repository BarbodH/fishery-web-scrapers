297418,Terry,2009-01-26 02:09:00,14456,of course we are still debating if they are legal or not with 2 treble hooks
297420,GoneFishin,2009-01-26 02:11:00,349,I just make mine. They are very easy and quick to make.
297498,rbaquial,2009-01-26 06:15:00,968,"Yeah, I just make my own too now...You can find them @ LeBaron (http://www.lebaron.ca)"
297645,DANIMAL,2009-01-26 16:11:00,215,  I think contacting the MNR would be the only way to get a definite answer.
