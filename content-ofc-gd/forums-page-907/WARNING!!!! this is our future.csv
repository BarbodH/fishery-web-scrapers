297803,jwl,2009-01-26 21:32:00,1056,that's cute man..wait until he gets a little older...my little one now 5..asks when we can go to the trailer all the time...and yes you have to watch out or you will soon find a chunk of your tackle is some how missing when you go to use it..my 3 daughter's are brutal for that  perfect age this coming summer to start getting the little guy into some panfish for a thrill
298029,kemper,2009-01-27 04:29:00,2232,"Awesome!  That was me 17 years ago, and look at me now!  Buried in tackle (much of it adopted from dad) and broke as ever!  I see lots of good times on the water with your little guy, fishin with dad as a youngster make up most of my favourite memories and I still get out with him as much as possible."
