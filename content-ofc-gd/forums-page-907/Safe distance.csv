296913,Fisherman,2009-01-25 03:03:00,7201,"Thickness and condition of ice, weight of vehicle, all factors considered, I like to leave at least 100m.  Speed also plays a critical role, keep it slow to prevent too much of a wave."
296918,Greencoachdog,2009-01-25 03:09:00,8163,If you can hear them fart... you're too close!  ... if you can smell it... you're waaay too close!!!
297102,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-25 18:02:00,835,"Well you got me thinking so I tried to find something on wave theory for ice cover and can't find anything.  a boat on the water has a hull speed depending on the length of the boat , a 24 ' boat rides over its wake at about 7kn and starts to plain but a car on ice has an infinite length and rides on the bending ice so it should never run up on its own wake unless its moving faster than the water can be displaced.  The problem occurs when the wave that you push around you comes in contact with structure or shore or another wave and has nowhere to go and heaves the ice up while you come along and push the ice down.  So on your way out and out in the open your reasonably safe but on your way back to shore is where you get in trouble. If you come to shore one a little ways behind the other the second vehicle could be at greater risk due to  wave bouncing back from shore under the ice from the first vehicle combined with the wave from the second vehicle pushed toward shore.  I don't know if this helps or is just confusing?"
