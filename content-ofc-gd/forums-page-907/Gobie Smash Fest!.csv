297178,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-25 21:09:00,2050,"I've been promising my daughter I'd take her out ice fishing for a while now.  The couple times I have snuck out, I'm usually gone and back again by breakfast - way to cold for a 2 year old at first light.  Mom wasn't feeling well today, so I recruited Grandma and Grandpa to come help keep an eye on her.    It was a cold one, but I wasn't counting on being gone for more than an hour anyways.  The point of this trip was to put her on fish, right off the bat.  Gotta get them hooked on fishing while they're young, thus the target species..the elusive GOBY.  We set up shop in 14 FOW on a sand flat adjacent to some rip-rap.    Good little helper...     It didn't take long before Averie had her first ever fish through the ice, a solid 4"" goby! lol   She was pretty stoked about it to!      After that it was Goby after Goby for 30 minutes until it was to cold for comfort and we had to head home.      Grandpa was having a hard time hooking into those little turbo tappers, I guess Averie and I just have the touch.... So we faked a shot of grandpa fighting one.  And the fight is on....   Busted....   And time to head home...    Best hour of fishing I've had in a while...even if we were just slayin' little gobies.  And man am I ever glad my little girl loves to fish!  Doesn't matter if the next one's a boy or not! lol  Good luck and play safe, UF"

297193,Rich,2009-01-25 21:27:00,3927,Awesome man!!
297203,rbaquial,2009-01-25 21:54:00,968,"I remember a few years back, my buddies and I would catch a lot of gobies (if we couldn't catch anything else). Best part, because of the  zone we're in (and I think this rule applies to all zones) that gobies are NOT TO BE RETURNED TO THE WATER ALIVE. So, we would catch enough to spell the word ""P3TA"".  Here's the picture.... "
297211,Rich,2009-01-25 22:07:00,3927,I hope you put them in a garbage bag after that.. pretty funny though
297215,rbaquial,2009-01-25 22:08:00,968,"LOL... actually, once the picture was taken... swarms of seagulls dove in for them to eat 'em..."

297409,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-26 01:59:00,2050,"Thanks guys - not really much in the way of ""fish porn"" but it's all I've got for ya's! lol  I'm hoping to get her out on long point for an afternoon in a hut so she can stay warm, eat treats and catch some real fish... perch reports have been hit and miss the past week, but I'm thinking we might be able to get out for a day on that family fishing weekend.....I think it's the 14th....here's hoping.  cheers, Ryan"
