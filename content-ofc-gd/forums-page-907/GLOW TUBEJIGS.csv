296955,Eazy,2009-01-25 04:43:00,260,"Hi to all, picked up a few of those glow-in-the-dark tubes, haven't tried them out yet, just wondering if anyone else has?"
296958,Ramble,2009-01-25 04:48:00,713,I want to....does that count?  -R-
296968,Eazy,2009-01-25 05:25:00,260,"Well, I guess that makes two of us! Yeah, seem to do well for lakers with the white ones, thought that glow should even be better. I'll bet the person whoever invented these never intended them to be a Laker bait!"
296997,Greencoachdog,2009-01-25 12:35:00,8163,What size and color are they?... and do you plan to use them during the day?
297042,bassjnkie,2009-01-25 15:41:00,1101,I have the glowing mini tubes. They are great IMO.
297169,EC1,2009-01-25 20:53:00,930,"I have them. As for using them, I bought them and used them only a few times. For me when fishing for crappie, white seems to have outproduced it almost 3 to 1. As a result of that, I have a pack of glowing tubes that have been here since April, and I've gone through about 3 packs of white tubes.  Maybe its just me though. Try it out and see if it works nicely for you."
297463,Eazy,2009-01-26 03:31:00,260," They are 3.5"" long, the usual size I use for lakers, sometimes I'll bump it up to 4"". I'd like to try them during the day as well, probably pretty dark down there even during the day."
