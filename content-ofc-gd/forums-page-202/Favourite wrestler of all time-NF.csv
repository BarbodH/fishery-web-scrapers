Brian was a offensive tackle, to get off the snap count he would watch the foot of the guard beside him. One tough guy. Unless it was a different silent Brian that wrestled."
885742,Moosebunk,2014-12-10 01:29:00,3970,"Tough to pick one...  Jimmy Superfly Snuka, Ricky the Dragon, Rowdy Roddy Piper and Ultimate Warrior were probably the favorites of the bunch.  The British Bulldogs, Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid were the favorite tag team."

885806,Mike Pike,2014-12-10 14:25:00,1332,"Hey, I remember Eric Frolick too.  He was a 'good' guy from the wrestling that was shot out of Vancouver.  I remember him against another good guy and it was what they refered to at the time as a 'scientific match.'   Two guys fighting clean, fast and attempting multiple holds and pins, fighting to a draw and shaking hands at the end of the match.  Never saw too many matches like that one."
885812,superdad,2014-12-10 14:37:00,353,"My early wresting shows were the shows on French TV in Montreal on Wednesday night from the Forum and my favourite was Waldek ""Killer"" Kowalski.  Those were the days of Yvon Robert, Larry Moquin, Gorgeous George, Yukon Eric (Kowalski took off part of his ear one night with a knee Drop) and Don Leo Jonathan.  Then Edouard Carpentier arr'd and it got really good,  I saw Carpentier and Kowalski at Delormier Stadium in Montreal perhaps 1956????  In the WWF, Roddy Piper was a fav with the Macho Man.  Today, the show is all the talk and lots of punching and kicking - on the positive side the jumps and leaps today  are way better than years ago.  David  aka  Superdad"
