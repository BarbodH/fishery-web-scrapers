And last week finished up great with a full moon beat down last night...  It was another cold day and the boat and everything else for that matter was covered in ice from freezing rain...      Water temps at the launch were 30..!!!  In the channel they were a balmy 36... Lol  We started off jigging for some fast small eyes... We got around 15 in about an hour... Once that itch was scratched we headed to different areas for some bigger fish...  We managed a handful of fish rigging big chub minnows... All these fish were 6lb-8lbs...  Then we hit the evening ""minor"" bite window... And a flurry of chaos erupted like nothing I had ever seen...  In the 2 hour bite window we landed 16 more walleye.... So we finished out afternoon with 21 walleye... 14 over 5lbs... Bringing our day to about 35 walleye....!!!!  Now I don't normally tank a big fish for a picture but in below 0 temps and what is normally a small 30-45 minute window... I'll tank a 10 pounder for a picture when the bite stops... And sure enough I cracked a fish that I knew was 10lbs... So in tank her and start trolling again... Little did I know that 5 minutes later we would get another pig even bigger... So we tanked her too... My live well was stuffed with only 2 fish in it... Lol... I've never boated 2 over 10lbs in the same day before... So we now had a chance to do a double pic of 2 walleye over 10lbs...  This day was by far my best day of walleye fishing in my life considering the size as well as the numbers if walleye we were able to boat...  Is was so crazy we were shaking of 6-7-8 pounders boat side to get our lines back in...  So here is the fish porn...  Enjoy...    11.85    Zack double shot 11.85 & 10.2    Me double shot 11.85 & 10.2      Mike"
