Some of the best fishing I've had to date, it's a shame it got destroyed by a hurricane this fall I would love to go back.      also caught a nice marlin have a pic but due to a language barrier it was not released so I would rather not post. The rig this spring.  and a couple of the nicer fish caught this year a pb splake and kitty.   this cat was caught on a five foot ugly stick on six lb test almost spooled me had to chase it down. A couple other nice fish from the year."
