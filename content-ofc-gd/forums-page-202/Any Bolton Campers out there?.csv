Every once in a while I wonder what ever happened to some of the kids as they certainly left a lasting impression. I was a Mohawk in 1970. 9 years later I would be a Programme Director

That would of been 1981.  Taught many of them for the first time how to fish. We caught some real nice brown trout back then.   I thought it would be for me,but turned out not to be. So it was a one year deal that's it."
