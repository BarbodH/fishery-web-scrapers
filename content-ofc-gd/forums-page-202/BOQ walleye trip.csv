Last year I was able to go out with a few buddies and we did quite well and I posted a video for that, last year.  This year after hearing reports of the fishing from my buddy, young_one aka fischen aka Will. Frozenfire and I decided to head out for some of that action. We headed out on November 23rd while Will was there for a tournament that he insisted that we should have joined... We started our day at my place at about 3am and our day ended at about 5pm. I'll let the pictures and video speak for itself. Enjoy.        "

885446,blaque,2014-12-08 13:18:00,2419,Well that looked like fun!!
885448,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-08 13:38:00,8243,Great video guys. It's amazing what you can do with a GoPro. I remember a video you did before and this has equally good production value. And you can fish too. I saw Italo and his crew film a show this past September and they had a shoulder held behemoth of a setup. You guys can do the same for I don't how many thousands less $$$$.  And those goldies are just beauty fat little buggers. If our long Walleye here on Erie had the girth a Quinte Walleye does we are talking world records being broken for sure.
