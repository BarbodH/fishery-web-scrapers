884856,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-05 05:41:00,81,Are they any good to eat?
884857,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-05 05:55:00,8243,"I was told by the former owner of Bear Creek Cottages, I think it was Dick Donovan, years ago if you have ever ordered scallops in North Bay in winter there is a good chance you will get Ling Cod loin, that's pretty good. Yes they are good, caught a few through the ice and kept a few after he told us that. You take each side of the back, loin, and do them just like scallops. Ugly as sin but not as ugly as some things I've put in my lips on over the years. Like Monk fish, got ya."
884878,AKRISONER,2014-12-05 14:02:00,5558,"they call them poor mans lobster.  Ive never eaten them but im not much of a fish eater. I do recall during my time living in Flin Flon during the annual Burbot Derby (ling cod) The absolutely massive free fish fry that was held for everyone to enjoy. My brother to this day says that deep fried Burbot is bloody delicious. So if you are a seafood fan at all, id say go for it."
884886,SirCranksalot,2014-12-05 14:28:00,3291,I tried it last winter and was disappointed. I had caught trout that day so we had t for dinner and stuck the ling in the freezer. We didn't get around to cooking it for a few weeks---I kept bringing home small lakers. When we did it tasted like a dishrag. I don't know if freezing it ruined it. Normally low fat fish keep well in the freezer for a few weeks.
884895,Woodsman,2014-12-05 15:08:00,1286,I find they are quite good when fresh but don't freeze well. They tend to go mushy.
884899,SirCranksalot,2014-12-05 15:14:00,3291,. Ugly as sin but not as ugly as some things I've put in my lips on over the years.  what's the problem here?? You just wanted to eat it---you didn't have to kiss it first!!
884901,kickingfrog,2014-12-05 15:20:00,8333,Yes. Yes! YES!!!
884992,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-05 22:15:00,8243,And they wanted me to open the car door for them too!
884994,Acountdeleted,2014-12-05 22:23:00,2562,"Delish! Boil the meat until it is white, don't put anything on it and dip it in garlic butter. It truly is a poor mans lobster.  I cooked it up with walleye and lake trout and the Burbot was the first thing gone. Go figure."
884995,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-05 22:26:00,10439,The things are incredible beer battered and fried!!!
884997,misfish,2014-12-05 22:42:00,29133,I have had drum done steamed. That was what I knew as poor mans lobster. I want a ling cod to try.
884998,Joeytier,2014-12-05 22:44:00,3990,Fantastic eating fish.  I wouldnt freeze it like you would other white fleshed fish...too oily and soft.  Gotta be fresh!  Can't wait to get out on Nipissing and get a couple!
885006,bigugli,2014-12-05 23:00:00,6138,The bigger ones put up one heckuva fight.
885245,67ZL1,2014-12-07 16:59:00,51,"I've been told by several people that when you order "" Fresh Water Cod "" in the restaurant, you are actually getting Burbot. Maybe someone can confirm this?"
885271,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-07 19:21:00,81,Talked me into it. Next time I'll keep a few. I love fish!
885278,misfish,2014-12-07 20:02:00,29133,Talked me into it. Next time I'll keep a few. I love fish!  Keep one and try it. Why waste the other two if you dont.
885311,EC1,2014-12-07 22:18:00,930, Keep one and try it. Why waste the other two if you dont.  Are they really that easy to catch!?
885335,bigugli,2014-12-07 23:25:00,6138,   That is what a fresh water cod is; Burbot/Ling
885338,manitoubass2,2014-12-07 23:30:00,11391,"where I fish they are super easy to catch. deadsticked minnow on a jig.  fish at night.  ive only caught them on the ice though, and they can piss you right off. they like to barrel roll all around your line. this gets worse when sometimes you cant even feel them take the bait"
885353,chris.brock,2014-12-08 00:10:00,4053,"My lake, they are there but not easy to catch. I put a lot of effort last winter to try and figure them out. I only caught 1 when I least expected, mid day.    I had a tip on a spawning area for the late winter that didn't work out. From talking to the old timers, they used to be abundant and easy to catch. I'm guessing their numbers are cyclical and it's a low cycle now. I do have another tip for a lake up the road where from dusk on, the bite is great.  I did eat that one, fresh, never frozen, as good as walleye and whitefish, deep fried.   edit- oh yeah, 20 years ago my brother thought he had a giant laker, through the ice, at dusk. It was a ling bigger than any ling I've ever seen even in pictures."
