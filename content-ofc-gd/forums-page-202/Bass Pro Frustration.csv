885190,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-07 05:08:00,81,"I like bass pro. If I'm at the store. Online is a different story. I want to buy a hut in Vaughan, but good luck trying to find out which ones they actually carry in store. I would like to research the options before I hand over $500. I guess I have to make the trip from Kitchener. (boo hoo)"
885210,woodenboater,2014-12-07 14:23:00,2277,Their Canadian online presence needs a lot of work. Maybe start with Cdn pricing on items otherwise Cabelas wins this showdown.
885215,misfish,2014-12-07 14:49:00,29133,"If your going to make the drive,make a stop at Sail. Might save you some gas."
885223,Acountdeleted,2014-12-07 15:13:00,2562,"It's also hard to tell what items they have on sale. I noticed they had browning medallions on sale online and when I went to go buy one, the guy mentioned that it was only the U.S."
885225,Burtess,2014-12-07 15:29:00,901,Like Brian said go by Sail first.... you have one in Cambridge now and they have a variety there.  Which ones are you looking at?  Oh and if you can wait till later in the week I will be in that area and will make you a list of what BPS has on the floor and the pricing.  Burt
885229,mattaw,2014-12-07 16:00:00,162,"I thought you could ship whatever you wanted to the store for free? Wouldn't that solve getting something that they didn't have in stock. But as others said, there are lots of other options out there."
885238,Beanstir,2014-12-07 16:34:00,11,"I just received my last order from Bass Pro. I was trying to take advantage of the ""free"" shipping. My order total was $68.75 US. With ""duty"", ""PST"", and dollar exchange, total came to $104.25 CDN. The end cost of getting you order to your door in Canadian dollars with free shipping you can add 51% to the online price of an item."
885239,woodenboater,2014-12-07 16:38:00,2277,"Some items can't be shipped. For instance, was looking at the Base Camp Aqua Cube which was on sale (I think) and had free shipping but ONLY in the states. It wasn't a stocked item in Canada but they still wouldn't ship which is why I shop less and less at BPS and more at Cabelas and Sail.  Sail's floor display of tents and bug shelters blows away all other stores imo. other stuff, not so much"
885269,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-07 18:57:00,81,"Hello, Burt. Wow, I would really appreciate that. I was at Sail opening day. They have no thermal huts(I'm looking at 1-2 man thermal flip).  The 3 I saw online are not available at Vaughan(why would you need them in Canada,eh?) Also Bass Pro doesn't ship store to store to Canada. I found out on BP online chat. Thanks."
885379,Burtess,2014-12-08 02:07:00,901,I will check them out this week and take some pics for you.  Burt
885381,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-08 02:15:00,81,Thanks. Early Christmas present!
885503,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-08 21:51:00,81,"BURT! Hello. Store manager BP says they have 0 one man thermals. I gave up there. Found Frabill  Commando on Amazon $503 - FREE SHIPPING!! I hope you get this post. Thanks for your generous offer and Merry Christmas.      P.S. It's the thermal one, only 4 left!!"
885508,Burtess,2014-12-08 22:18:00,901,Roger that!   Glad you found one!  Burt
