885827,Sandbag,2014-12-10 16:01:00,533,"Just Read is St. Catharines Paper.......Unbelieveable  U.S. authorities are hunting for two men after a charter boat was hijacked at knifepoint from Queenston and the captain forced to take them across the border. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, an 18-foot charter vessel picked up two people at a Queenston marina shortly before noon Tuesday for a paid fishing charter. While on the water, the two people pulled knives on the captain and ordered him to take them to shore in the U.S. The boat dropped the men off on shore near Fort Niagara where they fled by foot. The captain then went to the U.S. Coast Guard station to report he had been hijacked. He told officials both men, who are believed to be Canadian with French accents, had phones and began making calls as they ran from the shore. The investigation continues by the Coast Guard, the Niagara County Sheriff's Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security and New York State Park Police. Niagara Regional Police is also assisting in the investigation.  Cheers  Craig"

885849,BillM,2014-12-10 18:15:00,17367,"At least he didn't do something stupid like try and be a super hero.  Drop them off, and get outta there.  Let customs deal with them."
885862,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-10 19:12:00,8243,This could be a serious threat to US security. There are some certifiably insane young people out there unfortunately.
885863,BillM,2014-12-10 19:21:00,17367,"This could be a serious threat to US security. There are some certifiably insane young people out there unfortunately.  Insane people come in all ages   Customs was notified, he's done with it."
885866,Dara,2014-12-10 19:50:00,3052,Hope they paid cash at the start of the charter!    I was hoping by credit card

885869,blaque,2014-12-10 20:22:00,2419,"This could be a serious threat to US security. There are some certifiably insane young people out there unfortunately.  hundreds of certifiably insane people probably go back and forth thru the booths on a daily basis, these guys just chose to do it freezing their tuckass off"
885882,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-10 21:52:00,8243,"OK, OK. I give. 59 is young to me now."
885905,Fisherman,2014-12-11 00:17:00,7201,"If they paid in cash, hope it wasn't with fake $50 greenbacks.  Seems like there's quite a number of them floating around.  Then CTV showed pictures of the ""alledged"" suspects, I won't say no more.."
