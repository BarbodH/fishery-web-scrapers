885739,Handlebarz,2014-12-10 01:22:00,3790,We love the CFL here in my house but I do enjoy the NFL I was a big fan of GreenBay when I first started watching NFL in the early 90's but now I seem to like different players and don't have just one team.
885746,manitoubass2,2014-12-10 01:45:00,11391,"thats just silly. its always been apart of the game.  thats like removing fighting from hockey lol  so if an rb is running up the sidelines, or heck even the middle, opposing player chasing about to tackle, the team mate of said rb has to pat opposing player on shoulder and say look at me im about to block you?  ffs"
885778,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-10 06:09:00,8243,"I agree with you 100% I would go as far as calling some of the new rules stupid if that's what your saying. I am sort of arguing against myself but I can do that and see your point too. When is anyone on a field defenceless? I just watched the series "" State of Play"" another great sports program by renowned director Peter Burg. It focused on helemet to helmet hits. Check it out HBO. One linebacker interviewed said if the suits that have never put on a helmet will have them playing flag football soon. I was surprised to see the NFL VP responsible for fining players is former Pro Bowler Merton Hanks of the 49 ers. He has a huge crew of people with dozens of monitors reviewing each and every play from every game looking for "" helmet to helmet"" infractions. Penalty or no penalty. Then Merton Hanks is presented with video of what they think may be an ""illegal hit"". First fine $22,000.00 minimum, second 44K minimum. Then suspension and if habitual behavior Hanks said, a possible lifetime ban from the NFL!!!!  Several players have adjusted and they site Troy Polumalu as their poster boy that no longer leads with the crown of the helmet as someone that has changed the way he plays.  Helmet to helmet is bad and I agree it shouldn't happen but I see many hits to the shoulder and the guys helmet slide up to the other guys head, that's a non infraction that's often called. But unessecary blocking, come on man. When will it end? I bet There may be a day you can only tackle from the waist down like Rugby. I hope I'm not here to see that.  Big brother is watching."
885287,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-07 21:03:00,8243,"I see much about hockey here but nothing about football. This afternoon I'm getting 3 good 1PM games here on Bell, sometimes 4 some Sundays which is great. The Steelers game was close going into the 4th until Big Ben put up 16 or so unanswered points against a good Bengals team. One a beautiful 94yard pass and run, that don't happen everyday.  The question is, is it just me or does Rothlisburger look like he ate another small farm animal this week? His head is a big as a Brama Bulls now and he has more chins than a Chinese phone book. Man that guy is getting huge, that what makes his quickness and tight mobility even more amazing.  Good night Irene Cinnci, he just put 6 more up on the board. Cinnci giving up an averge of 79 yards on the ground and Lavion Bell blew them up for 235 combined rushing and recieving, so far. 5 minutes to go. 42-21 Pittsburg, 1/2 hour ago they were down by 3.  Puts the Steelers back into the Wildcard race.  The Winternet is getting a workout here on OFC today."
885294,davey buoy,2014-12-07 21:19:00,5505,"I follow the Bills JD .that's all,my hockey takes up most of the time.As it gets a bit closer to the playoffs,I'll be watching more!!!"
885398,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-08 03:56:00,8243,"1 guy, I'm surprised actually. I've been following the Bills since they were in the AFL. Mom is from North Tonawanda so I didn't have much choice. Had season tickets for a few years in the 90's. After those Super Bowls I can't really say fan. I've never been a fan of any team really, not in the sense of the word. Saw my first live Bills game OJ's rookie year, he wore #36 that night for his first exhibition game.There's a trivia question that will never come up.  The first day of school Mr. Ballard asked the class what they did over the summer, did I have a story for them, kind of trumped the I went to the cottage or Camp Whatchawanta stories."
885409,manitoubass2,2014-12-08 05:53:00,11391,im a big fan. green bay/denver are my teams but im just a fan overall and ill watch pretty much any game thats on
885413,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-08 06:09:00,8243,"I always wondered why we pick the teams we do to be fans of? I was a fan of Dallas because Bob Hayes was a receiver then and he was once the fastest man in the world. The Bears and Dick Butkas the greatest middle linebacker ever to play the position and Gale Sayers probably the greatest running back to ever play the position. Our HS school team was the Bears and I played inside linebacker and running back. At the same time a Browns fan because our coach loved the Browns and our uniforms were exactly that of the Browns uniforms including the pumpkin head helmets. Stayed with the Bears for years because of the great defencive teams and the other greatest running back to ever play the late great Walter Sweetness Payton. Man there's many greatest to ever play at the same position for me, lets call it a tie. Regardless of him being a monster you can argue that OJ was as well. 3 way tie. Lets not forget Barry Sanders too. And if I don't mention Jim Brown I should be hung. Did I miss anyone."
885415,manitoubass2,2014-12-08 06:18:00,11391,"barry sanders is my favorite player of all time.  Ive actually followed many teams over the years, for me at least, its different then a hockey team  walter payton and perry made me fans of the bears waaay back.  i loved the 49'ers because of Montana  my fav qb of old is dan marino. man i wanted him to win a ring, soooo bad"
885419,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-08 06:44:00,8243,"Manitou I once went into the stadium early to watch the first round of warm ups. I was 20 feet from Marino. He was throwing passes 20 yards on a rope. It sounded like a golf ball going by, zawhoosh. I have never heard that sound from a football before or since. I've heard a similar sound but not like that. He had the strongest arm I have ever seen, or heard. Footballs are not supposed to make a sound like that. No way. The only cooler guy under pressure had to be Montana. Marino got better in the last 5 minutes than the first 55. He was part of the Elway, Kelly and Marino class of 83', and in total there are currently 7 Hall of Famers from that single draft. One of the teams started the rumor that Marino had a drug problem at Pitt.to drop his worth so they could get him lower in the pool, Miami? No will say even today. That's why Marino went to Miami that wasn't looking for a QB but took him anyway, so goes the story. Elway refused to play for the Colts that had the #1 pick. He said he would play for the Yankees that had picked him in their draft. Steinbrener said he was the second coming of Mickey Mantle. I think he wouldn't play for Frank Kush who was known as a taskmaster and fitness freak. Marino wasn't known for time he spent in the weight room, none actually. Kush coached the Tiger Cats for a few years. Want a story about Kush, PM me, I can't tell it here. There are many documentaries and books written about a freaking NFL draft from 83'."
885424,manitoubass2,2014-12-08 07:41:00,11391,"haha awesome! another NFL freak. Ill pm ya for sure.  as a kid, I was introduced early though cards. I collected around age 6. my much older cousins collected as well. Their dad collected as well and was unfortunately killed in a accident where he was hit by a drunk driver.  by this time my cousins were mid twenties and passed the collection to me. and it was the best gift ever.  as a child i memorized every stat, every player. i wish i could still recall all that info.  I was like 10 and was super proud to have Fran Tarkenton rookie cards, nobody else knew who he was lol. if i remember right he debuted around 61-62?  was born in virginia but in international falls(where i was born) he was a hometown hero"
885429,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-08 08:33:00,8243,"Fran Tarkenton, I watched him play. He is a good friend of the man that owns Carmen's banquet center in Hamilton and has told us a few stories about them golfing together at Augusta where Mr. Tarkenton is a member. I have been forced to watch AFL and NFL ball since I was 4, so after 56 years I should remember some stuff. I played from 8 to 26. For a few years I never watched a entire game now I will spend Sundays watching all day. I've never seen faster and stronger kids as this last few seasons. When ever I see a helmet rolling along the field I look to see if there is a head in it. Pet peeve, those long corn roll braids the kids are wearing today. I loved it last week when someone tackled the receiver by the hair, totally legal the ref told him. H I wonder when the NFL will make a rule for that, there's a rule for everything else. He actually got an earful from the head coach. 20 years ago the coach told you to get a hair cut you did, not now, probably in his contract.  Every time I hear about someone losing a loved one because of drunk driving I want to give it to a drunk driver. I know quite a few people out here that drive drunk. One called the police on me for assaulting him when I tried to take his keys away, They arrested the idiot but the charges never stuck even though he admitted it.  I'm sorry to hear about your Uncle, I know how it feels, such a waste."
885447,Gregoire,2014-12-08 13:23:00,1397,"I'm a huge football fan. Liked the Cowboys when I was younger, my grandmother passed that on to me, she loved Tom Landry's hats. I had a few buddies who played in the league, so cheered for the Seahawks for a while, and spent a half season cheering for the Bengals. If I had to pick a team it would be the Bills, only because they are the closest to home. I watch the sport because I love it. I play in a few fantasy football leagues, so most of the time I am cheering for individual players to do well."

Needless to say I was a huge Marino fan,I have several jerseys for myself and my two sons.I even spent my honeymoon at Joe Robbie Stadium watching Marino torch Jim Everett and the Rams in Miami's first game at home after Hurricane Andrew in 92. Just last weekend while in Cleveland I ate at Shulas2  ,Don's restaurant in our hotel. I sure do miss the Marino days seems we have been looking for a replacement ever since with not much luck,although Tannehill looks to maturing nicely but he is no Marino,  My wife is also a huge NFL fan,too bad though she has to be a 9er fan,I have been forced a couple times to go watch them in Detroit back when Young and Rice were there and have been forced to hear about the many superbowl titles.   Thank-you Baltimore 2 seasons ago,that was sweet/"

On your other question who should be added as a great running back....Thurman Thomas and Emmitt Smith. Great backs granted but regardless of Smiths record he can't be ranked as one of a hand full of greatest. He couldn't block worth a lick as far as I'm concerned. Thomas can be ranked up there as one of the best as well and it can be argued one of the greatest all around backs to ever play. No one picked up the blitz any better as he did. I also loved Jerry Rice.  randall cunningham was a big favorite of mine as well. now that not going back too far but man o man did that dude have talent.  Wide receivers don't count as football players. ( just kidding) it's really any position where he doesn't need to shower afterwards, kickers maybe? No kickers for sure don't play football they are on a football team. But with Rice I can make an exception. He did it all. Looked like he was jogging and was doing a sub 4.5 40. Plus he went across the middle whenever asked as well as Andre Reid did his entire career. Rice didn't need to pull the antics wideouts do now, he acted like he belonged in the end zone and like a gentleman, not many gentlemen receivers out there today but I have to say it has calmed down the last few years since a few idiots retired.  Some players were sure fun to watch but won't go down in history as great. Cunningham was fun to watch for sure he was, he did things at the position that no one had ever done before and for some of the amazing athletic plays he made have ever done since.  Does anyone remember a linebacker named Tim Roscovich? I watched him when he was on the field when Philly was in Buffalo one Sunday. Drank motor oil so he could run smooth. Went out on the field for a coin toss once in College, after the hand shakes he opened his mouth and a bird flew out. There should be a Hall of Nuts."
885550,manitoubass2,2014-12-09 01:44:00,11391,"Jerry Rice was in a league of his own. Like you basically said. an athletic machine full of talent and class. thats why I like him so much. the position became a joke in the late 90's early 2000's when athletic guys got huge contracts to catch 3 balls per game and do nothing else  to me Cunningham was like the Barry Sanders of QBs lol. guy was sure athletic and entertaining.  the NFl is still very entertaining but boy has it changed  not only is the behaviour sickening but the rules have gone into the composed bin  I like the quiet guys that still handle themselves as well as they play. Wes Welker would be one  and any player that cant throw a block is meh, minus a few positions of course."
885551,manitoubass2,2014-12-09 01:47:00,11391,"the best play in football is a rb or receiver running the line full tilt. opposing player has him lined up, ready for the kill. then bam!!! huge block outta the backfield!!!  i love it everytime"
885557,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-09 02:10:00,8243,"Mister G, it was the 30-30 program I saw last month that I remembered the info I typed.. A great show as well as E-60.  Manitou, It can be a sucker shot when a wideout slams a safety coming across pursuing the ball carrier. Receivers must be careful when they decide to do that. Those  DB's have more opportunities for payback, and they get  do just that. When a receiver decides to take a shot like that they had better have their head on a swivel the rest of the game. It can be done more often but isn't, think about it. You will see a receiver blow up a DB more in the CFL because they play more zone and have a bigger field to line a guy up. It's a bit tougher for the DB;s to payback here because here the receiver's have more control of the pattern with all that motion.  You will never see receivers go for a beer with the DB's or be invited to any defensive guys BBQ;s, ever. Lucky if they are speaking by seasons end."
