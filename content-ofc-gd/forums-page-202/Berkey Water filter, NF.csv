881273,SirCranksalot,2014-11-17 19:22:00,3291,"We have a fairly new drilled well that's over  100 ft deep but we are getting results back that say ""sample overgrown with bacteria commonlt found in the environment"" with the latest sample saying we have 10 parts of coliform. No e-coli. I am trying to figure out where this may be coming from. I thought that joints in the well casing were supposed to be watertight. With it being so new I wouldn't expect it to have developed holes already.  We have a water softener system and I'm wondering if the bacteria is entering thru the salt bin. Since salt is used to preserve food assumed that it killed bacteria, but maybe not coliform??  Any ideas??  thx"
881276,irishfield,2014-11-17 19:25:00,26272,You are supposed to take your sample.. PRE softeners or filters for sampling.  Did you clean the testing taps spout with chlorine first... then run.. then get your sample?... and never set the test bottle lid down!
881317,Sinker,2014-11-17 22:21:00,8692,"Yeah, sanitize your tap, sample raw, untreated water, and dont touch or set the bottle cap down. Its easy to mess up a water sample. Try it again.  S."
881368,SirCranksalot,2014-11-18 01:10:00,3291,"Thx, gents. I will wipe the tap with bleach and make sure I don't putt the cap down the next time around. I could do the next test with the softener bypassed to try to determine if the softener is the problem. But it's the water that has passed thru the softener that we want to drink and if coliform is somehow coming in via the softener then I need to fix that problem. So I think the subsequent test should be done with water that has passed thru the softener. Is that what you were suggesting? thx"
881382,irishfield,2014-11-18 02:02:00,26272,Do you have a basement tap somewhere before the softner? I have one right on the pressure tank. So you could take a sample there.. and another after the softner and see what you get back after clearly marking which is which.

No, but I have a bypass on the softener so I could do that, flush it thru the kitchen sink and take the sample from the kitchen. I'll do that in the next few days then, depending on the results, check again downstream of the softener. I'll post what I find out.  Thx for your help gents!"
881480,aplumma,2014-11-18 20:19:00,6896,By pass valves can leak thru even in the off position. The correct way is to hook up a hose to the valve on the well tank and flush it for 5 minutes. Then disconnect hose and wipe down with alcohol and draw sample. If the sample comes back with out any bacteria you can at that time shock the well with chlorine and let that run thru the softener and it will sanitize it.   Art

The advantage of replacement is the newer unit use less salt as well as the advancements in the resin beads will well be worth it. On a separate note a poorly working water softener is not a health risk so you are not risking much. I could use the old scare tactic of how it makes soap work better and you are killing your appliances but life is to short to worry about those things. if however you have any type of sanitizing system U.V., chlorine, ozone or carbon keep it well maintained your health depends on it.

884882,SirCranksalot,2014-12-05 14:16:00,3291,"I've now had 2 tests done about 10 days or so apart. The results look pretty good but a bit inconclusive as to the source of contam. I did the first, as you folks suggested, before the softener,using bleach to clean the tap and making sure I didn't set the cap down. The  result was 0 coliform. I then tested from the kitchen tap, again using the same precautions. The result was 2 coliform. It's recommended that I get 3 consecutive good results before drinking----2 coli is considered good. I'm not sure how accurate the measurements are. If the margin of error is 2 coli, then maybe my first sample had 1 or 2.  I thought coli originated in feces---human or animal. If so, I'm puzzled how it would get into the softener.  Again, thx for all your help.  SCL(aka Knuguy)"
884891,irishfield,2014-12-05 14:56:00,26272,Total Coliform... or E Coli... two different things! The first at 2 is acceptable... the 2nd one is not!

Most wells have a low number part/million that is no real issue, but are you above what is safe to drink to start with? If so time to figure out why, especially if some javex down the well won't cure the problem."

878726,aplumma,2014-10-30 00:02:00,6896,Chris the presents of E coli in the well is a sign that ground water contamination is present. It can be from the soil if it is old pasture land or if the rock stratus is very porous.(very likely in Canada) The correct way to treat is either a chemical oxidizer (clorine) followed with a carbon filter or if the water is clear the use of a UV set up is your best friend. Both methods are used to explode the bacteria and it becomes inert and passes thru you with no ill effects. There is not a know filtration method for e coli. that has been approved.   Art
878727,irishfield,2014-10-30 00:03:00,26272,"The only thing that's going to eliminate would be a UV light... and then a fine ceramic filter to get the dead ""bugs""."
878729,Terry,2014-10-30 00:14:00,14456,I thought you are obligated to track down the source of E coli contamination after walkerton  I would also shock the well with lots of chlorine get the 25% stuff not the household 5% stuff UV is great but you need low turbidity for them to work right
878730,irishfield,2014-10-30 00:25:00,26272,Exactly Terry.. why I asked why his well has a high ppm count to start with. We take lake water in Temagami.. coarse filter... FOUR foot UV light and a ceramic filter and have ZERO total coliform count. My 185 ft drilled well here at home as a constant 2 or 3 ppm count. The odd bug is good for you!
878731,chris.brock,2014-10-30 00:46:00,4053,"Thanks guys,  Like Art said, there is no known approved filtration for E Coli It's a scam, garbage product, I bit, hook, line, and sinker  My last question is, do you think Scott will be OK with me shoving my Berkey up his back end?"
878733,Sinker,2014-10-30 00:52:00,8692,"I've never heard of berkey before. Do you have any other information about it?  E coli in your well is not good. You should consider finding the source, or other treatment, or decommissioning the well.  There are a lot of good treatment processes other than ""bleach"" as you put it. Is this a dug well, or drilled?  I hope you didn't pay to much for the berkey....what a bum.  S."

878736,Sinker,2014-10-30 00:56:00,8692,"There are filtration methods that are not ""approved"" that work. I operate a drinking water system that has one. I have to also use secondary treatment with chlorine, but every monthly sample raw from our filters have come back clean. Getting the approval is the hard part. They're not cheap, or approved, but they do work. However,  I don't know the regulations on a residential system well enough to say whether you could use this filter there or not.  S."

878765,bigbuck,2014-10-30 14:45:00,2449,"5 micron filter, tannin filter if needed, UV light to kill bacteria and a carbon filter to scrub the water. As Gerrit said, do not screw around with your drinking water. We run the above at the lake along with a 30 micron filter because we draw from the lake. Test before and after using the above setup to see the difference. You will be amazed. It is not cheap to get a proper setup but the results are worth it."
878774,Terry,2014-10-30 15:52:00,14456,Depending on the size of the particulate in your water which or how many filters should be used. And I still like chlorine as secondary disinfection
878820,aplumma,2014-10-30 22:15:00,6896,A UV system has a few safeguards that can be installed easily for piece of mind. They have an audible alarm that can also be hooked into a solenoid that will shut off the water flow  if the UV drops below a safe level. There is a downside to a chlorine injection system if installed correctly it should have a contact tank rated at 10 x your pumps rating so your average 5 GPM pump needs a 50 gallon tank for the sterilazation process to take place correctly. A carbon filter as your final filter will then absorb the chlorine/ taste and odor from the water but has no sterilization properties. Still to this date Silver bearing nitrates in any form does not kill bacteria and all of the filters that claim this are Bull and will have a legal disclaimer absolving them of this criminal claim. The only filtration that has a small chance to remove e coli is a reverse osmosis filter however they are slow to filter and will eventually grow enough bacteria to fail and pass the bacteria to the consumer.   Art
878827,mitch seguin,2014-10-30 22:43:00,98,Just to clarify E. coli and total coliform readings for safe drinking water should be 0 colonies per 100 ml of water.
878829,irishfield,2014-10-30 22:56:00,26272,"Health Canada.... ""The presence of total coliform bacteria in well water is a result of surface water infiltration or seepage from a septic system. According to Health Canada'sGuidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (Sixth Edition, 1996), drinking water should not contain more than 10 total coliform bacteria per 100 mL of water. Any water containing more than this amount should be resampled. If the repeat sample contains more than 10 total coliform bacteria per 100 mL, corrective action should be taken immediately."" Under 10 TOTAL coliform is considered safe to drink... 2 or 3 is a normal well.... not to be confused with actual E coli reading that should yes be zero."
878830,irishfield,2014-10-30 23:10:00,26272,Which makes me think and ask Chris... are you getting a TOTAL coliform reading from the health unit or an actual E coli reading?
878835,Sinker,2014-10-31 00:09:00,8692,"health unit tests for both.  If there is  E coli in your well, you really should do something about it. Either upgrade your system, or fill the well in. All it takes is one person to get really sick (or die) and you'll be wishing you had done it. Its not something to mess around with.  S."
878837,chris.brock,2014-10-31 00:15:00,4053,"I don't know, there' s an E coli number and a Coliform number on the test results, so I assume it's not just total Coliform  Our lot is in a sharp valley with lots of run- off from the hills above  During the spring snow melt, the water actually flows out of the top of the well, it is 1' above grade  We don't drink the water now, obviously, I did get mildly sick for close to a month and needed antibiotics, but who knows, virus, water?
