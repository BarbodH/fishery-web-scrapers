885109,misfish,2014-12-06 19:22:00,29133,"I was always under the impression, that the Dec control hunt was buck only.  I have looked and see nothing that it has changed.  Has it changed? Did I miss it?  Thanks for your time."
885111,porkpie,2014-12-06 19:43:00,2521,Your controlled hunt tag will tell you what you can harvest depending on the WMU.  Where we hunt it is either sex.
885118,Fisherman,2014-12-06 20:33:00,7201,What Porkpie said.
885119,misfish,2014-12-06 20:49:00,29133,"Ok thanks.  I still cant see where there is a draw for both sex, for the December hunt."
885122,BillM,2014-12-06 21:21:00,17367,Which WMU Brian?
885123,misfish,2014-12-06 21:27:00,29133,76c
885127,BillM,2014-12-06 21:51:00,17367,"From what I can gather, you apply and if you get approved, the tag itself will state what you can hunt."
885130,misfish,2014-12-06 22:09:00,29133,"From what I can gather, you apply and if you get approved, the tag itself will state what you can hunt.  Not what Im looking for Bill. Ya I know the draw thing for the first week.  Like I have stated,the November hunt was buck only, as far as can remember.  I cannot find any where, where there is a draw for either sex. I can not find where it says buck only as well.  Why do they change so many things and make it hard to find?"
885134,BillM,2014-12-06 22:31:00,17367,Is this what you're looking for?  Page 70  https://dr6j45jk9xcmk.cloudfront.net/documents/3311/2014-ontario-hunting-regulations.pdf  asterisk * indicates you can only shoot antlered deer.  They sure don't make this stuff easy to read!    Then there's the bow section where I think you can shoot a doe in 76c.  *confused*
885191,richyb,2014-12-07 05:12:00,774,I had a doe tag for the dec hunt. in 76A..
885197,misfish,2014-12-07 11:09:00,29133,Thanks Bill. Ya nothing reads easy.   Thanks Richy.    Thats why I asked before passing judgment.
885198,dave524,2014-12-07 11:49:00,4508,"I dont ever recall any separate draw for a doe tag during a controlled hunt.  You apply for either week of the controlled hunt and a tag will come saying you are good for just bucks or both sexes, actually it says anterlered or antlerless. Any separate draw for those WMU that have a controlled hunt for a doe tag were for archery hunters only."
885203,Fish Farmer,2014-12-07 13:21:00,2234,"Brian, you had to apply before June 30 for the antlerless deer draw, there they indicated if you were going to hunt the first or second hunt."
885214,misfish,2014-12-07 14:47:00,29133,"I know all that stuff guys.  My question was,  Is the December control hunt, BUCK ONLY.  I got my answer thanks."
