885149,John Bacon,2014-12-06 23:50:00,3277,I am not convinced on these points.  It is interesting that Purple Loosestrife is used as an example when beetles have been released to control its population.  It may have been far more damaging without the biological controls.  https://ca.news.yahoo.com/battling-invasive-species-mistake-ecologist-100000274.html

They were introduced by man simply because we have never been good at looking at the long term effects, and consequences, of our actions."

However, It would be a huge economic loss if we gave up on rehabilitating tourist attractions like quinte and lake O in general, or erie etc. all together because they aren't pristine like some northern lakes. Those need to be protected undoubtedly, and before they get abused by the general public.  I think the best way to protect the northern resource(s) would be to make a sustainable one here, cleaner lakes for swimming, stocking programs for fishing and informative educations programs and tours."

885290,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-07 21:07:00,956,"In Australia years back they introduced the cane toad so it can protect the farmers crops from insects.  Not only did the toad do nothing, but anything that ate it (snakes, lizards, dingos) they got poisoned and died.  Australia is so rich in wildlife, but one day I promise it will all be gone."
