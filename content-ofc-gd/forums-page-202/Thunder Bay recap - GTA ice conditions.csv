Kakabeka Falls is crusted over completely.   The Kam river is completely frozen over. McIntyre River in town is covered. The pond at Lakehead university is a skating rink now. The Current river/Boulevard Lake is covered. The outflow from the Current river at Lake Superior has a section that is open. Black Bay has 10""+ as reported by Hamilton Baits (with huts in place).  Lake Superior is starting to ice: Looking at the Sleeping Giant  I did not get a chance to go fishing and did not see any fishermen this trip.  As we were flying home, over some waters I noticed: Scugog is frozen over. Lake simcoe is completely covered in ice/drifting snow. Little Lake, Bass Lake, Mud Lake, Balsam are all frozen. Lake Ontario is still open everywhere I could see.  I was hoping to get a head start to the Hardwater season, but I will just settle for a little sightseeing. It won't be long now down here in the GTA.  Thanks to all the members for all the advice about TBay.  Sleepjigging"

885442,Sandbag,2014-12-08 12:28:00,533,Lake Simcoe is WIDE open  no ice.....  I would hate to see anybody travelling get their hopes up.  Give it three more weeks and we may be getting started.  Cheers  Craig
885443,c10,2014-12-08 12:47:00,131,"Okay I thought so!  I certainly didn't have any plans on getting out there before the new year, but i suppose hearing of lakes up north being frozen since November and some of the recent reports about the Kawartha's got me too antsy ahaha Thanks Craig!"
