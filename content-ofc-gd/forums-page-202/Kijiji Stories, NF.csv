885399,bow slayer,2014-12-08 04:26:00,1074,"I have had good success selling and buying on kijiji,I have also had lots of no shows,low ballers.  One tip I could suggest is when placing an ad and when giving your location never post your address or postal code,especially if you are selling items typically stored outside such as boats,canoes,kayaks,etc.. my buddy posted his nova craft kevlar canoe for sale on kijiji which he stored in his backyard,second day after posted with postal code it walked off. Lesson learned. Now he just post the city where he is located."

Had a life handed to him and his father (Wayne) tried to keep feeding him funds.... even though his father (Dellen's grandfather) had worked extremely hard to build an empire, Wayne seemingly ran it into the ground. Sad when your own kid kills you for insurance money and uses the family hangar to store / strip / export stolen goods. There's much more to the story unfortunately and it will all come out in time."

I don't worry too much about low-ballers (I have likely done it before to be honest), I don't think there is much harm in asking for a deal as long as you are respectful and polite in doing so.  That being said, if you make a deal for a price don't go back on your word looking for a better deal, after the fact. Just be careful I suppose"

Perhaps my best story was that I was looking to buy winter tires and rims for my protege a few years back. Found a good set at a great price on kijiji so a buddy of mine and I hopped in the car and drove into the middle of the suburbs in Brampton.  We show up, 2 young clean cut guys cash in hand...The guy turned out to be a car enthusiast himself, we loaded up the wheels in the car and then hung out in the guys garage for 3 hours while he brought out the beers. He then proceeded to give my buddy and I a set of brand new mechanic's gloves as well because ""they were the best for working on cars""  Now that was a transaction!"

So far, I have bought; -Marshall bass amp valued at $3200.00 for $1000. -$3,500 bass guitar for $600. I've sold a bass on Kijiji for $400 more than I paid for it brand spanking new! (That sale has funded many other purchases since!) When selling musical instruments, the need to try out everything is quite real. All my transaction have taken place in my living room. That said, I always spend time on the phone with these folks before providing my address. If I get even the slightest inclining that something isn't right, I'm done with them. So far, I have had great luck/success... but would probably have even better luck, if I could talk myself into selling stuff instead of buying all the time! Misinformed sellers are probably the most difficult for me. The article may be worth X amount to the seller, but that doesn't necessarily make the item that value! HH"

Hahaha  Same sled, a few days ago, a guy proposes he takes the sled on credit, no money down, 40% interest, and he'll get a lawyer to write up the required paper work so it's legit. It's a $1k asking price. There was a story about his nephew had his sled stolen and he wanted to replace it as a X Mas present. I scrooged out on this.

When I invited him in he tried to close the door.  It really freaked me out when he did that cause not only do I have one of my favorite characters of all time (Hey you guys lol) in front of me, but I'm only 5 foot 5 so if he wanted to do something I'm not sure what I can do.

Here's what I have found out through my kijiji experience:  The weirder the item you are selling, the weirder the buyer will be. Case in point: sold my second acoustic guitar on kijiji, buyer was a guy looking for a cheap starter acoustic for his kid. Sold a bunch of creepy old porcelain dolls that were my great grandmothers, buyer was an equally as creepy guy who looked like he was trapped in the 1970's!!!!!!

The first one who does that wins !!! But yes I know that people have had horror stories from there just don't ever accept anything other than cadh not checque not pay pal not anything just cash In your hand !!!!! And yes I get the phone calls too about trades and my cousin will pick up your boat and I will deposit the money or send you a checque !!!! I just hang up !!!!!!

The funniest story I have is from selling spice rack for $10. The lady was coming from 20 miles away and wanted a discount since it was so far away. I let her talk me down to $8.00 and a large coffee.  Here's a couple things that I found work great for selling: Make it very clear in the ad that ""OFFERS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED IN PERSON - EMAIL OFFERS WILL BE IGNORED"" Select a reasonable amount of time to be available for viewing and pickup. Serious buyers will work around your schedule. ""AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING AND PICKUP SAT AND SUN BETWEEN 12:00PM AND 3:00PM"" Price your item properly; don't add 20% because you think you'll get lo-balled. Price it fair and stick to your price.  Don't be a desperate seller!! If you post an item with obo (or best offer) you'll invite offers, usually lo-ballers. Then they come to your door (if they show up at all) and change their offer because its bigger/smaller/heavier/lighter than what they had in mind. Yet, they are still wanting this item that doesn't suit their needs at a further reduced price. Post your item with the right price and don't say ""obo"" or ""firm""."

I've heard there is a big paypal scheme with kajiiji but I'm not sure how it work though. Apparently they pay you through paypal, have you ship the item and pull the funds.

It is really sad I can remember the name of the guy that killed the innocent guy selling his truck on Kigigi, but I can't remember the victims name.  If I have anything I don't need I donate it to a worthy cause or if it's a big ticket item sell it through my own network of friends and associates or donate it to someone that deserves it. Like the $500.00 inflatable I gave away on another forum, no way some stranger is coming to my property to scope out my stuff.

885250,porkpie,2014-12-07 17:28:00,2521,"Lots of good luck with kijiji.  If the item is priced right, it will move in less than a week.  Your geographic location can also impact things. I live in no mans land, so often have to wait a little for a buyer to show up.  If you price right, you will still have a few lowballer email offers, but a serious guy will show up with cash and after a bit of back and forth over a couple bucks, your item is gone!  If you live centrally, have posted a good ad, and receive nothing but lowballers and crackpots, your price is off!"

885260,Canuck2fan,2014-12-07 18:35:00,1444,"Kijiji like any tool can be good or bad. I have gotten some decent deals while buying. When selling it is pretty much the same. They call they beg, then they show up days later and want to change the price after making a verbal or email agreement.  As for people coming and having a look then coming back to steal the stuff, that is pretty much a danger anytime you leave your garage door open and go into the house to answer a phone call and come back out 10 minutes later... unfortunately.  It was funny when we were binning the stuff from my parents garage, on the last bin, just as I was leaving for the day. I tossed in 2 kids sleds (wooden with runners) and an old bike with two split almost in half tires. I just got to my place when the phone rang about an item I had listed on Kijiji. This couple had stood me up twice on pick up times, but I agreed to go back to the house to sell them a bar fridge.  I get back to the house, I had been gone maybe 40 minutes, in the middle of the day and the bike and sleds are GONE from the bin.  I was thinking seriously, who ever grabbed them could have come up asked about them when they were sitting beside the house for 2 days, and for helping us for 10 minutes to load the bins I would have given them the sleds, bike, chainsaw, hedge trimmer, winch, car jack, step ladder and thing else they wanted so we didn't have to lug it to the damn bin LOL.  So the couple for the fridge shows up and agrees to take it. Then the price change negotiation starts... I was like okay you have had me come back here 3 times now for this 60.00 item. How about just so you think you won how about 5.00 off. He hums and haws then goes OK.  I help him load it the truck and he goes what is with the bin. I explain we just filled it and I mentioned about someone stealing the bike and sleds. He climbs up on the side of the bin begins rummaging through what he can reach and goes have you got anything else worth taking in there? I sort of glare at him NO, but you should have been here yesterday when we emptied 2 almost full cabinets of mechanic tools in the metal bin. I thought he was going to cry. LOL  Oh and I finally found out what the weight on the ""scrap"" metal bin was 4187 lbs...."
885261,Fisherpete,2014-12-07 18:44:00,1814,A few excellent points raised here...  First - I will never meet someone at my house. You just never know if someone will case you out doing so. I usually use the closest Timmies as a meeting place. I also have found that if you are willing to meet people at a place that is more convenient to them they are more likely to pay full asking price and you will have far less no-shows - eg I live in Whitby but work in the west end of Toronto - I just set up a meeting place on the way home after work and bingo.  Pricing your items fairly is another good piece of advice - and try to be patient. Sometimes it just takes a bit for the right buyer to come along for your item. Do a bit of research and look up what your item is worth compared to similar items for sale.  It's a great tool - keeps the clutter at home down and puts a few bucks in the pocket (to spend on more fishing gear LOL) as are the classifieds here - you just have to take a few common sense precautions.

After an hour or so a lady knocked on the door and asked if it was free and I said yes, that's why the sign says FREE  She said she was interested but didn't like the fact that there was a bit of surface rust on one of the rims.  I just closed the door in her face and went back in the house.  A while later the bike was gone."

If they are coming to the house big ticket items I make sure they see they knock on the door so the dog will go nuts. ( 120 lb bulldog).   I also have cameras on the property they are hard to miss.    My place is on lockdown you can't get into either outbuilding without alarms going off and if I don't answer my cell phone  the cops get dispatched."

Jim next door had a very ornate antique pump organ that had to be 300 pounds easy, solid as a rock, for free with a free sign, it sat for weeks. He put the for sale sign on at it was ""stolen"" shortly afterwards. An organ sitting in the rain can't be good but it would have made a great bar with the roll away top. I seriously considered doing just that but looking at how the thing was put together I would never had gotten it apart to do it. Built like a Sherman tank. I love the Winternet some days."

A picture and video record might go a long way in preventing anyone from coming back unannounced. Might also be a good idea to record the sellers identity if you are buying.
