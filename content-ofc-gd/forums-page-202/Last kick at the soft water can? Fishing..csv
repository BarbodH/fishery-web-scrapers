885235,moxie,2014-12-07 16:25:00,1566,Sleeping in with the boys waiting in my driveway meant we wouldn't get on the water till 8:30am. Nice morning with calm winds and overcast skies. Set up and made one pass with nothing to show so we make our run to different water.  Marked fish throughout the water column but only a few signs of anything on the larger side. Three passes yielded 4 fish in the 7-9 lb range and one 3 lber while dropping one more. Must have hit the morning major there because it went quiet after that.  One more move saw one more fish becoming unbuttoned on the way to the boat. Packed up and pulled out by 4pm. Marked water as low as 33'5 degrees and ran into some thin ice so its only a matter of time. With temps hovering around or just above freezing next week we hope to make it out one last time.

Braving the cold sure paid off for you my man. Quinte? edit: of course it is, the jpeg says so, duhh.Those are some fat beauties you got there. Way to go, your the Dad of the day. I'm available for adoption."
