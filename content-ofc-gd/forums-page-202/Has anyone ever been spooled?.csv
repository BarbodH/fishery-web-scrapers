It just darted straight out to the lake and would not stop!  After about 40 seconds I had to hold the spool and the hooked straightened out.  Reeled in a giant scale!  Musta been one huge carp!  If I didn't see that scale it woulda been a musky tale. Caught many O salmon in the fall time off the pier that took alot of line but not quite spooled.  Now just waiting to hook into a spring chinook."

Came real close on the Kenai when I hooked up on a giant bow. Took 200 yds of 10' main line and 50 yds of backing before O got the fish stopped. Lost it after a 30 minute battle.

Nearly spooled by a large Jack..busted reel but the drag still worked. Also using a larger capacity reel...it was going to spool me but had 20 pound braided on the line and decided to make a stand near the end of the line.

Fishing on the French with less then 100 yd of line he hooks into a nice big smallmouth and has the drag set wrong, so the thing peels out line and spools him.  A few hours later he hears *rattle rattle rattle* and  few minutes later again *rattle rattle rattle*  The fish was trying to shake the hook and kept coming up to the surface. So for the next 15 minutes they are chasing around this fish and what bit of line they can find until finally my dad was able to grab a handful of it and pulled the fish in by hand."

Came close with a Lake O salmon in June, running a dipsy 240' back, fish hit and ran out to nearly 800'!!! Didn't think it was ever going to stop. Luckily nearly the whole reel was spooled with braid so I had well over 1000' on there. Long fight later, my biggest king to date at just under 30lbs.  Also on Rice, similar to Jeremy's dad - hooked into a huge smallie that broke me off, it jumped continuously near the boat for at least 15-20 minutes with my rattlin rap hanging out of the corner of his mouth!

885234,SlowPoke,2014-12-07 16:23:00,2984,I've been spooled enough to know you bring extra line to the pier. As a last resort I'll free-spool it hoping they'll turn. It's worked at least a couple times for me. The worst part about doing that is when it doesn't work and you wonder if they would have turned on their own in that last 50' of line!  Spooled out my downrigger cable last year 80 down in 120+....mystery suspended cable or something. Got my cable/cannonball back but Rob (speedtroll) is still pissed about losing his dipsy/flasher/fly rig.

In my case on the river I had just heard about it, the day before and was going through it in my mind several times just before the freight train hit my line... So, when I couldn't get it's attention the usual way, I dropped the rod almost right in the water and opened my bail.  That fish must have stopped within inches of a huge stump that was 90% blocking the mouth of the river. I honestly think it couldn't believe it wasn't free, after it turned so it wasn't a lot of trouble controlling it then. But the 2 runs it took before that were IMPRESSIVE LOL."
885334,manitoubass2,2014-12-07 23:22:00,11391,so your opening the bail to let them run?  dont most reels have a freespool mode(mine do)  ive never used it and actually never even thought of using it  I wonder if one method would be better then the other???  ive lost sturgeon where now that I think about it this coulda possibly helped me land some more fish  ....without losing 200 yards of line
884534,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-03 19:34:00,956,"It's every fisherman's worst nightmare.  They hook that big one and it takes off.  You keep your eyes on the rod with amazement and then you look down and see that your line is almost all gone.  You start panicking and try tightening your drag and then all of a sudden it's gone forever.  Happened to me at Nipissing when I was young, but I probably had the drag set to loose.  I'm sure you guys have got some stories."

My buddy and I would go out in the boat in the evening and drop anchor on this little shoal, a bucket of chicken (or whatever) and a six pack of beer (that was back in the day when you could do that sort of thing) A minnow with a small hook no leader, no swivel, no weight, we would just lob the minnow out, open the bail and sit back and solve the problems of the world. When the line started to take off, you knew you had a fish, and believe me we got plenty.  Well, this one evening the line took off, I closed the bail and set the hook which usually stopped the fish and the fight started. This night though the fish didn't stop! At some point I looked down and said something like OH CRAP I'm almost out of line. Dave my buddy figured out that with the run this fish was making it was bound to happen so he had pulled the anchor, and started the motor. We chased that fish for a full 45 minutes before I finally got it tired out enough so we could get close enough to net it. 19 lbs 7 3/4 oz according to the scale at the restraunt!"

The thing headed for the south side, but I put the pressure on when the line was almost gone and luckily got it to change direction. It was over 30lbs.

884588,dave524,2014-12-03 22:56:00,4508,"FWIW, I hear than in a river if you are going to get spooled, give the fish lots of slack so the line bellies downstream of the fish so that the current is pulling from the opposite direction, the fish will turn and run upstream away from the tension. Never had the chance to tell if it works but makes sense."

Fishing off his dock on Quinte, just tossing out worms for bass and sheepshead I had been outfishing him all day. He's at the other end of his dock and I see his rod start to waggle. 'Jer! I've got a good one' (sure you do).  The fish takes off like a rocket. Peeling line like crazy as it heads further and further out.  After what felt like 5 minutes (it was probably 2). I turn to my buddy and say 'you got lots of line on that reel?' 'Yup' 'Good. Because he's not stopping. TIGHTEN YOUR DANG DRAG!!!' 'Oh yeah!'  Finally the fish stops this epic run. Now my buddy, he's a personal trainer and is 250 pounds of pure muscle. But at this time, he had no cardio. So after about 10 minutes of pumping the rod and reeling in, he's starting to get gassed. So I start raggin' on him.  'Big tough personal trainer. Gonna let a fish beat him. What's that about?'  Finally he gets it in and lands a 15 pound Sheephead. Biggest I had ever seen."

Felt bad because I'm sure the fish did not survive long after that, unless he got the hook out of his mouth miraculously, but that is doubtful.

BIG male chinnie.  Most times though with a big salmonid it just postpones the inevitable LOL.  The time I tried dropping the line into the water on a pier though, the fish turned alright. It swam towards me so fast that I couldn't catch up to it.... The line was so slack it got caught up on another anglers line 3 people over, when the current took the slack line over his.  This clown wouldn't reel in when he was asked by the other anglers. When he saw his rod tip move he snapped his rod back to set the hook and cut through my line. I thought it was funny actually that the fish turned...  The other guy was mad though and claimed I knocked a fish off of his line LOL I said I don't think my 6lb raven could do much damage to that 20lb CTC clear mono crap you are using.

Ironically, I had caught, and landed, a tarpon of around 25-30 pounds on the same rod and reel the night before. I freakin could not turn the permit...I was actually laughing at how helpless I was.  I've never been spooled by a freshwater fish, although a silver salmon of about 15 pounds took me WAY, WAY into my backing on an 8 wgt fly rod in Alaska a few years ago. The hook pulled out on this bad boy after about 10 minutes. Who knows if I would have EVER landed him."
