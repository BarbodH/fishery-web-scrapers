The sky is crystal clear and the rays of the Sun are reflecting off the water and the warmth coming through the lakeside windows is wonderful. I have all the windows and doors open for some much appreciated fresh air in here. If I could I'd be out there dropshoting for trophy smallies, perfect conditions. I hope some off you guys and gals are out there fishing today. It sure is rare this time of year for a day like today.  For anyone looking for open water, come on down, Erie is open for business, be careful please. I read the jumbo perch are hot at Port Colbourne, Point Abino and Crystal Beach. If it's like today pick me up on the way!"
885289,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-07 21:05:00,2582,Debbe and I went for a few walks today. Loved the weather too. But I'm getting itchy for some perch/crappie  through the ice. Next weekend maybe.
