885493,Dan668,2014-12-08 19:50:00,1120,It looks like the flambeau infinity. Now im just trying to decide on the cheap case or going all out. I dont really need the tackle boxes because i bring a duffle bag along. 6 rods fit in that ct case?
885497,e-z-out,2014-12-08 20:23:00,1052,Go all out it's worth it in the end. Just cleaned out the case for the new season.
885499,misfish,2014-12-08 21:11:00,29133,Flambeau gun case $19.99 Canadian Tire. Holds five ice rods and one tackle try easily. Also gets some interesting looks on the ice ...  
885501,jimmer,2014-12-08 21:18:00,2730,True fishing fanatics on this site. LOL I use cheapo rods and just replace them if they break. Haven't had to in all the years I have ice fished.
773248,e-z-out,2013-03-12 01:07:00,1052,"Well after breaking one of my ice rods in my old rod bag it was time to splurge on this beauty.  Took some time to find one that would meet all my needs. After a week of searching I ran across Ice Fishing Innovations and they had what I was looking for.  At a price of $149.99 plus shipping at $80 and another $30 for duties grand total $259.99 I didn't mind spending the money since breaking a  thorns brother rod is not cheap by any means.  Storage system dimensions:6""H x 14.44""W x 40.63""L. 3 Tackle-boxes: 1.19""H x 4.13""W x 8.88""L1 Tackle-box: 1.56""H x 6.63""W x 10.63""L    "
773250,Terry,2013-03-12 01:16:00,14456,"nice  lots of money but I have a couple of thorns brother rods  I try to protect myself, might have to consider getting one"
773251,e-z-out,2013-03-12 01:20:00,1052,Terry this case is well built and worth every penny Thorns brother ice rods have to be the best rods built.
773288,BillM,2013-03-12 03:40:00,17367,"Wow Jose, that case is killer!   I'll be using a cheap piece of PVC never year to protect the rods..  Should run me about $5, lol."
773294,e-z-out,2013-03-12 04:01:00,1052,"Bill after breaking my Thorns Brother rod i had no choice but to buy this case. Just placed an order for 3 more rods for next season.  Never again will i break a rod, this thing is a tank."
773295,BillM,2013-03-12 04:03:00,17367,"I've snapped way to many as well.,  Just got a nice little custom GLoomis from a buddy, I will guard it with my life, lol."
773296,e-z-out,2013-03-12 04:26:00,1052,The GLoomis ice rods are sweet.  What model do you have?
773312,BillM,2013-03-12 12:22:00,17367, This is a custom job using a top section of a float blank...
773316,ecmilley,2013-03-12 13:27:00,2163,"had a ugly stik ice rod, that thing was indestructable ran it over with the sled couple times still never broke, wasn't the most sensitive though. that case looks awesome think you may of cost me near 300 bones been using one of those ht rod bags good for the closet but not so much travelling around"
773328,e-z-out,2013-03-12 14:37:00,1052,My old man told me buy it once and do it right lol I'm starting to listen now
773343,Rich,2013-03-12 16:37:00,3927,"Wow, good for storing ice equipment, or weapons grade plutonium.  You do know you can buy the heavy duty cases at walmart for $15 and stick foam in them yourself though, right?  Lol, jk, looks like a worthwhile investment, provided the gear you put in it is worth more than the case. Haha"
773366,e-z-out,2013-03-12 18:35:00,1052,"Rich I was thinking the same thing when I was at walmart but it didn't have the room I was looking for.  Now for the gear, just one set up is worth more then the case it self. Happy with the case and all it's storage"
773503,Lunker777,2013-03-13 12:35:00,866,"hmmmm....... Im thinking a power source and a ram mount on the side .... all in one F/F, rod, tackle storage system.  Nice case by the way."
773506,Nipfisher,2013-03-13 12:59:00,2449,"Jose, are those stock photos or your gear? Ironic to secure an expensive reel to an expensive rod using 10 cents worth of electrical tape. lol"
773534,e-z-out,2013-03-13 14:53:00,1052,Sad to say but it's true lol That rod only gets used by my little girl when she comes out.  I know I'll have to get the right fastener for next season.
773542,bare foot wader,2013-03-13 15:09:00,1354,"looks like a great case, thanks for the post....I recently snapped the tip on a heavy action bps extreme ice rod, can't replace it, discontinued, fav pike and laker rod....i've been looking for a good case for next year, I'll be looking into this one"
885457,Dan668,2014-12-08 14:26:00,1120,"Didnt want to start a new thread, any updates on the case? Im considering one.  Wanted to make my own but the flambeau infinity 43 (almost an exact copy) is 80 bucks.  When you add the foam,  the price creeps up to almost being the same."
885458,Sinker,2014-12-08 14:35:00,8692,Too short for a lot of my rods.  S.
885461,manitoubass2,2014-12-08 15:00:00,11391,I have a few of those HT softcases and they suck bad. its amazing i havent broken a rod in there yet(at least until i posted this lol)  i break zippers on those bags alot though for some reason?  thats is a sweet case!!!! asap I am gonna start looking for material to make something similar. that price is too steep for my current budget.  id rather my tackle be seperate though

885488,Dan668,2014-12-08 18:59:00,1120,I'm guessing you have to fold your reel handles?
885489,BillM,2014-12-08 19:00:00,17367,I'm guessing you have to fold your reel handles?  I do anytime the rods go in the case.
