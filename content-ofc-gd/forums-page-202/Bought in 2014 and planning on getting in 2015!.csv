885767,fishnsled,2014-12-10 04:46:00,3520,2014  I picked up too much down rigging stuff to list   2015  The 24ft crestliner sabre hardtop parked town the street that has not moved in a few years ( the current owner doesn't know it yet)  x2 on the the down rigging stuff and if there's 2 of the Sabre's lying around let me know.     For 2015....nothing...I swear this will be the year I spend nothing on fishing stuff.    Well a new tow vehicle is likely in the cards.  this is what I got !! A 2015 Yamaha SR VIPER !!!! Woo hoo  That's one sick looking sled!  I like it!
885777,c10,2014-12-10 05:49:00,131,"This has been a pretty costly year so far and its not over yet! lol Had to replace my St.Croix and Shimano jigging setup and dad's depth finder after they went over to the bottom of the lake  lol I bought my first baitcasting setup - a Pflueger (supreme?) Fenwick ML combo I got on sale at Sail, I have to say I really like it so far.  Also bought a couple of the Thorne Bro's Ice Rods.  Plus way too much tackle.Now I just need another jigging reel for softwater and one for hardwater, probably both Shimano  ... lol"
885779,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-10 06:28:00,8243,"Ah man I just a few weeks back pulled into the dealer to look at the exact truck, colour included. I have my like new 2011 Silverado with 50K. The same salesman that sold me mine new in 2011 didn't want to tell me what they would give me for my rig. He started off by saying your truck is fine John, only $19,000.00. I'm not getting a new one mine is great.  I picked up a 15 HP kicker that is the exact same year as my 115 and looks like it came with the boat. And a new Okuma combo downrigger rod/reel. Of course a hundred bucks of lures. Those $$$ add up fast buying tackle and I don't like keeping count.  edit: oops that's an entire fleet, sorry."

885910,wkrp,2014-12-11 00:41:00,656,Bought a Lowrance Elite 7 hdi in 2014. Plan on buying a Mustang HIT inflatable pfd for 2015
885627,Headhunter,2014-12-09 15:10:00,5703,"Well, many of us have an affliction that can only be described as GAS! Gear Acquisition Syndrome! We buy stuff and sell stuff, seeking the holy grail of what ever the heck it is we are gassing for. So I thought, with the year coming to an end soon, we could talk about what we bought in 2014 and what we are ""wanting"" in 2015. In all honesty, I didn't buy much this year, a simple 6.5ft jigging rod and a new low budget spinning reel; that's it! Probably not getting much else this coming year as my fishing time has been drastically reduced having recently become a ""hockey dad"". So, what did you get and what's on the radar for 2015? HH"
885628,Lape0019,2014-12-09 15:22:00,647,"I bought/was given: Shimano Metanium XG Shimano Chronarch 150 CI4+ Shimano Curado I 6.2:1  Dobyns 735C (used) Dobyns DX743C Megabass XX Jerkbait Special  What I am looking to acquire over the winter is:  Dobyns DX744 or Megabass XX EMTF Dobyns Champion 764CBRM 2 reels. More than likely will be JDM but I haven't decided on Daiwa or Shimano. Whatever they are, they will be for the two rods I buy.  I also have a slew of tackle I want to grab, but I am afraid the list is too long."
885630,BillM,2014-12-09 15:24:00,17367,"Picked up a Shimano Calais 100a, JDM Shimano Antares AR, Shimano Sustain 3000 FE, custom HMX steelhead hardware rod, and lots and lots of tackle.  No big plans for 2015, maybe another glass rod for the Antares."
885631,manitoubass2,2014-12-09 15:31:00,11391,"I think this was my most frugal year in terms of fishing.  All I recall buying was about $20 worth of jigs  soon Ill be buying more buckshot jigs for sure, those are deadly lures"
885632,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-09 15:32:00,956,"Not much this year.  A few lures, but no rods or reels.  Plan on buying a flasher for ice fishing season this year."
885634,manitoubass2,2014-12-09 15:36:00,11391,oh Ill be buying some more fenwick ice rods for my kiddos. love those rods for the price.  also as I stated yestereday I wanna go buy that gun case to use for my ice rods
885635,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-09 15:38:00,10439,Don't remember everything I purchased this year but I did build a couple of new rods and I did get another fishing platform to use.  
885637,Beavertail,2014-12-09 15:47:00,331,"Picked up my first boat this past spring, a used Lund. More recently a Daiwa SS Tournament 1600 for chucking salmon spoons next season, paired with a 9' heavy action Cabelas Fish Eagle 50 spinning rod."
885638,Acountdeleted,2014-12-09 15:48:00,2562,"I bought a 14 ft boat, trailer and 4hp motor which I was supposed to split with a buddy (still waiting on his half so technically its mine right now) A full setup for my girlfriend so she doesn't use my gear (5ft Ugly stick lite, Abu Cardinal reel, full tacklebox) A new Captians chair for my Kayak with 360 degree piviot Ice fishing MH ugly stick I don't even know what its called but fisherpete sold me a 2 piece beatstick perfect for catching Sheepshead, carp, catfish and hopefully General Sherman. Purchase of the year.   In 2015 I have to replace my 6'9 St.Croix Mojo bass rod and Sahara reel that I accidently kicked into the lake A reel to go with that MH ugly stick An aditional captians chair for my kayak A better driver seat for my boat An elevated 360 degree fishing chair for the front seat of my boat Top priority: A hitch for my car so I can actually tow my boat around  ......... geez....... looks like an expensive 2015."

885654,NAW,2014-12-09 17:21:00,4022,"2014 has been a complete rollercoaster for me.  I basically flipped my life upside-down.  (Sold my car, Sold my house, Quit my job, Divorced my wife, and now I have some medical issues likely due to the ridiculous amount of stress I'm under.....)  But I did buy a kayak last year!!  Of coarse I only fished out of it 2 times...  Next year I would really like to pick up a used quad for ice fishing.  But that's wishful thinking considering my current situation."

Now you need a new suit and helmet to match    I bought a new to me Bravo longtrack (now I have 2) and a beater 14' tinny and trailer.  Next year I'd like a heavy duty Pike spinning outfit

In the spring were a couple items I found used and the rest were ordered and new  Chronarch 100D7 x2,Core 50Mg7, Core 100Mg7,Stella FE 1000 I got the new  Shimano Expride 7'1H and Crucial 7'6MH bait casters back in the late winter/spring time.  This fall I picked up the new Calcutta Conquest 100, a Stella FI 3000XG, another Expride this time a 7'3XH and a Orochi XX Jerkbait rod by Megabass.

Other than that, picked up a Terrova80, a Daiwa ultralight and Crucial spinning rod to replace some broken sticks.  Most purchasing in a year goes to using what I have... using it in far off and fun places, and around home.  Nothing much to buy in 2015 for fishing... plan to spend on Arctic travel and Northern Ontario trips.  Some lures and line and a travel rod."
