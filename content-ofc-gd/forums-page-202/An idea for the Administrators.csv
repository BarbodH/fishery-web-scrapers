884947,Beans,2014-12-05 19:27:00,3339,"Gerritt...I believe that should be a double ""L""...  Also, Brian...were those ducks in a swamp ?"
884982,mike rousseau,2014-12-05 21:49:00,4661,You can probably make a few at 3m or somewhere like that fairly cheap
884728,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-04 17:54:00,956,"I know I'm very new here, but I think it would be pretty cool to have a OFC sticker so I can put it on my car.  It would be cool to drive along and see a fellow member cruising to his favourite fishing spot.  Just an idea."
884729,Fisherman,2014-12-04 18:08:00,7201,"Ya, that would work for me.  There's probably someone on the board with an insight to sticker makers.  I'd rather have the ones that can also be applied from the inside so the snow scraper doesn't peel them off."
884733,Terry,2014-12-04 18:18:00,14456,"There use to be hats , jackets , stickers and moreWhen it was OFC."
884738,lew,2014-12-04 18:55:00,12766,"Like Terry said, back in the day we had all sorts of stuff with the OFC logo on them.      "
884765,Beans,2014-12-04 22:04:00,3339,I had some on The Tin of Beans...
884766,lew,2014-12-04 22:07:00,12766,Interesting how OFC comes up  when I typed OF ENN
884767,misfish,2014-12-04 22:16:00,29133,"Lew, is that Cory?"
884768,fishindevil,2014-12-04 22:24:00,6254,
884769,Whopper,2014-12-04 22:32:00,2174, I'm not Lew but yes that is Cory

884772,misfish,2014-12-04 22:37:00,29133,I'm not Lew but yes that is Cory  Thank you. I thought so.  What ever happen to that young man? Met a girl and POOF he gone.  To bad. Real nice guy.
884773,SirCranksalot,2014-12-04 22:39:00,3291,When it was OFC.  ? Isn't it still OFC?
884774,lew,2014-12-04 22:43:00,12766, ? Isn't it still OFC?  It is now but used to be Ontario Fishing Network
884776,Whopper,2014-12-04 22:45:00,2174,"Met a nice gal, moved and is enjoying life. He's still a nice guy also"
884778,lew,2014-12-04 22:48:00,12766,He's still a nice guy also  Your absolutely correct Phil
884779,misfish,2014-12-04 22:55:00,29133,"Met a nice gal, moved and is enjoying life. He's still a nice guy also  What I meant was,be nice if he was still here. Maybe he is,just under a different user name."
884784,Terry,2014-12-04 23:18:00,14456,sorry OFC or OFC or I can't remember

884835,Rod Caster,2014-12-05 03:02:00,5784,i have an OFC mug.  I'm hoping TJ gives away OFC-labelled maple syrop to all members this spring

884880,AKRISONER,2014-12-05 14:07:00,5558,"would it be against the rules for a member (myself) to design and get stickers made and then sell them?  I did this back in the day with my old car club, also made shirts as well."
