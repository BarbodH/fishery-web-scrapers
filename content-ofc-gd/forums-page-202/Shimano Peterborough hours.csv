885285,Fisherpete,2014-12-07 20:53:00,1814,I have a couple reels to drop off for servicing - will be in Peterborough on Wed evening anyways for the MCI meeting/xmas dinner... Anyone know what time they are open till? I tried calling and kept getting bounced around between menus until I wanted to throw my phone across the room lol...  I seem to remember 4:30 or 5pm.  Thanks Pete
885288,lew,2014-12-07 21:03:00,12766,I'm thinking 5:00 Pete
885316,esoxansteel,2014-12-07 22:23:00,1307,5:00 sounds correct    bankers hours  9 to 5
885324,lew,2014-12-07 22:45:00,12766,I dropped off a TE awhile back as it just wasn't working properly. They made a couple adjustments and when I picked it up the next day there was no charge.  Wonderful folks to deal with.

885388,Fisherpete,2014-12-08 02:45:00,1814,Thanks guys.  Lew I agree - great service from them. My reels have come back mint every time and they have gone above the call of duty a few times.

885531,musky666,2014-12-08 23:55:00,126,"Love the service there, used to drive the reels out and go get em, now I ship them out and have them mailed back to my work. Got Chris to make up a parts list for my CTS 700's  in face of a slowly dwindling parts supply. Thinking its a plan to have a parts stash to keep them chuckin Musky baits through my retirement years."
