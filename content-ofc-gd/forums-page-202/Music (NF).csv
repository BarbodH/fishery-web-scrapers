I love he is doing what he does and I can't wait to see what city and musicians he will visit next. If anyone likes an eclectic mix of genres you have to catch it. New Orleans and seeing the old bars still open was fantastic. Then again the Seattle episode was great. The desert episode was different, not my favorite."
