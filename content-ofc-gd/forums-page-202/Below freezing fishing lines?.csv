883762,mike rousseau,2014-11-28 15:00:00,4661,That's what got shredded...  Maybe it was just too old
883769,BillM,2014-11-28 15:18:00,17367,"That's what got shredded...  Maybe it was just too old  Really?  Wow, you sure it wasn't Nanofil? LOL!    I've had Fireline shred, but not to the point of it ever breaking.   Even with loads of ice in my guides."
883773,Ralph Field,2014-11-28 15:56:00,1018,Fireline Crystal doesn't shred as easily as the original fireline.
883775,solopaddler,2014-11-28 16:11:00,8605,Nanofil is useless in the cold. Fireline Crystal may be a good option.
883780,Fang,2014-11-28 17:15:00,1330,I run this on both my ice rods and centre pin now. It's been good to me  Siglon Flourescent in the bright pink - it sure is easy to see ice fishing. It picks up less water running through the guides. My reels that had nanofil and crystal braid on them pulled up more water through the guides that would freeze. I'll still fish braid first when weather allows
883784,adempsey,2014-11-28 18:06:00,1498,"At first I assumed you were ice fishing, but now I am not so sure.   Does your rod have microguides?"
883792,jimmer,2014-11-28 19:04:00,2730,P-Line fluoro ice is worth checking out.
883988,mike rousseau,2014-11-29 18:40:00,4661,Regular spinning rod Regular guides Yes... Open water...  Fireline crystal... It was like the strands were all seperating... It was so bad the loops of loose strands were tangling in the guides....
883998,manitoubass2,2014-11-29 19:28:00,11391,sounds like a faulty spool. thats good line
884213,c10,2014-12-01 17:59:00,131,"The meaning of life is an easy question, it's Happiness and love. Just so happens fishing makes me happy and I love to do it ahahahahaha - so perhaps the meaning of life is indeed fishing, you guys are onto something.  I dont know why I took philosophy courses in school, I should have just come here ahahahaha     but in all seriousness:  I used the Sufix 832 last year on the ice because I had a bunch of good line that came off my open jigging rods and I wasn't keen on throwing it all away, I have big guides on my ice rods, but still the braid froze so easily - I am curious in your opinions, are there any winter superlines/braids that are similar to the Sufix 832 and good at stopping or at least reducing the ice build up on the line? (there will be ice some on my guides and lines I understand, sometimes there's not much i can do about that in -30 temps lol).  Now the line never broke or frayed because of the cold water, I suppose I am more just curious to see if there is any good braids that would reduce the ice build up and are like the sufix? It is by far my favorite line for jigging at the moment and i like to keep things the same for the most part ahaha  Thanks - Chris"
884235,manitoubass2,2014-12-01 20:31:00,11391,"the main thing about superlines like suffix 832 is that they are textured. that picks up water and viola, ice build up.  I still prefer fluoro. its smooth and sensitive. kinda in between mono and superlines"
884271,BillM,2014-12-02 00:45:00,17367,"Suffix 832 is garbage when it's warm out, god I hate that stuff.   I can't even imagine using it on the ice.  I'd probably try to stick my head in the hole and drown myself if that was the only line available."
884289,manitoubass2,2014-12-02 02:53:00,11391,"promise? lol j/k bill  I liked it when it first came out(softwater),but quickly went back to PP"
884301,c10,2014-12-02 05:45:00,131,"aha sorry Bill, sounds like I brought up some bad memories ahaha.  I have had good luck with it fishing for walleye's and pike in logs throughout the year - have never had any issues with the heat personally but meh, it may be time to try a new one as i have heard lots of guys say the same... Do you spool the flouro directly to your spool? I have generally only used it for leaders or cheaters. -Chris"
884320,Garnet,2014-12-02 14:09:00,2056,"Blakemore Reel Majic  I use it steelheading and ice fishing. I spray my float and then do 12-15 ft above the float by spray on a clean rag, then spray all guides and then your spool.  If you read the bottle it says resists ice, it also keeps your line floating and soft,  Even if you get some ice it remove much easier."
884337,c10,2014-12-02 16:42:00,131,"Yea, but is that stuff safe for the environment?  I would rather just deal with the ice build up then put more toxic chemicals in the water where i would want to take my grandkids fishing ahaha -Chris"
884340,BillM,2014-12-02 16:52:00,17367,I know a bunch of guys use Stanleys ice off paste with their float setups.
884342,bare foot wader,2014-12-02 17:05:00,1354,"Yea, but is that stuff safe for the environment?

884343,bare foot wader,2014-12-02 17:09:00,1354,"has the OP tried powerpro ice (or any of the ice branded braids)? they have a ptfe coating, helps a little bit"
884347,Garnet,2014-12-02 17:26:00,2056,That's another good thing about Reel Magic . Odorless and non toxic.  It's primary use is in the Veg/Fruit packaging industry. Guides and rollers are sprayed with this product making them slippery stopping bruising. It's silicone base but don't use the spray from CT that's oil base.
884860,c10,2014-12-05 06:59:00,131,"Hmmm, interesting stuff, thanks for the feedback guys! Seems a lot of people use it, thanks for the MSDS, I hadn't even thought of that lol -Chris"
883633,mike rousseau,2014-11-27 23:07:00,4661,What line do you guys use when fishing below 0 and your guides are freezing...  It's for a small spinning rod for jigging walleye...  My fire line basically got shredded by ice recently...  Is nanofill any good... I'd like to stay low stretch as it's for jigging walleye and sensitivity is important...  Thanks
883639,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-27 23:14:00,956,I use Berkley Trilene Cold Weather 6lb.  When the weather gets super cold it doesn't matter from my experiences the guides will get frozen up no matter what.  Glad I have a heater so I stick it close to the rod tip.  Not too close or your gonna have to redo your setup as I usually have too lol.
883640,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-27 23:14:00,10439,I use Tuf-Line Duracast for my cold weather fishing. It is coated and sheds water much better than non coated lines. Been using the same line for 3 or 4 winters now and it still performs well.
883642,misfish,2014-11-27 23:18:00,29133,I like this product for my float rod. I use mono.  http://www.questoutdoors.net/gear/tested/stanleys-ice-off-paste/
883643,manitoubass2,2014-11-27 23:21:00,11391,"nanofil shreds easy mike. a lil ice in the guides and shes toast, expensive toast!  im not to picky. i use tuff line duracast for trout, everything else is now 6-8lb fluoro. im not picky about brands either."
883645,mike rousseau,2014-11-27 23:23:00,4661,Looks like I'll try some mono or flouro ...  6lb should do...
883646,mike rousseau,2014-11-27 23:23:00,4661,Maybe 8...lol
883647,Fisherman,2014-11-27 23:24:00,7201,"Berkley mono, 6-8lb will suffice."
883649,mike rousseau,2014-11-27 23:25:00,4661,I have a spool of big game 8lb...  I'll try that  It was like the fire line unraveled itself...
883658,SirCranksalot,2014-11-27 23:41:00,3291,When the weather gets super cold it doesn't matter from my experiences the guides will get frozen up no matter what.  One way to counteract that is to have really big guides esp at the top
883659,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-27 23:43:00,956,Makes sense
883660,mike rousseau,2014-11-27 23:43:00,4661,Cause I have 2 jigging rods I'm gunna spool 1 with fresh fireline for above 0 days and the other with mono for below 0 days...  Both 6lb
883665,manitoubass2,2014-11-27 23:59:00,11391," your choice  i hate mono with a passion  even with my graph, my kids would get bit and you wouldnt even see anything on the rod. theres is like a 5 second delay. lots of missed fish if you cant feel the initial bite"
883666,EC1,2014-11-28 00:02:00,930,6# mono has been my favourite so far. Pick your favourite brand and the line that claims to be lowest memory would be your best bet.
883668,MJL,2014-11-28 00:07:00,2427,I fish outside on the ice 95% of the time. I primarily use 8lb Berkley XL for jigging deep-water lakers out of Simcoe.  I also have 8lb Berkley Fireline Crystal on one reel. It does ice up but not as bad as other super lines I've tried. I'd love to try Tufline Duracast if I can find a spool.
883669,manitoubass2,2014-11-28 00:09:00,11391,duracast is awesome but im almost thinking they went under??? i just grabbed 4 150yard spools cause thats all I could find locally. they said they wont be getting anymore either  i heard on here i believe that others were having a hard time finding it
883678,Terry,2014-11-28 00:58:00,14456,ebay  Tufline Duracast  http://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_nkw=Tufline%20Duracast&clk_rvr_id=738682107403&mfe=search

883689,manitoubass2,2014-11-28 01:26:00,11391,????????  we need to know!
883697,Fisherpete,2014-11-28 02:18:00,1814,"Mike, I used to have the same issue while ice fishing - used to use Fireline crystal and it would get shredded. The only thing that helped even slightly was having bigger eyelets. Mono/floro was better in terms of not getting damaged by the ice, but still got frozen up in the eyelet sometimes."
883698,Terry,2014-11-28 02:21:00,14456,"ah eat, drink. fish , f...................................................................."
883701,Fisherpete,2014-11-28 02:24:00,1814,I know what that f......... means Terry.  Fish some more.

883705,Terry,2014-11-28 02:26:00,14456,oh  that was fish fries don't know what happened
883717,BillM,2014-11-28 03:26:00,17367,"Fireline Crystal.  6lb on all my ice setups, 6lb on my centerpin."
