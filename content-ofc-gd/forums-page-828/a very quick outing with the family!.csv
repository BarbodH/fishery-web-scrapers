355005,Meegs,2009-06-24 01:59:00,249,"took the wife and kid out tonight for a boat ride, and dinner on the water, armed with subway subs and afew bags of chips we were on the water at 5 30.   ripped up the oro shoreline to let the little guy go for a swim along the oro beach.  After he got tired of swimming we boated for awhile longer till i came across some waypoints that have been very productive the last few weeks.  I just HAD to drop a line down to test the rigger i just had repaired yesterday.   drop the balls to bottom, start heading towards home.   10 min later the rod poped, i grabed it, set the hook and gave the rod to the kid to bring in.   he had a very tough time holding on to it so i placed the rod in one of the holders and let him reel till hes heart was content.   5 min later and still 140' back and taking off on its 3rd big run he said that he had enough!    so i grabbed the rod and finished this guy off!    SWEET fish!     watched as she swam away, brought up the other rod and left.   was back sitting at home by 7 30, with no complaints!     now gettign ready for soem salmon in the morning!      "
