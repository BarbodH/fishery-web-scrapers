354029,Joey,2009-06-20 23:47:00,9122,That is just fantastic Cliff.  I'm so happy for you.  Can't wait to see you out there in the new boat in hauling in the big ones.  Congrats  Joey
354042,Victor,2009-06-21 01:26:00,1609,"Congrats on the new toy Cliff!  I'm not creative at all so I can't help with names, but mine is called ""Girlfriend#1"""
354063,bigugli,2009-06-21 02:48:00,6138,"Hope you and the Mrs get many, many hours of enjoyment from your new boat."
354065,Nanook,2009-06-21 02:52:00,565," Thankyou for the great offer Cliff, tho' I still dont know why I earned it. As I explained in my e-mail to you, I'm sorry I cant make it that day  [Can I have a raincheck on a sunny day LOL] I wish you and Sue all the very best  with the new boat. I thought you would finish up with Pontoon boat for the later years  Jack   aka Nanook.  Ps. ""SUE TWO"" for the boat name"
354096,Radnine,2009-06-21 10:41:00,1538," I think that you got a fantastic deal Cliff, congratulations! You are going to love that boat; It is the perfect size to be fish-able yet economically and ergonomically sound (that means one guy can handle it and it won't cost you a fortune to run  ). Nice job. Enjoy. Jim"
354149,joonmoon,2009-06-21 14:53:00,528,"Ah, you picked a gooder, congrats to you guys for a well deserved new toy. As far as a name goes...""SUETWO"" has a nice ring to it."
354150,wvmedic,2009-06-21 14:56:00,144,"Hey Big Cliff congratulations, I hope you get many years of enjoyment and lots of great memories from youâ€™re new boat.  Jeff."
354152,BUSTER,2009-06-21 15:12:00,1336,CONGRATS!      As long as it comes in red!     We need pics!
354196,douG,2009-06-21 19:58:00,2693,"Well done, Cliff.  I am sure she will give you many hours of pleasure, and lots of great stories."
354233,Stoty,2009-06-21 22:49:00,2910,Congrats! Can't wait to see pictures!
354526,icedude,2009-06-22 20:45:00,459,  Congratulations! on the newest addition to your family  a long time fan of Mermaid and Siren art- I had a well -endowed Mermaid loged on my first boat in Vancouver many moons ago   how about SIREN 2    Miss Stress is pretty tough to beat   whatever you end up calling her--Have Fun!  Cheers  ID1
354539,John,2009-06-22 21:20:00,2956, I think that SUE TWO is a great name Jack!
354987,corvette1,2009-06-24 01:43:00,1765,sounds like a winner cliff congrats
355012,Spiel,2009-06-24 02:04:00,9065,"Since it's for the two of yous how bout ""Sue-Me"""
355015,camillj,2009-06-24 02:12:00,1988,Atta boy Cliff .. sounds like a fabulous addition to the family ... I hope you get thousands of days of enjoyment out of her !  By the way ... I was just relating the story of how I happened to be fishing right opposite your house (in a rental) that day when I bought your friends motor ... (once in a lifetime odds on that one) ... if you come across a similar deal I am in the market for another  J.
355068,Big Cliff,2009-06-24 09:20:00,6899," LOL, Cute and I like it but I'd have to change my name to Kirk or Marty   You'll have to refresh my memory, I'm not sure what you are talking about."
355096,doubleheader,2009-06-24 11:52:00,497,"Big Cliff really nice rig. My favorite boat name from days gone by was our old pontoon ""Mostly Sunny"" . My wife and I named her appropriately for the way we try to view life, and we've found with 4 girls a positive outlook along with an occaisional adult beverage helps keep us sane. Also, it seemed especially appropriate here in western PA where we get a lot of ""mostly sunny"" forecasts that become liquid sunshine by mid afternoon. Anyhow, it worked for us and I still like the name.  Again, great rig."
355209,fishnsled,2009-06-24 16:53:00,3520,"Enjoy the new ride Cliff and Sue, Andy as well!  Congrats!"
355252,camillj,2009-06-24 18:49:00,1988, Cliff I was out fishing on Strugeon Lake one day a couple years back when you PM'd me about a 9.9 hp motor (Seahorse) you had for sale ... I said I did still want it  and would be happy to come by to pick it up but I was out fishing at the time... well geeze if I wasnt actually trolling about 500yds from your house at the time .... talk about crazy cooincidence ... and you shoulda seen the look on the folks face at the Long Beach rentals when I returned their boat and took a motor out to my car .. I am sure they havent ever seen that happen before
355262,Headhunter,2009-06-24 19:05:00,5703,"Congrats Cliff on the new boat. I to, am lookin forward to the pics. I'll be keeping an eye out for it from July 19th to the 26th as my family and I are going to be renting a cottage from a friend, in the Long Beach area. I hope you folks have many happy memories in the new boat! HH"
355270,tinbanger,2009-06-24 19:30:00,1028,Congrats Cliff !  TB
355315,Roy,2009-06-24 21:01:00,13728,"Congrats Cliff!!!! OK, what you need to do now is take pics (with Sue in the boat) and post them TO ME!!!! I'm very happy for the both of you Bud."
355354,John,2009-06-24 22:28:00,2956,Have a great maiden voyage tonight Cliff. We need pic's.
355417,Big Cliff,2009-06-25 00:49:00,6899,"LOL, now I remember, that was my friend Eric's motor. That was a few years ago!"
355581,Beans,2009-06-25 14:15:00,3339,"Nice to hear that I'm not the ony one that has those ""Seniors"" moments...  I find myself in the ""Hereafter"" every once in a while...as in...what am I here after as I stare in the fridge looking for ?  What time do you want to get out on the lake on Sunday?  Might need some rain gear..."
353916,Big Cliff,2009-06-20 17:49:00,6899,"Well, it took a while to get everything organized and worked out but thanks to Roy, Marc, and Luc from Princecraft for all their help and input, we will be getting our new boat next Friday afternoon.  We got a fantastic deal; a Holiday DLX WS, with a 60 hp Merc, wireless bow mount trolling motor, upgraded fish finder, bumpers, dock lines, anchor, boat safety kit, 2 auto inflatable life jackets, a full tank of gas, 2 batteries, registration, numbers on the boat, and including PDI, delivered to our door and in the water for $17500.00 + tax. (and to think, I wasn't even looking at Princecraft to start with.)  I can't thank you all enough for all your help and input because without all of you I'd probably still being trying to figure out what to get!  I am lucky enough to have some very wonderful friends but two special people; Beans and Jack, would you do me the honor of being my first ""fishing partners"" in the boat next Sunday?  (sorry Friday evening and Saturday are Sue's LOL). it would be an honor to share the experience with you."
353918,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-20 17:51:00,3761,Congratulations on the fine purchase. Be sure to take a picture...whats your number again? I got to get down there sooner!  MTBF
353919,Terry,2009-06-20 17:53:00,14456,that's a great boat you are going to love it
353920,Big Cliff,2009-06-20 17:53:00,6899,Looking forward to it!  705-328-0750  I could use a good deck hand from time to time!
353921,Spiel,2009-06-20 17:54:00,9065,"Congratulations Cliff, I'm very happy for you and Sue.  It sounds like a beautufil craft and I hope you and your new lady become very intimate.  A round of applause for Roy, Marc and Luc.  Speaking of ladies I just spoke with Wayne and he's had your ole gal out several times already and is very, very happy. His boys are also pleased to be out catching fish with thier dad, a round of applause for you too."
353922,crappieperchhunter,2009-06-20 17:55:00,2582,Well done Cliff. And kudos to all involved in helping you get a DEAL.I wish you many good turns on Sturgeon in it.  I hope you and the 2 OLD FARTS   get a boatful on Sunday.
353923,wuchikubo,2009-06-20 17:55:00,1114,congrats Cliff!! Remember to post the pics from the maiden voyage!
353924,Big Cliff,2009-06-20 18:00:00,6899," Thank you so much for sharing that with me, just made my day to know that they are pleased with her. I just had a feeling when I first talked to him that he and the boys would do her proud!"
353926,John,2009-06-20 18:06:00,2956,"Congrat's Cliff and Sue. Glad everything worked out. I know that you will be very happy with the Princecraft, as Barbara and I are with ours. We will have to introduce them to each other very soon.  J & B"
353927,GBW,2009-06-20 18:07:00,8460,Nice deal Cliff!  Enjoy her!!
353932,Garry2Rs,2009-06-20 18:17:00,1425,Congratulations on the new ride. It sounds like a terrific deal! I hope you have many great days on the water with it.
353934,Big Cliff,2009-06-20 18:22:00,6899,"Hey, how about an ""help us name our new boat"" contest the prize would only be bragging rights but it might be fun.  Our last boat was called ""The Other Lady"", (she had a mirmade on her side) for a couple of reasons, she was the only other lady that Sue would let me spend time with, spend money on, and disapear into the evening with, without getting mad at me!  She was always a lady in that she stuck with me through some really rough times and never let me down. I would talk nice and stroke the throttle gently and she would purr like a kitten. Crack the throttle forward and she would spring like a panther.  She would glide across the water like a feather on a breeze, weather any storm, cold, wet, I could touch the key and she would spring to life and take me where ever I wanted to go. She has moved on to a wonderful family and her replacement will be hard pressed to live up to her reputation but I think she needs a name."
353936,Spiel,2009-06-20 18:31:00,9065,"Since this new boat will obviously be a source of pleasure I suppose ""Miss Stress"" is not quite fitting.....LOL"
353938,GBW,2009-06-20 18:33:00,8460,"""The Second best Catch"" as I'm sure Sue is the 1st..."
353940,Spiel,2009-06-20 18:41:00,9065,"The Prince ""S"" ""Thrice Lucky"" ""3 Times a Lady"" ok that's bad! ""Third Times a Charm""   Keep in mind if I was good at this my boat would already have name...."
353943,Big Cliff,2009-06-20 18:51:00,6899,"  Well, I have to tell you that so far, ""Miss Stress"" and ""The Second best Catch"" are tied for first."
353951,danbouck,2009-06-20 19:17:00,4380,"Congrats on the fine boat! You got one hell of a deal.  As for names  I like ""Miss Stress"""
353953,TJQ,2009-06-20 19:20:00,7806,Good for you Cliff!
353964,CLofchik,2009-06-20 19:50:00,854,Cliff Hanger?  Cliff Dwelling?  Jump Off A Cliff?
353986,Beans,2009-06-20 21:25:00,3339,Thanks for the invite Cliff...looking forward to fishing with you and thanks for the honor of being the first...will do my best to get her all slimey...
354010,Jonny,2009-06-20 22:16:00,1380,"Big thing to get a new boat. Congrats!  Call her ""Lollipop""  (The Good Ship)."
354013,JohnF,2009-06-20 22:18:00,3494,"Did anyone suggest ""Itzadundeel"" yet?  JF"
354014,JeffBornFishin,2009-06-20 22:21:00,260,Congrats on your new ride.  You and Sue sure deserve it!  It am sure it will give you many years of new memories.  Am I correct in thinking that you also chose this as it looks like it will fit your marine railway/boathouse  Look forward to seeing that first post and pics
354021,Greencoachdog,2009-06-20 22:39:00,8163,"  ""The Boat Formerly Know as Princecraft""?"
