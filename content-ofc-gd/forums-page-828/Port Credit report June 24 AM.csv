355488,icefisherman,2009-06-25 03:45:00,952,"I invited a very good fishing buddy to fish with me and my son today at Port Credit and was a bit worried after not so good recent reports...was even thinking to run to the Blue Zone to make Arnie happy and get him some action. But we managed to find plenty of action real close  - 95-160 fow....mixed bag of fish spoons and flies, two big size Kings - one just over 20 the second one at 27Lbs (biggest ever in my boat) and bunch of bows kept the action going from 5:30 to 11:30am. Arnie and my son were both happy and that sure made me even happier. Sure glad I saved my gas and stayed close...plenty of time to run to the deep no need to do so as long as fish is near by Few shots from the day for your viewing pleasure:                Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
