I have a fiberglass boat and I'm replacing what looked and feeled like the caulking where the metal bumper (the middle is rubber) meets the fiber glass, I believe it is the spot where the two halfs of the boat come together.  Can some one recommend what to use to seal this? I am wondering if I should get a marine grade or just go to home depot and pick up a tube of out door clear silicon.  Any help would be much appreciated."

Should be able to get it at your local CTC.  Make sure the joints are clean before starting.  Silicone is best left for the bees...boobies."
