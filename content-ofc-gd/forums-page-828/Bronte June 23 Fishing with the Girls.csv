The big girl was caught on wire out 220 with a gator spinnie,   First couple came on SWR rig with a dewbie combo      I couldn't believe the scale      Me and the wife "
355035,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-24 03:07:00,0,Nice to see ya out kicking some salmon ass in that boat. It did Pete well out there. Looks like it's doing you the same.  Nice shootin.  I know what that cloths line is for at the back...  Told Pete he should have put a Bar between the riggers for extra rod holders.

Before I had downriggers, I only used dipseys and you can always run a dipsey straight back on a 0 setting for extra depth."
