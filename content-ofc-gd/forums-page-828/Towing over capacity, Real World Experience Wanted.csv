354849,bigbuck,2009-06-23 18:40:00,2449,"Towing overweight is no fun!! You literally cannot stop your vehicle in a panic situation!! Look into renting a slip somewhere if you don't want to upgrade your tow vehicle, it will probably be cheaper that way. There are those who say go for it but I'll tell ya, I towed my boat which with the trailer weighs about 32-3300 lbs with my minivan which has a tow capacity of 3500lbs and it was not fun. The thing did not want to stop. When the boat comes out in the fall, I'll borrow my brother's big Yukon to tow it. Towing capacity is a maximum weight the vehicle can pull with a 150lb driver and absolutely nothing else. Having done some towing this year, I've come to respect the 2/3 rule, don't tow something that weighs more than 2/3 of your maximum tow capacity. I hate to be a killjoy but I've got to share the road with everyone else in a safe manner."
354851,BUSTER,2009-06-23 18:46:00,1336," oh really?  then how can a transport tow 100,000lbs  the load weights WAY more than the tow vehicle? dodge diesel can tow 16000lbs? isnt that way more than the vehicle?"
354852,Joey,2009-06-23 18:47:00,9122," Ziki, we are only trying to point out possible reasons for not doing it, which has all been good advice as far as I can see.  Something about doing it you may not have thought of.  As for real world experience and unrealistic catastrophic scenarios, I am speaking about those.  I work in insurance and for example, just did a report on a dentist who lost some fingers while changing a tire.  Talk about a life changing event!!!  poop happens and we are only trying to guide you in the right direction.  Don't take it the wrong way bud.  Joey"
354858,BillM,2009-06-23 19:21:00,17367,"As long as the vehicle is rated for it, the trailer can weight twice as much if not more then the tow vehicle."
354862,SlowPoke,2009-06-23 19:31:00,2984,"Your best bet would be to moor it at a marina - cheaper than buying another vehicle. Not to beat a dead horse, but... Too many people are fixated with having enough power to get up to speed or traction for pulling a boat up a launch ramp. Passenger cars, truck and vans are designed with 75-90% of their braking power on the front axle under normal conditions. When you add tongue weight to your vehicle, it drastically reduces braking efficiency and steering control. Add a morning dew or a gravel road to the mix and you're asking for big problems. You can lighten your tongue weight by shifting axles or shifting the boat but you're still faced with the tow vehicle stopping the load. Asking a 2000lb car to stop a 5000lb boat in the best of conditions is a lot to ask. The answer, trailer brakes? (addressing those suggesting trailer brakes will solve your problems) Why not have your trailer do most of the braking for you? When you apply the brakes on the trailer, the tongue dives and will lift your tow vehicle's front axle, thus no braking and poor steering."
354891,Jer,2009-06-23 20:54:00,1426,"  ...big air-brakes on those transport trailers. ...hard to compare a Highlander to a Cummins deisel 3500 (and again any trailer 16,000lbs has some brakes)."
354895,DanD,2009-06-23 21:05:00,2223,"A highway tractor trailer is designed to work as an assembly; with braking being shared between the tractor and the trailer. Most of which also use some form of anti lock braking system, on both the tractor and trailer.  As for the Dodge trucks that are rated for the 16000; you’re right they can pull all that weight and likely more. But as soon as the combined weight of the tow vehicle and loaded trailer exceeds 10500Lbs (4800Klg); the trailer is required to have some form of functioning brakes (electric or surge); plus both the tow vehicle and trailer must go through a yearly safety inspection.  All we’re talking about is you, me or anyone trying to pull a weekend boat trailer, with an undersized tow vehicle; there’s no comparison.  As for this Highlander being able to pull this boat? I bet it could and probably not do a bad job of it, with the proper weight distribution hitch. But now let’s see if it can stop or make an emergency maneuver with 5000Lbs pushing it and not loose control. That’s the legal aspect that I mentioned in my last post. Even if this trailer in question has surge brakes; the brake actuator should also be matched to the tow vehicle. That’s so the trailer brakes start applying, before the trailer starts pushing the tow vehicle.   There are so many reasons not to do this and I really do understand why Ziki would want to try; it is only 5 Klm; but that’s where most accidents happen; close to home.  Dan."
354898,glen,2009-06-23 21:11:00,2641,I just check the towing capacity of my tow vehicle and i am under the limit.  Thats good because i have been towing with it for the last three years.

355055,MillerPhoto,2009-06-24 04:54:00,147," When I was 24 I owned a 1980 GMC 1 Ton with 35"" Tires and 8"" lift, and a Corvette LT1 Motor... I had basic coverage on my truck which I would pay $56 a month... small amount compared to a large fine, or worse injuries... If the truck is only worth a grand or so.. why bother with theft or fire or collsion.. more then likly if someone hits you.. in a old gmc, theres going to be more damage to their new vehicle compared to a old chev..  New fenders.. $60.... new doors $250...  new bumpers.. $150..   cheap to repair.. compared to a newer vehicle..  But glad to hear your going to not haul it with your Highlander..  One guy wasn't so lucky when he wouldn't listen to me.... Explained how to load his popup trailer..  Did he listen... no..  He was heading camping for the weekend down in NY.. We installed the hitch on a wednesday.. thursday afternoon he was leaving... He loaded his trailer his way.. Didn't make it even 5km, and the hitch ripped through the frame.. He was only down the road so he just drove that way to our business and came in screaming and yelling.. me and my manager and him went out and looked, sure enough ripped the chasis to shreds... went to try and remove the trailer from the hitch... couldn't lift it.. i was like what the hell.. long story short.. he thought he would have more traction if he loaded everything in the front of the trailer.. he had aprox 600lbs on the tounge..... for a hitch that was rated for 300 on the tounge...  In the end.. he appoligized for the way he reacted.. and if my memory serves me right.. the body shop charged him a little over $1800 to repair the frame...  Thats only one of many...  Just happy to hear your not going to be one of them.."

I don't know where we were at but it was like trying to make a left hand turn on a bowling ball. The pontoon ended up on it's side and we needed help to get out.

And no its not a matter of being uncomfortable.. cause I have hauled anything from 4'x4' trailers up to 36' travel trailers with various vehicles, and have over 1.5Million Km driving experience.. and only 29 yrs old..  But its just the saftey aspect of being in a collision.."

355542,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-25 12:32:00,1022,"Not that I support people towing with improper tow vehicles, but I spoke to a MTO officer yesterday and he said there is no rules saying you have to tow with a proper tow vehicle. He said he will pull somebody over if they are slowing traffic, their hitch is almost hitting the ground, chains dragging, or if their trailer appears unsafe."
354650,Ziki,2009-06-23 02:25:00,128,"My V6 2001 highlander has a towing capacity of 3000lbs. I am receiving for free a boat that weighs 4-5000 lbs.  Obviously in most cases this would be a terrible idea. But i have a very short commute between the only boat launch I will be using and my home ~5km.  Because of the short commute I would hope that problems with my tranny overheating would be non existent.  The original owner tows the boat with a V6 ford explorer, he has no problems.  My concern is for pulling the boat up the ramp.   Any experiences?  Thanks  Ziki"
354670,MillerPhoto,2009-06-23 04:24:00,147,"Those rating are placed on the hitches for a reason.. I was a Accessory Technician for 3 yrs with Van & Truck World.. Seen the results of people trying to overload!!  Not pretty...  If your guessing a the weight of the boat of nearly 1000lbs difference.. I would recommend going to a local weigh scale to get the true weight of the boat.  Another fact is that your Highlander's frame us a UniBody Chassis compared to a Solid C-Channel Chassis on the Ford Explorer. Unibody sheetmetal is about 1/8 of the thinkness of the Explorer Frame... Also the Highlander Chassis is auctually a altered Camry Chassis.  Find a old soild frame truck for a couple hundred bucks and just have it for hauling the boat back and forth.. will save you thousands in having the rear chassis replaced after the boat riping it apart..  Big difference from hauling a overload on the road, flat even surface.. compared to hauling at a incline on a ramp."
354700,Jer,2009-06-23 11:07:00,1426,"I would also be concerned about stopping that puppy, especially in an emergency. Tow capacity ratings also take the brakes into consideration."
354701,Fisherman,2009-06-23 11:07:00,7201,"Not to forget that the boat/trailer would outweigh the tow vehicle, not a good idea.  Any brakes on the trailer?"
354706,Billy Bob,2009-06-23 11:21:00,5865,"For the 5km trip I wouldn't worry about it or even give it a second thought and you will not have a problem at the launch ramp. Believe me I am definitely one that believes in a larger tow (I have a Toyota Tundra) vehicle then necessary but that's for long hauling. For what you are doing, relax and go fishing.  When I was younger I owned a 1980 Ford Pinto Wagon and towed my boat from my cottage to the State Launch on Chautauqua Lake for YEARS but it also was only about 3-4 miles down the road and never had a problem at the launch ramp. BTW that Pinto was powered by a 4 cylinder 2.3 L engine........  Your going such a short distance your motor or tranny doesn't have a chance to over heat......  Now Go Catch a Fish, Bob"
354707,lookinforwalleye,2009-06-23 11:22:00,4399,"There are a lot of people towing with vehicles that have no business towing, I saw a guy once towing a 17 foot Crestliner with a Mazda 3.

354708,justin elia,2009-06-23 11:26:00,151,"Your true concern should be below, not whether you can bring the boat up the ramp. 1-get into an accident, you may be charged with careless driving 2-insurance may not cover if there is any damage to the boat or truck eg. trying to pull the boat up a ramp and truck gets sucked down 3-your brakes arent ment for that weight, you could easily get pushed through an intersection  Safety should take precedence."

My boat/trailer were about 1000lbs and with my camping gear I would be holding up traffic goin up some of the hills going up north. It was funny at the time, but very unsafe. Without the gear it was not too bad but the braking was the main concern. I think that with your car you should be ok, as long as the hitch is a class 3. As for having difficulty at the ramp, it should be ok. Try using a low gear. I have pulled my boat out of sand launches with my jetta."
354735,SBCregal,2009-06-23 13:05:00,688,"if you're looking for real world experience with people towing things they shouldnt be, sit on the side of the 400 on a long weekend."
354740,DanD,2009-06-23 13:30:00,2223,"I would be looking at the legal aspects of towing this boat rather then whether the Highlander physically could or not. If the MTO spots you, or even a cop; that knows what he’s looking at; you’re not going fishing that day. The MTO cannot normally pull over a passenger vehicle; unless it’s an authorized safety blitz from the Minister of transportation. But as soon as you hang a trailer on the back of that passenger vehicle; you’re fair game to them. If you’ve ever been pulled over by a cop and they decide to do a tire kicking safety; that aint nothing compared to what the MTO is going to put you through. Borrow, rent or buy a proper tow vehicle; your wallet will thank you.  Dan."

354764,wvmedic,2009-06-23 14:55:00,144,"millerphoto is right on, get you’re self an old truck for a couple hundred bucks and use it as a dedicated tow vehicle. You will be far better doing it this way, and then no need to worry about damaging you’re daily driver and costing you money in repairs and possibly lost time at work because you’re car wont run.  But to answer you’re question, you might be able to tow the boat and retrieve it at the launch but you will need to be in 4 low. You will though have no margin for error, you’re highlanders curb weight is 1760 kg = 3880 lb. horse power 220 with 222 ft-lb. torque.  So the boat even at 4,000 out weighs you’re tow vehicle, you again could probably do it. But it would not be very safe, and not worth the risk of injure to you’re self or others not to mention the possible damage to you’re daily driver.  BTW yes I have towed stuff that I should never have, but I was young and wasn't using my head.  Jeff."

354776,johnnyb,2009-06-23 15:16:00,3413,"If you knowingly tow something over capacity, you are in for a heap of trouble if something should happen...I wonder if insurance would even cover you?  Tough call when you're so close to the launch, but, not a tough call when you think of the possible repercussions.  Perhaps someone at the launch facility would be happy to do it for you in exchange for....a few bucks?  A few fillets?  A few 6-packs?  Just thinkin' out loud.."

354794,BITEME,2009-06-23 16:04:00,1968,I would think that you could run into problems with the MOT pulling you over and tearing you a new one not sure on that though you should check it out. All enforcment agencies are going to be blitzing towed vehicles this year and will have little sympathy  Just a thought not a boat but same idea ministry pulled 18 trucks over somewhere out in the west end the other day They pulled 13 of the 18 off the road
354796,Billy Bob,2009-06-23 16:06:00,5865,"Forget the idea that your boat out weighs your tow vehicle. SO WHAT......My Tundra weighs 5300 lbs and I can tow up to 10,800 lbs as listed by Toyota.....that's more than TWICE the weight of my tow vehicle. And if you can get yourself a truck to tow it for only a couple of hundred bucks that's road worthy send some down here.  Again, for the VERY SHORT distance I wouldn't worry about it but if you want you can always add brakes to the boat trailer if it's not already equipped."
354822,MillerPhoto,2009-06-23 17:25:00,147,"  Thing is with hauling that much weight, which is what Toyta Reccomends... You should read the fine print where it says that its using proper trailering equipment.. Such as trailer brakes!  Look around.. you will find older early 80's trucks that you can pick up for about 500.. you might put 2-300 into them. but they are easy to maintain, and cheap to repair. And will haul that boat safely"
354831,wvmedic,2009-06-23 17:58:00,144,"Again I agree with miller photo.  Billy Bob, just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should.  When I was 19 y/o I went to work for a wrecker company and drove for them over the next six years, I started out on the small stuff running 1 tons. I had experience with bigger stuff, I had been with my uncle and step-dad all over the united states running 18 wheelers since I was 8 y/o. As I got older I started helping out with the driving ect., so I soon moved up to they heavy hauling. I had a crew out on a service call near Thanks Giving for a semi hauling a load of frozen turkeys that had broken down, turns out the injector pump or something with the fuel system was out and we couldn’t fix it.  So they radioed back and advised the dispatcher of such and that the truck was going to need a tow, well the owner of the company was there and told me to go tow it. The tandem axel Mack I normally drive was broke down, so he says take the GMC and see what you can do. I told him there is no way the GMC is going to pull that combo, the GMC was a C40 but the owner being greedy and a little on the shady side made me go. I got there and hooked up to the combo because the driver wouldn’t drop the trailer, and pulled the whole thing 10 miles to a service center.  The truck driver wouldn’t ride with me he said I was crazy, he was correct. I was a twenty something hot headed guy that my boss had just made madder than fire, so I did something I shouldn’t have just because I could.  So just because you can it doesn’t mean you should.  The cost of an old truck v/s the liability and the possible damage to his daily driver is cheap insurance.  Jeff."
354833,Ziki,2009-06-23 18:02:00,128,yes but insurance on another truck?
354842,craigdritchie,2009-06-23 18:28:00,1586," 1. A careless driving charge would be the least of your problems. Driving overweight means a good chance of being charged with reckless endangerment. That's a criminal charge. Say buh-bye to your driver's license, and hello to 12 to 18 months in the Crowbar Hotel. Hope you like your new husband.  2. Get into an accident towing overweight and your insurance company won't cover you - end of discussion. Hope you have a solid credit to cover the damages, plus any medical bills. Oh, and have fun in court with the inevitable lawsuit that will result.  3. Brakes can only stop what they're designed to.  Absolutely agree with Miller Photo - buy a cheap beater that can haul the boat safely."
354843,Joey,2009-06-23 18:28:00,9122, It will be cheaper than the liability you will be paying for the rest of your life when you're insurance company won't cover you!!!
