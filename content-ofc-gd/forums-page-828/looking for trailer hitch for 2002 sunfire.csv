355661,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-25 18:04:00,2038,Most U Haul centers sell and install them.....
355688,Stoty,2009-06-25 19:25:00,2910,Same with Crappy Tire. Possibly Van & truck world too
355711,muskeybugged,2009-06-25 20:37:00,282,Cobra in West end Mississauga had one for my Sentra when everyone else failed.  I needed it done quick and they asked me to pick up the hitch from their supplier ( can't remember the name for the life of me ) Dundas / Winston Churchill area.
355724,skankbutta,2009-06-25 21:34:00,32,Do you need it installed? Or are you doing it yourself?
355725,Billy Bob,2009-06-25 21:35:00,5865,Since the Sunfire only has a 2.2 L engine and can't have much of a towing capacity couldn't you just duct tape the trailer to the bumper...
355828,bigbuck,2009-06-26 02:21:00,2449,I'll second U-Haul.I hope you don't plan on towing anything heavy.
355840,MillerPhoto,2009-06-26 02:59:00,147,Van & Truck World carrys them..  HiddenHitch - Part #60864  GTW - 2000lbs Tongue - 200lbs
355850,pike slayer,2009-06-26 03:40:00,1177,you mean a tow hitch to tow your sunflower?
355900,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-26 12:35:00,1022,"Whatever you do don't go to Uhaul they charge an arm and a leg. 100-150 more than the going price, for the same thing. If your down to drive to hamilton I can suggest places that will do it for about 250-300 installed. Shoot me a PM if interested."
355903,MillerPhoto,2009-06-26 12:46:00,147,"Uhaul trailer hitches are crap, they rust out quick and seem to more be for temp applications.. hence they are a moving company and people go to them when they need to move, so they use the hitch once and thats it. They use basic paint on their hitches.  Hidden Hitch uses powder coating or a really good enamal paint, ive had my hitch on my car three years, and I could remove it and probly sell it for new lol. The chrome came off the ball before any marks on the hitch"
