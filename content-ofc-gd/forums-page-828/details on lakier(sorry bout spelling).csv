355882,Bly,2009-06-26 11:22:00,1556,"Hey D,  You are not too late.  Tent sites are VERY reasonable, call the lodge for availability  (Terry posted a link and the number)  There is a tourney for Pike..Crayola Cup....Saturday AM (no entry fee if that is why you are asking about money)  Prizes etc.   Usually everyone brings a donation and usually everyone walks away with something  Pot luck on Saturday, bring a dish to pass   More than one person has used a canoe for the weekend, they also have very nice cedar rentals.  Estimated drive time.....4-4.5 hours from Oshawa  As for fish......Pike, Walleye. Musky, Bass and whatever else is swimming around Lake Nipissing  Most people aim to be there for the weekend but some will  arrive before and/or stay longer."
