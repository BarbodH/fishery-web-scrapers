I just don't know what they are!  Any comments, or links to good articles would be great.  I want to learn more about these tanks.  Thanks,  F-is-H"

Temperature is a main factor. There is a magic water temperature around 70F that would trigger most carp into spawning mode but still, they don't all do it at the same time.  From my experience, carp start spawning when I start to blank, until I start to catch again ;-)  But seriously, I think in this part of Ontario it can be anywhere between early June to late July."
355956,Marko,2009-06-26 15:14:00,854, Dont blame  your inability to catch carp on spawning season hahah I have been hearing that carp are spawning around Hamilton for past 3-4 weeks and still going at it. I would think that temp is the main thing and like mentioned above they dont all spawn at the same time.
