355837,bje,2009-06-26 02:48:00,11, We caught a beautiful five-six foot Sturgeon exactly the same way on Lake St. Clair last summer. It was foul hooked while we were musky trolling at over 4mph. We estimated the fish to be over 60lbs! I usually hear of about 5-6 accidentally caught this way each season.  It was extremely difficult to bring her to the boat though as she was hooked on the belly and literally had to be dragged in sideways. There was another boat trolling close by. Their crew was literally jumping out of their skin as the big tail thrashed!!  Thankfully we were able to unhook her and get her swimming again without any trouble!  Truly an incredible experience! I plan to learn how to fish for them in the Detroit River this season.

LETS DO IT!  trolled all day.  tried out my new lures.  put the bulldawg on...  i hook a fish.  ITS BIG!  im thinking its a 50'' +++ musky.  im shaking.........  10 minutes after it gave me the fight of my life.  DISAPOINTEMENT!       bye bye dinosaur!
354226,jediangler,2009-06-21 22:26:00,1923,Nice one. I wouldn't be dissappointed. Nice release shot too.
354227,Rich,2009-06-21 22:29:00,3927,"Holy cow, I'd say getting a sturgeon on a bulldawg is more memorable than a musky any day!"
354231,motv8tr,2009-06-21 22:42:00,2587,"Geez, I'd love that kind of disapointment....beats the heck of out not catching anything....but then I'm not that fussy....  Maureen"
354235,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-21 22:55:00,2038,"Nevermind Dinosaurs ....  Did you happen to see any Osprey's flying around today , I could see that huge nest from Baie Noire where Cathy and I were Birding ..."
354241,Handlebarz,2009-06-21 23:35:00,3790,"I would take that over the 18"" musky I got today or the rock bass dad got nice shots thanks for sharing"
354250,Fishing 24/7,2009-06-22 00:28:00,709,yeah that is a nice fish ...  but the way i got it.  it was a fool hook.  hunting for musky.  only goog thing that came out of it are the lampreys i got off of em. 5-6 of them...  sucking the living life out of the poor thing.  have a great life SIR yellow sturgeon!
354251,Bondar,2009-06-22 00:54:00,817,"lol i was  wondering how you get a sturgeon trolling for muskie now it makes sense Cool fish either way , There are some big ones around"
354483,lunkerbasshunter,2009-06-22 17:48:00,2585,yeah not bad disappointment.  truely an amazing fish  cheers!
354523,douG,2009-06-22 20:35:00,2693,Wonderful incidental catch.  Congratulations!
354559,shurik_muff,2009-06-22 22:30:00,35,"man, this is by far the tastiest fish in this world. who tried it, knows what i am talking about. 2 bad is not a keeper.  great catch..."
354679,siwash,2009-06-23 04:58:00,683,"Given that sturgeon are pretty rare and unique, I'd say you caught a dandy... in fact, given the choice, I'd take a sturgeon over a musky just out of sheer curiosity..."
354683,highdrifter,2009-06-23 07:24:00,2534,"How deep were you fishing???  Seriously, quit yanking our chains..  Tell the truth eh, ya got bored trolling and pulled out the old clump of chicken liver and wide gap didn't ya!!  Beautiful fish though.  Congrats.  Even if ya are a total sketch ball!!"
354685,scuro2,2009-06-23 08:59:00,904," Seeing that the Sturgeon is a bottom feeder, they don't mature until 15 to 30 years of age, and can live for 150 years...I'd be a little worried about toxins.  Beautiful fish! It gave you the fight of a lifetime, and remember most anglers never catch one."
354727,ehg,2009-06-23 12:14:00,2666,"That's a cool catch, i would be the opposite of disappointed with that!"
354894,Fishing 24/7,2009-06-23 21:00:00,709,  i SWEAR on my great great great grand pa grave that i hooked it with a bulldawg.  did you ever see the hooks on those things.  there razor sharp...  that sturgeon was minding his own buisness in 8 FOW.  then a great big white LURE SMASHED him right on the side of the CORPS.  the hook dug right in the fleash and the fight was on. 
354996,mepps,2009-06-24 01:52:00,1301,thats awesome!
355011,camillj,2009-06-24 02:03:00,1988,Wow .. quite a catch ! Even if it was a little 'foul' ... hey ...Ive caught lots of musky and never a sturgeon ... I DID once almost foul hook one too .. when I was casting towards what I thought was a huge boulder on the Ottawa river .... and the behind the boulder was a big smallmouth bass ... anyhow ... as my mepps dragged across the top of this boulder I saw a huge swirl in the mud about 5 feet back .... and the boulder drifted off into the deeper water .... and I realized this was about a 6 foot sturgeon .. only one I have actually seen ...  Anyhow .. great catch and release ... next time you'll get your musky
355161,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-24 14:23:00,947,Mmmm Fresh caviar
355172,setomonkey,2009-06-24 14:45:00,872,"Though accidental, that's an awesome catch. I've only seen sturgeon in aquarium tanks, would be cool to see one live in the wild.  Mike"

355221,cityfisher,2009-06-24 17:33:00,959,great catch !
355238,Greencoachdog,2009-06-24 18:16:00,8163, Where did you hook it Kevin?... here in Alabama if a fish is hooked anywhere in the head it is considered a legal catch!  You gotta admit that the fight and catching a big fish was worth it!  Good on you for removing those disgusting Lampreys!!!
355256,wuchikubo,2009-06-24 18:51:00,1114,"Wow, I wouldn't have minded that incidental catch, although it was fouled hooked (as you mentioned), it still would have been one to mark off my list of fish caught!"
355259,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-24 18:57:00,3761,"A big beauty sturgeon giving you a 10min+ fight. Nothing wrong with that bud, what a extraordinary fish to catch!  Congratulations,  MTBF"
