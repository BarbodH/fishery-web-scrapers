355418,Mike the Pike,2009-06-25 00:52:00,3421,"Well Hello again its been awhile since I have been on the site but busy fishing.  Haven't caught anything big lately but fishing has been pleasant.  Taking my Son out fishing with a broken arm had some challenges but he sure was determined to not let the cast hinder his fishing.  So on with the report.  June 6th GlennK and I fished as a team once again in the Laprairie fishing Tournament on the St-Lawrence River just east of the Champlain Bridge in the Belle Province of Quebec.Last year we had placed foutrth in the Grand slam Tourny but not this year.It seems many had a successful day fishing as well.One of my favorite fihing tourmaments for sure.We did catch our Grand Slam a Perch,Pike And Walleye.We had a member from our group of friends finish 3rd.All in all a great tourmament nice prizes and draw prize of a 14ft princecraft with 9.9 Merc and trailer.  For the first time we tried real leeches and they were amazing we picked up some walleye and many perch unfortunately the Gobies have now found there way to Montreal.  Here are some pics.   First pike of the day .Darn Glenn had to show me up shortly after.     It started raining so we just tucked under the Champlain Bridge and jigged no need for the rain gear.     Too risky .Hello boyz time to move!!!!!!!!!!  Not many picks from that day.   June 20th I entered the Thomas Marine fishing tournament with my son  in Varennes once again on the St-Lawrence. we were not close to the prizes but enjoyed our day.Managed to catch 4 pike thats it.  Pics     Oh and GCD these are K-Bec fish caught in nothing but Tiller boats   Draw prize.   Kidz prizes.   More draw prizes.   My son Ryan he caught 0 fish but I promissed him he could have the boat if they drew my name which never happened.   2.5 Mercury another Draw prize there were 2 given away.   Nice trophies.  First place:  Pike 9.6lbs  Bass 4.25lbs  walleye 6.77lbs  Perch a whopping 1.3lbs.  Thanks Thomas Marine for another great amateur fishing tournament. They raised $7500 for charity for Enfant Soleil.    All the kids in the tourny .Luc our host and Stephane Gosselin from the fishing show Expedetions de La Faune. Every kid left with a fishing rod and many goodies.  ................................................................................ ......................................................................  Trip #3 it was time to put my boy on some fish and thats what I did . So while you were all at work today in Ontario & USA we enjoyed our Quebec Holiday fishing. Today we were on the Richelieu River Sabrevois Quebec.  He finally out fished my and he did it one handed despite having a cast I never helped him reel in fish .He was able to net all my fish during our last 2 days fishing.      Our very own GlennK   Trying to unhook the critter.     Want to buy some bait.   A surprize for Glenn a Bowfin.     The man was happy a 5lb pike.He would not do the horizontal hold in fear of sliming his cast.     can you say boat traffic.   And the Lunker of the day GlennK a new PB a 4lb Largemouth.  What a great day.MTP"

355443,Greencoachdog,2009-06-25 01:43:00,8163,"Great report and pics Mike!!!   ... yanno, if you had a console boat... you'd catch more and bigger fish!!! (just remember fishin' out of cousin Dan's boat just a short while back eh!!!)  Glad to see Ryan didn't let the broken wing get in the way!!!"
355526,Mike the Pike,2009-06-25 11:56:00,3421, 50%percent of all fishing boats in canada are tillers.So is it tiller in Lakair in the woody or are you hallin sade console up North?

355536,b2kptbo,2009-06-25 12:27:00,1505,Good reports Mike and WTG Ryan...
355842,Mike the Pike,2009-06-26 03:02:00,3421," Some how by boy has been very determined to go fishing despite his cast up to his shoulder.  Next week he gets a shorter cast below the elbow made of fiberglass he can go swimming ,take showers and be able to cast further can't wait to see him happier next week.  MTP"
