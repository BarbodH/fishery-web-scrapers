Was wondering if anyone could pass on info/suggestions/don't let the door hit you as you pass kenora sorts of advice on fishing in winnipeg and area, including NW ontario.  My payback will be sharing some photos of my work related trips to the arctic....perhaps even some of those fur-bearing northern trout..  I will most likely be shore bound for the first while until I can get my canoes and boat out there.  Any help is appreciated."
355627,limeyangler,2009-06-25 16:21:00,5204,Thought these 2 sites might be useful to ya. One is softwater....the other for icefishing....the links are to the 'Manitoba' sections of the websites.  Manitoba soft water site    Manitoba icefishing forum    If your in winnipeg your only an hour from Lake of the Woods.......3 hours from Lac Seul....if your missing Ontario that is.

There is some very good trout fishing in the province too.  Manitoba Fishing Info   Another bonus is Kenora is only 2 hours away!!
355911,troutologist,2009-06-26 13:16:00,951,Many thanks guys...after some preliminary research I'm glad to find out there's some trout to be caught. I still figure i'll need to polish up my walleye skills.

355959,Marko,2009-06-26 15:23:00,854,There are some huge cats and carp at red river to be had. Plus Walleye fishing is really good later in the fall.
