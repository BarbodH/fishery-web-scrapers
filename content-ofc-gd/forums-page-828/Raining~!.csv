355746,splashhopper,2009-06-25 22:17:00,2931,stopped raining for now.. temp has dropped about 3-4 degrees... yeahhhhhh clouds are still thick though
355747,KelfuN,2009-06-25 22:18:00,246,the thunders are coming in now.
355755,JohnF,2009-06-25 22:34:00,3494, We got a light shower here. Now it's clearing. Just made it even more humid. I stood outside barbecuing chicken thru the whole thing. My neigbour was cutting his lawn while it happened.  I don't want a downpour. It'll just crap up the creeks here. They're too small to handle too much outflow.  JF
355770,ch312,2009-06-25 23:01:00,1590,i was working in st thomas today hoping for the rain to come so we could go home...it stayed just east of us and i had the pleasure of replacing balconies in the direct sun...32 degrees  i guess aylmer had a small twister. here in brantford half of my backyard is flooded. there is more than twice the amount of water here now than after fast spring melts so it must have came down pretty damn good here today. lets hope it rains in st thomas tomorrow so i can come home early
355774,Jonny,2009-06-25 23:21:00,1380,"27, sunny and light winds up here.  I hate thuderstorms. We have a lot of big trees and the high wind gusts sometimes worry me."
