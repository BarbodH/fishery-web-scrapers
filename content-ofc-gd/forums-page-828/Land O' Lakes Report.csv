No luck with the walleye, maybe because of a HUGE mayfly hatch? A ton of fish, I'm assuming bass and pike were grabbing these mayflies off the top of the water everywhere, could have been an amazing time with a fly rod and a mayfly fly. Would the walleye be grabbing these mayflies off the top too? If only bass season was open    Not easy fishing by any means, Only ended up with a couple smaller pike. Got my first silver/blue pike which was very cool. Well here's some pics.          -Ben"
