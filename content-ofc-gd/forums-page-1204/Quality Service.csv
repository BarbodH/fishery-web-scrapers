79249,bowshep,2007-06-04 22:29:00,378,"On Sunday June 3 l went on a Fishing Charter with the team Up Scalers [We rock]. We used FISHMASTER CHARTERS. The early morning l had the first fish lost it   well same old same old. The Five of us went through our cycle 3-5 and then the weather started to change for the worst. Well the fish were not around,gone, like alians sucked them up. Now normaly you would start to get upset, you just spent money for this and l can get skunked on my own. Well Fishmaster kept everyones spirits up with the anticipation of fish but even l saw on the fish finder and the only thing it was telling me was the fish wern't home. All of a sudden a blip but the down rigger was to low Fishmaster jumps to the back and raises the line and with in a few minites we got it ""Fish on"" and l'm up Steve passes the rod to me and l lean back this has some size to it    reeled it in and had me self a 30"" laker   4""shy of my pb. Well we all got fish that day not many but all monsters and it was because of Steve. That man never gave up he hunted them down one at a time changing gear and the depth all the time his mate was halling assssssss too. l said it to him and now l will say it to you people Fishmaster is a class act. He understands that his clients are tobe happy and worked hard this day for us and not one of us left unhappy. Its really easy to have happy Clients when the fish are bitting and around its another thing to experiance real customer service. He had his CB on and every other captin on the water was begging for help one had only one fish in 5 hrs another had 2 in 6 hours, l herd 12 call signs on that radio. We on the other hand would have had 9 but me and my friend blew it. Fishmaster Charters is my go to guy when l fish lake O and l will send anyone of my friends to him. Thankyou so much for an amazing day even with mother nature against you. You are deffinetly a hunter. Peace Ken Ps Team post soon"

79807,tonyb,2007-06-05 18:34:00,1637," That is the right attitude to have!  Think about tournaments...someone, somewhere is onto the fish, regardless of the weather, and that speaks volumes.  Tony"
