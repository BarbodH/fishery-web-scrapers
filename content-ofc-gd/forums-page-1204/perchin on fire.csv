We started fishing some spots with no luck findin any fish so we went to anther spot were he had some luck before. Then as soon as we got boat control we couldint keep the perch off! double jumbos many times biggest was just over 12 inches. We couldint count how many smallies we got, man the fish were hungry! We had to keep a lot of small ones cus they were so hungry they took the hook deep. I had a blast out there with ya keith and we will do it again soon  sleded        "
