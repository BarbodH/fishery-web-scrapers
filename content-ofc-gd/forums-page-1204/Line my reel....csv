79575,Gerritt,2007-06-05 12:10:00,6129,Getting geared up to head up to Nipissing for the weekend! cant wait.. I have a new Quantum PTi that I need to get lined up for her maiden voyage up north...  Now the question is.....  Do I line her up with 20lb PowerPro and a floro leader?  Or  Do I Line her up with FireLine Crystal? <----any good reviews on this stuff?  Thanks in advance!  Gerritt.

79587,jediangler,2007-06-05 12:36:00,1923,I like the fireline crystal but have only used it in the 10lb test size so I can't comment on heavier sizes.
