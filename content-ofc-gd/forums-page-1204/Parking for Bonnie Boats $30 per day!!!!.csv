However, people should be aware of the crap that they leave behind. I have seen it so many times when i go to one of my favorite spots around the GTA and find empty Tim Horton cups, empty minnow boxes, cigarette packages, etc."
79140,icedude,2007-06-04 19:04:00,459,Too funny Rick--now there's a novel concept--30 skin$ to view the Falls!  all true PhotoZ!  good of you to make the time boatman to write that letter  Sled--have heard that rumour from a couple of sources now--looks like there may be truth to that rumour  Take a Kid Fishin!  ID1
79220,boatman,2007-06-04 21:01:00,350,"The letters I've received from council so far say that if you launch at Bonnie Boats you won't have to pay the $30, but everyone else will. Also, the restriction is only during the summer months."
79317,daisy_girl58,2007-06-04 23:43:00,116,"Say what you may, but clap your hands to da man who is pushing out alot of family owned businesses in Georgina and wanting control of all entries to Lake Simcoe!! Crates!  Lorissa"
78349,Hookset,2007-06-02 02:44:00,367,Any bets that there isn't a single fisherman on the Georgina Council ? I wonder what it must be like to screw people over just because you have no interest in something they enjoy doing. How do some people sleep at night ? Oh ya... Sorry....we're talking politicians here. You have to have a brain in order to have a conscience.  Hookset
78378,Guest lundboy,2007-06-02 10:13:00,0,"Yep this sucks...  but the precedence has already been set...  Orillia:  Charges $15 for launch at the Port of Orillia Park to Non-Residents, used to be free Toronto: Charges $2:00 extra for Non-Residents on top of entrance fees for attractions  It's a new method for the municipality politicians to suck money out of the people that don't vote them in, and they make their own voters feel special.  Since the McGuinty Government has now given the municipalities the authority to ""create local taxes""  just watch what happens.  Miller in Toronto is already scheming new ways to rape everyone in the 905 such as a $20 ""congestion tax"" for entering the city limits for outsiders.  This sort of thing is happening on a global scale (London, England for example).  This is just the beginning and I'm afraid we haven't seen anything yet."
78379,Fisherman,2007-06-02 10:29:00,7201,"Ya, I think Wasaga should put up toll roads to screw all the bums that make a mess of the May 24 weekend. At least that would pay for the clean up. And then they should put up one way turnstiles on the 400/401 and keep all the riff raff in Toronto... How about an IQ test for prospective mayors/counsellors/lackies/etc. Maybe an IQ test for voters, they seem to vote in all the idiots of society to positions of authority."
78380,Zamboni,2007-06-02 10:35:00,235,"Rumour is the new owners of Bonnie Boats pushed this thru, and were all thinking it would hurt their business. They suposedly get $10 of the parking fee and $25 of every illegal parking ticket?????.....that can't be true-sounds ridiculous that a private company would get money from parking fines. I can't see it but my buddies insist its true-can anyone verify that?"
78385,boatman,2007-06-02 11:47:00,350,Money from parking tickets doesn't sound right. I doubt that was part of the agreement.
78398,pikehunter,2007-06-02 13:54:00,1659,"If this is going to be the trend then I have one answer...""Anyone wanna buy a boat?"""
78425,Carp,2007-06-02 15:47:00,1488,"Boycott Bonnie Boats. The whole township of Georgina for that matter. I know I will. If you hit them in the wallet, they'll quickly realize their mistake."
78459,Tacklebuster,2007-06-02 21:14:00,303,"I wonder how long they will be in business.  And this is because they only want ""real tourists"", because fishermen are ""free loaders"".  This is one boycott that isn't going to take a lot of effort."
78490,ch312,2007-06-02 23:16:00,1590,"such a great idea for getting more business isnt it  i just got a boat a couple months ago but i already know where i wont be going. its about 1.5 hours to get to lake simcoe from my house. towing the boat it will likely be $20 gas to get there, $40 to park and launch, $10 for bait. $70 before i even hit the water? ya thats really gonna happen...  ill bet theres gonna be alot of ticked off fisherman that have no clue about this until they show up at bonnie boats..."
78747,hylite,2007-06-03 19:06:00,2,I am confused does the Town of Georgina pay for solely for the all the services in their town which includes the services to keep Lake Simcoe waters clean and accessible ; police services; road maintenance and the maintenance of the government dock or the regional taxes cover that. If regional taxes covers that would I be doubled taxed if I have to pay for the prviledge of using what I have already paid for? CONFUSED
78788,Photoz,2007-06-03 21:29:00,792,"Ever since Bonnie Boats made their docks off limits to shore anglers, I could see this coming. I suspect that what spurred such drastic action may have been the small minority of people who crowded the docks, urinated from them, hammered rod holders into them, left cigarette butts burning on them or squashed their burning butts out on the wood, leaving burn marks everywhere, left garbage all over the place, and damaged boats that were moored there! Plus the small parking area over at the pier was littered with garbage & often broken glass, people arrived to fish on Saturday & Sunday morning, before daylight, slamming down tailgates, and doors, shouting, and blaring loud music. I suspect the local councillors have been getting an earful from their constituents for several years, which brought about the first move of banning fishing from the docks. When this didn't work, then they likely did what their constituents demanded, and took even more harsh action. Lets face it, WE, the outsiders do not vote these guys in, or out, the local people do, so, if they piss ALL of us outsiders off, they don't care . . . .    they'll surely get voted back in by those who DEMANDED they 'DO SOMETHING!' That is, unless the local businesses start to feel the pinch, and bring their own delegations to council meetings! Like somebody said . . . . .    pretty soon Lakes Simcoe & Couchiching will be, for all intents & purposes, PRIVATE . . . . .     or at least not affordible to those of us who cannot afford to pay $30.00 to park LEGALLY, or up to $60.00 to park illegally!"
78791,wmshaw,2007-06-03 21:46:00,42,"Well, I will not lauch from there and it is only a few more minutes to Sibbald Point Prov. Park which only costs $11.00 to park and launch for the day.   A few miles more up at Virginia beach, you can park and launch for $15.00.  Good luck to the folks at Bonnie Boats as I thinking of using their lauch to go out whitefishing.  I will be going elsewhere now.  Bill"
79103,fishnsled,2007-06-04 17:05:00,3520,"Just thought I'd had one more rumour I heard about Bonnie Boats.  I've heard from a couple different resources that the plan for the new owners is to put up condos where the marina is now.  Remind you of different location? (Tip of the Bay Motel).  Just a rumour but to have heard it from a couple of different people.  If this is true, you have to wonder if they are really concerned about losing our money."
