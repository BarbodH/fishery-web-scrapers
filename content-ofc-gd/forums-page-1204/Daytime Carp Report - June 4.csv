79174,ccmtcanada,2007-06-04 19:51:00,7971,"My day started at 5:45am.  I got up to go to work.  There were light showers outside...just as forecast.  I hopped in the car at 6:30 and started the trek into Toronto.  At around Morningside Ave, my wipers stopped...just like that...in the middle of the windshield!!  I could barely see the road!!!  I got off at the next exit and safely parked in a parking lot, and then called home.  Bly checked the radar and it didn't look like it was going to stop raining anytime soon, so I called CAA.  I had them tow me home.  We've had problems with the wiper motor before, so I knew where to start working.  After removing the motor I found out that it was finally blown.  I call a parts place and they have to order it.  I then decided it was time to leave this mess....   I checked the time...perfect for having a bite to eat...walking the little one to school, and then out to a local fishing hole for some carp!!! LOL.  Bly and I packed up the car and got there at 1pm.  We had about 2 hours to fish.  We were hoping to have a daytime report....007 had requested one, so we hoped this one would include a fish or two.  There were a few others there, so we setup our rods and cast out there.  There was someone in the spot we wanted to fish, so we had to make due with where we were.  Well...no line bumps, no action, no nothing!!!  We chatted with a bunch of classic car owners from North Bay...they were lost and needed directions to the local Princess Auto.  They asked what we were fishing for...Bly said ""big carp!""...they guys yelled out ""Attagirl!!!"". LOL  Anyhow, the guy who was in our preferred spot left, so we moved over and cast our lines.  About 10 minutes later, my line is pulled...fish on!  I had cast wayyy out there, so this one took about 15 minutes to land.  Here it is...a 29"", 13 pounder.   Time was running out...we had to leave at 3pm.  I decided to try get some positive karma by getting a trash bag and picking up litter along the banks. (or I ran out of chum...LOL).  As I'm doing this, I look up and see Bly fighting a fish!!!  She had 10 minutes to land the fish...we had to get our little one from school!!  Here was her fish...30"", weighing in at 12 pounds.   Well, hopefully our other car will break down tomorrow so I can fish again...LOL.  It's true...the fish look brighter in the daylight...dont get me wrong...still ugly, but brighter....haha."

79442,ccmtcanada,2007-06-05 02:19:00,7971," You figured me out Joey...I told her 10 minutes, but actually had around 20....LOL.  She still landed the thing....dang!!!  I'll have to get some sabotage tips from you"

79481,MJL,2007-06-05 02:57:00,2427,Great write-up! Too bad about the car...I may have to join you one day to learn a few new tips and tricks.
79513,wolfville,2007-06-05 03:58:00,396,"Great report, that's positive thinking -- when car breaks, go fishing !"
79516,Carp,2007-06-05 04:14:00,1488,Beauty carp Cliff. Thanks for sharing the report
79529,Photoz,2007-06-05 09:12:00,792,"Day or night . . .    ya STILL get 'em!! A bit easier in daylight I'd think, ya can see where they're going . . . .    I can't even imagine bringing one in when it's pitch dark! I'm hoping to squeeze in a trip between medical appointments (hopefully this Saturday,) to hit either Port Hope or Hammietown. I MIGHT even go back to basics . . .     a few kernels of corn on a hair rig . . .    no feeder or groundbait, and get REAL stingy with the 'chum!' Might even just boil it plain . . . .    what worked well last year has produced lousy results THIS year!"
79604,Mike the Pike,2007-06-05 12:55:00,3421,WTG Cliff and Carol you were having a bad start to the day and made the best of it by catching some nice Carp.What a way to make up for a bad morning.  MTP
79614,ccmtcanada,2007-06-05 13:03:00,7971," Get tips from me?? More like the other way around!! LOL.  Most of what I try out there comes from this board...so I've already been soaking up knowledge from guys like you.  Would still love to hook up sometime though...with you and a few others, to get a look at your setups...not that I'm going to buy any of it....LOL"
