P.S. Please don't make fun of the belly and man boobs"
79343,Clampet,2007-06-05 00:35:00,1947,Good sized fish!
79347,Sinker,2007-06-05 00:38:00,8692,That sucker looks like a whitefish....no?  Nice area up there....pickeral river I assume?  Sinker
79348,irishfield,2007-06-05 00:38:00,26272,Looked like a great day on the water!
79350,brifishrgy,2007-06-05 00:42:00,559, Looks like a whitefish to me too
79355,express168,2007-06-05 00:46:00,327,"Well I don't really fish for suckers or whitefish, could be a whitefish. It was very slimy and hard to hold so I went with the assumption of a sucker. Either way all the fish swam away for another day. If it is a Whitefish thanks for the correction and that is another species to add to my caught list."
79359,Sinker,2007-06-05 00:50:00,8692,slimey and hard to hold sounds like a whitey to me.....sure looks like one in the picture.  Nice fish regardless of what it is.....
79370,ccmtcanada,2007-06-05 01:03:00,7971,Nice pics...great to see all the reports rolling in now.  I already go out too much as it is...seeing all these reports is going to make me want to get a boat even more...LOL.  That moose shot was pretty cool!
79385,hydro,2007-06-05 01:12:00,24, You forgot to mention smelly!
79401,Beats,2007-06-05 01:29:00,543,"yeah, that is definately a whitefish.  And a nice sized one at that."
79402,KyleM,2007-06-05 01:30:00,218,Those pike must have tasted great.  Nice fish.
79412,Carp,2007-06-05 01:47:00,1488,Looks like a whitey to me too. Nice shooting.
79416,Krisco,2007-06-05 01:51:00,67,Where did you stay Express? Were you on the river?
79425,vance,2007-06-05 02:05:00,719,Used to be a lot of white fish in the area but were over fished and you don't see many now.the pic of the moose must have been taken just down stream from wilson lake on the river.and that was my smokercraft at white birches.  vance
79684,express168,2007-06-05 15:37:00,327,"Krisco I stayed at White Birches resort in Port Loring, nice people and decent facilities, I have stayed there on 4 different occasions. The whitefish( my mistake for thinking it was a sucker) and moose pictures came from along the Pickeral River, the pike are from a bay on Duck Lake. Kyle I couldn't tell you how the pike tasted as they were released after a quick picture. My partner had a fish on at the same time so thats why I am not holding them in the pics. There were quite a few  smallmouth caught while slowly trolling trying to find some walleye but all were quickly released without pics. All in all it sure beat getting caught up in that fire near Onaping."
