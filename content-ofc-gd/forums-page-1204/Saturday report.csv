The weather was killing me ( by 10 am was 28ÂºC, no wind, no single cloud), I've felt like floating on the frying pan   . Since my last trip to this lake, what a change, lots of weeds and very clear water (opposite to my last trip). Visited my ""go to"" spots but not even a sniff. Went to other productive spots ( usually later in the season) and I was chased by a LMBs guarding nests. I'm not small, but 5-6 lb can be ""intimidating""  , I've left in a hurry. It was so hot and humid that I've decided to finish my day early  . On the way to boat launch (on trolling motor, to delay the skunk as much as possible ) I was dragging  a white spinner bait just for the sake of it . Then I have a hit, after short fight I've landed 28' pike. Got my camera ready, pulled pike from the water and .  .... my camera has no mem card   ( still in the reader, after uploading pictures from my trip ). Well, I will take a picture next time. My favoured lake did not disappointed me again (I was never skunked there)"
