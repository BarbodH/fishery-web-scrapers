When you first turn it on you can barely see the display.Even if I turn the contrast up as high as it goes it is not very bright. I have checked the voltage at the finder and it is over 12 volts. Also disconnected the transducer and speed connections and no change. Disconnected other accessories and still no cahnge. The fish finder is less than a year old and started doing this late last fall.  Any help be appreciated."
