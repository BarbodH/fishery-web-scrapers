This applies to anything I have in the classifieds as well....let me know as soon as possible.  Wednesday afternoon I head for Toronto to attend #1 daughters grad @ 9am Thursday. From there I'm hitting BPS for a few things, grabbing my boat at home and heading North for the summer.   ..and yes Sweety..the big net to contain Tybo is already on the list !"
