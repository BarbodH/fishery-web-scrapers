78719,spoonman,2007-06-03 16:02:00,103,"This week I fished both Pike and Salmon in Lake Ontario. The Salmon are slowly starting to show up on the north shore.  There is a mixture of Rainbows, Coho and Chinook Salmon out there right now.  The keys to my success have been using a variety of my favorite Spoons. Key colors have been Green and Silver and Black/ Silver. Flashers and A-tom-mik tournament flys have also been hot.  Here is a picture of a client with a nice 23lb Chinook    I managed to get out with a good friend of mine for a few hours of piking on Lake Ontario. Unfortunately a huge storm forced us off the water early. Always better too be safe then sorry.  Here are a couple pictures from the  pike outing.       The keys to my success were twitch baits such as Rapalasâ€™ Husky Jerk, and X rap.  Off for Musky this week Cheers AL www.alsadventures.ca"
