I know I'm in the middle of some solid fishing grounds, but i've never fished the area. What are my prospects within an hour's drive? I'm more of a pike/muskie guy, but I'm also up for lakers or 'eyes if they're available. Cheers"
79088,fishergirl72,2007-06-04 16:39:00,455,"Hey dougliano, most of the lakes in that area have bass and lake trout but if you go to some of the smaller lakes around that area you will find lots of splake.   Good luck on your adventure"
79159,Smokey,2007-06-04 19:27:00,1278,What lake are you going to be staying on and i'll try and point you in a direction close to the cottage. Your right about being in the middle of some great fishing up there.
79250,John Bacon,2007-06-04 22:29:00,3277,"Baptiste has both pike and muskie.  I haven't fished Bird Lake (just outside of Birds Creek) for about 10 or 12 years; but it had plenty of pike when I did fish it.  There is an MNR office in Bancroft, they should be able to provide a list of stocked lakes, there are many lakes in the area that are stocked with trout.  I don't believe that walleye are very plentiful in the area.  Although both Baptiste and Elephant do have some.  There are also plenty of bass lakes if you are interested."
79257,dougliano,2007-06-04 22:41:00,3,"Thanks for the pointers guys. The lake we're on is Trout or 'Faraday' Lake, I'm told it's stocked with trout but didn't hear what specie. Are muskies open up there yet? Would mind tossing some bucktails somewhere."
79274,DrPhil,2007-06-04 23:04:00,30,"Baptiste and Elephant have a good muskie population.  Not many lakes in that area with muskie.  If you want to go over to Haliburton there are several lakes that have muskie.  Both Elephant and Baptiste are loaded with small pike with some over 40 inches.  You you are also in a top rockhound area.  Many, many minerals and gems found around Bancroft.  The Faraday mines produced uranium but have been closed for years."
79548,Smokey,2007-06-05 11:04:00,1278,Dr. Phil gave you two good suggestions for both muskies and pike same two as I would have suggested. Also the York river can produce some great pike as well. Almost all of the lakes have a good bass population in that area.
