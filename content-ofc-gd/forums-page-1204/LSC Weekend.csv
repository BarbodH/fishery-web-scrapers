79064,LeXXington,2007-06-04 16:08:00,1928,"Well it was the annual Work Boys weekend trip for some great fishing and jokes...  Every year we venture out on Lake St Clair for some fishing the main reason is when you get a fish you really never know what it is until it hits the surface.  Talk about hot! And no it was not the fishing, We arrived the first day to ""ZERO"" wind and super heat. Not the best conditions but we managed a few perch, a walleye and a Sheepshead.  From Friday to Sunday we would get on the water by 7am to a little breeze and good fishing. By 10am the wind died as did the fishing. We always stayed out for a couple of hours but the bites were far and few between. Then we jumped in the 80F water to cool off.  Lots of perch, bass, pike and rock bass.  At 5pm each day the wind kicked up as the storms blew around but never provided rain, Only got out one night for 2 hours before we got blown off the water  One kicker of the trip is some ""JERK""!!!!!! Backed into my trailer while we were fishing and smashed my rear light, hit it hard enough to bend the steel completely around we tried to bend it back by hand but looks like it needs heat and a sledge hammer.  No note, no sorry! No message at the office check in.  Ahhh next trip is LakeAir !!! So lots of time to fix it.     "

79084,irishfield,2007-06-04 16:32:00,26272,Great stuff Paul!  It's unfortunate that some people think that's what bumpers are for. Hit something..change gears. Just be glad your boat wasn't on it at the time! That's always my fear...some day dreamer running into the back at an intersection.
79091,mattyk,2007-06-04 16:40:00,2110,"nice pictures. I tell ya, there is no respect these days. People are so rude!!! Sorry about the bad experience."
79128,Joey,2007-06-04 18:18:00,9122,"Great report Paul, nice looking pickerel there.  There's always one jackdonkey out there at all times it seems eh.  Sorry about your trailer.  Karma will come back and bite him in the you know what!!!  Joey"
79132,SlowPoke,2007-06-04 18:41:00,2984,"Hot is not the word on Saturday... we washed muskie lures for 10 hours, covered probably 30 miles of water and nothing. We had trouble marking weeds let alone fish.  Sorry about the trailer... I always cringe when I see a guy struggle to launch a boat and when he finally gets it into the water I know he's headed to park beside my truck.  -Brian"
79143,tbayboy,2007-06-04 19:09:00,1497,"Nice fish Paul, sorry to see the trailer get hit, at least it's fixable and no boat damage but still would it have been so much trouble to leave a note and a number, some people I guess"
79147,Smokey,2007-06-04 19:14:00,1278,Great fish and too bad about the trailer. You think they could have at least left a sorry note.  Thanks for the report
79647,fishindevil,2007-06-05 14:43:00,6254,"Awesome fishing trip lexx,..  ...to bad some idiot had to smash into you,  well those people are everywhere.....at least you caught lots of fish so it makes it a little better,thanks for sharing,great pics as well....cheers"
79664,Zib,2007-06-05 15:04:00,369,Nice report.  Did you fish in Ontario or Michigan waters or both? What areas did you fish?
79678,LeXXington,2007-06-05 15:31:00,1928,"We were only in the Ontario waters,  no too far out of the main drag.  Each day we just followed the pack of boats., 13' of water was the key in the heat.  We just putted along with worms and bang,  There were a couple times you could not cast without the perchie stripping you clean then it would suddenly stop as something bigger moved it thats one of the times I hooked into my pike.  No muskie caught that I could see boy there were there  if you want more specifics pm me  can't give all the lurkers the goods"
79790,Zib,2007-06-05 17:54:00,369, Thanks for the info. I mainly fish Michigan waters & only fish Ontario waters in the fall. I'll be out there this weekend hunting some musky.
