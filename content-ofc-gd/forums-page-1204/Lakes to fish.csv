I'm looking to go fishing tomorrow and was wondering if anyone has any good lakes that are good for Pike right now?  I'm not looking for specific spots, just the lakes in general.  I've got a 14ft boat and looking around 2 hrs from Toronto.  If anyone has any ideas of some good lakes to try tomorrow I would be thankful for your input.  Cheers!!!"

79237,Bcrdi911,2007-06-04 21:48:00,10,Never been to any of those lakes so I'll look into them.  Thank you!!  I was thinking of Lake St. John or Gloucester Pool.  Has anyone been there lately?

79381,Bcrdi911,2007-06-05 01:09:00,10,I've been to that one last year and it was pretty good.  Lot's of small fish I found.  Very shallow as well.  Thank you though!!
