77791,nautifish,2007-05-31 22:39:00,1416,Good afternoon ofners. I know i have not been around much but with visitors from europe and work work work not to much to report in the fishing department of late.  Just had my x hubby with his brother & son my nephew over for two weeks visiting from the uk so been busy entertaining them as it was they're 1st ever  trip to canada.   Well here is a short video clip of a day out with my 10 yr old nephew who was just over for a visit from the UK. He landed his 1st ever fish. It was a fun afternoon and great that i managed to get him into some fish being as it was his 1st time. I think i have him hooked lol. Set him up with his 1st ever rod & reel which he has taken home so am hopeing he will put it too good use and keep me updated on his fishing trips back over in the UK. They have planned on visiting again next yr so am looking at renting a house boat for a week and taking him up north fishing. So that should be alot of fun and something too look forward too.  here is the video nothing more i love than to see a young kid having so much fishing.  http://s81.photobucket.com/albums/j207/Amo...1steverfish.flv

78564,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-03 02:33:00,1183,That was great.  Glad I came back to watch the video...thought maybe there was something wrong with my computer when I couldn't view it before.  Anyhow...you yourself impressed me.  I have yet to take a hook out of a fish and here you did it without pliers....I am impressed.   lol
79657,nautifish,2007-06-05 14:59:00,1416,"Well thankyou Chromehen, But really no need to be impressed that hook was hooked barely into the top lip so easy peasy to remove.  Glad you enjoyed the video and thankyou.  Nauti."
