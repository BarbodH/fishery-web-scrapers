All I got to say is those northern fish sure are smarter then the ones down here, : I started the day on Pen and found some nice weed beds and tried some hookless plastics to locate but nothing happening.No problem,I was just looking for quality water,and with the help from our member here it was alitle easier.   Thanks again. After a few hours of blasting around finding some go to spots,I headed up to Vernon and found what I was looking for.Nice shallows with drop off into weeds. Threw the plastic out couple dozen times and had 3 qauity hauls and even got to see one nice ten+ surface with it. Ok I got my morning spot. Spend a few more hours trying other areas but nothing but bass attacks. These lakes hold a nice bass population,which we found out when hooks were involved the next day.Pop nailed a 6+smallie.  So now it,s game day and we meet up with some friends,spend the morining having a good chat,Les showing me some new product that is awesome BTW. Blast off time and were 3rd off and this is where pop gets his first lesson of HANG ON.   Were heading right where I said, everything is going well until we go from third to 4,5,6,7,8 man those 250,s sure can fly by ya.LOL  We arrive at our spot and there are 4 boats there already,no woories,we keep our distance and work the area until an opening then we move in. Pop get a hit fish on,dang bucket. Throw that pink sluggo with the hook wide open,but nothing.Very frustating. No one in the area was getting them,so I dont know what happen,but today I figured out it,s got to be an afternoon bite area. Thats my story and Im sticking to it.  :P,Move around,pop put on a Mepps fury and he has a huge 40 incher follow to the boat. Man that would of made our day. We work the area for an hour more but nothing. Ok lets try some other spots.Nothing but buckets.After 3 hours it,s time to head to Pen. I figured the way the wind was blowing the two weed beds I found would be holing as it was pushing right into them.  We arrive at the first bed and it was game on.3 fish in 1/2 hour. Nice relief to get some fish into the well and get on the score card.  Work the bed for another hour and nothing but buckets and a perch  :.Head over to the check in station measure and live release our catch,I thought the limit was 18 inches but it was 20 so we let one go so 2 on the score card,and off we go to the next bed that is also favoring the wind. Get there, wham pops got his third.Yes another keeper. Continue on for another hour and again buckets and that 6+ smallie.Ok time to finish up is near,so we give Fairy Lake a try but nothing.  We head in hand in our ticket for the day,3 fish was our take for the day.We did land 6 but only 3 measured up. We will definitly be there again next year,good time and great people.  All fish were caught on X-RAPS. Now I need to go and buy 4 new ones to replace the tooth ripped ones.    Congrats to Les Culp Jr for the big fish. Nice cash haul bud.  No fish pic,s but did take some of the area. Lots of history there. The canal s show age and a great past.

79234,Smokey,2007-06-04 21:40:00,1278,Thanks for the report. You did all right finishing right in the middle of the pack. The one you had to release really wouldn't have got you much farther up anyways.  Good Luck next outing.
79238,solopaddler,2007-06-04 21:52:00,8605,"Cool report, too bad you couldn't that big fish to hit! Still, that's proof that the bigguns are still in there."
79251,Terry,2007-06-04 22:31:00,14456,sounds like a good weekend and a nice warm up for the bass tourney season..........nicely done
79256,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-04 22:40:00,0,Great report. Cant wait until one day I get into tournaments. Just curious. I've noticed many large Pike are caught trolling. Are you allowed to troll in a tournament?
79260,misfish,2007-06-04 22:49:00,29133,You can troll JB just cant be anchored or tied up to a structure. We seen some guys doing it.
79262,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-04 22:53:00,0,Really??? Can't be anchored or tied down? I never knew that. Thanks Brian.
79282,misfish,2007-06-04 23:22:00,29133," Dont forget,,,,,,,,,NO LIVE BAIT.LOL My pop was saying this looks like a great place for a minnow and a bobber,I got a good laugh out of that.Ah old school .   Thanks Smokey,To me it,s not about winning, but if I do thats a bonus,as I am learning even at 42.Took my first year doing the pro/am to come to reality on that.I know jack compared to these guys that do it everyday,but I,ll take what I learn and take it to the next level.  Terry,only 2 more weeks."
