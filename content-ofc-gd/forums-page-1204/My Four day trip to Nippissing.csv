I don't get the oppurtunity to go to Nippising all that often so it was something that I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was nice to get out with my buddy from BPS again along with one of his buddies.  The weather was spectacular but the fishing was slow. It was slow for every person at camp.  But we managed to salvage the week on Saturday (the last day of the trip) catching numerous walleye and a bunch of big pike(sorry no pics of them). Here are a couple pics.    Ain't Nippising beautiful   The elusive Gar Pike making the whole trip worth while.     Mmm finally some walleye.    A pic of me with a beautiful golden 3 pounder live released to be caught another day.  All in all a beautiful trip and it was nice to get out."

79000,Smokey,2007-06-04 14:39:00,1278,Thanks for the pics and report. The last pic sure is a nice fish.
79011,bpsbassman,2007-06-04 14:49:00,941,"Looks like you ate well. Very cool pic of the Gar Pike. How come no pics of the big Pike??? Thanks for the report Luigi.  Even when you're not catching, any trip out with Jay would be worth its weight in gold for knowledge."
79017,fishersquige,2007-06-04 14:51:00,52,Yep yep you got that right about Jay and lol the big pike weren't caught by me lol thats why but nevertheless I should have taken those pics.
79079,huey graphite,2007-06-04 16:26:00,362,In which corner of Nipissing were you? I just got back for Deep Water Point/Greening Bay area. Fishing was tough for us as well until Saturday evening. Will post report on another thread.
79086,Bernie,2007-06-04 16:36:00,3190,Hey FS. I think I seen you guys around the Bay on Saturday when painting my boathouse. I better put up an OFC sign on my boathouse.Went out Friday afternoon for a fishing trip with the guys in my shop (just played a little hookey for fishing). Took a little bit to locate them but when we did we nailed them good. 25 ft of water on the flats feeding for shad larvae.
79093,fishergirl72,2007-06-04 16:42:00,455,It looks like you got some pretty nice fish there and yes it is very beautiful there! Even though the fishing was slow you were so lucky just to get away for everything instead of being stuck in the city! Way to go!!!
79097,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-04 16:49:00,2585,looks like you guys ha da great time.  Nice fish!  And yes the nip is a beauty of a lake!  Cheers!
