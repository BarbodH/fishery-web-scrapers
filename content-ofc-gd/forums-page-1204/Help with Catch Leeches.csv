79336,mittzu,2007-06-05 00:28:00,48,Asking all you veteran fisherman out there for help. I would like to know how or what is the best way to catch your own leeches? Any and All input would help.
79349,Clampet,2007-06-05 00:41:00,1947,"I heard dog food in a can punched with holes. You have to get up early the next morning to check the ""trap"" as they'll all swim out after the Sun gets up."
79358,Clampet,2007-06-05 00:49:00,1947,"Oh, try this link:  http://www.baitontario.com/baoinfo/leech_t...ing2004_ppt.pdf"
79361,Sinker,2007-06-05 00:53:00,8692,"find a swampy creek with slow moving water, set a fish carcass in there on a rope. Put it in at night, and check it after a few hours.....if there's leeches, it will be full of them.  I don't have great success with the leeches I catch tho.....they're usually the red bellied ones, and they latch on to you much better than the ones you buy in the bait stores......I don't think the ones in the bait shops are blood suckers....  Sinker"
79389,FinS,2007-06-05 01:17:00,463,"get yourself a coffee or tobbaco can punch some small holes maybe 1/8"" piece of liver in a ziplock back with holes in the bag toss it in a spot where there is alot of fathead minnows check it before sunrise and u should be in buisness  note u are only allowed 1 leech trap per fishing licence which cannot exceed 17 inches in any way  works for me everytime"
79392,FinS,2007-06-05 01:18:00,463,  They are called ribbon leeches
79394,Muskieman,2007-06-05 01:18:00,2472,"EH!  I do it all the time , here's what you do... #1 take a 6x10 "" peice of tin, body metal , aluminum ,, metal of some kind 'boot as thick as a can of ravioli..  #2 fold it in half , so you have a folded peice that's  3x10  2x thick.  #3  punch a little hole on both corners , thru both thicknesses of the metal.  #4 punch another hole at one end of the fold.  #5 attach 15-20 feet of good fishing line to the hole in the fold #4 [ i recommend 50 -80 lb]  #6 now stuff your sheetmetal  sandwich with liver.  #7 take twist ties and put them in holes #3 to keep your sandwich [ enveloppe] shut. take care to not sinch it upp to tight ..leave room for the leeches.!!  #8 put whole apparatus in the freezer til it's time to use.  ////////////////  try a pond or a creek. marshy areas are the best up here,, small lakes with muddy bottoms are weeeds are usually pretty good.  Good Luck Leechin'  Muskieman!!          ZZZZIIINNNG!"
