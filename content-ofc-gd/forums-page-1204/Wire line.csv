79727,fishindevil,2007-06-05 16:38:00,6254,"it would be much better to use leadcore line,or snap-weights,also you can use dipsey divers,wire is not to much good for eyes the ways i said above are alot deadlier..for suspending walleyes,and as well with using wire it is highly visible ,with all the other methods you can use a floro set-up........cheers"
79729,Dutch,2007-06-05 16:40:00,831,"Wire line is generally used to get deeper.  On smaller lakes, there is probably not much use for it.  Walleye generally aren't found so deep that wire line would be needed.  Maybe a dipsy diver for trolling deeper.  If you are having trouble getting down deep I guess you could use it....but I don't think it's common."

The fish were easy to spot on a good depthfinder, getting a lure to run deep enough was the problem. There are other methods if you have a depthfinder that will show suspended fish. A jig(heavy) and minnow or crawler and a slow drift, driftsock.  A jigging spoon may work, like a Hopkins shorty tipped with a crawler or minnow, even jigging a lure like a Heddon sonar. The wire is probably easier in wide open waters."
