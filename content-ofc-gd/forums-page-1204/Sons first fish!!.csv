79037,Landlocked,2007-06-04 15:13:00,171,"Thought I'd share our special father & son moment...we left the boat in the garage to throw a few spoons in the river at Grandpas house and hooked into this ""monster""  He did as well as a 2.5yr old can do to reel it in, with a little help from Dad  .  I've never seen a kid so excited until it came time to hang onto it for the photo op. and found it was ""too slimy Dad"" LOL!  He was happy it swam away for us to catch another day.  Pic quality is not great due to using a cell but you'll get the idea.  "
