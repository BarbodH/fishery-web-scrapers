We fished for five days and I averaged about 25 pike a day and good or bad(since we were not fishing for them), 50 bass a day.  I'm not sure if the bass population has exploded or we just hit it at the right time but every where we usually catch pike there were large numbers of bass.  I almost felt bad but we were having too much fun.  I will post pictures later this week but we caught some very nice pike.  Friday afternnoon before memorial day in one spot I caught 16 in less than an hour and four of them were 8lbers.  The biggest I boated was a 9lber but can't tell you how many in the 6-8lb range.   I hope this is the beginning of a come back for the pike on the st. lawrence!!!"
