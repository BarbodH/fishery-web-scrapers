79254,Zib,2007-06-04 22:34:00,369, Just stay single.
79259,Moosebunk,2007-06-04 22:47:00,3970,"I used to fish about once every 2 weeks.  Then I got a job and a girlfriend and two kids...  now, life is pretty much this through the year....  about 150 days of work. about 150 days with the family. about 65-75 days fishing.  Math is a little off, but it's give or take."
79281,Tinman,2007-06-04 23:21:00,376,"I actually fish more now that I have kids, as my daughter loves to fish and is always asking ot go fishing!"
79311,ccmtcanada,2007-06-04 23:40:00,7971,"Hmmm...when I was a kid (under 10), I fished maybe 4 times a year...only at a friend of my parents cottage.  Then when I was a teenager I fished maybe 2 times.  In my 20's I fished one time.  When I got married, bought a house and had a child we didn't fish at all until last year.  Now, with our 15 year old being a built in babysitter, bly and I get out about 4 to 5 times a week...LOL"
79360,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-05 00:51:00,1183,"When I was a kid (5 years old) standing on the dock in Mattawa, Ont...I got a fish hook in the head.  Turned me off of fishing for the next 40 years.  aaahhhhh YES...Mattawa,,,now there's a scenic place to fish.  (Just talking to myself)  If you can get out...do it...if you can't...well you can't...maybe tomorrow...just don't blame the kids, don't blame the wife..."
79424,Riparian,2007-06-05 02:04:00,269,All of my friends who got married and had kids dont have time to go fishing any more. Makes me bitter just thinking about it.
79511,Danubian,2007-06-05 03:51:00,65,"When I was single, I was fishing whenever I felt like going fishing. Not too often, not too much, but I was going.  Then, when I met her, we were fishing together, almost weekly, and she seemed quite enthusiastic about, except for removing the fish from hook or cleaning it. It was great times and she always caught the largest one. I tought it as a good sign. I still remeber how happy she was when I bought her own fishing rod and spinner, on her BDay.  Marriage came along, and all of a sudden fishing became a big ""no-no!"": too much money, too much time wasted, why don't you learn instead to install hardwood flooring or renovate the master bathroom? (I'm a freaking computer dude, bunny. The fact that you saw me once planting a tree, or fixing the fence doesn't make me Mr Handy Man, 'mkay?)  Today, I fish an average of 5 times a week; that says all about my marriage, I guess  ...  Little piece of advice - when the better half tries to rob this little hapiness from you, be reasonable and tell her that a vice always gets replaced by another: you're ready to give up fishing for say...humm... gambling?... or womanizing? If she's smart, she'll buy you a new set of lures. Fishing lures."
79589,Mike the Pike,2007-06-05 12:38:00,3421,"Ya marriage slowed down the angling for some years but now its coming back into full swing.When the kids were young it was hard to get away as the diaper stage came to an end things got easier.I take 4 to 5 long weekends per year and the wife is cool with it, 2 trips in May.She flipped when I payed $5000 for my first boat but really flipped over what I paid for my Lund .She has calmed down since the kids come out with Dad.  The great thing is my 8 year old son is into fishing bigtime he endures 12 hour days with ease.He is almost as crazy about it as me and sometimes outfishes his old man.  There are days when I visit my Dads camp in Lancaster Ontario 3hrs fishing of the dock with my three kids non stop action and I have to tell the kids I have had enough.Non stop taking fish off there lines rebaiting the hooks and picture taking believe me my Rod just sits there on the ground.  Now that my kids are 8,10 and 12 fishing trips are great.  My wife is easy going as long as I am up to date on my to do list.Like someone says comprimise is the key.  During the week is not very possible due to soccer 4 nights a week but sometimes I get out for the evening.  Camping trips for me now have to include fishing ,from shore boat or canoe as long as I can get out.  So for me its just getting better I am just trying to figure out how to tell her that I want a new boat something more equipped  and more$$$$$$$$.  Great thread.Mike the Pike"
79619,ricoboxing,2007-06-05 13:10:00,398,"when im with the family, i can't wait to get away and be on the water. when im on the water, i can't wait to get home and be with the family.  man im gettin soft!"
79632,bbnotty,2007-06-05 14:00:00,93,"Guess i am lucky, when i was single i fishing 4/5 times a week then i got married and that fell off to maybe 1 a week ( hmmmm, oh ya fishing    )  since the kids love to fish, i fish more now, soooo great time spent with my kids and get to fish too. win win.  bb"
79674,duber,2007-06-05 15:28:00,220,"Well I fished constantly when I was a kid.I would spend the summers with my grandfather at his trailer on Kennebec lake and I was in my canoe all day every day.When I got old enough to work , money  beer and girls took a huge bite out of my fishing time.Fishing was something I done once in a while and usally involved beer and girls.Then I got married to a great women like fishergirl.I had to narrow down my hobbies and intrests as I was into way too much.So I narrowed it down to fishing and hunting.I now fish alot and have kids that love to go out as well.My wife dosen't tell me I can't do this or I have to do that.But I also don't skip out on important stuff with the kids or her.She doesn't care what I buy as long as the bills are paid and the kids have what they need.So I would have to say I got luck and landed a good woman.  I do more fishing now than ever.  Wes"
79714,LeXXington,2007-06-05 16:22:00,1928,"LOL, I had fishing put into the marrige contract.  I had been fishing since I was 5, my wife gets sea sick at red lobester so she hates it. Compromise one day family one day fishing  After our first kid, I went every 2 weeks one day and have stuck roughly to that schedule roughly ever since.  When our second was under negotiation I said, I still need to have my decompress time.. took a couple months of thinking but she agreed.  So far so good,. now the next issue will be when all the kids come fishing with me  that could be considered a family day"
79085,steve_paul,2007-06-04 16:33:00,658,"I am lucky, I am fishing more now with kids than ever before.  Of course they are older - 15 & 13 - but both love it too so it is great family time together being on the water.  As they grow and show interest in it, bring them along.  Don't force it on them but if they love it you always have a great fishing partner handy.  Course buying tackle for 3 people sucks but I can always blame new purchases on them as well."
79100,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-04 16:54:00,2585,i guess im opposite.  when i was a teenager i fished everyday.  when i got older i slowed down as responsbility kicked in.  Now i am married and have a 1 year old and fish way more then i did five years ago.  The main reason is my in laws are up in north bay and telling me i can go fishing is a great way to get me to go visit!  lol  CHeers!
79104,solopaddler,2007-06-04 17:06:00,8605,"Nope, marriage and kids hasn't changed things much for me, although fishergirl72 hit the nail on the head when she mentioned compromise. That's what it's all about with my wife and I."
79112,fisher,2007-06-04 17:26:00,451,"Fished a lot before I got married.  Once married, with the new house, I was lucky to get out once every month.  But now that my son is 3 years old  , he has become a perfect partner to go fishing with.  How can the wife get upset when she sees her son (and husband) come home with such a big smile on his face (of course that is after he wakes up from the ride back home).   Now we try to have an outing at least once a week."
79113,OhioFisherman,2007-06-04 17:30:00,6623,"Dad started us off pretty young, I probably had a stick with a hook and bobber on it around 3 years old at the swimming hole catching bluegills and chubs. First real fishing trip was like a 5 year old birthday present to us from dad, and nothing could have been more welcome.  First trip to Ontario in 1957, a family thing, a cottage on Beaver Lake near Quinte somewhere, mom, dad, 3 boys and one in the oven and a family friends family. Clean water and it was like 50 feet from the cabin, swimming trunks? too much time, underware is good! nothing to hide!  Two of my brothers my dad and me hit it hard, my older brother never developed the fever. Very few of our vacations were anywhere but Ontario, my older brother joined the navy right out of high school so the rest of us would pack up and head north. Didn`t take much to make us happy, decent weather, and water!  Did a lot of fishing around here, but short trips a day or two. Some tournament bass fishing in other states and here, Ohio doesn`t really have a lot of places to rent cabins on the water and not really a lot of places I enjoyed here, it was just fishing.  My first wife went to Ontario once with us, she didn`t like it(bye!). We did the family trip every summer for like 25 years and a guy trip(family and friends, close ones) most Septembers. My daughters(older ones) were nervous about going to Ontario the first trip, LOL no Tv? Well ya there is but nothing much you would watch, and I don`t drive 500 miles to watch TV! they got into it, other kids at the camp, fishing, swimming, boating, cooks outs, campfires, what else do you need?  Had all the kids and my wife to a lake in New York several times for vacations/tournaments, sort of a little Canada, a primer for a longer trips that never happened.  LOL all my girls (3) will work harder at it than my son, go figure!"
79114,Wes Bender,2007-06-04 17:43:00,105," It is much easier to beg for forgivness then it is to beg for permission..haha Buy it all now.  I was just married last Aug. so I haven't really have much experience but I haven't noticed my fishing days reduce. Actually, this spring I fished steelhead more then in any previous year. Been out walleye and lake trout fishing 4 or 5 times since the seasons open up here in NWO.  I guess it is all a matter of priorities I guess. I make sure I do all my home renovations during the week, after work."
79145,SlowPoke,2007-06-04 19:10:00,2984,"I fished a lot as a kid and then backed off as partying, girls and cars took over. I got back into it in my late teens for a few years and met my future wife. She didn't hold me back from fishing but I found myself wanting to spend more time with her.  That feeling wore off and I bought a boat.  I spent lots of time and money rebuilding it and setting it up for Lake Ontario and then I transferred to London. We just had our first child and the boat sat. I'm not sure if it had anything to do with our first daughter, moreso not having anybody to fish with. It was such an ordeal to hook up and go, find productive water (Lake Erie only had 1 walleye back then and everybody took turns catching it).  I eventually traded the boat for a Gold Wing. That took up room in the garage for a few years. Sold that to my neighbour and bought my Jeep.  In late 2005 I decided I was going to MAKE TIME FOR FISHING! It was the best decision I ever made. In 2006 I got out more than I had in the previous 10 years and had some great success with a few personal bests in numbers and size. I was itching for another boat and began the seach.  Early 2007 rolls around and my Jeep gets stolen. It turned out to be a good thing I guess, it wouldn't have made a very good tow vehicle and I replaced it with a Tahoe. A couple weeks later I get a call from a guy that was selling his boat that I looked at last year (long story) and we come to a deal. Incidently, he bought a new Gold Wing.  I've spent lots of time and money setting this boat up and I have yet catch a damn fish in it!  Well, that's my storey. I'm not sure if marriage or kids (that was the point of this thread wasn't it?) hampered my fishing 'career'. Things happen, priorities change, interests wain. My wife is very supportive of my habit, at least for now and I'm careful not to take advantage of it.  -Brian"
79152,Markystang,2007-06-04 19:18:00,131,"I never really got into fishing until after I was married. Fished a few times as a kid, but nothing real serious. Having young kids can slow things down quite a bit. Just ask me when I was at the gym last..... But now that my kids are getting a bit older(daughter almost 5, son 3), I take them fishing with me fairly often. I'm out usually out a couple times a week, and take one of the kids with me half the time, even though they're only up to it for an hour or so. Often if I take one of the kids with me, I don't even bring my own rod. I just help them learn to fish."
79155,wask,2007-06-04 19:21:00,174,"When I was single, I would fish 3-5 times per week.  Come home from work, back up to the boat, change clothes and grab a sandwich and gone for the evening.  Then I got married and moved to Canada, and didn't fish much the first three years (living in the kawarthas!), even sold me boat (like an idiot).  Now I am doing a lot of fishing, once a week anyway.  That is a lot compared to the first few years of marriage.  I was really busy working two jobs when I first moved up here and lots was going on.  Im not sure things have slowed down, but I have learned how to manage everything and still get out and at least make an attempt to catch some fish.  Still haven't reaplaced the boat yet though!"
