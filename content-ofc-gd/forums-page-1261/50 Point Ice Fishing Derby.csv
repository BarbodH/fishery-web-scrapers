41022,Hooked,2007-02-28 03:35:00,891,"Pretty anxious to see the results of this derby.  I fished there alot before it iced up, and no action was happening at all there.  And I mean no action!  Hopefully some more fished moved in over the winter, or else it'll be a tough fishing day. Good luck to all going out."
