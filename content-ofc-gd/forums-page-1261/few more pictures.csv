39730,cisco,2007-02-25 11:27:00,597,"Great goin!  Wish I coulda gone too (the work thing sucks, it really does )  I surmise from the cryptic messages in a coupla threads that ole Ron the ""Simcoe guru""   had something to do with 1st place prize?  Surely someone can verify/post prize standings. Ron's a shy fellow, so someone really ought to do the right thing and rat him out to the rest of us!!!!"
