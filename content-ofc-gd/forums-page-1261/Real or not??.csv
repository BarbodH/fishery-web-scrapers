40796,dobber1978,2007-02-27 20:51:00,13,Are these real??  I have never caught anything even close to this size      
40798,ccmtcanada,2007-02-27 20:56:00,7971,I've seen these pics before...there was nothing about them that tells me that they are fake.  A quick image search on Google shows lots of monster pike about this size.....
40799,bigfish1965,2007-02-27 20:58:00,3382,The first is from Holland.
40802,Mike Colaneri,2007-02-27 21:00:00,9,"I believe the one with Dude holding the pike is very real.  In fact, wasn't it caught in Sweden?  I don't think it's a North American fish."
40803,Mike Colaneri,2007-02-27 21:01:00,9,Ya beat me to it Rick!
40807,Weeds,2007-02-27 21:15:00,782,Seen the first pic plenty before but that second pic is pretty wild. Hard to get any kind of sense of scale though.......
40809,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 21:19:00,2585,yeah i have seen those pics plenty of times.  I did also hear they were real but the first one was from europe. huge fish though!
40827,irishfield,2007-02-27 21:59:00,26272,"As others have stated it's a Netherlands/Holland Pike. Picture is right out of, I believe, In- Fisherman and same guy/fish is in Winter edition of Esox Angler. Not sure who/where the second picture is from but it has floated around OFC for years.  The email going around with both pictures in it though claims they are Ontario Fish!"
40829,douG,2007-02-27 22:06:00,2693,Ask me! Ask me!
40840,irishfield,2007-02-27 22:25:00,26272,Doug..who's picture is the hungry Pike?
40845,Rich Clemens,2007-02-27 22:36:00,3131,"Seen these before too ... Somewhere in Northern Europe.      If I saw something like that coming up, I wouldn't need to go to the bathroom for a week.  Hmmm ... ONFC get together over in Europe for a pike tourney ?"
40869,GbayGiant,2007-02-27 23:23:00,1780,"Anyone have that picture of the Native fellow that caught that monstruos pike that would have been a world record but he fed his family with it ? the picture has his whole family holding the fish in the newspaper.  I'll keep looking for it, having trouble finding it, it was a canadian fish, think Alberta."
40874,mattyk,2007-02-27 23:35:00,2110,I have seen that picutre with the guy and his family holding the pike. I think it was from manitoba.
40881,Victor,2007-02-28 00:03:00,1609,hey GBayGiant i've got that picture saved in my home computer ... however i'm not on that comp right now so when i get the chance i'll post it up
40892,GbayGiant,2007-02-28 00:14:00,1780," Cool , ya I thought Alberta but I think your right it was Manitoba."
40930,bucktail,2007-02-28 01:27:00,1857,"Yep it was Manitoba.  Those Euro pike are insane! 5 weeks till I get my mount back, will post the pic"
40945,mepps,2007-02-28 01:35:00,1301,Its gotta be pretty close to the 55lb world record...     heres the Manitoba monster...  
40956,Northhunter,2007-02-28 01:42:00,214,"I've seen both pics before - they aren't related.  The first is from someplace over in Europe, but there's an email going around with both pics saying the fish is Canadian. I don't know where the 2nd pic is from but saw it for the first time about 3yrs ago."
40965,Master of Bait,2007-02-28 01:50:00,196,"Wow!  Yet another fat euro-pike.  Seems to me like there's a lot of bigger versions of our warm water species over there.  The pike seem much bulkier, the perch are bigger all 'round and the zander are larger than our walleye on average.  Any thoughts on the reason for this?  My guess is some combination of genetics, prolonged growing season and possibly forage?  Either way, whenever I get over there, I'm packin' my rod..."
40991,GbayGiant,2007-02-28 02:51:00,1780,"That's the one I was thinking of Mepps, what a beast, haven't seen that top one before but it's monstrous too.  Looks like it just pooped a 20lbs fish with that loose skin though."
41035,Victor,2007-02-28 04:26:00,1609,was just going to post it up right now  ...  huge fish indeed ... i would be happy with one 2/3 that size haha
41036,Tybo,2007-02-28 04:31:00,1373,"Well either way, that smaller pike is screwed!  Very cool pic!  As Wayne said, the first Pike is on the cover of the Winter edition of ESOX Angler Magazine.  Joey  Edit:  Dang, posted under Tybo Again!!"
41041,Bassman27,2007-02-28 04:59:00,98,"Could you imagine hookin a hog like that,stuff dreams are made of!!!!  Bassman"
