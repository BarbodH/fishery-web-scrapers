40541,Dondorfish,2007-02-27 04:52:00,1000,Well - I wanted a sleeper hut on Simcoe ( I know - I know - only a couple of weeks left! ) so out came the tools. First was the base - 7 1/2 X 10 should be just about right:   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...8_184_17810.jpg  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...8_184_21802.jpg   And now the finished project:   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...08_184_5193.jpg   And this is my setup:   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...8_184_20071.jpg    This is the interior - top bunk folds up for fishing: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...08_184_7235.jpg   More interior:   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...08_184_9112.jpg   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...08_184_6993.jpg    This is the view from the front door:   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/uploads...8_184_21161.jpg    Now - If I can just catch some fish!  We put it out at the end of Innisfil Beach Rd. Started in 45 feet and then moved it to 83 feet   Good fishin' all   Don

40912,Dondorfish,2007-02-28 00:56:00,1000,"Thanks for the kind words guys. Next year it will be alot easier to spot with the OFC stickers and flag - so drop on by and say hello. That was it close to shore at Innisfill Park ( now moved out to the deeper water - 83 feet ). That was as far as we got with it before getting stuck - lol. The atv took it the rest of the way out! I will be adding better skis to it in the off season and plan to add the strips to the bottom of the runners ( Clampet ). It did take many many hours to complete, but I enjoy building things so it was fun ( most of the time! ). Hope some of you guys drop by if your out that way to say hello.    P.S.  -  No T.V. - but i do have a portable dvd player that runs off the battery! And the microwave will have to wait till I get generator for it!  - and yes - it's as heavy as it looks!   Don"
40926,GNODDY,2007-02-28 01:22:00,163,Nice Hut looks like you really took the time to make a nice one
