Hope to make a report later this evening...  We are targetting crappie but perch and pickerel are welcome to pull on our strings also

Both CPH and I hooked sumpin' but  hit the quick release button too soon...several bites but nadda...  A couple of photos is all we got for 4 hours of hard fishing...01:30 to 05:30 pm  Crappieperchhunter   Yours truly   We did see some crappie caught by others nearby so they are still in there if anybody is heading up Wednesday (last chance this season)  A vexilar would have been handy...tough fishing crappie blind."
