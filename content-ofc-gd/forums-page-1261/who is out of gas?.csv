41093,Mike the Pike,2007-02-28 13:22:00,3421, The problem has started here Carl.Some Petro cans and shell gas stations have been closing.
41095,OhioFisherman,2007-02-28 13:26:00,6623,"We have had the fuel shortage due to refinery problems also. We need more refineries, but nobody wants one in their backyard, enviromental concerns."
41099,Basskicker,2007-02-28 13:44:00,421,I travel by 7 gas stations on my way to work this morning from Courtice...thru Oshawa and Whibty and into Ajax.  6 out of 7 were empty.  Yesterday they were 4 that had gas.....now ONLY 1......not good.  Jason
41101,jil101ca,2007-02-28 13:53:00,41,"I haven't seen an empty station in or around North bay, gas is $.99 to $102.9 as of last night."
41108,tonyb,2007-02-28 14:26:00,1637," Thanks for the tip Wayne.  Someone also suggested we take some Jerry cans of fuel.  The problem with that is, then we have to take less beer to fit the extra gas cans!  Tony"
41139,Fishnfiend,2007-02-28 16:27:00,357,"Tony, any time you head up into the wild north it is recommended that you take additional    cans.  I would recommend at least 1/2 of your vehicles capacity at a minimum.  For example, I take 2 5 gal cans in addition to filling up at a station up there.  My truck holds 100 litres, but if you get stranded and need to run your engine for heat, running out of gas could be life threatening. If you are worried about space, take some whisky in place of beer (another bonus is that it doesn't freeze."
41162,irishfield,2007-02-28 17:25:00,26272,I think you'll be fine Tony. Just fill in North Bay..three stations just before McD's and then Mr.Gas..Husky etc up on the hill as you leave on #11. It's only 100km to Temagami from there and to be safe for the return trip refill at Shell right in Temagami... as they're bound to have fuel..but if they don't I'm sure Temagami Marine will pump you some premium from the fuel dock pump as they keep that whole area plowed. Rock Pine Motel also has fuel just south of Martin River PPark.
41170,lew,2007-02-28 17:36:00,12767,"I was watching the noon news today and a spokesman for ESSO says they should start getting back on track this weekend seeing as they now have most of the fire damage repaired.  When the interviewer asked how soon we could expect the gasoline prices to start dropping back to normal now that their producing again, the spokesman seemed genuinely surprised at the question and actually said that the rise in prices had nothing to do with the fires, and it was just a natural increase due to the cold winter and low oil stocks in the U.S.......  They must have to keep all the excuses for high prices written down on a piece of paper in front of themselves so they don't get them mixed up from one day to the next."
41177,Headhunter,2007-02-28 17:58:00,5703,"I was watching the CBC last night and one of the comments I heard was specifically directed at gas prices in Ontario. They claimed that Ontario has the lowest gas prices in the counrty and that the prices we are seeing today, in the .95 to $1.00 /ltr. range, are equal to what the rest of the country is paying every day. The lower prices we had been seeing was the result of competition in the GTA. They also suggested that it will take some time, before there will be any reduction in price at the pumps. It will take ""market share"" price wars to get the price to dip again. I guess that means that we'll be paying through the nose for a while folks! HH"
41218,carll2,2007-02-28 19:55:00,443,really mike? here on the north shore of mtl nothing has closed yet i dont think too much will close dont we have our own refineries in montreals north end?
41256,Garyv,2007-02-28 22:35:00,547,My wife told me this morning I had plenty last night!
41278,fishergirl72,2007-02-28 23:23:00,455," LOL, another good one Garyv! You keep making me laugh everytime I read one of your posts!"
40744,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 19:19:00,2585,Most of North Oakville is out of gas today!  One sunoco staion at newagawa and dundas had 50+ car line ups.  I think its the only one.  i had to run over to burlington walkers and mainway for gas.  Need to go to london tommorow so I had to find some gas somewhere.  How is the gas situation where you live?  Are you dry or pumps still running?
40746,Davis Battah,2007-02-27 19:24:00,31,"The Esso in Brookin has been out of gas since just shortly after the problem surfaced.  They are a newer station, maybe they are on some type of a seniority system when stuff like this happens.  Still lots of other places around the area with gas though.  Kinda sounds like the Road Warrior movie, but it makes you think how much the world would change if suddenly tommorrow there was absolutely no fuel ANYWHERE anymore."
40750,bigfish1965,2007-02-27 19:31:00,3382,"Lots of gas around here. We have many different suppliers and station, though. There's always NY State, too."
40755,aniceguy,2007-02-27 19:36:00,1094,"had to get gas at trafalger and the 401 earlier today 2 out of the 3 are dry, where I live Winston Churchill and the 403 still good to go if you wanna call it that @ a buck a litre"
40763,SlowPoke,2007-02-27 20:01:00,2984,I drive a truck that uses 450 lts/day between the two of us driving. We've encountered many diesel stations closed and I thought I was in big trouble last night in Toronto when our fleet tanks were empty and I was on a quarter tank. I knew I had enough to get back home to London but my day driver would be left with nothing. I decided to swing into the Esso in Ingersol which had been closed all week for no fuel and they were open! That's the good news. The bad news is that I got thier last 230 lts. Most of us truck drivers don't have the benifit of pulling into any gas station... -not all have diesel -we don't fit in most -we often have only one company to choose from with a fleet fuel card. I suspect it's going to get worse before it gets better. I hope my day driver was able to get fuel in Windsor or I might not be able to work tonight. I need the money! -Brian
40764,Joey,2007-02-27 20:02:00,9122,"Richmond Hill is DRY!!  I was going to stop this morning, but none at Esso, none at Petro-Can, and the lineup at Shell was a mile lone, so I went and lunch and then the Shell didn't have any either.  I'll be walking after tomorrow  Joey"
40783,charlesn,2007-02-27 20:32:00,551,"Yeah, I saw on the news that the 3 stations in Richmond Hill near Bayview and Major Mac were dry.  The 2 I mentioned in another post at Hwy 10/Britannia in Mississauga were dry this morning.  The Shell at Hwy 10/Matheson was serving up Super unleaded at 97.8 since they were out of Bronze and Silver.  I assume they have plenty because a big double tanker had just pulled in when I got there.  Of course, not sure it was delivering more fuel, just speculating.  Charles"
40787,tonyb,2007-02-27 20:42:00,1637,"Hopefully everything is fine for the long drive to temagami and back...then again, if there was no gas up there it wouldn't be that bad.  Looks like we have to spend the week in Temagami, sorry work  Tony"
40791,Kirk,2007-02-27 20:47:00,347,Got about 80L in jerry cans and a full tank...
40804,misfish,2007-02-27 21:02:00,29133,"How did you win that case Kirk  Barrie has had it,s empty places,but alls good here so far. I fuel up at the Shell depot, so it,s always got fuel. Anyone that can find a fuel supply station that is maned,can get fuel. The Bull part is it is shell,they are not effected but the price is still up. I can,t complain though,I get my gear oil and motor oil for the boat for free. Ah friends in low places. LOL"
40805,Kirk,2007-02-27 21:06:00,347,"The jerry cans are to make sure I can get to court, can't win without showing up, its one of the technical requirements"
40806,SlowPoke,2007-02-27 21:08:00,2984, (I've been dying to use that smiley)
40812,carll2,2007-02-27 21:23:00,443,why exactly is there a lack of fuel in ontario? here in quebec everything seems fine and dandy
40836,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 22:19:00,2585,2 refinery fires is why there is a shortage of gas.  Imperial oil had the fires but all the big 3 are feeling the effects becasue the demand is so high.  Apparetnly it will be fixed this time next week but who knows.  Cheers!
40838,irishfield,2007-02-27 22:21:00,26272,Leah went to Ottawa and back without issue Sun/Mon and I went to TO and back with the other daughter. Everyone still seems to have fuel around here..Peterborough...Ottawa...PetroCan on 400  Tony...if you do head North on fumes and can't leave Temagami...see you Next Friday ! LOL I do suggest you fill your tank in North Bay (Mr. Gas..top of the hill going out of North Bay) to be safe though....
40839,Davis Battah,2007-02-27 22:24:00,31,Spotted today at ESSO.....     Reported incident out in Oakville:    If you see these guys.................. hand over your gas and RUN!     Sorry big fan of this movie!
40848,Rich Clemens,2007-02-27 22:39:00,3131,"Just heard today that Exxon/Mobile is pulling out of Pennsylvania at the end of this month.  Saw the signs on the local Mobile station here in town.    Sure ... the gas credit card I use every month.  Not sure why, but I heard that our governor is considering taxing the profits of the oil companies here in the state (true or not ... not certain)"
40854,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 22:56:00,2585,taxing profits? that sounds fishy.
40875,Roy,2007-02-27 23:36:00,13728,Things will be fine in a moment. They just want you to feel the pinch a little before they tell you that they now have lots of fuel for everyone at $1.10/L. Everyone will feel much better then.  I can't believe I didn't get into that business a few years ago.
40911,tjsa,2007-02-28 00:55:00,1578,"I haven't run out of gas yet,....................but,............. that could be because of my diet."
40915,walleyejigger,2007-02-28 00:57:00,876,"all stations here are still open but the price went up to 106.6 this afternoon, and of course i'm running on fumes"
41021,kennyman,2007-02-28 03:34:00,737,"Brantford seems to have lots. Typical price gouging though. The gas companies should have their  prices more closely regulated. Really, what other consumer goods fluctuate to that extent ...... especially on holiday weekends? Funny how that works, isn't it? Must be just a big coincidence!"
41078,ccmtcanada,2007-02-28 12:40:00,7971,"I pass an Esso station almost every day at Bayview just north of Eglinton...haven't seen them open in over a week (at least at 730am).  Filled up in Whitby this morning, but the Sunoco I was at only had their Ultra available...at least they were selling it for the price of their cheapest gas....at a bargoon 99.9 cents!"
41082,Fish Farmer,2007-02-28 12:59:00,2234,It's amazing how 1 little refinery can control the price of gas. I wonder what there next excuse will be to put up gas prices. It's a Scam!!
41084,lew,2007-02-28 13:01:00,12767,"ESSO in Scarboro at Victoria Park & Danforth was down to only regular a couple days ago, but I gassed up this morning and their now selling all grades again......strange too, cause I was the only car there, and I was expecting the place to be busy.......99.9 ¢ for regular.  Don't think they've been totally outta gas yet.  I heard some drivers interviewed on the radio this morning and some were saying  they were trying up to a dozen stations before they found one with gas in the GTA."
