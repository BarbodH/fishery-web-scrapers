40615,dsn,2007-02-27 13:50:00,1018,That 30 sec fillet looks pretty quick and simple.  dsn
40675,Mike Pike,2007-02-27 16:22:00,1332,"I dunno, I think the guy who did the fillet in 30-seconds wastes a lot of meat.  I wouldn't let him fillet my catch.  I'd prefer to take more time with it and cut around the ribs.  IMHO."
40681,Garyv,2007-02-27 16:30:00,547,I purchased an electric filet knife years ago and do all my Bass and Salmon with it.  Once you get on to them they can save you loads of time.
40753,Fisherman,2007-02-27 19:36:00,7201,"Like Mike said, I'd make him dig through what he was throwning out and make him cook chowder out of it, waste not, want not.  Anyone can fillet with a chainsaw."
