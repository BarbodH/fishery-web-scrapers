I think it was last Monday or Tuesday that I ordered them in. Not too bad a price at $67.77 with the taxes and postage in. BRING ON THE BIG BAD SKIS!!!"

40909,Pigeontroller,2007-02-28 00:50:00,2793,"Knipex are worth the money, every serious Muskie Angler should have a pair!"
40960,silveradosheriff,2007-02-28 01:46:00,1025,"Yes, they are awesome.  This is where I have purchased for myself and friends.  Particularly useful if you have a buddy in the states to have them sent to.  http://chadstoolbox.com/"
