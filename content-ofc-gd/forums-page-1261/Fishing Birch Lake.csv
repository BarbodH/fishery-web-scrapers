40250,ssauvain,2007-02-26 17:21:00,77,"Hello one and all Iowa boy here just wanting to know a little more information about Birch lake. We are flying in with Peter Kay and staying at his outpost on Birch. We have fished another site of his Saddle Lake and accomodations and fishing were phenomenal. He informs us the walleye fishing is as good and bigger fish. We are going the 2nd week of July...what are some lures of choice...also what is the lake trout and northern fishing like. I would appreciate any help! Usually I like the storm wildeye's, shad raps, etc....any particular colors. Thanks again!"
40621,ssauvain,2007-02-27 14:01:00,77,I guess no one knows of Birch Lake...or no one has fished it??? Are there Musky on this lake???
40652,tinbanger,2007-02-27 15:26:00,1028,Lots of Birch lakes out there .Maybe give a bit more info . Used to trout fish one north of Kingston but I doubt thats the one you are referring to. TB
40656,irishfield,2007-02-27 15:31:00,26272,Was the first place I thought of too TB...Birch Lake..North of Kaladar by Plevna. But no need to fly in there! So many lakes with the same name in Ontario...yah need to be a tad more specific...and I've never heard of Peter Kay to help.
40659,Terry,2007-02-27 15:38:00,14456,must mean the Lac Seul area?
40661,tinbanger,2007-02-27 15:42:00,1028,"Reminds me of the old joke .. "" you're from Canada ? Do you know Peter Kay?""  ok I never said it was a good joke  tb"
40662,ccmtcanada,2007-02-27 15:51:00,7971,This may be what he's talking about.....  http://www.birchlakelodge.com/
40703,ssauvain,2007-02-27 17:48:00,77,http://www.kayair.com  This is the place we are going...does this help???
40705,irishfield,2007-02-27 17:57:00,26272,Now that we have the website...that narrows it down for sure! Hopefully someone has been there and can help you out.  Hey Connie...U been?....and is that the 18 you was tellin me about?
40715,ssauvain,2007-02-27 18:26:00,77,By the way the Birch Lake I am talking about is located 70 air miles NE of Ear Falls. Does that help out????
40898,ssauvain,2007-02-28 00:29:00,77,Is there some good stock colors for lakes in this region that are better then others for walleye...I always have good luck with the blue/chrome type lures....just wondering...thanks for all your help...
40934,bucktail,2007-02-28 01:31:00,1857,"Isn't the Ontario record smallmouth from a ""Birch Lake""?"
41005,BabyHerc,2007-02-28 03:19:00,285,"If it's a fly-in, jsut put a picture of a roast beef sandwich on the hook.  Fish will be jumping in the boat!  And yes Bucktail, it is!"
41210,ssauvain,2007-02-28 19:42:00,77,So you guys are saying Birch has smallmouth? My dad and I use to go to Fireside Lodge on Little Vermillion and had awesome early season bass fishing....my fondest memory is my first smallie weighed 6 lbs...and caught it on my ultralight with fireline....on Claus lake I believe...great times!
41248,BabyHerc,2007-02-28 21:49:00,285,"Nice bass, Ssauvain... how early was this early season fishing?"
41249,ssauvain,2007-02-28 21:57:00,77,"It was the end of May as bass were moving up to reefs and rock piles...my 2nd bass I got was not much later the same day and it weighed 5 1/2 pounds...we have unbelievable bass fishing on Little Vermillion...my dad goes about every year...except 2 years ago when we flew out of ear falls to saddle lake outpost...6 of us and we caught on the average about 500 walleyes a day for the group...it was unreal!!! This year we are flying to birch lake...that is why I  was posting to see if anyone had any experience with the lake...or what works well for the walleye in that particular water....we love to troll shap raps, berkley frenzies, etc....wildeyes...."
41259,solopaddler,2007-02-28 22:38:00,8605,"I was hesitant to add my 2 cents to this thread, as I wasn't totally sure it was the lake I was thinking of. As it turns out I think I can help. I've paddled the Cat lake chain of lakes. Birch Lake actually feeds into them, and if you follow the chain downstream they feed into Lake St. Joseph which is the headwaters of the Albany. All of these lakes are walleye factories, with a pretty heavy tanin stain to the water. To be honest all I ever use up there are 3"" twister tails in a variety of hot colours and a handful of 1/8, and 1/4 oz heads. Bait is not necessary. Birch is a pretty big lake from my recollection with a ton of islands, and very irregular in shape, so you won't get bored. The one thing I'd definitely recommend you do: Check out the outflowing river (the one that feeds into the Cat Lake chain). When you come to the first impassable rapids, beach the boat, grab your rods and go for a walk. Fish below the rapids, wade wet if you have to...All the current areas up there are just stacked with fish, especially the ones not easily accessible to any outpost camps or lodges."
41263,ssauvain,2007-02-28 22:43:00,77,Thanks so much for the info solo...yes that sounds like the lake that the outfitter told us about..I havea lake map and they say it is very irregular shaped and a walleye hotspot...lake trout too...and supposedly nice northern. The river you talk of is it on the south end of the lake??? I will definitely try that...sounds like an adventure.
41265,ssauvain,2007-02-28 22:52:00,77,Solo...I looked and yes it looks like there is a river flowing into the Cat Lake Chain from Birch Lake...we will staying at Kayair outpost out of ear falls on the northeast shore of the lake...if that is close to the river you speak of????
