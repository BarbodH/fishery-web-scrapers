40504,fishingguy28,2007-02-27 02:56:00,98,hey guys hows it goin.... planning one more major ice fishing weekend trip before the end of the season and then it will jus be small day trips!!  i'm looking for accomadations for 4-6 people and i'll br bringing the lady so i was wondering if there were any recomendations out there.... i wanted to try a place other then simcoe or nipissing and was looking for an ice bungalow....  the reason i am asking is because i wanted to see if there were any places you guys could recommend that were good for quantity rather than quality.... i would like the opposite but i want her to catch some fish!!!  i know this will probably open a lot of doors for panfish but that's ok with me....  thanks again
