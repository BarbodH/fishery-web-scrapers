They are saying snow early Thursday turning to several hours of freezing rain for the afternoon rush hour.  Winds are expected to hit up to 70km/h.  For Friday the temps are going to head up to +3 celsius, so snow turning to rain, then back to snow for Saturday.  Not sure what this kind of weather will do to ice for weekend fishing, but I assume it cant help."
