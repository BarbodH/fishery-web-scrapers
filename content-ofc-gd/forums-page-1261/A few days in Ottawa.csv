40276,Roy,2007-02-26 18:30:00,13728,Great pics Lew. Glad you had a good time. Both Ottawa and Kingston rank right up there in Canada's really great historical cities.
40301,SlowPoke,2007-02-26 19:43:00,2984," Hey Roy, how about Quebec City? I've only passed through but I did have some quick glimpses of some nice architecture. Old Montreal is nice to look at too with the cobblestones and horse drawn carriages but you're right about Kingston and Ottawa.  -Brian"
40306,Pigeontroller,2007-02-26 19:51:00,2793,"Great pics and report Lew, you'll have to plan the next trip during Muskie Season!"
40339,GbayGiant,2007-02-26 20:54:00,1780,"Nice weekend Lew, I forgot how beautiful Ottawa is.  They definitely don't make buildings like the parliament, the insides even better, makes you wonder were all the tax money goes though I can only imagine their offices with marble floors, flat-screen T.V.'s and mini bars."
40349,Bernie,2007-02-26 21:24:00,3190,Glad to see you had a good trip Lew. Good pictures. Ottawa is a great city . Clean compared to others and for some reason easy to get around in. It seems to be on a slower pace. Been there many times. Ten years ago took my scout troop and did a tour of several places. We camped for the night at the aircraft museum(I bunked under a Hawker Hurricane). Lots of things to see and do and look forward to my next trip there.
40358,lew,2007-02-26 21:48:00,12767," The cleanliness of the streets was the 1st thing I noticed about Ottawa, specially comparing them with the streets here in Toronto. Seems like the folks take alot more pride in their home than those that live here, unfortunately.  The Boy Scouts also had something going on this weekend at Parlaiment Hill...... Lots of Scout flags and banners being erected on the front lawn but I never had a chance to find out what it was."
40378,woodro,2007-02-26 22:41:00,168,haha you should have brought the auger out to wet a line and pass some time on the rideau!! lol
40380,Squid,2007-02-26 22:44:00,1656,"Great pictures Lew. It was a great weekend to be outside and from the pictures, it looks like Diane and you had a great time."
40384,Crazyhook,2007-02-26 22:58:00,1154,"Lew it was great having a cold one with you and Diane, Nice seeing you! your smile was bigger then ever!"
40407,lew,2007-02-26 23:38:00,12767,"Too bad you couldn't make it back over on Saturday night too Jamie, you missed out on some great grub over at the Keg.  See you in a couple weeks.....maybe ??"
40415,Handlebarz,2007-02-26 23:47:00,3790,Hey Lew it looks like you can get away and not hit the water that seems weired in some way.  Glad to see and here you and Diane had a great trip its nice to just get away for one I guess.
40425,Grimace,2007-02-27 00:02:00,2020,"One of my favorite Cities on earth.  Tulip festival rocks when the dutch flood Ottawa with flowers as a thank you for WW2.    My Blood runs rich with Canadian pride whenever I am in the nations Capitol.   I lived there for a few years as well, loved it.   Shopping in the By-ward market, fighter planes over parliament hill on remembrance day.   I miss Ottawa, thanks for the trip."
40441,Loonietoon,2007-02-27 00:32:00,1450,Glad you two had a great trip Lew... How is Sheri doing these days?
40448,Crazyhook,2007-02-27 01:10:00,1154,"Lew... Just booking Florida! may be by next weekend, I will know tomorrow!  great seeing you again...!"
40489,Garyv,2007-02-27 02:26:00,547, To keep Roy in check!
40786,Mike Pike,2007-02-27 20:41:00,1332,Great travel pics and commentary Lew.  Thank you!  My daughter went to college in Ottawa and she raves about the city and the things there are to do there.  She's big into jogging and biking and says there are terrific trails there.  Scenery everywhere!
40904,crusty,2007-02-28 00:44:00,83,"Wish I would have known you were coming, I would have extended you a place to stay. I was acually down in LA till this morning. But get Crazy to give me a heads up next time your coming down and I'll buy you a round, or two."
40920,TJQ,2007-02-28 01:04:00,7806,Sweet Lew... glad you had a good time.
40924,danc,2007-02-28 01:19:00,4677,Never been there Lew. Thanks for the hands on look.
40275,lew,2007-02-26 18:28:00,12767," Actually, it was such a gorgeous weekend weather-wise, we decided to spend all our time touring the outdoors stuff and we'll save the indoors sites for another  weekend when the weather isn't so nice.  We did spend alot of time around Parlaiment Hill though taking in the sites.  Chris, thanks for the summer pics of the locks, it's nice to get a different perspective.  I'll be seeing the Ottawa River again this summer at least once, cept this time it'll be chasing some big toothies."
