40417,keram,2007-02-26 23:49:00,585,"Yup, this is a difference and the difference is made, because few more people get involved. I call them ""suckers"", but generaly they are known as "" bottom feeders "". Whatever it takes to make a buck."
40418,Bernie,2007-02-26 23:51:00,3190,Boy is that ever true. Several years ago my son had a spent 30.30 shell case in his pocket at school. He showed it to a classmate and a teacher spotted it. Well did that ever stir things up! I had phone calls from Principles to police. Unbelievable. My dad carried a .410 to school so he could hunt on the way home.
40427,Tybo,2007-02-27 00:05:00,1373,Their was a kid in high school that shot himself in the girls change room. Most of the school heard about it at morning announcements the next day. School carry on like nothing happened. Know days they would have the hole school in for counseling. Even if you didn't know him.
40428,urbanangler1990,2007-02-27 00:06:00,933,"wow very interesting, thnx for this..."
40431,urbanangler1990,2007-02-27 00:09:00,933," i completly disagree, I AM in skool and some bad things have happend, all we get is the announcement next day..."
40433,Terry,2007-02-27 00:14:00,14456,"well, sound all too true to me"
40447,douG,2007-02-27 01:08:00,2693,"Not exactly the same society here, but I understand your issues   - not enough Police!"
40454,Daplumma,2007-02-27 01:24:00,1961,"Interesting read Jason.Some parts of this country have become so sensitive and PC that I can hardly stand it.As John Prine says..""It makes no sense when common sense dont make no sense at all"" Joe"
40455,urbanangler1990,2007-02-27 01:24:00,933,"society looks like it was muchhh better back then, wow that is terrible, i just had to read it again, sadd..."
40493,bigfish1965,2007-02-27 02:32:00,3382,Well if I had a kid and the principal 'paddled' him..the principal could expect the same (or worse) from me. Fact of the matter is kids today are LESS likely to become violent then we were.
40494,Motorhead,2007-02-27 02:34:00,163,When I was in elementary school my female teacher used to spank me everyday... Now I have to pay big-bucks...
40524,cisco,2007-02-27 03:51:00,597,Violence has its place. Proof is in the pudding.
40548,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 05:40:00,49,I usually stay out of this type of forum but being one of the oldest here I think I have seen more changes then the rest of you. Dr Spock started the trend to kids with no respect for anything actually.  I never beat one  of my kids but they felt the sting of a good swat on the butt.  The ruler from the teacher a couple of times taught be to open my mouth when I was suppose to not when I wanted to.  I never had to get one of my kids out of Jail or a crack house.  I think stern but fair is the way to go.  The fellow that wanted to nail the priciple for swatting his kid on the butt is probably the reason his kid needed swating.  Lol  My thoughts on this and I have a right to my thoughts.  The same as you do.  Bob
40564,OhioFisherman,2007-02-27 10:47:00,6623,"Canadians may be more civilized, a couple of area high schools here, including the one my kids have been closed due to bomb threats. Area hospital had bomb threats. Shooting at a Cleveland High school last week and a near riot at another.  The respect for others seems to have disappeared here."
40565,Roy,2007-02-27 10:55:00,13728,"It's not only there, Paul. In my own backyard it's as bad as anywhere else although lotsa folks like to find worst places...helps make them feel good. We are now paying for our ME generation and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. People are no longer held responsible for their actions."
40569,OhioFisherman,2007-02-27 11:15:00,6623,"Roy it is country here where I am at, we had like 21 people arrested last week? at a house(mini farm) for chicken fighting, 6 year old kid and a 16 year old handcuffed and people whining about it. How do the police know how they will re-act. The police need to secure the scene for their own safety, why not whine about the stupidity of the parents taking kids to illegal activities?  The police don`t know if the kid will go out to a car and get a gun, LOL everyone has them here and too many wind up in kids hands. Real hard to teach the kids if you don`t know how to act. Ya a me and mine generation. Yours? only if you lock it up and guard it!"
40601,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-27 13:10:00,621,"Basic problem we have lost the basic fundamental values on how both countries were founded  We have become a complacent society  There is more violence today in the world,the streets than any other period Its just presented in a more subtle way Only thing that has changed,the violence that exist elswhere in the world is now in our street among our youths at a higher rate than any other generation  That is the decay of society  In Montreal 2007, 6 murders out of 7 are street gang related by teenagers and 20 year old's Great parenting I km Seems it was more peacefull when crime was organized  What about Me ,none is accountable How true Roy"
40637,blaque,2007-02-27 14:47:00,2419,"Judgement days a' comin soon folks! Seriously though, ya have to look to the media for alot of this deterioration. Look at the evolution of the music industry. Back in the day, it was parents appauled at Elvis gyrating his hips, thats the worst the youth had to emulate lol. Now every video on MTV is just full of guys worryin about their 22"" wheels , how shiny the paint is on their ride, and the girls are pretty much naked lookin for the guy with the ""most banginest"" ride and whos got the most ""ice"" on his neck.  Every song i hear on the pop stations has to do with gettin yours, and pretty much straight up sex, image, looks, and money. Man i could go on with this topic literally for weeks on end lol. I gotta end it though or Ill have gone thru my day here at work without getting a thing done lol."

40740,Cookslav,2007-02-27 19:10:00,1457,"Its different in every region I would bet, but as a whole I would guess the opposite to be true. I don't need to look further then Kids I see every day. 90% of them are good kids...but even the good ones seem to talk the talk, dress the part, and have a sense of entitlement about them. Its fashionable to be bad unfortunately. But I completely agree the Paddle statement... Any teacher smacks either of my 2 girls...they had better go into hiding. My Wife and I will discipline my Children, if its a repeat problem...I'll swat I've no issue with spanking, but I want to be the one to set the limit...everyone’s different  True... Kids are only as bad as we allow them to be. If you raise 'em right, and give them a sense of right & wrong, & some how manage to keep them humble....they should be just fine."
