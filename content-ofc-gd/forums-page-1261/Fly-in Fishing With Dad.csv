41116,Jacques,2007-02-28 15:24:00,97,My dad lives in the States now and we don't get to fish together too much any more.   He's turning 65 this year and I thought I'd take him for some fly-in fishing.-- if I can scrape the cash together  I'm thinking of around 3 days and hoping not to break the bank.  Has anyone had any good experiences?  My Dad's pretty fit but probably not up to a lot of portaging or anything.  Would really appreciate a couple of suggestions
41117,ccmtcanada,2007-02-28 15:31:00,7971,That's a great idea!  One I wish I had years ago.  My dad passed away back in 1994...and I wish I could plan the same.  Sorry...have no ideas for you...just wanted to say that what you are planning will be very special...for both him and yourself!!!!
41126,solopaddler,2007-02-28 15:59:00,8605,"Tell me where you live, how far you're willing to drive, and what kind of fish you want to catch and we'll go from there. Need more info"
41127,ccmtcanada,2007-02-28 16:01:00,7971,Jacques....solopaddler is def the guy you want to hear from on this one!  His trips are fantastic!!!
41145,Jacques,2007-02-28 16:44:00,97,"I live in Oakville...  Ideally, I'd like to keep it to a drive that can be done in one day (12-14 hours max?)  Fishwise -- I'm thinking Walleye/Pike!"
41152,Smokey,2007-02-28 17:08:00,1278,"Check out Leuenebergers out of Nakina. I've been using them for the last 6 yrs and will be again this year. They do have a few lakes that they will do 3 day trips to, and you will not be dissapointed with the fishing, accomodations, equipment  and the planes. It's about a 13 hr drive from your place.  The only problem with fly-ins anymore is the price, since 9-11 the insurance rates and fuel have gone thru the roof and so have prices on the trips.  Good Luck"
41163,solopaddler,2007-02-28 17:28:00,8605,"I live in Dundas, so the destinations I've been to are about the same driving distance. For me, Nakina is about my limit for an easy day's drive, being about 14hours....There's 2 very good outfitters there I've flown with in the past: Leuenberger's (leuenberger.ca/kag.htm), and Timberidge (timberidgefishing.com). With Leuenberger I can personally recommend Muskrat, Elbow, and Kapatawanga lakes. All fantastic fisheries, and great cabins. I'm fairly certain you'd have a good trip at any of their outposts though...With Timberidge I've been to Sim and Crayon lakes...both great lakes. I would also take a look at the Wawa/Whitriver area, both within an easy days drive of S. Ontario, around 10-11hrs. The bonus of travelling to this area is the beauty of the drive north of the Soo along Lake Superior, it's very scenic. In the Wawa area I've flown with Hawk Air many times (hawkair.com) and can highly recommend Duffy, Little Missinaibi, Pichogen, Wejin and Mosambik. All great fisheries and good cabins. In White River I've flown a bunch of times with White River Air (northtoadventure.com), and can personally recommend Shekak, Hayward/Herrick, and Jembi lakes. All fantastic fisheries again and first rate cabins. If you research this and decide to pick any of the lakes I've mentioned, feel free to pm me and I can provide you with detailed info on where to fish, etc. One other point: most of these outfitters base their prices on a minimum of 4 people. If it's just you and your dad you'll still be able to go, but will likely have to pay a bit extra. All of the outfitters I've mentioned above will accomodate groups of 2 however, if that's the case. (Not all outfitters will do this)  cheers,  Mike"
41171,dustink,2007-02-28 17:40:00,526,Some great info there Solopaddler......well done!  dk
41199,Jacques,2007-02-28 19:06:00,97,"Wow.  Thanks so much for those recs Solopaddler.  I'm looking forward to checking out these places and I'll keep you posted.  By the way, I don't often chime in on reports but you've put up some of the best.  Thanks again."
41205,lew,2007-02-28 19:15:00,12767,"Jacques, I'm really happy to hear my post inspired you to set up a fish'n trip with your Dad, and I truly hope it's the trip of a lifetime for both of you.  Go get em and don't forget your camera"
41222,douG,2007-02-28 20:05:00,2693,I'll be doing the same thing with my Pa who is a spry 74 years old - we'll be taking our trip in July to Trout lake near Red Lake.  Book your trip soon so that you can start on the anticipation part of your trip - it's included in the original price.
