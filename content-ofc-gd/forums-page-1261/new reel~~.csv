40573,silveradosheriff,2007-02-27 11:58:00,1025,Very nice indeed!
40579,fishersquige,2007-02-27 12:16:00,52,It's a real nice reel. The drag is awesome just as with any stradic and it is so so so light. Beautiful reel.
40626,Blake,2007-02-27 14:16:00,418,You bought a great reel for sure.  Congrats on the purchase.
41013,kennyman,2007-02-28 03:27:00,737,Played with a Stradic 2500 at BPS. SWEET REEL!!! Unfortunately out of my price range. I settled for a Sahara.
41027,bucktail,2007-02-28 03:49:00,1857,Rock solid baby!!!
41033,Photoz,2007-02-28 04:24:00,792,"I have 2 Stradic 4000's & a 2000 . . . . .     likely the best reels for the money there is! I also have 2 Sustain 4000's, also super reels . . .  but twice the money, and NOT twice as good! I've hauled in everything from crappies to carp, salmon & 'bows with ease . . . .    you absolutely cannot go wrong with this reel. Matter of fact, I'm picking up a big ol' Stradic 6000 from Fishing World in Hamilton next trip down . . . .    just a toy to play with the salmon & carp . . . .     and I think its big enough that I could bolt it on the back of my van & tow cars! Enjoy!"
41048,baowu2,2007-02-28 05:32:00,8,HAHA...  What if i get a stella 20000?~~ hehe..... I wish the salmon season starts soon!! Miss the action so much... hands are starting to get ichy~~ lol
41448,Photoz,2007-03-01 04:22:00,792,"I had the pleasure of fondling a Stella a few years ago . . . .      a retired gent had a beauty of a 13' custom trout rod, with 'Stella' attached . . . .     he let me land about a 3 pound 'bow with it . . . . .     THAT is one nice reel! Way y y  y  y out of my price range . . . .     I'll 'make do' with the cheap stuff! Hell . . .  the fish don't know anyway!"
