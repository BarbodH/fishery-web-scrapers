As they start their descent Cooter slips, falls off the tower and is killed instantly. As the ambulance takes the body away, Pete says, ""Well, damn, someone should go and tell his wife.""  KC says, ""OK, I'm pretty good at that sensitive stuff, I'll do it.""  Two hours later, he comes back carrying a case of Budweiser.  Pete says, ""Where did you get that beer, KC?""  ""Cooter's wife gave it to me,"" KC replies.  ""That's unbelievable, you told the lady her husband was dead and she gave you beer?""  ""Well, not exactly"", KC says. ""When she answered the door, I said to her, You must be Cooter's widow'.""  She said, ""You must be mistaken, I'm not a widow."".... then I said ""I'll bet you a case of Budweiser you are.""  Rednecks Are Good At Sensitive Stuff"
