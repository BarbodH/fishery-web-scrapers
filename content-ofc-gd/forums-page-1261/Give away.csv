40770,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 20:11:00,49,I really don't know where to post this but here goes.  I have posted photos of 22 Muskie on catch -n- forums and I'm giving away one of my books plus 2 of my buck tails.  You have t0 guess the biggest by Lenght and Weight for the book.    The smallest fish.  First right pick gets a buck tail.  The first right pick on the longest fish gets a buck tail.  Good Luck.  Bob
