40203,Jen,2007-02-26 14:56:00,833,"Oh my they make those suits big, but I am betting she is a size 0... Great picture... thanks for the laugh this morning!"
40242,SlowPoke,2007-02-26 16:56:00,2984,"Hahahaha... I got a good laugh at that one Whopper!   Hey Jen, if I tell her you said she must be size 0 she'll want to wear it all the time!!  Thanks for the replies... some good comebacks there! The suit is actually a 3X. I had tried on Nautilus 2X a llittle while ago and it was too short. The Helly fits a lot larger. I'm 6'3"" 300lbs and it fits me pretty good with room for layering. "
40289,Pigeontroller,2007-02-26 19:01:00,2793,"I hope you're happy with those Muskie Lures you bought from me...If not I'll send the money back, plus extra..."
40291,SlowPoke,2007-02-26 19:12:00,2984," LOL Dax!!! The lures are fine... hey lemme know if you want to visit them, say on the water this summer? hehehe Note to Fishdawg: I haven't seen my roller rod in the mail yet (Just kidding LOL, he probably didn't get the money until a few days ago, no need to hand deliver it   )   -Brian"

40562,SlowPoke,2007-02-27 10:15:00,2984,"LOL folks!!!  Dax, I was in Steve's (smellinfishy) 16' with Mike (MrEH) and there was more than enough room until I caught my 46""er. It was a little crowded so we drew staws and the fish lost and we put it back into the water. We decided at that point not to catch anything larger than 40""s.  -Brian"
40599,Mike the Pike,2007-02-27 13:01:00,3421,Brian forgot to mention he shops at OMAR THE TENT MAKER for all his clothes
40752,Handlebarz,2007-02-27 19:35:00,3790,Hey Dax I can tell ya that Brian is a great person to share a boat with I always give a person a 1 shot deal and Brian was invited back a second and third time(even thought we ended up not using my boat as planned) last year with a open invite anytime. You will have a great time I know we did it was like fishing with a long time friend the three of us had a blast and it was even better when we got into the fish.
40756,SlowPoke,2007-02-27 19:36:00,2984,"Yep, OMAR has a great selection for sizes but unfortunately they didn't have colours anything like yours...  ""...and here is Mike wearing a delightful yet practical little number in Lemon Meringue from the the Suzy Survival Line... adorable   ""  "
40760,SlowPoke,2007-02-27 19:51:00,2984,"Hey Mike, thanks for the endorsement! I wouldn't have been back if I couldn't say the same for you guys!  P.S. We might have that 18' Starcraft Center Console to try it out this year... I just got an email from the seller and the registration should be sorted out this week. I have to pitch it to my wife somehow tho... been an expensive week. Bought the Helly on Saturday, a Chevy Tahoe yesterday. I might have to wait til the weekend for the boat LOL.  -Brian"
40814,Handlebarz,2007-02-27 21:26:00,3790,Hey Brian just have her talk to my wife she is good about getting boats she cant say no its me that is still wanting to wait to get a new one go figure
40828,Whitefox,2007-02-27 22:03:00,9,heheh thats funny! Don't you wish that they make those things a bit smaller! Great pic! It made me laugh!             Cheers
40888,Mike the Pike,2007-02-28 00:08:00,3421, LOL  Brian Lemon Meringue I like that much better than Bite me calling me Big Bird .Sort of gives me flavor.I bought that suit just before I went to Quinte in November the problem was I could not find any XL suits it was down to the yellow one so I had to buy it.I never thought I would get a litle ribbing from the OFC ers.Its nice to know I am adorable but I would rather here it from some of the females on this board.I am thankful we are not sharing a cell together lol.Congrats on the new Truck and boat.MTP
