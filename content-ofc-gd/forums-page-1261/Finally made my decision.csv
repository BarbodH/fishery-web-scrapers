41054,SlowPoke,2007-02-28 09:00:00,2984,That sounds like a nice kicker for your PolarKraft. -Brian
41067,Rich Clemens,2007-02-28 11:05:00,3131,Sweet  !!!!!
41071,aplumma,2007-02-28 11:43:00,6896,Wow that sounds like a really nice lawnmower bud. You should be able to cut the grass in half the time and then go fishin with it.   Art

41124,solopaddler,2007-02-28 15:55:00,8605,So there really is a hot tub? I figured it was some kind of weird Red Green like contraption powered by an 8 horse Yamaha 4 stroke
