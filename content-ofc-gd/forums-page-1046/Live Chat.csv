191563,Gerritt,2008-04-23 23:01:00,6129,Usually Tuesday evenings are the ticket....  But they can happen anytime... usually after the supper hour...  All you need to do is wait till 7:30-8pm and post a thread saying you are in chat... and you will usually have a few people join in  But I have to warn you... Sometimes things get off colour.. so be sure you have your parents permission lol  G
