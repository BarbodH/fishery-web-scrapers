I'm not complaining because I caught all 8, but NikkyBobby got skunked... therefore a bad day for me... I felt guilty everytime I hooked into one lol  The top producers was a large spoon, silver and red. If anyone catches the pike that took it from me, please return it lol  Water is starting to really warm up there.  it was 63.5 degrees surface temp when we called it a day"
191213,PatrickGG,2008-04-23 02:20:00,562,"Sounds like you had a good day, Where did you guys fish at if you don't mind me asking?"
191215,BillM,2008-04-23 02:23:00,17367,/me wonders what region is open for pike fishing right now.
191216,irishfield,2008-04-23 02:25:00,26272,Lake Erie
191222,BillM,2008-04-23 02:27:00,17367,"Ahh yes!!!  Well damn, I wish I was a bit closer to Lake Erie!  63.5 degree's already?  That water must be heating up super fast."
191225,Wendel,2008-04-23 02:33:00,213,Exactly right.  Inner Bay of longpoint to be more specific.
191252,forrest,2008-04-23 04:06:00,1032,lol One way to stir it up: post pics of fish that are out of season for most and don't say where they were from.
191297,danbouck,2008-04-23 11:30:00,4380,"I be sure to return your lure this weekend  If you see a new legend boat by ""the good spot"" come say hi and I may have it!"
191372,Wendel,2008-04-23 14:33:00,213, What can you jump to if you can't jump to a conclusion? lol
191577,PatrickGG,2008-04-23 23:41:00,562,"I am Jealous! just a little over two weeks till opener up here, would be nice if you can post up some pics."
191590,Wendel,2008-04-24 00:29:00,213,"We only go the camera out once.  The first fish was probably 5 pounds, he was the biggest.  Got him the first cast figured he was the first of many on the day... we were wrong lol The rest were smaller, in the 2-3 pound range, didn't think they were worthy of a camera"
191648,Greencoachdog,2008-04-24 02:20:00,8163,  ... me wonders where the pics are?
