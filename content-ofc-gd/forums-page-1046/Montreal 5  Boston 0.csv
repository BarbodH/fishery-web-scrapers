All things considered, this should have been wrapped up in 5 games.  Boston never was and never should have been that much of a threat, especially to force a game seven.  Montreal will get past Philly's pylons but will take a bruising along the way.  The Rangers will be harder to get by.  If I'm Montreal, I'm hoping for Philly.  Rangers look really tough to beat right now."
190918,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-22 16:54:00,4399," What ever, everyone is intitled to there opinion even if its wrong! LOL  Montreal one the 2 most important games, game 1 and game 7."
190922,Stoty,2008-04-22 17:02:00,2910, I couldn't have said it better myself. LOL
191164,charlied,2008-04-23 01:09:00,584,riots are gonna continue and is gonna be really bad if they get taken out of the playoffs.
191168,Roy,2008-04-23 01:17:00,13728,"Holdfast, the only reason most folks are not jumping down your throat is that you gave a few of your years to the forces. Guess what Bud, most people have givien years of their life to things that they believed in as well. It's not a big deal Bud...it's called life. Get over it."
191174,carll2,2008-04-23 01:23:00,443,  agreed with 100%
191191,Roy,2008-04-23 01:53:00,13728,"I imagine mose folks don't want to hear any more of this. If I'm wrong, PM me."
190822,blaque,2008-04-22 13:16:00,2419,"how in the h#!! do you go out and riot after winning an opening series in the stanley cup playoffs. Round One...........A minimum of three more teams to meet, and 12 more games to play at the very least, possibly 21.....and your rioting in the streets?? Thats embarassing man, flat out ........straight up.... embarassing.........Im embarassed for you Montreal. (those involved in the celebration gone wrong) That'd be like the players going into the locker room last night and cracking out the champaigne and coming back out on the ice for a lap for the fans. A bit premature. I feel bad for those with the brain capacity or lack thereof,  to celebrate a first round win in the stanley cup playoffs like they are in the midst of overthrowing a government. These people lacked attention as children and still cant get it on their own, so they use accomplishments of someone else as an excuse to draw attention to themselves..........because they cant achieve squat on their own to get into the limelight. Their idea of an accomplishment in life is finishing the 30 pack in the parking lot before the game.......and thats not sarcasm"
190837,darsky,2008-04-22 14:00:00,586,......was at the game last nite and the first thing I noticed before going in was the MASSES of people drinking outside and the police all had blind eyes. Alcohol + crowds + Mtl playoff hockey =  A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE Mtl police are only stupid once. Next round they will adjust
190846,blaque,2008-04-22 14:17:00,2419,"I dont even know if i would call the police force stupid..........it was First round, like i said, Ida never expected a riot out of a first round win. Ill bet those fans are stupid more than once though lol ..........Stupid is as Stupid does."
190857,walleyejigger,2008-04-22 14:32:00,876,"thrilled/relieved with the win, Price truly deserved and earned the shutout, nice to see captain koivu in fine form again, the bruins and their fans should be very proud,  the rioters/looters should be very ashamed"
190871,KyleM,2008-04-22 14:54:00,218,"Yep, congrats to the Habs fans. As I stated earlier, it was OK for me to see the Habs through.  Some people in Montreal need to realize its just hockey.....why wreck stuff.  You guys are right though, dont plan on the Montreal police force taking this again."
190905,Chris,2008-04-22 16:13:00,405," Well said, fans on both sides of the fence were nervous about the outcome. Can't blame all Habs fans for the riot, most were just there to party, as always a minority of jerks ruin it for everyone.  Price stole the series in the final game....he held them in it for the 1st period and after the Habs put the second goal in you could see the Bruins starting to fade. He is a young star on the rise and the future looks bright for him. Congrats to the Habs and their fans.....it was a good battle.  Now I'm gonna go do some more crying."
