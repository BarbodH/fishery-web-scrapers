Question, I now have the onboard battery charger but I am torn on where to mount it. Do I put it under the dash on Driver's side/Passenger side? Or do I mount it under the floor near the Trolling motor battery? I know they generate a fair bit of heat, so I am kind of relectant to mount it under the floor on the bow. Or do I mount it out in the open so I can see what it is doing.....hopefully charging!??  Anyone got some ideas/suggestions ? Thanks,  FT"
191021,irishfield,2008-04-22 20:51:00,26272,Where ever you've got a decent spot and where you can see the charge level lights. Mine's right in the bow with the batteries.  
191227,Fishn Technishn,2008-04-23 02:35:00,198,"Irishfield I was thinking of putting it there, but the directions say it has to have air movement around all sides to keep it cool. Does yours get warm under the floor? Thanks for the photo, looks like a nice layout. FT"
191231,irishfield,2008-04-23 02:42:00,26272,All I can tell you is that it still works. I plug it in and the only air flow getting to it is from the fact that the hatch is sitting on the cord to plug it in..so it's open a very small crack.
191232,Garry2Rs,2008-04-23 02:43:00,1425,"You have to open the lid to reach the power cord on most boats, so prop the lid open when the charger is in use."
191236,Fishn Technishn,2008-04-23 02:51:00,198,"Irishfield, Garry2rs, thanks for the tips.    Now why didn't I think of that!!  I guess that is why I ask all these silly questions, someone here always has the simple answer!  Thanks,  FT"

191306,Billy Bob,2008-04-23 11:57:00,5865,Mine is completely out in the open and has been for 4 years without any problems. Of course it's waterproof. I mounted near the main starting battery and only had to lengthen one set of leads for the TM battery.
