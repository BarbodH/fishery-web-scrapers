190875,duber,2008-04-22 15:01:00,220,"They should tell ALL of their employees about the price matching policy.I went there with a print out of some prices of gps-sonar combos (Lowrance 520 was $130.00 cheaper somewere else) and was told that they would not price match that because they couldn't verify when it was printed off.When I told him that he could go to the website right now and verify that it was accurate, I was told ""We don't have internet access"".I have never been to a department in there that is as useless and over priced as the electronics.Guys in the fishing department have seemed good but they have a real issue with stocking baitcasters with left hand retrieve.The last time I was there I was going to drop over a thousand bucks on 2 baitcasters and a sonar.I walked out with $15.00 worth of crappie tubes."
190876,bpsbassman,2008-04-22 15:04:00,941,"I would suggest that if you are following George's Guidelines and are not getting satisfaction that you escalate the issue.  It could be that the person you are talking to isn't completely up on policy (unfortunately, happens in all businesses). I do know that BPS is a very customer focussed business.  If any of you have ever talked to George, that would be immediately obvious."
190885,duber,2008-04-22 15:24:00,220,Next time I'm going there I will be sure to get in touch with you BPSBASMAN and find out when you are working.It sounds to me like you know what it takes to keep a customer happy and are willing to go the extra mile to ensure it.If BPS had more employees like you these posts would not be floating around all the time.Good on ya for going the extra on your job!
190886,Headhunter,2008-04-22 15:27:00,5703,"I've said it before and I'll say it again... Roger is the best! He's a wonderful ambassador for the store! Heck, how can you not think that way with that smile he has? I've been very fortunate to have been in the store when Rogers is working... now that's customer service! HH"
190892,Reef Runner,2008-04-22 15:42:00,981,"Living in the GTA, I have many options available and usually do a little price hunting before hand and go to the selected retailer from there.  Did not know about the price matching policy, thanks BPSBASSMAN!  As for products, I have never tried a reel, but the rods they have are quite impressive.  I was quite happy with my 7' MH spinning rod and decided to pair up my new abu c3 with one.  When I go to BPS, I'm a freakin' kid in a candy store.  reefrunner"
190902,LeXXington,2008-04-22 16:04:00,1928,Roger you should get extra bonus for all the hardwork you do here to promote BPS  Basspro has it's ups and down's like anystore. I am just glad for the extra competition I use to hate getting ripped by CTC because they were the only ones around.  Since BPS has arrived I am much more appreciated at the smaller stores and makes it an all round better market place.  Also another big Hug for BPS is all the sponsership they do in the comunity
190934,bpsbassman,2008-04-22 17:35:00,941," Here's an interesting fact.  The U.S. sell about 7% left handed reels, whereas in Canada, it can be as high as 25%.  Doesn't help your problem Duber, but might explain why manufacturers don't supply enough lefties. So are Canadians more adaptable than Americans Don't look at me cause I'm a righty and use a right handed reel (which in theory is wrong).  Thanks for the kind comments guys."
190941,Gerritt,2008-04-22 17:56:00,6129,"Roger, Thank you for all the leg work you have done in clearing up some misconceptions about BPS!  If I could ask just one more question...though  What if a retailer does not have a website, produce flyers or magazines.. but you saw it in store and it was available at a set price... would BPS call the retailer to confirm? if so that would be awesome!!!!!! as alot of stores  do not put out flyers or catalogs like LB's does.   Again thank you for taking the time to address the concerns of our little community  Not only are you a great asset to BPS but OFC as well.  G"
190945,largemouth,2008-04-22 18:13:00,112,I prefer the professional service and friendly advise I get from FishingWorld in hamilton over BPS or LeBar's. But i enjoy the large fishtank at BPS.
190947,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-22 18:17:00,4399,  I think it`s just because 25% of Canadians reel with the wrong hand!LOL
190953,bpsbassman,2008-04-22 18:24:00,941, I have to admit that I spend a fair share of my money (and my buddy's) at Fishing World too (obviously nowhere near what I spend at BPS  ). Very knowledgable and friendly staff there as well.
191217,BillM,2008-04-23 02:25:00,17367,"I went in today to pick up the Shimano Citica/XPS rod combo as advertised on the front page of the new flyer.  All sold out..  Hopefully they get some more in soon, I'll be bugging them via phone everyday, lol"
191246,scuro,2008-04-23 03:33:00,386,"The question is, what is wrong with BP shop.  1) For a mega box that size devoted to fishing, I am often surprised that they don't have things you think a fishing store should have. 2) Higher prices 3) Staff are okay but I get the sense that they are not engaged with the customer. Sure they answer basic questions but when I go into my local fishing store, they have time for me. 4) Out of stock stuff"
191256,Ben_Daniels,2008-04-23 04:37:00,435,"Either way I think its great that BPSBASSMAN is here to answer all our questions and back up his store (not typical for retail sales associates), hope to have a chat with you sometime when I'm in the store! O yea how come you guys never have screw in worm weights?  -Ben"
190835,Garry2Rs,2008-04-22 13:59:00,1425,"I don't have as many shopping options as you big-city guys.  We live between Peterbourgh and Bancroft when in Canada and in a small city where there are three Wal-Marts, but only one real fishing tackle store, when in the USA.  Basically, if I want something that CTC or Wally-World doesn't stock I have to buy it on-line.  I get e-mail fliers from BPS on an average of once a month and they always have good sale prices on a few items I want/need.  Since they do have good sales, perhaps that's why their regular prices aren't as good as the best you can find elsewhere.  On the other hand, you can't compare a huge chain store with tons of stock-on-hand, and a reputation to uphold with some on-line guy who operates out of his basement.  As far as BPS House Brand stuff is concerned, I have had good luck with their stuff, but have never bought a BPS brand item that wasn't on sale!"
190841,bpsbassman,2008-04-22 14:05:00,941,"Here are the replies to questions from George Wallace BPS Canadian Market Manager. Hope this helps.   1) if this is a straight match, or there's an extra 10% type bonus, like at Staples – Straight match; no additional discount  2) what paperwork/proof is required to establish the competitor's price/availability – catalogue, flyer or web print out  3) if/how shipping charges are added in (if you're matching an online competitor) – do not match online prices from online retailers (only other retailers) . . . shipping is extra in any event . . . if Radio World has “x” available at $$$ we’ll match that . . . and pricing can be verified for example online.  4) the big one - how about matching the mail order prices from basspro.com? Quite simply, the cost of doing business in Canada is substantially higher than in the U.S. (much like purchasing a vehicle). Some pricing has been matched. Others in fact we are cheaper than the U.S. When we buy from Canadian distributors, we typically incur an additional cost; we support the Canadian industry for obvious reasons, but this also allows us to better serve the customer through special events such as the Classic etc. Some items when shipped across the border we incur a duty, on top of our brokerage/customs fees & transportation related costs etc. We are market competitive with our pricing. And, we also give back to the resource and those that use it. Would LeBaron’s or any other competitor match a U.S. mail order price? Yes; we’re Bass Pro Shops . . . but much like Home Depot or any other U.S. based retailer, our cost structures are different than that in the U.S. and that is reflected in the price of product. We run independent of our U.S. sister stores to some extent . . . we pay municipal, provincial and federal tax. We employ over 300 people. And, like I had made mention, something that I believe BPS does better than anybody else, bias aside, they give back; they believe in being a community partner within the realm of its giving strategy – conservation, fish & wildlife.   I picked up my Eagle unit @ Angling Outfitters for 349.00 when BPS was 599.00 would BPS have matched it? would a phone call be in order to ensure the price and that stock was available? Yes. So long as it was model for model; year for year. Not on clearance or a special close out buys. We’ve reduced some of our electronics across the board.  I would just like to know what BPS's procedure is when another shop has them beat hands down.... As I work 5 minutes from BPS... we have a low price guarantee. With 60+ ,000 SKU’s we cannot monitor market price changes on a daily basis but do our best. Ideally, we need to be presented with a sales flyer, website of the store in question etc . . . again, we do not match internet based businesses only."
190845,GBW,2008-04-22 14:17:00,8460,thank you for the prompt reply!
190848,Roy,2008-04-22 14:19:00,13728,Thank you Roger and thank you George Wallace for clearing all of that up. Very quick and succinct that was.
190867,fishinggeek,2008-04-22 14:46:00,325,"Yes thanks.  I'll be bringing my LeBaron catalogue with me every time I go to BPS now.  I hope they don't give me a hard time with it though, as some others have experienced."

190052,bpsbassman,2008-04-20 22:45:00,941," I have too. I know I'm biased, but I have found a lot of BPS/XPS equipment to be excellent!   I'm probably one of the ""clueless"" ones,   but some of your best contributours on this board are Bass Pro Staff and believe me they DO know their stuff.  Everybody doesn't know everything (although some are unbelievably knowledgable across the species).  My skill is in knowing who is the expert in the fields that I'm not experienced in and making sure the customer gets the ""right"" answer.  Sorry about your bad experiences SS"

190087,addict,2008-04-20 23:55:00,475,recieved one of thier rods free with a reel purchase slapped a pfluger presidend baitcaster on it and i love it.sweet setup the rod isnt very pricey but its im7 graphite has great action and it was free.bought a couple of thier soft tackle bags and im very happy with them.as for thier prices i would rather go to lebarons.
190093,OhioFisherman,2008-04-21 00:17:00,6623,"Most reel brands are no longer made in the country they started out in and developed, a lot are now made in China. I had a couple of the BPS brand Abu imitations synthetic reel seat instead of a metal one and even with some playing around with them casting quality was irregular, so they were sold.  The gripe I hear is they don`t hold up compared to say a Shimano, same with the Zebco brands(Quantum). No factual experience with Quantums have bought a Zebco in 40 +years  Seeing what the pro`s use is iffy, they probably get new ones on demand for cheap or free. Us folks that buy them want something that is going to last.  Just like a car different experiences with each one for a lot of people."
190171,BillM,2008-04-21 02:52:00,17367,"I've had mixed experiences at BPS.  Looking for a fishfinder for my dad worked out ok, but most of the people behind that counter couldn't answer my questions.. I went back home, did MORE research then came back in and picked one up.  On the other hand, I talked to a guy behind the reel counter for atleast an hour before I purchased my Shimano Citica 100DSV.  He was extremely helpful and didn't Bull me when he couldn't answer one of my questions.  He simply found a person that could...  Anytime I go back in there I make a point to see if he is working or not and have a quick chat with him.  Didn't try to push the BPS brand on me at all (which I have had some sales people do)..  All in all great store, selection is great and the prices aren't to bad (depends on the item, I find they are very overpriced on reels)"
190174,douG,2008-04-21 02:58:00,2693,"Great time to pick up some winter clothing at clearance prices, got a nice hooded polar fleece jacket at 60% off.  But pancake downrigger balls at $54?"

One of their (now discontinued - gotta love 'progress') house brand topwaters was really unique, and is one of my best producers.  I've had pretty good luck asking questions of the guys in the fishing dept.  Marine electronics...well, I guess I have a talent for finding new guys on their first day unsupervised.  Gotta echo the pricing concerns.  Often WAY higher than retail - I can point you at an MSRP $200 item with a $280 price tag on it.  I don't mind a buck extra here and there to pay for enjoying the nifty fish tank, but $80 on one $200 item....I don't spend THAT much time watching the gar."
