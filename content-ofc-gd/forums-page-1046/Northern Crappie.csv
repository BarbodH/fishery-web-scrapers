191586,Mike01,2008-04-24 00:10:00,378,What is the closest lake to North Bay that has crappie in it?  Is there anything within a 2 hour drive.  Thanks Mike
191618,MuddyWater,2008-04-24 01:23:00,218,if i was in north bay i think i would have my hands full with other fish rather then crappies
191637,Mike01,2008-04-24 02:04:00,378,Yeah I know...I've caught almost every other fish that swims in Ontario except crappie.  Thought it might be cool to catch some.
