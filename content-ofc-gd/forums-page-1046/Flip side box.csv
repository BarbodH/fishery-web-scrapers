I got the one with three regular trays and one “flip-side” tray. I don’t really get the concept of the flippy thing. The compartments seem awful small and I am wondering what they were designed to fit. Can anyone shed some light? Thanks, Jim"

I think the idea is that you can put the hook side of the spinnerbait in one of the compartments and the blades in the other.  So when you flip one of the rows up the baits are all hanging vertically.  Now if this makes no sense then maybe i'm thinking of a different box.
