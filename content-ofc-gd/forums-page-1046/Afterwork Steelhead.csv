191250,troutologist,2008-04-23 03:47:00,951,The rough part about working in downtown SSM is that Im almost 15 minutes from good steelhead fishing. 2 minutes of driving and a 10 minute walk and theres the rapids. My buddy got 2 tiny bows and 2 whitefish while I caught this fish. Still early yet but with gas pushing $1.30 downtown fishing is pretty good.

191329,ccmtcanada,2008-04-23 12:49:00,7971,Nice looking fish!  I hear you about downtown fishing....most of our fishing is done with a main road only a few minutes away as well.  I find that fishing after work is the BEST way to wind down afer a stressful day.
191362,MJL,2008-04-23 13:58:00,2427,A stunning fish.  Congrats
191379,troutologist,2008-04-23 14:48:00,951,"Thanks for the comments guys Im try to get out everyday either before or after work, lately getting ready for the turkey season has cut down on fishing some.  Mike thanks again....I put some Xcountry ski wax on the zippers and that has got them moving better. The pack certainly works nice wading way out in the rapids. I think I was nearly in US waters last night..."
