189238,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-18 18:37:00,835,try google them?
189251,setomonkey,2008-04-18 19:01:00,872,"Check out this site, lots of used and out-of-print books. See if they have your title, as that will tell you what the going price is.  Alibris  Otherwise, I'd suggest taking them to a few different used/antique booksellers and see what they will offer you.  Mike"
