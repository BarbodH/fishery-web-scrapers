190031,Maverick,2008-04-20 21:32:00,371,"I was thinking of getting a MotorGuide Pro Seroes bow mount trolling motor. They are on sale at bass pro and I was reading reviews that were saying the Gator Mount 360 doesn't hold the motor properly and the motor spins in the mount. Are these just a few isolated cases or are they that bad? If anybody has one, please chime in and tell me what you think of them. Thanks!"
190091,addict,2008-04-21 00:01:00,475,"spend the extra dough and get a minnkota.ive heard alot of bad things about motorguide.most of the pro run minnkota,the way i see it if your gonna spend 500 why not 800 and get something thats gonna last.my friend basskickers runnin a 55lb minnkota maxum and its a sweet motor powerful and durable.after fishing with him all last year it sold me to get the 70lb maxum had her out fri and today just out for a boat ride man this motors got balls cant wait till bass season."

190279,Maverick,2008-04-21 13:42:00,371,"Yeah, I would like to spend more on it but on a student budget I can't really. I think I will look out for a used Minn Kota."
190283,Roy,2008-04-21 13:47:00,13728,Absolutely nothing wrong with MotorGuide products.
190395,addict,2008-04-21 17:39:00,475,not tryin to knock motorguide but having owned a 30lb tiller motorguide and it burned out.i decided to try minkota this time they just seem to be constructed better.buy whatever u can afford on a student budget any motor is better than no motor remember boat control and covering water are key elements to success.
190869,legacey,2008-04-22 14:52:00,127,I just had the 70# Pro put on my boat.....replacing a 43# MG.  I never had a problem with the old one and just gave it to my buddy for his boat.  Cheers
190881,duber,2008-04-22 15:13:00,220,No problems with my motorguide yet.
190956,Maverick,2008-04-22 18:29:00,371,"Good to hear all the positive comments, I think I will try them if they have them in stock when I am down there.  Thanks for the replies guys!!"
