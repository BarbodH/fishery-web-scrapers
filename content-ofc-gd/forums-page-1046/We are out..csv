191208,ccmtcanada,2008-04-23 02:12:00,7971,Awww crap....I have Ovechkin in the hockey playoff pool....
191286,Chris,2008-04-23 10:48:00,405,The Caps were ripped off big-time. Another chintzy ref call. Man it sucks when the refs decide a series.
191309,blaque,2008-04-23 12:08:00,2419,"I dunno, any other day i would say ya gotta call that trip..............it was only chintzy that he called it because of the numerous infractions leading up to that call that were let go. Then the guys have this sense of ""hey, this is the flow the refs are allowing"" and then out of nowhere, they decide to bring the whistle back out of their pocket......ya just cant do that. Its like telling a kid no cookies before dinner, then one day you make an exception and allow a cookie......from that day forward they want a cookie for dinner all the time and are confused as to why you are back to saying NO!"
191354,Casey123,2008-04-23 13:41:00,461, You and me both!  I was heavy on players from Washinton and Anehiem
191360,Stoty,2008-04-23 13:54:00,2910," I agree, when you stick your leg out and trip a guy....thats a penalty. Doesnt matter if its the 1st game of the season, or Game 7 in the playoffs. The officiating was a little hit and miss though, thats for sure. But then again....not all the goals in the series were PP goals, so the refs arent to blame.  What a MACHINE Ovechkin is though. Crosby who?"
191382,BillM,2008-04-23 14:57:00,17367,"You can't put the whistle away during regular time, then bring it out in OT...  Ref's ruined that one."
