All of the switches are live to the battery and I am worried that I could hit a switch by accident (say, while cleaning it) and the bilge pump would be running for days by the time I found it. Should I think about wiring in a master switch? Do other boats come with a master? Has anyone done this, or am I being paranoid? Thanks, Jim"

My auto bilge kicked on and stayed on.  I have no idea for how long.  Went out in the boat a few days later and noticed I was not pumping out water.  Checked the pump, it had a huge hole melted in it from running dry for so long.  I now have a manual pump to prevent this from happening again.  Although the auto was nice because you didn't have to think about it."

Remember to pull the drainplug when it is on the trailer so it can drain rain or snowmelt out. If your boat overnights in the water make sure that your bilge pump is in automatic and is hot even when the master switch is off. The bilge pump is the only thing that will save the boat if you get rain or a waves come over the transom from wind or another boats wake.  Art
