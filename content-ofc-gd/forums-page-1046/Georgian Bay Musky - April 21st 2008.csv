190839,Joey,2008-04-22 14:04:00,9122,Looks like a nice day out there Wayne.  Maybe the musky was afraid of your humongous boat    and keeled at the sight of it.  Joey
190840,Headhunter,2008-04-22 14:05:00,5703,"Nice report guys! BillM, you couldn't have picked a better OFNer to break the ice with! (pun intended!) I will admit I am a little surprised that Wayne let you use that Bomber! It was my understanding that Terry had dibs on Bombers in Wayne's boat! HH"
190915,kickingfrog,2008-04-22 16:48:00,8333,"Kind of ironic that when Glen and I were out with you late October/ early November is was mid 20's as well.  Hey Bill, I'm glad to see I'm not the only jinks in Wayne's boat.  Maybe I'll get a second chance."
190982,bucktail,2008-04-22 19:32:00,1857,You cant count that fish for the OFC tourney!!!!!!!!!!!
190995,irishfield,2008-04-22 20:01:00,26272,Yah I know Darren... it's a shame the tourney doesn't start 'til May 1st ! LOL
191011,Joey,2008-04-22 20:29:00,9122," No kidding, I found that out after I took pics with the tourney sign in it while in Niagara  Joey"
191012,irishfield,2008-04-22 20:31:00,26272,Well you're not the only one Hun.... Bill M showed up proud as punch that he'd remembered his Team #5 Paperwork! lol
191108,GbayGiant,2008-04-22 23:27:00,1780,"Wayne, I seen a 52-54"" floater up here last year around the same time and wondered the same thing ? maybe it is just old age."
191110,Gerritt,2008-04-22 23:32:00,6129,  LOL  G
191118,fishindevil,2008-04-22 23:43:00,6254,"Nice fishing trip/report wayne,  too bad about not getting in to those spring lakers,and what a shame bout that big ole musky !!!!   cheers"
191194,krawler,2008-04-23 01:53:00,167,"I fished similar waters this past weekend towards beckwith and christian island.  i was looking for lakers out deep near the surface or on adjacent sand flats but no luck also tried in shallow flatlining and boards for bows but no luck again.  i think the fish were around, just the intense heat was shutting things down.  found a scum line off the southern tip of christian in 40 fow and found fish 20-25 ft down.  dont know what they were, i was flatlinging most of the day didint have any equipment that could get my baits deep enough.  any idea what those fish could have been?  back at it this weekend after a few hours on the local rivers."
191228,BillM,2008-04-23 02:37:00,17367,"We pretty much found the same thing, all kinds of fish in the 25-80ft range.  We noticed most of the fish were suspended mid way down or hugging tight to the bottom.  We marked a lot of fish, no doubt about it... I still think the water was to cold (39-40 degree average).  I think when the water gets closed to the magical 50-55 degree mark the Lakers will be doing what they should be doing"
191237,krawler,2008-04-23 02:53:00,167,"Found an area on sunday near christian island near the mouth of a local creek where water temps ranged from 50-58 in an area approx 5 sq.miles.  this area is no more than 20 ft deep, no fish whatsoever.  hoping this weekend might do the trick, will be trying out some leadcore off the big boards."
191240,douG,2008-04-23 03:06:00,2693,What?
190654,irishfield,2008-04-22 01:49:00,26272,"What a glorious day to take the seasons first boat ride. BillM met me at my house for 8:30 this morning and we headed for the Pete Peterson launch in Midland. Boat fired right up, Bill parked the truck/trailer and then jumped from the boat launch pier to the boat, since the wharf isn't in yet, and we were off!  Species being hunted was Ice out Lakers and I had a place in mind to start the shallow troll beside deep water. As we arrived we netted this instead of our targetted species. A good 52"" if not 54"" ! and thick. No marks or apparent reason for it's demise.        So we left it to let mother nature take it's course and headed off trolling long lines. Had my favourite laker spoon out on the 10'6 Talora    and Bill had out Terry's favourite Walleye plug... the Bomber A ! LOL    Shortly into our troll, between a couple rocks in the Gin Islands, Bill's line took a good short rip and it wasn't bottom. Was a great sound... just too bad we never heard it again. I figure we trolled a good 20 miles. Stopped in one spot and tried some vertical jigging, as we were marking tons of fish in 70/80FOW between 40 and 60 feet down. Nadda. We marked lots of fish in many places.. but nothing was biting. Water temp is only 39.4F in most places and we found a windward shoreline in deep water that was 44F for only about 200 feet.. then went back to 39. Suggests to me that the deeper water is warmer than the surface and the wave action/steep shoreline brought it up in this one spot.. and possibly why it appears the lakers are still down at 40 to 60 feet.  I snagged bottom once.. so we were testing the draft of the boat a couple times!!  Amazing how Giant's Tomb always looks so close.. but it took us a few hours to get to it at 1.8 MPH...    Good pile of ice up on it's shore and some ice floating off the West point still    Ended our fishing around 5:30, after trolling the full south shore of Giant's Tomb Island, and then blasted off for home..dogging floating objects all the way. Loaded the boat about 6pm.... perfectly first shot I might add !  Was a great day on the water with another new OFC'r. I've lost track of how many I've met this way and still have yet to be disappointed in fishing partners. Hope it continues that way!  One thing I must say though... it's sure gonna be a suntan lotion year. I could do an advertisment as a Delmonte tomato. Sure glad I left my sweater on.. so only the backs of my hands are red and my entire face/ears/neck etc. Gonna hurt about 3am I think!"
190660,danbouck,2008-04-22 01:53:00,4380,I bet it felt nice to get back in the boat!
190664,Casey123,2008-04-22 01:54:00,461,"An OOS Musky, oh the humanity! "
190666,Terry,2008-04-22 01:56:00,14456,great to get out and start the season
190693,Joeytier,2008-04-22 02:28:00,3990,I'd say that musky just died of old age.
190697,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 02:32:00,2710,Winter is hard on all fish. For scientific purposes it would have been nice to harvest the head. Oh well what can you do.
190702,Roy,2008-04-22 02:38:00,13728,Wash your net out carefully.  Glad you had a good day.
190710,Gerritt,2008-04-22 02:44:00,6129,Wayne... that report certainly beats me sitting at my office anyday!!!..  That fish looks like it has been dead for a bit... natural causes such as old age?? your thoughts?  G
190714,irishfield,2008-04-22 02:49:00,26272,"No idea G. Water's a tad deep though that area to be lack of oxygen I'd think. Wasn't overly decomposed. Could have been frozen in the ice for the winter though. Could have been caught ice fishing and stuffed back down the hole. Been a south wind for days.. so it could have come from anywhere Port McNicol way out. Just hope it's not the follower that I had, early in the fall, when fishing with Glen and Rob."
190716,Roy,2008-04-22 02:52:00,13728, It's not immediately evident Gerritt. He may have been pushed or perhaps suicide. The autopsy should clear  up the mystery.
190718,irishfield,2008-04-22 02:55:00,26272,  Guess I should have picked it up and delivered it to Bruce Ward at the OMNR.
190762,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-22 07:26:00,1183,Sounds like you had great day cruising..  didn't you already lose an ear to frost bite....hheeelllloooo
190763,Carp,2008-04-22 08:03:00,1488,Good to hear you got out Wayne. Too bad the fish weren't co-operating.  That's a big lunge.
190772,b2kptbo,2008-04-22 11:07:00,1505,"Good that the boat's running well, too bad about the fishing, next time..."
190779,mattyk,2008-04-22 11:33:00,2110,sounds like a good day on the water.
190787,2 tone z71,2008-04-22 11:54:00,1311,nice NICE  is all I can say
190789,BillM,2008-04-22 12:03:00,17367,"What an excellent day out on the water.  Wayne it was great meeting you and you kept me in stitches the entire day!  The fish were definitely not in the mood today, but they were down there.  I think once the water warms up a bit, that spot we found at Giants Tomb is going to be deadly..  The next time we vertical jig, I think we should use something other then rigger rods   We definitely got a 'A' for effort and a little sunburn to go along with it.  This was my first outing with a OFC'r and I couldn't have picked a better person.  Wayne showed me the in's and out of the bigger water on Gbay, gave me a few hints as to were to go for some 'skis when the time comes, and also answered the 1000 questions I had for him yesterday.  Again, a big thanks to you Wayne, it was very much appreciated.  I had a great time and hopefully we can get out on the water together in the near future. (Imagine if we actually caught some fish?  )"
190793,ccmtcanada,2008-04-22 12:09:00,7971,Nice to see the open water reports again!  Too bad about that muskie....and the lack of live fish.  How's the sunburn today????
190796,BillM,2008-04-22 12:12:00,17367,"I had a nice base from being in Florida for 2 weeks, no issues here.  Unfortunately Wayne is a little more fair skinned then me"
190805,irishfield,2008-04-22 12:38:00,26272," Nancy.. my mother's still alive... I don't need two !   Fishing went exactly as planned.. catching would have been a bonus, but compared to what most here were doing... well..   I slept through most of the night.. well except when I rolled onto either ear that is !"
190810,lew,2008-04-22 12:53:00,12767,"Like I always say Wayne, you don't need to catch a fish to have a great day of fish'n.  Good to see you boyz had a good day on the bay"
190812,bigbuck,2008-04-22 12:57:00,2449,"It would have been good to send the cleithrum (sp.) bone from the head of that musky to Dr. Casselman who's studying muskies in Ontario. If anyone finds a dead muskie, keep that in mind. You can probably get more info from Muskies Canada as to where to send the head or if someone will pick it up from you."
190818,BillM,2008-04-22 13:08:00,17367,"Wayne, mentioned we were both sissies for not picking the muskie up."
190820,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 13:11:00,2710,Youd have to get MNR to pick it up. Ive discussed this with them before and if its out of season you can be charged.
190829,snag,2008-04-22 13:35:00,1932,"I guess I'm a little disappointed in you.  I've seen you preach to newbies about proper musky gear (net, pliers, snips, etc.)  Where was the defibrillator?  Where?  Shame.  Shame"
