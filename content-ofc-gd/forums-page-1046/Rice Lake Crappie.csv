191299,Curtis,2008-04-23 11:43:00,83,Hi Guys  I was just wondering if anyone could give me some tips on fishing crappies in Rice lake.  I will probably be launching out of Harwood on the south east end of the lake.  I was thinking there maybe some failsafe spots or area's on the lake that always hold these fish or a certain type of area i should be looking for when fishing them... I have a sellection of minature crannkbats an tubes and jigs. ect.. So i think i am good for baits i just dont know what to look for when it comes to the prime crappie locations..  Thanks!  Curtis

Think...""Where is the warmest water?"" and ""Where will the minnows hold?"" The Crappie will be close to the minnows... They feed upwards, so set your bobber at two feet or three feet deep to start. Fish shallow and work deeper...When you catch one Crappie, you can bet that there are more in the same area. Now try moving the bobber deeper or shallower and try different baits etc."
