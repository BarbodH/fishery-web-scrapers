190387,pikehunter,2008-04-21 17:27:00,1659, Ya but the standard system still makes more sense to many of us and it is easy for some to relate what is good gas mileage and what isn't. The only good thing about expressing it in metric is that there is no guessing if one is talking about miles per imperial gallon or US gallon.

This is with over 200hp under the hood, a much bigger car and loaded up with my work tools.  Don't go running out and buy one though, the car has had too many problems to list (mostly steering related), but I think GM has a winner with this 3.5L V-6 drivetrain engine and tranny have had no work done at almost 135,000 km (and goes like snot, but mileage is definetely related to foot weight)."

Right now my daily driver is a 2006 Buick Allure V6 and I get 30 MPG combined and my truck is a 2007 Dodge Durango V8 and I can nurse 21 MPG on the Hwy out of it. I would not consider buying a compact unless I could get a minimum of 40MPG out of it.  Like Jer said I am surprised by some of the poor gas mileage that some of the small cars are getting maybe a combination of driving habits and misleading ratings from the manufactures.
