191619,danbouck,2008-04-24 01:24:00,4380,
191633,BillM,2008-04-24 01:45:00,17367,"Ah damn, now I feel like a dumbass.  Thanks for pointing out the obvious Dan   Perhaps these lures will help skyrocket Team 5 to victory?"
191635,irishfield,2008-04-24 01:47:00,26272,Yah.. good luck with that Bill !! lol
191641,Ryan Landry,2008-04-24 02:10:00,128,"The lures will arrive in about 3 weeks. I will let every one know when I recieve them.  p.s. I am still missing 1 e-mail.  Thanks,  Ryan Landry"

168076,Toronto_Angler,2008-03-06 04:00:00,698, Always a fan of a shad runner/crankbait
168085,trapshooter,2008-03-06 05:12:00,1234,"Sure, I'll give it a go...I want in.  How about the Protege?"
168141,largemouth,2008-03-06 13:28:00,112,"I can try the impulse or titan and give a report, so count me in."
168146,BillM,2008-03-06 13:34:00,17367,I want in!!  lol   K-9 sounds like fun.
168149,ranger520vx,2008-03-06 13:38:00,164,im in.topwater kinda guy.
168176,capt bruce,2008-03-06 14:46:00,820,"great offer and maybe we can learn a little from this , Im late but if theres still room im in .."
168179,kickingfrog,2008-03-06 14:48:00,8333,"On a side note (or back to the origin of the post???) Yes all lures are designed for anglers, because even if it is the ""best lure ever"" if no one buys it it can't catch fish.  Most, if not all, fish are coloured on the top/side and white on the bottom. Very few of them however poses phosphorescence of any kind.  Just some observations."
168180,yellowboat,2008-03-06 14:56:00,211,I'll take a black Impulse if they are still avalible.
168186,OhioFisherman,2008-03-06 15:17:00,6623,"Just from my own observations color can be very important and not at all logical. Fished the Georgian Bay years ago and a black buzzbait or jitterbug out produced a white buzzbait or perch colored jitterbug in clear water during the day.  Fished East Harbor down here, me and a partner throwing the same plastic worm different colors, he had 4 fish landed me without a hit throwing to the same spots. I switched colors to his and started catching fish, clear shallow water. A lot of times I will change colors before the type of lure.  All the baitfish I have seen were light on the bottom darker on top, I favor that pattern unless I am trying to imitate crawfish or gobies, then all dark is good. Night time I think all the are doing is sensing movement , feeling vibrations, chasing shadows, I don`t worry much about color at night but tend to go with the program, dark lures at night.  Much more success on baits that aren`t perceived as night time lures at night over noisy surface lures, jig and pig, texas rigged worm worked for me."
168194,bbog,2008-03-06 15:35:00,665,I want in - if not too late. Impulse would be my choice to test/provide feedback.
168212,Ryan Landry,2008-03-06 16:44:00,128,"Ok,  So it looks like we will go with the 11 people above and Gerritt who sent a pm.  Here is the lure list  1. Shallow shad runner 2. Counterstrike 3.

There will be more lure tests in the future, so If you missed out on this one don't worry there will be more.  Thanks,  Ryan"
168220,capt bruce,2008-03-06 17:11:00,820,"Thanks for the great chance to put some of my pet theories to the test. I believe that colors are very important to turn on inactive fish , active fish are easy to fool (or should I sat easier) and I have proven it many times on the charter boat when the bite was good I would cut a spoon shape from a beer can punch a hole at either end and with a split ring , a swivel and a hook put it down on the rigger and it would catch as many as any high priced NK (got me a few nice tips doing this , would tell about the old native guide that taught me how to cut the special shape lol) but when the bite was slow I would spend hours at the back of the boat changeing up colors and sizes  , trolling speads etc. to get a few in the box ."
168224,kickingfrog,2008-03-06 17:23:00,8333,"WoooHooo... I'm involved in an experiment that doesn't involve mind controlling drugs or electrodes...   ...Wait, did I say too much???"
168227,largemouth,2008-03-06 17:33:00,112,"well done Ryan! I am looking forward to trying them out, thanks."

170081,GbayGiant,2008-03-11 20:38:00,1780,Just got home. Email sent.
167458,irishfield,2008-03-04 20:35:00,26272,"So as I browsed a couple stores today and brought home my new finds to put in my tackle boxes.... anyone ever notice that all the ice fishing jigs have the added glow paint dots/glitter and what have you on the TOP. Not the bottom, that the fishies see, to come up and hit ?  "
167466,Spiel,2008-03-04 20:49:00,9065,"....LOL, of course they do Wayne, fish don't buy lures."
167467,irishfield,2008-03-04 20:50:00,26272,
167472,bbog,2008-03-04 20:52:00,665,The bait suppliers are goin' be pi**ed at you for letting out the secret
167474,Terry,2008-03-04 20:57:00,14456,"yup but we don't care,   he with the most lures wins"
167480,LeXXington,2008-03-04 21:04:00,1928,Its called Jewlery for the outdoors person..
167490,Sinker,2008-03-04 21:13:00,8692,I also notice on jigging spoons.....like a buckshot for example.....the eye on the spoon is at the top of the spoon.......I always take off the hooks so the eyes are where the hook is. Ever seen a fish grab its lunch by the tail?  Sinker
167495,Landlocked,2008-03-04 21:50:00,171,"Reminds me of my buddies classic line ""if you can't outfish them you better out-equip them"""
167564,robinwood,2008-03-04 23:56:00,28,"lures cathching fishermen(women)  So in BPS on Sunday - in the arbogast bin- thought I might buy a new shiny Hula Popper, I have 5 - they look real great from the top - but the bottom is either all yellow or all white alreday have 4 like that!- plus 1 all black fish only see the bottom (don't they?) so probably plain unpainted white plastic would be just as effective - I passed !"
167574,GbayGiant,2008-03-05 00:16:00,1780,"Yep action over paint any day. It's funny over the years making wood baits (only 3 or 4 years so far) You have to water test your baits before paint and epoxy to make sure they run true. I've caught a couple pike and had some follows by musky with nothing but a wood paint job.  And if you go to lure building sites lot's of guys report this all the time, and in reality 90% of fish have a white bottom so really pretty much every lure should have a white bottom with green and black for most species, but hey it looks good and gives guys confidence so it can't hurt.  I just looked up, good point Robin,lol."
167621,Casey123,2008-03-05 01:39:00,461," I wasn't going to say anything but now UI can't resist.....  Sunday me and the misses were at BPS, we wanted to buy a new gas auger and an Aqua View, the store was packed, we didn't see what we needed right away, so off we went for some help. Some yo yo manger in a white shirt was too busy talking to 2 other Staff members about his Face Book Page (by the way I hate face book), to help us out with a $1000.00 give or take, purchase. So we finally found some lady who was posing as a staffer, we asked her for some help, she looked my wife squarley in the face and said..""I work in jewlery, you will have to find someone else to help you""  Needless to say we left with out spending 2 cents, we will never go back to that place, we will continue to do our shopping at independant stores, even if it costs us a few dollars more, the service is worth it....especially when you get free vests, eh Jerry?"
167670,shane,2008-03-05 02:44:00,652,"  I remember reading an article a long time ago about black lures.  This guy would paint all his lures black.  His reasoning was, it's all in the action and seeing that silhouette.  And black made the best silhouette...especially looking up from below.  Makes sense to me.............but I'm not running out to get a can of black spraypaint."
167785,eagsfan93,2008-03-05 14:52:00,15,"Yep, there is no doubt that the companies make lures to attract fisherman, I dont think that all these detailed colours really make a difference to the fish."
167789,danbo,2008-03-05 14:57:00,2646,The light hits your lure from above..the glitter reflects the light thus attracting the little fishy..
167849,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-05 18:49:00,1351,"i dont think the colours matter all too much, it is more of the pattern on the lure and the action of it.. that matters to the fish.. the colours on the bait IS to attract the fisherpeople.. hahhaha"
167884,Rich Clemens,2008-03-05 20:35:00,3131,As much stuff as you seem to 'pick up' .... you're gonna need yourself a bigger boat my friend.
167945,walleyejigger,2008-03-05 23:39:00,876,"color on lures is just as usefull as color on a car, and we all know thats real important  -I bought a new car. Oh really what kind? -A red one."
167963,Ryan Landry,2008-03-06 00:07:00,128,"Maybe we should do a little experiment! (please read my entire post before posting)  I will have some of our lures made in all black on our next order. Lets choose 7 of the hard lure types ( first 7 people to choose 1 type each ) and type it in this thread.  Lures are here - www.hammerheadlures.com  Then I will select 10 people who will each get a set of 7 custom all black Hammerhead lures             (for free of course).  All we need in exchange is a small report from each of the exeptees of this experiment with your thoughts and findings In a new thread we will create sometime in july.  All I ask is please don't volunteer for this if you are not going to follow through with it.   With all that said, I personally think that black will be "" just another color"" it will work well on some days and not on others. And better in some bodies of water than others.   P.S. The first 10 people to post in this thread ""I want In"" will be ""In"".  Thanks,  Ryan"
167966,irishfield,2008-03-06 00:16:00,26272,"Ryan... the first place I noticed this ""colour dot"" on the top was your ice jigs! LOL  I'll let someone else play the ""black"" game... while I try out all the other pretty colours!"
167969,Ryan Landry,2008-03-06 00:23:00,128, The ice jigs hang vertically so in that case it's more of a back and front thing

168070,GbayGiant,2008-03-06 03:44:00,1780,"I want in !  I could try the swim baits or spinners out, I don't see any pics on the site but those are what I could give a good go.  Or the ""Counter Strike"" in the cranks."
