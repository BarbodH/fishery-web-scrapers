Can anyone suggest another marina on Erie that is open and rents.  looking to do some pike fishing.  Thanks  Steve"
190662,chickenhawk,2008-04-22 01:54:00,612,i know the old cut rents boats i believe....and i think funny farm marina also rents out pontoon boats....not sure if they rent too many boats before opening day though....i always rent from Sandboy....Wayne has always been really good...
190667,danbouck,2008-04-22 01:56:00,4380,Old cut is closed right now as well as the other marinas I believe. I don't think you will have any luck until bass opener. But keep calling around you never know. PM Wendel he was down on the weekend for some pike!
190742,Rich,2008-04-22 03:33:00,3927,"If your boat rental plans don't work out, there are some shore fishing spots for pike down there. Popular starting points are Port Rowan and Big Creek."
190749,chickenhawk,2008-04-22 04:09:00,612,Rich brings up a good point.....the mouth of big creek has always produced well for pike where the causeway crosses over the river....i've also seen some fairly big carp caught down there.....heck you can even catch pike in the channels of all the marinas down there.....anyways good luck  Hawk
190774,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-22 11:23:00,2050,i'll see if I can dig up any info for you today!  I'm planning to go down saturday morning but I only have my personal pontoon boat...otherwise i'd invite you along!
190833,steve_paul,2008-04-22 13:58:00,658,"The fella who rents the pontoons is located in front of the Boathouse restaurant in Port Rowan - as others have said not sure if they are in the water yet for renting or not.  You could maybe give the Boathouse a call (as far as I know, owned by the same people) and see 519-586-9316."
191060,chickenhawk,2008-04-22 22:28:00,612,they also rent them from Funny Farm marina.......as i mentioned earlier but like these guys said im not too sure if they rent too many boats before opening day of bass....
