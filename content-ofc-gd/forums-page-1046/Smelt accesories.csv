The last time I went, my friends forgot my net and everything! I went to get the car and they loaded everything but my stuff!!  Anyways, I want to buy another 6 ft thingy with the net. Does anyone know where I can buy one in Toronto? I think I checked last year at BPS and they didn't have any.  Also I'd like to know if anyone has any word if the smelts are running. If so? PM me."

191416,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-04-23 16:45:00,0,Great! I think they start up there and then move south? So I think I may have to wait another week? I might go check it out anyways. Thanks for the heads up!
