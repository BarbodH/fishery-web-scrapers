191365,MJL,2008-04-23 14:04:00,2427,"Fantastic catch.  Regardless of size, it's no doubt a special fish."
191385,wallyboss,2008-04-23 15:05:00,1095,"Nice fish for sure!!!    Still wondering why we always have to read about  ""Mine is bigger than yours""  Instead of bragging that you caugght a bigger one, just post a picture and we can all comment on what a nice fish you caught, cause without a picture it's all hearsay."
191398,Sebastian,2008-04-23 15:53:00,208,Im not bragging that mine is bigger or anything like. My personal best up to now is 15.2lbs. Im just wondering if there is another picture of the fish from further back so we can get a more accurate look at it. I have a few pictures where 10lbers look like they're 25lbers because of the angle or short distance to the camera. Its a solid fish but i wouldnt mind seeing a different angle of the fish from further away.
191408,fishinggeek,2008-04-23 16:25:00,325,"  I'm with you on this one.  I couldn't care less what it weighs, or who caught one bigger.  Nice fish, nice picture, and nice report is all I need."
191418,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-04-23 16:52:00,0,WOW! What a monster rainbow! Very impressive fish!
191423,blaque,2008-04-23 17:00:00,2419,The fish is a CHUNK!! The guy holding it...........his elbows are to his side. The head on it is monstrous as is the tail section. Awesome fish no matter how close the camera was.
191538,chickenhawk,2008-04-23 21:33:00,612,i'd say! wish i could take the measurements for a pig like that....then it would be on my wall....all in all a trophy fish...by anyones standards
191540,Cookslav,2008-04-23 21:41:00,1457,Thats a beauty! I'd love to see few more like that on my line...no doubt  PS. Welcome Back J.B.
190755,chickenhawk,2008-04-22 04:45:00,612,"Well.....call me a liar if you would like but this fish was actually caught...and I am sure you can tell where it was caught.....I did not catch this...nor did I know the guy who caught this fish....it was caught by a friend of a friend and apparently that was his first year ever steelheading!! LOL some guys fish their whole life to catch a fish like this.....some are just luckier than others I guess....but still BIG fish.....  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c.../WSIBpg7001.jpg  Here are a couple pictures of my most recent outings....as you can see I haven't been out in quite a while and the last time I did go we forgot to bring a camera....oh well plenty of fish porn coming after the weekend...  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...79776_45761.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...79777_50261.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...38509_20261.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...38511_23571.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...38542_17611.jpg  Till next time,  Hawk"
190756,smbhunter,2008-04-22 04:59:00,186,WOW! That's a big fish.
190758,jonnybass,2008-04-22 05:44:00,346,"Was that fish weighed... if not, do you have an estimate of the weight? That's gotta be close to a record!  I lost one at the mouth of the Ganny that had to be over 20... so I know that there are some monsters swimming around!"
190764,Carp,2008-04-22 08:06:00,1488,Very thick fish.
190777,mattyk,2008-04-22 11:32:00,2110,nice looking steelie!
190780,canadian_copper,2008-04-22 11:33:00,925,DEFINATELY A TRUE BEAST!!! GOOD GENETICS THERE!!! I HOPE THAT 1 SWAM AWAY TO PRODUCE MORE THAT SIZE!!! NICE COLOURS ON THE OTHERS!!
190782,silveradosheriff,2008-04-22 11:42:00,1025,Holy Cow - what a monster!
190799,lew,2008-04-22 12:15:00,12767,"Awesome fish, that thing is a true brute !!  Congrats to the angler"
190801,fatherof3,2008-04-22 12:27:00,1769,awesome fish
190815,Mike01,2008-04-22 12:59:00,378,wow...thats a monster
190816,wuchikubo,2008-04-22 13:06:00,1114,"Wow, definitely a nice fish!"
190836,Minnow,2008-04-22 14:00:00,177,Biggest Steelhead I have ever seen!
190852,MuddyWater,2008-04-22 14:24:00,218,thats a big one for sure but your elbows are pretty straight meaning your pushing that fish in the cameras face  nice one though i got a 26lb way upstream in ganny land. my cousin a couple years ago got about a 25lb out of b-ville took forever on 4lb line lol!
190856,Riparian,2008-04-22 14:31:00,269, Hmmm... not sure you read the post entirely before you commented.
190925,kickingfrog,2008-04-22 17:11:00,8333,That it is a very nice fish.  How about this one:  http://www.lakediefenbakertourism.com/files/17.pdf
190988,kemper,2008-04-22 19:42:00,2232,"I have a picture at my house of a steelie bigger than that. It came out of a creek that is very small, and that many many people would be surprised to hear of a steelie of this size coming from. I dont want to post it without permission of the angler that caught it but if I run into him any time soon on the river ill ask if he would be cool with it."
191031,PAZE,2008-04-22 21:08:00,132,"My cat has a longer tail then yours, my other cat has longer teeth...........unreal LOL"
191052,chickenhawk,2008-04-22 22:20:00,612,Obviously somebody said the fish was held up to the camera.....next up is that it was photoshopped.....no that was the real deal.....real fish real person.....as far as i am told the fish swam away....
191063,Kerry,2008-04-22 22:35:00,383,I would have no problem saying that's a personal best if I caught it.Beauty Steelie!  Kerry
191127,fishindevil,2008-04-22 23:55:00,6254,"Awesome fish for sure !!!...what a brute  ,congrats to the fisherman !!!!       cheers"
191131,Sebastian,2008-04-23 00:01:00,208,"Hard to tell the true size of that fish because it is so close to the camera. Looking at the guys finger size, i wouldnt say over 20 but none the less its a nice fish. Some people need to weigh bows because they have no clue about steelhead weight. If you didnt weigh it dont give estimates. Some people are so far off. I`ve seen many times of 12lbers being ""16 or 18lbs"" or 15lbers being 22lbs. Same goes for muskie. 50"" can be 10lbs but it can also be 50lbs. WEIGH THE FISH CAREFULLY PEOPLE! lol  anyways Nice fish."
191177,chickenhawk,2008-04-23 01:30:00,612,It actually was weighed.....and it came in at 21....no one ever said anything about weight...is what my buddy told me...even if it didn't have an exact weight you can still tell it is at least 20 lbs....i mean look at the head on it....
191179,firefisher,2008-04-23 01:34:00,22,What a belly!!!!!!!!!!!
191201,kemper,2008-04-23 01:59:00,2232,"Its amazing sometimes how there can be a bunch of cookie cutter 5 pounders and then one like that which tops 20! This is definatly in the top 5 of the steelhead out of (Im assuming here) Lake Ontario that I have seen. Like I posted earlier I have a picture of a fish that 'looks' like it could be close to 30 pounds, and then there is that one which has got to be over 20 and one other that swam by me this year that nearly gave me a heart attack. Lets hope that fish like that and the others I mentioned go back into the creek if caught, and breed some more monsters!"
191205,chickenhawk,2008-04-23 02:07:00,612,well said Kemper! maybe you did see that fish this year! Never know! haha
