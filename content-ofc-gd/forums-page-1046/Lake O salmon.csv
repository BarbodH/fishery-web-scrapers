190263,HookNrelease,2008-04-21 13:08:00,85,"Well after many months of shivering and waiting we finally got to get the boat out this past weekend, testing everything make sure all is good, was a great weekend to be out, and the fish co-operated also. looks like it may be a good year class this year   smallest was 12 lbs biggest just under 22lbs, averaged approx 18 lbs, all fish gave a great fight, especially a 20 lber that took the 10 colour lead and ran 500 ft, not much fun trying to get over 1000ft of line back in,,,hahahaha, glad i didnt get that rod. Great day out and look forward to a good year,,enjoy  cheers  Ian       "

190643,HookNrelease,2008-04-22 01:30:00,85,"yeah tracker  your right it wasnt the north shore thats for sure, cliff, check the winds when your going out and plan your trip somewhat around that,the south shore is sheltered when its westerly and southerly, the bluffs / whitby etc gets sheltered more on a northerly and westerly  cheers  ian"
