It happens on Sunday June 15th at the same location.  Hope to see you there. Just watch the web site which should be updated very soon. Happy Fishing!"
190910,kickingfrog,2008-04-22 16:32:00,8333,"Found this for last years event:  http://www.teachakidtofish.com/  The date was June 24th. Bass was open on Simcoe. If it is June 15th bass won't be open (4th Saturday in June). Tim Horton's and the Rotary club were the title sponsors.  FYI Family fishing weekends are: July 4-6 2008, February 14-16 2009, July 10-12 2009.  This doesn't clear anything up I realize, but I'll keep my eyes and ears open."
