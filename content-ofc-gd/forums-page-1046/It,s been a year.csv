One who loved family and the outdoors and never put himself ahead of others. I felt safe anywhere I went with him. He along with his brother and our father, taught us to fish,a great sport he loved and we all took to heart. I still rememeber fishing alongside him and there would be an umbrella attached to the boat, to keep the sun off his and his brothers (uncle del) heads.I use to get a good laugh out of that. Think they knew something more then us? Remember a trip to Weslakoon. We went out and fished an island that had a bit of a nock in it. He says Brian,bet if you throw it in that little opening you get a fish. Well I hit it 4 times and nailed 4 fish from it. That is one memory I will never forget. Our grandfather was a gentleman,and I have to say ""IT WAS AND IS"" an ""HONOR"" and a ""GREAT PRIVALIDGE"" to be his grandson.  You are missed greatly along with Grandma,may you both be looking down on us along with others gone to the place above.  I say. See you soon,but not to soon.    When I get where Im going"
