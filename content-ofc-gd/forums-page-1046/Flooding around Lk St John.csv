190117,Kerry,2008-04-21 01:12:00,383,"We were out for a drive today and I figured I'd check on the water levels out that way.Needless to say the pictures say it all: The boat launch at Stepan.I've never seen it THAT high.   The airport road itself heading in before the big sweeping turn-I'm sure it's just as bad beyond.   This is the small private cottage road just before Sheba Cresc or Dr-That's water halfway up the road;the cottages beyond are.. well... WET.We turned in on Sheba and it's everywhere.I figured I took enough pics at that point,no sense on expounding any more on someone elses grief.  I figure it's up 6 to 7 ft and it's not going fast,folks there are going to have a long spring ahead.  Kerry"
190126,Sinker,2008-04-21 01:35:00,8692,"Crazy eh!!  I've never seen the kawartha's this high either. We're very close to record water levels.  Not sure what the fishing is going to be like, but I'll be out trying!  Sinker"
190255,ccmtcanada,2008-04-21 12:34:00,7971,"Wow...nice pics Kerry!  Water levels will be interesting this year....last year being low, this year record highs...hard to say what July will be like."
190334,Gerritt,2008-04-21 15:58:00,6129,I wonder if my grandparents old place is under water....
191050,Kerry,2008-04-22 22:17:00,383,HOLY CRAP! I thought it looked bad on Sunday then they showed it on AChannel tonight from the air.The airport road has at least another foot on top or more of what was there sunday.And the poor people out there got to be under seige right now.Walleyes'll be spawning on the road rip rap this year.  Kerry
191054,irishfield,2008-04-22 22:22:00,26272,Water above the front bumper of my Sierra 1500 this afternoon.. going to the airport for parts.
191061,Kerry,2008-04-22 22:28:00,383,You gotta feel sorry for all that live there eh Wayne.We only saw a we bit from the road sunday.Today's report from the air sure tells a brutal story.  Kerry
