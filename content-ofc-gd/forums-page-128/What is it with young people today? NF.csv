I just deleted about a half hour type up.   The bottom line I think here is,,,,,,,,,,,  We do the best we can. We do more then we can at times. We teach what we can, the best we can.  I can tell you one thing, I strongly feel both the mrs,s and I did the best we could. Once they become late teens, you cannot control them. You can only hope they have listened and learned. If they dont, then they are on thier own and LIFE, will give them the lesson now.  Our oldest is learning the hard way, Nothing is given, you need to earn.One day I pray, this will be learned. Our youngest we are very proud of . No he,s no university grad, or some hot shot lawyer or DR.  He is a young man that has become a great single father, and doing a great job of taking care of a very wonderfull daughter.  He holds a job, pays for daycare , takes here to parks and fishing and swimming lessons. He reads to her. Ya, reads better then me. He treats her like a kid, but never over dose it. (Thats my job)  Bottom line, there are those that want, and theres those that will do.  I have one of each .  So no matter the up bringing, they will either stay the path, or vere off it."

Too bad, so sad, all ancient history now, it was just what we did.  There was a different attitude we took through adulthood than our parents that went through the depression and WW2 did. I just can not imagine what they went through then and have empathy for their entire generation. If some think there is a generation gap now they didn't live through the 60's and early 70's. I can't imagine what was going through my fathers head when we had hair past our shoulders and blasting the 8 tracks without a care in the world living and counting down for the day we could get a beginners.

A stepfather who was never a ""Dad"". Didn't fish, hunt, swing a hammer even, and was more married to his job than my mother. But I had  fantastic uncles and a wonderful grandmother as I grew up. I chose to accept their influences and reject the role models of the stepfather and deadbeat dad. And there were some choices in life my mother was not thrilled with either. My kids have been taught what I could teach them in word and deed. It is entirely up to them what path they end up choosing. My kids did not start out as model sons and daughters. Like me, they've made mistakes aplenty. That's all part of growing and learning. I do see more and more of me and my values in them each and every day"

I got one of those Hamilton lifetime jobs and the house that was 2 to 3 times my annual salary, retired now. But let me tell you the 19% mortgage rates of 1981 and double digit rates through the 80's was a nightmare, probably ate up as much or more of your income as the inflated prices today with the all time low rates of today, six or one half dozen of the other situation."

($45K paid in interest during first term of the 19%/$50K option vs $49K in interest paid during first term of the 3%/$350K option).  Not to mention the 50K mortgage is 1/7th the amount.

I witnessed neighbors losing their homes because banks raised the interest rate , payments doubled and people could not afford it, banks don't care about people, only about the profit line. I see a depression coming soon when the banks raise the interest rate on all the mortgage money they have on the homes, forcing people to pay what they don't have. Income entering the home will not be enough to pay for mortgage payments, hydro increases, property taxes, home insurance, car payments, life insurance policys, cable, internet, heating, childrens school trips, home repairs, car maintenance and breakdowns,. Silly thing like groceries, hair cuts, not to mention--has anyone had a real vacation lately? Just my humble opinion but I pity the young generations of parents who have to pay and face all these and all unknown herdles in their way. Also --If divorce is in your future,  realize that the cost is only the beginning--child support is ongoing and will be an item you will be have to deal with, its not easy and it goes on for years. you cant build a future when you past is a fact of life.\ In my humble opinion, been there and done that..."

So these all fit under the proverbial 'bell curve'. I don't think you can argue that they are all the same  'these days' or were all the same way back in the 'good ole days'. You could argue that people today are less motivated, that someone considered a bit of a slacker in 1960, say, would be considered quite normal today. But I don't think you could argue that the curve for 1960 doesn't overlap at all with the one for 2016!! e.g. a slacker back then would be considered a keener these days.  ................or, to put it in a nutshell: ""Don't paint them all with the same brush, as I said in my post several pages back!

To be like my father, and purchase my first house that only costs 1/2 of an annual salary...could one even imagine!!!  Now the average house is approx 7x's an annual salary.  In 1986 My dad made $28K annual, and our first house cost $54K. To dream, oh to dream.  The amount of education required to make a decent salary these days....as oldironman has already said, you could once get a job out of highschool by simply going to an industrial area and show you want to work...

967999,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-28 23:27:00,8243,"I got a scholarship to a Div. 2 University in Ohio at 18. I thought I was in Hollywood, no schooling, morning watching film and playbook study. 3 hr a day practices and then the weight room, Dinner then beer and girls. I couldn't tell you where a classroom was. You had the second semester to catch up on what you missed from Sept to Dec. I said I geta get outa ahere. I went down to the Steelplant with my grade 12 and they asked ""What do you want to do?"" I started on salary at $500.00 a month in 73. Rent was $200.00. When I left 30 years latter working 60 hour weeks and on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week I was responsible for 105 operators and 20 supervisors. I worked 3 shifts 21 turn rotating days off for 22 years with maybe 4 weekends off a year. I'm going in when my pals are going to Wasaga. I bought my first home in Caledonia in 78 for 54K, I was making 22K as a Dock Foreman. My 2 weeks summer vacation was a week in may and a week in October. Anytime you wanted January to March. 27 straight night shifts as a relief Shift GF in 83', I was told it was a test.  Late 90's I'm interviewing grads for potential Supervisors. I ask them ""What do you want to do?"" They are telling me how much they need to make, their vacation expectations and they are willing to work 12 hour shifts for a few years only. Not all but many. The few I did hire worked out well. It's funny they all had jobs from the age of 8 or 10, paper routes, cutting grass, babysitting, then summers on the farms or family businesses. I ones I didn't hire took 4 plus years to complete a 3 year BA.  If I have learned anything it is this, you are not judged by what you have learned from your education you are judged by whether you can learn. I want that person that has learned how to learn.  Things are much different now and not much has changed. Good hard working people are just that and lazy people that do hold on to a job are great actors. Without a work ethic a person will flounder and end up with nothing.  Just some thoughts from a 62 year old with a shaky pension and lost benefits.  Who wants to go fishing?"

And no, those connections aren't just made out of the blue by ""pounding the pavement"". Family ties, friends of family, etc. are where they come from. The rich keep the rich at the top.  I think I'm in the same mind set as you, Jeremy. I'd rather do what I have to do to keep my bosses and clients happy and appreciate the fruits of my labour rather than working myself to the bone and giving myself an aneurysm or heart attack by the time I'm 40. I think this is a new mindset that has been instilled in this generation. What's the point in making all that money if you never get to enjoy it. I think we've looked back on the capitalist ideal from the 80's and 90's and seen how that's broken so many people. It's also probably why a lot of us area leaning towards socialism and why everyone my age seems to love the messages from Trudeau and Bernie Sanders.  As a generation, we've been taught from an early age to love what we do. Ours is a pursuit of happiness above all, more than money, power or influence. A lot of us don't mind getting our hands dirty, but I don't know if it's necessarily enrolment that's reducing the shop classes in schools. Health and safety regulations and operating costs most definitely are limiting factors. That, and parents who told us they wished they had gone to university and pushed it on a lot of their kids even if they didn't have a clue why they were going, or what they hoped to get out of it."

My first ""job"" was when I was pretty young, walking a dog for an elderly neighbour. For $1 a day. Then I worked for another neighbour doing yard work, cutting wood, clearing brush, masonry work, general labourer stuff for $5 an hour when I started. It was hard work too but I was glad to have it. Taught me a lot of things too. It was hard when I moved out and went to college, I haven't taken a dime from anyone so I made my own way. I had some set backs and changes of plane but I worked hard and things turned out well in the long run.  Now I'm married, my wife and I just bought our first home last fall. We both work hard, I work and extra shift every single week. I make decent money for where we live but nothing crazy. We have a nice home on almost 16 acres. A boat I payed cash for, her car is paid off, my truck will be in the near future too. We're not rich by any means but life is pretty damn good and we manage just fine living within our means.

In the same case though to complain about the path you took "" lots of family with no money or the other view lots of money no family"" and complain because someone worked and has money just makes you look small minded.

967864,netminder,2016-04-27 14:53:00,514," A lot of it though was peer pressure. I'm not saying its right but all of the sudden, 20 years ago Opera and Doctor Phil and some other expert comes on your TV and says 'We've been doing it wrong all these years. Do this and this and this' and 90% of parents said 'That's ridiculous.' But the other 10% had their soapbox and finally had a voice to be able to helicopter over their children and justification for bubble wrapping the world.  The problem is then that 10% goes to the schools and says to the teachers 'I've been doing it right all along. You need to change this and this and this.' 10% of people may not seem like a lot but when all of them are putting pressure on the school board, they start looking to make a change.  Change happens at school and kids come home saying 'Teachers say this and this and this,' The 90% of parents maybe becomes 80% or 70%. Then the kids coaches and other supervisors get on board, and the percentage becomes smaller and smaller.  Now we are at the point where this percentage of parents making the kids the ones in control have the majority. Kudos for those who have and still do stick to their guns. There are a lot of idiots out there that will try to convince you that you are wrong at every turn. You almost had me fooled for a bit, talking like an old timer.

So let me bring you back from the dark side (  because it's been difficult for some to detect here earlier)  Let me wade into this again and hopefully annoy as many people as possible...  But let me let everyone in on a secret: Privilege is progress. Sure, some things may be taking it too far, or there were some failed experiments. But seriously, privileged youth mean we've been making progress as a society. If we didn't, we would still have child labour, slavery, deplorable working conditions, no technology, teachers who beat the children and berate them daily, no one would have sick leave, maternity leave, employment insurance, healthcare, etc. etc., etc.  And just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean either side is right or wrong. Sometimes it's just a different way of doing things.  PS - I don't have any kids, but I seriously think there should be a licensing exam you have to pass to have kids.

But I suspected as much looking at your profile name and then checking your profile you're only a year older than I am. You are one of the ""young people these days"". So let me bring you back from the dark side (  because it's been difficult for some to detect here earlier)  Let me wade into this again and hopefully annoy as many people as possible...  But let me let everyone in on a secret: Privilege is progress. Sure, some things may be taking it too far, or there were some failed experiments. But seriously, privileged youth mean we've been making progress as a society. If we didn't, we would still have child labour, slavery, deplorable working conditions, no technology, teachers who beat the children and berate them daily, no one would have sick leave, maternity leave, employment insurance, healthcare, etc. etc., etc.  And just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean either side is right or wrong. Sometimes it's just a different way of doing things.  PS - I don't have any kids, but I seriously think there should be a licensing exam you have to pass to have kids. Your reproductive organs should be taken away and only returned to you once you pass the exam.  PPS - Does anyone here actually know who Socrates is? I feel like Old Ironmaker's quote went over a few people's heads  I got the quote, its a pretty good one because I'm sure every generation believes it to be true.  Netminder, we probably are around the same age and I don't have children either.  I truly believe (I'm sure every generation says this as well) that we were the last generation raised right. I agree with you 1000%, we don't need to be beating our kids, giving them lashings in school, and we have come a long way in growing as a society (PS - what are sick days? Or vacation time for that matter? Corporations found a way around that with a little thing called the 364 day contract employee)  But I feel that we need to pull it back a little bit now to fine tune everything. My dad used to teach, and I would hear him and a lot of his buddies all the time saying that it was getting really horrible because they felt powerless. A buddy of his once had a student clock him right in the middle of the class, the student got counseling for a couple of weeks in between their classes to determine what triggered them and my dads buddy got two weeks away from the school (paid thank god) to remove what may be a 'difficult situation' for the students.  I'm not sure if I want to have kids for fear of other parents telling me I'm wrong for making my kids call adults 'Sir' or 'Ma'am' or 'Aunt' or 'Uncle' for people not related to us (I called all friends of the family 'Aunt' and 'Uncle' as a show of respect growing up). I fear that if I don't give my 7 year old a $500 Iphone, teachers and parents will say I am taking away their ability to be social. I worry that if I take it away from them or ground them that I am not allowing them to express themself and I may be stifling their creativity.  As I said, we have come a long way as a society for sure, now we just need to fine tune and bring it back a little bit. Maybe be a little more harsh and strict."

I'm around the same age, I have two young kids, 1 and 3. The sense of satisfaction that comes from at least TRYING to raise them right far outweighs any sort of fear of other parents judging me. Then again, I'm also the kind of person who doesn't sweat that kind of stuff, because everyone can have and is entitled to their opinion, even those who are completely out to lunch.  As far as being ""raised right"", honestly, that's pretty much a household-to-household deal, even back then. I have friends who didn't really have a chance, because their parents f'd things up so badly. I also know some people who did really well in life because their parents cared and tried to instill solid values.  I don't raise my kids in the exact same way I was raised, but the fundamentals are the same - show respect, understand that actions have consequences, try to be nice, and stick up for yourself when you need to. My wife spends time with the kids at the Early Year centres around here. More than once she's asked me ""Are we too strict? I see kids running around, climbing on things, and they don't listen, while <daughter> knows better, and always listens"". My response is always ""And those kids are going to pay for the lack of direction from their parents when they get older"".  I dunno, I think parents have as much influence as peer pressure. I remember being pressured into a lot of stuff, but just knowing better, and also not wanting to disappoint Mom and Dad. I did some really stupid stuff, but I don't think anyone makes it through youth without a few of those  I'm sure people look at me as a parent and think I'm out to lunch. At the end of the day, I love my kids a lot, I care about them a lot, and try to always put them ahead of myself. That's at least a start..."

No allowance or pay; they were working for the better of the family. When they wanted some money to buy something or go out with a friend; they came to us; if we thought it was reasonable they would get it. They did that until they left for university. When they were home for the summer, they'd get jobs doing whatever there was out there.  We made sure that at least 3/4 of their pay went into the bank and towards their next year of school. My daughter is now a lawyer working at a well established firm here in town. My son is an automotive engineer, working for GM in the States; at there resource and development division. We are very proud of both of them; but I don't believe they would have turned out the way they did; if it wasn't for my wife's and my firm but fair hand.

I have 2 kids who are both in their very early 20's now and I have been very lucky to spend a lot of time with them and their large group of friends through their sports and other social activities (like fishing).  With very few exceptions, these kids are smart, respectful, and most have at least one job while many are juggling 2 or more.  They are also much more responsible than the group of people I grew up with, we were lucky to survive our teen age years with some of the stunts we used pull.  If they go out, they have DD's and if they have a party at someone's house they stay over; they are welcome at any of the homes including mine any time.  Some of their gang are in university, some at community college and some have pursued trades or other careers but they all work hard for the most part.

I'm not saying its right but all of the sudden, 20 years ago Opera and Doctor Phil and some other expert comes on your TV and says 'We've been doing it wrong all these years. Do this and this and this' and 90% of parents said 'That's ridiculous.' But the other 10% had their soapbox and finally had a voice to be able to helicopter over their children and justification for bubble wrapping the world.  The problem is then that 10% goes to the schools and says to the teachers 'I've been doing it right all along. You need to change this and this and this.' 10% of people may not seem like a lot but when all of them are putting pressure on the school board, they start looking to make a change.  Change happens at school and kids come home saying 'Teachers say this and this and this,' The 90% of parents maybe becomes 80% or 70%. Then the kids coaches and other supervisors get on board, and the percentage becomes smaller and smaller.  Now we are at the point where this percentage of parents making the kids the ones in control have the majority. Kudos for those who have and still do stick to their guns. There are a lot of idiots out there that will try to convince you that you are wrong at every turn."

I have been approached by a couple different schools; that have ask, if I would be willing to bring coop students in. So far I have had maybe 10 or 12 kids through here; ages ranging from 15 -18 years old. It's a bit of a coin toss whether the kid is worth our time to train or if they're here for what they think will be an easy credit. It only takes a couple of days to find out who the deadwood's are. The older kids that have really put an effort into the coop; I've gone out of my way (Along with the school counselor) trying to get them into a shop and hopefully an apprenticeship. A couple of them I wish that I had room for them here; but the size of my shop and the 2 techs that I have working for me are good guys; that have been with me for years. (one approx 23 years and the other for at least 15 years). My point being is that there are still a lot of good young people out there; who are not afraid to work and make something out of themselves. There's a couple of the kids that still stop in from time to time; just too say hello and let me know how their apprenticeship is going. Those are the feel good times.  Dan  "

Working 12 hour shifts with side jobs leaves me with no time to fish but the only money that comes into our house is from mine and my wife's labor.. we both have had some tough times growing up so work ethic is important to us.. at one point in our lives as kids we were both homeless so I don't think it's a coincidence that we ended up together.... my daughter will never know that hardship if she learns about working for something.."

He also went to college and surprise all of us while there..........he worked all kinds of jobs to stay in school  that was 3 hours away........his first year he did a student work program whenever he could. From there when school let out he worked in a nearby furniture refinishing factory sanding down wooden furniture and NEVER complained to us.....then he cut grass for some of the professors at his college.....  He went on to graduate but still needed to do a intership......,he found another college that wanted him to coach, which took him almost 300 miles away from everyone, including his college sweetheart.....he never complained at all...........just went and did it for a year.......  When he returned to his college to visit his college sweetheart he stopped in and said hi to his old coach.....that head coach offered him to coach there and offered him a chance to get his masters degree........he jumped on it like stink on a money....  From there he married his college sweetheart and they bought a home in that college town....  Two years later she didn't get the promotion she wanted and went online for a better job......  Today they live a huge 4 bedroom 2.5 bath home with one daughter and another daughter on the way, making six times the amount they were in the small college town that they went to...

To sand and stain my deck which is 12X35 at the back and 12X20 on the side = 660 sqft. I would charge myself 2 bucks a square foot minimum and that's exactly $1320.00. I also broke it down in detail with materials, fixed operating costs, a helper at $15.00 an hour and the actual time for that deck, not just the time at the homeowners all the hours put in. That would be procuring all materials, loading and unloading the truck, cleaning rollers and brushes etc. and ubloading at the end of the day. Plus the cost of doing business. CPP payments, Comp, liability insurance and, and, and. It all adds up. I would be making maybe 30 bucks an hour not the $132.00 calculating your way for the 10 hours you would see me. No helper I would earn $45.00 an hour, maybe. When we had our business the fixed operating cost for 1 of our trucks was $50.00 a day and that was before a key was turned. You got a fair price Cliff if your deck is of a similar size.  We all want the wages we feel we are worth but seem to not want to pay the wages that someone else deserves. I want to add if a kid wanted to earn 15 bucks an hour doing odd jobs after taxes and deductions they would need to charge you at least $25.00 an hour, no one thinks that way though."

This year i went out twice ploughing all winter so i had to spend 5g of my savings to stay afloat, i work my ass off for what i have but sometimes the breaks arent there so i will keep at it until i get what i want. We have a high turnaround of young guys at my work who want to make big pay but are afraid of doing work, maybe 1 in 5 is worth the effort of trying to teach them something. Most of them come in wanting to run a crane and refuse to do any pump work whatsoever lol.  I also wonder what the world will look like down the road but i try not to worry about other peoples problems when i got enough of my own.  For the record i was raised by a single mother so i learned what real work ethic looked like early and therefore was never afraid of work, i tried to earn every dollar i could anywhere i could so i could have my own spending money for fishing equiptment, cut grass, rake leaves, shovel snow, help take docks in and out, or any other odd job basically from the age of 10 on.

When we get crazy busy we get overtime but most of it is eaten up by our company calling Temp agencies  and sending in bodies to help with the workload. I understand why it is done and if I was way up the food chain calling the shots I'm sure that's the path I would follow as well.  However what is sad to see is when a temp comes in and just works like an animal and puts many of the full timers to shame with there work ethic. They are hoping for a foot in the door and our company is just using them. Sad to see when we have full time ""dead wood"" and a keene energetic and motivated individual is just being used for cheap labour.   I stayed away til I seen your post Steve.  YOU ARE BANG ON  And for the pay they are getting, they still put in a full effort. More effort like you said then a full timer.  I guess while Im at it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, CLIFF   REALLY?"

Insane! what do these people do to afford such homes? Isn't this how a housing market crash happens?    To afford these homes people take on massive debt. If interest rates go up a mere 2 points, there would be so many people that couldn't make their payments it would rock the real estate market and economy.

It's easy to ramble on with the ""I did this"" and ""I did that"" but under what circumstances? What inflation rate, housing costs, cost of living? What about globalization and the effects that has had on the job market and the pressure to increase the base level education.  There is nothing wrong with this generation. Just like our parents were wrong when they made general criticisms about our whole generation. Kids will figure it out, just like us. And they'll do it their way, not our way...just like us."

I took university math and it ruined my grades, i sucked at it  8 years later, 50% of the people that i know that went to university and had good grades are working menial jobs, meanwhile 100% of the dummys that took applied courses and went into the trades are making fantastic money and loving life.  One of the most succesful guys i know nearly failed out of school cause he was terrible at it and had a learning disability, now hes 28 making 150k a year...go figure.

Welding, mechanicing and building tradespeople are always in demand as are heavy equipment operators. Not too mention computer related jobs like mine.

That would mean they would have to move out on their own at 30 years old. The X,Y and Millennials (are they the same?) will be the first generation in over 100 years that will have less in their old age than their parents did. We have really messed them up ""Here son is your trophy for participating"". We don't want to keep score because there are no losers. What a mess we have made of these kids."

My brother has been looking at houses with his girlfriend similar size as mine and has offered up to $480,000 on a house listed at 425k and lost out to buyers coming from elsewhere Toronto way and they paid 500k for a 2 story with a single garage lot size 62x110. Crazy crazy crazy"
967321,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-22 18:14:00,8243,14 year olds from every generation since man stood upright have had problems with authority and many other things Rick. That kid is in estrogen overdrive. When I was 14 and not wanting to live by house rules I always threatened to go to Viet Nam as soon as I could lie about my age. My kid brother quit school in 73' took off at 17 and did odd jobs as he and our cousin hitch hiked and road the rails along Route 66 across the US to California to go and live with our uncle in Sacramento. It back fired on him when he found out Uncle Sal's rules were tougher there than here at home. He found himself picking grapes and lettuce from dust till dawn for a buck an hour. He begged to come home and go back to high school. I was working full time at the plant by then and was jealous until he told me some horror stories. That trip was worth a lifetime of real world lessons for him and in a way myself too.

But its her choice. I cant decide her path"

967324,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-22 18:23:00,8243,"The real estate bubble in Hammertown is bursting at the seams. I have seen it 3 times in Hamilton, 81', 90, and 2008. My interest rate that was 12% in 79 went to 18% or more in 81'. Manylost homes because they were leveraged to the max at 12%. The exact thing happened in 89'. I bought a home on Strawberry Hill off Lake Ave. in 86'for 105K, sold it in 89 for the unprecedented price of 205K. That same house was sold in 91 for $135,000.00. If I were you I would take the 450K, rent for a few years and buy it back for 225 or less in a few years and pocket a quick quarter of a million dollars. That's what I did. Just like in 06 people are going to start using the false equity in their homes and do renovations, Granite counter tops, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and buy toys, vehicles, boats and cottages, when interest rates go up a few % the bow with break and the cradle will fall. You only need to go back to 2008 to see what happens next.  Sorry for the hi jack Cliff. I'll stop now. My chores are calling."
967325,AKRISONER,2016-04-22 18:31:00,5558,"trust me guys. i would have loved to have taken a trade but its not as easy as you think.  I looked into trying to get into the electrician or plumbers union and its basically impossible unless your dad/uncle are already in the union.  Dont even get me started on how corrupt the education system is though...oh boy  let me just say that it was straight forward told to us in highschool that if you were smart you would take University level courses, go to university and get a job...and if you were dumb, then you took applied math and would go into the trades...  I took university math and it ruined my grades, i sucked at it  8 years later, 50% of the people that i know that went to university and had good grades are working menial jobs, meanwhile 100% of the dummys that took applied courses and went into the trades are making fantastic money and loving life.  One of the most succesful guys i know nearly failed out of school cause he was terrible at it and had a learning disability, now hes 28 making 150k a year...go figure.  I have many regrets in that regard and i actually blame the corrupt education system that was forcing us into useless college and university courses to inflate peoples pockets for the problem"
967327,captpierre,2016-04-22 18:41:00,2521," Don't want to tell you how to raise your daughter, but you had better love her like crazy as well as being tough with her. Read once that girls have a theoretical ""love tank"" that can only be filled with male affection. It's the Dad's job to keep it filled till they grow up. Hugs. Compliments. Monthly date night,  etc. If Dad's not filling it, they will find male affection elsewhere. At 14 that just leads to trouble. Just sayin. It's a tricky balance. Too tight- no good. They rebel. Too loose- no good either. Glad I'm done with 4 kids. 3 grandkids now ?"
967329,manitoubass2,2016-04-22 18:46:00,11391,"Oh of course!  I love my daughter like crazy. But it also might have to do with her biological father dissappearing 5 or 6 years ago, or at least play a part in it"

Had four daughters whom I never pushed on the amount of education they MUST have so they took their chosen path.  They always had a roof over their heads and food to eat, I helped them with car insurance  (on my policy) . . . They are now all married and families of their own and have their own homes and doing very well up to now. We never had to attend a teacher's meeting and NEVER had law officer visit us because they had done something wrong.  I think I led by example, not words. I see them all at least once a week if not more. They have never spoken back to me or their mother. Hope they have the same luck with their kids.  Cliff, if your son can't help you then when he comes for dinner the plate may be empty!"
967332,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-22 19:11:00,8243,Can you elaborate AKRINSONER? I have been away from the system for 12 years. I finally finished my degree at Brock after many years of night school over the years. I didn't find anything that I would say came close to corrupt. Please educate me.
967250,Big Cliff,2016-04-22 12:02:00,6899,"I have been trying to hire someone to help me do jobs around here, nothing fancy, rake the yard, stain the decks, clean the evestroughs..... jobs I just find really hard to do myself anymore!  I finally got a guy to come and sand and stain my decks, took him two days, cost me $1250.00. (My bad, he quoted I accepted, I just remember it took me several days to do them last year, I figure it took him about 10 hours). Afterwards I had a few people come to me and tell me I should have asked them, they would have undercut him. Ya, they would have done it for $100.00 an hour!  I have been trying to hire help to do lots of little jobs around here, I've been offering $15.00 an hour cash. If they do show up, they spend more time talking or texting on their phones than they do working but in most cases they don't even show up. Finally managed to hire a guy to cut my lawn, takes him an hour cost me $45.00, actually it use to take me two hours and I was bagged so not such a bad deal.  Even my own son; he is currently laid off, offered to hire him for a week $600.00 plus we'd spend some time fishing; ""sorry dad, I'm too busy, I want to go smelt fishing!"".  Yesterday I worked 15 straight hours, I make $16.00 an hour and I think I am lucky to even be able to have a job at 70, just doesn't seem right somehow.  Time to sell everything, move into a small low maint. place, change the will to leave nothing to the son (he doesn't seem to need or want any help).  Old, tired, frustrated!  "
967253,manitoubass2,2016-04-22 12:18:00,11391,"Geez, thats brutal.  Up here cliff, your deck woulda cost a case of beer between two guys.  Lawn mow be about 15 bucks. Or id send my 12 year old and hed just do it for free or donation  You live in the wrong darn place lol"

967258,netminder,2016-04-22 12:39:00,514,"What is it with parents these days, is what I'd like to ask.  Truthfully, there isn't much incentive to take a job seriously that you're only going to be able to do for a few hours a week at $15/hour, especially when a lot of young people are still living at home because they can't afford the cost of living these days. And how do you know the time they spend on their phones isn't trying to line up the next $15 job so they can afford more than a sub and bag of chips from subway today?  As for the guy staining your deck, of course the other guys would have undercut him after the fact, but I think that's on you for not shopping around.  As for your son... See my first line above.  I wonder what 70 year olds were saying about ""kids these days"" when you were in your 20's.  Don't worry, I already know I'll be like you when I'm your age. I already am for the most part."

I'm fortunate to have a young neighbor who comes over in the fall & offers to clean my troughs.  I ask him how much?  He says 20 bux!  I'm in!  He even took my hose to flush out the downspouts.  I gave him $30.00.  He did a great job."
967266,AKRISONER,2016-04-22 13:18:00,5558,"part of the problem you are dealing with Cliff is that you cant find people that actually want to work to do the jobs that you have. The ones that actually want to work and are good workers have jobs of their own already.  There was a time in my life I would have been all over this. But for those that actually care to work hard, those times are usually short lived.  What you are dealing with is a bunch of bums that dont have jobs to begin with...and thats usually for a reason."
967267,manitoubass2,2016-04-22 13:28:00,11391,"Thats why ya get the 12-15 year old kids.  I was on the gring at that age, $1000 bucks would last me all all summer and some!"

967270,crappieperchhunter,2016-04-22 14:14:00,2582,"Cliff I'm sorry to hear your woes. The world is different  today and that's all there is to it. The problem as I see it can't be blamed entirely on the kids. I grew up doing farm work and having exposure to many different forms of physical labour and reno/repair work as most of my generation and older generations did as well.  My son on the other hand grew up in the city and lived in a brand new house that never needed anything done other then painting, so I never got to share any of my knowledge with him. He's smart and not afraid to work....he's just out of his depth. He could cut your grass for you and that's just about it.  And don't be too harsh on your own son. Maybe he really wants to go smelt fishing and looks forward to it every year or he's just exhausted and wants to enjoy his downtime from work. We are crazy busy at work and I told the boss when I worked my last OT shift on April 9th please don't ask me for the rest of the month. I got some seasonal fishing coming up I enjoy, I got my veggie garden and yard work to get done, tiller and lawnmower's to service, boat to get organized.  And we are preparing to move back into the cottage the 1st of May. Extra hours at work just don't fit into my schedule right now. All I'm saying is perhaps your son has lots on the go now as well. Being laid off doesn't necessarily mean he isn't busy or doesn't deserve to enjoy his downtime at his own leisurely pace."
967271,manitoubass2,2016-04-22 14:40:00,11391,"See, thats a weird thing right there.  All the work I did for my parents/grandparents I wasnt asked, I was TOLD.  Eventually I really liked it.  To this day my mom or dad need help I jump and if I dont they will tell me they arent asking lol."
967272,grimsbylander,2016-04-22 14:50:00,3016,Has there ever been a generation that didn't have that exact complaint? Let's start a thread next about haircuts and crappy music. Hey! you kids...get off my lawn!!!!
967277,captpierre,2016-04-22 15:06:00,2521,Used to run home from school in the winter after a snow storm. Had a few driveways to shovel in the neighbourhood. $5. If I got there too late might have lost the job to competition. Made my 4 kids get a degree. And we paid for half. Cut them a cheque for $7k per year. They worked their butt off for pool companies all summers. No debts after university. Tough love is a good thing.

967289,KLINKER,2016-04-22 15:59:00,256,"Well lets see, for someone to legally come work on your house he might need a ladder for that he will have to be licensed, he will need a truck for the ladder so that will be a couple grand at least plus safety and e-test. For the truck he will need insurance at around 5 grand and liability insurance at another 5 grand or so. He will have to have his comp paid up at whatever that comes to. He will also need a HST account and maybe local licenses. So now that he is all set up in the handyman business no one will hire him because its cheaper to get someone under the table. Is it possible that young people aren't lazy but we have regulated them out of work."

Mostly a lazy bunch of entitled brats. Correct!  However, the ""new generation"" has technology advantages others never had.  BUT they have as I will say ""typist hands"" or soft skin and don't want to break a nail or even a sweat for a dollar.  They would much rather take $10 an hr standing still vs $20 and working for it. I may have grown up in Markham but I worked ASAP for everything I had.  My older sister was I think phase one of the ""gimmy erra"""

Honestly Cliff your getting a good deal at $45. Maybe 5 years ago I was at a garage sale in Bobcaygeon. Got talking to the homeowner...an older gentleman...and complimented him on his beautiful lawn/yard. He told me then it was costing him $60 a pop to get his grass cut and his yard would be 1/2 or 1/3 the size of yours. Told my mom and she said many of her senior friends have told her the same.  That's the going rate. As long as my health holds up I was planning to take on a couple of lawns when we retire up there. $100-$200 a week during the summer for less then 5-6 hours work a week...will give me all the spending money I will ever need."
