Big Cliff introduced the diner to Maribeth and me shortly after we moved up this way...we will miss their great food...

968646,Big Cliff,2016-05-05 19:02:00,6899,"Beans, try out the Durham Cafe. Another wonderful place to eat in the interm.  From what I understand one firefighter was hurt; burned wrist or hand.  I was told that the fire started in the kitchen but I thought there was a sprinkler system in the kitchen. I wonder if it malfunctioned or something."
