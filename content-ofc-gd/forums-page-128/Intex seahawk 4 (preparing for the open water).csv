It is rated for 880 lbs which is plenty and can take a 2 hp motor.  I will probably be using a trolling motor in the near future but for now will just be paddling fsince I don't plan to use it on bigger size lakes yet until I am comfortable with it and until I get my operator's license for motor use.  So far I have gotten the following:  1)life jackets, 2)safety kit (orange bucket thingy) 3)patch kit 4)duct tape 5)paddles 6)hand pump which is surprisingly quick.  I can pump the whole boat which is close to 11 feet in less than 10 mins single handed! 7)fish finder 8) rod holders (already on boat)  Things I am considering getting and can use you folk's advice  1)Anchor (homemade ideas are fine) 2)seat ideas that can be put on top of the vinyl floor. the boat comes with inflatable pillows as seats but I am sure they will not be very comfortable . Freshtrax's cooler seat idea is great! 3) Advice on anything else I am missing out or may need.   Thanks"
