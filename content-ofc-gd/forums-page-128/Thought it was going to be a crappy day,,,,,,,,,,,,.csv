Every morning up here is in the minus, sun dosent get to it,s peak temps til after lunch or later. By that time, the temps start to drop. No real chance for the northern lakes to warm up.  Oh well. Better then sitting at home right.  These never get boring. BEAUTIFUL    Sat my toon in 12 fow and marked. Thought they were crappy, but turned out to be perch and blue gills. Not what we were looking for.       After it slowed, we moved around. Terry moved more then I. I think he covered the whole lake. He,s out there somewhere.LOL Dead center in the pic.    Stuck it out til noonish, then called it.      Calling for high winds and rain Sunday. Looks like a damper on our pickeral opener.  Maybe hit a couple of res trout  spots early in the am.  "
