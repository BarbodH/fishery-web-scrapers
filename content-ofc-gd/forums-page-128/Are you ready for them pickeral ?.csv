968403,manitoubass2,2016-05-03 15:49:00,11391,Oh I have lol. Anyone that makes their own spinners has likely tried every variation from lines to hooks to beads to clevises to blades hahahaha  All black for for me. And I dont use plastic beads I use glass beads
968405,Dara,2016-05-03 16:05:00,3052,Oh I have lol. Anyone that makes their own spinners has likely tried every variation from lines to hooks to beads to clevises to blades hahahaha  All black for for me. And I dont use plastic beads I use glass beads   you have picky fish up there
968411,manitoubass2,2016-05-03 16:29:00,11391,"Nope not at all, just have a bunch of bulk black beads and a confidence bait lol  Its nw ontario man, fish will eat anything up here lol"
968445,Oggie,2016-05-03 23:24:00,588,"Yes I have a gazzilion colours and blade types.  What do I use? Chrome, brass and then chartreuse with orange splash on it.  I have loads of indiana blades but I just hardly ever use them.  They seem so small and I have no confidence in them.  I guess they spin faster and lift the harness a little more. I think the theory was that Indiana's are better in the spring when water is colder and you tend to troll slower."
968446,misfish,2016-05-03 23:30:00,29133,"I dont know what will work or not. I just  put them together and try them. Never know. I dont use them alot, but have them to throw on and just troll them, flipping my toon away. The nice thing I like is you dont need to be going fast for them to work. Slow rolling them or fast."
968468,manitoubass2,2016-05-04 01:19:00,11391,Use a 3/8oz keel sinker with a snap on it and cast them  Spinners are deadly effective when casting. I dont even troll them anymore
968006,porkpie,2016-04-29 01:16:00,2521,Very seldom had a snell fail.  Surprised to hear.  What kind of line are you using for harnesses?
968009,manitoubass2,2016-04-29 01:44:00,11391,A dab of gorilla glue solves the issue quick  You can also get alot of wild action on plastics if you just use a palomar knot
968013,dave524,2016-04-29 02:08:00,4508,I haven't found a snell knot I like yet.  Some of the recommended snell knots will fail given enough time. Any recommendations? Does the nail knot tool help with a good snell?  I use this one.  http://www.steelheader.net/knots/whip_finish.htm
968014,Smokercrafty,2016-04-29 02:09:00,227,"A dab of gorilla glue solves the issue quick  You can also get alot of wild action on plastics if you just use a palomar knot  Just starting to use the Palomar, and love it. Simple, strong, and effective, with 100% strength."
968018,manitoubass2,2016-04-29 02:54:00,11391,Yessir! I did a bunch about 3 years ago and it certainly is easier and its effective.  But snelling is fun! Just not out in the boat in wind lol
968029,AKRISONER,2016-04-29 13:39:00,5558,"palomer all the way, its also great for tying drop shot hooks to line."
968060,misfish,2016-04-29 21:00:00,29133,"They all seem to tie them like this.    When I tie the swivel, I do  palomar."
968075,Sinker,2016-04-29 22:16:00,8692,"To make your harnesses ""swim"" right, you have to use a snell knot.....unless your only using one hook. I snell the first one, and clinch the end hook. I use improved clinch for everything except the first hook on a harness.  I can't wait to drag harnesses.....still two weeks for me here.  S."
968083,Oggie,2016-04-29 23:41:00,588,Very seldom had a snell fail. Surprised to hear. What kind of line are you using for harnesses? 15 lb fluoro seaguar I believe.  It's not the first snell at the end of the line that failed.  The second hook seems to come unsnelled once in a while and slides down to the terminal hook.  That's why I was wondering about the style of snell I'm using.
968085,Oggie,2016-04-29 23:53:00,588,YUP that's the snelling I use Brian B and the middle hook will slide freely on the line if the knot is given slack such as during the process of unhooking a fish.  I've never had the terminal hook unravel but the middle hook has come loose and ended up at the terminal hook several times.
968086,Oggie,2016-04-29 23:55:00,588,Sinker that's what I ended up doing because I was concerned the termainal snell would fail as well.
968087,captpierre,2016-04-30 00:28:00,2521,So that's where they were ?
968088,Sinker,2016-04-30 00:46:00,8692,Ive never ever had a snell do that. Are you sure your tying it right? I use harnesses A LOT. Pretty much from the time walleye season opens until hunting season and never ever had that happen. I use 17lb up to 20lb mono for mine.
968102,gaspumper,2016-04-30 02:23:00,393,"Ive never ever had a snell do that. Are you sure your tying it right? I use harnesses A LOT. Pretty much from the time walleye season opens until hunting season and never ever had that happen. I use 17lb up to 20lb mono for mine. X 2 Iv'e never had a snell fail on my harnesses,"
968109,ecmilley,2016-04-30 11:31:00,2163,"I was taught to use snell knots when making harness, never really had issues with them, not that I get any use these days from them"
968139,manitoubass2,2016-04-30 17:27:00,11391,I only use single hook so palomar suffices.
968147,Oggie,2016-04-30 20:02:00,588,Well now that you guys mention it; I'm using lighter line for the terminal portion of the harness.  There's so much wood in the Ottawa River I started using lighter leaders like you do in steelheading.  I don't care about the harness really I just hate backing the boat up and wrestling with the heavy leader material to breakoff off of the snag.  It's the 6lb fluoro that comes unsnelled.  Maybe it's a problem using lighter line ..... it's too supple perhaps?  I started using the egg knot that steelheaders use for the terminal hook and then the standard snell for the middle hook.  I've never lost a fish because of it.
968148,Sinker,2016-04-30 20:17:00,8692,Do more wraps with lighter line. Like 6-8 instead of 5 or 6.  S.
968237,Oggie,2016-05-01 16:34:00,588,"yeah that would help.  On a different note,  What order do you fish the various spinner blades throughout the season.  I start with indiana #4 in spring and then move to colorado blades by june with the willow leaf blade in the warmest part of the summer.  Anyone else use that order primarily?  i like the brass and nickel colours first then I move to perch colours after that with hot colours next."
968239,Sinker,2016-05-01 17:03:00,8692,"Silver hammered colorado blades with red beads has caught me every kind of fish that swims. I hardly every use any other colour. Might switch to a gold blade if silver isn't working, or a chartreuse if the water is dirty.  S."
968242,manitoubass2,2016-05-01 17:30:00,11391,I use hammered copper and black beads(90%of the time)  Works even in muddy water
968243,porkpie,2016-05-01 17:35:00,2521,I don't own harnesses with anything other than Colorado blades.
968323,netminder,2016-05-02 19:06:00,514,"I use hammered copper and black beads(90%of the time)  Works even in muddy water Copper with red beads has always been the ticket with me. Caught everything from pickeral, bass, pike, perch, sunfish, brown bullhead.... I fish in some fairly heavily stained waters too."
968390,Dara,2016-05-03 12:20:00,3052,I use hammered copper and black beads(90%of the time)  Works even in muddy water  Try adding one red bead at the top
968393,Fish Farmer,2016-05-03 12:54:00,2234,"Just one tip, watch for line burn. Mostly fishing erie for Walleye I always check. Large blades and clevises do burn your line."
967902,misfish,2016-04-27 23:14:00,29133,"Anyone can catch a walleye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Sunday will be here soon enough and I figured better get me some harness,s tied up. Seems from my intel, I dont have the fav colours for the waters we will be fishing, so I guess this will do, but I will be making a stop after work to get some colours that are to be needed.  Tying these are fun and easy.    One of them ,I used the blades from a broken spinner bait. Hey, waste not want not. Recycle.LOL  "
967904,manitoubass2,2016-04-27 23:20:00,11391,Looks good brian!  Ive already tied a summers worth this winter.  All mine a single colorado blades  Some I paint myself with nailpolish lol.
967909,Joeytier,2016-04-28 00:14:00,3990,"Still nearly a month away from opener here, and with this late spring (yet again) things will be off to a slow start so I think I'll stick with squaretails until mid-June, then shift gears  I like the gold colorado blade harness, would make a great clear water/cold front presentation, if you send me some I will give you some great promotional shots"
967912,porkpie,2016-04-28 00:49:00,2521,"17 days to go, and then other than the odd trout excursion, its pretty much all I will fish until the bows run again.  Mind you, I catch plenty of pike, bass and muskie while targeting pics, but they are just window dressing.  Have fun!"

967934,wormdunker,2016-04-28 09:10:00,1711,Your harnesses look great!  Try some perch colored harnesses.  They work very well on Erie.
967942,Acountdeleted,2016-04-28 12:59:00,2562,I was wondering that too. I was like 'what nonsense is this. Still got another month here. :p'
967943,Terry,2016-04-28 13:12:00,14456,Oh yeah they open in order Georgian bay this Sunday Quinte next weekend Then balsam lake the weekend after.

967956,BillM,2016-04-28 15:42:00,17367," how shallow are we talking?  6-12ft, shallower early mornings/evenings."
967975,Dara,2016-04-28 17:50:00,3052," how shallow are we talking? even 3 or 4 feet they like the shallow bays that warm up quick  if the water is 45-48F and you find a 50-55 degree spot, work it...run fast enough to make the bait work proper. small baits because minnows are still small this time of year  and all day long, thats why you need boards  big flat shallow bays  it may be a bit different here because we are in 14 but its kinda like inland lakes rather than great lakes up the St Marys"
967980,AKRISONER,2016-04-28 18:56:00,5558,sounds like they are in the same place the pike are hanging out  was seeing piles of them in the shallows two weeks ago.
