969007,Mister G,2016-05-09 10:29:00,1429,"An onboard charger is not a ""maintainer"". It's designed to charge at high amps and shut off when done. As batteries get older they have a very bad habit of not shutting off and continuing to boil away with the last ""count down"" light still on and not shutting off.  Maintainers, at least older models, have a bad reputation of sulphating batteries 'til they short out.  I do nothing special, charge the batteries properly (after a load test) and let them sit for months. Repeat. Has worked for 40 years or so for me.. My plow trucks batteries are now both 13 years old, still both pull 1100 CCA as of yesterday when I checked them, then a full charge overnight so the truck can sit until Fall. Most modern day on-board chargers have several modes and a maintainer mode is one of them......  Maybe you should read the manual from this manufacture that I have on my boat and it's plugged in ALL the time I'm not fishing and I have one 9 year old battery and one 7 year old battery.  http://promariner.com/products/waterproof-on-board-marine-battery-chargers/prosport-series/"
969008,Mister G,2016-05-09 10:36:00,1429,"My understanding is that along with the radios maintaining memory, the internal or external puck antenna to the GPS graph will also draw current if left connected. Even though the unit/s are switched off. This is true on the older units that have a external puck antenna that is powered by a network or units that have a separate power wire to power the external puck antenna without a network like a Lowrance LMS unit for a example. Now with the new HDS units that have built in GPS antennas all the power is controlled by the power button on that unit. However, if that unit is hooked up to a NMEA network system, then that network must have it's own power supply and MUST be controlled with a switch or you will have a drain on the battery and it's not good to have the network powered all the time the boat in not being used. If that network is powering say a Point 1 puck antenna because this is a much better GPS antenna then any built in antenna you could burn out this puck antenna if it's constantly powered and of course drain your battery."

Btw...battery life has a lot to do with how much you use them. I pretty much kill my deep cycles everytime im on the water because i do a lot of slow trolling eyes with my bowmount. I get 4-5 years out of them on a good one. I charge every time i use them with an automatic deep cycle charger on 10 amp setting  and check the water level every couple months. If you dont drain them flat every time they will last a lot longer. I should really invest in a small gas kicker.....  S."

So I installed a disconnect switch for the cranking battery (been having a battery draining issue but that's another post). So the lazy guy solution was the 3 position switch that will allow the new auto bildge to be running while the main electrical is off. Anyway she's running just fine and I'm still a Deka fan! Thanks again folks for all the help!"
968913,bigbuck,2016-05-08 11:57:00,2449,Thats good news. You should get a voltmeter and track down what is draining your battery though. Youtube university and a voltmeter are all you need...that is unless one of our more learned members pipes up and helps which will probably happen anyways.
968917,captpierre,2016-05-08 12:59:00,2521,I used to bring it in on wood. Last 5 yrs just leave it in the boat during the winter with the positive wires disconnected. A slow charge for 3-4 hrs in spring. Good to go.
968921,Fisherman,2016-05-08 13:30:00,7201,"Battery draining can be as simple as one draining into another if they are wired in parallel and are equalizing to the battery of the lowest capacity.  Otherwise, get a multimeter (one with a 10amp setting preferably),  take off the positive battery cable and put the voltmeter between the + post and + cable, any voltage with everything off will give you a reading.  Pull fuses one at a time until you get a zero reading, poof, there's you culprit.  Then isolate that circuit to see where it's grounding out or using power.  Some boat radios, AM/FM and VHF will draw just to keep the radio station memory alive."

After sitting for awhile in the hangar I walked by it one day and could hear the throttle servo hunting for home position, even with the unit turned off. Had wondered what killed the battery the year before, so I now pull the power head off the wires to the engine and no longer have any issues. I charge my AGM's for each engine just before the end of the year (after Musky fishing) and again somewhere in late Feb I give them a check out. Then again in May before heading for the lake. Trolling motor batteries get plugged into the onboard charger the same three times, paying careful attention that the lights cycle through to off within 12 hours. Then she gets unplugged.

That is your simplest course of action. If it starts, your battery is pooched. If not, check to see if anything electrical works or not, power trim, lights, radio..... if they work, you may have a blown main fuse to the motor.

968767,Carp,2016-05-06 14:18:00,1488,"If the battery cables aren't tightly secured to the post/screw, or there's a bit of corrosion, the starter doesn't receive the electrical current it should. Sometimes it will may start the motor, but not getting as much juice as it should.  Last summer we rented a cottage for a week in July. Battery was fully charged and started the motor fine on the first day. The second day I could tell could tell the starter seemed a bit weaker. Third day, it barely got the motor going. Thought the battery was toast. Disconnected all the wiring and used some sandpaper on the wire ends (connecting terminals). A quick scrub on the battery terminals with a wire brush and put it all back together. No more issues.  That's the first thing I would do. If the battery still doesn't start the motor, try a different battery (car,truck, another boat, etc.) Or, as mentioned, connect the booster cables directly to the solenoid. If the motor starts with a different battery/cables and you've cleaned the connections, you can just about guarantee your battery is the problem.  When storing the boat for the winter, I disconnect all the wires connected to the battery. Some black electrical tape wound around the negative wires keeps them separated from the positives. I wrap tape around the positive wires too, but it's easy to distinguish between the two groups of wires. After that, I take the battery inside to my basement and put it on a piece of 2 x 8"" plank, as large as the base of the battery or even slightly larger. I read somewhere that putting the battery on a concrete floor can cause damage to the plates over time. Not sure if it's true, but why take the chance. I always have pieces of wood laying around the house from various projects.  Hope you figure it out and get on the water soon. Let us know what the problem was."
