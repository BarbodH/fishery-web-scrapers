968442,misfish,2016-05-03 23:09:00,29133,"Got a great deal on a lot of lures today, There was one that came with it and it has no brand name on it, It,s older from what I can tell by the hardware used.  So,  thoughts or anyone know what it is? It comes accross as a kwikfish.  Oh and yes, Im going to use it. Unless it,s worth millions of dollars.LOL          "

968457,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-04 00:16:00,8243,Quickfish wearing a prophylactic? I don't know how it's going to track in the water with the red dress on it. It looks Frankenlured for sure. Give it a cast and report back G.

968461,porkpie,2016-05-04 00:36:00,2521,One off prototype?  I have a one off lure from a guy that tried his hand at lure design.  That's my guess anyway.
