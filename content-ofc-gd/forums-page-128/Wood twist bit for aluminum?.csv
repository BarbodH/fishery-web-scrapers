969096,boombap,2016-05-09 22:14:00,310,"Looking to drill a 3/4' hole in my boat to run some wires, will a standard irwin wood bit work or will I mangle the aluminum? Sharp edges are ok since it will be getting a gasket around it."
969098,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-09 22:20:00,10439,"If you mean a spade bit like in the pic below. It will work as long as it's one of the ones with the points on the end. It will wear out quickly and you need to go slowly, but it will work in a pinch. I use either a hole saw or UNI bit when I need to run stuff in my boat.  "
969100,boombap,2016-05-09 22:48:00,310,I meant one of these    I fear a spade bit will butcher it.
969101,wormdunker,2016-05-09 22:55:00,1711,"That particular bit will bite in & pull the drill in very quickly, so you want to ensure there is nothing behind your surface that will be damaged. (wiring)  Go slow & hold on tight to the drill, pulling back toward you with a little pressure.  I would prefer a 3/4"" bit you would normally use to drill steel.  Good luck!"
969104,leaf4,2016-05-09 23:08:00,2466,"Just a regular drill bit should do the trick, or a uni bit as suggested"
969105,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-09 23:15:00,8243,"Get the right tool for the job. In this case a metal hole saw bit. You will be able to use the proper bit afterwards but it may kill your wood bit after maybe 1 use only. Borrow one. and . I know of more than 1 person that has bought a tool from HD then brought it back once they are done. Me, never."
969106,FishFinder17,2016-05-09 23:19:00,139,"I was in a pinch and needed to drill a hole in the storage bin of my tracker to run some wire. It was through aluminum and it ended up working. I started the hole with a self tapping screw so the threaded tip of the bit would stay in one place.  There's probably a better bit for the job, but in my case I had already made 37 trips to Home Depot for this project and didn't feel like making another one..."
969114,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-10 00:09:00,10439,I meant one of these    I fear a spade bit will butcher it.  Those would be auger bits. If you are going to try pre-drill a pilot hole the size of the widest point on the screw tip so it doesn't draw the flutes into the metal. You want to go slow and with light pressure. Spade bits actually work pretty good in aluminium as the points on the tips of the wings cut through without chewing up the metal. But as I said with either type of bit the key is light pressure and low RPM.

Thanks for the offer but I was able to do it with a old spade bit and some wd40.  Now if you had some 1"" rubber grommets laying around I wouldn't mind taking one of your hands.. lol.  I checked home depot/lowes but the biggest was 3/4. I'm thinking west marine. Anyone?"
969132,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-10 02:28:00,10439,Try Canadian Tire.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/hillman-rubber-grommets-1612746p.html#.VzFG4fkrKM8  Napa or electrical supply houses would be a couple of other places to try.

Slice it lengthwise and cut it to length to suit the hole diameter. Sorry - no photo handy. If I'm not explaining it well let me know."

969135,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-10 02:40:00,8243,No you're not. I'm not the most mechanically sharp tool in the box. Please excuse my ignorance. What does a piece of rubber tube have to do with drilling a hole?

969145,DanD,2016-05-10 10:36:00,2223,Next time try one of these step drill bits.    You can get them at Princess Auto.  http://www.princessauto.com/en/detail/g-r-i-p-2-pc-jumbo-titanium-coated-high-speed-steel-step-drill-bit-set/A-p8487035e  The quality is about normal for PA stuff; but it'll work long enough for the number of holes I'd ever need to drill that large.
