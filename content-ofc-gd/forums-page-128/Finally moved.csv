Also a roomier house for my granddaughter to grow into. I even get a dedicated fishing room.  Now to spend a week unpacking so I can get back to making tackle."

Larger house and much smaller yard. So I should have a little more fishing time. Even have me a room just for all my, and my grandkids, fishing swag and tackle making."
