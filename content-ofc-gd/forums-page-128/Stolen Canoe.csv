968872,MistyHollow,2016-05-08 00:30:00,21,"According to the video 11:23 pm Wed. May 4th two people stole my canoe from the Caledonia Auto Body property. This canoe was there for a repair and paint.  If anyone knows or hears of the two that did this theft please inform them that I would like it returned. They can drop it off in the same place, no questions asked.....or I can turn the video over to the police.....the one where you looked directly into the camera.  Dan"
968875,Joeytier,2016-05-08 00:48:00,3990,It may help if you post some specifics about the canoe.
968902,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-08 11:11:00,8243,"Turn the video into the police, now. You may not get your canoe back even if they are convicted. I think both you and I know where it is most likely. My wife works in Caledonia and I'm surprised her car hasn't been stolen yet. Average of 1 vehicle a year is taken from their parking lot on Argyle in broad daylight, the main street in town. Sick pricks."

968942,glen,2016-05-08 15:53:00,2641,I can't see the picture.  I hope you get your canoe back.
968945,KLINKER,2016-05-08 16:31:00,256,A Judge might frown on you trying to make a deal with a thief and not order restitution. Call the cops.
969001,chris.brock,2016-05-09 02:56:00,4053,"The police don't really do much in that neck of the woods, I'd say post the video here as a long shot to get your canoe back"
969157,BillM,2016-05-10 12:17:00,17367,The shop should have insurance to cover that.
969158,craigdritchie,2016-05-10 12:27:00,1586,"The shop should have insurance to cover that.  Deductible might be more than the canoe is worth. Depends on the policy of course, but on a commercial property a $5k deductible is fairly common.  That said, if the shop took it in for work, they are responsible for it."
