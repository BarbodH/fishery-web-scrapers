969051,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-09 15:50:00,10439,Go see Tom @ Angling Specialties.
969060,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-09 17:18:00,479,Go see Tom @ Angling Specialties.  Ditto!  I brought in a rod to him to have a new set of guides put on an older rod. He's up along Hwy. 7 and is usually there on Wednesdays & Fridays. The guy is a legend.  I think his wife does the guides and wraps and he turns the handles.

969064,jedimaster,2016-05-09 17:47:00,3472,Awesome. I will go by and drop them off. Hopefully they can turn them around for me in time.
