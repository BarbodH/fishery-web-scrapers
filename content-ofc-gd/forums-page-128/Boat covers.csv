Just wondering what people are using and whats a good quality cover to buy.  Thanks!"
968632,NANUK,2016-05-05 16:29:00,797,"A good quality cover is a custom cover made with Top Gun or Sunbrella material, Not cheap to buy but much cheaper and way better in a long run."
968651,Paudash,2016-05-05 19:26:00,273,I have found a $1000 plus custom cover last 5-10 years a good cover for $500 last 3-5 years  After my $500 cover ripped a few years ago I have gone to the CND Tire covers that go on sale all the time for $75 and they last 2-3 years  But I am cheap and I love my boat and the way it looks but when the cover is on it I don't really care but when it is off it looks good
968652,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-05 19:36:00,10439,"My boat stays in a portable garage so the only thing I use a cover for @ this point is to keep dust and dirt out of it when it's not being used. Have been using a cheap ebay purchase for close to 10 years, but it never gets exposed to the elements. I don't trailer with it because it wouldn't last a season. If I needed one for trailering and or it's exposed to the elements 24/7 I would purchase a custom for it."
968666,AdamS,2016-05-05 21:31:00,161,"I think my last one was a cheaper one. But I'm thinking custom is the way to go, it just depends on how much it actually costs.  Do any of you know of somewhere reputable I could go to price one out? I'm in Burlington now but gta is fine."

Haven't been there for a long time."

968742,AdamS,2016-05-06 12:34:00,161,"Thanks for the info guys! Tom, is greg the person I should be trying to contact?"
968771,Tom McCutcheon,2016-05-06 14:41:00,627,"Yep...I think Greg is the proprietor...and the fellow I was speaking with. That's the name on the business card I picked up at the Boat Show this year.  I don't know what his work is like, but he seemed knowledgeable and the website looks professional."
968782,Rattletrap2,2016-05-06 16:04:00,1652,This is another Greg! Great guy to deal with and does excellent work! http://www.coversunlimited.ca/
968783,AdamS,2016-05-06 16:23:00,161,Thanks Rattletrap!  I'll look into them as well.
968789,Dan668,2016-05-06 18:57:00,1120,"I just had my cover made by covers unlimited,  no issues.  Good work,  great price."
968925,Tybo,2016-05-08 13:51:00,1373,the colour of the tarp has alot too do with longevity also.light tan and light grey seam to last the longest. had one made last year from top gun. 900 for a custom.
968938,Moosebunk,2016-05-08 15:20:00,3970,"A good quality cover is a custom cover made with Top Gun or Sunbrella material, Not cheap to buy but much cheaper and way better in a long run.  Lund cover tore to shreds in three years.  Top Gun custom for less $$$ to replace, 10 year warranty on work, 7 year on material (or maybe that is backwards) and the cover after 3 years shows no real signs of wear.  But you`re a little far from Carp Ontario to drop your boat off for the work."
