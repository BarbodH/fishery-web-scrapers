The abandoned camper trailer was used as an ice fishing hut last winter, but became mostly submerged when the ice melted. The top of the trailer can be seen from the end of Chemin Terry Fox, which separates Gatineau from the Municipality of Pontiac. It sits about 100 metres from shore, roughly on the border between the two jurisdictions. Frustrated residents living nearby told CBC the two municipalities have been squabbling over which is responsible for removing the trailer from the water.  Link has more details."
