968406,lakerguy,2016-05-03 16:07:00,224,"Well.....made a few phone calls last night on places around our area to store boat. (neighbour of ours gave me a few contacts) I brought up his name with one of the fellas I was chatting with and it's clear this guy has a bit of a reputation in the area. Looks like we found a good spot now,told him what our plans are and who uses the boat etc etc. all good."
968407,GBW,2016-05-03 16:10:00,8460,"ok, then i would say you paid for boat/trailer parking and it should not make any difference who hooks on to  the trailer  to launch the boat he is tiring to screw you YUP  Think he,s being a bit of a dick myself. YUP!!!"
968408,lakerguy,2016-05-03 16:11:00,224,"Ya,apparently he is....both. Couple of the stories I heard last night. Few years ago he tried to screw a cottage owner over a dock build I guess that went to court. 3500$ dock turned into over 9 grand."
968409,lakerguy,2016-05-03 16:16:00,224,"Other than the parking deal I had with him I never really knew much about him. Just to say hi and a bit of small talk here and there. I'm not one for confrontation,so I will just likely avoid him in the future"
968418,irishfield,2016-05-03 17:02:00,26272,"All I can add is your problem certainly isn't going to get solved here, go see the guy.. you're paying HIM after all. See what the deal is for real and what the issue is. Could be something as simple as he thinks your family members should have registered with him, for all he knows the strange vehicle is stealing your boat.  Not a lot different than a campground. You pay for your seasonal site and it includes you, wife and kids. Visitors pay extra to stay overnight. Others are not generally allowed to just show up and use your trailer."
968420,lakerguy,2016-05-03 18:06:00,224,He did however knew who was going to be using the boat.
968441,aplumma,2016-05-03 23:08:00,6896,Looks like lakerguy has all of the info. needed to go forth and be happy.   Art
968303,lakerguy,2016-05-02 16:44:00,224,"I have a boat only access cottage in northern Ontario. I decided last season to rent a parking spot at a outfitter close to the boat launch for my boat instead of towing it home every trip. My family members use my boat while at the cottage. Last summer the outfitter owner gave my family members a bit of grief,saying they didn't pay him for the use of the parking spot. I paid for the spot thinking that the payment went with the boat,not with who was using the boat. If that's the case the parking spot would have been paid for by 4 family members for one boat. Just trying to get my head around if I'm in the wrong here...."
968304,BillM,2016-05-02 16:49:00,17367,"If there's only ever one car parked in your spot at a time, then I don't see a problem (Shouldn't matter whos car it is)   I'd probably call the outfitter and figure out what his/her issue is."
968307,Carp,2016-05-02 17:05:00,1488,"If the boat trailer remains on the property after launching and you park a car beside the boat trailer or elsewhere on the property, there's 2 spots taken up. If a car is the only thing in the spot where the boat goes, not an issue as far as I can tell.  Where did you park the cars & trucks and boat trailer before using this outfitter's property ? Might be time to explore other options or work out something out with this guy if you need additional spaces while at the cottage.  Good Luck !"
968315,dave524,2016-05-02 17:46:00,4508,"When I had a season's launch pass, I had a window sticker for my vehicle. I know it is not quite the same thing but it didn't matter if I launched a different boat every time as long the vehicle remained the same."
968321,Terry,2016-05-02 18:44:00,14456,not enough info to give a good answer
968322,Sinker,2016-05-02 19:03:00,8692,"I don't know if your talking about a parking spot for a vehicle, or a boat slip. Need some clarification.  S."
968324,lakerguy,2016-05-02 19:21:00,224,"Sorry for the lack of info guys here's some more..the parking spot is for the boat when we are not there. I can park my truck and trailer in the spot when boat is in water. When my family members go up they never park their vehicle in his lot,only the trailer and leave their car or truck where everyone else parks on a crown land spot that multiple vehicles also use. His problem is when they come he confronts them saying they aren't the ones that own the boat and should have to pay up."
968325,mike rousseau,2016-05-02 19:27:00,4661,That's weird  Your renting a space..... Shouldn't matter in my opinion...  If you had different boats using the space i'd understand as some places charge by the foot  Is he asking for money to park or to launch the boat?
968326,lakerguy,2016-05-02 19:34:00,224,"i find that he's just trying to pull more money out of our pockets. When he confronted my brother as he was hitching up the boat last season he said to him""you should have to pay up too,since your using the boat too"""
968327,lakerguy,2016-05-02 19:36:00,224,
968328,lakerguy,2016-05-02 19:38:00,224,We don't use his launch as there is a public launch 300ft away. His launch is to mucked up
968331,Terry,2016-05-02 19:41:00,14456,so  the boat on the trailer is parked when youre not there   the you put the boat in the water and the trailer goes back to the parking spot and they park truck on crown land  or does it stay with the trailer
968332,lakerguy,2016-05-02 19:47:00,224,"If my other family members go up,the trailer gets parked back into the spot where the boat came from. They then go back out onto a clearing that has lots of parking. They never park their vehicle in his lot.  I'm the only one that paid for a parking spot while I'm there."
968333,lakerguy,2016-05-02 19:49:00,224,
968335,206,2016-05-02 20:08:00,563,sSounds like the guy is just miserable lol ...good looking out that he confronts people trying to take your boat. Sounds like you never mentioned to him that others would be accessing the boat? I'd be sure at the start of the season to have your fam with you when you meet the guy to make arrangements. Let him meet the people using the boat and let him know the vehicles that will be coming and going.  Best thing to do is iron out ALL the details before you start.  I'd be a lil off side as well if i had an arrangement with one guy then a dozen end up coming and going.
968336,Terry,2016-05-02 20:09:00,14456,"ok, then i would say you paid for boat/trailer parking and it should not make any difference who hooks on to  the trailer  to launch the boat he is tiring to screw you"
968337,misfish,2016-05-02 20:20:00,29133,"Think he,s being a bit of a dick myself."
968339,Sinker,2016-05-02 20:26:00,8692,YUP!  S.
968340,Carp,2016-05-02 20:31:00,1488,"So if I'm understanding correctly, you pay for a spot that is big enough to park both your boat trailer and car / truck while at the cottage. When your family goes up, they launch the boat, put the trailer back on the outfitter's property and park their vehicle on Crown Land.  I don't understand why this outfitter has a problem with this ? Same boat & trailer, same parking spot and your family doesn't even park their vehicle on his property.  Hope it all works out Let us know."
968341,lakerguy,2016-05-02 20:33:00,224,He has met my brothers multiple times
968342,lakerguy,2016-05-02 20:35:00,224,"Yep, that's pretty much it"
968345,SmokestackLightnin,2016-05-02 21:00:00,390,"I have a water access property as well.  Up until this year I parked my boat at a drive-to resort.  They had 1 reserved parking spot for me and 1 reserved dock slip for my boat.  I show-up, park my car, get in my boat and go to the cottage (repeat if necessary).  The cost was $500/season.  Season ran from May to end of October.  Now seeing this resort has a limited season and it is in my best interest that the resort stays in business I need to support the resort.  So, for any vehicle other them my truck or my wife's car we paid.  Even if I had guests staying at the cottage and I was not there and my parking spot stayed opened I made sure the first option is the guests paid.  I mean it was like $20 - $30 for a week parking, in a resort where there was always people there and never an issue with a break-in or vandalism.  Now, to be fair, I am in my fifties and most of friends are there too, so $20 - $30 is not an issue.  On occasion, younger relatives or friends of our kids would show up and all it took was a conversation with the resort owner  to ask if it was OK for them to use my spot.  He never said no."
968346,lakerguy,2016-05-02 21:00:00,224,His comment is the others should have to pay too cause they use the boat.  That's the part I don't get with him
968399,Dara,2016-05-03 14:51:00,3052,Maybe he thinks he owns the boat and is renting it out.  I guess you gotta have a little chat with him to iron it out.  The last thing you need is for him to say you can't park the boat there anymore
968401,BillM,2016-05-03 15:10:00,17367,His comment is the others should have to pay too cause they use the boat. That's the part I don't get with him  It's your boat.....  This guy sounds like a jackass or just really REALLY stupid.
