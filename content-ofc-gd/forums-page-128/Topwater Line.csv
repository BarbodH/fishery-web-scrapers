968755,AdamS,2016-05-06 13:37:00,161,"Just curious, what are you guys using for line for your topwater rods? I've been using straight braid for a while now but was debating going to mono this year. I know some guys love using just mono and some do the leader so wanted to know what others are using."
968758,BillM,2016-05-06 13:50:00,17367,"I run braid with heavy mono leaders (Usually 30lb or so)...  I fish a lot of topwater during the season (pike, bass, etc).   Not a huge fan of mono as a mainline for that type of fishing.  I realize why some guys like it, but it's not for me."
968760,Tom S,2016-05-06 14:05:00,362,"I prefer a weight forward floating 7, with a stiff mono leader....."
968762,Garnet,2016-05-06 14:09:00,2056,I fish 20 braid and2 ft of flouro. Just keeps the bug weight forward to over work it.
968770,Lape0019,2016-05-06 14:32:00,647,"Strait braid mostly. I do have another rod I throw buzzbaits with that has mono but 90% of the time, its 30 pound braid."
968776,captpierre,2016-05-06 15:15:00,2521,"Mentioned this before. I think the stretch mono gives is useful when targeting smallies. When they are airborne, that head shake towards you will create slack with no-stretch lines. Lost a lot of jumpers that way."
968779,bare foot wader,2016-05-06 15:38:00,1354,"depends on the style of top water really...open water hard baits with trebles I prefer mono and medium action...top water in the slop with frogs, buzzbaits, etc I like braid and usually heavy leader"
968785,manitoubass2,2016-05-06 16:40:00,11391,Straight braid for me
968787,Brettiop,2016-05-06 18:30:00,279,"depends on the style of top water really...open water hard baits with trebles I prefer mono and medium action...top water in the slop with frogs, buzzbaits, etc I like braid and usually heavy leader  This exactly"
968868,salmon,2016-05-07 23:38:00,334,Imo For topwater i use braid with at least 20 lb flouro. The flouro is stiff so it does not wrap @ the lure a easy as straight braid
968882,4x4bassin,2016-05-08 02:06:00,1025,I use to use braid but tended to lose a lot of fish on the hook set and when they cleared the water during the fight . Straight mono for me now with no problems . The mono gives you some stretch during those lure throwing leaps and the initial hook set . With braid if your (trigger happy) you will pull the lure away a lot of the times . If I'm in the slop well that's a bit different like others have said and it's braid for me. No experience with flouro on top water but I do know that it sinks a lot faster then the other lines and on most top water baits that could hinder the action a little bit .
968887,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-08 02:30:00,8243,"Braid and Seagar flouro for spinning reels and Big Game mono with a Seagar fluorocarbon leader for baitcasting. The lb. test depends on may factors, including what's on sale. I haven't used a metal leader for years."
968888,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-08 02:35:00,8243,"I don't know about that. I think loosing Smallies has more to do with the size of hole the hook makes but of course it shouldn't come out if tight, I'll give you that. If a fish jumps towards you slack is slack no matter what type of line."
968890,manitoubass2,2016-05-08 02:44:00,11391,With braid(at least for me) I can feel when the fish is gonna jump so I have like 2-3 seconds to tighten the line  Ill still lose the odd one though but not very often
968892,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-08 03:06:00,8243,"I'm going to start calling you "" The Bass whisperer""."
968896,manitoubass2,2016-05-08 03:19:00,11391, The bass here are so plentiful you can literally do no wrong  If I took any of you doods from southern ontario out here bass fishing you would laugh at how easy it is  Unless its winter. Ive literally caught one bass through the ice lol
968901,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-08 10:57:00,8243,"You forget I told you we can watch the bass spawn on their beds here from my deck? There can be no less than a dozen beds within sight, imagine how many along a shore line from Fort Erie to Windsor? Around 400KM."
968904,manitoubass2,2016-05-08 11:16:00,11391,Yeah thats crazy to even think about.
968959,Garnet,2016-05-08 20:47:00,2056,"We all give braid to much credit. It's garbage just like mono,co polymer spider wire, flouro all garbage.  Here's my proof.  Google ice fishing perch lake Simcoe. With a little work you will find some idiot blathering away about how great braid is and a perch is just mowing down on his jig. Stupid will be telling how great braid and he never misses hookset bla bla bla. If it's that good why did that perch get away.  Braid is just braid if you are a bad angler you still will be a bad angler after you spend $20."
968962,manitoubass2,2016-05-08 21:02:00,11391,All line is garbage?  Hehehe  We just all have our preferences  You are correct though. A crappy angler is a crappy angler
968973,BillM,2016-05-08 22:42:00,17367,Line definitely isn't going to help someone that isn't paying attention
968978,Garnet,2016-05-08 23:28:00,2056,"If you find one of these vids and watch it, should be obvious when a perch is laying beating on that perch jig for thirty seconds how nothing we have is as good as the fish. And even better they all have a mock 783 4 barrel fish finder that just made them great.  Mmmmmm you look great another minute or 2 and that perch should chew the line in half."
969031,AKRISONER,2016-05-09 13:06:00,5558,"Bill Put me on Braid to a raven xxxs swivel, to a heavy mono leader to a snap...been using it every since and loving it.  I use it for morning and evening smallmouth and pike fishing all the time."
969056,Garnet,2016-05-09 16:18:00,2056,Lets face it Erie smally's are just stupid and you likely can drag 80 braid and still catch them.
969070,grimsbylander,2016-05-09 18:19:00,3016,Lets face it Erie smally's are just stupid and you likely can drag 80 braid and still catch them. Maybe. But not if you want to cash a cheque.
