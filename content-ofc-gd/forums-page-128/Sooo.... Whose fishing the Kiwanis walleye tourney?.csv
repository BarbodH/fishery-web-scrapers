968562,Gerritt,2016-05-04 23:51:00,6129,"Unfortunately I will be unable to fish it this year due to work... However, if any of you guys are in the area we could do a mini OFC meet and greet in the evening!  Anyone gonna be down in Quinte this weekend?  G"
968593,Sinker,2016-05-05 04:39:00,8692,"I am tossing the idea around, but i cant stand the opening day gong show. I will probably head down tues or wed instead.  S."
968595,Garnet,2016-05-05 10:18:00,2056,Signed and ready to go. No 2nd place finishes this year.
968645,Consigliere,2016-05-05 18:24:00,121,In the tourney but don't fish quinte. Stay away from the gong show. Is a long run if we have a good fish which means we will only go if we have a top 3. Last year we didn't run in for believe what would've been 5-6 place on pike if our scale is any where close to accurate
968715,Sinker,2016-05-06 04:06:00,8692,You target pike dont you? My buddy and his son are always top 3 too. Im pretty sure you follow them to their spot LOL   Just a rumour i heard going around  S.
968733,Garnet,2016-05-06 10:07:00,2056,No worry's losers are always wining.
968754,Sinker,2016-05-06 13:35:00,8692,Haha....how many boats have you won??  S.
968761,Garnet,2016-05-06 14:07:00,2056,That's my goal. The only boat I've won is a fold out 12 fter. Ton's of cash just no boats. If I win it will be for sale.
968831,Sinker,2016-05-07 10:02:00,8692,Good luck. My bud kept his boat. Nice little rig. Im headed out now. Staying just down from perfect vue for the weekend. Maybe see you on the water.  S.
968960,Garnet,2016-05-08 20:57:00,2056,"Yep I suck will we suck.  I would like congratulate Dave Chong he likely won the boat.  We were in 4th which is way better than 2nd. Well we stood there Dave's fish came in but he already had a 11lber in,and the guys behind us weight 3 and 2 knock use down. This morning we were in 9th an fell to 10th. We likely maybe broke even."
968964,Garnet,2016-05-08 21:43:00,2056,Another interesting thing. WE caught a smallish pike spitting eggs all over the carpet.
