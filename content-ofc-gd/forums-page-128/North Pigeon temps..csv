968958,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-08 19:45:00,2582,Got a bunch yesterday from one of my shore spots on Sturgeon...there was nothing there last weekend though. It should be prime when we are up from May 13-23  for a weeks holidays. The spot Beansie and I got them last Tuesday is always an early spot. Lotsa spring/early summer locations should be starting up anytime now.
