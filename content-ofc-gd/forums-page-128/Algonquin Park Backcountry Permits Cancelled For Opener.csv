966953,muskymatt,2016-04-19 17:13:00,2608,Oh and I was talking to one of the ranger cabin operators just Sunday and all roads in were still snow covered but they were optimistic that the 28th would happen.
966960,Dara,2016-04-19 18:24:00,3052,All you guys need is a good day of rain now...that will take care of the ice
966988,jimmer,2016-04-19 20:42:00,2730,If I worked there I wouldn't want to have to deal with all those unhappy campers that came from the city thinking that the lakes were open and ready to go. I'm sure there will still be some showing up without the knowledge anyways. Making an announcement covers their behinds.

967363,SirCranksalot,2016-04-22 22:14:00,3291,"http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/news/ice-out.php  ""Some beaver ponds and the shallowest lakes at lower elevations in Algonquin Park have developed some open water. However, nearly all lakes in Algonquin Park will remain ice covered for the opening of trout fishing season on April 23, 2016. Bare ground is widespread in deciduous forests and on south-facing slopes, but knee-deep snow persists in many shaded areas. Many facilities in Algonquin Park will remain closed for this weekend including some campgrounds, backcountry access points, snow covered and/or muddy roads, plus several inaccessible trails. Secondary gravel roads providing access to the Park's backcountry are currently closed to public travel with many gated or barricaded to prevent infrastructure damage"""
967368,muskymatt,2016-04-22 23:19:00,2608,Tomorrow will be the test on if it opens on the 28th! Fingers crossed.
967623,KEVERS,2016-04-25 16:04:00,10,I have plans to go in on April 28th to North Tea. I called the Whitny office today they said that a chopper was going up either on the 26th or 29th. I asked him what he thought and he said the park would likely NOT be opening for the 28th of April.
967658,muskymatt,2016-04-25 19:59:00,2608,I have talked to Wendy at the park office. She said an ice out update will be posted late today or tomorrow morning. The new park opener date has been set for May 6th. No backwoods treks until then. Bummer!!
967704,Joeytier,2016-04-25 23:47:00,3990,100% not happening.
967757,colin519,2016-04-26 14:38:00,101,I've had a permit for the 29th for a few months now. Not looking good.  If any has other suggestions for this weekend I've started another thread. Would love other ideas as we wait to confirm the bad news today or tomorrow.
967758,Dara,2016-04-26 14:40:00,3052,If Kathleen and Dalton would have left well enough alone with global warming the ice would be gone and you would be fishing this weekend  :wallbash:

It's not just the lake ice that is the problem , the access roads are still snow covered (not maintained) and the portages are extremely icy and dangerous . An official release will be coming out this afternoon/evening ."

She suggested to call the park directly to verify this but they haven't heard anything of a May 6 opening.  Have fingers crossed she's correct, we go in May 4."
967844,colin519,2016-04-27 11:43:00,101,"Thank you, I spoke to my Canoe rental place and they are talking to a person at the Kearney permit office to clarify.  To the outfitters in the area, they are 5 days behind the season already. They want it open more than we do."
967855,Pickeral eater,2016-04-27 13:31:00,155,"Ok so just spoke with the lady from algonquins help desk.  Told her we have reservations for May 4 and she told me that we should be good to go.  Said that the park hopes to open may 4.  From what I gathered from the talk it's different depending on what access point you start from.  East side is at a lower elevation, therefore, a bit ahead of the west side which is ""still stuck in winter""."
967892,muskymatt,2016-04-27 20:02:00,2608,"Yes, they have moved it u to May 4th from the 6th for almost all the park. Some areas will be last minute decision though.

968288,Dara,2016-05-02 13:59:00,3052,"Report  I drove Hwy 17 Friday morning all lakes were ice free. There was a bit of snow on the north face of hillsides., All the roads as far as I could see were pretty much snow free...a couple trails seemed to have a little bit. Looked like there could be a few spots further in that you may have to trudge through a bit of snow. It wasn't perfect but from what I could see, nothing that would stop you. For sure things will be open the coming weekend.  Nippising was ice covered Friday morning when I went by and almost completely open when I passed again Sunday...some spots had a bit of black ice left but I would be out there if there was anything to fish for."

966357,4x4bassin,2016-04-14 03:28:00,1025,"For those that are interested , Ontario parks have closed the Algonquin backcountry until April 28 due to winter conditions , ice covered lakes and inaccessible snow covered roads . This date is subject to change but personally I think they won't be offering backcountry permits until the weekend of the 30th or into the first week of May . Seen some pictures from that area and it still looks like winter up there with at least 10 - 15 cm of snow on the ground and the lakes are still locked up to shore with ice . "

966401,Dara,2016-04-14 15:39:00,3052,Why would they cancel permits?
966404,4x4bassin,2016-04-14 15:46:00,1025,"^ I would assume they would cancel due to the winter conditions and you would not be getting around to well in a canoe . Dangerous situation I would imagine with the ice , might be some liability issue . Remember this is for back country permits ."

966418,irishfield,2016-04-14 17:11:00,26272,Just when we thought we'd get early ice out everywhere.. up North stayed -10C every night for the past month and Temagami got 2 feet of fresh powder late last week. Still sledding on the lakes and Cochrane is still grooming their sled trails!

I really know nothing of Algonquin rules"
966437,Joeytier,2016-04-14 19:17:00,3990,People need to be babysat.  I can only imagine how many people would just show up without even checking the conditions before making the drive up.

That may be true but Algonquin is totally surrounded by roads and civilization. If you count shear wilderness area around LSSP its about 20 times the size and other than the park proper, you don't have to register to go anywhere there.  I just kinda shake my head at them stopping people from entering just because they are worried you might hurt yourself there but there are no restrictions on anything any where else"

It would be irresponsible and foolish by Ontario parks to open up Algonquin when it's lakes are covered in unsafe ice and the portages would be like muddy skating rinks . The parks staff/OPP would be pushed to the max trying to save hypothermic backpackers and people trapped on portages with broken ankles/legs . You might shake your head at this policy but it is a fact , it would happen .

Many of the access points for canoeing are a considerable dist down dirt rds that get no winter maint. Nothing to do with babysitting, proximity to the GTA or other imaginary reasons!

It's updated frequently. I'v been doing backcountry trips way back in the park for many years and have been on lakes 2 days after ice out. When it happens, it happens quickly. Unfortunate thing now is it is still below zero at night. My guess is it will be very close getting ice out by the 28th. I sure hope so because my group has a trip out of Brent up the Petawawa booked on the 28th. Would really suck to have to reschedule. Not much you can do but keep checking the site for updates."
