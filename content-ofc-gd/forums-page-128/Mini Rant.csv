968691,DaveRoach,2016-05-06 02:37:00,202,"It's a rough life, man. Darn tooten"
968693,Dara,2016-05-06 02:44:00,3052,US order. send it to wiers furniture in Sault Mich and I'll pick it up and purolater it to you
968700,glen,2016-05-06 03:03:00,2641,That a boy Dara.  Get this thing fixed ASAP.  The season is short
968702,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-06 03:13:00,8243,"Buffalo isn't far from North York. 2 hours maybe. You can pick it up yourself Dave. Good luck. I truly believe in Manifest Destiny, maybe it wasn't meant to be for some cosmic reason beyond our capabilities to comprehend. It's no big deal in light of what is going on around us Dave, don't sweat the small stuff man."
968703,2 tone z71,2016-05-06 03:21:00,1311,What did that set up run ya if you don't mind me asking .I'm looking for something very similiar
968728,Big Cliff,2016-05-06 08:32:00,6899,You can have it sent FedEx over nignt if you really want it that badly.
968729,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-06 08:38:00,8243,"That's the best way Cliff, your right. As long as you don't get into brokers fees and customs duty. I think with Fed Ex you will."
968740,Big Cliff,2016-05-06 12:13:00,6899,"That's the best way Cliff, your right. As long as you don't get into brokers fees and customs duty. I think with Fed Ex you will. FedEx Priority includes freight and broker fees and it is quite reasonable if you need something in a hurry."
968741,Lape0019,2016-05-06 12:25:00,647,Call Ed at Paddletales Tackle. I am pretty sure he has a few cables in stock. He is in Winchester Ontario but he will ship it out to you if you ask.
968744,BillM,2016-05-06 12:50:00,17367,"Your spot lock will work just fine, use the iPilot link remote.  Once you get the ethernet cable, you can then control the Terrova from the 'bird."
968748,woodenboater,2016-05-06 13:12:00,2277,not familiar with the hardware you have but is the network cable a regular Cat5e cable or a proprietary cable ?
968750,BillM,2016-05-06 13:26:00,17367,not familiar with the hardware you have but is the network cable a regular Cat5e cable or a proprietary cable ?  Proprietary.   Looks like a old BNC network cable.
968753,G.mech,2016-05-06 13:34:00,830,"Like Bill said, you have all functions through the remote you just can control it from your chartplotter....have fun!"
968765,woodenboater,2016-05-06 14:17:00,2277,"man if the connectors are easy to find, should be too hard to make a bunch of cables up. Would be smart for a third party to make a Cat5 to BNC adapter"
968768,BillM,2016-05-06 14:26:00,17367,Problem with Cat5e is that the connections aren't watertight.   I dunno if I'd want them on a boat.
968772,DaveRoach,2016-05-06 14:42:00,202,
968773,DaveRoach,2016-05-06 14:48:00,202,"It was around 1850 plus mounting bracket, fuse, plug adapter, various cables. Using 899 at console and 859 at bow. Also purchased autochart pro for mapping lakes so I can utilize follow the contour (the feature that sold me on the unit) got the 899 SIDI for 800 and the 859 for 450."
968774,DaveRoach,2016-05-06 14:53:00,202,"Thanks for all the input, it should be at JBs next week, I will spend the weekend mapping the lake.  Just thought if they carry stock of motors and sonars, a few cables in stock would only make sense."
