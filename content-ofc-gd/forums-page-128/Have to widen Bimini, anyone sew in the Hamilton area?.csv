So I cut it down the middle and bought some matching material to add a 6"" strip in the middle. Its in the middle to avoid all tapers etc. and the easiest way for a quick sew job. Unfortunately my sisters sewing machine is in for repairs so she  unable to sew it for me.  Does anyone know of someone in the Hamilton/Burlington area that could do the job? The material is not thick, just plain tent material. (grey water resistant fabric)  Not looking for a super duper fancy professional sewing operation, I'm not picky, just would like done in the next 2 weeks.  If anyone knows someone good with a sewing machine that's interested just pm me and we can work out the $ details.  I've included pic in case I have made it sound tougher than it is.        "

They might also be a bit cheaper then an upholstery shop?  Dan."
