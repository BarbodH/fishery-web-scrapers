891261,Afraz,2015-01-09 05:35:00,250,"Anyone know where i can purchase reasonably priced mercury outboard parts ? I need the following: a spark plug wire/coil for the 3rd cylinder and a oil latch cover for the cowling  As you can see the inside is rusted compared to the other 2, and this rust has transferred over to the spark plug, causing problems.  Motor is a 1999 mercury 75 hp 2 stroke oil injected Thanks ! "

When I ordered it was seamless....and the parts arrived quickly.
