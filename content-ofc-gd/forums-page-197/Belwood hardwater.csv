890986,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-08 01:17:00,10439,I could ask my dad. He lives on the lake in Belwood.
890988,porkpie,2015-01-08 01:23:00,2521,They won't open it officially for a while yet.  We are making plenty of ice out this way though.  Call the park at 519-843 2979 and they'll let you know when they are thinking of opening.  They are super cautious!!  Often people will have been fishing on simcoe for several weeks before the park will open for ice fishing!
