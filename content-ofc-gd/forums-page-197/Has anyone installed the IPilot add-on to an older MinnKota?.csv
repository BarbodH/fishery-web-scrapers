890472,Raycaster,2015-01-05 22:37:00,528,Got my eye on an friends older MinnKota trolling motor but keep dreaming of the newer ipilot features.  I noticed there is a iPilot add-on available to equip older unit 1991 and up.  Can't afford a full blown unit but a gently used one with an option to upgrade sounds do-able.  Anyone tried this? thx ahead.  
890476,davey buoy,2015-01-05 22:46:00,5505,"Interesting you tube video showing a easy upgrade to your power drive motor.To add the i-pilot I believe it was about $700.I'm always thinking,Maybe  lol."
890477,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-05 22:56:00,10439,IPilot upgrade is available for the Powerdrive V2 motors. Unfortunately my motor is a Powerdrive V1.
890484,Raycaster,2015-01-05 23:21:00,528,"My mistake... The copilot (NOT iPILOT) option is $150, the transmitter is $50 and the wireless pedal is $100, useable with V1 and V2. Looks like $449 (IPilot for PDV2), another $50 for transmitter...  There goes my cheap anchor lock dream..."
890492,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-05 23:45:00,10439,"Yep, I added the Co-Pilot to my Powerdrive V1 and it is nice. Didn't bother with the wireless pedal as the wired one still works with the co-pilot."
890555,porkpie,2015-01-06 02:27:00,2521,"Copilot is still totally worth it!  I have a V1 and the copilot is the best upgrade I think you can possibly make!  I haven't used the foot pedal since!  If you go on to walleye central, there are guys who have modified the V1's with a V2 motherboard, and installed Ipilot."
890633,Sinker,2015-01-06 14:35:00,8692,"co pilot is just the handheld remote, no?  I don't really see much advantage to that for my fishing style.  S."
890649,Bondar,2015-01-06 15:18:00,817,"I have a bunch of power drive stuff I'll be listing soon, can maybe being the cost down, I have 3 wired pedals, 2 remotes, co-pilot most of it new . I just need some time to go over it and see what I have"
890653,BillM,2015-01-06 15:24:00,17367,"If you install I-Pilot on a older Powerdrive unit, you cannot control the boat with the foot pedal if the I-Pilot if engaged..  It's either or, not both like a new Terrova that's got it built in."
890681,wormdunker,2015-01-06 17:24:00,1711,Yup.  Co pilot is the wireless remote.  I love it!
890707,AKRISONER,2015-01-06 19:18:00,5558,"not gonna lie, just personal preference here...yes co pilot is amazing, the GPS feature is awesome for hitting your local honey holes effortlessly but it also has its downfall of the fact that its clumsy when you are trying to fish.  really think about how you fish before dropping a pile of cash.  To be honest if you are a bass fisherman covering ground constantly shorelines etc...foot pedal is better, it drives me crazy in the wind when i constantly have to stop reeling to re-adjust the boat so that i dont end up on the rocks etc.  However the anchor feature etc is the best"
890819,linweir,2015-01-07 03:03:00,202,Mine is MinnKota Terrova Autopilot. Is it easy to upgrade to ipilot?  I might be interested.
