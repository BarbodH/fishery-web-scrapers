However there are some permanant ones placed by yet again crazy folks.  Go by foot, and for God sakes bring a spud and a set of picks. Stay away from rivers and creek mouths where ever there is current.  The picton/sandbanks area just received a foot of snow... I would avoid that area.   For me personally I would want to see some extended cold weather. But that's based on my comfort level.  G"
