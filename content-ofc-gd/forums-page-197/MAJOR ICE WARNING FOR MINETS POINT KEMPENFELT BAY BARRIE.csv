890904,misfish,2015-01-07 21:24:00,29133,I STOPPED BY AFTER WORK AT 3:45 PM TODAY. THERE IS A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION GOING ON. LOTS OF HOLES ARE BEING CHAIN SAWED. THEY LOOKED TO BE 3 FT TRIANGLES.THEY SEEM TO BE PUTTING THE CUT PIECES ON THEIR EDGE SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THEY HAVE CUT. USE EXTREME CAUTION IF YOU PLAN ON HEADING OUT THERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. ICE LOOKS TO BE ABOUT 3 INCHES THICK FROM WHAT I COULD SEE FROM SHORE.
