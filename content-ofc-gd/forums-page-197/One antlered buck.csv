891659,lew,2015-01-11 21:07:00,12766,"Not a good picture as he's quite aways away, but I just had this nice one antlered buck in the backyard.  Get lots of does around here but bucks are pretty rare so it's always good when they stop by to say hi.  "
891661,misfish,2015-01-11 21:10:00,29133,"Get the mash taters and gravy ready Lew. LOL  Cool shot bud. He,ll show up next week looking like a doe ."
891662,akaShag,2015-01-11 21:11:00,2073,"He'll shed that other antler very soon, in all likelihood.  Bucks generally shed both antlers within a short time.  He looks healthy enough, but not fat by any means.  Doug"
891664,lew,2015-01-11 21:17:00,12766,There were 9 does in the yard earlier today so I spose this ole boy is leader of their pack.
891666,akaShag,2015-01-11 21:23:00,2073,"Actually, I had a deer specialist tell me that whitetails are matriarchal, as in the oldest doe runs things.  Most of the year the does and that year's fawns travel and live together.  Yearling bucks and older bucks typically form ""bachelor groups"" and often by age.  So your buck might be the leader of the pack, or maybe he is just cruising along with grandma picking up wisdom............  That guy was Ontario's MNR Deer Expert, probably twenty years or so ago.  Who knows if the science since then has changed!  Doug"
891667,lew,2015-01-11 21:32:00,12766,"Interesting Doug and it could very well be true.  I always thought a buck looked after a group of females and younguns, but who knows ??"
891668,misfish,2015-01-11 21:36:00,29133,Bucks are like sailors  returning after a 11 month tour Lew. Want some got to get some.

891674,akaShag,2015-01-11 21:51:00,2073,"I've been chasing whitetails for over forty years and my own observations mirror that of the ""expert.""  In early fall, I cannot recall ever seeing a group of does and fawns with an antlered buck amongst them.  But I have seen groups of antlered bucks together in that same time frame.  Typically I see does and fawns together right up until the rut, then generally I see single animals, or a doe being chased, or a buck tracking hot does.  So I cannot recall seeing a ""harem"" of an antlered buck with does and fawns.  As I understand elk biology, the biggest baddest bulls do get a harem and defend it against all comers; I do not think this is true of whitetails.  Maybe a biologist with current experience will see this and weigh in...........  Doug"
891680,lew,2015-01-11 22:22:00,12766,"So I cannot recall seeing a ""harem"" of an antlered buck with does and fawns.  My property backs onto woods that are loaded with deer in the winter, but as I said above bucks aren't too common although they do show up once in awhile. Here's a picture of another one antlered buck from last winter with a few ladies around him although I don't know if it's his ""harem"" or not.    Here's another one in my yard, but this guy looks like he's laying down the law to anyone who'll listen to him.  "
891681,akaShag,2015-01-11 22:27:00,2073,"That last buck looks like he is using his nose.  I think of al their senses, it is smell that is most acute, and which the deer trust most of all.  They catch your scent, they are out of there.  So.....................would you mind terribly if I set up a ground blind at your house late next fall?  Doug"
891682,lew,2015-01-11 22:33:00,12766,"  So.....................would you mind terribly if I set up a ground blind at your house late next fall  Your more than welcome Doug, so long as your only shooting with a camera"
891685,ch312,2015-01-11 22:43:00,1590,"Whitetails don't have a harem or pack led by a buck and for the majority of the year the two sexes will remain in separate groups. You'll typically only see bucks with does during the rut when they're hanging around does waiting for them to be ready to ""accept"" him and the other time is when they're in their winter yards, such is the case here.  The deer in your yard are being led by a doe, not that buck."
891688,lew,2015-01-11 22:56:00,12766,"  The deer in your yard are being led by a doe, not that buck.  I don't doubt it, some of these does are HUGE compared to the young bucks LOL"
891766,Sinker,2015-01-12 04:50:00,8692,"Take a close look at the does Lew, they could be bucks that have shed their antlers already. I bet if you went snooping back there you'd find his antlers too.  Pretty cool to have that in your back yard!  S."
891772,wormdunker,2015-01-12 06:35:00,1711,"I'm not an expert about who's leading who in the zoo!  But, I will say those pix are awesome!"
