It's a 3 day competition between 3 teams.  I can't believe the size of the perch they catch over there.  A 19"" perch, that's crazy to think.  Check it out."

890884,Locnar,2015-01-07 18:30:00,645,European perch are generally much bigger than our Yellow Perch. I think the record for European Perch is like 6 and a half pounds or something.
890894,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-07 20:01:00,8243,"Interesting and certainly different that's for sure and funny in spots. I like the ""here's Sven taking a piss"". I can't figure how they can get a weight if they don't weigh some of those minnows. Some of those fish are monsters. I wonder if they are as sweet as ours here in Ontario? I imagine Swedish fishing shows don't have censorship for language. Their command of English is superb for ""F"" bomb sakes. The counter clicker is a good idea.  Big Dave a perch charter guy at Long Point uses one I'm told. He will bring in 300 good sized perch in a day, a good idea to know how many when keeping that many. I sure don't need one most days that's for sure."
890909,bigugli,2015-01-07 21:37:00,6138,"Yes they are as tasty as our perch.  My family loved the muskokas because it was so much like home. Right down to the fish. According to the old timers, our varieties of pike, perch and walleye are just a little smaller, that's all"
890996,captpierre,2015-01-08 02:04:00,2521,Would be cool to introduce that variety of perch here. Too risky to introduce disease here I guess
