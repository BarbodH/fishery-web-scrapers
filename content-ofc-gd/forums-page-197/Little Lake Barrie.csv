A guy from the park was running around taking measurement of the ice, preparing to drag huts out.  He was going to hold off a few days based on his measurements at that time.  There must be a few more inches now, if he's dragging huts out already.  Just a guess though.  Guys running snowmobiles all over the lake last weekend."
