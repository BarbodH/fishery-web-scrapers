When I lived in French River (some 35 or so years ago) we'd walk out on the front porch and let go with a couple of blasts with the 12 ga. at midnight. On a clear cold night you'd hear them going off for miles around. If I tried that where I live now I'd have the cops returning fire LOL. (No disrespect meant to our boys in blue, I wouldn't want to have to put up with what they do today for all the money in the world)"

We used to do the Dinner Dance thing but I say if I want to celebrate with a few hundred strangers and pay to do it I'll just invite my family over. My wife volunteered to work and close the store so she got home at 10:30 and I fed her Brodetto on Polenta. We were invited to come by the neighbors from Toronto as we are every year, we are the old folks here now. To my surprise she said lets visit the neighbors. We had a blast with the 30 something DINKS. We stayed to 3 AM. The best part was the 3 minute walk home, no waiting for a cab and no designated driver.  Happy New Years to all."

MC was Tom Green who was a little crude and so were a couple comedians in the first set.  I still can't understand why comedians think vulgarity is funny.  Anyway, highlight of the night was from the second most famous celebrity to come out of Timmins, ON, Derek Edwards.  Not vulgar, or a lot of swearing, just his recollection of life experiences that he tells and the whole place was roaring."

My wife & I spent New Years at home watching TV (especially the Canadian juniors beating USA -Woo Hoo!).  Later in the evening she prepared 2 - 8oz lobster tails, shrimp with cocktail sauce while roasting a frenched rack of lamb!!  I drank a couple beers while watching the hockey game, 1 glass of wine during dinner (which was awesome!).  After dinner we watched the festivities at Times Square in New York.  Went to bed at 10:00! Happy New Year everyone!"

A glass of very nice wine.  About 7:30 I turned the clock ahead about 4 hours. We watched some tv and suddenly it was midnight; I kissed her and wished her a Happy New Year. Told her she could set the clock back now and I went to bed (might have even beat Lew LOL). (she always likes to stay up to see the ball drop then crawls into bed, give me a kiss, cuddles up and); well that's what dreams are made of!  Today is when I do my celebrating; just finished making a nice Swiss cheese sauce and crape batter, shaved a nice piece of ham, cooked up some asparagas. Friends are coming over around 10:30 so I'll be making ham and asparagas crapes with Swiss cheese sauce for brunch.  Wishing each and every one of you all the very best for 2015!"
