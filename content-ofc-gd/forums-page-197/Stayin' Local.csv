I won't lie, I didn't have my hopes too high as I knew it would be packed with people and very few fish would be around. We came up with a backup plan to hit a walleye and pike lake in the area if the first spot disappointed but upon looking at the fish finder screen, that all changed.                                                                                                                                                                                 Fish were literally everywhere and they were chasing but not hitting, so we decided to go ahead and set up the hut while its slow. Of course just as we start setting up the hut, my rod falls and there is an unmistakeable head shake of a laker, sadly I lost that fish as my reel was frozen and it snapped my 4 lb test right off. It was ok though, I re-tied and dropped down again, instant hit and the first laker is on the ice, just a little guy, so well put him back down. The 2nd fish was a bit better so I decided to keep it, I did not want any huge ones anyways as I prefer small ones for the table. After getting countless hit and even a few lakers landed here and there, the fish decided it was go time. As I started jigging up, I get a strong hit and my drag goes nuts, I think, its just a small one again probably just healthy, well nope! As soon as I got him near the hole, I decided I would lift him, that idea quickly disappeared after I saw the size of him. I ran to the hole to grab him and the bugger got lucky and feel off the hook and went down the hole . It was ok though, since fish were still hitting.                                                               Finally we got the hut set up and got inside to warm up and stare at a blank screen! However.....in a half hours time, I see a mark on the screen, its on bottom and I instantly think its a whitie, I look at my tip up and its going nuts, I set the hook and miss a nice whitie, no worries the 2nd rod saves the day, thank god it was an ul and it let me see the tiny hit. I set the hook and this time its on, after a few minutes battle, I'm thinking its a laker due to the strong runs but no, its a whitie, hooray we got a whitie on the ice! Wait a second, oh man, that was probably a bad idea, yes, yes it was, within 20 minutes all of Toronto was around us trying to catch one too. We decided to leave, since we had our laker limits and go try for some herring. It was dead at the herring spot, so moving around and getting out of the comfort of a hut was required but in the end, I found the fish and we got ourselves some herring, not as big as i'd hoped for but still herring and even a smelt and a couple perch as well! All in all it was a good day spent on the waters even though it wasn't my first choice for a whitefish spot, I still managed some fish and of course whats a report without some pics.......[/url[/url[/url[/url"

891798,SirCranksalot,2015-01-12 14:35:00,3291,"Well done! That tip-up is a bit 'retro', don't you think?   . How did the other guy(s) do, or were you fishing alone?"
891814,xxgoaler,2015-01-12 16:59:00,106,"Nice day on the ice , well done"
891840,jimmer,2015-01-12 20:46:00,2730,That tip up is the best for whities. Wouldn't go for them without one in my box.
891845,BowSlayer101,2015-01-12 21:03:00,296,"Thanks guys, first time using a tip up, I was told its the best for whities, I go out and get one and catch a whitie on a jigging rod lol. Knuguy: one other guy was with me and got a little laker and a little herring, I was the only one with a whitie and everyone I looked to didn't have any one the ice either, slow day."
