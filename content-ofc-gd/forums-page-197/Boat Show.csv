891521,captpierre,2015-01-10 22:31:00,2521,Our 84 cent dollar is a big factor down there.  Boats and motors are likely up this year  Did you notice ?
891531,mattaw,2015-01-10 23:08:00,162,"I was also at the show, lots of good deals if you're looking to buy new. There are the usual good deals on PFDs and the like as well. I will say the show seemed quieter than last year for the first day. There were a decent number of people, it just wasn't nearly as busy and from talking to a few friends that work the show, they seemed to agree. It will be interesting to see how the show shapes up in terms of sales and purchasing"
