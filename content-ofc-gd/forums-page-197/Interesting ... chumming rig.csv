890171,Fisherman,2015-01-04 15:45:00,7201,You fill it with a couple of minnows?
890173,MSBruno,2015-01-04 15:47:00,369,You fill it with a couple of minnows? Anything really
890175,Terry,2015-01-04 15:49:00,14456,"I guess meat hunters might like it  but I like equipment sized for the fish I am fighting, I like setting the hook and fighting them in  that would be just to get meat IMHO"
890176,wkrp,2015-01-04 15:55:00,656,Looks like a christmas tree ornament.
890180,misfish,2015-01-04 16:33:00,29133,"I guess meat hunters might like it  but I like equipment sized for the fish I am fighting, I like setting the hook and fighting them in  that would be just to get meat IMHO   And you did a fine job this morning bringing up those piggies."
890183,Steve,2015-01-04 16:48:00,2075,"i'm assuming this is a ""Crazy Carp Contraption""?  They generally have the craziest ways of catching fish....."
890198,mike rousseau,2015-01-04 17:50:00,4661,Carp rig designs from Asia are similar...  Looks like a Japanese rig with a method feeder mixed in...
890199,Steve,2015-01-04 17:53:00,2075,figured it was a crazy carping device.
890200,mike rousseau,2015-01-04 17:56:00,4661,You'd fill it with crumbs for fish like carp and perch to peck at
890202,bigugli,2015-01-04 18:21:00,6138,Just figured it was a redneck variation on the Alabama rig.
890223,John Bacon,2015-01-04 20:16:00,3277,Just figured it was a redneck variation on the Alabama rig.  Isn't that kind of like saying a Canadian variation of maple syrup?
890250,bigugli,2015-01-04 21:41:00,6138,  We have our share of rednecks here in Canader ya know. Some of the fellas I grew up with make Gomer and Goober look sophisiticated.
890251,Ice Fishing Ham,2015-01-04 21:41:00,83,Is it used for chumming or for snagging?
890746,highdrifter,2015-01-06 21:47:00,2534,Looks like a 15th century torture device!!
890747,BillM,2015-01-06 21:48:00,17367,I'm going to gank 4 whitefish at a time with that.

890767,solopaddler,2015-01-06 22:49:00,8605,Looks like an interesting rig.
890768,Terry,2015-01-06 22:58:00,14456, This is good bait for fishing! Это хорошо приманка для рыбалки!
890843,BillM,2015-01-07 13:13:00,17367," I'm laughing for probably all the wrong reasons, lol!!!!!!"
890844,dave524,2015-01-07 13:24:00,4508,"Seems it is a Sabiki bait catching rig, fill it with bread or some kind of bait , the bait fish go for the bait and the occasional rip by the angler impales/snags  the baitfish.  edit: Seems there are some rigs where the hook is a fly and indeed they actaully take the hook."
890846,Terry,2015-01-07 13:48:00,14456,I just did the translation. Someone else posted it. Before editing thier post
890873,Hooked,2015-01-07 17:28:00,891,Looks like a rig someone would use for ocean fishing to catch bait.  Cool rig and can see it working really well.
891329,johnnyb,2015-01-09 17:34:00,3413,Looms like one of those tea infusers....hmmmm....homemade chum can ideas....
