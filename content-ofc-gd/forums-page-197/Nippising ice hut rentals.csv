Even a day hut rental would be fine! Any comments would be greatly appreciated.    Thanks."
889140,bow slayer,2014-12-29 18:38:00,1074,"you may have luck finding a day hut,try Reeds,Grump and grumpys  or winter walleye they all have day huts"
889146,Fisherman,2014-12-29 18:52:00,7201,Idle Tyme and Bear Creek are two of the best.
889197,TJC1973,2014-12-29 22:36:00,17,"Thanks Bowslayer, booked with the grumps for Saturday. Much appreciated!"
889251,bow slayer,2014-12-30 01:49:00,1074,"new owners now last owners were great guys,i have heard good things about new owners also."
889265,Joeytier,2014-12-30 03:23:00,3990,Lots and lots of great operators on the lake.  The waltonian inn only uses day huts (no bungalows) and usually has a few openings
889268,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-30 04:03:00,8243,We haven't been to Bear Creek since the Donovan's sold. If it's half as good as when they owned the place is still would be great. Good luck. Let us all know how you make out.
890332,TJC1973,2015-01-05 01:44:00,17,"Had a great trip to Nippising this weekend. Taking Bowslayers advice I booked with Reeds outdoors right in North bay for a day hut rental for Saturday. Between my brother in law and I we caught about 30 pickeral (all below the slot), one ling and about 20 perch, 15 of which came home for a dinner. Those are the high lites.  The real challenge was the drive home last night from North bay, I don't think we saw blacktop until south of Barrie, real white knuckle driving the whole way.   Cheers"
890340,Joeytier,2015-01-05 02:06:00,3990,Good stuff!  Heard nothing but great reports from opening weekend all over the lake.  Can't wait to get down there this weekend
890373,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-05 05:51:00,8243,"I might need to dig out my long Johns this year and hit Nipissing this year. Glad you made it home safe and sound. I hate that drive after fishing all day, well worth the night at a motel and hit the road bright eyed and bushy tailed in the AM."

890826,wormdunker,2015-01-07 09:35:00,1711,Hey Nipfisher - Do you still have your hut at the same location?  I wanna  get up there again.  I love perchin'!

Perching is good.  Thats what we noticed as well, same as the guts around us. Does the bite fade as the season wears on? I would love to I get back up in a few weeks."
