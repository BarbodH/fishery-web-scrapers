891751,scottdg,2015-01-12 02:33:00,1,My family and I are considering camping near Niagara this summer. I would like to do some fishing and would consider bringing my small boat of there are smaller bodies of water that have decent fishing. My boat is a 14t jon boat and only has a 50 lb thrust electric motor. Thanks in advance.

891769,bigugli,2015-01-12 05:20:00,6138,"Binbrook is day use only. The only other Conservation campground is Byng, on the Grand. There are a couple of private campgrounds along the lower Welland R. Don't recall the exact names. One is tied to Marineland, King Waldo?... The other is one of those Yogi Bear parks. There are other campgrounds in the Niagara area. Many without any water access. Erie shore campgrounds would not be suited to your boat set up."

891773,Freshtrax,2015-01-12 06:39:00,2215,Camp on the island in dunnville  or Chippewa creek.   Both almost guarantee a few bent rods.
891800,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-12 14:47:00,8243,"Fishmasters Marina in Dunnville on the Grand has a few campsites. Rock Point is very nice but I think you will need to trailer the boat to the river, it is on Erie and no way you want to take that boat on that water. In my opinion fishing below the Dunnville dam is far better than above."
