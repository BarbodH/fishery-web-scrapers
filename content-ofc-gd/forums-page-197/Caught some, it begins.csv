891494,misfish,2015-01-10 21:03:00,29133,"Short report.  Windy as all heck.  Snapped a poll setting up  Get anchored  over 55 fow.  Lots of swimming going on down there.  First two fish herring. Limit out.  Next 15 fish after that, herring   Next fish small laker. DINNER  Next fish, a perch. Snack waiting for dinner.  All fish caught on Williams spoon.  Fix broken pole,  Quick and short  Oh and my new Milwacky 18 volt fuel cordless drill.    OMG. What a machine. It cut 8"" holes like I was using a 4"". And my new adapter I made is sweet as well. (Thanks to Kevin for putting me on to this drill)    "
891495,Terry,2015-01-10 21:06:00,14456,and I did not catch a thing on my williams...hmmmmm  but caught about 30 herring on really small jigs and most of them hit while I was reeling the jig away from them just like trout would chase
891498,davey buoy,2015-01-10 21:07:00,5505,"Nice,not even tipped with a minnow?.How thick was the ice?"
891499,misfish,2015-01-10 21:10:00,29133,"5""-6""  tick bye."
891500,Acountdeleted,2015-01-10 21:16:00,2562,Beauty. Great to see more ice reports getting posted.
891503,Pikeslayer,2015-01-10 21:23:00,1443,"Brian, Did you snap a fishing pole or carbon pole for your hut. I have a great fix for the hut poles."
891504,Fisherpete,2015-01-10 21:25:00,1814,Nice B!
891517,chris.brock,2015-01-10 22:01:00,4053,"sounds like a solid, successful outing for sure  Milwaukee is good stuff"
891526,misfish,2015-01-10 22:47:00,29133,"Brian, Did you snap a fishing pole or carbon pole for your hut. I have a great fix for the hut poles.  Duct tape and flex hose is my friend Simon. If the buggers didnt glue the one end in, I could of replaced it with a fiberglass rod.  It broke Im sure my last outing. I broke it down the wrong way. I will send Eskimo an email and see if I can get a replacement.  I will be honest with them. No sense Bull craping them."
891528,Nipfisher,2015-01-10 22:57:00,2449,Those Herring look like minnows compared to ours here.
891530,Terry,2015-01-10 23:08:00,14456,hey our huts made the news
891533,misfish,2015-01-10 23:11:00,29133,There goes that hot spot. LOL
891534,misfish,2015-01-10 23:13:00,29133,"Those Herring look like minnows compared to ours here.   LOL Blair  I,ll bet one that I released was pushing 2.5 lb.  Oh and ours dont have worms."
891536,Nipfisher,2015-01-10 23:18:00,2449,Our Herring aren't too bad....it's our perch that have the worms.
891538,irishfield,2015-01-10 23:41:00,26272,Great outing guys... wish I could have joined you!
891544,Rod Caster,2015-01-11 00:16:00,5784,"Those herring are super skinny compared to the Nip ones! They actually look like they'd be less fatty.  Here's Nick with a couple tall-back Nip ciscoes.  And Blair, Brian is correct, they are full of big nasty worms from Nipissing! Gross stuff."
891550,Motojoe,2015-01-11 00:32:00,21,Nice catch! I should go there today.
891562,Christopheraaron,2015-01-11 01:04:00,3525,"Those herring are super skinny compared to the Nip ones! They actually look like they'd be less fatty.

891577,Gallie,2015-01-11 02:53:00,1215,Nice work man!
891614,NAW,2015-01-11 15:23:00,4022,"Yup.  Both of those herring where just rammed with worms.  The most I have ever seen in my life.  Hey, good job Brian!!  I made it out yesterday. Also snapped a rod!!  And you are correct about the wind.  It was nasty!  I had to pry these poor perches jaws open for my usual elbow lock pose!!! (Figured I'd ad another pic seeing as I have somehow hijacked this post with out knowing! Hahaa)  "
891621,moxie,2015-01-11 16:19:00,1566,Way to go Brian

891643,Fisherman,2015-01-11 18:31:00,7201,"Brian, is that stainless holy metal?   Where do you get that stuff?"
891644,misfish,2015-01-11 18:36:00,29133,"Brian, is that stainless holy metal?   Where do you get that stuff?   Cut offs from a shaker table at work."
