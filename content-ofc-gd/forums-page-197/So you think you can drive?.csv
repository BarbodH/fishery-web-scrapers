890975,kickingfrog,2015-01-08 00:46:00,8333,Those are not all-seasons.
890984,Steelheadphycho,2015-01-08 01:12:00,470,That's awesome!  Heated grips?  Thanks for sharing!
891107,Gerry,2015-01-08 16:22:00,257,That's why I always liked rear wheel drive. Half of the steering was done applying power to the rear wheels. Love it. Try that with a front wheel drive.....you wouldn't get around the first bend.
891121,Terry,2015-01-08 17:12:00,14456,I think I was driving much the same yesterday
891164,irishfield,2015-01-08 21:27:00,26272,I hear you Terry... many times I was doing the powered 4 wheel drift last night coming home from the city! Only works with traction control OFF !
891188,Raf,2015-01-08 22:44:00,3495,Cool vid guy has skills for sure. Thats a tough track on dry pavement.  Nordschleiffe hasnt hosted a f1 race since the 70s i believe. Too dangerous.  It is where Niki Lauda crashed and burned.  Would love to drive it one day.  Here's another crazy video if you like to steer with the throttle
