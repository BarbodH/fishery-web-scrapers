891345,johnnyb,2015-01-09 19:24:00,3413,Fantastic! Live or dead bait?
891706,Fisherpete,2015-01-11 23:29:00,1814,"Dead bait.  Got out for a few hours again today, wifey and kiddo came along for the ride... hooked 5 but only landed 2. Lost a really good one.        "
890948,Fisherpete,2015-01-07 23:16:00,1814,"I have a new addiction... catching pike thru the ice! My first time out and I land my biggest pike from southern Ontario @ 37""! My buddy Scott landed a 37"" as well... Andrew got a 33"" as his biggest of the day. Smallest fish of the bunch was still 29""! I'll keep this report short and sweet, enjoy the pics              "
890950,AdamS,2015-01-07 23:29:00,161,Nice fish Pete! I always wanted to catch a pike through the ice...Looks like I'm gonna have to make a trip up your way.
890952,Fisherpete,2015-01-07 23:33:00,1814,"Thanks Adam, they were my first pike thru the ice as well... I've had a few big ones on while perch fishing in Cooks Bay but you can guess how that turned out... zzzzzzPING!  I had always pictured using tip-ups to be boring... I was wrong! It's great fun watching the flags pop and then battling these brutes by hand.  Pete"
890956,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-07 23:40:00,10439,It's even better jigging them up using airplane jigs or giant Lindy darters. Watching them come in on the flasher is awesome!!!
890957,Burtess,2015-01-07 23:44:00,901,Great pics!!  Pike through the ice are just so awesome..... they can be such beasts and really make fantastic picture material!  I hope to get some up on Nipissing next week when I go.  Going to find some 5-6 foot shallow water near an island and set down a big mackerel.....  Burt
890958,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-07 23:51:00,10439,I'm heading out to my local pike spot on Sunday & hopefully stick a few of these.    
890960,davey buoy,2015-01-07 23:55:00,5505,"Nice fish guys,would love to get a couple like that through the ice as well.Yours aren't bad either Dave  ."
890963,xxgoaler,2015-01-08 00:06:00,106,"It's a Gator parade, well done , nice pics"
890968,Pikeslayer,2015-01-08 00:27:00,1443,I think we're overdue for another date Pete ?
890970,NAW,2015-01-08 00:35:00,4022,I don't get envious all that often.   I am right now though!!!
890974,ccmtcanada,2015-01-08 00:39:00,7971,You are an esox magnet Pete!!
890981,Fisherpete,2015-01-08 01:05:00,1814,"Wow, I think I need a trip up to the NWT! (And an auger extension)"
890985,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-08 01:16:00,10439,"Wow, I think I need a trip up to the NWT! (And an auger extension)  Or two!!!"
890990,sleepjigging,2015-01-08 01:29:00,207,"I think I need to upgrade my 6"" auger to 10"". Well done gentlemen."
890991,manitoubass2,2015-01-08 01:33:00,11391,wicked nice gators!  I prefer to jig em up though.  One thing is for certain they show up like a missile on the graph!!!
890993,Steve Piggott,2015-01-08 01:43:00,196,"Nice fish Pete, for your first time at it."
890998,Joeytier,2015-01-08 02:13:00,3990,"Pike are definitely most fun in the winter, and tastiest too!  Nice job"
891002,Gallie,2015-01-08 03:04:00,1215,Beautiful fish! Im itching to get a few myself.
891092,Acountdeleted,2015-01-08 15:18:00,2562,Geez. Way to go Pete and Co. Those are some massive gators. I can only imagine the fight they must have put up.
891095,AKRISONER,2015-01-08 15:32:00,5558,"Pete,  The pictures are even better on a big screen! Your phone didnt do these gators justice.  I am heading up to Pointe Au Baril tomorrow to try chase some as well. Weve got the sardines just as you suggested!"
891103,Gregoire,2015-01-08 16:08:00,1397,Seems like a good way to kill time until June.
891168,highdrifter,2015-01-08 21:39:00,2534,Right on mane!!
891207,FishAbout,2015-01-09 00:35:00,106,Nice looking pike.
891208,Nipfisher,2015-01-09 01:08:00,2449,"I used to get a few big ones every year out of Lake Nipissing through the ice. Lots of 30-35"" over the years. Then back to back years we landed 43"" beauties."
891343,fishnsled,2015-01-09 19:07:00,3520,Not sure how I missed this but awesome report!!  Some really nice gators there!!
