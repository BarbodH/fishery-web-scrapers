While I'm at it high jacking threads, someone I know who's name will remain anonyms , was trying t be a good husband and cleaned his LCD screen with Windex. The result was a mess of vertical coloured lines in the center of the TV. It is now only 1 red line down the center. His wife is not very happy. They just bought this16 months ago. I think it's done, finished, gonezo. Is there a fix?  No it wasn't me. I even I know not to use Windex."

It should be used as a training tool for some of the pimply face pencil necked geeks that try to impress you at the big box stores with all sorts of techy terminology, obtuse numbers and acronyms.

By the time I'm entering any place I'm leaving my green all I need to know from the sales person is, well actually nothing. It can be frightening eaves dropping in on sales persons pitches when he or she is does not have a clue what they are talking about giving a dog and pony show. It can be disturbing. I have been known to take the buyer to the side and give them my opinion. The thing is I am thanked more times than I'm told to bugger off. Actually have never been told to take a hike. I may not know the difference between 1080P and 4K but  do know the difference between thin set and mastic."

My dad was in the TV biz and we got a lot of toys early now my son reaps the benefits of this obsession that's in my blood... Im embarrassed to list the electronics this kid has. Anyway, as the TV repair man's son. Here's what I recommend. Always buy the middle of the road! It was yesterdays top of the line set, they've worked the bugs out if there was any, and your brand new fancy TV will be the middle one sooner than you think. We've always done that and its worked for us every time! Unless money is no object then buy the best because why not?"

889931,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-03 00:00:00,8243,"A great choice. I hope you don't have a glare issue. Ours does but it is 7 years old and those plasmas back then they recommended a dark environment. I don't know if it applies today.  Shloim mentioned his father was a TV Repairman, another profession gone the way of the Dodo bird.

889448,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-31 14:31:00,4399,It`s all somewhat confusion....from what I understand the answer is yes but you have to be a certain distance from the set and the further you get away from the set the definition drops....I am more curious about the upscaling capabilities of the Tv`s.  As Bill mention the upscaling that I have seen before is terrible just wondering if the new technology has improved if not just may stick with Plasma as they have a superior picture to anything else!  And I am guessing that if you are streaming UHD content you would a fast internet connection and a whole lot of bandwidth!!!

Curve is a gimmick IMO, the curve edges catch the light during Day time and cause glare, maybe in a completely dark room it works good , not for me. I ended up buying an 800 series 1080p HD LED Samsung, very happy with it."

I would always choose plasma only if it is in a room dark enough because glare is a huge issue on our Plasma. Every make has it's good points and not so good.  I can see the difference between HD and 4K, but only in the showroom when they are showing a video on Blue Ray. I asked a sales guy at Best Buy to get a HD broadcast channel up so I can see it in 4K, of course he couldn't because they don't want you to compare, meanwhile all the HD only sets have been set up. Dubious little buggers.  My best HD picture comes up when I use my wifes glasses, time to get some for me too."
