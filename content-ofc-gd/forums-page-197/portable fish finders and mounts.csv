891616,bigcreekdad,2015-01-11 15:32:00,546,"I figure never too soon to start planning. We are heading to Pickle Lake in June via White River Air. I'm looking for a fish finder and a portable mount to use on the 14' boats that are at the outpost cabin. I saw one mount on You Tube that attached magnetically to the outside of the boat, but could not seem to locate a website.  In any case, what suggestions do any of you folks have?  Thanks in advance."
891618,Terry,2015-01-11 15:47:00,14456,"most boats are aluminum or fiberglass a magnet will do nothing  you can buy one with a suction cup , it works well  a transducer on a cut hockey stick and a clamp  works well too"
891619,Joeytier,2015-01-11 15:56:00,3990,"I prefer the suction cup, but the hockey stick will also work fine.  Super easy"
891622,porkpie,2015-01-11 16:26:00,2521,"Just get the suction cup mount and remember to tie it off.  They occasionally pop off of the boat, but not so often that it's a major hassle.  I've used one for years on the boat at our cottage.  I just pop the sonar from my boat into a porta pack, and I bought a spare transducer to use with the suction cup mount!"
