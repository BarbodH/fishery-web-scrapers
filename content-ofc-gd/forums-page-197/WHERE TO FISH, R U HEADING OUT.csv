891272,misfish,2015-01-09 12:02:00,29133,"One minute were looking for ice to fish on, now we got a lot of choices. It was so much easier when there were only one or two places. At least I knew where I was going. Guess I better get the dart board map out. Where it lands is where Im going I guess.  Staying away from the south end that's for sure. It will be a zoo.  Play safe out there all. Looking forward to more hard water reports now.  Winternet might be over for some of us.  "

891332,Acountdeleted,2015-01-09 17:47:00,2562,Have to wait a while longer for my Lake Trout spot so I'll be looking for a new lake for that. I really want to target burbot this year and find some decent pike.
891335,Terry,2015-01-09 17:52:00,14456,simcoe  somewhere  no sure where  but it will be  simcoe
891347,NAW,2015-01-09 19:37:00,4022,"Ya.  I think I may chase some Simcoe candy on Sunday as well.  Likely try to find 25 to 30 FOW.  And depending on the ice conditions, maybe a whitie.  But I think that's wishful thinking."
891348,Christopheraaron,2015-01-09 19:56:00,3525,"If anyone wants to meet up for some perch action on Simcoe let me know, preferably south of Barrie where there's a little less snow..."

There is very little snow where I just came from. The winds are keeping it off pretty much.  The decision has been made where Im going. There should be lakers,whities and herring and maybe some jumbos.."
891436,Fish Farmer,2015-01-10 14:23:00,2234,St. Williams Monday or Tuesday. Got to stay away from those weekends.
891519,chris.brock,2015-01-10 22:15:00,4053,"I was hoping to get my permanent hut out on my home lake, but when I axed a hole I discovered that under the foot of dry powder snow was only 5 inches of ice (not enough for me, the hut and the snowmobile), any time spent up in Haliburton is a good time IMO though"
891558,Gallie,2015-01-11 00:57:00,1215,"I was surprised at the lack of people on lady simcoe today, but it was cold early and windy so im sure the zoo will arrive by next weekend"
