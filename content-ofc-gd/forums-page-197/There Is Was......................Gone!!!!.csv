891705,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-11 23:29:00,10439,Went out and did a wee bit O fishin' at the old lake today. All was going well until a giant gator ripped my dead stick out of the rod holder where it flew through the air with the greatest of ease and down the hole it went.  Guess I have to build another.  Here's a couple of pics from the day.  My little setup    The big one of the day that didn't pilfer my expensive gear!!!!  
891708,Fisherpete,2015-01-11 23:31:00,1814,Beauty Dave!  Love the beardsicles too!!!
891711,solopaddler,2015-01-11 23:42:00,8605,Well if you had to lose a reel I guess that's as good a way as any.
891712,davey buoy,2015-01-11 23:46:00,5505,"Nice Dave,looks like your fishing at the edge of the shore?,must be one heck of a drop off there."
891713,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-11 23:49:00,10439,"Davey, it's a mid lake island. The depth where I am is 12'-15'."
891715,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-11 23:54:00,10439,Well if you had to lose a reel I guess that's as good a way as any.  Luckily it was not my 6001 it was a 5501 which I have a couple of. Would have liked to see the fish though as the line was peeling off the reel like it was hooked to the back of an 18 wheeler!!!
891745,Gallie,2015-01-12 01:44:00,1215,Those gators are sneaky eh? I too would like to see that fish! At least you still got something
891752,chris.brock,2015-01-12 02:50:00,4053,"It's a good fish story regardless, and nice pike in the picture.  What was the temperature and how much ice up there?"

Ice thickness was 30""-36"". We're low on snow this year. The sled trails are not good with pieces of granite sticking out all over the place. Snow on the lake was less than a foot."
891765,Sinker,2015-01-12 04:46:00,8692,Donchya hate when that happens? I lost two set ups in one day once!! Down the same hole to boot! Lol  Nice gator!  S.

891771,wormdunker,2015-01-12 06:29:00,1711,Too bad about the reel.  Nice pike.  Beautiful scenery.
