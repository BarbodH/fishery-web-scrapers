891629,Raycaster,2015-01-11 17:50:00,528,"The old Navionics Canada Lakes was able to go ""live"" mapping right away as soon as turned on WITHOUT DATA. All maps were preloaded and as long as your lake was purchased you were set. This was perfect for me with my older android phone without data.  The new Navionic Boating HD although originally free requires you to purchased your maps within. This is fine although most users were stuck purchasing the same maps twice to upgrade...  I was shocked the first time I went to use it with my Samsung 10"" tablet. It worked perfect weeks before the fishing trip but when I turned it on in the boat the maps had no detail! It drove me crazy turning the different options SONAR etc. but still was left with no detail.  When I got back to the motel and had wifi access the detail worked right away! This kinda sucks as the maps are preloaded with all detail but the app now seems to require a 5 second data login for activation every time. I now have to remember to turn the app on before heading out on the lake because I don't have a data plan. This is probably a piracy deterrent that doesn't stop piracy but hurts legit paying customers.  The one problem I have with my tablet is that it's battery is old and doesn't last long. I installed a USB connector just for it but the connector only provides a small trickle charge 1 amp probably. It will actually die plugge in charging. I need to look for a 2.1A USB connector for this year."

891722,manitoubass2,2015-01-12 01:01:00,11391,haha thats funny!  but hes trying so cant dig on him.
891114,bassjnkie,2015-01-08 16:31:00,1101,Does anyone have the Navionics app for android.. Is it worth it? Is it also good for the shore angler? Any reviews would be appreciated...
891118,hookerdown,2015-01-08 16:47:00,110,"I use it mostly for ice fishing on simcoe.  Its not that bad.  One big negative is that it really drains your battery.  So if you are using it on the ice, get to your spot and quit the app."
891127,fisherman7,2015-01-08 17:53:00,325,I have it and love it! Better accuracy than my Lowerance GPS
891128,buick14,2015-01-08 17:55:00,741,its just meh for anything other than ice fishing IMO.
891130,bare foot wader,2015-01-08 18:09:00,1354,"crappy deal is I'm not aware of any phones where you can turn off cell reception and keep GPS enabled, so as mentioned it's hard on your battery, I use it mostly for getting to my spots/looking for a new area and then airplane mode  you need to download the lake maps while you have reception (maybe not an issue depending on where you fish)  I think it's handy for any angler with a smart phone  on open water it doesn't track low speed for me,<2, but wouldn't use the app for that anyways"
891148,mattaw,2015-01-08 20:25:00,162,"It's not bad if I want to use it to prescout while someone else is driving the car to the lake  Otherwise, once I'm on the water, I really prefer the actual chips. Ice fishing I could see it being useful. As others have said, it really drains your battery"
891151,manitoubass2,2015-01-08 20:40:00,11391,"only use it to plan trips on softwater or hardwater.  Then on hardwater to pinpoint a spot then its turned off.  Good app, it does what I want it to do.  I can also take points and transfer them to other units if needed.  I wouldn't worry about your battery. Nobody on earth is gonna leave the app running while they fish."
891162,porkpie,2015-01-08 21:14:00,2521,"It's definately worth it for an ice fisherman.  I use it whenever I'm walking out.  I have a sonar with navionics chip mounted on the front of my quad for when driving out, but when on foot the phone is very handy to refer too!  I have a GPS capable sonar in my boat, so I haven't really used it much for that!  It does work well, and I think the cost is pretty reasonable."
891163,Freshtrax,2015-01-08 21:27:00,2215,"I like it for trolling,  as it keeps my tacks on file.   I am considering getting the sonar phone transducer  from vexilar to go with my navionics on ipad"
891175,manitoubass2,2015-01-08 22:11:00,11391,"""strand ulcer""?  Scary, is that the new H1N1?"
891180,Motojoe,2015-01-08 22:18:00,21,"I use it on boat and on ice since it came out, it helps me get back to my spot all the time."
891192,Freshtrax,2015-01-08 22:50:00,2215, Lol transducer
891219,Raycaster,2015-01-09 02:08:00,528,"Don't think the android version is available yet got the Vexllar add-on, just ipad.  I use Navionics on a big 10"" tablet and its pretty nice as no data is needed with the maps preloaded. This used to be perfect but the latest version requires data for verification when you first turn it on I believe.  Was thinking of the vexilar option also but no Android support yet and the transducer seem pretty basic compared to new side sonar etc..."
891225,Freshtrax,2015-01-09 02:35:00,2215,I have  data on my ipad I was looking at getting the transducer because it's only 175 bucks.   That would give me a decent sonar/GPS/topo map combo for 185 dollar total investment...not including ipad.
891297,adempsey,2015-01-09 14:42:00,1498,"I like it, but I am a guy that loves looking at maps.   Even without a location/GPS function I would have purchased the app.     I never use it over my handheld GPS though.   My phone is heavy, not very useful in the sun and the GPS drains the battery too fast.  Also, I had to purchase the app twice for the same phone.   When they updated Android (?I think?)  a while back it borked my version so I had to pay for the new version of Navionics.   Although, I admit I, never contacted Navionics about this issue since the app is relatively inexpensive.  Still, not very nice!"
891324,bassjnkie,2015-01-09 17:06:00,1101,Great thanks for all the opinions and suggestions. I will always have power for my phone so that won't not a issue.. I did buy the app and yes I love it.. I searched known carp spot that I was told was 40 feet of water and turns out to be 22 FOW.. LOL I recommend this app to those that like to research spots.. Thanks again all
891326,bare foot wader,2015-01-09 17:19:00,1354,"the depths aren't 100% accurate, ballpark I'd say...but 40 to 22 is a big variance lol"
891328,manitoubass2,2015-01-09 17:33:00,11391,On the bodies of water I fish there can be 1-2 fow variances but that's normal with water fluctuations.
891364,Ben_Daniels,2015-01-09 22:34:00,435,"I've got the Vexilar T-Box. It's pretty sweet with a tablet, split screen with GPS and a fishfinder. Only downside is I need to bring a power bank along or else I run out of battery before the days over. Also pretty cool that everyone can connect their smartphones to it at the same time. I actually got it as a gift along with 2 co-workers. One of there's hasn't even left the office. Just asked if he wanted to sell it, he said sure in case you're interested!"
891407,Freshtrax,2015-01-10 02:11:00,2215,Ask him how much he wants will ya.

891473,Freshtrax,2015-01-10 18:34:00,2215,Looks like I just bought a new fish finder........shhhhhhhh don't tell the wife.
891476,SirCranksalot,2015-01-10 18:43:00,3291,"  I use Navionics on a big 10"" tablet and its pretty nice as no data is needed with the maps preloaded.   I'm not up on all the latest gadgets, but can you get the maps to go 'live' out on the lake on a tablet? i.e can you get reception somehow?"
891478,Freshtrax,2015-01-10 18:56:00,2215,"Im blessed  use an ipad with  a SIM card ( provided by work)   I can see my exact location while out on the lake.   I  think even without data you can get the maps  ( they are preloaded) I'm just not sure  about  location services, I'm not to techie my self."
