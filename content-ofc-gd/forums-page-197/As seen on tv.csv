891205,Ralph Field,2015-01-09 00:07:00,1018,They are making the pocket fisherman again. Love the fishing butler and I've caught many bass on the banjo minnow. I remember watching Babe Winkleman using them for giant pike on one of his shows.

I would pay good money to see that done."

It molded a square block around your hook...smelled disgusting and caught nothing LOL!"

Another 3 feet or so and the inventor would have been a millionaire as he would have invented the Snow Board.  Because of Al Linder I bought Lindy rigs in the 80's and they still work. Seagar line because Charlie Ray told me too, and it works too. Italo told me to buy a Rappala and I bought one once in spite of him and Barb telling me to."

My kids get me to bust out the snowboard once or twice a year when we go sliding, and that old confidence comes right back.  A few tricks makes the kids happy...  Then I can't walk for a week???"
891331,Garnet,2015-01-09 17:45:00,2056,I won a 100 boat walleye tournament on Rice Lake with the Banjo Minnow in photo graph perch colour.  And I had my parents looking for that Viola bobber shot rod at yard sales until they got to old .

891340,Acountdeleted,2015-01-09 18:32:00,2562,"See, with the Banjo Minnow, I'm just stubborn because it's a swim bait.  I'd rather get skunked or catch one or two fish with crank baits and spinners then catch a boat full using swim baits and pitch'n jigs........ Oh my god I've become my grandfather!"
891399,sofabed,2015-01-10 01:30:00,119,If you really are looking for the rocket fishing pole contact spin master toys as they made it. They developed but did not market a bow and arrow version of it.
891415,Sharkbait22,2015-01-10 03:21:00,297,Used a pocket fisherman a lot in Florida when i was 7-9 years old. Work well enough and traveled well. I think they are making them again. Not seen on tv but handy on the river http://www.smithcreek.co/rod-clip.php

Surprisingly has come in handy in a couple of spots where there's no room for a cast...boom, just fires straight out lol  Also just picked up a ""Pocket Chainsaw""  Haven't tried it out yet, but looking forward to being able to cut absolutely nothing with it real soon."

891829,Beavertail,2015-01-12 18:44:00,331,"This is going back quite a few years, but does anyone remember the commercials for the original Blue Fox Foxee jigs? I was just a kid at the time but it was brilliant marketing and a great commercial - basically a Foxee jig was swimming through the water taunting a huge bass before being engulfed. I ran out and just had to buy some....then couldn't understand why I wasn't hauling in 10lb largemouth every cast. Many lures/commercials are definitely designed to catch fisherman, not fish."
891136,mike rousseau,2015-01-08 19:42:00,4661,"Just wondering what TV fishing items you have used...  Love em? Hate em?  I had the flying lure kit as a kid... Worked good for a kid trying to jig rock bass off a dock...  I I currently use and love the ""fishing butler"" for keeping my 2 piece rods together...  Mike"
891137,Acountdeleted,2015-01-08 19:47:00,2562,I was bought the banjo minnow one year for Christmas. I'm not a fan of swim baits...... I'm not sure it came out of the package.

That said, my son convinced me to buy a pack of OBO floats, because Italo said they were the best slip floats. Looked like a pair of lopsided dumbells They fell apart real fast"

At a buddies cabin I found an old pocket fisherman and laughed at the thought of trying it. Hopped in a canoe and off I went.  No bites no nothing. Last time I reeled in I had a nice 13-14"" walleye on and I had no clue until it was on the surface ???. Super sensitive they are not."
