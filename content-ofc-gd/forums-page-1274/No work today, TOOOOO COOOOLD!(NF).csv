Not good temperatures to pour a concrete foundation. He told me to call him first thing in the morning for the next few days as the temperatures aren't supposed too be much better, alot of lost time in the winter. Oh well it gives some more time to work on getting that new business put together and hopefully have some warmer work days. For those of you in jobs that still have to be outside today, stay warm and be careful I really feel for you guys."

I have worked (and fished!!) in -40 temps in the past though. It's not fun. When I fished in those temps, I recall the holes freezing over in about 10 seconds."
