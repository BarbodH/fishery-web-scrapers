30840,Joey,2007-02-05 01:49:00,9122,"My GF Sandra brought over her new dog, Zoey.  I'm thinking musky bait    And Zoey's new jacket, I figure it will be easier to put the hook through the jacket without the bait trying to wriggle free!    My cat is bigger than this dog.  We had to keep them apart as Felix was eyeing her up for dinner.  Joey"
30842,Clampet,2007-02-05 01:56:00,1947,Cute little devil!
30843,fishindevil,2007-02-05 01:58:00,6254,thats a good one joey...lol...lol now your thinking.
30867,tjsa,2007-02-05 02:57:00,1578,"Heh, heh, heh, take the pup to a hairdresser, and get them to put some bright orange highlights on it, in firetiger pattern, then attach a BIG trailer hook to the end of the jacket. Use 80 lb. power pro at least. Should do the trick, lol."
30895,hogsmally,2007-02-05 03:38:00,21,"How do you rig a dog?  On a harness.  Sorry, it is an actual quote from a musky video that I have from the 1980's.  I couldn't resist."
30897,ccmtcanada,2007-02-05 03:42:00,7971,LOL...it look about the right size doesn't it?  Probably a little expensive to use those things every time out though....
30918,muskysean,2007-02-05 04:32:00,9,Need to find that jacket in a Perch or Firetiger pattern.
30921,Joey,2007-02-05 04:44:00,9122,"Hahahaha, too funny guys  That jacket is too big for the dog right now too, unbelievable.  Its only supposed to get a pound bigger at the most.  Joey"
30938,Rich Clemens,2007-02-05 10:51:00,3131,"My Dad has a yorkie too and I do call her ""Musky Bait"".   Doesn't go over very well.   Very cute dog none the less."
30965,jediangler,2007-02-05 13:22:00,1923,"Cute pooch, what breed is little Zoey, Joey? It looks like a good apartment sized pup."
