31387,lookinforwalleye,2007-02-06 01:23:00,4399,"so i booked a cruise today leave on the 25th visiting Cozumel,Grand Cayman,Jamaica,Turks&Caicos. Plan on doing some Catamaraning,snorkling,beer drinking, eating,relaxing.  Actually it`s our 30th wedding anniversary present to ourselves we were going to wait until April but damn it`s so cold right now."
31389,silveradosheriff,2007-02-06 01:25:00,1025,"Congrats on the big anniversary, and here's to warmer weather!"
31395,Bernie,2007-02-06 01:31:00,3190,Did that trip 2 years ago.Great time. Go swim with the stingrays in Grand Cayman and scuba or snorkel on the reef. Dont do the Falls thing in Jamaica. Get drunk on the beach at Cozumel.
31398,irishfield,2007-02-06 01:37:00,26272,"I wouldn't even get off the boat in Jamaica....unless it's a guarded van trip straight to Appleton's Rum distillary. The Island sure hasn't become safer in the 17 years since I was there last!  But yah ! Have FUN and be aware of your surroundings at all times. Kinda like walking many streets of TO at night...  You may be on holidays, but the bad types aren't no matter where you go."
31399,kennyman,2007-02-06 01:38:00,737,"Must be nice. Have a couple for me please. Post pics when you come back,or better yet while you're there."
31420,Rich Clemens,2007-02-06 02:12:00,3131,"Maybe this artic blast and cold front diving south will make it down to the Caribbean by the 25th, so you won't miss out too much.  That sounds like a great time and yes, post some pics when you get back.  Get a little tan for the rest of us."
31435,fishindevil,2007-02-06 02:39:00,6254,"HEY GUYS ....COME ON   NOT ONE PERSON MENTIONED FISHING  ,I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE MAIN REASON FOR GOING IN THE FIRST PLACE,RIGHT NOW IF I WERE YOU I WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW IM GOING TO MOUNT A BAIR OF BIG JON ELECTRIC DOWNRIGGERS TO THE SHIP..  .OH YA....HAVE A SAFE AND WONDERFUL TRIP...AND GO FISHIN"
31504,bowshep,2007-02-06 12:59:00,378,Irishfeild it's all about what your use too. You get a person who has lived their whole life in the city and never have been in the bush. Plunk them in your back yard alone and at night and they will be crapping their pants. I am glad l can do both. You have to be on gaurd where ever you are. Remember we were once cat food.  Peace
31564,walleyejigger,2007-02-06 16:56:00,876,"arctic weather??  come on, it's warming up, LOL  have fun, congrats on the anniversary"
