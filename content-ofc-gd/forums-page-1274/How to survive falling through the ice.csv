28232,Greencoachdog,2007-01-29 21:34:00,8163,That guy is crazy!... but in a good way!  I've watched this vid at least a dozen times over the past 2 or 3 yrs. and it never ceases to intrigue me!
28233,xrap,2007-01-29 21:35:00,683,"Thank you for posting that, makes me feel a bit safer"
28240,Joey,2007-01-29 21:44:00,9122,"Thanks Rick, I've never seen that before.  Good stuff to know.  Joey"
28250,irishfield,2007-01-29 22:08:00,26272,I can't watch it on dial up...but is it the one where the guy shows you to wait and let your hands freeze to the ice so you can pull yourself out without picks?
28251,huntervasili,2007-01-29 22:08:00,1604,Never seen that but I bet it would help in that situation... Thanks
28257,Greencoachdog,2007-01-29 22:21:00,8163," No Wayne, letting your arms freeze to the ice is the last resort. The Dr. tells you what to expect when you fall thru, how to get out, and what to do when you get out! They also tell how to help somebody get out if you're the one on top of the ice. It is a VERY informative video and they should have it at your public library. I would consider it a ""must see"" for anybody that lives in the ice belt!!!"
28261,irishfield,2007-01-29 22:31:00,26272,Thanks Glen. I'll wait 'till we have less activity on our server and try to get it to load up. How long is it?....the video Glen!
28263,Roy,2007-01-29 22:34:00,13728,It's 9 minutes and 42 seconds Glen.
28267,irishfield,2007-01-29 22:46:00,26272,Thanks Roy! Not gonna even try that one then..
31667,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-06 21:40:00,2585,yes i have seen that show on the discovery channel very informative!  Everyone should watch it once or twice a year to refresh your memory!  Cheers!
31678,glen,2007-02-06 22:15:00,2641,It looks like he had no floatation on.  I wonder what happens if you have a floater coat or suit on.  You should be alot higher in the water and it may be easyer to pull yourself out.  You may not get as cold either.  Did they do a test with a suit on?
