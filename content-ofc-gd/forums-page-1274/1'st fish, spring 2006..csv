31525,Castmaster,2007-02-06 14:28:00,86,What the heck are you doing here! LOL! No more dodgin bergs. I'll wait for 45 degrre water this year. Just a waste of fuel. But you can bet we're doing some fishing together this year brother!
31537,Hellfish,2007-02-06 14:57:00,308,"  Thats for sure cant wait, do u hit dunnville for the march cats???"
31544,mattyk,2007-02-06 15:22:00,2110,"Our Sauger and walleye run will start soon. After that will be the stripers, whites and hybrids. Can't wait!"
31548,Zib,2007-02-06 15:32:00,369,I'll be seeing you on the Detroit River CM. Where abouts to you usually fish? I'm usually in the Trenton Channel.
31550,Castmaster,2007-02-06 15:43:00,86,Hey Zib! Are you the same guy from the Greatlakes forum? The areas in blue are the areas I frequent. But usually don't have to move around too much. The whole river is really productive from the beginning of April all the way to July. 
31552,Zib,2007-02-06 16:03:00,369,"Yes, I'm the same guy from the Greatlakes forum. You should also try fishing out in front of Joe Louis if the water isn't too dirty."
31635,Chrispy,2007-02-06 20:22:00,168,I'll be in front of the Joe this year as well.....I didn't have my Michigan License last year but I will this spring!!  Around the Belle Isle bridge is really good when the water is clear too....also along the shore on the Michigan side past the light house in St. Clair.....Good seeing you Zib!!   Chrispy!
31647,Rich,2007-02-06 20:50:00,3927," Occasionally, but I have better spots closer to home."
31649,lilkynan,2007-02-06 21:11:00,173,Yea - soft water - as some may know I missed a whole season last year - but this year now in Barrie - with my boat that is rigged for Lake O salmon - I will do quite well for Lakers in Kempenfelt I do believe!! 
31685,Grimace,2007-02-06 22:58:00,2020,I hit the Detroit in the Spring as well.  I like to Launch from LaSalle.  great boat launch  Detroit Rock City  
31718,Zib,2007-02-07 00:28:00,369,"Chrispy,  Be prepared when you buy that Michigan license. They are talking about doubling the cost of fishing licenses for everyone. The Michigan DNR is crying broke again as usual. There will defiantly be a lot of PO'd fisherman, especially the seniors if they do double them.  Nice pics Grimace. I was at the Joe Friday night & will be there Wednesday night as well. Too bad itâ€™s not to fish for some walleyes."
31904,Chrispy,2007-02-07 13:25:00,168,"Are they going to give you a break if you buy more than one year at a time???  Maybe I should just get it now and get ahead of the price bump!!!  Cool pics Grimace!!  And your right they did a nice job on the LaSalle ramp!!  Went out of there 5 or 6 times this spring....gotta watch getting out into the river though.....hit bottom just outside the mouth, went from 8-9 feet to 2 feet in about 5 yards....I run a blue and white 18' Sylvan with a 75 horse Merc and a 6 horse Honda 4 stroke kicker....make sure ya give me a wave this spring!!  Chrispy!"
31925,Zib,2007-02-07 14:18:00,369, Buying a license now would be a waste of money because it would expire on March 31st. Michigan licenses are good from April 1st through March 31st of the following year. Free fishing weekends are Feb. 17th & 18th and June 9th & 10th this year.
31939,Chrispy,2007-02-07 14:59:00,168,Thanks for the info Brother!!   Chrispy!
31952,Castmaster,2007-02-07 15:22:00,86,Yep! I've already been waiting for March to get here so I can get mine.
