26652,FishHeadRic,2007-01-26 00:00:00,226,Thanks again Guys! I haven't seen the issue yet. Apparently they send em out before the news stands get them so I'm gonna have to wait a few weeks to get my copy.  FHR
26657,tjsa,2007-01-26 00:08:00,1578,"Publicity hound  No..........., seriously, great stuff Ric  Couldn't happen to a nicer OFC'er."

31164,FishHeadRic,2007-02-05 19:18:00,226,"Finally got my copy! Looks good! Thanks Outdoor Canada for printing it, and the $$$.   And  Thank you to all of you for your support and kind words over the past 4 years.  Take care folks, FHR"

26513,Spiel,2007-01-25 18:11:00,9065,....Nice !  
26514,urbanangler1990,2007-01-25 18:12:00,933,"that is awsome, wtg Ric! where ya been ? havnt heard of u in a while..."
26515,Roy,2007-01-25 18:12:00,13728,"Yup,   just got my issue. Ric de la Cruz in all his glory on page 41. Some really good reading again this issue with a special feature for city fishers. They even have a pic of my home waters and they didn't even photoshop anything."
26517,snag,2007-01-25 18:14:00,1932,"Funny story about that. I hope Ric is reading this.  I received an email from the gentleman who did the article. He was looking for Ric. He didn't give me too much info. So, I was a little hesitant to give him Rics info. Then I thought, It's only Ric, who cares. Anyways, I gave him Rics Hotmail and that was it.  Awhile (weeks, month?) later I call Ric and he tells me he's going to be a star. He was interviewed and his photo was purchased!  As his agent, I still have not received my cut.  "
26528,douG,2007-01-25 18:27:00,2693,"That's so cool to see OFNrs in print, like Rafal, Corey, JP, Justin, to name a few.  WTG, Mr. de la Cruze."
26531,Squid,2007-01-25 18:29:00,1656,Wow Ric is a star!!
26545,FishHeadRic,2007-01-25 18:52:00,226,"Thanks guys. I didn't realize they were planning on printing that issue so soon. I've been so busy with work and things lately that I haven't even been posting or fishing. Last time out was with Snag at OP a few months back already. Moving at the end of next month down to NY so I probably won't be able to get any more fishing in unless we get an extended warm spell. Oh Well Thanks again Guys.  Ric De La Cruz, FHR"
26546,Joey,2007-01-25 18:56:00,9122,"Hey, that's awesome Ric.  Congrats.  Can anyone take a pic with their digi and post it here?  Thanks.  Joey"
