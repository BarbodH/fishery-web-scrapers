31594,Slayingm,2007-02-06 18:40:00,204,Of all the years I have fished Lakers in various Haliburton Lakes this one takes the cake! Not only was a fish big but the colours and condition was prestine! My guests for the day and I had a amazing day catching and releasing lots of Lakers in the 5-17lb range. We were working hard (rock) to mud transistions in 65 to 81' of water using Luhr Jensen Kroc's tipped with minnows and shinners on small gamakatsu hooks. This monster like the others were all released after a quick picture. Best part was that all the fish we caught today were native... the markings and colours were unreal. Here is the biggest of the day.    Take care and Good Fish'n... Greg.
