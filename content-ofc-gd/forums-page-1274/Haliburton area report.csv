31630,troutologist,2007-02-06 20:11:00,951,beauty fish jeff. We'll have to get out after them again soon. How deep were you fishing there?
31663,jeffw,2007-02-06 21:34:00,267,I was fishin around 50-60 feet and I think that the flourocarbon leaders that we were using increased are catch because most of the fish weren't hammering the minnows they were lightly hitting it. Cheers Jeff
31675,Slayingm,2007-02-06 21:56:00,204,Great job Jeff.... nice fish.  Have been fishing the Haliburton's for them the past 3 weeks and also done well on small minnows on a hook just off bottom.  We have caught number in the 3 to 10lb class with the largest in the 16lb range..... hope the action keeps up!  ...Greg.
