Autum my greenwinged is only five yrs old so she is still a baby in parrot yrs. She will probably out live me but she really is a sweetheart, I am working on her with the camera she really is a chatter box but as soon as she sees the camera she just shuts right up......I am going to try and get her on video infront of a mirror she is just hillarious talking to herself in a mirror.....& hopefully share with u here.   Jen welcome to OFC hun ur going to love it here."
