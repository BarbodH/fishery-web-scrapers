29881,camillj,2007-02-02 09:09:00,1988,Lately I am having problems when I click on peoples pic's (it says click here to see full image on thumbnails) - I cant seem to get the big picture...  Is it just me or is it their post ?  Here is an example  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...p;mode=threaded   When I mouse-over the thumbnail it says 'click to enlarge' ... but when I click .. it doesnt ???
29894,Terry,2007-02-02 11:26:00,14456,it works for me..clicked and it opened a full size picture in a new window..might be a popup blocker that is stopping it

When it does,one of the available tabs should say""pop up blocker"". You may have to turn this off. I am far from a computer guru,but that may help you find it (it may not). Either way,it's worth a shot. Maybe one of the mods can help you out if it doesn't."
