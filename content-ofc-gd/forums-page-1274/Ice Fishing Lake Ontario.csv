30754,FishFinder,2007-02-04 21:45:00,481,"Went to a lake O rivermouth today in search of some bows or pike. The ice was a good 6 inches in most spots, but there was spots where it got so thin that my buddys foot went right through. After finding a spot with safe ice, i dropped in my roe bag, few minutes later, FISH ON. Wierd little thing, had no fight to it, Mud Puppie i think?     After that we had a few more hits but nothing else landed. Nice day out despite the freezing weather."

30917,bucktail,2007-02-05 04:31:00,1857,"Trophy Mud Puppy!! I havent got one in ages. Nothing beats landing a ""fish"" that pops out legs and runs around!!"
30962,BITEME,2007-02-05 13:16:00,1969,I know where you were and put my damn dog back in the water And lastly you no you have to pay a tax to fish there  All kidding aside dont push your luck with the open water edges there they have a tendancy to eat people your best to stay back about where you are in the picture the wave action from the lack makes it very unstable out further  Just my 2 cents heres 2 more chop your back grounds Peter
31323,Master of Bait,2007-02-06 00:14:00,196,"Hey, nice, uh, fish?  Better than getting skunked, right?  Just a quick question for you ecologists out there...  The little I know about amphibians like mud puppies is that they can be a good indicator of the health of the ecosystem since these guys are among the first to go when water quality is very poor.  Any truth to that?  Would their presence suggest things are not too bad at a given location?  Also, a lake I fish regularly has had some ""die offs"" of these guys.  Usually in the summer when the water gets pretty warm, I think.  Is this common?  Lemme know!"
31377,Bassman27,2007-02-06 01:03:00,98,Ugly little buggers aren't they.  Bassman
31386,steverowbotham,2007-02-06 01:23:00,1800,haha what a catch!
31401,Castmaster,2007-02-06 01:40:00,86,Catch em all the time on Lake St. Clair through the ice. Use caution out there! I wouldn't be out on ice that my feet were going right through in places. I had to say it!
31406,Rich,2007-02-06 01:43:00,3927,"Mud puppies are soooo icky!  Thanks for the report. I've caught my fair share of mud puppies as well , lol They aren't really that gross. No slimier than an esox."
