31219,SlowPoke,2007-02-05 21:24:00,2984,"It was a good day to check the mailbox (besides the HBC bill). A box of 11 muskie lures - thanks Dax A letter and sticker from St. Croix (does this mean they sonsered me? LOL) A shiney new Cabela's ""Master Catalog""  I think I'll call in sick tonight for work -Brian"
31222,blineboy 1970,2007-02-05 21:36:00,14,"I guess the old saying ""what a beautiful country"" would just about sum that up for me if all those goodies were in my mailbox."
31273,Roy,2007-02-05 22:55:00,13728,"Man, that IS a good haul."
31301,Rich Clemens,2007-02-05 23:36:00,3131,All I got was the Cabella's catalog .... maybe the lures will be here tomorrow.  We shall see.
31303,Carp,2007-02-05 23:40:00,1488,All I get is utility bills and the credit card statements.  I'd say you had a very good day with all that stuff you got.  Enjoy.
31369,fishindevil,2007-02-06 00:50:00,6254,"isnt it great when it feels like christmas all over again,  theres nothing better than getting your new goodies man i can hardly wait to open the box... i know how you feel..cheers"
31375,Bassman27,2007-02-06 01:00:00,98,That's a great day!!!  Bassman
31433,kennyman,2007-02-06 02:39:00,737,I just got bills this week   . Last week I did get an order of 16 spinnerbaits that I got really cheap off e-bay and the week before my Rapala JSR7 (silver/black). Sounds like you did a little better. You got a little something going on with the mail lady   ?
31464,GbayGiant,2007-02-06 04:17:00,1780,"Well, what lures did you get ? anything special."
31466,Joey,2007-02-06 04:20:00,9122,Score Slowpoke  I got these in my mail last week.  But I had to pay for them (only $5 apiece tho).    Joey
31469,Zib,2007-02-06 04:42:00,369,I'll gladly trade mail with you.
31483,SlowPoke,2007-02-06 09:21:00,2984," Sorry about the typo, I was in a rush and I needed to 'p'   LOL!! Keep an eye out for 'em...   I hope to soon, my wife has an application in at the post office but for now I just keep the driveway clear for the mail man!   I'll let you know next year around this time how special they were... "
31486,lew,2007-02-06 10:05:00,12767,"Nice haul Brian, you've got some good baits there."
31495,SlowPoke,2007-02-06 12:03:00,2984,"Thanks Lew! My Muskie lure collection is growing fast and will soon rival that of a muskie angler that knows what the heck (s)he's doing! I got my biggun' last season trolling, this years goal is to catch one casting. I had a little taste of it last season when a 50""er (in Steve's opinion, I didn't get a good look at it) nailed my lure while sending my line out to the p-board. I probably didn't get a good hook set with just my thumb on the free spool. Okay, now I'm getting all excited!  -Brian"
31499,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-06 12:43:00,0,Nice looking lures there slowpoke.  I got the Cabela's catalog as well.
31513,Photoz,2007-02-06 13:49:00,792,"Yeah h h h  h . .. . .    a bunch of us at The Post Office had a look at them before the carrier delivered 'em . . . . .   .     a couple of us were going to test a few for you, but it's tough finding enough open water for this these days. We were VERY careful, rewraping 'em, as we didn't want to look like a bunch of snoops. U h h h  h  h   . . . . . .    howcum you don't subscribe to a few good fishing magazines . . .     we get sick of Charelaine, Readers Digest & Toronto Life when it's slow!"
31520,Headhunter,2007-02-06 14:17:00,5703,"Ha HA, very funny Photoz! Nice to see you back! Well, for me, my mail box was well, like most, stuffed with bills and people sending me stuff to create more bills! On the bright side, my wife was waiting for me, with a lovely dinner of ""hot tongue and cold shoulder""! HH"
31572,mattyk,2007-02-06 17:23:00,2110,Those are some nice lures you got there. Only 4 months to go for muskie season.
31581,misfish,2007-02-06 17:46:00,29133,Nice haul indeed.  I like the top right one. That looks like a sweet bait.
31673,Handlebarz,2007-02-06 21:50:00,3790,nice haul Brian now we just have to get ya down here again and try them out.
31679,GbayGiant,2007-02-06 22:36:00,1780,"I got one of those salmo (whitefish) 2nd down on the right, it hasn't got me a musky but the pike can't resist it for some reason, it is all chipped and mangled after I would guess 15-20 nice pike. Might want to change the split-rings on it the first pike I got on it twisted and broke both  split-rings."
31849,SlowPoke,2007-02-07 09:27:00,2984,"Mike, you won't have to twist my arm too hard to get back out there with ya! John, in that case (pike love em) I'm glad I have two of them!  -Brian"
