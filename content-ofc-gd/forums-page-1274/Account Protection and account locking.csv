I've noticed alot of accounts were locked in the last few weeks by the security software. If, in a short time, three incorrect passwords are entered during a log in attempt on your account, the account is locked down. You won't be able to get back in until we unlock it. So after two shots, give up. If you are at home and logging in, let Opera or Firefox remember the password. Use the password recovery and it will email you a new password. You'll then be able to change it to something that, hopefully, you won't forget."
