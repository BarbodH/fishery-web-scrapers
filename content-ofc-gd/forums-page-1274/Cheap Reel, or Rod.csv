31221,holdfast,2007-02-05 21:32:00,1813,"Thanks for the input guys, Yea you too Rich. Im confident that most people would go for the Shimano Reel and Ugly stick.  I guess the Mitchell 300x would be another alternative.  What I like about the Shimanoo is they always had no springs on their finger flip bails.  A simple but effecient invention.  No problems finding spare spools either.  I find however on my 300x the handle screw loosens too easily and the spool for the drag seems to rotate off centre or crooked.  Yea ive been happy with the 2 ugly sticks that ive used for many seasons"
31245,Big Cliff,2007-02-05 22:15:00,6899,"I have everything from $400.00 custom made rods fitted with some fairly expensive reals to things I have bought at auctions for $5.00 for the rod and reel.  Just bought a Shakespeare Supera (big water) rod and reel down in Myrtle Beach for $19.95. Excellent outfit (you can rent them on the pier for $18.00 a day, same thing).  We have a lot of kids and guests fishing here throught the summer and I always keep a bunch of rods and reels handy. I have found that if you watch for the sales you can pick up a reasonably good rod and reel combo at CTC for $29.00 - $39.00. I have always liked Shimano, Mitchell, but with 15+ combinations, I have a bit of just about everything.  My suggestion is; until YOU can tell the difference between a Good/Intermediate/Top of the line outfit, stick with the inexpensive stuff and enjoy yourself or come out here and experiment with some of the stuff I have."
31248,1leggedangler,2007-02-05 22:26:00,364,"I'll throw a vote for the Ugly Stick. I have one going 12 years and counting. A little hockey tape on the handle and she's good to go from half decent smallies to big eyes. Best money I ever spent for an almost all purose rod.  Cheers, 1leg"
31412,Weedman,2007-02-06 01:54:00,32,"Check out the Super Specials that LB puts in their catalogue every year.  Some of the deals for spinning outfits are excellent bargains and the quality is there too.  Get yourself to the Spring Fishing Show and LB's will fix you up no problem.  For your $75, you can get a decent Daiwa or Shimano combo.  I managed to find a super buy at BPS for my kids last fall.  They were selling Shimano Sahara's (with fluidrive) with a BPS 6 1/2 ft. IM6 high mod graphite rod for $79.  Just the reel retails for $85 at LB's.  My kids can't wait to test drive their new outfits in the spring.  They're fishing nuts.....Our friend's cottage is on a lake loaded with both small and largemouth bass, and walleye and pike are pretty good too.  Non stop action can be had most days.  We're so fortunate as we get to be custodians of the place most of the year, as our friends work overseas and are only home for 6 weeks in the early summer."
31423,kennyman,2007-02-06 02:19:00,737,"MAN!!! I bought a Sahara a couple weeks ago for $87 from BPS. I'm excited to try it too, but know my butt hurts  . I'll be at the Spring Fishing Show looking for deals though. Got my fingers crossed."
31447,Carp,2007-02-06 03:16:00,1488,"Another vote for the Ugly Stick.  One of the first rods I ever bought as a young teen about 24 years ago. 7ft. medium action spinning rod. A bit thicker and heavier than todays rods, but I've used it for muskie and pike trolling. (it'll pull some large lures with ease) Fished the rivers for salmon (30+ pounds), no problem. Still have the rod and it's in great condition. Tough as nails.  I've checked out the new models of Ugly Sticks and they get my vote too.  ABU, Mitchell and Shimano reels always did their job for me. You should be able to find a good combo approx. $75 or under as already mentioned."
31473,Zib,2007-02-06 04:55:00,369," I'll second that. Or should that be third?  I have that Mitchell 300X & it is great for the price. It puts the line very evenly on the reel, more so than any of the much more expensive Shimano's or Quantums that I own."
31474,Zib,2007-02-06 04:57:00,369," ""If it ain't Scottish, it's crap!"""
31538,David Chong,2007-02-06 14:58:00,836,"Daiwa has really expanded into more economical combos and would be a great choice. Reel-wise a Daiwa Regal Xi is a phenomenal buy for $50 or less. Come with a spare spool, is available in sizes from a UL 1000 up to a monster 4000 and has a Daiwa drag! Bass Pro Shops during it's Spring Classic is also a great place to get equipment! They will have their annual reek trade in program with all the older reels being donated to kids' clubs! Cheers, Dave"
31672,Handlebarz,2007-02-06 21:49:00,3790,UGLY STICK  For the price you want to pay you will get alot outta them they have life time guarntee and can handle almost anything.
31883,aplumma,2007-02-07 13:02:00,6896,"The best rod and reel combo is the one that fits your hand like a glove. It must be strong enough to control the fish that you are fishing for yet sensitive enough to feel the lightest bite. It needs to be light enough to cast all day without making your arm and wrist hurt. It most importantly need to be the combo that you want to fish with otherwise you have wasted your money. At different points in my life I have use this guideline to buy my equipment. The rods that I troll with, bobber fish or liver bait they can be heavier and less sensitive. The rods I cast with all day need to be light and the ones I finesse fish have to be very sensitive. Thru the years I have bought and given away many setups that I did not use because they were not just right and sat unused. So when you go shopping put together the combo in the store that you like then ask the price if it is to much then come back when you can afford it or talk the man down. If your new combo costs you 300 dollars and last only 10 years it is only 30.00 a year. Some of my set ups are 20+ years and still doing just fine. Finally as your taste in combos progresses and you find that some of your earlier combos are no longer used take them down to the water with you and find someone who would be thrilled to have your ""special"" combo for free so they can become hooked on fishing.  Art"
31899,OhioFisherman,2007-02-07 13:19:00,6623,Like Art says if it doesn`t feel comfortable you won`t pick it up and use it as often.
30281,holdfast,2007-02-03 02:45:00,1813,"ALL RIGHTY, Seems I got shot down here, Like a deer in the Head Lights.  Ive only seen 1 consumer reports on reliability on fishing reels and Rods.  I Spoke to the Reel DR in Edmonton and his words were.  Numbers of Ball bearings mean nothing.  ie He likes a reel with 3 than 8.  SO FOLKS, some of us dont want to spent to much, Lets say under $75 ............The UP AND BUDDING FISHERMAN SHOULD GET?"
30284,Canuck2fan,2007-02-03 02:59:00,1444,"I don't know what type of rod or reel you are looking for under 75.00 bucks.... There are all kinds of choices many such combos can be had at BPS, CT, Wallmart, or LeBarons.  I have a number of Shakespeare rods and Pflueger reels that were all under 75 bucks a piece and am very happy with them. The Medalist series of reels especially. Trion rods from Pflueger have a very high graphite content and perform very well for me and a few friends.  If you specify what species you plan to go after I am sure the folks around here can offer you a number of options."
30285,Beans,2007-02-03 03:01:00,3339,A Mitchell 300X on a  Shakespeare Ugly Stik will be in the $75 range at BPS if it is a spinning outfit you want
30286,ccmtcanada,2007-02-03 03:03:00,7971,My wife (Bly on the board) bought a 7 foot Pike combo from Canadian Tire for 34 bucks.  It managed to pull in LOTS of big walleye this year...including her 15lb personal best.  I bought a Mitchell combo ($39) as well from CT....have no complaints.
30288,taper,2007-02-03 03:09:00,611,I can second the ugly stik they are a great all around rod for the price.
30289,mepps,2007-02-03 03:10:00,1301,Ugly stick for sure! Any reel by Quantum!
30291,GbayGiant,2007-02-03 03:14:00,1780,"I say go for quality over quantity or cheap stuff save your money it will pay off in the end, you can break reels and rods so easy, it's like buying cars you can get lucky and have your car go 400K with no problems, or the same model/make for someone else might only get 10k out of it before they start having problems, you never know even with quality stuff. The difference is companies that believe in their quality will have a better warranty, I always buy rods with lifetime warranty if possible, reels are a different story some people want the lightest reel possible, but from my experience heavy is usually better quality but not always and more ball bearings usually just means more problems but do have a smoother retrieve until they break."
30292,fishersquige,2007-02-03 03:24:00,52,Shimano Sedona could be had for $60-70 pretty nice smooth lightweight reel.  The pflueger as well is a pretty decent one too.
30300,knotaclue,2007-02-03 03:39:00,136,"I picked up a shimano sojourn 5 foot ultra light up in Barrie for thirty bucks which I mated to a Mitchell avocet gold that I got for thirty five bucks. I think it’s a nice little ultra light rig for 65 $. It helps if you keep you eyes open, my rod was no tax {boxing week sale] and the reel was on sale as well.i’v also used it outside the hut on the ice."
30307,jjcanoe,2007-02-03 04:09:00,744,Just bought an ultra light rod and reel for a buddy of mine at Lebarons yesterday.  He's going on a trip with me on the trout opener and he also fishes a few times a year for perch.  $16.00 for the rod (shimano fx 5') and $18.45 for a Shakespere UL reel total cost $34.45 plus tax  jjcanoe
30310,bigfish1965,2007-02-03 04:15:00,3382, Gets my vote too!
30324,Hooked,2007-02-03 06:37:00,891," That is soooo true.  BB's means nothing.  I have a funny feeling stating that, likes theres connotation to it or something?       I have seen Berkley Lightning Rod Prolites, Buzz Ramsey or Hank Parker series, for $30, add a Pflueger Trion or Shimano Sonara, yer lookin at $80 maybe or less. Thats what I would buy....gee...wait a sec, that is what I did buy and happy with that combo!"
30326,carll2,2007-02-03 06:54:00,443,i love the shimano reel/rod combo you find at canadian tire for about 35$ cant go wrong i have 3  sets  now for  a couple years and nothing has gone worng with them
30329,Bob,2007-02-03 08:04:00,370,"Guys with lots of loot can afford high end stuff and stay ahead of the Joneses.  Most reasonably priced CTC combos at $69.95 or so will do the same job and not break your heart if a rod tip gets slammed into a car door.  I've used lots of different combo outfits and caught high end fish without any problems.  Don't let elitist horsepucky bother you when it comes to fishing.  I started with a cane pole and a piece of string.  Yeah, I'm an old guy."
30339,yzer93,2007-02-03 10:52:00,7,"i've got a shimano slade, $40, and a sojourn rod $30, nice little set up."
30352,OhioFisherman,2007-02-03 13:24:00,6623,"Ya the number of ball bearing really means nothing, if you stick a hundred of them in there and they are poor quality all you got is a number to sell it with.  Inexpensive outfits with decent quality? Casting, Abu 4600 or 4601 C-3 will handle most freshwater species, not a good choice for salmon or skis, maybe not if your slamming big pike on a regular basis. Not a lot of problems with that reel and reasonably priced.  Spinning, Shimano Sahara 2500, same reasons as above.  Rods, Berkley Lighting rods, Diawa Heartland, Shimano Convergence, Ugly sticks, serviceable and won`t break the bank."
30353,Hellfish,2007-02-03 13:41:00,308,Yeah i have the Sahara 2500FB great reel use it for cats and the eyes cost me 80.00 2 yrs ago so i would think it has gone down in price from then great reel i have it paired with a 30.00 8.5-9ft ugly stick love the combination.
30361,pikehunter,2007-02-03 14:09:00,1659," I have this set up, but the rod is the Ugly ""Lite"" seams to be OK, I have had it for a couple of seasons. The 300 has a 6:1 retrieve.  I can remember about 20 or 30 years ago the ugly stick alone cost 90 - 100 bucks, and that was in 1970's dollars. I wonder how they can make them and sell them so cheap now? China?"
30375,JerseyDog,2007-02-03 15:18:00,190,Ugly Stick is great.
30382,mattyk,2007-02-03 16:27:00,2110,Shimano Sahara is a pretty decent real and the price is not bad either.
30414,kennyman,2007-02-03 18:44:00,737,"I have a couple combos at my disposal. Mine is an Shakespaere/Ugly stick and the other is a Mitchell/Avocet combo. The Avocet is much smoother and the rod has more ""feel"" to it. The Ugly stick has a ton more backbone, but the reel is chunky feeling by comparison. If I was out casting a Mepps #3 spinner I'd use the Mitchell. For topwater I'd take the Ugly Stick combo all the way."
30515,NBR,2007-02-03 23:18:00,163,"I'd go to Bass Pro, tell clerk how and what I fished for, what I wanted to spend and ask him to put reels on rods with the combo matching my price. Then I'd buy the one that felt the best in my hand.  I agree on the number of bearings. A baitcaster need a brg on each end of the spool, maybe one on the gear and the instant reverse  All the others are fluff that possibly make the reel smoother. I haven't figured any reason for bearing in spinning outfits. None of their shafts ever turn at any high speed."
30577,Blake,2007-02-04 03:38:00,418,"For a nice Combo look at the Shimano Sojourn and a Shimano Slade 2500FB, or the Sienna 2500FB.  Nice combo for multi species fishing and in the price range."
30580,Rich,2007-02-04 03:53:00,3927,I'd get something British.
30699,Ben_Daniels,2007-02-04 17:13:00,435,"Ive bought allot of cheap spinning combos, some last allot longer than other. Daiwa and Qunatum combos have always seemed to last longer than any others ive bought. Id say just go a bass pro shops rod and a reel that doesnt have too much plastic on it. Rear drag on cheep reels never last long either in my opinion.  -Ben"
