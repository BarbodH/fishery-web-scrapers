Im interested in finding and purchasing some jigs ( the larger ones), swedish pimple, badd boyz (sp?) .           I cant seem to find an online store that has them all, or even a couple of them.  BPS, Cabelas, random others dont seem to have these products. Even teh jigs site didnt seem to advertise the larger jigs, or else I didnt see them.  Thx in advance."

31443,Beats,2007-02-06 03:11:00,543,"i suppose I was a tad vague.  I dont think the things im looking for are hard to find in stores, I just cant find them online.  Im looking for lures/jigs that are popular on Simcoe for lakers/whitefish.  I keep seeing reports of ppl using bad boyz(sp?) and jigs but when I go to sites and type thses names in, I get nothing.  I dont have a tackle shop nearby, so im resorting to online shopping if possible.  I couldnt seem to find the larger jigs (2 inches?) on the jigs site.  I was kinda hoping there was one site that I could order all these things from without having to spcial order them through a manufacturer."
