31346,Motorhead,2007-02-06 00:28:00,163,Actually.... I have to say I was looking at regular season goals and didn`t add the 26 playoff goals so I guess I was wrong...
31348,Jigger,2007-02-06 00:29:00,1237,"Heres the thing, I already said I'd give up the tickets. But if Motorhead gets the first set, than I donate my winnings to nautifish. I'm not about to mess with the fishing gods!!! Have fun Nauti  !"

31332,nautifish,2007-02-06 00:18:00,1416,553.33 metres
31333,Tybo,2007-02-06 00:19:00,1373,"TJ, Either you give the tickets too me, Or i'll have to take you outside and show you a lesson hard learnt."
31334,nautifish,2007-02-06 00:20:00,1416,& i still wanna know the correct answer for bobby orr.

31344,Gerritt,2007-02-06 00:26:00,6129,"I think TJ realized he made a mistake and is making up for it by asking a different question to ""level"" the playing field.....  hopefully you get one! But Jigger had the correct answer first  Enjoy the show Nauti..  Gerritt."
