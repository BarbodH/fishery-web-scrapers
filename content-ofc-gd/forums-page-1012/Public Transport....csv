215957,HTHM,2008-06-16 03:32:00,4082,Try Canada Coach Lines or maybe the Greyhound websites to see if they have any runs in the direction you want to go.

216158,maybe,2008-06-16 18:04:00,307,"Peterborough's city transit site  Yellowpages.ca listings for taxi serving Peterborough  Far as I know, the closest VIA Rail gets to Ptbo is Cobourg - 50km away.  If there's bus service from there to here, I don't know about it.  I've seen cabs from down there up here, but no clue what that'd cost."
