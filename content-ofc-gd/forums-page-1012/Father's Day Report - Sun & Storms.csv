215971,jace,2008-06-16 05:43:00,472,looks like a good father's day.  any day with a line in the water is a good day.  i dig the gangsta way you're holding the musky.
215976,solopaddler,2008-06-16 10:14:00,8605,"Nice clean looking musky bud, wtg!"
215980,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-16 10:19:00,1362,Great report Cliff and nice pics!!
215988,Victor,2008-06-16 11:11:00,1609,I guess the fishing gods are recognizing that it's father's day and you can finally catch a few!   or was it that bly was only positioning the boat all day to find good spots for you?   just kidding  A beautiful muskie! Must be an awesome way to spend the day
215991,wgk36,2008-06-16 11:17:00,69,"Nice report Cliff, and nice Musky. I've never tried crappie either, mainly because I've never caught more than 1 at a time.  I guess it's just someting to add to my to do list."
216025,ccmtcanada,2008-06-16 12:44:00,7971," The rain wasn't terrible....stung a little on the face as we headed into the launch.  It was more the lightning that was concerning....LOL.  It stopped shortly after we loaded up the boat, but we had to be home anyways."
216026,Roy,2008-06-16 12:48:00,13728,"Glad you had a nice Father's Day, Cliff. Thanks for the report....great pics BTW."
216027,jwl,2008-06-16 12:51:00,1056,"sounds like a pretty good day, that musky you got is pretty solid and chunky for the size of it, i bet that was a scrappy one"
216079,Rattletrap2,2008-06-16 15:27:00,1652,"Nice report and pictures Cliff!  When I used to start my 20 h.p Merc, I would pull the choke all the way out and push it back in twice. After the two full stokes, I would push it back in and pull it half way out on the third time and then start it up. Always worked well for me."
216219,snag,2008-06-16 20:50:00,1932,Very nice Cliff!  I have a feeling you'll be the King of the Bog soon.       Then Carole will take the thrown   .
216263,mepps,2008-06-16 23:29:00,1301,"Beauty catch, great way to spend fathers day for sure!"
216430,ehg,2008-06-17 13:50:00,2666,"Nice way to spend a Fathers Day. That is a decent musky for sure you will catch more this season  Nothing scarier than being in a boat during a thunderstorm, great picture of everyone racing off the lake."
215766,ccmtcanada,2008-06-15 19:41:00,7971,"Well, Bly asked me earlier in the week what I'd like for father's day.  I replied, don't get me anything....let's go fishing...just the two of us.  So, we made babysitting arrangements and at 6:45am, we were on our way to Lake Scugog.  The public boat launch in Port Perry was pretty empty...we were the only ones there and counted only a few trailers in the parking lot.  It was a perfect morning.....winds out the south at around 10km/h, temperature at around 18C.  We decided to head to a spot on the lake we'd never fished before, so we booted it as quickly as my little 18hp could take us.  We were in the middle of the lake, marking fish, so we began to drift some jigs, hoping to get into a walleye or two for dinner.  The first few drifts didn't produce anything, so at the tail end of the second one, I put on something bly got me for Father's Day....a Mepps Black Fury.  I started fan casting and suddenly, I think I've snagged in the mother of all weeds.  Then I felt the head shake!!  Drag started screaming as I tried to gain control.  The fish wouldn't come up...so I had no idea how big it was.  I knew it wasn't huge, but you always like to see the fish.  It was almost under the boat when it came up....STRAIGHT UP....AND FAST!  It leaped out of the water and rolled right before our eyes before splashing the both of us.  It wasn't ready to come in.  Another good splashing of us, and I finally brought it close enough to land.  Didn't bother to weigh this fish, but the length was 33.5""....if I didn't catch another fish all day, it would have still been a good one!! LOL.   Bly and I traded catching rock bass after rock bass, until something hit my line as I was eating a chocolate bar.  I thought it was another rock bass, but alas, I pulled in this 10"" Crappie.  We decided to keep this one....I've never tasted crappie before, so I figured we'd have a little snack later on.   After breaking for lunch, we headed in to a local marina to pick up a t-shirt for Bly....her shoulders were burning to a crisp so she needed something to cover them.  After finding one, we picked up a few drinks and snacks and headed back out.  It was a nice little break to stretch our legs a little.  We decided to try another spot that looked promising on the GPS....and began to drift again.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted these clouds headed towards us rather quickly.   We pulled our lines in a hit a different spot a little closer to the boat launch, just in case we had to get out of there quickly!  As soon as got to the new spot a loud crack of thunder rumbled through the air.  Ok...time to head in!!  Apparently, we weren't the only ones with this thought.  All these boats with HUGE motors began to head in as well....   I kept my hand firmly on the tiller...saying ""Come on little engine...you can do it!!""  It was now pouring rain...   The vacant boat launch this morning was now PACKED with boats....the docks full, and there were other boats circling.  We got our spot and I went to get the CRV.  We quickly got out of the water, just as some more thunder rattled through the sky.  So, all in all, I had a great Father's Day!  Getting out on the water and catching fish is a good day in my books."
215768,TennesseeGuy,2008-06-15 19:48:00,957,Great present to spend a day fishing with your sweetie.  Nice job.  Having a sitter report that early on a Sunday morning was quite a good start.
215769,fishindevil,2008-06-15 19:52:00,6254,"Nice report & pics cliff !!!!.  ..glad you got a nice muskie and a tasty little crappie,man they sure taste good,too bad you didnt get a few more,i guess your other half didnt out fish you today   you got lucky !!!!!...LOL..LOL.. cheers,and that was a great fathers day present for sure   did you try any of the spots i showed you ???"
215770,ccmtcanada,2008-06-15 19:55:00,7971," Thanks Shawn....and yep...we tried those spots...marked fish, but didn't get any walleye.  We'll be back again to try them out.  Actually, now that I think about it, that muskie came not too far from one of those waypoints you put on my GPS....hehe."
215771,ccmtcanada,2008-06-15 19:55:00,7971, Our babysitter was our oldest daughter...hehe...just woke her up as we were leaving....

215791,HTHM,2008-06-15 20:55:00,4082,"Nice fish, and looks like a great day"
215794,Rich Clemens,2008-06-15 21:01:00,3131,"Great job Cliff.  Sounds like ya had some great fun with that ski, including a nice jump out of the water.  Quite the adreneline rush eh ?"

215856,forrest,2008-06-15 23:54:00,1032,Nice report...the muskie and the rain adventure sounded like the best part....good adrenaline. All those big boats running like mice from a cat....was the rain really that bad?  forrest
215860,MJL,2008-06-16 00:01:00,2427,Great report Cliff.  That muskie is a beauty.  Looks like an amazing trip out.  I've never eaten crappies either...Let me know how they taste
215869,Sinker,2008-06-16 00:18:00,8692,I guess the motor is working Ok now? I forgot to ask before......  Sinker
215872,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-16 00:19:00,0,Nice Musky. I too took home a crappie the other day to check it out. You will enjoy it!!!!
215875,ccmtcanada,2008-06-16 00:23:00,7971,"Yep...it was tasty!  We only had one, but we still had it as a side dish to dinner.     The motor is running great!  I've been starting it up like you suggested and have had no problems at all.  Prime it a few times, then pull the cord.  I usually have to move the choke to the 2nd or 3rd position, but it starts right.  Big Cliff put a new impeller on it last weekend and it's peeing like crazy now."
215882,Sinker,2008-06-16 00:31:00,8692,  Sweet! I figured it would be working fine!!
215884,Big Cliff,2008-06-16 00:36:00,6899,"Big Cliff and ccmt put the impeller on last weekend! LOL  Glad to hear you had a wonderful fathers day, the rain held off here most of the day with one quick burst around 2:30 but it was over almost as quickly as it started. The big storm hit here around 7:45, lots of rain and wind, it seems to be clearing again right now though. A few branches down, our lawn chairs blown across the lawn but no other damage that I can see."
215886,ccmtcanada,2008-06-16 00:40:00,7971," If you want to be picky, YOU actually put the impeller in the housing....LOL.  I helped take it apart, look for tiny parts that were dropped and helped put it back together again.  Yep...that 230 rain drove us off the water....and we're getting hammered again...the second round is hitting now.  Glad to hear you guys weather the storm ok...hope Andy did ok too!"
215903,jdmls,2008-06-16 01:31:00,575,nice musky Cliff !!!.....The bog is one discouraging Lake...good to see you guys produced in the new boat
215915,TJQ,2008-06-16 01:54:00,7806,Thats awesome dude... how many muskies is that for you??  of course... Ive never caught a walleye..
215919,ccmtcanada,2008-06-16 02:02:00,7971, That would be my 4th.  First one ever was up at Lakair last year!
