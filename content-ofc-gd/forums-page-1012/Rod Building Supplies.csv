I have found quite a few that are based in the states, but with the cost of shipping, its not worth it to order from them. Anyone know of a mudhole.com type site from Canada?  Thanks, *Stoty"

Andy is great to work with.  shoot him an email with questions about his products or service and you'll see what i mean.  reactionbaits  also in BC.   they're only a lamar dealer so it's not everything but lamar has some cool stuff  john's fly tying materials in london.    all 3 are online stores.  the last 2 have the worst websites on the planet but it must work for them.   the first 2 have toll free 800 numbers.   Click away on reactionbaits links until you find ""rod building"" on the right menu to get to their lamar products."
