215764,jjcanoe,2008-06-15 19:23:00,744,"we've been trying secure an egg source for our walleye hatchery for years but can't get approval from the LEMU.  Used to get them from the Dunnville club but all of a sudden the Grand river walleye and the Thames river walleye are a different strain of fish, even though we stocked Grand R fish for years in the Thames  jjcanoe"

215789,Clampet,2008-06-15 20:46:00,1947,"Great job guys! By releasing them into the tributary itself, these little guys will imprint and return there to spawn.  I read somewhere that the ministry did the exact opposite by releasing the fingerlings (?) in open water.  Apparently they don't reproduce that way."
216210,jjcanoe,2008-06-16 20:18:00,744,Theres only a few cold water stream down here in the banana belt that we can release them in.  Anything above Fanshawe dam or Hunts dam is verboten since these are VHS barriers  jjcanoe
