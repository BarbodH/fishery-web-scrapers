216521,Joey,2008-06-17 17:35:00,9122,Found this cool time lapse video of ants picking the carcass of a dead gecko clean.  Paul has always said this would be a cool way to have a pike head cleaned to put in your den or something.  Fascinating stuff.  Ants v Gecko  Joey

216559,oxcowboy,2008-06-17 18:56:00,544,"neat,  there is a guy near us that is doing something similar with flesh eating beatles to clean deer skulls.  when they get done, there is nothing left but a fleshless skull and some beetle manure, a quick scrub and they looked as though you had bleached them.  jason"

216693,BFSC Kevin,2008-06-18 01:52:00,1351,i recall seeing something like that before but with maggots to clean a skull... quite interesting.
216698,cram,2008-06-18 02:03:00,1733,The museum in Toronto uses a bug/beetle room to clean carcasses....some of which are relatively big.
