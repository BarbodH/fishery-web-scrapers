We hit a lake just north of Simco around 8 am not sure which one  After about 10 casts the first fish of the day hit a healthy 37""er  This is the only pic I got with my camera.  My buddy Kev got a small guy about 2 hours later  After that I kept hitting 2-3 lb smallies on big bucktails.  Also a PB 22"" walleye.  Yeah I dont fish walleye  In all had a great day on the water.  Learnt alot from Mike our guide.  Heading out again this Thursday to Cameron lake for some more skis."
