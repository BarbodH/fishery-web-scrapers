214044,ehg,2008-06-11 03:18:00,2666,"Lots of good replies and stories, lotsa examples of what a musky's power and teeth can do. SNAG's first reply sounds like ya gotta be very careful musky fishing in a kayak.  A boga that 'swivels' sounds alright from canoe, definitely need tools listed in reply below at the ready as well."
214057,jediangler,2008-06-11 03:59:00,1923,"I now hand land and use a smaller set up similar to what Musky and Specks showed in his reply. I know that these are unpopular among most musky fishermen on the board but my belief is they work quicker and are safer, for me and the fish, in most cases.  I agree with Pure, carp fishing in a kayak is way harder than musky fishing. You effectively become part of the tackle. You are the bobber, following the carp wherever it wants to take you. When you do finally tire one out, there is nowhere to grab them. Here's one from a pond off the Grand and one from Gordon Pittock conservation area.   "
214080,musky_man,2008-06-11 10:22:00,159,"While I have not caught as many musky as Lew ... yet  ... I have to wonder about the wisdom of landing any large musky in a kayak.  A 48"" + thick fish is a handful under the best of conditions.  I'm with Lew in terms of where to hold the fish and I also agree that any of the ""grip"" devices are likely to hurt the fish regardless of their design.  Seems to me the gent above has the right idea  -- get to shore and do it there, if at all possible.  Also -- have a pair of Knipex with you ... eventually you will need them."
214082,steve_paul,2008-06-11 11:01:00,658,Can anyone recommend a good place online to buy Knipex Cutters??
214090,lew,2008-06-11 11:30:00,12767,"steve_ paul, I ordered mine from Saskatchewan and had them in a couple days.  Don't know if $48.85 is the best price available, but I was happy with the service and it's a Canadian company.  I went with the springloaded ones as I find them the best to work with.  www.theringlord.com  >>> tools >>>cutters >>> cobalt cutter with spring"
214093,steve_paul,2008-06-11 11:33:00,658," Thanks Lew, will order them today and should have them in lots of time for our French River trip at the end of the month."
214104,lew,2008-06-11 11:45:00,12767,"Your welcome steve_paul, just be sure to tie them to your boat with a long lanyard or something, they're too darned expensive to drop in the drink  I use a long expandable telephone cord that works well, it was a tip I recieved from TEP"
215037,singingdog,2008-06-13 11:10:00,1047,"Thanks for the replies. For now, I am just going to stick with single-hook lures, jaw spreaders, long nose pliers and bolt cutters. I had a very fiesty fish yesterday - probably about 35"" - that I just clipped the spinnerbait hook on: small price to pay for watching a 3' fish charge a spinnerbait in 16 of water.  For the record, I have no intention of putting a musky in my lap, especially one with treble hooks in it  ....seems like a great way to get hooked in parts that I don't ever want to get hooked.  For those folks that are doubtful about musky fishing out of a kayak, check out what is going on these days in kayak fishing. Compared to some of the fish that are being caught by kayak fisherman, a musky is not that big: 400 lb salmon sharks, threshers, bluefin tuna...."
215042,ricoboxing,2008-06-13 11:17:00,398,"i landed a few musky in my kayak last season, most of them i didnt even have to take outta the water. after the fish gets tired, lift its head out of the water, remove the hooks with pliers, revive then release. but thats also why i don't have any pics of my muskies."
215661,keigan,2008-06-15 06:24:00,3,"ive never fished from a kayak. i've never fished for musky, either. and i've never caught anything bigger than 12"" if that. but i'm still surprised nobody mentioned cradles. i guess that's because you'd have to lean too far to one side to keep the cradle in the water..."
216229,joco,2008-06-16 21:44:00,57,"ok.  i got a 36 incher and prob the last one in the 38 incher in the kayak..  and some pike. in my kayak.  yes there some danger..wit all speices..sometime the worst ones are the smalles ones wen they go bersurk...on you.  good tick gloves..is one hell off a good tools to have actualy dont have any proble,me to lip a pike or musky up to that size..36 incher...not at all..and this is very helpfull.  and those 36 incher dont guive any ride..just a bit more time to srwil around the kayak and sometime a couple time under..but no ride there....  people catsh sharks tarpons and tons off huge fish in kayaks..not a musky that size that will get a kayak flip..no way.   this is a great tread by the way.  mabe wen you start to get in the high 40's now you start talking about some issue in a kayak and get thos hooks out before you get him to close to you in the kayak for that pict...we have to think that fish is close to you in the kayak and you have no where to go..  .  keep those kayak/musky report to come.  here a 36 incher in a kayak/me  not mutch troble there a couple min and there it is.  people underestimate kayak...it is a fishing machine.  joco "

213712,Reef Runner,2008-06-10 18:15:00,981,"I find the grip that Raf demonstrated above would best apply to your situation.  It is pretty intimidating.  On a personal note, I caught a 35lbs to 40lbs out of the moon basin a couple years back in a canoe and was faced with the same situation you are envisioning.  In this instance, we just headed to shore, which was maybe 20 feet away, and got out and released her in knee deep water as I didn't want to risk flipping the canoe.  Would a cradle be too much in a yak?  I've never fished from a yak.  reefrunner"
213720,Pigeontroller,2008-06-10 18:22:00,2793," LOL! Singingdog has intentionally done that i'm sure! Not all his kayaking has been done on flat water!  I hate to discourage kayak-fishing, cause thats a great way to get on the water, but I'm not convinced a kayak is the best choice of craft for Muskie fishing. In a decent sized fishing boat with all the right gear to land and safely release a Muskie, It can still be a real trying experience!"
213721,snag,2008-06-10 18:23:00,1932,"I've caught a few musky and pike from both an inflatable and hard-shell kayak.       My 1st rule:  If you're close to shore/shallows; get out and land the fish safely.  I have not used a boca or net because I know that both will compromise the Kayaks balance (particularly with a big fish)  I would also recommend a sit-on-top kayak for better handling and safety.  Otherwise, (well, you already know this!) Have all the tools handy and try to release in-water. Yaks are so low to the water that I've found it easy. However, you are that much closer to the fish and if it freaks, you're both in danger. Painful danger. Netting isn't much of an option from a kayak. If the fish fights, let go. Try again.  Pictures are a luxury unless you have a good set-up like some experienced yak anglers have.(See: Jediangler).  Check out some of the Ocean fishing kayak sites."
213726,Reef Runner,2008-06-10 18:29:00,981,Very cool photos SNAG.
213732,snag,2008-06-10 18:37:00,1932," Thanks Reefer,  As I mentioned, I'm not equipped for the glory/money/happy-ending shot with fish in hand.  Perhaps this year I'll fix that.  I'm too much of a spaz that I'll drop the camera or drown myself."
213734,Musky or Specks,2008-06-10 18:39:00,2710,"Im suprised that no one has mentioned a gaff. Used properly they are an excellent tool for landing and releasing musky. In fact its my prefered method when catching them from a canoe. Fight the fish out bring it boatside slip the point of the gaff inside the mouth and there is a paper thin layer of tissue between the jawbone and the floor of the mouth. Slip the point through here lift just the fishes head out of the water and cut the hooks off with bolt cutters, slide the gaff back out and musky quickly swims away. Years ago I bought this wonderful gaff that closes and has three feet of rope lead here  pic of it    I cant remember the name of the manufacturer but it is awesome for using from a canoe and allows the musky to remain calm in the water while you prepare to remove the hooks and take a quick picture.  When the fish get huge its just time to pull over and handle it from shore  "
213766,ehg,2008-06-10 19:23:00,2666,"Nice going on being able to show others how to secure a by hand. Knowing this is most important for landing and removing hooks on musky.  Raf, this fish freaking in a net happened to me last year, this was the result      The post below by Musky and Specks absolutely sounds like the way to catch and secure muskies from a kayak. Great job Musky and Specks!   It's almost like Musky landing and hook removal 101, great replies"
213864,Raf,2008-06-10 22:12:00,3495,"that certainly does look nasty ehg.  often times, it's the little guys that get you.  they seem to have ""the rage"". or maybe you get a little complacant or a bit of both.  real important to have a good set of cutters on board (ie. knipex) when one hook is attached to you and the other to a POed fish.  i was just going to pop the hook out and water release, fish had other ideas and the trailer got me.   muskybill cut it in half and i pushed the rest through, operation took seconds and bill, always on the lookout for gore, was ready for the photo-op:      they say once an animal tastes human bloody they want more.. there's a killer growing in a lake in ontario."
213874,Sinker,2008-06-10 22:28:00,8692,"I always take an extra second with the little ones. I find the big ones are more lazy...the ""teenagers"" just flip out and go ape shiite on ya......be careful!!  I have a bud who took a bunch of stitches when a musky that was on a crankbait flipped out at boatside, got a hook in his arm just below his elbow.....and the fish took off.....ripping a gash almost to his wrist!!  I like my spinnerbaits with single hooks for that reason alone. If you get them, you've usually got them good, and its an easy release.  Sinker"
213884,lew,2008-06-10 22:57:00,12767,"Seeing as were talkin about war wounds  I was fish'n with Musky-Man one day and got a little 35""er, and as I lifted her into the boat, she did a flip and gashed my hand open to the tune of 8 stitches........gotta watch those dinks for sure.  Another time I was fishing with Chemong Rick who used to be on this board a few years back.  We'd only just met for the 1st time  about 30 minutes before I got this girl and she sliced my knuckle darned near to the bone with her teeth when she zigged instead of zagged and caught me off guard.  You can see the blood on my left hand and my pants, but the worst part was Rick had a  white floor in his boat and after I was done it looked more red than anything. I don't think I made too much of an impression with our 1st ever fish'n trip together  "
213896,Meely,2008-06-10 23:16:00,282,"I learned my lesson last summer. Dont ever take a Muskie's strength or predictability for granted !!  I had a buddy of mine come up and try for muskie with his son for 2 days. We weren't trolling more than 20 mins when he lands his first ever musky on a Believer. As I was bringing her into the boat ,I noticed she was hooked by the last set of trebles. I can still remember telling my buddy....""this is how we end up in the hospital""..... I get her into the boat and as I am trying to remove the hooks he leans over to see the chompers on the pretty girl. Right at that moment she thrashes and drives the middle set of hooks into his arm. Thank god I had a decent pair of pliers in the boat and managed to quickly cut the hook and dash to the hospital ( we got nice pics of the fish and released her...unharmed).  Anyhoo, since then....I have purchased extra long bent needle-nose pliers, a good pair of mini bolt cutters and a few packs of 5 odd trebles. Since this mis-hap, I no longer try to dig out hooks. I simply cut the hooks and replace the entire treble. It may cost a little more for the hooks but its well worth it NOT having to go to the hospital any more !!  I have never even had a close call since switching to this techinque.  Meely"
