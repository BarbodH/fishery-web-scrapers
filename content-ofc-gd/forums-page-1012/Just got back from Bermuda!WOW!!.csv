LOLFirst to the chair was myself then Teri  and MAtt, and then Teri's buddy(sorry dude i forgot  your name, enjoy the pics, i couldn't wait to share them!!                      "
216546,bassman,2008-06-17 18:22:00,384,great report.
216547,Joey,2008-06-17 18:23:00,9122,"Great report, that water is so blue, its gorgeous.  Huge fish man.  Way to go  One of these days I'd like to try that kind of fishing.  Joey"
216562,limeyangler,2008-06-17 19:09:00,5204,"awesome report, that looks so cool. Those wahoo look exactly like giant versions of an atlantic mackerel i used to catch back in the uk....bet they put up one hell of a fight ...cuz their smaller cousins are one of the hardest fighting fish i have experienced. Once again, great report...and like Joey said...that water looks sooooo nice and blue."
216564,pokerdemon4,2008-06-17 19:11:00,135,Great report.  I would love to try that some day.  You must of had a blast.
216567,Reef Runner,2008-06-17 19:13:00,981,Glorious Report.  Looks like an awsome time.
216577,johnnyb,2008-06-17 19:42:00,3413,Woohoo!! Nice Wahoo!  Thanks for posting
216594,Andy,2008-06-17 20:21:00,330,"Nicely done. I did that a couple of years ago, and seeing your photos reminds me of how hard those saltwater fish fight. Andy"
216599,Guest gbfisher,2008-06-17 20:25:00,0,"Nice fishn.Nice place.  That pink resort in your last picture looks like  ""The Reefs""."
216603,misfish,2008-06-17 20:39:00,29133,What do the waho taste like? Awesome report.
216617,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-17 21:14:00,0,Very Nice! How much did it run you? I gotta try salt water fishin one day!
216624,Rizzo,2008-06-17 21:35:00,4754,"outstanding! Gotta love those wahoo...and the speed of a fish like that is just ridiculous. Great report, hard to beat the fight of a saltwater fish (the ""wimps"" of the ocean even make smallmouth look weak)"
216681,Mike01,2008-06-18 01:01:00,378,"Wahoo are a hard fighting fish, I just love when they get all ""lit up"".  To bad you didn't get to see the marlin, there are some big ones that swim in the mid Atlantic!!"
