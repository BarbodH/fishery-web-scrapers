205267,Stoty,2008-05-23 12:13:00,2910,Since it was mentioned in the opening post....here she is again....  
205292,tdotfisherman,2008-05-23 13:28:00,317,Odd..  
205368,gone_fishin,2008-05-23 17:01:00,481, looks like we've got a 3-way tie now with Stoty in the mix!
205433,Fishnfiend,2008-05-23 20:03:00,357, Even holding up to the camera doesn't make it look big.  I had to call in the guy who is used to handling such small things...  
205603,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-24 04:02:00,0,What can I say ... it was not this minnow's day when I accidently hooked on it 
205616,limeyangler,2008-05-24 04:46:00,5204,wow...now that really is a (non) trophy too fishing for life...nice.  think we might have to have different species sections on here soon.
208499,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-30 05:18:00,0,Was mine the smallest fish?
216146,limeyangler,2008-06-16 17:22:00,5204,I threw my little jackfish outta the live well cuz i caught this upgrader fish!!!!   
216256,sash,2008-06-16 23:18:00,26,k here's mine no trophy but i like the pose  
204950,limeyangler,2008-05-22 20:00:00,5204,"Hi Everyone,  After seeing a couple of pics of tiny fish on CCMT's post requesting pics for a 'special project' (intriguing) i could not help remembering some of the little guys i caught, Stoty's tiny bass is very cool and just thought you guys must all have some not so Trophy pics...would be fun to see them. Here's a couple i have. One is a tiny Pike that really hammered a mepps spinner and one of my wife with a GIANT Walleye.           "
204967,Reef Runner,2008-05-22 20:44:00,981,"Lol.  I've caught some of them monsters before.  Man, I wish I had some pics to post but only got my digital camera this Christmas.  They'll be rolling in soon enough."
204978,bassjnkie,2008-05-22 21:05:00,1101,My personal worst pike ever.  
204982,tjsa,2008-05-22 21:12:00,1578,"Lake trout from this past winter, what was it thinking?? Lure is 3 inches long.  "
204985,ccmtcanada,2008-05-22 21:15:00,7971,"Yep....Tbayboy got a nice one with my HUGE catch...but believe it or not, it wasn't my smallest.  My season opener for 2007 was a good one, with me landing this monster perch.  My 5 year old and I had a competition on catching fish....I lost big time.  "
204999,limeyangler,2008-05-22 21:52:00,5204,"Great pics guys, MONSTERS!!!"
205003,oldphart,2008-05-22 21:57:00,665,"~~~Ain't caught it yet, the way my soft water phishen been, this is my largest "
205019,MoriaRiverMan,2008-05-22 22:43:00,314,This is my smallest fish yet   I WISH........Buddy caught that musky lastyear in the moria river
205024,gone_fishin,2008-05-22 22:57:00,481,"definitely not the smallest i've caught, but the smallest i have a picture of...  "
205033,Mike the Pike,2008-05-22 23:13:00,3421,          
205042,Uncle Buck,2008-05-22 23:22:00,1000,"Oh man, i'd kill to have 1 like this in the aquarium...  "

205091,Greencoachdog,2008-05-23 00:51:00,8163,"I just happen to be a ""baby fish"" magnet!        "
205128,BillM,2008-05-23 01:34:00,17367,My PB muskie....  
205177,limeyangler,2008-05-23 02:22:00,5204,"LOLOL...yup i think GB has it in the bag so far, love the way your still trying to lip hold it GB"
205188,Cudz,2008-05-23 02:34:00,2652,I can beat GB's fish as soon as I find the pic. I had a 2 inch smallmouth hold onto my worm and not let go until it was in the boat.  It was way smaller than my worm. I love teh sunfish slammin the husky jerks/x-raps.  I throw husky jerk 12s all the time on simcoe and catch tons of perch.  Too funny
205190,Musky or Specks,2008-05-23 02:38:00,2710,The whole expresion and pose of GB and his fish is priceless.
205192,Crazyhook,2008-05-23 02:43:00,1154,Used this guy for bait 2 weeks ago  
205200,nautifish,2008-05-23 02:50:00,1416,     
205212,Burning Babies,2008-05-23 03:27:00,150,
205237,Cudz,2008-05-23 10:20:00,2652,Ok this little smallmouth could just get his mouth over the worm.  Once he did so he couldn't let go.  Smallest fish I have ever actually caught on a rod and reel. 
205241,kickingfrog,2008-05-23 10:44:00,8333,"Now we are going to need a thread on the proper method to hold these minny monsters.  The tackle manufactures need to jump on this new niche market. I see miniature cradles and scales in grams.  I've always tried to hide these fish from the camera, now I see I should be regaling in them. Great shots guys and gals."
