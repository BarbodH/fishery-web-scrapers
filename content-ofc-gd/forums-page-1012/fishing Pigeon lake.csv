216294,Newfieman,2008-06-17 00:31:00,19,As I stated in my intro I have rented a cottage on Pigeon lake for the weekend with the family.  I have never fished the lake before and was wondering if anyone could give me some pointers what type of fish are there and some techniques and baits I could use to be successful in landing a few.  I'm not looking for personal hot spots just a little bit of guidance. much appreciated!  Newfieman

Lots of crappies too.....if you get one, there's usually more.  I like to use spinnerbaits for musky, white 3"" grubs for the eyes and crappies.  Let me know what area you'll be at and I can give you some areas to check out.  Sinker"

Sinker, I should meet up with you one time up there and we could head out together if you are up for it."
