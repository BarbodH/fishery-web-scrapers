215817,bbog,2008-06-15 22:06:00,665,"My fishing buddy and constant companion passed away suddenly and peacefully at home last Thursday. Fraser was a quirky gentle giant, misunderstood by some, loved by all. He will be greatly missed by all those that took the time to know him.  April 1, 1996 - June 12, 2008 (came into our lives February 7, 2004)  We will cherish his memory always.    ""If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever"""

216046,Joey,2008-06-16 14:02:00,9122,That is very sad news Barnie.  Very sorry for your loss.  It sounds like Fraser was a very much loved dog.  Joey
216052,bbog,2008-06-16 14:31:00,665,"Thanks to everyone for your kind words. Fraser came to us as a reclamation project. He arrived leaderless, lacking structure and frustrated with that and his lack of belonging. All these things were changed and he blossomed. Everything we gave to him he gave back to us a million times over.  We have started a memory book and it is filling fast. Fraser touched our lives in the most special way.  The support of the OFC Community is appreciated."
