216237,PatrickGG,2008-06-16 22:10:00,562,The food looks yummy and Happy Anniversary.
216253,solopaddler,2008-06-16 23:14:00,8605," Bought the canoe last June, used it maybe 6 times so far. (It'll get beat up soon enough  )."
216257,solopaddler,2008-06-16 23:21:00,8605," Actually I spent no time at all up there prior to purchasing and did zero research, LOL!  The story behind the purchase of the camp is long, strange and convoluted one, and involves a car accident and an outhouse  .  Bottom line, fate, sheer luck and a VERY understanding wife were the key components."
216291,sash,2008-06-17 00:23:00,26,"great report, like your back lake boat....has your wife tried wearing a bug jacket? helps on the warmer days also there is a product called thermacell a friend has one for hunting says it is amazing."
216303,Rich Clemens,2008-06-17 01:02:00,3131,"Awesome report Mike.  Looks like a great time, even for a long week-end.  Thanks for taking the time to post your report.   Enjoyed it."
216308,Moosebunk,2008-06-17 01:14:00,3970,"Hey Mike,  I've been talking with ya for about a year now I think.  What are we doing for our first anniversary man???  You better make it special with some fish and food.   Cool report.  That area up there looks just amazing to explore."
216311,solopaddler,2008-06-17 01:21:00,8605, I tried to think of a good reply to this....but I can't  .  (You know you're welcome anytime bud)
216327,scuro,2008-06-17 02:11:00,386,I went fishing with my wife once on our anniversary. We would have caught more fish if I hadn't of brought Champagne along.
216334,smbhunter,2008-06-17 02:28:00,186,That was an awesome report.   Happy anniversary.
216340,MJL,2008-06-17 02:39:00,2427,AMAZING report  Congrats on the anniversary.  Scenery is simply stunning and the amount of wildlife there is unbelievable.  Thanks for sharing.
216364,Tarzan's Jane,2008-06-17 08:07:00,1183,"I say you both were well over due....congrats on your anniversary.  Enjoyed your report and the pics, love the one of Joanne on the bed..haha"
216367,lew,2008-06-17 08:46:00,12767,"Thanks for the great tale Mike & congrats to the pair of you on your anniversary.  Whenever I see a long post from either you or Moosebunk I always leave them to read in the early morning hours with my coffee, they always make an excellent start to my day."
216454,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-17 14:42:00,2585,congrats and great report!!!  cheers!
216479,JFR,2008-06-17 15:29:00,498,"Great report, thank you for taking the time to share.  Congrats on the aniversary, nice get away.  Just JOHN"
216481,rickster,2008-06-17 15:37:00,495,Awesome report and congrats on the anniversary
216484,Spiel,2008-06-17 15:41:00,9065,....Perfect! But then you already knew that.
216112,solopaddler,2008-06-16 16:56:00,8605," You are a perceptive lad aren't you? LOL! Bunk beds do tend to get a wee bit ""cramped""  . (Plans are in store for a large bedroom addition which will house the double bed).  And yep, of course I'm carrying the boat myself. Balance my friend, balance, that's what it's all about. Back in my soloing days I routinely carried an 80lb pack along with my 17' canoe so I guess there is something to be said for latent fitness  .  Thanks everyone else"
216113,Roy,2008-06-16 16:57:00,13728,"I beautiful spot indeed, Mike. Congrats to you and Joanne on your anniversary."
216129,tbayboy,2008-06-16 17:06:00,1497,"Great report Mike, I can just imagine how much fun that back lake bay was.  Congratulations on the Anniversary as well."
216136,TennesseeGuy,2008-06-16 17:12:00,957,"Congratulations.  What a great way to celebrate a wedding anniversary.  I had the same thing in mind, sort of, but it doesn't work for #50.  Thanks for the report.  Yes, the walleye fishing looks great."
216139,Musky or Specks,2008-06-16 17:16:00,2710,Sounds like a great time. Good report and congrats on the anniversary.
216143,ccmtcanada,2008-06-16 17:20:00,7971,"Congrats on your anniversary and what looked like an amazing weekend to share with eachother (and all of OFC as well...LOL).  I used to be the buyer for chemicals at Canadian Tire....bought insect replellents.  I went to SC Johnson's lab in the US where they do the product testing off OFF and Deep Woods OFF.  Deet is the only thing that is proven to work.  I saw them test Avon's Skin so soft, citronella oil, geranium oil, ultrasonic decives etc....and the only thing that worked was deet.  Even those ""area"" control systems dont keep them away....they actually produce carbon dioxide...and that's what the mosquitoes head for.  Anyhow, I just chuckled when you said she put on her mosquito condiments.....hehe.  Looks like some great fishing there....wish I could read waters and a lake like you can!!  Live and learn...I'll keep going out there and hopefully get better at it.  Great report and pics as usual....it's nice to see you got away for the weekend as well....you love your kids, but sometimes getting away from them for a weekend is bliss!"
216161,jace,2008-06-16 18:08:00,472,  Hhah.  I laughed at that and another photo on the water where I'm guessing you got your name because you must be the only one paddling since she's sitting up in the bow and the other paddle is still strapped in under a cross-member.
216167,snag,2008-06-16 18:20:00,1932,You are one lucky man to have such a great wife!
216170,solopaddler,2008-06-16 18:22:00,8605, I can only hope Jo and I make it to 50 and are still doing the things we love to do. You sir are an inspiration.
216173,solopaddler,2008-06-16 18:29:00,8605," Truer words were never spoken, that's what I tried to tell her!! Who cares if it melts plastic and causes cancer in lab rats..at least you're not getting eaten alive!  Thanks for the kind words bud. You and Carole will have to make it up for a weekend at some point."
216177,solopaddler,2008-06-16 18:34:00,8605," Take a closer look at the pic's. I'm getting old and fat, there was a 2hp Honda strapped to the back  ."
216185,RangerGuy,2008-06-16 18:51:00,564,Great report! Man you and the wifie really put a hurt on those walleye LOL!  What a piece of paradise you found
216228,jediangler,2008-06-16 21:44:00,1923,"Great report and pics, and congrats on the anniversary. I remember when my Sportspal looked that new. How long have you had that one?"
216233,Sinker,2008-06-16 21:55:00,8692,"Incredible location to have a cabin. You must have spent some time researching that area, or you have spent some time up there previous to your purchase. I'm envious.......that is a great area!  Congrats on the anniversary, and thanks for a great report!!  Sinker"
