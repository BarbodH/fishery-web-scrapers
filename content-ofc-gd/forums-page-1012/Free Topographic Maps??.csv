155724,reelinrolly,2008-01-30 17:34:00,281,"Does anyone here know a site where you can get free topographic maps of lakes???  I am particularly interested in Lake Berndard, Little Doe Lake, and Nipissing!!  Thanks for any help!!"
155730,John Lutz,2008-01-30 17:41:00,6,"In my experience the one's Ive found are not worth the paper they're written on. Do yourself a favor and spend a few bucks, especially if you are boating! If you can't afford the actual Hydrographic maps then look into the Adventure Fishing Maps series, there not the best but they will keep you out of trouble for the most part. Just my thought's, I've practically tried them all.  Good Luck"
155736,reelinrolly,2008-01-30 17:47:00,281,"I mainly want them for ice fishing, just so I can pinpoint the best potential spots to start fishing.  Another problem is, I can't wait to have them delivered as I am leaving on my fishing trip on monday!"
155743,Nemo,2008-01-30 18:00:00,727,Look at this site.  http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo/map
155748,John Lutz,2008-01-30 18:07:00,6,"Try ontario fishing map project, type it in google. They have various lakes there and it is good for what you want. The only problem is there are not many lakes, don't know if the one's your interested in would be there. I have also search the Ministry of Natural resources and other gov sites and found info., good luck.  John"
155755,reelinrolly,2008-01-30 18:19:00,281,thanks for all your help guys!
155767,fishing,2008-01-30 19:00:00,167,Try this site for Lake Nipissing. May need to register to see more detailed map. http://www.anglersatlas.com/lakes/25456/
155806,brookieman,2008-01-30 21:16:00,68,"Even better than Toporama, figure out the index number of the map you need and download the appropriate map here:  http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/canmatrix/50k_300dpi/  These are actual full  size scans of the Ontario 1:50 000 topo maps.  The same ones that cost you $ 12 in the store.  Thank your tax dollars for this service."
155816,danc,2008-01-30 22:24:00,4677,Here's a free and pretty decent Canada topo map that will load in a Garmin GPS.  Ibycus Topo
155836,reelinrolly,2008-01-30 23:28:00,281, How do I go about figuring out which indes number I need??.....where do I find that info??
155843,walleyejigger,2008-01-30 23:56:00,876,"thanks DanC  wish i would have found that before i bought the set, but in hindsight it was a great investment, and worth  every penny, ( i got a really good deal)"
155849,danc,2008-01-31 00:07:00,4677," I just found this the other day myself. Topo detail is as good as Garmins topo Canada, but individual streets are not named, so there's the downfall. Not a bad map for free though."
216489,goodtimer,2008-06-17 15:58:00,53, Took me a while too but to find which number you need go HERE and zoom into the appropriate level to see the map number.  Kinda pointless cuz they're pretty much the exact same maps as the ones on the website.
216494,Reef Runner,2008-06-17 16:09:00,981,"I got the Ibycus for my Garmin unit.  Took 2 full days to download.  They are decent topographic maps IMHO.  That being said, I beleive what you are looking for is Hydrographic Maps, as opposed to topo.  So were are not showing you apples and you're asking for oranges, clarify what you are looking for.  By the way, I would be particularily interested if anyone can help this member with a Garmin Hydromap download"
216502,HTHM,2008-06-17 16:40:00,4082,"I just went here and it tried to give me a virus, good thing I have av software!"
216558,Zamboni,2008-06-17 18:48:00,235,"Goodtimer, pm'd you links to charts I've scanned-anyone else want them just ask. Don't post openly as I don't want copyright problems, just pm the links to each other."
216583,johnnyb,2008-06-17 19:48:00,3413,"I've had the local MNR office provide me with depth charts of area lakes...I don't know if they would have one for Nipissing, being so big, but, maybe those smaller ones. "
216598,goodtimer,2008-06-17 20:24:00,53,Zamboni - thank you thank you!  good man
