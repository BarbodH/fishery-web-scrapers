Thousands of kids stoked about catching perch, rock bass and the odd smallmouth from the rocks.  Everything looked like it got released.  Bouncy castles for the kids.  Free snow cones, cotton candy and hotdogs.  Clowns, magic, puppet shows.  Free worms fishing rods and reels.  The event is first class and it is great to see kids who have never fished before catch fish.  They love it. Big thumbs up to the Rotar Club (I even managed to catch 13 fish but nothign bigger than 8""  still fun though.)"
