216343,duber,2008-06-17 02:59:00,220,I was at the local CT and they had a couple racks of the new Rapala trolling combos.I looked at them and was suprised to see what looks like a decent combo for $135.99.Things always go on sale at CT so I'm sure they will come on cheaper in the future.  Anybody have or used one?  Looking for opinions before I buy one.  Thanks
