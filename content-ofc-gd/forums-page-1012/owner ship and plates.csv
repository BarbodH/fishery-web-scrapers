216156,babaganoush,2008-06-16 17:58:00,105,"i just recently bought a trailer and the owner had lost the ownership, he did write me a bill of sale claiming it was homemade. How difficult would it be to obtain a ownership and trailer plates"
216166,BillM,2008-06-16 18:18:00,17367,Simple.  Go to the MTO and pick one up   They can write you a new ownership and give you plates.
