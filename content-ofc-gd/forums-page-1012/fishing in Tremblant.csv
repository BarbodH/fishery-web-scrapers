I'll probably be doing some fly fishing in the Diable river and some lake fishing in lac ouimet but willing to try other spots.   I'm a real novice fly fisher so any tips on which section to fish or fly selection would be helpful. I recently had a daughter so my time on the water has been pretty limited so I can't wait for some one on one time with the fish!  Thanks  Dave."
