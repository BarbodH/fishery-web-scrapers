Maybe I was just spoiled with a little 9.9HP, but I find that the 40HP uses ALOT more fuel.  I used to troll all day with the 9.9, and use about 2 gallons.  Now, I am using the 40HP to get from spot, to spot.  Once there, I use the bow mount electric motor.  I used about 3 gallons in 1/2 a day and had to stop at a marina to gas up."
216168,yellowboat,2008-06-16 18:20:00,211,I'm still in the break in period for my 40hp and have used 3/4 a tank in 2 weekends.
216172,Roy,2008-06-16 18:25:00,13728,I have a 13 gal. internal tank on the Princecraft and the new 60HP 4 stroke and so far on 4 outings I've put in half a tank. Break-in is more expensive because of the constant change  in RPM that they recommend.
216182,fisher,2008-06-16 18:41:00,451,"Funny this post came up - I just got my 40 HP rebuilt and was told to go through 2 tanks of gas before it would be considered broken in.  Since I troll a lot on Lake Ontario I need the motor broken in before I can do that type of fishing with it.  So this weekend I went out and tried to waste as much gas as possible (to get through the 2 tanks) by criss/crossing Georgina Bay at various speeds.  After about 6 hours of this - stopping occassionally, I only managed to go through 1/2 a tank (about 10 litres).  I have 2 tanks on board - you should probably invest in a 2nd tank.  Less time refilling/and peace of mind by knowing there is less chance of running out."
216196,Nemo,2008-06-16 19:27:00,727,It took my 4 STroke 115 Merc till 50 hours before we saw the consumption drop. It was noticeable.
216204,Billy Bob,2008-06-16 20:06:00,5865,As many might know I have a 1985 50hp Johnson VRO outboard on my 16' Grumman. I am very satisfied with my mileage but of course more would always be better.  I have tracked my mileage for years using my odometer on my fish finder and here is what I get.  Cruising = 40-42 miles per 6 gallon can  Trolling = 30 miles per 6 gallon can  Since I have two 6 gallon tanks (portables) I have more than enough for any one day of fishing.  Only once when I use to compete in Walleye tournaments on Lake Erie did I have to tap the other tank and even then I was on my way in only about 2 miles from the harbor.
216235,Sinker,2008-06-16 22:00:00,8692,"I have no idea how many miles I get on a tank (portable) with my 40 2 stroke. I know I can fish all day long, and not have to worry about it though. My boat is prolly lighter though......less than 1000lbs anyways.  I can go to any kawartha lake, and fish from one end to the other, and still have gas in the tank. I find its quite good on gas.  I did a 32 mile run on simcoe one time, and burned just over 1/2 tank. I should really keep track, just for curiosity sake.  Sinker"
