216018,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-16 12:14:00,0,Sounds like a day well spent. Thanks for sharing.  I am not familiar with the area so cant help you in regards to species. I'll bump the post. Maybe somebody else will chime in.
216021,Beats,2008-06-16 12:24:00,543,perhaps you caught a bullhead.  Those things don't get big at all and if you find one there tends to be tonnes of them nearby.
216247,sash,2008-06-16 23:04:00,26,"i looked at some pics it was a catfish, forked tail and it did have specks on it,  as i floated past a guy on a lawnchair fishing i asked how his day was going and he replied nothing but cats...too bad the current pushed me by with only enought time for the 1 exchange.....i guess i could have paddled a bit to try to get some more info but that sounds too much like my other trips.....it was so nice to just float along."
