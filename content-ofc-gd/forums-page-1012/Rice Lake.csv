(Lost 2 more at the boat.)  Since we weren't familiar with the lake, we just starting trolling the main lake around any weed edges we could find in 8-12 fow.  Conditions were just about perfect, warm, overcast & a nice chop on the water.  All of the fish were caught from 8:30am to noon and then they seemed to shut down, so we dropped some jigs but only produced 2 smallies and a catfish.  Since this was our first crack at Rice Lake, we felt pretty good with the results.  (Thanks again to Smokey for helpfu boat ramp info.)"

216568,pokerdemon4,2008-06-17 19:14:00,135,You did great.  Tackling any body of water for the 1st time is a task at hand.  I bet they tasted great too.  Great report.

216652,conner420,2008-06-17 23:15:00,2,Great lake to fish off of. Thats one of my favorite lakes to fish. A good area that usually pans out decent walleye and bass is over by the tire swing. Also try hitting up the shore over by the train tracks. 2 seasons ago I hit a 4lbs Pickerel off the point. Amn was it good eats.
