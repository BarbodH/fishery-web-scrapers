215801,Clampet,2008-06-15 21:17:00,1947,Try and match Monkey Puke. It's deadly.
216184,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-16 18:46:00,3761,Monkey Puke?
216187,Musky or Specks,2008-06-16 18:58:00,2710,My favourite colour for just about any plastic is watermelon pepper. A darker green with black pepper flakes. I  use Yamamoto plastics exclusively.
216191,Roy,2008-06-16 19:08:00,13728,"Yeah Monkey Puke. It's a close shade to the ever popular ""Holy dyin' Bald headed Moses""."
216214,ozaibak1,2008-06-16 20:34:00,401,"Dark / watermelon green with shiny flecks (silver, gold, black, etc...) is DEADLY."
216223,jediangler,2008-06-16 21:32:00,1923,I depends on what you're trying to imitate. In the Grand river around here pumpkinseed seems to match the native crayfish.
216252,Zubris21,2008-06-16 23:13:00,563,The only tube I've used is the white YUM product.  Never caught anything on them!  I wouldn't buy white if I were you.  Stick towards something that looks like a crawfish.  Smoke/watermelon/green type thing is what I think would work.
216264,mikeh,2008-06-16 23:31:00,824,"pumkinseed/pepper with chartruse tail work pretty good for me, also watermelon/pepper  I have a large selection of tubes and these seem to be the colors I always put on."
216267,motv8tr,2008-06-16 23:34:00,2587,My go to is a Phenix grey with black flecks....  Maureen
216268,EC1,2008-06-16 23:40:00,930,"I actually am in love and have an affair with white plastics. They seem to work the best at night and seem to have produced the biggest fish compared to natural colours.  I have yet to try glow in the dark, but it seems quite interesting. Good Luck with whatever colour you end up choosing!"
216391,cthewrld,2008-06-17 12:01:00,99,"If the lake is relatively clear, I stick to any ""natural"" colour.  That could be green, pumpkin, black etc.  In muddy waters I tend to use bright colours.  One thing is for sure ,,,, it is a great way to catch bass."

216464,pokerdemon4,2008-06-17 14:55:00,135,Does berkley gulp make tubes?
216472,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-17 15:06:00,3761, I don't think so. Thats to bad they would work good i would think.  I think Berkly Powerbait does however.
216477,Marty,2008-06-17 15:21:00,873,I miss the Snoozer Roadkill Camo Garlic tube.  They went out of business but they did catch fish.    I haven't found one close.
216492,1leggedangler,2008-06-17 16:02:00,364,"I have used the Mizmo tubes in dark green with red fleck, deadly for smallmouth and largies. Try different weighted jig heads and keep contact with the bottom."
216509,goteeboy,2008-06-17 16:59:00,175,"it has to be motor oil color - a dark pukey green (olive) Yum, w/ the rings on it."
216566,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-17 19:13:00,3761,"Thanks for the info guys, i ended up getting a green pack and a solid white pack with silver flakes. Now all i need are some more jigs for them."
