OFC should run faster in about 24 hours! lol  It's time to take my sweetheart to God's country! I'll try to check in from time to time. Those that have it... use it... the number that is.  Doesn't look like we'll make Lakair at this point. Kevin couldn't do anything for us it appears...but we may drop in and bum a boat spot on the Saturday if anyone will have us aboard.  Cheers, Wayne"
