Thousands dead, and more to come.. during the middle of the day.. 6 schools collapsed full of children..  It is with a sad heart that I hope all you're family are safe and well.  Gerritt."

200697,Rich Clemens,2008-05-12 22:31:00,3131,Great post Garritt.    Prayers to all our OFC brothers and sisters with family and friends in China.  Terrible tradegy and hopes that survivors will be found in those collapsed buildings.  Just can't imagine anything like that and what those directly impacted must be feeling.  My prayers to all of them.
200700,splashhopper,2008-05-12 22:34:00,2931,"reminds me of my favourite prayer:  Lord, make me a channel of thy peace-- that where there is hatred, I may bring love-- that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness-- that where there is discord, I may bring harmony-- that where there is error, I may bring truth-- that where there is doubt, I may bring faith-- that where there is despair, I may bring hope-- that where there are shadows, I may bring light-- that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.  Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted-- to understand, than to be understood-- to love, than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.  Amen."
