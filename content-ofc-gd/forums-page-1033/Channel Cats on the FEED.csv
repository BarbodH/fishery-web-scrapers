200235,Rich,2008-05-12 01:28:00,3927," Tran has a fishing license, he just works 80 hrs a week and runs a hotel on the side, he has no time. Fun guy to fish with when he does get a spare moment though. Those cats will last him all year and he was very appreciative. Even said he'd spare some wild turkey meat next time he hunts."
200240,Rich,2008-05-12 01:33:00,3927,"Cats were caught on chunks of sucker meat BTW and hit from 9PM til 1AM.  Don't worry, no white buckets will be on the site for a long time under his other screen name. Bold statements from an anonymous conservationist, how brave!"
200242,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 01:33:00,7971, Sooooo.....he's gonna give you some turkey meat?  I sure hope you have a hunting license or someone will be all over your morals....LOL.  You didn't need to justify yourself Rich....just keep on hauling them in as you see fit!  You know the regs and I know you respect them.
200243,Daplumma,2008-05-12 01:33:00,1961,"See you around NWB...your time is limited here.See you on your regular name unless Rick figures out what that name is,then we may not see you again. Joe"
200255,oxcowboy,2008-05-12 01:43:00,544,"i too am guilty several times over of the raping of ontario's waterways, each year i bring home 6 pike and a couple of walleye and a few small mouth bass.  you sure do have some high fish prices, i figure those 12 fish cost me about 1200 dollars.  every campsite i have stayed at is far better when i leave than when i got there. plus i also gifted a stringer full of catfish to a couple down the road from me,  shame on me i guess, but i figured that was the least i could do since they let me access the creek from their farm and the lady is legally blind and her husband has battled cancer more than once in his life.  maybe i should rethink my morals and tell the old fella to get of his sick ass and catch his own if he wants a meal.  what a joke, they have done nothing wrong!  good report fellas  jason"
200257,fishindevil,2008-05-12 01:45:00,6254,"Another P3TA member in disguise !!!!!.....well theres lots of other fishing sites that would be glad to have you...and this isnt one of them,so please be on your way anytime now !!!!"

200336,chickenhawk,2008-05-12 03:56:00,612,hahahahahahaha......good try though!  Hawk
200340,scuro,2008-05-12 04:03:00,386,"  The only question that came to my mind when reading this thread was: was Sleded drinking before this picture was taken? Another question I like to know the answer to is how ""sleded"" got his nickname. Did alcohol play a part in the germination of this moniker?"
200414,aniceguy,2008-05-12 12:30:00,1094,anyone got some cajun spice mix...blackened catfish mmmmm.....mmmmmm....mmmmmmm caught the fish....gave them away.....got some turkey......whats the fuss about..  Wayne but can you build a mentos rocket...thats the question  that would be a funny one
200461,Rich,2008-05-12 13:19:00,3927," Actually no, it was an alcohol free night surprisingly! LOL  And his name came from that crazy snowmobile dude they call Sled Ed. This Sleded of course, is nowhere near crazy, and would probably run and cry were he to run across any sort of obstacle while snowmobiling."
200553,LeXXington,2008-05-12 16:45:00,1928,"Great catch Rich,  Hope one of these days I can get out fishing with ya"
200570,highdrifter,2008-05-12 17:34:00,2534,"NICE NASTY, SMELLY HAUL BRO!!  HD"
200596,fishinggeek,2008-05-12 18:51:00,325,Thanks for the sweet report.  Looks like a lot of fun.  I got to try that.  Fishing those weird hours must be worth it.
200597,Jen,2008-05-12 18:53:00,833,"Awesome catch guys, now I know why you were in such a rush to leave the Marina... Hope to see you again!  WOW...  Cheers  Jen (Bernadette)"
200631,redfin,2008-05-12 20:09:00,79,"Nice haul Rich, must be fun to catching all these big cats.  The pix remind me an episode of “Dirty Jobs” on Discovery.  Who is cleaning all these fish???"
199768,Rich,2008-05-11 03:00:00,3927,"We got into a bunch last night, just an awesome night. Like the old days! Neither of us really keep more than one cat a year. However, these fish weren't kept for us, Sleded had a friend from work who said he'd take whatever we could get him. Guess he was happy to see our haul! After dragging that stringer around with that much weight, we both agreed Mr. Tran can catch his own fish next time. LOL      "
199774,danbo,2008-05-11 03:08:00,2646,
199876,Greencoachdog,2008-05-11 14:46:00,8163,Take a dishrag and clean those fish up!!!... you know how I hate nastiness!!!  
199935,steverowbotham,2008-05-11 18:02:00,1800,god they're ugly.  Nice fish though
199946,Roy,2008-05-11 18:29:00,13728,Thanks for the report. You guys did good. It really would be a good idea to swish them around in the water once or twice to get the crap off of them though.
199987,bassfighter,2008-05-11 20:05:00,366,"Wow, those catfich are big.  We used to eat other smaller similar catfish species farm fed nothing over a lb, and they taste good. However, seeing the way they were presented from your picture . I will only eat them if there is a war and a food shortage.  Maybe those leaves are Basil leaves and some black pepper used to marinade them with! Can't tell from the picture."
199991,JEREMY,2008-05-11 20:10:00,300,Good stuff boys.
199993,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-11 20:13:00,0,WOW! Nice Haul. And thats a pretty big bullhead too! Must have been a lot of fun to catch!
200039,mattyk,2008-05-11 21:43:00,2110,some nice lookin cats!
200044,irishfield,2008-05-11 21:52:00,26272,Nowhitebucket... they're actually 5 fish away from ONE persons limit with a sports licence. Rich and Sleded could have had 24 fish on that tail gate to do what they chose with.  Yes.. you can give your fish to anyone..and they don't even need a fishing license to possess them.  No... they can't be fined for anything they've done and you really need to sit down and read the regs if you think otherwise. Hell if you're so concerned call the MNR yourself to get them charged.  Rich/Sleded... can you fish for something a little prettier next time though?
200051,spinnerdoc,2008-05-11 22:01:00,556,hey what kind of bait and time did you guys catch these giants?
200063,spinnerdoc,2008-05-11 22:21:00,556,"no whitebucket .....you ought to read your regulations and not just read but to really understand them, so  you don't go on accusing people of any wrong doing falsely.  make sure it's the 2008 to be sure your reading the right one, see page 7 under catch and possesion limits. the statement fishing ain't what it used to be can be because of a lot of diff. reasons, not just due to over fishing. i think most of it is due to climate change but hey that's my take on it."
200078,Nemo,2008-05-11 22:48:00,727,Hey Boys nice fish looks like you caught them with the lawnmower....  Just Kidding bet they tasted great.
200084,Greencoachdog,2008-05-11 22:57:00,8163, M  O!!!!
200119,spinnerdoc,2008-05-11 23:29:00,556,"a little back pedalling there nowhitebucket, you had to throw the ""moral issue"". i am by no means a supporter of over fishing, in fact i practice catch and release, but why are you so mad at mr tran? sure over harvesting can destroy a population, but i don't think the weekend angler is taking all of it, those who  do ought to be punished. these guys maybe, were just being nice to mr tran, ok here's some. climate change is not just bec it's not cold enough or warm enough, it's the whole damn ecosystem. just last year i was at my river that i've been fishing for years, water levels have been at the lowest the same as other places. your looking at it at a very narrow scope, the fact of the matter is we all play a role in this.people are too used to the comfort that making a simple lifestyle change is so hard. so you go ahead and cast the first stone if you haven't played a part in it."
200129,fish_finder,2008-05-11 23:32:00,370," Over fishing and over harvesting are nothing new.  I'm sure you know that??!!??  What these fellas have done is well within their rights.  You'd prefer to see a pile of fish purchased at a store????  Well......news for you buddy......do a little research on over harvesting of fish in the places you don't or can't fish, such as commercial operations.......and have a little read about some fish farming........both completely obliterate countless populations each year.  Regardless of anything......there are more and more humans every day, and less and less fish every day........fact of life!!!  Unavoidable!  Congrats on the catch Rich........you should probably keep one for yourself and make some black cats on the BBQ!!!!  Tasty waisty man!!"
200137,Greencoachdog,2008-05-11 23:41:00,8163,  Anyone takin' bets on how long this Scungilli will last around here?
200148,Greencoachdog,2008-05-11 23:55:00,8163,  OMG!!! NWB is CC in disguise!!!   No offense to the real CC please!
200159,Greencoachdog,2008-05-12 00:00:00,8163,  I learned a looooong time ago (back in my youth... musta been 5 or 6 yrs. ago) that it's far better to keep your mouth shut and let people assume you're stupid... than to open it and confirm their suspicions!
200178,Greencoachdog,2008-05-12 00:35:00,8163,  Most of the stupid things I post are quotes from Idjit Galoots... like you!!!   ... shouldn't you be studying the regs so you don't embarrass yourself again?
200206,irishfield,2008-05-12 01:05:00,26272,Nah.. Glen was smart.. he took back a good Canadian Women for that !  Oh.. and before you beat on my post count... I can build a rocket !

200220,Daplumma,2008-05-12 01:18:00,1961,I dont think GCD has ever taken a fish home from Canada yet in the last few years I have fished with him.I also know that the resources in the lower 48 are not so raped as you think.I have seen more than a few postst from my northern brothers enjoying the largemouth and striper fishing down here.For the same reasons I enjoy catching(and releasing)Esox from the north.I would like to know what your usual handle is here and why you are posting under an alias.Rich has had guys crawl out from under the rocks to bash him before and I suspect you are one of them.Nice cats Rich and dont worry about depleteing them in many of our lifetimes.They are survivors....like cockroaches you can eat! Joe
200232,steverowbotham,2008-05-12 01:27:00,1800,"NWB you sir, are a fool.  an absolute fool"
200234,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 01:28:00,7971,So lemme get this straight....the limit for the two of them is 24 and they took home 7?  Wow...talk about over harvesting a species who's numbers aren't even endangered.  I feel bad for taking home 2 perch my 6 year old caught today for a fish fry.  On the other side...  WOOHOO!!!! Great job guys...that's quite the night you guys had out there.  I'd love to get out to a real catfish spot like that and catch my limit!
