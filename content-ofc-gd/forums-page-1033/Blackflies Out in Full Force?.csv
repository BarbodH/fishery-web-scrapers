200602,Basskicker,2008-05-12 19:16:00,421,"I plan on spending the long weekend tent camping just north of Kaladar/Cloyne area fishing with 4 friends who don't exactly like the bugs or fishing (my sister), so it should be rather interesting. Does anyone know how bad the blackflies are this year so far? Thanks  Jason"
200604,Sinker,2008-05-12 19:17:00,8692,"They were out this morning in full force!! Bring head nets if you don't like them, or they'll drive you NUTS!!  Sinker"
200610,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 19:23:00,7971,"Hey Jason,  The closest bug forecast I could find was for Bancroft, and they are saying ""high"" for pretty much every day.....  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/bugreport/CAON0039  Cliff"
200612,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-12 19:26:00,1362,"I was trout fishin' yesterday in the back lakes and as soon as the day started to warm up they were out...there wasn't alot of wind so they were swarming around me in the boat...I wouldn't say that they are in full force yet, but this weekend will be a treat for anyone camping to say the least!!...."
200616,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-12 19:33:00,241,Drats! I'm heading north on Wednesday to camp/fish for long weekend. Hope they aren't too bad...
200618,Sinker,2008-05-12 19:41:00,8692," They'll be bad!  Find a site with lots of wind, and you'll be better off.  Sinker"
200622,Basskicker,2008-05-12 19:48:00,421,That doesn't sound good.....I'm not telling my sister
200624,cthewrld,2008-05-12 19:54:00,99,Baysville & Huntsville area both had black flies out in large numbers over the last several days.
200627,Stoty,2008-05-12 20:01:00,2910,"Just get one of these, and you will be fine! Not to mention less noticeable to the fish!   "
200646,FinS,2008-05-12 21:00:00,463,from what i hear the bugs are getting there just be prepared 1 trick is to wear light coloured clothing and use something with alot of deet
200683,Garry2Rs,2008-05-12 22:14:00,1425,"I'm 45 km. so0uth of Bancroft.  The Black Flies are out, but they're not bad yet.  I was sitting in the driveway working on the boat.  Every so often one would sneak up and bite me.  There were no swarms etc."
200737,darsky,2008-05-12 23:19:00,586,cut strips of bounce sheets and spread around body............wonders
200766,Mike01,2008-05-12 23:46:00,378,havn't seen any in the North Bay area yet.  Its been cool for the last week but it is starting to warm up.  I suspect they will be out and about by the weekend
200774,Basskicker,2008-05-12 23:56:00,421,"Hey Darsky, that's the first I've heard of using bounce sheets.....does it really work well?  I usually attach (tape) a mosquito coil with metal attachment  to my baseball hat.  Burnt a couple of hats over the years.....but most bugs stay FAR away.....hehehehe.  Jason"
200776,Greencoachdog,2008-05-13 00:00:00,8163,The best way to keep the Back Flies out of your face is to tear a hole in the seat of your pants!
200778,Cookslav,2008-05-13 00:05:00,1457,"Didn't see a single one in Algonquin on the 1st weekend of May, but yesterday I was up at Belwood lake and got Swarmed big time but.... They were not biting just yet. My guess is they will be on the feed this weekend."
200831,Beans,2008-05-13 01:09:00,3339,If you had seen the welts on my arms over the past weekend you wouldn't have had to ask...seems the first bites of the year cause my immune system to produce some anti-histamine as yesterdays bites did not swell up as much...lots of calamine lotion helps take out some of the itch...  BTW...TJ sells a great bug jacket
200939,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-13 10:05:00,1362," Hey Glen...thanks for making me cover my monitor with coffee this morning  If you don't want to be covered with DEET all weekend, take a bundle of garlic bulbs with you!!..you have to peel the garlic and then cut the clove in half so that the oil comes out...rub it all over you and you'll be amazed at the results  you'll have no bugs around you as well as the girlfriend, fishing buds and people fishing your secret hole"
201090,Hookset,2008-05-13 15:53:00,367,"Between Bracebridge and Huntsville last night they were brutal. Nothing thru the day - then crazy in the evening - and gone at full dark. They usually will get worse before they get better.  I will second the ""bounce sheet"" method tho'. But I still prefer Deet. You gotta die of something right ? lol.  Hookset."
201093,Stoty,2008-05-13 15:54:00,2910,"Bounce sheets really work?!?!?  Just throw them in your pockets, under your hat etc?"
201097,Hookset,2008-05-13 16:01:00,367,"You got it Stoty.  I tape a sheet inside my hat and leave as much hanging out the back as possible to protect my neck. Then take a second sheet and rub it all over any exposed areas. I have put them in the tops of my socks to keep them away from there too. It did seem to work pretty good, and the girlfriend said I smelled like I just fell outta the dryer. Instead of the usual fish slime smell. Hey maybe it's the new fisherman's aphrodesiac ? Worked for me !!!  Hookset."
201130,GBW,2008-05-13 17:15:00,8460,that's great to know about the Bounce sheets.  did you know that they also work great at getting the dead bug's off the front of your car/truck/van/suv/camper/boat?  yes it works wonders and dosen't scratch.  just get it moist and your good to go...
