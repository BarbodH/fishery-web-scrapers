I look forward to contributing to the board in the future.  I have attached a link below of a video I created from a fishing weekend I go to every year with some guys at work.  Its pretty cool.    http://my.break.com/content/view.aspx?ContentID=496339"

201034,shane,2008-05-13 14:17:00,652,Welcome aboard.  Cool video.  I've had that happen too but the second fish didn't cooperate enough to actually hook himself.  Just attacked the lure floating on the water.
