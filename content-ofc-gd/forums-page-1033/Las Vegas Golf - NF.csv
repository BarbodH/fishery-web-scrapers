198018,Carp,2008-05-07 16:30:00,1488,"I'm not a golfer, but a friend of mine goes every fall specifically for the golfing and stays 10 days @ Wynn Hotel & Casino. I believe that hotel has it's own golf course. That's about all the info I have. Sorry I couldn't be more help. Maybe call the hotel you're staying at and ask where the guests like to play golf.  Have a good trip."
198104,da9r,2008-05-07 19:43:00,1,"Las Vegas National... i golfed there 2 years ago when i was there for a stag .. great course and an easy cab ride off the strip.  pretty reasonable for Vegas golf.. you can get a noon tee off, it's usually cheaper (or was it less busy) than the earlier morning (cause if gets fricken hot by noon)"
198133,JohnF,2008-05-07 20:50:00,3494," You want challenging, sexy or cheap? My son (CPGA pro) plays there occasionally and might have some suggestions.  JF"
198139,silveradosheriff,2008-05-07 20:58:00,1025, Thanks -it looks like a nice track!      Semi   Oh ya.   <$200 a round  :-)
198531,JohnF,2008-05-08 12:59:00,3494, So you want a 7500 yd track with topless caddies for under 200 bux? I'll check with Matt today.  JF
198542,cthewrld,2008-05-08 13:15:00,99,"I can tell you one place not to play ....... Royal Links.  I played there a few years ago and found it to be nothing special, hard to get to and way too expensive.  I played the course at the Wynn hotel a few years ago as well and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is practically on the strip and it is a good track."
198555,silveradosheriff,2008-05-08 13:37:00,1025," Well, the 7500 yds is a bit short, but I'm good with the caddy part...."

201067,JohnF,2008-05-13 15:17:00,3494,"Just in case this isn't too late, Matt recommends-  Wolf Creek at Mesquite (45 mins north) is not to be missed - also in that area Oasis  In Henderson find Reflection Bay (may be private). It's the Three Tour Challenge tournament course.  Closer to LV look for Paiute (Pete Dye course)  He says LV courses generally are disappointing.  Hit 'em straight.  JF"
