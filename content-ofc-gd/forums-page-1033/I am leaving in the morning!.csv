200561,Roy,2008-05-12 17:09:00,13728,Enjoyed having you here Hawk. That looks like a really nice place to spend the soft water season. You stay safe up there.  ps. Try to keep a journal of your time up there it'll make writing the report much easier for you.
200569,chickenhawk,2008-05-12 17:29:00,612,Thanks for the idea Roy! I will for sure keep a journal....can't wait to share my experience with you all!
