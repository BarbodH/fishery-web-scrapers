200122,danc,2008-05-11 23:29:00,4677,"I've been trying all day to renew my outdoors card with my fishing and hunting license without success. I get to the first page, fill in my info, then it times out. Has anyone successfully used this service lately? I was at Canadian Tire today, but since my outdoors card is now expired, they will only sell me a fishing license. They said that I must go through the MNR to get my hunting license. So the on line renewal is my best option, if it works. Also, I can print out a temporary license with the on line form and I'm good to go immediately."
200133,DanTheMan,2008-05-11 23:35:00,257,Huh?  You can apply for a new card a local stores if you hunt??
200136,fish_finder,2008-05-11 23:41:00,370,Maybe its bugs in their new website........shoot em an email and see what happens!!
200145,Greencoachdog,2008-05-11 23:48:00,8163,"Hunting is sooo overrated, stick with fishing 12 mo. a year and you'll be much better off!!!   ... then you won't have to worry aboot you or somebody else accidently blowing your   off."
200160,Guidofisherman,2008-05-12 00:03:00,206,"Hi Dan: Possibly they just caught up to your fishing reputation. Ha...Ha. Actually, I did mine online a couple of months ago and it worked fine. Did you enter their site under the link as a ""new"" or ""re-newing"" card owner. That's where my daughter had trouble with hers. I have your RAP book on the Nipigon. Great read. Give me a PM so I can get it back to you. Alan"
200164,danc,2008-05-12 00:12:00,4677,"I'm at the renew page Al. It asks for my old card # and date of birth. I enter the info, click on the next step and it just hangs there. On second thought, I'm getting so old that maybe my date of birth isn't recognizable. I'll try again tomorrow.  You heading out next weekend? Colin and I are making plans, but the ice situation isn't looking good. Unless we hit the spot where the fish are said to be biting. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about..  Talk to you soon."
200167,Nemo,2008-05-12 00:20:00,727,I used it the other day and it was fine. Maybe they are doing maintenance on the server/portal. I would just wait till tomorrow and sign on again.  Nemo
200169,danc,2008-05-12 00:24:00,4677,Thanks Nemo. I'll try again tomorrow.
200290,John Bacon,2008-05-12 02:32:00,3277,"It worked for my me on Friday, my card is fishing only, not sure if that makes a difference.  I did have to hit the ""try again"" button a couple of times.  But that was before I got as far as you did."
200876,Guidofisherman,2008-05-13 02:18:00,206,"Dan: I won't be going out next weekend as I am opening up the camp and have a project on. Good luck to you and Colin. I checked a recent satellite photo of the area and it looks iced in still. Too bad the old landing wasn't still open. Have a evening 'wobbly pop' for me. I will have to show both of you my book I wrote on ...guess what... ""Nipigon Brook Trout"". Alan"
200877,danc,2008-05-13 02:22:00,4677,"Sounds good Al. I'll see you at the lake some time this year I'm sure.  By the way, I renewed my license on line this morning, no problems."
