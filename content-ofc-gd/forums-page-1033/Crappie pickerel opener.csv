199846,Jer,2008-05-11 12:46:00,1426,"Like what seemed most boats on Buckhorn yesterday, we gave up on the pickerel bite early and decided to see if the crappie might be a bit more cooperative.  They certainly were...3 or 4 different spots throughout the day and we caught countless numbers and lotsa keepers for a fish fry.  This was probably the best of the bunch...   What a beauty day...   I'm sure some people did well for pickerel on the Tri-Lakes, but we just don't seem to have the patience...especially with so many tasty crappie to be had..."

200463,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-12 13:21:00,0, Thanks. Maybe I'll give it a try. Last time I was there and we finally decided to target them(This was in June)? We had a mishap and had to leave the lake early!
