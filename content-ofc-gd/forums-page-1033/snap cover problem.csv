198687,bow slayer,2008-05-08 15:42:00,1074,what should I use to lube the snaps on my boat cover. I just took the cover off for the first time and some of the  snaps were dam near impossible to snap off. I was thinking using lithium white grease. thanks
198713,lew,2008-05-08 16:30:00,12767,A little dab of vaseline on each tab and your good to go for the whole summer.  You'll be surprised what a difference it'll make.

198741,Fishn Technishn,2008-05-08 17:29:00,198,You can also get a little gadget for popping the snap  off. I think either BPS or Cabelas has it. The vaseline does work. One person told me to use Chapstick or similar for the domes & zippers on my cover. Easy to store and you can use it in case you get chapped lips!! Not sure which flavour would work best LOL   FT
