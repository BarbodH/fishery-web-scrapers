Leaving Friday morning and comming bacl Monday. What species are there in the river and what is in season there? I have a 12' car topper and was wondering if I should take it. Any lakes around the area?  Thanks guys,  Curt"

There are a number of small lakes in the area but only 2 I know of with a launch/public access, Bells Lake northwest of Markdale and Wilcox lake southwest of Flesherton  Both are on paved 'back' roads and a Grey/Brucemap should give the exact location.  As for fish I haven't fished in either Hope this helps  jjcanoe"

Fishing is hit and miss, but they are there. To bad Bass isn't open though... There are a TON of Bass right in the lake area of the Park.(lower lake..not the swimming hole) Most are small, but if your son is Young its a great spot to smash into a bunch of Rock Bass, and Smaller Smallmouth. But there are bigger ones to be found as well...I've caught them up to 18"" in there.  But the Speck trout can be found in the River, as well as the Lake, but Like I said....its hit and miss. If you have a fly rod you'll want to walk the river.  Good luck"
