200657,Muskieman,2008-05-12 21:13:00,2472,  Water level is receding  ... Silver isn't here yet  Sent you a P.M

200680,Muskieman,2008-05-12 22:11:00,2472,Naw ... Can't do it decided to keep the 14' instead of upgrading to 16' or 18' and buying a Camper Trailer instead ... will be more useful for the family and I  and is not motorized ... I will cost a little more to tow it camping but will be REALLY REALLY good on gas while parked.  The upgrade would've meant more $$$ spent for gas....  Here is the model I'm looking at  Jayco model Baja.... New it costs 12000.00$ I can get one that's 2 yrs old for 7550.00$   Off roadable tent trailer... lightweight will be good for towing ... I will be doing it train style.
200685,misfish,2008-05-12 22:16:00,29133,Cool thanks for the reply. Nice looking camper. Have a great summer.
200850,HTHM,2008-05-13 01:32:00,4082,Make sure you have commercial plates on the tow vehicle.
