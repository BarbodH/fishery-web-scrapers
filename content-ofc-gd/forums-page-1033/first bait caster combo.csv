200227,bigbuck,2008-05-12 01:24:00,2449,"Go 7 feet. If they don't have one put together, ask them to do it for you. Med/hvy would be a great general purpose rod for you."
200229,HTHM,2008-05-12 01:26:00,4082,What he said!
200236,steverowbotham,2008-05-12 01:29:00,1800,Good combo.  I work at BPS so look for me if you come in to purchase it.  I work til 2pm on weekdays.
200452,Garry2Rs,2008-05-12 13:06:00,1425,"That's sounds like a decent starting outfit.  If you can get a 6'6"" rod great if not don't worry about it. Only a few years ago a six foot bait-caster was the standard length and 5'6"" was common... My 25 year old Skeeter's rod locker wouldn't hold a rod over 6 feet long! This fetish with rod length is just a fashion thing, as boats have become bigger, rods have become longer.   What's the real difference? The rule of thumb is that shorter rods are more accurate, longer rods will cast a little farther... But remember that is not just farther from you, but also a little farther away from the target too!  Before we assume that bigger is better, let's be clear on want we're talking about here. A 6'6"" or 7' rod may throw a bait an extra 4 to 6 feet...that's only the difference of a couple of steps and we're talking about this 6 feet on the end of a cast of 60 or 70 feet.  If you are just learning, any difference in the length of your casts is a moot point.  You'll just be pleased if there's no backlash...HAHAHA.  On the water, you will probably be casting to a target like that open spot in the lily-pads, the edge of the weed line or the trunk of a fallen tree most of the time.  I suspect that most of my casts are to a target that's in the forty foot range.  If that's true, I would think that accuracy is far more important that an extra few feet of potential maximum distance...  I suspect that most people would like accuracy on every cast, but only need extra distance on a few... Therefore, it could be argued that the inherent loss of accuracy built into the longer rod is a bigger penalty, than the few feet in maximum distance the shorter rod gives up. Garry2R's"
