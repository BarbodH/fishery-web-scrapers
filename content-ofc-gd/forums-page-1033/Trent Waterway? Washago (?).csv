200972,ccmtcanada,2008-05-13 11:36:00,7971,I pass thru Washago on the way up to the Parry Sound area.  It's right at the north end of Lake Couchiching....some good fishing there!  I also have a few friends that moved there from the Toronto area and they love it.  Casino Rama is close by as well.  Here's a few links for you.... http://www.washago.ca/main.html  http://www.washagocruiselines.com/
