200432,RangerGuy,2008-05-12 12:49:00,564,"Well,  Me and my pooch went to Quinte Saturday. Launched at 6:15am.... I was surprised that nobody was at the ramp. Not very many boats out at all. I started the day by tearing my transducer cable in 1/2 launching the boat on a piece of wood that I thought was floating in the water. So I was fishing blind all day.  Not much cloud cover or wind all day but still managed 5 fish 12,18,20,24,27 inches.. Funny each fish came from a different spot. I could not find more than one fish in each area LOL! I think maybe I wasn't fishing shallow enough these fish all came in 20 to 35' range.  So they weren't jumping in the boat but I've only fished Quinte a handfull of times so I'm please"
200441,Smokey,2008-05-12 12:57:00,1278,Sounds like a pretty good day on the water. Congrats but too bad about the transducer cable.
200446,Zubris21,2008-05-12 13:00:00,563,"I was at Quinte fri,sat, and sunday.  The fishing was pretty slow for the most part.  We only caught 16 for the trip between 4 of us, so sounds like you did pretty well!   Most of our fish were from the 20-25 foot range as well though.   A couple early morning eyes were a feeding off a hump at around 14 feet but that bite died pretty quick."
200456,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-12 13:11:00,0,Too bad about the transducer but I guess it could have been worse. At least you caught some fish. Thanks for the report.
200459,RangerGuy,2008-05-12 13:15:00,564,"Thanks guys,  I haven't made a fishing post in a long time. It's good to be back  Lots of new faces here LOL!   I forgot to mention that my new 24 volt Terrova was just awesome! I used it all day basically anytime I trolled Saturday.. it moves my boat at 3mph at full speed. I was trolling with it between .5 - 1.5 mph and for positioning while casting . It only used 1 bar out of 4 on the battery meter  AMAZING!."
200481,RangerGuy,2008-05-12 14:09:00,564,Some photos from Saturday I just got from my buddy.  My Fishing Partner Suzy.   Suzy watching a fish.    One of the fish I got Saturday.. this one had great color. 
200551,HTHM,2008-05-12 16:42:00,4082,"So how much would your old, (my new) motor have used?"
200555,LeXXington,2008-05-12 16:48:00,1928,"Great pics  Man and his dog,, Nothing better than that fishing"
200557,fishindevil,2008-05-12 16:52:00,6254,"Hey man you did well ,you still put some nice eyes in the boat !!!! too bad about the transducer...cheers"
200559,RangerGuy,2008-05-12 17:03:00,564,"The old motor for general purpose casting positioning for a long day would probably use 1/2 my battery power but if I try to troll with it all day ""constant on"" like I did Saturday I'd have to charge them up Saturday night if I planned on fishing all Sunday."
200628,Big Mongo,2008-05-12 20:04:00,1,"Hey Ranger Guy, excellent choice for a fishing partner. I live in the Quinte region, and was in the opener tourney. I caught a 2lb and a 7.7 on Saturday morning, and 4.5 on Sunday. I went out this past Sunday, and only had one strike before the winds got too high, but met a couple of guys who had 2 roughly 4lb fish, they were catching them on the weighted rubber minnow baits"
