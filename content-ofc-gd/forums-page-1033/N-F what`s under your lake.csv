200733,OhioFisherman,2008-05-12 23:15:00,6623,"Roy me either, a program about disasters on the history channel, made me think about the salt mines here under Lake Erie, I knew some people that worked in them and they are huge. No clue, they have salt mines under the lake on the Ontario side?"
200751,e-z-out,2008-05-12 23:30:00,1052,It only took a 14' drill bit thats scary damn
200795,Cookslav,2008-05-13 00:23:00,1457,"There is a huge Salt mine under the Lake at Goderich. Infact its the largest salt mine in the world, and it extends 5km under Lake huron.  Imagine what would happen if that happened there? Cripes after seeing that I don't think I'd feel safe here in Kitchener LOL!"
200824,Smokey,2008-05-13 01:01:00,1278,Interesting link Paul. I remember watching that episode on the history channel. Sure was interesting.  Thanks
200834,OhioFisherman,2008-05-13 01:10:00,6623,"Cookslav can`t even imagine what kind of problems that would cause on Erie, guess it made the water brackish and they now catch redfish in that lake. 14 inch hole didn`t stay 14 inches for long.  Smokey, some interest programs on the history channel, stuff they never taught us in school!  http://www.wcpn.org/news/2001/01-03/0301salt-mine.html  http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=RS6"
