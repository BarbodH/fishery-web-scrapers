200453,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-12 13:07:00,957,"Friday I'm taking three youngsters fishing and I may be in over my head.  They've already bugged me to death fretting about ice conditions, so what will happen if it's not gone the very minute we're supposed to fly?  Norton and Whopper have been with me before, but it's Deg's first time and they're already ganging up on him by making him fish with me the first couple of days or so.  Poor Deg."
200457,Smokey,2008-05-12 13:12:00,1278,I've been watching the ice reports and sattelite pics form the area and you should be good to go. Most the pilots are up flying getting planes all prepped and there reports of most lakes being partially open and on edge of clearing completly.  As for the three yonguns going with you I wish you luck. Sounds like going to have to spend most of your time showing them how it's done and baiting and remvoing fish from there lines.  Good Luck to all of you and have a safe trip  Mike
200478,Whopper,2008-05-12 14:03:00,2174,  Sure hope I don't forget dinner for wednesday night   Thanks Mike for the well wishes
200490,Roy,2008-05-12 14:25:00,13728,Phil is one of the kids? Bring duct tape Connie.  Have a superb time up there all of you.
200501,Golfisher,2008-05-12 14:49:00,586,"Take some ice fishing rods, LOL!"
200507,Cory,2008-05-12 15:06:00,170,"Get a few of those bungee cords you can attach to their wrists and they shouldn't wander off to far.....  As for Phil, put something bright and shinny in front of him and he will be entertained for hours, just like my half brother"
200513,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 15:11:00,7971,"How old are the youngsters?  For our six year old we bring bubbles, lots of snacks and we let her play with the worms and minnows...LOL.  We've even thought about bringing the portable DVD player with some movies....just plug it into the 12V plug we have on the boat...could also work with gameboys etc if they get bored."
200529,Smokey,2008-05-12 15:37:00,1278,"Better yet for entertainment, put them onto a school of sheepshead and they'll be entertained for hours. From what I hear they have a bit of experience with them."
200530,Gerritt,2008-05-12 15:38:00,6129,Big kids Cliff lol (grown Men)  G
200531,mattyk,2008-05-12 15:42:00,2110,this is a good one! lol!
200532,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 15:45:00,7971," Well how was I supposed to know?? LOL.  Mind you, some days the fishing is so slow, bubbles or a movie can be fun for big people too....."
200542,Whopper,2008-05-12 16:15:00,2174,"  I refuse to grow up  Cliff you meant well, but no bubbles or movies for me TG is enough entertainment.  LOL Mike!  Cory what can I say "
200605,JohnF,2008-05-12 19:17:00,3494, I'm sure Cliff meant (beer) bubbles and (porno) movies.  JF
200609,misfish,2008-05-12 19:22:00,29133," LOL John.I was just going to say,No blowing bubbles in the lake.LOL  Kids what ya going to do with them."
200611,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 19:25:00,7971, yeah...that's what I meant
200615,SlowPoke,2008-05-12 19:32:00,2984,"I haven't fished with Norton or Whopper yet but Deg and I spent some time on the water. When he became restless I found it best to distract him with something slimey.  I hope this is another ""once in a lifetime"" trip for you guys!  -Brian  "
200665,OhioFisherman,2008-05-12 21:43:00,6623,"Sheephead in the lake? Whopper will be busy! Smallmouth? Deg can catch those, both pleasant to fish with! Both can carry gear and help an old guy out!"
200767,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-12 23:47:00,957,I'm fortunate to be joined by three such fine fishing partners.   We're going to have a great week in camp and lots of success on the water.
200771,Greencoachdog,2008-05-12 23:51:00,8163,Use them for Gator bait if they don't behave Connie!!!
200773,BryonG,2008-05-12 23:53:00,52,"Have a good trip Connie. We're taking a youngster with us too next week ,but he is only 14 yrs old.This will be his maiden trip to Canada. Hopefully the first of many."
200911,norton,2008-05-13 03:39:00,7,"Fishing with you is always special ""coach"" and its the only time I get to be called a youngster.  I've made trips with ""Connie"" for 14 of the last 16 years. last year my wife had to tag along to see who the ""other"" woman was in my life.  And the truth as to why DEG gets to fish with you...he got 3rd choice!  DEG always face forward in the boat and wave your arms when approaching rocks.  Tenneseeans cannot spell GPS!  See you at the dock on Friday - and I wish you(us) a great trip."
200918,forrest,2008-05-13 03:58:00,1032,"  Tell them 'Be thankful, there are children who live in the desert who would very much like to go fishing in a place like this'"
