This is hardly a secret spot so didn't mess with the background, i think the backgrounds make the pictures that much better. enjoy.         Berge"

200899,silvio,2008-05-13 02:55:00,433,Very nice bud big change from the sucker competition from last week.   lol nice to see you guys having fun.
200913,bbnotty,2008-05-13 03:51:00,93,"Thanks all. It wasn't really a surprise that nobody was there, since it is a couple weeks after opener. That river can get a little crazy busy but it was mothers day, and i had the ok from the mothers as long as we made it back for dinner. Oh and no we didn't get any oos smallies. Silvio good luck with the surgury, you'll be back fishing in no time. No crowds -great-, nice weather -very good-, hungry steelies -heart pumping-, day of fun and fish with my son -PRICELESS-.
