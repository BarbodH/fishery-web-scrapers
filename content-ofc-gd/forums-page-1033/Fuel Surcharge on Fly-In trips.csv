I am wondering with gas prices such as they are and with commercial carriers now adding a surcharge whether we will also begin to see this from the fly-in outfitters.  If so, any idea how much we would be looking at in terms of additional cost?"
200571,Smokey,2008-05-12 17:34:00,1278,I've only been hit with a surcharge once in 18 years of tripping and it was only an additional $20 per man. Who knows what will happen this year though.
200574,Roy,2008-05-12 17:49:00,13728,"I think your best bet would be to call the operator of that fly-in service and ask them. Some may adjust their rates to cover increased fuel costs.  Edit: Oops, and welcome aboard."
200581,Fang,2008-05-12 18:00:00,1330,two fly in operators I am familiar with both posted fuel surcharges at sportsman show. Looks like it will be more common this year. No posted $$ that I saw.   As Roy stated call ahead and get total $ so you don't have any surprises and you're crew will appreciate knowing as well

200679,moose,2008-05-12 22:09:00,266,"i know talking with darren at the sportsmans show from lakeland airways he said his prices were set and hope the price of fuel didnt go up too much , i dont think he was going to charge a fuel surcharge"
200739,OhioFisherman,2008-05-12 23:21:00,6623,"Don`t think it would be unusual with gas prices moving daily, we even get them on our trash collection bill."
200756,Gerritt,2008-05-12 23:38:00,6129,  you get a bill for the garbage truck??? seriously??  G
