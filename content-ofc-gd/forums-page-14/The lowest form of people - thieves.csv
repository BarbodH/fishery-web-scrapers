1077159,Snidley,2021-11-17 16:23:00,620,"Cops and the judges work for the government and that dominates their thinking. The cost of keeping a prisoner in jail, in Canada , IS UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE. FEDERAL INMATES COST OVER $100k PER ANNUM. THROWING THEM IN JAIL FOR $2-3 k WORTH OF PROPERTY IS NOT WORTH IT TO THEM, or to us. Insure your stuff and don't leave your really valuable stuff in plain sight."
1077160,CPH,2021-11-17 16:51:00,11,Its worth it to me...if we have the attitude that its okay and not worth the effort or not worth it arresting these idiots than everyone will do it. There is money to be made in stealing. Then lets see how that plays out for everyone. Not only will theft increase but if all claims go to insurance just wait and see what your insurance costs will be. So who other than the thief wins ?  
1077162,Snidley,2021-11-17 21:16:00,620,"I sort of agree but I also know that space is limited in jail, the courts, in probation etc. The cops have to pick their fights.  Non violent relatively minor loses DO figure into it., sorry to say. Personally it would not bother me if the powers that be executed felons,  drug users, Jihadis, etc. But they won't and we all know it so it's best to not leave stuff in sight as it's an open invitation. I'd also urge you to move but truth is I lived in Oakville up until 2019 and in that year  there were 2 murders within blocks of my home, the FBI informed Halton that it was a focus of crime tourism originating in Chile, Columbia and Peru and my friends that still live there say the crime spree continues unabated. I'm now in St Catharines and LOTS of people here LOOK like the criminal element but I have had no problems other than some incredibly discourteous, reckless drivers that are doubly so when I'm on foot. Going for a walk is supposed to be healthy but around here it could easily get you killed."
1077166,Terry,2021-11-17 21:44:00,14456,Home arrest with ankle bracelet can only go to work grocery and doctors and pay fines big fines including all court costs will cut a lot of the prison costs for non violent offenders

1077171,Snidley,2021-11-18 00:12:00,620,"There is still the cops investigation, court (many appearances likely) the ankle bracelet itself, the monitoring system ands the inevitable follow up arrests and then incarceration when junkies go out looking for their fix abrogating their court ordered confinement. I'm betting the path of least resistance for the cops, prosecutors and judges is don't bother investigating throw it over to the insurance industry to resolve. As matter of fact I know that's the way it works and it has worked that way since I was involved with the police in the 1990's. It has not gotten better since then, in fact it's far worse now than then. I know of serious criminals that got away with their crimes in the 90's because the cops or prosecutors were unable to wrap their heads around the crime or there was not the $$$ available to successfully investigate the crime let alone get a conviction. There's also the big issue in the 90's and I'm pretty sure the same applies today, that there is a serious lack of available places to put people in physical jail. No vacancy, literally."
1077173,Old Ironmaker,2021-11-18 01:25:00,8243,"Who exactly gets the opening in the cell that is built to house 2 crooks but has 4 or 5 jammed into it? Prisons are overcrouded badly, when a judge decides who gets to be a guest of the crown for 10 to 15 for murder or some homeless druggie stealing rods and reels to get his or her fix who gets to go  back to live under the bridge because the inn is full?"
1077174,Old Ironmaker,2021-11-18 01:39:00,8243,"Insurance companies do not send you replacements for whatever is lost in a theft. They send you a cheque. As far as ""they have to go to the next step"" not unless it is in your policy. It might be the replacement cost if that is stipulated in your policy as well, hopefully one pays the few bucks extra for replacement cost otherwise they are paying very little by the time they calculate thier formula for depreciation on a comprehensive claim. Not many insurance firms offer comprehensive policies with less than $1000.00 deductable these days, some more I'm told depending where you live. Believe me, I have been dealing with auto insurance for exactly 50 years now. Man I'm old for sure."
1077175,Old Ironmaker,2021-11-18 01:43:00,8243,Bang on Snidley. Don't leave anything in your vehicle for some creep to scoff (the word for steal in Hamilton in the 60's) One valuable lesson unfortunatly. Earlier you talked about executing all sorts of criminals including druggies. I'll self edit myself.......This subject will get us all riled up.
1077177,Snidley,2021-11-18 02:25:00,620,"You are right Old. Execution is probably not what I would want. I did watch a program on TV that discussed the issue of drug addicts in Seattle. One of the people interviewed was an EMT, on a live call, at a junkies address saving him from OD FOR THE 6TH TIME. HE said  it's time to just let them go freeing up his time for other, sober, people that are having life threatening episodes. The cost in $$, in wasted effort, and in rationed attention to non drug addicts is just galling, at least to that particular EMT. Having lived in Vancouver for 6 years I can tell you that people here in Ontario have NO IDEA how bad it can get with druggies. I have recent personal knowledge of a 34 year old guy who at a christening party for his newborn sniffed up some coke and promptly expired. The cause was Fentanyl, in his cocaine.  An accident? No, deliberate assinine behavior by a 34 year old, wealthy, fool who MUST have know that this is a likely result of putting your health and safety in the hands of a drug dealer with a massive vested interest to cut Fentanyl into his product.  This fact must be a nightly subject on the Vancouver news yet this goof did it anyway."
1077178,smitty55,2021-11-18 06:29:00,928,"Question for you.  I can understand dealers maybe cutting their coke with something more addictive to hook more customers, Still though, cocaine is an ""upper"" while opiates are a ""downer"" drug, so that mix just doesn't work. I just looked it up, fentanyl is 50 times as potent as heroin, that was the heavy filtered try again please back in the 70's 80's when I was growing up. That's major nasty.  But with all the fentanyl related deaths all they are doing is losing customers, so logically that makes no sense. Now of course it's easy to speculate that for some of them their brains are so fried they can't even do that right and put in a lethal amount, it sure doesn't take much. Or more than likely for the big boys they just don't give a crap so long as they keep gaining customers overall. You are right though, albeit pretty hard on the guy man. But hey, I get where you're coming from. With the situation being well known he should have known better and realized the increased risks, but as it turned out he trusted someone he shouldn't have that likely trusted someone else. It's not like someone in his position is buying it off a street corner where it often comes from clandestine labs with questionable quality. Real sad story over all, it must have been devastating for family. Then imagine what the mother will have to go through once the child is considered old enough to know, that would a hard one for sure. Such a shame... Cheers"

Best to keep those pieces under your pillow, inside of your locked bedroom that's guarded by a Rottweiler, no a mountain lion, lol."
1076835,Ron,2021-10-28 21:29:00,1683,"I recently went to Superior North on a fishing trip. It was a great trip until I got home late Monday night. Between the hours of 6am and 8am, some person stole 3 fishing rods out of the back of my truck in my own driveway. 1 outfit was my pride and joy, a vintage G LOOMIS 1562 IMX 13' made in Canada float rod custom rebuilt by our very own Spiel. Along with this rod was my 5"" Rainmaker reel built by Canada Fishing Reels. The other 2 rod and reel combos were my 8'6"" Fenwick Eagle Elite med heavy both paired with Shimano Stradic CI4+ C3000HG. A generous reward will be given upon the safe return.  "
1076836,Whopper,2021-10-28 21:36:00,2174,"That really sucks, I hope you get them back. Went on a walk through of a vacant building yesterday. Meth heads broke in and completely trashed two big electrical services for scrap metals. Close to 400k in damages."
1076839,AKRISONER,2021-10-28 22:36:00,5558,Ron what area of Ontario do you live in?
1076840,Ron,2021-10-28 22:43:00,1683,"Cobourg. Whoever stole these, wasn't targeted. With construction advertising on the side of my truck. They were hoping to get an easy score. I'm sure if I had my tools in there along with my rods, the Dewalt tools would have been gone instead. I'm not on the internet much anymore. I don't do Faceplant Twitter or any of the other sites. So if anyone sees this stuff on a buy and sell, please please let me know.  Cheers..."
1076841,misfish,2021-10-28 22:51:00,29133,The problem will be the scumbag hock shops Ron. They do not give a crap where the stuff came from. They buy cheap and will sell high.  Hope you get it all back.
1076842,Spiel,2021-10-28 23:00:00,9065,"I always look forward to our chats buddy, but that call telling me what happened was not a happy moment.  	Thieves are the lowest!"

1076848,Big Cliff,2021-10-29 11:45:00,6899,"I hate stories like this, even if these scumbags are caught they will be back on the street before the cops that catch them can finish the paperwork."
1076849,AKRISONER,2021-10-29 12:18:00,5558,"Ron have you considered giving your insurance broker a call? I believe that your vehicles insurance might help you recoupe a bit of what you lost? Can obviously tell this is some very very high end gear, some of it technically irreplaceable. might be worth a shot?"
1076854,mamona,2021-10-29 14:01:00,597,I think AKRISONER has good idea. Good luck to you.
1076855,Ron,2021-10-29 14:19:00,1683,"By all means Bill, thanks!  Yes, I have contacted my insurance company.  The claim goes through your home policy. I have replacement value, however, you end up having a claim against you and your rates automatically go up a certain percentage so they recoup their loss  over time, you end up paying for the loss regardless. I can buy a new reel, (2 yr waiting list). I have been fortunate to track down one blank, they haven't made them for 35 yrs and still considered the best on the market. Spiel has graciously agreed to build it for me. The downfall, it's just not the same rod I grew to enjoy for 30 plus years. The other 2 rods (Fenwick Elite 8'6"" med heavy) are no longer available. Again, the 2 stolen Shimano Stradic CI4 HG 3000 are no longer available. So yes, it is a substantial loss."
1076857,Spiel,2021-10-29 14:48:00,9065,Oddly enough Ron I have discovered the original source of that blank and I know what the current seller paid for it.
1076860,BillM,2021-10-29 15:22:00,17367,I have a feeling once Spiel is done with the new one you won't be as heartbroken.  Nice gesture.

1076866,cisco,2021-10-29 22:39:00,597,Ron you have always been a gem to me! Recall when you taught me about jumbo Simcoe perch years ago. IMO you should closely examine all homes nearby to see who has security cameras. Perhaps this will result in some leads. Best of luck and IMHO you shouldn't be too worried since you could outfish most of us with an alder twig with cotton line using just a hook with some red fabric on it.

I closed our trailer for the season last Sunday. Got home late in the afternoon and didn't feel like bringing my antifreeze pump and tool box into the house. Got up the next morning, went out to get my stuff and they were gone. I even have a tonneau cover on my truck; but the unwed mother's son (site wouldn't let me type the word I wanted) opened it and scooped the stuff; talk about ballsy. Sorry we both lost our stuff; but school costs money and this lesson was expensive. Dan."
1076872,LostAnotherOne,2021-10-30 17:05:00,956,This post definitely serves a reminder to keep all your stuff locked away and not exposed.  I just bought 2 kayaks last weekend and even thou I live in the country they are now locked away and not beside the house for everyone to drive by and see.  Checked your vehicles too boys and make sure there locked at night.  The wife’s nephew was caught by his mom a few years ago with 2K in his room.  Asked how he got it he said he used to break into vehicles that were unlocked at night and take what he can get.  He said you would be surprised how many vehicles are unlocked at night.  Hope you find your stuff Ron.
1076873,woodenboater,2021-10-30 17:49:00,2277," SHEEIT ! Hope someone find it through internet sleuthing, or random pawn shop visit by members here, and others. also hope the thieves are caught, hopefully still in possession of the rods/reels. after having my plates stolen, been meaning to get cameras, if only to be able to help cops identify the low lifes. good luck, and fingers crossed for a happy outcome"
1076880,Hack_Fisherman,2021-11-01 00:38:00,720,"That friggin sucks. I HATE thieving POS Scumbags. I wish it was legal too hook things up to 600volts.    	And what I’ll never get is how mad thieves get when someone screws THEM. I’ve worked with people who “should” have been rehabilitated, but to watch them brag and compare stories when they encounter other “rehabilitated” persons was an eye opener. They don’t learn from the system, they learn from each other. And they think they are entitled to take what they want. what the hell"

Good luck getting them back."
1077023,CPH,2021-11-10 17:55:00,11,Every boater and every fisherman should be on the look out for stolen items. Had an outboard stolen and police just say call the insurance company. There is nothing they can do even if they catch the bugger. They told me he would be out by the time they finish the paper work. So what is their motivation to even look for the thief. Why would they put themselves in Harms way arresting these idiots if only to have them back on the street possibly targeting the cop who arrested them. There is only one way to deal with these people...if you know what I mean   
1077151,Old Ironmaker,2021-11-16 04:02:00,8243,"I no longer keep a dime in any of my vehicles. Nothing of value, ever. If they want it they will take it, including the vehicle. There was a time in the 80's as soon as my rather expensive car stereo was replaced it was stolen shortly afterwards. We worked hard for our stuff. I know it was the teenaged son of the neighbour across the street ,this was before security cameras. I was positive it was the kid as thier next door neighbour saw him break in. She was an older lady then living alone. She didn't want to get involved which I understood fully. Frustration was knowing who it was and couldn't do anything about it. I did have a talk with his father that got me nowhere except further frustrated. This was not a low income neighbourhood, all brand new homes. After talking to that goof I know where the kid got it from. I got the teen alone one night, I didn't lay a finger on him and didn't need to, nothing ever went missing ever again. Golf clubs gone from the back of the truck while inside the Beer Store when I let my gaurd down 5 years back.I was gone about 5 minutes max. Beware if in Dunnville Ontario, bad street drug culture there. Some pri^% smashed my window out of a Caddy I had to take pocket change in the centre council, in broad daylight mid afternoon. If someone asked I would have given it to them. Worse than a thief is a thief that will go to the extent of murder for a score. That is sub human. Even criminals ripping off fellow criminals is wrong. It sure sucks for you, especially your favorite rods and reels. These jerk's don't work, never have never will. Your stuff is gone in an hour. They all have thier own ""fence"" and the fence will even pay them in whatever they put in their arms or up their noses. Sad state of affairs we have. This drug epidemic, even pandemic has been going on for centuries not decades. Cops can not and will not do a thing. Call the insurance company, especially if you visit Dunnville."
1077152,Fisherman,2021-11-16 13:56:00,7201,"Along with the cops not being interested, it's the judges and lawyers that keep the criminals out of jail to continue the process,   arrest, in, and out, lawyers get paid."
