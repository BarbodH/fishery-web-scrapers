1077476,Snidley,2021-12-04 15:19:00,620,"I see that Jack Dorsey is now heavily involved in a new one since dropping out as the boss of Twitter. I suppose his entry means something for investors but, for me, when i look at him I see a fellow who looks like he sleeps under an overpass in the rough. Add to that his background with Twitter, the place idiots go to destroy their careers, i realize what a disgraceful quagmire investing has become. It can't last and another huge collapse must be on the horizon where all of this nonsense will fleece the little guy and our politicians will bail out the big players. It is a recurring story of Wall/Bay Street that we don't seem to be able to grow out of."

The big 50% savings on the Striker suit was ok I guess, but the quality IMO, dropped. My Striker suit I bought last year, is much better quality then what they had there this morning.¬† Treeker is their line. Best deal which I bought, was the 10 AH Brute lithium Marcum battery and charger. Reg $149, on sale for $99. $50 savings and now have a much lighter battery and will power my new finder all day . It even comes with inline fuse. Someone was thinking ."

Ended up getting a few of the fancy diawa crankbait boxes for basically the same price as Plano. Next years plastics are all now stocked up and ready to go!"

1077412,AKRISONER,2021-11-30 19:18:00,5558,im going to be keeping a very close eye on the secondary market. Already a pile of them popped up with people offering a 25% discount cause they got them 50% off. They arent moving either so theres some opportunity there to snipe one if the timing is right.
1077413,misfish,2021-11-30 19:31:00,29133,"So the smaller AH battery will do for say, 4-5 hours ? It will be in a warm heated hub off the ice. To warm for some, but just right for me.LOL"
