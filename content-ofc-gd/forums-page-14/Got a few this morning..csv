1077560,Rizzo,2021-12-09 22:18:00,4754,nice! Ice fishing already and even a snow machine on the ice. Good times. I still have one more open water musky fishing adventure on the mind
1077562,limeyangler,2021-12-09 22:28:00,5204,"I‚Äôd love to be musky fishing still! It‚Äôs probably a good thing I‚Äôm not though, I think I messed up my rotator cuff casting this October, really not a good thing but I don‚Äôt think I could resist casting and it needs to heal."
1077564,misfish,2021-12-09 23:24:00,29133,"Ah crappolas,I thought maybe you would be holding some whities there Simon.  We have some mild temps coming here,so I will still get my river fishing in. Going to be a mixed bag of temps here all winter long. YO YO YO"
1077565,Rizzo,2021-12-09 23:49:00,4754,...ya casting is not a real temptation for me (especially in this cold!). Trolling or jigging will be on the itinerary
1077567,limeyangler,2021-12-09 23:53:00,5204,"I‚Äôd take another winter like last year to be honest, love winter, love short winters even more these days‚Ä¶. Lol. whitefish won‚Äôt be for a while, they are mostly in the deeper bodies of water, some of which still have open water. good luck in yer yak!"
1077568,limeyangler,2021-12-09 23:57:00,5204,"Yah, I hear yah‚Ä¶."
