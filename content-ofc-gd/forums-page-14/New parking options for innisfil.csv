1039686,kickingfrog,2019-01-26 01:46:00,8333,"https://barrie.ctvnews.ca/new-parking-app-for-anglers-and-snowmobilers-in-innisfil-1.4269715  For Ram Gandhi, it’s an easy way to make a buck.  In the past, the Innisfil homeowner allowed anglers and snowmobilers to park in his driveway when there was no place left on the street, but now he’s renting it out. “I’m charging just about ten-dollars for a flat rate,” says Gandhi. The town has partnered with Rover Parking to introduce a free app to give homeowners, like Gandhi, the opportunity to rent out their driveway, helping the town ease the parking problem. “The hope is to put some of the cars that are parked on the roads into existing infrastructure, into existing driveways, so that as it defers us the need for the municipality to have to invest in parking lots in the future,” says Jason Inwood, Town of Innisfil. Snowmobilers that frequent the area say parking is limited, and when they do find a spot, there can be restrictions.  “You gotta come early,” says Phil Falcone.  “If you don’t come early, everything gets taken.” Gandhi says he has seen people drive around for 15 to 30 minutes trying to find a place to park. “The last two years they just come up and knock on my door because they couldn’t find any parking on the street.  It gets busy.” Homeowners can find out more information on the free parking app here.

1039695,misfish,2019-01-26 02:22:00,29133,"On a serious note here, I have met a few lake front owners, and have asked if they would mind if I parked my truck in their drive, They had no issues. I even gave a bottle of wine or what ever their drink fancied . Have even offered a feed of my catch.  Sometimes just carrying a conversation with a local, is all it takes.  I have a place to park my truck  if need be. Being polite goes along ways."

Good for you Brian wish we all could follow along. Take a lesson readers; it really does work 75% of the time.The other 25% well lets just say their day is coming; one way or the other. Dan
