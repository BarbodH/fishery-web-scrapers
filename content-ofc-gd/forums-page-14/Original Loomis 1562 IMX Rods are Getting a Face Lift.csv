1077270,Spiel,2021-11-22 20:35:00,9065,"In the shop today, two old school 1562 IMX builds are currently getting a face lift. 	I'm swapping out the old worn and low quality cork work for modern custom wood seats and top end cork.  	There's gotta be a better way to make a buck.   "
1077271,misfish,2021-11-22 21:28:00,29133,"That has got to be a be atch of a job, to get that crap off."
1077272,Spiel,2021-11-22 21:35:00,9065,"With factory builds Brian I know what I'm getting into most of the time, it's the custom builds that always throw a curve or two at me.  	You can see in the first picture where I have already cleaned the blank down to factory smooth forward of the original reel placement."
1077274,BillM,2021-11-22 22:33:00,17367,"I've got that same factory handle on one of my IM6s, lol."
1077300,Ron,2021-11-24 16:41:00,1683,I had to look at the reel seat to see if it was my stolen rod. Lol. Just kidding of course.
1077362,Spiel,2021-11-26 19:10:00,9065,Well one of them is now cleaned off entirely and will be getting the new handle installed starting tomorrow. 	It could be fishing for Steel by next weekend.   
1077440,Spiel,2021-12-02 16:46:00,9065,Well the first IMX 1562 is done and ready to bank Chrome again.   
1077441,Silvertracker,2021-12-02 17:02:00,2,If you ever get a 1562 IM6 for sale - i am interested  Thank you 
1077446,misfish,2021-12-02 21:19:00,29133,Beauty work bud. Is that the fat cork handle ?
1077448,Spiel,2021-12-02 22:19:00,9065," Thank you Brian.  	Not sure what you mean by ""fat"" Brian.  	It's as thin in diameter as I can get it (at its maximum diameter) for the reel seat hardware size which is used in the majority of my Steelehead rods."
1077449,misfish,2021-12-02 22:44:00,29133,"The same as what you did on mine. I found that the cork was much thicker then a factory build. Took a bit to get use to, but much nicer to hold on to then a factory one."
1077450,Spiel,2021-12-02 22:48:00,9065,"Factory builds, especially sliding ring handles are rather thin (in diameter) I find and tiresome over long days with grip fatigue. 	Many of my customers and friends now prefer a slightly beefier grip as they find it less fatiguing."
1077485,Fish Farmer,2021-12-05 12:24:00,2234,"Nice !!! Looks to clean for me, you need some scales and slime on it.üëçüòÇ"
1077506,BillM,2021-12-06 22:53:00,17367,"Chris, you ever seal the cork or leave that up to the customer?"
1077522,Spiel,2021-12-07 17:51:00,9065,I usually leave it to the customer to ask Bill. 	However if I'm using a lower grade cork at the request of the customer that requires some filler I always use a sealer afterwards.
1077550,Ron,2021-12-09 19:28:00,1683,"Meh... The rebuild you did for me looked better. LOL Just kidding, they all look GREAT!"
