1077149,captpierre,2021-11-15 22:38:00,2521,Hi Gents. I posted a while ago that I stepped on my Symetre reel and bent the internal handle. Took it in to Shimano in Peterborough last Thursday. Got her delivered back today. Super nice guy there to deal with. $30 for an overhaul including new handle and bearings plus $10 for shipping. Iâ€™m very impressed. Thatâ€™s service ðŸ‘Œ 
1077150,crappieperchhunter,2021-11-16 01:19:00,2582,Hard to beat that. For years I have heard only good things about the service from Shimano in PTBO. Sounds like they are still doing it right.
1077161,fisherman7,2021-11-17 17:17:00,325,It's why I only buy Shimano. Took some old reels there for service. They didn't have the part so the changed all the guts with new for $25!
1077183,Sinker,2021-11-18 15:17:00,8692,It really is amazing. You can't go wrong and it justifies buying nothing but shimano reels. They are great guys too. I'm lucky to live 10 mins away  S.
1077385,b_cdot,2021-11-28 00:38:00,270,Just had a great experience with them too. Sent a couple of my older stradics in for cleaning and maintenance through the mail. Turn around time was less than a week. Got a call and he told me the service he did and we had a chat about good value reels.
1077438,BillM,2021-12-02 15:22:00,17367,"I've sent them a few of my Calais, they always come back with all kinds of new hardware on the inside and I'm never charged more then the original service amount.Â  Â Those boys do good work.Â  Â Which reminds me, I gotta pack some reels up and get them out there!"
1077439,AKRISONER,2021-12-02 16:33:00,5558,"With high quality brass or even better gearing in most high end stuffâ€¦this is what makes spending the extra money sooo much more worth it. You take an old stradic or curado apart even after youâ€™ve fished the thing into the ground, throw in a new bearing, replace a bail spring, clean it, oil it and grease it and the thing performs like new. once you start servicing your own gear you see exactly what you are paying the extra money for."
