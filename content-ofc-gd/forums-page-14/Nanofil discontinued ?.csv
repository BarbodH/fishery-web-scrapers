1076957,misfish,2021-11-07 20:51:00,29133,"Been trying to buy for the past few weeks. Now I see that it is discontinued ? True/false ?  If so, to bad, great line."
1076958,fishdawg,2021-11-07 21:02:00,912,True.. unfortunately
1076961,misfish,2021-11-07 21:30:00,29133,"So whats on Amazon is the end of the line, sorta speak."
1076963,Terry,2021-11-07 22:45:00,14456,I ordered 300 yards from eBay it hasn’t arrived yet   You never know for sure what you really get from eBay
1076964,fishdawg,2021-11-07 23:52:00,912,Yes whatever you see online or in stores is old stock.. too bad it was good line.
1076965,HTHM,2021-11-08 01:53:00,4082,"According to Amazon, is in not discontinued."
1076990,porkpie,2021-11-09 13:49:00,2521,Oh no….. this is terrible news….  I wish I’d known sooner and I’d be scooping it up.
1076994,ketchenany,2021-11-09 16:25:00,3229,Lots here! If this is the stuff! https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=Nonofil&ref=nb_sb_noss_2
1077016,BillM,2021-11-10 15:46:00,17367,Just bought 12 spools of it.   Should last me a while.  Great stuff.
1077022,Scott S,2021-11-10 17:49:00,203,Grimsby Tackle has it on sale !!
1077034,DanD,2021-11-10 22:18:00,2223,Correct me if I'm wrong; but doesn't any form of line (plastics/polymers) degrade with time? Buying up old stock or keeping it for extended periods of time; doesn't it make it weak? Dan.
1077036,GBW,2021-11-10 23:01:00,8460,"It's a Uni-Filament fishing line, not a mono line and not a braid.  Reminds me oF dental floss. Cast's a mile however!"
1077037,steellee,2021-11-10 23:28:00,21,"No one using Fireline crystal as a substitute? I have tried nanofil and although it handles and casts awesome its durability and abrasion resistance is terrible. Crystal I found to have similar handling, (not quite as good) but its strength and abrasion resistance is crazy. Also way over rated test wise so I usually go with 8lb or even 6 and it breaks FAR over that"
1077042,mitch seguin,2021-11-11 13:37:00,98,"I agree on the durability and abrasion issue when using nanofill for floatfishing in freezing conditions.  Crystal is superior IMO.  What is even better is the fireline Ultra 8; however, they have chosen to discontinue this product as well.  I had to search a lot to find one spool."
1077043,Garnet,2021-11-11 14:45:00,2056,"Both got less than 1 hour with me. Bloodline 3 days when the coating wore off and sunk just like every other mono. Been using Co Polamar for 40 years, still try the next greatest line every time, guess I like throwing money away."
1077047,porkpie,2021-11-11 16:30:00,2521,"Thanks for the grimsby tackle tip.  I’ll check it out.  I don’t use nanofil for float fishing.   Not much use for it in that application, I’ve been on the trilene bandwagon for 20 years or so since they stopped making samurai green.  nanofil is the cats keester on a spinning reel though!"
1077067,steellee,2021-11-12 14:12:00,21,Seems in the fishing world everything good gets discontinued!
1077072,smitty55,2021-11-12 19:23:00,928,"It's been like that for a real long time, sometimes even certain colour patterns. What it boils down to is that certain lures and colours sell so well that other product sales drop too much so they drop the big sellers."
