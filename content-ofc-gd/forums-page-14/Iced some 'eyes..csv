Once the sun hit the treeline we had a short 20 minute flurry of action, iced 6 walleye but 4 were tiny and went back, I came home with my catch, one just under 18"" and one just under 22"". Fun afternoon.  "

1077617,Hack_Fisherman,2021-12-12 16:45:00,720,Beauty day and pics and a nice bounty

1077619,crappieperchhunter,2021-12-12 16:54:00,2582,Thx for sharing Simon and enjoy your fish fry. Some of my best eye memories are from the sometimes unbelievable dusk bites back in the day on Scugog. Double digit numbers of eyes per person happened often enough during those 30-45 minute  feeding frenzies. 
1077621,limeyangler,2021-12-12 18:10:00,5204,"I was very surprised there was 9” on this lake, it behaves more like a deep trout lake and freezes in two stages most years. Normally the shallow bay at the landing where the trail comes out goes the same time as my home lake, but that first bay opens up to the main basin area that gets to 67’FOW, many times you get 7”-8” in the first bay then 200 yards out it’s suddenly 2” cuz it froze later, this year it was 9” everywhere. Since the initial dump of snow we had here that screwed the trails with downed trees we’ve had maybe 2”-3” of snow since the ice formed, so the lakes are makin real good ice this year. BTW, you said you were looking for a sled this year, I recommend 4 strokes."
1077622,limeyangler,2021-12-12 18:11:00,5204,I think I’ll go back this afternoon.
1077623,limeyangler,2021-12-12 18:12:00,5204,Always a spot on the sled if you’re up this way.
1077624,limeyangler,2021-12-12 18:15:00,5204,"That evening bite is why I switch to trout once it opens, the walleye seem to feed exclusively early morning and at dusk, very short window on the ice, fun , but I like to catch all day…. Lol…crappie are good for all day too here."
1077664,TJQ,2021-12-13 17:27:00,7806,Nice... gorgeous out there!!
1077666,wee scot,2021-12-13 18:34:00,75,Fantastic pictures Simon as always .

1077719,akaShag,2021-12-17 13:40:00,2073,Now THAT would be something I would really like to experience! Doug
1077757,smitty55,2021-12-19 04:36:00,928,For sure. Better do it while you can before the crowds show up on the new trail in you made. Good luck
1077759,limeyangler,2021-12-19 12:56:00,5204,"Lol, surprisingly only one person showed up."
