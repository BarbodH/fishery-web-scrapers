1077204,b_cdot,2021-11-19 23:06:00,270,"Got a few different responses on walleye central forum, nobody mentioned anything about cavitation. Talked to my dealer and says it could be a cavitation issue, he has sent the picture off for a 2nd opinion. Motor is only 3 years old. Any thoughts as to what the issue could be? Thanks "
1077206,Terry,2021-11-19 23:33:00,14456,Did it happen over night did it slowly spread Do you leave the boat in the water
1077207,misfish,2021-11-20 00:00:00,29133,"Just a guess here, but the rest of the motor looks new black. Is it possible that the plate was painted without UV protection pigments ?"
1077208,b_cdot,2021-11-20 00:11:00,270,"boat is trailered, really noticeable last couple months. I can't say if it happened quickly or not. Just never caught my eye until I was doing my winterization this year"
1077209,b_cdot,2021-11-20 00:13:00,270,very well could be....rest of the motor is like a dark gray
1077210,smitty55,2021-11-20 07:09:00,928,"Simple question, but does it look like a coating, or more like a metal reaction on the part?"
1077211,Terry,2021-11-20 10:35:00,14456,"That is what I was thinking and why I wanted to know if the boat is left in the water, I was thinking Â the zinc anode reacting to rouge electrical source or something, but he doesnâ€™t keepÂ it in the water"
1077212,glen,2021-11-20 11:23:00,2641,Is the underside normal.
1077214,Sinker,2021-11-20 16:59:00,8692,Thats wild. Never seen anything like that. Cavitation would make sense sort of...  S.
1077222,b_cdot,2021-11-20 20:40:00,270,"I cant remember, I'm going to take a closer look at it, i'll try and get a pic. Boat is not currently at home."
1077223,b_cdot,2021-11-20 20:43:00,270,I'm going to hit it with some CLR and see what happens. If it's a coating it's very subtle. It didn't feel like a coating
1077228,DanD,2021-11-20 21:46:00,2223,Is the prop a painted one; if so is there any of the same discolouration? Just thinking that it might be exhaust or combustion chamber acids that etched the finish of the paint? Dan.
1077231,b_cdot,2021-11-20 23:03:00,270,Prop is SS no discoloration on the prop
1077250,b_cdot,2021-11-21 22:31:00,270,tried some CLR on it and it didn't touch it. It's faded paint not a buildup of any kind. Under side of the cavitation plate is completely unaffected
1077251,misfish,2021-11-21 22:54:00,29133,No UV protection then
1077252,glen,2021-11-22 00:07:00,2641,Put sunscreen on the rest of the engine quick. Â  Lol.
1077262,DanD,2021-11-22 15:22:00,2223,"Maybe not so far from the truth; if you want the whole motor to be white? Maybe not so much sunscreen; but has anyone on your boat ever used some form of (Strong deet) bug repellent? Repellent that may have inadvertently got sprayed on or dumped on top of the plate? Deet is an amazing bug repellent; it is also good for starting camp fires (better then gasoline), discoloring painted surfaces and Oh yea causing cancer. A buddy of mine worked for Bell Canada (from the70s till retirement). Back in his early days; the general worker's supply warehouses, had cases of deet, in 4-5 ounce squeeze bottles of all but strait 100% deet. Long story short. if you got that stuff on anything; it would turn it chalk white with-in minutes. Worked great keeping the flies away; but I made the mistake of wiping my hands (this crap burned) on the tan seat of my boat. After the sun hit it; it looked like it was tie-dyed; it pulled the colour right out of the seat. Dan."

My wife used to have a bad habit of putting sunscreen on her arms and then get in the car, everything she touched or rubbed turned the black interior to smurf blue."
1077277,b_cdot,2021-11-23 05:38:00,270, I can't think of that happening. I've seen deet create that white film on a gray gunwale after it baked in the sun and it never came out. I did bring the boat in for a detail in the spring. Makes me wonder if something he used could have reacted with it.
1077288,dave524,2021-11-23 19:31:00,4508,"Dad worked for Bell 1945-85,Â  we always had a supply of that Deet at the cottage for bug season, worked good but I recall the '64 Pontiac Station wagon had two sections where your hands would go that the surface was well lets say texturedÂ ðŸ¤£"
1077297,BillM,2021-11-24 04:20:00,17367,Bad factory paint job?
