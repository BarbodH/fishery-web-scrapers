Down sized my float,weights and line and going with small bags and single eggs again. Also decided to fish deep frog waters and way inside seams of the fast. It was the right choice. 1st drift and had a fish on at my 1st spot.  This usually means, the rest of the morning will suck. Only the one fish out of the 1st pool after a half hour, moved on to my next spot. This one turned out to be the only one I would have to fish for the rest of the morning . Single eggs took 4 of the fish, 1st was on a small chartreuse bag . One fish I lost as I thought I was dragging bottom,so just lifted the rod, but well,it was a fish that swam away. LMAO. All good,as I was laughing at myself as I know,hook sets are free.       I fish alone,with no body else,and taking selfies when no one is around, is ok by me. LOL "
1077117,irishfield,2021-11-14 18:26:00,26272,And I was just sitting here watching it piss down rain and snow thinking... I bet that Brian guy is out there in that mess!
1077120,misfish,2021-11-14 18:37:00,29133, LOL  Never seen a drop of anything til I got back into Barrie.
1077123,Terry,2021-11-14 19:05:00,14456,I think he is starting to look like a Viking nice fish
1077127,misfish,2021-11-14 21:57:00,29133,I have been told I look barbarian. HAHAHAHAHAHA
1077128,Terry,2021-11-14 22:09:00,14456,I was trying to be polite  lol 
1077132,LefroyFisherman,2021-11-15 00:38:00,602,Nice fish! When I'm alone I just put the timer on the phone or do a video and prop it up with something on the ground.
1077135,Rizzo,2021-11-15 03:16:00,4754,"Right on. I know what you are saying about the ""early"" fish. If I have a musky follow early (like first 15 minutes) or a rod goes off early trolling...you better catch that fish because there ain't gonna be nuthin happening the rest of the day. No clue why, but that early fish can be a real curse."
1077137,AKRISONER,2021-11-15 08:26:00,5558,"Caught a 4.75 largemouth 2 minutes into a tournament this fall…thought we were toast…sure enough a 30 minute lul ensued…then we caught 3 3lb smallies on three casts, back in business!"
1077138,lew,2021-11-15 11:39:00,12766,"But not always, my best day ever was opening morning of musky season in 2001 I left the dock at 7:30 and headed to a favorite spot and got a musky on the very 1st cast of the season then boated another 8 fish by 10:00, so 9 fish in 2 1/2 hours. But it doesn't always work that way  LOL"
1077141,mamona,2021-11-15 15:11:00,597,Well done barbarian Brian
1077147,akaShag,2021-11-15 20:21:00,2073,I think you look pretty civilized.............
