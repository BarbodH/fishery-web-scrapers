1077298,crappieperchhunter,2021-11-24 16:13:00,2582,You are Â killing me. Followed the no travel advisory last year and never ice fished at all. Can't wait for the hardwater season to begin.
1077299,misfish,2021-11-24 16:17:00,29133,"Heat wave coming Simon, sorry. BuggerÂ ðŸ¤£"
1077306,limeyangler,2021-11-24 18:28:00,5204," Sorry guys, lol. It froze over in one night, North wind howling to 30kmh right now but the point and two islands at the head of our bay will protect the ice completely. We were forecast snow overnight and this morning but it never materialized, next to nights itâ€™s clear, no wind and dropping to -20c, will be skating out front here on the weekend, might even drill a hole for the sake of wetting a line but the fishing in front of the house sucks until spring. Just came up from shore 5 minutes ago and snapped some pictures.   "

1077308,limeyangler,2021-11-24 19:10:00,5204,"Last year was brutal here, we were not really on the ice until mid December and my last trip on a quad or snowmobile was around mid March, a full month or maybe more than usual, totally missed out on the great crappie fishing this Spring on the ice, but was kinda of cool cuz we had really good shore fishing for walleye before walleye season closed!   I also found a real honey hole for crappie the previous fall which made up for missing the spring ice biteâ€¦. A little bit anyway.   "
