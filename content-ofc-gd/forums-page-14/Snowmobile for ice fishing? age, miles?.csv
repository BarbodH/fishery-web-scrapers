1077690,AKRISONER,2021-12-14 20:35:00,5558,i wish this held up for the new ones...got a buddy witt one that has gone through 3! yes 3 warranty engines
1077694,GBW,2021-12-15 01:49:00,8460,MFG MAY still support a part after 7 years as it's on a cross over used in another item that is newer.  But they (car MFG mostly) can stop production after 7 years from that part numbers End Of Life time.
1077697,pics,2021-12-15 11:35:00,1268,"Here is an example of what is out there. The Bravo is the ultimate fishing machine but 10,000 for a 2011 is a little much... not sure if you can read the ad..  https://www.facebook.com/groups/132526827456122/permalink/900550110653786/?sale_post_id=900550110653786"
1077698,porkpie,2021-12-15 15:12:00,2521,"That may be so, but I've owned a lot of crappy old sleds in my day and never had a problem getting parts, current shortages aside."
1077699,Tjames09,2021-12-15 15:56:00,664,"I can't read it, not part of the group. But 10,000 for a 10 year old machine. New sleds are 10k."
1077704,BassMan11,2021-12-15 18:38:00,583,Honestly the worst time of year to be looking for a sled lol. Plus COVID prices are banana's for any rec vehicle or boat. As others have stated a fan cooled utility sled are the most simple and don't need snow to run properly. But they are also the hardest to find at any sort of reasonable price. Some models to look for a starter sled: Tundra LT Skandic Touring SLE Bravo LT Vk540 Venture Enticer LT Bearcat XLT As for miles under 10K should be something to shoot for on average. Good luck with your search. I looked long and hard to finally find a 99 Skidoo Skandic WT in ok shape at a good price. It's tough out there! Also for parts... Royal Distributors BM 
1077716,GYPSY400,2021-12-17 00:34:00,191,"This is the worst possible time to shop for a snowmobile! Prices are highest during the start of the winter, and now with covid, add $1000 to anything out there. You will need to educate yourself on maintaining a snowmobile,  they are high maintenance machines if you want to be reliable.  Things to avoid: machines with silly bar risers and Monster energy stickers. Every teen ager that pounds a machine off jumps does these mods!  Also, stay away from adds that say "" ran fine when parked""  if it ran fine,  it wouldn't be parked!"
1077724,Tjames09,2021-12-17 16:56:00,664,"Thanks for the help guys, found a 2014 Bearcat for a reasonable price and reasonable miles. Been doing some research on preseason maintenance. Did the chain case oil, spark plugs, and 2 stroke oil already, and checked the belt and tension. Found a manual online that talks bout cleaning the carbs, but might be out of my wheelhouse."
1077731,Fisherman,2021-12-17 18:55:00,7201,"Not hard to do, you should be able to find some youtube videos for that.  You might have to get them balanced for equal output."
1077734,AKRISONER,2021-12-17 19:36:00,5558,"Eh, I wouldn’t worry too much about the carbs on a 2014. Run ethanol free premium only if you can. Consider running a load of seafoam through it. Run good quality synthetic two stroke oil only. tension and alignment on the track are really important to keep an eye on. Good luck with the Arctic cat 😉"
1077735,GBW,2021-12-17 23:27:00,8460,"Problem there is, if he want's to run the BRP XPS (part number 779127) 2-stroke oil.  My work cannot get it.  All we have left now is what we pre-ordered.  Many dealers in the Kawartha's don't have stock on that part number and the bigger jugs (779128)."
1077736,Sharkbait22,2021-12-18 00:08:00,297,
1077737,Dara,2021-12-18 00:26:00,3052,What I believe you should do is find what oils Arctic Cat says and use that. Doo oil is nothing like any other oil. The stuff smells like cookies burning. Along with what you did I always loosen my track and give the boogie wheels a spin to make sure bearings are good.  Pry a bit and make sure rear idlers are good too.
1077742,GYPSY400,2021-12-18 01:54:00,191,"Congrats on the new sled!! I run shell synthetic ( gold label) in my polaris which can be found at Canadian Tire.  If it doesn't run perfect, learn how to clean the carbs so it doesn't lean out on the top end and blow a piston.  Running a good dose of seafoam along with shell V-power gas will keep the fuel system trouble free in the future."
1077743,Tjames09,2021-12-18 02:06:00,664,"    Thanks everyone. I wanted a fan sled, and not many are made and easy to find. Theres an Arctic Cat dealer in PTBO and they have lots of stock of everything. Bought the recommended 2 stroke oil there. Dumped half a can of seafoam in the gas already.  Previous owner said he replaced the slider last year and bearings, so hopefully that parts good."
1077744,AKRISONER,2021-12-18 06:02:00,5558,"+1 for amsoil. We have a membership, and I use their oil in my boats as well and I’ve got nothing but good things to say about them. Their pricing is actually lower if you purchase direct from the dealer."
1077817,chris.brock,2021-12-24 06:03:00,4053,"I think you made a good choice and it will serve you well, like other guys have said- no ethanol fuel"
1077819,pics,2021-12-24 14:19:00,1268,The Costco 91 octane has no ethanol. It's also cheaper than most other stations.  Suncor also has no ethanol but its significantly higher in price..
1077820,Tjames09,2021-12-24 21:39:00,664,Whats interesting is the manual recommends 87 octane with 10% ethanol. In the manual it says the ethanol prevents the gas from freezing.
1077821,porkpie,2021-12-24 22:37:00,2521,"Whatever you do, don’t buy into that!  No corn gas!"
1077859,chris.brock,2021-12-29 05:31:00,4053,"and trudeau and fauci say get your boosters, ethanol and pfizer are both poison, that is undisputable"
1077861,GYPSY400,2021-12-29 16:38:00,191,"Gas line antifreeze IS ethanol.. I never use it and never have a problem with freeze up.  Ethanol is murder on carburetors and other rubber parts of the fuel system.   The key is to keep the water out of the fuel system. Even if you run ethanol gas, remember to run the last tank of the year ethanol free and then run the carbs dry when you store it for summer.  Good luck on your snowmobile season."
1077584,Tjames09,2021-12-11 15:31:00,664,"Been looking for a sled mainly for ice fishing. Seems like a lot of older sleds for sale, lots of early 2000's with most having a fair number of miles on them. Is there a cut off for miles on certain sleds? Seems Yamahas have way more mile than most."
1077592,pics,2021-12-11 20:32:00,1268,There's a guy on  Facebook marketplace named Jake Loxton and he's located North of North Bay. He has a lot of sleds for sale and he seems to know his stuff.. prices are very high right now but if I was to get one a Yamaha or skidoo would be my preference..
1077596,Tjames09,2021-12-11 21:58:00,664,thanks. Seems like the Yamahas have anywhere from 15-20k miles on them
1077597,GBW,2021-12-11 23:36:00,8460,"Seeing as I work at a Ski-Doo/Can-Am/SeaDoo (BRP), Kawasaki, Suzuki dealer in the Kawartha's, watch the age as parts become End Of Life AND if it's not a very common part that an aftermarket company makes/made, you're pooched. 2-stroke full synthetic oil stock is SO low I can't even order stock to replace what we sell.  But lucky us we ordered well in advance of the current situation.  Sliders, only OEM left available as the Dupont's are not available till after March 2022.  Tracks, GOOD LUCK as there is a shortage there too from all brands!  Belts too are probably going to be harder to get sooner than later. Last fall we winterized 220 Seadoo's and this year over 450 units.  That's how crazy the world has gone in the past 18/24 months.  No stock, high demand, used selling for almost as much or more than new but no NEW to be had as it was all ordered, bought and paid for over 8 months ago for any product line. I wish you the best of luck in your search but please keep in mind of age (lack of old parts) and a shortage on the newer sought after stuff."
1077598,Tjames09,2021-12-12 00:13:00,664,Thanks for the reply. What age are we talking about when parts are no longer available? I was looking at early to mid 2000's (05-09).
1077599,GBW,2021-12-12 01:25:00,8460,Parts are only supported for 7 years from the 'model year' as a lucky average number to use.
1077603,AKRISONER,2021-12-12 02:05:00,5558,So many old yamadoos running they just don’t die. Stay the hell away from Polaris and don’t even bother looking at Arctic crap
1077604,Tjames09,2021-12-12 03:23:00,664,Oh wow...I haven't seen sleds for sale that new. Everything's early-mid 2000s.
1077605,Tjames09,2021-12-12 03:24:00,664,Not the bearcat?
1077606,chris.brock,2021-12-12 04:09:00,4053,"what do you mean ""ice fishing""? are you trying to bush crash into back lakes or just towing a pop up down the lake? IMO Yamaha is by far the best, polaris is 2nd, cat 3rd, skidoo is junk, whatever brand you pick stay away from high performance models, go for entry level, simple, basic, low performance stuff"
1077607,AKRISONER,2021-12-12 04:34:00,5558,"Unless you want a broken snowmobile, don’t buy Arctic cat"
1077614,Dara,2021-12-12 15:18:00,3052,They all need proper maintenance. Bearings and lubrication changes. 2 strokes don't take the miles a 4 stroke does Bad time to buy as everything is inflated but you gotta ride something Polaris even says pos right in the name. Arctic cats are pretty touchy too if you don't take good care of it
1077615,Tjames09,2021-12-12 15:22:00,664,"Just pull up to the lake. No backwoods bombing.  What's considered high mileage on a Yamaha? Im seeing lots for 15,000km+ It seems like a lot?"
1077625,Fisherman,2021-12-12 18:41:00,7201,"From a very reliable source, parts are hard to get even for newer sleds of any brand, the cost of tracks has virtually doubled, other parts are almost impossible to get.  Guys that have been ordering tracks from last spring to summer are still waiting.  The shop he works in has requests from all across the country.   when you go to buy, make sure it's not a basket case that needs a lot of work."
1077630,Tjames09,2021-12-12 20:32:00,664,Never owned a sled before lol. I won’t have a clue if somethings a dud or not
1077631,Fisherman,2021-12-12 21:26:00,7201,"Take a friend that knows sleds and their inner workings to help you inspect them.  Some of the things to be aware of are motor seals, too worn they suck air and make it run lean and burn.  Same for dirty carbs.  Worn bearings, same.  side to side movement, radial movement, same.  Secondary clutch bearings, same.  Track sliders for wear,  becoming hard to find, even after market ones because of supply problems.  Bogey bearings can still be found in stores that sell bearings.  There's a start."
1077633,Sharkbait22,2021-12-12 22:28:00,297,"Find a mid to late 2000 2 stroke with less than 5k km. Fan cooled 500. 4 stroke engines can have 20k km and be fine. Long track 2up is great. Get a toboggan to tow now before they are all gone, otherwise wait until next year. Used sled prices are almost double what they were pre covid. Sounds like parts are hard to come by so you need a ready to go sled. Educate yourself. Lots info on the net about ice fishing snowmobiles."
1077641,Tjames09,2021-12-13 02:49:00,664,Thanks. Ive already got a towable pelican with cover. I was trying to find a fan cooled 500. doesn't seem many come for sale
1077643,AKRISONER,2021-12-13 04:07:00,5558,"Depends if it’s a 2 or 4 stroke. A 4 stroke will go 20,000+ km do a compression test on the motor if you go and look at it. You can get a meter on Amazon. It’s a very simple process and will tell you if the motor is in operating shape or not. Basically if the compression is solid you don’t have a ton to worry about. everything else will be related to the track and suspension itself. there’s some pretty good YouTube videos on “what to check when buying a used snowmobile” they go pretty in depth, but for the most part the stuff they tell you to check is pretty straight forward"
1077646,Dara,2021-12-13 13:45:00,3052,"A couple months ago I went to a Ski Doo dealer looking for a new fishing sled. He said maybe I could get one next year if I order soon. Dealers are returning deposits from orders taken last spring due to inability to deliver. Makes the price of a used sled go up I have a Yamaha with 28,000 km on it. It was worth maybe 2 k 2years ago. Now I think I could get 6k But I'm not selling because then I wouldn't be fishing this year. Good luck.  Anything I see for sale right now is pretty much junk. And I kinda need a new track but can't find one"

1077688,porkpie,2021-12-14 17:06:00,2521,"I'm not sure how accurate the 7 years support is.  I have never had a problem getting parts, even factory parts many years after production.  Case in point we just recently obtained a factory new (from Polaris) water pump for a 1997 Indy touring 500 with just a bit of lead time for delivery  Also, while Polaris generally makes garbage ATV's, I've ridden and owned  Popo sleds, amongst others and it's about the only thing they do well.  The indy lite 340's in particular are gangbuster little fishing sleds!  I rode with a hunt camp full of guys that wouldn't touch a Polaris bike if you paid them because every one we had in the camp broke down at some point, but they where all riding polaris in the winter with few exceptions."
