1077526,Northerner1212,2021-12-08 00:57:00,23,Iâ€™m looking for real world opinions on running 100ah lithium on my 12volt terrova has anyone done this if so how was the outcome thanks
1077528,OhioFisherman,2021-12-08 02:50:00,6623,"https://www.minnkotamotors.com/support/faqs/can-i-use-lithium-ion-batteries-my-minn-kota-trolling-motor I don't see a date on that, so changes unknown?"
1077534,410001661,2021-12-08 23:01:00,127,"The issue with the Lithium Ion batteries is the cost of them - they are just shy of $1,000/each.Â  I do not think they are there just yet - price wise.Â  I am also running a 12V TM but I am going to buy two Costco 27M 120AH MarineÂ  Batteries $169.99/each and wire them in parallel.Â  I can replace this system 2.7 times for the cost of one Lithium Ion battery."
1077538,BillM,2021-12-08 23:32:00,17367,"My opinion.. Too expensive, need a specific charger, no warning of the battery going dead, it just dies.Â  Not there yet, but I'm sure some day they will be."
1077546,DRIFTER_016,2021-12-09 17:04:00,10439,There is also new battery tech coming out that is supposed to out perform lithium. 
1077549,Terry,2021-12-09 19:19:00,14456,Would that be solid star batteries or Aluminum-IonÂ  they seem to be two of the top contenders
1077552,misfish,2021-12-09 19:38:00,29133,"Figures. I buy my first lithum battery, and new stuff coming out. ðŸ˜† ðŸ¤£"
1077553,Terry,2021-12-09 19:50:00,14456,Everything I have seen is at least 2 years Â or more away from production
1077558,Fisherman,2021-12-09 21:28:00,7201,"If Australia can make this happen with sending production to you know where, they will have a pretty good business. https://graphenemg.com/energy-storage-solutions/aluminum-ion-battery/"
1077563,Terry,2021-12-09 22:28:00,14456,What I like about them is it charges about 60 x faster then lithium. I know they are saying 70 but everything I read up to now said up to 60
1077569,Fisherman,2021-12-10 00:32:00,7201,Even 10X would be fantastic and the price much lower.
