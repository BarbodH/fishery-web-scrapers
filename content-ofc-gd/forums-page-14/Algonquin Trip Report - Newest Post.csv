1075454,gordy28,2021-08-12 16:02:00,638,Thanks!  And for sure.  I think I forgot to include my age and weight of the gear into my equation lol.  But was worth it Andrew
1075485,RayK,2021-08-14 13:47:00,25,"Great Trip Report Andrew! There’s nothing like venturing into Algonquin’s backcountry with good friends. Portages can certainly be tough if you have a bunch “just in case” gear. 	I’ve been going every spring since 2010 for the trout, except the past 2 due to COVID closures. I’m turning 64 this week, and will keep returning, until I can’t."
1075508,akaShag,2021-08-16 20:17:00,2073,"Good report. But you are still YOUNG, for God's sake!!!!!!! Algonquin is awesome, and there are better lakes that will cough up trout, even for newbies - or, I guess I have to admit, there USED TO BE such lakes.  I have not dipped a paddle in Algonquin for a couple decades.............🙄  Shoot me a note for a couple ideas, mind you the one had a portage that was a hair over a kilometre.  But once you are past such a portage, all the wannabes are eating your dust, it separates the men from the boys so to speak. Doug"
1075536,gordy28,2021-08-17 16:45:00,638,Thanks - and for sure - I think we can definitely cut down on some gear if we decide to tackle a longer portage Lol - for sure - I only meant old in the sense that the last time I was there I was younger and in better shape  - will definitely hit you up Doug - I think we are going to return next year for sure Cheers Andrew
