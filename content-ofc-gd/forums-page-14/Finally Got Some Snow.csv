I cleaned my driveway and did my neighbour's business as we share the driveway onto the road plus they let me work inside where it's warm, on my toys in the winter. Took between 1 and 1 1/2 hours to do the whole job. Used to take me that just to do my place with the snow blower. Almost forgot, the heated seats and heater worked awesome!!! Blue dot is the entrance to my garage the SxS sits in (as well as my boat).  The area inside the poorly drawn red area is the area I cleaned up today. 😊  And the toy in all it's glory.  😁  Won't be too long before I'm plowing the ice road out to my cabin.  👍"
