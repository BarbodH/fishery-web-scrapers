1076939,captpierre,2021-11-06 01:30:00,2521,Got this sent to me on FB. Apparently been around since 2017. Anybody know anything about them?  
1076941,Sinker,2021-11-06 14:48:00,8692,Just buy a snowmobile. 
1076945,Terry,2021-11-06 18:04:00,14456,"It’s a snowdog clone don’t need insurance or license it has its place, real good for early ice and late ice "
1076948,Fisherman,2021-11-06 21:34:00,7201,Appear to be a bunch cheaper than the Snow dog.
1076949,Terry,2021-11-06 22:01:00,14456,Do you mean price or quality edit: never mind I look at the price of a new snowdog. Wow the price sure went crazy
1076950,Fisherman,2021-11-06 23:47:00,7201,Price. 
1076991,porkpie,2021-11-09 13:52:00,2521,What he said!
1077026,Sinker,2021-11-10 19:50:00,8692,"I think the husky was around a long time ago, but just came back into production. I could be wrong, but there used to be a similar unit called a husky back in the day. Either way, for the price of either, you could have a decent used sled.  S."
1077027,Fisherman,2021-11-10 19:55:00,7201,Back in the late '60's http://www.gogodiablo.com/wp-content/uploads/hus-ski-200-115-300x225.jpg
1077029,Sinker,2021-11-10 20:03:00,8692,"Yep, that's the one."
1077031,Terry,2021-11-10 20:18:00,14456,"Yup I remember that one well, rode on some of them back in the day"
1077032,misfish,2021-11-10 21:58:00,29133,"Last winter off the 9th, I seen some oldies . They were owned by some russian fellas. These things were not new. If you youtube russian ice fishing sleds,you will see some real neat rides for ice fishing."
1077033,DanD,2021-11-10 22:02:00,2223,Buy used or buy new? Buy on the word of an individual or buy from a manufacturer that must give some form of warrantee. Any machine can break; but for a purpose built machine why not go new? Just questions not a rebuttal.
1077054,Sinker,2021-11-11 21:07:00,8692,"I'd buy a used sled. Way more versatile, and much better unit. I've used the snowdog, and they are OK for going A to B on the lake, but hit a hill, or slight slope coming off the lake, and they turn into a nightmare pretty quick. Just my opinion, but I'm not a fan.  S."
