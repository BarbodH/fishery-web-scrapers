1077311,misfish,2021-11-24 21:31:00,29133,"WOW WOW WOW What a deal I got on these new winter waders. They are basically hunting waders, but they will work for river fishing. Got them at the online auction here in Barrie. I always look on amazon, so I know what retail price is. I always set a price I will pay and wait til the final day . If I want something bad enough,I will compete bid . These I did not have to. I set a price at $75 and won them. Retail is $275 .  I can not wait to wear these in the cold waters. They are quilted inside. They are so warm and soft . Boots are lined like a slipper . Cleated as well. Extra wear material on the butt and legs. Breathable . 6 days off coming up,so I will get to try them out.        "

1077314,DanD,2021-11-24 23:22:00,2223,Holly crap. If I didn't read your text; I would have thought I was looking at a new style of sleeping bag; let alone fancy waders. Big difference from my 20+ year old neoprene's and I thought they were great. As fancy as they are (not because of what you paid);¬†but would you like some Grey Poupon to dip your snack in Sir.¬†As the butler (in his noeprene's) walks away. LOL Good on you for finding the deal you wanted! Dan..

1077345,Sinker,2021-11-25 20:08:00,8692,Ive heard these are very good waders. They also have a battery powered heated pair. Pretty slick. S.
1077347,misfish,2021-11-25 21:32:00,29133,"Yes,I seen those on line. There are many great reviews on these waders on youtube.¬† Mostly American duck hunters ."
1077367,DanD,2021-11-26 23:59:00,2223, Sorry reread that post a number of times and must have a mental block? What kind of American hunters that are in need of something warm and coozy? (Coozy not a spelling mistake LOL) Dan.

1077393,DanD,2021-11-28 19:29:00,2223,"It was a joke.üòÅ Google the ""meaning of coozy"" Wish there was some form of ice anywhere near us that's fishable. Dan."
