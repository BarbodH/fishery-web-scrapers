1077343,Sinker,2021-11-25 20:04:00,8692,"Yep, I've been that way for at least 30 years. I rarely even consider fishing from duck opener unitl ice up. Before that, I would cry because I was too ""young"" to go on the cold days with my old man. I was dragged through the marsh from about 5 years old, and still to this day, love it more than anything else. I got my license the day I turned 16, and haven't looked back.  S."

1077346,akaShag,2021-11-25 20:30:00,2073,"Once upon a time when I was a working stiff and did not have a lot of time off, fall meant steelheading, bow-hunting and duck hunting.Â  You can't really do all three, at least not in any reasonable way.Â  First to go was duck hunting, then steelheading.Â  I had a really good run of fall steelheading, but could still do that in the spring, so I did.Â  And I had a heck of a run with the bow, probably forty deer or so.Â  Maybe more, I lost track........ Now I am a retired old fart, and can do whatever I want.Â  And I hardly do ANY of those things any more!!!Â  So enjoy it while you are fairly young and vigorous! Doug"
1077368,Freshtrax,2021-11-27 04:46:00,2215,I know of a few wheelchair accessible blinds.Â  My kids better be wheeling me out. If you ever want to get out shag. I'm shure a few of us could put it together.Â  Misfish could you pop a 410 with your eyes? Just packed the truck headed out in the morning...
1077376,akaShag,2021-11-27 20:15:00,2073,"That's mighty kind of you, and thanks!Â  I am not the fit young man I once was, but I can still do pretty much anything I want to.Â  I hunted the full two weeks of rifle season for deer, and will be hunting the smokepole season this coming week.Â  But a lot of the stuff I used to do is really a young person's game.Â  Like wading in ice cold water up above your family jewels, on a slippery bottom and with a strong current, for example.............same thing for wading out in a swamp to recover downed ducks and geese. I hope you had a good shoot this morning! Doug (aka Shag)"
1077379,misfish,2021-11-27 20:48:00,29133,"I am sure I could, but not worth the risk. I am thinking of getting another .22. Packing out squirrels, aint alot of weight.LOL"
1077380,akaShag,2021-11-27 21:47:00,2073,and they are delicious!
1077428,CPH,2021-12-01 16:59:00,11,"Duck hunting is definitely addictive. Years ago in my 20's I too got up at 3 am loaded up the hunting gear and drove to Valens to secure a stand before others got there and sometimes spending the night in the parking lot in my van just to get a stand. Even a broken leg would not stop me. Full length leg cast and friends to carry me to the stand. ( I had a great black Lab that would retrieve ducks so the broken leg was no problem). Like anything though, with age and work and growing kids things tend to fall by the way side and so did my duck hunting.Â All the stories bring back memories and very enjoyable.Â Now I'm semi-retired, my son is in his early twenties and keen on hunting and fishing. Its time to start some serious hunting again and catching up with one another. No better place to do that then on a hunting or fishing trip together.   "
1076900,ckewley,2021-11-04 09:23:00,699,"It's been a very long road for me but I've finally made it. This past weekend I tried my hand at a little duck hunting, not successful I might add but did walk away with a couple courtesy of my hunting partner, a Blue Bill & a Wood Duck.Â  Then a few evenings ago went went out again only this time I had dialled things in a bit & walked away with my first 3 ducks, a Ring Neck, Blue Bill & Teal Wing. I gotta say I'm extremely hooked now & find myself quite lucky as Cooks Bay is now steps from my home so evening hunts or fishing is within my grasp. Now the long road of collecting gear is ahead of me. Speaking of gear, can anyone suggest a good store, besides the big box stores, that have a good supply of stuff & friendly folks?Â  Oh and any good recipes for duck? I can taste the difference between the Divers & Puddle, although I haven't got one of the really fishy Divers yet.   "
1076901,misfish,2021-11-04 09:41:00,29133,"WTG Bud. I to, when started, was totally hooked after my first take down. Sold all my stuff when I had the retina detachment. Really miss it. Visit the wolfsden. https://wolfsdensports.com/  EDIT TO ADD  Stay away from the fishy taste ducks. YUKKKKKKKK"
1076915,ckewley,2021-11-04 16:11:00,699,"Thanks Brian, I'll definitely give Wolfs Den a look."
1076919,Thrilla,2021-11-05 00:59:00,164,Welcome to the addiction
1076993,porkpie,2021-11-09 14:05:00,2521,"Donâ€™t shoot the long white ducks with the green heads and long beaks. Â That will be an eating experience you will never forget or want to replicate! Â And Â Buying hunting gear from small shops is getting harder everywhere unfortunately. Â We only have a few small shops out my way and some of the better ones have closed down. Â I deal with Clinton sporting goods Â and do most of my business for shooting, reloading and hunting gear with him, great shop and owner is awesome to deal with, plus my range is just down the street so I get there every time I go shooting.Â But thatâ€™s a heck of a long way from cooks bay and I donâ€™t know if he ships. Â I have also done a lot of business with Elwood Epps for over 25 years and have never been disappointed with them. Â I stop in every time when we are heading to our place up North. Â Best place in Ontario for used firearms selection. Â Also in the Orillia area is Tromblyâ€™s tackle box. Â The owner Remi is a stand up guy and old hunting buddy of mine. Â Very good selection and a nice shop to look around, with a lot of selection. Â Thatâ€™d be where I look. Â Between Tromblyâ€™s, Epps and Wolfs Den you should cover all your bases!"
1077008,Rizzo,2021-11-10 00:12:00,4754,Those are definitely some dead ducks you got there. Enjoy your new hobby!
1077028,Sinker,2021-11-10 20:02:00,8692,"Waterfowling is my #1 addiction. Good luck paying your bills from now on LOL....seriously.... I've been playing that game since I was just a kid tagging along with my old man, now I have had to build an extra large shed just for some of the gear. Its rediculous. There's no place I'd rather be than in a marsh at daylight though. Its something special just being there. Search for used gear on marketplace etc.....One thing I will tell you from a lot of experience is you don't need fancy gear to kill ducks. Just get lots S."
1077044,ckewley,2021-11-11 15:26:00,699,"Thanks for Wolfs Den Brian, I went there this past weekend a bought my first shotgun. A used one but it cycles well so I'm set to go until the world gets back to production. Apparently firearms & ammunition is in very short supply so I'm OK with waiting a bit now until I can get the one I really want. Thanks Porkpie, when I started down this road I really wanted to get out and learn from experienced (& ethical) hunters, count myself very lucky I have a few in my friend pile. I know it will take me years yet to gain the eyesight my buddy has as he can pick out the birds miles off & know what type they are. I've been lucky to nail some Blue bills, Teals, Ringnecks & Woodies thus far, Mallards have stayed well outside my reach (geese too). (thanks for Epps, I completely forgot about them, I will check out Trombly's) Yes Sinker I can see this getting out of hand but as I said I'm quite lucky that I have a few friends I can go with that will keep costs down....for now at least. Thanks for the marketplace idea"
1077046,porkpie,2021-11-11 16:25:00,2521,"Have fun, hunting is a rewarding activity even when your not successful!. Â Marketplace idea is very good as well, also kijiji. Â I picked up 4 ladder stands in good condition for our place up north this year for less than half the cost of newâ€¦ Â Sinker is correct, you donâ€™t need new or latest and greatest to be successful. Â Just about everything I own, from fishing to hunting gear has been bought used in very good to excellent condition including most of my firearms. Â There is a deal around every corner if your paying attention!!"
1077055,misfish,2021-11-11 21:28:00,29133,"To bad you did not post you were looking, I have 4 up at my pops doing nothing. Unless my brothers scooped them up."
1077059,porkpie,2021-11-11 22:56:00,2521,Iâ€™ll send you a messageâ€¦. Iâ€™m not looking right now but I havenâ€™t managed to survey the whole place as yet and I might want a couple more once I figure out the right spots!
1077060,misfish,2021-11-11 23:08:00,29133,"If they are still there, they are yours,FREE. Well maybe a spot for me for archery hunting.LOL"
1077062,porkpie,2021-11-12 00:17:00,2521,"Thatâ€™s pretty generous buddy, you can archery hunt if you want but itâ€™s in WMU 41 and doe tags are 40 percent draw odds and deer herds are skinny compared to down here LOL. Bears arenâ€™t a problem though LOL Come for a coffee in the spring and Iâ€™ll get the map out and show you some things out my way too!"
1077145,akaShag,2021-11-15 20:13:00,2073,Dibs on any leftovers?
1077189,porkpie,2021-11-18 22:05:00,2521,"You should send Brian a PM. Â He kindly offered me all 4, but that is more than I can use so itâ€™d be nice if someone else can utilize them!"
1077192,akaShag,2021-11-18 22:13:00,2073,"Thanks.Â  He and I ""know"" each other, so I reckon he will be in touch if he still has something to donate to a worthy cause.Â  ðŸ˜‰"

1077203,misfish,2021-11-19 21:58:00,29133,They are up at Burksfalls Doug.

1077255,porkpie,2021-11-22 03:05:00,2521,Gotchaâ€¦ was thinking Kitchener and maybe Iâ€™d be able to help him out!
1077264,Freshtrax,2021-11-22 15:38:00,2215,I have already told you this but Congrats!Â  Â Over the last 5 years or so Waterfowling as become my number 1 obsession.Â  Â I Still love fishing but there's something about being In the marsh and hearing and seeing the world spring I to life at sunrise.Â  Â  All my fishing buddiesÂ  don't even call sept - Jan any more.  
1077327,ckewley,2021-11-25 10:34:00,699,"Absolutely man. It was nothing for me to get up at 3am and drive for 3-4 hrs for the morning bite fishing! I can see me getting up at 1-2am and doing the same for hunting birds. I am truly amazed at this world! I would never have thought birds to be ""smart"" but they have definitely out smarted me more than a few times. Doubt I'll use the word Birdbrain as a negative again."
