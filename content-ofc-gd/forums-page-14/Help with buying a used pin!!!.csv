1077791,Mackenzie,2021-12-22 04:31:00,1,Hey guys looking at buying this used kingpin 525 r2. Anything to look for or be weary of in particular? I'm getting it for a bargain so I'm a little skeptical. The guys over the river so ill have it shipped. All tips and tricks appreciated. Thanks

Side note, I am not impressed the way he has it all taped up like that.Â  I like to be able to remove my reels for regular cleaning. Hope it works out to be a deal for you."
1077793,Ralph Field,2021-12-22 13:50:00,1018,"Kingpin reels are as good as any pin. As misfish mentioned any rock rash greatly reduces the value of the reel. I can't see any in the photos, but they don't show the rim. Without inspecting the reel as already mentioned it's a crap shoot."
1077794,misfish,2021-12-22 14:17:00,29133,"Not sure if it.s just me, but when you enlarge the top pic ,looks like wear where the clicker/spring is. Also see debrie or something. How old is the reel?"
1077798,DRIFTER_016,2021-12-22 18:37:00,10439,The joy of sliding rings!!! Better to tape them like this as they tend to fall off otherwise.Â Â ðŸ˜‰
1077799,misfish,2021-12-22 19:01:00,29133,"Na, just a bit behind the ring is lots. I am now a seat guy. Took me many years. LOL"
1077806,BillM,2021-12-23 00:15:00,17367,That's a wee bit overboard with the electrical tape. 
1077814,Spiel,2021-12-23 21:41:00,9065,I hate seeing electrical tape on rod handles. ðŸ˜Ÿ
1077816,Bill Shearer,2021-12-23 22:21:00,456,"That 1st generation R2 475 is a great reel, and about the only thing that can go wrong with them is the ratchet spring, ( Easy to replace) and the bearings. Should it need service I'm only an email or phone call away. https://www.kingpinreels.com/contact"
