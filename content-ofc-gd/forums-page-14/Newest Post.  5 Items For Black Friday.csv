1077418,pics,2021-12-01 01:25:00,1268,My main Television went just before Black Friday..ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜ªðŸ¤¬.... I went and got one on the Thursday night since the price is the same the next day anyways.Â  That took the wind out of my sails and I avoided any fishing flyers because I'm tapped out for the year ðŸ¤·.. my wish list isn't too long but I'd love to get a downrigger and aÂ  new trolling motor battery $$$.. ðŸ˜€
