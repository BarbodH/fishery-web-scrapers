350961,richyb,2009-06-11 02:52:00,774,"  Yes you have to cut them to see how many rings there are. .................  sheephead have huge odoliths, bluegills and smaller fish are maybe 1/4"" long"
350962,Jonny,2009-06-11 03:00:00,1380,"I can see clear banding in one of them. The picture shows it pretty well too.  Drum apparently live to about 10 yrs old. I can make out about 5 rings. I know that's not scientific like cutting it open, but maybe the fish was about 5 yrs old?"
350970,Beats,2009-06-11 03:40:00,543,"I'd say that's a good assessment.  I can see rings on your pics.  Unless you feel like doing this again, I'd say 5 yrs is close enough and wouldn't bother cutting it open."
350975,Jonny,2009-06-11 03:50:00,1380," And if i do it again, I take it that pictures won't be necessary?  You're right, ball park is close enough.  I don't catch a large drum every day, and I probably would have regretted not checking first-hand into something that I've heard about for so long. Just as I would have regretted not trying the taste of drum (see the other drum thread). I figured if catfish and even ling can taste so good, why not drum?"
351339,adempsey,2009-06-12 03:59:00,1498,I used to collect these at the beach along Lake Erie as a kid.
351485,Jonny,2009-06-12 20:23:00,1380, Now that's really interesting. Are you sure they were otoliths? The reason I'm asking is that the otoliths are inside the very hard bony structure of the skull of the drum and they're very hard to get out of there.
351561,wpoplar,2009-06-13 01:37:00,5,"You don't have to dig them out of a fish.  On Lake Erie we call them lucky stones, because of the L on one side, and collect them on the beaches.  They are usually found at the waters edge in the sand.  There color is pearl white against the sand making them fairly easy to see.  When we anchor our boat near a beach we always try to find at least one to keep as a memory of the trip.  We have a whole jar full now and many fond memories."
351614,Jonny,2009-06-13 03:30:00,1380,"I'm definitely no expert on otoliths. It just seemed to me that any forces that would destroy the bone around them would have a good chance of destroying the otoliths too. Obviously, if they're being found on beaches, they must be pretty durable."
351617,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-13 03:39:00,0,"those are big otoliths!  i don't know why they'd be removed just for fun but to each his own... a real challenge is removing a brookie otolith, although i sure hope someone wouldn't do this just for fun."
351728,aplumma,2009-06-13 22:06:00,6896,Why in the hell are you all rifting someone for opening up a fish and checking out something that has a legend behind it. He decided to see what was inside of the fish and then shared it with all of us curing my and others interest in what the stones look like. It is healthy to want to see what is inside of or over the next hill... it is called curiosity and along with having thumbs it is what makes us top of the food chain. For all who say nay then you have not enough curiosity and are doomed to be sheep and follow blindly for the rest of your unadventurous lives.  All of this over one fish's life... go fishin folks   Art
351742,motv8tr,2009-06-13 23:45:00,2587,"Huh, never heard of them before, interesting stuff,  I assume all fish have them?  Thanks for the lesson JPJ  Maureen"
351782,Fish Farmer,2009-06-14 02:32:00,2234,"As a kid we used to cut them out. As mentioned above they called them Lucky Stones because of the L on them. I used to lay them above my BINGO cards while playing bingo. Don't ask me how I made out. Some reason, I don't think I should have said I played ""Bingo"" (Spiel)"
498582,IndySKS,2010-08-26 11:19:00,134,About 25 years ago i was visiting a friend on the north shore of Nippissing and caught my first sheephead. My buddy dug the stones out for me and told me the story how they were good luck. I put them in my camera case and they have been there ever since.  Never thought of making ear rings out of them but i might just do that and pass them along to my grand daughter.
498614,canadadude,2010-08-26 13:47:00,769,"All fish have Otoliths there used for balance and orientation for the fish, Drum have exceptionally large Otoliths.There made of a calcium substance and will do not degrade as fast as bone so yes you can find them on the beaches after the skull degrades.There also not digestable so they are found in other fisheaters scat."
498659,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-08-26 15:53:00,0,"Personally I always found them easiest to access underneath.  A small incision on the palette of the roof of the mouth, then you grab it and crack it at the incision exposing the otolith.  When you have to do a gill net full of lake trout, you learn to be quick..."
499083,lhousesoccer,2010-08-27 17:38:00,442,"Dr. Salvelinus is right.  The easiest way to access them is from underneath.  Here's a series of pictures I took to train my summer fisheries technicians to extract otoliths from walleye for aging.  In this case, we started with just the head, as the bodies had already been removed for contaminant and pathogen biopsies.   The first step is to take a pair of dissecting scissors and cut through the isthmus (the fleshy part underneath the fish's jaws between the gill covers).  Cut down behind the gill arches and separate where the gill arches connect to the upper palate of the fish.  You can leave the gill arches connected to the fish towards the front of the head, or cut there as well and completely remove the gills.   Once the gill arches are removed, you'll see a ""V"" formation, where the cartilage surrounding the spinal column joins with the upper palate of the inside of the the fish's mouth.  This spot gets snipped with a small pair of wire cutters.   You don't want to snip too deep, because the otoliths are directly underneath this.  You only want to open up the cartilage area to reveal the spinal column where it attaches to the brain stem.  The otoliths are in small sacs of fluid at this juncture.  Can you see them inside the spinal column in this picture?   If not, these arrows point out the otoliths inside.   The next step is to take a pair of fine dissecting scissors and make a small snip in the cartilage.  Then grasp the fish head with your thumb and index finger of your left hand just ahead of the snipped spot, and just behind it the same way with your right.  Bend the fish in half, with the flex point being where you made the snip, as if you were breaking a stick.   After this step, you should be staring directly at the otoliths.   Here they are: "

499107,jbailey,2010-08-27 18:31:00,866,oh wow that was quite the bio lesson! very interesting!
350766,Jonny,2009-06-10 18:53:00,1380,"I had heard about these, but never seen one. Their purpose seems to be to give the fish balance.  Apparently native people used to think they had some mystical power. People nowadays sometimes use them for jewelry. Supposedly they're the closest thing to ivory in a fish.  These otoliths, from about a 7 lb. drum, are about the size of a nickel, and in texture and weight they feel like broken pieces of river pebble, not bone.  I found an internet site that showed a diagram of how to remove them, so I decided to try it. You have to cut the head exactly in half longitudinally - quite a chore, even with a heavy hunting knife. When you've done that you can make out the pockets that the otoliths are in (marked in the photo). Clear away a bit of very soft tissue and you can gently work them out with the tip of your knife.  A couple of pics I took:  "

350787,Jonny,2009-06-10 19:20:00,1380, Meaning..... ?
350788,Nemo,2009-06-10 19:21:00,727,Then what do you do with them?
350790,Jonny,2009-06-10 19:25:00,1380," I dunno.  Make a pair of earrings?  I know of at least one lodge on Nipissing that will cut them out for you if you want them. Souvenir, I guess."
350792,Bob,2009-06-10 19:27:00,370,"Put them in a tumbler to polish them, drill a hole in each and string them like beads.  Or make earings."
350794,troutologist,2009-06-10 19:30:00,951,Age your own sheepshead? What otoliths are really used for  To each their own bud...Ive dissected enough of these for various studies that I wouldn't do it for kicks
350800,Jonny,2009-06-10 19:45:00,1380," Yes, I learned that by searching around, but I wouldn't want to destroy one by cutting it apart.   I can see why!  Well it's the first I've ever tried it, and maybe the last if I don't use them for anything. Kind of interesting when it's a first-time thing, but I can see that the novelty might fade pretty fast unless you used something like a bandsaw!  ---  Bob, wouldn't a tumbler break the edges?"
350814,Lungelarry,2009-06-10 20:55:00,294,Probably another animal part that's supposed to give you a super hard-on  :D  :D  :D  :D

350880,Jonny,2009-06-10 23:44:00,1380," Yeah, Roy, it does look like a butcher shop in that one photo. I couldn't think of another way to show how it's done. I visited some sites where it was only described or diagrammed and they were of limited help.  Cutting up any animal is not my favourite thing to do, and this was a little more distasteful than just filleting a fish, for some reason. But like they say, ""You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs"".  Cutting the antlers off a moose or deer is no fun either.  ---  No, John, no parrot. I don't want to be stereotyped."
350883,love2fishhave2work,2009-06-10 23:51:00,212,I think Hannibal started his career in a similar way.
350885,Spiel,2009-06-10 23:55:00,9065,Well that was interesting. You know I've known of these otoliths (we just called 'em stones) since I was a kid and never once did I actually go in and dig 'em out and I think now I know why.   Thanks for the anatomy lesson JPJ.
350893,bigugli,2009-06-11 00:22:00,6138,"The 'stones' from salt water drum were used inside rattles, at one time, in the Caribbean."

350947,richyb,2009-06-11 02:26:00,774,"I think all fish have them , at fleming we took odoliths from the odd dead bluegill, pumpkin seed , walleye caught in our nets. If you use a diamond edged cutting tool you can cut them in half and use a microscope to check the fish's age. They have rings like a tree."
350953,Jonny,2009-06-11 02:32:00,1380,I think the thing about drum otoliths is that they're so large.
350954,mikeh,2009-06-11 02:35:00,824,I was just wondering how many rings it had? do you have to cut them in half to see the rings? just curious as I don't see myself doing it anytime soon.
350959,Bob,2009-06-11 02:46:00,370,Cleans the edges off for sure but they are nice looking when they're done.  Don't put heavy stuff in the tumbler with them.
