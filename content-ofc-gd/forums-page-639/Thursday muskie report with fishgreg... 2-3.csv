496661,Fisherpete,2010-08-21 01:17:00,1814,"Fishgreg and I headed out to try another round of muskie fishing. The day started out slowly, no muskies for the first few hours, se we did a bit of bassing. Greg caught a decent smallie near a dock.    We resumed muskie fishing, and it was slow. Greg had a hit, but she broke the surface and was off. Not a big fish, but enough to get us pumped up again. Around 1pm, the sky went black, and in the distance we saw a bolt of lightening strike the hills... so we packed up and headed towards the launch. Soon after, a cold wind hit us, and the lake whipped into whitecaps faster than I have ever seen. Then came the rain - so hard that it hurt! After what seemed like forever and soaked to the bone, we arrived at the ramp. I pulled the boat out, and we decided to wait it out a bit to see if it would clear. Ten minutes later, the storm broke, and clear sunny skies resumed! I had checked the forecast, there was supposed to be no rain... grrr....  Back to fishing. About an hour later, the first ski was landed by yours truly, around a 34 or so. Once again, the Disco Perch produced.     Two hours later, I had my second of the day, another mid 30's fish. She was hooked perfectly - and I released her without using the net. Here you go folks, the lucky lure, aka DISCO PERCH has been unveiled - and is approved by disco Stu!    Another three hours went by without a sniff... so we packed up and headed out. Pretty tough day overall, maybe the weather had something to do with it. Oh well, at least no skunkage! Sorry you didn't get one today Greg, you threw everything at them!"
496671,bongo,2010-08-21 01:42:00,67,"Hey Pete, I've seen so many reports by you. The Muskie sure seem to like you man, way to go on the fish. Do you sorta live close to the lakes you fish, seems you get out a lot??"
496690,rbaquial,2010-08-21 03:42:00,968,"Damn dude!! I need to go out and catch a musky myself! Never caught one, but got all my own gear!  NICE REPORT!!  SICK LURE!"
496699,Dozer,2010-08-21 08:44:00,896,"Nice fsh and quite the interesting way of hiding the lure, haha"
496707,Andy,2010-08-21 11:28:00,330,"Aahaa!! I see that your magical lure has a treble hook! It's only a matter of time now before someone figures out your mystery lure. Seriously, a lot of people (me included) would call your slow day a good weekend. I am impressed with your productivity on the water.  Andy"
496718,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 12:54:00,0,"Well you cant win em all. Like you said...At least a few fish were caught in the boat. Jeff has also been doing average without me. He needs my expertise.lol  Nice smallie Greg. I keep telling Jeff I want to figure out the smallies in that lake. I want to target smallies all day!  Anyways, thanks for sharing and by the way guys?I know Pete's secret lure. But the secret is not in the lure. Its the Mc'chicken sauce he puts ON the lure.lol"
496769,Fisherpete,2010-08-21 16:39:00,1814,"Johnny, the McChicken sauce only works on channel cats... muskies prefer Big Mac sauce by far.  I do live fairly close to several of the Kawartha lakes guys, and do my own schedule at work... I also prefer weekday fishing anyway, and get out at least once a week. Lately the wifey has been really good to me, and I have been getting out even more! What more can I say, my name is Fisherpete and I have a muskie problem!"
496782,ontariofisherman,2010-08-21 17:36:00,52,"share that problem, maybe we need to have an intervention for you. lol"
496993,Gregoire,2010-08-22 12:53:00,1397,"It was a good day out, even though I couldn't boat a ski. Pete is a great guy to fish with. He is dialed in right now. Thanks for a great day on the water. I love the disco perch pic.  For me the disco ball says it all.  ""I am disco perch and I like disco music."" I guess the ski's like a little disco as well."
498085,cpguy29,2010-08-25 02:25:00,148,"  We caught 2 average sized musky last night, along with an 18"" walleye."
498221,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-25 15:10:00,0, There you go. The Musky fishing is slowing down. Every musky has been stung on that lake already.  You'll get em next time Greg. This fall is going to be great for musky!
498223,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-25 15:15:00,932, A great report as always Pete.  It really does help having a lady that understands.  Mine doesn't complain when I hit the water 4 or 5 times a week.  It makes things a lot easier.
498519,Leecher,2010-08-26 02:00:00,7832,That is a nice size perch on the last pic Some nice gators Pete   Congrats Thanks for sharing Leechman
