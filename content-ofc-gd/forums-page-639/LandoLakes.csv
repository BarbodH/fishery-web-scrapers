498874,ttreacy,2010-08-27 00:46:00,19,We are looking at cottages in the LandoLakes area and Limerick Lake has caught our interest.  Does anyone have experience on this lake and any that are part of the chain?
498909,fish-miester,2010-08-27 01:48:00,864,well if its anything like the other lakes around the area its a beautiful place with some beauty fish to be caught! (born and raised up there)

Have always heard that Mephisto Lake (accessed from the north end of Limerick) has some exceptional bass fishing, but never had the time to make it in there, so much water to fish on Limerick itself."
