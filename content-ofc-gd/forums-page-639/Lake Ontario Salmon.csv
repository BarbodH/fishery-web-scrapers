498720,a.cortellessa,2010-08-26 18:36:00,142,For the pier and river anglers out there! Are the salmon starting to move in with all this rain? Close enough to catch them from the piers?  Thanks a lot!
498723,highdrifter,2010-08-26 18:45:00,2534,Lemme guess..  It's an hour drive to your nearest pier?!?!
498728,a.cortellessa,2010-08-26 18:56:00,142,About half an hour maybe. I just have saturday morning to get out so I don't wanna go to the piers and there be nothing there. Know what I mean?
498729,John,2010-08-26 19:00:00,2956, I got 3 last night on a 5/0 treble and pink marshmallow.
498731,a.cortellessa,2010-08-26 19:04:00,142,That's amazing!! Any pics? . I'm new to pier fishing so I'm just learning everything.
498732,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-26 19:10:00,932, You don't have to worry about nothing being there . . . they'll be plenty there.  Whether any of the life there has fins or not is anyone's guess.
498735,a.cortellessa,2010-08-26 19:16:00,142,"ahah, yeah you never know! Are you suggesting that there will be Salmon or just a mere joke about the pollution in lake Ontario?"
498738,danbouck,2010-08-26 19:27:00,4380,"Don't bother taking a rod, just a net will do"
498739,ketchenany,2010-08-26 19:27:00,3229, I'm sure Billsthebassman is referring to the number of people (no fins) that will be there. You best get out really early to get a good spot.
498754,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-26 19:58:00,932, 
498758,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-26 20:01:00,932,"   Dan, you've really been making me laugh on these salmon threads - kudos.  Someone should film a ""fishing"" show at the rivers when the Salmon run, if Dave Mercer did it, it would be epic!"
498760,tdotfisherman,2010-08-26 20:03:00,317,"I'm going out for Lake Ontario Salmon tonight..  If I catch one, I'll post a report, and if I don't, I won't"
498775,chessy,2010-08-26 20:31:00,610,the river is plum full of salmon at port hope .. my son has made a killing down there so far he has found a fillet knife and 3  10 .00 repalas keep it up and i wont have to buy him nothing for christmas ..  the snaggers were out in full force there were 4 down there and they were so proud of there snagging they took  pictures of there catch then released them .. i had my finger in the mnr tips line ... mabey next time
498795,danbouck,2010-08-26 21:02:00,4380,   You gave me an idea!
498806,cuzza,2010-08-26 21:51:00,467," WTH?? Snagging to keep it, while inexcusable still makes more sense than snagging then releasing it"
498887,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-27 01:21:00,932, I'm not sure if a WFN Vlog will work
498888,danbouck,2010-08-27 01:22:00,4380, I'm shooting the 3rd episode of a fishing show shortly and you gave me an idea for #4
498894,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-27 01:34:00,932," Sweet, but toss me some on air props!"
