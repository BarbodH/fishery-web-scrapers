498912,Musky or Specks,2010-08-27 01:50:00,2710,Steelhead are an introduced species can't support giving them and lamprey more access. And by that I mean no different than carp.
498915,buckysteel,2010-08-27 01:57:00,12,"Don't really care much bout the steelies, more so about water quality and overall watershed stability."
498924,buckysteel,2010-08-27 02:01:00,12,I do see where your coming from though. Local walleye also have a vested interest here as do other native species.
498925,Musky or Specks,2010-08-27 02:01:00,2710,Please
498931,buckysteel,2010-08-27 02:08:00,12,"Lol that was just something unique that occured, not really the base behind the statement. Again, I do see your point."
498937,buckysteel,2010-08-27 02:17:00,12,More about this type of watershed and the rarity of it in our area.
498950,buckysteel,2010-08-27 03:16:00,12,Appreciate all the support! Thanks!!
498953,steelie hunter,2010-08-27 03:31:00,55,"I do see your point. I dont know much about this, but I'd be all for helping the steelhead/salmon population on the lynn river system. As far as I knew, it wasnt a very good steelhead fishery, but maybe the removal of this dam could change that?"
498956,buckysteel,2010-08-27 03:36:00,12,Spawning success is minimal with the dam in place. Removing it would allow for them to reach areas if the river that would increase this 10 fold! There is huge potential here!
498986,buckysteel,2010-08-27 10:20:00,12,Thx
