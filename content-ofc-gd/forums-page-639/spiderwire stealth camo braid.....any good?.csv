497748,GBW,2010-08-24 12:45:00,8460,"It's not bad but the braid is loose, IE at times you can flex it and see through it.  I like the regular moss green stealth better."
497749,NAW,2010-08-24 12:52:00,4022,"I'm not fan of spiderwire.  Powerpro or fireline would be a better option.  Spiderwire looses it's colour really fast, and as mentioned before, is ""loose"" braid.  I find it frays really easily.."
497753,Roy,2010-08-24 13:10:00,13728,Camo fishing line eh? Is it water coloured?  The Stealth isn't bad line at all in the higher pound tests.
497761,bow slayer,2010-08-24 13:45:00,1074,I just bought a spool of the 50lb and spooled it up for the little guy. It seems like a descent braid and for 12 bucks about 8 bucks cheaper than power pro or fireline.

498701,fishindevil,2010-08-26 18:04:00,6254,I like it for trolling for walleyes and of course using a 10lb floro leader its fine for trolling and stands up to regular abuse well good line for the money. Cheers
