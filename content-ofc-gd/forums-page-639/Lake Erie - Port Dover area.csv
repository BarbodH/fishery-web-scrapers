I'm familiar with the SMB fishing in the Port Colborne area, and I was wondering if I can expect the same type of action or structure in the Port Dover/Turkey Point/Long Point area. I'm not looking for GPS coordinates, just some general tips or areas to start. I'm thinking of dropshotting for SMB's, but I'm open to suggestions.  Cheers!"

498355,smally21,2010-08-25 19:20:00,993,"your not far from nanticoke if you want to try the outflow. pottohawk is within reach on a good day.  fish the main channel with leeches or minnows, find some shoals or rockpiles and hit them with spinnerbiats and such.  i guess the same thing as port colborne, you just have to find the structure on a chart or fishfinder. good luck"
