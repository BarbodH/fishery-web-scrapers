498360,kickingfrog,2010-08-25 19:29:00,8333,I don't tell my wife... I'm sure as heck not going to tell you.  I did do a rough estimate for insurance... I don't bring up the cost per wear for her shoes like I used to.
498369,bbog,2010-08-25 19:37:00,665,What Lew said.
498378,OhioFisherman,2010-08-25 20:08:00,6623,"Not much, my kids call my barn the tackle store. I have tackle to catch any thing from minnows to muskie. I use to collect Abu reels, and have around 40 rods and reels I used. LOL I didn`t spend money on bassboats, booze, or harley`s so I had more for tackle, and to actually go fish."
498386,Duckie,2010-08-25 20:26:00,305,"  G. Loomis SJR 782 GL3.  amazing combo. perfectly balanced.  and no, its not for sale  I had the rod already though. I upgraded an older stradic with the sustain. I almost bought a new stradic, but am glad I spend the extra cash and got the Sustain. its a bit smoother, has an even smoother drag (thanks to a ball bearing on the spool shaft) and has two titanium lipped spools which is nice. it was expensive, but at the same time, thanks to the identical spare spool included and reel cover, in addition to the reel itself, I think you are getting a lot of bang for your buck with this reel.  its just a lot of bucks that all  but then like most of us, I don't buy a reel like this every day. if i did I would be in the poor house."
498419,Gregoire,2010-08-25 22:04:00,1397,"I'm getting married soon and just got into musky fishing and baitcasters. The reason why I mentioned getting married. Is because I've been told to buy now cause once kids cone the disposable income dries up. I've spent    at least 600 on baitcasters. I don't even want to guess how much I've spent on musky lures, I've probably got 50 lures now."
498445,Beans,2010-08-25 23:06:00,3339,I've spent less than $100 per year the past 2 years and that was for carp equipment and bait...  A couple of bank stix...an alarm...a telecopic carp rod to have as a second rod in case my son or bro-in-law cares to give carp a try...  
498450,ehg,2010-08-25 23:12:00,2666,I bought three new lures this year and 1 rod/reel combo. Bought enough last 20 yrs. or so. Didn't really need the lures.

I do buy quality gear rather than cheap crap though, some of my Shimano reels are 8-10 years old and still going strong."
498184,smally21,2010-08-25 13:20:00,993,"i went thru the tackle hoarding phase that i think everyone goes thru. the nafter a couple of season fishing nothing but the same jighead, rapala and spiinerbait i cut it down to about three little trays. filling up the boat and hauling around all that gear i never used....."

498206,MJL,2010-08-25 14:15:00,2427,"Growing up, there was (in no particular order):  - The float rod phase: When I learned how to build rods in high school and could easily obtain components from G. Loomis Canada for relatively cheap.  I think at one point I owned 8 different float rods (11’6 – 14’) mostly from Loomis, Lamiglas and Hardy.  But I made money on almost all the rods when I sold them which was good  - The centrepin collecting phase.  Some of which only saw the water once and others I regret selling/trading now for what I sold/traded them for.  - The entering into the wonderful world of fly fishing phase (I was quite partial to Sage fly rods)  - The entering into the wonderful world of ice fishing phase...It wasn’t too bad but I’m still down a portable hut, survival suit and a really good set of boots  Ironically I never really did spend that much in a year on carp…Except in 2008 when I blew a wad of $ on a new custom carp rod and a new baitrunner  I think I’m on the road to recovery and salvation.  So long as I don’t pick up any other types of fishing (Like for muskies and saltwater toothy critters), I should be fine  This year: $11 on corn for carp… $70 on NY licenses $100 on terminal tackle and lures for trout and walleye $18 on worms $18 on minnows $9 on leeches  I’m doing well comparatively"
498212,fishnsled,2010-08-25 14:32:00,3520,"Depends on the year.  About 30K one year with the purchase of the boat.  This year, not so much. With gas and a few tackle replacements, fly in fishing trip, about $2500- $3000 this year so far.  Tackle alone this year maybe $2-300 in baits, plastics, line.  Need to replace a broke rod still......and there is still 4 months left in the boating season!!  lol!  "
498220,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-25 15:08:00,932,"I love rods & tackle & other fishing related items, so I'll always spend a lot and be a mini-tackle-hoarder.  As I mostly fish soft-plastics for bass, I spend A LOT of money on tackle. Soft plastics don't always last that long and are more prone to being destroyed in storage.  I'd say I spend $30/week on tackle on average, with a few BIG sprees here and there.  This year I've bought 2 rods & 2 reels (including my first fly rod), so it has been a pricey year indeed.  I always try to broaden my horizons a little, so I use a new bait or two every time I go out.  That's one of my rules!  This way you can find some more staple baits and find confidence using new stuff.  It's a great practice that others should consider.  Actually, within the next few weeks I'm going to do something I call ""Junk Fishing.""  I'm going to load my vest with all kinds of underused lures and lures I've never used.  (I'm talking things like old wood plugs, kwikfish, tadpoles, spinner-minnows, weird soft plastics.)  Then I'm going to head out to the rivers and see if I can pick up some SMB or Pike on these outdated/weird lures.  I suspect I will.  Ryan"
498242,Guest natron,2010-08-25 15:57:00,0,"Next year wont be nearly as expensive for me. I have 3 rods/reels I love, so no more of those. I also experimented alot this year with my plastics as well as some DT Rapalas, flat raps and x raps, so next year I already know what I like and will just have to occasionally replace a bait here and there or a bag of plastics once in awhile.  I have alot of jigs as well, and wont need to replace them anytime soon (I bought about 100 black jigs, had awesome luck walleye fishing this year with them!)"
498304,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-25 17:18:00,947,Sorry i'll have to call you and let you know how much i spent.  Cause if i posted it my gf will spend the same amount on her purses and shoes
