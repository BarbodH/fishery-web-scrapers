498455,Pepe,2010-08-25 23:23:00,21,"Hey guys , I am looking to go fishing and camping around Lake O and I'd like to know if the salmon have started to get close to the creeks. Thanks for your help,   Pepe"
498457,danbouck,2010-08-25 23:27:00,4380,I take it you haven't been around for a couple days
498458,timmeh,2010-08-25 23:31:00,609,"The salmon arrived last Friday, Aug 20 @ 5:23 in the AM. They will run until exactly Tuesday, Oct 5 @ 10:33.  Just couldn't resist. If you've been on the board in the last week you'll know why.  But to answer your question, yes, if you look around a little you may get into a few."
498608,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-26 13:26:00,932,I was down by the river and the salmon were all replaced by 400 scraggly looking creatures carrying swimming pool nets and treble hooks the size of a rake blade.  Why they needed both was beyond me.
498616,capt bruce,2010-08-26 13:50:00,820,"Due to the lack of rain this year , the salmon run has been cancelled. Refunds can be picked up at your nearest mnr office."
498620,John,2010-08-26 14:12:00,2956," Stop in and see Roy, he will give you all the advice you need..."
498648,danbouck,2010-08-26 15:20:00,4380,"Roy is gonna hate me for this but I found a lot here, and barely any fisherman. 43.352241,-80.329469"
498666,Roy,2010-08-26 16:21:00,13728," There are a few fish there and not too many fishermen at all. You'll need a good sized spool though cause there's about 7,000 FOW at that spot in the North Atlantic."
498668,danbouck,2010-08-26 16:30:00,4380, You should check again
