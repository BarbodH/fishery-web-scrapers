These fish will soon be headed back to the OH and PA waters where they were raised. The season has been a good one with stable weather and lots of chrome to be caught and some big ones too. I have a great time with these fish as I think they are the best fighting with high flying, line stripping action. The action for me will change to more musky fishing, casting and jigging on the Detroit River and walleye fishing on Lake Erie. I will also be fishing the Bay of Quinte for about 10 days this fall for a fall trophy hunt. I hope everyone has had a safe and enjoyable summer, but the fishing season is not over yet!    "
