I am very lucky to to know of a small lake that is less than 1/2 hr from home & has never let me down yet.I keep enuf(walleye) to cook up that day,I like them fresh.I never put any in the freezer.I prefer the smaller ones(under 18 in).We eat walleye about once a week.I see no point in taking home a limit everytime if it is more than needed."
498670,Governator,2010-08-26 16:38:00,879,"I'll have walleye if I'm on a camping/fishing trip (kinda standard - shorelunch mmm), otherwise I might have a small fish fry once a month with perch or a small pike."
498678,JoshS,2010-08-26 16:58:00,729,"I only keep one or two here and there for dinner, and its always a small one whether it be pike, bass or walleye.  Occasionally will take a limit of walleye and bring one home for my dad but on average rarely keep anything.

Most of my more local spots are in southern Ontario so I figure they already receive enough harvest pressure.  On the occasional trips to more northern, or remote areas, where the populations are stronger I will take the odd fish here and there."

498412,scugpg,2010-08-25 21:32:00,1373,I love walleye and crappie. Perch and Northern are good as well. I eat quite a bit during the year but only eater size. Unfortunately in SW Ontario she's slim picking for clean water.  I never freeze fish though just keep enough for the day's meal...usually its barely enough for a meal anyhow
498426,fish-miester,2010-08-25 22:28:00,864,a guess in a year I keep  30  crappie 80  Perch 4  walleye 2  specks .5  pike

498453,Old Man,2010-08-25 23:16:00,822,"The wife and I only keep what we want to eat. In a typical year we probably consume about 24 Walleye, 12 Perch, 12 Smallmouth, 6 Lake Trout. Any large examples get released. We only keep Walleye between 15-18"", Smallmouth between 12-16"", Perch 11-12"", Lake Trout between 16-18"". All Northern, Muskie, Crappie and Rock Bass go back.  We fish about 130 days out of every year."

498482,Leecher,2010-08-26 00:53:00,7832,I never keep fish in the freezer and when I come home with some I usually clean them and in the pan they go.  My favorite species has to be speckles... especially the ones I use to catch during hard water season (pretty rare now a days since trout is closed during winter and no license outfitter to go to   ).  Nothing better then a freshly caught speck on ice    Walleye is my second choice followed by catfish (babotte in French) but I mostly practice catch & release most times Leechman

As far as preference, walleye (small guys, 14-15inchers), crappie are the best eaters. Actually, crappie I think is the best tasting fish on earth IMO"
498295,ckrb2007,2010-08-25 17:05:00,449,"I love the winter whitey feasts we have. I usually bring a few home and have a nice feed with the neighbours....although, I usually get the shaft. The fish is usually gone by the time I finish fryin' them up! LOL Oh yeah....nothing beats a meal of early ice perch."
498299,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-25 17:10:00,932,I keep nothing on local rivers.  When I'm lake fishing we'll keep the odd walleye or laker.

Pretty much always have some in my freezer...but I'm keeping less these days cause the kids are moved out.  I also have a few feeds of other species like walleye,crappie, bluegills, whitefish and smelt throughout the year.  I have been missing out on a feed of creek specs for years now. Love those tasty little buggers...just don't have any close by spots to hit anymore."
498318,Homer Is King,2010-08-25 17:48:00,305,"I try to follow the ""limit your catch, not catch your limit"" rule. I usually release most of what I catch. I may keep the odd walleye and I'll usually keep any crappie bigger than my hand (great eating!!!). Ice fishing I'll keep a pike or two for a lunch in the hut. Ice perch are awesome too!  I'm usually fishing panfish with the kids. We release most of them. We'll keep any that are gut hooked and won't make it.  crappieperchhunter, creek specs are great!

Ice fishing I will keep 1 or 2 whitefish or trout the entire season.  I think walleye, pike, perch and/or crappie make decent table fare.  I only keep bass if there isn't enough of the others.   Ling, catfish, splake, other trout are also fair game, but I don't often fish for these."
498328,Terry,2010-08-25 18:32:00,14456,I take home a meal of perch every year  one meal of crappie every year a pike or 2 a year for my wife..I don't like them a few whitefish every year a couple of meals of walleye each year.....  and anything that dies while I try to release it  and I never keep some for the freezer..eat it fresh or let it swim away
498331,uglyfish,2010-08-25 18:37:00,981,"usually keep some perch and other pannies for some snacks. try to get a few walleye to keep in the freezer, a pike or 2 if i manage to get some, silver bass in the spring, a couple rainbows or salmon, and a few bass. usually just keep the bass that die in the live well during a bass tourney."

I also keep the odd Pike, trout, and Salmon, but not often (Pain cleaning Pike, don't get many Trout or Salmon) I let all my Bass and Musky go. Have eaten a couple gill hooked bass ... not my fav.  In order of preference to me  Walleye Perch Pike (but like I said ... pain to clean) Crappie, but haven't fished for them for years."

498358,dave524,2010-08-25 19:26:00,4508,"It's like I have 2 very different fishing personalities. There is the C&R personality when fishing bass, carp, catfish, musky, pike, trout and salmon. Now whenever I target walleye, crappie and perch, I do so for a feed and freezer, if the fishing on Erie is hot, I'll let walleyes over about 5/6 pounds go amd keep the 3/4 pounders, better eating. That being said, when rigging on Lake Ontario, Cohoes under 10 go in the box, they are for me the best of the salmonoids/trout for the grill or smoker. The status of the freezer determines the walleye expiditions."
498364,bassjnkie,2010-08-25 19:32:00,1101,"Only Walleye for me, well..........when I actually have the time to target them. The funny part is I still buy the sportfihing license for a couple fish a year."
498366,bbog,2010-08-25 19:33:00,665,"Funny no one mentioned Carp!  If I won't eat it, I won't target it...  Favourites are Perch, Crappie, Pike, Salmon, Lake Trout, Rainbow and sometimes Whitefish. I will supplement a camping meal with a freshly caugh Largemouth bass - but wouldn't bring them home ordinarily."
498368,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-25 19:36:00,932,I know for certain that a lady in Fort Erie area will eat other people's catches or even fish she finds dead on the shore.  Bowfin is her favourite
498373,OhioFisherman,2010-08-25 19:45:00,6623,"I kept a 5 or 6 pound walleye or steel head some years for the wife and kids to eat. I got my fish sandwich at McDonald`s on the way home.  Just way to much fun catching them for me to kill them off. I stopped mounting fish in the very early 80`s, it just seemed pointless, the memories were enough."
