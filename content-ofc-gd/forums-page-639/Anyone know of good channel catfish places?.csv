We used 9 foot lighter salt water spinning rigs an 2-3 oz  pyramid sinkers to hold in the sand. Wade out, there is often a small shallow bar a few yards off shore, cast and then set your rod in a holder onshore. This was not an early spring fishery though, we always assumed thesse were fish that spawned in the Otter River. Could be worth a try, evening was best."

497766,rylan,2010-08-24 14:21:00,134,"if you can travel east to the trent river. the bottom of the locks are always good. Some are very deep and fast moving water-- but there is some cats there. I know.  good luck... here is a tip: on your way to the river- if you see road kill -- pick it up and place in a burlap bag, add some rocks and throw it in the water you want to fish-- if you can wait a day or two-- works best."
497798,dks,2010-08-24 15:24:00,36,"Adding a burlap bag to the river (which never decomposes) doesn't make sense to me. I know we want to catch fish, but, why trash the river just to improve a day's fishing?"
498708,fishindevil,2010-08-26 18:10:00,6254,The best place in Ontario for cats....is of course the mighty Ottawa river at arnprior Ontario they even have a catfish festival its awesome cats between 5-20lbs and tons of them all day long....cheers

498994,CLofchik,2010-08-27 11:20:00,854,"Heh I would've said Wasaga in June.  Not near as many as Dunnville but a ton of absolute 20lb+ slobs. During the summer the rivers out East, Trent, Ottawa, Pet, Mad et al.  Canoeing down the Petawawa & Madawaska you'll almost step on them in the shallows."
