498661,lew,2010-08-26 15:55:00,12766," That stach is purty near as old as me Marvin  Like I said above, I never, ever weigh fish and that hog may honestly be the only fish I've ever weighed in close to 60 years of fishing. I'm only going by the average of what 2 scales said, and who knows how accurate those things are anyhoo  Whatever the weight, it's certainly the largest bass I'll probably ever see again"
498671,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-26 16:42:00,0, That's a lunker for sure Lew and probably the biggest Canadian largemouth bass I have seen. But the rumours abound in 8 and a half pound largies. Yet not many pictures to back them up.
498674,bigfish1965,2010-08-26 16:47:00,3382,"I have seen a 9lb smallmouth. It is in a private large pond and is fed daily...therefore would not qualify as a record fish. It is weighed each year. It is more of a pet than anything else. Comes right up and takes frogs or chicken giblets out of your hand. Doesn't even struggle and swims right into the cradle for weighing. It is a monster...almost looks unreal. So yeah...a 9 pound fish is possible, just would take perfect conditions."
498675,JoshS,2010-08-26 16:51:00,729,  Haha.. Wonder what the stash record is? Thats a monster bass Lew!
498713,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-26 18:21:00,0," Actually I seen a record in the states and some of the locations were private ponds, farm ponds, ect...  http://www.landbigfish.com/staterecords/records.cfm?state=Ohio"
498733,Cudz,2010-08-26 19:10:00,2652,"Simcoe Smallies get fat and in that pic you can't see just how fat. According to my scale, the fish I am holding in this pic is bang on 7 pounds.  I wish I would have taken a pic of its belly from the underside to show the thickness. "
498736,Cudz,2010-08-26 19:16:00,2652,This too is a Simcoe bass.  I caught it and handed the rod to this kid I took out fishing. It was fat.  I think it was a hair under 6 pounds. Very fat.  
498737,daryl0815,2010-08-26 19:24:00,225,"Holy crap, that one had been eating pretty good! thats one of the fattest smallmouth I have ever seen"
498768,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-26 20:16:00,0,  Cudz? That fish your holding looks over 22 inches easy. The other one looks barely 20 inches. It must have been one fat fish. Even the fish the kid is holding is much much fatter than the supposed 7 lber. Who knows though. Pictures can be deceiving and I doubt the tournament scales lie.
498773,misfish,2010-08-26 20:25:00,29133,"  Johnny Look at the fish closer. Not a straight arm shot and it covers shoulder to hip on Mark.Also the head goes right into huge shoulders and continues right to the tail.Probly not the best pic of the fish,but seen it personally.Big fish.  Cudz,pigs bud."
498796,Michael_Brown,2010-08-26 21:15:00,411,"The big waters always have a shot at the record but even there, is still has to be the right conditions. I was told years ago that if you caught a fish that weighed half of the record it was considered huge. So anything over 5lbs is a trophy in anyones book. I have been lucky to see some true pigs over the years. The biggest was a largemouth caught in the Muskoka's during the spring while pike fishing. It may have been 9lbs definately well over eight but a buddy caught her and we released her quickly. The photos are not always the best way. I make fish look small but a few lighter friends that make them look big.  I have always liked the attached photo, 6lb smallmouth but Mr. Giles makes it look 10lbs. "
498799,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-26 21:21:00,0, Yup. Looks closer to 7. Look at the mouth on it!
498809,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-26 22:03:00,3761,"A lot of you guys saw this largemouth from last August. 6lbs 13oz, no fibs or lies just it's my record and I caught it on that dear Rapala Skitter Pop. My biggest and the only big fish I care about lol.  Lot's of great big smallies shown on this thread. Congrads guys, the records I try to beat are only my own."
498812,OhioFisherman,2010-08-26 22:07:00,6623,"Some states here allow record fish from private ponds, Ohio is one of them. Years ago my brother pulled one from a pond not far from where I live that was easily 7. As he held it up to show me it flipped right out of his hand down the bank back into the water, LOL a grown man cry? That particular pond had golden shiners in it up to 3/4 of a pound or so. I have only lost two L/M in 40-50 years of fishing that I was sure were over 7, one may have been way over, both from farm ponds.  Long ago the beer or liquor store in Pointe Au Baril had a pig on the wall caught at a near by lake, as I recall it was 8ish and huge. It doesn`t take a big lake to produce big fish, just the right mix. Look at the pigs they pull out of some small California lakes. Of course they have the advantage of a year round growing season."
498813,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-26 22:09:00,3761,"Also, there is a stuffed bass in the trailer park on Lake Seymour of a 8lb+ largemouth on the wall caught out of the lake or connecting system. The pulled a catfish out of it's mouth as the stories tells"

497891,JoshS,2010-08-24 18:18:00,729,This is easily the biggest bucket I have ever caught.  I didn't weight it and don't know if its seven but my educated guess would say its close.

It was so big I could fit my fist into his mouth. Looking back now it was easily over 7 compared to the fish I catch now and it could of been over 8. I wish I had a picture, but its something I'll never forget."
498189,lew,2010-08-25 13:29:00,12766,"I haven't fished for bass in years and NEVER weigh fish as the weight of a fish just doesn't seem important to me, but I do carry scales in the boat incase any of my guests want to weigh something.  When I saw this big girl though, I thought she was worthy of putting her on a scales.  I was casting shallow water for musky using a #5 Mepps.  A spring scale put her at 7.14 pounds and a digital showed her at 8.2 pounds. Don't know how accurate the scales were but they were both fairly close to each other.  Whatever it was, she was a definate trophy largemouth.  "

498197,charlesn,2010-08-25 13:52:00,551,Awesome largie Lew.  A serious trophy even though I know what you fish for woulda probably eaten it.  I've only seen a very few 6s never mind 7s.  Any 8+ bass up here is a true super giant and quite possibly the biggest bass in that body of water.  Charles
498199,Harrison,2010-08-25 13:56:00,2202,"Who are ya fool'n Lew, I've fished with you, that's the size of lures you use.  Thats a pretty cool realistic one though!"
498653,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-26 15:32:00,0," Crazy...That fish looks about 5lbs max......  I hear so many rumors of 8.5 lb largies, yet to see very many over 7. Makes those record fish suspicious. I wouldn't be surprised if they were exaggerated or caught in a pond/fish tank and fed shiners...."
497697,sauce,2010-08-24 05:35:00,219,"Can you imagine seeing a 9.8 pound smallmouth? That's a giant fish. I've caught walleye, trout, pike that size. But never a bass anywhere close. I've heard of and seen pics of smallies up to 7 pounds. SMB that size are rare fish. So, I'm thinkin if I want to catch a giant smallie, I need to fish a body of water that can create such a monster. Ya, Erie, simcoe, etc... what about the lake where the record was caught? Does anyone fish it? My research tells me its bark lake near kinmount. The record LMB comes from a lake close by. Something in the water? Just starting discussion. Don't need to know anyones secret spots. Just maybe hear about others experiences at this lake."
497703,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-24 08:54:00,0,"It's possible, just this early summer I lost the biggest bass of my life at the holland river on a gulp minnow 2 feet behind a topwater (rig I invented for tourny). The fish looked around 7 pounds, definably bigger than 5 pounds. I still can't get over that.   Alright time for me to get back to salmon....."
497709,singingdog,2010-08-24 10:04:00,1047,"7 lbs is a looooong way from 9lbs 8oz. Lots of 7s have been caught from Simcoe, but has anyone ever weighed a fish over 8.5 from there? Erie is producing amazing #s of 7s, but I have never heard of a 8.5 being caught from there either. It's like there's some kind of growth limiter on those waters.  Don't you remember that guy from Ottawa that broke the world record, but filleted it before it could be weighed? I always admired his cajones....if you're going to lie about a fish, you might as well double the weight instead of adding a measly pound or two.  I believe the Ontario record is from Birch Lake. There are some virtually unfished bass lakes in the area between the Kawarthas and the Highlands....nuff said."

497747,OhioFisherman,2010-08-24 12:43:00,6623,"""It's like there's some kind of growth limiter on those waters""  Probably the two biggest growth limiters are food supply and fishing pressure. Here in Ohio a new state record L/M only seems to be possible in private farm ponds. Just too much fishing pressure on public waters. The last state record L/M out of a public lake? 40-50 years ago.  The state record smallie? I believe Lake Erie? A tremendous food supply for them, miles of habitat, and millions of fishing hours involved. They are special because they are rare! Nature`s works of art!  As much as catch and release is practiced? some still keep big bass. Some lakes have the food supply and habitat to produce nice fish fairly often, but limited by fishing pressure.  You rarely catch the biggest fish in the lake, but you keep going back searching for it!"
497765,bassjnkie,2010-08-24 14:21:00,1101," Been fishing the Holland River for 15+ years and never caught/seen a bass that big come out of there. Too bad you lost it, it would definitely be cool to see a 7lb bass out of there. Shore or boat fishing?"

I would think that this lake could hold a 9 lb bass. The lake is one of the deepest in Ontario. I remember a few years ago using frogs, and fishing in 25-30fow around some of the islands near Campbells Bay, and catching some monsters out of there. Never really took pictures nor did I have a scale- but I did catch one that was over 7 lbs easily --"
497780,Guest natron,2010-08-24 14:51:00,0,"Rainy lake, Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul in Northwest Ontario produce alot of big smallies. Biggest I've ever caught though was a tad over 8lbs, but I've rarely fished those lakes for smallies, usually it's for large walleye.  I've caught alot of 7lbers the past two years on Rainy River as well.  I can't imagine hauling in one close to 10lbs, that would be sensory overload, lol"
497785,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-24 14:56:00,932,I'd imagine record-chasing would be pretty fun.  Any kind of fishing where you're mildly disappointed when you catch a 4lb SMB is a good kind of fishing in my books.
497788,Guest natron,2010-08-24 14:59:00,0," I agree.  Have you seen the youtube video of that 25lb LM that was dummy hooked? Wow, that guy fished the same lake everday for like 4 years chasing on fish he called ""dotty"". Unbelievable determination, lol"
