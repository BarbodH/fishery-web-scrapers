499142,Guest nuker,2010-08-27 19:47:00,0,"heading south to get my  new-to-me boat tomorrow morning  i was thinking of stopping at nepewassi lake on the way back to sudbury.  do i need to worry about major hazzards on the lake, like sub-surface boat killers?  hoping to hook into some nice walleyes!"
499184,Muskieman,2010-08-27 23:36:00,2472,  No major Hazzards on Nepewassi.... Are you Gonna launch @ Vacationland in Estaire? Try Barlow Bay  south east of Vacationland ....  Walleye are 'kinda hard to catch there with the TONS of boat traffic.the evenin' bite is not bad just look for anchored boats..'been fishin Nep for about 30 years now and have had hit and miss success everywhere for the Eyes.... Musky and Pike are easier to catch in Nepewassi than the Eyes.  Good Luck  RFS
