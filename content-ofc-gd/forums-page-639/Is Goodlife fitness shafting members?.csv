Not to mention the banks caused the housing bubble. But I guess if the jobs weren't being outsourced, people wouldn't have lost their jobs and their homes.  And I think the issue here is that charging $60 for NSF(not once but 4 times) is robbery. I can understand if we are talking thousands of dollars but we are not."
499131,Billy Bob,2010-08-27 19:19:00,5865,A couple of lessons should of been learned here.  1. NEVER use a debit card for auto deduction. USE A CREDIT CARD  2. READ all the FINE print in these contracts and ask questions  BTW we get FREE Health Club Memberships here with our health insurance. Is that available in any of the communist countries like Cuba or China ?  LOL

There is so much wrong with society today, a few of you briefly touched on some of the topics. Johnny is one of those guys who everyone thought was a crazy 10 years ago.... and the truth is just now starting to come to the surface! What am I talking about? I sound crazy too! Monetary system..what does that really mean?  What ever happened to making sure your tribe had a full belly and a shelter to protect you from the elements? I guess we all forget we are the same species... human.  And technology? Isn't the definition to make life easier? But I guess that only works if you can afford it... is that right?

498175,scuro2,2010-08-25 12:50:00,904,"Ironically she works at a grocery store and she will pay it off. The super irony here is that all of this happened because she wanted two bank accounts and she mistakenly transferred money out of the one account to make sure she wouldn't go NSF for Good Life.  If nothing else this is a valuable life lesson about money, banks, and how companies don't always have your best interests in mind."
498187,bigreddog,2010-08-25 13:25:00,84,"Another lesson is never to allow companies to automatically deduct payments directly from your account.  This is a dangerous practice, but companies offer this as a ""convenience"" so you won't have a good sense of just how much money they're taking from you.  Out of sight, out of mind, and out of money.  The other issue is in situations where you're canceling service or membership.  In the past, (albeit with a different fitness club), they ""conveniently"" forgot to discontinue withdrawing funds from my wife's account, even after she canceled membership in person.  It took months to get the money back -- and you can bet that they didn't offer to pay compensation for their indiscretion / stealing."

For years she has been witness to customers getting screwed in many ways by ""FitnessClubs"". And it seems one is no better then the other...all the major clubs seem to play games when it comes to the money end of things."
498367,scuro2,2010-08-25 19:34:00,904,"An update  I went to the bank and they confirmed that the four NSF charges of $40 each were the result of four separate attempts by GLF to withdraw funds over a 4 week period. The local manager said she could do nothing and referred me back to their 1-800 #. The 1-800 lady confirmed that it was GLF who made the four separate attempts costing my daughter $160 dollars in bank charges. I asked if it was the right thing for GLF to do this and I got the contract and business spiel and it was within their right to make the 4 attempts. I asked if they could reduce the bill in any way and she said no. I asked if she could mail me the original contract and she said no I would have to go to a website to make a request.  I asked if it was GLF that added the two additional $25 dollar collection fees. As I understand what was said to me, neither the CPA nor any private collection agency is yet involved.  Total additional costs beyond missed payments, that can be attributed GLF or their actions = $210.00  My wife did sign the contract along with my daughter."
498395,BillM,2010-08-25 20:40:00,17367,"Your bank can get rid of those NSF charges easily..  But it doesn't look like they want to help you.  How long have you and the wife had accounts there?

The same thing happened to me when paypal attempted a direct withdrawl instead of processing my visa # (which was my selected option).  3 NSF charges were dropped immediately by my bank when I inquired about it.  Could it be you're too confrontational in your approach?  You get more flies with honey.
498410,jediangler,2010-08-25 21:24:00,1923,"Your daughter and wife would have got a ""PINK"" copy of the contract when they signed it. Goodlife charges only one $25 according to my wife but even if they did charge twice it's still your bank that is charging you $160.00. Your issue is really with the bank. Next time you go in to the gym ask to talk to the club admin, seriously, the managers don't really know what's going on in that regard."
498420,scuro2,2010-08-25 22:08:00,904,"I'm not lying. Goodlife wants 2 x $25 dollars for it's ""collection services"". They made 4 attempts to withdraw money over a month. Since several GLF personal at the gym denied that a third and fourth attempts were done by GLF, and our first contact at the 1-800 also denied that they would make more than two attempts. A lot of time at the bank was spent to sort this out. It took two meetings but the bank did put a real person in front of us who listened and eventually agreed that the bank shouldered a little bit of responsibility here. She communicated with a manager who offered to knock off 3 of the charges and my daughter was very pleased that they did this. Had GLF only attempted to withdraw funds once or twice I may have pressed the point that she was a minor and probably got all of the charges removed.  I'm sure my daughter and wife did get a ""pink copy"" but you are talking about 17 year old. I'm sure I heard GLF personal state that they only ever attempt withdraw funds twice. We wanted to see the exact wording of the contract and asked the 1-800 lady but she said she couldn't mail me a copy...not even a blank form. She said we would have to go to a website and fill out an application to get this form. No real person from GLF with any authority will see us. I've made this request many times and they say the only way to deal with this is phone the 1-800 #. The difference between how the bank and GLF have handled this is stark. From my vantage point GLF is not concerned personally about it's customers and is being unreasonable."

In the late 1800's and early 1900 people would rob banks with a gun, now the Banks rob the people and they do not have to use a gun. When I started banking the banks cared about the community and the people.  The managers would work with the customers but now all the Banks want is fees.  All the Banks care about is the profit and the all the managers care about is their bonus.  When I was a Loan Officer for a local Bank we would make loans with the customers deposits and make a good income for the banks and pay good intrest to the depositor and not charge all kinds of fees for the deposit.  Now the Big BANKS have taken over the small local Banks and as I said they do not care about the community or the customers unless it will increase there profit. Before the Big Banks taken over the local Banks wanted the employees to belong to civic clubs and work to help the community, now they want the employees to do is calling customer and getting more money for the bank and find more fees to charge the customer.  Just like your daughter's O D Fees."

Dear Sir and Ms XXXXXXX,  My teenage daughter's account went NSF. I did speak to Ms. XXXXXXX about this and she said she had no power to do anything and that I had to call the 1-800#. XXXXXXX at your 1-800# confirmed that GLF made 4 separate attempts to pull funds out of her account over a 4 week period. These attempts resulted in $160 dollars of bank charges. XXXXXXX thought this was a perfectly acceptable business practice, stated within her contract, even though my daughter was 17 at the time. XXXXXXX stated that in no way was it possible to reduce what GLF wishes to collect. Ultimately it will be I who will be responsible for these charges. I ask you kindly to do the right thing and set up an appointment for myself and my daughter so that we can talk face to face with someone who has the authority to resolve this.  Thank you,  XXXXXXX  Here is the response.   Thank you for your email. I am on holidays until August 30th. I will be working through many emails and will be back to you as soon as possible.  I appreciate your patience in my reply.  Patch   I'll update you all in September and let you know if the president responds and sets up a personal meeting. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

498546,solopaddler,2010-08-26 02:52:00,8605,  Why in the world would it possibly be locked down?  I've been a member of GLF myself for years with no problems. So what? What does that have to do with scuro's situation? Nothing.  As far as this being stricly a fishing forum you've been around long enough to know that's not the case.  As an aside talk to anybody who works in a bank and they'll tell that dealing with fitness clubs in general is a nightmare. They're known for this type of thing.

I'd like to point out that this thread would have never started if any of the five GLF personal I had talked to, to date, would have given me a name of a person who had the authority to settle this.

You signed a contract.... defaulted on this contract.... they have a right to compensation, whatever it says in this contract.... thats the way it is.  It is not their problem why the account was NSF, they shouldn't have to care (but they could to be nice)...

Yes, the NSF charges are high...and personally I think they should have phoned us after the second NSF but in the end they reduced the 4 NSF charges to 1. They didn't have to do that either, I am sure they have a contract too. They allowed my daughter to see a real person and she listened, and when we saw that to a small degree we had a valid point, she acted."

Then I have Rogers telling me that my incoming text messages are no longer free. Now there text messages are really cheap but still...They robbed me a few hundred in the process that they said I would be reimbursed and never was.Its ok when big businesses want to make changes to a contract, its not ok for the little people.  A contract is a contract but common sense tells me that sometimes there should be exceptions.  I remember watching bugs bunny and how you needed a magnifying glass to see the small print, and in the old days people would be scammed FOR REAL alot of money by those small prints that were impossible to read.  Make sure you people read and understand perfectly anything you sign.  Anyways good for goodlife in resolving this issue in a decent manner."

498627,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-26 14:32:00,0," You have no idea. What you speak of is small potatoes to what they are really doing. The banks are one of the major reason we are in this economic dilemma. People making bad loans to receive bonuses. They make it seem like the banks are loosing out and that they need money to be bailed out, but that is not the case. Not only do they have most of the downpayments and payments, they have the collateral(homes, land, businesses) also."
497949,scuro2,2010-08-24 20:05:00,904,"My 17 year old daughter joined GF for a year and set up automatic bi-weekly withdrawals. She had insufficient funds and as a teenager she did what teenagers do best and that is to ignore the problem. GF attempted to withdraw the funds 2 twice and than canceled her account.  So much is acceptable.  The part that galls is that Goodlife, if I understand this correctly, have outsourced this operation to the Canadian Payment Association who made two separate attempts to withdraw $25 dollars for their services...and with both attempts further NSF charges came from her bank.  So for the two missed payments $80 dollars in NFS charges from her bank (2 x 40) $80 dollars in NFS charges for the two attempts by the agency to collect their fee for being involved (2 x 40) plus $50 dollars in charges from CPA  As the GL phone representative explained it to me ( you can't meet anyone in person about accounts) the bank charges are appalling. When I questioned her about the CPA...she said well that is totally out of GF's hands. She explained that they instituted this system because customers complained that previously they didn't understand where the extra charges where coming from.  As I research further the CPA is a nonprofit government agency to help settle collections. From my vantage point they are compounding a problem. Shouldn't collection fees come at the end of process and shouldn't one have the right to pay it instead of having them automatically attempt to pull it from your account? Also, if the original sum was NSF a simpleton could assume that the attempt to collect fees will also be NSF. Our bank is good to us so we can probably get some of the NSF fees back...but this seems grossly unfair and a scam. Perhaps I have misunderstood all this and someone has an answer?"
497959,Harrison,2010-08-24 20:33:00,2202,Go talk to the Manager at the location. They fixed my wife and I up when we changed bank accts and forgot to switch the kids GF daycare fee to the new acct.  They can address this in person. .
497965,bigfish1965,2010-08-24 20:45:00,3382,I do not see how a collection agency has any right to access the account. I would be screaming at my bank asking them why they allowed a third party access without any agreement.

497969,lookinforwalleye,2010-08-24 20:51:00,4399,I have been through this more than once with my boys when they were younger and what I think is appalling is that these companies are allowed to sign up kids to contracts and sell services that they do not have the means to pay for. And in the end it is usually the parents that end up getting the leters and the phone calls and paying money while the dumb kids are out sign another stupid contract they can`t afford!!!
497972,bare foot wader,2010-08-24 20:58:00,1354,"this is where the fine print of your contract comes into play...once your account becomes delinquent and they sell your outstanding balance to a third party they are in fact authorized to collect payment from you...perhaps not in so many, clear cut words but it's in the fine print....say you owe GLFC $100, they sell it to a collection agency for say 10-15%....said collection agency will then try to maximize recovery of the debt, usually you can settle for much lower than your original balance but still adversely affects your rating   check your pm's...."
497986,bigfish1965,2010-08-24 21:39:00,3382,No contract signed by anyone under the age of 18 is valid unless it is for things like rent or food. Otherwise a parents signature is required.
498002,scuro2,2010-08-24 22:12:00,904,"All I would hope to expect from GLF is for them to do the right thing. I have no problem paying the missed payments and the entire year membership. Just give us a call when the payment problem arises. If a client takes the time to come to your office and settle things then at least give them the opportunity to talk face to face with someone who can actually do something. Don't hide behind telephone ping-pong and don't play the pass the buck game.  Finally, if your collection agency is creating further NFS charges for your clients, then rethink your business with this agency...after all this is a people business."

498011,Roy,2010-08-24 22:41:00,13728,"This probably changes a few things:  The Canadian Payments Association (CPA) is a not-for profit association created in 1980 by an act of parliament, the Canadian Payments Act, to ""establish and operate national systems for the clearing and settlement of payments and other arrangements for the making or exchange of payments"" within Canada. The CPA is the regulatory body for the settlement and clearing of payments in Canada. The Minister of Finance is responsible for overseeing the operations of the CPA.  The Association facilitates the flow of funds between institutions and mitigates risk to participants in the payment system. They handle several transaction types including cheques, bills payments, and point-of-sale debits.  All banks operating in Canada as well as the Bank of Canada are required under the Act to be members of the payment system. Other financial institutions such as credit unions, trust companies, life insurance companies, and securities dealers are eligible for membership.  The CPA is very active: on average, some 20.6 million payment items, representing $164 billion in transactions, were cleared and settled through the CPA’s systems each business day during 2005."

498044,scuro2,2010-08-25 00:17:00,904,"Yup, don't know much about the CPA and what role they are playing in this. When we met the local manager he gave us a statement which states,""that Head Office Collections is currently handling this account"". This would make it sound like GLF is handling it. The manager then told us we must phone 1-800-387-2524 if we had an issue with the bill. Is this a GLF 1-800 #? When we phoned the lady stated that is GLF's policy to only make two attempts at withdrawal so as not to swamp their clients with NSF charges. If so where did the extra two NSF charges come from? The lady at the 1-800# said that these charges were independent of the company and on the bill after each NSF, there is a charge for, ""external collection"". Are the 3rd and 4th attempts at collecting money from my daughter's negative balanced account the actions of a private collection agency, GLF, or the CPA? All very confusing...and any way you slice it...it stinks!"
498048,jediangler,2010-08-25 00:25:00,1923,"Wifey says that, as a 17yr old, she couldn't have joined without a parent/guardian co-signing. After attempting to withdraw and getting NSF she would have incured a $25 charge from Goodlife as well as whatever charge your banking institution charges for the NSF. After a second attempt that results in another NSF, Goodlife will not charge again and will not send the account to CPA until 75 days after the first NSF. This gives time for the member to catch up on payments directly at the Gym. After the CPA takes over, only the manager can reverse this process and that is unlikely unless she shows up at the Gym with enough cash to cover her debt. This will not, however, have any affect on what she now owes to CPA or your bank. Sounds to me like you're between a rock and a hard place."

498100,scuro2,2010-08-25 03:07:00,904,"What you say makes sense but you haven't explained where the #3 and #4 NSF charges came from. My daughter doesn't write checks and the only other purpose of her account was for caf food and other small items...so those charges are related to GLF. On her bank statement they are about 4 weeks from the first NSF, on the GLF statement and they both are charged on the same date. Why couldn't they have combined the fees and saved her one NSF? Better yet how about a mailed bill from this outside agency for their services? The lady from the 1-800 # said those attempts were not from GLF and I should go the CPA website to learn more?!?? Did that.  Did CPA charge her account directly for their involvement, did this come from head office ( their statement from today states, ""head office collection is currently handling this member"")... or was a private collection agency responsible for the 3rd and 4th attempt at withdrawing her funds from her account? GLF policy states they will only attempt to withdraw funds twice. Can your wife explain what happened? Regardless, why would GLF give their blessing to a system that shafts it's members with 4 NSF charges in less than a month? This is a teenager after all.  Finally, my wife said that she didn't sign any papers, I certainly didn't! She was the one who used to go with her. You are suggesting that my wife signed? The proof is in the pudding. Can I ask to see the contract at the gym?"

Those other charges are not from Goodlife. Probably from your bank or CPA. Did she book any time with a personal trainer or tanning time that could also have incured a NSF?"
498123,scuro2,2010-08-25 04:26:00,904,"There were 4 NSF charges. GLF tried to pull the money twice in the normal two week interval. Then whomever tried twice more. She has a ""teenager"" account at her bank so the extra NSF charges ain't from her bank. There is so little activity in there anyways. There is no tanning in this facility and she didn't use a personal trainer. She would go in with mom a few times a month.  Can your wife explain what the CPA actually does, if glf uses a private collection agencies, and if they do, how do they work the CPA? My assumption is that the CPA as a ""helper"" wouldn't be involved in the first stages of the game, nor would they be attempting to pull money directly out of my daughter's account. I am assuming that the CPA is more an arms length government body."
498124,jediangler,2010-08-25 04:47:00,1923,Goodlife tries twice but only charges NSF one time. It's not likely they would try again so 3 of those NSF charges were coming from somewhere other than Goodlife. Why would a teenager account give her freedom to issue NSF cheques? Won't the bank tell you the identity of the other attempted withdrawls?
498154,scuro2,2010-08-25 11:55:00,904,"Your wife has no info on the CPA or the possibility of an outside collection agency with regards to outstanding GLF accounts? I would like to understand what exactly happened.  In talking to the two manager and the 1-800 lady, and after viewing the GLF bill, the first two NSF charges came through GLF's attempt to withdraw funds. The dates match up perfectly. To me that is acceptable.  But also on the GLF statement there are two charges of $25 dollars for ""service charge external collection"". These charges are on the same date as the nsf notice. Since I don't understand who is seeking this money nor the necessity of these charges, I find them unacceptable as do I find the 3rd and 4th attempts to withdraw cash from her account. She has no checks so it really looks like the final nsf are related to her GLF account.  I will go back to GLF today to look at the contract and I will go to the bank to gather info and see what can be done."
