If you read the comments, 30% share is selling for 3.4 Billion and from what I understand, the entire 407 was sold for 1 billion???  Sounds like a solid investment for CPP, since traffic will continue to increase.(editted:But I think the figure is too much)  But can you imagine the revenue it would have been producing for the province if it was never sold? But I guess Harris felt the need to put some quick cash in his pocket!"
