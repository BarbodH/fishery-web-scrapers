I don't see these guys all year, and I really look forward to this weekend to catch-up, shoot the bull and fish a bunch. Unfortunately this year one of the buddies had to bail on our regularly scheduled weekend and the only available weekend all five of us could agree on is Labour day for only 2 nights! I'm pretty sure we are out of luck, but thought maybe someone on this board knows of a last minute cancellation that we could take advantage of. I'm going to call around tomorrow. We are looking for something one hour north of Peterborough. Even as I write this I realize we are probably screwed...  Any ideas?  Thanks!"
498099,GBW,2010-08-25 02:59:00,8460,"Look up Halimar in Haliburton.  Tell Jan (sound like Yawn) and Suzanne that Geoff and Trina (sounds like Tree-NA) told you to check with them.  I have been there maybe 5 years in a row now and I'm very happy with everything they offer/provide. http://www.halimar.com/ It's more a family place but when you look at what the lake has to offer then maybe it's a good fit for you, provided they have room... Good luck and I miss those trips with the boys when something causes a big mess... Geoff"

498379,jimmer,2010-08-25 20:10:00,2730,"Haven't been to this place in a long time, but Elephant Lake Lodge might be a possibility for you guys. Bass, Pike, Muskie, Walleye Sunnyhill Resort on Bark Lake, Bass, Pike, Walleye, Lake Trout, Whitefish. Any lakes in the Kawarthas will be a zoo!!!!!!!"
498391,smally21,2010-08-25 20:32:00,993,try tamarvacations.com may be a little far but i think they have vacancies on the weekend.

498571,adempsey,2010-08-26 05:53:00,1498,"I think you'll be totally fine.   I book last minute all the time and there is always somewhere to go.  Especially in your neighborhood.  Although, you might need to drive a bit further to get something for sure.  Any of the resorts on Pigeon/Chemong/Buckhorn lake should be similar and totally fine for a bunch of guys.   I thought Camp Fisherman and Pigeon Lake Resort were acceptable enough places.  There are numerous places to stay on Rice Lake as well.  I am going to Muskie Bay next week and I think they had some openings labor day weekend.  I also really like to fish Jack Lake (near Apsley).  I think there is only one resort on the lake - Jack's Lake Lodge  If it were me, I'd probably also consider some places on Chandos, Stoney and Kasshabog as well.
