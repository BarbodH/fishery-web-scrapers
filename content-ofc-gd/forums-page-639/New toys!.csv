498554,Fisherpete,2010-08-26 03:02:00,1814,"Well, after lots of research and humming and hawing about dropping $1000 on a trolling motor, I decided to take the not-get-killed-by-the-wifey (cheaper) route and bought a Motorguide 45lb 54"" shaft with wireless footpedal that I found on sale at LeBaron for $447. Last one they had... I would have loved to grab a Terrova 55, or even a Powerdrive V2 55 with iPilot, but I'm sure that Motorguide will do just fine on my boat. Has a 3 year warranty, and I am already familiar with it as it was the same model as on Al's old boat. Installed and ready to go!  Next mission... find a deep cycle battery! Suggestions anyone? I had a Motomaster Nautilus before, and it was pretty decent... any suggestions? Need to pick it up tomorrow...  OH - and while I was at LeBaron, what did I happen to see but a beautiful Tekota 500 trolling reel in the display... on 'super special' for $150! Yoink! I made a post a few weeks ago about finding an ideal trolling reel, and let me tell you, this puppy is sweet. Spooled her up tonight with 80lb PP... she's ready to rock some esox."
498558,Gregoire,2010-08-26 03:13:00,1397,Those are some awesome buys Pete. Were you at the Markham store?
498560,vinnimon,2010-08-26 03:21:00,2593," Go get that 50 inch ski Pete!With all the new equip. As for batteries, I didnt care for the nautilus,maybe a dud I purchased at the time at ctc. I run 2 real interstate marines in my boat.srm-24 550cca 690 cma. One has been discharged and recharged over 20 times recently.The other was still in the boat and never recharged. Load tested both after taking the surface charge off.2% difference(rough est) The nautilaus I had, had a higher cranking amp and a much higher price. Go interstate!"
498575,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-26 08:51:00,1107,The energizer DC from wally world are pretty good for the price prolly get 6-8 hours on a charge if the wind isn't howling lasts all day with my 45lb on a canoe there around $110 or so.
498576,lew,2010-08-26 08:54:00,12766," Good choice on the Tekota Pete, it's an excellent reel for trolling big baits."
498579,scugpg,2010-08-26 11:05:00,1373," My first choice would be Optimas, but price wise its hard to beat the Energizers or the ones at Costco."
498586,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-26 11:40:00,3761,"I bought a Motormaster DC Nautilus battery I have charged and re charged it most likely 40 times this summer when I was fishing every day for 2 months and it still is 100%.  Just grab another one of those. Congrads on the new motor, I think I'm going to give a Motorguide Varimax a try for next season."
498850,Pigeontroller,2010-08-26 23:57:00,2793,Thats a great price for a Tekota!
498977,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-27 08:45:00,1107,  Hey Mike I went through 3 in 3 seasons kept getting a bad cell in them until I got a onboard charger and stopped moving them in and out of the boat then I had no problems with them.
