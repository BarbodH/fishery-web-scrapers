498550,solopaddler,2010-08-26 02:56:00,8605, 2 second google search   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon#Life_cycle
498581,siwash,2010-08-26 11:12:00,683,  1 second.  Answer is yes. All PAcific Salmon do.
498612,Hairpy,2010-08-26 13:43:00,73,Most die but not all
498662,MJL,2010-08-26 15:55:00,2427, Some live forever and become immortal...   ...in the minds of those fortunate enough to hook into them
498757,kickingfrog,2010-08-26 20:00:00,8333,Rainbow trout/steelhead are a Pacific salmon that does not die after spawning.
498761,Spiel,2010-08-26 20:03:00,9065,"  I never bought into that theory, hell Pacific Salmon dying after the spawn is what separates a trout from a salmon...."
498776,kickingfrog,2010-08-26 20:33:00,8333,"It's not a  theory. It's science. We don't have to like it, or understand it, make it correct.  Should we talk brook trout or Atlantic salmon etc?  The name doesn't change how they fight or taste."
498778,Spiel,2010-08-26 20:38:00,9065,"Well Rainbows are trout to me, not salmon.  Brook trout are Char and Atlantics are something I've yet to experience."
498832,4thgen,2010-08-26 23:03:00,157, Oncorhynchus is a salmon genus. Same as the other Pacific salmon. They are different from the others by quite a bit though.
498849,Pigeontroller,2010-08-26 23:54:00,2793,Them is what they are...What they're called is what us apes named them!
498870,siwash,2010-08-27 00:41:00,683,"someone is getting ""techincl"" on us  .. .  yes they are al salmonids but everyone and their daughter, excpect whoever started this, recongnizes a distinction b/w the two!"
498879,jedimaster,2010-08-27 01:04:00,3472,If it smells like Trout... 
498891,kickingfrog,2010-08-27 01:29:00,8333,"Well if I was going to be technical. A question was asked. Answered correctly multiple times, but some surplus information was misleading.  BTW salmonids would include white fishes, graylings, chars and trouts."
498943,okumasheffield,2010-08-27 02:32:00,318,I didnt mean to troll in OFC ..  do you guys think that Coho doesnt smell as bad as Chinook?
