498165,The JAY,2010-08-25 12:31:00,239,"Vince, you're a brave man. I spent some time fishing with a 5 year old last week, which I haven't done in a decade when my daughter was that age... And that was just 1!  Can't wait to see the pics.  I love watching little kids fishing. Their excitement is just infectious, but they do take their toll.  Cheers!  "
