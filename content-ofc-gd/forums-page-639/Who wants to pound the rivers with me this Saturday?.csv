The Plan:  1)  To river fish for SMB from Saturday morning until late afternoon in the Kitchener-to-Brantford Area (not sure what spot yet).  2)  There will be walking as I'm not big on fishing bridges with 19 other people.  Our legs might get sore, but I almost guarantee that our arms will be sorer!  3)  We won't be keeping anything.  4)  Three is a crowd on the rivers . . . it just is.  5)  I'm not dishing out any honey-holes, I'm fishing relatively new (but productive) water.  I suspect we'll find a honey hole or two.  If anyone is interested post here or send me a PM.  Cheers, Ryan"

498781,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-26 20:43:00,932," I thought you had ball all day.  Regardless, I'm available from 6am to 4pm and later if the fishing is good.  I'll only do 6kms this Saturday if there is something fishable in between me and 6kms."
