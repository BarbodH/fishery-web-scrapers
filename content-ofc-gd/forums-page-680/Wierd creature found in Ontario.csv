468668,JohnF,2010-05-22 13:20:00,3494,"A genetic sport? Be interesting to be able to see the various bits and pieces like the foot and toe structure, teeth, tail etc to figure out what it most closely resembles. That would give a pretty good clue to it's origin and so on. It's not uncommon for physical aberrations to occur in animal species - like man - often from a diminished gene pool like an isolated colony of critters with no way of introducing new genetic material. I'm no scientist so I probably said it wrong so .......  JF"
468671,Joey,2010-05-22 13:42:00,9122,The newspaper today said it is most likely a baby bear that is waterlogged.  Said a dog pulled it from the river.  Who knows how long it was in the river.  It has since washed away and searchers are looking for it.  Joey
468681,wuchikubo,2010-05-22 14:15:00,1114,"My guess would be more closer to the otter. Possibly a slight mutation, the skeletal framework and musculature doesn't seem to match a bear or bear cub, I would more likely believe it was an otter that died and the fur washed off it's waterlogged head and front paw (looks possibly webbed), an otter's fur is sensitive to heat.  otter teeth pics:  Just my thoughts."

468744,Jewelbee,2010-05-22 22:06:00,422,"ok...Otter or something , but you can tell it's been dead a while...probably fur falling off from the water bloating it."
468759,NAW,2010-05-22 23:36:00,4022,Someone should call in the crew from Destination Truth..  Just kidding.  Those guys are brutal... They always leave after only spending one day on site.  What the hell can to figure out from spending one day on site.  really?
468763,fishing n autograph,2010-05-23 00:08:00,2540,Looks like something you'd find wander Lake Road in Keswick.....   Pigman perhaps? You know the Americans have a whole army of mutant pigmen....
468769,Daplumma,2010-05-23 00:36:00,1961,Man bear pig...ask Al
468823,Billy Bob,2010-05-23 11:47:00,5865, Actually it was predicted to end in 1984 but it didn't
468827,Roy,2010-05-23 11:54:00,13728,I'd be curious to know how many bald folks are looking for that dude's hair stylist.
468834,Whitespinnerbait,2010-05-23 12:25:00,2038,  I guess when your delusional...ya'll come up any kind of a bizzare name for a rotten otter
468847,keram,2010-05-23 13:20:00,585,I have no idea what it is. At a first glance I think that questioning of former M. Jackson's plastic surgeon is in order.
468850,jaydub,2010-05-23 13:36:00,145,I'm going with the water logged bear cub with the hair washed off it's face.  I had a muskrat living in my garage for a few days this winter and I can guarantee it's not that.
468862,Billy Bob,2010-05-23 14:45:00,5865,Never thought of it but it could be the pet gerbil that escaped from Dr. Anthony Galea on steroids..
468945,wallyboss,2010-05-24 00:09:00,1095,Can't be a muskrat or a beaver (look at the teeth)??? Marten or otter would be my guess.
468949,pike slayer,2010-05-24 00:35:00,1177,"yes yes i agree!! its man bear pig!! al gore is probably going nuts right now! im beening really serial guys, man bear pig is real!! same with global warming"

469033,ch312,2010-05-24 12:07:00,1590,definitely a weasel or otter type critter and not a muskrat or bear cub. chances are the people who found it know what it is but are using the hair loss as an excuse to create another internet monster.
469077,Whitespinnerbait,2010-05-24 16:36:00,2038,  BINGO !!!

468420,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-21 14:50:00,932,"Hmmm,  Looks a little suspect, but I guess it could be from cross breeding.  I'm not sure if an otter can breed with a possum, but I suspect that's what it'd look like."
468422,limeyangler,2010-05-21 14:54:00,5204,just looks like a muskrat or something and the hair from its face has worn away in the water...like what happens to any other creature thats been floating around the lake for a week or two.

468441,jimmer,2010-05-21 15:26:00,2730,"It's decomposition on the face, bacteria gets into the skin and the hair slips off.  The face is usually the first place this happens or around other body openings.  No whiskers! Probably a muskrat or baby otter."

468468,Dave Bailey,2010-05-21 16:34:00,1641," Not possible. Opossums are marsupials, otters are placentals, two entirely different classes. You would have a better chance of mating a deer with a dog, which is still impossible."
468469,bassman87,2010-05-21 16:39:00,586,It's an Atlantic.

468474,cram,2010-05-21 16:48:00,1733,To me it is OBVIOUSLY an otter.  Look at the face and the fur.

468560,Jewelbee,2010-05-21 23:15:00,422,OMG!!!....Much a due about nothing....It looks like a rotted muskrat....some one will be embarrassed when this all comes to light
468577,solopaddler,2010-05-22 00:02:00,8605,  Rotted or not this doesn't look like a muskrat to me LOL!

468581,tb4me,2010-05-22 00:14:00,3295,ya there is no way thats a muskrat..If it were rotted it would look rotted.Decomposition looks one hell of allot worse that that. The flesh wouldn't be left intact the way it is. I'm not sure what it is but I do know its not a muskrat.
468595,ohhenrygsr,2010-05-22 00:46:00,947,It's so Cute
