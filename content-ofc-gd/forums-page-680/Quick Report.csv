Both fish were caught on a spoon, the little guy chased in a spinnerbait then i threw the spoon out and he came out of nowhere and smashed it lol, it was exciting haha.  Here are the pictures Baby Pike!!   And the decent pike maybe 1 hour later. Saw some little 1 lb bass up really shallow in groups of 2 but no piggies on the beds yet from my location. Anyway got work tomorrow, have a god week everybody and until next time,   MTBF"

I've caught a few fish on spoons and seen alot of big fish caught on spoons, but just dont use them as much. But they are great for pike in shallow water."
