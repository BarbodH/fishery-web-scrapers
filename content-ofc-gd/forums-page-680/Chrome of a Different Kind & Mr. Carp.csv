469029,laszlo,2010-05-24 11:57:00,487,"With limited time this weekend (due to a ton of yard work needing to be done) I stayed local and hooked up with and old buddy from high school.  We had some factors working against us:  The sun was high and bright The water was low and clear  Getting into a few walleye was the plan which never came into fruition but some other species were ready to play!   Spunky Mooneye - Does this count as chrome??? Not really I guess but still fun.      A couple more Mooneye were caught on a wooly bugger fly using my pin and float set up. I tried dead drifting with no success so I switched up to casting into riffle and retreiving it back, combing the faster moving water.   I got into a couple channel cats and oos smallies as well. Things shut down for a bit and then Cam hooks into what feels like a decent sized fish that took a jig. At first we thought it was a big walleye but quickly realized that it was all weight. Had to be a carp...and it was.      Highdrifter - If your reading, this carps just for you! Wink Wink.  In the end no walleye to be found and the sun destroyed me. All worth it though!   Thanks for reading Till next time...  Laz"

469047,scuro2,2010-05-24 13:37:00,904,"Cam caught a carp on plastic and you didn't snag it? I've heard it said it can't be done! Beautiful and healthy carp, nice fish."
469053,Afraz,2010-05-24 13:54:00,250,"You caught channel cats and carp, dang i missed out. Great report thanks for sharing. Maybe let us in on your magical body of water too"
469092,laszlo,2010-05-24 18:16:00,487, I thought it was snagged for sure...I was wrong.
469338,MJL,2010-05-25 03:24:00,2427,Too bad no walleye were violated in the making of this report...Still an awesome day out by any means...Well done  Mooneye look a lot like herring...I wonder if they're just as tasty?
