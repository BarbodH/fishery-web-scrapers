Found some trout,       couple more of these guys kickin around  we however did not find any eyes which was our main target, although we caught tonnes of oos bass(all released) and i caught my first moon eye oh and this little guy my buddy caught while we were swimming in a deep pool LOL.

469488,l2p,2010-05-25 16:41:00,346,thanks guys yes the last two are pics are of a gar pike. we were all surprised trust me. we decided to take a dip because of the mid day heat and my buddy drew wanted to wade out as far as he could and continue fishing and all i remember was seeing him waving his arms up in chest deep water yelling fish on hahaha. who woulda thought a gar pike would hit a suspended crawler.
