I've seen all the reports on Nippising, but was wondering if anyone has seen the conditions on the French.  How are the water levels?  Is it still navigable?  How's the fishing? (we'll be targeting pike)  Thanks for any input!!"
469403,sandybay,2010-05-25 13:15:00,64,The upper French is the same as Nipissing.  about 60 cm below average.

469433,Rich Clemens,2010-05-25 14:55:00,3131,"I just got a note from Kevin as I asked the same question. Water levels are down and no relief in site. He's had to extend the floating docks a bit to get into some deeper water. Launching is a bit of a challenge, but they have launched some larger boats there. Would be nice if we could get a few pics of the launching area/docks to see what we're gonna run into here in a few weeks.  Capt Hooked ... ya on here ?"
469437,danbouck,2010-05-25 15:01:00,4380, I guess I'll bring the 4x4
