468922,Joey,2010-05-23 21:38:00,9122,"Headed up to do some piking on Simcoe this morning, and possibly rendevous with my sister and her new boat.  Not an early start, out on the water by 9:30 a.m.  The day wasn't sure if it wanted to be cloudy or sunny.  It was both and when it was sunny, it was pretty hot, but I'm not complaining.  The water was clear and the weeds were in bunches.  The pike were in the weeds and it was great to see them follow.  All in all we got two each with a bunch of follows, which is hard to take when they just won't commit        Paul boated the first one.    Then came my first after many ""almosts""    I didn't bother to take a pic of the next two.  My sister called about noon and said they were gonna try and find us.  They had no problem and we hooked up boats so we could go in and check out their new toy.  Here they come.  That's my niece and her boyfriend on the bow.    My sister Leslie, her husband Hamish and Becky, their white lab!    My niece Shauna.    All hooked up for a nice visit.    Paul trying to figure out where he wants to put the downriggers    Time to say goodbye and get back to fishing.  Nice boat they got for sure    The pike were not biting or following at all after that so we headed on home.  Cheers,  Joey"

469656,Cudz,2010-05-25 22:27:00,2652,I would say it is low.  The last 2 years I have targeted pike and only have a couple fish to show for it.  I fished cook's bay on Monday after fishing for whities and lakers in the morning and I tried for 2.5 hours without even a sniff.  Saw lots of percdh and sunfish and rock bass and bullhead but didn't even see one pike. Well done to Paul and Joey.
