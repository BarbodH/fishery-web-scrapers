468355,lew,2010-05-21 11:45:00,12766,I was wandering thru cyberspace and came across this comparison for tow vehicles and thought it may be an interesting read for anyone with a truck for a tow vehicle or anybody in the market to buy one in the near future.  http://www.trailerboats.com/output.cfm?id=2497141&sectionid=318
468388,Billy Bob,2010-05-21 13:02:00,5865,"Interesting but you have to take all these reports with a grain of salt....every time a manufacture comes out with a ""NEW"" truck it wins some kind of a award from some kind of a magazine.  Posting gas mileage of each truck towing and non towing would of been the most helpful thing but was not included and I have to ask WHY ? ? ?  Bob Tundra Owner"
468398,BillM,2010-05-21 13:28:00,17367,A towing article and not one diesel truck listed?  LOL!!!!!
468402,lew,2010-05-21 13:33:00,12766,"I didn't write the article guys, I just posted the link"
468404,Uncle Buck,2010-05-21 13:39:00,1000,tough crowd
468405,BillM,2010-05-21 13:42:00,17367," I wasn't bagging on you Lew, sorry if it came across like that    I just think that's a bit funny..."
468406,ecmilley,2010-05-21 13:42:00,2163,Lew you should be outside enjoying paradise not playing on the puter at 9:40am i am stuck at work here or i would be out in the boat right now
468411,lew,2010-05-21 13:50:00,12766," I WOULD be out in the boat Ernie, 'cept the ""real"" fishing doesn't open for another couple weeks yet"
468414,BillM,2010-05-21 13:55:00,17367,  So go out and troll for some 'bait'  
468523,FUSION,2010-05-21 20:15:00,81, Here you go Bill...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pD3RHquL5g  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJEyI6rmvqg  
468620,Fish Farmer,2010-05-22 02:22:00,2234,"Looks like the Ford ran away with everything. One thing with the ford, their frames are a lot bigger heavy duty and the hardware bolts are twice the size."
468625,Weeds,2010-05-22 02:46:00,782,"I've been looking to pick up a tow vehicle.  Have to admit, my Montana slips a bit on the steep ramps with nothing more than  12 foot aluminum but currently have her in the driveway with a 9x5 utility trailer full of crap and it will do just fine. It kind of bugs me that me 98% of ""tow"" vehicles  I see have one guy, no cargo, no tow."
468660,Billy Bob,2010-05-22 12:39:00,5865,"We call that ""The American Way""..."
468785,BillM,2010-05-23 03:02:00,17367," Love me some Powerstroke!!  Now if I could combine the Ford SuperDuty body, the Cummins I6 and the Allison Tranny I'd be in heaven"
468786,Billy Bob,2010-05-23 03:08:00,5865," And if you aunt had balls, she would be your uncle."
468851,jaydub,2010-05-23 13:52:00,145, I am a Ford truck guy all the way but I always find it a bit funny when they brag about the size of the bolts that hold thier box on...when's the last time someone just lost the box off thier truck cuz the bolt sheared...never? lol
469030,Fish Farmer,2010-05-24 11:58:00,2234,"I was talking about frames and bolts structure, nothing was mentioned about how the box was secured. All boxes are made of  tin Z-line or cold-roll"
469034,ch312,2010-05-24 12:27:00,1590," if that were the case, then why did they choose the ram as the winner?   the ram with a hemi is more powerful than the f-150 and the ride is MUCH better than both ford and the tundra. toyota would likely last longer though.  these tests are pretty much pointless anyways as any new half ton will be able to handle the loads that most average joe's will be hauling."
469070,Tybo,2010-05-24 15:11:00,1373,After another ten years of driving the GMC. I might start looking at thees comparison.  That should be 3 Rams for Marc and 2 fords for Lew and Irrishfield.
469088,Dara,2010-05-24 18:03:00,3052,I have a Tundra...I had a Ford....First guy that gives me a Ford can Have the Tundra. Dodge and GM cost too many tax dollars to even be considered.
469111,Fisherman,2010-05-24 20:04:00,7201,"We have 2 Ford 6.4 Powerjokes at work, one can't get under 20l/100km,(cab & a half), the other, a reg cab can't get under 17l/100km at the best of times,  I'll keep my 5.9 Cummins that regularly goes 12.5l/100km."
469164,irishfield,2010-05-24 22:27:00,26272,"Yep Ford screwed up big time with the 2007/8/9 Diesels... they use more fuel than my gas F-150.... even if you try to ""chip"" them!"
