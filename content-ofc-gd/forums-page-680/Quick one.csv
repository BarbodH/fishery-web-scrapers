After dinner the kids and I cast off the dock (perch and rocky hunting) to come up with my daughters biggest (but oss) bass of her life.  It was a whole 1.5LB's or so (just a guess as it wasn't even touched and did a self release when I told her to put it back in the water).  So now we have put the kids to bed and I load up my tinny to head of to my fav. spot on the lake for some wallaye's.  I put on my tried and true tested walleye lure and get all set.  First cast, WHAM!  I'm thinking hummm, no real fight it's got be be an eye    so I get it boat side and look for the net   I left it on the dock...  But it was a mighty fine 19"" eye, tasty too as we had it for lunch the next day.  So on Sat my wife and kids want to go for a boat ride, sure I say.  We launch the ""big"" boat and off we go.  The kids and I each decided it's best we bring a rod    while the Mrs was thinking of a nice boat ride...     As we went past my ""spot"" I hooked into another one at 24.5"".  This one went on the stringer for a slow rid back to get a pic and then let go to make more big fat eyes.  All and all, not to many fish this weekend but we all had a great weekend.  Geoff  Here is the 24.5"" one.  Go easy on my with my cottage gear on... "
