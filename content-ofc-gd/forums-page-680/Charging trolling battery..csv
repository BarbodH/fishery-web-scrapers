Given that you are using reasonable caution, I can't see how recharging in the boat can hurt anything. About on-board chargers... Many boats have three or more large heavy batteries.  Most guys have on-board chargers that are wired to the batteries.  At the end of the day, to recharge, you simply plug-in to a power source."
469097,irishfield,2010-05-24 18:33:00,26272,You don't have to unhook it from the boat.. but if it's a wireless Motorguide.. you are supposed to unhook the trolling motor from the plug in socket before charging the batteries.
