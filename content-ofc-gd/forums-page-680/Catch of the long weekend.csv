469330,stasbrute,2010-05-25 02:55:00,206,Nice fish!!!!
469339,mistyjr1,2010-05-25 03:24:00,97," I dont really know what happened to the reel, but for a reel meant to be paired with the ML that came in the combo im not surprised though.    Yeah i did get scratched by the spikes (or scutes?) on the side, the reason i had to grab her like that was because when i grabbed it by the tail it kicked and almost knocked me into the water, with the fish so i decided this would be the better choice, but no they didnt itch, only thing that itched from the weekend was the bug bites."
469363,fish_fishburn,2010-05-25 11:18:00,1311,I caught one two yrs ago on the Ottawa while tubing a shoal for sm bass. I felt a hit and set the hook and the fight was on. It towed my bass boat 100 yrds into deeper water and then turned around and towed me back to the shoal. When I got her up to the boat my jig was about 1 inch above her tail. I had no net and had to tail her. Finally got her in the boat a weighed her on my digital scales and she was 38 lbs. Awesome fish Corey way to go.
469365,Whopper,2010-05-25 11:29:00,2174,Congrats Corey!

469125,mistyjr1,2010-05-24 21:31:00,97,"We went camping on the May 24 and this was the big fish of the weekend...      Back she goes...    Fish took me 25+ minutes to get in. Biggest fish on my life, best fight, dont know if i will ever catch another one.  Fishing is like a box of chocolates you never know what your gonna catch, Corey"
469127,Terry,2010-05-24 21:33:00,14456,nice going  I have never landed one of them yet.......  I have had them on

469136,smitter,2010-05-24 21:44:00,106,That. Is. Awesome!
469139,glen,2010-05-24 21:51:00,2641,Great fish Corey.  I have never caught one. Were you targeting them or were you fishing for something else? Did the fish jump at all?
469144,camillj,2010-05-24 21:56:00,1988,Thats one HUGE speck ! Thanks for sharing
469145,mistyjr1,2010-05-24 21:56:00,97," We were actually targeting suckers, as thats all we really knew was there at this time of year.  I caught it with a 7' MH, 12# mono, and a now broken spinning reel, with a jig and a worm.  Yes the fish jumped a few times but the first jump was definitely the best as she cleared the water."
469147,fishing n autograph,2010-05-24 21:57:00,2540,What body of water were you fishing?
469149,glen,2010-05-24 21:59:00,2641,Sounds like my kind of fight.  Well done in landing it.  What happened to your reel?
469154,fishindude,2010-05-24 22:07:00,220,"Looks like the Notty, I was told recently that they are in there.  Congrats on the catch, definitely a fish of a lifetime. Good for ya!"

469171,silverstreak,2010-05-24 22:57:00,146,Cool catch. Hope you changed your shirt since then
469181,ChrisK,2010-05-24 23:24:00,2772,"Dude,that is one big fish !! Congrads and great pics too....Bet you could catch more sturgeon if you went still fishing for them..."
469201,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-24 23:54:00,0,sweet!  did you get scratched by the scutes?  did they itch?

469321,Rattletrap2,2010-05-25 02:39:00,1652,"Very nice! Quite the shock if you were expecting suckers....and along comes that beast!  Like others have said, that really is the fish of a lifetime. Not everyone can say they have caught one! I certainly could not."
