466244,F7Firecat,2010-05-13 23:58:00,347,new xbox360 game just released today!  
466245,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-14 00:04:00,4399,  Good one Laps!!
466705,F7Firecat,2010-05-15 11:35:00,347,HAAAAALLLLAAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK  
467128,blaque,2010-05-17 12:25:00,2419,"Didnt catch the whole game, but Yikes"
467131,solopaddler,2010-05-17 12:31:00,8605,"Amazing game last night, that was sweet."
467132,blaque,2010-05-17 12:33:00,2419," ""sweet"" = understatement"
467138,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-17 13:01:00,4399,"As games go not a great game, and remember the series is a best of seven and not a best of one!!!"
467146,solopaddler,2010-05-17 13:09:00,8605," I'm not a Habs fan, but beyond Halak I've just been amazed by Camelleri. His size, skill and feistiness reminds me of Gilmour in his glory days.  Calgary gave Dougie away to the Leafs back in the day. I think they hung their hat on the wrong guy last summer when they kept Iginla.  Anyhow beyond last night it's been exciting hockey to watch.  I aint gonna wish the Habs luck but I can still admire them (jealously  ).  Go Flyers!  (I'm not a Philly fan either, I just despise them less.  )"
467155,Grimace,2010-05-17 13:23:00,2020,Iginla is awesome.  Cammalerri is as well.  Calgary made the mistake by going after bouwmeester who is way overated. Tried to fix it by going after a bunch of leafs junk.  I love cammalerri but comparing him to Gilmour is a stretch.  Having said all that I could not agree more with how impressive he has been these playoffs and his puck pursuit is awesome. He wants it.
467189,JohnF,2010-05-17 14:33:00,3494,"I'm starting to get the Habs' strategy. That game nearly put me to sleep so I expect it did the same to the Flyers.  Lull the other team to sleep with a crappy game, then come out guns ablazin' and catch them with their pants down and their egos up. I'd be surprised if the other Habs team doesn't show up before this series is over.  JF"
467799,blaque,2010-05-19 13:47:00,2419,9-0 in first two games  Double Yikes
467814,anders,2010-05-19 15:19:00,1168,A little bit or reality and it sure is quite here...Halak and Camelleri are probably tired from carrying this team for 14 games.
467852,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-19 16:41:00,4399,More than a little disappointing and at this point all I want to see is the Habs score a goal!LOL
467859,JohnF,2010-05-19 17:02:00,3494,"Well, on the bright side they were only half as bad as game 1.  I think it's just a strategic move anyway. They're gonna lose 1-0 the thrid game letting the Flyers get cocky(ier?) and then they're gonna blow them away in a 4 game sweep eclipsing the Flyers' own accomplishments.  Yeah, right.  JF"
467864,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-19 17:08:00,10439,"  Yep, they're just lulling the Flyers into a false sense of security!!!"
467898,blaque,2010-05-19 19:13:00,2419,And in good faith in regards to the earlier classless vandalizing Hab Fan posts. Heres one to show that theres bad apples on my side of the border as well.  Canadian Journalists Car Vandalized
468283,yakpiker,2010-05-21 01:55:00,160,Habs were bound to score sooner or later...let's hope they saved some goals for the rest of the games.  We have the makings of a series.
469108,blaque,2010-05-24 19:59:00,2419,Bump.  Dont mean that as in im bumping the thread. Just thought it was fitting since the Habs may get bumped tonite.
469121,JohnF,2010-05-24 21:21:00,3494," As much as I'd get a kick out of another Habs' win I suspect they may be running short of rabbits in that magician's hat. The Flyers appear to have too many answers for the Habs unfortunately.  But the Habs have sure been fun to watch this year and if they can take it further I say ""Go Habs!""  JF"
469324,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-25 02:45:00,0,"WOW! The Flyers played really aggressive. But Chicago is also playing some great hockey. Its gonna be a great final!!!  I gotta give credit to where its due. The Habs played great! Everyone was talking about Halak but the credit goes to the entire team. These guys were really hungry to win. Over 300 blocked shots after the first 2 series, setting an NHL record, and almost 400 at the end of this series.  These guys went well beyond what anyone expected on pure heart! I think that quite a few Habs deserve a little bonus for their playoff run."
469325,irishfield,2010-05-25 02:46:00,26272,Just like a fishing trip... all good things must come to an end !
469343,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-25 03:47:00,4399,Go Chicago Go!!!
469408,blaque,2010-05-25 13:40:00,2419,All i can say is that i hope my team goes in as a 7th or 8th seed next season.
469661,yakpiker,2010-05-25 22:38:00,160,"The Habs provided a glimmer of hope and a ton of entertainment during the playoffs.  Philly outplayed them by a wide margin.  Too bad that I've disliked the Flyers since the mid-70's.  I'll be rooting for Chicago in the finals...although I don't expect to watch many of the games.  Just like the Habs, it's time for me to do more fishing and golfing!"
465966,muskymatt,2010-05-13 15:05:00,2608,  Ok .......BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
465976,scuro2,2010-05-13 15:38:00,904,"Perhaps the habby fans are ""celebrating"" after each series because deep in their hearts they know the Canadiens can never win the cup?"
465979,JohnF,2010-05-13 15:54:00,3494," Congratulations. You may the very last person in the world who believes that, deep in yer heart. Most of the rest of us aren't sure what the habs can't do any more. They've made fools out of a lot of ""experts"" this year. I'm sure there are a lot of folks who won't be surprised if they falter, and a lot who will delight in them failing, but not very many foolish enuf to be absolutely certain they'll fail.  JF  JF"
465983,anders,2010-05-13 15:59:00,1168," Thats exactly it...im sure there are gangs involved and causing most of the issues, but the fans seem to hit the street and initiate it in my mind, however, i could be wrong and hope i am.  But aint it sweet that the Wings and Pens are out!  There is a hockey GOD!!"
465986,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-13 16:02:00,4399,"  Now there you go talking out of yer   again,we are going to have to win the Cup this year to shut you up...then again if we are fortunate enough to bring home number 25 you would probably still have something stupid to say!!!"
465999,Mike Pike,2010-05-13 16:36:00,1332,That wasn't looting or vandalism after the game.  It was a Canadiens tailgate.
466008,Twocoda,2010-05-13 16:48:00,4130,i hope the habs continue their run for the cup cuz part of the fun is the fan bantering back and forth ....although it is a shame things get outta control in and out of the stadium...but you just chalk that up to a distinctive society....maybe we should all boycott french toast for a week so the frogs can get the message they arent representing CANADA'S GAME very well...they need to quit acting like americans and switch to the classy side...  hows this for stirring the pot?
466020,anders,2010-05-13 17:09:00,1168, hows this for stirring the pot?   Pretty Good
466027,canadadude,2010-05-13 17:23:00,769,"The dude in the second picture has punk ganster crap in his eyes,he just put a habs jersey on that don't make him a fan.He's got gangster written all over him, this is Montreal there ain't no crips or bloods dude get outa the 80's and outa L.A. It's a different animal in Montreal but the same colour spots"
466029,blaque,2010-05-13 17:26:00,2419," Hey, there the ones sporting our Red White and Blue. WANNABEES!!!"
466032,canadadude,2010-05-13 17:33:00,769,"That prooves my point exactly.....the public thinks the fans initiate it!! It's a perfect cover for the gangsters.You dudes don't get it!!!.....even the media don't get it,they blame the fans and the gangs get a free ride to cause havock and loot what they can. It isn't that hard to understand but hey it happens in cities all over that win championships. The fans are saying ""GO HABS GO"" and the gangs are saying if they win ""free ride tonight"" the fans will take the blame."
466045,anders,2010-05-13 17:52:00,1168,"No....we get it....as my previous post said...""i could be wrong and i hope i am""...i did more looking into to today...not on this site, and i found some truth."
466046,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-13 17:55:00,0,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, the phenomenon that is the habs fan...  nobody more obnoxious when they are winning, nobody more venomous when they are losing."
466050,canadadude,2010-05-13 18:08:00,769,"hahahahahah I agree with that we don't take loosing well and yes we can be obnoxious when we're winning but at least we're not leaf fans who can't remember winning and accept years of loosing and still cheer for there incompitent teams.I mean the Toronto Maple Leafs are the most successfull loosers in sports, the team sticks it to the fans year in year out and still there stands are full with highest ticket prices in hockey. I just don't get it, how can leaf fans keep getting blatantly screwed and still be fans of the team."
466053,anders,2010-05-13 18:17:00,1168,sucker for punishment maybe???  or its just the suits that always fill the seats working on the crackberry while a hockey game is on.
466056,Dutchy,2010-05-13 18:23:00,416," Got to vote with your wallet and your feet, sort of as Anders points out above though that will not likely happen. Before the Pens got Crosby and even for the first year he was there, they were getting attendance as low as 8000. Its the only way things improve when the money stops coming in."
466061,canadadude,2010-05-13 18:37:00,769,"I agree not going to happen in Toronto, there's no pride left in the team, the fans just accept there loosers and still they keep buying leafs crap and supporting a looser. The only time they put together a decent team is when a bunch of young kids trying to break in the NHL get a chance to play.Unfortunatly the leafs like to burn out there tallent in the minors then trade them, the worst thing for a minor hockey star is to get drafted by the leafs, you'll be playing for the marlies for 5yrs while they pay ole hasbeen players millions to skate around Saturday night.The leaf franchise is a joke"
466070,anders,2010-05-13 19:01:00,1168,"i wonder if most of the attendees to leaf games are fans of the rival team.  It would be interesting to see the statistics on that...how many ""real"" leaf fans, how many rival fans and how many there to do business...i bet the leafs fans would be close to a minority...pretty sad the people in the nose bleeds...those are the real fans!....by the way i hate the leafs just as much or if not more then Montreal....just trying to bring the thread back to where it was"
466087,canadadude,2010-05-13 19:25:00,769,"Keep hating the habs all the way to the cup hahahahahhaah......I freaking love it, ya sorry for jacking the thread and your right the leaf tickets are sold out to corporations and scalpers.I've been a habs fan all my life and it's been 17yrs since we were this far in the playoffs so it's been awhile.That is truely a long time for a habs fan, we use to win the cup at least once every 10 years, still gotta a ways to go for that. Weather it's Philly or Boston for the east final it's going to be a tough series one step at a time.I am however enjoying the hockey, if the ref's let them play, the 5 on 5 hockey in both the pens and caps series was great playoff hockey, very fast end to end or tons of pressure with outstanding goaltending.I sort of feel bad for fleury he played an outstanding game 5 and made some key saves in game 7, I mean he kept it 2-0 were it could have been 5-0 after period 1.The Penguins defence was pathetic in the first period and even worse to start the second, Gonchar was in another world and Malkin was handing the Habs the puck the whole game!Crosby was even confused after he took a penalty in the first minute. Pittsburg showed how they could play during the last halph of the second period and got 2 goals but couldn't carry that intensity into the 3rd."
466133,anders,2010-05-13 20:25:00,1168,it really has been great hockey...nice to see almost everyone picking it up for the real season!
466137,walleyejigger,2010-05-13 20:29:00,876,"GO HABS GOOOOOO!!!!  another exciting game for this habs fan,  as well as Halak has played, and all the heart the players have put in, i think the major downfall for pitts. and wash. was the lack luster performance by Fleury and Varlamov, no where near playoff grade hockey, easy to deflate a team when the opponent keeps scoring average goals within the first few minutes of most games,  lookin forward to the next series, not sure who i'd rather see, always liked the bruins rivalry, and mtl has a very good reg. season record against them this year, i still think we'd have an easier time facing the flyers even though the record doesnt show it, either way the goalies from the 3 teams are playing good hockey, it'll be another fun one  GO HABS GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
466160,scuro2,2010-05-13 21:15:00,904," I was talking to a friend about this and I liked his observation. He said that hab fans are like Peacocks. That sums it up perfectly. If hab fans want to make a point of displaying their plumage every chance they get, if a group has a chip on their collective shoulder....well it's just natural that people want to knock it off. "
466182,Leecher,2010-05-13 21:50:00,7832,I'll give you that scu...... you certainly don't give up do you
466185,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-13 21:53:00,4399,"I have been a Montreal fan since 1960 and there was a stretch where us Habs fans were a little spoiled 10 cups in 15 years, things are different now things have been a little lean for a long while. I certainly can understand how some find Montreal fans obnoxious loosing can be frustrating,Boston 38 years of nothing,Toronto 43 years of nothing,Philly 35 years of nothing,Chicago 49 years of nothing,Buffalo 40 years of nothing and my Habs nothing in 17 years.  I guess what I am saying is if you find this Habs fan or any other to be a PITA tough deal with it!!!  Go Habs Go"
466210,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-13 22:31:00,0," If they don't make the play offs again(which I think they will), there will be a backlash. When Philadelphia bombed the last time, the old Philly players were complaining(I think they were picketing) that they were too wimpy. Add muscle and look at them now. If it weren't for injuries? They would have wiped the floor with Boston.  I heard Cammalleri was supposed to play for Toronto and he turned them down. I wonder if he would have been as good in Toronto. No one wants to play for Toronto, but all that will change next year hopefully. We have a good team as long as we can stay healthy, we will do fine. We need a coach change."
465822,Dutchy,2010-05-13 01:41:00,416,"As a Pens fans I have to say the right team went through. Well done Habs  :clapping:  And I cannot stand Philly or Boston, so I have to support the Habs to come out of the east"
465823,Roe Bag,2010-05-13 01:42:00,246,Unbelievable. Amazing! Who'd a thunk?
465825,Paully,2010-05-13 01:48:00,712,What an upset.... Washington must feel better now! lol
465828,backbay,2010-05-13 01:50:00,773,"Wow, the cup back in Canada?!?!?"
465831,Leecher,2010-05-13 01:52:00,7832,I'll repeat myself..... the best team won tonight!!!  GO HABS GO!!!!
465835,F7Firecat,2010-05-13 01:55:00,347,Here we go boys this could be the year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  HALAK!!!!!!!
465837,Syn,2010-05-13 01:56:00,519,You know who you are...      Go Habs GO
465840,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-13 01:58:00,0,"Congratulations to the Montreal fans. You guys are certainly riding the wave. I only caught the 2nd half of the game. I heard the Pittsburgh fans cheering like crazy and thought the Habs were getting owned. When I saw the score? I cheered.lol  Like I said after game 5. Even though Montreal lost? They looked like they could win this series. And like I said, they would only have to score 3 goals since Pittsburgh has a hard time scoring more than 2 goals on Halak to win.  Glad I caught the end.Now I have to search on the satelite for the game. But whats with Gill and all these crappy penalties? He needs to smarten up.  Now that they beat Pittsburgh? I dont want them to go any further because they will rub it in on the leaf fans.lol Unfortunately they are the only Canadian team left so there is no one else to cheer for.  I think Boston or San Hose(more than likely) may take it."
465841,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-13 02:02:00,709,  i respect people like you!
465846,yakpiker,2010-05-13 02:14:00,160," Once again, the Hab haters are proven wrong and left disappointed.  A big thank you to Sid the Kid for winning us the gold medal."
465847,F7Firecat,2010-05-13 02:22:00,347,GO HABS GO!!!!
465850,Rizzo,2010-05-13 02:39:00,4754,"that eating crow photo is classic. I actually had just said to my wife ""I have to go eat some crow"" on OFC because on a previous thread i had predicted Pens in 5. well done Montreal."
465864,PikeMolester,2010-05-13 04:41:00,428,ohh myyy goooddddd....I was at the bell center with 20000 people. Loudest crap I ever heard. My ears are ringing and I got no voice. My friend got hit in the head with a police baton on st-catherines and drummond at the fire LOL but freakin EPIC NIGHT! INSANE!
465900,scuro2,2010-05-13 11:51:00,904,"Yeah...Montreal dun good, they earned the victory. Don't mean I gotta like it. Wished the Bruins had won last night. If there was a silver lining in this it would be a Bruins Canadiens semi-final. I wonder how Cherry would handle that."
465907,canadadude,2010-05-13 12:17:00,769,"Awsome game right from the start,throwing the cry baby Crosby in the box was epic,I guess the refs let him know game 7 is a mans game and not for babies.Bring on Philly or Boston it don't matter the Habs are a determined ""Team"" right now working together as a team.Halak is awsome which gives the whole team confidence and they continue to play as a team.It's great to be excited about hockey again, us hab fans have waited along time for this."
465908,blaque,2010-05-13 12:22:00,2419,"Congrats to the Habs..........sincerely, the team looks fantastic. Gonchar, i hope he had a broken leg or something to excuse his indifferent performance.  Better board up the local businesses and get the tear gas ready for round three"
465914,JohnF,2010-05-13 12:50:00,3494," Yeah. What was up with Gonchar. On that one goal (I think the short-handed one) he looked like a pylon standing there. That's not his style.  Now that it's done I feel kinda bad for the Pens. They were one of my faves (after the leafs of course) the last few years but I just couldn't help getting caught up in the effort from the habs. If only they didn't have that dickhead laPierre playing for them I might really get to like this current team. Each time he got near Cooke I was hoping they'd beat the snot out of each other and get thrown out.  I suspect the Habbies are earning themselves a lot of new fans for the long term, or at least a higher degree of respect from hockey fans generally. The test will be to see if it can survive the return to regular competition.  One last observation. Credit to the Pens bench for not putting Cooke out for the last shift. Being the classy dude he is it would have only resulted in one of the habs being run headfirst into the boards or being cut down with a blind-side elbow. They went out like gentlemen. Shero made the trip to shake Gainey's hand with a minute remaining in the game. And Crosby was standup in his post-game interview, although a little clumsy, but that's forgiveable, given the jolt they'd had.  JF"
465920,otter649,2010-05-13 13:02:00,118,The Habs after beating The Caps & now The Pens still will not have home ice advantage in the next series since they were seeded 8th at the start of the playoffs in the eastern conference - Well done Boys........
465926,anders,2010-05-13 13:34:00,1168,"Congrats to the habs...they deserve a pat on the back...well done...and i hate saying that...due to that fact that i am bruins fan and despise the habs....but again...Congrats to Halak...oops i mean the habs,  HOWEVER....to the fans...enjoy the win by all means, but SERIOUSLY...WHATS WITH THE RIOTING AND LOOTING...YOU DIDNT WIN ANYTHING YET!!!  I would seriously worry if they did win the cup, what would happen, burn down the Molson Centre????Seriously some fans give them a bad name...i know not all are like that, but that does not look good....what would have happened if they lose??   Sorry about that...looking forward to a Bruins/Canadiens Conf Finals."
465932,JohnF,2010-05-13 13:51:00,3494, Next fall the same rioters will be booing the Habs if they don't keep winning. They're not as forgiving as Leafs fans.  JF
465933,canadadude,2010-05-13 13:51:00,769,"It's not the Fans doing the looting and rioting,it's the street gangs using the fans as cover.The looting and crap started after most of the fan celebrations ended and fans left.Thats when the drunk'in street gangs decide to take over and use the celebrations as there chance to provoke the police and start all the crap."

They pretty much will take Pittsburgh(and most other teams), since Pittsburgh is lucky if it can get more than 2 goals on Halak.He should have had the last goal. The other two?

464742,scuro2,2010-05-10 01:21:00,904,"Maybe the whole psychology of the hab fan is another thing that spurs me on. I've often noticed Hab fans relish every opportunity they have to rub it in with leaf fans. I suspect that back in the 70's or in the 90's, when Montreal won cups, many of our habs fans on this forum were little habby fans rooting for a winner instead of showing loyalty to an Ontario team. Just like it was way too easy to become a Yankee fan or Cowboys fan in different eras of time. That was okay before the internet where the odd hab fan at work wasn't so overly annoying. But with the internet you got annoying squared, no annoying cubed. So I'm speaking for all the long suffering leaf fans. If your a hab fan and live in Ontario, take your small victories and relish them in isolation. If you want to have an internet parade every time your team accomplishes something don't be wondering why others on an ONTARIO forum might not be giving it right back at ya!!  Montreal has been hobbled. It's not looking good!"
464806,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-10 12:14:00,0,From what I seen in game 5? The Habs may have a chance to win. The key is Halak.They need to give him more support. Halak was beat on screen shots. They basically have to keep the Pens from screening the goalie and be more aggressive against the point men.  it will be interesting to see what happens tonight.
464823,Marty,2010-05-10 12:46:00,873,"Unfortunately for my Pens, the Habs have proven that as long as they stay out of the box, they are in every game.   I cringe with every defensive turnover because I know the Habs can convert.  Even though Flower has made some great saves, he can't help but get too aggressive at times and be a half second out of position.   We've been pretty lucky so far but . . .  This one is hardly a done deal.  Oh and, by the way, WAKE UP KID!"

465131,irishfield,2010-05-11 02:32:00,26272,Hey MARTY !! Sid finally got his goal...  
463971,JohnF,2010-05-07 14:22:00,3494," Pre-Bettman days hockey was a two-way game. That meant, among other things, that both teams were penalized for the same things. Lately it seems you get a free pass if your name is Sid, or if your team is in one of the American markets Bettman is trying to exploit - I mean, turn into the new hockey hotbed because of the huge potential revenue stream.  Perhaps you get different coverage down there but up here in the frozen north our commentators have been running replays of the more blatant examples of this. When they start talking about it you can figure it's gotten out of hand. Even the Mouth-That-Roared (Don Cherry) is taking exception to it and he's generally the last guy to object to rough stuff. Sidney got away with a lot of crap and drew a few cheap penalties for the same crap. Much of that was caught on camera. Everybody is pushing the envelope but it seems the favoured few get away with more and draw penalties easier than ever this year. I guess Bettman et al would choke if the featured players all get eliminated by also rans. Even NBC is threatening to drop coverage if there are no big teams involved in the final. That must concern Bettman given that his entire business plan is predicated on developing the cash-rich American market.  As I've said, I'm generally not a Habs fan. In fact I tend to really dislike the Habs as a team, I don't really know why other than that I've always been a leaf fan, even when I had friends playing on other original six teams or local kids who came through our minor system. I yam what I yam, an ex-hockey playing Canuck kid who just hasn't got caught up in Bettman's grand plan to turn hockey into a major market cash cow.  I think it's almost impossible for any informed hockey fan (other than those who have over-indulged in the Koolaid of their chosen team) to deny the kick to be had from watching the bottom-dwellers kick some high flying butt the way the Habs have been doing. Yeah, they've got a hot goalie right now, but they're also scoring more goals on fewer shots, blocking shots, line matching and killing penalties like a bugger. It's the classic rags to riches story, and it's about our beloved hockey. This could even outdo the win in '72 for Canadian and Canadien fans if the Habbies can keep turning the tables.  Go Habs (at least until you meet the Canucks in the final, like that might actually happen)  JF"
463972,JohnF,2010-05-07 14:24:00,3494, That's the hope here as well.  JF
463980,Marty,2010-05-07 14:39:00,873,"I'm not a big conspiracy theorist John and my belief is that people who use the Commisioner of any league (baseball, football or hockey) as a reason that specific games are officiated differently in order to favor a player or network media are looking for excuses.  This game is played on the ice and not in the front office.  The Habs, unlike their fans, don't need excuses.  You hit the nail on the head with respect to this series.   The Habs are the most efficient team I've seen in a long time. I cringe with every turnover. Combine that with the smoking hot goalie, it spells trouble for the Pens.   The Pens lack of efficiency and absence of Sid may very well send them packing. I just hope Sid and Gino kick it in gear and they start finding the back of the net.  Otherwise, I think I'll schedule a tee time for them next week."
463990,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-07 14:55:00,0, Exactly. I notice the refs are leaning towards the American teams.  And I hope the refs start making some goalie interference calls in regards to Luongo.
464009,blarg,2010-05-07 15:25:00,289,"i dont think the refs are biased one way or the other, i just think they are making more mistakes, it is almost as though the refs themselves have bought into the ""its the fastest and hardest game to referee in the world"" that kind of statement puts them above criticism because 'no one else could do better', and some of the worse calls or non calls ive seen this playiff year were made when the players were mostly still with the ref standing right next to them. Seems to me it has gone to their heads, that said I think the biggest problem with the NHL, and it is related to a lot of the fans out there, is the let em play in the playoffs mentality. It is a difficult game to call but it is made much more so by the inconsistent officiating both during the regular season and then of course payoffs.  This is likely made worse by having two different referees, with two different approaches to calling a game, on the ice at the same time.  Basically no knows from game to game which of the marginal infractions will be called or not called, it cheapens the game imo, call the game the same year round, full stop."
464023,scuro2,2010-05-07 16:04:00,904,"Lots of whine here with the hab fans. Yes there were bad calls...both ways. Problem with Montreal fans are that they are irrational and can't see this, they think it is an American conspiracy. Nor can they see that there team is a hack 8th place finisher who got into the playoffs not on their own accord. Halik is the beginning the middle and the end of this story.  Yet, this Jersey style of play might work for Montreal...trap plus grab plus super awesome goal tending but then the Hab fans shouldn't complain about boring because it is Montreal that is afraid to play on open game until they have a lead. Like the old Jersey they play better with a lead. Only problem is that Montreal can't rely on Pittsburg to score the winning goal every game like last night!  Finally, we are in a different era and Crosby has a right to be upset with daily mugging he gets from Gil. The Montreal fanboys should stop whining about those justified calls. The rules changed to allow for athletic skill. But, as long as there are the non-calls for interference Pittsburg should do a Chicago. Crash the net."
464025,ctranter,2010-05-07 16:06:00,543,"I don't hate the habs because I am a leaf fan.  I hate the habs because they are the ONLY team in the NHL that is (and has always been) characertized by diving, faking injuries, and other soccer-like behaviour.  That being said I love Montreal, and the people of Montreal, but their teams unsportsmanlike behaviour is always talked about, but quickly forgotten."
464034,JohnF,2010-05-07 16:37:00,3494," I'm generally not much of a conspiracy theorist either, but too many people in the know (knowledgable media types particularly) are starting to comment on how desperate Bettman must be getting with all the troubles his crazy new markets are experiencing. This latest fiasco in Phoenix is a great example. Bettman has manipulated the NHL into a real jackpot there. Apparently his latest rescue deal is in jeopardy. Hopefully he won't pull the same kind of bailout stunt in Tampa, Atlanta etc. or the NHL is gonna find itself the sole owner of the whole league with a few original team exceptions and Gary will have some 'splainin' to do. When I say he's influencing the calls I'm exaggerating a tad, I hope. But I have no doubt there's a strong undercurrent of pressure to take care of Sid and the other newer market teams with big population draws (hence more revenue stream potential). The league fell into that routine years ago, taking care of the big draws. There's a popular opinion that Gary would have liked nothing better than to see something like a NY/Washington or NY/Philly final if that were possible. A Pitt/Wash pairing would be next. If it was ever something like Calgary/Edmonton he'd probably just slit his wrists. I know those are impossible final pairings but I'm just hypothesizing here.  Gino and Sid are both having great moments but the consistency isn't there. That's one of the reasons I don't think Halak should get all the credit. The Habs are doing a great job of checking those guys most of the time and may not be getting enough credit for that.  JF"
464037,JohnF,2010-05-07 16:43:00,3494," You can bet Vancouver is going to get some goalie interference penalties now, against them. They've warned they're going to adopt the same style as Chicago around the net since the refs aren't interested in calling it. Watch the refs policy change now though.  JF"

Yes there were bad calls...both ways. The problem with Montreal fans is that they are irrational and can't judge with any objectivity. They think there is an American conspiracy between Betman and the refs  . Nor can they see that their team is a hack 8th place finisher who got into the playoffs not by beating the leafs but by other teams getting eliminated. The only thing you need to know about Montreal's shocking playoff run is the name Halik. He is the beginning the middle and the end of this story.  This Jersey style of play might work for Montreal...trap, plus grab, plus super awesome goal tending. Now Hab fans shouldn't complain about boring hockey because that is the only style of hockey Montreal can win. They tried open hockey in game one and got smoked. Now they are afraid to play an open game until they have a lead. Like the old Jersey teams the trap works better when the other team is desperate and pinches their defence men. Only problem is that Montreal isn't NJ and has few skilled players. They can't rely on Pittsburg to score another game winning goal like last night!  Finally, we are in a different era and Crosby has a right to be upset with daily mugging he gets from Gil. The Montreal fanboys should stop whining about those justified calls from the refs. The rules changed to allow for more athletic skill and less clutch and grab. What Pittsburg should do now is take advantage of lack of interference calls.

I doubt I'll fall enuf under their spell to forsake my hapless Leafs next season but they're my boyz for now.  Go Habs ( but not next season!)  JF"

464304,JohnF,2010-05-08 15:21:00,3494," The Habs are just efficient. Why waste a lot of energy on outshooting yer opponent when you know it only takes one goal to beat him? I'll admit that a few (LaPierre for example) might be keen to run up the score but he's constantly proving he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer although frequently still useful.  On another note, is anyone else watching the Canada/Italy game on TSN? Stamkos is looking good, naturally.  JF  JF"
464309,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-08 15:33:00,0," The only game they outshot their opponents, they lost, so I like the strategy of tiring out their opponents, playing defensive and waiting for the other team to make errors.  All courtesy of Jacques Martin. A defensive coach that I wanted the leafs to acquire."
464367,walleyejigger,2010-05-08 19:27:00,876,"first, GO HABS GO  second, we're not delousional, we know our team is not the greatest, but to put 2 of the top teams in the league to the test proves that maybe they arent so great after all, they're human, they can be beat on any given night, just like anybody else, so all the low ball teams who think getting the #1 pick in the draft is the way to the cup, hopefully they'll give their head  a shake, alot of heart and grit can go just as far as a alot of talent,   third, who ever says there's no point in finishing 8th, has no fan base to begin with  i've said it before and will say it again, losing 4 straight in the 1st round is WAAAAYYYYY better than not making the playoffs at all, unless the team  dont care about the fans, and the fans dont care about the team,  fourth, neener, neener, neener  fifth, GO HABS GO  Side note... TSN commentators are saying Halak is worthy of the playoff MVP already, do you think it's possible to give it to a player if they dont make past the second round? how bout third round? i wonder wich MVP has been ousted the earliest in the league history,  personally i dont think it should be given to a palyer who isnt in the finals, but thats just me, any thoughts?"
464383,JohnF,2010-05-08 20:03:00,3494,I kinda think that what I'm liking best about the Habs winning now is that my Lowly Leafs beat 'em in the last game of the regular season. This kinda stuff restores my flagging faith.  JF
464427,Mike the Pike,2010-05-08 22:34:00,3421,"Go Habs Go yes I am a habs fan but when there losing I never put them down.  Well if they don't win the cup it won't change my life May after all is one of the best times of year to go fishing and that is where my priority is.Some of these guys make more than my annual salary playing just a a game or 2.What I do like right now is hockey is good for the Quebec economy.  Restaurants,sportsbars and pubs are full during the tough economic times its great to see some benefits of Hockey.Must be the same in Vancouver.  Now if the habs don't win the cup it would be sweet to see Vancouver take it.  With that said lets bring the cup back to Canada"
464428,Dutchy,2010-05-08 22:40:00,416,"Go Pens! Show the Habs what real hockey is, not that clutch and grab crap. Thats all montreal has got."
464472,Moosebunk,2010-05-09 00:14:00,3970,"My bet is... Scuro will keep bashing and ranting about the Habs team that out performs his Leafs, now, then and as always.  While John will continue to praise this Habs team in hopes of finding some sort of awkward way to restore faith in his Leafs.  (I do like that approach a little better John. lol... creative and supportive)  Make it easier on yourselves dooooooooooooooooods and just accept you've been beaten again, and switch to the team that as always given their fans more that just head and heartaches."

464543,Roy,2010-05-09 07:10:00,13728,Congrats to your Pens Marty...they did good.
464583,JohnF,2010-05-09 13:29:00,3494,"Yeah, I guess it's time to throw in the towel. My leafs aren't even going to make it reincarnated as Habs.  With Gill probably gone now on top of Markov and Spacek, Guerin back, 71 hitting his stride and Fleury having discovered Halak's bottle of the magic goalie elixir I think the Habbies may well be toast. But that was a great effort for a team that was written off half a season back. I have a newfound respect for the Habs that may even last beyond the opening game next season.  Go Canucks! And if they buy the ranch too I'm really screwed cuz my next choice was Detroit. No way I can bring meself to cheer for any team with Cooke on it so I guess I may be a Boston fan before bass season is upon us. If they go down then my love and loyalty switches to the Hawks. I'm not fickle, just highly adaptable.  JF"

I still love hearing the 21,000 crybabies looking for a call when a Hab gets hit or whine when a clear boarding call is made.   Get a grip people.  I thought you knew how hockey is played.  Are there enough tissues in Montreal to keep it up?"
463957,Oeey3109,2010-05-07 13:55:00,15,"  I agree...I had alot of respect for the Montreal fans before last night.  There is obviously a great passion in the fan base, but they sure don't seem to know much about playoff hockey.  Throwing trash all over the ice and yelling at the refs??  Real classy.  Heaven for bid if you would have lost the game...lots of cheese would have had to be ordered to go with that whine.  What a shame.  Should be a good remainder of the series...thought here is that the superior team will prevail in a 7-game battle."

461103,jediangler,2010-04-29 02:34:00,1923,Wouldn't it be great if the Habs beat the Pens and the Bruins beat the Flyers? A Bruins verses Habs eastern final would go a long way to prove that the NorthEast division is the best in hockey today. The NorthEast was the only division in the NHL to send 4 teams to the post-season.
461115,yakpiker,2010-04-29 02:52:00,160, Good for you...Halak was unreal in this series and Montreal didn't stand a chance without him.  The odds are equally high against them getting past Pittsburgh.  It's been a long time since 1993 so us Habs fans have a lot of bottled up enthusiasm.
461124,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-29 03:13:00,4399,  Like the Washington series it will come down to goaltending!  Fleury was 35 in the league in save percentage and 24 in goals against!!!  If Halak plays anything close to the way he did in the last 3 games I like the Montreal`s chances.
461125,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-29 03:17:00,0,"expect pittsburgh to be a much tougher opponent.  they actually play defense and despite his stats this year, fleury is an A-1 goaltender.  should be a good series to watch, especially as a hockey fan with no cares as to who wins."
461131,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-29 03:30:00,4399, Well if Fleury plays this series the way he did in the Ottawa series then Montreal has darn good chance!!

Now that Ovechkin is watching hockey instead of playing it, i can now go back to rooting for the Habs to fail miserably"

460295,Lunatic,2010-04-27 05:52:00,536,if thats what it takes for montreal to win (halak standing on his head every game) then i feel bad for him. taking a pounding every night just to end up on the golf course because of the oompa-loompas playing in front of him.
460301,darsky,2010-04-27 07:36:00,586,  Sorry Dude but I was at game 5 and there was no booing going on during the anthem.And I watched on tv last nite-same-no booing. Take that somewhere else.
