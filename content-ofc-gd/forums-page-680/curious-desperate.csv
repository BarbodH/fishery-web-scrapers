469041,Bly,2010-05-24 13:03:00,1556,"I have the time, the vehicle, the gear and the boat but due to medical reasons, I am unable to drive right now....curious if there is anyone in the area that might be interested in getting out today.  I have no preference as to where or what, would just really like to get out and fish.  Thanks!   PS Please excuse if I have posted this in the wrong section..couldn't seem to locate the old ""hook up"" section...might just be me getting old.  forgot to mention I am in the Oshawa/Whitby area"
469079,ChrisK,2010-05-24 17:16:00,2772, Shame I didin't live any closer to ya Bly or we would be out fishin right now. Hope you hook up with somebody
469084,Bly,2010-05-24 17:54:00,1556,Thanks Chris...perhaps another time you can make fun of my hook sets lol
469090,ChrisK,2010-05-24 18:14:00,2772,"Oh ya,your hookset...How could I have forgotten   Hey if your going to Lakair this June you can show me your new and improved version."
469101,Bly,2010-05-24 19:06:00,1556," If all goes according to plan, I will be at Lakair and look forward to showing you the improved version....the one that landed this at last years event  "
469104,splashhopper,2010-05-24 19:33:00,2931,Dang Bly... i live in London too. .. sorry
469106,Bly,2010-05-24 19:35:00,1556," No need to apologize, I should have planned better, wasn't sure if I would have the time today.  Hope you are doing well"
469113,camillj,2010-05-24 20:33:00,1988,"Hey Bly, hope you are ok soon ... Unfortunately I too was serving the greater good today .. but I did get about an hour watching a big 'ol smally guarding his nest just a few feet off our dock early this morning ... almost as good as fishin   Then we got a glimpse of a big-arse bear running off ahead of us as we drove out toward the main road ... right where we had been walking just yesterday evening !"
469115,Bly,2010-05-24 20:43:00,1556,"Being near the water, watching fish....ahhh heaven!   Good thing you were there the day AFTER the bear.  The entire time I have lived in Canada (10years) I have only seen one wild bear..a cub and I was in a car.  I am ok with this  lol   Still would like to see a wild Moose from a safe distance someday.  Thank you for the well wishes!"
469117,camillj,2010-05-24 20:53:00,1988,"I know ... despite being an outdoorsy type,  I have only seen a few over the years .. funnily enough I saw three (Momma and two cubs) on Hamer Bay road as I was driving in to Rocky Crest on Friday night so thats 4 bears in three days ... a record for me ... and enough to really make you think about those early morning/late evening walks in Muskoka !"
469179,ChrisK,2010-05-24 23:16:00,2772,Now thats the only way to learn how to set a hook...
469254,HTHM,2010-05-25 01:04:00,4082,"Too late now, but just give me a call and I will be happy to drive you nuts or fishing.... I will PM you my info."
