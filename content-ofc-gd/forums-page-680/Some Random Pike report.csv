469246,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-25 00:52:00,709,Hit 2 of my FAv. pike lakes this week end.   twas a verry slow week end with the sun and the + 25 OC and the no wind and whatever.   for some unknown reason the pike were bitting light and had trouble setting the hook.    they were more fallowers than hitters.   but still maneged a couple that were nice enough for me to share!   my good OL pal sly with his first pike of the year.    Then it was my turn.  this one hit a M/G on the slow troll.    must have been somehting like a 8 lbs pike .    this was saturday.  promised my bro that i would bring him fishing monday.  so i did.  he won the biggest pike contest.  with this nice 6 lbs pike. estimating!    He was verry happy and out smarted me.  the pike had fallowed his lure in but didnt hit.  he threw a back cast while i was doing the rounds of the lake.  the pike came back!    it was lots of FUN IN DA SUN!
