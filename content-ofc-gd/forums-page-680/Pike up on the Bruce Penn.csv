469715,Banger68,2010-05-26 01:30:00,157,Went up to the cottage for the long weekend and decided to sneak out Sat evening to get a couple pike. Boy ... were they on! Me and my two nephews caught 17 pike in 4 hours with couple dozen follow ups. They weren't the biggest (largest was 6-7 lbs) but it was a fun evening.  Most were caught on bright coloured x-raps. They would hit on the pause in the retrieve every time.  Sorry .. no pics. I forgot the camera ... probably why the fishing was so good.
