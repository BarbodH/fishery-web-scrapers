469453,Terry,2010-05-25 15:22:00,14456,"55 to 85 ft of water  if you are not marking good numbers of fish, it's hard to get them to bite  keep moving till you find them"
469455,BillM,2010-05-25 15:26:00,17367,Follow the pack of russian dudes in 10ft dingies...  Shouldn't be to hard to spot
469475,marrex_mike,2010-05-25 16:14:00,40,Thanks guys I'll give it a go n see what happens..
469587,cityfisher,2010-05-25 19:20:00,959,follow the groups and jiggg away!! just a matter of time before a big boy bends your rod...
469634,Sinker,2010-05-25 21:20:00,8692,"Jig lightly. When you see the armada of boats out there ripping thier williams........don't do what they're doing. Most of their fish are snagged.  Just a light jig, hit bottom on every drop, and lift it about 8"" each lift.....nice and slow.  S."
469638,Cudz,2010-05-25 21:47:00,2652,"I tried everything on Monday.  Marked loads and could get them off bottom but they just won't commit.  After trying to coax the same fish, or same couple of fish for 20 mins I just gave up.  They come off the bottom and look at it but don't actually bite it.  I tried every jigging technique known to man. On a side note I managed a nice 6.5 pound laker using the ice fishing method and my vexilar. Love that machine."
469652,BillM,2010-05-25 22:18:00,17367,"  A buddy and I were out last year in a good 3ft chop and we saw at least 4-5 guys in small dingies..  We were a good 2 miles from shore, lol...  What people do for a whitefish!"
