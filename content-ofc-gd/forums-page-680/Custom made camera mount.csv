I had a Ram Mount from an old hand held GPS, so I had my Dads neighbour(a retired machinist) make this up for me.  First I had a permanent base made for the Ram mount with a threaded hole in the centre.   Next I had post made that threads on to the base on the other end is threaded too fit the camera      Here is the whole thing with the camera on it    Now I will be able too sit in the same spot on my back casting deck and have everything centred up in the frame. I've been playing with zoom settings so I'll know when I'm Bassin' or Musky fishing how far to zoom in to get the best shot with the whole fish in.  I'll post some pics when I'm out next time  Rob"
