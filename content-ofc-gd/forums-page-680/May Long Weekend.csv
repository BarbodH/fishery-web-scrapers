469124,danbouck,2010-05-24 21:29:00,4380,"Well as planned we headed down to the cottage in Long Point for the weekend. It was the best May 24 weekend weather that I have ever seen even with it raining most of the day Saturday.  I went out for a few hours every morning looking for some pike. It was the first time in my life that I was getting mad because there were bass EVERWHERE.  Every time I tried a spot I would catch bass after bass, so I would move and try somewhere else and end up catching more bass. I ended up cruising around a lot because of it but that was still fun.  At one point I was bringing in a fish, looked into the water and saw a nice pike. I was all excited until I realized that I had another bass on my line, not the pike and saw this thing start attacking my bass at the side of the boat. It was insane  This is how the bay was every day    This is how I tried to spend the rest of the days      This is the calmest that I have ever seen Erie in my entire life. It was like this all weekend.      The were a TON of dead smelt on the beach this year. It was like this all down the beach (this is the only way fish are ever in my reports   )    Sunday my wife and I managed to head over to Pottahawk for a cruise. Ended up anchoring and jumping in for a swim. It actually wasn't that bad, well after a few minutes it wasn't that bad.        The pergola got done but the only pic I have is when we started it. It turned out pretty good    The last night we decided to have a fire, roast marshmallows and watch the fireworks on the beach. I got the oldest to start digging.      This is a shot from the last night    I wish I could have got a pike this weekend but it is what it is. We had a great weekend.  Hope everyone had a good one,  Dan"
