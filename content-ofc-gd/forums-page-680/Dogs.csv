469186,Pigeontroller,2010-05-24 23:32:00,2793,"I've been thinking its time for a dog in my house after not having one for some years...Anyone know anyone that breeds dogs? Or has puppies. I have always been a German Shepherd lover as the family dog was one when I was small...She was a great Dog. Anyway, just thinking about it right now, but summers coming and the kids will be home so it might be the right time..."
469189,HTHM,2010-05-24 23:38:00,4082,"Go to the pound, they have some great dogs there, and it will be cheaper than buying from a breeder"
469192,danada,2010-05-24 23:42:00,31,"theres a farm outside brantford selling german sheppards with german bloodlines, no idea the price but if you want i can get the number for you. dan."
469196,dnb_cbr,2010-05-24 23:48:00,61,"If you are partial to GSDs then i highly recommend looking into Shiloh Shepherds.  They are very similar in appearance to GSD but they are on average about 10-25% larger, with milder temperaments, and they are not quite as prone to hip problems.  We have a small kennel with 3 dogs, however there  are no litters in the near future.  If you are interested i can help you get in touch with a few breeders, hopefully in your area.  "
469203,Jewelbee,2010-05-24 23:55:00,422,Maybe consider a rescue site or the pound..lots of wonderful dogs looking for people!
469307,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-25 02:17:00,10439,"Lots of Shepherds looking for a good home. I saved a nice one from the shelter back in the 80's. Now my latest pup is also a rescue dog. Check out petfinder.com for a list of shelter pups in your area. I did a search for Toronto and area and came up with 7,124 Shepherds looking for new owners.

469399,Banger68,2010-05-25 13:06:00,157,I have been working with Collie Rescue for several years now. There are alot of good dogs out there that need saving.  http://collierescuenetwork.com/  There are similar organizations for other breeds.
469401,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-25 13:11:00,932,"My girlfriend and I go to our local humane society on a weekly basis.  They really do good things there and lots of good, friendly people work there.  You can find a great Sheppard (or Collie, or Husky, or Lab,or Rotty etc) with no problems at any animal rescue shelter I am sure.  They have full vaccinations, are spayed or neutered, and you generally can get all of their history.  It is a great place to start."
