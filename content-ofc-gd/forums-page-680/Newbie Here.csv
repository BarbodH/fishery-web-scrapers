468307,Dan K,2010-05-21 03:07:00,3,Long time lurker first time poster I mostly fish for MUSKIES up in the kawartha's and also in the upper niagra river and once in a while up in the north bay area. I look forward to sharing my reports and of course pictures. I just purchased a new house to me which is a bit of a fixer upper so unfortunately I won't be able to make it out as much as I would like the other unfortunate thing is during the packing I have misplaced the phone # to my boat storage place his name is John and his storage space is across from a trailer hitch place on Grimsby mountain rd if anyone has his number that would be great. p.s. this site is great
468377,Toddyc20,2010-05-21 12:38:00,141,Welcome.  I look forward to hearing about your Muskie outings.  I do a bit of muskie fishing also but this year I'll be going for only big bass as of june 26th.
468412,Roy,2010-05-21 13:50:00,13728,Welcome aboard! Call Hitchman Trailer Supply 287 Mountain Rd at 905-945-9335 and ask who stores boats across the road. I see it on street view but don't see a name.  Good luck.
