468958,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-24 01:15:00,3761,It was pointed out to me on another forum that the small Pike I caught this afternoon seems to have stripes on it's side. Do you think it's other generations may of been a cross with a musky or do some pike have pattern like this guy?    Thought it looked cool anyway haha
468960,Joey,2010-05-24 01:31:00,9122,Just a young pike.  Joey

468984,bigugli,2010-05-24 02:27:00,6138,"Lot of young pike have that barred look. However compare colour patterns of the fins, and get a count of the cheek pores to be certain."
468989,Rizzo,2010-05-24 02:36:00,4754,I thought I had read somewhere that pike don't get markings on their tail...I'd google it if it weren't for this dang dial up.
468994,BillM,2010-05-24 03:09:00,17367,"young pike = stripes, mature = spots..."
468999,Syn,2010-05-24 03:43:00,519," ha I learned something else new today. I thought pike and muskie pattern just got more spaced with age. Apparently not.  Read this part on another fishing forum where people were debating the same thing as we are:  ""Just a color variation of small pike where the vermiculations on the back extend down the sides, they grow out of it pretty quickly, and the lines turn into seperate spots. ""  "
469002,Ben_Daniels,2010-05-24 04:34:00,435,It's either a chain pickerel or an Atlantic  -Ben
469005,MJL,2010-05-24 04:46:00,2427, It's a tiger splike = Tiger musky + splake  Love the markings on that fish.  WTG Mike.

469014,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-24 10:23:00,3761,"Lmao, you guys are hilarious. I'm sure its a normal pike but hey it looked cool"
469058,Tom McCutcheon,2010-05-24 14:13:00,627,"Nice looking fish Mike.  From the pointed tips on the paired fins it looks like a small muskie. If you get a chance, next time, count the pores under the bottom jaw. A pike will have 4 or 5 down each side of the jaw and a muskie will have 7 to 9.  Tom."
