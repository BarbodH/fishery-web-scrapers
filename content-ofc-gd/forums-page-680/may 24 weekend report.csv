469225,splashhopper,2010-05-25 00:23:00,2931,nice report walleye man.  That sand bar is shocking to hear that it is usually 12 feet under water... where did all the water go?
469314,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-25 02:27:00,0,Great report. At least you know were the pickerel are and you can go back and get them.
469614,walleye_man,2010-05-25 20:32:00,135,also i forgot to mention on our way up to one of out spots we saw a huge fish in the water floating dead so we decide to go see what it was turns out it was a 18 pound pike we put it on the scale to get it out of the water looked like it was dead for about a day sad to see such a big fish dead like that anyone have any idea of how it might of died?
469646,Cudz,2010-05-25 22:05:00,2652,Probably choked on an orange.  That is usually how they die. You know how it is.  You are out there fishing and then you get bored so you throw an orange in the water.  It floats around for a while than a big pike hits it on the surface.  The pike tries to swallow it and gets it caught in its throat. Eventually it is unable to get oxygen and dies.
