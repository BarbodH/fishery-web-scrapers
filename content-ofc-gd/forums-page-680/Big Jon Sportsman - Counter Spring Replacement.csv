468773,bluesky1713,2010-05-23 00:59:00,107,Just wondering if anyone knows how to put on a new counter spring on a Big Jon Sportsman downrigger.  Mine snapped recently and I ordered a new one and want to put it on myself.  I know I have too take off the reel assembly but there is a metal pin that is stopping it from coming off.  Anyone know how the right way to put a new counter spring on?  Thanks in advance!  Josh

468874,bluesky1713,2010-05-23 16:59:00,107,Still struggling with getting that pin out.  I have it push into the hole but aren't able to get it much further.  There isn't much space to work with a hammer or anything to give it any force...
