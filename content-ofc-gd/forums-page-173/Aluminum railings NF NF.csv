As far as I'm concerned it's the best one out there and as a neighbour found out after getting other systems quoted... it's cheaper in $$'s as well.  Anyone with some ability and a trim saw can put it together in short order. Posts in place and measure the distance between.... measure three times, cut once on the aluminum. Regular wood cutting blade in the miter saw works perfect on aluminum.. without any damage.   Just take your deck measurements to a dealer and the computer lays out the order sheet. "

But it's very simple to do yourself if your going into a normal wooden deck and as mentioned just be sure of your measurements before you do any cutting and your done in a couple days.      Stain the deck, add in a couple canopies and some wicker furniture and your all set for a summer of laying back enjoying life  "
