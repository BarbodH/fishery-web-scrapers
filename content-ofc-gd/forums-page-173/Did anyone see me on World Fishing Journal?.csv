918067,mepps,2015-06-01 20:18:00,1301,"Hey guys and gals! I had the chance to do a short interview with the World Fishing Network a little while back to discuss my website and the combination of social media and fishing. Did anyone happen to catch it? I'm a little ashamed to admit, but I don't have WFN (or any cable for that matter) so I didn't get to see it live. I've included a link below for anyone who is interested. I got just over 1 minute of airtime after about an hour of filming. It starts about 50 seconds in and ends around the 2 minute mark.  http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/shows/world-fishing-journal/videos?vid=58355  and yes, they spelled my name wrong"
918082,Whopper,2015-06-01 21:20:00,2174,How do you misspell Clive :-)
918115,Joey,2015-06-01 23:29:00,9122,"Hahaha, Paul and I saw you.  It came on TV this weekend and I said to Paul ""Boy, that guy looks alot like Clive"" and he said ""That's because it is Clive.""  Good Stuff Bud, Congrats!!!"

918211,mepps,2015-06-02 14:17:00,1301,"Lol Whopper!  Thanks guys! I wish some of the other stuff  sad made the cut, but it was a little off topic. Maybe next time!"
918219,Gerritt,2015-06-02 14:53:00,6129,Clive that's so cool man! Keep up the good work!  G
918220,Mike Pike,2015-06-02 14:59:00,1332,"Too cool!  I saw it a few days ago, but I never put two and two together and realized that was you.  Nice Clive!  Good job on your site.  And even better work on the little one( lol )!  Congratulations!"
