Then as were were trying to pick a path between two ahead of us, the boat on the left had rods firing faster than they could bring them in. As we entered the battlefield, we got a triple header. With smiles and ""at lasts: we did a 180 and got 3 more.  I dont believe I have ever ended up with as many different species in the boat in one day on the great lakes. And just in time for the fish fry,             now, what's the weather like tomorrow? "

918803,lew,2015-06-06 11:47:00,12766,I think it's great the way you & G spend so much time fishing together and I always enjoy reading your tales.  This one was definitely no exception.
918805,dave524,2015-06-06 12:18:00,4508,"Nice going, I'm only seeing 4 species, some walleyes, perch, few silver bass and a salmonoide that looks like a coho by the tail, what am I missing ??"
918806,Pickeral eater,2015-06-06 13:08:00,155,Great report! Sounds like a great day with your son. Nice feed as well
918837,misfish,2015-06-06 19:27:00,29133,Had an offer friday to head to windsor for a fish. Turned it down. What was I thinking.  Nice time spent with G bud.

Thanks Lew - that's very kind of you, and I'm glad you enjoy our slimey times updates. I'm trying very hard to write a different book than the one I lived. G makes it easy.  Nice going, I'm only seeing 4 species, some walleyes, perch, few silver bass and a salmonoide that looks like a coho by the tail, what am I missing ?? Dave, Pikeslayer is either amazingly observant, has fished Lake Erie a lot and guessed, or his reason is right    A couple of white perch in the mix. Hard to tell the difference, especially in these pics, but 2 of them are WP.. And good eye on the coho, 10 points for ID skills there.  Great report! Sounds like a great day with your son. Nice feed as well Thanks PE - I'm not much for the silvers and white perch myself, but G loves them sauteed in butter then thrown on a bun for breakfast. Around our house, that will last a couple days, between us and a few neighbours who usually stop by to ""admire"" the days catch"
