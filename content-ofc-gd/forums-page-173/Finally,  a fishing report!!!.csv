The son and I decided to ignore all the bad omens and drove out to Windsor anyway. We arrive to high winds, heavy rain, and dropping temps. None of that mattered. The silver bass were biting. We toughed it out for all of 2 hours of non stop action.  After that we were wet enough , and tired enough, to admit the weather had gotten the better  of us.  I can just imagine what the bite would have been like with more moderate weather.,"
