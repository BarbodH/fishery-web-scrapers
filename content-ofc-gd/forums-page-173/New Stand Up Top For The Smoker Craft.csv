918532,neilr22,2015-06-04 17:07:00,1,Great looking top. Was hoping to get something similar made up for my Ultima 172.  Does the top lay flat on the floor when put away or rest on top of the flip up seats at the back?

Does the top lay flat on the floor when put away or rest on top of the flip up seats at the back?  Well the whole back just zips right off. The front part with the framework usually stays in place. If you don't want it up you just snap the cover off, stow it away and the frame folds down along the sides of the boat."
918554,LeXXington,2015-06-04 21:04:00,1928,I love the top. Great work.
918579,solopaddler,2015-06-05 00:34:00,8605,"I love the top. Great work. 3 year old thread, but thanks LOL!"
669655,solopaddler,2012-02-24 21:38:00,8605,"The new top for the Smoker Craft was finished today. We had Eagle Marine Canvas in Burlington do the work and I couldn't be happier with it.  It was marginally more expensive than the standard metal frames from China that most companies use but not much. 100% custom frame fitted to the precise height I requested. Sunbrella canvas top, and a whole slew of impressive little details that are evident up close.  I can highly recommend these guys for the quality craftsmanship and fast work (although this is their off season).        "
669656,livinisfishin,2012-02-24 21:41:00,661,That looks pretty sharp!
669658,misfish,2012-02-24 21:46:00,29133,"Mike,looks great.  Question. That back window. is it a screen with removeable window? If not,that would of been my choice."
669659,mercman,2012-02-24 21:46:00,7054,Thats one hot ride ya got there Mike !!! Anyone would be proud to own that baby!! Congrats  Paul  
669663,adempsey,2012-02-24 21:57:00,1498,"Hmmm, I dunno.  I think I need to inspect it closer and field test it on the water.   Feel free call me to set up an appointment."
669666,lew,2012-02-24 21:59:00,12766,Very nice indeed Mike !!  Your gonna love that top on those cold rainy days on the water.
669671,solopaddler,2012-02-24 22:03:00,8605," Actually it does zip out Brian, as do the side windows as well. There's also full canvas sides that zip in and out too.  Honestly though the back part of the cover will almost never be used anyway. It'll probably only stay on when the boat is moored."
669672,IFCFY,2012-02-24 22:04:00,21,it's a beauty!
669675,misfish,2012-02-24 22:13:00,29133,Sweet. Thats how I did my bayliner. Air flow.
669694,pikehunters,2012-02-24 23:20:00,40,"Not sure if I could stand inside I'm __' just bring it down & we'll find out, bay & lake have open waters!!!  Looks Good enjoy"
669737,HTHM,2012-02-25 02:26:00,4082,"Let's test it on Erie tomorrow, see if I can stand up in it..."

669834,esoxansteel,2012-02-25 16:02:00,1307,"Great looking top Mike, nothin like been comfortable in incliment weather."
669835,BillM,2012-02-25 16:10:00,17367,Awesome Mike!  Frank has a guy who's a canvas maker doing one up for the Lund as well.  Can't beat foul weather fishing in comfort!

669894,workwear,2012-02-25 21:30:00,592,looks great.....   was wondering what would something like that cost....
669954,aplumma,2012-02-26 02:25:00,6896,Nice setup Mike it should be fine no matter what the weather is.   Art
669956,moparhawk,2012-02-26 02:36:00,146,Very nice Solo. Did you ever condider finding or ordering one from the factory?
670020,solopaddler,2012-02-26 13:09:00,8605,"Thanks lads, she's definitely looking good. Best part is my wife is now a lot more interested in the 7 hour drive to the cottage.     Well sure I did. But the quality isn't even close, as mentioned the frames are all made in China.  For approximately $200 more I got a full custom top."
670042,BillM,2012-02-26 14:39:00,17367,"Mike, making the wife happy means more fishing time!     Can't wait to try out that bad boy this year!"
670043,Dan668,2012-02-26 14:40:00,1120,"I'd prefer custom, not impressed with my Lund cockpit cover.def going custom for the stand up top"
670318,bigbuck,2012-02-27 14:08:00,2449,"They do good work there, they fixed up my seat cushions 2 years ago and I'm happy with their work. They can be a bit more expensive but their work is superior and is worth it."
670363,johnnyb,2012-02-27 17:26:00,3413,"Super slick there, Solo...can't wait to see the first report"
