917874,solopaddler,2015-05-31 18:07:00,8605,Somewhere on the net there used to be a blog chronicling one groups trips to that camp over the years. If you could find it I'm you'd find it helpful. Good luck on your trip!
917884,Musky or Specks,2015-05-31 19:02:00,2710,Here you go a free online map with marked portages and campsites for the entire Temagami area http://www.thetemagamimap.com/ I also highly recommend the Friends of Temagami Map http://www.friendsoftemagami.org/. Diamond lake is readily accessable by portage or snowmobile in the winter.

Good luck on your trip! That's funny.  I was just going through all my bookmarks to try and find that blog.  I thought it was interesting, especially since it's an ""old school Netscape era"" website.   Couldn't find it though."
917921,chris.brock,2015-05-31 22:01:00,4053,I (and likely some others too) would love to hear about your past trips to Diamond. Pictures are cool too.
