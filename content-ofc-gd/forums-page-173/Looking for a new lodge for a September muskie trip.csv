Just to do something different, we are looking at a different location this year, and we are looking at some alternatives other than the French. We would prefer American Plan, but are not opposed to housekeeping. WE are looking at going the second to third week of September....that rules out some lodges.  So....give me your recommendations.

918310,Roy,2015-06-03 01:26:00,13728,Have a talk with the fine folks at Mashkinonge Lodge (Regan or Goldie). I'm sure they won't lead you astray.
918314,Musky or Specks,2015-06-03 01:47:00,2710,You should check out some of the places on Restoule. Three different Lakes kinda like the French but easier to learn and most importantly big fish.
