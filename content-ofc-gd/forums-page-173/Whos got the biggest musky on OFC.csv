Me too   56"" as well  These 3 had me crying!  Back to back... Awesome.  Joey you little devil you!   As for the muskie, Sneak_e_pete I missed that post.  Often away or quite busy with work that time of year.  Your fish is wicked bud, sorry to have missed it then, but I'll tell ya now.   With guys like Pete Maina & Marc Thorpe on the membership here, I'd say one of them would run away with the OFC muskie crown here easy.  For me, I do cherish a 56"" from 2013.  Real special fish, up there in the top 5 for sure.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=71662"
918315,LostAnotherOne,2015-06-03 01:47:00,956,One thing I learned is when you catch a big fish take several pics of it in different poses.  The one where it looks the biggest makes the cut haha
918329,tender52,2015-06-03 03:09:00,270,"The biggest no. However for you really hard core guys...I have the "" Canadian record "" officially from Ralph.. Wish master big baits.. A 31 inch on a 24 inch Wishmaster. From what I hear, a gentleman from Pennsylvania holds the "" world record "" 30 inch on the same 24 inch Jailbird. Ralph's been gone for some time now and took his craft with him. Lets raise a glass. Cheers Colin  "

918349,jimmer,2015-06-03 14:45:00,2730,"I have been fishing for them for so long and the largest was a 48""er out of Pigeon Lake, so it didn't have much weight to it either. I have seen some over 50"" while fishing but never lucky enough to hook up with one. I love the stories of the first time muskie anglers boating one over 50"" on their first trip. Argh!"
