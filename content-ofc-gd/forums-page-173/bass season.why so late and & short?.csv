But lets be honest, that would never happen although I wish it would.   Don't put me on that list..Its too much now as far as i'm concerned"
918410,Stoty,2015-06-03 21:54:00,2910,"Opening them all year would have very minimal effect oj their population, at least in most areas of Ontario where essentially no one fished for them. Walleye, our most coveted fish, are only closed for 6 weeks in most zones yet they shut down bass for 6 freakin months. What a joke!  AMEN!!! Couldn't agree more! Should be open all year round. Populations are more than healthy, and like stated, not many people ""target"" them for the table."
918420,huzzsaba,2015-06-03 22:04:00,884,"Why is it that people don't take them for the table?  I have never tried bass, but is it because they don't taste good?  I also read something about people don't keep them out of respect since their growth is slow and supposedly a 14-15 incher is suppose to be over 10 years old?!?"
918467,Freshtrax,2015-06-04 02:02:00,2215,Worms down south.   I will eat a smalllies out of a cold lake or river.
918472,Joeytier,2015-06-04 02:26:00,3990,"Smallies are good eating fish.  A step below walleye or perch, but I definitely like to take home a few smallies whenever I get them."
918479,manitoubass2,2015-06-04 03:06:00,11391,"I dont eat smallie here unless deep hooked.  Too shallow around here. Flesh is soft.  Taste isnt bad on most at the right time of year.  In warm waters and shallow they not only have soft flesh but they taste like mud.  Kinda weird cause around here those fish are feeding on crawfish(delicious), youd think they would taste awesome"
918480,crappieperchhunter,2015-06-04 03:36:00,2582,Smallies out of colder water are great table fare. A good feed my brother and I caught in May one year on a walleye trip that went badly...in an area with a full year open bass season..is still rated by BOTH of us as one of the best fish fries we have ever shared.  I have never been able to understand why they are closed for as long as they are in most areas
918500,MrSimon,2015-06-04 12:18:00,217,"At Happy Day Lodge the owner encouraged us to release the walleye and eat the bass ... since the bass are ridiculously abundant in that lake and walleye is far and away the more sought after fish by guests.  I thought that made sense so we ate some.  They were delicious!  Fried up in a fish taco you couldn't tell the difference between bass and walleye.  The bass were harder to clean though ... tougher skin and seemed like harder bones than a walleye.  If I had to clean bass on a regular basis, I'd use an electric knife."
918523,misfish,2015-06-04 16:19:00,29133,"I am happy with the Lake Simcoe season. It,s plenty long enough. IMO   Just throwing this out there, but, Simcoe is becoming a small mouth big fish factory. IMO, if there was to be an open all year season, there should be a slot for keeping. The smallies here are very healthy. Probly due to the deep waters they are close by too. No warm water smallies to get worm infested.  Go ahead and hate. LOL  This year, there is going to be a late spawn again, just like last year. The water is still very cold. Heck, the shinners are still hanging out in the marina here."
918538,MrSimon,2015-06-04 17:50:00,217,"I couldn't agree more!!!!  I should get a bumper sticker that says ""slot limits and lower creel limits save lives""   IMO, if there was to be an open all year season, there should be a slot for keeping."

In warm waters and shallow they not only have soft flesh but they taste like mud.  Kinda weird cause around here those fish are feeding on crawfish(delicious), youd think they would taste awesome  I believe the reason for the muddy taste is because the flesh deteriorates quickly due to enzymes the fish release from being stressed, if you leave them alive on a stringer. When I am KEEPING cool water bass for a meal, I bleed them like a rainbow to kill them immediately and they are pretty good eating... I know more than once they have meant the difference being having a fish fry during a trip or not, when the other species go close mouthed (usually happens in direct proportion to the expense of the trip LOL)... I never, go after them more than once or twice for eating a year, and haven't bothered for a couple years now.  As for the seasons, it wouldn't take long for them to be decimated if it was left open in SWO... The bucket brigades would see to it...  As for being a blast, it is tons of fun rigging up a live leech under a float and drift for smallies in your favourite trib after the season starts."
918056,huzzsaba,2015-06-01 19:52:00,884,"Why does bass season start so late even though they are plentiful? Or maybe they aren't?   Is it because they spawn later than other species?  Clearly a lot are being caught because they are biting but cant be kept due to being OOS.  I'm asking because I stopped going to my usual fishing place because that is all that is there for the last month or so.  There may be other species there like bows, but the bass is all that is biting."
918066,AKRISONER,2015-06-01 20:10:00,5558,"its a protection thing. Bass are absolutely veracious during spawn. They will basically be caught by anything that moves therefore in order to protect them while they are vulnerable, they close the season.  Of course people constantly catch them, and its well known that bass are being caught a lot inadvertently, however it does protect them from bass fisherman specifically targeting them and putting pressure on the fish at a vulnerable time."
918069,Joeytier,2015-06-01 20:27:00,3990,Good question.  It baffles my mind that they aren't open in the winter and spring during the pre-spawn time (especially in zone 11 where they should be open all year!)
918111,Paudash,2015-06-01 23:13:00,273,caught 3 or 4 this weekend while trolling for lakers on a rock ledge  15 feet down in 20 feet of water sometimes you can not avoid them
918113,Moosebunk,2015-06-01 23:16:00,3970,"Closing bass for ice season is kinda ridiculous dontchyas think?  Being that ""ALL"" fish under the ice are prone to certain winter habits which can be predicted, fish of many kinds will be caught and some will be kept. Protecting a more plentiful fish such as bass while most other species (some less plentiful) remain open just goes to show how bass ackwards we have it in our thinking.  What makes them so special anyways? lol  Smallies do rock tho!"
918121,manitoubass2,2015-06-02 00:00:00,11391,"The season here got changed last year, bummed me right out.  The population is INSANE!!! And nobody keeps them so why change the regs? Heck, barely anyone even fishes them on rainy river except for a tourny.  Ah well"
918122,John Bacon,2015-06-02 00:00:00,3277,"Not only are bass late spawners, but they guard their nest until well after the eggs hatch.  For most fish, once the eggs are laid the spawn is done.  However, bass will stay and guard the eggs and even guard the fry after they have hatched.  That explains the late opening.  I am not sure why it is closed for winter.  They don't seem to bite much through the ice so it probably wouldn't make affect the population too much if they allowed ice fishing."
918124,Joeytier,2015-06-02 00:07:00,3990,"Opening them all year would have very minimal effect oj their population, at least in most areas of Ontario where essentially no one fished for them.

918126,Pigeontroller,2015-06-02 00:36:00,2793,"New York State doesn't seem to think they need protecting!    I'd say they're right, as the Great Lakes are full of them!"
918127,jtracc,2015-06-02 01:01:00,97,"It's a tough topic, on one hand they are plentiful, but is that because of our strict regs??? On the other hand having a wider season with bass fishing options will defiantly bring in revenue.  I would love to have a catch no keep season from March till June, then closed for the month. However, we will need more enforcement which means more government spending. I would play $25-30 for a pre bass opener option with the money going toward enforcement. But that's just me thinking."
918129,SuperDave,2015-06-02 01:14:00,204,"Well as Pigeontroller just revealed, if you WANT to fish for them. buy a $50 NY license and you will have a blast! We've been fishing for them since April. However, as soon as they set up their nesting areas we stop. The pre-spawn bite can be spectacular!"
918142,OhioFisherman,2015-06-02 02:18:00,6623,"I am old, I remember the days before catch and release and closed seasons, there were a lot less of them around, getting too liberal with the seasons and limits could return that.  Kind of like walleye fishing here, commercial netters battled with the sport fisher men for decades, they claimed not to be taking enough walleye out of Lake Erie to hurt the walleye population, but I never caught a walleye on Lake Erie until a few years after the walleye netting ban here."
918155,chris.brock,2015-06-02 04:14:00,4053," In the winter they do stack up pretty good in certain spots and big fish are vulnerable. Near my fish hut, if you stray to far, it's smallies in a small, defined area. They don't release well through the ice either, their swim bladder is often bulging out of their mouth."
918173,Acountdeleted,2015-06-02 11:10:00,2562,They are open year round in the Thunder Bay Area. I reccomend a trip up there.
918183,Dara,2015-06-02 12:20:00,3052,"Open all year here too.  I think its the government wanting to control.  Here where we don't care or bother with them, its open, down south where you want to fish them, its closed...thankyou Kathleen   PS, I caught a couple nice 4-5 pounders this weekend while fishing for walleyes"
918184,BillM,2015-06-02 12:21:00,17367,"5 months is a short season?   If you aren't fishing bass late into the fall, you're missing out on the best action of the entire season."
918194,Gallie,2015-06-02 13:15:00,1215,"Bills right on there, im not a big bass guy but smashing 4+ lb smallies in october is still a good time in my book."
918200,LostAnotherOne,2015-06-02 13:30:00,956,I don't really mind that bass season isn't year round.  I fish several different species a year at different times.  It just drives me crazy when I see people fishing for bass purposely near the river by my house.
918209,John Bacon,2015-06-02 14:11:00,3277,"New York State doesn't seem to think they need protecting!    I'd say they're right, as the Great Lakes are full of them!   Actually, in the main body of Lake Ontario they don't spawn until after the season opens anyway.  The MNR had some information sessions on this a couple of years back.  I wouldn't be surprised if the the other great lakes were similar."
918214,MrSimon,2015-06-02 14:35:00,217,"Every body of water is different and responds differently to a closed season.  For example, the lake I fish in NY has a closed season (no C&R) until mid June.  However, the bass population is still steadily declining due to over-harvest in the summer and fall.  This particular lake would be way better off with C&R until June and then lower creel limits and slot limits the rest of the year.  But lots of lakes in Ontario with a closed season don't have an over-harvest issue, and have excellent bass fishing .... so something must be working."
918217,jimmer,2015-06-02 14:45:00,2730,Unfortunately I believe there are some that would definitely abuse the opportunity if they were open pre-spawn and it would definitely have a negative impact on the populations in smaller lakes.

It is certainly strange that a shared body of water (Canada/US) that in some places is a few hundred yards wide has vastly different seasons. Different by almost 7 months. There are two rules of thumb on the Canadian side: 1) any bass fishing before the 3rd Saturday in June will ruin the population, and 2) if you want a better shot at placing in an Erie bass tourney, get your butt to the US side. That's irony."
