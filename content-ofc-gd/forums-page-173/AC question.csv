In terms of brands, every company preaches their own brand whether it be carrier, train, Bryant etc.. But every brand has horrible reviews on consumer reports etc. I know you have to take reviews with a grain of salt but if I'm dropping that kind of money i would like to buy a decent air conditioner. Right now im looking at a Carrier comfort 16 2.5 ton. Anyone have any experience with this unit?"

After doing lots of research, and having more than one quote, I learned the installation becomes the most important part of your AC, once you have passed on Lennox.  Lennox will cost you 2x to 2.5x the amount of a Carrier, York, or Rheem.  I just purchased a 2 ton York. Cost me $2,500 installed.  http://www.cosmopolitanmechanical.com/  These guys did my install at the best price. BOONSTRA was the most expensive, and provided the lowest quality system with their highest price.  Hope this helps a bit at least."
