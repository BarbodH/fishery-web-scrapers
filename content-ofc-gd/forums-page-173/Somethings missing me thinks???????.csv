918728,Gallie,2015-06-05 20:35:00,1215,"No numbers,thats a fun ticket..."
918729,Terry,2015-06-05 20:38:00,14456,not a cheap boat  maybe he could not afford numbers
918730,Spiel,2015-06-05 20:38:00,9065,Perhaps a local marine dealer water testing it. I don't think registration numbers can be issued until it's purchased.
918731,craigdritchie,2015-06-05 20:38:00,1586,"If it's the numbers you're referring to, then I wonder if someone was doing a photo shoot on the lake. If the manufacturer (or even a dealer) is doing photos for a catalogue or website, the boats never have numbers on them. You need to have the paperwork with you, and there's usually a manufacturer's number mounted on a board that you would normally place up on the dash. It's sort of like the boat equivalent of having a temporary permit in lieu of a license plate.  This is definitely the time of year for it. Most manufacturers are doing their 2016 brochure photography right now."

918733,misfish,2015-06-05 20:42:00,29133,"One boat was loaded with fishing rods. Father son from what I could tell.  As for the stanley, it came in, loaded up with fuel (like said) and left. No shoot going on here."

Besides the stanley, the others were just pleasure boaters."
918741,DRIFTER_016,2015-06-05 21:07:00,10439,Up here they don't care whether your boat is registered or not. Tons of boats with no numbers here. Don't need one of those silly boaters cards either.  And drinking while boating is encouraged not frowned upon!!!!

918743,DRIFTER_016,2015-06-05 21:16:00,10439," Thanks for the chuckle Dave.  It's all true, well except for maybe the boozing and boating part."
918749,Terry,2015-06-05 22:08:00,14456,lets all guess  maybe he's a drug runner
918757,John Bacon,2015-06-05 22:48:00,3277,"If I remember correctly, as long as you have applied for a license you can use the boat.  I am pretty sure I had to wait for my license numbers for the Alumacraft that I bought in 1994.  It would make sense that there would be a few people still waiting for numbers for new boats that they purchased this spring."
918770,spincast,2015-06-06 00:55:00,3279,oh. I was gonna say downriggers and rod holders ?

I thought you were given a number and you went and bought the numbers and just put them on.   Yes Rick, that too. LOL"
918820,John Bacon,2015-06-06 15:42:00,3277,"  I thought you were given a number and you went and bought the numbers and just put them on.   Yes, that is pretty much how it works.  But, you don't get the numbers on the same day that you apply for them."
