Okiie dokie  Your comparison of a OOS fish and a fish that's still legal to angle for but out of the slot is what I found funny.  As for my opinion about a kid taking a pic with a OOS fish vs a grown adult?    The smile on the kid would be worth it"

915961,jimmer,2015-05-20 17:16:00,2730,"All I can say is that the problem lies with the anglers that have no idea about handling fish. Example: Fish flopping around on the bottom of the boat in a net, so a picture can be taken with everyone in the boat. It's a stupid rule and I rarely use that word. This rule will not stop the above example from happening."
915978,kickingfrog,2015-05-20 18:31:00,8333,"Officer's discretion is what it is. Try the ""Well the other CO said he'd never give me a ticket for this"" it might work.  Many drivers speed 10kph over and don't get a speeding ticket, doesn't mean it's not illegal. ""Hey, buddy the last cop let me off, and surely you're not a big enough fool to give me one are you?""  Slot fish need to be measured to determine if they are in/out.  Just this weekend my son caught one of the bigger smallmouths I've seen the last few years, 5-6lbs. It was at least 3 times bigger any bass he's caught. He had no issues with it going back in the water right away. He did want me to remember the spot so we could come back when the season opened.   ""Ok, one more your eye's were closed. Oh crap, I cropped the tail out. Wait, did the flash go off? Shoot, the fish's eyes were closed."

Catch a big bass and look for your camera, snap a few pics, drift 30-40 yards away....take the extra 10-20 seconds needed to help revive the fish...put it back and it likely has to look around for its nest for a few minutes, they finally get back to the nest and half the eggs have been eaten by bluegill...."

917979,Dave Bailey,2015-06-01 04:23:00,1641,"If this 'no picture' rule is as strictly enforced as some claim, then I recently posted a video on this board of me doing something illegal, and I would do it again. The reason? Simple: Last year at Killarney PP I had an incidental catch of a lake trout, which are off limits in George Lake. But I know that the park wants information on lake trout in order to assess the status of the population. So instead of releasing it immediately I measured it, and held it up to my video camera to prove what it was. If I had a scale it would have been weighed as well. When I showed the park warden he wasn't in any mood to ticket me, instead he was almost ready to kiss me. He wanted that information! By the way, the trout in question was last seen swimming back toward the bottom of the lake, in apparently fine condition.  The 'zero tolerance' mentality is incompatible with justice, because true justice depends on discretion."

915453,kickingfrog,2015-05-16 21:23:00,8333,"Could get you a ticket specifically for doing so in NY state.   http://www.syracuse.com/outdoors/index.ssf/2015/05/new_law_photographing_fish_caught_out_of_season_a_ticketable_offense.html  Due to the increasing trend of fishermen catching ""out-of-season"" fish and posting pictures of their catches on Facebook and other social media, the state Department of Environmental Conservation has put a new fishing regulation in effect that makes the practice a ""ticketable offense."" The new regulation, which took effect April 1, is listed in the new DEC fishing guide that one gets when he or she buys a fishing license. It's listed on page 52 under the ""General Take and Possession"" heading. According to the fishing guide: ""A person may not fish for a species (even if immediately released) during the closed season for that species on a given water. Fish caught during the closed season must be unhooked and released immediately. They may not be handled for any other purpose, including taking a picture."" Taking a picture of an out-of-season fish can result in a ticket from an environmental conservation officer. The resulting penalty can be a fine of up to $250 fine, and/or 15 days in jail. ""It's a ticketable offense. It's all because of the social media thing and people posing with the fish for pictures. They often spend too much time dilly- dallying and don't return the fish immediately to the water,"" according to Lori Severino, a DEC spokeswoman. ""This was designed to protect the fish species."" Bottom line: one can't take an out-of-season fish out of the water for any reason other than to take the hook out and release it. The penalty for holding that fish up quickly or leisurely (it doesn't matter) for a picture is no longer allowed. Situations where new law would apply include: *Catching and photographing an out-of-season bass on the St. Lawrence River or on a Lake Ontario tributary in Jefferson County, where unlike the most of the state there is no off-season catch and release fishing allowed outside of the regular bass fishing season. *Photographing an out-of season walleye caught on Oneida Lake or elsewhere. *Catching and photographing an angler holding up a sturgeon he or she ""accidentally"" landed. (Sturgeon are endangered species and there is no open season in this state to fish for them.) And needless to say, Severino added, ""intentionally angling for threatened or endangered fish, or for fish during the closed season for that species"" is also prohibited. In situations where ""catch and release"" angling is allowed (such as for bass during the off-season in most parts of the state, or for trout in a stream designated as a no-kill waterway), the DEC fishing regulations state: ""Measuring, weighing and photographing the fish are permitted as long as the fish is not removed from the water for an extended period or handled in a manner that could cause harm. Fish may not be held on a string, or placed in a bucket, tub, livewell, or any other holding device."""
915455,Rizzo,2015-05-16 21:30:00,4754,"I always thought it was an offense here too....isn't the wording something like ""fish must be returned to the water as soon as possible""? If that is what it says, then a photo is a no no here as well"

But this no-pic thing takes it too far in my opinion.  If I catch a nice chunky bass while pike fishing, I have no problem holding it for an extra 2 seconds while my buddy snaps a pic.  It doesn't hurt the fish at all and we love having nice pictures from our trip.  I understand It's breaking the rules and I could be fined .... but enough is enough.  The rules on the lake I fish allow for anglers to sit at a river mouth a week after the walleye spawn and catch big fat females all day long - with no size restrictions and a generous creel limit.  Facebook is filled with pics of dead 10 pounders every Spring.  It's really hurting the walleye population in the lake and a few simple rule changes could make a HUGE difference.  But, photographing a bass and releasing it unharmed before June 15th comes with a $250 fine.  Seems backwards to me."
