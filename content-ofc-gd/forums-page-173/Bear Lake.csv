917965,jtracc,2015-06-01 01:58:00,97,Hey guys looking for any info on Bear Lake off the hwy 518. Wondering if there is a place to launch a boat or put a small tin in.  Any info would be appreciated.  Thx all  Joe

917969,jtracc,2015-06-01 02:29:00,97,Family has a cottage in the area and every season I like to try a few new lakes.  I have found a few nice ones over the years.
917970,Joey,2015-06-01 02:48:00,9122,"Used to go there all the time to Lighthouse Campground and Cottages.  Fishing is decent, pike, pickerel, bass.  The shoreline is shallow though.  We had the Tracker back then and usually had to get in waist deep to get the boat in and out on and off the trailer.  There is also a launch right off of 518, but it's almost the same, shallow and hard to launch, but I found it worth it.  Great little lake and had many a good time fishing/camping/renting a cabin there.  Good luck."
