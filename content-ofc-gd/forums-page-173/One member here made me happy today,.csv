918057,misfish,2015-06-01 19:53:00,29133,"Once again the thoughtfulness of a member here, has helpped me find something I have been looking for.  I will not say whom it is as I dont want him to be over whelmed with pm,s .LOL If he feels obligated to help others, then all be it for him to say whom he is.  I have a nice freshly mint made VHS ( yes, VHS, and I still have a super 4 head player to watch it) of some great Red Fisher Shows.  I know it will get played over and over on those non fishing days.  I thank you SIR for your generousity and kindness. Good karma coming your way.  B"
918059,Gerritt,2015-06-01 19:57:00,6129,VHS? I'm sure 1/4 of our membership have no idea what forgiven language your talking B...  You know your old when........  G
918061,Roy,2015-06-01 20:02:00,13728,Well I just read the first two posts and I have NO idea what either of you are saying.
918062,Fisherman,2015-06-01 20:05:00,7201,I've still got one with with a bunch of Going Fishing with Daryl back from the '90's.
918064,misfish,2015-06-01 20:06:00,29133,DOH  How about BETA? LOL
918071,davey buoy,2015-06-01 20:33:00,5505,Now you've really lost us Brian lol.
918079,Gerritt,2015-06-01 21:05:00,6129,It sticks me as odd that beta was superior to VHS but because beta was owned by Sony it never flew..... Remember the old top loaders?  Ohhh man I am feeling older then my years

918081,SirCranksalot,2015-06-01 21:20:00,3291,You can have my 8 track if you'd like!!
918085,misfish,2015-06-01 21:26:00,29133,"You can have my 8 track if you'd like!!  Naw. I remember banging my leg off the last one I had in the 69 dodge..  I,ll bet though, I could get some tracks from the Barrie auto flie market if I wanted."
918090,misfish,2015-06-01 21:38:00,29133,"So to keep it to the original,,,,,,,,,,  It was a real nice offering from the member.  Thanks to him again."
918092,Terry,2015-06-01 21:46:00,14456,very cool  I was googling red and could not find any old red fisher stuff you will enjoy watching them
918097,solopaddler,2015-06-01 22:35:00,8605,I used to love Red when I was a kid. If I could I'd buy a copy of every  show. Boggles my mind that someone in his family hasn't taken control and offered the shows to the public. I bet they'd make some money.  Good score Brian. If that one breaks I think I have 4 of them sitting in my basement LOL!
918100,Moosebunk,2015-06-01 22:47:00,3970,Beverly Hills Cop and Porky's Movie Night at Brians.  Wooo VHS Hooo!!!

Ohhh man I am feeling older then my years  It failed not because it was owned by Sony but rather that Sony would not license another company to use it except for one. VHS on the other hand, licensed anyone who wanted to use it."

Ohhh man I am feeling older then my years Yup, had an SL5000 Betamax, a refurbed rental.  The pain was to tune the individual stations on its own tuner.  When that went out of style the VHS took over.  I don't bother recording anymore, if it's not on this week, there's a re run coming soon to a channel near you.."
