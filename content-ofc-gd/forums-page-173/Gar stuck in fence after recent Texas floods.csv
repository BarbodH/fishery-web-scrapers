917882,davey buoy,2015-05-31 18:55:00,5505,I don't see it either lol.No picture?.
917883,Toronto_Angler,2015-05-31 18:57:00,698,Lol sorry corrected now
917894,misfish,2015-05-31 20:03:00,29133,"Just to add to the pic, some comments.  http://imgur.com/gallery/Vb0eclK    LOL  As someone who regularly fishes in Corpus Christi, this makes me happy. Stupid gar stealing countless bait..."
917896,davey buoy,2015-05-31 20:10:00,5505,Something foul about that one on the left lol..Man that water was sure high.
917914,Roy,2015-05-31 21:33:00,13728,This now proves to us that gar can't read.
917950,Moosebunk,2015-06-01 00:46:00,3970,"Gar can't see forward too well at all... and they can't reverse well either.  If you're stealthy, you could net gar off the bow of your boat if you approach them quiet and head on.  They were no match for that fence they were being pushed into, that's for sure."
917961,LostAnotherOne,2015-06-01 01:25:00,956,Any one of those would be a PB for me
917971,Joey,2015-06-01 02:53:00,9122,"Cool pic.  Dumb Gar  Kind of like when you were a kid and stuck your head through the stair railings and could not get it back out.  C'mon, you know you all did it"
