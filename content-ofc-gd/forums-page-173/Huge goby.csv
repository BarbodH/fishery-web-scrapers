The jig is 1"", so you be the judge. Might even be longer then 6""-7 "". How big can these things get?  "

Male round gobies are larger than females. ""  It's been 10 years or so since I fished, but never saw one that big, is that from Simcoe? Looks like a decent meal for a walleye or steelhead."

Yes Paul, Simcoe.  It,s the Barrie Marina. You can see many of them in the smaller size every where.  I was very surprised at it,s size and fattness."
918700,OhioFisherman,2015-06-05 18:05:00,6623,"All the ones I saw on Lake Erie seemed to be between 3-5 inches long, but I am sure there had to be bigger ones around Brian. I have no clue, does Simcoe have access to the great lakes for fish to migrate? Or were those from carelessness with a bait bucket?"
918702,misfish,2015-06-05 18:11:00,29133,"You can head from lake O and get to simcoe doing the trent system. If Im not mistaken, it,s do to the bait bucket brigade and also from boats transfering unwashed. Im not 100% on this, but have also heard they have been here longer then we know, just that we are seeing more and more of them now. I know on Erie they are stupid crazy. Probly why they brought out the plastic goby baits to use there, and why slammers work so well on Simcoe for bass on a drop shot rig.LOL"
