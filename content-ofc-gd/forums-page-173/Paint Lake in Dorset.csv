I'm renting a cabin on Paint Lake with a few friends in a couple of weeks for a few days and I can't find a whole lot of information on this particular lake via the oracle.  Can anybody fill me in on what species of fish this body of water holds?  I've heard bass and pike.  Are there any lake trout present?  Thanks in advance.

We generally focus on the small, shallow bay on the east end of the lake...decent size LM and hammer-handle Pike.   The main lake has Smallies and larger Pike but we generally don't bother with it...better SM fishing in Lake of Bays itself."
