917499,Freshtrax,2015-05-29 04:07:00,2215,I would like to volunteer some time this year to do some fin clipping or anything else you guys need please keep us updated for opportunities to volunteer.
917510,chessy,2015-05-29 13:59:00,610,"They dont fin clip anymore... in my opinion the reason for this is because people catch naturally reproduce salmon, which proves the hatchery fish dont make it and is a wast of money"
917516,spinnerbaitking,2015-05-29 15:17:00,1622,"The Lake Huron Fishing Club & Ontario Steelheader & this year a Grade 11 environmental class  fin clipped every Rainbow Trout that comes out of the Kincardine Trout Hatchery & they have been clipped for year maybe always, if you don't think that program is working you don't know anything about the work the LHFC & Ontario Steelheaders are doing. The sorting & counting is done in January & Fin Clipping is done early February usually & I'm so busy with the School Program I'm not getting out fishing  or on the fishing Forums as much as I need too lol but will try to keep you informed a little more. We are always looking for new members & every $5.00 puts about 15 Trout into Lake Huron water shed, Pay Pal set up here & all members get the news letter with all events in it. They will be picking through the Rainbow eggs until they hatch picking out the dead ones, moving the Fry to bigger tanks & moving the Browns to the biggest tank over the summer but I don't have dates yet, they just counted all the Browns & spread them into 6 tanks of 10,000 from 2 tanks of 30,000, if your in the area stop by you could get a tour.

Waste of money? I dont think so and I also seen where they were clipping the fins.  Great job Richard, and look forward to the next school project.  Like I have said before, if there was one here closer, I would be all over it."
