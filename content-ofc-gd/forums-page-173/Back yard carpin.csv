917791,Freshtrax,2015-05-31 02:53:00,2215,"Nice fishin ,  watch the pink shirts around here. Some members think it makes you less manly."
917803,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-31 05:02:00,8243,That's not pink it's Salmon. That looks like fun and yes nice set up not far from the fridge and the vittles. The big Carp are spawning here and last night it was so dead calm we could here the splashing about with big ones making little ones. Talk about kinky if you know what I mean? This is a Family site.

917873,misfish,2015-05-31 18:02:00,29133,"Nice fishin , watch the pink shirts around here. Some members think it makes you less manly.    When golfing, any color can be worn. LMAO  Nice little place there."

917998,bigugli,2015-06-01 14:17:00,6138,"  Who cares what colour shirt you wear as long as you are catching fish.  Besides, seeing as Keswick is part of the extended Toronto suburbia, pink is just urban camouflage."
917999,highdrifter,2015-06-01 14:26:00,2534,That's not pink it's Salmon.  HAHAH!!  So true..  Nice fishin mane!
918020,Gallie,2015-06-01 16:22:00,1215,"Great, now ive been lumped in with toronto and have to look for a new place ?"
918044,bigugli,2015-06-01 18:54:00,6138,"  Sorry man, but it's non stop subdivision from Steeles to the south shores of Lady Simcoe. It's called urban sprawl."
918105,Gallie,2015-06-01 22:58:00,1215,"I know, i run a concrete pump im part of the problem. I wish my wife was a little more open to moving farther away"
