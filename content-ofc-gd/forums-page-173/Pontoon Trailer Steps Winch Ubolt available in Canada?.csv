918024,Raycaster,2015-06-01 16:48:00,528,I feel like a teenager decking out his first Honda Civic but after climbing up the front of my pontoon trailer to load and unload I keep seeing those beautiful new pontoon trailers with the steps built in to the front winch assembly with the blocker pads.  Wondering about the cost and availability  (Hamilton area) of picking up one.  Yes I could have one done for me but if the price isn't too bad then I might be obliged to open the wallet instead.  Any pointers to site or shops would be appreciated.  Of course if someone has blueprints I might just fire up the welder too...
