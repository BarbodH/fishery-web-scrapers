918078,Roy,2015-06-01 21:01:00,13728,My town was rated the best place to live in Canada. I'm sure that there's lots to be done to improve but I'm still glad that we're working on it.  http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/06/01/best-places-to-live-canada-moneysense_n_7486788.html?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067
