918585,irishfield,2015-06-05 01:36:00,26272,"As have I...  but I keep the tires covered when the boat trailer is outside all summer in the marina storage yard. Mine are now 8 years old and are as new.  That said, the enclosed trailer I get to use for 1/2 the year (winter) had marathons on it and they didn't make it 4 years before the sidewalls all cracked around the perimeter. Probably stored out in direct sunlight while the sister-in-law had it on Manitoulin, but I don't know for certain where they had it stored, other than I know it was left on the grass as they rusted the rear ramp door hinges off the frame."
918608,lew,2015-06-05 09:22:00,12766,"I'm on my 2nd boat trailer with Marathons and so far ....touch wood....they've been great tires with no issues. Their made in China now and according to some websites I read it seems like a lot of guys have problems with them. I keep mine at 50 PSI, check them before every trip and don't tow above 65 MPH.  Hopefully I haven't jinxed myself now LOL  Other trailers I've had used Carlisle tires and I never had a problem with any of them either.  I've read alot about folks being very happy with Maxxis trailer tires but have no personal experience  I always jack my trailers up and put them on blocks for winter storage just to give the tires & springs a ""rest"" but have no idea if that actually helps or not but to me anyways it seems like a good idea."
918612,Garnet,2015-06-05 10:09:00,2056,"My last boat trailer had 400,000k on it. Goodyear Marathons came on the trailer about 50,000k, I won 2 sets of marathons and got 50,000k out of each.  My buddy at Muti Tire in Scarborough put a set of off brand tires on he had good luck with roofing trailers. They looked just like Goodyears put I got 180,000k from them.  Took the Marathons off my new to me boat trailer and put the off brand on, about 25,000k on these and looking good.  Give Jmac a call."
918614,bigbuck,2015-06-05 10:39:00,2449,"According to my tire guys who have never steered me wrong, most tires out there nowadays are pretty good to excellent, Chinese off brands are nothing to fear. They have more Michelins come back with problems than the off brands and they sell more off brands. As for trailer tires, Goodyear, Carlisle, Hercules, Kumho all make good rubber. Do not drive too fast, keep them properly inflated and shade them from the sun whenever you can and they will last years."
