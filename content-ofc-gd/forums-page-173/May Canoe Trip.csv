918144,Tim Mills,2015-06-02 02:26:00,476,I went on a 3 day canoe camping trip a week ago in the Parry Sound area with my friend Keith.  We base camped at one site.  Friday was sunny but cool.  It went down to -2 Friday night but it warmed up Saturday and the fishing improved. We got 10 fish on Saturday.  The cool temps kept the bugs away and we had the lake to ourselves.  It was a good first trip of the year. ourselves.      The pike and salmon seem to like this Blue Fox Spoon.   Keith with brunch   Firewood Run   Cajun Pike and a side of pig.
