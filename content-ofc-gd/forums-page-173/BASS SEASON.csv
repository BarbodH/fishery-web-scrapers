IS THERE A BETTER TIME OF THE YEAR TO USE THEM ? WARMER , COLDER?  JUST LOOKING TO SEE WHENS THE BEST TIME TO USE THEM .  THANKS "
918567,Stoty,2015-06-04 22:33:00,2910,"Senkos are an ""anytime"" of the year type bait. They can work in all conditions. Water temps will be in the 70s by opener, so they'll work right off the bat."
918569,jameshandz,2015-06-04 23:01:00,31,thats what i thought . anything above 70 should be ideal
918571,Stoty,2015-06-04 23:25:00,2910,They also work very well in cooler water periods too when the fish are finicky and lethargic. Post front conditions as well.
918607,fishindevil,2015-06-05 08:32:00,6254,Yup I start fishing senko rigs both wacky & Texas rigged right away when season opens pretty much .... Can't ever go wrong with properly presented wacky rigged senko !!!!! ??
918644,EC1,2015-06-05 13:57:00,930,"I'd probably go for the more fun baits to start the year - Frogs, horizontal baits, and save the senkos for when you can't seem to get them to bite"
