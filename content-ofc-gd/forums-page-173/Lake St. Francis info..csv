Her sister has a canoe we can use and apparently there is a marina within a few kms from the house.  Other than ice fishing and one trip on Lake Ontario last year, my girlfriend hasn't done much fishing, so I will be showing her the ropes.  Does anyone know what is opened yet, ( I don't think I am taking my muskie gear, but you never know), licensing requirements, etc. Any help will be great."

918323,PikeMolester,2015-06-03 02:09:00,428,walleye and pike are open
918375,Lape0019,2015-06-03 19:18:00,647,Don't forget perch! Its one of the only places around there where perch has a closed period. pay attention to the wind and stay close to shore if you are going in a canoe. Wind and water conditions can change on a dime.
