No big walleye just numbers.  4 or so hours and we caught who knows how many walleye and a good number of pike.  Had a pike boil on shore then fished for another hour or two.  This lake is deadly good. Im guessing we caught maybe 70 or so walleye, 15 pike and a few good bass.  I love this lake.  So at the end of the day my dad says he has an early bday present for me. Kinda caught me off guard and I was thinking something silly.  He pulls out a custom made fillet knife with me initials on it. Pull my man card cause I just about cried lol.  Gorgeous knife and perfect timing.  My first time using a double edged blade and I instantly fell in love!  Amazing day?    "

918623,manitoubass2,2015-06-05 11:22:00,11391,"Thanks guys!  The blade sure made quick work of our limits?  Its nice heavy knife too, very high quality.  Walleye fishimg this lake is sooo fun! Only problem is almost every walleye is the same size lol.  Just before it rained I had a good laugh with my dad too. Hes got his jig just above the surface while grabbing a sandwich and his line goes peeling off.  Reels her in and its a nice walleye. Came up in 14fow and grabbed his jig hahahaha.  Cant wait for our annual camping trip coming up in july?"

918784,Moosebunk,2015-06-06 01:50:00,3970,Yes... a 70 walleye a day lake ain't too hard to take.  Great time with Pops and a meal could only be the outcome of that.
918792,manitoubass2,2015-06-06 02:34:00,11391,"I hear ya bunk. Youll have to come fish this way some day.  On the backlakes numbers are INSANE!!!!  if we fished hard and a lil longer, no doubt we could double that.  Ya really cant do anything wrong lol.  But its time with my pops, so we shoot the sh.... eat sandwiches etc. Plus he just bought a new truck being deliverd next week so we talked about that alot lol.  I love these lakes!"
