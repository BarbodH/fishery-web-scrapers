922708,scugpg,2015-07-01 13:42:00,1373,I want to find a vented deck plate that would sit flush on the floor of the boat but be a screw in type. I see a few out there that sit up 1-3 inches but looking for more of a flush mount or very low profile. Anyone seen something like this available? Otherwise I guess i could modify a flat plate by drilling some holes and using aluminum mesh underneath etc.  Thanks
