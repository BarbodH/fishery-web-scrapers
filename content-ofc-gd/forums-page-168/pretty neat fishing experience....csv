Very nice man.  We sat and chatted and hes landing walleye after walleye on a pickeral rig. He says ""thanks"" to each fish then released them.  Over an hour he musta done this 20 times, all good eaters too, 14"" clones give or take.  I told him im mainly catch and release as well, and he says ""well then son, you're on our side"".  I told him I do like a good fish fry once in awhile and he says me too son.  I couldn't help but notice his rod and reel, brand nen shimano rod and a stradic reel. I found that odd. This guy is pushing 90. ""What ya using for line""? I asked.  ""Fluoro son, always flouro""  Then he says ""you from Canada""?  ""No, born in the states but lived in Canada my whole life"".  ""Well you sure have a beautiful country son. I moved here from England in 1956, got my citizenship in 63. Best decision I ever made""  Curiously I asked why? Well people like you son, and of course the fish""!  He packed up so I helped him load his gear.  He backs up and runs over my sons bike!hahahhaha  He gets out, pulls out a wallet and apologizing over and over.  ""Its okay sir, put away your wallet. He put his bike in your way, no worries.""  My son came and apologized.  And all he said was ""see ya soon son""  I thought that was a pretty cool experience"

922930,ckewley,2015-07-02 20:04:00,699,"Very cool, I'm by no means a young guy anymore(not old either) but I find the old timers really enjoy talking to younger folks when we are courteous, met a few codgers too (I'll fall into this group when I reach their age)!"
922946,limeyangler,2015-07-02 21:39:00,5204,Cool people these Englishmen
922950,davey buoy,2015-07-02 22:10:00,5505,"We don't Really know what we have,unless you lived elsewhere and came here after like this gentleman.I almost hear this weekly from people who came here since 1987.Just reading the paper daily we should be proud,never mind the tax gouging!  ."
922958,esoxansteel,2015-07-02 23:41:00,1307,"The type of fella you spend lots of time and never be bored, a true gentlemans gentleman, and you and you son obviously touched a warm spot with the gentlemen as well,"
922961,manitoubass2,2015-07-02 23:50:00,11391, Funny thing he looked like a board member here just older.  I dont wanna mention who just in case he takes offense to the age thing lol
922963,wkrp,2015-07-03 00:19:00,656,"Good Karma, I wish there was more of that."
922972,Walleye72,2015-07-03 02:22:00,156,"Oh My God, that ending was priceless.  Cool story."
922976,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-03 02:47:00,8243,Nice story.
922978,manitoubass2,2015-07-03 02:57:00,11391,He said hes been down there 5-6 times. Im hoping to do some fishing with him.  And chatting...  The bike is fine btw. Just broke off a reflector and bent the handlebars abit
922983,manitoubass2,2015-07-03 04:13:00,11391,So sorry it didnt involve destroyed BBQs ????  Speaking of which did you get a new one yet?  I gotta wait like a week and its kinda like slow painfull death
922984,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-03 04:31:00,10439,I still remember a camping trip to Algonquin with my friend and his family when I was a young lad. Met a neat old fella that was up from Ohio and he was camping/fishing and trapping snapping turtles. He showed me what he was doing and told me they were very good eating.  Interesting the people you meet during your life that leave an impression. This fella was a judge back in the states.  That was 40 some odd years ago.
922988,manitoubass2,2015-07-03 04:50:00,11391,"No doudt drifter!  Im looking forward to seeing him again and fishing together.  Great guy as I said, but I bet he sure has some stories to tell!  And im pretty sure he was late 80's or early 90's, but sharp as a tack. Looked in great health!  Well maybe not his eyesight lol."
922996,mr blizzard,2015-07-03 11:41:00,1589,"Nice storey Rick, certain people you cross paths with unexpectedly in life can certainly leave a lasting impression, that is what someone told me years ago is the ""SPICE"" in life, not to take away  from the cooking thread lol"
