We did a 20km paddle, to a set of falls.  Sam caught a hammer handle pike in the first section of river, and while she was bringing it in, a massive 40+ pike grabbed on to it!  We go so excited, that I ended up set a hook past the barb in to middle of my thumb!!  And I was so excited, that I just ripped it out, and grabbed the net.  But the big pike let go, and all we ended up boating, was the dink hammer handle!  Ah well, still a good story.  Caught a couple bass on the way home.  I lost 4 boat side, and Sam lost 1 landed 2.  SO my rookie fisherman girlfriend has out fished me the last 2 times we've been out!!!! what the hell Man!!  Here's some random shots from the day.  The weather was great, and the company couldn't have been better!!  I used the pano function on my cell phone for the first time yesterday.                        Thanks for reading!!  More to come, this summer is just getting started!!!!"

923207,NAW,2015-07-04 18:09:00,4022,"Im teaching her how to fish.  And to paddle, and she's really catching on quickly.  She gets the first few casts at all the nice looking fishy spots.  I enjoy how happy catching a fish makes her!   And the more fish she catches, the more addicted she is becoming!!"
