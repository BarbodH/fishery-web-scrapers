Caught a few bullheads as dusk rolled in. The biggest was about 30"". I've always struggled catching carp, and usually spend a few days fishing and baiting an area just to catch a single carp. It was a friggin' blast tonight!   In and around the 30"" mark, biggest of the evening.  The girth of it's head  A canoeing couple paddled up and started to take their canoe out just as I hooked into one, and they offered to take a picture. "

922460,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-30 04:08:00,8243,This site needs a like button. I give you a like.  I hope you picked up the drink cup and can thrown on the grass. Why did they end up on the grass in the first place? I'm taking back the like.
922469,mike rousseau,2015-06-30 09:25:00,4661,Nice catch  Haven't been out for carp in a few weeks...  Your giving me the itch...
922470,Locnar,2015-06-30 10:33:00,645,"Old ironmaker, at spot was disgustingly littered. I usually take away garbage, but I couldn't come close to removing even a quarter of the trash."
922658,Rod Caster,2015-07-01 03:45:00,5784,I can see why you'd snap off... not easy bringing in a big fish in that spot.
922660,Moosebunk,2015-07-01 03:59:00,3970,An under-rated fish that provides one heckuva tug on the line.  Nice catching dood!
922680,The Urban Fisherman,2015-07-01 10:51:00,2050,"An under-rated fish that provides one heckuva tug on the line.  Nice catching dood!  Absolutely!  If I had to pick one species of fish to target the rest of my life in Ontario waters, it could very likely be carp.  Pure muscle. Thanks for the report dude - can't wait to get out after some of them myself."

922843,Locnar,2015-07-02 01:51:00,645,I grammar good english.
922846,Consigliere,2015-07-02 02:35:00,121,Oh the joy of this forum.
922860,Acountdeleted,2015-07-02 12:19:00,2562,Do you guys use the 'sweet corn' (aka rubbery plastic) that Sail sells on your hair rigs or just pure corn? I'm thinking I am going to take that garbage off and maybe get me a few carp in the process. Though it does hold the hair rig on really well.
922861,Fisherpete,2015-07-02 13:01:00,1814,Use real corn Jer with one of the rubber ones to help it float off the bottom and keep it on the hook
922883,highdrifter,2015-07-02 16:47:00,2534,yyyyyuuucchhh.
922968,mike rousseau,2015-07-03 01:37:00,4661,I almost always have a piece of rubber corn on to visually top off my baits...  I've had success with yellow pink and white
922969,Acountdeleted,2015-07-03 01:48:00,2562,Thanks guys. The green fake corn has done me no good. Course I might just be really bad at this.
923002,PUMP KNOWS,2015-07-03 12:38:00,937,"Yup, use a fake floating corn with real corn so it stays off the weedy bottom"
