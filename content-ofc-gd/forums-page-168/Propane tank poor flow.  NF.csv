923549,captpierre,2015-07-06 22:06:00,2521,Have a propane tank about 1/3 full ( comparing to full and empty ones side by side). Get poor heat from all the burners. Put a full one in the BBQ  and she gets real hot like supposed to What gives?  Bad tank?  Fairly new. Same as others.
923553,Fisherpete,2015-07-06 22:21:00,1814,Maybe check them on a scale? It always seems like there is still propane in mine when it gives out...
923564,IndySKS,2015-07-06 23:06:00,134,With the new regulators they use you must have no gas flow through the burners (control knobs turned off) before opening the tank. If your burners are open and you turn the tank on the regulator goes into a minimal flow mode. This causes a lot less heat/ flame from the burners. Try that method and see if it helps.
923565,leaf4,2015-07-06 23:10:00,2466,"Had this happen to me a couple weeks back with a full tank, I detached it, took off the grills and the heat shields and gave all of the burners a quick scrub and a knock put everything back on and good as new"
923573,SBCregal,2015-07-06 23:36:00,688,"I had the same problem and it was exactly what IndySKS was saying.  It would sometimes keep working if I opened the tank really slowly.  I replaced the tank after a summer of frustration and have never had the problem since.  I think maybe that like anything else, the valves can fail and trip when they aren't supposed to limiting the flow of gas through the regulator."
923584,G.mech,2015-07-07 00:13:00,830,"It is likely the excess flow reg tripping things out, these things can be a little fussy.  Here is a link to a great summary of how they work and what to do when they dont:  https://www.cuisinartbbqs.com/en/regulator_flow_limiting_device.php"
923678,captpierre,2015-07-07 14:36:00,2521,Thanks a ton G.mech  Did exactly what the link you sent said.  Working perfectly.  I had no idea propane tank regulators work this way.  Thanks again. Learned something new. Peter
