922521,pics,2015-06-30 17:21:00,1268,Cheap steel in the brushes nowadays.. a dozen people a year in Hamilton have issues with the bristles .. I use the stainless pad sold at canadian tire and since I have a Napoleon with real stainless grills I have no problem...
922524,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-30 18:09:00,8243,"Thinking about what was reported I have never seen a BBQ brush with 1"" long bristles. Maybe Hamilton (my hometown) has problems with cheap BBQ brushes because you can't swing a cat without hitting a dollar store. I'm still won't use one, haven't since I was told it will damage the grill surface. I'm not really Chicken Little, my Health and Safety background is probably showing."
922849,niagarasteelheader,2015-07-02 03:34:00,12,"I always bring the BBQ up to temp, hit it with the stainless brush, then wipe the grates with a doubled up paper towel. Scorch the paper towel but have never found a bristle in anything I've cooked. Not sure if it's norm/over kill but it works for me"
922873,John Bacon,2015-07-02 15:14:00,3277,"I have never seen a BBQ brush with 1"" long bristles.  Perhaps if you include the portion that is embedded in the head of the brush it would be an inch long."
922889,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-02 17:30:00,8243,"Yes John, probably right, ouch."
922949,misfish,2015-07-02 21:49:00,29133,"I was taught how to burn off a grill from my pop and it has always worked.  Once you are done bbqing what ever,  lay a layer of heavy tin foil over the entire grill ( not that cheap dollar store stuff BTW) and let the trapped heat bake off what ever mess there is. Once the grill/ mess has turned white, remove the foil and wipe with a scouring pad when cooled, not bush, the grill. It has worked for many many years for me. Never a problem.  EDIT TO ADD  Do this to the bottom of the grill as well. Flip the grills over and repeat said after your grill or before your next."
923061,Jimmy_1,2015-07-03 17:03:00,13,This is why I really don't like using a grill. They get awful dirty and  greasy!  I use a smoker/charcoal grill for everything. Easy to clean and with foil there is no real mess when smoking a pork shoulder or ribs. In fact the BEST steak you will ever have is a flank steak cooked right on the coals.
923062,Steve,2015-07-03 17:09:00,2075,people really clean their grills?  wow.  learn something new every day.
923067,Jimmy_1,2015-07-03 17:42:00,13,"If a grill isn't cleaned periodically the grease build up will cause burners to clog and uneven heat distribution.  The grill will also flame up in areas where the are build ups of grease. Thus causing food to burn.  A secret I learned a long time ago about grilling is to use very low heat and cook longer.  Less propane is used, meat retains juices, cooks even and doesn't burn.  Also, best thing when grilling sausages is to boil them 1st to remove excess fat. The fat will wreak havoc on the grill.  Happy grilling!"
922398,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-29 22:22:00,8243,"I just watched a report on CHCH Hamilton. A young woman was eating at friends this weekend and felt a stabbing pain in her mouth. The pain continued every time she moved her tongue. Long story short she had to have a 1"" long piece of BBQ brush wire removed from her tongue surgically in the hospital. They also reported on an incident where a wire from one of these brushes perforated a mans intestines that required major surgery and could have been fatal. They also said if this young woman had have left this as is she most likely would have had to have a portion of her tongue removed. Scary stuff.  Not only these things are obviously hazardous they are bad for your BBQ grates as they will take the non stick material off and only makes cleaning tougher. Porcelain I think. I tried the soft material that comes on some brushes but it basically melted the first time I used it. I guess that type is used when the grates are cold. The thing didn't come with the instructions I wouldn't read anyway. An onion cut in half works. I will use a soft cloth held by tongues wet with veggie oil to clean the grates and it prevents sticking too.  Throw that steel bristle brush out , now."
922400,manitoubass2,2015-06-29 22:27:00,11391,"Maybe I have some stuck in my brain, that would explain alot????  Ive always used a steel brush with a heated grill to clean.  Sounds horrible I guess Ill look at other options  Thanks for the heads up?"
922401,Burtess,2015-06-29 22:29:00,901,I use a stainless steel welders brush to clean my Broil King stainless steel grates.  If you don't use a metal brush you can't get all the crud off.  You have to visually inspect both the grates and the brush for loose wires before you cook.  As long as you pay attention you shouldn't have a problem.  For those that don't this is a good wake up call....  Burt
922402,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-29 22:47:00,8243,"There isn't really anything on a grate that will harm you. edit, except a wire. Any bacteria I think should be killed at 500F. Please if that's not true correct me. That crud actually stops sticking, to me it just doesn't look clean. Every once and a while I give the grates a good splash of Spray 9 and wash with the power washer. Another excuse to fire up the power washer, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I used to use a welders brush too. I think you need some good eyes to detect a thin wire. I don't think it's worth the risk is all. I would feel terrible if one of the little one choked on a wire. Not worth the risk in my opinion."
922403,Freshtrax,2015-06-29 22:51:00,2215,Walking down the street is dangerous too.   I will continue to brush my bbq and walk down the street. Can't be scared of everything
922406,Roy,2015-06-29 22:58:00,13728,Slow news day for Hamilton. Maybe some people shouldn't be using BBQs. I think the government should start a wire brush registry.

922418,FloatnFly,2015-06-29 23:28:00,1640,"That 'crud' is where all your unique flavours are developed.  I had a customer come in at the end of last summer, and pick up 2 bottles of diana sauce, I question them on it since they NEVER buy sauce, and they said they just got a new bbq and they were dumping the sauce on the hot grill to build the flavour profile"
922422,kickingfrog,2015-06-29 23:35:00,8333,I'll stick to not eating the bristles.
922425,Moosebunk,2015-06-29 23:41:00,3970,That 'crud' is where all your unique flavours are developed.  That's what I was thinking too. lol
922430,ketchenany,2015-06-30 00:05:00,3229,"having cleaned BBQs for the last 40 years, I do use them, I use a cloth to wipe the grills down. I take it up to temperature and then use an oil covered applicator be it cloth or paper and wipe the grills again. If your grills are V shaped as mine are I run scarper down between all of the grates. Once done I run the BBQ for a few minutes to burn off any build up grime. Always clean and ready to go. I just had a perfectly grill NY strip loin, wife seems ok with it."
922434,Burtess,2015-06-30 00:26:00,901,"Crud gives the flavour??  That crud is basically just carbon build up.... after a good burn off (and before using the wire brush) you can tell the crud has nothing left in it as it will no longer smoke or anything.... just carbon.  Crud on the grates (and vaporizer plates) will just create flare ups and insulate the grate, preventing those nice grill marks.  Flavour comes from the juices dripping down onto the hot metal plates above the burner and being vaporized and settling on the surface of the meat.  Burt"
922436,NAW,2015-06-30 00:50:00,4022,"My mother in-law choked on one from my brush a few years back.  I didn't know what she was choking on until I chomped down on one the next time I had a BBQ. That brush went in the garbage.  It was a cheap dollar store brush.  Never again.  I'm sure it's happened to lots of people, no?"
922437,John Bacon,2015-06-30 00:54:00,3277,Slow news day for Hamilton. Maybe some people shouldn't be using BBQs. I think the government should start a wire brush registry.  Only for Quebec.
922439,woodenboater,2015-06-30 01:16:00,2277,"while the grill is still hot, I use Weber wire brush to clean off the easy bits then run it real hot to burn off the crud till bbq is smoking, then turn off. I always oil the grill before use so a brush or paper towels will pick up any left over stuff. but this story has made the rounds before but I guess CHCH is priming for summer time. can't blame them as it's basically PSA."

922474,craigdritchie,2015-06-30 11:47:00,1586,"Nothing wrong with a stainless steel brush provided it's one of good quality and you replace it every other season.  You hear about experiences like this every few years, and it inevitably results from people using a cheap, made-in-China brush that they found at the dollar store.  As with everything else in life, you get what you pay for."
922476,dave524,2015-06-30 11:52:00,4508,CTC has s stainless Brillo type pad thing that I use now after catching a few loose bristles on the grates.
