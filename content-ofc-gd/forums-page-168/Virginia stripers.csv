922787,aplumma,2015-07-01 20:07:00,6896,I am guessing you were at lake Anna. They are landlocked stocked stripers a very nice place to fish for sure. The lake has 2 sides a warm and a coolside. The bass population is amazing to fish for and there are some really big flathead catfish to be found as well.   Art
922789,misfish,2015-07-01 20:20:00,29133,Thats a mess of fish there. How do you cook those up?  BTW  There should be one of those signs at all launches.LOL

922801,misfish,2015-07-01 20:57:00,29133,yep it was lake Anna what a beautiful place to fish. Missed an awesome photo op with a bald eagle. Gonna fry them up on the BBQ later Brian I'll add pics and let you know how they turned out.  I like cajun please.
922828,aplumma,2015-07-01 23:44:00,6896,Yup a very nice place to fish I am 100 miles from there and fish it on the warm side in the winter. It is kind of weird though holding a bass in 30 degree weather and the fish is steaming because the water temp. is in the 60's. A trip to the bay is a real treat where the stripers can get up into the high 40's if you have the time.     Art
922947,misfish,2015-07-02 21:40:00,29133," Did you forget about me, or did you go into a coma after eating them? LOL"
922953,lickmyarmpit,2015-07-02 22:56:00,359,Lmao no it was all the 75 cent beers.  Tonight I will fry it up and hopefully add pictures but I am going to play in a pool tournament so i might put it off for another day. .   ...
922971,Walleye72,2015-07-03 02:14:00,156,Now there's a fish I have never caught or even eaten.   What would be the closest fish taste and texture wise to a striper?
922977,lickmyarmpit,2015-07-03 02:48:00,359,Delicious reminds me of a cold water smallmouth in taste.
