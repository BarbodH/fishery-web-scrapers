922251,Black_Blade,2015-06-29 02:02:00,258,"Simcoe Street all the way down to the lake, park right there at the beach area and walk out on the pier.  In the years I was down there never tried fishing off it or anywhere else in lake O for that matter..more of a small lake kinda guy"
922361,ckewley,2015-06-29 18:56:00,699,"I'm sure both species are there but have never seen one caught, more carp, small mouth & pike. The old marina is a good place, drift in a boat or if you look hard enough there are ways to get in there but by land you would/could be trespassing , however saying that I haven't seen a person get booted out of there in years. I heard arguments from locals saying it's not private property anymore but if you do enter know there is a chance it could be."
922367,CRAPPIE,2015-06-29 19:25:00,213,Thanks so much for the information. I don't have a boat and mainly shore fishing.  Thanks again!

923084,CRAPPIE,2015-07-03 20:08:00,213,Do I need to bring a long net just in case I hook a fish? Never been there and don't know how high the Pier is.  Thanks again!
923123,miller,2015-07-04 03:12:00,223,It's high you'll need a long handled net.
