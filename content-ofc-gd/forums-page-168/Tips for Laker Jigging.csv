We are going on a family camping trip (2 adults, 5 kids) to a lake that holds a multitude of species late next week.  Hoping to get into some great bass, trout and possibly gar.  Thanks!  I use cast champs btw."

923024,Jimmy_1,2015-07-03 14:43:00,13,"IF your set up right, you can mark your lure on your graph.  S. So I have been told! My new (to me) boat has a very fancy graph....navionics, color etc I just don't have time to read the biblical sized manual lol!  Ho would I see it on the graph? How would it look?"
923025,porkpie,2015-07-03 14:50:00,2521,"Bump the sensitivity up, and jig at the back of the boat as near to the transducer cone as you can.  Depending on the quality of the sonar, most should pick up a decent size jig in 100fow.  It will look like a line across bottom, and when you jig, the line will move up and down."
923026,Jimmy_1,2015-07-03 14:51:00,13,Ok too easy  But what will it look like on my graph? A fish? a hook? etc???

923036,Jimmy_1,2015-07-03 15:36:00,13,Thank you BillM
923037,misfish,2015-07-03 15:37:00,29133,Good pic Bill.  Another for ya. Click on pic to enlarge  
923038,Jimmy_1,2015-07-03 15:48:00,13,Those 3 up swings is your jig going up and down?
923040,BillM,2015-07-03 15:51:00,17367,"Yup, that's exactly what it is."
923043,misfish,2015-07-03 15:52:00,29133,"Those 3 up swings is your jig going up and down?   Yes. It,s a small williams spoon. It took me a bit to dial my finder in to pick up properly when I first got it.  But once I had a few buds help, it,s pretty easy."
923057,Jimmy_1,2015-07-03 16:42:00,13,Thanks a ton guys! This is great!
923141,4x4bassin,2015-07-04 06:23:00,1025,"I spend a lot of time on the water during the summer jigging lakers and to be successful you need a couple things . A fairly good graph with the sensitivity turned way up (mine is at 95) Some heavy jigs , I use nothing under 3/4 oz . The heavy jig gets you straight down in the water column which is important to get an accurate reading on your graph and a some what calm day on the water so you can stay on top of the trout . This is what a 15 lb lake trout looks like on the graph when it comes out of 50 feet of water and chases my jig to 35 feet and smashes it , game on !!! There is another 3 lake trout on bottom as well .    This one just shows you how far a lake trout will chase your jig . He came out of 49 feet and followed the jig up to 15 feet then back down to 32 feet and still didn't hit , it was fun anyway !    If you look back a bit I have a couple trip reports on here with some lake trout jigging . Good luck , once you get the hang of it . It's a blast"
923201,grimsbylander,2015-07-04 17:13:00,3016,^^^ That is very cool!! My idea of a video game! Thanks for posting.
923209,Joeytier,2015-07-04 18:20:00,3990,"Graph helps big time.  I don't have a high end graph that can read like that but I stick to jigging only on high-percentage areas that I know are holding fish, and as someone else mentioned, heavy jigs are a must so you can stay perfectly vertical.  I would suggest trolling until you get a better idea of where the fish are setting up on structure then go from there"
923291,Moosebunk,2015-07-05 03:01:00,3970,"Jimmy... you gotta be doing the graph thing right if you want to up your odds 1000%.  You've done it through the ice with a graph or flasher methinks, so make that same vertical action happen on the softwater... and tweak from there.  You got this dood, no problems."
923319,SirCranksalot,2015-07-05 13:10:00,3291,I had to play with my FF quite a bit in winter before I could see my lure. Turn the fish ID off for sure.  How do you plan on keeping your boat on the spot? an Ipilot or lots  of rope?
923324,porkpie,2015-07-05 13:51:00,2521,You don't need a high end graph for this either.  Some of the $100 jobs will do it no problem with laker size baits once set up right.
