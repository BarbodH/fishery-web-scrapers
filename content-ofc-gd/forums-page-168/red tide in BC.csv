Closed due to the worst red tide in modern times.  He says from cali all the way to BC.  Supper bummed. Not really sure what it means but I sure wanna get out there for some tank salmon
923087,Bill Shearer,2015-07-03 20:35:00,456,"The bad thing is that your planned trip is in jeopardy. The good thing is that there is always something to fish for in BC! Just change gears a bit. Dolly Varden, Cutthroat, Rainbows, Steelhead, Bull Trout. You can have so much fun you won't miss the Salmon at all. Another big plus is all the inland wildlife. And the Scenery! Believe me you will be in awe!  I'm just waiting impatiently for October!"

923098,manitoubass2,2015-07-03 23:24:00,11391,"Apperently its mainly shellfish, but has killed salmon, manatees and even whales. Also cormerants and peilcans feeding on fish.  Ive never fished BC so I really have no clue? But my cousin sure seems worried about it."
923099,manitoubass2,2015-07-03 23:26:00,11391,"Floatman, Ive been to BC many a times and its indeed beautiful!  Ive just never fished there(somehow?)  ill enjoy the trip regardless thats for darned sure"
