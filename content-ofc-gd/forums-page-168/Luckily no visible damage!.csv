923362,muskymatt,2015-07-05 19:03:00,2608,"My wife and I went for a fish and boat ride on the Ottawa river yesterday near Petrie Island. All was going great until, while trolling, we went between 2 channel markers that mark the entrance into the channel that leads to the marina. These markers are about 15 meters apart and I have gone between them hundreds of times over the last 15 years or so. I was within 10' of one of the markers doing approx 5mph in a muskie troll and BANG, up pops the 9.9 kicker and I can hear the 115 etech grinding on the rocks. Dang! ........I stop and check the engines and all looked ok, just a little prop damage on the kicker. I was left wondering why would there be an obstacle between channel markers? Should I have stayed right in the middle? Where the markers placed incorrectly? I was so pissed!  Am I incorrect in assuming clear passage between markers?  Never had that happen before.  "

923369,lew,2015-07-05 19:28:00,12766,"They used to float alot of logs down the Ottawa Matt, sometimes those old deadheads will pop up and ding you then disappear again.  I hit something in 20' of water one time on a body of water I'd been on for 3 decades and knew every inch of. They used that lake to float logs too and I'd bet $$$$ it was a deadhead that got me also."

923377,wallyboss,2015-07-05 20:35:00,1095,I might as well be careful then cause I usually aim for right between the two at WOT.  I haven't been there yet this year.  The submerged (island) is probably 20-25 feet wide maybe if the water was low( the rope anchored to bottom would have some loose in it) and that the buoy was getting moved away by the waves?

Thought of that but water levels are pretty good. Normal as far as I could tell.

923395,Moosebunk,2015-07-05 23:21:00,3970,"Arrrghhhh!!!  Your new MOTOR!!!  Sucks but could have been worse.  You assume right too, between two markers all should be good.  Thankfully you were only at troll speed."
923515,AKRISONER,2015-07-06 20:08:00,5558,banging off rocks is just an every day occurance in Georgian bay  glad to hear you didnt knock the leg off
923547,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-06 21:59:00,8243,"That absolutely sucks. We had a camp outside Westmeath on the Ottawa. It is full of mine fields. Lew's bang on, deadheads pop up when least expected, everywhere. Lucky you didn't fly through there with the big motor. I would check the lower end gear lube for any metallic's to be sure."
