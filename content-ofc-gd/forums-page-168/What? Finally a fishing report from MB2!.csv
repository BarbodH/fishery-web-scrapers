Woke up to major smog from forest fires but oh well.  Headed off and 3 honks, no Payne. Sorry lil bud that's the rule. So solo mission it was!  Hit RRFN by 8am    Arrived to high water but pretty clear water. Boy it felt good to be back at my favorite shore spot! I've spent thousands of hours fishing this spot in the past 6 years or so              First fish came quick. No real size to them. Caught about 20 or so ranging from 1.5-2lbs, but like Brian B says, ""a fish is a fish"". And I was all too welcome to enjoy the tug on the line!          Well after my fun at the rapids I realized I had forgotten my sandwiches at home, so it was time to pack up.  Along the way I decided to try one more spot quickly at a nearby marina in Barwick.  Great decision! About 10 casts in I caught my best bass of this early season! She took a white spinnerbait and fought hard!  A few pics and jumps and she was landed?  No measurement but Id guess about 18-19""s.  Tried to get a pic of the jumps but no luck.            Even though my day ended early it was on a positive note!  Not one other incidental species today, surprisingly!  Another day in paradise? miigwich  Rick"

923225,manitoubass2,2015-07-04 19:39:00,11391,Yep Brian. Only way to take a pic fishing by yourself. I dont lug around the dslr anymore or my gopro unless its a better planned outing.  And yep. My rule is 3 honks. I might wait 4 if i see your gear waiting outside.
923233,spincast,2015-07-04 20:06:00,3279,awesome day. Great shots of the rod at the marina. and this shot - man that water looks sweet  thanks for the report.
923249,aplumma,2015-07-04 21:56:00,6896,nice trip I would love to get my jetboat on those waters. We have some thin water down here that the smallies are hiding behind every rock.   Art
923251,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-04 22:01:00,8243,"Great report M2B2. Some great pics, the selfies not so sure about. Remind me to send you a couple of razors. You poor wife has to look at you in the morning. Unfortunately you don't have the DNA to grow a  beard like my hot head Latin DNA. But there is absolutely nothing wrong with those Bass.  How did you get away without a line of little M2B2 clones following behind you?"
923252,manitoubass2,2015-07-04 22:09:00,11391," Thats like 3 days of beard growth hahaha.  And as I said, selfies are the only option fishing alone without the gopro or dslr.  Sorry I upset you???  My kiddos were doing chores and two were visiting biological mom  I dont bring my kids to the rapids when water is high its too dangerous  Go buy a new bbq"
923254,manitoubass2,2015-07-04 22:12:00,11391,When i visit the hammer you can shave my back k OI????
923255,manitoubass2,2015-07-04 22:14:00,11391,"Dood, a few americans go through there every year and it scares the crap outta me.  Ive done alot of dumb crap but no way am i going through there on a ski"
923256,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-04 22:18:00,8243,There will no getting to touchy other than a few hi fives. I can promise you that Mr. Hipphopster.
923257,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-04 22:21:00,8243,"By the way no Ti Cat games, there are some kind of mini Olympics going on. Toronto is hosting Commonwealth Games Soccer in Hamertown. I guess that's OK as we have a drag strip near me that is called Toronto International Speedway that is about 3 hours from Toronto. I remember a lady from Ohio asking me if they could get a cab to downtown to do some shopping and asking how much it would be and how long a drive. About $300.00 and 3  hours with no traffic. It could be 6 hours with traffic. She thought I was kidding so she asked someone else."
923258,manitoubass2,2015-07-04 22:22:00,11391,"Hahahah,  Then dont crab about my faux beard.  I havent even showered in a week?  Been swimming twice a day, good enough.  Wife doesnt mind cause im awesome?"

923295,manitoubass2,2015-07-05 03:04:00,11391,"Thanks lbh!  And moosebunk, I hear ya. Fish after fish.  Mostly small but youll get the odd butterball especially as the water goes down. Then it also becomes a pike factory lol.  But come fall, that stretch holds almost mothing under 3lbs, and thats when it get really fun?"
