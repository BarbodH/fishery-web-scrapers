922792,woodenboater,2015-07-01 20:34:00,2277,Definitely looks like a head turner and would love to know the price if/when it comes out  Wonder what the tow capacity is on this and how hard it would be to modify it for camping.  http://theawesomer.com/toyotas-ultimate-utility-vehicle/326032/
922803,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-01 21:07:00,8243,"Definitely a head turner. Nothing you can't customize yourself with a few 10,000 bills. For the soccer Mom that trains MMA."
922804,manitoubass2,2015-07-01 21:07:00,11391,"Meh, look at the clearance.  Shnazzy vehicle though"
922814,KLINKER,2015-07-01 22:20:00,256,Best thing is Toyota will buy you another one when the frame rots out.
922817,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-01 22:35:00,8243,Will they buy me a Chevy?
922830,adempsey,2015-07-01 23:58:00,1498,Looks like a Minivan painted flat back with fancy wheels to me.
922833,woodenboater,2015-07-02 00:23:00,2277,it's a Sienna on a Tacoma 4 by frame. I've seen uglier vehicles than this haha
923112,tomkat,2015-07-04 01:23:00,246,Toyota Sienna Mad Max Edition
923239,spincast,2015-07-04 20:26:00,3279,"That's what you end up with after 11 recalls on a sienna.  Still no spare though, they still haven't figured that one out"
923245,manitoubass2,2015-07-04 21:32:00,11391,My new rig. Pulls the lund deep v like a charm!?  
923247,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-04 21:51:00,8243,"I've been in bigger golf carts. That would be fun to drive on the 401. I wonder if it will do 55KPH?  M2B2, I'm feeling better. Nice story post was when I wasn't, you understand. AOD."
923328,Rod Caster,2015-07-05 14:13:00,5784,The ultimate kid-hauler. I'd buy one... of course that's forgetting about the whole middle part where I do not have that kind of money to spend. For now I'll just jam some hockey pucks under my Corolla's struts.
923332,mr blizzard,2015-07-05 14:59:00,1589,"Not a van fan but it is a head turner for sure, looks bullet proof"
923347,manitoubass2,2015-07-05 17:34:00,11391,"Frig I looked again and this looks like our vehicle with a lift kit, paint job and new tires"
