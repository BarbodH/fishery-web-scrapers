923603,bigcreekdad,2015-07-07 02:19:00,546,"I've been going to Crane's Lochaven Lodge on the French River for 11 years. The camp mascot mainstay for all my time there has been Junior, the Crane's yellow lab. Last September, Junior's 14th year, I hugged him when I left, and shed a tear knowing I would not see him again. Lo and behold, he makes it through from then till now, and I once again could scratch his neck (he loves it) and feed him my lunch cookies (shh...against the rules).  However, Junior, now at 15, is in his last days. He's in pain, very weak, and Ed and Sue Crane have made the very painful decision to let him pass on to a better life sometime in the next few days. When we left this morning, Sue let me go into their cabin, unattended, to say goodbye to my old friend. You likely know how hard this was.....and, hell, I only saw him 2-3 times a year. It will be much worse for the Crane family.  I went through this with my beloved, and too young at 8, flatcoated retriever, Seamus, a few years ago. The effect on me was profoundly sad. Wept like a damn baby.  In some ways, God is cruel. Dogs should live longer than humans. I think they would handle our passing better than we of them. Besides, IMO most dogs are better than most people I know.  In any case....Godspeed Junior...I'll bring  a bag of cookies for when we next meet....but you'll have to share them with Seamus."

923650,doubleheader,2015-07-07 12:28:00,497,Dogs truly are one of God's finest creations. I have said goodbye to many a good pup over my lifetime and over the years I have come to believe there is something more for them in God's grand plan. The good Lord would never create such a perfect companion to have them only live this one short existence.
