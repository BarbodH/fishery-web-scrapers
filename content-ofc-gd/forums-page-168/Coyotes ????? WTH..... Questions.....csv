911632,John,2015-04-22 13:59:00,2956,"Not sure if anyone is trying to exterminate the species at the moment, just control the numbers. I was just trying to illustrate the point that you couldn't exterminate them even if you tried.(in the past people have tried exterminating all kinds of critters) People have trapped, poisoned, and shot them from aircraft with little affect on their numbers or expanding range, even with bounties in place. Another reason for there expansion is the reduction in wolf numbers, a less adaptable species. Nature doesn't like a void and the coyote is filling it. And to your second point, last time I checked I didn't see any signs here saying ""no Asian Carp wanted"" either. Both species are here to stay whether we like it or not but people will always try controlling them. Asian Carp are a good example of we humans interfering!  Ignorance is bliss I guess..........  Perhaps we need to realize that we live in a country with big bad critters all lining up to eat us. Maybe we need to learn how to adapt and stop blaming mother nature????"

I couldn't agree more Chris!!!  These animals were here long before us and it should be up to us to assimilate with them.  Coyotes are hunters just like us and at least in the country I find it super interesting to listen to them bark and howl at night.  Fair enough, I can see them as a problem in the city when they prey upon pets but I have a tough time faulting them for hunting in the country as they have done for hundreds and hundreds of years.  Everytime I come across a coyote is while I'm steelheading and they present no danger at all, in fact they are 10 times more elusive than deer and take off the second they spot us.  Last year was the first time I had witnessed a coyote hound hunt. We were fishing and heard dogs barking for about 10 minutes, and they got closer and closer.  I looked to the far bank and I saw a yote run to the edge and it look panicked and terrified and then take off.  1 minute later we saw 3 large beagle type hounds with gps collars on run to the same spot and then take off in the direction that the coyote took.  We were in an extremely remote area, and to be honest I just didn't see the sport in hunting these animals with dogs for nothing more than their fur at the most. No meat value at all!!!!  I might have had more respect for the ""hunters"" if they tracked them down themselves."

Funny how they suddenly become fans of coyote reduction then, especially upon hearing your a hunter.  Coyotes pose a minuscule risk to humans, but can pose problems for farmers and owners of small animals.  Nobody will eradicate yotes, short of an A bomb.  But a little hunting pressure never hurt. It removes the more bold of the local pack, and causes them to be a little less likely to wander into the barn to help themselves to the young of the year.  I've met few stock owners that don't keep a .22 of some flavor behind the seat of the tractor, or in the truck particulary in calving season.  They do it for a reason.

They seem to just start freaking out for no reason... Everything is dead calm and still all of a sudden the pack breaks out yelping, sounds like dozens of them. This will last for 30 seconds. Then everything is right back to dead calm, not a peep.  Other times I hear them howling (didn't know they did this) you will soon hear several others begin to howl, then the yelping starts again.... And dies quickly.  Then they will Yelp for several long minutes (I'm assuming after a kill?) almost sounds like they are fighting.

910412,FloatnFly,2015-04-16 03:08:00,1640,"Thanks FnF... But was wanting more info on their calls etc. Wikipedia is a good resource however for the basics  G   Guess I should have put this link instead  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote#Vocalizations   if you scroll down a bit from the first link, its the the next section after Ecology   Vocalizations[edit] The coyote has been described as ""the most vocal of North American wild mammals..."", whose vocal proclivity lead to its being given the binomial name Canis latrans, meaning ""barking dog"". At least 11 different vocalizations are known in adult coyotes. These sounds are divided into three categories: 1) Agonistic and alarm, 2) Greeting, and 3) Contact. Vocalizations of the first category include woofs, growls, huffs, barks, bark howls, yelps and high frequency whines. Woofs are used as low intensity threats or alarms, and are usually heard near den sites, prompting the pups to immediately retreat into their burrows. Growls are used as threats in short distances, but have also been heard among pups playing and copulating males. Huffs are high intensity threat vocalizations produced via rapid expiration of air. Barks can be classed as both long distance threat vocalizations and as alarm calls. Bark howls may serve similar functions. Yelps are emitted as a sign of submission, while high frequency whines are produced by dominant animals acknowledging the submission of subordinates. Greeting vocalizations include low frequency whines, wow-oo-wows and group yip howls. Low frequency whines are emitted by submissive animals, and are usually accompanied by tail wagging and muzzle nibbling. The sound known as wow-oo-wow has been described as a ""greeting song"". The group yip howl is emitted when two or more pack members reunite, and may be the final act of a complex greeting ceremony. Contact calls include lone howls and group howls, as well as the previously mention group yip howls. The lone howl is the most iconic sound of the coyote, and may serve the purpose of announcing the presence of a lone individual separated from its pack. Group howls are used as both substitute group yip howls and as responses to either lone howls, group howls or group yip howls.[8]"

910415,chris.brock,2015-04-16 04:38:00,4053,"This is a book about Ontario wolves, but I would guess the behaviors and calls are similar..  Wolf Country, by John B Theberge  He said howls let the others identify each other and the distance away they are. The excited yips and high pitched howls are frisky excitement and playfulness.  Fascinating book, I really enjoyed it."

910430,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-16 12:04:00,937,Has anyone had a bad encounter with coyotes?  I never saw one before.
910439,Beavertail,2015-04-16 12:48:00,331,My Beagle had a bad encounter with one...she is lucky to be alive but got torn up pretty good in the process. The incident happened in the spring when Coyotes can be very territorial because of their litters.
910448,porkpie,2015-04-16 13:32:00,2521,"Quite a few coyotes have had bad encounters with me.  I hunt a few beef cattle farms, and there is a shoot on site policy.  One of the farms had a cavalier King Charles killed in the backyard of the farmhouse.  Others have had calves killed.  It is what it is.  They are naturally predators, and we will naturally try to prevent them from preying on stock, or domestic animals.  Coyote attacks on humans are extremely rare."
910450,jimmer,2015-04-16 13:34:00,2730,"I as out bow hunting and sitting very still at ground level. I heard something behind me and slowly turned only to see a coyote standing about 10 feet from me. I just stared at it and then it stared howling, I started to laugh and it took off. That's my closest encounter with one."
910451,NAW,2015-04-16 13:38:00,4022,Yup..  There's coyotes everywhere.  Back to the OP..  http://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2014/03/coyotes-decoding-yips-barks-howls.html
910552,outllaw,2015-04-16 21:44:00,1232,yotes are bad in Windsor ont. I have had many encounters. I resorted to carry firecrackers. they challenge me I have been within 5ft of snarling yotes.
910561,bare foot wader,2015-04-16 22:27:00,1354,"I am not a coyote fan at all.....from my experiences, wild coyotes/hunted coyotes tend to be timid and quick to run off...coyotes near city limits/industrial areas/work sites (aka not hunted with easy food sources) tend to be much more aggressive and show little fear of humans  If you have house pets, monitor when they are outside, coyote swiped my ex gf's cats in our yard, watched them challenge my dog 20' away with me standing right there....get a few coyotes together and they have no problem tackling large breed domestic dogs  they often try to lure my dogs off the ice into woods while fishing in the winter, the female will act playful as the bait, and the rest of her pack is waiting in the woods.....had a close call when my dog was 6 months old...but now my dog is coyote smart and I have a few tails on the wall in my basement lol"
910574,Musky or Specks,2015-04-16 23:32:00,2710,Go buy yourself a predator call. (It sounds like a wounded small animal) When I lived out Bright way I use to call em in and shoot them with my bow in my front yard  You should be able to call them in to visual rasnge and actually observe their behaviour.
910587,OhioFisherman,2015-04-17 00:56:00,6623,"They are all over, they have been seen in the vacant industrial areas of Cleveland and even Chicago. I hear them once in a while in my area too, it's rural and plenty of places for them to roam, feed, and breed, more or less undisturbed. My son says he saw what looked like a coyote wander thru our yard one day, it might have been one.  A number of my neighbors have had their small dogs and cats go missing, chickens and turkeys disappear, but without seeing the cause it is hard to fix blame? I watched a hawk one day keep diving on my neighbor's Italian Greyhound, I told her to get it inside before it disappears, although it is hard for me to picture a hawk flying off with a 6-8 pound dog."
910593,Gerritt,2015-04-17 01:17:00,6129,A lot of good info here that's guys! NAW that's a good read! I hope to find some good documentaries that explain the various calls as well... YouTube here I come! (I'm a documentary freak)  G

910641,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 14:45:00,11391,"We have them everywhere around here. Wolves too.  They dont bother us much and stay a distance from the property(my dog loves taking them down)  So with that they generally stay away, until a new pack arrives.  Lotsa deer and rabbits out back. Im assuming thats what they are here for.  The sounds at night are eary, especially when your in the bush. And I have a hard time telling them apart from the wolves. Sometimes I think they are calling at the same time but Im not sure?"
