He bought a nice boat except it has a cracked exhaust manifold and a cracked block. This a clean boat for any year. Someone put it away wet.  I know there is a bevy of information and a network of marine guys here so maybe we can get him a replacement Mercruiser. He paid what the mint tandem trailer with surge breaks and new rubber is worth.  This thread might have to go into classifieds, mods just let me know.  Thanks to all."
