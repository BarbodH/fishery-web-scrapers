Averaging 20+ fish a day and several around the 18"" mark.  My favorite spot is off of Bluff Bar but its quite a trek from the launch at the provincial park.  Decent launch btw with lots of parking, a fish cleaning station, and toilets.  With the big storm they had on the lask weekend of June, some of the water is still pretty murky but the protected areas are crystal clear.  When the bite was on, anything seemed to work but my favs were scatter raps, shaky head jigs with a Havoc Bottom Hopper, and a Yum Dinger rigged wacky.  Spent half a day trolling/casting for pike and came up with nothing..  Spend half a day flippin for largemouth and came up with one decent fish.  As anyone whos ever spent any time out there the wind is key and anything out of the south or west is best.  PM me if you need any more details."
