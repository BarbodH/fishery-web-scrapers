922885,Jimmy_1,2015-07-02 17:20:00,13,Howdy!  Joined here a few weeks ago and only just got permission to post. I still cannot post or reply to a few folks in the classifieds. I wanted to purchase a few items which have since sold.  Any help is appreciated.  
922888,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-02 17:28:00,8243,"believe you have to post a minimum # of times to fully access classifieds.  And by the way, welcome. You will enjoy this most helpful and wonderful site."
922893,Sinker,2015-07-02 17:52:00,8692,"Yep, post great report in a few reports and get your post count up, then you can post in the classifieds.  S."
922896,Jimmy_1,2015-07-02 18:06:00,13,"So in order to say  ""Hey can I give you my $$$""  I have to just up my posts????"
922902,Gallie,2015-07-02 18:40:00,1215,Yes
922903,Gallie,2015-07-02 18:40:00,1215,"People feel better buying and selling from someone they know a little about, otherwise they could put it on kijiji."
922907,Terry,2015-07-02 18:56:00,14456,you cam pm him
922909,Sinker,2015-07-02 19:00:00,8692,"Yes, PM works as well.  S."
922914,aplumma,2015-07-02 19:27:00,6896,We have in the past had people who joined just to sell items or to get on the great deals our members extend to the community. So we have a 20 post minimum to be able to buy or sell for all of our protection. Feel free to P.M. the seller or better yet start posting meaningful comments or a thread to get to the 20 milestone you are wanting.   Art
