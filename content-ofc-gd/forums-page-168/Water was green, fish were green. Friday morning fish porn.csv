923039,misfish,2015-07-03 15:49:00,29133,"Slipped the toon into the local pond around 5 am this morning. There was a major algey bloom. Probly from all the rain we have had. Water was really dirty green. Vis was about two feet at best. I was surprised not one fish was caught top water, although there were fish jumping around eating up some large white fly that was around. Seemed they wanted a slow rolling light wieght  spinner bait.  It was a nice morning to get out.              A fish is a fish, no mater the size. LOL    "

923056,misfish,2015-07-03 16:41:00,29133,"I always like to visit this local pond a few times a year. Simcoe was the plan, but thought a change up would be nice. The new dark shades take some getting use to. Each time I tried to take a pic with them on, I couldnt see the buttons to push on the cam. It was like I was fishing in the dark without a light.LOL Not complaining."

923115,Moosebunk,2015-07-04 01:32:00,3970,"Great colors on that spinnerbait.  Bri... one warm little cottage lake I used to slip the toon into for largies with the odd smallie, I'd always and only have to chuck a gold Aglia #5.  Tipped with a worm.  It would cast a mile and lord man would it call fish in.  Try that out sometime."

923469,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-06 14:44:00,8243,"Sweet catch, nice little spot by the way Bri. I find 5 O'clock a little early for an evening topwater outing. 5AM!!! You nuts? After having to relieve all the farmers on the Docks at 05:00 when I was a young shift foreman I swore I would never get up at 3:30 again unless I absolutely had to catch a flight to the tropics or something. Every time we head out at dawn to fish I catch my first one at 09:00."
923488,manitoubass2,2015-07-06 17:37:00,11391,"Crap OI when we fish the backlakes were off at 230 or 3 to hit the wayer by 5, be at the spot by 530  That first feed of the day can bring in a frienzy"
923489,manitoubass2,2015-07-06 17:38:00,11391,"Not to mention the peacefullness and the superb sights, and 4 hours of fishing with calm waters?"
923682,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-07 15:14:00,8243,I used to pull into the camp when the boys were getting up to go hunting or fishing. I'm a night owl. Haven't set an alarm since 2007.
923685,fishnsled,2015-07-07 15:35:00,3520,"Really enjoy your toon reports Brian,  a great morning on the water."
