I hadn't checked out their Heritage Museum and still really haven't yet.  Although, today Bren dragged me into one part of it where I had the chance to look over 100's of chainsaws and a few other things.  Some of the chainsaws we found dated back to the 40's, and some were so big they had to be a couple 100 pounds a piece.  Anyways, thinking how a few OFC'ers might like this too, with the phone I snapped some pics.  For those not familiar with Wheelers, they are in the Guinness Book of World Records due to having the MOST maple syrup artifacts found in one place in this world.  If driving up around MacDonald's Corners outside of Lanark, I'd recommend the ""Canadian or Highland"" breakfast and a look around.  http://www.wheelersmaple.com/museum/                   Anyhow, there was another couple buildings, plus the trails, plus the main lodge, making for plenty more to see.

923417,Moosebunk,2015-07-06 01:34:00,3970,It'd be an easy stop for ya Shane on that route here.  Geesh... I think it'd even be faster to access the camp from the Ompah side anyways.
923422,smitty55,2015-07-06 01:52:00,928,I was in there this past season. By far the best pancakes (huge) and custom made sausages of any place. And lots of syrup on the tables. Best of all they're open all year long. I finally talked my whole family into visiting this year and everyone was impressed. The main lodge is impressive too. They rent it out for events as well. http://www.wheelersmaple.com/  Cheers
923423,Moosebunk,2015-07-06 01:57:00,3970,"Their zip line, slide and swings aren't for adults though... lol.  And here ya Smitty... kept trying to score the sausages off the kid's plates today.  They're awesome!!!"
923444,Rod Caster,2015-07-06 11:57:00,5784,Places like this exist?  This would be the easiest road trip sell ever to my wife. She's obsessed with pancakes and real syrup.
923458,mr blizzard,2015-07-06 13:43:00,1589,"Looks like a place I could spend hours at,,,,,not at the table lol but at the museum, right up my alley,,,,but by the sounds of it I could probably spend hours at the table, food sounds amazing, thanks for the pics"
923459,Joey,2015-07-06 13:47:00,9122,Now that is cool
