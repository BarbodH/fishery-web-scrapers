Perhaps the only reason people keep the dead ones (or near dead) is because they are obviously the easiest to land...They generally don't fight back when they're hooked.LOL  You also have to consider that the Ontario guide to eating sportfish does not recommend eating chinook salmon over 20"" from Western Lake Ontario (for kids and women of child bearing age) - That's considered pretty small as far as Lake O chinooks go on average - And that's the fresh fish still swimming in Lake Ontario.LOL"

So as far as safe to eat, I would say they are just as safe or just as bad (two different perpestives) as fresh caught fish from the lake.  I do suspect that they won't taste as good as a spring or summer fish from the lake."
