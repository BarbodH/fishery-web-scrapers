So we didn't get to stop much to fish.  And we didn't catch any fish at any of those spots.  And on the way back we pumped pretty hard to get back before dark.  But stopped at one last place about 1km from the launch First cast, I landed this guy!   That's a PB for me..  I didn't have my scales or tape.  But it felt pretty heavy!     "

923529,NAW,2015-07-06 20:54:00,4022,"I have never had my hand in a mouth that big!  To be honest, I feel bad.  I tried to lift it on an angle a bit, and my finger tips actually started to rip through the skin on the bottom of her mount.  I felt bad..  Lesson learned."
