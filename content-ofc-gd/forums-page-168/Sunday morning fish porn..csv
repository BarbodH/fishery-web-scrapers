( team ones going to hate me for this, no sign.)  Arrived to morning west winds, but the call of changing to the south 6 k made me fish this spot. Didnt take long for the west to die.     Throwing the spinner bait searching for active fish, but none to be found. I found that odd in this one spot. Tie on my favorite tube and what ya know, they just wanted something to drop right in front of thier face. Lazy buggers.  Probly hooked into a dozen of them and lost a few others.        It was sock washing day.LOL    Nasty.     The lake calmed down so headed out to the drop off to try some jigging. Marked some fish , a lone juvie herring was all that was offered up.    . Oh that south wind they called for, really was from the east. Go figure.  So decided to head back in and play with the smallies again. This is where I am watching the graph and seeing fish zooming off the bottom and up to about the 5 foot mark in 18 fow. Active fish. I decide to start throwing the spinner bait. 2nd cast and it,s on. This fish comes rocketing out of the water. No no, Im going to lose it. Down it goes only to come rocketing out again. Im like OMG come on. Finaly get it to the toon and it wants to dive again. I grab the net and out it rockets again right in front of me. I just heaved back the pole and got it in the net. Long and fat. Picture does not do justice for this fish. It was pushing high 6,s for sure. My previous one was short and real chunky. Not easy to compare them, but holding it, I could tell.    "
