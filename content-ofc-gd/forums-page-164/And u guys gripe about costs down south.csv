So I went in to enquire.  The owner states his beef is raised on local farms, grain fed without hormones.  I'm immediately impressed.  He also hangs his beef for 21 days.  Most grocery stores age their beef 7 days & if you look into the Sterling Silver beef at Sobeys, it's aged 14 days.  Again I'm excited to try his beef.  So, I order the loin, he cuts it to my desired thickness - 1"" & 20 minutes later I'm on my way home.  We did 1 on the BBQ - It was awesome!  Best cut of beef I have ever tasted!  So tasty, mouth watering beef - I'll never shop any where else for my steaks."
