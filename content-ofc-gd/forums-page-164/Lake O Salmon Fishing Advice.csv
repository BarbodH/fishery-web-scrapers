925855,AKRISONER,2015-07-23 13:05:00,5558,"Uh, yup. 2 years in a row now. Would be nice to see a couple weeks of consistent gentle west winds and a stable air mass - give the lake a chance to set up. And SP sure ain't what it used to be as a source for info. Cover the water vertically and horizontally. I target 40 - 90 down on the riggers, and use planers with leadcores for stealth, and always at least one wire-dispey-flasfher-fly combo out between 150 and 225.  Keep changing up the presentation (big, small, colours, speed, spoons, meat, lymans, bodybaits, fly, direction) till you find a strike. And get out and set up before the sun rises.  my minimal experience on lake O showed me that fishing before Sun up was about 10x more productive than fishing once the sun had risen.  We came out of Bronte last year, and caught 8 shakers plus a rainbow and a 15 lb chinook in the first half an hour on the water...after the sun had risen we caught 2 more fish for the next 6 hours."
925873,BillM,2015-07-23 14:51:00,17367,"It really depends..  I had probably the best day out on Lake O a few years ago with my buddy Justin.  Blue bird skies out of PC, double, triple headers all day.   I had a 25lb'r pull the line out of my hand as I went to set it in the release  :)    Just insanity, I'll never forget that day."
925881,Gallie,2015-07-23 16:06:00,1215,Ive fished the morning bite a few times and it can be good but the magic hour before sunset is the best in my opinion for tricking monsters into the boat. That and the early afternoon bite during a full moon is pretty stellar as well.
925882,Sterling,2015-07-23 16:10:00,477,"  Salmon? Or lakers? or both?  The old salmon population debate...is it existant or not.  Both, we could have kept going but a couple guys had conservation licenses."
926096,John Bacon,2015-07-25 03:29:00,3277,I caught a couple of Chinook out there this morning.  Both of my fish were on a blue and pink spoon off of the rigger.  First was down 60'; for the second the rigger was down 90' in 200' of water.  These were caught straight out from Frenchmans Bay.It has been a tough year; hopefully things will pick up.  The wind forcast for the next while is out of the west; that may help.

926289,John Bacon,2015-07-27 02:20:00,3277,"I caught a coho on a blue, white, and chrome cheater spoon today.  My friend caught a rainbow on a green spoon.  There were both in about 200' or water off of Pickering."
927451,FloatnFly,2015-08-03 11:50:00,1640,"Thanks for all the advice all.  Went out yesterday and landed a lot of really small stuff, nothing big.  Got a 12"" Atlantic out there.  Most excitement came when the rigger popped, big bend in the rod, get the fish to boat, and there's 2 fish on the end of the line, one on the slider spoon, and another on the main spoon.  The weather chased us off the lake by 230-3pm.  Today looks like a write off.  On a side not, got my daughter out for first boat ride, and she loved every minute of it."
927492,Freshtrax,2015-08-03 16:10:00,2215,sounds like a fantastic day
925618,FloatnFly,2015-07-21 23:15:00,1640,"Well, with my Dad coming up from Sarnia for our annual salmon trip on Lake Ontario, I'm looking for some hints on depths the fish are sitting, not looking for a specific locations, rather what zone to target.  I do not own a boat, I only get out on the lake once or twice a year, when my Dad brings his boat up.  After our skunk last year, I'd like to try and prevent that this year.  We will fishing out of Whitby.  What are some go to colours, and depths people are fishing?"
925620,Gallie,2015-07-21 23:20:00,1215,"Im not familiar with whitby as i rarely leave the bluffs but i can try to help you out, ill send you a pm"
925622,FloatnFly,2015-07-21 23:22:00,1640,"Thanks Gallie, I don't think there'd be a whole lot of difference"
925624,mitch seguin,2015-07-21 23:25:00,98,http://www.spoonpullers.com/  Have a read through this site.  Some good info to consider for your outing.

925648,Freshtrax,2015-07-22 01:36:00,2215,I'd  start in 80 and work 80-130.   If no fish in the first 2 hours head south to 250-300
925652,FloatnFly,2015-07-22 02:53:00,1640,"Ok, will keep that in my notes as well, will be going out on the long weekend.  will hopefully be a good time"
925673,BillM,2015-07-22 09:48:00,17367,"If all else fails hit the bluezone with lures anywhere from 20>45ft down.  Shouldn't have an issue catching coho or steelhead.  Bright patterns, orange, etc."

925692,AKRISONER,2015-07-22 12:58:00,5558,"can someone clarify something for me, if you are marking hooks 100 feet down in 400 fow...what depth are you running your lines? are you dragging the lure past them at 100 or are you still running 60?"
925696,Garnet,2015-07-22 13:16:00,2056,Just take a quick trip down to Oshawa Harbour or Whitby Pier.  I live on the hill in Bowmanville and the boats move from 80-100 into 60 last week. Have been camping so don't know what going on now but a quick observation will tell you.
925698,Gallie,2015-07-22 13:16:00,1215,"If i was targeting hooks 100 feet down or so i would have lines at 100,90,80 and then leave my other 3 higher. You dont want to fish under them."
925705,AKRISONER,2015-07-22 13:46:00,5558,"If i was targeting hooks 100 feet down or so i would have lines at 100,90,80 and then leave my other 3 higher. You dont want to fish under them.   Thank you for the clarification....will be out on Lake O in the next bit and somehow ive become the guide and Ive never fished it without a guide lol"
925706,Sterling,2015-07-22 13:58:00,477,"Went on a charter last week on lake huron and the thermocline was at ~45ft.  We pulled 3 lines at 40, 45 and 50ft. Most of our hits came from those 2 lines.  We also had 4 lines sitting at 20-40 feet, they got maybe 1/4 of our hits. We had another line dragging the bottom and 2 lines running dipsies at various intervals.  In 8 hours of fishing we got 24 hits and limited out.  The other group that was with us fished deeper and didn't do well at all.  Small sample size but I would consider fishing the thermocline if you can."

925737,Sterling,2015-07-22 16:39:00,477,"  you taught me about the cheater last year bill  I prefer the term ""tangler"".   Sounds like a great day on Lake Huron! What area were you fishing on?  Manitoulin, right out of south baymouth."

925792,FloatnFly,2015-07-22 23:19:00,1640,"Thanks everyone, 2 years ago we found a nice school of 10-15lbers just out of whitby harbour around the white bouy markers.  hoping we find something like that again and may be something large.   I can get a general idea of where the boats are fishing, doesn't give me an idea of how deep riggers are set, or what combinations or working"
925798,leaf4,2015-07-23 00:33:00,2466,This thing would be helpful when rigging lol. More so if it had Bluetooth and you could watch in reeeeel time!    https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gofishcam/gofish-cam
