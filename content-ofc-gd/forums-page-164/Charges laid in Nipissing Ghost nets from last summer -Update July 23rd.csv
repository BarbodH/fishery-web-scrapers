926438,G.mech,2015-07-28 10:16:00,830,"Sounds like the Nipissing FN have some problems within their community. Does the Band Council speak for the community or not? In the NonNative community it's called breaking the law and the individual is dealt with in the courts. There needs to be more transparency in the FN community so that they gain some credibility.  Well the short answer to your question is 'NO'.  The majority on many reservations do not believe in or recognize the elected band councils since they are members of a system that was put in place by the Canadian government (The Crown).  These factions only recognize their traditional governments such as their Chiefs Councils, Men's fires etc.  This issue is a major contributing factor in the inability to resolve any land claims as there is no consistent and supported leadership.  This can be witnessed  with many of the Southern Ontario claims such as Caledonia where the elected Band Council and the HCCC (Chief's Confederacy) are constantly at odds over who is in charge.  Same deal here, many of the members have no regard for anything the Band Council does or says, they follow their traditional treaties and leadership."

926551,manitoubass2,2015-07-28 23:50:00,11391,"It baffles my mind how some people think FN are run.  Corruption, yes.  Greed, yes.  Favortism, yes.  But not on every FN.  And the band members can easily vote them out.  Council is not implemented by canadian government either. They are elected by memebers and are paid by honourarium.  Also, FN do not solely police themselves, MNR and OPP can easily step in without red tape.  Im gonna go off topic here and I hope it doesnt cause a huge backlash.  Aboriginals signed treaties that go back to england(and canada for all intended purposes).  Alot of their funding comes from ""renting the land and resources of those who were here before settlements"", not tax dollars.  And where tax doĺlars do come in, thats on the queen, so take it up with her.  And aboriginal governance is as transparent as can be, its all available online as ever band is audited every year. Do some research.  But here is one that I do not necessarily agree with. Some years ago my FN friend passed away. I was asked to clean his office. He had saved all documents for land claims, treaties etc.  In there I found an agreement. All FN that break Canadian laws, are to be dealt with not the same as other Canadians, but to exhuast all measures of rehab for their crimes.  Now dont get me wrong, i actually agree with this idea. But for all of canada not just FN.  Again, I side with nature. Leave Nip alone, EVERYONE"

First Nations members are not Indians, Indians come from the east not Canada for God sakes, this is 2015 not 1715. I find that word offensive to both Indians and First Nation peoples. Having said that I do not think it fair for only you to argue on the side of any First Nation issues here. There was an individual, of who's name I don't recall, that usually gives us the point of view of NFN as he is a member. This issue had been talked about for many years now. At least the NFN have a closed season on netting now. It is a first positive step forward.  And I have to say it's easy to say to someone who's livelihood is in jeopardy to say, "" Move and get a different occupation"". Easy to say very difficult to do. Many outfitters have their life savings tied up in their camps. For some it's all they have done since a child. I would not go quietly into the night, as I am sure most of us wouldn't."

It needs to be stopped flat out. It's become abuse. The fishery is ripe to rebound. There are tons of small pickerel. My last trip there was stupid with the numbers of fish put in the boat. Something needs to be done. I doubt our current political situation will allow for it. It's a real shame, the lake is a factory if it is allowed to do its thing.  The people who buy the damn fish could stop the commercial netting in less than a week, simply by NOT buying the fish.  I am not from the area, I don't know any of the stakeholders involved, but I do KNOW. If there is no market for a product it doesn't get produced for very long. You don't see too many factories cranking out PCBS or DDT these days. If it is such an environmental calamity why are their still IDIOTS buying the fish?  I would bet the biggest irony is that a lot of the restaurants who are buying the cheap fish... aren't going to survive the drop in TOURISM in the area due to the lowered slot limits, anyhow.... Yet they will be the first to complain someone has to save the fishery to save us...."
926126,pics,2015-07-25 14:43:00,1268,There's a lot of behind the scenes politics with first nations government. This is why self government would not work in most communities at this time. A young native I know was being groomed to be chief of a small band but he chose a career in policing instead.. he saw the writing on the wall. I can only imagine the turmoil in the band when the suspect seems to be related to the chief..
926216,Musky or Specks,2015-07-26 12:03:00,2710,"I know my views arent always popular in here, but my family is aboriginal and here is one thing I have to say.  If I seen these nets I would document it and cut them.  I know its illegal but whatever, to me and our community protecting the resource trumps law.  I would fight to impose a DRASTIC reduction in commercial fishing for a period of time, then re access.  Same for sport anglers, c&r only for a time then re access later  Id make FN commercial fishing, or any commercial fishing, pay and take part in restocking or severe penalties.  Id also fight to impose huge increases in prices of fish from nip to make it not worthwhile for the time being for commercial fisherman, vendors, resteraunts etc. Hey it's only fair that if the natives who have historical treaty rights to fish for sustenance close down their fishing then we the dilettante Johnny come lately fishing for recreation should halt our fishing as well. Might not be a popular opinion but it is only through compromise and working together with the native peoples that we are going to be able to conserve the Canadian ecology. SACRIFICES WILL HAVE TO BE MADE BY BOTH SIDES."
926217,Musky or Specks,2015-07-26 12:19:00,2710,Just that you pointed out that those who are effected by the down fall of the lake can move and I just pointed out that those who are contributing to it's down fall can move also.  You have pointed a LOT of good points today......keep them coming.  My solution is to do away with all commercial fishing if it's nets or anyway else. But let's do it like they did for Lake Erie in NYS. They imposed a $3 stamp that anyone who fished the lake must purchase for the next 3 years to buy out ALL LICENSED COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN (this would be need to tweet for all aboriginals who NOW fish the lake commercial purposes in a LEGAL form).  The money that those Indians would receive could start them into another business like purchasing a boat for chartering anglers or develop land for cottages to run or whatever. This would move them into the 21 century without losing their history or livelihood.  BTW after 2 years NYS did away with the stamp because they had more then enough funds to buy out the commercial fishermen and the lake has rebounded into the BEST Walleye fishery in the WORLD.  No reason the Big Nip can't rebound too with the right management and only sport fishing.  edited to say I have NO IDEA why some of the above is outlined in white... I love the idea of a specific use tax but there is no such thing in Canada no matter what a politician tells you. It is against our constitution. All taxes must go into a general coffer and then be distributed from there.  If I had my druthers there would be a flat fishing license charge and the a 2 dollar stamp charge for every watershed or area you fished in. We pay far to little right now for the right to fish(Consider what trail permits cost) I know most wouldn't be for this but that's because once money goes into the coffer it now just disappears with no accountability. In the US they have Wallop-Breaux which is a tax on all sport fishing related items. That is why their DNR is run so much better than ours and they have such an extensive stocking program.

No I am totally agreeing with you. Treaty says they have a right to fish that makes it a law founded in our constitution. If they give up that right to protect the fishery we (non-natives) will look like idiots and self serving morons if also don't give it up. Our right to fish isn't protected by any law.  Now if you want to argue about if there should even be treaty rights that's a whole other ball game. Until those treaty rights are negotiated into nothingness though they are the law."

This commercial fishery should be illegal in the first place(large scale that is)  Traditional fishing did include nets, but obviously not nets of a massive scale.  Here we use nets(not me specifically but family and friends). They are small, put it in for 8 hours pull up then you have your fish (for personal or traditional use).  Family that commercial fish use the same nets, empty them 3 times per day then pull the nets. At $9 a lb its a decent living for an easy job...  Thats where it get crazy. Huge nets, large numbers of fish multiple time per day. Big bucks, hire a few kids to fillet and badda bing badda boom.  Big money and little work.  Its greed.

Over the years that the Nip situation has been burning away, we have learned that it is by far the minority of NFN that are ""abusing"" the lake. This select few have had virtually free rain on the lake, with the senior members of the group, endorsing their efforts. We have a member here who has given us some insight as to the workings of the group. We have also been told that people who are against the netting and therefore potentially affecting some of the groups income, could expect reprisals should they speak too loudly. It's a mess and will continue to be a mess until either leadership at NFN changes or the lake simply collapses. We all know that there is simply no political will to make any kind of change, at any government level. Finding the guilty parties with regard to the ghost nets is a baby set in the right direction. I don't expect any harsh repercussions as a result of court time, but at the very least, they may have reduced the number of ghost nets floating and killing  across the lake. HH"
926011,manitoubass2,2015-07-24 14:26:00,11391,"So Nip is a huge lake.  Hows many ghost nets are we talking here?  Is it a combination of anglers harvesting and Fn netting thats dwindling the lakes populations?  Or are we talking huge numbers of ghost nets?  Where are these nets? Id think its fair to assume they would be relitively close to FN(if they are indeed solely responsible)  Who is this chief? Better yet who is on counsel?  More times then not its counsel that runs the show, the chief is but a figurehead.  Sometimes, the counsel is in the backpocket of the chief(usually though family, or vise versa)  When this happens however their terms are usually very short as the rest of the community suffers and does not vote them back in.  Anyhow thats just a little insight.  This sounds like a weird, made for tv mystery to me."

Sad reality   Is it just me, or is anyone else tired of hearing about lodge owners on the lake? I'm sure im not the only one to have felt job loss, for one reason or another.

You have pointed a LOT of good points today......keep them coming.  My solution is to do away with all commercial fishing if it's nets or anyway else. But let's do it like they did for Lake Erie in NYS. They imposed a $3 stamp that anyone who fished the lake must purchase for the next 3 years to buy out ALL LICENSED COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN (this would be need to tweet for all aboriginals who NOW fish the lake commercial purposes in a LEGAL form).  The money that those Indians would receive could start them into another business like purchasing a boat for chartering anglers or develop land for cottages to run or whatever. This would move them into the 21 century without losing their history or livelihood.  BTW after 2 years NYS did away with the stamp because they had more then enough funds to buy out the commercial fishermen and the lake has rebounded into the BEST Walleye fishery in the WORLD.  No reason the Big Nip can't rebound too with the right management and only sport fishing.  edited to say I have NO IDEA why some of the above is outlined in white..."
926028,manitoubass2,2015-07-24 16:50:00,11391,"NFN should be developing in all avenues of community structure and that leads to jobs.  A problem ive seen too often. Start a lodge or two( and financially its easy trust me) hire some experienced anglers and some teenagers for the camps.  Train some carpenters, to help build the community. Open grocery store and gas station(if they havent already)  Offer training to become CO's.  The nore jobs available and the better the community you'll eventually kill off those abusing the fishery.  One thing again, that bothers me, if indeed these ghost nets are FNF, someone in the community has no idea what due diligence means. Out them and oust them.  They are a disgrace to nature, the creator, the lake, their elders and their respective community"
906148,kickingfrog,2015-03-26 22:09:00,8333,"http://www.nugget.ca/2015/03/26/charges-laid-in-gill-netting   The Ministry of Natural Resources has confirmed charges have been laid in relation to the unmarked gill nets found in Lake Nipissing last summer.  “I can confirm that on March 24, 2015 charges were laid in relation to the unmarked gill nets,” Jolanta Kowalski, Senior Media Relations Officer with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry told The Nugget Thursday afternoon.  She said the suspect was charged with wasting flesh of fish suitable for food (an offence under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997) and for leaving decaying fish in a net (an offence under the Federal Fisheries Act).  “We appreciate the cooperation and assistance of the Nipissing First Nation in this matter. Since this matter is now before the courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.”  Kowalski refused to identify the suspect and didn't provide an explanation.  From June 7 to late August the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry officers pulled 13 abandoned nets from Lake Nipissing. Most of the nets contained hundreds of dead fish.  The first net was discovered on Lake Nipissing on June 7. The net had more than 200 rotting fish in it.  As the nets continued to be found in Lake Nipissing, community organizations and groups jumped on board to help and bring attention to the issue.  BAYSAR Search and Rescue joined forces with the MNRF in the summer to help look for abandoned gill nets. The volunteer organization took five flights over the lake.  The North Bay and District Chamber of Commerce and Lake Nipissing Stakeholders Association called for the arrest of person or persons responsible for gill nets after discovery of a fifth 200-foot net full of rotting fish floating in Lake Nipissing.  Nipissing First Nation put a stop to gill netting on Lake Nipissing last fall in response to concerns from its community members about the health of the walleye fishery.  Chief Marianna Couchie stated in a previous article that the band council closed down gill netting on the lake until spring when the recreational walleye fishing season opens. She said many people wanted Nipissing First Nation to close gill netting right down, however the band council opted instead for a temporary closure out of concern for community members whose livelihoods depend on the fishery.
