926614,porkpie,2015-07-29 13:42:00,2521,That's the one to buy.  When the 870 express was still made well!  I'm generally a wood all the way guy but for my deer/duck/goose/turkey beater pump I use a synthetic win 1300.  I only take my old browning A5 out when the weather is decent.
926618,Beavertail,2015-07-29 14:03:00,331,"Yeah, keep in mind that most of the pump guns produced today (eg Rem Express, Mossberg) will have cheap, low grade wood stocks with no grain and pressed checkering that aren't very strong at all, and IMO look even cheaper than synthetic. If you want nice walnut, go with a Wingmaster or Browning BPS."
926620,dave524,2015-07-29 14:06:00,4508,"Get a real 870 Wingmaster not even an early Express. Even in the 80's Expresses had a finish that was a cheap imitation of Suncorite that was used on Lee Enfields, almost a painted on finish  that easily scratched and chipped,  like they used stove black on the metal. When looking for an older 870, try to get one that takes the RemChoke tubes, having a set of tubes will add to the versatility of the barrel over a fixed choke, especially  in the field.  I consider my personal 12 gauge , the best they made, a late 80's Special Purpose 3"" 870 Magnum, it has a real walnut stock with cut checkering, came with sling swivels installed and a camo sling, 26 inch vent rib barrel with a full set of chokes and best is all the metal has a dark gray true phosphate Parkerized Finish. Yes, you will have to pry my cold dead fingers off it."
926644,kickingfrog,2015-07-29 16:38:00,8333,And that's when the fight started. lol  My head understands the pros of synthetic but my heart doesn't care. It's a personal choice that has more to do with heart then head.
926655,BassMan11,2015-07-29 18:16:00,583,"And that's when the fight started. lol  My head understands the pros of synthetic but my heart doesn't care. It's a personal choice that has more to do with heart then head. Fair enough,  Personally I like the look of a wood stock myself. Just asking if there were really any significant pro's or con's.  This is all great information. I always like to be as educated as possible before i go into a store to make a purchase. Most of the time I end up knowing more about an item / items than the person working there."
926662,misfish,2015-07-29 18:55:00,29133,My pop refinished mine. I didn't like the original finish. It is now a nice satin finish and the wood shows well.
926663,Rustic-Fisher,2015-07-29 18:57:00,826,"Wingmaster, SuperNova,BPS, would be my choices in order .  Wingmaster is a do all very reliable pump gun with a million after market accessories . Nicely blued and polished from the factory . With the express 870 you may find yourself having to polish the chamber as as many feature a rough chamber that causes grief ejecting shells.  Express models seem more prone to rust also.  SuperNova is a basically industructable pump that handles 3.5 inch shells if you choose, strips down for cleaning in the field with zero tools, comfortec stock is cool and deffinetly reduces felt recoil ,  shims to adjust the stock to your liking are all so a bonus . It is a heavy gun though, pump stroke is long for some peoples liking, also asseccaries are scarce and costly .  BPS (Browning pump shotgun ) is a great bottom eject shotgun perfect for a leftie. Accessories are fairly common, love the tang Thumb Safety,  one big negative for me was complete tear down and cleaning as it can get trickey.  A newer Ithaca M37 is a cool option  if you can find one threaded for chokes for more versatility , bottom eject and  they have a slam fire option ( hold the trigger and pump away) you'd likley never use it but kinda cool. Newer M37s also seem to have some of the nicest wood on a pump you'll find .  Wood vs Synthectic ...... In my opinion Wood stocks are deffinitly nicer to look at but having owned guns with AAA grade walnut stocks I hated smashing through the underbrush of a grouse cover trying not to mark up the fancy stock. Even though scratches build character on a stock, it still hurt. I've since learned to love just plain black synthetic for the pounding and crappy weather  conditions it can take . The most important thing as others have stated is make sure which ever gun you choose shoulders nicely and feels right. Just my 2 cents , good luck Ry"
926681,ratherboutdoors,2015-07-29 20:30:00,132,"Have to agree with Ryan on this one.  Grew up with a wingmaster never, ever an issue.  Only downside was that it wasn't threaded for chokes and couldn't 'officially' shoot steel.  Yes for under $300 I could have replaced the barrel but being that I like new things, I just picked up a Super Nova from Cabela's when they had them on clearance a few weeks ago.  Shoots 3.5 (wow, do they have punch) and fits me very well.  I also looked at the Winchester SXP as it is getting great reviews however for the price difference I went with the Benelli (on sale) might not have if it wasn't."
926457,BassMan11,2015-07-28 12:28:00,583,"I have just received my PAL license in the mail and will now be looking to buy my first shotgun. Obviously reliability, easy to use and maintain being factors when looking at my first firearm. Uses will be from Turkey to other small game birds/animals. I would also like to get into some skeet/trap shooting at a club near my house... but I would assume that would be a different gun all together. Any input would be greatly appreciated as I will start my own research as well.  thanks for your input.  Bassman"
926460,Big Cliff,2015-07-28 12:43:00,6899,"Remmington 870 express will do everything you need to do and then some. Mine is 35 years old, has been dropped in the mud fallen out of tree stands, drowned a couple of times and it still works as well today as it ever did. I've won trap compititions with it shot ducks, deer, upland game birds, you name it. Excellent all round gun!"
926462,Gerritt,2015-07-28 12:47:00,6129,All depends on how deep your pockets are to be honest...  That said my first shotgun was a 870 Probably one of the most popular shotguns ever made. And highly configurable for future uses.  And it's affordable.  G

926466,Beavertail,2015-07-28 13:19:00,331,"Yep, I'll jump on the big green wagon too...Rem 870 pump would be a good start. Still have mine two decades later (my first firearm purchase) and I've harvested just about everything with it. Right now it has a dedicated rifled slug barrel and scope on it, and that's the great thing about them, very versatile with many aftermarket options for them. Being a pump you most likely won't have any mechanical issues with them either, very reliable. Like I said though, it's a good start...I guarantee it won't be your last one! Welcome to the club."
926467,porkpie,2015-07-28 13:24:00,2521,"Just about everyone gets an 870 to start. I'll be the lone dissenter, and not because the 870 is a bad gun, at least the ones of 15-20 years ago where good.  Remington quality of late has been crap .  If you can find an old 870 or an old Winchester 1300, you'd be better off than buying a new rem.  If your pockets are a bit deeper, get a wingmaster.  You'd probably have it for life.  Otherwise take a look at the Brownings if yor budget allows.  Good luck."

A 410 ? no............ an 870 YES........... the only reason is I like it, its fairly affordable, quite reliable, easy to maintain,  but in fairness do your homework, it is soooo easy to go beyond your budget , its like 2 footitice when owning a boat if u know what I mean, start out with something reliable and at your price point, then if you find u truly are enjoying the sport go from there, you can buy a lot of turkeys for 2000 dollars lol"
926502,kickingfrog,2015-07-28 16:36:00,8333,"I'm a huge proponent of the smaller gauges, but as a single cover-all-bases shotgun a 12 is a good place to start. Used ones are readily available from private sales or most small stores, check out EPPs website even if you're not close. It will give you an idea as to the price ranges of what might be out there. A three inch chamber gives you more options and  a 3.5 inch is nice but not a must. Get the right size shot and load and you can use it for everything and then add to the collection it you want to later. Pump/auto/double is another angle. All have pros and cons that will depend on what you want and use it for most and just plain personal preference."
926522,Joeytier,2015-07-28 19:28:00,3990,"Benelli super nova only shotgun you will ever need I was going to suggest the Nova as a more economical option, but the SuperNova is an incredible shotgun.  A Nova 3.5"" pump will likely be my next gun purchase."

It's prone to jamming.  If you can buy an older express, you would likely be okay, but I would still recommend an SA-08"

926564,KLINKER,2015-07-29 01:11:00,256,"The 870 is great for when you run out of shells, its so heavy you can use it for a club and if you have to swim with it you're gonna drown. Its a real good hip shooter but on the shoulder its a handful for a smaller guy, its a big gun. its a bit of a pop gun with light 2 3/4 but If you want to make your own fast, heavy 3""loads it can be a cannon.  Dad had an old Stevens pump that he could hit anything with right off the wall, it was just a good fit, a lot smaller than my 870."

926587,BassMan11,2015-07-29 11:37:00,583,Thanks for all the replies guys. So it looks like and older 870 (preferably a wingmaster) is the way to go for your very first gun. After looking around last night the older wingmasters are tough to find.... and there is probably a reason for that. I also like the new Benelli option as well... a little more money but boy it's a nice looking firearm. Next question would be... if I were to buy a brand new gun.... do you go wood or synthetic?

Personal preference...I'd go synthetic on a utilitarian pump-combo gun that is probably going to get dragged through the mud and abused, especially a first gun. On your next gun you can spend a lot more once you confirm your love of the sport and buy a real purdy, shiny blued, fancy walnut stocked side by side 16 gauge for grouse that you will only use while wearing cotton gloves and the sun is shining : )"
