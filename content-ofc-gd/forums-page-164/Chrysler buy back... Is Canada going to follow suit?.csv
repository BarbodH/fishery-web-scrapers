926396,grimsbylander,2015-07-28 01:04:00,3016,The government bailout was only back in 2009 and it was predicted that taxpayers lost 3.5 billion when the smoke cleared. Now the parent company for Chrysler posted a 101 million dollar 1st quarter net profit and has 20 billion in cash and securities? That's a substantial rebound.

926526,Gerritt,2015-07-28 19:53:00,6129,Yup that's what I thought too.... They will use this to their advantage to sell more trucks  G

926558,Canuck2fan,2015-07-29 00:31:00,1444,"Since the government minister responsible here didn't get a ""memo"" from the U.S. or her own department yet no one knows what will happen. LOL How typical....  That being said the terms of buybacks aren't clear in the U.S. yet either, with the exception that it will be purchase price each customer paid minus depreciation. That depreciation rider is very important because as more trucks get bought out it will DRIVE the value of all them down farther. Thus lessening the cost of the total recall/buyback for the company.  The customer will lose even more as they have to eat the accelerated depreciation. If they take a sweetheart deal on a new Ram, they will get to eat higher depreciation on the new truck. The used market will be flooded with ""FIXED"" late model trucks already depreciated to a higher degree than the competition. I predict this will mean the market ""value"" of all Rams are going to have to less than they would have been, for a few years."
926647,Canuck2fan,2015-07-29 17:04:00,1444,"Good article answering 7 questions about the buyback part of the recall.... It isn't all 500,000 vehicles that are even eligible it is only the ones who have one 3 recalls that have not been fixed yet. The new estimate is it only 200,000 vehicles that will eligible for the buyback.  Interestingly, out of the 37 page agreement that FCA signed only a half a page was about the recall yet it is getting all the hoopla LOL. Typical media these days. It is better to be first than right about a story.
