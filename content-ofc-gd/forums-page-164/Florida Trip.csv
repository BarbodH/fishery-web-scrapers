After an awesome time down in Florida I figured I oughta share some of the highlights. Went down to ICAST for work and ended up fishing the FLW ICAST Cup charity tournament. It was a 3 hour event where industry people were paired with a pro and a media rep. Our media rep was a no show but had an awesome time on the water with Edwin Rivera. We boated a ton of largies and ended up placing 4th out of 60+ boats. It was a riot fishing with this guy – we were laughing the entire time.            After ICAST in Orlando we shot down to Miami to fish with a well know captain we met at the show. Fishing was slow but my boss boated some nice Snook.              The next day we ran up to Tampa to fish with a close friend and captain and landed a ton of smaller snook and I got a couple nice Redfish.        Overall we had an awesome time down there and packed a ton of work and fishing into a really short period of time!"
