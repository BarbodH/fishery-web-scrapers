927524,Joey,2015-08-03 20:23:00,9122,"Well our much anticipated trip up to Mashkinonje Lodge was last week and we had looked forward to it for quite some time.  There was to be Paul, myself, my son Alan, Roy, J and Art and Joe.  Unfortunately, Roy and J had to cancel last minute and they were dearly missed.  We made the best of it though and enjoyed Art and Joe's company and even had two visits with TJ and Monique.  It was HOT!!!!!  We arrived Saturday afternoon and did the fun unloading stuff and sat around and enjoyed the scenery that afternoon and night.  Met some nice people in the cabin beside us who, as it turns out, are also from Richmond Hill and I could walk to their house it is so close.  They had a small dog that Ralphie just loved, I think because it was smaller than him.  We made fast friends with them and they want us to go up the same time they do next year.  Our first sunset Saturday night.  IMG_1342 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Sunday we fished until we could not take the heat anymore and we knew Art and Joe were arriving so we headed back in sometime in the afternoon.  They had just arrived so we gave them their space to unpack and settle in.  I did a bit of bird photography in the trees out front.  IMG_1523 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1553 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1572 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1573 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   We filtered try again please chatted with Art and Joe for a bit and then Paul and I headed out for some pickerel fishing.  I managed to lose a nice one right off the bat, then finally got a decent one, but it was under slot, which is 18"" now.  Back she went.  Paul caught a smaller one aswell and also got a perch.  I didn't bother with pics.  The eagle came by to visit and I tried my hardest at some half decent pics, but it was dusk so they didn't turn out the greatest.  Mosquitos came out at 9:30 p.m. sharp each night.   IMG_1874 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1908 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   The next morning I let the boys go while I stayed back and tried to keep cool in the shade.  They managed a few pike, which we were told to keep for the pike fry Goldie and Regan were having on Thursday.   I went out the next day with Paul and found a beautiful family of loons.

IMG_2109 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_2157 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Ralphie Chillin in the boat   IMG_3626 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Trolling, did I mention it was HOT??  IMG_3630 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   We got a bit of a rain storm and Paul refused to come in out of the rain  IMG_3638 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Tuesday we were invited to TJ and Moniques for dinner and a swim.  What a nice relief from the HEAT!   But it was even nicer to see them again.  TJ did chicken on the open fire on a spit and Monique threw a feast of baby potatoes, roasted portabello mushroom and bi color green beans.   It was delish.  We then cooled off in the pool and had a blast, then we did some raspberry picking.  What a great day.  I didn't even get the camera out we were too busy chatting, eating and swimming.  Good times!!  Wednesday we caught a few pike, but had not musky follows    We kept them for the pike fry if they were big enough.  Thursday they prepared for the fish fry and decided they were going to burn the old chairs that were rickety and falling apart.  Prepping for the burn!   IMG_3643 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   The fish fry underway   IMG_3656 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   We invited TJ and Monique up to join us and also Leslie from Lakair.  We sure had alot of laughs!!   IMG_3659 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3673 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3686 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3681 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   The burning of the chair   IMG_3663 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3689 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Friday a storm rolled in, actually we got 3 in total.  Some really good rippers that flipped things over and smashed a glass table.  But it finally cooled things off a bit, whew!!!  IMG_3713 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Good timing on this shot  :)   IMG_3732 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3747 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3775 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   The Ralphster  IMG_3785 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr    The storms led to some interesting and gorgeous sunset pics.   IMG_3825 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3838 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3846 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3863 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3869 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_3920 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr     Anyhow, sorry for the no fish pics.  We had a great time, the fish fry was delish and everyone contributed, the company was awesome and we had so many laughs it was crazy.  Looking forward to going back up again soon.  Also, on a funny note, a gentleman came walking by me and said ""Is that Ralphie from the OFC?""   I laughed.  He said his son and he, from Ohio, read the board all the time and recognized Ralphie and complimented me on my photography  .  We ended up making friends with him and his family.  So no musky, a few pike, a few pickerel and a perch but worth every minute of it just being up there.  Thanks Goldie and Regan for the great service and fish fry and Thanks TJ and Monique for the wonderful dinner and entertainment.  Great to see Art and Joe again  Cheers,  Joey       "
927527,lew,2015-08-03 20:37:00,12766,Been waiting for your post Joey and good to hear everything went well. We were wondering if you guys were getting that crazy heat wave up there.  Did you get out the Muskrats & Aikenheads and how was the cabbage ??  Diane and I are heading to Memquisit on Saturday for 2 weeks so hopefully the weeds are where they should be.  Been watching the full moon the last couple days and was wishing I was up there now.
927529,John,2015-08-03 20:44:00,2956,Great report Joey and of course great photo's as always! Sorry we couldn't be there. Glad we got the opportunity to say hi to the Virginia boyz on their pit stop in Hamilton........thanks Spiel!
927530,Joey,2015-08-03 20:46:00,9122,"Thanks Lew, we made it to Muskrat every day, but not Aikenheads.  The cabbage is very low.  It is green and healthy but no higher than 5 feet at most and non existent in alot of places.  The water was very murky for the first few days and then started to clear up a bit.  Yes, we got the heatwave and let me tell you getting off the water because you are too hot and coming back to a hot cabin is not fun.  Swimming was a nice relief though and Ralphie got a few more swimming lessons.  He's doing great with it now  Good luck up there bud!"
927532,Joey,2015-08-03 20:46:00,9122,"Great report Joey and of course great photo's as always! Sorry we couldn't be there. Glad we got the opportunity to say hi to the Virginia boyz on their pit stop in Hamilton........thanks Spiel!   Yes, we missed you John and Babwa"

927537,Fisherman,2015-08-03 21:29:00,7201,"Ahem,  looks like TJ's getting a handful there.  Nice photo shoot."
927539,Rich Clemens,2015-08-03 21:34:00,3131,"I'll bet if fish could fly like the birds of the air, we might have some pictures.   LOL.   Sure wish we could have made the trip as well, but just not in the cards.   I think we had more fun just sitting around shooting  the breeze in June than we did fishing."
927541,lew,2015-08-03 21:43:00,12766,I think we had more fun just sitting around shooting the breeze in June than we did fishing.  And early morning coffee's LOL

927573,Roy,2015-08-04 00:23:00,13728,"Another great report, Joey. Just SO sorry we couldn't make it up there but you know the reason. Hopefully we can get together soon.
