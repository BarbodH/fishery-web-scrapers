925275,tomkat,2015-07-19 14:07:00,246,Looking for a good rain suit recommendations. Light breathable and durable . If you have one you love let me know about it. Thanks
925284,porkpie,2015-07-19 15:45:00,2521,"I bought a bps pro light jacket last year, so far very impressed.  I also have bps pro qualifier gore tex bibs that are 10 years old and still keep me dry."
925286,KraTToR,2015-07-19 16:03:00,506,"Picked up a Frabill F Series (F2) last season and I really like it.  From Le Baron I believe. It comes in 4 different weights (F1 to F4). You purchase the jacket and bib overall bottoms separately.  I really like the bibs as they are warm, dry, and have reinforced knees."
925308,67ZL1,2015-07-19 19:26:00,51,Anything with Goretex is good quality. With Fall coming up there should be some sales popping up at Cabela's and BPS. Cream of the crop would be Simms Pro Dry. I have the Simms and can vouch for it's quality. Light and breathable. I also have and use Frabil FXE and like it too. I tend to wear the Frabil when it's cooler out as it's a heavier outfit.
925319,big guy,2015-07-19 20:39:00,414,"Check the Frogg Toggs suits they sell at Bass Pro. Extremely lightweight, you barely know you are wearing them, it really is incredible, very waterproof, I have sat in a downpour for over an hour and was dry as a bone and not sweating as they are much more breathable than Gore Tex. The price is certainly much cheaper too. The suit I have I picked up for $35 a few years back, on sale and I have never had a better rain suit in my life and love the price compared to other suits.  http://www.basspro.com/Brand-Frogg-Toggs/_/N-1z0xe6u?catalogId=10051&langId=-1&storeId=10151"
925323,Lape0019,2015-07-19 21:09:00,647,67zl1 has the right idea. I have a 100moh jacket and am very satisfied with it. Spend the money once and buy something good instead of buying a new set every year. It is an investment.
925330,jtracc,2015-07-19 23:53:00,97,"For light weight warmer weather look at the frog togs, they are decent price and will keep you dry.  For the cooler months I have a bps 100 mph suit, very well built and work great.  I had the old suit for 10 yrs and still keep me bone dry.  I also have the newest style which are even better.  Simms are nice but if you don't feel like spending $1100 look at the 100 mph suit."
925336,Fisherpete,2015-07-20 00:47:00,1814,BPS pro qualifier set has been great. Look for when it goes on sale.
925338,67ZL1,2015-07-20 00:57:00,51,@ jtracc you are right. I should have elaborated on what I posted. The Simms is way over the top for your average angler. I fish walleye tournaments and am in really nasty weather more times than not. The BPS and Cabela's suits would be more than adequate for the average angler. In fact I see a lot of pro' s wearing the same suits. Just keep your eyes open for a sale on what ever you decide to purchase.
925342,Hooked,2015-07-20 01:07:00,891,Does anyone know if the Frogg Toggs are available in-store for Canadian BPS's?
925349,can u fish,2015-07-20 01:41:00,326,I have the BPS pro qualifier goretex and it is worth every penny in my opinion.
925354,NANUK,2015-07-20 02:08:00,797,"Very happy with Cabela's Guidewear GoreTex bibs and parka, it has kept me completely dry in some real nasty weather."
925355,Lunkerhunter,2015-07-20 02:34:00,455,I have owned a bps pro qualifier suit and have to say I prefer the cabelas guide wear over the bps suit. I also have a frabill f4 suit but have only wore it a couple of times so can't say how it stands up over time. The Cabelas suit I have had for 3 years now and still very good. Holding up better than the bps one did
925364,wormdunker,2015-07-20 06:53:00,1711,"I have a BPS light weight suit for warmer weather.  It's awesome!  It rolls up into a very small package no bigger than a cigarette carton.  1 for the jacket, 1 for the pants.  I don't know the price tag - it was a gift."
925398,glen,2015-07-20 12:39:00,2641,I got frog toggs from bps about four years ago.  Pack able and stored on my boat.
925524,Craigson,2015-07-21 12:04:00,117,"If u live near an Acklands Grainger they have Goretex jackets on for $99, regular $340. Limited quantities though.  You can also buy decent light weight gear at Canadisn tire for $40-50."
925556,Canuck2fan,2015-07-21 16:22:00,1444,"Still waiting for any breathable rain suit that keeps me dry when I am sitting on the pier in my foldable chair... The rain pools on the back and seat of the chair and I eventually end up wet in any of the 6 different kinds of breathable suits I have...  Frogg Toggs though is by far the best for breathability and keeping dry the longest. I got mine off of their factory outlet store on ebay for about 36.00 bucks delivered. I used it so much the ""paper"" it is made out of frayed so bad I am embarrassed to wear it. It is still more waterproof than my dickies, coleman and two kinds of cheapie Bass Pro camo rain gear though.  I guess I should have ponied up the money for Gore Tex from the beginning although no one will confirm it stays dry when you are sitting in a puddle on your chair LOL.  I swear every year in the winter when I don't get out much, I will go and put a couple of riveted grommets in the seat of my chair, so the water can drain out... Then fishing gets in the way and I don't get it done, and the first rain storm I get soaked.. LOL."
925726,James77,2015-07-22 15:28:00,175,I got a stormtech recently and it's been great!  James
