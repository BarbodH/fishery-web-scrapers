926584,captpierre,2015-07-29 11:20:00,2521,Holy moly ?
926585,Gallie,2015-07-29 11:34:00,1215,"Scary stuff, the odds of keeping them out dont look good at all."
926621,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-29 14:14:00,4399,especially when people keep trying to bring them in....bigger fines and jail time might help fix the problem!!!
926634,dave524,2015-07-29 15:10:00,4508,"These are grass carp , not quite as scary as the silver carp that you see exploding out of the water when a speed boat passes, none the less not a good thing."
926654,Acountdeleted,2015-07-29 18:14:00,2562,IN Tommy Thompson Park?!?! That's very not good. I know the ponds they speak of to. It would not be overly difficult for those fish to get to the mainland.
926660,mike rousseau,2015-07-29 18:39:00,4661,They've been here for a long time... Like stated above they aren't the ones on YouTube jumping like crazy...  They are am rare around here tho
926687,wkimwes,2015-07-29 21:36:00,76,That's a scare for a second.  Still not good.
926688,2 tone z71,2015-07-29 21:49:00,1311,The musky will take them out lol
926689,lew,2015-07-29 21:53:00,12766,The musky will take them out lol  And get nice and fat while their doing it LOL
926690,davey buoy,2015-07-29 22:01:00,5505,"This Asian carp thing/barricade,I know different,but I think some must have made it in?.I sure hope not,jmo as always,but thinking any thing man made,usually does not stand the test of time.Clock is ticking."
926693,misfish,2015-07-29 22:31:00,29133,"Ok so they are here.  Can they be table fare? Not for I, but some might just like them. Smoked, baked, pickled.  Trying to think positive here."
926700,ketchenany,2015-07-29 23:38:00,3229,You'll need a bigger toon!
926851,dsn,2015-07-30 23:25:00,1018,Saw that report on the news. I'm sure all the carp addicts will swarm the local area to haul them out. I would. My gear needs to be dusted off tho.
926859,Acountdeleted,2015-07-30 23:56:00,2562,There might be none left. My buddy netted this one (didn't even get his name in the paper) and they have every inch of the ponds strung up with nets.

926878,Acountdeleted,2015-07-31 02:19:00,2562,It was cell 2 but they have recently blocked sections off to make marshes (stupid idea if you ask me). The carp were found in one of these land locked areas thank goodness.
926887,PUMP KNOWS,2015-07-31 02:33:00,937,^^^ Do you know if both were found in the locked cells?  My friend was the one who spotted them in lake ontario and were a lot bigger then the ones they captured.
926891,John Bacon,2015-07-31 02:50:00,3277,"It was cell 2 but they have recently blocked sections off to make marshes (stupid idea if you ask me). The carp were found in one of these land locked areas thank goodness.  They are 'capping' the highly contaminated sediment with clay to isolate the contaminents.  Once this is complete they will create a marsh on top of the clay cap.  This process has been completed for cell 1 and is expected to be completed for cell 2 in the next few years.  This will eventually be done for cell 3 as well; but that is a long way off.  As far a I know, the intent is to retain the access to these wetlands from the lake so that they can serve as spawning habitat for the fish.  If it is land locked, it is probably just temporary while they complete the work."
926919,Acountdeleted,2015-07-31 13:24:00,2562,It is just temporary. And I do know for a fact that both carp were found in the land locked area of cell 2. Thank goodness.
926929,Sterling,2015-07-31 14:28:00,477,"It's only a matter of time before these make their way into the great lakes, if they haven't already. Hopefully there is some sort of biological mechanism that keeps their population down. Otherwise we could see the best fishery in the world ruined."
