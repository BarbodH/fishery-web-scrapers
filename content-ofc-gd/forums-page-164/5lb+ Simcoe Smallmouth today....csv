926705,Slayingm,2015-07-30 00:33:00,204,I had a guide trip on lake Simcoe today and man was it a hot one out there... especially with hardly any wind.  That did not seem to bother the big smallies as they were cruising on all my spots I hit today.  At one point we had 4 big smallies cruising under the shade of the boat!  We got some real giants today and the key to getting them to hit was really long casts away from the boat as the big fish spook and will not hit near the boat.  Here is a sample of the kind of tanks that hit today!    Be safe and Good Fish'n.... Greg.

It was hot. When we docked some one said it was too hot to fish. I pointed at US Steel plant across the creek and said "" now that's hot."""
