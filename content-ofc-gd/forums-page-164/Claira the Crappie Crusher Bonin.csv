926604,The Urban Fisherman,2015-07-29 13:09:00,2050,"Hey guys,  A quick photo report.  This summer has been crazy busy but I promised each one of my kids a solo trip in the boat.  Last night a window opened up and I was able to take my youngest out for her turn with Dad.  On our way out to the lake we picked up some minnows from my wife's cousins who own Erie Bait & Tackle and am I ever glad we did.  I don't often use live bait but they were ALL OVER Claira's minnows last night.  I managed 1 fish for 2 casts and Claira fought it for me. lol I was to busy putting minnows on her hook every two seconds.  I'm pretty sure she lost 3 minnows for every landed fish.. Hard to get a good hookset in with her ice fishing rod. haha It's all good though because she had a blast.  I think it's time to graduate to a bigger rod.  First cast, she hammers her personal best Rock Bass ( big deal when you're 4 ) haha.    After that she crushed the crappie one after another and wouldn't you know it she catches her personal best crappie several times over!  That's how she got her new nickname ""Claira the Crappie Crusher"" or ""Tripple C"". lol          There were some little largies mixed in as well...      Don't worry about the net Dad - I'll just pump him in!!!    Okay... GET THE NET for this one!!!      Personal best Crappie... and he's heavy...    Crack off one more and then let's go for a swim...        Okay Kid.... time to go because Mom will be texting me to get home.. not you! haha  One more cast on our way in Dad.... Ok.  BOOM.   Personal best Largemouth..    Stretch those arms out and make him look extra big! lol    A night I will remember for the rest of my life.  Have a great week folks.  Ryan & Tripple C"
926606,Musky or Specks,2015-07-29 13:20:00,2710,Personal favourite place to swim in SW Ontario. I just wish they had better camping sites. Congrats to C-Cubed on all her PB's.
926607,BillM,2015-07-29 13:20:00,17367,GoPro or 10-22mm?    Great pics!
926610,The Urban Fisherman,2015-07-29 13:28:00,2050,"Personal favourite place to swim in SW Ontario. I just wish they had better camping sites. Congrats to C-Cubed on all her PB's.  You know I agree with you on the swimming and fishing brother.  The camping sites aren't stellar but the lake makes up for it.  I love the people who run the park, and don't spent a ton of  time on my site anyways when we do camp out.  I find most campsites to be very similar in southern ontario...  GoPro or 10-22mm?    Great pics!  Thanks bud! 11-16 Tokina adapted onto a Micro 4/3 camera ( GH4 ).  I mainly use it for video but it does a fine job of taking stills on our fishing trips as well.  One way to easily tell the difference between GoPro and a DSLR style camera is that the GoPro has a wide depth of field... so everything is always in focus, foreground and background."
926611,Musky or Specks,2015-07-29 13:35:00,2710,If they had some rental sites back where the group camping is I'd probably be there all the time but camping right beside the road is not my bag
926612,porkpie,2015-07-29 13:38:00,2521,"Great fishing.  I fish with my kids a LOT, and while I usually put a rod down for myself, somehow it always seems I am I missed in the rotation LOL, funny how that works."
926616,Walleye72,2015-07-29 13:45:00,156,"Fantastic pics.  Looks like lots of fun was had.  If you don't mind, can I ask where you were?  Where is this campground you and Musky are speaking of?"
926617,Musky or Specks,2015-07-29 13:53:00,2710,Same place we hold the fishing for Tyler event at.
926637,highdrifter,2015-07-29 15:28:00,2534,Ryan I always look forward to your posts... Makes me ponder the day when my boy will be able to join me and catch his personal best also.  Way to go Dad!!  cheers HD

927154,The Urban Fisherman,2015-08-01 19:37:00,2050,"Hey gang! I just wanted to take a second to thank you all SO VERY MUCH for the kind words. I wanted to reply to everyone individually but I'm overwhelmed with things around the office, home and with the Fish-A-Thon around the corner. But I didn't want to just let this thread die without at least thanking everyone. You're all friends, and brothers to me and I can't thank you enough for the words.  Hope you all have an awesome long weekend! Cheers,Ryan"
