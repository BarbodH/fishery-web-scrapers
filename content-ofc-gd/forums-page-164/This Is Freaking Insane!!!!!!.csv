927612,SuperDave,2015-08-04 12:31:00,204,Nothing like ruining some pristine settings with a noisy dirt bike lol. Very cool footage though.
927617,dave524,2015-08-04 12:58:00,4508,Bet it don't troll down very well
927620,KraTToR,2015-08-04 13:13:00,506,"Very cool, sent the link to all my moto-cross buddies..  Pretty hard to recover from a wipe-out tho...  eek!"
927622,bobkayla,2015-08-04 13:17:00,148,Never had nothing like that when I raced

927640,Joeytier,2015-08-04 15:33:00,3990,"How exactly is he screwing up his surroundings?  Lol  Very cool technology, I would have to have lots of confidence in my bike not to break down running miles off shore like that"
927646,Fisherman,2015-08-04 15:58:00,7201,"Driving down riverbeds is illegal in most areas, don't know why you seem to think that roto tilling everything is okay"
927650,leaf4,2015-08-04 16:09:00,2466,Very cool. I wonder if it has an auto inflate pfd setup? Imagine dumping that in the middle of a lake and the environmental aspect of oil/fuel etc would not be good!
927658,mepps,2015-08-04 16:23:00,1301,"wow, I'm gonna need bigger hooks on my lures to get a hold of that guy!"
927671,Joeytier,2015-08-04 17:03:00,3990,"Didn't see anyone driving up riverbeds (didn't watch the whole thing).  That can be done with a million other toys, including ones that you probably own.  Doesn't discount that this is a very cool gadget."
927676,Fisherman,2015-08-04 17:21:00,7201,"Yes, I do own an ATV, however river/creek riding is verboten.  Had an incident a while back where they caught a bunch going up/down the Mad river,  MNR caught wind of that cuz the dumb butts posted it.  Major can of whoop exploded."
927729,FloatnFly,2015-08-04 20:36:00,1640,"people run open water on snowmobiles all the time, hell, people drive their vehicles out on to the frozen lakes taking a chance it may break through, litter the river banks with endless garbage, pollute our local lakes with oil and gas from leaky outboards and rape our natural resources like they are renewable.   and you're worried about one guy on a dirt bike in a foreign country?"
927733,misfish,2015-08-04 21:14:00,29133,"Yes, I do own an ATV, however river/creek riding is verboten.  Had an incident a while back where they caught a bunch going up/down the Mad river,  MNR caught wind of that cuz the dumb butts posted it.  Major can of whoop exploded.  Yup what he says is true. One area is closed right off now.Even after being posted, mis use it and lose it.  I cant even fish it anymore."
