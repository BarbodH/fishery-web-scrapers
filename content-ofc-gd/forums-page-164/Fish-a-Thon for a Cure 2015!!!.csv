We're only a few weeks away and have had a tremendous show of support from our sponsors such as Laurie from Dixie Dairy Bar & Tackle Shop in St. Thomas, Sarah & Dave Mercer, Handlebarz, Spiel Custom Rods, and many more. Right now we're sitting below average with regards to registration numbers so PLEASE pass this around and encourage people to take part in Fish-A-Thon 2015. We have some amazing early bird prizes lined up for those who get going on pledges! Registration is done online @ www.fish-a-thon.comLets all rally together and do our part to support the fight against Cancer. Together we can make a difference. Let's show the world what the angling community is all about!  I'm leaving on a work trip this afternoon, until the middle of the week but will add more details when I'm home!  Thanks again for the ongoing support OFC!    Cheers, Ryan & Crew"
