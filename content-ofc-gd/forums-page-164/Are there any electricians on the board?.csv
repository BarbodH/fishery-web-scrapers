Something that I could plug a 30 Amp RV cable into and it would have 2 or 3 standard 15 amp receptacles.  I use a large kitchen tent over a picnic table to house my stove, cooler, and supplies so something small that I could put on a shelf would be ideal.  Of course everything would be rated for outdoor use.  Here is an idea of what I'm thinking about although this example is a bit too large.   "
