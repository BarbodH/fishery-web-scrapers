926342,Walleye72,2015-07-27 16:59:00,156,That's really great news that it's not more serious.  I was surprised that so many people were sure it was a write off.  Now you'll get to enjoy your holiday with your own boat.
926350,davey buoy,2015-07-27 19:10:00,5505,"I thought seized all along,oil pump/injector not working right. $200, is a steal compared what we all thought it may be. Good for you ,on again by the weekend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
926354,jimmer,2015-07-27 19:42:00,2730,That was good news for sure. It's always scary bringing in an outboard for repairs. Have fun on the holidays.
926356,2 tone z71,2015-07-27 20:38:00,1311,Dara how many hrs on it ? Bearing on top of gear case or bottom of power head ?
926357,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-27 20:50:00,540,Glad to hear its nothing major!
926791,Dara,2015-07-30 16:34:00,3052,"Bearing in bottom...I was low on bottom end lube for some reason. I filled it in the fall but possibly didn't get enough in. I will watch that more carefully from now on. So, bearing, seals, impeller because it was apart anyway, and a new prop because I was getting bad cavitation gouges in the old one so may as well, total $550.00 plus taxes..lesson learned I guess but its back to me in less than a week and I can go on vacation  Thanks to Blind river boat works...gotta give em a plug  and thanks for the well wishes on here guys"
926792,irishfield,2015-07-30 16:50:00,26272,Down here that would have been 2 grand and you might have seen your engine back in January. Glad it work out Dara!
926798,lew,2015-07-30 17:20:00,12766,Always good when you get a smaller bill than expected.

926017,Dara,2015-07-24 14:57:00,3052,"what happened to my motor  Wind was calm last night so I went fishing with the wife.  A few miles down the lake, tried the first spot, nothing, move to the next. Just getting up on plane and a heckofaracketgrinding noise and the motor shuts down  2010 60hp yamaha  Take it out of gear...turn the key, starter wants to turn but won't.  Tilt up, nothing there...was in 40 plus feet of water.  Electric trolling motor back, luckily a marina was close by to pull into and get a ride to my truck and trailer.  Out of the water and turn the prop in neutral..spins fine...put it in gear and try to turn it and it will not budge at all..stuck right tight, can't even fight motor compression.  Its at the dealer now...lets see what the verdict is     edited to say, yeah, smart ass remarks are welcome except i am on vacation Aug 1st for a week and I need a motor working one way or the other"
926018,BillM,2015-07-24 15:07:00,17367,I would guess a connecting rod has jammed up the crank.
926019,FloatnFly,2015-07-24 15:16:00,1640,piston or gears is my guess
926021,DanD,2015-07-24 15:59:00,2223,Time to borrow a buddies boat; nothing in or for marine gets fixed in a week. Sorry to hear about your luck; but bad luck always seems to happen at the worst of times. Hope they get it sorted for you.  Dan.
926022,glen,2015-07-24 16:03:00,2641,Wish I could say you blew a seal but you broke a rod.  Good advice from Dan.
926029,davew3,2015-07-24 16:55:00,430,"Dara,  2 cycle or 4?   Any particular smell ?  Did you pull the cover and see any discoloration?   I am thinking piston seized.   As it took a while to shut down.  If something broke catastrophically it would have been much quicker to stop.  I hope all works out for you.  Regards"

926040,Dara,2015-07-24 18:13:00,3052,"It actually stopped pretty quick Dave. I did take the cover off but it all looks brand new in there. It had oil and bottom end lube...I do that stuff myself and checked it after and fluids were good  Its a 4 stroke fuel injected.  Dealer said they were busy today but would be looking at it Monday latest...one of the good things about living in a lightly populated area.  I'm now remembering that it had a little tick when on high idle...something I meant to get looked at but the dealer is 1 1/2 hours away so it kinda got ignored.  I'm starting to think I broke a valve  Or, Gremlins"
926042,John Bacon,2015-07-24 19:06:00,3277,"Wish I could say you blew a seal but you broke a rod.  Good advice from Dan.  That was probably just ice cream  I hope it nothing too serious.  Unfortunatley, that does not sound like the case."
926049,Big Cliff,2015-07-24 20:41:00,6899,Dropped a valve would be my guess.
926054,misfish,2015-07-24 21:46:00,29133,"If I had to guess, and it,s just a guess mine ya, it broke."
926055,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-24 21:52:00,8243,"I don't know what is definitely is but I can feel your pain. It could only happen a week before vacation. I was ready to sell or give away my boat this morning when we pull up to the ramp and my motor won't tilt. Only a bad battery so I count my lucky charms. I t could be worse my friend. As someone once told me ""at least you have a boat to fix""."
926062,Dara,2015-07-24 22:36:00,3052,"Time to borrow a buddies boat; nothing in or for marine gets fixed in a week. Sorry to hear about your luck; but bad luck always seems to happen at the worst of times. Hope they get it sorted for you.  Dan.

926067,spincast,2015-07-24 23:03:00,3279,closer to $600 than $200 ? you have my sympathies. On the bright side - your trolling motor battery was fully charged
926080,2 tone z71,2015-07-25 01:01:00,1311,prob snapped the crank...did the same to my 04 60 ...sorry it sucks ..when a 4 Smoker lets go internally there's not a lot left
926206,Mister G,2015-07-26 09:13:00,1429,"Time to go outboard motor shopping......maybe this time try a E-Tech.......you will be surprised how quite they run and better power, gas mileage and no smoke whatsoever.  Good Luck with the old one and maybe I'm wrong and it will be something that's not expensive and a quick fix."
926209,ecmilley,2015-07-26 10:47:00,2163,"i know that sound just had my hemi do it, sorry sounds like a new power head is in order, usually a clanking noise then seizing is a rod big end let go, it happens and usually not much worth saving after that"
926211,Fish Farmer,2015-07-26 10:57:00,2234,"Timing belt slipped or gone, motor toast.  Hope thats not your case. I though about a Etech, have 3 buds that have blown theirs. glad I had second thoughts. 4 strokes have their problems to I guess, got to keep them maintained."
926237,Gregoire,2015-07-26 15:15:00,1397,sounds like a johnson rod to me...

926307,hutch4113,2015-07-27 12:52:00,374,Ouch...hope you get it fixed in time.

926332,Raf,2015-07-27 15:46:00,3495,glad that's all it was.. dodged one for sure.  i have a 2010 yammy as well and I would have a crap if it crapped.
926333,Dara,2015-07-27 15:49:00,3052,And I'm getting them to have a listen to that tick it has too...it was wayyyy too scary
