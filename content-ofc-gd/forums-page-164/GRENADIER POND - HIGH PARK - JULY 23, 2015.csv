926868,Rizzo,2015-07-31 01:02:00,4754,good for you! As a kid in Toronto I remember heading down there. don't think I ever got bass tho...just panfish and the odd giant carp
926905,craigdritchie,2015-07-31 12:26:00,1586,"Ha! Thanks for the trip down memory lane. As a kid Icaught a lot of bass there, and in some of the same spots too. Back in the 70s there were a lot of white perch in there, plus some decent bluegills and crappie. It's great to see it's still an enjoyable place to fish."
