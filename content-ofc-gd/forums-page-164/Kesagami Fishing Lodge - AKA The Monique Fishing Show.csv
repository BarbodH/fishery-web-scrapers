926787,TJQ,2015-07-30 15:49:00,7806,great report Sir!  What was the local's thoughts on the solar farm?  That is one of my 10MW projects.  I didnt speak to many locals.. although the motels were CRAMMED with workers!
926888,Steve,2015-07-31 02:34:00,2075,"well, that is a good thing...stimulus to the local economy.  however, with all things considered, once they are built and running, the work force reduced 90%....so not many long term jobs...  but while under construction, great stimulus to the local economy....and depending on the municipal tax structure, it can also be a good tax generator."
926892,TennesseeGuy,2015-07-31 02:55:00,957,"Great trip, especially good with the whole family going at it.  Makes me want to go fishing.   Pretty sure I was wanting to go fishing before I read your report.  What happens when those solar farms suck all the warm from the sun?"
926920,LeXXington,2015-07-31 13:26:00,1928,Nice going Boss!!  Good to see the family fishing together 
925119,TJQ,2015-07-17 18:23:00,7806,"With both kids working at Kesagami Wilderness Lodge this year we thought it would be a good year to go up and take a 4 night trip in, see the kids and brush up on our walleye jigging and pike casting (uhhgg)First off I left booking a room in Cochrane till about a week before, after all.. how hard can getting a room in Cochrane be??  We've had some crappy experiences at no name hotels, so up there we've always booked at the best western, its not cheap, but its a really nice place.  Unbeknownst to us, there was a HUGE wedding there the night we needed AND a ton of construction workers in town working on a very large solar farm!  After going through 4 hotels we were finally able to get a room at the Thriftlodge (This info is for other travellers..  The room was more than adequate, and there is a Steakhouse right next door.  I was happy that the difference in price between the Best Western and the Thriftlodge actually paid for a nice dinner and drinks!)The next morning we headed to the airbase, and were surprised to hear that there were enough patrons going into the lodge that we would be using the Otter instead of the usual Beaver.  Here us in front of it. I have to say... smoothest flight in ever!  And we did get a picture or two of the solar farm itself!Once in we were greeted by the kids and what was probably the best part of the whole trip... served breakfast by our daughter... lol...  We were on the water for the first day by 10:00 and headed off to out favorite spot to make sure we had enough walleye (pickeral) for shore lunch.. which turned out to be pretty easy. Monique, as always outfished me for most of the trip, but I think its cause I was usually busy getting fish off her rod!  (Get ready for the ""Monique caught all the fish show... dammit!)Our favorite spot for lunch was taken so we ventured to a spot we had never been to before and made our lunch, Onions and fish over the open fire.  Delicious as always.The next day we got an early start and boy what a day we had.  Pickeral were easy to catch for lunch, and our favorite spot (propane and tables) was open so we made fish and beans.  The day just got nicer and nicer and by the time we got back to camp, we had put well over 100 fish in the boat, it was one of those days where you couldn't do anything wrong, by mid afternoon, we were just trolling shorelines and picking up a pike or pickeral on our spoons every 5 min, anywhere we went, they were on.  I even had a pike come to the side of the boat and hit my spoon when it was hanging over the side of the boat while I removed a fish from Monique's line!  When we got back to the lodge we found that they were on for everyone, everybody caught a mess of fish that day.  I have to say its probably the best day of fishing I have ever had.The next day was our day with the kids, they were able to switch their shifts around and were able to come out for the day.  We were so excited.  But overnight the temps went to 6 degrees and this massive cold front rolls through, fog, cold north wind and 4 foot rollers. We weren't impressed, this was after all gonna be family day.  But like every good Dad,  I endeavor to my my family's life an ""adventure"" (Jaden would insert the work miserable in there LOL) and we bundled up and headed out into some pretty miserable weather.  The boats up there are perfect for that lake, but the wind and spray had us soaking wet by the time we got to our spot, and after no luck fishing (I new it would be hard after the front) we decided to find a wood stove at the lodge and dry out.This picture doesn't do the weather justice.We had a nice sandwich and headed out again this time down the MUCH calmer river to find a small lake called 5 Mile Lake (Im assuming its cause it was five miles away, cause Monique and I had never been that far down the river.  It was a long boat ride and Jaden found a way to have a nap!We found what we thought was the inlet to it, which turned out to be just a stream but as we were trolling down it, bam.. we got on to 7 pike in about 20 min.  The contest between mom and son was on!!  Turning the boat around in there was fun but we got out and found the river we were looking for and got to the lake, it was not so small and pretty choppy... we stayed out of the wind as best we could and found the waterway dumping into the lake, which we trolled up.  In one bend of the stream we caught 4 nice pickeral on our spoons, perfect size for eating, Monique and Avery got two of them on at the same time! We decided to stop at the shorelunch spot and have a bit of a break and some pickeral!Then back to the lodge for a late steak dinner, a drink or two and BED!  We were exhausted!  But I have to say, throwing a little adversity into the day made it all the better.  We had a lot of family laughs and some great conversations!The next day was to be our day with our guide Jake.  When we are looking for pike we like to have a guide as they are usually pretty familiar with where the best spots are in the lake at what time.  Unlike the walleye whose spots we are well aware of, the pike move around during the summer depending on water temp and weed cover.  The first order of business was to get our lunch and after the cold front we figured this might be tough, but after the sun came out, we found a spot and must have pulled 30 or so out including a 22 and 25 incher.  Of all the fish i think there was only one under 16 inches, they were all hogs and it was tons of fun.At the shore lunch spot, I wasn't sure if I could get another pickeral dinner in me, but to my surprise, Jake put together what I have to say was some of the best fish I have ever ate in my life, and I consider myself to be a shore lunch aficionado!.. I ate more fish than I had any day previous and we left the spot stuffed. - AND now I know his secret!!  (It was really nice to sit back and let someone else drive the boat!)We headed over to to Jakes favourite casting spot.  Now Monique and I are traditionally trollers, ie to lazy to cast, but up here, if you want the nice pike ya gotta go casting so, in the right wind we started drifting down the side of this 300m section of pencil weeds, and all three of us were using black buzzbaits, specifically these ones (I think they are the Cavitrons??)  Over the afternoon we drifted that shore 12 times and EVERY time we at least had a nice boil and hit in the weeds. 3 or four hit right at the boat and we had ANOTHER one hit Moniques lure while her rod was at rest and the lure dangling in the water...  TWICE in one trip WOW.  We managed to hook three decent pike in there, but I think we were a bit inexperienced in setting the hook using those baits and although the fish tried to latch on, it was usually our over enthusiasm at setting the hook that undid us. lol.  Two things I did take away from that how ever, was this that we spoke to another guide who fished that spot that morning for an hour while we were pickeral fishing and didn't even get one bite, AND the biggest one we saw, was sitting in a spot that I know we had ALL casted to at least 6 times.Back to the Lodge we went very tired and very happy for another wonderful day.On Thursday we flew back out and headed home.  It was a wonderful trip, leaving me wholly anticipating when we can next make a visit.It was a wonderful time, as always the Manager, Charlie as well as all the rest of the staff go out of their way to make sure your stay is as pleasant as possible. We will be Visiting Kesagami AGAIN!"
925120,Rich Clemens,2015-07-17 18:37:00,3131,Awesome country up there TJ.   Would love to make a visit some day.
925122,bigcreekdad,2015-07-17 18:39:00,546,nice report....thanks
925123,AKRISONER,2015-07-17 18:44:00,5558,i love reading about what lakes used to be like prior to us humans ruining everything. These fishing trips are like shooting fish in a barrel. Imagine when the kawarthas and great lakes were like this.  Great report.
925132,aplumma,2015-07-17 20:15:00,6896,Excellent adventure i am glad not only you got on the fish but you got to see the kids.   Art

925155,spincast,2015-07-18 01:42:00,3279,nice. Looks like a lot of fun was had  I see Monique shares my other half's taste in beverage. Everything goes fine with wine..
925169,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-18 03:16:00,8243,"What a pleasure it would be to spend time with the family and catch fish one after another after another. That sure is God's country. What I noticed right away was how brilliant gold the pics are up north. They shine like a new Rolex. The walleye here on Erie are a drab light green with no gold at all.  It is tough to hold back when a fish takes a topwater but it can be deadly and to me the most exiting way to take a fish.  Very nice Sir, thanks for sharing your adventure and family time with us."
925174,wormdunker,2015-07-18 07:31:00,1711,"Thanx TJ!  Great story & wonderful pix!  Fishing with the family, having fun!"
925184,wallyboss,2015-07-18 13:40:00,1095,Beautiful colors on those northern walleyes.  No wonder they call them Dores ( golden) in French.
925187,Ralph Field,2015-07-18 14:28:00,1018,Great report ! You can tell everyone was having a great time by the smiles in the pictures.
925190,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-18 14:44:00,336,Stellar report! Nothing like fishing with family.  Way to go Monique for suppling camp with fish.  Great looking shore lunches.

Imagine when the kawarthas and great lakes were like this.  Great report.  They had a catch and release policy before many others did, well over 25 years now I'm sure, barbless hooks only. NO PIKE KEPT.  max two walleye each for shore lunch. They have done alot to ensure a very sustainable fishery.

I think its the tannins/darkness of the water.  We've been sometimes catching them in two feet of water.. cant see your jig and sometimes pull them out when you set your hook! but the water isnt murky at all ..."

925369,Reel Man,2015-07-20 08:00:00,80,Great report TJ!  Sounds like a fantastic trip!  Don't know what it is but my wife always seems to outfish me too! Lol
925451,Steve,2015-07-20 23:02:00,2075,"Brian, both the one in TJ's photo's, and the one you linked, are 10MW. (almost $40 million in equipment each farm...There are a couple 100MW projects in the country right now that are absolutely amazing (Haldimand and Kingston)...I'm always curious as to what locals think about them...I know MOST folks are against wind turbines....so be it....but with respect to solar...Most seem ok with it.  Enough of this sidetrack, lol...."
