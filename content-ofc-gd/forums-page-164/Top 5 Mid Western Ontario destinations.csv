927481,manitoubass2,2015-08-03 14:55:00,11391,Yeah let me know!  Even if we cant fish I can bring some frybread and coffee for a quick chat
927253,wvmedic,2015-08-02 14:10:00,144,"Hello all.  I'm just back from my second trip to Beautiful Canada this year, well this month.  Started on the French River and Lake Nipissing the last week of June finishing up our vacation on July 3rd spending our 32nd wedding anniversary fishing with my best fishing partner ever.  To my trip to Quebec fishing in the Zec Kipawa with the guy's, between the two boats we boated close to 200 Walleye for the week most between 16 and 23 inches. At a guess, I would say we boated nearly 100 Northern Pike in the  25 to 32 inch range.  So I am home 2 days and am already planning next years trip. I have never been to Western Ontario and I think I would like to see it as well.  Looking for a good to exelant Walleye fishery with not to expensive cabins or modern camping facilities and my 14' 9.9 hp tinny would be acceptable on.. Not to far into the bush, my Wife would not go to Quebec with me, we were close to 3 hours into the bush from town.  So what would be your top 5 Western Ontario Walleye fishing destinations? I forgot to mention, I would prefer just northwest of Sault Ste Marie around Wawa.  Thanks, Jeff"
927255,2 tone z71,2015-08-02 14:16:00,1311,Lac suel...Spanish...it's all I got
927257,wvmedic,2015-08-02 14:21:00,144,"Just wanted to add, my 14' is a Lowe 140v. So it is a bit wider and deeper than the average 14' tinny.  Jeff"
927258,Acountdeleted,2015-08-02 14:56:00,2562,That's out of my expertise. When I hear 'North West' I think west of Thunder Bay.
927260,wvmedic,2015-08-02 15:01:00,144,"jeremy84, I might be a little off geographically. I'll see if I can fix the heading.  I was thinking of somewhere around Wawa area. That would be around an 850 mile drive from home for me.  Jeff"
927261,manitoubass2,2015-08-02 15:01:00,11391, Lac seul rainy lake then lake of the woods would be an epic trip for anyone who hasnt fished up here
927262,wvmedic,2015-08-02 15:04:00,144,"North East Shark, thanks.  The Spanish looks good.  Jeff"
927264,wvmedic,2015-08-02 15:12:00,144,"manitoubass2,  I'm not opposed to those areas. I need to look into driving times and such, thank you for the suggestions. Those are on my radar, and have been on my bucket list of sorts.   Jeff"
927265,2 tone z71,2015-08-02 15:35:00,1311,
927266,manitoubass2,2015-08-02 15:52:00,11391,Just do it!!!!  2 days at each lake even would be amazing
927267,Gerritt,2015-08-02 15:54:00,6129,Some big waters for a 14'r with a 9.9...... You would want to pick and choose your days
927268,wvmedic,2015-08-02 15:59:00,144,"Gerritt,  I was thinking the same thing.  I would and am looking over the maps for sheltered areas. I was white knuckled on the tiller when a storm blew in on the west arm of Nipissing at the first of the month. I was running as hard as I could to get out of the wind in some sheltered water.  Jeff"
927297,Acountdeleted,2015-08-02 18:20:00,2562,"Agreed. Lac de Mills Lac, anywhere in Dryden, preferably Bluett lake, Jacobs lake in Thunder Bay is unreal."
927315,2 tone z71,2015-08-02 19:41:00,1311,I would move and live happily ever after anywhere from Thunder Bay to Manitoba border lol..the fishing up there I'll never ever forget
927316,manitoubass2,2015-08-02 19:53:00,11391,"Big waters yes, but lots of launches with great spots within 500 yards of the launches lol.  My favorite walleye spot is a 2 minute drive of the launch to northwest bay on rainy lake. Lotsa walleye, BIG walleye, perch, crappie, whitefish and big pike.  I hear some good muskies too but ive never caught any there lol"
927317,manitoubass2,2015-08-02 19:55:00,11391,If your looking for numbers of walleye pike and bass I know a road that has about 30 awesome lakes on it. Can fish 4 lakes in one day if ya want to lol
927320,wvmedic,2015-08-02 20:17:00,144,"manitoubass2, looking for quality numbers. Don't have to catch a 100 a day, would like a chance at a 10 pounder.  Jeff"
927321,manitoubass2,2015-08-02 20:39:00,11391,Then let me know if ya wanna hit rainy lake.  Ill show ya my spot. Lotsa 7-12lb walleye but ive seen 14s pulled out in fall.  Its a super easy spot to fish and its sheltered
927323,wvmedic,2015-08-02 20:46:00,144,"Thanks for the offer manitoubass2, I will give you a shout. I plan on fishing somewhere north of our border the last week of July or the first week of August 2016.  Jeff"
927327,manitoubass2,2015-08-02 21:04:00,11391,Sounds good!
927431,Acountdeleted,2015-08-03 03:04:00,2562,You and me both. This is my dream retirement.
927433,manitoubass2,2015-08-03 03:33:00,11391,"Ahhh, and im smack dab in the middle?"
927434,Acountdeleted,2015-08-03 03:44:00,2562,Where you are is beautiful too. We were actually just east of you earlier today.
927435,manitoubass2,2015-08-03 03:45:00,11391,And why didnt you message me? Lol  Always good too meet the OFC folk
927436,Acountdeleted,2015-08-03 04:14:00,2562,A little to far away (In Sturgeon bay). We are planning on coming up labour day weekend. We'll let you know when and where we end up going. It would be a pleasure to meet.
