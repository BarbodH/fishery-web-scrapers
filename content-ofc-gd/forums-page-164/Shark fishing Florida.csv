927225,Fang,2015-08-02 03:38:00,1330,It's not too far a drive east over to Cocoa Beach. I went out with Captain Jamie Glasner of Fin and Fly charters. He does both inshore and offshore and I wouldn't hesitate to rebook with him again.  He has an Instagram account where he posts pics of the days catch. If it's nasty weather and rough seas you can always go inshore fir reds and trout as a choice
