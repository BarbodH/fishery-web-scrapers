927520,Rodbender,2015-08-03 19:45:00,1027,Looks like a bomb mushroom. Great pics BTW. wish I got the top instead of the lake think they call it a wall cloud  I was on the dock with the big lens on saw it comming ran inside changed lenses and it was on top of us I'm talking 2-3 mins tops from Port perry to Janetville and yes the sounds you heard on the vid it was there too I think it was the winds higher up in the clouds them suckers watned to spin
927525,Joey,2015-08-03 20:29:00,9122,"Wow, those pics are unbelievable Raf and Rodbender.  Holy Moly!!!"
927531,FloatnFly,2015-08-03 20:46:00,1640,"Those storms were crazy, we made it off Lake O at about 3pm, had supper off the bbq seconds before it poured rain.  This morning had to shop-vac 36 gallons of water out of my dads boat, the front bilge pump wire was disconnected so it wasn't working! this boat is new to him so no water proof top yet."
927580,Sinker,2015-08-04 00:57:00,8692,I was ON scugog at view lake when that rolled through. I literally got the boat on the trailer with about 3 seconds to spare before she let loose. I had to wait in the vehicle for it to pass so I could strap the boat down. You couldnt see 30 ft across the water!!  S.

927401,Fisherman,2015-08-03 00:55:00,7201,"Around 4pm yesterday afternoon we had a thunder boomer NW of us and the sky was black. Looking over Erie it was Blue bird skies, I have never seen this in my 61 years. the rain came down in buckets from the NW and the sky was still clear and sunny over the lake. It only lasted for 20 minutes. Guys 15K from me said it was like that for an hour. Global worming is not the best way to describe our crazy weather these days. I have seen sun showers but never a sun thunderstorm.  Is the end near? When it comes I hope I am in bed with my wonderful wife, or on the lake with my her netting a 20 pound pic.. Would that then be Sunderstorm.."

927412,misfish,2015-08-03 01:22:00,29133,"Sitting here and listening to rain and thunder still. I can hear thunder along ways away. This is the wierdest storm so far since I have lived up here. And there goes another rumble .   Going to shut it down for a night, and go and sit and watch and listen.  "
927413,Woodsman,2015-08-03 01:26:00,1286,Seaforth got hit about a hour ago. Went completely dark & winds really picked up. Heavy rain also. Local & area fire departments responding to multiple trees down over hydro lines. Still raining pretty good here but the winds died down after the front quickly passed. Lots of thunder still.
927414,Fisherman,2015-08-03 01:26:00,7201,It's like a strobe light headache..long time since we had water in the ditch.
927415,manitoubass2,2015-08-03 01:28:00,11391,Thatta boy brian!  Crack a beer and enjoy.  Stay safe people in the area?  Get more video if its safe!

927429,mr blizzard,2015-08-03 02:59:00,1589,"Maybe some people should not gripe about two months of winter in ontario including the weather station. I would take a little bit more cooler weather than all the stuff your are dealing with now, blue skies and cold weather do not kill u , tornadoes and hurricanes are not so good, been there done that, yes i lived through the incident in Barrie and my family survived Hurricane Hazel and the tornado in Woodbridge over the course of 70 years, while in the same house, weather is changing, check out the Woodbridge Storey, se my parents property swamped , govt scambed my dad for 4.5 acres for a song, just a fact but that is old history to the govt"
927438,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-03 04:23:00,10439,They had a tornado in Teviotdale tonight. Sounds like there is a lot of damage from it.

Mid afternoon we could hear thunder off in the distance.  Guess we were lucky.  Same here , nada, but there was a pretty good lightshow over the lake in the evening, started to rain just as I was going to bed about 11, got some well needed rain but if there was lightning and wind I slept thru it. No branches or debris down when I got up"
927453,Rod Caster,2015-08-03 12:33:00,5784,They called for thunder storms all day yesterday. I worked outside all day and felt three drops of rain.  S.Ont really got it bad! Quite the video Brian
927454,mr blizzard,2015-08-03 12:37:00,1589,"Hope everyone is ok back there, along with Brians video, just watched recaps on the weather network, they were showing multiple waterspouts on Huron from yesterday, that was quite the storm"
927467,Ralph Field,2015-08-03 13:52:00,1018,The green skies are a bad sign. Anyone seeing them should get to a safe place.
927473,manitoubass2,2015-08-03 14:30:00,11391,"Yep.  Green/yellow skies, a sudden drop in temp, or mention of hail and its time to get inside!!! Or somewhere safe"

927498,moxie,2015-08-03 16:54:00,1566,Here in Whitby I could see a centre of irregular clouds surrounded by smooth outer clouds in the first band that rolled through. There was what looked like a slight rotation in the centre but it didnt stick around long enough for us to see even a hail stone but the rain did manage to pull out a couple eave spikes which created a waterfall outside our front door.
927501,Rodbender,2015-08-03 17:14:00,1027,I just drove back from Janetville hardest hit place was just outside Manchester on Goodwood Road lots of trees down and some fell on houses. We watched the storm come across Lake Squgog just a wall of rain comming at us then the lightning and thunder sometimes at the same time she was a powerfull storm
927513,davey buoy,2015-08-03 19:04:00,5505,"Tally today:.Cleaned up a 12""x20' front tree that fell.Next,neighbours tree over my fence and onto the pool deck,done.Two trees at the back about a 24"" radius left to do.Have spent almost 7 hours so far today.One of the back trees I have cleared from 3 neighbours.Still the majority across my property and resting on the fence.The last one was hit by lightning and split from top to bottom down the middle and still standing.It must be almost 40' but tilting back and if it falls won't hit anything.Figure this tree tally will take most of the week after work,and maybe then some.Thank god for chainsaws."

927346,misfish,2015-08-02 22:27:00,29133,"If you can get past the sound of the cars on the road, you will hear the sound of a jet plane.  This was real scary to me.The sky went from sunny to green in a matter of minutes and the wind was stupid. Even an hour after this video, the sky was green and the thunder and lightning was going. I have seen crazy rains and winds here, but never ever have I heard this sound in the sky like I did today.  As I post, the sky is starting to clear.  Sorry for the F word.  "
927347,fishing n autograph,2015-08-02 22:29:00,2540,I have never in my life heard thunder that loud. It was wicked
927350,davey buoy,2015-08-02 22:37:00,5505,"That was wild,looking across the street and a huge branch of a tree snapped but fell back into itself.Still in the tree.Now I look out back,a huge branch of one of my big trees has snapped and fallen into three different neighbors yards .The largest part lying vertical over my and one neighbors fence.What a huge job tomorrow.Not seeing any property damage thank god."

I love them, my wife hides and cries lol  Ive been darn near 5 tornadoes now so storms to me are just cool. Nothing like a good storm(always hope nobody gets hurt though)  Im burning some broke branches as I type from a similar storm last week"

927372,misfish,2015-08-02 23:19:00,29133,The temp sure chilled down nice. Can still hear thunder rumbling . Some weird clould configuration up there.
927377,Gallie,2015-08-02 23:48:00,1215,"Right where i live there was something crazy going on, blew a neighbours pool across the canal, knocked over a 40+ foot tree 2 doors down that nearly crushed his house and there was a path carved through the swamp across the street that ripped down probably 50 or more trees and ripped the tops of the other half. Ive seen some pretty intense weather before but this was bad enough that i told my wife to go into the basement with the baby. Im not sure what is was but it was the worst wind ive ever seen and after when we drove around we noticed all the damage was in a small area the rest looked like normal storm damage. More comin so stay safe out there"
