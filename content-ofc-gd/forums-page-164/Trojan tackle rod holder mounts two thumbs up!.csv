927291,tomkat,2015-08-02 18:07:00,246,Just had Dave make me some mounts for Lund Sporttrak for Salty rod holders. Great product beautiful workmanship machined from nice thick aluminum . These are solid as a rock really great design. Mount them anywhere along the track versatile no drilling very happy with them.

927337,Pigeontroller,2015-08-02 21:49:00,2793,"Its nothing like Burt's. Its custom. Designed, Built, and installed (likely in your driveway) by Dave Dutchak."

927360,tomkat,2015-08-02 22:52:00,246,Yeah my Lund has the thinner 45 degree Sporttrak so it was a new build for Dave. He came up with a great design and it is ideal. If I figure out how to post pics I will put them up.

If I figure out how to post pics I will put them up.   Would like to see them. I have built some holders for a couple of guys with tracks.
