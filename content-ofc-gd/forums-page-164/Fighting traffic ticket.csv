The only problem is the area code thing regarding what you pay for insurance, hate that sh't. Why should we pay because we live in an area people have accidents and us pay for it. Crap I see kids driving cars I can't even afford and we pay higher rates because of them!  I should have kept my farm, but the the GOV wants capital gains so we are still shafted!"

927430,Acountdeleted,2015-08-03 03:01:00,2562,Thanks for the help guys. I'm always polite to the police. I understand they are just doing their jobs and aren't targeting anyone. I had one of my tickets reduced that I got about 12 years ago on the spot just by minding my P's and Q's but never anything thrown out. Hopefully I won't have to try to talk myself out of anything ever again.

Had my gps on my phone when I was driving through Toronto, it kept telling me to turn down one way streets. At a red light I reached over to turn my phone off and got pulled over for distracted driving.  I have heard insurance companies love the distracted driving charge to raise your rates so I hired one of those X-police guys. I told him I would only hire for a full acquittal. He said that's fine and put in the paperwork. That was mid may and I have yet to see my court summons yet. Could take a while.  I'll keep everyone posted on how it goes.  I don't agree that you go charged if that is really what was happening in your case.... With the way the law is written it is going to a tough one to win.  The thing that amazes me is I can't drive 2 miles where I live that someone isn't still texting or talking on a cellphone. If I was a police officer I could reverse the city's debt in a couple of months.... The tourists and citizens here must think that law doesn't apply or something. LOL."
927222,Acountdeleted,2015-08-02 02:42:00,2562,"Thanks guys.  Oh Canuck fan I know. I'm worried to be honest. I'd even pay the whole fine if they dropped the charges just so the insurance company doesn't get a whiff.  The odd thing was, after I got the ticket I went back to the police cruisers car and asked her for directions. She helped me out and was very nice. I was actually surprised the ticket stuck with how understanding she was. Seems odd."

Most officers don't get paid extra to attend court because it's scheduled on their day shift  As for no getting a 20 over ticket reduced at the side of the road, a lot of coppers have lost their ability to use discretion by the courts and the bosses still want tickets to be written. I for one don't like it but it is what it is.  Go get your first appearance with the crown and have the ticket reduced. If you don't like the resolution you can take it to trial. Unless you are willing to pay for a paralegal don't try and apply for charter motions like a previous post said. I have never seen it work in the past.  They will usually knock it down to 10 or 15 over"

Most officers don't get paid extra to attend court because it's scheduled on their day shift  I always wondered about if it was ""overtime"" to have the officers available for court or it was part of their regular shifts. It does make sense to have the court date sync with the lower cost of the officer being there.  I snuck by on one charge under the Crown's radar though. Due to the wording on the ticket and website regarding first meetings I was always working during those times. I didn't bother contacting the Crown when I was sitting the morning of the trial he demanded to know why I was there. I showed him the paper work. Oops the officer was on duty on the far side of the county, raging blizzard no chance for her to get to court in time. Charges dropped.... If I had of called ahead she would have been on duty at the courthouse and available. The OPP who was on duty said to me, good one but I wouldn't count on it ever working again LOL."

As best I can guess here in town we only have 5 police cars that are used for patrol, and 3 of them are blacked out models where the police badging only shows when you are directly across from it. No outside lights on 2 of them for sure too....  The thing is though these soccer mom's who are the majority of who I see, in their minivans usually with kids are so oblivious.

It doesnt matter if its 1 ticket or 10 its still 250. The worst thing i ever did was just pay all my tickets when i got them because it cost me a fortune in insurance. Now that im gettin older i havent got one in a while but i got quite i few when i was in my early 20s. Its either all or nothing if you pay it your insurance knows about it if you fight it you at least have a chance at getting rid of it and thats worth it every time imo. Good luck."

Never had any other charges, infact the only other time I was ever stopped was for an illegal left turn at Broadview & Gerrard in front of the Don Jail but the copper let me off because he believed me when I told him I honestly didn't see the sign.  Never had an at fault accident either.  Drive the speed limit and obey the rules and you won't have to worry about fighting tickets in court.  I only pay $691 a year for insurance.

"" Oh I know you, you are the ,,,,,,,lady."" She once told the cop, ""I knew you were waiting for me so I got here as soon as I could"". Our insurance was to the point I had to come out of retirement to pay for it. 15 years now no speeding tickets. She wants to buy a Nissan 300Z or some ridiculous 400HP thing, I don't think so honey. A fiend works at the track and she takes the 1/4 mile run once and a while at Toronto International Speedway to feed her need for speed  which is about 3 hour drive from TO. Another story.

Now should I be fight the ticket? Ive always heard that if the officer isn't present they rip up the ticket. Any truth to this? Cause you know he won't be showing up in the sault. But if it's that easy then everyone would be speeding in different towns. Looking for some advice thanks"
927133,grimsbylander,2015-08-01 17:23:00,3016,Why would the officer not show up?
927134,Steve,2015-08-01 17:29:00,2075,"officers show up...they get extra pay to do so...  but you may get it reduced, if it is a 30km or more ticket....if it is less than that, just pay it."
927136,pike slayer,2015-08-01 17:59:00,1177,I'm from the sault and I got the ticket in sudbury. I would assume the officer wouldn't show up in the sault for a speeding ticket.

Get it knocked down to no points just a fine.  It will not effect your insurance policy. You can take your chance of a no show, but if he does, then your going to pay. The fine plus points and increase on your insurance."
927138,John Bacon,2015-08-01 18:13:00,3277,"I'm from the sault and I got the ticket in sudbury. I would assume the officer wouldn't show up in the sault for a speeding ticket.  If you got the ticket in Sudbury then the trial would probably be in Sudbury.  E.g. I am from Toronto.  When I chose to fight a ticket that I received in Donwood (just outside of Peterborough) I had to go to Peterborough to fight the ticket.  If you are lucky, the officer won't show and you get off scott free.  If he does show, then you stand a good chance of getting an offer to plead to a lessor charge (e.g. 15 over instead of 30 over).  They don't have time to hold a trial for everyone who fights the tickets.  But, I would expect that you will need to make the trip to Sudbury rather than the officer making a trip to the Sault."
927139,OhioFisherman,2015-08-01 18:15:00,6623,"I am not sure how your system works up there, so things may be different. I fought two tickets here in Ohio where the officer was clearly wrong, neither were for speed. You go to court and plead not guilty? The officer is not there, they schedule you to come back another day for a hearing, and the officer is there.  I drove an 18 wheeler for a living, keeping unjust points off of my driver's license was important to me. In both cases my tickets were thrown out, I ate the ones I deserved. In both cases I had pictures that proved the officer was wrong, but he got paid to show up in court, and I didn't."
927141,misfish,2015-08-01 18:23:00,29133,"  You got that right Paul.  When I got nailed for 20 over, the officer told me ,after handing me the ticket, go to court and ask for a lower charge. Why he couldnt just give me the lesser, is beyond me. It cost me 4 hours off work."
927143,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-01 18:46:00,8243,"I don't think all jurisdictions are the same for traffic court now. If I'm not mistaken the ticketing constable does not have to show up in Hamilton. A supervisor can present evidence in his or her absence. If I'm in the wrong I pay, if not I fight it. I went to court(OPP) a few years back because I was speeding but not as much as I was fined for. I talked to the Crown rep. before the hearing and she immediately knocked it down to 90 in a 80 from 110 in a 80 which meant points too. Get there early and ask for the Duty Clerk for the Crown or call the Crowns office well before hand, they don't want to pay OT for a cop to show up if off shift.  They are very reasonable in my opinion.  If you were speeding and got caught pay the fine. You have to go to the jurisdiction where the fine was levied for certain. One reason Smokeys down south love ticketing out of state drivers, especially Yankees and Canucks. The last time I got a ticket in Georgia I was doing 125 in a 70. MPH! I went straight to jail. A long time ago.  The old joke was if Johnny D is sitting in the back seat, who's driving? ........The Cops."
927145,FrankTheRabbit,2015-08-01 18:58:00,479,"Any guilty plea to a lesser charge will result in an increase for your auto insurance. The prosecutors will only want a guilty plea-any kind of guilty plea because it helps them out in the end for their win loss record.  Best thing to do is arm yourself with your own facts and dispute what the charges are.  If you want to dispute the charges, first thing you'll need to do is have your own version of events with what happened. Day time, night time, cloudy, sunny, dry roads, wet roads, etc. Be as detailed as you possibly can...go back to what you've written and try to remember as to what happened, because you'll need have your own version of events to contest what the charges are.  Next, request for a full disclosure. Whatever you've been charged with, everyone is entitled to full disclosure, which is the officer's version of events. This will be what you'll need to analyze to form your defense and dispute the charges.  The strategy with this is, you want to request full disclosure no less than 60 days before your court time. You want to time it and hope they don't end up providing you your full disclosure, so when you arrive in court, you plead for a stay of charges based on not receiving full disclosure in a timely manner to form your defense. When they re -schedule your new court day, you can plead a violation of 11 A or B which infringes on your right to a fair and timely trial (which is I think 11mths).  Another thing you can look up and request is to see if the officer has been trained and obtained a certification to operate that particular radar detector. And so whether or not the radar was calibrated prior to you getting pulled over.  At the end of the day, if you really did speed, you prob should pay for in.  The above strategy will take time.  Good luck."

927163,4x4bassin,2015-08-01 20:18:00,1025,"Frank is bang on here . Insurance companies rate speeding tickets as minor and major , that's it . Basically any ticket below 4 points is a minor infraction to them whether it's 25km over or 1 km over . It all depends how your particular insurance company works (1 free ticket/accident) whether your rates go up but it will go against you . If it is a major infraction you would want to get it knocked down to a minor or your rates will most certainly go up . Fighting these tickets are not all that hard if you just want to get it knocked down a bit , just mark the right box on the ticket (they are all different) send it in and wait for your day with the prosecutor , then just show up . If you were not a total ass to the cop (they will have his notes) the prosecutor will always cut a deal for a guilty plea . There might even be an option for out of town drivers like yourself to do it over the phone , I know they have this option in Peel region ( at least they did 5 years ago) So anyone who thinks when a cop gives you a ticket and says ""no points"" and think everything is ok , just remember your insurance company doesn't care about points (that's the MOT) they are just looking at guilty pleas on a minor or major infraction . Good luck"

Been a G licensed driver for 16 years and no other previous convictions either.  You plead guilty to any traffic violation, it's just ammunition for your auto insurer to justify a rate increase.

Like I said , that's a minor infraction and generally would not result in an insurance rate increase but get another one and plead guilty in the next couple years and your rates will most likely go up .

927184,Canuck2fan,2015-08-01 21:52:00,1444,"The only truth about auto insurance in Ontario is that the system is the MOST expensive in North America. There are way too many variables to have ANY hard and fast rules on what will affect one person's rates over anothers.  It is a fact though that in Ontario demerit points do NOT have any bearing on your personal rating. All convictions either minor and major do.  So if you can not get a ticket thrown out so it results in NO conviction, or reduce it to the conviction of a minor offence from a major offence, fighting it then becomes only about getting the amount of the fine lowered... Just getting the points removed, while still having a minor conviction WILL NOT help you with your insurance company in Ontario.  If anyone has had different a different experience in Ontario their rates were lowered for other reasons, or the insurance company didn't run their abstract at renewal so the insurer was unaware of the conviction. If you doubt this a quick check a KNOWLEDGEABLE broker will straighten out any illusions you are under about demerit points in Ontario.  So to answer the OP I would fight it only if I could all but guarantee a complete acquittal of all charges."

He said that's fine and put in the paperwork. That was mid may and I have yet to see my court summons yet. Could take a while.  I'll keep everyone posted on how it goes."
