Guess what he was? Yep, a By Law officer. And he was dead serious. This world of ours sure has some problems but kids selling worms?? Come on man!

And how many 'Worms for Sale' signs do you pass by to any lake in the Kawarthas, that aren't a commercial business, theres tons of people that do this.  Hell, where I grew up in Sarnia, there was a guy that lived beside the arena who sold worms and minnows from his shed, just pull up, open the fridge, grab the worms, or fill a  bucket with minnows, put the money in the bin, drive away, all done by honour system.

Perhaps the kids or there customers created traffic flow problems on the road or sidewalk or threw away garbage that they never picked up but the next door neighbour had to deal with it.

I’ve since met with the family, have reached out to our By-Law supervisor, and contacted my Council colleagues. I’ve been advised that in the past, this same By-Law provision has been used to shut down lemonade stands that were also run by children. My goal is to remedy the current issue and fix it for all going forward. We should let kids be kids.“Thanks,Justin"
