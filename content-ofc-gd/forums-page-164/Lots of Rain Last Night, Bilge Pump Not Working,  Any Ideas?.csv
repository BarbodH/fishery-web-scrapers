The ones for nav light and livewell are working.  Battery is fine, they have a press to reset and that hasn't worked, anyone have any ideas? Is it shorting out?  Thanks in advance."

927469,James77,2015-08-03 14:02:00,175,"Thanks Lew, we just took the back deck apart to access the bilge and somehow it was unplugged, still confused as to how it happened. Thanks!"
927470,Walleye72,2015-08-03 14:02:00,156,"Yes, I would check the fuse.  Also, find the bilge pump itself and see if a wire has come off it.  I've had that happen a few times.  The wire can burn right off the spade connector.  That's an easy fix.  Edit:  Glad you got it working."
