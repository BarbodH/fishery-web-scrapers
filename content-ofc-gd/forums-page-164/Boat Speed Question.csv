926358,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-27 21:07:00,540,"I have a 1997 Princecraft Superfisherman LX - 14ft and 2011 Yamaha F20.  Loaded with bow mount, battery, gas, gear, and me (I am a big guy at 260lb), I only get about 30-31 kmph.  Feel it should be more.  Boat is rated for max 20 hp.  Thoughts?"
926361,Beavertail,2015-07-27 21:31:00,331,Best way is to know what your RPM are at WOT and if the motor is operating in the optimum range. By the sounds of it though I think you're in the ballpark.
926362,misfish,2015-07-27 21:42:00,29133,Sound right with what you have as as far as power. Are you sure its rated 20 max?
926364,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-27 21:58:00,540,Ok...good to know.  U.S Coast Guard sticker says max 20.  Engine purrs like a kitten and starts immediately.  I am just used to faster boats I guess.  Need to enjoy the ride more without focussing on just getting there.
926366,davey buoy,2015-07-27 21:58:00,5505,Seems a little on the fast side to me with a 20hp.I would consider yourself doing pretty good.
926367,Fisherman,2015-07-27 21:59:00,7201,"Rated for 20 by the pamphlet,  sounds about the right speed."
926368,FloatnFly,2015-07-27 22:01:00,1640,"When doing a search for your boat, I wasn't able to find that model by Princecraft, they had a Super Pro........Starcraft had the Superfisherman and the 14ft model was rated for 40hp  http://www.starcraftmarine.com/sites/default/files/brochures/1997-Starcraft-Fishing-Catalog.pdf  The Princecraft Fisherman is rated for 20HP though  http://boatspecs.iboats.com/Princecraft__1997/bp/54br1356y"
926377,2 tone z71,2015-07-27 23:05:00,1311,"You ...gear..bow mount @ battery's ..fuel...18 mph, with a 20 hp I'd be smiling"
926378,HTHM,2015-07-27 23:17:00,4082,"I feel your pain, I went from a 60 mph bass boat to a ~40 mph v hull, and I really miss the feeling of having your ears pinned back on the water."
926394,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-28 01:01:00,540,Cool.  Thanks for the feedback!
926405,ccmtcanada,2015-07-28 01:40:00,7971,I have a Princecraft 14' Yukon with a 25hp Merc on the back. I get about 40 km/h top speed.  Towing a kid on a tube with two others in the boat it goes down to about 32km/h.
926528,Cast-Away,2015-07-28 20:01:00,790,If you were a 150lb guy you might get another 5kph out of the boat! Just kidding
926539,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-28 21:01:00,540,Lol...5kmph is not worth the diet!
926566,bigbuck,2015-07-29 01:28:00,2449,You're in the ballpark. Don't bring what you don't need on a given trip to save on weight which will dircetly correlate to better top speed and also fuel economy.
926579,wormdunker,2015-07-29 10:03:00,1711,"I have a 14' Lund, brand new 20 hp Yammy 4 stroke, with full floor, electric troller, 2 batteries a full tank of gas, myself & my gear.  22 MPH which is about 26 KPH.  I'm happy with that speed.  I had a 30 HP Suzuki 2 stroke - went 30 MPH - scary fast for a 14'."
926591,Fisherman,2015-07-29 11:52:00,7201,"22 MPH which is about 26 KPH.  I think you better recalculate, hate to see ya burn out on re entry"
926602,limeyangler,2015-07-29 12:58:00,5204,Seems a little on the fast side to me with a 20hp.I would consider yourself doing pretty good. I was thinking the sameâ€¦.that is damn fast for a 20hp with all your other calculations considered.
926635,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-29 15:12:00,540,Alright!  I am happy then!   Thanks!!!
