Conservation officers from Chapleau, Wawa, Timmins, Hearst, Kirkland Lake, North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury checked 1,394 individuals from May 1 to June 30, 2015. Officers inspected 126 bait dealers and harvesters, paying special attention to the possession and sale of species other than bait, the proper use of log books, and licensing. They also worked jointly with the Ontario Provincial Police, Quebec conservation officers, the ministry’s canine units and other agencies to check 134 individuals entering Ontario to ensure baitfish, leeches, crayfish and invasive species were not being imported into the province. In addition, officers inspected 1,134 bait buckets, at boat launches and on water, to ensure only baitfish species were being used for angling and bait was being disposed of properly.  Officers laid 18 charges for: possessing unlawful fish from other jurisdictions fishing without a licence selling fish without a licence bringing live leeches into Ontario for bait failing to comply with licence conditions possessing non-baitfish species  Officers issued 71 warnings for: failing to complete, produce or keep a bait dealer’s daily log possessing non-baitfish species possessing more than 120 baitfish taking baitfish for commercial purposes without a licence failing to submit an annual return  Officers also used the opportunity to educate dealers, harvesters and anglers on the importance of preventing the movement and transfer of invasive species.

926856,Joeytier,2015-07-30 23:51:00,3990,They were up on here on Temiscaming Qc/ON a few weeks ago for a full day on a Saturday doing highway stop checks with the OPP and together with the QC co's.  First time I have ever been checked by a CO around here in either province.
926896,OhioFisherman,2015-07-31 05:35:00,6623,""" possessing non-baitfish species ""  That was a concern for me when I bought bait in Ontario, I don't recall ever getting a receipt for a bait fish purchase, but once you have them in your boat? A species that isn't a bait fish in on you? Is a moon eye a bait fish? I had never seen one until I bought bait in Ontario, and it didn't look right, so I didn't take it. I knew smallies and trout weren't bait fish.  Perhaps some confusion could be avoided by allowing non residents to catch bait from the water they are fishing?"
926897,Bondar,2015-07-31 06:01:00,817,"They are working hard in my area lately. Been finding non res fishing with gobys, bait buckets with foreign DNA. Everyone ask for more enforcement well it's here I think it's great ."
