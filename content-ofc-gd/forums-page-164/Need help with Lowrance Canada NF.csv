926527,Nipfisher,2015-07-28 19:54:00,2449,A friend is looking to buy a 15' extension for his transducer cable as he is mounting a Mark IV HDI on his pontoon boat. Lowrance Canada only gave him the Navico phone number. Radio world has them on the website but are out of stock for 3-4 weeks. Any ideas?
