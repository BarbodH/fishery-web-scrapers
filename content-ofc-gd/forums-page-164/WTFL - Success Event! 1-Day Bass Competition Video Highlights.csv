On August 1st, 2015, I had hosted a very successful Free and friendly shore fishing Bass competition at Grenadier Pond, High Park, Toronto.  I've started a shore fishing league that is free to everyone to participate. I'm trying to start a new movement for urban anglers to compete in shore fishing competitions since most of us don't own boats or cars or have the money to compete.  This is a great way to bring the fishing community together and make new friends.  Here is a video highlight of the event. Move over CFL, WTFL is coming through! Also, we had a professional angler who participated in this event! Thanks for coming out!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ewyW1BbDkY   http://wheretofish.ca/league/  Tight lines everyone!

Introducing new and many anglers, can be a catch 22. Just something to think about is all.  I can remember fishing it in the 70,s out of a row boat with my uncle and pop. There was some great fishing back then. As a kid, every fish was great.LOL  Just a side question. Is there still a small animal zoo there? Thats how long ago I have been there."

I believe the zoo is still there. I haven't been part of that park in a long time. I just stick to the pond area."

I think my videos on youtube are working. People who visit there to fish recognize me from youtube. This means, they get the message I'm trying to convey to everyone."
