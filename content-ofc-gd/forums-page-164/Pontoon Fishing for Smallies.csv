I have a nice pontoon boat and I'm looking for advice as to how to set up my rig for each of these species.  Things like baits and depths would help a great deal.  Thanks in advance,  MJP"

Fish senkos, Texas rigged and if winds are calm go weightless.   Also fishing weeds close to shore in about 3 feet of water also produces.  Good luck!!"
