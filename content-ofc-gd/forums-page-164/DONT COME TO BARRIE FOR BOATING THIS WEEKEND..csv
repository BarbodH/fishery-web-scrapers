926947,misfish,2015-07-31 16:43:00,29133,"Once again we have Kempenfest and they like to take away all the boating fun out of it. Tiffen launch is closed. Yup, huge parking area for trucks/cars and trailers, but lets put some art crap , stuff in there instead. The marina launch is open, but good luck trying to park your rig anywhere after you launch.. That lot is a midway. And to add to that, it,s $10 to launch and still another $15 to park on the side of the road. Thats if you find a spot . With all the new road building at the water front, parking is atleast 1/2 gone right now compared to last.  Watched 2 guys yelling at the lone gaurd guy at the entrance of the tiffen launch. Felt sorry for the poor fella. It,s not his fault. Told the two other guys, take your complaints to the city. They just yelled some more about that. LMAO  Also told the guard guy, ask for a different post cuz your going to hear this allllllll weekend.  Above in effect til the end of the long weekend."
926951,mr blizzard,2015-07-31 17:42:00,1589,"Good advice Brian, don't miss those days at Tiffin at all esp during Kempenfest, Used to go up to Gravenhurst  when the artsy stuff came to town."
926953,irishfield,2015-07-31 17:53:00,26272,I wouldn't come to Penetang either... it's Chaplain 400 Rendezvous weekend here and most stuff is down at the town dock / park.
926956,hutch4113,2015-07-31 18:34:00,374,Annoying to say the least.  Stay out of downtown period I guess.

John  The Tiffen launch has change huge since you left here. There is parking for about 30 or so rigs. The launch it,s self is still  crap.."
926963,Joeytier,2015-07-31 19:35:00,3990,Another reason to avoid Barrie like the plague...as if I needed one
926967,jimmer,2015-07-31 19:50:00,2730,Most lakes within 2 hours of TO will be crazy busy.
926969,kickingfrog,2015-07-31 20:04:00,8333,I know kempenfest is a big deal for lots of people but it's a no-go for me.  What's wrong with the ramp B? I've only had issues with users.
926970,fishindevil,2015-07-31 20:10:00,6254,"yup full on citiot invasion is on full blast in cottage countrycops are out too harassing everyone   and traffic is crazy,one more long weekend after this and it will be over for another year.....the lakes will be insane as usual too living in cottage country sure sucks on the long weekends .....fun wow...lol"

It needs to be wider and have docks so people get their boats out of the way for others to get in and out.  BTW  Have you heard what they want to do over on the north shore? Line of docks from heritage to hooters. I can see lots of damage from east winds.
926972,misfish,2015-07-31 20:13:00,29133,"I MISS MY TOON. It,s been 26 days since I have fished. Now you know why I like it. No launch required."
926974,kickingfrog,2015-07-31 20:21:00,8333,"Ah, I've got a skinny boat... my head is another matter."

926986,misfish,2015-07-31 20:59:00,29133,Did they ever straighten it out at the end   LMAO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I will take a pic for ya.
926987,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-31 21:01:00,8243,"I know it is a pain but we all need to share the waterfront with non fishermen. Their taxes go towards public facilities too. If it's not public business owners will make their money anyway they can, and will."

If it's not public business owners will make their money anyway they can, and will.   It,s not a pain to me Johnny. All I am saying is, they have taken away one large launch area with lots of parking. Keep one open with very little to no parking. To add, those coming up for this fest, they will be looking far and wide for a parking place. I,ll bet those that are here for the arts, they will be more pissed then those looking to launch a boat.  Barrie is so fubar down at the water front. Trying to be a wasaga they are not."
927064,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-01 04:31:00,8243,I hear you Brian. Hamilton is trying so hard to be Toronto it is sickening. Why they would want to is beyond me.
927077,hutch4113,2015-08-01 11:38:00,374,"  LMAO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I will take a pic for ya.  I took a piece off the back end of my boat on that end.  Hate when I have to load on that side, as the angle throws everything off."
927085,mr blizzard,2015-08-01 12:15:00,1589," I took a piece off the back end of my boat on that end.  Hate when I have to load on that side, as the angle throws everything off. Yes, and sorry for what happened to your boat, we used to call it close encounters of the third kind, its just to bad that the city had not had a longer term vision so as to accomadate a dedicated boat ramp facility, that could work in conjunction with the many other waterfront activities the city host throughout the summer"
927096,Fish Farmer,2015-08-01 13:37:00,2234,Why couldn't they put the art thing out in some farm field.
927097,irishfield,2015-08-01 13:39:00,26272,"Because all the ""farm fields"" in Barrie have been covered by subdivisions in the last 20 years! lol"
927124,BillM,2015-08-01 16:21:00,17367,Luckily there is more then one launch into Simcoe
927126,misfish,2015-08-01 16:23:00,29133,Luckily there is more then one launch into Simcoe  Yup  But that Tiffen launch is always packed on the weekends.
927128,BillM,2015-08-01 16:36:00,17367,I wouldn't go near that launch on any weekend to be honest.
