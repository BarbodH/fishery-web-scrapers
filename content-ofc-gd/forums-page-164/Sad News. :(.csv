927029,misfish,2015-08-01 00:31:00,29133,He was my fav Dave  WOW 61  He was one of the most exciting guys to watch. Layed the smack down on all of them.  Pipers pit. I remeber this one.    RIP Rowdy
927030,Rizzo,2015-08-01 00:33:00,4754,remember him well. Such great characters back then
927032,misfish,2015-08-01 00:40:00,29133,"It was like it was real. LOL        Dave, Im now watching all the pass.LOL"
927036,manitoubass2,2015-08-01 01:07:00,11391,"He had a really good quote one time, wish I could remember it.  I think it was "" just when they have all the answers, I change all the questions""  I love that  Met him twice in winnipeg as a little kid and he was super nice.  RIP(one of the best to ever do it)"
927037,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-01 01:33:00,8243,"No way. He was the best. He admitted years ago he abused anabolic steroids to help heal injury quickly and increase strength. I hope it wasn't related. I have seen may athletes die too young because of juicing. Sad day.  Was he Canadian? I remember reading he was I think. Sad news for sure. Shocking actually.  Googled him, he was Canadian."
927038,Joeytier,2015-08-01 01:36:00,3990,"Yes, he was a Canuckian!  I'll remember him best for his role in They Live!, one of my all-time favourite action/horror flicks!"
927040,mr blizzard,2015-08-01 01:48:00,1589,"Remember him well only 61 I believe, it was great entertainment, he is up there with Whipper Billy Watson and many others,  met many of them back in the day when I would get pocket change to help set up the ring before matches at the OLD Woodbridge arena, could have been steroids but who knows, bottom line we lost a great one with passion"
927063,Walleye72,2015-08-01 04:08:00,156,"Awww!  Such a shame.  I admit that I did watch WWF in the 80's when I was coming of age.  I haven't watched wrestling in forever.  I really liked the movie he starred in called ""They Live"".  I'm not sure if it would hold up today but I really liked it back then.  RIP RODDY!"
927068,Reel Man,2015-08-01 08:39:00,80,RIP Hot Rod!  Truly one of the greats at a time when wrestling was still watchable.  Is it wrong that one of my favourite moments in wrestling was when Piper smashed a coconut over Superfly Snuka's head??  LMAO
927087,Joeytier,2015-08-01 12:33:00,3990,They Live! is an absolute classic!  
927090,Acountdeleted,2015-08-01 12:58:00,2562,"Man, RIP hot rod. One of the most entertaining.  My favourite quote of his  'For you see, trying to understand my next move, is like trying to stop the titanic from sinking with a wine cork'"
