470519,ottawaguy,2010-05-28 15:47:00,11,I found them and will be charging tonight ready for Saturday AM. fishing with the kids  Does anyone know where I can pick the lager MULTI US 7002 version. I know that CanadianTire sells the 3000 version but I am looking for something with a little more power. Around the Ottawa area would be great. I checked there website and the other supplier here in Ottawa does not carry them. I am trying to pick a couple up for this weekend.  Thanks
