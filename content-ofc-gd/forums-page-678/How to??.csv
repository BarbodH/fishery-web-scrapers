468783,HTHM,2010-05-23 02:38:00,4082,"I was wondering if anyone has a technique to encapsulate a ""T"" splice in heat shrink wire protector? I have a trailer that I need to get lights wired up on and wish to tie the side lights into the curcuit with a ""T"" splice. Any ideas??"
468792,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-23 03:46:00,10439,Heat shrink will not really be possible. There are a couple of methods to seal it up though.  1/ You can get chemical tape that bonds to it's self and wrap the joint. (I have some but I got it off a friend at Ontario Hydro and don't know where you can buy it)  2/ Cover the joint with liquid electrical tape.  Liquid Electrical Tape  The second solution is probably your best bet.
468793,BillM,2010-05-23 04:15:00,17367,"If you are going to dunk the joint, your only choice is solder. (If you want it to last for any amount of time)"
470537,boatman,2010-05-28 18:06:00,350, You can also try the weatherproof heat shrink tubing at CTC. As you heat it a glue melts and encloses the entire splice. I've been using it for all my splices for about 3 years and it seems to hold up great.
470563,JohnF,2010-05-28 20:30:00,3494,"I don't know the answer to this. That's why I'm asking. And if anyone thinks this is a great idea and wants to market it, be my guest.  Does anyone make a two part kit of heat shrink flat material. I envision two flat pieces or or one piece folded over to cover both sides of the connection or whatever. Then a heat source is used to make the two pieces bond together and shrink to a snug fit.  JF"
470624,aplumma,2010-05-29 00:19:00,6896,You can use hot melt glue to encapsulate the joint ( same glue you use to install replacement tips on a fishing rod). As it cools you can form it with your fingers to make it neater.   Art
470630,vinnimon,2010-05-29 00:32:00,2593,"Heat shrink tubing is what we use at work, as well as heat shrink butt connectors."
470632,vinnimon,2010-05-29 00:36:00,2593,Y splice with shrink tubing should do it.
470680,OhioFisherman,2010-05-29 03:42:00,6623,"Personally I would go with the liquid electrical tape. They used it on the trailers at work. If you have ever seen a semi going down the road the electrical connections around the tandems are covered in water anytime there is a good rain.  Any repairs our mechanics had to make usually involved a butt connector and liquid electrical tape. They didn`t bother with heat shrink tubing or regular electrical tape. Wal-Mart here in the States sells it, at least in my area."
