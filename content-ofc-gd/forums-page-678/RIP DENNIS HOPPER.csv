470797,DMASSE,2010-05-29 21:29:00,420,"Hello  JUST A FYI  Dennis Hopper, known as the rebel of Hollywood for films such as Easy Rider and Rebel Without a Cause, is dead at age 74.  My thought are with you and your family  Dave"
470802,Joey,2010-05-29 21:37:00,9122,Bummer!  Gary Coleman also died.  Whatchu talkin bout Willis!!  They will both be missed.
470809,canadadude,2010-05-29 21:46:00,769,"That the #3 Art Linkletter, Gary Coleman, Dennis Hopper maybe Hollywood can rest easy for awhile"
470812,SlowPoke,2010-05-29 21:53:00,2984,If he was in his grave he would have just rolled over. He is so bitter about that quote and being typecast in that roll that it nearly drove him insane. Poor guy just couldn't grasp that there is a limited number of rolls for him. I always got the impression listening to interviews that he felt owed.
470814,canadadude,2010-05-29 21:56:00,769,"He felt owed alright his mother stole $4,000,000 off him a blew it all, I guess he may have been alittle bitter especially we found himself working as a security gaurd for $7/hr"
470816,irishfield,2010-05-29 21:58:00,26272,"Dang.. that was just room and board canadadude... thinking of billing my 27 year old son for similar!  Hooper was one of my all time favourite actors. Coleman, well.."
470821,SlowPoke,2010-05-29 22:04:00,2984,I'd be pissed too but taking it out on everyone in his vicinity had left him lonely and angry.
470826,canadadude,2010-05-29 22:18:00,769,"He ended up getting married to a nice younger women, but ya he was pretty bitter. I guess when your own mother jacks all your $$$$$$$$ it's a tough thing to get over in away I can understand his feelings  Sorry Garry the money is all gone.......watchoo talk'in bout moma"
470833,Terry,2010-05-29 22:32:00,14456,not Dennis  I thought he would scare the reaper away  I like his acting
