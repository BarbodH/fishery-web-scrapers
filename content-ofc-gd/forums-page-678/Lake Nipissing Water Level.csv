470133,canadadude,2010-05-27 13:19:00,769,"Just going to throw this out there, perhaps this isn't the right thread. If the walleye fishing is slow in the more traditional areas, perhaps you may want to try for suspended fish over the deepest parts of the lake. I heard a bunch of theories this past winter that the walleye are changing there feeding habits with an abundance of smelt in the system.It maybe time especialy with low water levels to get out the in-line boards, line counter reels and such and start fishing for suspended fish.I would be interested to see any results and perhaps the theory of the fish changing there feeding habits can be proven.Who knows someone may just discover an incredible fishery thats been there all the time"
470152,Jonny,2010-05-27 14:11:00,1380," That's a very interesting thought. Sure would be worth trying.  As for the water level affecting the fishing, I personally don't believe that can be the case. The fish will be feeding as they always do, just maybe not in some of the ""traditional"" places. What does a pickerel care if the water is 2 feet down when there are still plenty of places where it can find its preferred depth."
470164,capt_hooked,2010-05-27 14:30:00,212,"Re: conditions on the West Arm of Nipissing..  Things are indeed very dry up north..  However our docks and boat launching are still usable. We have done some renovations to accomodate the conditions, by lowering our ramps and also have a couple new floating docks on order. A few of our shore docks are not usable but most of the outer docks are in good shape.  New rocks to watch out for on Nipissing.. pay close attention to the hydrographic maps (on sell at the lodge). Go slow.  Expect lots of weed growth in the shallow bays. Don't be surprised to see jelly fish!~  Water temps are now over 73F.  Fire condtions are serious... refer to: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/AFFM/2ColumnSubPage/268862.html   The biggest concern for the OFC weekend may be that campers have to use propane for cooking. As one week ago we are under a ""restricted fire zone"" and no camp fires are allowed. But the OFC weekend is still almost 4 weeks away and weather can change.  Fish are biting pretty good. Walleyes were hot opening weekend and slowed down some this past weekend. However we were catching both walleys and pike off the docks. Both pike and walleye turned on in Muskrat the last few days.   the cap't"
470172,canadadude,2010-05-27 14:47:00,769,"The water levels can concentrate the baitfish and food in different parts of the lake which will change the feeding patterns of the walleye.If the walleye can suspend around a school of smelt comfortably there more then likely to concentrate there feeding there instead of traditional shoal type areas.Your right the walleye are going to feed no matter what the lake levels are,but if the shoals are not giving them there comfort they will change there habits.Anyway it's just a thought, the fish gotta be somewhere"

Adjusted my depth trolling and got a few that way.  Here is an article from the Sudbury Star. It was posted 3 months ago. but explains it. http://www.thesudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2437149

Open the dams and the water goes down... guessing wrong and leaving a lake the size of Nip more than two feet down, is grounds for an inquiry in my mind. I was shocked by all of the land locked docks I saw up there this weekend. I would suspect that many who own there, won't be visiting much this summer as they will have to hire a Sherpa to get their stuff from their boats to their cottages. The economic impact to the area will be very significant. HH"
469589,Raf,2010-05-25 19:26:00,3495,"HH, an inquiry with mother nature?  they drain the lake in the fall to a level that will be 'safe' in the spring given average rain/snow based on years of history. we're nowhere near the point of predicting how wet/dry the winter will be!   Let's say they guess wrong and we have an unusually wet winter.  You open the dams and flood everyone down below?  Nip is part of a watershed not the watershed.  btw, nip has been lower."
469599,Headhunter,2010-05-25 19:47:00,5703,"And lack of water in the French has been an on going problem since I can remember, way back to the early 70's.

469682,Bernie,2010-05-25 23:26:00,3190,If it ever was that low it had to be some time ago. Been on the lake all my life and my dad as well. Neither of us remember it being this low. Was there a date of when this happened?
469688,Raf,2010-05-25 23:48:00,3495,i'd have to go through year by year.  they've been keeping records since the '30s.
469693,Raf,2010-05-26 00:10:00,3495," the ""low"" line represents historical lows.  for the period of may 1 to about aug 1, 1999 was the lowest in history.  it wasn't much above the historical lows for the remainder of the year."
469729,JimC,2010-05-26 02:32:00,86,"Historical Lows ?    same as 1999?     whatever ... what bothers me is that I have been regularly checking this forum (specific to Lake Nipissing)  since the Walleye opener,  and not hearing much news,  or seeing many pictures about 'howz the fishing been' ?  My buddies and I have been coming up to Nipissing for the last 14 years for a week in late May / early June,  so that includes 1999. We are back again in 4 more sleeps.   I don't have a good recollection of how we did that prior low-water year,  but I think it was pretty poor.  Please throw us a bone or two ... eg.   We fished around the Hardwoods for two days and caught one perch  or ""We limited in 15"" Walleye before Breakfast""  Is it that Dead in NW Arm of Lake Nipissing this year?

469754,wankerjohn123,2010-05-26 05:06:00,117, Man... that water is low. Stayed there a few years back. Staying at Promised Land Camp this year near Wayde's Landing. Did you happen to look down towards Hunter's Bay South Shore area?
469762,lew,2010-05-26 08:47:00,12766,"Thanks for that picture nuker, it really put's the low water levels in perspective.  I'll be on the West Arm for a week in July and then another week in August, but unless things change big time, it looks like I may be bringing an air mattress rather than my boat."
469801,Nipfisher,2010-05-26 12:24:00,2449,"It may be a bit of a drive but will save you alot of hassle. Regardless of where you are staying trailer your boat to a government dock. The ones at Sturgeon Falls, Calander Bay and North Bay marina are all in good shape for launching. Water is still crazy low but the launches are deep enough to get in and out quick. North Bay Marina will cost you $7-$10 but the others are free."
469805,Jonny,2010-05-26 12:38:00,1380," I would prefer that they check the snow accumulation during the winter and adjust the draw-down accordingly.  The level falls during the whole of the time the ice is on the lake. When they can see, part way through the winter, that even with a March storm or two the run-off will be way less than normal, they should be adjusting the draw-down accordingly."
469827,Bernie,2010-05-26 13:28:00,3190,The history on the water level must be skewed in some manner. If the level was any lower than it is now I would not have been able to use my boat or even park it in the boathouse. Certainly would remember that.

466452,Jonny,2010-05-14 13:56:00,1380," You mean open the Chaudiere (Nipissing) dam? Hell, most of Nipissing would be mud flats! (exaggeration)  I just bought a paddle boat from a neighbour a few cottages down, and to get it from his place to mine I dragged it in a few inches of water where normally there's about 2 to 2 1/2 feet at this time of year. It was constantly getting hung up on the bottom. Then my wife and I had to lift it for the last 20 feet to get it onto my boat ramp.  Nipissing has given all it can to the French."
466455,Raf,2010-05-14 13:58:00,3495,"I understand that Jocko.. gotta balance the needs of both the lake and river.  edit:   just remember nip, was a mudhole before the dams (7' lower on avg). one could say the reverse is true.  Have you had any meaningful rain in the last week?"
466457,Jonny,2010-05-14 14:12:00,1380," Well, I was fishing my current area of the lake in the 50's as a little kid and the water level was the same as the normal water levels for this area nowadays. I don't know if the 'mudhole' thought would hold water (joke), as I think the gov't docks in North Bay pre-date that by many decades. I think the lake was better off when the Chaudiere was just a spill dam instead of a water-control dam. Or maybe even when there was no dam at all, but that's just a guess.  I wonder if the Chief Commanda II has enough water to operate from the gov't dock this year?  We had a heavy snowfall a few days ago, and some rain here and there (it's raining now), but we'd need some real downpours, and consistent ones, over the entire watershed, to make a difference."

Over the last 5 or 6 years of fishing the west arm & west bay; I was starting to feel comfortable of where and what was safe water. I guess I’ll be going back to sitting on the edge of the seat and starring at the graph; trying not to introduce the skag of the motor to anymore chunks of Canadian Shield. That’s the only thing I hate about the power trim on this Honda motor; the hydraulics won’t allow the motor to kick up, if you tag something. With my old Suzuki manual trim; I could leave the motor unlocked and if we did hit a rock, it would just lift and skid; it did scare the crap out of you, if you forgot and stuck the motor in reverse.

Boat flew right over it as we didn't see it because it was floating level with the surface..NO damage at all to the boat or motor as the motor hit it and flew right out of the water...I didn't think it would do that either...NOW here's the one that DID HURT and RIGHT AT Memquist Lodge you speak of...fishing 3 days out towards the lake and following and watching for the milk jugs someone was kind enough to mark a shallow reef...no problem until day four when I tried to go through that same area from a different angle and I was steering clear of the milk jugs while looking at the distance tree line where I wanted to start my drift...well going about 25 mph I hit solid rock and again the motor flew up and out of the water, only this time I knew I was in trouble...I was afraid to power lift the motor up thinking I knocked off the whole lower unit...powered it up and I did MAJOR damage to the prop and minor damage to the skeg but I had to limp back to the lodge and called it a day...the next day we were leaving so it wasn't too bad fishing wise...that is the first time I ever did any damage to any of my props or motors and I have had this boat 25 years now....$100 for a new prop and I was good to go.

466650,Jonny,2010-05-15 00:27:00,1380,"I used to fish the Lavigne/West Arm area quite a bit. The lower water level should not prevent you from getting out around the Hardwood Islands (i.e. Little Oak Island) and deeper water. I would recommend a hydrographic map because even in the best of times you have to watch out for shoals in some places.  In my opinion, as long as you can launch your boat and get out into roughly the center of the channel, I don't think you'll have any trouble. I've used that boat launch, but never in water this low, so I don't know about that, sorry. "

Seems hard to believe, but I suppose it could be. Thing is, it seems to me that even in the 50's there should have been areas where flooded timber was still showing, and I can't recall that being obvious."

465870,Rich Clemens,2010-05-13 09:44:00,3131,"Man O Day, it sure looks like people are going to be hurtin' big time with levels like that.  Sure hope the rain gods are kind to you folks .... soon."
465877,Marty,2010-05-13 10:25:00,873,"Jason is right Lew, that's Sandy Haven.   I'm crossin' my fingers.   I fear I may get introduced to some new rocks that I didn't know existed over the last 30 years."
465879,Roy,2010-05-13 10:34:00,13728," You're certainly right about that, Rich. But I can't help but think how good they have it compared to the poor folks in the Gulf. Sure mother nature will throw us a curve ball from time to time but this gulf stuff is all about greed and greed will be the end of us."
465893,Spiel,2010-05-13 11:29:00,9065,It might be a real plus for those who want or have to do any dock repairs.
465901,Oeey3109,2010-05-13 11:53:00,15,"How do you guys think the low water levels will affect the fishing on the Upper French?  Obviously navigation will be mopre difficult, but will it really change the fishery and the patterns much?  I'm heading up in early June...any input is appreciated.  Thanks!"
465910,Billy Bob,2010-05-13 12:32:00,5865,In reservoirs I have fished I always found low water levels seemed to make the bite much harder where high water levels were always good for me.
465918,Slimeball,2010-05-13 12:57:00,30,"For the most part, I have experienced good fishing when the water levels are low on the Upper French/Nipissing watershed.......then again, I have never seen them this low in the past 20 years. I will be more concerend about the current weather patterns when I am up there. As for changing the fishery, I don't know other than this is not a good spawning year for the walleye, pike, musky....... GCiotola, what species will you be targeting when your up?"
465929,Guest nuker,2010-05-13 13:39:00,0,"eeesh. i'm heading down there on wednesday to kick off the long weekend.  staying at cosy cove cottages in trillicum bay i think.  it's going to be a big disappointment if these water levels make our fishing harder, and cause damage to our boats!  we were looking at that big bay of islands to the southwest but with these water levels, i have a feeling we'll be losing props.  any suggestions as to where we should look to fish given the situation would super appreciated!"
465934,robertag,2010-05-13 13:51:00,42,"I'm heading up to the French river as well next week.  Commanda island, specifically. Definitely anxious to hear what the conditions are like."
465937,Slimeball,2010-05-13 13:58:00,30,"Lower French is extremely low. If your'e staying at Cranes Lochaven, you should give them a call to get a report."
465942,Marty,2010-05-13 14:08:00,873,The weed growth should accelerate and it will be pretty thick by summer.   You may see some more developed beds in June.
465965,Oeey3109,2010-05-13 15:01:00,15,I'll be primarily targeting Pike and Musky...but we fish for walleye in the evenings.
465967,robertag,2010-05-13 15:06:00,42," Yeah, I think I'll do that early next week. Not that it'll make much difference, I'm going regardless."
465972,Slimeball,2010-05-13 15:21:00,30,"Like Marty said the weed growth should be in good shape by early-mid June this year. For pike I like the Rapala Husky Jerk model-HJ14, the Rapala 4 3/4"" X-Rap, Rapala Glidin' Rap, Storm paddletail plastics,Mepps #5 spinners....dont forget spoons and spinnerbaits. As for musky the season does not open till' the third Saturday in June. It is illegal to target out of season fish even if you plan on releasing them. Good Luck and be safe."
465974,Jonny,2010-05-13 15:29:00,1380,"The lake level has only come up negligibly in the last month. A couple of cm maybe.  We're in big trouble for launching a boat where I am.  But the fish, if I can get to them, will still be biting. They gotta eat. Aside from the spawn, I don't think they care too much about the lake level; they'll just shift to their preferred depth and structure in other places."
466003,Raf,2010-05-13 16:40:00,3495, I sent Eddy an email to see what conditions are like. I will update you. The PWGC site says the Lwr French is nearly 100cms (1 metre) below normal at Dry Pine.  Open the locks!!!!
466009,Bernie,2010-05-13 16:52:00,3190,Nothing coming in....nothing going out. The main lake is well over 2 ft low as yet. What is really worrying me is what will happen mid summer when the lake naturally goes down even further. Not going to be good.
466015,Billy Bob,2010-05-13 17:02:00,5865,The rain will come and probably when you really don't want it....here's it's been raining for almost a week now and everyone here is SICK of it...suppose to be sunny Sat/Sun..hope so as my deck has been washed and needs a clear coat for protection. I haven't fished since opening weekend...May 1st.  Bob
466067,Headhunter,2010-05-13 18:53:00,5703,They should just drain Temagami! It's not like there's any fish in it anyway!  HH

466211,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-13 22:32:00,0,look at it this way. It will be better fishing with less area to fish.
466214,Billy Bob,2010-05-13 22:38:00,5865,"Randy, HI....  I have fished the Sturgeon River several times in the late 70's and early 80's....I thought the river pretty much ran north and south making the sides West and East... we use to stay at a place called Nippressing Lodge (or something like that) that was I would say on the East side of the river...please correct my ignorance.The owners were native Canadians, at least the man (Jim I think) was and his wife's name was Jane. GREAT host as they would, back then keep a stash of extra cases of beer for sale for us crazy Americans that they knew would run of good cold CANADIAN BEER...:<)  Bob"
466342,Nipfisher,2010-05-14 03:41:00,2449,"Billy Bob,  Randy is referring to the north side of the lake. You are correct, the river runs North / South.  The North shore of the lake (on which the City of North Bay is located) is very shallow. With the lack of water this year the entire side of the lake is struggling for launching boats. Regulars who have paid for boat slips (some costing $600+ per year)  will have to keep them out of the water for a bit yet.  Only 8"" of water where my slip is. My trailer is at Glenrock which Randy mentions. We have at least 40 extra feet of beach. I'll take a few pics this weekend.  I will leave my 17' boat at home in my driveway and try the shoals and weedbeds in close to shore out of my 9' punt boat.  For the long weekend I'll use the river to access the lake. VERY CARFULLY I MIGHT ADD."
450157,kickingfrog,2010-03-31 00:31:00,8333, I wonder if that spot I grouse hunt up there will be dry this fall. First time for everything eh?

452624,Bernie,2010-04-06 16:27:00,3190, Not looking too good at this point Jocko. I can run my old cedar strip but even that is kicking up mud in our creek. I feel for all the tourist operators that are in shallow bays and creeks. We really need some rain badly !
452633,tb4me,2010-04-06 16:56:00,3295,Gey any rain there overnight lastnight and today? Got quite a bit lastnight here in Brantford
452648,Jonny,2010-04-06 17:40:00,1380," Send some rainy thoughts my way too, Bernie! We need some heavy rain all over the watershed to get the level up. If I tried to launch my boats right now, they'd be sitting on sand. And they're both too heavy to drag 100 yds or so to water.    We're only getting little sprinkles here and there, tb4me. Nothing of consequence. If we're lucky, the rain forecast for Friday will be one of those steady all-day rainfalls...  "

452795,Jonny,2010-04-06 23:15:00,1380,It's raining!!! And coming down pretty nicely too.  You can't believe how much we need this. Radar shows good rainfall north of us in the watershed as well. And the forecast is rainy for the next 3 days. Fingers crossed!  
453187,tb4me,2010-04-07 20:59:00,3295,well how much fell up there? we have had more than our share here! Water levels on the grand are high around here. Was in Dunville this aft. looked fast n furious.
453202,Jonny,2010-04-07 22:06:00,1380,"Not all that much, I'm afraid. And the dry ground soaked most of it up. It rained heavily off and on for a few hours but then kind of petered out.  We now have a winter storm watch - freezing rain, snow and ice pellets in the forecast now for overnight and tomorrow. But who knows how much we're gonna get.  Feels strange to be coming into spring and hoping for bad weather!!!  Still no water coming over the Sturgeon Falls dam when I passed by it an hour ago."
454169,Jonny,2010-04-10 02:49:00,1380,"Official ""ice off"" day was declared as yesterday, April 8th.  We've gotten enough rain and snow in the last two days that the fire bans in our region should be eased.  The creeks are up, better water flow into the lake, and the lake is up slightly. It's too early to be optimistic; the next few days should tell what the effect has been."

What I'm trying to figure out is whether the current low water situation is the worst we will have seen or not?    I recall quite a number of years ago,  there was very low water,  and the Camp owner had to build temporary docks.   Seemed like it was around 3ft below the top of the black water marks on rock faces nearby.   I think we still caught a reasonable amount of Walleye during the week,  but the memory fades.  The last three years with higher than normal water,  and very Cold,  we haven't fared too well, in the Walleye dept.  What's the consensus from you local folks?    Is this the lowest water in memory for this time of year?    Will it help or hurt the first couple of weeks Walleye (or Pickerel as I call them ... hey, I was originally from North Bay)?    I'm assuming the water will be way warmer than last year, despite the cooler temps the last week or so,  which usually helps the 'bite'  from my experience.  thanks for the pictures and updates folks.  the pics of the Sturgeon Dam (close to our Camp) are striking."

This is the summer my wife have planned to start a serious cottage hunt and Nip is one of the areas we want to look at. I'm even thinking I might also set up a branch real estate office for myself so I'll have something to keep me occupied besides fishing. If any of you know of any modest places for sale let me know. I don't necessarily have to be on a lake. I kinda like the idea of trailering the boat around a bit to explore different spots. And if you think you need a new real estate office in the area let me know. I promise to be on my best business behaviour.  JF"

448428,crosshairs,2010-03-26 16:02:00,55,"The problem with this low water is the walleye won't get to their spawning sites, then they will raise the water after the spawn putting the eggs in water that maybe too deep for their survival. Hope we get some rain prior to the spawn."
448429,Raf,2010-03-26 16:07:00,3495," it's a catch 22.. if they hold onto the water in nippissing, then there is not enough in the french and the same thing happens there."
448432,Jonny,2010-03-26 16:22:00,1380, As I understand it there is a binding agreement in place that guarantees a maximum and a minimum water flow to stakeholders on the French River. (Apparently put in place when the Chaudiere Dam was built?) There is no such guarantee for stakeholders on Nipissing. That has an impact as well.

""Lake Nipissing and French River Recorded Water Level Forecast  The following is the water level forecast for Lake Nipissing and the French River as of Monday, March 22, 2010 as provided by Public Works and Government Services Canada. The precipitation for March, as of March 22, is 0.2% of the monthly average . The inflows into the lake are currently above the long-term average inflow. Lake Nipissing  As of March 22, 2010 the water level elevation of Lake Nipissing was 194.92 metres. The lake level is 30 centimetres above the long-term average. The lake level is expected to rise during the next few days. Further change in the lake level is dependent on the amount of inflows and precipitation . French River  At Dry Pine Bay, the river level on March 22, 2010 was 180.72 metres , which corresponds to a flow of 84 cubic metres per second . The river level is 56 centimetres below the long-term average, which corresponds to a flow of 104 cubic metres per second below the long-term average. The river level is expected to be stable during the next few days. Further change in the river levels will be dependent on the amount of inflows and precipitation .  The next update will be on Monday, March 29, 2010. """

Also, I can't for the life of me see that the lake at this particular time is a foot above any long term average, even for the end of winter. I'd be able to walk half way to North Bay!"

The current level by itself is not a cause for concern. The concern is that there is no snow left in the bush, like there normally is.

447330,Ron,2010-03-24 00:36:00,1683,Things might look bad at the moment but I bet the water levels will still come up by the season opener.  *Note to self* - go to Sturgeon Falls and find the rock that is 85% exposed for a great walleye spot.
447356,Terry,2010-03-24 01:11:00,14456,grass and things will start growing there bugs and what not will start living there when the levels come back up fishing will be better then ever  you just need to look at the bright side..............

447360,Daplumma,2010-03-24 01:15:00,1961,Will be bringing the jet boat up there to the GTG in june.Only need 4 inches of water in plane.The pike tourney is ours cause the prop boats won't be able to get to the good spots! Joe
447426,Jonny,2010-03-24 02:52:00,1380," Like I said, it's not particularly unusual that the water level is low right now --- it often is at this time of year. However, if I'm judging it correctly the strongest spring run-off is already over, when usually it hasn't even peaked yet. We have NO snow left in the bush, and in all of March so far we have had ONE day of light rain!  Other people who have been living at the lake longer than I have are worried as well."
447427,Dara,2010-03-24 02:57:00,3052,  Is it gonna adversely affect the walleye fishing in front of North bay this may opener? I plan on fishing then with my daughter and don't want to be bummed out.  It hasn't rained a drop here yet either...like a winter drought
447443,Jonny,2010-03-24 03:28:00,1380," ""Here"" I think for you is the Soo, right?  I don't fish all that close to North Bay so I'm just guessing, but I think that as long as you can make it out through shallow water near the shore, the pickerel will be doing what they always do, just maybe in different spots because of the lower water levels. Your depth finder will be your best friend.  Here where I am, I'm mentally preparing myself for insufficient water to launch my 16' fiberglass boat, and hoping that my 15' aluminum won't be too much trouble to get out. The picture in the lead-off post is taken from my front deck; from that you can get an idea of what we might have to contend with. I'm keeping my fingers crossed though, and trying to hang on to some optimism!"
447534,Double What??,2010-03-24 12:41:00,29,"Hi all,  For what it's worth, the water level on Nipissing this past Monday was 6cm (just under 2.5 inches) higher than it was on Monday, March 23/09 and is trending sharply upward (yes, I track it. Sick... I know!      ).  Of course, the big difference this year is the lack of snow this season so... we'll see how it goes.  I do recall the water levels early last season being very high.  DW"
447584,Jonny,2010-03-24 14:23:00,1380," Thanks for the info, DW.  I looked up a graph which illustrates what worries me.  Apparently the current inflow is above the long term average but that is because normally the heavy melt is usually just beginning, whereas this year I think that the melt (such as it has been) has already taken place. Looking at the steepest rise in lake level for 2009 (corresponding to the heaviest inflow), it was about the first week of April 2009. I tried going back to 2008 for more comparison but the graph wouldn't load.  I'm afraid that what we'll see this year is almost a ""flat-lining"" of the lake level. The dam at Sturgeon Falls only has one chute open, and if I recall correctly the Sturgeon River accounts for about 60-70% of all inflow. Duchesnay Creek's usual spectacular waterfall is a fraction of what it usually is when the spring runoff is heavy, and it's already diminishing. There's no more snow in the bush. I think the heaviest inflow is already over.  Click to enlarge:  "
447689,John the Fisherman,2010-03-24 19:00:00,45,"I am begining to think this may affect walleye spawning.  There will be (is) little run off for the spawn to occur.  The walleye could suspend their spawn for the year, as they may not be ready to spawn at the time when run off is highest. As for fire season.  If I was still working fire I would be counting on having a good summer making some coin.  Fire rangers think the opposite of the general public as far as forest fires are concerned.  Let er burn."
447697,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-24 19:31:00,1362,Here's a good site to monitor water levels...jsut select your Province and then body of water that you're interested in...  http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formnav.asp?lang=0
447723,Jonny,2010-03-24 20:52:00,1380," Thanks, TMH, that's the site that I got the graph from. It's very useful for recent conditions, but disappointingly it only gives active graphs for the lake for this year and last year."
447725,Jonny,2010-03-24 21:04:00,1380,"I stopped at the Duchesnay Falls today to take a couple of pictures.  The water in summer only comes down a western falls, but in spring it opens up a channel to an eastern falls as well.  In spring the western falls is usually a raging torrent for a few weeks, and the eastern falls has a LOT of water coming over it as well. But right now, the western falls is already tailing off, and the eastern falls has almost dried up.  Western falls today (March 24th):  "
447726,Jonny,2010-03-24 21:06:00,1380,Eastern falls today (March 24th):    This should normally be at a rolling boil around this time.
447824,Bernie,2010-03-25 00:45:00,3190,It looks like a banner year for prop rebuilders at this point in time around here. We may be in trouble.
447826,irishfield,2010-03-25 00:49:00,26272,"Temagami is apparently a foot or more lower than usual for this time of year... but I'm told there is still lots of snow North of Diamond Lake up in the higher ground, so hopefully that will top Temag up and it will come down the river into Nippissing in time."
447893,Jonny,2010-03-25 02:40:00,1380," I hope you're right and that the upper part of the drainage basin still has a significant supply of run-off. But we need the lake to rise about a meter, which is a hell of a volume of water for a big lake like Nipissing."
447917,Muskieman,2010-03-25 03:50:00,2472," I hope you're right and not my brother in law... he was up to KL and Temag today and stopped in after supper apparently the creeks and rivers are low up there as well and the snow is very crystal like the deepest spot he found was about 4"" not a good sign WE NEED RAIN!!  .  My Walleye rock-pile is now exposed 90% Sturgeon River dropped another 6"" or more... the 1 and only gate that was opened is now closed and Generation Station is running @ 50%... I hope that they're trying to hold back some water for later. RFS "
