470610,Ron,2010-05-28 23:29:00,1683,"http://www.northumbe....aspx?e=2594616    Bluegill are not in decline   Posted By Ron Reyns  Posted 2 days ago   I am writing this letter for my concerns with Rice Lake and some of the proposals that have been brought forth by Northumberland County and some members of the Rice Lake Tourist Association.  First let me introduce myself.  My name is Ron Reyns, as a youngster, I spent most of my time on the water of Rice Lake. The first fishing experience I remember is fishing off the Government dock in Gores Landing on Rice Lake. One of the most memorable moments was going to the local resort (then called Chickadee Cottages) and renting a boat at the age of 9 or 10. Somehow the owner felt that the only 5 dollar bill I had in my pocket was just enough for me to rent a boat for the afternoon, this also included a dozen worms. I have the owner of this resort to thank for the passion I have in fishing. This has grown to the point where I now spend in excess of 100 days each year pursuing this passion. With my passion for fishing, I have been a volunteer working on various projects with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) for over 25 years. This is my way of putting something back into what I get so much enjoyment out of. My most recent volunteer time was being a former member with the pilot project for Fishery Management Zone (FMZ) 17 Advisory council for the past 3 years.  This council was 1 of 3 pilots for the OMNR. The OMNR invited various stakeholders in every aspect surrounding not only Rice Lake but all of the areas within FMZ 17. The stakeholders who obliged to attend these meetings were as follows  Buckhorn District Tourist Association  City of Kawartha Lakes Tourism  Cold Creek Fly Fishers  Competitive anglers  Crowe Lake Waterways Association  Curve Lake First Nation Federation of Ontario Cottage Associations  Live bait industry  Muskies Canada  Ontario BASS Federation Nation  Ontario Chinese Anglers Association  Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters  Peterborough Field Naturalists  Recreational anglers  Rice Lake Tourist Association  Trent University    In my 3 year term, we discussed many issues pertaining to all of the Kawartha Lakes, Trent Severn Waterway, Crowe River watershed and coldwater streams within FMZ 17. Once we, the council, came up with suggestions/proposals/recommendations, they were then submitted to public meetings where the general public was invited for their input. A survey where people could fill out and send in electronically or by mail was also available to the public. There was an Environmental Registry Notice as well; EBR Registry Number: 010-5587. All of this information was considered to create what are now the new fishing regulations.  Bluegills are not in decline, it's the size of these pan fish that changes when too many fish are harvested. Rice Lake used to have a great abundance of Bluegill 25cm (10 inches) long back in the early 1980's, actually considered non existent now. Rice Lake used to have a great abundance of Bluegill in the 23cm (9 inch) range back in the late 1980's, these are considered a rarity in this day and age. A trophy Bluegill in Rice Lake is now considered to be 20 centimetres (8 inches). It only took 20 yrs to drastically reduce the size of a Bluegill by 5 centimetres from a lake that was once considered a trophy Bluegill fishery. The average size of Bluegill has increased in size which is supported by the OMNR data, is merely .03cm over a 5 year term. With an increase of 3mm in 5 years, it will take more than 25 years to get the size of these fish back to what they once were. You cannot go by data shown by ""hearsay"". Opinions don't hold an edge when it comes to regulation changes. Rice Lake Bluegill are showing more signs of stress from harvest than the other lakes in the zone, and therefore is most in need of a regulation to enhance the quality of the fishery. Members of the advisory council were in total agreement that new regulations were required to improve the quality of the fishery on Rice Lake, and protect quality fisheries in the rest of the zone. Admittedly, we had difficulty agreeing just what this new regulation should be.  Some members of the RLTA are suggesting that the limit be increased from 300 to 500 sunfish. This proposal, including a size regulation allowing no harvest of sunfish larger than 18 cm (7 inches) was discussed by the FMZ Council. So were other regulations such as a limit of 50, and as few as 25. The limit of 500 with zero over 18cm (7 inches) received the most votes but it was still clear there was no consensus of this proposed limit.  The limit of 300 with 30 over 18cm was set by the ministry to address the different perspectives on Sunfish, including the local economy. The reasoning for 30 over 18cm was to allow the newly recruited anglers (kids for an example) to be able to harvest fish without the concern of understanding the regulations. For anyone that has ever fished, chances are the first fish you caught was a Sunfish, high in abundance and used to be big in size.  Rice Lake as well as the rest of FMZ 17 and it's neighbouring zone, FMZ 18, have some of the highest possession limits set on Sunfish, not only in Ontario or Canada, but in all of North America. This provides our tourist operators with an opportunity to attract U.S. anglers. Some lakes in North America have a harvest limit set for Bluegill as low as 5.      The majority of the stakeholders were in agreement with winter ice fishing, including the Rice Lake Tourist Association representative. Before the Council made this recommendation, we discussed concerns about the potential for increased poaching of walleye, The majority opinion was that extending the fishing season does not open the lake to any more poaching than what is going on before the regulation changes. Poaching has always and will always be a concern; this is why we have Conservation Officers. This winter, MNR frequently monitored Rice Lake as well as other lakes within FMZ 17. The Conservation Officers laid minor charges, mostly for too many lines used while angling. However, there were charges on keeping fish out of season on other lakes throughout the zone but not on Rice Lake by Conservation Officers.  The council was also concerned about the survival of Walleye caught accidentally by Panfish anglers in the winter. The MNR presented information indicating that Walleye handled properly in the winter are able to survive. This addressed the concerns of a number of council members, myself included. Rice Lake should not be considered for a Specially Designated Waterway. In comparison to all the other lakes within FMZ 17, Rice Lake is an average lake within the zone. It is not the deepest lake on the system; it is not the shallowest lake on the system. Majority of the lakes in this zone were created by the Trent Severn Waterway. The Advisory Council considered options that would treat Rice Lake differently. The Council did not support this option in part because we wanted to maintain a level playing field for tourism across the zone.  There has been media coverage of the outcries from local tourist operator organizations, pleading for action against the OMNR in regards to the regulation changes. It was also made known that various Municipalities, Townships and Counties would like to form a council with all stakeholders concerning Rice Lake. This action has already been done. In fact this action has been in operation for over 3 years. This council which is known as the FMZ 17 Advisory Council.  I would strongly encourage the municipal council to make sure they have all the information available to them before making recommendations to the OMNR on the already well discussed and well debated fishing regulations. I would also strongly encourage the council to invite the Ministry of Natural Resources to do a presentation on all the work the Advisory council has done in regards to the 2010 fishing regulations.  Sincerely,  Ron Reyns"

470629,ctranter,2010-05-29 00:28:00,543,thanks for the interesting read.  I'm not a regular on Rice lake but I was very surprised when I saw the pan fish limits compared to other lakes.  Looks like you are passionate about the cause.  I hope this raises a few eyebrows
470657,Tom McCutcheon,2010-05-29 01:47:00,627,Well said Ron.  I can't believe this horse is not dead yet...  Keep us informed please.  Tom.
470672,Rattletrap2,2010-05-29 02:54:00,1652,"Just like you Ron, i also got my start in Angling at Gore's Landing on Rice lake! It has been almost 30 years since I fished that lake, but it still holds a special place in my heart. Keep up the fantastic work you are doing. The lake will surely appreciate it!"
470674,Handlebarz,2010-05-29 03:00:00,3790,Keep up the fight Ron there are alot of people behind you who will not speak up but do support you.
