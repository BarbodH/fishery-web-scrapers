471049,fishing n autograph,2010-05-30 20:01:00,2540,Stand out on the asphault for 30 minutes and you'll really feel toasty!
471079,irishfield,2010-05-30 21:09:00,26272,Stop pulling people over David and you can enjoy the a/c in the cruiser !
471082,solopaddler,2010-05-30 21:15:00,8605,"   You've got it all wrong Wayne. Dave's a lot more likely to get pulled over himself.    (Picture perfect weather bud, enjoy it!)"
471084,irishfield,2010-05-30 21:17:00,26272,I was referring to Officer Dave.. not NWT Dave !  .. and about that boat he ripped that poor little lady off for the other day... it's on sale at CTC this week for $999.99 ($300 off!)
471097,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-30 23:17:00,10439,"  Close, but that's a different make and size. I found one made by the company that makes mine in one size smaller on sale for $999 US. I think the value to replace mine is in the $1,200 to $1,500 range."
