470782,Oggie,2010-05-29 19:47:00,588,Hi Guys. I found a container of tackle near the Eramosa River between Ospringe and Acton.   If you can give me some details I'll get it back to you. I know that sounds vague but if you lost it you'll be able to fill in the details.  Dan O.

470840,Oggie,2010-05-29 23:13:00,588,I left a box of flies in Thorbury many years ago and a guy did me the same favour.  I had my name on the box; wish this fella had done the same.  Good idea for everyone to put your name and a phone number on tackle/fly boxes. You never know.  Dan O.
470967,danbouck,2010-05-30 14:10:00,4380,Good on ya.  I almost lost 8 plano boxes full of lures yesterday when my buddy forgot to load them up  Luckily they were still there 2 hours later
