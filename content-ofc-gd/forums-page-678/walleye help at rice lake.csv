470605,FishNut,2010-05-28 23:11:00,4,"On sunday I'm taking a trip up to rice lake for walleye ( hopefully) I went once last year and had no luck.. I'm going up with my girls dad so I gotta bring him to some fish lol... Can someone give me some tips, its gonna be like 30 degrees sunday, catch and release only so any spots won't be depleted, I fish for sport only"
470608,toca,2010-05-28 23:25:00,274,"Good Luck..... Some People Where Successful On The Lake Depending Which park of the lake your going to be launching. Theres a nice place somewhere near north of bewdley around the rail road tracks that may have some. Last Year I Caught About Four Of Them(two under the slot size) but the three out of the four was caught trolling the waters. The one spot I caught with a crank bait(rapala minow) was around the rail road tracks. Another tip I heard from someone else was a jig and minow. All I can say is good luck. Might be worth buying a map of the lake that shows you the depth and common areas of where certain species of fish are(helped alot when I first came up to Rice Lake).  Cheers, Todd"
470613,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-28 23:37:00,0,"Look for decent(green) weed beds. And fish the edges of it.Jig nice and slow and if that doesn't work, jig more aggressively(with a snap).Good luck."
470646,toca,2010-05-29 01:06:00,274," Yeah What He Said.  Also Forgot To Mention The Water Level Is Kinda Low So Theres A Lotta Weeds On The Surface(over the long weekend). Dont Know What Its Is Now... Hopefully It went up?  Cheers, Todd"
470667,FishNut,2010-05-29 02:44:00,4,"Thanks guys, really appreciate it, I have a gps on my sonar, so ill be using that and gonna pick up a map, everything that I need to worry about that's not marked due to water level drop?"
470670,irishfield,2010-05-29 02:49:00,26272,"I'm really curious as to if the lake is actually low... as the Otonabee is up to the top of the banks, as of Wednesday anyhow!"
470689,Sinker,2010-05-29 06:10:00,8692,"The lake is at normal summer level.  Fish deep weed edges with deep diving cranks, worm harnesses, jerkbaits or jigs.  Where are you launching from??  S."
470736,FishNut,2010-05-29 15:05:00,4,"I'm not sure yet, have a suggestion for me? I don't mind paying a little extra but I want a good launch"
470922,Sinker,2010-05-30 04:36:00,8692,There are lots of launches. Bewdley or gores landing are probably the most common if your coming from the GTA.  S.
