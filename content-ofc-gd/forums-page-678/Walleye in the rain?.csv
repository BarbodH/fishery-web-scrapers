I have gotten lots of good suggestions from members about what to try etc. My question is, I have been seeing alot of post about how much bright sunlight effects the walleye bite negatively. How is it in rain? Looks like it is going to be cloudy and rainy next week and I was wondering if I should have a different approach or rely on different presentations more? Best colors for this type of weather? Are depths important? More jigging, trolling, or drifting? Any thoughts?  Thanks for the help!  Chris"

Head to Callander bay and drop shot a worm, minnow leech or whatever. Drift anywhere between 18 to 30+ feet. When you find the fish, stay exactly at the same depth, since all will be generally in the same area."
