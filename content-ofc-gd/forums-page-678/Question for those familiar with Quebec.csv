469758,chris.brock,2010-05-26 07:04:00,4053,Fishing trip in a week to QC. Should we buy our beer in ON or QC? I'm always trying to avoid being taxed to death. Merci
469759,solopaddler,2010-05-26 08:01:00,8605, It's considerably cheaper in QC. Wait 'till you get there.
469760,fishing n autograph,2010-05-26 08:24:00,2540,It's even better if you have a costco membership.....I think they had a deal which was something like 50 something beers that came in it's own cooler bag for about $100....  yes beer is cheaper in Quebec
469763,fish_fishburn,2010-05-26 09:11:00,1311,Costco in Quebec has 55 cans of beer for 59.oo taxes and deposit included.
469770,Paully,2010-05-26 10:26:00,712,pick some up at the local Macs Milk..
469773,Roy,2010-05-26 10:34:00,13728,"Generally speaking, wine and spirits are slightly cheaper in Ontario. Gas is usually ten cents a litre cheaper in Ontario but beer is cheaper in Quebec. You don't have to go to Costco to get a deal on beer. Most grocery/convenience stores have their own specials. The regular price for 24 bottles of Old Milwaukee here is $22 and change. I pay 28 and change, returns and taxes in."
469784,darsky,2010-05-26 11:35:00,586,Corona cs/24 is 28.99 here plus tax and dep. I heard its close to 40.00 plus tax and dep in Ont
469797,BillM,2010-05-26 12:19:00,17367,"Cheaper beer, and the help I received at a local stop near Mike's place was full of GREAT views..  "
469804,solopaddler,2010-05-26 12:36:00,8605, So true.  Shopping at that little hole in the wall is a highlight of the trip every time.
469899,chris.brock,2010-05-26 16:46:00,4053,"thanks guys, looks like we'll leave a little early and get them there, ummm, maybe stop again on the way home too, sound like a plan"
470457,fish_fishburn,2010-05-28 11:30:00,1311,"Theres a gas station in Tamiskaming we always stop at to get our beer before heading into the bush(kipiwa sec). We get our licences there as well and the great specials on beer. 24 cans of coors light for 24 bucks. Thats popular with the guys. This place even has a good selection of cigars. Cohibas, Monte Cristos etc. A cool little store."
470471,rpsmith,2010-05-28 12:13:00,28,Does this answer your question?     That's less then a dollar a beer----and it's the good stuff!!  I bought all they had for that price (6 cases).
470482,fish-miester,2010-05-28 12:57:00,864,Oh man! I was already planning on heading to Quebec within the next two months.. now you got me even more excited
470522,irishfield,2010-05-28 16:23:00,26272,I just miss the days in the valley.. when we'd take all our Ontario empties over to Hull and double our money....
470607,jjcanoe,2010-05-28 23:25:00,744,yep I drive my truck to QC and stop at the petro pass or Irving to fuel up the truck and stock up for long weekends!  jjcanoe
470616,smally21,2010-05-28 23:44:00,993,i think the easy answer to the question is beer is cheaper just about anywhere compared to ontario. enjoy the trip and by some labbats bleu!!
470617,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-28 23:51:00,10439,  UHHHHHH No!!! It's not. You can come up here to the NWT and you will see that in fact that beer is a little more $$$ up here. Ok it's a lot friggin' more. Try $65 a two four!!!!!!
