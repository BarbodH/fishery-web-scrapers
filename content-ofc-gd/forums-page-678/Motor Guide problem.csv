Is it possible that the mount is made for a longer model?  I think mine is a 42""  Is the lower unit positioned where is should be or should it be further down the scissor bracket.?  I included the top end, I don't think there are adjustments you can make at that end, the sliding piece is more of a safety thing in case you hit something ?? How tight should it be ?mg1.docmg.doc"
