469983,siwash,2010-05-26 21:41:00,683,"Hi folks,  Would like a recommendation to a good, honest marine mechanic in the GTA. Just bought a boat and need to have the engine looked at. I live near BPS but don't mind driving a little further if need be.  Seller says it bogs down if trying to rev the engine in gear. Doesn't seem to have the power to take off. Have no idea what the problem is as I am not mechanically inclined.  Thanks!"
469995,Lostchild,2010-05-26 22:17:00,153,"Personally I hope you only paid for the value of the boat and are hoping you might get away with a cheap fix and score a motor out of the deal. You could be looking at a complete rebuild (if it is worth it) or maybe just a simple carb adjustment. A compression test would at least give you an idea where the problem may lie. Canadian tire sells compression testing gauges fairly cheap, well worth the investment in my eyes, that way you could test before buying. Yes I did learn the hard way when I bought my first boat that the seller stated had a ""minor"" stalling issue!  I can't help you with a mechanic in the area, but I do wish you a simple fix! Good luck and hopefully others can recommend one."

470061,siwash,2010-05-27 01:38:00,683,Bluffers guys are also crooks.. like lots of the mechanics out there. I don't want to go there... got burned by those people in the 1990's
470065,irishfield,2010-05-27 01:41:00,26272,Choke stuck partial on... prop too coarse?  What is the engine?? I had a 5 evinrude that ran like that at times and it turned out to be the coil..

470089,John Bacon,2010-05-27 03:47:00,3277,Have you checked the plugs?  I had a lack of power problem with my Suzuki which turned out to be a defective spark plug.  If any of the plugs are wet after running the engine they are probably not firing.

470333,Big Cliff,2010-05-27 21:57:00,6899,"It's not the mechanics that you have to watch out for, most of them get paid by the hour and most of them take pride in what they do. A marine mechanic gets paid about $25.00 an hour (if he is lucky) and gets no comission on parts and supplies. The shops charge you upwards of $85.00 an hour plus make huge margins on parts and supplies. I have done jobs on equipment where I thought an honest bill would be $50.00 and watched the customer pay out well in excess of $150.00. and no, I don't work there anymore.  Your best bet is to find a qualified licensed mechanic that has a good reputation and works out of his own shop. If he doesn't have a sign up but is always busy then you know you are in the right place. That is the guy who might not be able to fix it for you TODAY but when he does fix it, you will  get a fair deal at a reasonable price."

470505,siwash,2010-05-28 14:51:00,683,"Discount? I bought a boat off them in the 90'.  lets just say I will NEVER go near that place again.  One story I will share: I got stuck on Nippissing in at 830 pm. while walleye fishing two weeks after i bought it. Was charged $300+ by OPP (tow to shore) and a ruined weekend.. we didn't get back to shore until 4 am. Had to to us to North Bay and we were staying at Sunset..   Reason? The mechanic ""accidentally"" cut/damaged some wires when installing the controls for the kicker..   You'd think he would compensate me for a lost weekend eh? We had rented a nice cottage and spent toms of money.. boat wasn't fixed for another week... we had to rent a boat the rest of the weekend. I should have taken them to court.  I better stop now cause my blood still boils  There needs to be more accountability in that industry in general"
470515,Bernie,2010-05-28 15:36:00,3190, Hey ! I take exception to that comment. I know Big Cliff is an honest guy. And my shop is busy because I am too.  Now can I retort about police officers?
470527,ecmilley,2010-05-28 17:03:00,2163,what is the engine year and model could be a 2 minute adjustment
