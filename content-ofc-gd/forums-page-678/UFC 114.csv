470796,Toddyc20,2010-05-29 21:25:00,141,Anyone have any good sites where I can watch the fights tonight?  Sites that i don't have to provide personal information like my cell number or anything?  I can't wait to see Rampage knock out Evans tonight.  Todd
470806,Twocoda,2010-05-29 21:38:00,4130,i watched 113 on veetle.com flawlessly....i hope tonights fights will be streamed on here too  i would love to see rampage win ...but ....evans is going to knock him silly....(over exaggeration)...duck and weave in and out ...sting with every hit...  Sheesh now that i told you this ...you really dont have to watch the fight ...you already know whats going to happen

470888,misfish,2010-05-30 01:50:00,29133,Seems to be alot of banner complaints. I went here and alls good.It is delayed but a ood pic.  mmator.com
470913,Gerritt,2010-05-30 03:09:00,6129,well hopefully however you are seeing it... you are seeing it!!  G
470923,Twocoda,2010-05-30 05:00:00,4130,  told ya ....  veetle wasnt good at all this time ...i watched it in HD on tenchistv...  all in all the fights were lame....but Bisbing looked pretty good
470971,Toddyc20,2010-05-30 14:26:00,141,"Yeah i wasn't overly impressed with those fights either.  The Jackson vs Evans fight was a huge let down and borderline boring for me.  I'm sure glad i didn't pay $50 to watch that.  Knockout of the night has Russow on Duffee.  That was one heck of a lucky punch.  That`s  the good thing about those heavy weights, it only takes one punch."
471027,bucktail,2010-05-30 18:55:00,1857,"Unwatchable!!!!!!!!  Is it just me or are the PPV getting worse all the time?  Man that was bad, I think I wont even be watching them anymore. Pretty disallusioned with it over the last year and a half.  "
471034,misfish,2010-05-30 19:25:00,29133," Yep, ended up there aswell.  Nog didnt deserve that win. Lucky punch,yep,but the guy could take it and got his just deserves.  Jackson was like always,trash talk and not taking out.  Bisbonggone was impressive this time and didnt trash talk after."
471036,Terry,2010-05-30 19:38:00,14456,the fights were pretty much what I expected them to be  it wasn't a real exciting night
471086,misfish,2010-05-30 21:19:00,29133," Hell, you should of been here,,,,,,,,Ahhhhhh, on second thought,maybe you shouldnt of.  Next is the Brock. That I will pay to see."
