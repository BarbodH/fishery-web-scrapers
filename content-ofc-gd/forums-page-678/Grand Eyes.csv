We were out trolling on the grand river today the bite wasn't too hot it's always fun catching the cats out of there my friend Jay caught a 19 pounder and of course we forgot the net, the bugger was tough to get in the boat, and when we finally did he crapped all over the carpet haha. Count for the day is 3 cats for the boat, a big sheepshead and 2 walleyes caught by yours truly. Also want to add that the Conservation officers were out on the boat, they checked out licenses, checked out what we had in the livewells, and even gave us a couple tips. Good to see them out there checking everyone out!  Thanks for reading guys.  "
