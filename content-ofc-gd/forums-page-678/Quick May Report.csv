My honey do list was pretty large but I persevered and got through most of it.  Managed to fish of the dock for an hour here and there.  Had problems with the boat due to a faulty battery.  Only managed a couple hours boat time. Nevertheless had some success for perch and surprisingly walleye off the dock.  This is my first year targeting them so I'm pretty happy I caught any.  First cast of the year = jumbo off the dock   Another decent perch   Tried setting up for some carp one afternoon, but had no luck calling them in.  However I did find that the miller chill is my favourite of all the ""lime"" beers I've tried.  Refreshing! p.s. I'm aware my setup is ghetto but I make do with what I got.   Another jumbo    A couple in the slot   What was this guy thinking?!  Caught quite a few decent perch and bluegills...and managed to avoid the bass for the most part.  I could have had a nice little fish fry if I was so Inclined but all were released.  Found that twitching a gold x-rap around the new weed growth off the dock was working well. Take care Mike"

471065,416angler,2010-05-30 20:35:00,14,What size is that X-rap?
471066,mbosh1980,2010-05-30 20:39:00,349,uh..medium? It's about 1/2 oz.  I was surprised at the perch that were nailing it.
