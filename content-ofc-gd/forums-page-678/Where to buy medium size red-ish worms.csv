With this dry weather they seem hard to find.  My question is: Can these worms be bought somewhere within T.O. / Mississauga? I'm not looking for the huge brown worms that can be bought just about everywhere.  Thanks Laz"

470466,laszlo,2010-05-28 11:56:00,487, I think so. They are usually only 2-4 inches long and somewhat skinny.

470476,JohnF,2010-05-28 12:28:00,3494,Rob has a couple of raised bed veggy gardens that he keeps. We just turn up a few spadefuls or even use a garden hand trowel and we get all we want. The soil is well composted and loose. He mostly uses them for his aquarium fish but we also take a few when we hit the creek.  JF
