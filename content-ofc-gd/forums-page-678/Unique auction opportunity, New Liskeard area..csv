His wife is having an auction on June 19th of his collection. I've never seen it to know if it was good stuff or junk, but if you are in the area and have a thing for machinery, I'd be there!  Thanks, Wayne Scan 001.pdf"

470871,Bernie,2010-05-30 01:23:00,3190,Are you going to be there Wayne? I'd like to find a late 50's Johnson 15 or 18 HP outboard with maroon and white colour.
470876,irishfield,2010-05-30 01:28:00,26272,I don't think so Bernie. As much as I'd like to. Appears to be no recession in aviation this yearand I still have a complete amphib float install to do yet before I can head North.  Walter was a Johnson man though... what he had on two of his boats.
470880,Bernie,2010-05-30 01:34:00,3190,Let me know if you change your mind. I'm thinking of making the trip up. May find some other stuff that may be interesting too.
470907,irishfield,2010-05-30 02:41:00,26272,I'll try to get ahold of his wife and see if there's a 15 or 18 there and maybe you can deal before hand...
470910,Bernie,2010-05-30 02:59:00,3190,Thank you Wayne. That would be much appreciated.
