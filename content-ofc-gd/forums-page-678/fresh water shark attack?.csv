470516,The JAY,2010-05-28 15:39:00,239,"Never been in Musky waters, but done a lot of pike fishing. After seeing the last baby duckling swimming in line disappear (seen it 3 times), I wouldn't dangle any body parts I was partial to in the water musky are swimming in...."
470528,smally21,2010-05-28 17:04:00,993,my first thought was of the giant muskie videotaped going after the stainless prop of a bass boat. cant help themselves.

470588,Fisherpete,2010-05-28 22:01:00,1814,Isn't that called a jerkbait?
470786,Oggie,2010-05-29 20:02:00,588,I think it's usually a large female muskie or pike in the post spawn condition.  She'll protect a territory around the area she spawned in.  The MNR knows it happens fairly regularly but they don't like to hype it or it'll turn into the bear situation.  Geez don't tell the press about this.  Dan O.
470899,wallyboss,2010-05-30 02:10:00,1095,  See that's what happens when you let somebody hold it for you. They turn around and blab about it.  Never again Jer!!!
470364,addymark,2010-05-27 23:24:00,69,"last weekend I just got back from fishing and a new neighbor approached my dad and I at the dock and said he had a good fishing story for us.  His wife was on the dock and she put her feet in the water to cool off and within seconds of entering the water something bit her foot.  She pulled out of the water with a large gash on the bottom and numerous ""needle like teeth embedded on the dorsal aspect of her foot"".  Buddy was loving the story and thought it was hilarious, his wife was in the boat and wasn't thrilled at all.  Growing up I've heard of stories of small dogs being taken by muskie, and I took those with a grain of salt.  However, I have never heard of a person getting bit before.  Now my girlfriend won't swim in the lake anymore, but when muskie season opens I know which dock I'm going target."
470369,Syn,2010-05-27 23:39:00,519,Pike or muskie or water chupacabra. hope she is ok and it did not do too much damage.
470371,Big Cliff,2010-05-27 23:43:00,6899,Saw a guy who had his hand badly torn up many years ago up in the French River. Claimed it was a big pike. Never saw the fish but his hand was shredded.
470372,Dutchy,2010-05-27 23:44:00,416,"There was a story in Britain a few years ago where a guy out in a boat in Scotland was running his had through the surface of the water when something bit him. He ended up losing a finger and it was hypothesized that it was a big pike that did it.  Certainly not out of the questions at all, I believe a muskie could do something like that."
470375,basketclam,2010-05-27 23:57:00,115,"I seem to remember a news clip from a few years back about a kid that was bit by a muskie somewhere in the Kawarthas.  Can't remember any details of the story for certain, but I think it was one quick bite and the fish was gone.  The kid had a mark, but no serious damage."
470381,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-28 00:36:00,10439," Yep, I remember that one too. I seem to remember he was sitting on the dock with his feet dangling in the water and got nibbled on."
470383,CLofchik,2010-05-28 00:39:00,854," Was it the Kawartha's or Nipissing? I remember that OOD from the 80's, guy was tubing with his daughter when a big muskie came up and bit her ankle.  The one thing I remember is that the guy was a little annoyed with the half dozen guys who were knocking on his door wanting him to point the spot out on a map"
470386,John Bacon,2010-05-28 00:51:00,3277, I remember hearing about someone getting bit by a muskie on Julien Lake a few years back.
470388,shane,2010-05-28 00:57:00,652,  Was she wearing toe-nail polish? What color?

470398,wask,2010-05-28 01:41:00,174,"  In West Virginia about ten years ago when I was writing for the newspaper there, we had some kids playing in a creek and a muskie attacked them.  Was going crazy in the water, something wrong with it.  The adult with them ended up beating muskie over the head with a board.  I don't know why it didn't just swim away, but definitely happened.  Those are tiger muskie though (pike muskie cross), but close enough to what is here."
470403,Nemo,2010-05-28 02:26:00,727,"Dodgeville, WI The story involving Dan Droessler of Platteville, Wisconsin and a hungry tiger muskie is one right out of the ""Can you believe it?"" file.  Dan was dangling his foot over the side of his canoe on Twin Valley Lake when a 36-inch muskie decided it was time for a snack.  The bite, naturally, startled Dan, who jerked his foot (and the fish) out of the water and into the canoe.  But the story doesn't end there. Sporting 60 new stitches in his foot, Dan agreed to be interviewed by a local reporter. He told the writer he kept the fish and planned to have his unusual trophy mounted.  The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources stepped in, however, confiscating the fish with the explanation that it wasn't caught on hook-and-line and that it didn't meet the 40-inch minimum length limit.  Droessler pled his case, though, and was allowed to keep the fish after paying a $10.55 special permit fee.  This isn't the first time a muskie has chomped a human. Back in 1995, a 14-year-old Minnesota boy, swimming at a public beach on Lake Rebecca, was bitten on the right hand and wrist. He was leaving the water during a routine safety break called by lifeguards when the fish attacked.  The 38-inch fish was netted by fisheries personnel and relocated to another part of the lake."
470409,ctranter,2010-05-28 02:55:00,543,"I won't let my Yorkie swim in the in Kawarthas  seriously though, some days I am desperate enough for a bite that I would gladly use my own foot as bait."
470418,OhioFisherman,2010-05-28 03:46:00,6623,"Just consider a fishes eyesight and thinking ability? If they could see all that well and think clearly a lot of us that use lures only would be in trouble? Re-action strikes, it appears to be something alive and as the top rung of the food chain they try and eat it?"
470420,Dutchy,2010-05-28 03:49:00,416, You have now
470434,Dozer,2010-05-28 04:57:00,896,"They would bite, they have attacked, wear a helmet"
470435,Dozer,2010-05-28 05:10:00,896,"... just to add to that, I've kept some cool predatory fish that really take interest to pretty much anything ddangling in the water just at the surface.  Conditioned? Quite sure of it, however they're all animals.  Count your toes!"
470438,Ben_Daniels,2010-05-28 06:11:00,435,I'd guess it was a musky... 
470445,lew,2010-05-28 10:43:00,12766,I don't think anyone should be surprised to hear about a musky latching onto a foot or hand dangling in the water. Their a very aggressive fish that will hit any sized bait they see and think nothing of grabbing a bait trolled very close to a spinning prop.  Pickeral fishermen report all the time about muskies coming right up to the boat to grab a fish off the stringer.  They have row after row of teeth that are as sharp as needles and if they latch onto your foot and you pull it back chances are your gonna have some nasty cuts to deal with.  I hand or foot dangling in the water is just a tasty little treat for a big slimer looking for a snack
470447,canadadude,2010-05-28 11:02:00,769,I've had them grab and shake the front mount trolling motor while walleye fish'in in the Kawarthas
470452,addymark,2010-05-28 11:21:00,69,"  I had that happen to me late summer last year.  fishing for bass, shook the whole boat.  thought i hit a log, when I look down there was a very large fish.   This is when I started to buy muskie tackle"
470481,OhioFisherman,2010-05-28 12:49:00,6623,"Actually had one blow past the lure I was trolling and hit the transom mounted electric motor on my dads boat, might have been attracted by the reflective tape I put on the prop?"
470488,marth11,2010-05-28 13:26:00,60,"the only muskie I ever caught was when I was a kid and we new that this muskie was living under this dock in like 3 feet of water was small only like 30"" it was quite aggressive we weren't allowed to put are feet in the water since that spot was a prime bass spot and the muskie liked toes so one time I was fishing there with a worm and float and remember I was only 8 years old at the time I tossed out the worm and a get I bite I start reeling in the bugger and the muskie out of no were just slams the fish and runs off for a good 20 yards and fought for a few and it came in, everyone at the camp was surprised.  "
470497,Headhunter,2010-05-28 14:13:00,5703,"If it swims, or in this case, is perceived as swimming, it's considered food. Simple as that. HH"
470498,fish-miester,2010-05-28 14:20:00,864,  well I hope thats the case for when I go pike fishing this weekend.. maybe I'd have better luck if all fish thought this way haha.. either that or I'll start tying on Chipmunks and squirells
