Going to go fishing for the day on Monday, anyone know of any lakes that hold them near Apsley or in the Kawartha Highlands?  Not looking to portage or anything, looking for a place with a boat launch.  Not trying to steal any secret spots either, I know how that is...  Just trying to see how prevalent the populations are.  Thanks."

I know there are lots of Perch/Sunfish and Crappie around the launch on Stoney Lake at Mt. Julian/Viamead and across the lake at McCrackin's Landing. Jack's has Perch and Crappie, but I have never fished for them there. Perch are everywhere, but there are no Crappie, that I know of, north of Jack's. Garry2R's"
