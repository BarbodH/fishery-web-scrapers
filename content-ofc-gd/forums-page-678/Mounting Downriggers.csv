452856,Sinker,2010-04-07 00:41:00,8692,"I mounted mine on a board too. I take it off when I'm not using them. My boat is a tiller, so my riggers are just ahead of me, mounted on the board permanent, with the board clamped onto the gunnels. I could have mounted them on the back corners, but with a guy on the tiller, and another guy setting up/grabbing a fish on, I didn't like the idea of all the weight in the stern of the boat. Especially if its at all rough. Works good for me.  S."
470422,siwash,2010-05-28 03:52:00,683,So what did you end up doing with the mounting job? I am curious b/c it seems that you and i have very similar scenarios! I also have a 16' aluminum and the same manual cannons.  Questions for the chap who mentioned the backing plate beneath the gunwale. I am assuming this is for strength/support. What material would you use? Are you simply cutting out a piece that is roughly the same size as the factory mounting plate?  How do you mount it (beneath the gunwale)? Are you drilling the plate into the piece of material?  Thanks!
470428,Sinker,2010-05-28 04:27:00,8692," Again, a pic would really help you, get help.  The board works best for me.  S."
470467,canadadude,2010-05-28 11:57:00,769,"The best way to mount your riggers is straight off the transom, the further back the better, side mounts work but can cause lots of problems if fishing deep 100'+ and also if trolling at high speeds 3.5mph+. The problem with the side mounting tends to be the belly of line will run under the boat on turns or contour fishing,with the riggers running straight out the back the line and cannonballs track better with boat. Your lures and lines follow the path of your boats turns alot more accuratly if run straight back off the transom  The line also clears the boat alot easier if a big King hits and goes for a run if your running off the stern."
470472,Fish Farmer,2010-05-28 12:16:00,2234,Just another idea I picked this 2X4 aluminum tubing up at Beach Road scrap metals. Plus I got a piece for my buddy's 16' at Metal Supermarket.

452298,cwpowell,2010-04-06 00:34:00,265,"Hi guys, my dad and I are getting the new boat ready for the water today. We had to rewire the aerator and bilge because the guy we bought it off of had a really shotty wiring job done. Anyway it's a 16' Starcraft aluminum. We have some Cannon Easy-troll manual downriggers we want to get mounted on it. How did y'all do yours? Whats the best way?  Thanks in advance  Charles"
452338,Fisherman,2010-04-06 01:11:00,7201,"Is it a console or tiller model?  Some  use a full side to side mount (wooden plank or actual rigger mounts) attached to the gunnels, others use individual mounts along the side, again, depends on how wide your gunnels are.  I have mine mounted on 14"" high pedestals which are bolted to a 1""x8"" maple board that spans the center bench seat. No flex action whatsoever."

452371,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-06 01:44:00,10439,"I have a side console Fisher and I mounted my easy trolls forward of the console. My boat has raised casting decks for and aft and it is safer leaning over the side where the boat is the deepest. I have never had any tangling problems in the near,y 19 years I've owned the boat. I have had the right rigger hit and watched a rainbow clear the water on the left though.     : My gunnels are wide enough to bolt the bases down without any modification or adapters. Another bonus of mounting them forward is you can watch your rods without getting neck pain from always turning around.     "
452384,cwpowell,2010-04-06 01:59:00,265,"Hey drifter, thanks for your post, it really helped. What I am looking for are those bases that you slide your driggers into that you have bolted to the gunnels."
452388,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-06 02:03:00,10439,"  They are the mounts that come with the downriggers, you will have to order them as replacement parts from a Cannon dealer.  Like here: Cannon Easitroll Mounts"
452392,cwpowell,2010-04-06 02:06:00,265,The gunnels on our boat are not wide enough so they will be bolted to the back corners of the boat.
452433,PERCHER,2010-04-06 03:06:00,787,Just don't mount them to far back.I had no other choice.
452469,POLLIWOGG,2010-04-06 04:50:00,835,"Mount a pair of sidecutters on a lanyard next to each rigger, A buddy saw 3 waves pull down an 18'er after it snagged bottom with riggers."
452494,Fisherman,2010-04-06 11:11:00,7201, That's the prime reason I will never bottom bounce or drag my cballs.  It's also wise to properly adjust the cluches or brake mechanism to allow freespool when snagged.
452495,Roy,2010-04-06 11:19:00,13728," Good tip, Fisherman."
452511,Grimace,2010-04-06 12:34:00,2020,If you are mounting it on the gunwale make sure to put a backing plate underneath.  See if you can avoid putting them at the back corner.
452557,skeeter,2010-04-06 14:05:00,1907,I would think that after the first wave or even the second wave i would have been slamming the reverse gear real fast. or even neutral.  then after that i would just throw my underwear out.
452614,BITEME,2010-04-06 16:13:00,1968,  Whats up with that there brother they put you back together wrong or what

452711,cwpowell,2010-04-06 19:41:00,265, Why avoid the back corners?
452751,PERCHER,2010-04-06 21:41:00,787,To far back on the corners makes them harder to operate.Ideal place is where you would have ample floor space to access the riggers.
452845,John Bacon,2010-04-07 00:29:00,3277, Backing up into waves is a bad idea... probably worse than having your cannon balls snagged.
