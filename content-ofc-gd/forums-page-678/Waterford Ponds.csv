470847,Stern Rules,2010-05-29 23:36:00,342,Went out today and there was a layer of algae or whatever about 10 feet out from shore and all along the north end and pannies floating everywhere. Mostly gills but there were a couple crappies. What a stink that was. Forgot to take a pic. I've never seen that there before. Does this happen every year? What killed 'em? Only seemed to be on the north side. The bite wasn't as good this week as last. What a disappointment.

470921,raptorfan,2010-05-30 04:34:00,126,I grew up in waterford and have never seen anything like that.  did you report it other than on here?
470925,Stern Rules,2010-05-30 05:58:00,342,"No, I didn't think to report it. I assumed it has happened before but I wouldn't know."
