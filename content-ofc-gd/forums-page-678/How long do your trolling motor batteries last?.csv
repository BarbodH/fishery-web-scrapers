470550,bigcreekdad,2010-05-28 19:40:00,546,"Got my first trip to the French coming up in a couple weeks, so I plugged in my Dual Pro SE charger. THe left bank shows 4 lights (which seems reasonable), but the right bank shows 3 continuously blinking lights. I've got a call into Dual Pro, but I wonder if I have a bad battery. My batteries are probably 5-6 years old, and see heavy use 2-3 weeks a year in Canada, and a few times in lakes in Michigan a year. How long do you keep yours before replacing them?  Thanks"
470566,Sinker,2010-05-28 20:58:00,8692,"I""d say you have a bad battery. Get it load tested, and you'll know for sure.    S."
470569,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-28 21:03:00,1107,CT will check it out for free in hopes you will replace it there but thats up to you.
470681,OhioFisherman,2010-05-29 03:54:00,6623,"I never tried to get that much life out of a trolling motor battery. I replaced mine every 3 years. Probably a different situation for me, I regularly fished bass tournaments and the batteries got a workout. I wasn`t gambling a 150 buck entry fee on a bad battery. LOL and less inclined to have a problem fun fishing with family or friends.  My boat didn`t have oar locks, required to carry a paddle, but I never wanted to try and row with that!"
470703,lew,2010-05-29 11:02:00,12766,"If your batteries are already 5-6 years old and your having 2nd thoughts about them now, why not just replace them both and be done with it ??  At least that's what I'd do  No sense in putting all that planning & effort, plus the expense,  into a fishing trip to the French River and then have it ruined for the sake of a couple worn out batteries.  Best of luck on your fish'n trip !!"
470706,fish_fishburn,2010-05-29 11:15:00,1311,I have the same charger on my bassboat and have never had any of the led lights blinking on and off. Not sure what that means. Dual Pro has great customer service whenever I have had to have a question answered. I have had trolling batteries last over 5 yrs and still going strong. I just swapped them out and put them in my cruiser two yrs ago and there still fine. I just didn't want to take any chances with tired batteries while fishing bass tourneys. I think the key to battery longevity is battery maintenance. Charge them back up immediately after use. Never leave them sit for any lenght of time half charged or nearly dead. The batteries I swapped out of my bassboat after five yrs were Trojan batteries. My new ones are Energizer and there on there third season and still running like new. Time will dictate if there as good as the Trojan batteries.

470732,Pigeontroller,2010-05-29 14:22:00,2793,"Do I hear a little bird...?  cheep,cheep,cheap...  LOL, just teasin ya! Listen to Lew, go get new batteries for your trip."
470733,NBR,2010-05-29 14:42:00,163,Anything over 5 years on TM batteries has been mostly luck for me.
470953,Billy Bob,2010-05-30 13:10:00,5865,"For the ""trolling motor"" I change every 4 years but my starter battery is now 9 years old...I think this could be it's last season.....anyone know where I can still get a Delco Voyager ""dual purpose"" battery ?"
471011,bassfighter,2010-05-30 17:56:00,366,"Costco battery is quite decent for the price you have to pay. Sometimes they have $10-$20 off their batteries, the price went up this year. Trolling motor battery cost $115 tax included.  I had another Sealed trolling motor battery that is still running after 5 years. I troll a lot, and few times I almost drained both batteries fishing for 15+ hours. My trolling battery is not connected to my main motor charging system. It is also a good back up, in case my main battery dies, I have my trolling motor to bail me out.  Be careful of Canadian Tire testing procedure. It is not always reliable, and depends on the person testing it. I had a working battery that I had it tested at CT just to double check, they said it was not good anymore. I then ran my trolling motor at full power with the suspected worn out battery for 6-7 hours, once in a while stopping it for 5-10 minutes to cool down the motor to ensure the motor will not get too hot. After 6 hours, it still had some juice on the battery. The battery is at least 5 years old, but well maintained, I always charge it by the time I get home from fishing. I also made sure it is clean, away from cement floor during winter months, and charge it at least once a month kept on a heated environment.  6 years ago I neglected maintaining a trolling battery, did not trickle charge it for 6 months frozen during season, did not always recharge it as soon as I finished fishing, never check the internal water level, and it died in less than 3 years."
471062,spoon,2010-05-30 20:31:00,74,"  My batteries are 4 years old. With a Terrova/Maxxum 55 one battery lasts me a whole day  I'm running regular deep cycle marine batteries  Always charge them after each use. A brand new deep cycle should last 4-6 years, return yours to CT and they will recycle yours.  I think they even have a trade in option...  Good luck"
