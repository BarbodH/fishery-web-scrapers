I installed it late last year and have now found that it ""leaks"" from the tubing that houses the control cables. It is causing a rust coloured stain on my deck. The boat is covered with a mooring cover so I donâ€™t think its rain related. Water somehow is making it up to the head and it is coming out the cable cover.  Has anyone had a similar problem? Any ideas on fixing this? I am assuming there is a seal gone somewhere but cant be sure. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks."
471012,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-30 18:00:00,10439,Is it still under warranty? I would get in touch with Minnkota. They have always been good to me when I have had issues or questions. I had an issue with the electrical connector on my old Auto Pilot and asked if they had one. They said they should have a used one in a parts bin. They sent it to me a no charge!!! They have all my business for life because of that one phone call.

471094,motion,2010-05-30 21:57:00,403,  I doubt it. Everything else under the cover seems dry. It's also more noticeable once pulled back from being in the water. Great motor other that thhe moisture issue.
