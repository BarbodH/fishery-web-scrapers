470012,pikeguy,2010-05-26 23:05:00,195,I have decided to buy a humming bird 570 fish finder I looked a CT and found it there for 289$ it has all i was looking for in a new one Then i look at BPS and they had it there but allot cheaper it was only 189$ on sale just wondering if there was a reason for such a difference in price. 100$ seems like allot to mark down  Still think i will get it from BPS for that price may take longer to get but worth the wait for sure
470019,danbouck,2010-05-26 23:37:00,4380,Because they have good sales!

470529,smally21,2010-05-28 17:07:00,993,"crappy tire has all fishfinders at 20% off right now.  big price difference between pretty similar units like the 550, 565, 570.  shop with care!"
