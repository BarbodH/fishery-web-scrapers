756743,GYPSY400,2013-01-06 10:58:00,191,"Yes, I second the spot at science north... I here its a good spot late in the day.. Also cpr bay..  There should be holes all over the lake now, just pick a spot!  Minnow lake is supposed to have lots of pike, but I'm not sure if it can be accessed by the public as there is houses all the way around."

Just a hint, u gotta go a little north of Sudbury for really good fishing.  I never bothered with Ramsey, its right in the city, too close to home, lottsa pressure.  1 hour north is top notch fishing!"
