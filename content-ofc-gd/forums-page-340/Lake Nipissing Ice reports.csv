756208,limeyangler,2013-01-04 02:47:00,5204,HAHAHA...minnow motel...good one!  Great opener Blair.
756223,Nipfisher,2013-01-04 04:02:00,2449,"  Simon you should make one. Best way to keep minnows alive for months. It is a 3 foot long piece of 5"" PVC pipe with a cap on the bottom and a threaded cap on the top. Perforated to allow the water through it and a rope/chain attached to the screw on lid. Drop it down the hole with a piece of 2x2 tied to the rope and you have a place to keep your minnows acclimatized to the water you are fishing. To get it out I drill a hole on a slight angle about 6"" away from the 2x2 and use my gaf to hook the rope and pull it up."
756265,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-04 13:46:00,2690,"Sounds like another fantastic day, Blair!! I'm aching to get back up there this year, Juli and I had such a good time with Idle Tyme last mid-January!  Unfortunately a repeat trip there wasn't in the budget.  Keep up the great reports!!"
756294,fishnsled,2013-01-04 15:58:00,3520,Awesome start to the season!
756688,Nipfisher,2013-01-06 01:10:00,2449,"Only 1 nice walleye today. A beauty 15"" eater. We caught a couple more but just babies. 2 pike, 7 perch."
756733,freddyp,2013-01-06 05:48:00,27,Congrats on some nice fish! Always appreciate seein the pictures. Hope I can get up there this year and glad the fishery is turnin around too!
755741,Nipfisher,2013-01-02 03:39:00,2449,Hit the hut today with Joeytier around noon and fished from 1pm to 4pm. Got into a few perch at the start and then around 2pm the walleye started to bite. We ended up catching 5 walleye and lost just as many. Caught close to 10 perch and lost a decent pike at the hole.  We kept our 2 walleye each and I took home 2 perch while Joey brought home 3 perch.       Good start to the season.   Big surprise was $17.40 for 3 dozen Emerald Shiners.
755744,NAW,2013-01-02 03:42:00,4022,Good start?  That's a great start!  Hut in the same place as the past few years?  Good stuff guys!  Gunna make it up there for a weekend this year for sure!
755746,Acountdeleted,2013-01-02 03:53:00,2562,Oh man. Great catch. Glad to see the fish are biting up there.
755751,cram,2013-01-02 07:04:00,1733," Have you tried Bowman's bait?  I don't know what he carries in the winter, but in the summer his prices are great and quality is really high."
755776,Rod Caster,2013-01-02 14:32:00,5784,Great job guys!  Freeze any leftover minnows you have this year. It's not worth throwing the leftovers on the ice anymore.  or... do you have an aerator system for you garage Blair  I know you have plenty of minnow traps.  
755777,Nipfisher,2013-01-02 14:35:00,2449, They are all still alive in my Minnow Motel. I do have an aerator system in the garage but nothing works better then keeping them under the ice.
755778,Nipfisher,2013-01-02 14:39:00,2449,"  Cram, I am pretty loyal to Discount Bait at the corner of Trout Lake Rd. and the by-pass. However, Billy Bob's is selling 3 doz for $10 so I may have to visit Billy when these run out. The advantage of Discount Bait is they treat me well and I average 15-18 minnows per dozen. They have also permitted me to buy bulk by the pound for our annual GTG."
755779,Nipfisher,2013-01-02 14:41:00,2449, I thought about grabbing the 2 shiners in the belly of one of the walleye I cleaned. Joeytier will tell you I needed all 3 chances to get the bugger.
755780,RickOnt,2013-01-02 14:42:00,669,Fantastic opener  Fresh Perch and Walleye for dinner  Nothing better  Rick
755785,Oryx,2013-01-02 15:33:00,186,Great update.  How thick is the ice?
755788,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-02 15:51:00,2690,Sooooooooooooo jealous!!!  Nicely done!
755794,Roy,2013-01-02 16:18:00,13728,"I'm never jealous of anyone but you can bet your bippy that I'm envious as hell of you and Joey, Blair.  Great report, thanks for sharing it with us."
755796,Nipfisher,2013-01-02 16:26:00,2449,"  7"" of ice as of yesterday but going to be close to 9"" by the weekend."
755802,Joeytier,2013-01-02 16:57:00,3990,Great start indeed...I'm off to freeze my cahonies off sans-hut on a new spot this evening.
755816,wormdunker,2013-01-02 18:33:00,1711,Thanx for the report Blair.  Sounds like the walleyes were cooperating.  I'm back in Fonthill after a 6 month stint in Fort McMurray.  Hopefully I can make to your area this winter.
755833,misfish,2013-01-02 20:20:00,29133,"Sweet Blair.  Maybe I,ll tag along with Nick."
755838,Christopheraaron,2013-01-02 20:27:00,3525,Nice! That's the way to kick off a new year!
755854,Nipfisher,2013-01-02 21:02:00,2449,  Any time Brian. It's nice when you can drive right to the hut.
755910,Bernie,2013-01-02 23:23:00,3190,Great fishing guys!  Heard through the grapevine there is a big fish shack needing rescue out of the lake today. So the ice is a little thin in spots yet. Be careful out there.
755912,Moosebunk,2013-01-02 23:25:00,3970,Quite the hat lad!  And methinks you put your hut on the right spot too.
755941,Joeytier,2013-01-03 01:03:00,3990,Thanks...its 100% species at risk fur...
756052,TJQ,2013-01-03 15:29:00,7806,I remember that hut!! Great Report!! I gotta get out!!
756176,Nipfisher,2013-01-04 00:44:00,2449,"A buddy and I hit the hut just before 10am this morning. Fished until 4:30 and ended up icing 11 walleye (kept our 4), 26 perch (kept 9), 1 pike.  Stories for the day are lost a big pike on head shakes when he cut my line. Lost a HUGE walleye for Nipissing when the hook popped out as I tried to drag it up on the ice. My guestimate was between 6 and 7 lbs. based on size of head but never saw the length so could have weighed more. She had shoulders. I tried my best and put my arm in the hole to my elbow and had the fish pressed against the underside of the ice.  All released walleye were 13"" or smaller."
756186,Rod Caster,2013-01-04 01:28:00,5784,"That's great Blair! Too bad about Mr. Headshakes. Sounds like it was a haawwwg.  No point in moving your shack, unless the fishing slows down."
756192,Leecher,2013-01-04 01:43:00,7832,Couple of nice reports Blair    Good to hear that the walleyes are being cooperative     despite the negative talks about the fishery
