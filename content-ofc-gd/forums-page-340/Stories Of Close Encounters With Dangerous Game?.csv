755928,Bernie,2013-01-03 00:00:00,3190,"Had a few close encounters. The first one was a good many years ago. I was 14 and out for a partridge hunt at the hunt camp during the Thanksgiving weekend. Walking the trail, I came along a small but steep section of the path, my head down as I chugged up. When I reached the top and my head came up I was face to face with a bull moose. Holy Crap!! Being young, and inexperienced, turned tail and ran. The next day my dad was out doing the same thing. The same thing happened to him, but stood his ground. He held his shotgun barrel right up the the face of the moose and waited for it to turn around. The standoff continued for quite some time. Dad won, the moose turned away.  The next one occurred 4 or 5 years ago while deer hunting. I was on a watch waiting for the doggers to come through. I usually scan the bush well while on a watch. I turned for a look behind me and seen a bear running. It was coming somewhat towards me. My first thought was to grab my camera and take a movie. I just got it out of my pocket and the bear then changed direction directly to me. To hell with the camera, dropped it and picked up my rifle, turned the safety off and was about to pull the trigger when it stopped so suddenly it rolled over itself, turned away and ran off. I was shaking...Cool experience, wish I had of stayed with the camera.  A couple years ago, again on a watch I spied a martin searching through the brush, slowly heading my direction. I stood stock still and waited (no camera dang it). He ended up about two feet away when I suddenly shuffled to let him know I was there. He went straight up a small tree in front of me and snarled ferociously. Those things have some serious teeth. I backed off a little to allow him to get back down the tree. He was making an awful racket and knew it would scare off any deer that may come out. Cool to see though."
755936,MJL,2013-01-03 00:51:00,2427,"Back in 2007 while camping in Algonquin park with a few friends, a big mamma moose and her calf wondered right into the middle of our campsite. Both were about 10ft away from us. For 2 minutes, we were sitting there just looking at each other trying not to move till they left.LOL"
755969,Joey,2013-01-03 03:16:00,9122,"Well the day before Halloween, right here in Richmond Hill, a coyote came up to me while walking Ralphie.  I think he had eyes on Ralphie being a snack until he saw me!  When I was younger, living on the townsite in Elliot Lake, we had lots of bear encounters.  The closest was two of us walking to a friends house and as we rounded the corner of the house, there was a huge black bear sitting there looking at us not 2 feet away.  I don't think I've ever ran faster in my life away from it!!  Oh, and not wild, but I had a retarded (or shall I say mentally challenged) 20 hands high horse rear up and lunge for my neck with his teeth bared.  Just about got me too from what everyone said.  I ducked and ran.  I still rode horses after that tho, not like scaredy pants Burtess  I have found most wild animals will avoid you at all cost and are generally more afraid of you than you are of them!!  Just doesn't feel like it"

756003,hammercarp,2013-01-03 11:46:00,964,"We used to fish for brook trout on the branches of the Saugeen. Near one small town a guy had his collection of animals. He had a piebald whitetail and a camel and others. He had several bison. We stopped one time to look at the big bull bison that was right up against the fence. He was cropping grass. I saw some clover growing on the opposite side of the road and grabbed a bunch. I fed it to him through the page wire fence. Everything was fine, then I heard a car pull up behind me and the doors open. All of the sudden I could see the whites of that bulls eye. His massive head was right in front of me. He snorted and he hooked his horn on the fence and I could hear the fence groan. This was 2 ft from me. I thought I was in big trouble as the fence was old. I retreated and almost fell. The bull unhooked himself and took off. I turned to see a stupid woman there with her dog. She was taking her dog to see the buffalo."

756034,manitoubass2,2013-01-03 14:50:00,11391,"a few summer ago while fishing Rainy with my kids we must have come between a large momma black bear, I posted the story on here. Getting charged at is VERY intimidating I must say!  I've had numerous run ins with bears usually portaging through the bush, but no real issues.  Last winter me and the kids had an awesome run in with wolves that gave me a new respect for them, and how intelligent of hunters they are. We were ice fishing just about a km from home out on the river. We had all the gear out on the ice, and the van parked on shore up on a hill about 120 yards away. The sun was just setting, and I noticed a lone wolf out off the sandbar maybe 150 yards away. The wolf sat there occasionally howling. It had my attention. Then a second wolf appeared at the same spot. I thought, ok, I better get the kids up in the van and I'll go pack up the gear. So I got the kids in the van and gave them a few brief instructions for if I didnt come back. So I walked back down and packed up the gear. Those two wolves were now getting closer, but didnt seem aggressive. I calmly got the gear back up to the van. When I put the keys in and fired it up, OH MY! 3 more wolves, right in front of the van in some thin bush! All I could think was wow! They totally had us, if they wanted us. It seemed to me, that they had set us up (maybe it just seemed that way????) Nonetheless, it was pretty cool of them to do that, but not attack lol."

We were in the bush at sun up, and were carefully walking a trail through the bush.We were about 100 yards apart, but within site of eachother. I was looking at the ground, following some fresh tracks, when i heard my friend of in the distance going Psssst.....Psssssst. I glanced over at him, and he was franticly pointing for me to look left. At this point, my concentration broken, i coud hear a sound comeing from my left, that made me want to release my bowels.  I slowly pivoted and found myself less than 5 feet from the biggest bull moose i have ever seen:o How i got so close without seeing him, i have no idea.I froze in mid pivot, and realized the sound i was hearing was his deep breathing.He looked down at me from a head at least 8 feet off the ground, and turned and slowly walked off into the bush, hardly makeing a sound at all. Scared the beejesus outta me, since i had heard stories about hunters being chased up a tree by them. Ya see, i dont climb trees verry wellB)"

755835,Christopheraaron,2013-01-02 20:22:00,3525,"Well, this summer me and my mom were up in algonquin. Usually our family does the interior sites but this time we thought that we'd try a drive up and do day portages. We got there, set up, ate, properly got rid of any food scraps, cleaned all the eating surfaces and called it a day. While we did this on either side of us there were about 12 people, obviously they were new to camping, but we didn't think much of it. Well it turns out that after eating neither of those sites had been cleaned at all, there was food and drinks all over the place and they just left it! At about 2 in the morning we were awakened by something outside nosing around, we quickly realized that it was a bear, and instead of going to the campsites around us it came to us. We heard the family next to us wake up, we could hear them talking, then they decided that their tent would protect them somehow and went back to sleep. Meanwhile we were on the phone to the warden for about 20 minutes with no answer. We decided that because this was a garbage bear that there was no way anyone was going to scare it off and so we waited for it to wander off, it didn't. Instead eventually a car came down the road and we heard it run off. Needless to say we weren't waiting for it to came back so we made a b-line to the car and slept in the car at one of the parking lots on hwy #60. Had a few moose run ins but we always kept our distance with them and there was never a threat from them."

It was a loner wolf that was foraging through the bush. He turned and came straight at me. I stood up and raised the 12 gauge and he thought better of it, turning away at about 15 yards. I was about to feed him a couple slugs for dinner, followed by a buckshot for dessert, but thankfully never had to..."
755851,JimC,2013-01-02 20:57:00,86," man, that would be a scary encounter for sure;  but the most amazing thing is that he didn't take a big swat at you, when you were weighing him."

755856,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-02 21:07:00,10439,"Too many encounters to list em all.  Been woofed at several times by both black and grizzly bears. Been bluff charged by a ma grizz protecting her younguns.  Closest of all was a run in with a 9 1/2- 10 sow grizz while heading back from the river. Had one foot on the bank when I saw her coming towards us. She came out into an opening 10-15 feet from me and completely ignored us. If she wanted she could have been on us in one bound. I thought about taking a picture of her when she was right there but couldn't remember if I had the flash set to automatically go off and didn't feel like ticking off a 1000# bear, so I waited until she turned around. Oh, that and I had my fishing rod in one hand and my other hand was on my bear spray just in case.    On a couple of occasions I've had grizzlies sniffing at my tent in the middle of the night ans one time while sitting around the fire I heard a faint woof over the sound of the creek and crackling fire. I asked my buddy if he heard it and he said ""heard what"". I told him that there was a bear on the other side of the creek and he said ""yeah, ok"" About 10 minutes later it had come over to our side and circled around us on the camp grounds road. It caught our scent and ran full boar past us. You could barely hear it's gallop but you could feel the ground vibrate as the bear passed by about 30 or 40 feet away. I asked my buddy ""well did you hear that?"" I thought he was going to soil himself!!!   :rofl2:  Another good one was when a bunch of us were sitting around camp and one of the lads was deep frying chicken wings for 20!!! We were all having a drink and waiting for the feast to be ready when a grizz walked up the hill from the Russian River and stuck it's head between the fence boards (the fence is about 4 1/2' high with 3 horizontal 2X8's). As you can imagine this caused quite a stir in camp!! As soon as someone said bear!!! there was about 8 friends all standing there brandishing firearms!!! One of my buddies walked over to the firepit and grabbed a very healthy log, walked over to the fence and whopped the bear on the head with it!!!! The bear left, the guns went back into hiding, chicken wings were eaten, drinks consumed and a great story was born!!!"

They would sometimes group up and circle us, but it never felt like they were trying to get us. Mostly they would follow people in hopes that a lemming or hare would be flushed out and provide them an easy meal. Boy those wolves were big.

A wolf casually trotted by and didnt really pose a threat. All of a sudden it stopped, turned, and just started staring at me. Then it started to howl. Before I knew it there was 3 more wolves circling near the blind. I hunkered down and just waited. If they were to try anything Id give them a taste of the 45 Springfield XD on my hip and the 30-06 Remington in my hands haha.  I decided to end the hunt earlier and just got out and started walking to the truck which was nearby. The wolves just slowly trailed me so with some quick thinking I pulled my truck keys out of my pocket and set the alarm off, wolves were gone in no time and had a nice, short, peaceful walk the rest of the way."

A couple months back though, we drove into town about 4:00 in the afternoon and got home 90 minutes later to find that a bear had come up  the driveway and tore the downspout off the side of the house and actually ripped it in half.  I've seen chipmonks go into the trough, supposedly to get the water, and I'm guessing perhaps the bear saw him go in there and was trying to get him.  Nobody was home when it happened, but it coulda been nasty if someone came walking around the corner of the house just as it was going on.  Here's a couple pics I took.      "
