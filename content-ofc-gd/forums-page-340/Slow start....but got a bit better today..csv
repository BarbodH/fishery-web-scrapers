After spending the best part of the morning trying to break trail we turned back from our original destination. Problem was steep hills/ bare granite and hardly any snow. Had a day off for chores in between then headed out this afternoon for another shot at some lakers. Instant results had me looking for the monster walleye that inhabit the lake i was on.....was not to be.       THE TRAIL BROKE US NEW YEAR'S DAY             AFTER A POOR OPENER I REORGANISED MY GEAR AND REDOUBLED MY EFFORTS           THIS AFTERNOON I HEADED OUT AGAIN......ROLOFF WAS NOT AMUSED HE WAS NOT COMING                   NICE RIDE OUT.....INSTANT SUCCESS TOO.  <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/cvfS2KeGlNE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                 NICE LITTLE SESSION.....AWESOME SUNSET ON THE WAY HOME                              "

Thanks man, yup...hes a complete spazz....but we love him.   Was windy, cold as hell...but yeah...fun to be out.   Hey John. Good to hear from ya. As for the whitefish we got the other day...i usually make a kind of spicy fish stew with shrimp....i dont have a smoker.   Thanks dood.    I need a new computer...my existing one does not have enough 'uuumph' to cope with the GoPro.    This lake always has good numbers....just not the biggest."
