756549,spooner_jr,2013-01-05 14:44:00,193,I'm looking to get something that can serve as a dual purpose unit.  Willing to spend around $500 and would like to know what you have/recommend.
756576,Rob,2013-01-05 16:28:00,467,I think that this is a good unit for the price point. You can use it for ice fishing and in the boat. Use your imagination when adapting it for ice fishing and you can do it on the cheap.  Rob C
756577,mike rousseau,2013-01-05 16:31:00,4661,I have a humminbird 597 ci hd and love it...  But the portable pack and ice ducer are an extra 150-200
756581,misfish,2013-01-05 16:45:00,29133,CTC has the 4x that can be for ice and open water. $169
756614,camillj,2013-01-05 19:04:00,1988,I think I paid about $500 for my Humminbird 565 a few years ago .... went to buy a second transducer this summer so I could have it permanently mounted on the new boat and found that for about $175 I could get the whole unit (Humminbird 570 - (but without the portable ice cover/battery kit) ... great unit IMHO ...
756618,spooner_jr,2013-01-05 19:17:00,193,"This unit in the bottom left of the page works for Lowrance units http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_fall12/lowrance_humminbird.pdf, would one of the Elite units be able to show me the jig etc while fishing?"
756620,landry,2013-01-05 19:36:00,1005,Lowrance elite series. I have the elite 5 and ice kit. It is a nice unit and used all year long.
756649,limeyangler,2013-01-05 22:27:00,5204,lowrance and hummingbird both kit their units out for the ice. Find either in your price range...make sure its a color TFT screen(black and white you will have probs in cold temps) and get the one that you like best....both brands are excellent fishfinders.
756673,Rob,2013-01-06 00:12:00,467,"I just got this unit and it is super clear. Has 640 x 640 resolution on it. At 8x zoom I can see the    on the fish!  BTW, if you are going to buy a fishfinder, find the cheapest price, print it out and go to West Marine and they will price match. But the thing I like about West Marine, is they have the best warranty around. For roughly an extra $60, they will give you an extra 2 years on top of the manufactures warranty. If you have ANY troubles with the unit, you bring it in and they will give you a new right on the spot, no questions asked. If they don't carry that model they will give an equivalent or better. Even in the first year of the manufacturers warranty. Not trying to toot anyone's horn here, but their service is pretty good at West Marine in Barrie.  Rob C"
756679,Cosmos,2013-01-06 00:38:00,588,Same here. Love this unit. Perfect screen and really easy to use.
756681,Nipfisher,2013-01-06 00:48:00,2449,See if you can pick up a cheap Gen. 1 Lowrance HDS and buy the PP1 (portable power pack and ice transducer). It is a still a great unit for both seasons.
756698,camillj,2013-01-06 01:51:00,1988,  Mine is a Black and white (after much discussion it turns out they use a lot less juice - so the battery runs longer (especially in the cold) ... I take it out regularly at -20 or colder ... and normally get at solid couple days (15 - 20 hrs) on a charge for those little $25 12V gell cells... I take a spare and (try to) keep it warm to swap out if necessary   Oh .. and btw ... I clearly mark both minnows AND a single split shot at 60 feet when on the ice .... I can tell when a fish is coming into the areas even before it registers on the screen because I can literally SEE the minnows get active
756713,limeyangler,2013-01-06 03:37:00,5204,  I have an X67c and an X4. The x67c is color.....the x4 black and white. I definitely noticed a slow performance with even the screen looking a bit funny when i had it out in -20....i use it in my iceshack now.   My X67c probably gets 3 or 4 trips before the battery needs charging....12V 7ah SLA.
756715,irishfield,2013-01-06 03:41:00,26272,I use the 102C off the bow of my boat for ice fishing. You can pick a used one up on Ebay for less than $200... $35 for a water proof case to hold the batteries and a RAM mount! All in less than $300.
756718,BillM,2013-01-06 04:42:00,17367,I use my Humminbird 788ci in the boat and on the ice.  However I prefer the 747c (Which gets bow duty in the summer) on the ice because the refresh is better.
