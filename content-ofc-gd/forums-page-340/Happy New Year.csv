We hit up Long Island Locks for some perching, spent a day in Bogie where ""nothing but wild turkeys would make their appearance."" and spent the last day at -30 on crappie bay hiding from the crisp wind and keeping busy with crappie and gills.  Full report and pictures here http://thebassassins.com/?p=689  A great way to start the year out testing new gear, catching up with a buddy and keeping a bend in our rod.         Happy fishing to all those who are out..... be safe!  Tight Lines,  Rob and Rob"
