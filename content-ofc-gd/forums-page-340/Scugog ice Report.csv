754794,barrystrs,2012-12-28 17:43:00,75,"I walked out about 20' on the east side of the island, near Pine Point, Dec 28.  First swing with the axe it went through, about 1 and a half inches thick. Bummer"
754804,Terry,2012-12-28 18:35:00,14456,it's a start....thanks
754807,bigbuckzone,2012-12-28 18:43:00,7,"4 inches in some spots along starrs beach, lots of thin spots still though so im stickin close to shore"
755250,GBW,2012-12-30 19:35:00,8460,going to get Sinclair's boat out for walleye opener if this 'warm' day keeps up...
755330,jedimaster,2012-12-31 00:50:00,3472,"Well, no doubt someone will die on scugog as is the case what seems every year. Be safe on the sleds and on the feet folks. There is a reason why Scugog's nickname is Skidoobegone."
755335,GBW,2012-12-31 00:58:00,8460,we can stil get the boat out though...
755339,GBW,2012-12-31 01:02:00,8460,"So, rather that than walk on the thin ice..."
755344,GBW,2012-12-31 01:08:00,8460,you are the engineer not me!  LOL
755346,jedimaster,2012-12-31 01:12:00,3472,I built a hovercraft a long time ago.
755357,stendec,2012-12-31 02:14:00,22,"Buy an Argo, land, ice, water. Just dont know how easy it would be from open water to get onto ice again"
755358,jedimaster,2012-12-31 02:20:00,3472,"Unless you have tracks you wont. haha I saw that once before just kept slipping, but at least they didn't sink. As for that hovercraft hull, its s nice looking hull, how stuck can it possibly be, light is the key word with hovercrafts. That skirt is destroyed, needs props engines, mount, controls... umm everything."
755401,gaspumper,2012-12-31 12:05:00,393,"And they will SINK,buddy had one sink at the Bay of Quinte at Trenton few years ago sat on bottom for a week until he got it out.He broke through thin ice and tried to climb back on solid ice with it,the back end took on water and pulled it under."
755404,ecmilley,2012-12-31 12:20:00,2163,"seen some people walking there dogs on sturgeon lake, figured wth and did a run up and down on the sled though don't need much ice at 100mph"
755463,Freshtrax,2012-12-31 16:06:00,2215,My uncle billy died on that lake through the ice.   Be carefull.

755837,Acountdeleted,2013-01-02 20:27:00,2562,"This is probabally going to sound like a dumb question, but where can I buy a spud? I'd like to check out Scugog out of Caserea tomorrow but there is no way I'm going out without one.     Course if someone wanted to tell me about a safer lake that I could go for crappie I wouldn't be opposed."
755839,jedimaster,2013-01-02 20:38:00,3472,Pretty sure Bass pro has them.
755841,Christopheraaron,2013-01-02 20:41:00,3525,Bass or sail should have them. I think a lot of guys use axes too.
755844,Acountdeleted,2013-01-02 20:44:00,2562,Thanks guys. I do have a decent axe. I'll probably just bring that with me.
755858,GBW,2013-01-02 21:22:00,8460,I would get a proper spud. http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_fall12/clam_additions.pdf
756284,robfrawley,2013-01-04 14:54:00,25,Can any confirm what the ice is like by Stephenson point road area? South of goreskis?
756306,kemper,2013-01-04 17:04:00,2232,"I checked the ice at the end of the island, as well as the east side of the island and right in port perry - found it quite inconsistent still. Lots of sled tracks, but I wouldn't be on it with any machines yet..."
756526,Rich,2013-01-05 11:49:00,3927,I saw a bunch at CTC yesterday in a bin.. nice lookin ones for 15 bucks
756556,ciceri,2013-01-05 15:24:00,535,"We've got huts out off Washburn Island and running the quads and sleds around out there. Not saying the whole lake is safe or even around the island, make sure you know before you go."
