756603,Sinker,2013-01-05 18:05:00,8692,"I thought fetch was the distance between wave peaks? I forget now too.....  Anyways, if you have open water on one side of the lake, and ice on the other, you'd best be watching the winds. An offshore wind can break the ice off, and send you drifting, like what happened last year on simcoe. An onshore wind, into the ice, will make waves smash into the ice, and possibly break it up. I've heard stories of waves on simcoe breaking up 8"" of clear ice they got so big.  Just think, there is ice on the south shore out so far. A big North wind comes up, and those waves are building up for miles, over a long period of time. By the time they reach the ice on the south shore, they are massive. The ice doesn't stand a chance, and will start breaking up.  I've only seen this on simcoe, the great lakes, and the ocean. You need a big body of water for this to happen, and it has to be open with only sections that are iced over.  Make sense?"
756608,misfish,2013-01-05 18:21:00,29133," Thats even worse then a West to East. Have been in it,during the summer months. SCARY STUFF Hate to be out there in the winter months and that happen."
756226,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-01-04 04:50:00,160,"hey all, was just wondering if anyone has been out on Virginia beach or port bolster? I hear both have good ice and was wondering which would over all be better? if your looking to head out tomorrow pm me.   Thanks Alex"
756227,irishfield,2013-01-04 05:02:00,26272,Already a few posts about it Alex if you poke around a bit! Be cautious... 45K west wind tomorrow. Can't wait to drive to Owen Sound again in that!
756238,misfish,2013-01-04 11:19:00,29133,"Yep like Wayne said,the winds are up there already this morning. Strong out of the west."
756242,BillM,2013-01-04 13:03:00,17367,I wouldn't be out anywhere with winds like we've got this morning.
756245,misfish,2013-01-04 13:06:00,29133," Oh ,you can bet there will be some.Those wave are going to crush some ice over there."
756246,NAW,2013-01-04 13:12:00,4022,Be careful Alex.  Like the others have said.  Thin ice in Simcoe and strong winds.  We don't want a repeat of the ice rescue like what happened last year.
756256,BillM,2013-01-04 13:23:00,17367,"If you're going out, make sure to stash a few bucks away to cover the rescue fees!  (All joking aside, be safe out there if you do go)"
756259,bobowski,2013-01-04 13:28:00,360,Now you guys have me thinking. I am just about to leave to go to VB. I was thinking about the affects of the wind aswell. Especially out of the west. I'm itching really bad. Maybe I should wait until tomorrow?
756264,Reelaction,2013-01-04 13:41:00,33,Might be a good call to wait until tomorrow.  You can be out there with the rest of us nuts.  Planning on Virginia Beach tomorrow. Hopefully the water is clear. My son loves sight fishing the yellow bellies.
756385,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-01-04 21:21:00,160,"i just went up to couch. still had fun, no keepers tho"
756458,BillM,2013-01-05 01:01:00,17367, Lots of guys out there I'm assuming?
756474,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-01-05 01:54:00,160,only about 5 that i could see. i was infront of rama
756476,Fisherman,2013-01-05 01:59:00,7201,"If you're going to Virginia Beach, the parking nitwits are at it hardcore, apparantely issued a wack(30+)of tickets for parking more than 3hrs in areas where there were not any no parking signs."
756485,tapout,2013-01-05 02:17:00,166, Was this on Hadden Rd?  That's where I usually park.
756488,Reelaction,2013-01-05 02:33:00,33,"You got it. Hadden Rd.  I was planning on parking there tomorrow morning. May need to re-think that Lets see.  $60.00 gas, $10 minnows, $30 parking, hundreds in equipment  Catching a few perch on Simcoe.....................Priceless!!!!!"
756489,Terry,2013-01-05 02:38:00,14456,"wonder how much I could make with valet parking, moving each vehicle every 2.9 hours"
756494,irishfield,2013-01-05 03:22:00,26272,They only need to move one parking spot Terry.. 2 guys.. change belts.. you'd go broke running to the bank for change!
756495,tapout,2013-01-05 03:32:00,166,Is the parking lot next to the restaurant still open to the public?  I've parked there before.  It was paid parking and about 10 dollars but that was a few years ago.
756500,BillM,2013-01-05 03:41:00,17367," Thanks bud, that's usually where I go out."
756507,chris f.,2013-01-05 05:07:00,95," lol...great idea terry, im in.... lol, now can i ask something without  ? what is it about hte strong wind that effects the ice.. thick or thin... what can the wind do the the ice? i've always fished lakes with little to no current around my cottage ( kashwakamak lake: mazinaw, marble, big gull ect.. ) and i've never had an experience where the wind causes issues. i have only spent time on simcoe when i was younger and i remember better ice in the 80's and 90's...?"
756511,BillM,2013-01-05 05:28:00,17367,Wind can bust up ice in no time..  A few unlucky people found out on Simcoe last year and had to be rescued by helicopter.
756519,misfish,2013-01-05 10:43:00,29133,"  To answer your question.........  Yesterdays winds were out of the west45-55 kmh. No ice on this side. By the time the waves and rollers get built up heading east,it easy to crush any ice over there.The ice will go up and down,eventually snapping it.Then it begins."
756583,chris f.,2013-01-05 16:56:00,95,ah.. i see. does that happen if the lake is totally frozen over or is it just if there is open water around... ?
756585,misfish,2013-01-05 17:02:00,29133,"Never seen it. But,I would think if the ice is thin,the pressure from the wind could make the ice move up and down,eventully causing a break."
756599,Fisherman,2013-01-05 17:55:00,7201,"If I remember right it's called fetch, the distance that's open to the wind, frozen or not. The stronger the wind the more ""pull"" it has on the surface and yes, it will go up and down. And, the marina is still open with a few guys fishing off the docks this morning."
