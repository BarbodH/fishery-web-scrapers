The pike were super agressive and smashing jigs with wreckless abandon!!! I had my first fish before the jig hit bottom!! My first 7 drops produced 7 fish landed out of 10 fish on!!!! Lost count of all the fish today but figure I landed close to 30 in the 5 or so hours out on the lake. All of the fish I was catching were those pesky 24""-30"" fish again. Come sundown though the bigger fish turned on and I got about  1/2 dozen over 30"". The biggest taped out at 38"" or so.    "
