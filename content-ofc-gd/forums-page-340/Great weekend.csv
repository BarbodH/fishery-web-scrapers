We brought shacks but never set them up and were constantly on the move. Fishing flats and the mouths of bays were hot. Tubes and Darters were on the menu.  Follow this up with a Sunday morning fish on Lake Winnipeg. Caught a few greens and kept a few for a nice fish fry tonight. (reward for the tough weekend of fishing)  The fish were all caught on rattle baits but we had to down size to get them to hit, very odd mix of aggressive but finicky.   "
