756296,Loadman,2013-01-04 16:11:00,63,"people get mad cause too many look at my 50lber posts come up when they clearly are 35's... it seems that the only issue with this one is the title of ""world record""... the more I look at it I think they are saying that in a few years that fish will be a WR..... if it was only a pic of the fish and Barbo.... I think all we would hear is praise. As for if the fish was the WR.... not sure he would bonk it.... having said that I think 5-10 years ago he wouldnt... but now not so sure as he has gone ""main stream"" on the musky scene.. which of course others have too Mr Thorpe comes to mind..... it used to be for the thrill of trying to get the tanks.... now its about the $$... whch Laz really doesnt need... but the recognition. He was like Pokaroo for a long time, like a myth, now hes on tv every week it seems. Lets see in the next cpl years what happens.... Ken O'briens fish is the WR in my book.... too many of the US fish are not documented well enough.... people just dont like that Obrien caught it walleye fishing lol  Hit a 70lber and put this to bed"
756297,mistaredone,2013-01-04 16:12:00,913,Amazing fish!!!  Too bad somebody on facebook latched on and called it a record only to get more likes and comments for thier page.  Looking forward to getting the full story from MH
756304,Rich Nelson,2013-01-04 16:54:00,332,"Loadman gets it... Although Laz catches lots of huge fish that we never hear about. Theres only so much he can do to keep out of the public eye. As for the record being about money... I dont think so. This isnt bass we are talking about, which could be worth a ton of money. If the record is ever broken ( or established) then the angler might be lucky enough to get on pro staff for some tackle company... It wont be worth a lot of money.  I hope someone puts it to rest next season with a legitimate giant. ( and Larry Ramsell doesnt get his hands on it...)"
756310,Rich Clemens,2013-01-04 17:12:00,3131,"When my musky season starts up again this summer, I'll take it upon myself to catch the undeniable world record.  Shattering both length and weight records.  It's gonna be a great year."
756314,Guest,2013-01-04 17:16:00,0,  Im right there with you.  Next world record is coming from Georgian Bay next year guys cause thats where I go.  If im not trolling I hope she follows right up to the boat.
756322,4x4bassin,2013-01-04 17:37:00,1025,I don't fish for musky (never got into it) but one thing for certain that is a big fish and should be appreciated and respected as such
756326,Loadman,2013-01-04 17:45:00,63,I will be Using a Rapala bait... with my Shimano Reel.... and my St Croix Rod and both my Hummingbird and Lowrance helped me find it... in a Lund with a Merc.... wearing Gloomis outer wear... and who else could I try and sell the WR photo to for sponsorship or $$ lol:tease:    And Musky Hunter mag helped show me the spots .... with a BPS tackle box and sox lol
756622,ehg,2013-01-05 19:54:00,2666,Like the big musky pictures. Thought i would go through this...  Georgian Bay produces big ones...this is largest measured and weighed. Caught incidentally...65lbs.   This guy tried hard for many years and caught this...61+lbs.   The St.Lawrence/Ottawa R. has produced big ones. All caught and released.  This is reproduction of Mcnair musky.   Claimed catch release record by Bill Craig caught near Ottawa.   Lazarus/Barbosa muskies...    Like the BIG musky pictures! Probably next world record will come from St.Lawrence/ Ottawa R. or Georgian Bay.
756624,manitoubass2,2013-01-05 20:12:00,11391,My gawd those are some dandy fish!  That replica is pretty sweet! Is that a Jake in the mouth? I like the addition of the lure
756626,lew,2013-01-05 20:15:00,12766," Yup, Black Perch if I remember correctly."
756652,Handlebarz,2013-01-05 23:11:00,3790,Yes but the original jake was stolen from the McNair monster when he was doing a show. Sad if you ask me why someone would steal a lure from a fish mount.
756666,glen,2013-01-05 23:49:00,2641,Great fish.  It is very telling that there are a few fish 60lbs or close to it.  So 60lbs seems like a top mark to hit.
756680,Rizzo,2013-01-06 00:46:00,4754,"Man what a fish! I really didn't find the posts here all that negative either, just guys questioning why someone would call it a record. No biggie. Even the guys questioning it wondered if it was a live release record or a line class record etc. No negativity at all in my opinion (although I've only read through once...maybe I need to go back and see who was being a real jerk)."
756683,Guest,2013-01-06 00:51:00,0,Oh man I love that one that Ken O'brian is holding.  If that thing followed my lure up to the boat my knees would buckle and I would end up falling out of the boat.
756731,BillM,2013-01-06 05:35:00,17367,"GBay's got the next world record in it!  Now you've just gotta go out and find it, lol."
756739,darsky,2013-01-06 09:58:00,586,my guess is Mike's getting a chuckle at this thread.
756074,mike rousseau,2013-01-03 16:54:00,4661, Yeah same here....  I felt like a dummy once I read it again to see 58.5lbs....
756076,Loadman,2013-01-03 16:57:00,63,I think its an IGFA live release record.... but no where near that 65 lbs mark. I just hope a 70 gets bonked soon to put the WR talk to bed.
756078,lew,2013-01-03 17:04:00,12766,"Last I remember, Bill Craig from the Ottawa River area still holds the Live Release record"
756093,Handlebarz,2013-01-03 18:42:00,3790,The pictures are up on the Muskie Hunter forum
756094,lew,2013-01-03 18:55:00,12766,"Here's the picture.  Not sure if were allowed to take pictures from other websites, but if not, please feel free to delete this post mods.  "

756145,Ron,2013-01-03 23:14:00,1683,"Wow, very few ""Good for you!"" comments. It's no wonder people don't bother posting images anymore. I don't blame Laz for not showing pictures. The same would go for a few other trophy takers (C&R of course) on this site. Speaking of such, has anyone heard from Mark Thorpe lately?"
756148,Terry,2013-01-03 23:19:00,14456,I think it is safe to say the world record thing threw people off a bit
756149,Steve,2013-01-03 23:19:00,2075,"Ron, don't call your fish a world record (unless it actually is) and it would likely have received more good jobs.  It's a huge fish none the less.  By them actually calling it a ""world record"" it shows they don't believe the ""real"" world record is legit.  I'm quite sure (100% actually) that if Laz, Thorpe, or anyone else actually caught the real world record, photo's would be shown left and right (knowing the muskie game, likely sold to the highest bidding website).  Further, I'm quite sure if that fish weighed 65.5lbs and not 58.5lbs the fish would have been kept. So good on the fish for coming in under the 65lbs mark - cause it likely saved its life!  edit: spelling"
756150,Steve,2013-01-03 23:21:00,2075,Terry beat me to it.
756167,Leecher,2013-01-04 00:23:00,7832," I have the same sentiment as you Ron   It's amazing how a trophy fish caught and then being posted, get decimated in seconds ......"
756206,Moosebunk,2013-01-04 02:45:00,3970,"Saw this pic and thought, this is going to be a great story.    See this pic and still think it will be.  First things that went through my head though, man I wish I could catch one like that, and... good for those doods.  I mean, there's only so many that put the time in that Laz does.  If anyone could be considered deserving it'd be him, or a guy in his boat.  That is just one beautiful big fall muskie... and like any great catch I'm sure there is a wicked story to go along with it.     Think that some comments tend to be knee jerk reactions but for overall muskie mayhem within a post, this has been pretty tame.  It is probably with muskie more than any other fish too, that people become skeptical or hold seriously strong opinions.  If Laz or Barbosa were members here, then the replies would likely be more positive too."
756211,Pigeontroller,2013-01-04 02:54:00,2793," Not sure who the ""good for you"" comments would be directed at...  Neither the Angler nor the Guide are apart of this thread, or forum that we know of...  I'd say this thread has been very civil...So far.  Just realized I boated 5 Muskies this year...I don't think their combined weight was 58 lbs..."
756214,Moosebunk,2013-01-04 03:07:00,3970, You do crack me up sometimes dood!
756217,Roy,2013-01-04 03:19:00,13728," Sure Ron, I hear from him every now and then. He had a good year this year. Also very busy with FishfactorTV. In fact we spoke of this very fish a few days ago."
756230,mike rousseau,2013-01-04 07:29:00,4661,"I didn't realize anyone was trying to take away from this amazing catch...?  I hope I can get one that heavy one day...  Also... Lazarus did not post the picture with the words ""world record"" on Facebook... That was another person....  And I posted it here to try and get more info on this awesome catch....   And that seems to be the part being discussed the most...  Lazarus is a musky god to me and a lot of other anglers.... And I don't think anyone was directing their skepticism towards Lazarus' clients catch... But towards the edited pic reading ""world record"""
756249,Rich Nelson,2013-01-04 13:14:00,332,"So now guys shouldnt post Musky threads because there isnt enough ""good for you"" comments... Same old story here. Its not negetavive comments about the fish ( because there arent any here)  Its the few guys on here with nothing better to do then complain about Musky posts in hopes that they go south. Its a giant fish... One of many giants for Laz, so no real surprise.  Not a World record. Good for you Laz!   There, are the anti Musky thread guys happy now?... Grow up"
756252,Rich Nelson,2013-01-04 13:19:00,332,  So now lets see what guys consider the real World record Musky... ( and I dont mean released fish with stretched proportions)
756255,lew,2013-01-04 13:21:00,12766,So sad...
756267,Rich Nelson,2013-01-04 13:57:00,332, For me its the Ken O Brian fish from Georgian Bay...
756269,outllaw,2013-01-04 14:00:00,1232,since 1956 when i first went musky fishing. its never changed has it. mines bigger the yours lol.
756274,muskymatt,2013-01-04 14:26:00,2608,"This thread is testament to how dysfunctional the fishing community, and more so the Muskie fishing world is. A well know guy catches a very nice fish,doesn't post or make claims on it, yet someone else does it for him on a site he's not even on. Everybody get their knickers in a knot about it and the next thing you know, arguments pop up, the thread goes off topic, uncivil and ultimately locked.  No wonder posting pics of big fish is rare!

And supposedly its a new record...  Photobucket isn't working so I can't post the pic I have... But it looks like a lelease shot with a hand on her belly...

This is what it looks like to high-five a WORLD RECORD MUSKY! This 58.5 pound fish is the largest musky caught this year, in recent memory, and (depending who you ask) possibly EVER. Guided by close friend and musky superpower ""Laz"", client Ed Barbosa (a seasoned trophy muskyman) caught this historic fish and weighed it on an IGFA certified scale t...o take all doubt from the guesswork that surrounds most catches approaching this caliber. Musky Hunter, the authority on musky fishing in print, television, and online will have the full story and photos very soon. Here is a glimpse for you now of the most incredible catch of 2012. Happy New Year from Uncut Angling!!!! #Released #CatchAndCatchAgain"

755618,ehg,2013-01-01 06:33:00,2666,Always thought that my ultimate fishing adventure would be to spend a week in December fishing with Mike Lazurus around there. This guy is hardcore into getting the biggest muskies in the world(which are around Montreal). This fish he caught back 15 yrs. ago or so was 58.5 inches and the biggest musky seen. The head on it is way bigger than Ed Barboa's head.LOL 
755631,Crazy Ivan,2013-01-01 12:53:00,184,Congrats to Ed Barbosa on a giant fish release.  I'd like to know how it was weighed. Cradle?  Also I'm curious about the certified scale. Was it on land? Or a hand-held scale in the boat?  I guess I'll have to wait for more info to come out.
755708,Rich Nelson,2013-01-02 00:28:00,332,"Anothergiant for Laz and Barbosa. As for catch and release record... Well there is no such thing. Very few guys carry a certifiable scale on their boat , and length and girth formulas are a joke. I wouldnt doubt if it could be a record of some sort, as Laz is the best of the best, and has caught many giants. Unfortunately, a fish has to be killed for it to be a true record."
755716,Musky or Specks,2013-01-02 00:59:00,2710,Years ago Mike spoke at our club. Him and Gord Pyzer are the two guys whose techniques I use the most. Laz's water sifting is still the first technique I use of the day.
755819,Handlebarz,2013-01-02 18:39:00,3790,What a huge gut on that fish I'm looking forward to reading about it more

756066,mike rousseau,2013-01-03 16:01:00,4661,  Because the pic says world record?  I miss read originally... I thought it was 58.5 inches not pounds...  And if it was 58.5 long with the 30.5 girth that would have put it around or over 65 pounds.....
