756944,porkpie,2013-01-06 21:42:00,2521,"When I used to fish in the dead of winter, erindale was one place that I could almost always count on to have a few open holes.  I don't fish now unless there is a significant thaw with some runoff.  I'm not much for onesy twosey anymore, and it has to be worth my while!  I suspect you'll at least have some fishable water on that section of the credit though!"
