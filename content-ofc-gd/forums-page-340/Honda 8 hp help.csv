756582,strik,2013-01-05 16:47:00,175,"Hi  Just wondering if anyone knows  someone/dealer  who works on honda outboards in the London  to Owen Sound area  ?  Would like to  find  someone i can trust..  Would like for them to go over the engine,give it a tune up and see  how strong the compression is. If the eng  checks out i want to look into purchasing a controll king or troll master for it. With the engine being  older (mid 90`s) i would hate to  put on  a controller, if the eng is on its way out. So far for  two years the eng has ran great  just one fuel issue.  Thanks Strik  If you woudl like to pm thats fine as well"
756584,GBW,2013-01-05 16:59:00,8460,I have the same honda and it's FAR brom being on 'its way out'! If you were closer to the Markham area I would offer a place for you but I gather it's too far
756588,bare foot wader,2013-01-05 17:14:00,1354,"being mid 90's you are also limited to prop selection, if you upgraded to a 2000 or newer used you can swap in a high thrust prop and install troll master"
756946,strik,2013-01-06 21:50:00,175,GBW i might have to take you up on the offer maybe the longer drive will be worth it    Surprized  no one local that someone can recommend.  Might have to rethink the next honda. I had a heck of a time getting a part  for it last year.    Thanks

757032,Mike the Pike,2013-01-07 01:30:00,3421, Ya I made the switch from Honda to Yamaha Although I have had 3 Hondas a 7.5 sold it ..was 26 yrs old very reliable  My 50 Honda 8 yrs nothing but reliable and wow very economical on fuel but compared to any other brand of 50 hp it was the slowest in its class .I currently have a Honda 2hp runs great.  I have my Yamaha for 5 yrs now .the best outboard I have ever owned.  BTW your 8HP Honda should run problem free for a long time in maintained.  good Luck
757354,strik,2013-01-08 00:45:00,175,  Thanks  Mike  this is what im trying to accomplish
