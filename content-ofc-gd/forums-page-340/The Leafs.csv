756807,Guest,2013-01-06 16:20:00,0,Well we all heard the good news.  My question is when the leafs win the cup this year will it really count cause its not a full season.  I go with yes cause a cup is a cup and a full regular season or half season I will be crying in front of my TV when they lift the cup.  Discuss

756814,Broker,2013-01-06 16:30:00,482,   LOL
756821,Guest,2013-01-06 16:40:00,0,  Ya those pigs are flying to the ACC to watch those leafs win another cup.lol
756827,Guest,2013-01-06 16:51:00,0,"  28-18-3 sounds pretty good.  They wont be at the top, but as longs as Reimer is hopefully back to his old self then there is a good chance there getting home ice advantage in the first round."
756884,davey buoy,2013-01-06 18:42:00,5505,"There is no first half now,I think It will be tough{what did they do in the off season},remind me if I forgot something,lol.Every team I believe will come out full tilt,so I would expect a tough go.imo. Go Leafs Go!!!!!"
756934,fishhunter,2013-01-06 21:14:00,604,Only cup leafs will be lifting is the coffee cup at the club house before tee off as they don't make the playoffs once again. Go Bruins Go lol
756940,kemper,2013-01-06 21:26:00,2232,"With the goaltending situation in Toronto the way it is, it will be nice to see them win a game never mind the cup.  Riemer and Scrivens are a real 1-2 punch.  What's that, Luongo you say?  Yeah, that'll help"
756943,jedimaster,2013-01-06 21:36:00,3472,"There is going to be a lot of moves made, 2 player buyout per team will open up a fair bit of talent. Lou still on the block. We will see. I am going to reserve judgement until we see what team will hit the ice."
