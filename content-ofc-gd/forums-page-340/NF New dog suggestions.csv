756638,Joey,2013-01-05 21:25:00,9122,"I'm extremely happy with Ralphie, our French Bulldog.  He has proven he loves the boat, loves going on trips to cabins (we'll be testing him on camping this year), is great travelling and loves the snow! I even took him tobogganing the other week and he loved that!  He did not too bad in the water, but was less than a year old when we tested his swimming skills last summer, so this summer will be a better indicator.  He wasn't too bad to house train and I'm slowly teaching him other things now.  He is extremely loyal and loving and loves all other dogs and really loves children!  I also noticed he is very smart.  From the description of Frenchies I read when making my decision to get one, one of my drawbacks was that they said they were not very intelligent.  Well I lucked out as Ralphie is very intelligent."

756644,Dabluz,2013-01-05 22:09:00,701,"I've had a few dogs...all mutts.  All of them have been great.  As to how the dog behaves depends on the owner.  Everybody has been wowed by my dogs, how the behaved, how they obey and even how they seem to know what I say to them.  Some of my dogs had talents.  One dog who I had when I did a lot of grouse and rabbit hunting develloped into a great hunting dog.  She would yip when she saw grouse and yelp if she saw a rabbit.  She would walk in front of me a few yards and would either go left when I pointed left and right when I pointed right and she would flush out the game onto the trail in front of me.  However, she never liked the sound of the shotgun.  She would run away when I raised the shotgun and then come back after the shot....lol.  The last dog I had was a spaniel mix with some border colley mix.  Excellent dog.  I got it at the SPCA.  It had been mistreated by it's original owner and was very timid at the start.  Would pee on the floor when someone spoke loud.  Ordinarily, this would not have been a good dog to get but I guess I got her just in time.  Very obedient and would obey anyone.....to a point that if my wife told it to stay put, no one else could make her do anything....even me.  And the reverse was also true.  This dog did shed hair year round."

756653,captpierre,2013-01-05 23:13:00,2521,"I have a lot of experience with the dog world.  There is a dog out there for every lifestyle.  Big dogs are more expensive to keep and don't live as long.  Small dogs are the opposite.  Temperament is the most important.  Some breeds tend to be bombproof -like retrievers and beagles, and some can be touchy -poodles, spaniels, shepherds.  Male or female.  Do you want a dog that loves water and will be wet and stinky all the time, or one that won't go in and stays dry.  Short coat or long.  Shedding or not.  Non shedders need to clipped every 8-12 wks.  $40-60 if you can't do it yourself.  Some breeds are ravenous eaters -labs, beagles etc.  this makes no food safe anywhere unless locked up  Will he be in deep snow -then you need longer legs.  Do you want a guard type dog to protect property, or a friendly one that would welcome the attention of a stranger  Purebred dogs cost about $600-$2000 as a pup from a breeder.  Then come 2 more sets of shots and neutering/spaying -that's another $500-800 before he's a year old.  Getting a dog from a shelter or rescue can be an awesome experience or a terrible one.  Some of these dogs have behavioural problems and have been returned.  But often they come vaccinated and neutered and can be had for free or minimal cost  On average, mutts have less medical problems thanks to crossbreeding.  Many purebreads are highly inbred  and  have more heritable problems that can lead to serious medical bills down the road.  So.  My advice would be to monitor the website petfinder.com.  You enter your area, and the type of dog you are looking for.  They do a search of all the rescues and shelters in the area starting with the closest one to you.  Don't be in a rush.  There are always new dogs coming up.  Take the family to go and check it out.  Ask for a leash and take the dog for a test walk.  Carefully touch him all over. Look for a ""kind eye"" and a wagging tail. Maybe even go to the local dog park to see how he interacts with other dogs.  Training once you get him home is key.  Dogs follow the leader.  You and everyone in you family needs to show leadership to the dog everyday.  Teach him basic commands.  especially ""sit"".  A dog should be made to sit everytime you do something for him.  Treat, meal, hookup to go out, then unhook.  Immediate praise when he complies. Repeat the command and follow thru if he doesn't.  If the dog respects you and is made to consistently listen to all commands by all members of the family, this will go a long way to ensuring minimal aggression and defiant behaviour.  There are no guarantees in the dog world.  Google various breeds.  Look up the ""Dog Whisperer"" and follow his advice. Good dogs rarely just happen.  It takes training.  Like we've all been trained by our women"

So, check out your blood lines, etc., etc, before you buy. I saw some dogs today that were way over inbred, by my standards, but no problems have showed up yet.  I'd take one of them home, in a flash.      Oh, by the way, it's pet posts that usually get me suspended.  So, I'm done."

Long story short I'm really missing having a dog and am looking for a new one. My family is energetic, always on the go and we want the dog to be great with kids, people, cats basically everything. We dont want anything with shepherd or rottie or collie in it. So do any of you guys have suggestions on a great breed of dog that loves the outdoors? It can also be a mutt to doesnt matter to me Thanks!"
756559,Spiel,2013-01-05 15:32:00,9065,Have you considered checking with local shelters for adoptions?

756562,Tomcat,2013-01-05 15:41:00,395,I'd personally recommend a Labrador Retriever. Due diligence will go a long ways towards ensuring you get the kind of dog you want.

756568,Bernie,2013-01-05 16:00:00,3190,Have had two Golden Retrievers. Both have been excellent. The only issue for some is the hair. Randy is likely looking at the Golden Doodle because of that.
756590,Broker,2013-01-05 17:19:00,482,Kind of went off the charts here.. But saw an add on kijiji for newfoundland pups.. Going to check them out today. Researched the breed and it sounds like they love the water and are well behaved dogs
756593,bigugli,2013-01-05 17:37:00,6138,"Behaviour and temperament of a dog has more to do with the upbringing and training of the individual dog, than the breed itself. Resist the urge to bring home pups as soon as possible. It is a convenience and money saver for the breeder. Some pups are even weaned prematurely by a breeder. It is a constant problem encountered with pups from large scale and small scale puppy mills. My wife and kids brought home one such puppy, at 9 weeks, despite my hesitation. What a mistake. That breeder, and a few pet stores, were finally busted for running a puppy mill operation. A good vet ( read old school) will help steer you towards a reputable breeder Any reputable breeder will wait 12 weeks or more before removing a pup from it's litter. Generally,the longer the pup is interacting with the litter, the better it will socialize with other dogs. After that it's up to the owner of the new pup to teach it social skills with children, strange dogs, strange people."
756595,misfish,2013-01-05 17:40:00,29133,"  They get big and slubber big time. If I had the room,I would have one.    GREAT CHOICE."

756597,Sinker,2013-01-05 17:46:00,8692,"Id check the pounds first, if your not picky on a breed.  Some of my best dogs have been mutts from the pound.  I have a chocolate lab right now, that I adopted from Harrison here on OFC. Great dog, gets along with anyone, and anything. He's my best bud! He goes everywhere with me, but he is just a pet.  My next dog is going to be another lab, but strictly a hunting retriever.  You won't be dissappointed with a newfoundland. They are a great breed, gentle giants, and I've never met one I didn't like! They are big though....eat a lot, crap alot, and take up a lot of space. A friend of mine has one though, and he is an awesome dog! I wouldn't think twice about getting one, but I need a hunting retreiver, so a lab its going to be for me!  You can't go wrong with a golden either. My dad has had golden retrievers for as long as I can remember, and they are one of the smartest, most willing to please breeds I know. Awesome dogs.  Good luck in your search! Everyone should have a dog in the family! I'm lost without one!   S."
756598,bigbuck,2013-01-05 17:49:00,2449,"I know you don't want shepherd, but we have a dutch shepherd/german shepherd mix and she is a great family dog, playful, friendly to a fault and pretty good with other dogs. Socializing with other dogs IS KEY. Same goes for people. Good luck in your search. Check kijiji as well. Quite a few people are looking to give away their dogs so its a good place to check."
756606,Ralph Field,2013-01-05 18:18:00,1018,"If you find a rescue dog make sure that some family has fostered it for awhile, so they can tell you what issues the dog has. We have to hire a dog sitter if we want to go out together."

756615,Cookslav,2013-01-05 19:09:00,1457,"So to me...you described my Beagles to every detail  My beagles are incredibly loyal....They follow me anywhere I go. They cry when I leave and meet me at the door with the most insane happy welcome you could imagin. I have 3 kids who they pla with day and night, they never bite, they never get agressive and they totally love my kids. I also have 4....yes 4 cats. They dogs love the cats....the cats are not quite as fond of the dogs though  My first Beagle(Spud) we got from a rescue 2 years ago. I'm not sure but you may recall the thread in which he paid me back for adopting him BIG TIME...as our Garage caught fire and no one had noticed...except him. He went ballistic scratching at the door, barking etc... To draw attention to the issue....we caught the fire in time, and saved our home....barely. We saved him...he saved us so we're even LOL!!!  But since I've noticed he is ridiculously freindly with other dogs and even more so with other hounds...beagles in particular. So we got him a brother in November named Buster.  They are best buds, and hunting partners to boot. Those wasacally wabbits beware!    Honestly, I love the Beagles temperment, and playfullness. Despite snoopys reputation...they are no dumb breed. Mine do plenty of tricks like fetch, shake, roll over play dead, stay....get that rabbit LOL...  Anyway... Great dogs, and there are always a ton in the rescues this time of year. Many are used for the deer hunt in November and end up lost or abandoned. Just my $0.02 but for a mid sized dog they fit the bill for a sports dog (hunting) and a family pet perfect. My Grandfather had them as well as Black and Tan Hounds so I'm a bit Bias I guess being I grew up around them.  Good luck!"

PLEASE DO NOT BUY designer dogs most of these breeders don't have the first clue on why a dog should be breed.  A dog should only be breed to improve the breed for instance when we breed a field trial dog its breed for talent, drive and personality not looks etc. We don't care if they're ugly HEHE! Only that they are healthy and have the previously mentions qualityies.  Seriouly  consider your lifestyle so many people buy a dog because it's cute, with no consideration to what this animal will need to be happy and healthy.
