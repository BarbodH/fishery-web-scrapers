My father just asked me this week if I would move back home and help him take care of the family farm as he aged. We're looking ad adding a prefab cabin/cottage to the property. Nothing incredibly fancy but comfortable enough for me the fianc√© and one or two kids down the road. We're looking around 700 sq ft with a loft. No basement. And on a separate septic from the main house. We could use the same well. My main concern is getting permits anyone have any tips on dealing with the planning department. I've heard there lax on "" seasonal farm help residences"". We're located outside of alliston. We plan on heating with Woodstove and baseboards as a backup. Any help is appreciated as I'm way outa my league here.  Dammit I can't edit the title."
757088,John Bacon,2013-01-07 05:09:00,3277,I think that anything that includes both a kitchen and sleeping quarters would count as a separate residence. I am not sure what the zoning laws allow; you may have to sever a piece of the property in order to build a separate residence.  I think you can have everything except a stove before it legally becomes a separate residence.  Zoning laws for farms may be a bit more liberal though.
757090,BillM,2013-01-07 05:30:00,17367,700sqft with a wife and two kids seems awfully small.
757091,Freshtrax,2013-01-07 05:47:00,2215,Can always put an extension on after:).  700-1000 sq ft.  + Loft There's a 6 bedroom farmhouse on the property as well  we just need some space to call our own.
757092,bigugli,2013-01-07 06:19:00,6138,"As a rule, help houses are supposed to be temporary structures. The usual buildings being portables, mobile homes, trailers. All of which lack a foundation. The moment you lay down a foundation for living accomodations, your structure will fall under the Ontario building code. Perhaps the municipality may give some leeway. I have not met many building inspectors willing to show much flexibility, mind I stopped building houses 12 years back."
757093,Freshtrax,2013-01-07 06:55:00,2215,If I can get permits I would live to go that route.  Not sure if they will give me one without  a severance.  I sent some emails this weekend I guess I will find out next week.

After all is said and done , it dose'nt matter to the powers that be who ends up living in either house on the property ."
757163,Freshtrax,2013-01-07 15:38:00,2215,Just talked to the planning department.  Because its zoned agricultural granny suite is out.  Only possibility is farm help.  Means less than 800sq ft and no foundation.  She said its mostly for trailers but as long as its got no foundation you could push the envelope a little.  Any ideas?  I'm thinking doubblewide and brick up the bottom to make it look like a bungalow.
757164,SmokestackLightnin,2013-01-07 15:39:00,390,Just pray the property does not fall on the flood plain controlled by the Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority (NVCA).
757169,Skipper D,2013-01-07 16:12:00,1970,"  Funny hu , where a granny suite is needed the most , its not aloud , crazy stuff , guess they don't want any one coming back home to take over the farms , size wise then  is also restricted on what you can do , i think they got you with the 800 sq ft thing , where do you put the kids once they start coming along ??? . Guess its not an option for you to build on to the farm house ."
