757150,jedimaster,2013-01-07 15:08:00,3472,  Looks like a fancy cormorant to me. I say kill them all they are clearly depleting the fish stocks.
757196,Steve,2013-01-07 17:34:00,2075,"""If you know a thing about these windmills the energy can't be stored for long so has to be sold, which goes for cheap.""  wow - rather misinformed.  wind turbines don't determine if energy can be stored - they only create energy.  it is up to the owner to determine if they want to harness and sell back to the grid, or store it.  nothing to do with the turbine itself.  as long as they don't move offshore, i'm for the most part 100% a-ok with wind turbines."
757201,Rich,2013-01-07 17:56:00,3927," Do taxes not also go into nuclear and coal power generation? Im sorry i thought these were government controlled?  And the turbines certainly can, and do, store the energy. Not all of them, just most.  Quebec is in Canada, so no matter where the Canadian power is going, at least it's staying in Canada. And our power is not discounted to any other countries, no matter how it was harvested."
757206,jedimaster,2013-01-07 18:18:00,3472,"In Ontario power generation is private, well crown corp. OPG runs the bulk of the plants and Hydro One runs the bulk of distribution.  OPG has 4 nuke plants(two leased to bruce power), 5 thermal stations(coal and diesle) 65 hydro electric, and 2 wind urbines.  96% of the power produced is either nuclear, hydroelectric or wind."
757212,ratherboutdoors,2013-01-07 18:34:00,132,There is always a fine line between developing society and protecting nature.
757215,DoubleDigits,2013-01-07 19:11:00,140,"I don't think anyone really falls for this silly crap. A Conservative, anti-environmental advocacy group screaming bloody murder over a birds nest?? Puleeze..."
757216,Joeytier,2013-01-07 19:12:00,3990,Yep.  Thanks for the correction.
757228,Steve,2013-01-07 19:48:00,2075,"Rich, tubines don't contain any storage capacity.  they can only generate.  the generated power is then transmitted to storage devices (forms of batteries), or to the grid.  storing power is not practical ($$$$), which is why all our power generators (coal, hydro, nuclear, etc) all send their power directly back to the grid."
757229,F7Firecat,2013-01-07 19:53:00,347,"Fisherville isnt like n/w ontario or peterborough or any other place where bald eagles are prevalent. Fisherville has ONE nest that I know of which is now gone.  Fisherville for those that do not know is a nice quiet farmland area. I live 20 minutes away and I know it sure is nice to know that such things like bald eagles live in my neck of the woods, it remains to be seen what will become of them.  These energy people walked in and cut down an ACTIVE bald eagle nest that was there before the windmill project even came to fruition. They could have moved the road or windmill but they chose to cut it down.  Remember this is the year 2013,  this is complete Bull that this was ever allowed to happen. Money talks and crap walks unfortunately.  To put it into prespective, think of it as if a cottager on your favorite lake built a dock and destroyed a bunch of spawning habitat for bass, muskie or whatever.  Then the MNR chooses to look the other way becasue of well i wont say but the cottager has lots of $$$$$. Im sure people would be crying the blues. But hey the fish can just move on and build another nest at another spawing location can they not...........  Next maybe your favorite bass area on Lake Simcoe will be filled with windmills, I know they proposed to have them on LSC right out in the water, wouldn;t that be awesome."

757239,pylon,2013-01-07 20:25:00,68,I have a nest by our cottage. 25 years and still breeding. I'm guessing a few generations have brooded there. (Near Thunder Bay )

756823,kickingfrog,2013-01-06 16:43:00,8333,"Hate arguing the side of a corp but bald eagles are a close equivalent to seagulls and the middle of winter is the right time because if the nest had remained, there would be a bigger pr disaster come the nesting season."
756828,Steve,2013-01-06 16:51:00,2075,Alternatives may not always advisable.  
756829,Live2fish85,2013-01-06 16:55:00,1633,There is only 57 nests in Ontario now one less. I don't agree about them being anything like seagulls.  If you think windmills are good do some research. There are useless.
756830,kickingfrog,2013-01-06 17:04:00,8333, I don't know where you got the number of 57 from and I never commented on the pro/con of the windmills. Bald eagles are scavengers.
756837,Dave Bailey,2013-01-06 17:10:00,1641,"MNR quote:   If they don't nest there again then the mortality rate for that location is, in essence, 100%. ""Oh dear, they might get killed flying into a turbine so let's prevent them breeding at all!"" I think there might be more to this than we've heard so far. No real ideas, just a feeling."
756840,Christopheraaron,2013-01-06 17:12:00,3525, Don't think this fish would agree...   
756845,SmokestackLightnin,2013-01-06 17:21:00,390,"They need to adjust their facts a bit.  There are more than 57 bald eagle nests in Ontario.  The actual fact is there were 57 known active bald eagle nests in Southern Ontario in 2011, up from 51 in 2010.  Of those 57, 41 were successful in reproduction.  It is not known how many bald eagle nests there are in Ontario, the study only covers Southern Ontario.  The article also mentions that this was an active nest.  Each active nest is monitored and numbered accordingly, I wonder which nest this artice refers to?  I had the pleasure of watching FR-1 for a number of years on Bobs Lake in Frontenac County.  It was very productive nest.  Here is the most recent report (2011) from the Southern Ontario monitoring program, it's a quick read but gives a good insight on the eagle population going in the right direction:   http://www.birdscanada.org/download/BAEArpt.pdf"
756850,kickingfrog,2013-01-06 17:27:00,8333," You mean a half dead floater? Bald eagles rarely kill their own prey, they most often will scavenge other animal's kills or steal from others. These are facts, not opinions or perceptions. This also doesn't mean that they have no value, far from it, but proper perspective is needed."
756858,captpierre,2013-01-06 17:42:00,2521,Would the breeding pair not just build a new one?
756860,kickingfrog,2013-01-06 17:47:00,8333,"Careful, the weak stance taken can't take much scrutiny."
756863,Live2fish85,2013-01-06 17:53:00,1633,"  I never said that they don't make power. I said they are useless. When do we get the most wind? spring and fall. When do we use the least hydro?  Spring and fall. If you know a thing about these windmills the energy can't be stored for long so has to be sold, which goes for cheap.  Look at Spain they are full of them and they rarely use them.  You can't get rid of the power plants as windmills are useless. So what is the point.   As for the Blade Eagles I apologize on my answer lol. I miss read and answered before checking again. Thank you for the read though."
756881,stendec,2013-01-06 18:37:00,22,"I agree, do a bit of reading on these windmills that are popping up all over Ontario they cost a lot more than they are worth, break down all the time and cause problems with birds and bats. Check out the 'Shadow Flicker' effect that they cause on nearby homes. If you like them so much, go move next to one. As for the eagles nest, typical MNR."
756896,jim,2013-01-06 19:21:00,124,"While it's true that Eagles,[like wolves and bears] will scavange gut piles etc. , they do hunt their own prey.  I've watched them take ducks, loons and fish, at my camp in Quebec. They will also hit our fish gut pile that we maintain on an island nearby.  Anyone who hunts moose in noprthern Ontario, can attest to the fact, that there must be many more than 57 nests in Ontario.  They are very prevelent."
756898,manitoubass2,2013-01-06 19:29:00,11391,"We have 8 or so right near are house. There everywhere in out little area of NW Ontario.  They do hunt and they do scavenge.  Very beautiful birds, I enjoy watching them.  Destroying a nest doesn't sit easy with me"
756914,lew,2013-01-06 20:05:00,12766," I'm sure there are many many more than 57 in the entire province. I'm in the Kawarthas where Bald Eagles are relatively new and I've got 2 nests within walking distance.  I took this pic a couple months back right above my house, and yesterday while working outside one flew overhead so low I could darn near reach up and touch him. By the time I got the camera he was gone.    Here's 2 more birds from not too far away a couple years back.    "

757031,Joeytier,2013-01-07 01:29:00,3990,LOL@ the 57 nests in Ontario Bull.  Bald eagle numbers have been increasing steadily for decades since the banning of CFC's nearly wiped them out decades ago.  Nothing 'sickening' about this.  That article was P3TA-calibre stupidity.
757100,mbac31,2013-01-07 11:28:00,904,Pigeons wearing tuxedos comment will have me laughing all day.
757102,Rich,2013-01-07 11:43:00,3927,Obviously if you actually have a problem with power production you have that choice of not using power.
757104,Live2fish85,2013-01-07 12:03:00,1633,  Yea well we don't have the choice of paying taxes on the dumb things which is going to be ridiculous.  Also this isn't doing anything to make things greener as they say. They have to keep to Power plants running as the wind turbines aren't a sufficient energy producer.
757106,Rich,2013-01-07 12:30:00,3927,"There's drawbacks to every source of electricity, even solar.."
757107,Live2fish85,2013-01-07 12:33:00,1633,Yes but those drawbacks aren't going to cost us a huge jump in taxes. They will sell most of the power from these turbines to Quebec and the states for less then what we are paying for it to be made.
