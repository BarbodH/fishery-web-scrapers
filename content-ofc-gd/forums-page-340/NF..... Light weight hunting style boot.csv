757025,Burtess,2013-01-07 01:15:00,901,"I am looking for a light weight hunting style boot, little or no insulation for spring / summer / fall bushwacking.  When I was in my late teens (late '80's) I had a pair of Kodiak Wilderness Boots.  They were super light weight and had just a small amount of insulation, they had very flexible soles and were very comfortable.  This is what I am looking for.  I have looked at the Danner Jackal II (not much tread on these) and the Irish Setter Upland DSS, both are around 40oz.  Also I have seen some Redhead boots that are very light weight but I don't know if the quality is up there with the other Brand names?  I am sure Cabelas has some self branded boots that would fit the bill but being no where near a store makes it difficult to evaluate from just a description.  Any other suggestions?  Thanks, Burt"

757156,jedimaster,2013-01-07 15:28:00,3472,"I have a pair of irish setters and a pair of red heads. I like both of them. the red heads are older now and are gortex, never leaked for me and did just fine for about 4 or 5 years, lots of km's on them. The Setters I have are the 2000 gram thinsulate ones, not light and heavily insulated, so I couldn't comment on those for you but they have been pretty good thus far."

757172,NBR,2013-01-07 16:17:00,163,LL Bean Maine Hunting Shoe. Rubber bottoms leather tops dry and not overly warm. I've worn them for over 40 years bird hunting. Be sure to get the insoles.
