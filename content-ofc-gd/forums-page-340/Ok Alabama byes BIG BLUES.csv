756643,Luke V.,2013-01-05 22:04:00,286,This vid had me asking for more on every fish! Just awesome!!!
756654,Terry,2013-01-05 23:23:00,14456,Well now I see why those guys thought I was crazy when I told them they had to reel in all the other rods and only use one each when fishing in canada
756662,aplumma,2013-01-05 23:39:00,6896,It is very possible we run 5 rods off the back of the boat (legally)dead baiting. Our best day was 1500 lbs now it is not a normal day but we usually average 200-400 lbs averaging 20-30 lbs each. The Blue Catfish is not considered a game fish and in my area it is an invasive species. I wish it was different I find them to be a great fish and since they are an invasive species the trotliners can set as many lines as they want and sell them as fertilizer if they chose.GRRRRR   Art
