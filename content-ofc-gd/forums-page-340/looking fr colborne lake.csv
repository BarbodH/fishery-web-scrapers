756782,dave524,2013-01-06 15:16:00,4508,"Probably Coburn lake in Haliburton. North of Haliburton Lake, down a hydro rightaway, often unmarked on maps , it is just south of Beanpole that is usually named on maps.  oops edit: didn't noticed the near Apsley comment in the topic, guess i let the cat out of the bag on those 2 lakes"

Scoot up HWY 28 from Peterborough and hang a left on Dyno Road (careful on this road as it's winding and only sanded in winter, no salt). Take this to the end and make a left on 118. Colbourne Lake (with a 'u') will be immediately on the right. I don't know the access though but explore the cottage roads and you may find something. http://goo.gl/maps/ipmWZ   If you can't find access to that, there are some other lakes in the area that might be worth checking out. PM me if you need some access info."
757026,Joeytier,2013-01-07 01:20:00,3990,Yep..easy to get to...I fished a couple of those stocked lakes last winter and thought it was so strange to be ice fishing trout on a lake lined with cottages
