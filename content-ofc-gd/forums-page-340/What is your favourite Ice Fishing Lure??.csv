756619,Cookslav,2013-01-05 19:29:00,1457,"I'm fairly new to the Ice fishing scene but I've had the best luck with a simple Spit shot, hook & minnow. Some of the guys I go with use Jig heads tipped with minnows and swear by Chartreuse or orange but in truth....they don't get any more fish then I do so I'm not really sold that the Jig head (or color) adds anything to the waters I fish. I've used a Swedish Pimple, and jigging raps as well in a variety of colors and sizes but non produced better for me then a live minnow on a hook.  "
756627,Sinker,2013-01-05 20:22:00,8692,If I could only have one lure for icefishing it would be a half and half williams #50. No question.  I've caught every fish that swims on that lure.  S.
756717,Acountdeleted,2013-01-06 04:34:00,2562,  Changed my mind. If I had one lure it would be whatever Chad lends me. Its the only way I can catch walleye.
756725,BillM,2013-01-06 05:16:00,17367, Add a few maggots to that bottom treble and that's my best perch bait by far (Even in open water)

756776,Rod Caster,2013-01-06 14:51:00,5784," hahaha. You should of added 3"" chartreuse twister and a 1/4oz jig head right from the start."
756805,wallacio,2013-01-06 16:16:00,475,"  Definitely...I never set foot on the ice for Brookies without bringing worms!   You don't always need them but more often than not, they save the day!"

756313,Acountdeleted,2013-01-04 17:15:00,2562,Micro tube with a minnow head. The panfish love it and even some of the sport fish will hit it if you convince them.
