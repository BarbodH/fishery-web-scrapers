756995,Rod Caster,2013-01-07 00:20:00,5784,"Just wondering if anyone knows of any online resources for identifying unnamed lakes? There are several year-round brookie lakes in the MNR Regs, that are called Lake 123 for example and I can't seem to pinpoint the lake any more than within township borders."
757000,kickingfrog,2013-01-07 00:34:00,8333,They usually give a township and or a utm don't they?
757016,Rod Caster,2013-01-07 00:52:00,5784," Some lakes (very few in Zone 11) have utm but in most cases only have township ID. I have a OGS Google Earth map for township boundaries, but up here, a single township can have several unnamed brookie lakes."

757020,gaspumper,2013-01-07 01:03:00,393,If they are stocked lakes don't they usually give the gps co ordinance for them.
757023,Rod Caster,2013-01-07 01:11:00,5784,"Thanks 4x4.  I'm looking at the online reg summary, maybe the booklet has GPS?"
757038,Snowball,2013-01-07 01:43:00,167,"Here is a site that helps you find the location of Lakes. It covers mostly NorthWestern Ontario but goes as far as and includes North Bay:  http://nomap.ca/%28S...29%29/Home.aspx  Click on FIND Goto ""select a map category"", click on down arrowhead and click on ""Lakes"" Enter a lake name select a MNR district (click on down arrowhead) (if district is unknown click on ""all districts"" click on Search and your lake should appear.  Regards, Snowball"
