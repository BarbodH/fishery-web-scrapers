754808,kickingfrog,2012-12-28 18:59:00,8333,I'm looking to try turducken. I haven't seen it in stores in Barrie. I found a distributer in Louisiana but shipping is $170.
754809,Spiel,2012-12-28 19:02:00,9065,   Too much Rob.
754810,Roy,2012-12-28 19:06:00,13728,"It's not a big job to make, Rob."
754811,kickingfrog,2012-12-28 19:09:00,8333,"At $60 for a 15lb creature, I was willing to try it once. But $176.08 for shipping was just not going to happen."
754812,Roy,2012-12-28 19:10:00,13728,You can buy them here...scroll down to your location. Call first maybe....  http://www.theoriginalturducken.com/where-to-buy
754815,kickingfrog,2012-12-28 19:31:00,8333," For the first time, I'd rather spend a bit more to invest less prep time."
754817,misfish,2012-12-28 19:34:00,29133,Zhers use to sell it Rob. I also seen it at Sobeys.
754820,kickingfrog,2012-12-28 19:39:00,8333,"I didn't see them at either store. Figured I maybe missed them or, more likely, they were out."
754821,Terry,2012-12-28 19:40:00,14456,"boy if they had bacon with it, it would be the perfect meal"
754829,misfish,2012-12-28 19:59:00,29133, They usually are in a box. You might want to try Freshco. They seem to have everything.  Intersection: Bayfield & Livingstone Address: 409 Bayfield Street Barrie L4M 6E5 Ontario Phone: 705-739-1100
754831,Fisherman,2012-12-28 20:02:00,7201,What's the ramming speed when making one of those?  How many does it take to hold the turk when the ducken comes in for the insertion?
754837,Jigger,2012-12-28 20:44:00,1237,"Would try in the deep fryer. Wouldn't be hard to baconize it, either..."
754850,Muskieman,2012-12-28 21:45:00,2472,MMMm Turducken  
754851,Christopheraaron,2012-12-28 21:48:00,3525, LOL! love that ad
754852,kickingfrog,2012-12-28 21:50:00,8333, The one site (the $176 shipping one) mentions that because it is solid meat with no cavity the turducken is not suitable for deep frying. But the bacon is a good idea I think.
754864,mercman,2012-12-28 22:53:00,7054, :rofl2:   Choked on my turkey sandwich !!!!!
755061,nofish4me,2012-12-29 22:36:00,404,For some reason I cannot play this.  Quest for Turducken
755068,spincast,2012-12-29 23:08:00,3279,still can get past the first syllable and think of food.
755105,nancur373,2012-12-30 02:14:00,1211, PURDUCKEN. Saw it on Duck Dynasty I believe. Turducken stuffed in a pig
755108,kickingfrog,2012-12-30 02:17:00,8333," Now, you're just being ridiculous."
755115,nancur373,2012-12-30 02:29:00,1211,It was on their Christmas special
755159,bigbuck,2012-12-30 03:44:00,2449,"Purducken is just wrong. Mind you, it would probably be pretty good though."
755182,chefboi17,2012-12-30 06:45:00,128,"They aren't very hard to make. when it comes to deboneing everything, you only really need to be careful with the turkeys skin in order to keep it looking right. I made 2 for separate christmas party's and the best advice I can give if you go the diy route is to have lots of counter space. Also have everything ready to go, ie string and a needle to tie the mass up, the stuffing, and the pan readyto put the beast in. Looking for instructions on youtube or google will make it very straight forward"
756613,nancur373,2013-01-05 19:02:00,1211,Just made my first one. One piece of advice...don't buy a utility turkey as they are sometimes hacked pretty good as you can see from the stitching in the stomach. luckily tho it had both wings and legs. I'll let you know later how it tastes.  
756616,camillj,2013-01-05 19:11:00,1988,Turbaconducken !
