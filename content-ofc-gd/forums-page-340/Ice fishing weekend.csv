Not looking for Simcoe, there we can go over a day. We live in Toronto and can drive 5 hours to get some good place. Wish list: * decent room * Cabins on the ice * possibility to rent snowmobile * fishing for Lake trout, white fish, Walleye Many thanks in advance."

757341,Muskieman,2013-01-08 00:12:00,2472,That's too bad ..
757342,irishfield,2013-01-08 00:14:00,26272,"Yah.. I thought it was a dumb business move, but hey I didn't buy the place so I don't get a say in it!  Always Loon Lodge in the hub or similar if you wanted to do Temagami or some places on Nippising as well."

757386,Musky or Specks,2013-01-08 01:45:00,2710,Just talked to my buddy who went this weekend They laid a beating on walleye whitefish and lakers with one pike
757398,Nipfisher,2013-01-08 02:10:00,2449,  Nipissing has no Lakers. Whiteys are a challenge.
