44319,OhioFisherman,2007-03-07 18:53:00,6623,"A question SlowPoke, roller rod? roller guides? for muskie or salmon?"
44325,SlowPoke,2007-03-07 19:01:00,2984," All roller guides to the tip. Generally used for wire line. I plan on using it for lead core. I'll be looking for rainbows, walleye and salmon but will undoubtedly find sheephead. -Brian"

44682,SlowPoke,2007-03-08 18:46:00,2984," LOL, no lottery but not for lack of trying. I'll update your list... USED Truck (partial trade deal with my Jeep) USED Boat (Made the offer awaiting the answer) USED Muskie tackle New Survival Suit - I have a theory about this. I would have bought a used one but I couldn't find any in size 3X. My theory; all the fat guys sank in thiers. -Brian"
44716,GbayGiant,2007-03-08 21:51:00,1780, Don't fat guys float.
