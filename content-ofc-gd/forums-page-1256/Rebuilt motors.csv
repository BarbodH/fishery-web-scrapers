I picked up a 1999 Yamaha 8hp 2 stroke 3 years ago for $525.00.  Take your time.Save some more $$$$$$$$ Buy something you will keep longer and trouble free.Mike
44545,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-08 03:36:00,1351,wow.. thats a heck of a deal.. never saw anything close to that.. want to sell it to me? =)
44477,Bernie,2007-03-08 00:51:00,3190,"$500 for an outboard isn't a lot but it could be a total waste if it turns out to be a dud. Hey Boatman, the late 50's outboards were works of art. Loved them. We still get them in for repairs. Beautiful engines. Well built , strong and smooooooth. The downside is environmentally very unfriendly and hard on fuel."
44490,boatman,2007-03-08 01:16:00,350,"You got that right, Nippissing! I wish there was a magic oil that would allow me to run something leaner than 24:1.  Any used motor can be a dud, whether is costs $500 or $5000 or is a late 70's or 90's."
44496,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-08 01:29:00,1351,"i got some answers from the seller:   ""Stored in our shed at the cottage but it does go below freezing.  Have stored it there for the past 15 years no problem. The motor was rebuilt as it was not starting well.  I think most of the work was on the fuel and ignition systems. This has CDI electronic ignition by the way.  The whole motor was checked.  Don't think the impeller was replaced. Lost the receipt.  I'm not sure exactly what they did but around $200-300 worth of work.  Of course we can show it running.  We used it for several years since the work was done, just bought the new motor in 06.  Feel free to do a compression test.""   I'm just waiting for the seller to pick it up from his cottage so i can take a look."
44502,boatman,2007-03-08 01:43:00,350,"That motor was not rebuilt. The carburetor was. Maybe some ignition parts, but who knows? Probably lower unit serviced, spark plugs replaced. The usual. For $200-300 they had more done than just the carb, but certainly no engine rebuild. He obviously doesn't think there is anything wrong with that motor. Check the lower unit oil, see it run, check compression if you want and if everything is ok - take it home.  If you buy it. Change the lower unit oil and replace the impeller. It needs a new impeller."
44504,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-08 01:54:00,1351,"changing oil i always do but new impeller eh? why do you think so? not to offend you, just to learn."
44507,boatman,2007-03-08 02:04:00,350,Because the owner obviously doesn't know when it was last changed so neither do you. The impeller is a rubber star shaped piece that is the heart of your cooling system. It should be changed every 5 years or sooner. Especially if the motor is stored at the ambient air temp. The freeze thaw cycle rapidly deteriorates the rubber. If it fails you could overheat your engine and fry it. Its a $20+ part that will take you 15 minutes to change. Might be a $100 bill at the marina.
44511,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-08 02:14:00,1351,ah.. i see.. well yup.. i know what the impeller is. have a manual and all but never changed it myself.  the book is somewhat confusing. im guessing a 70s 6hp would be roughly same as 70s 9.9 in terms of where to get to the impeller.  or just buy another manual =p
