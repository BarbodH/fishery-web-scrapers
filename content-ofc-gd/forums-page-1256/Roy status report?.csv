44240,cisco,2007-03-07 14:59:00,597,Surely someone lives close to him or has his phone number to check up on him. Can anybody give an update for the folks here? Sounds like he was in some kinda crisis last night  . Any Mods got some info... can you Mods do some diggin'? Can anyone here provide any kinda help in any way to the ole dwarf?
44243,ccmtcanada,2007-03-07 15:06:00,7971,"He eventually came into chat last night and said that all was well.  He figured he'd get more people in there if he posted what he did.  No need to worry, he was doing fine last night...."
44247,largemouth,2007-03-07 15:15:00,112,maybe he forgot to log off before he went fishing....
44251,cisco,2007-03-07 15:28:00,597,"Thanks for the update!   Excuse me a moment while I clear my throat......  ROY!!!!!   Glad your OK little buddy, but please counter any such crisis with good news reports when they pass! OK! Glad you are over whatever it was that's got your situation in upheaval."
44252,misfish,2007-03-07 15:28:00,29133, Roy+cold+ice= only in a tall glass. LOL  Talk to me dicky
44260,Beans,2007-03-07 15:53:00,3339,The dwarf that cried...WOLF !...Hmmmm
44348,Big Cliff,2007-03-07 20:23:00,6899,I don't buy it! I don't know what happened but Roy doesn't cry wolf and he doesn't sucker anyone into anything.
44388,Big Cliff,2007-03-07 21:50:00,6899,"Well, I have known Roy for years and I have never known him to laugh AT anyone. Clampet, I have met you, I have watched a number of your posts, I respect you, but I think you don't know Roy like I know Roy! Unitil I hear it from Roy himself I choose to believe that a person that I know asked for help and the only thing that bothers me at this point is that I wasn't there when he needed me. I'll hold that thought until I know differently!"
44402,bpsbassman,2007-03-07 22:26:00,941,"Roy, please reply to let us know that all is well."
44407,CoolB,2007-03-07 22:33:00,47,it's too late....the Illuminati already scooped up Roy to use him as the ultimate weapon against the Vatican.    I've been reading too much Dan Brown.

44445,Bernie,2007-03-07 23:56:00,3190,Geez Roy ...everybody luvs ya.....Hes ok everyone.....We were chatting with him last night
44446,Terry,2007-03-07 23:56:00,14456,"all that means is, he  has the website up on his computer... I left it up on mine one weekend and got 3   PMs asking I I wasn't replying to their questions.......I was out of town and my computer isn't on autopilot...."
44463,Daplumma,2007-03-08 00:28:00,1961,"He said in chat last night he was going fishing,I didn't catch what day he was going though. Joe"
44478,Joey,2007-03-08 00:51:00,9122,"He's fine  His sock drawer was a mess and he was missing a key piece of lego, so he rearranged the drawer and then went to Lego headquarters for that piece, but the Milwaukee brewery was on the way and he got waylayed there for awhile.  No worries!!  Joey"
44479,Bernie,2007-03-08 00:54:00,3190, That sums it up Joey!!!!  :lol:
44485,CoolB,2007-03-08 01:03:00,47," Hi Gerritt, things are good thanks. Life is busy though. As far as Lakair, I would love too but I doubt it. It hard to get time off work in the summer for me."
44486,Greencoachdog,2007-03-08 01:05:00,8163,I'll betcha he doesn't pull that one again for awhile...
