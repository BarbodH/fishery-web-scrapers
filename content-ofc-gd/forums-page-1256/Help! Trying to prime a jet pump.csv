Big -top small Bottom  Thanks for the replies, we tried for a couple hours last night, but alas couldn't get it primed. The situation is a shallow well jet pump, we primed both of the lines and the pump. still a no go, twice during the operation we got close with a little water flow but it stopped almost instantly. My buddy had just changed his foot valve down in the well. Is it anything to do with the pressure tank? I suspect a frozen/cracked line to the well."

44540,Dano,2007-03-08 03:16:00,719,"yup, you gotta fill both. God I hate those things."
44567,Bob,2007-03-08 11:14:00,370,"You need to have the suction line full (the one that goes into the well) and you need some water in the impellor, otherwise, it's just trying to pump air and won't work."
