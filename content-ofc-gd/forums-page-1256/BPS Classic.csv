43561,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-05 23:40:00,1351,i never got the flyer!! anyone care to scan a copy to me? please....
43563,urbanangler1990,2007-03-05 23:42:00,933,"yup , i already have some plans on the president spinning reel and maybe the browning aggressor combo..."
43576,douG,2007-03-05 23:56:00,2693,"Some great deals on spinnerbaits and stickbaits too.  Also a 99$ gps, worth taking a look at."
43594,BabyHerc,2007-03-06 00:36:00,285,"Urbanangler, the Aggressor Combo is not a good buy... TRUST ME.  Save your money."
43598,Rustic-Fisher,2007-03-06 00:46:00,826,What do you know???!!!!!! LOL.   Rustic-Fisher a.k.a Ryan (BPS GUY ALSO)
43618,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-06 01:30:00,4399, I bought the Browning Agressor combo a couple of years ago and it is in my opinion a darn good combo for the money.
43637,Clampet,2007-03-06 02:11:00,1947,"Cool Cat, Pat!"
43689,BabyHerc,2007-03-06 04:22:00,285,"Lookinforwalleye, you got a one-of-a-kind!  Play around with it in the store, Urban.  If you like it, by all means buy it.  Rusticfisher: What I don't know could fill a warehouse.  Ugly sticks in aisle 14, and 3/0 trebles for steelheading.  Don't forget the butcher knife."
43697,hogsmally,2007-03-06 04:46:00,21,"Went tot the SFC in my neck of the woods Yesterday.  Got enough deals to spend 150$.  I'll tell ya, some of the deals they have are hard to beat.  Got a 75$ reel for 45$, with the discounts they were offering.  Kevin, for a copy of the flyer go to basspro.com and look for the area where you select your ""home"" Bass Pro Shop.  If you select that, there are links to all of there sales brochures, including the classic, online.  Lumberjack"
43703,brookieman,2007-03-06 05:52:00,68,"Whatever you buy, pass on the Agressor Combo.  Absolute garbage.  i know cuz i worked there.  75 % of them come back with the same problem.  The copycat ""airbail"" that they didn't copy very well.  i wouldn't pay $ 20 bucks for that combo.  All the returns and they keep selling them?"
43719,misfish,2007-03-06 11:11:00,29133,"Yep I have to aggree, I bought that one for my son,the rod is ok the reel crap. Hey, some you win on and some you lose on. Trial and error."
43949,Markystang,2007-03-06 21:31:00,131,I can't find it on the website.... But I'm computer dumb...
43950,pikehunter,2007-03-06 21:35:00,1659,"I couldn't find it either.   The only one that I could get onto was for a store in NY State, U.S prices."
43953,urbanangler1990,2007-03-06 21:42:00,933,"hmm i may stay away from the agressor, i will test it out abit, ill just stick with the president, thnx for heads up"
43958,bpsbassman,2007-03-06 21:52:00,941,The flyer should be on the BPS web site Thursday (Friday at the latest)
43959,pikehunter,2007-03-06 21:54:00,1659,Thanx Roger.
43960,Markystang,2007-03-06 21:55:00,131,"Sweet. Thanks. BTW, how do I go about getting it mailed to my house??"
43965,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-06 22:03:00,1351,Thanks roger.
44018,bpsbassman,2007-03-06 23:46:00,941," Next time you're in the store, go to Customer Service (beside the fireplace) and ask to be put on the mailing list."
44061,walleyejigger,2007-03-07 01:02:00,876,"i don't want to see it, it'll just depress me,    soooo far away, especially at the price of gas right now"
44160,Blake,2007-03-07 04:57:00,418,Tough choices to be made but the reel program is a great idea.  With Shimano Canada participating it will be a great opportunity for the members to get that special Shimano reel that they have been looking at.
44326,mdej,2007-03-07 19:02:00,98,"This year if I buy what I want I will need to buy one of the 9.99 reels from the bin first to donate.  Last year traded in 2 reels, I got nothing left that I would part with.  Anyone know if LeBaron will have a tax free weekend with the BPS sale going on?"
44640,98Fahrenheit,2007-03-08 16:07:00,108,Here's the flyer for 2007:  http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catalog.CFP...UGHAN_CIRCULAR1
