April 17th was the first day out, wife and I headed to Simcoe, did well for Perch. Sometime between the 9th and the 17th I had the boat out for a good run up the Scugog River. (Might have been on the 9th. Not sure).   When do you usually do this?   Entropy   30 Days till she comes out !!"

The nice part is all it takes is some warmer temps, a bit of rain and wind and that can change in a matter of a few days.  Starting tomorrow that will begin to happen.   Our local Bluewater Anglers Salmon Derby runs from April 27 - May 6 with many fishing events taking place prior to those days, subject to weather and ice conditions.  So early April should bring a boat out of storage as far as I'm concerned or a least move it from the large garage to the one at home."
