44557,hogsmally,2007-03-08 05:55:00,21,"I never really put my boat away.  Around me there is always a river below a dam or great lake oriented fishing spot to go to. I just wait for winter warm ups.  I haven't been out in a month with the cold, but Great Lakes Brown and Rainbow Trout are on my mind with the coming warmer temps.   It is time.   Lumberjack"

44568,pikehunter,2007-03-08 11:15:00,1659,"Thinking the same thing Tinbanger, the Perch Festival. I/we have never been to Orillia for the festival as of up to just a few years ago we never had a boat, then for the past 4 years my son played rep basketball and every weekend was tied up going to tournaments. This year who knows? He has a part time job but at least my weekends will be open  ...well except maybe for work"

For anyone interested, I will be having my old stuff up for sale. The graph is a Hummin Bird Matrix and the Bow mount is a Minn Kota Power drive. Just don't ask me the models of these, they are still on the boat in heated storage."

44843,Ron,2007-03-09 02:21:00,1683,"OK everyone,  Thanks for your interest in my Fish finder and trolling motor, but as i said in my post, I do not know the model numbers, lbs thrust and shaft length.  All I do know, is that they are in good shape, I am only replacing them because that is what came on the boat.  The Fish finder is a Matrix model, gps ready, I have it hooked up to my Garmin and it is handy. The reason for replacement is I have a Lowrance on the console and want to run the same on the Bow.  The Minn Kota is just a touch too short for my liking, in fact I just bought a new foot control for it last Fall. I upgraded to a 75 lb thrust 24 volt with a built in transducer.  Both of these are only a couple of years old.  So please, don't send me anymore PM's until I get the info on them, thanks....."
44846,irishfield,2007-03-09 02:24:00,26272,Ron...go to bed..midnight comes early. LOL
