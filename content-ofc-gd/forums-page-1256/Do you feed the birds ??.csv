44444,Bernie,2007-03-07 23:47:00,3190,I can tell which of my customers feed the birds too.  Their car and truck air filter housings are full of bird seed. Seems its a good place for mice and chipmunks to store their seeds in.
44452,glirw,2007-03-08 00:11:00,200,"I don't currently feed the birds,  but I'm thinking of starting to feed the bees."
44456,Greencoachdog,2007-03-08 00:15:00,8163,"I also feed the birds, I really like to see the Gold Finches at the upsidedown feeder. They're one of the few birds that are comfortable feeding upsidedown and it keeps the other birds from emptying thier feeder.  Notice the upsidedown Gold Finch on the feeder just to the right of center?  I also get a good number of Bluebirds in the yard, they don't eat from the feeders... but I think they feel safety in numbers with the other birds around.  I also get alot of Eastern Meadow Larks too, they don't eat from the feeders either... but feel safer with other birds around. I really like thier bright yellow breasts with the burnt umber bib."
44527,bucktail,2007-03-08 02:52:00,1857,I feed them and have had a Mockingbird hang out all year. I fed them after I saw him hoping to help him make it thru the winter. They usually don't eat seeds but insects. He was there this morning so I think he is going to make it. Also I have a pair of cardinals that always nest in the back.
44411,GbayGiant,2007-03-07 22:39:00,1780,"I tried to get a pic the other day (didn't get the camera in time), there were more Blue Jays in one spot under the feeder on the ground picking the seeds than I've seen in my entire life, at least 50 maybe 100 all bunched up together it was a awesome site, they've been back but not all at once like that. A few woodpeckers and others too.  There is also a big fox that is interested, and close by.  It looked like a Crip gang meeting with all that blue   , anyone ever see that many Jays ?"
44415,Gerritt,2007-03-07 22:49:00,6129,I too feed the birds... Love to see the different ones and identify them using my Birds of Ontario books... Helps me pass the time... as for seed? well I go to the local Co-Op and Black Oil Seed (they look like black sunflower seeds just a little smaller) they have a really good nutritional count compared to other seeds and help add a bit of fat to the birds.. and it is alot more inexpensive then some of the seed you seen in warehouse/grocery stores. I havent seen a bird that is unable to eat them
