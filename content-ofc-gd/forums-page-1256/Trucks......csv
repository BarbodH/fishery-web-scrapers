Now, I am a believer. For all those that may complain about supporting domestics, do some research as to where they are built."

I just don't want to hurt any ones feelings. I love my GMC trucks. All trucks have there purpose. Every one has a fit. Some are for POSERS, others are for soccer moms, Chevy's are for those who don't wanna push 3000lbs of steel!  On a more serious note does anyone else here realize the price of the porsche cayanne turbo is 150,000 canadian now thats an expensive grocery cart."
44138,PatrickGG,2007-03-07 03:52:00,562,I own and love my 96 GMC Safari van and if i was to get something newer it would be a safari van. GMC And Chevy is my pick.
44218,Mike the Pike,2007-03-07 13:21:00,3421,  Gm no longer makes the Astro and Safari vans so you will have to buy a used one.
44221,tonyb,2007-03-07 13:50:00,1637,"Great thread indeed! as I am starting to do some research on different trucks as I plan on purchasing one in the near future.  This thread along with the rest of my reading has seriously pointed me towards the Toyota Tundra.  Honestly when compared, the Tundra has the most horsepower and torque in it's class, is cheaper than a Chevy, bigger than the Nissan Titan, and hauls/tows more than the Ford F-150...I'm sold!  It kicks some serious butt in the full size pick-up market.  On a side note, too bad the Honda Ridgeline isn't available in a V8!  Tony"

44331,aplumma,2007-03-07 19:13:00,6896,Tony B before you pull the trigger on the Tundra price it against the Titan their has been a 4-9 thousand dollar difference (US) between the two comparatively equipped. Toyota just got a hold of the numbers before they introduced the truck so they tuned the ECU for more horsepower and torque. I am not saying that the Tundra is not a nice truck I would have one along with my Titan if I could have two trucks. I have found that dollar per value the Titan is higher .....for now. I believe that the company that earns my money gets my business not the brand name on the grill.   Art
44384,Tybo,2007-03-07 21:42:00,1373,Heard a good one at work from a ford owner. Ford has to give you more leg room and a comfy seat. They want you to be comfortable when waiting for the tow truck.

44424,fishnsled,2007-03-07 23:12:00,3520,"Well here's my list.  1987 Nissan King Cab - Traded it in at 325,000km's  Should have done it at 300,000km's  ended up doing head gasket and the rear end after 310,000. Other wise a great truck.  1991 Chevy S10 - Only got 200,000 out of this truck but I contribute that to towing a bigger boat then I should.  The old 4.3L just didn't have the guts.  General maintenance and that was all.  It was in need of an engine in the end.  1998 GMC Serria extended cab 4x4 - 190,000km so far - TERRIBLE TRUCK!!!!!  Every 2-3 months I'm spending more money on repairs.  Brake assist drum (I think that is what is called),  Front Diff,  In-take gasket,  alternator,  switch assembly for the heating and air conditioning (unit had melted, could have caused a fire), Inside driver's door handle, Outside driver's door handle, (I've never had to replace a door handle on any vehicle)  I could go on but I won't.  These repairs are over a 90,000Km time frame.  My buddy has a brand new 2006 and is having nothing but problems with it.  Most likely the last Gm I'll ever own, but never say never.  GM for sure won't be my next truck, I need a break on my wallet.  Presently shopping around and from what I'm finding I'll either go with a Ford or the Toyota.  I was considering a Titan but found too many bad reviews on the web.  Maybe Nissan will sort out the problems for the 2008 model but it will be too late to get my money."
43777,wuchikubo,2007-03-06 14:19:00,1114,"I don't know how accurate the chart is but based on Mistyriver1's chart, Chrysler's Trucks have been on the rise. IMHO due to all the cross-overs that they keep making up in the truck section. GM's trucks were still the top picks. One thing to note from the chart, Toyota is the only company that saw positive growth in all three sections.  That should also tell someone in the Big 3 to wake up, but will they? I probably think not, plus too many Union barriers to improve the trucks any great deal.  IMO US trucks are for those who need heavier working trucks and will have to compromise with the fuel. The Japanese trucks are meant for the lighter duty uses and more daily commuting thus having better fuel economy.  I think I'll probably look at Japanese cars the next time around but if I were in the market for a truck, I'd probably shop around for a GM, if the fuel situation improves.  HearingFish"
43793,Fishnfiend,2007-03-06 15:32:00,357,"  Tony, I have one.  You saw it when we fished Bronte last fall.  I absolutely love it.  It kicks donkey off road, too. I expect to get about 500,000 kms out of it.  "
43864,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-06 18:34:00,835,"Dodge did a re design on thier trucks a few years ago, first change under the tin in something like 30 years so they may or not be a pos but they're not the same old pos that we remember..  Someone could make a fortune building simple utillity vehicles, 4 wheels, a motor and tranny, something to sit on with a box behind it, no computors  abs or all that other stuff, maybe call it a lorry cause trucks are gettingto be all fluff , no work and too much $."
43903,Zib,2007-03-06 19:47:00,369,I've owned 2 F-150's & loved them both. Never had major problems with them. Just the usual maintenance & replaced the brakes & a starter on one that was covered under warranty.

43934,irishfield,2007-03-06 21:03:00,26272,Darn near EVERY part in the automotive industry is from the lowest bidder..from seat belts to light bulbs so you can't base a vehicle on that. Trust me...and GM is the worst with their parts quoting requesitions for brow beating and price discounts in future years. Standard policy is to quote a price and then while material costs increase they want to see a 3 or 4% price reduction on piece price in the 2nd/3rd and 4th year if a continuation part. Their thoughts are you will have learned to streamline it's production and increase output volume per same cost..thus lowering the piece price. Reality is.... to meet said price reductions...quality suffers due to faster cycle times/assembly. Been there...done that..for 22 years! And by the way...Toyota has the same piece price structure on their request for quotes...

Thankfully Dano and mine's midnight run North on Friday am will be in the comfort of my F150 Super crew seats."
42840,Garyv,2007-03-04 02:23:00,547,"Let's ad some religion to the mix...I worship my Dodge hasn't failed me yet..in fact neither did my old 77 D100 or the 78  I bought my son years ago.  Now my Fords were decent trucks but not without  problems... My GMC 3/4 diesel van was probably the best vehicle I ever owned mechanically but the trim work was crap and my other GMC 1/2 tons were alright except for the new engine GM put in one of them after the 305 blew the rings in 2 cylinders.  So what I'm saying is simply there are good and bad in any North American truck made.  I can't speak for Toyota, Honda or Nissan but can say if I were looking for another truck Toyota and Nissan would be on my shopping list."
42888,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-04 05:33:00,835,I got an plain 86 F250 4x4 in 89 that finally rotted away in 05 so I replaced it with another one.  It took a while to find a low millage 86 F250 4x4 but I finally found one and this ones loaded with a cap Whoohoo. 9 more years and I can put a historic plate on it.
42577,irishfield,2007-03-03 15:16:00,26272,"Unfortunately Chrysler hasn't made a good vehicle since 1970 !   Back when.... Plymouth, for me anyhow, stood for ""Please Lay Your Money On The Hood"" when I ran Carling Ave in Ottawa and the Drags in Luskville Qc. I had no issues taking GM/Ford owners money for a 1/4 mile worth of gas to do it.  And Richard...with all them Accronyms you spouted.. GMC must stand for.... your Grand Mother's Chrylser...  TYBO LOL ! That explains it well !  I've had them all in the yard ('87 3500 GMC Cargo Van/2 Aerostars/3 Suburbans/3 Sierra k1500's- still using a '98 to plow snow/1 Durango/1 Dodge 1500 pickup at the plant) and like was already said...everyone builds lemons. Unfortunately the above area in brackets lists most of them lemons! Leah's Durango had less than 60k when all the ball joints were already shot. Motor pooched the intake gaskets at 61,000 and was burning antifreeze to suppliment gas mileage. Oil pressure was lost shortly afterwards when idling and I used that POS as a trade towards my 2003 F150 Super Crew with the little V8. Absolulely no issues going thru 65k other than a defectively mfg exhaust system that was noisy/rattling. Baffles fell out of the big can and it was replaced a month back N/C. That little V8 will pull anything my 350 power Sierra did.  Leah's driving a 2003 Sport Trac with the V6. The first one she bought had a bit of a lemon smell to it, with a leaky transmission, and what did the dealer do about it? Went and found another identically coloured/optioned truck, swapped all her licence documents and she started fresh again with a new truck after 5000km. She has 60k on it now and has had one brake caliper seize (probably from sitting all summer in the garage without use). Covered by warrantee and they did the other three wheels while they were at it.  My Father-in-law is like your neighbour Gerritt. Constantly says ""why the H did you guys buy Ford's"". ""You're not that broke are you""...and then I listen to him whine about all the issues with his Avalanche...and My sister in law whine about all the issues with her Trailblazer and the other sister inlaw whine about her Suburban.....  If that's what it takes to raise my property value...I'm not interested!"
42579,Tybo,2007-03-03 15:23:00,1373,Can't wait for GM to buy Chrysler. Cummings strap to a Allison. Can you say 4.5 sec 0-60.
