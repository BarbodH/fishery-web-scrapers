44329,gotfish,2007-03-07 19:11:00,53,I am heading up to a buds cottage on Jacks lake ( Apsly) this weekend and Just curious if anyone has been there lately and what advice you could offer. Got into some nice walleye last time I was there ice fishing but this time I was hoping to target the Crappie. Thanks AL
44333,Jigatollah,2007-03-07 19:21:00,53,Check the regs before fishing Jacks lake. The top section might already be closed for the ice season because it's also a sanctuary. The lower sections are open though.
44374,mepps,2007-03-07 21:29:00,1301,There are crappie in Redmond bay near the northeast corner (although I ahve never fished for them through the ice)
44377,Big Cliff,2007-03-07 21:32:00,6899,I think it might already be closed!
44602,gotfish,2007-03-08 14:05:00,53,Thanks for the heads up on the closures. The cottage that I will be at is in the southern portion.
