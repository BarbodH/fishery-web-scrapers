42630,urbanangler1990,2007-03-03 17:40:00,933,"hey guys i was looking through the BPS flyer this morning and noticed a a few good deals, how is the Browning Aggressor Combo, for 59.88, is this a good buy? also the President spinning reel for 39.99, looks like a nice reel, or the Abu Garcia Cardinal 100 spinning reel for 34.88, does anyone have any info or experience with these tools, TIA"
42647,silveradosheriff,2007-03-03 18:36:00,1025,Here is a good value combo. Berkely Lightning Rod from BPS for $18 Daiwa Crossfire -3i reel from LeB for $22  A nice back-up combo or to let friends use when you take them out.
42658,Canuck2fan,2007-03-03 19:15:00,1444,I have two of the Pflueger Presidents series and recommend them highly. Very smooth and fairly stout especially for 40 bucks.
42678,huntervasili,2007-03-03 20:20:00,1604,"I have another pflueger and like it and have used the President and they are smooth and I too would reccomend them. as for the brownings as mentioned in the past should stick to what they know, being firearms..."
42779,urbanangler1990,2007-03-03 23:58:00,933,"thnx guys, the president looks great, ill  consider the browning"
42846,PatrickGG,2007-03-04 02:39:00,562,"Have you guys come across the Daiwa Steez 103HL? i seen it at the spring fishing show and alls i gotta say is its the lightest baitcaster ""5.5 ounces"" i ever touched but its kinda heavy on the wallet. heres a link of the specs: http://www.tackletour.com/reviewdaiwasteez.html  This is something i wont be picking up anytime soon, i received the BPS spring sale flyer and and did a circle check on it for items i will be purchasing."
42853,FishFinder,2007-03-04 02:57:00,481,"Bought that for ice fishing, sweet reel for the price, even comes with two spools, but the drag aint the best."
42856,GbayGiant,2007-03-04 03:05:00,1780,"I had a president, lasted 1 season until all the bearings seized up, even after I took it apart and lubed everything it didn't come back to life same thing happened to another 10bb reel, so I tend to stick with no more than 6bb, they are smooth while they last."
44643,98Fahrenheit,2007-03-08 16:11:00,108,i'd go with the Shimano Stradic MgFA with a GLoomis Rod.
44646,Raf,2007-03-08 16:14:00,3495,What does that have to do with combos priced under $75??
44647,snag,2007-03-08 16:14:00,1932,Browning reels will only teach you how to dismantle a reel over and over for repairs.  I would only buy there rods
44648,98Fahrenheit,2007-03-08 16:17:00,108, Never mentioned anywhere for a price under $75.  Where do you see that?
44653,ryanheritage,2007-03-08 16:39:00,180,what kinda reel you want? spin?bait? and what your use? like species?
44662,urbanangler1990,2007-03-08 17:10:00,933,"  both lol, i smooth reel for finesse fishing for bass, pike, a baitcaster for tossing spoons, bigger spinner baits, i perfer a 5:1 speed"
44786,BabyHerc,2007-03-09 00:30:00,285,"Last year, the Aggressor was $99.  For $60, you might want to look into it.  Decent rod, and maybe they fixed the problems with the reel.  Cardinal 100 is nice, but small.  It wouldn't make a good bass, pike, or carp reel.  I still haven't seen the flyer, so I don't know what's on sale."
