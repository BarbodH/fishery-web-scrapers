44280,huey graphite,2007-03-07 17:30:00,362,Why not contact a local martial arts studio and see if they do performances. In particular they may offer self defence techniques for your female guests.  Just a thought!
44441,wuchikubo,2007-03-07 23:39:00,1114," Thanks everyone so far.  Hmm, I can just see it, ""we need a female volunteer and a male volunteer from the audience"".... Male volunteer ends up on his back on the floor after being beaten the .... out of him. That might go over well with the ladies and not so much with the men! LOL.  Mind you the lion dance thing might work as well or even a kata demostration. But would the mainly caucasian crowd think, ""see this is what we get when an asian guy sets up the event"".  Stan"
44453,fishergirl72,2007-03-08 00:11:00,455," LMFO!!!!! :lol  I won't tell anyone what I was thinking,LOL"

44537,Gerritt,2007-03-08 03:07:00,6129,ok I was going to wait....but I did a simple google search and came up with this...    http://www.corporateentertainers.ca/toront...m?source=google   there is a large genre to choose from and all do the Toronto area...  you should be able to find something there...   Gerritt.
44604,wuchikubo,2007-03-08 14:11:00,1114,"Thanks Gerritt,  I know of the site, I just wanted to know if anyone has seen or been at an event with a decent lunchtime show (yes, keep it clean! LOL), word of mouth tends to show better than the corporate marketing.  Thanks again, Stan"
44605,JerseyDog,2007-03-08 14:19:00,190,Check these guys out. I book them every year and they are a smash. They may be hard to book however.  http://www.fiddlestep.ca/

Conference for the Association of Hearing Instrument Practitioners of Ontario. My first choice was Japanese drummers but that has just fallen thru and now I need to find something for Friday April 27th!      (I've been looking in the range of $1K to $2K for 1/2 hr to 1hr performance, in Richmond Hill).  Now, I've seen many things on this board and know many people have many possible contacts here so that's why I'm looking for any help from anyone here.  Please, any suggestions!  Thanks, Stan"

43889,Davis Battah,2007-03-06 19:24:00,31,For $2000.00 for a half hour I'll dig some cardboard out and do a breakdancing routine for you.
43893,wuchikubo,2007-03-06 19:28:00,1114," Hey Wayne,  I just added it to the initial message but it's the not-for-profit association of hearing instrument practitioners of Ontario (AHIP).  BTW who's Mike?  Stan"

43911,douG,2007-03-06 20:13:00,2693,"Stan, a little research has shown that my suggestion was about 10 years out of date.  Not only was the place closed after some liquor license violation thingy, but I think the place was torn down.  Sic transit gloria.  And Charlene.  And Ember.  And Stormy."

43917,Corey,2007-03-06 20:21:00,355,I think a mime would be a perfect fit for an act like this...  cd.
43923,charlied,2007-03-06 20:33:00,584,wish I could have helped...my girl owns a gymnastics club and does presentations but that is the weekend they have provincial championships and all her girls are attending.  Too bad it wasn't another weekend.  Sorry bud
43936,wuchikubo,2007-03-06 21:06:00,1114,"Thanks everyone for everything so far.  Jen - great options (except the last one from the UK, I don't think they'd come over here just for an hour's performance). I have the feeling the Ontario part of Manchester came up under a search.  Thank you for helping me so far.  Corey - just like all other health professions, ours is getting older as well, not sure how the mime idea would work out.  Charlied- thanks for the thought, it gave me an idea. I might inquire at my old high school's performing arts program.  Thanks, Stan"

44227,wuchikubo,2007-03-07 14:01:00,1114,"Okay people, lets keep it clean! The attendance will be about 300 people and most (~60-70%)are women!  Cliff, ""real suggestions"" wasn't meant for you but the brass pole thingy.  You may be right about the genre of music though, considering most members were requesting songs from the late 70's and early 80's the last time around. Although there are lots of younger people entering the profession."
