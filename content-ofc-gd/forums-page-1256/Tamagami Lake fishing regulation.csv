44651,irishfield,2007-03-08 16:31:00,26272," Yes Al...as i stated in my PM a slot fish has to go back down the hole...dead or alive..hopefully alive. As do any beyond the one fish over 18.1"" you are allowed if fishing Division 18  Slot on Division 26 / Lake Temagami is 18.1"" to 24""  All the Lakes surrounding Lake Temagami are Division 18 and you can only keep one fish over 18.1"", out of your 2(con) or 4(sport) that you're allowed.
