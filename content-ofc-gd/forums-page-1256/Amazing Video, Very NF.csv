44681,John,2007-03-08 18:45:00,2956,I have see a real B29 fly. Don't remember the same maneuverability though. Quite the control!!!  http://users.skynet.be/fa926657/files/B29.wmv
44684,SlowPoke,2007-03-08 19:12:00,2984,That's outrageous! Who pulled off the stunts after the pilot bailed out? LOL -Brian
44708,Headhunter,2007-03-08 21:06:00,5703,"Very cool video. I wonder if a pilot of a real b29 would be inclined to do some of the stunts these guys did, like fly up-side down and inverted rolls! HH"
44714,lew,2007-03-08 21:46:00,12767,"Thanks John, that was incredible !!  WW11, South Pacific, Enola Gay & Chuck Yeager all rolled into miniature.....beautiful !!"
44739,Terry,2007-03-08 22:42:00,14456,"wow, forgot it wasn't a real  a few times.. if he lost control of it, it is so big it would sure do a lot of damage"
44828,Cast-Away,2007-03-09 01:59:00,790,"I can really appreciate that video. I've had an RC helicopter since December and believe me, radio control is very hard to master."
