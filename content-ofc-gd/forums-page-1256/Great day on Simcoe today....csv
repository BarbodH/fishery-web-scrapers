Got lots of whities...the limit and 5 more released....4 hooked but lost...  Got a nice laker 9 Lbs. tried for one more but kept getting whities no matter what dept I tried.... All in all....it was nice trip ...will try few more in the remaining week before season close.  All fish caught on Meegs in the presence of James himself ha ha. Thanks for the company James and his friends. Looking forward to that Algonquin trip in the summer Bud.  Here are few pictures....    And a picture of one of the whities released at the hole.    Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"
