It is hard to believe that you can sear a burger at 750 degrees and not burn it. The worst burger that I make on the BGE puts any restaurant burger to shame! Definately a great tool - I would suggest not buying here in Canada as it is less than 1/2 price (after conversion) in the US.  Trouble is you have to be able to pick it up or have a friend bring it up as it is 150lbs (shipping would be nasty).  SS."
