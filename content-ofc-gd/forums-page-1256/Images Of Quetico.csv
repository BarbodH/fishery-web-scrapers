44458,wuchikubo,2007-03-08 00:17:00,1114,"SoloP, awesome post, makes me think about what I could have done if I didn't have a young family. I'll have to wait a bit longer and maybe, just maybe my wife will consider roughing it (I don't think so though, raised as a city girl) for once.  Thanks for letting me dream.  Stan"
44470,solopaddler,2007-03-08 00:42:00,8605," Cool! I take it you're not married with kids?   I'd love to hear where and what you're doing in the bush for 3 months! As far as the rock goes, well we can't take credit for it.....it was just there and we used it  . Someone else with imagination built a fire pit around that rock many, many moons ago.  Thank's for the kind words everyone"
44487,irishfield,2007-03-08 01:06:00,26272,Thanks for taking the time to post that up Mike. Wonderful stuff...
44488,Whopper,2007-03-08 01:12:00,2174,Thanks for another fine report Mike.  Whopper
44495,Smokey,2007-03-08 01:26:00,1278,"Great photos again Solo. You have seen a great part of the country, keep the pics coming.  Mike"
44498,Mike the Pike,2007-03-08 01:32:00,3421,That was an awesome report Solopaddler I have always dreamed of a trip like that.Love the shot of the lost bet.I am trying to convince my buddies to take a canoe trip like that one.Its hard to convince 2 guys who have an 18ft and 24ft trailers and both can't leave there satelite TV at home.They are also worried about all the beer they would have to transport.I think I would do one trip like that before I get older but not with my 85lb fiberglass canoe a 3km portage would take me all day  .Great shots .That looks like Paradise.
44569,Rich Clemens,2007-03-08 11:16:00,3131,That IS a grea report Mike.  Sounds like a lot of envy here.  Would be great to have the time and just 'take off' somewhere to so remote place.  Thanks for sharing your trip  ... looks like a great time.
44573,ccmtcanada,2007-03-08 12:32:00,7971,Once again....awesome report!  I always feel like I'm right there with you on these trips.  The quality of the pics doesn't take away from it at all IMO.  Cant wait for your next one!
44582,Eddyk,2007-03-08 12:57:00,195,That sure is beautiful country. Thanks for sharing.
44590,Bly,2007-03-08 13:16:00,1556,"Thank you for the report.  Woke up this morning to flurries and cold and for a few moments while reading this, I was once again warm and young and on a  day canoe trip fishing with my big brother  Always enjoy your reports.   bly"
44596,crusty,2007-03-08 13:38:00,83,"Reminds me of a movie I've seen a couple times ""Squeal like a pig"" a Burt classic"
44601,cityfisher,2007-03-08 14:03:00,959,amazing !! one day i hope to tackle the north on a trip like that... working for the MAN really holds back on my dreams   BUT for now ill just read and watch your posts !
44620,1leggedangler,2007-03-08 15:14:00,364,"What a treat! Thanks Solo for sharing that trip. Good on your friend for not welching on the bet!lol  Cheers, 1leg"
44628,brookieman,2007-03-08 15:40:00,68,"Solo, i leave for Wabakimi last week if May.  Should be up there for at least 1  month.  Then it's either Woodland Caribou, or head south to the north shore area for some crown land bush whacking for 2 months or so.  Summers are short and i plan to take full advantage of the long days.  It's probably my last year being able to do so, so if figure why not.  Plenty of walleye, pike, brookies and lakers to be had.  We're just finished ordering all our maps so decisions will be made soon as to where exactly we'll be.  I was up in Wabakimi last year and it was honestly the best place i've ever tripped.  Nothing beats the Boreal forest!  If only the blackflies and skitters would cooperate."
44655,solopaddler,2007-03-08 16:43:00,8605,"  Good for you bud! Wabakimi is one of my favourite areas as well  Hope we get some good trip reports from you when you get back!  As it turns out I'll be up in that area in June myself....Going to take the train with our canoes and gear and get dropped off at a point just west of Armstrong to start our trip. Not a super long expedition, but nevertheless I'm looking forward to it immensly  cheers,  Mike"
44665,brookieman,2007-03-08 17:16:00,68,"What lake are you starting on?  I'll be flying into Kenoji!  Love that pre-glacial Ogoki river.  Awesome walleye and pike.  I've fished in a lot of remote areas, but Wabakimi in spring is about the best walleye fishing i've seen. Not the largest fish (although i did get a nice 7 pounder last year), but it's pretty easy.  You get hungry, paddle the canoe 100 feet, catch 3 walleye, come back and eat.  It's awesome!"
44670,solopaddler,2007-03-08 17:46:00,8605," Kenoji eh? Know it well! I paddled through there on my way up the Pallisade system....  We're going to start our trip at Onamakawash Lake (Shultz's Trail)...... You're right about the walleye fishing, it's incredible! One thing about Wabakimi...pretty much every lake of substance has an outpost camp on it. Not really all that big a deal, but depending on your route, take the time to bushwhack into some of the smaller lakes up there. There's plenty of lakes that really aren't part of any route per say, that are too small to land a plane on, and for all intents and purposes are completely untouched and unfished. Those are the true gems of Wabakimi IMO"
44387,tbayboy,2007-03-07 21:49:00,1497,"Awesome report Mike, our family use to spend time every summer on Pickeral lake but never ventured too much farther in.  Now that I've moved down south I kick myself for never taking advantage of that opportunity.  Maybe someday I'll get a chance to try again but until then I can just enjoy your photos."
44401,Garyv,2007-03-07 22:23:00,547,That looks like one GREAT time being had by all...with maybe one small exception!
44406,FinS,2007-03-07 22:31:00,463,awesome report solopaddler keep up the good work
