44315,SlowPoke,2007-03-07 18:47:00,2984,I heard a radio ad for BPS last night.... trade in your fishing reel and recieve a credit towards a new one. I don't know all the details but I think the reels go to a local charity. Can anyone shed some light on this? -Brian
44323,Guest mistyriver1,2007-03-07 18:57:00,0,"Hey Brian, the reels are provided to an organization (name escapes me) that helps kids that can't afford equipment to get into fishing.  You are correct, if you bring in a reel (that still works) they will give you a credit toward a new reel.  The more expensive the reel, the bigger the credit.  I don't have the flyer here at work but I sure someone can scan that page or give you details.  Are you heading up there this weekend ?  I was thinking of going Saturday myself."
44324,BabyHerc,2007-03-07 18:57:00,285,"You bring in any old reel, as long as it works, and you save a certain dollar value off the new reel you're gonna buy.  The amount you save depends on the cost of the new reel, not the value of the trade in.  The more expensive the new reel, the more money you save.  The savings is also calculated on the reel's current sale price; so let's say you plan to buy a Johnny Morris baitcaster: regular price $199, on sale for $99 - you'd save $15 off the $99 price, not $30 (even though it has an original price of $199).  You could also buy a cheep reel brand new (Zebco 33 comes to mind) for $10, trade it in, and save $100 off a Calcutta TE for example."
44330,SlowPoke,2007-03-07 19:12:00,2984," Nobody deserves a Zebco  Thanks for the info folks, that was a lot more helpful than the customer service lady over the phone! -Brian"
44332,SlowPoke,2007-03-07 19:21:00,2984," Yep, heading up friday afternoon and possibly stopping in at BPS and staying at my wife's uncles place on Simcoe. We'll be on the ice (sleds) saturday morning in the BBP area likely. I'll be wearing a giant red/black Helly with a black helmet with a stupid grin on my face. -Brian"
44358,Tdel,2007-03-07 20:41:00,393,I hope this helps you.      Tom
44429,fishnsled,2007-03-07 23:27:00,3520,Does anyone know if it is just for the weekend or for the entire sale event?  I'm planning on heading up one night next week.  Thanks.
44448,BabyHerc,2007-03-07 23:57:00,285,"For the entire event, Fishnsled."
44552,Blake,2007-03-08 05:16:00,418,Some great deals on Shimano reels for anyone in the market.  Go early for the best choice as last year some were sold out early.
44638,98Fahrenheit,2007-03-08 16:06:00,108,Here's the flyer for 2007:  http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catalog.CFP...UGHAN_CIRCULAR1
44675,Zib,2007-03-08 18:19:00,369,On another fishing board of mine (Lake St. Clair Network) someone had posted that you won't get a trade-in credit if you are buying a Shimano. BPS told the guy that Shimano is not participating in the program. This is in the US so don't know if that applies to Canada as well.
44690,fishnsled,2007-03-08 19:43:00,3520, Thanks for the info.
44691,bpsbassman,2007-03-08 19:46:00,941,Shimano Canada IS participating!!
