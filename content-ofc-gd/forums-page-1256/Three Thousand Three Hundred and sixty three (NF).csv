Just remember that no matter how much you want a puff, don't do it, or all the hard work you've done in the last couple days will be wasted.  I quit back in '91 after sucking that crap into me for 30 years and it was by far the smartest thing I ever did, and in another month you'll be saying the same thing.  Good luck Pal"

This is a direct result from sucking on the devils finger.  Perhaps to make things easier is to actually have a more tangible result to your success.  Put $10 (cost of a pack) into a jar relative to the amount you smoked per day, and that will keep you motivated.  All you have to do is embrace the jar when you crave ... and think of things you can do with that cash.  Something worth the sacrifice ... set your goal to something that makes you excited to look forward to and cash in.  You see, some people need a more immediate result, rather than a long term affect.  Hasn't worked for me yet, but I'm honoring that method almost more than helping out my health.  I have 3 months to quit ... then it's cottage season.  Too hard to stop then.  Keep up the great acheivement!  And stay proud."
44548,camillj,2007-03-08 03:56:00,1988,Thanks Guys ... yes ... it has now been over 5100 minutes (3 day 12 hrs 30 minutes to be exact ... the WANT is soooo definitely still there ... and I go outside every half hour or so and breath hard and do all the ritual things I would do if I was actually havin a butt .... read my email ... clear the snow off the deck ... come inside sorta fooled into believing its all better .. knowing that the nicotine would just have fooled me anyway so its not that far from the truth ...  Hard to explain ... but my approach for cold turkey was to take this 'mental' approach .... like ... it is gonna hurt ... like if you broke your leg (only you know that no matter how bad a craving is it will NOT hurt as much as breaking your leg ... (and you know after a few weeks the broken leg will heal .. maybe never perfectly .. but it will heal .... so you know you can get through it ....  ok its done ... (coulda/shoulda never started but I did ... 25 years ago ... and loved every minute of it .. knowing that sooner or later I'd have to tough it out .... not 100% sure that sooner is now .... but hey ... I am still at it ... one of the sites I read said it pretty well ... its not for forever ... just for today .... (until the addiction is weaker than me .... then maybe it will be forever)    Anyhow ... again the inability to concentrate is probably the most wierd sensation of all ... and I have caught myself a couple of time just reaching for the 'panic pack' in my pocket ... almost subconsciously ...    [edit] Wow ... thanks .. just spent an hour + at the whyquit.com site ... truth is I would NEVER EVER have even read it before .... but now it all seems so relevent ... uh oh ... this may be the real thing   And by the way .. the panic pack is no longer in my pocket .... crap now I'm gonna have to go clean out all my 'secret' stashes .....
