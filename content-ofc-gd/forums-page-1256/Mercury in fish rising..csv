44838,Greencoachdog,2007-03-09 02:14:00,8163,If the Mercury in the fish is rising... does that mean it's getting hotter?... must be all this Global Warming we keep hearing about!
44911,Mike the Pike,2007-03-09 04:50:00,3421,Two many Mercury outboards on the water.Time to switch to another brand guys to cut down on Mercury polution.  #1 on the water!.....LOL
44924,Roy,2007-03-09 05:31:00,13728,I saw on the news that wood fires are bad too. They cause lung cancer. At minus 20C and no wood fire in the house causes death...ummm difficult choice....
44927,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-09 05:39:00,1351,"well.. everything is bad for you.. coal.. nuclear... even the sun because of the solar radiation, possibly giving you skin cancer. there are so many contaminants out there, the human body was strong, but because of their evolution in trying to make everything sterile and clean, they have protected them so much that even the smallest amount of poison will hurt them."
44929,GbayGiant,2007-03-09 05:46:00,1780,"I ate around 3-5 cans of tuna a day when I use to body build, can't even look at it anymore. And the boybuilding days are over too, but it looks like I got a couple dozen walleyes in my gut.  Time to start eating that mercury again I think."
44936,Deano,2007-03-09 10:05:00,767,"Well we all got to die sometimes, at least I'll die happy (with a belly full of fish)."
44957,aplumma,2007-03-09 12:37:00,6896,If you catch a fish and stick the nose in the snow the cold will draw the mercury to the head which you cut off.....  yea OK I know it is bull**it but it is an old wives tale that got to be kept alive.   Art
