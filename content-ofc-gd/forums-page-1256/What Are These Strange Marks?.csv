645,Pinch,2006-11-16 22:02:00,231,I caught this fish in bon Echo Provincial Park at the end of August.  Does anybody know what the red marks on its side are?
653,vance,2006-11-16 22:13:00,719,Judging by the even and angled distance between the marks it could be a prop.my guess would be it got a little to close to an electric trolling motor that bruised the sides because it was running at a slow speed. I have seen a fish do this without any real damage to itself.  vance
660,setomonkey,2006-11-16 22:24:00,872,Does look like scrapes from an electric trolling motor. Seems too regular to be a result of another fish or a disease.  Mike
748,Pinch,2006-11-16 23:47:00,231,Thanks for the info.
757,DanTheMan,2006-11-16 23:56:00,257,"Ya, those are weird looking marks. I would think electrick motor also, but thats just a guess"
43641,Clampet,2007-03-06 02:14:00,1947,A hicky?
43648,DT10Sam,2007-03-06 02:31:00,480,"Heck of a birth mark........I agree does look like a trolling motor deal.  Regards, Sam"
43666,Greencoachdog,2007-03-06 03:08:00,8163,Fisteria?
43673,cisco,2007-03-06 03:31:00,597,Tatoos. Yep! Tatoos!!!  That hombre is obviously some kinda street gang member.  I go with the prop injury idea too!
43763,just2manylures,2007-03-06 13:25:00,144,"Trolling motor marks. I must be blind, I can't see the way a prop would do that.  I think somebody is going to need to do some photoshopping to help me out."
43782,Garyv,2007-03-06 14:41:00,547,If they are only on one side of the fish and due to tha angle of the marks I vote trolling motor prop at low speed.
43805,steverowbotham,2007-03-06 16:21:00,1800,could be lymphocystis
43861,Clampet,2007-03-06 18:28:00,1947,"Could be age spots, it is an old post!"
43871,Squid,2007-03-06 18:52:00,1656,Marks left behind after the fish healed from lymphocystis.
43884,solopaddler,2007-03-06 19:15:00,8605,"Definitely not lymphocystis, but I'm willing to bet it was not caused by a prop. Most likely a bacterial vibrio infection commonly referred to as ""red pest""."
44025,Rizzo,2007-03-07 00:01:00,4754,"I've seen that fish before, always looking for a good time.  My guess is syphillis."
44111,joonmoon,2007-03-07 02:51:00,528,How the hell should I know...hope ya washed yur hands afterwards though.
44316,jason27fish,2007-03-07 18:47:00,90,the little black spots are a parasite that is simple called black spot.. and those large black shaded areas are a disease known as lymphosarcoma its a cancer like disease that affects pike and musky
44320,OhioFisherman,2007-03-07 18:54:00,6623,Bruises from not lipping them?
44394,snag,2007-03-07 22:05:00,1932,Whip marks from a pike jockey
44437,grt1,2007-03-07 23:35:00,638,I thought they looked like fingerprint bruise marks from swinging that hammerhandle so tight.
44464,Pinch,2007-03-08 00:30:00,231," Wow, did you have some spare time on your hands today Clampet??  I didnt think that I would see this post resurface!!!  I think that the marks were on both sides,  I also think that the lake that i was on, Joe Perry in Bon Echo is a no motor zone!  not 100% on either count tho!!"
