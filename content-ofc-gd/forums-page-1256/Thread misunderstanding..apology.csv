44513,Roy,2007-03-08 02:18:00,13728,"Dang! I'm sorry this got so far out of hand. The request for the chat was just to get more folks in there. There were in fact a good bunch of us in there. I wasn't aware that there was an APB out on me till this morning and when I went to answer, one thing led to another and if it wasn't the server taking a break it was the rug rats NOT taking a break. Sorry if I caused concern, It really was not intentional. Thank you for your concern."
