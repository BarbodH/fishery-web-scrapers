44335,ssauvain,2007-03-07 19:31:00,77,Hello all I am going to fishing Birch Lake Northeast of Ear Falls on a fly in this summer. Solopaddler said the water is a stained tannin color....I assume this is a dark water...what are the colors of choice in these waters for Walleyes and Lake Trout and Northern. Appreciate any help and thanks again....
