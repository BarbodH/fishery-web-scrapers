44724,irishfield,2007-03-08 22:13:00,26272,"Freshly dumped deer carcus and associated parts this afternoon in the snow bank outside our gate.  Luckily I've kept Midhurst CO - Wayne Lintack's business card on my fridge ever since he visited me in my hangar way back in November of 2000 and his cell phone number is still valid. That let me skip the recorded tip line at least...and he even answered despite the fact he is off work 'till Tuesday. Passed it on immediately to CO on shift and I got photos before the animals get to it and foot print shots in the snow. One day we'll nail whom ever this is...I've been finding stuff like this almost yearly, including deer hung to bled out in the woods, since buying this property in 1992.  "
44727,lew,2007-03-08 22:20:00,12767,Hope they track him down Wayne
44728,huntervasili,2007-03-08 22:20:00,1604,Hope that you find him and dig up all the decomposing junk hes left and leave it in his car and house while hes locked up  unbeleivable how uneducated and ignorant people are...
44735,GbayGiant,2007-03-08 22:25:00,1780,"Thanks Wayne, I was just eating dinner.  What an idiot, hope they find him/them."
44740,Grimace,2007-03-08 22:48:00,2020,Poachers should be eaten
44754,Bernie,2007-03-08 23:32:00,3190,Years ago around up here the odd deer was taken by a hungry family out of season. No one complained. But this day and age there is absolutely no excuse for this.
44784,Garyv,2007-03-09 00:21:00,547,Who ever did that is a charter member of the BIA club....
44799,Rob,2007-03-09 01:00:00,467,Do you think maybe someone trying to taunt you Wayne? That fool needs to be treated the same way (hung out to Bl33d)  Hope they nail him soon.   Rob C
44808,Terry,2007-03-09 01:21:00,14456,not nice at all....string them up
44820,brandon,2007-03-09 01:44:00,857,I think the MNR should invest in a whole batch of Trail Cameras to place in areas where there are high violation rates.  It might not have a great success rate but some eyes are better than no eyes.
44823,Crazyhook,2007-03-09 01:47:00,1154,looks like the deer was taken out with a machine gun FFS!
44824,mattyk,2007-03-09 01:48:00,2110,i cant stand poachers. Hope they get em.
44858,Mike the Pike,2007-03-09 02:49:00,3421,Wayne you can buy hunting cameras that can take snap shots from trees and you don't have to be there.That would be a way of nabbing them.
44864,fishindevil,2007-03-09 03:02:00,6254,well maybe some of your neighbours seen the car or truck wayne i hope they ask stuff like that....hope they get whoever did this.....
44871,outdoorguy61,2007-03-09 03:13:00,220,"By chance do you think your property is one that has been used for convenience, adjacent to a deer yard, or could this same person be one that does not like you or someone in your family? Hopefully they will be caught.  outdoorguy61"
44874,codered,2007-03-09 03:14:00,123,WoW  that is disturbing  ..how many deer are in that pic  looks like more than  one..I hope  that they are cought and delt with  in the appropriate manner..its such a shame to see the pure ignorance of some  s.o.b   arn't most deer this time of the year pregnant?....
44883,Bernie,2007-03-09 03:20:00,3190,  Well the female ones anyway
44910,majorlifts,2007-03-09 04:50:00,171,"It almost looks as though a wild animal got hold of it. Could there be a wolf in your area or something? There have been cougers sighted everywhere, could it be that?  It just seems strange that they would leave behind the skins and so much meat."
44921,mrdylan,2007-03-09 05:18:00,111, Site is pretty clean. There would be more blood around if it was an animal attack.  Also there are tracks behind it I would bet there are foot prints from a human.
44930,Cookslav,2007-03-09 05:48:00,1457,"Jerks... Makes me angry as well. I hope they nail them.  Ya...little to neat and tidey for an animal kill. Looks to be ""piled"" up a bit?"
44938,Castmaster,2007-03-09 10:28:00,86,Maybe Bigfoot did it?
44940,Big Cliff,2007-03-09 10:36:00,6899,"You really have to wonder why someone would take the chance to; kill a dear out of season, (like nipissing said, years ago if your family was hungry, no one worried about seasons) and then dump the carcus where it is likely to be found."
