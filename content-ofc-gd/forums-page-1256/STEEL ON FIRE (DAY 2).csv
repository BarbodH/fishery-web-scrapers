44783,tjsa,2007-03-09 00:20:00,1578,"I think about this time last year..........I mentioned something along the lines of:  I HATE YOU!!  I still have a month at least for the opportunity, if we have any runoff to speak of. If we don't, I will probably not even bother them, I will just let them be.  Ahh........I digress, great stuff Scott, thanks for posting that."
