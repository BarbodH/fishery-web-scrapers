486042,Fisherpete,2010-07-17 13:26:00,1814,"The ones I use are made by Scotty, work with both spinning and baitcasters... $25 each or so. Seen them at Canadian Tire, Bass Pro, LeBaron... great for trolling, and I use them for still fishing too (cats, carp)  http://image.basspro.com/images/images2/64000/64316-t.jpg"
