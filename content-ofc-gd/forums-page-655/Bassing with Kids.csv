The fishing was pretty good too…  Cadence caught his first bass ever. He hooked and brought in the fish all on his own…   Big Cousin Robyn got the jigging technique into science…   Sheldon tries to make this little bass look bigger…   Cadence told me sunfish swim in circles when they get hooked…hmmm….   This looks like fun too…   I have a moss boss that looks like this guy…   Hopefully the weather remain nice, we got to do this again. Thanks for reading."
