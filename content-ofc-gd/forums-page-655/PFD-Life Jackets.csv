Am I able to use them in Canadian waters? Or do I need ones approved my Canadian Coast Guard? I have some of both, but just want to know if I should give them away to some family members in the USA or keep them on my boat.  Thanks!"

A US resident who does not keep their boat in Canada can use the US Coast Guard approved life jackets while visiting Canada provided that they are not here over a certain time period.  I think it is around 40 days, if they stay longer than that then they need to meet all Canadian safety regulations."
