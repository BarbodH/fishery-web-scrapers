486919,HTHM,2010-07-20 22:02:00,4082,"Actually i would say he needs seven more now, foster or not, step or not, a child is still someone to be cared for. I am sure you feel the same way. That makes it even more special, because you have choosen to care for this child, or your daughter has. We have a ""blended"" family as well, it is a lot of fun."
