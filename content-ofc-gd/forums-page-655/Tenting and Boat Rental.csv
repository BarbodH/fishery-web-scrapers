486908,anglers2be11,2010-07-20 21:48:00,21,"Hello Guys,  I am looking for a place to go fishing for a night or two. More specifically, a place where I am able to camp (with a tent) that has boat rentals available. I have been looking over the internet with no luck.  I am willing to travel up to 2 hours away (in any direction) from Toronto.  Thank you!"

486978,NAW,2010-07-21 00:40:00,4022,"  I think this would be a crappy spot to camp..  Pretty hard core trailer part there, if ya know what I mean.  And the rental boats are junky, heavy pontoon boats..  I fished there last weekend.  Lots of small pike and LMB"

487132,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-21 14:00:00,947,Also Bass Lake Provincial Park has boat rentals
487135,Syn,2010-07-21 14:04:00,519, I rented from there 2 weeks ago. Boat was $100 total until 8pm. We had the option of renting it until next day morning for another $35. Was told people camp over night and fish next day early morning. I was recently debating buying portable boat lights for $100 to make the boat night usable although I heard there are no muskie at 6 mile. But dusk and early morning fishing is defiantly cool. When I was at 6mile the bite started picking up at 7:30pm when we were bringing the boat back. LMB and pike were getting really active biting aggressively within 10-15 ft from the boat.
