486680,cpguy29,2010-07-20 02:24:00,148,"Just got in from an evening fish. Got on the lake around 7 and started looking for some new water to troll. Not even 10 minutes into the run my rod doubles over. I put the boat in neutral and turn around to see a huge beast leaping out of the water. Got her in the net, unhooked her and set up the self timer on the camera for a quick pic then back in the water she went. 40"" and the thickest muskie I've caught this year.   "

487016,Cudz,2010-07-21 01:55:00,2652,nice fish!  I need to catch something like that. Be careful of that fog rolling in.  Looks pretty thick.
487069,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-21 04:35:00,2585,"im not a musky fishermen myself, but its kind of easy to tell the kawartha girls from other waters.  Long and skinny in the kawarthas eh?  Nice fish though!  watch out for the giant wave coming at you!  Cheers!"
487103,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-21 12:43:00,0," Well I bent it once. Tried again unsuccesfully, so will not force it. Still hurts but the pain is now very manageable as long as I dont move it. The doc said it will be good in 3 days. Its been 6 and still no go but it is getting better. Slowly but surely. The doc said to remove the stitches on Thursday but I will wait for Monday. It has not healed satisfactory in my opinion."
487287,houski,2010-07-21 22:25:00,61,"Looks like a Scugog fish to me. They tend to be a bit lighter, and spottier than other Kawartha fish."
