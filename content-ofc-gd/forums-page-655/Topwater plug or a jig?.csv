487137,Dave Bailey,2010-07-21 14:10:00,1641,How would you go for this beast?! Looks like a tarpon on steroids with attitude.
487140,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-21 14:15:00,0,I say a medium size rat on a jig will get this beast
487154,alexcba,2010-07-21 14:51:00,634,6 meters huh? id call fisherpete and let him have a go at it with one of his secret lures. either that or put a crank bait lip on a stick of dynamite and when it strikes squeeze the detonator lol.

487168,uglyfish,2010-07-21 15:18:00,981,it looks like a pissed off striper! lol  but at 6 meters long... u might wanna up size ur bait to somethin a bit bigger then a medium sized rat... maybe a medium to larger sized dog would work...
