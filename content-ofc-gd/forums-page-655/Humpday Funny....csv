487119,John,2010-07-21 13:32:00,2956,"When John and Mary first got married John said, ""I am a sex addict and I'm putting a box under the bed to help control my addiction. You must promise to never, ever look in it.""  In all their 30 years of marriage Mary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents.  That evening they were out for a special Anniversary dinner. After dinner Mary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, ""I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?"" John thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again."" Mary was shocked, but said, ""Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I am very disappointed and saddened by your behavior. However since you are addicted to sex, I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.""  John thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace.  A little while later Mary asked John, so why do you have all that money in the box?  John answered; ""Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the Beer Store and cashed them in."""
