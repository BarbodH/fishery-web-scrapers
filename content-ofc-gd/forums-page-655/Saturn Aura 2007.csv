486968,Big Cliff,2010-07-21 00:13:00,6899,"OK, I need help. A friend just got a 2007 Saturn Aura, fully loaded. Where to heck is the parking brake release? I looked down bt the parking brake pedal, all I can see is the hood release, anyone know for sure where the parking brake release is?"
486970,alexcba,2010-07-21 00:19:00,634,try pressing on the pedal harder to release?some parking brakes pressure release.
486971,danbouck,2010-07-21 00:23:00,4380,"Yep, the Infiniti is the same. Press in and it releases"
486973,Big Cliff,2010-07-21 00:25:00,6899,Are you SURE? if I put the parking brake on and can't release it I am going to have one very un happy friend!!!
486974,alexcba,2010-07-21 00:37:00,634,"only 3 places for parking brake releases cliff.  1. central engage/release 2. driver side floor pedal/hand pull release 3. driver side floor pedal engage/pressure release  sometimes the pedal will say ""press to release"" if your totally unsure check the owners manual. im pretty sure its pressure release."
486981,Big Cliff,2010-07-21 00:49:00,6899," Thanks, If I had the owners manual here I wouldn't be bothering you guys LOL!  I'm going to give the pedal a try if it doesn't work I'll be"
486982,alexcba,2010-07-21 00:52:00,634,lol if it sticks i'll take the shot for ya cliff.
486994,Big Cliff,2010-07-21 01:17:00,6899," Well, get ready to take one LOL. Turns out you have to step on and hold the brake pedal then push down on the parking brake pedal and release it! Don't even ask me how I figured that one out, it's funny what desperation will do for you!!!!  Anyway thanks for trying!"
