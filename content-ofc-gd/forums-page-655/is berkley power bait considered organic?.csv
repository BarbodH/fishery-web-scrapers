486774,hurraylien,2010-07-20 14:39:00,95,"just wondering if the pink bubblegum trout worms are considered organic for the special reg zones of the grand,credit etc?"
486782,bigbuck,2010-07-20 15:10:00,2449,"Organic, NO, they are made of plastic. The GULP however is Biodegradable, (I think it is made out of cornstarch of all things)."
486814,Tybo,2010-07-20 16:28:00,1373,"If there made from corn starch. Wouldn't that make them Organic, Since corn starch is made from corm?"
486819,Grimace,2010-07-20 16:43:00,2020,I think what they mean by organic is roe.   Not sure though.  Call the grand river troutfitters they will tell you.
486845,I'mHooked,2010-07-20 18:20:00,525,"Don't confuse 'organic' with 'biodegradeable'.  While 3rd generation 'plastic' baits such as Gulp! Alive are biodegradeable, along with a few other brands, it doesn't mean they are organic.  They can still contain synthetics like PVC & PVA, which may disolve, but can still allow potentially toxic chemical byproducts to linger.  An 'organic' bait would not include these synthetics.
