Grabbed the backback and ran to a wee little hotspot tucked away from most along L Gibson. Took a bit to find what needed to be on the menu for dinner, but found they all wanted tubes. Today's sampling.    And today's monster...  No pigs but a steady lite bite and short strikes, plus a few WGSF's to keep it interesting. All released for another day. Caught just enough though to maintain my sanity for a few more days."
