487019,Cudz,2010-07-21 01:57:00,2652,"Dude, you have been catching sick Musky so I wouldn't put my musky stuff away until they shut down.  A 5 lb bass is nice but a 45+"" ski is  insane."
487023,alexcba,2010-07-21 02:20:00,634,"lol pete dont do it man! wait until the bite dies down, if it does die down for you.. or if the kid catches a 50 before you, then go ahead and take up bassing for a bit.. but dont take him with you cause if he catches a nickle before you, your gonna start running out of fish LOL!"
487027,spinnerbaitking,2010-07-21 02:33:00,1622,"Great Report & I couldn't care where your arms are those bass look great, I 'm off somewhere tomorrow & some were else Thursday hopefully Richard"
487051,Fishing 24/7,2010-07-21 03:32:00,709,  the nickel was posted on another report paul!    a big    to all the great replies guys!   now go get some BUCKETS for me please!
487063,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-21 04:09:00,2585,I hope its ok im living vicariously through you this year!  I have not been fishing yet other then a small creek with my son.  I am sooooo jealous!  Damn!  Cheers!
486581,Fishing 24/7,2010-07-19 20:59:00,709,"After work fishing always was some of the best DARN fishing i had....   Still doing it this year.... and it still producing BIG TIME!    First you place the rods in a perfect order.    Then you find an erea were the bass are feeding.....  sometimes the electric motor dosent like the ereas tho!    started slow......  BUT.  I WONT GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT!    This 4 + was sitting around an island .  hit the flip/pitch technique.  on a YUM Wolly HawgTail. set up on a title shot jig head.  my partner scoring a PIG on a Dinger.    Yep he is learning quick this kid.    fishing the slop is becoming one of his favourites    Smallies , lariges.... there swimming together.  As the sun was setting. the bass were rising from the deep and sticking around the rocks.   islands and rocky shore line was a MUST for these BRUTES.    Then the smallies  schooled up on us.      The next day.  i switch lakes.....  a wise decision..... NO  The day was slow..... 1-2 lbs bass were the size....  BUT........  As the wind started to pick up.... i hit a triangle head shore line...  and there was the beast... feeding in the dirty water.  i throw a black buzzbait.... and he fell for it!      This was a 4.2 lbs largie and was the biggest of the day.  The bass are shallow this year.  good luck guys!"
486585,alexcba,2010-07-19 21:04:00,634,great lookin fish.. what up with the recent rash of people holding the fish so close to the camera making it look ginormous? regardless looks like good times.
486586,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-19 21:09:00,2050,"my god you make me want to delete my most recent largie thread! haha I miss those northern ontario/quebec lakes... your lakes and reports remind me of the water I grew up fishing...  thanks for the report dude! Always enjoy the read and the pix  cheers, Ryan"
486587,glen,2010-07-19 21:22:00,2641,yep you the master.
486588,Terry,2010-07-19 21:25:00,14456,some mighty fine fish there
486590,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-19 21:30:00,0,Another great bass report! Those are some nice set ups you have too!
486592,Whitespinnerbait,2010-07-19 21:36:00,2038,  Check out any one of the Pros website ....they all hold them out far from their bodies also
486593,alexcba,2010-07-19 21:38:00,634,lol its a great illusion.
486638,darsky,2010-07-20 00:25:00,586, Personally-I like the pics the way they are.
486640,bare foot wader,2010-07-20 00:30:00,1354," dont' like the pics don't look at them...  personally when I catch a solid fish I want a quality photo and maximize the details of the fish...nothing wrong with those pics, no diff than any magazine on the shelves these days...  how is that an illusion? explain?.....he's not exaggerating the size at all, quality pics in my books....holding a 12 inch bass close to the cam and calling it a 4lb'er is an illusion, not these pics  keep the pics coming"
486647,Fishing 24/7,2010-07-20 00:51:00,709,"  you guys are the BEST!  standing up for the quality pictures!  up close in your face is the way to go man.  what do you want ???  more sky , clouds and water?  and a small guy way in the back holding the same fish.  you dont even know whats up.  how he caught it with what lure what the fish looks like .  CMON!"
486656,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-20 01:00:00,932,"There are three kinds of bass - Largemouth, Smallmouth, and Hogs . . . today my friend, you caught the hogs.  Very well done, thanks a lot for sharing - an amazing report."
486714,Fishing 24/7,2010-07-20 10:56:00,709,  your repply should be in the bible of bass!  thank for the kind words folks!
486716,Billy Bob,2010-07-20 11:07:00,5865, I agree....It's not fair...I have short arms so all my fish look small...
486728,Cudz,2010-07-20 11:54:00,2652,If you hold them back beside you it looks stupid.  I usually weigh my big fish and I know exactly how big they are. If you want to know I will tell you.
486792,alexcba,2010-07-20 15:33:00,634," woah, calm down there sparky! i said nothing about the pics being bad. i merely asked why alot of people take pics like this. i was not insulting anyone, nor was i insulting his report. maybe you should go have a drink and read my post again.  again i'll say nice report."
486796,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-20 15:44:00,2690,"Photo arguments aside, some really nice bass...well done!!"
486825,bare foot wader,2010-07-20 17:23:00,1354,alexcba - sure thing buddy....i wasn't attacking ya...just asking why ya thought it was an illusion? it gets a bit annoying when everybody is a suddenly a photo critic online....if you can chirp you should be able to take it back....
486826,alexcba,2010-07-20 17:37:00,634,well than i chose to take back lol. glad we cleared that up. cheers.
486828,g_clot,2010-07-20 17:39:00,104,"24/7 - I don't think I could concentrate at work knowing what's coming when I get off.  Hell, I can't even concentrate after just looking at pictures from some dude I don't know who is hours away from me.  A great lifestyle you gents are living.  Keep on enjoying the best of the good times (and loop us in every now and then )!!!!"
486940,Cudz,2010-07-20 22:38:00,2652,"By the way Kevin,nice fish. 24/7 catches great fish all year.  He takes awesome pics and he is legit obout their sizes.  If you look at his arms or my arms or anyone else who ""holds their fish out"" to the camera, you will always see a bend in the arm.  No one is making a 12 incher look like a 4 pounder. I also think that we see a big mouth on a largie and we overestimate its weight.  It doesn't really matter how big it was, those are still quality fish! whatever."
486966,Leecher,2010-07-21 00:03:00,7832,You seemed to have them bass dialed in Kev Great season you're having so far and some nice hogs Great job and thanks for sharing!!! Jacques
486975,Whitespinnerbait,2010-07-21 00:37:00,2038,Whats kind of Ironic is he caught a   FIVE POUND SIX OUNCE Largemouth last week ..and didn't post it on this Thread .
486976,spincast,2010-07-21 00:37:00,3279,"awesome outing, beauty fish - keep those (long arm) photo's comin!. All of a sudden I am finding a reason to agree with my wife that a trip to the ottawa region next year might be a good idea"
487005,Fisherpete,2010-07-21 01:33:00,1814,Basstastic report! I haven't had a great bass day like that yet this year... and am still aiming for my first nickel (stuck at 4.7) Hmmm... maybe the muskie stuff should get put down for a minute... tempting!!!
