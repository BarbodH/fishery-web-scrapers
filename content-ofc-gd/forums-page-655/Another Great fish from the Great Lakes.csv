486429,solopaddler,2010-07-19 12:10:00,8605,"Better make sure they get it exactly right. On paper it's only 1/2 an ounce heavier than the brown caught last September in the Manistee river. Seems lake Michigan currently has a strong year class of monster browns, wow!"
486433,bucktail,2010-07-19 12:20:00,1857,"Awesome, wish we still had some freakish browns in Lake O , I think we need to get ahold of that strain and get them in Lake O. in the ""old"" days browns in the mid 30""s used to come out of lake O.   "
