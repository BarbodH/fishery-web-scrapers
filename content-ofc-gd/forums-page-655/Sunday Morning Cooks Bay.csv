486343,LefroyFisherman,2010-07-19 00:23:00,602,"Hasn't been too bad, few pike here and there and quite a few bass. Have you been fishing further north? how's that been?"
486345,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-19 00:31:00,0,Some nice pike you caught there. I see the pike fishing is still thriving on cooks. Lots of bass you say? I assume Largies? Time to head there with the jig and pig! Thanks for sharing.
