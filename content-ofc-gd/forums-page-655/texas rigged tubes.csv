486897,ColdH20guy,2010-07-20 21:36:00,312,Hi everyone Just curious what kind of hooks you guys use for weighted t-rigged tubes? I know there are weighted tube hooks (which I have ) that have the weight right on the hook but am looking for something when texas rigging..I found myself adding a small split shot right above the hook on the line but must be a different option..  thanks guys/gals

486953,bdox,2010-07-20 23:11:00,329,"If I'm pitching to slop, I will peg a heavy tungsten flipping weight, open water or wood/brush I use Owner Phantom weighted EWG tube hook. If you find yourself at BPS pick some of these up.  http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Owner_Phantom_Weighted_Tube_Hooks/descpage-OWTH.html"

487160,Harrison,2010-07-21 15:03:00,2202,"Just another option is a Bell sinker.  Insert it in the tube pushing the point through the eye of the weight when rigging.  I usually peg a worm weight(1oz - 2oz) with a tooth pick when pitching through slop or a thick weedbed.  Lil tid bit - when texas or texposing a tube, insert a glass rattle after rigging the weight and stuff a piece of sponge into the tube then finish rigging it.  Soak the sponge with scent and the hook will hold everything in place.  good luck  edit- sorry just saw singingdog mentioned the egg sinker already."
