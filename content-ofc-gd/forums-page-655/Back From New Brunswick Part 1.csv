Did manage to bring back a couple lobsters, pickerel, couple brookies and some eel. I didn't find the eel tasted like scallops but it wasn't bad. Finally got one myself this year and a good size too-22""-1 lb. After I caught it I had it laying on the wharf for a few minutes then when I went to throw it on the chain there were 2 big leeches crawling out of it's mouth.  We used them for bait but didn't catch anything. Caught some interesting looking bullheads, looked like a cow.  Never seen any like that before. Seen the black ones there before. So what we caught there were bullheads, yellow and white perch, pickerel, sunfish and eels. Went out with a friend one day and he landed a huge brookie. I had to go up around the bank due to a deep spot and he yells over. He said it got off the hook and went between his legs. He doesn't know how he managed to hold on to it. He didn't weigh it but it was twenty-some inches long and a sea-run. The culvert across from my brother's was loaded with brookies. Water was low so they couldn't get out. Must've been 50 in there, some decent ones too. Couldn't really get in there without spooking them. Only managed to get a small one. Saw lots of foxes this year and a few deer. One day I headed out to St. Martins and looked for brookie spots along the way. I tried going thru this one road that rough and rocky. Couldn't get thru all the way so had to turn around but did scrape bottom a couple times. I drove a few hours and went thru the Fundy Parkway and on the way back noticed the car didn't have much power going up the hill. Pulled over right away and had NO oil on the dipstick at all. Put a fair amount of oil in and still nothing. Didn't see any leak anywhere so I couldn't figure it out. Went to my sisters and filled it with oil. Went in the next day to get it looked at and there was a big dent in the oil filter. Did you hit something the man said. Oh yeah. He said there's your leak. Was soooo close to seizing the engine. Had a horseshoe up you know what that day. Hit the Parkway at 6pm and they closed at 8 so I had to rush thru. No time to check out the walking trails. Definately have to next year. Never hit Fundy Park either. Never to seem to get all the stuff done I want to. I need a month off for everything. Took some pics at my brother's of all the animals they had. Figured I'd add them. Passed an accident on the way back. So not much fishing but definately an interesting trip this year. I have to put the rest of the pics on another post. I maxed out.                                                  "

I'll be heading back to NB for a family vacation at the end of August. The brookie fishing gets even better later in the year! The pickerel fishing is excellent early in the summer in the bigger lakes. My kids just got back from a fishing trip in NB with my Dad and they did really well. My 12 year old got one 24' monster pickerel. We are speaking of true pickerel not the Ontario slang for Walleye."

I landed my first Atlantic Salmon there in 1966- an 8lber and was thrilled beyond compare.  Fundy Park and its golf course was spot enjoyed many times.  I returned to NB, last weekend for a 50th High School Reunion and travelled down from Moncton to Saint John and marvelled at the scenic beauty of the Kennebacasis River Valley as seen from the highway.  Nice report and great pix - Thanks for the memories"
