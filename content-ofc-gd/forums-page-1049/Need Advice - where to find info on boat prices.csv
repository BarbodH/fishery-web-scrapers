188895,Dutch,2008-04-18 01:01:00,831,"Hey looking at potentially picking up a new/used boat.  I currently have an 18' Springbok with a 150HP Evinrude, looking for something smaller HP wise.  I like the 18' (could go 17, but not too much smaller), but would prefer something with a 90-115HP motor.  Aluminum is more my style than glass, something like a prinecraft hull, not a deep-v, more of a low angle of entry like a glass boat, single or double console, but not full windshield.  Going anything more than 50MPH in a boat is scary to me....somewhere between 40 and 50 at WOT would be ideal.  Boat will be used for fishing almost exclusively.  Price range up to maybe $15K or so, but lesser is better.  Keeping my eye on:  Boat trader BFB Classifieds here Kijiji  Need info on:  If I see a boat I like - how can I tell it's a fair price?  Often, there's nothing else similar listed or the same model, especially with used boats.  Is there a book somewhere that gives prices?  Is this book on-line for free?  I would go to the states to buy for the right price.  What are some good US sites advertising used boats?  I found a bunch of independant marinas with a couple of boats here and there, but do they have anything like the Boat Trader?  I am leary of E-bay, not sure I would buy something and test it out after the fact.  Thanks for the feedback."

Might find something there at a fair price? Walleyecentral.com  Also... it would not hurt to PM Bernie  His sales guy Larry is tops! great guy and honest.
