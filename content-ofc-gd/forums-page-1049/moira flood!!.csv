189407,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-19 01:52:00,314,Not my website guys.......  its one i belong to for offroading............and thanks to all my friends on there i still have a dry house!!
189410,fatherof3,2008-04-19 02:01:00,1769,good to hear your house is ok.
189411,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-19 02:03:00,314,all the great people from that website saved my house and 5 others!!!  The world needs more people like them!!!
185107,Sinker,2008-04-10 23:23:00,8692,"Your municipality would like to hear from you if your at risk of flooding. If nobody says anything, they won't do anything.  Are there others in your area that are in the same situation as you are? If they're holding back water to do work on a dam, I'd be asking lots of questions. This is the wrong time of year to be working on dams!!! Unless of course it was damaged by high flows. There's gonna be some big problems this weekend with flooding.  I feel for ya man, its gotta suck watching that water rise like that!! And your right, there isn't a thing you can do, even pumping won't help you.....if the water reaches the right elevation, your flooded............... all you can do is move your things and try to keep them on higher ground.  Sinker"
185126,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-10 23:48:00,314,Well its still moving up .........has slowed today but i fear the rain may cause a issue.  were going to move the stuff we would be upset to lose tommorow night............the rest the insurance company can fight with the egg heads that are behind the control of the dams.  several people on my road may flood or may already have.....  moved all the stuff around in the garage tonight incase it fills up tommorow...........The rain is suppose to start tonight.......  i had a nice flood a few years back when the power outage happen...........  so most stuff is already at high ground or in garbage from that.  i should have called insurance on that one...........but im such a pay my own way guy sometimes.............stupid i guess  This i will call.........  not sure what kinda damage will happen if water reaches outlets ..........lol  bran new washer and dryer wont like it either...........nor the few month old carpet...........  Im not going to stress out over it .........it will be what it will be no matter who i call or what i do..........  they observe the river steady and already know its water levels im sure.  Maybe if my house floods.............Ill park my hummer at dam with the biggest sign i can make saying  THANKS FOR FLOODING MY HOUSE AND RAISING MY INSURANCE RATES EGG HEADS!  :)
185147,Riparian,2008-04-11 00:19:00,269,I think you should listen to Sinker and call the conservation authority...
185237,spooner_jr,2008-04-11 02:22:00,193,"Most homeowner policies exclude flooding, so you may want to check before you move the ""plasma"" to the basement."
185426,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-11 14:32:00,314,woke up this morning to water in basement  Not much but its starting........   Heading home at noon to start getting prepared..............  Will also get on the phone and see if anyone will listen.
185850,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-12 03:07:00,314,Well  did the calls today...............got the letter..........  going to FLOOD!!!!  takes 10 people to do about 50% of the sand bagging required for my house.............errrrrrrrrr  all help need.............  i think im in serious trouble here.........   no help and lots of work   insurance wont cover either..........just sweet  grandfather has about 48hrs to live aswell.............nice  sorry im new.............but ............  my cards just fell apart.........

185857,Sinker,2008-04-12 03:15:00,8692,"Sorry to hear that man! I'm sure the community will pull together, and you'll all get through it.  Can you get the sand and bags?"
185880,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-12 04:01:00,314,They are only help people that are disabled......  im on my own......  fire department was already here.........  im beat......  will take about 30 plus people to bag my house..........  they are going to drop sand off in morning........  this isnt cool
185893,HTHM,2008-04-12 04:32:00,4082,"I feel for you man, if I could I would come tonight to help you out. We just went through a flood in our basement, due to a pipe burst, if you can rent a number of LARGE dehumidifiers and air movers for when the waters recede. Take out 2 feet of drywall and lift out the underpad of the carpet."
185905,fatherof3,2008-04-12 05:25:00,1769,"sorry to hear,had been hoping for the best for you."
185906,Ramble,2008-04-12 05:26:00,713,Man I really feel for you. If i was in town i'd come and help. Keep us posted on what happens.  -Dave
186541,HTHM,2008-04-13 17:47:00,4082,How did you make out???
186671,fishindevil,2008-04-13 23:05:00,6254,"Man i hope things turn out ok,we are thinking about you take care and be safe !!!!"
186679,Ramble,2008-04-13 23:14:00,713,I bet that the Moria hasn't crested yet...there is a day or two lag time after a good rain before she hits peak flow. I heard the fire dept was running around trying to help people. Hope you were one of the people receiving.  -R-
186770,Daplumma,2008-04-14 01:20:00,1961,"Bad news bud,let us know how it works out and if there is anything we can do to help. Joe"

189397,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-19 01:36:00,314,Ive won the battle!!!  Now got a pile of sandbags to get rid of!!!!!

Radio today was saying theres a flood watch for my road God dont let my fishing season start in the basement 
184605,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 23:28:00,314,The log!!!  Is my sweet fire pit 
184607,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 23:29:00,314,Notice my satilite dish behind dog kennel  just great 
184608,Gerritt,2008-04-09 23:31:00,6129,Man.... I have been watching the news on areas around the Trent Severn.. I Hope that you do not have to go through this experience as well.... do you have yourself a good pump just in case?  G
184610,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 23:33:00,314,Yeah i got several pumps at work............. im not chewing my nails yet......  see how it is by this time tommorow.........then i might start to worry
184615,MuddyWater,2008-04-09 23:37:00,218,the bunch of rain their calling for this weekend wont be good
184617,Sinker,2008-04-09 23:39:00,8692,"Is that ""normal"" for this time of year there?  That's a lot of water!!"
184620,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 23:43:00,314,The Rain is going to be a issue and warm weather to follow early next week isnt the best either!!!  Normal.............  well  i have seen it a bit higher one year..........but there was no warnings in effect.  it that year it also took twice the time for it to reach these levels.............   this has gone up a foot to two feet per day!!!  im only about 3 feet or less and it will be pouring in the basement...........  So with my high tech calculations  lol  if it continues to go as it has for 2 more days ................guess what.............  i will be fishing in the comfort on my own basement  not agaist the law to drink and drive your couch is it ??????
184623,Gerritt,2008-04-09 23:45:00,6129,   I call shotgun!!  G
184625,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 23:51:00,314,I think the bass might be good right around the furnace myself   OK now iam getting a bit worried.......  just went downstairs and subpump is HOT and only shutting off for about 15 seconds..............  NO SPARE!!!
184632,GbayGiant,2008-04-09 23:59:00,1780,"Damn, hope your ok, only 3 feet to go not much to work with. Get the sand bags out. I don't know if they even work, but they do in the movies.  Maybe call the fire station or police and see if they can help some how before it's too late ?"
184635,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-10 00:04:00,314,3 feet verticle  actually when i was just out........its more like a foot and half  sand bags wont help ...........  i just hope i dont wake up to a poop show in the morning ............  im the lowest house to top things off........both neighbours are in much better shape so far...  might have to get on the phone in the morning if it continues to rise at this rate...........will got out tonight before i goto bed and check new stick i put up.
184645,Ramble,2008-04-10 00:20:00,713,"Well man THAT sucks....no two ways about it. They have been getting flooded along their as long as i can remember, Foxboro gets pretty wet too. I don't know whose bright idea it was to let them develop the flood plain, but that guy should be strapped to one of the trees in your backyard and see if might be able to come up with a few reasons why it was a bad idea.  That's why belleville has all the dams in it to begin with....they built half the city on the river's flood plain....my elementry school was built one flood plain....you want to talk about a school full of wet, stinking kids in the spring lol  I hope everything works out. Keep us posted.  -R-"
184648,irishfield,2008-04-10 00:24:00,26272,Still time to rush to CTC.. get a submersable and throw it in the sump hole to keep up. Hopefully it doesn't rise much further... but I wouldn't be depending on one sump pump.  Good sense of humour thru it all though.. movin all that stuff to the basement. You do have flood coverage on your insurance.. correct. Been an option for some time...
184651,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-10 00:33:00,314,Ill  bring home some more pumps in morning after getting coffee  First picture that comes to my mind is me and family sitting here watching tv and fishing through holes in living room floor          be just like ice fishing............but have tv and nice couch to relax on  ok almost ticked myself.................   wife thinks im strange to  insurance...............should be on there .............shhhhhhhhhhhh   gota call in morning ..............already told wife its covered .................  wife didnt  find it funny when i asked her if i could tie her to the couch in the basement tonight either  told her i was just feeling frisky
184680,Greencoachdog,2008-04-10 01:18:00,8163,"You gotta take the bad with the good when you live in flood prone areas. We see it every year at this time, people whizzin' and moanin' about being flooded out every year. Here's a hint... move to higher ground... or live on a boat!!!"
184721,FinS,2008-04-10 02:19:00,463,i gues all i have to say is a little rant  mother nature does what she is best at and expect a little more
184723,FinS,2008-04-10 02:20:00,463,just deal with it and go with the flow
184761,Ramble,2008-04-10 03:36:00,713,If you need water wings or rescue by canoe let me know lolololol
184776,scuro,2008-04-10 04:18:00,386, Not the best phrase to use with basement flooding..
184780,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-10 05:10:00,835,"I was told they are holding the water back to work on the dams, you might want to call whatever authorities maybe they can help you out. If your the lowest house and they are holding the water back I would think they would want to hear from you."
184783,Sinker,2008-04-10 05:49:00,8692,"Your local consevation authority should have sandbags if you need them, and the municipality should supply you with sand to fill them. I'd be making some calls in the morning. We're gonna get some substantial rain in the next few days. If they keep holding back water, your screwed. I'm not sure who controls the dams there......C.A or Trent severn?  One sump pump isn't gonna do squat. I'd go get another one for sure. That's a pretty big risk to be taking. I just had mine quit yesterday, and in a matter of hours I had about an inch of water in half of my basement. I had a spare, but it doesn't help me if I'm not here to turn it on. I've been looking at the 12V back ups, but they don't fit the budget right now.....  If I was in that situation, I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight!!!  Sinker"
184862,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-10 14:05:00,314,Got some pumps in truck right now.......  went up alot over night  For now im just keeping a eye on it ...........   not a whole lot really can be done.  she floods..............she floods..............it is what it is  garage is just starting to flood .........   have to shift some stuff around tonight when i get home.
184864,Entropy,2008-04-10 14:10:00,747,"I hear ya!!  A week ago Tuesday when the melt started, my sump pump was coming on every 2.5 min, went out and bought another pump and a generator.  I have not needed either yet but it sure is comforting to know I'll be .... ok.  Entropy"
184866,Mike01,2008-04-10 14:16:00,378,Have you thought about going to a rental place and getting a gas powered pump.  You don't have to run it all the time but I'm sure it would move more water than an electric.
