189308,Jigger,2008-04-18 22:23:00,1237,"No problem Hookset, I understand hasty posting  .  Steve, I've seen fish from 43-48in out of there. I'm not saying I'm personally going to get one of them myself, because I haven't. But I'm trying to point out one of the inherant problems with tourney fishing. Lack of flexibility is one of the major problems with getting new blood out there. And throwing a post-spawn pike that desn't comfortably fit can't be good for a fish trying to get its mojo back.  I'd be interested in how the musky tourney guys do it. I can't imagine they try and stuff as many 'skis in their livewells as possible."
189309,Gerritt,2008-04-18 22:29:00,6129,  true Muskie fisherman have no need for a livewell... as the fish swims away.  once again.. a large cooler and aerator will fit a large pike.  G
189310,Jigger,2008-04-18 22:34:00,1237,"Sure the muskie swims away, but who records it in a tourney situation? Like Steve said, photos create controversy. Although I have a feeling the guy doing the complaining is the guy in 2nd place"
189359,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-19 00:23:00,826,"Running anything is a thankless job and requires thick skin!! Wish I could make it but gotta work , but I will own you at the BPS tourneys!!!! Let the trash talk start .LOL....... Rustic fisher"
188695,steverowbotham,2008-04-17 16:45:00,1800,"Hey everyone, just letting you know that I will be holding a fun tournament on Lake Couchiching on pike opener, May 10.

188738,capt bruce,2008-04-17 18:06:00,820,"Sounds like fun a little competion to make the opener interesting , but I just dont know what I would do with 3 big pike(in my case they will  probably be small pike and probably not 3 ) in the live well how will the measureing be done ."
188755,steverowbotham,2008-04-17 18:41:00,1800,We will have a 48 inch measure board.
188764,capt bruce,2008-04-17 18:52:00,820,"I knew you would use a measureing devise , what i was getting at was will this be a catch and keep or can I measure and let go ?? I dont like eating pike much ( a small one now and than , but not the 3 biggest I caught that day) ?? I hope Im not comeing across like a pita guy , I have nothing against keeping and eating fish just for me not pike (muskies and steallhead only lol )"
188770,ccmtcanada,2008-04-17 19:03:00,7971,"Just keep them in an aerated live well, then release them after measuring."
188802,Jigger,2008-04-17 20:52:00,1237,"My livewell is only about 26in or so. IF I were to enter, I don't think I would be able to stuff a pike, let alone 3, in there."
188813,Gerritt,2008-04-17 21:15:00,6129,cooler with an aerator  would work in a pinch...  G
189010,steverowbotham,2008-04-18 05:25:00,1800,Aerated Live Wells only.  Catch and Release Tournament
189086,BillM,2008-04-18 13:24:00,17367,Why not a quick pic with a measurement and release the fish?  No need to keep them in the livewell any longer then they have to.
189095,Roy,2008-04-18 13:42:00,13728,Wish I was closer Steve. Sounds like a good time for everyone. Looking forward to the report(s). Don't let anyone change your rules.
189100,capt bruce,2008-04-18 13:48:00,820,"With my pike luck they will have no problem fitting in my live well (thats if I even catch 1,never mind 3 ) Im trying to work the time out with my son but I like this Idea of makeing the day a little more interesting with a little friendly competion, I will pm if things work out and hopeing to see ya there . B"
189105,bassman,2008-04-18 14:00:00,384,"Maybe we can gaff, string up and drag the big pike into shore, just like the Tarpon tournaments.  "
189109,PickerelHunter,2008-04-18 14:09:00,100,I'd love to join but don't have a boat.  Any boaters have an open spot maybe?  Please let me know.
189160,medmart,2008-04-18 15:37:00,587,Hey Steve could you post a map where this is i am not familiar with that area then i will let you know if i am interested  Thanks Rob
189175,steverowbotham,2008-04-18 16:08:00,1800," We will have one person doing all the measurements.  These are the rules of the tournament, if you like them, fish it, if you dont, then dont."
189176,Cory,2008-04-18 16:11:00,170, Bend them in half and your good to go.
189179,steverowbotham,2008-04-18 16:14:00,1800,  Launch is on Centennial Drive at Couchiching Beach Park
189241,highdrifter,2008-04-18 18:39:00,2534, LOL.  Live release tourneys nowadays are pretty standard..  at least I hope so!
189244,BillM,2008-04-18 18:47:00,17367," Not my tournament, not my rules.  Just a simple suggestion to put more live fish back into the lake.  Good luck, I hope you have a decent turn out."
189256,Jigger,2008-04-18 19:13:00,1237," Im thinking it would be great fun, but just need a better idea of how to transport the fish. Not all of us have a 50in livewell, you know? I just don't get how you're supposed to fit a 30+in fish in a small space like that and expect it to live?"
189270,misfish,2008-04-18 20:00:00,29133," You could always run and gun the fish to the wieghin then realease right away.The lakes not that big,so putting a big fish in a small well that has water pumping through it should not hurt the fish. IMO"
189271,Hookset,2008-04-18 20:02:00,367,"Good on ya for organizing this Steve,  Since I have no issues with the rules, I'm looking forward to the event. Will PM you for sure.  Steve you will go nuts trying to change rules to accomodate everyone. Just leave it to best judgement...If the livewell is too small - fish somewhere else.   Hookset."
189280,Jigger,2008-04-18 20:32:00,1237,"  I don't know that anyones trying to change rules. Im just asking what kind of...whatever man.  If the livewell is too small, fish somewhere else? Why not.  Maybe I'll go to Couch and try to catch some pike regardless. But if my livewell is too small, I should fish another lake, because my live release tools aren't enough. I really should have a bigger livewell in order to fish Lake Couchiching. Great idea.   Good luck with your tourney, Steve."
189293,steverowbotham,2008-04-18 21:32:00,1800,"These are standard tournament rules, with pictures there will always be controversy.  Having a weigh in (or measure-in) is the simplest way to do it.  Live release pike tournaments happen every year.  I have a 30 inch livewell but on the angle, it's about a 35 inch livewell and fits a 38 inch pike just fine.  I've never seen a pike over 38 inches weighed in out of Couchiching yet.  Not saying it couldnt happen, but these rules are standard.  If they dont appeal to you, then I'm sorry, maybe a pike tournament is not for you."
189295,Hookset,2008-04-18 21:38:00,367," Yer' right Jigger, saying go fish somewhere else wasn't correct. What I should have said was fish for ""something"" else. Hitting ""send"" as I run out of the office was a mistake before proof reading. My Bad sorry.  Hookset."
