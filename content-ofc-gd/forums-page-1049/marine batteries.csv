188038,Maverick,2008-04-16 12:20:00,371," Yeah, I think I will go with one or two of those for my 16ft, depending on if I get a 12V or 24V elec. motor. The weight is what I was worried about but it's in my price range and I have heard good things! Thanks for all the comments guys!"

So, in short. I have nothign but good to say about Kirkland batteries. to me they are god sent, all three batteries were under liek $200 all in."
188849,moemoe,2008-04-17 23:32:00,352,"After doing a bit of research, I ended up picking up 2 deep cycle marine batteries from Acme battery in Hamilton, which are made by Deka, which after a short google search seem to be decent, 2 large batteries with 810 mca and a 225 reserve capacity for $110 a piece after receveing a small deposit for 6 old batteries, plus there is no extra ""recycling charge"" as per ctc, and I believe the capacity's were better than the largest nautilus available, only down side is they only have a 1 year replacement warranty, no prorated warranty so we'll see"
