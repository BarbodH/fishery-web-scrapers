189103,Gerritt,2008-04-18 13:56:00,6129,I figured I would begin my search here knowing the pool of talent on OFC.....    Our firm is looking for a talented individual to help us in developing our corporate identity on the web. As we are published in more and more magazines and build relationships with the hottest up and coming architects this is a requirement.  a bit of background  We are a celebrated high end custom home builder in the GTA. Our homes are extremely modern in design and function. The site would need to reflect this.  We are looking for something completely custom... so No Templates.  We are not looking for a run of the mill site..   Alot of content will be added to the site from our various projects to establish a virtual portfolio.   The designer we pick will have to be proficient in the most popular programming languages used today.. Simple knowledge of HTML or CSS will not do..  A Graphic Design background would certainly be desirable. As well as Photography skills   The designer would also have recurring work as more and more projects are completed.   G
