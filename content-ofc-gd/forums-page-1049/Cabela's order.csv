189239,Billy Bob,2008-04-18 18:38:00,5865,"I order from Cabela's using my account via the Internet and you can track everything much better that way.  Twice now I got a email notice with the tracking number only to receive the item the same day (2 days after I ordered it).  I don't think it can get better than that.  I know you Canadian brothers have some issues with shipping that we don't have but you can register with Cabela's if you already haven't and have a Internet account with them and order via Internet using this account. I really like having the ""Wish List"" you can establish with your account. That way if I see something I like but don't what to order right away I put it in my wish list for a later date. Here's the link what I am talking about. https://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true"

From: Cabela's Customer Service <[emailÂ protected]> To: xxxxxscape.net Sent: Mon, 25 Feb 2008 2:21 pm Subject: [incident: 08xx0-0xxxx]    Hello Terry,  Thank you for your correspondence.

188310,danc,2008-04-16 22:30:00,4677,"I picked up my new rod and reel in Minnesota today. The half hour drive saved me $50.00 in shipping costs, but I had to pay $8.00 GST at the border. I'm always a little leary about buying rods and reels without holding them in my hand and getting a feel for them. But with Cabelas, there's no problem returning anything if you don't like it. But man. I love everything about my purchase. I bought an 8 1/2 foot light action spinning rod (Cabelas Fish Eagle II) and a Cabelas Prodigy (Diawa) spinning reel. They balance out perfectly and I can't wait to catch my first Brookie on it."

189171,BillM,2008-04-18 15:58:00,17367,"It's really not up to Cabela's on how long it takes to get across the border.  Who are they using for shipping?  UPS?  USPS?  FedEX?  If they shipped it via USPS Expedited, it would be here quick and with minimal border fees."
