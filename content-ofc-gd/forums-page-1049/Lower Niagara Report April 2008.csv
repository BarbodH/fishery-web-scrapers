188939,Joey,2008-04-18 02:06:00,9122,"Paul and I booked a week off to fish the Lower Niagara this year, instead of our Easter long weekend.  We cut it a bit short as we are both sitting here with sunstroke and its all I can do to write this.  A reminder to all that the sun is strong no matter how cold it may be in the morning and spending 3 days in it from dawn til dusk might not be a great idea   We arrived Sunday late afternoon and settled into our usual motel room.    We headed down to the launch in the morning and started our drifts. The clarity was better than we thought it might be after the rains last weekend, but still not the best.  About a foot of visability.  The drifts were fast and unpredictable. It was pretty nippy until about 12 noon or so and then the layers started to come off.  It was a tough go the whole time and the shore fishermen were kicking our butts.  Paul got one small one the first day and that was it.     The river was pretty clear of ice, except for a few bergs that drifted by, usually with gulls on them.    These ducks were everywhere, and loud.     Day two was pretty nippy again in the morning and this time there was a bit more ice coming down, but not until later in the day.  Someone said they had opened the boom.    Paul ended up with three and myself with one fish that day.  The shore fishermen kicked our butts again    We measured mine and it was a nice 29.5 inches.  The biggest of the week.        We went to our favorite restaurant that night for escargots, mussels and steak, yum yum.  Day three we got down to the launch and saw that they did indeed open the boom.  There was alot of ice.  Gotta love the sound of ice pinging off the boat all day    There was also alot of other crap in the water and it was a bit of an obstacle course all day.    This copter flew by pretty low so I grabbed a pic of it.  Pretty cool.    The fishing was hard again Wednesday and we only managed two all day, one apiece.  They were pretty spawned out and dark.      Took some shots of birds while we booted it back to the start of the drift on my zoom lense.  Some turned out okay.        We planned on fishing today aswell, but the sunstroke took over and it was hard to just to get home.  Slept most of the afternoon.  Took my temp and it was 100.4 and my pulse 122, both signs of sunstroke, to go along with the overall aches, red skin from sunburn, headache, dizziness and dehydration feeling.  Gonna wear a floppy hat next time  Joey"
188942,irishfield,2008-04-18 02:10:00,26272,Was wondering where you were hun and to think you'z was out fishing!  Now who'd a thought!  Some great fish there Joey.. and glad to see you left a few for Paul.  Now go pull out an extra winter blanket... gotta feeling you'll be looking for one in a wee while...
188947,Musky or Specks,2008-04-18 02:14:00,2710,Nice report Joey. Our core body temp is something that we should all be aware of. I spent a day in my floattube with just shorts in the heat of August with water temps in the low 80's. It still gave me a pretty serious case of hypothermia. If the shore guys were kicking butt I wish I would've went down.
188949,sonny,2008-04-18 02:18:00,511,"sorry ya ain't feelin to well but a few days on the water just might be worth it,,,i know i'd do it in a heartbeat if i could get outta work,,lol,,,,,,great report,,,now go get some rest!!"

Ya gotta acclimate yourself slowly after being cooped upand wrapped up all winter... yer not from Alabanana yanno!  Take a little Codine if you can, it will help."

189120,Joey,2008-04-18 14:29:00,9122,"Thanks everyone.  It was a nice relaxing trip this time, not rushed into a weekend like usual.  I'm still a bit woozy this morning, but feeling quite a bit better.  Might even be able to keep a coffee down now  Probably gonna get some yard work done.  Now where's my floppy hat  Joey"
189126,fishnsled,2008-04-18 14:38:00,3520,Great report and pics Joey!    Good to here that you're on the mend as well.  I got myself a Tilley a couple of years ago.  I probably don't wear it as much as I should but I know that it's saved my butt a few times.  Money well spent I'd say if I could just remember to bring it more often.  I know that I don't think of it in the cooler temps but this has been a good reminder to do so.
189128,solopaddler,2008-04-18 14:40:00,8605,Great stuff Joey! Regardless of the consequences it sure is nice to bask in the warm sun after the winter we've had.
189140,Carp,2008-04-18 15:02:00,1488,Looks light an excellent trip except for the sun related issues. Excellent pics Jo.  Thanks for sharing.

189168,1leggedangler,2008-04-18 15:50:00,364,"Looks like a couple of great days on the water! Sorry to hear about the sun stroke, been there, no fun at all! Awesome pics, thanks for the report.  Cheers, 1leg"
189177,douG,2008-04-18 16:12:00,2693,"Nice shootin', Joanne.  Nice to see some pics of you and Paul doing what you do best on the lower N.  I was sorry to hear about the heatstroke / sunstroke.  I've had that too and you really feel like crap.  Like my hat?"
