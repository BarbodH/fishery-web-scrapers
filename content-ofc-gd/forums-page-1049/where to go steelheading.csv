Seeing as i'm getting laid off on sunday and will have some spare time on my hands at a crappy time of year, maybe this is the time to take up steelheading,  my first question would be where to go?  i'm from sudbury and wouldn't want to travel to southern ontario to learn so staying as close to home as possible is important, but alas I have no clue where to go, I'm thinkin probably manitoulin island but am not sure, maybe somewhere along the north shore of huron  soooooo.... if anybody could guide towards a creek/river/whatever it would be REALLY appreciated.  if not thanks anyways"
188829,Casey123,2008-04-17 22:15:00,461,Any trib that flows into Huron or the St MAry's river would be a good place to start.  Pancake bay in Sault St. Marie if you don't mind the drive. The Goulais River is another great rive just north of the Sault.
188833,Musky or Specks,2008-04-17 22:23:00,2710,"Wow Sudbury eh, not exactly a well known steelhead area. Manitoulin is going to be the closest. The French gets a trickle of them but to target them would be a tough task. St Mary's is probably your best bet."

188851,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-17 23:36:00,2050,"duuuuude - I'm originally from suds - born and raised!  I know some good brookie spots, but no idea when it come to stellheading.  I'd tend to agree that the island is a good place to start....  Good luck! UF"
188860,solopaddler,2008-04-18 00:09:00,8605,"St. Mary's rapids in the Soo. It gets better later in May and into June. Big water though, it can be intimidating."
188969,troutologist,2008-04-18 02:43:00,951,"Between the soo and sudbury has some tribs, thessalon gets a run. The rapids is gonna start up late this year due to the weather. Few fish but the same catches as through the winter. Though Ive never been there I hear guys fish manitoulin and some fisheries guys I know have done work on rainbow there."

189125,walleyejigger,2008-04-18 14:35:00,876,"Thanx for the reply's guys, looks like manitoulin and maybe thessalon will be my start points, the soo is a little far for now.  Thanx again"
