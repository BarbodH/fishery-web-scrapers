Doreen was taking care of the funeral arrangements with the undertaker when she was asked how she wanted Matt's obituary to read. Doreen asked the undertaker, ""How much does an obituary cost?"" The undertaker replied, ""One dollar per word."" Doreen then said, ""I want the obituary to read - MATT IS DEAD."" The undertaker was an old fishing buddy of Matt's and he was a little disturbed by such a curt obituary, so he offered, ""I'll make you a special deal since I knew Matt so well. I'll pay for half of the obituary out of my own pocket."" Doreen's face lit up and she replied, ""Great. I want it to read - MATT IS DEAD, BOAT FOR SALE."""

One day he rented out his boat to a group of out-of-staters who ended up sinking it. He spent all day trying to salvage as much stuff as he could from the sunken vessel and was out of touch all that day and most of the evening. Unbeknownst to him, his brother John's wife had died suddenly in his absence. When he got back on shore he went into town to pick up a few things at the grocery. A kind old woman there mistook him for John and said, ""I'm so sorry for your loss. You must feel terrible."" Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat said, ""Hell no! Fact is I'm sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old dead fish. She was always holding water. She had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too. Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy."" ""I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to those four guys looking for a good time. I warned them that she wasn't very good and that she smelled bad. But they wanted her anyway. The damn fools tried to get in her all at one time and she split right up the middle."" The old woman fainted."

""Have you ever been a salesman before?"" the boss asked during his interview. ""Yes, I was a salesman in Texas,"" the lad answered. The boss took an immediate liking to him and told him he could start the next day. ""I'll come and see how you made out after we close up,"" the boss said. The day was long and hard for the young man, but finally it was 5 o'clock. The boss closed up the store and found the lad sitting, slumped and exhausted, in a chair. ""How many sales did you make today?"" the boss asked. ""One,"" said the lad. ""One?"" said the boss, obviously displeased. ""Most of the sales people on my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale worth?"" ""Exactly $101,334.53,"" said the young man. ""How did you manage that?"" asked the boss, flabbergasted. ""Well,"" said the lad, ""this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium fish hook, and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a small fishing line, a medium one, and huge one. I asked him where he was going fishing, and he said he was going down the coast. I said he'd probably need a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that fancy 22-foot Chris Craft with twin engines. Then he said his Honda Civic probably wouldn't be able to handle the load, so I took him to the vehicle department and sold him a new GMC 1-ton pickup truck."" ""You sold all that to guy who came in for a fish hook?"" the boss asked in astonishment. ""He didn't come in to buy a fish hook,"" the Texas boy explained. ""He came in to buy a box of tampons for his wife, and I said to him, 'Your weekend's shot. You might as well go fishing.' """
