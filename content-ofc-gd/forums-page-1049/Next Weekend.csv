This will be the last time before the big opener......which I might add, I will also have to do alone this year.  So anyone wants to head up to G bay this weekend I am game.  will be in Stayner for 7:00ish and no I will not be interested in fishing the Tanglebury or in Meaford.  But I will be fishing some good local tribs that have produced nicely for us.  Brrutled or whatever your name is, I would take you but to quote ""people should get off their lazy asses and find their own fishing spots"" LOL   Michael"
