188834,Rob,2008-04-17 22:33:00,467,Well let's hear em. With ten to 1 odds my money is saying Serra (just cause I like to take risks!). But my heart and my guts are saying Georges St.Pierre.  Franklin should win this one against Lutter  Would like to see McCarthy beat Bisping   Nate Quarry should be Kalib Starnes  Let's hope our other Canadian Jason MacDonald can do us proud as well.   Rob
188838,danbo,2008-04-17 22:45:00,2646,"Rush,Lutter,Bisping,Quarry,J Mac."
188848,misfish,2008-04-17 23:30:00,29133,"I got 2-20 I can come by and kick yer leg and you will say ,UNCLE.LOL Hows things Rob? ST.P all the way."
188944,Burtess,2008-04-18 02:11:00,901,"I too am going with GSP...  But what the heck happened to Jeff Joslin??  He supposedly signed a 3 fight contract, but after his fight with Koscheck back in Dec. 06, nothing...  I was hoping he would be on this card, can't even find any info on the UFC site about him anymore, maybe they dropped him??  Burt"
188966,BillM,2008-04-18 02:40:00,17367,"GSP absolutely dominated Hugh's in his last fight.  No one, not even Serra has done what GSP did to Hugh's.  I know it's been said a million times but Serra got lucky the first time around.  GSP is going to dominate him, I have no doubt about it.  Personally, I hope he lets it go to the later rounds and pounds Serra into bloody submission.  I bet this is going to be the wildest UFC yet, the fans out in Montreal are going to go ballistic!"
188976,glirw,2008-04-18 02:54:00,200,"Serra vs. GSP is too close to call, because we don't know which GSP is gonna show up, the shaky/scared/nervous/distracted GSP, or the composed, confident, demolition-man GSP. If GSP is indeed a 'mental midget', he will lose by KO/TKO round 1 If GSP comes prepared, he will KO/TKO serra round 1 or 2  Franklin over Lutter by Decision  Bisping over McCarthy by TKO  Danzig over home-boy Bocek by TKO  Quarry over Starnes by whatever he wants  MacDonald by Decision"
189051,Crazyhook,2008-04-18 11:31:00,1154,"CHainsaw Charles McCarthy!!! I am biased though...  Also GSP, MAc Danzig, Lutter, Quarry, and Joe Dirty!"
189084,Bitsmith2k,2008-04-18 13:21:00,396,"i guess i'll be the devils advocate (read: loser) that bets on Serra..  comeon.. how can the champ be such a huge underdog in a rematch, after he so convincingly won the first match?   Lutter, Mac, Chainsaw, and the Athlete.."
189088,Gerritt,2008-04-18 13:28:00,6129,  I trained with Jeff @ Joslins here in Hamilton many moons ago.. Looks like injury pulled him out last year.  More info for you..  http://mmajunkie.com/news/2055/jeff-joslin...e-to-injury.mma   http://mmajunkie.com/news/3490/jeff-joslin...in-montreal.mma   G
189089,Reef Runner,2008-04-18 13:30:00,981,"  I agree with you the winners on all the picks, but not the how.  GSP by TKO, Franklin by TKO, Bisping by decision, Danzig by decision, Quarry by TKO and MacD by decision"
189096,Pachone,2008-04-18 13:42:00,276,"St. Pierre for sure.  Serra wants it bad, but i dont think hes got what it takes.  Bisping over McCarthey too"
189129,walleyejigger,2008-04-18 14:44:00,876,"GSP BABY  unfortunately i'll be working at the time,  i tried to get tickets when they came out, wow harder to get than a playoff hockey game"
189133,Mark Kulik,2008-04-18 14:52:00,348,"Georges is the man!-seeing him comeback so strong after a devestating loss speaks volumes about his will and determination! Franklin Lutter will be interesting, after watching them both fight Silva -I'm picking Lutter-especially if it goes to the ground, Bisping over Mcarthy-ko , I think Starnes will pull off an upset, I think Bocek has what it takes to submitt Danzig, and JMac. to win, I really looking forward to this one!"
189265,jeffw,2008-04-18 19:45:00,267,St.Pierre will win and franklin don't know with the others. Cheers Jeff
189376,addict,2008-04-19 00:59:00,475,love to see gsp smoke serra and would love to see bisbing eat a few knuckles
189403,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-19 01:49:00,314,GSP by submission second round. Franklin by KO first round.
189426,forrest,2008-04-19 02:50:00,1032,I am betting on Serra getting spanked.  He got lucky with that blow to the back of the head last time and then would not shut his mouth.  He has no class.  A paddling is required.   I am also betting on it being a great set of fights.
