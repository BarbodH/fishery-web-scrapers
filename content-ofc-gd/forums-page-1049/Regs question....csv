188786,kemper,2008-04-17 20:06:00,2232,"Ok, so you have a friend that happens to have a big patch of land at his cottage. On that land happens to be a small pond FULL of bass that your friend stocked there. This pond is 100 percent ON the property and 100 percent CUT OFF from any other waterway. Do the normal regulations apply or not?  I know the moral ruling here, don't fish it until the season is open. But its not the moral answer I am looking for, I want to know what the regs say.   DISCLAIMER- I do not accept any responsibility for the actions of any board members which may cause this thread to get locked/deleted/burned at the stake.  Thanks all.  For the record no I am not planning on fishing it."
188795,urbanangler1990,2008-04-17 20:32:00,933,"hmm , well wouldnt he have to have a farming permit or something like that?  id love to have a pond like that"
188796,bushart,2008-04-17 20:32:00,2628,"I'm no expert but I would interpret the law as --it is still a body of water within Ontario---stocking was probably taken from wild fish--so That too would be in question under transporting fish.  Non seasonal ""Commercial"" trout ponds are licenced and regulated allowing the all year angling opps.  Good Luck"
188798,Fang,2008-04-17 20:41:00,1330,Yes - He would have to have the proper license to legally fish out of posted Ontario seasons. Fishing/Hunting clubs sometimes do this with trout ponds on their property and same license applies to public fish ponds like the one in Shannonville  I grew up with an uncle that had a private trout pond and we could only fish by the regular seasosns as the pond was checked regularly by local MNR guys. The MNR would even phone my uncle when they found other anglers trespassing or fishing out of season.
188800,wuchikubo,2008-04-17 20:46:00,1114,My guess is it falls under the regular regs unless it's cleared by MNR. I don't know the procedures but do know that it is possible as I've been to a club that has privately stocked trout (via the proper transportation of fish permits) and does not have to follow the OMNR regs with no fishing license required as well by registered club members and their guests. Falls under commercial trout pond I guess. (really only a guess).
188826,bassjnkie,2008-04-17 22:10:00,1101,"I just got back from a bass farm, I think you will be ok. I had my licence, but you don't even need that.  I know a quarry owner that has loads of bass, we are going Sat.  I don't think you can put laws on stocked ponds, how about trout farms.  Dude you will be ok to fish there.  Daniel"
188974,kemper,2008-04-18 02:53:00,2232,Im not really too concerned with fishing there...I just wondered about the actual rules about it thats all.  Thanks guys...next time I run into a CO on the river ill ask him.
188978,forrest,2008-04-18 03:03:00,1032,"just curious, how big is ""a big patch of land""?  How big is the pond?  Is it a naturally occurring body of water or man made?  forrest"
188979,kemper,2008-04-18 03:04:00,2232,"Naturally occuring body of water...spring fed but not connected to any lakes/rivers.  Land is several acres..not sure exactly i would have to ask. The pond is SMALL, like a cast and a half across but it is relatively deep for its size...gotta be about 12 feet in the middle."
188986,gone_fishin,2008-04-18 03:15:00,481,"if it's a natural body of water (not mad made) then i would have to say regular regulations apply... but if it's a man made ""farm pond"" on private property, it would be up to the owner... they can fish it or let people fish it all they want.  my grandmother has a friend with a farm pond loaded with bass and they have complete control over when and who fishes it. it's their pond and they stocked it with the fish."
188998,Sinker,2008-04-18 04:18:00,8692,Why would you want to fish for dirty ole bass anyways?
189008,Musky or Specks,2008-04-18 05:04:00,2710,This is the way I beleive the law is interpreted
189063,kemper,2008-04-18 12:11:00,2232,That is kind of the way I was leaning...good to know!  thanks
189130,DANIMAL,2008-04-18 14:49:00,215,"As far as I know if the pond is entirely private and privately stocked, any regulations are up to the owner/stocker. Otherwise the mnr regs apply."
