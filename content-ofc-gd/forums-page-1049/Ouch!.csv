188762,rickster,2008-04-17 18:51:00,495,hope he has good boat ramp etiquette that looks like it might take a while to launch and reload
188766,ccmtcanada,2008-04-17 19:00:00,7971, That's the beauty of this set up...you dont need a ramp...just go fast...and brake hard.  Because of the angle the boat is on I'd say you'd only need to get within 10 feet of the water and it's launched.  Oh yeah...dont forget to tie the boat to the truck.....

188391,Bernie,2008-04-17 00:19:00,3190,This must have been scary!      
188394,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:22:00,6129,holy crap!.... guess he should have kept his eyes on the road instead of on his TomTom or yaking on his cell phone....  what a waste of a good Bayliner.... who care about the truck... its a dodge... LOL  G
188395,Rich Clemens,2008-04-17 00:22:00,3131,Definitely a pants-filler.
188397,kemper,2008-04-17 00:24:00,2232,That right there is why drinking and driving is illegal.  How do you drive straight into a pole? I mean really...it didn't jump out at you!
188398,irishfield,2008-04-17 00:25:00,26272,Dodge doing new payload advertisments?  And so many guys say that their boat is heavy enough they don't need transom straps. That shows exactly why they do. On my old Glastron I also had 4 mooring ropes and tied them down around the frame.  Guess this thing must have riped the bow cleat out?
188399,Bernie,2008-04-17 00:25:00,3190, Ha ha ha ha ha...You just have to stir the pot dont ya!
188401,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:28:00,6129,  You know me Bernie... always good for a bit of entertainment!  G
188402,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:29:00,6129,  which is why I was thankful you had a spare Wayne when one of mine snapped in my hands...  dangerous for sure.  G
188410,Spiel,2008-04-17 00:39:00,9065,"....I think the driver was merely having difficulty with the term ""launching the boat""."
188414,Bernie,2008-04-17 00:42:00,3190,The boat probably worked well in rough water.
188428,Nanook,2008-04-17 01:08:00,565," So, you've never heard the phrase; "" this pole suddenly appeared in front of me ""  I did a lot of accident investigations at one time, and it's surprising how often that excuse appeared."
188431,Mike the Pike,2008-04-17 01:10:00,3421,Hey is that Jen's truck towing fishmasters boat
188432,Gerritt,2008-04-17 01:11:00,6129,  Hahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahaaaaaa!   G
188451,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-17 01:30:00,835,I got to save that for the boating coarse.
188469,GbayGiant,2008-04-17 01:51:00,1780,Crazy. Looks like the truck has some nice suspension though.
188522,Victor,2008-04-17 02:57:00,1609,"hm. i think they're trying to advertise that bayliners + dodge don't need trailers  on top of that, the truck can still do off-road and is as tough as a pole"
188559,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-17 08:18:00,1183,Perhaps a separation/divorce agreement gone bad... lol
188608,bigbuck,2008-04-17 12:37:00,2449,"Built Dodge Tough!!! I guess he realized that a Bayliner is like AIDS, you can't get rid of either!!! (no offence to any Bayliner owners, it's a joke that a buddy who used to own one always said). He can collect on insurance now. Poor bugger."
188610,Mike01,2008-04-17 12:45:00,378,WOW....does anyone know where this was??
188614,blaque,2008-04-17 12:50:00,2419," That was my thought, the back end doesnt even bottom out with a Bayliner in the bed of the truck. Not bad. Also, lets not rule out that some other idiot ran the red light and left the poor guy going fishing having to swerve to avoid t-boning the idiot. Consequently running into the pole. It aint easy stopping that much weight behind ya either.....who knows what happened. Im surprised the pole didnt move an inch after being ramrodded by a full size pickup and a 20 somethin foot boat.  PS......if he wasnt drinkin yet, he had plans to by the amount of coolers in teh bed of the truck lol"
188618,edmichit,2008-04-17 12:56:00,145,"my guess is he didnt allow enough time for braking....the road looks damp and cool, no trailer brakes, crappy dodge front brake system. The boat pushed him straight into the pole. Or he nearly missed his right hand turn....tried to turn and got pushed into the pole."
188654,LeXXington,2008-04-17 14:44:00,1928,Is that the new Bayliner Cartopper model.
188661,Bernie,2008-04-17 15:07:00,3190,"I showed this to a guy at work here and he jokingly said ""why is he pulling the trailer if he loaded the boat on the truck?"""
188703,Casey123,2008-04-17 17:07:00,461,"You guys are all wrong.....  This is just a simple demonstration how to move your boat without a trailer.  I mean really, why go through the extra costs of having a trailer, license plates, maintance etc.  Just load your boat in the back of your truck and go.  To unload, simply back down the ramp at 40mph and slam on the brakes, problem solved.  One more dodge headed for the junk heap, one day we will mange to get them all off the road!"
188733,bbog,2008-04-17 17:54:00,665,Hope nobody was in the backseat
