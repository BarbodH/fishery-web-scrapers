While there we made a few drifts with 5' ultra lites. Talk about FUN super strong steelhead on perch rods! Perfect day, sunny no wind, found the fish in 32 fow. VERY Clear that day!     The lower has also had some clear water conditions lately. Here are some baits that have taken fish for us in ultra clear water conditions:    - small minnow - 4-to-8 egg rainbow bags in soft colours - plastic minnow 3-to-5"" - CC Streamers have been producing some HOGS! White/white pink -yarn flies - using smaller hooks, lighter line & longer leaders!      Check out some of the HOGS the Lower Niagara has been producing!      Niagara steelheading is just heating up! Go get'em!!!  See you on the River,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"
