188772,capt bruce,2008-04-17 19:07:00,820,"Ever heard of a creel or just a small cooler with some ice, not a real fan of stringers as fish that have been kept a few feet below the surface on a sunny day tend to get mushie from sitting in the warm water but they have been used for ever , I like to kill and clean small trout ,( take the head , gills and guts ), and chill right away even if its just in my wicker creel with some cool damp grass in it and something over it to keep out of the sun , but a stringer will work fine for a few hours , just try to keep it on the shady side of the boat ."
188865,solopaddler,2008-04-18 00:17:00,8605, Of course you're 100% right. Except when you're on a canoe trip and carrying everything on your back. Then the stringer is your best option. No problem here with fish getting mushy from warm sunny water. It's Algonquin Park in May...
188878,Casey123,2008-04-18 00:40:00,461,You have lots of good advicde here.  The only thing I may add is to reconsider the South Central Access off of 60 I am assuming. You would be much better served to hit one of the access points off of 17 between North Bay and Mattawa. Also you would be well served to take an extra day and penetrate the park a little further then 4 to 6 hours of paddling.
188929,Cookslav,2008-04-18 01:55:00,1457,"My two cents...  Perch pattern origional floating rapala, and take a few of them. If your casting structure your bound to loose one or two, seriously.... I've had tremendous success over the years on those lures in the Park. I'd also recomend a blue and silver rattle N rap, or Shad rap. They are Easy to use and very successful in the park for both Specks and Lakers. And if I might be so bold as to suggest you eat dinner at 4:30pm....your gonna want to be on the water at Twilight. Find granite drops....very steep drops, shoals, and shoreline structure with adjacent deeper water When that light starts to fade...cast and cast and cast.  When the day is slow, the twilight hour always seems to come on strong...but its only about an hour so be out there! Good luck."
189028,singingdog,2008-04-18 10:19:00,1047,"Your timing should be fine. The last 2 years we have had some of our best shallow-water laker fishing in late may on the southern edge of the Algonquin highland.  Be prepared to get skunked, even with great advice and good presentation. Trout fishing in that area can be incredibly fickle. There have been times that I have had a great couple of hours on a lake - 10 fish/hour - then it's like someone throws a switch and turns the fish off. The next few hours you can throw anything you want and your just exercising your arm.  Two presentations I haven't seen that work well: -fly/spoon combination: great for trolling, but tough to cast -Rocket Shad: the tiny, but heavy spinnerbait that Strike king makes. It's way better in structure than an inline, and both lakers and specks will hit them."
188165,Musky or Specks,2008-04-16 17:09:00,2710,"And how far north was that Ramble? We are talking about someone just starting out. And yes brook trout fishing can be good when the water temp warms up a bit because of aquatic insect activity. But that is only for Specks not lakers. Ive worked in the fishing industry for to long and have heard to many couldnt catch any stories to recognize a future one. Im one of those old timers you speak of I have been going to the park for 30 years now(since I was a teenager). Ive caught trout there at all times of the year that it is open, but with the right equipment. Im not saying he wont catch any fish but I am saying hes choosen a time that I wouldnt choose if I was sending a beginner party with no knowledge of what they are doing."
188210,solopaddler,2008-04-16 18:55:00,8605,"I've fished Algonquin for 25 years. Late May is absolutely enequivocally NOT too late for either specks or lakers. In fact I've found it to be far more consistent than the first 2 weeks after ice out. The lakes are completely turned over, still cool enough at the surface, and much more ""alive"" with many more insect hatches and minnows in the shallows... If you can stand the blackflies fishing will be prime. As far as lure choices go spoons like the #2 EGB, 1/4oz Cleos, Williams and Dardevels are good for specks. #2 spinners tipped with a worm are also good (I like copper coloured Blue Fox or EGB spinners if you can find them). I've also had huge success in the park with perch coloured stickbaits and crankbaits for both specks and lakers. Smaller sizes for the specks, larger for lakers. #5 to #9 deep diving Shad Raps work great, as well as Husky Jerks and floating Rap's. Most of the larger interior lakes, Dickson and Lavielle being prime examples, have large populations of perch and trout like to eat them. . 1/4 oz jigheads tipped with a white 3 or 4 inch twister tail have also been very productive for me for both species. The plus is you can work them in a wide variety of ways, very versatile. For specks concentrate on shoreline structure like large fallen trees, beaver huts, inflows and outflows. Windswept shorelines are also good to key on as well as obvious neckdowns and narrows, especially if they contain shoreline structure. Work it slowly and thoroughly. For lakers at that time of year I personally like to concentrate my efforts on mid lake shoals and humps. The park has depth maps of most of the larger more popular lakes and they seem to be pretty accurate. They're absolutely worth their weight in gold. If I'm not doing a huge amount of portaging I always bring in a tiny portable fishfinder to help in locating the mid lake structure. If you have a blue bird day and the fish are a bit deeper you can run your lighter spoons or stickbaits off a 3-way (Wolf River) rig, with a 3/4-11/2oz bell sinker on the dropper.  Have a fantastic trip bud and good luck!"
188218,Musky or Specks,2008-04-16 19:22:00,2710,Best of luck let us know how it works out
188219,Musky or Specks,2008-04-16 19:24:00,2710,Generally the farther you get from an access point the better the fishing is.
188226,Pachone,2008-04-16 19:33:00,276,"There will be a FULL REPORT when i return.....thanks for all the tips and keep em coming!  Im planning on bombing the areas where the cold wwater meets the warm, steep drop offs. strutures like logs and rocks, and ill play it by eye and ear. I might be a noob but i do ok in that section. I have a bunch of lures like white and chartruese twister tails with heavy coloured jigheads. Ive got xraps, shads, reefrunners, and huskyjerks. I am firm believer in perch coloured baits. I have some bright yo zuris. I use 20 lb powerline and 8lb mono. Shimano Stimula rods. Browning and shimano reels. Ill prolly pik one setup and bring 2 spools of line. Ive got a bunch of lil spinners and spoons plus these real cool lil tad fry lures, like a yellow wobbler crankbait worm, tadpole fry crankbait and baby bass crankbait. I think ill do ok...my fear has always been how to get my lures DEEP enough...especially with lighter and small lures. I have no experience with those bells or down rigging or anything... I can rig something up. Part of the reason i bought some deep husky jerks. THANKS FOR ALL HELP...KEEP EM COMING. taking notes...  ps. are the flies that bad??"
188232,solopaddler,2008-04-16 19:49:00,8605," When I mentioned bell sinkers in reference to the Wolf River rig here's a couple of sketches of the rig:    Nothing could be simpler and you can rig up this way with whatever tackle you've got. Obviously this is a rig designed primarily for trolling when using it in lakes. I'd recommend some kind of braid (I like 20lb Power Pro) as your main line on your reel. On average about 6' of 8lb mono to whatever lure you're using, and on the dropper the bell sinker is tied to 1-3' of slightly lighter mono. That way if your sinker snags that's all you lose...  (And yes the blackflies can be bad. Bring a headnet!  )"
188240,Pachone,2008-04-16 19:59:00,276,great tips!  How can I get a spinner to go deep by casting? let it sink then reel? becuase i wont necessary be trolling all the time.  is true that if u you try to put a lure deep it doesnt perform or act the same because of the water pressure? such as a crank bait or shad? this is where my inexperience kicks in LOL. really need to go with a pro sometime  im knowledge hungry beginner...
188244,solopaddler,2008-04-16 20:16:00,8605," A spinner? Cast it out, let it sink, and reel it back in. There's not too much more you can do. The French or Colorado style of blades will turn a lot easier than the longer thinner willoweleaf style. Mepps Aglia long and Rooster Tail are examples of the latter... Make sure to tip your spinner with half a nightcrawler, it makes a huge difference... All lures will perform exactly the same regardless of the depth. The only variable being if mono is used in deep water it tends to stretch a lot and you don't get the same sense of feel or instant response that braid offers."
188249,Pachone,2008-04-16 20:27:00,276, Thats what i thought... i appreciate all the help. Its going to make for a beauty report.  I plan on eating some of these fish...and dont want to go back to site after I catch just one. Probably 2 or 3 ...is there a way i can keep several fish fresh before i cook? without having em sit in the bottom of my canoe as i wait to catch another... i dont want to torture em fellas. Plus the flies...ring em through the gills with a chain or rope?
188254,solopaddler,2008-04-16 20:35:00,8605," Well that's simple, use a stringer. (Or as I like to call it, my ""Cronzy""  . I call my net and fillet knife Cronzy as well. As in ""Hurry up and pass me the Cronzy I've got a nice one on here!, we need a couple more to Cronzy up for shore lunch!!"""
188257,douG,2008-04-16 20:48:00,2693,"Check your regs before 'retaining' your fish, that's my advice.  Algonquin is zone 15.  Good luck, and all the advice you have received so far is very good.  There are a couple of secret lures, but if I told you..."
188260,Bob,2008-04-16 21:13:00,370,First couple of weeks after ice-out are usually slow here because the fish are still scattered all through the water column.  End of May you may find surface temps in the 60s but 3 feet down is a whole lot colder than that.  We catch lakers in the top 10 feet well into June most years and one of my best producers is a rainbow trout coloured rapala.  Our latitude isn't much different from Algonquin.  Tie some fabric softener sheets on your belt loops to keep the flies away.
