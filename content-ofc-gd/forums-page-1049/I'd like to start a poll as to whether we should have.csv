188064,Headhunter,2008-04-16 13:28:00,5703,"IMHO most of the steel headers don't deserve a separate section... unless it was chalk full of bargain bins selling new personalities! HH PS... now before you go nuts on me... I did say ""most""!"
188067,capt bruce,2008-04-16 13:36:00,820,"I think the STEEL guys are just experenceing STREAM RAGE . Its just like road rage coming from all the congestion on the highways instaed its creeks . PEOPLE just dont do well all close together we need our SPACE . why do you think moosebunks threads all get so many reads , WE ALL envy his being able to get away and enjoy the fredom of haveing a great deal of space between him and everyone else."
188072,Hookset,2008-04-16 13:40:00,367,"Can we play with names for this ""new"" steelhead section ?  Like ummm...  The ""disgruntled and grumpy tributaries angler"" section... or The ""keep 3 paces from me at all times on the river bank"" section... or The ""I'll kill you if you take a picture of this river"" section... maybe The"" there's mud on that Steelhead, lick it off !!!"" section... or The ""my centre pin and fishing vest are worth more than yours"" section or The ""look out my fish is wrapped around a pit bull and a shopping cart"" section or  ahhhh nevermind.   Hookset."
188092,solopaddler,2008-04-16 14:17:00,8605," Now that's funny!  How about the ""If I can touch you with my 15' rod you're too close!"" section?"
188107,Reef Runner,2008-04-16 14:32:00,981,"  Well said Capt Bruce.  Apart from steelheaders, which I comend for providing some good reads these long months, keep an eye on the board this summer as to whom starts pp-ing recreational boaters, weekend warriors and so forth.  We are gifted in having access to all the outdoor wonders Ontario has to offer, but when it comes to sharing that resource we are inclined to look at what has been taken away from our individual experience instead of the how we can appreciate our outdoors in the collective sense.  Institutions like conservation agencies, online forums and species specific angling clubs provide the opportunity for the exchange that is lacking in this sport beside the random comment ""any luck?""  The good outweighs the bad in most cases, but inherentily are inseperable.  reefrunner"
188112,kennyman,2008-04-16 14:49:00,737,"I've never caught a steelhead, but I'd like to learn how to do it right someday.BUT!  It has to be the hardest topic to research here because ""they"" give out so little information. I'm not worried I'll figure it out, but somehow a bunch of ""them"" think they're better than everyone else and that's just nonsense. Was there a special date that you had to become a steelheader by? Somehow if you got in by that date this entitles you to special powers and privelidges, like telling everyone else how to run their lives? How to report, post pics ? Unless it's your property I don't see what gives you the right.Is it an exclusive club, so anyone that comes after that specific date fends for themselves? That's not what a forum is for is it? Canadian Copper posted a beautiful report the other day. It was truly an incredible inspiring post . A post like that makes me want to go steelheading. Seeing all the rest of the nonsense associated with steelheading makes some here not want to even fish for steelhead so they don't get automatically grouped in with the whining ones. ""Steelheader"" is almost a bad name around here now and that shouldn't be. A few bad apples are spoiling it for everyone. It's a resource that everyone has the right to enjoy and no person has any more rights than another. Why does everyone have to abide by your rules? Why do fifty guys get to dictate what everyone else does.  You have to get elected usually before you get to screw us like that don't you? I'm sure some of the members of this group tell eachother where thay are fishing etc. don't they? Why should they have any control over the rest of us. There are no magical powers, only a mystique these few guys are trying to perpetuate so they can keep the fishery to themselves. I say everyone catch their fish, enjoy the fishery and have fun. Be respectful of the water,area you are fishing and the fish you're catching. But that's no different for anywhere no matter what you're catching, whether it's bass,muskie,pike ,walleye,perch,salmon or trout. These are all important fisheries. I know everyone has their preferences but we are all fishermen. We should try to get along, help eachother and maybe most importantly respect eachother's rights to share (or not) what we want about our experiences with others so they and their kids can enjoy this sport."
188224,Casey123,2008-04-16 19:30:00,461, What a novel Idea!!!!
188248,solopaddler,2008-04-16 20:22:00,8605, Said the pot to the kettle  .
188256,OhioFisherman,2008-04-16 20:45:00,6623, LOL Steve! Wait till we come for your water!  Note this thread was not started by a yanker on weak beer!  Salmon and Steelhead on the same board? Mix in a carp post? Just to keep em happy?
188259,OldPinner,2008-04-16 21:13:00,9, I think your onto something here Wayne.
188264,Gerritt,2008-04-16 21:24:00,6129,  The problem is it is other steelheaders doing the flaming OP. War of attrition?  G
188286,Cory,2008-04-16 21:55:00,170,If everyone just stopped posting there would be no problems....
188373,mistyriver1,2008-04-17 00:01:00,600,What about two sections ....Athletes and Non-athletes....  
188396,steve barrett,2008-04-17 00:24:00,142,
188413,Spiel,2008-04-17 00:41:00,9065," I'll be fishing brookies on opener, just like the past countless years. Me and a buddy and a small stream all to ourselves."
188516,Ben_Daniels,2008-04-17 02:52:00,435,"I think it gets confusing if there are too many sections....but I think a ""ragand Moan"" section would be good. On other messageboards I've seen having a section for this makes the fishing related sections better and with less crap. Every time someone posts something thats just complaining a moderator can just move it...seems to keep the forums cleaner and the people happier IMHO.  -Ben"
188547,camillj,2008-04-17 03:44:00,1988,I'd be up for that ... I fish for rainbows ... not steelhead and only in very well known (but rarely crowded) rivers and creeks  But I think we may also need a section for our Musky-ho's too ... even though that section doesnt get busy til later in the year ... cast vs troll ... myspot vs yours ... fillet vs steaks ... steam vs fishcrisp ... vertical vs gill grip  And we ABSOLUTELY need a section dedicated to brookies .. but only as long as Danc will promise to post lots of pictures .. even if from previous years
188617,ehg,2008-04-17 12:55:00,2666,"Over the last few years i always thought a moderater with a degree in psychology would be helpful around here at this time of year, to PM advice until most seasons re-open.  Usually on trout opener i'd break out small spinners to work the pools, but found going away from people and tossing Panther Martins for brookies in headwaters more relaxing. This year i'll try for crappies on lakes instead.  cheers,  ehg"
188623,BillM,2008-04-17 13:10:00,17367,I think I need to do some trout fishing this year.  Think my '8 muskie rod will work out ok?
188649,Casey123,2008-04-17 14:15:00,461,"  Only if you load up your reel with 80 lb braid, a steel leader and a lure with lots of large trebles...oh wait the salmon don't start running till september in the tribs."
188804,Photoz,2008-04-17 20:55:00,792,I think a section on proper steelhead landing nets & proper tail grabbing techniques would be VERY helpful? Many of us are not too well trained at this art?
188814,jonnybass,2008-04-17 21:21:00,346,I actually like the idea of having seperate sections! That's how it's done over at OFF and a couple of other fishing forums I visit.  I don't like having to sift through non-fishing threads to find the fishing discussions. I have other forums I go to for non-fishing chat... so when I come here I like to get to the good stuff right away.  My 2 cents.
187900,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-16 01:31:00,4399, good idea!  Not kidding!!
187922,tjsa,2008-04-16 02:10:00,1578, Ummmhhh..................wouldn't that negate 90% of your posts Wayne?????????????  :lol:
187929,jdmls,2008-04-16 02:19:00,575, I believe he means new contributing posts !!!
187931,Jason Vernooy,2008-04-16 02:22:00,25,Just add a rant section to the boards.....oops..not up to 20 posts yet. sorry lol
187945,Maverick,2008-04-16 02:32:00,371,I think it would be a good idea because unless you check back every 20 minutes you can easily lose a thread with all the new posts as the community grows.  General - Non-Fishing  - Fishing   Any takers??
187946,irishfield,2008-04-16 02:34:00,26272,Read the original post again Maverick.
187951,LundGuy,2008-04-16 02:37:00,169,"If both sections are popular then it won't matter, because the posts will go fast in both. It doesn't take much time or effort to click the mouse and scroll to find your favorite posts. If you click new posts you will get rid of anything old if you don't wish to follow them."
187952,Maverick,2008-04-16 02:38:00,371," Everyone was so off topic, I thought I would go along with them!"
187953,Bernie,2008-04-16 02:40:00,3190,I think part of what makes this board successful IS the fast activity. Because new posts and replys come fast you always (well almost always) have new stuff to read. Other boards have topics split up so bad it becomes boring so you just have a quick look and your gone. I love the way its set up here. There would be some minor changes I would do but is really quite good in my opinion. Even the Idiots make it fun to read.......Not talking about you Gerritt
187962,Greencoachdog,2008-04-16 02:55:00,8163,"  Well, I gotta agree with ya Wayne!... is there anyway we can have the Steelhead section posted on the camping latrine wall @ Lakair???"
187967,Greencoachdog,2008-04-16 02:59:00,8163,  Day-Yum!!!... dunno if I'd slam a latrine door that hard!!!... well done tom!  
187984,kennyman,2008-04-16 03:47:00,737,I vote to do whatever Wayne says.  Leave it as is.
187994,douG,2008-04-16 04:03:00,2693,I'm all for it.  Full speed ahead and dang the tuxedos.
188007,solopaddler,2008-04-16 08:26:00,8605, That's exactly what I meant.
188011,SlowPoke,2008-04-16 09:13:00,2984,Easy man! Import a bunch of boats and sell 'em on OFC!! I wouldn't restrict reply privlidges but I wouldn't mind seeing a minimum of 20 posts before posting in the classifieds. I also like the all-in-one feel of this board. I tend to stumble across threads I wouldn't normally seek out had they been in other categories. -Brian
188012,Terry,2008-04-16 09:30:00,14456,ok I thought this thread was a joke..humor........a funny comment on how steelhead threads go bad  but it seems many took it to be  something else..or I read it wrong
188014,Dano,2008-04-16 09:45:00,719,"I like it Wayne, but I would call them the indigenous species forum and the invasive species forum.  You got it right Terry....."
188023,Gerritt,2008-04-16 11:08:00,6129,  I just keep reminding myself you tease me because you like me......  G
188032,John,2008-04-16 12:01:00,2956, My take on it too. Apologies Wayne......
188033,pigeonfisher,2008-04-16 12:06:00,696,"where would we talk about beer?  If it was american beer, which is like water, it could go in the steelhead forum.  It creates the same amount of pissing!"
188035,JEREMY,2008-04-16 12:14:00,300,Well sais pigeonfisher.I am still laughing.
188036,BillM,2008-04-16 12:17:00,17367,An Off-Topic subsection not related to anything fishing would be a good idea.
188058,irishfield,2008-04-16 13:10:00,26272,LOL Steve !  and Yes Terry it was an attempt at humour (well sort of.. I'm actually kinda serious) to get the crew through 'till ice is out enough to get the rigs out up here.  I just find it odd that for the last month or more we've had daily joiners that do nothing but flame steehead posts. There's a message in there somewhere...
188059,Raf,2008-04-16 13:12:00,3495,steelheaders are flamers?
188063,kennyman,2008-04-16 13:19:00,737,"Where I went wrong was the original thread Wayne posted has a small line on the top and then far below (unlike the version above) the original thought where a signature usual is  he finishes his point. I ignored the bottom as if it were a signature and somehow filtered or disregarded it automatically. I guess you're so used to seeing signatures in that position and I'll read a persons once and then disregard it for a few days, sometimes checking to see if they've changed. Lately it's more the ""team"" logos, but before it was advertising alot of the time. You just subconciously tune them out. So after all that jibber jabber, what I'm saying is that maybe that's what alot of us here did. Or at least that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it."
187844,irishfield,2008-04-16 00:36:00,26272,"I know this comes up at least 5 times a year.... with someone suggesting such a thing..... But I'm thinking not seperate fishing and non fishing sections, But..      How about a seperate section for most everything and another section for steelheading threads !"
187846,John,2008-04-16 00:38:00,2956,Leah away tonight Wayne? Dang you must be bored bud........or......
187847,Sinker,2008-04-16 00:39:00,8692,You forgot to add the poll....
187848,irishfield,2008-04-16 00:40:00,26272,Just testing the waters first sinker....
187849,Gerritt,2008-04-16 00:40:00,6129,or give them their own board altogether! LOL joking joking  G
187851,tjsa,2008-04-16 00:41:00,1578,"I just hit the ""report"" icon about this thread,   :lol:  :lol:"
187852,John,2008-04-16 00:41:00,2956, Duck!
187853,kingjames_2nd,2008-04-16 00:42:00,72,"One of the things I like about this board is the fact that all the information I want to read is thown at me all at once and then I get to choose which I will read.  The down side is that information quickly gets washed away under  a flood of new posts.  I therefor am in favour of creating more sections.  However,  I dont think that a millionn different sections is efficeint either because then the user has to click a million times just to read what they would have in 1 click.  Perhaps dividing the information  by species or region would be benificial.  It seperates it a little but not too much."
187854,John,2008-04-16 00:44:00,2956, You must mean fishing and non-fishing sections.........great idea..
187856,irishfield,2008-04-16 00:47:00,26272,Hey.. this has nothing to do with fishing and no fishing sections John...
187859,John,2008-04-16 00:49:00,2956, Them's fightin' words Wayne...
187860,Terry,2008-04-16 00:49:00,14456,"well if you are going to have one for steelheading then you need one for OOS bass and one for vertical hold muskie  and of course one by itself for native fishing, netting and spearing, but it has to be setup to delete itself after every post  then the board is perfect"
187861,DanTheMan,2008-04-16 00:50:00,257,Dont forget the Tiller and Console forum also
187863,Gerritt,2008-04-16 00:50:00,6129,agreed... it has to do with Non-SteelHeading and SteelHeading...  G  too slow.....
187868,Casey123,2008-04-16 00:54:00,461,I think we would be better served with a seperate area for each of the following:  Definite A Holes  Sometimes an A Hole  Never an A Hole  and....  What is an A Hole    You can decide for yourself who will post where!  
187869,John,2008-04-16 00:54:00,2956,"You forgot the ""my outboard is better than yours forum""....."
187870,Gerritt,2008-04-16 00:55:00,6129,  Well I know where I would wind up.... first one!  G
187871,solopaddler,2008-04-16 00:55:00,8605,How about you have to have at least 20 or 30 posts before you can reply to a topic? That would quickly end most of the Bull.
187873,Spiel,2008-04-16 01:01:00,9065,"....How bout just two sections. This one and a new one called ""Waynes World""."
187876,Toronto_Angler,2008-04-16 01:02:00,698,It's all one section to me. I just click the new posts icon
