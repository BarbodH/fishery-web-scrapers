189178,Marko,2008-04-18 16:13:00,854,I think the pier is open all year around.
189181,fish_finder,2008-04-18 16:18:00,370,"yup, from hwy 2 to the lake is open.......but really only the pier is open.  Everything else closes last day of december."
189182,Musky or Specks,2008-04-18 16:19:00,2710,The regs are very confusing when it comes to Bronte. But no it is not open all year round.
189203,Fang,2008-04-18 17:03:00,1330,Open from Hwy 2 to the lake all year but after May 1st you can only fish from the boat launch to the lake. No fishing signs are posted through the marina portion. This is a city bylaw enforced by the little white clown cars.  I'm still looking for 100% clarification on the Hwy 2 north to rebacca street bridge In new regs the sanctuary reference is gone but last time I checked the signs where still posted above Hwy 2. I will check again soon.
189217,largemouth,2008-04-18 17:51:00,112,"it will take forever to remove the signs but the regs say different to the sign, maybe bring a copy of the regs when fishing thata rea...."
189223,Musky or Specks,2008-04-18 18:00:00,2710,Look in your regs. It says the regs are only a guide and not a legally binding document. If you want exact clarification youll have to call the local office.
