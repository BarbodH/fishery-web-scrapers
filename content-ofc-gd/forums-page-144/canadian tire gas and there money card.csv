The credit card I mentioned has no fee. And we pay it off every month. On top of that as I mentioned it earns me $250+ a year in free groceries. So essentially it is the same as your banking card you use to purchase your gas at Costco, except I earn  free stuff when I use it.  I don't see any down side to this at all."
949984,chris.brock,2015-12-20 21:10:00,4053,"The kicker is you have to pay it off every month. The interest rates are retarded. That's how they make money. Free stuff for me DeWalt table saw, 2 BBQs, vacuum, hunting blind........... etc"
949995,aplumma,2015-12-20 22:41:00,6896,"If you carry a 0 balance month to month you will not pay any interest. With careful shopping and a good credit score no fees is very possible from all of the major credit card companies. I can run 8-10 thousand thru my credit card from the business and personal purchases a month and reap the rewards from it. Using credit is not a crime it in fact is beneficial in this world we live in. The abuse of credit can ruin your life quickly though. When you are making a major purchase IE a car,boat or house the stronger your credit is the cheaper the rate is to borrow money. This in itself can save you more than most credit card give backs you can find.   Art  "
949999,Raf,2015-12-20 22:47:00,3495,like chris and art said paying off your card month to month is key -- never pay interest  sometimes the fee based cards make more sense than the free ones if you spend enough to reap the rewards and cover the annual fee.

950049,G.mech,2015-12-21 16:04:00,830,"There is one down side to credit cards; that is that the banks are making a killing off them even if you pay down your balance every month.  The banks charge retailers between 1.5-3% of every purchase and although you won't see it on your bill, it is tacked on the price of the products in the stores.  They offer you points and rewards so you keep filling their pockets without you seeing it.  Hypothetically, if everyone stopped using cards and retailers actually passed along the savings, you would be far better off in the long run and the banks record profits may take a minor hit but we all know this will never happen."

You're right in a way.  Somebody in the food chain is paying for these reward programs, likely the card user that carries a monthly balance.  If you're using reward cards and not carrying a balance then YOU are money up at the end of the year.  Not using them won't discourage the companies that offer them but the retailers like you because they pay a % of the purchase everytime you use the card.  Do the Retailers offer a discount for cash payment???? Not many do."

Most of these cards can be used in any store.  E.g. Cdn Tire Options and Gas Advantage are MasterCards and can be used anywhere MasterCard is accepted.  This seems to be the trend with most store cards now.  You usually get some better benefits when used at the 'host' store; but almost any card can be used at almost any store.  I agree that you don't want to get too carried away with all of the different reward cards.  It is usually better to pick one or two that you like best and stick to them.

I have never bought into using a credit card for anything or a points card. I tried but would loose the tag for Pioneer and just go where gas was cheapest.  I was taught old school, cash only and  when I did years ago use Visa I got myself in trouble after my divorce, it's easy to do. My wife has always used her Shoppers Optimum points since it came out since she is employed there. She gets big points for signing people up and it's her job. A good deal.  Since being bought out by Loblaws the card can be used at the grocery stores like Zehrs now. I am a believer now as a month or so ago she showed me a dozen bags of food and dry goods and said she cashed out and the total load was around 30 bucks, wow.  I'm not going to feel guilty that I get all of our gas at the Rez for around 15 cents less per lt. than town which is always 4 or more cents more than Hamilton, should I? Supply and demand rip off. rural always pays more for everything. But I have bought into this points thing. Now all I need to do is go shopping."

So if you load your weekly deals and keep an eye on things you can get a good return like ours that was basically 7% yesterday. It's looking like we will get closer to $400 this year on our card which translates to about 3-4 weeks worth of free groceries.
