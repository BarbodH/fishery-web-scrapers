950784,NAW,2015-12-27 04:35:00,4022,"I'll be iceishing in Ontario Monday or Tuesday at the latest.  I am definitely going to have a look!  Not sure how far I will need to drive though..  The spot I am eager to check has the next three nights at or close to minus double digits, and bellow zero all day.  It's worth strapping on the float suite and going for a poke!"

950864,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-27 20:32:00,8243,"Might as well put a zero on the end of-36, feels like -46C COMEON MAN!! I won't be braving -10 unless I have to leave the comforts of my place sometime in the future, last year anyway. No way, no how. But I'm told it's a dry cold!, Yea right. Like 101F is a dry heat in Arizona, it's too hot to breath."
950870,Sinker,2015-12-27 21:24:00,8692,"Maybe, but thats one hell of a drive!! 20 hours....."

951067,Dara,2015-12-29 15:13:00,3052,Hey John  your message box doesn't work and I could use some fishing directions..I just may head up there the end of january
951068,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-29 15:43:00,2582,"Yea right. Like 101F is a dry heat in Arizona, it's too hot to breath. One year in Vegas we did a bus tour to Laughlin for a day and it got up to 112F. As soon as you walked out of the Casino that wall of heat just hits you. Then  you walk around a bit and you realize your not even sweating. That dry heat is awesome. I would take 112F down there 7 days a week before I'd do 20 minutes outside in my veggie garden here in the summer with anything sunny and over 80F."
