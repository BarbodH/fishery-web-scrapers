He does not have the registration for either, but will provide a bill of sale for each.  The boat has a VIN and reg. plate on it, and the trailer has a serial number and stickers on it.I understand that I could register the trailer as homemade, but it is in good shape and has the stickers on it, so I'd rather not grind and paint it, and ... that's not the most honest thing to do.  I have a 15 hp that I would put on it, and as such need to register the vessel to me and get numbers to put on it.I'd like everything to ""check out"" when stopped by the police on the road or water.  So, if I trust it is not stolen and I don't believe that it is, .... How do I register both to make them ready for the spring.TIA  Entropy"
