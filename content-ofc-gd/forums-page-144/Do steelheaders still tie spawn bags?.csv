I fished with Dick, and John Slade, on the Saugeen one day back in the '80s.  John was something of a legend in his own right, but here he was, just hanging off every word that Dick spoke.  Afterwards, John said to me, ""That guy is the father of salmon fishing.""  By which he meant Great Lakes salmon of course.  In those years, Dick would attend the Toronto Sportsmen's Show for at least a few days (maybe the whole time?) and talk to anybody that wanted to listen about noodle rods for salmon and trout.  What a gentleman he was!  And yeah, his rods would sure make that Big C....................  Doug"

My 1st 13 was a premier Loomis and then the IM6.  After that 11-5 IMX I fished for years then broke 8 inches off top. It was the last rod I wrapped. Had Rolly redo and re position the guides, still a great stick.  Now I have a 13 and 11:5 St Crox Wild River. Very serviceable sticks.  So the Lami and the Sage are the only ones not in service today after 40 years. And I could fix the Sage."
950616,akaShag,2015-12-25 16:45:00,2073,"Once upon a time, long ago, I was a devoted steelheader.  This time of the year I would be up to my jewels in some half-frozen river or river-mouth, trying to find some fresh silver.  Then I took up bow-hunting.  Then I had three sons, and a very busy career.  Then I got older and have a creaky back, knocky knees, etc, and wading the fall waters are probably in my rear view mirror.  So I was making some space in the basement for ""stuff"" and found a box of my old steelhead stuff, including a bunch of yarn, roe bag mesh, one of those roe bag tiers, etc etc.  Does anybody still use this stuff?  Somewhere I know I have about a thousand Eagle Claw #42 hooks, sizes 6 through 12 or maybe smaller, some Mustad 9555s (If memory serves me), floats, split shot, etc etc.  Same question, do steelheaders still tie on hooks, or has the sport metastasized into something I would not recognize if I slipped on my old vest and waders ?Just curious.  Stuff like this keeps older men awake at night.  Doug  "
