951192,Locnar,2015-12-30 21:12:00,645,Nice man! A lot more luck that I had when I was down there at the end of November. All that was caught was a ton of bonito and a couple big needlefish. We did have one tuna (or believed to be) peel out a ton of line just to have not taken the hook. I'd love to catch a sailfish.
