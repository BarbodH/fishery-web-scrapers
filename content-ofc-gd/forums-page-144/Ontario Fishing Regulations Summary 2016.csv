950729,Fish Farmer,2015-12-26 15:14:00,2234,You'd think they would post use and go by last years reg's. They want to cut back. come up with a 2 or 3 year reg's
950738,ecmilley,2015-12-26 17:18:00,2163,"renewed my fiskin licence today, and the tackle store had two boxes of paper regs, so now have some new reading material. not that i didnt know which lake i was gonna target lakers in tomorrow anyway"
950770,wormdunker,2015-12-26 22:56:00,1711,I'd like a paper copy.  Non available where I shop.
950773,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-27 01:33:00,8243,When they get their box at Home hardware here I'll grab you one Brian. If they are in soon I may be able to 'bring one with me to Hamilton. I'll grab a few.
950861,MJIG,2015-12-27 20:13:00,227,http://www.ontario.ca/document/ontario-fishing-regulations-summary  i think in the past there was a notice of any changes...did any happen this year or am i missing something?   It looks like changes are highlighted in red text. Here's an excerpt from the ZONE 17 exceptions which highlights the all-year closed Walleye season in red.  
950943,wormdunker,2015-12-28 11:01:00,1711,"Woo Hoo!  I secured 2 hard copies for 2016!  I was in CTC Welland today, asked at the customer service desk for a copy.  Her reply was they don't usually get them till about April??  I went to the sporting goods counter. - Guess what?  A box of the regs."
950117,GBW,2015-12-22 00:59:00,8460,I had to find it from the 2015 page so with luck this works right... http://www.ontario.ca/document/ontario-fishing-regulations-summary
950119,Fisherman,2015-12-22 01:01:00,7201,That's the whole kit and caboodle.  Looking for something specific?
950141,GBW,2015-12-22 03:42:00,8460,
950147,Pigeontroller,2015-12-22 04:16:00,2793,Should be a short test required to get your fishing license...And everyone gets a paper copy...Just my opinion.
950149,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-22 04:31:00,8243,"I vote for real Boating test. I don't support a fishing test. I fish in primarily 1 zone. Should I know the slot limit for a zone I will never fish in. If I do go outside my main area then it's up to me to brush up on that zones regs, otherwise I don't need to know."
950187,DanD,2015-12-22 12:46:00,2223,"When I'm in an area that is new to me, I put a memo in my phone with the slot sizes and limits. Before the phone I'd type out the regs for an area or take the page(s) from the summery that I need; have them laminated and tossed in the boat.  Dan."

950191,Dara,2015-12-22 13:20:00,3052,What kind of test Pigeontroller.  What is important enough to you that we would have to sit through an exam to go fishing
950196,DanD,2015-12-22 13:54:00,2223,   why not just toss the whole book in your boat?  that way you never have to worry about forgetting to bring it with you  Do you know how long paper lasts in an open boat. LOL  Dan.
950224,Beans,2015-12-22 17:33:00,3339,Thanks for posting this...I noticed that they changed their minds about making us seniors (65+)buy a license...
950225,SirCranksalot,2015-12-22 17:37:00,3291,I think it would be a good idea to pin the regs to the top of the board---maybe in the 'extra resources' section.
950236,AKRISONER,2015-12-22 19:12:00,5558,i think in the past there was a notice of any changes...did any happen this year or am i missing something?
950243,Locnar,2015-12-22 19:41:00,645,"Crazy, Atlantic Salmons are open for catch and release?"
950273,Loonietoon,2015-12-22 23:32:00,1450,Thanks for posting this...I noticed that they changed their minds about making us seniors (65+)buy a license... Norm I guess they figure better leave well enough alone
950277,Freshtrax,2015-12-22 23:55:00,2215,Lol like someone's gonna go target them in zone 20 .   Don't get me started.
950278,GBW,2015-12-22 23:58:00,8460," I only shared it because in the past people have posted things like ""anyone have the new reg's because..."" so there it is."
950285,Fisherman,2015-12-23 01:04:00,7201,"That all depends on where you are. This is why I tried to be helpful and post the whole thing. Some areas don't change but this way you can now look at it to confirm.  I only shared it because in the past people have posted things like ""anyone have the new reg's because..."" so there it is. Wasn't mad at ya, just thought you had something in particular."

950293,Pigeontroller,2015-12-23 02:32:00,2793,"Many anglers are completely ignorant of seasons, species, and don't know how to interpret the regs. An example is the exceptions and how often anglers do not realize they have to check them for the FMZ they are fishing in. You have to pass a test to hunt Turkey's, are they more important than Steelhead? Muskie? Walleye?"
950294,GBW,2015-12-23 02:36:00,8460,
950295,Sinker,2015-12-23 02:42:00,8692,I have never pulled out the shotgun or bow to go fishing.....apples to oranges.   A test to fish? Riiiiiiiight!!  Next will be a test on musky release and proper tools to fish musky??? LOL  Thanks for sharing the regs....  S.
950327,Dara,2015-12-23 13:54:00,3052,"Many anglers are completely ignorant of seasons, species, and don't know how to interpret the regs.

You have to pass a test to hunt Turkey's, are they more important than Steelhead? Muskie? Walleye? Those type of anglers really don't hurt anything. They never catch Muskie or steelheads They will be targeting sunfish from a dock with the kids or netting during a pink salmon run.  No need to burden us all with a test for something like them"
950336,BillM,2015-12-23 16:28:00,17367,"Even guys that call themselves fisherman can't figure out the exceptions, how many threads have we had on here about that?  lol!     I usually have a PDF copy of all the zones I'm fishing on my phone, makes it easy (Although for the 4-5 zones I fish I've got them memorized (Not like I'm keeping a lot of fish anyhow)"
950341,Dara,2015-12-23 17:37:00,3052,whats a zone...I thought they were districts
950721,Mister G,2015-12-26 14:17:00,1429,"I figure since I no longer bother to purchase a license, why bother with silly restrictions they keep coming up with. Catch a fish, eat the fish.......can't get simpler then that."
