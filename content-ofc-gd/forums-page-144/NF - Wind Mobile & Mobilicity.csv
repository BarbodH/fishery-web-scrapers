950964,John Bacon,2015-12-28 17:16:00,3277,Is anybody here with Wind Mobile?  Is there service in the GTA any good?  I know that they are not going to provide the same coverage as Bell or Rogers; but they are a lot cheaper.  Do they at least provide decent service in the GTA?  Is there anything that I should know before signing up with them?  They advertise their plans as unlimited data but provide a figure (e.g. 2gb full speed allotment).  I assume that this means they do not charge extra for data usage but they will slow the service down after I reach 2 giga bytes.  Can anyone confirm this?   Thanks.

He was with them to save a few bucks and he said it was fine in Oshawa and the GTA but that was it. He got rid of it because he found it unreliable.  This was 2-3 years ago. Don't know how it is now.
