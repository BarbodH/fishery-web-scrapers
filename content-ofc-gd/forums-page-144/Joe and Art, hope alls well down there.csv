951276,dave524,2015-12-31 11:48:00,4508,"Glad you are well, England and Wales seems to be getting much of the same, videos of 200 year old pubs being washed away, places being hit there that are not traditionally prone to flooding."

When I view our local news & I see houses floating in Mississippi - it's frightening what those people are going through.  Does insurance cover flood damage in your part of the country?  You have to be careful when purchasing an insurance policy, most require an optional plan to cover flooding.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_insurance  Some years ago, in the 70's or 80's I think? They closed some towns along the Mississippi river because they kept flooding.  http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/look-back/look-back-great-flood-of-overwhelms-record-set-years-earlier/article_7872a8fe-bdf6-5aef-9991-7f0d827cbcc1.html  Actually it was 1993.  Even in my general area there are some areas that are flood prone, mostly in river valleys. Beautiful areas as long as there are no floods. People seem to be content to lose everything and rebuild there."

Whats happening over there is very sad. Like you said, 200 year old buildings ruined."
