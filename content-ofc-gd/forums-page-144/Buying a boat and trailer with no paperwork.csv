950772,wask,2015-12-26 23:31:00,174,This is a project boat so it's unlikely it's stolen or anything.  Is it possible to get new title and registration with bill of sale?  Thanks!

Had to take photos of the serial #s on the hull and engine as well as coloured pics of the boat. to prove the description of it. Showed those photos to our Lawyer and got an notarized affidavit   from him confirming that. And sent it back after making copies, sent to New Brunswick if I remember. Received all the paper work in a week.  Registered the trailer with On. MOT. They didn't ask for proof of anything and issued a new ownership and new plate."
