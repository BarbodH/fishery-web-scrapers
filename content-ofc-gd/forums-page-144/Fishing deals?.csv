950985,KraTToR,2015-12-28 20:58:00,506,Has anyone dealt with Wholesale SPorts out of western canada?  They have a pretty decent sale on now.  One thing that caught my eye is the Abu MGX for $288. Its at Sail right now for $379 less 15% plus tax.  I believe there may be not sale tax applied when buying from wholesale as they don't have a presence in the democratic republic of Ontario...  
950987,misfish,2015-12-28 21:14:00,29133,Have you asked about price matching?

951006,Consigliere,2015-12-29 00:34:00,121,Bought a few things there. Good experience. Can't remember about tax.
951023,67ZL1,2015-12-29 02:16:00,51,Just deal with one of the stores in Alberta and pay GST only.
951042,Weeds,2015-12-29 11:14:00,782,I bought a few items from them a few years back and was pleased. I think tax was a lot less but can't remember for certain.

951061,Steve,2015-12-29 14:22:00,2075,"guilty.  although became one later in the game. Saw Jerry when I was 13 here in Hamilton (1992).  been a big fan ever since.  I remember reading someone on this very board complaining because his wife wanted to see the Grateful Dead reunion in Chi town this summer but he wanted to go sheephead fishing instead, lol.  :)"

951070,KraTToR,2015-12-29 16:04:00,506,Just deal with one of the stores in Alberta and pay GST only.  Thanks!  Finally a useful reply...
951082,bare foot wader,2015-12-29 18:51:00,1354,"Just deal with one of the stores in Alberta and pay GST only.  They will direct you to order from their website, and you will be billed your home tax rate when you enter your address  I shop a lot of WSS, in store they are like any other big box store...online is generally good, but have had some slow processing frustration before, and their online inventory is not always accurate"
951111,Weeds,2015-12-30 00:47:00,782,There's a customer service number on the site. Why not just call them and ask?
951137,buick14,2015-12-30 13:18:00,741,Le baron has it for $294
951146,wkrp,2015-12-30 14:37:00,656,My apologies KraTTor.
951241,67ZL1,2015-12-31 00:58:00,51,"WSS opened a new store in South Edmonton that is really set up nice, almost like a Cabela's. It wouldn't hurt to call one of the larger stores and ask them. Everyone's hurting in Alberta right now and they'd be a fool not to sell to you."
951412,206,2016-01-01 15:56:00,563,Well did ya pull the trigger and what was the total bill?
