(Fills the need) My number 1 choice in BC is Black Tusk. Had it in the airport the first time, best as a draft, but comes in a 500ml bottle too. Not cheap, but well worth it, IMO. (Available at Provincial Liquor stores) Yeungling Dark is excellent, as is Killians Red, in the US. But my Favourite US beer, draft or bottle is Michelob Amberbock. $13 for a dozen at Tops in NY or Publix in Florida. (A couple of my favourite seafood restaurants down here in Florida have it on tap) Every trip to the US (at least twice a week), a dozen come home with me. Never a hassle at the border."
