951046,skeeter99,2015-12-29 12:12:00,109,"looking for a aluminum boat with trailer and motor  this will be used for duck hunting only as I have a bass boat already  question   what is a 14 foot sylvan boat with trailer and 20 hp worth, it is my friends boat and he has used it for years with no issues  the boat is 20 years old (don't leak) 14 ft motor is mid 80's  (runs great) trailer is good"
951047,skeeter99,2015-12-29 12:13:00,109,the boat is 14ft
951053,porkpie,2015-12-29 13:25:00,2521,"Right now, $1700.  In the spring, $2200.  That's based on age and stated good condition.  If it where a newer 14, with a newer motor you'd be in the neighbourhood of $3500. My thoughts anyway."
951057,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-29 13:49:00,8243,"Depending on any accessories that's about right. The 20 and tank has to be worth $1200.00 alone, the boat is $500.00 and the trailers are basically going for nada. A buddy paid 500 for a 15' Lund tinny for Duck hunting from a camp rental last year, no leaks. Guys are giving away old glass boats with  40HP anchors on them with trailers so they don't have to pay by the kilo to scrap them at the dump. No one wants the old smallish glass boats with a seized motor."
