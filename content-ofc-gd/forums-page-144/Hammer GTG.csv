950287,bigugli,2015-12-23 01:31:00,6138,Won't be making it this year Kelvin. Lots of family to contend with from the 24th to the 28th. Then there's those precious little grandbabies to oooh and aaah over.

950292,wormdunker,2015-12-23 02:20:00,1711,Don't keep me in suspense!  What does it mean?
950296,manitoubass2,2015-12-23 02:53:00,11391,Daisk. Sausage party ???

950305,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-23 05:11:00,8243,"Kelvin. The back is to me the worse injury. If you move a toe the back hurts, blink an eye the back hurts. And don;t get me going about WSIB. A 500 pound blowpipe slipped from a chainfall and I caught the weight of it against a hot section of penstock. A few yrs latter it resulted in 3 disc herniation's developed over time but I never took an hour off when it happened, light duties in street cloths for 4 weeks, the claim was denied because I didn't need hospitalization and never took time off. They deny every old claim and I should have fought it but didn't. Everyone I went to see said it was going to be a tough fight.  Good for you for sticking to it, but it is shameful you have to. Knowing the system I documented everything and kept copies of everything. It didn't matter. We will talk on Boxing Day if you want.  Hey Mr. Wormdrowner, I never even thought of the Limo, but I gave Wrongway Dave the holidays off and the Helicopter is in for service. I am going to my absolute best to make it. If I'm not up to the drive back there are a few places I know have a room for me if I cook them Brunch the next day, I have it covered."
950356,HTHM,2015-12-23 18:39:00,4082,"I won't be able to make it, family party that day. I mis-read the date"
950357,manitoubass2,2015-12-23 19:04:00,11391,Lol.
950371,Spiel,2015-12-23 20:23:00,9065,"Not sure that date and time is going to work for me, sadly. I'm not out but I'm not sure I'm in either......."
950385,Loonietoon,2015-12-23 21:36:00,1450,Looks like a cancelation then.... no go
950396,wormdunker,2015-12-23 23:14:00,1711,Sorry about the news Loonie.  At least you gave it a good effort.  Thanx for your work.
950411,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-24 00:31:00,8243,Are we still on for lunch after New Years Wormkiller? Lunch is great for me.
950413,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-24 00:33:00,8243,Guys what about after New Years for lunch? It's tough around the holidays for sure.
950418,wormdunker,2015-12-24 00:42:00,1711,Yup.  As long as you're buying!
950427,Loonietoon,2015-12-24 02:06:00,1450,Guys what about after New Years for lunch? It's tough around the holidays for sure. I have no problem with that as long as we have others for sure??
950432,ckewley,2015-12-24 02:46:00,699,"Sorry for not responding earlier but I'd like a GTG to meet some of the folks here, the 26th would have been hard pressed but a after new years is possible for sure."
950452,Spiel,2015-12-24 13:50:00,9065,Guys what about after New Years for lunch? It's tough around the holidays for sure.  I could likely do that and almost certain I could get Fish Farmer to come as well.
950668,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-26 01:24:00,8243,"Loonietoon, you will come as long as it isn't just me there? My feelings are bruised.  I was thinking a Saturday would be good that way some of the guys that are still working can make it. How about Saturday January 9th at 1 PM at Wild Wings on Centennial Parkway?  For anyone outside of Hamilton it is just off the QEW, the Linc and the Redhill Parkway and is very accessible from TO and Niagara. Mr. Wormdrowner is buying first and last rounds!!! He makes big money traipsing around Canada on the big paying jobs!"
950671,Loonietoon,2015-12-26 01:46:00,1450,"Loonietoon, you will come as long as it isn't just me there? My feelings are bruised.   No that is not the way it is, I do not hurt any bodys feelings, its just people say they are going to show and they dont. Last year there were only 5 out of how many that said they were. The one year before Albert setup a resurvation at a bar and only Albert and myself showed up so with people dropping out I selected to cancel it out. If people want to make a date and Place, Im all in."
950676,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-26 02:28:00,8243,"My feelings weren't hurt, I don't have any. I was one that was a no show last year. Life gets in the way of leisure time the older we get it seems. So how is that Saturday Jan 9 for you?  Planning anything you just have to make a date and run with it. I hope a few can make it. I am going to start a new thread for it."

950085,Loonietoon,2015-12-21 22:14:00,1450,Any one interested in a GTG in the Hammer between Christmas and New years ... Why is it always me asking this Question????  :santa:  Please name a location and day prefered
950092,Roy,2015-12-21 22:31:00,13728,I'd love to go but I'm just too far away for a one nighter. I'm sure you'll get a good turnout.

950105,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-21 23:17:00,8243,"Unless it's during the day I can't make it. I just drove from Hamilton in the driving rain that took me an hour and I have a head pounder. All I see now is glare and dark. I am going to see if I can get a pair of those amber glasses the guys on the Docks wore for glare hauling ore and coal. Night blindness sucks, nothing new for me. Let me know lunch or latter. Wormdunker said he would come in from Fonthill if there was a GTG. Maybe I can Skype the GTG?  No dead guy jokes, one funeral per lifetime is max, eh HTHM?"
950107,lew,2015-12-21 23:27:00,12766,We used to do alot of G2G's around here years ago  but sadly they just seemed to stop so it's good to see you trying to organize something again Kelvin.  If I was 100 miles closer I'd be there for sure.
950108,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-21 23:34:00,8243,"Come on Big Lew, I used to drive to Burleigh Falls for the day and drive back with time to spare to hit a few Ballets on the way home.  That was 30 winters ago though."

950114,misfish,2015-12-21 23:44:00,29133,"I would do a brunch.  I am working the 28,29,30.  I always made the ice fishing ones, well all but one. LOL"

950146,HTHM,2015-12-22 04:04:00,4082,"Just name the time and place, and those that can make it will, those who cannot won't."
950148,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-22 04:20:00,8243,"Exactly Albert, can't make everyone happy, you can make it or you can't. Kelvin YOU name the date/time/place, then let the folks decide if they can make it. I think you guys went to  Wild  Wings on 20 last year, everyone seemed to like the place. Just a suggestion I have never been myself."
950167,lew,2015-12-22 09:36:00,12766,"Come on Big Lew, I used to drive to Burleigh Falls for the day and drive back with time to spare to hit a few Ballets on the way home.  That was 30 winters ago though.  It'll be a good night for sure but my days of driving through the insane Toronto traffic are done. It would be bad enough fighting it once but then to turn around a few hours later and do it all over again is just too much to handle.  I've only been back to that crazy place once since moving to the boonies 6 years ago and hopefully it's the last I'll see of it.  I see about 4 cars a day now and that suits me just fine"
950171,wormdunker,2015-12-22 11:17:00,1711,"Hey Lew - You have it all where you're living!  The great out doors!  Loonie - Count me in for the GTG, I'm flexible.  I just returned from a job in White River yesterday.  I don't have too much on my agenda at this point.  ""Old reptile""  (I mean Ironmaker) has a good suggestion Wild Wings for a bunch of Wacko fishermen sounds good!  I was in Orillia for the perch festival last year - Wild Wings in Orillia was very good!!"

950231,Loonietoon,2015-12-22 18:51:00,1450,Looks like only 3 or 4 so far... Where is Fishfarmer??? and Bruce... there has to be more in the area that want GTG for a while and have a little fun... Christmas cool down so to say
950233,lew,2015-12-22 18:56:00,12766,"Hey Kelvin, bring your G2G to the Kawarthas and then I'll be able to join you guys without having to drive thru Toronto"
950238,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-22 19:25:00,8243,7:30 PM is a killer for me. But there's always a solution. Maybe someone can swing by here and pick me up. It's only an hour from Hammerton.
950245,Loonietoon,2015-12-22 20:09:00,1450,"Hey Kelvin, bring your G2G to the Kawarthas and then I'll be able to join you guys without having to drive thru Toronto If I come up there Lew you are going to have to teach me Muskie Fishing"

950269,Loonietoon,2015-12-22 23:20:00,1450, Sounds like a good trade off to me Kelvin I would if I could Lew.. Fishing with you would be a HONOR my friend
950274,lew,2015-12-22 23:36:00,12766,"Yup, it'd be good times Kelvin, but if we ever decide to make it happen you'll have to meet me up on Nipissing as that's the only place I fish anymore."
