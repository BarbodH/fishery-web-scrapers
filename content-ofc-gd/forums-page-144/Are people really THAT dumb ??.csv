And we wonder why manufacturing is going to Mexico and Asia?"

We all heard the one about the lady suing McDonalds for big money because she spilled hot coffee on herself. I recently watched a documentary about it. She needed skin grafts on her legs, it was bad. how about the person the won against Winebego cause she put it on cruise control then went to the back to make a sandwich and it crashed"
951016,John Bacon,2015-12-29 01:39:00,3277,how about the person the won against Winebego cause she put it on cruise control then went to the back to make a sandwich and it crashed  I don't think that one is true.

950641,lew,2015-12-25 19:45:00,12766,"We've all seen the strange warning labels on things we buy and shake our heads  wondering who would be foolish enough to do what they're telling us not to.  Don't injest the paint, don't use the hair dryer in the shower, even my wheel barrow tire has a warning not to use at hiway speed.  Today for Christmas my wife bought me a clock in the shape of a saw blade for the shop and I honestly can't believe the warning on the back of the box.  Is anyone really dumb enough to try and use these blades on their circ or table saw ??    "
950646,wask,2015-12-25 19:59:00,174,Hahaha.  Sadly... yes.  Someone thought they would just use it in a pinch and probably lost a body part.

950653,Fisherpete,2015-12-25 20:48:00,1814,"Yeah sadly if the manufacturer didn't put that on there, someone would see $$$$$ and try using it just to launch a lawsuit... pretty sad. Even a cup of coffee these days has a ""warning : hot liquid"" on it... good thing, because I may have been SOOOO tempted to pour it on my lap...  LOL"

950665,glen,2015-12-26 01:00:00,2641,I wouldn't use the saw blade because I don't have a saw.   But that blue hammer looks like it would be good.

She needed skin grafts on her legs, it was bad.  McDonald's screwed themselves on that one. The family was looking for coverage for medical bills. McD's kept their coffee at near boiling temps so it had a longer ""shelf-life"". The judge found for the family to cover the medical bill but punished McD's arrogance by also awarding the family some small percent of 1 day's worth of coffee sales which amounted to the millions of dollars."

Scares me to think of todays teens working around all that machinery that didn't have protective guards on rotating shafts or any pinch points. Products of the increasing nanny state and helicopter parenting I guess and it's only getting worse."
