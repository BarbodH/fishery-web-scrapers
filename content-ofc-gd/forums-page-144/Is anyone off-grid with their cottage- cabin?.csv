So I'm trying to piece it back together or find the most cost effective way to get power.  We don't need a lot, but we do need a fridge and would like some hot water as well obviously.  I've looked at the propane options and it seems that might be the best way to go since those would be the biggest power drains and then piece together a smaller solar system to power lights and the water pump from the lake.  I've also put in a request to see how much running hydro in form the road will cost but I expect that isn't going to be cheap.  Thoughts?  Opinions?  Experience?  Thanks  Wask"

You would need a massive set up to run your stove and fridge in solar, but definitely look into it for lighting.  It's a lot nicer than having a genny running just for a couple lights."

Power set up is going to be solar with generator backup.  I'm sizing my solar system so the generator will only be needed in the winter due to lack of daylight. From March to November I should be able to run solar only. I have enough equipment to run a small system until I can budget my large system @ the cabin. My heavy draw devices will be my microwave and espresso machine. My water pump is going to be a 24 volt RV pump t hat will draw water from a large tank under the cabin. For filling the tank I will be using a gas powered pump. Typical 120 volt shallow well jet pumps use quite a bit of juice compared to the RV pumps so you would need a larger solar setup to run it.  Look at these guys for solar. Good pricing on everything needed. http://www.wholesalesolar.com/complete-systems  For lighting go with LED bulbs to save energy.

It is expensive to get the service in initially, then it's a lifetime contract with Hydro One and you are at their mercy with delivery charges and rate changes etc. Being off the grid you can control some of your expenses."

Propane lights, fridge and heater and stove plus a wood burning stove to help warm it up fast in the winter. Got water from the lake with a bucket for dishes and showers, brought our own for drinking. Had a shower curtain rigged up at the back porch door. Climbed a ladder to mostly fill a 5 gallon bucket with water then topped up with a big kettle of boiling water from the stove. It would do for 2 seperate quickie showers or one nice long shower. Styrofoam  under your feet to stand on if it was winter out. During summer we did 90% of our evening meals on a grate over a fire in a nice bricked pit my dad made. Really miss the flavour of cooking over a fire and the  timing involved to get it just right with everything ready at the same time.  Propane was off when we where not there, so when you showed up it would take a solid day in the summer  for the fridge to really cool down before it kept things cold  enough. So we had a huge plastic tub that was filled with water and frozen in the big freezer at home. It would last almost a whole week in the fridge at the cottage so if we went up for only a weekend we never turned the propane on for the fridge at all, just threw the big tub of ice in the bottom. It was a lot nicer then digging your stuff out of a packed cooler all the time.  With todays technology and more options like solar and the use of generators if I had a small place and it was a viable option I would be off grid for sure."
