Doesn't really seem like Christmas with the warm weather and no snow but what the heck, it's still a great time of the year.  Have fun folks and hopefully Santa's good to everyone.  We had our big annual Christmas party here at the house on the 12th and tomorrow we'll be staying home  with company coming here but what's everybody else doing ??    "
950447,Whopper,2015-12-24 12:20:00,2174,Merry Christmas to you too Lew.  Just having my kids together and some good eats is good enough for me
950449,ketchenany,2015-12-24 12:55:00,3229,Merry Christmas Lew. Today we have all the kids coming and their families for dinner (16) planning on lighting a fire on the patio and roast chestnuts with the little ones since they can be outside. Tomorrow off to Newmarket for dinner with two daughters and their family.
950451,wormdunker,2015-12-24 13:41:00,1711,"Merry Christmas Lew & your family as well!  I put up outdoor lights Tuesday, wifey & I decorated our tree Tuesday evening (with a Caesar of course), wrapped gifts last night for our 2 lovely daughters & 3 grandchildren.  This afternoon we are visiting our daughter's home in Stoney Creek, tomorrow we are hosting a small dinner for a few family members.  We will have our family Christmas on Monday 28th, due to our eldest daughter working the weekend at Holiday Inn in Windsor.  I can't wait to see the little ones open gifts.  At my age I don't need or want much, it's more enjoyable to watch the little guys. Merry Christmas to all!"
