Make it a point of trying to catch a movie there every summer just for the experience of going through the place. When Debbe's mom passed away we found some cool older stuff that she had saved...magazines newspapers and the like. Gave a few things to Keith for his show cases in the halls. He was very happy and gave us some free passes for that summer.  Not a movie goer at all but I make an exception for Keith's Highland Cinemas in Kinmount. If you are a movie buff at all or appreciate any collection of older things this is worth a visit. Pretty much the whole theatre..5 actual theatres... are furnished with seating and decor from old torn down movie houses.  The halls between the theatres are lined with old projection equipment and movie posters, many with little descriptions of the age of the stuff and where it came from. Show cases of magazines books and anything popular  from bygone years. Love the place."

It's a movie about the whaling ship Essex and her crew and it proves that truth really is stranger than fiction.  No spoiler alerts from me."
