950818,Roy,2015-12-27 15:33:00,13728,I'm quite sure that member Christopher k can tie exactly what you're looking for. Hope you find what you need.
950819,solopaddler,2015-12-27 15:43:00,8605,Haven't seen the Northland ones. A viable alternative that will be easier to find locally is the Phantom wacky wiggler nymphs sold by Redwing Tackle. They're about the same size as the Northland nymphs and come in a bunch of colours.  
950820,Joeytier,2015-12-27 15:44:00,3990,Lindy Whatsit's are a close option as well.
950821,jeffw,2015-12-27 16:02:00,267,"Thanks for the replies I have tied some stone fly patterns and tried the lindy watwits but for whatever reason the specks, bows and perch annihilate the northland stoneflies. I will have to try the Redwing nymphs"
950823,huddy,2015-12-27 16:29:00,16,Maybe try Walmart
950834,misfish,2015-12-27 17:30:00,29133,I was just looking at the Northland site. They have them at 20% off. Is ordering from them an option Jeff ?
950836,jeffw,2015-12-27 17:33:00,267,I saw that earlier today Brian and that might be my only choice
950837,misfish,2015-12-27 17:33:00,29133,"I'm quite sure that member Christopher k can tie exactly what you're looking for. Hope you find what you need.  Yes Chris is a great tyer. He must be super busy,as I am still waiting on a small order. No rush though,as theres no ice yet.LOL"
