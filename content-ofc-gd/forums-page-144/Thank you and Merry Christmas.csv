950605,aplumma,2015-12-25 14:22:00,6896,Thank you to all of the members to OFC for making this past year a great one. The stories and inspiration that cross these pages make me proud to be here. The willingness to give advise and a helping hand in the world is getting rarer these days but as long as it is continues to grow and is strong here we will keep the lights on.  Merry Christmas to all and a Prosperous New Year   Art
