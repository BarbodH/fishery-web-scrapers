950619,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-25 17:00:00,10439," Looks like the right one, but sooner or later I sure you'll need the radio licence.  Don't really need the license any more unless using it in other countries. Even then I wouldn't bother.  https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/oep-navigation-radiocomms-faqs-1489.htm  "
