951267,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-31 04:48:00,2582,So how'd you like driving in the snow with the new winter tires Steve ? Never went to Caygeon after all Lew. And I'm working the afternoon 3-11 shift this week so by the time I made it out of the house after the snowfall all the streets here had been plowed. Snow the next 3 days in the forecast so we will see if I get to play around in it.

951269,Sinker,2015-12-31 05:24:00,8692,Once we have it I will have a hut on the perch grounds. We will hook up im sure  S.
950849,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-27 19:24:00,2582,Came out yesterday morning to a flat tire so decided while it was getting  repaired I'd finally throw a set of snows on. Never owned/driven with them before so this winter I will finally be able to see if I will continue with them or switch back to all seasons. Many descussions on here have helped me make up my mind to give it a go and helped with my decision on what to get so a belated thx to all who have helped out with this.  With my usual luck this will of course mean we will pretty much be snowless this winter...just thought I'd throw this on here so everyone waiting for snow would know who to blame
950850,BillM,2015-12-27 19:30:00,17367,Snow or no snow they grip a lot better then normal tires when it gets cold.
950851,lew,2015-12-27 19:32:00,12766,"When your driving in snow with your new dedicated winter tires Steve you'll wonder why you didn't buy them years ago, and you and yours will be much safer now too.  You'll get far better traction both going forward and stopping and when you go into a turn you'll hold the road the way your sposed to."
950856,Joeytier,2015-12-27 19:55:00,3990,"Snow or no snow they grip a lot better then normal tires when it gets cold. Yep.   Softer tread compound means better traction in cold weather regardless of whether or not there's ice or snow on the roads.  I always used snowflake-rated a/t tires previously (general grabbers and duratracs) which were fairly effective, but this year I went to Hankook i-Pike rw-11's true winter tires and the difference is unreal."
950857,misfish,2015-12-27 19:56:00,29133,"Steve, you were just moved to the top of the friend list.LOL  I see one flake, just one, and back down you go,,,,,,,,,,HAHA  You will see a big difference for sure. When I had the Avenger, it was the first time I had gone with all 4 snows. The best investment.  Ok,I,ll let you have one snow fall. To try them out. Thats it MR."
950859,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-27 19:57:00,8243,"Don't apologize, we don't need any snow, ice would be nice for all my fellow OFC'ers here that want to fish through it. You will wonder like Lew said how you ever drove without snow tires before."
950871,Sinker,2015-12-27 21:26:00,8692,"I figured it was my fault when I bought the snowmobile, but I will share the blame with you, bud!  You will really notice a huge difference with snows.  S."
950875,GBW,2015-12-27 22:31:00,8460,
950877,GBW,2015-12-27 22:45:00,8460,PS: I will not share the blame till said sled is here at my house. Till then it's all on you all...
950878,HTHM,2015-12-27 22:47:00,4082,"SNow is a very important part of the seasonal cycle, no snow means less crops."
950879,Rizzo,2015-12-27 22:49:00,4754,congrats on the new tires....you will not go back! Remember the first snows I bought...what a difference
950880,ecmilley,2015-12-27 23:12:00,2163,really thought it was my fault when getting the new jiffy
950883,lew,2015-12-27 23:21:00,12766,"Guess your gonna find out just how good those winter tires really are Steve, sounds like a bunch of white stuff heading our way tomorrow evening."
950896,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-28 01:08:00,2582,"Guess your gonna find out just how good those winter tires really are Steve, sounds like a bunch of white stuff heading our way tomorrow evening. AWESOME   I may be on #10 heading up to Caygeon. Between Cavan and Caygeon lotsa  hills to slalom  Be able to give it a real test."
950898,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-28 01:14:00,956,Didn't I read that you can get a discount on insurance if you have snow tires on.  I think its for 2016.  My wife has 3 winters on and 1 all season.  I wonder what the insurance company would say if she got into an accident?
950909,ecmilley,2015-12-28 02:25:00,2163,AWESOME   I may be on #10 heading up to Caygeon. Between Cavan and Caygeon lotsa  hills to slalom  Be able to give it a real test. 10 and sturgeon road so much more fun since they stopped putting up snow fences
950913,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-28 03:17:00,8243,We are installing a new furnace this year. Since we started no cold or snow. My brother is doing it and I told him no rush. It's been sitting here for over a month. Maybe March. Next year a snowmobile. The problem is when to install the central air.
950918,manitoubass2,2015-12-28 04:00:00,11391,Plans on a snowmobile? That isnt gonna help the back my friend.  But it will help the mind lol  Went for a cruise here at 114km per hour. Used to get 117 outta her but shes a few years young now  Soooo fun!
950919,Sinker,2015-12-28 04:06:00,8692,You will go right past my house. I will be the guys smiling ear to ear on the yamaha venture  S.
950941,wormdunker,2015-12-28 10:30:00,1711,I just purchased my first set of winter tires on my F-150.  Same Hankooks Joey described.  We haven't had any snow yet in Niagara to give them an evaluation.  According to the above posts - I did the right thing!
950963,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-28 17:09:00,8243,That will be the day I get on a snowmobile. I'll buy it so it doesn't snow.
951200,lew,2015-12-30 22:10:00,12766,So how'd you like driving in the snow with the new winter tires Steve ?
951244,Sinker,2015-12-31 01:06:00,8692,I liked ripping around in the sled lol.....good timez!  S.
951245,ecmilley,2015-12-31 01:11:00,2163,"thought about taking sled for a rip, but soft snow soft ground good way to do damage, wait a bit for the ground to freeze up and get some base. commuting on some 100000km wrangler hp was fun, abs/asc/4wd all did a marvelous job of keeping it on the road"
951248,misfish,2015-12-31 01:41:00,29133,"So how'd you like driving in the snow with the new winter tires Steve ?  Steve might be still  driving around singing, I LOVE THESE TIRES, LOL"
