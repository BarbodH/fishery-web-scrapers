The poles inside the hut slip into 'fabric pockets' in the 4 corners, and these pockets are wearing thru. One of the poles has poked thru it already. Anyone had repairs done on an ice shelter in the GTA?  Thanks Pete"

951131,Fisherpete,2015-12-30 10:51:00,1814,I think I know the place you are talking about - Gerrard/Woodbine?
951243,porkpie,2015-12-31 01:03:00,2521,Yep
951251,misfish,2015-12-31 01:46:00,29133,"I have read alot about them popping through pete. Makes me think, thier hubs are made to tight. From all the hubs I see out there, the esk seems to be the most ridged of them all. Is this how they made them? I was thinking that maybe a cut of 1"" off the poles might make for easier set ups and break downs. I know since I replaced a broken pole on the roof part of mine,it seems to pop into postion much easier."
951252,Fisherpete,2015-12-31 01:48:00,1814,"Thanks Brad. I gave them a call, they are closed till Jan 4 but it's not like there will be ice by then anyways lol... will try them then.  Brian - I had that same thought about maybe cutting the poles an inch shorter... might just do that.  Cheers Pete"
