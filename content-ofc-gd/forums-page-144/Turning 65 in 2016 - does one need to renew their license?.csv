950780,big guy,2015-12-27 03:14:00,414,My brother-in-law turns 65 in September. Does he need to renew his fishing license next year to get him to his birthday? Or is he good because he will be turning 65?  Thanks
950781,Fish Farmer,2015-12-27 03:24:00,2234,"Hay bud, I had to because I turned 65 in March last year.  I feel your pain, You can take a chance, but it's up to you. You never know when the Cowboys will show up and check."

You never know when the Cowboys will show up and check.  As I said, I'm not inquiring for myself, I'm only 50. My brother-in-law checked the MNR site and can't seem to find a definitive answer, in his opinion anyway, so that's why I'm asking."
950785,Loonietoon,2015-12-27 04:52:00,1450,Under 18 years old or 65 years+ No Outdoors Card or fishing licence tag required. Government-issued identification with your name and date of birth. You must follow catch and possession limits for sport fishing  This is from the 2016 REGS that are on the message board here ???

950788,16 Footer,2015-12-27 11:47:00,191,I turn 65 in March of 2016 and will not renew my fishing licence. Weather is too warm for ice fishing this year. What kind of government issued ID should I carry in my fishing box that will not get wet? I have an old expired drivers licence and wonder if that will do as ID. I usually don't carry my wallet with me while fishing in case it gets wet or lost.
950794,Fish Farmer,2015-12-27 13:14:00,2234,"I've been checked a few times, all I show is my drivers licence. One guy that asked me for a fishing licence, I told him I was 65, he took my word as I was getting my wallet out. If you're not going to fish till you're 65 you should be OK"

950807,lew,2015-12-27 14:39:00,12766,I have an old expired drivers licence and wonder if that will do as ID.  Just guessing here but the fact that it's expired may render it as unacceptible.
950817,big guy,2015-12-27 15:19:00,414,"Thanks everyone, he's coming over for breakfast in a few minutes, I will tell him the bad news."
950829,16 Footer,2015-12-27 17:11:00,191,I was not born in Canada but have lived here most of my life. The birth certificate I have is paper and not in English so that will not work as age ID.
950832,lew,2015-12-27 17:17:00,12766,My wife doesn't have a drivers license so she went to Service Ontario and got a Photo I.D. card and that is all the I.D. she's ever needed and she's never been questioned on it.  Just another idea for you.
950840,SBCregal,2015-12-27 17:48:00,688,An expired ID isn't valid at a casino (guess how I found out).  I'd imagine it'd be the same to the MNR.
951015,John Bacon,2015-12-29 01:38:00,3277,"How about using your birth certificate? Mine is plasticized.  You must have a very old one.  The new ones are not plasticized and it is illegal to laminate them.  However, a zip lock bag should be able to keep all your ID dry in the boat.  I use them for anything that needs to stay dry when I am out in the boat."
