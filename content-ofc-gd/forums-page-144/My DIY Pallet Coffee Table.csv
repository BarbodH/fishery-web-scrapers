951232,FloatnFly,2015-12-31 00:21:00,1640,"Some of you may remember way back to earlier this year, I was in search of some pallets/skids to break down and build a coffee with.  Well thanks to one of the members here, I was able to collect a few skids, and get some pretty decent quality wood to build it with.  After pulling them apart, I took the boards over to a friends to have them refined, had all the edges jointed, and the thickness planed down.  After planing them all down, with all the dirt removed from the face of the boards, the beautiful wood was revealed, a nice oak!!!  I glued all the boards together to get the top    The legs are made from spruce which were cut from 3 x 6 x 8ft rough cut boards and sanded down smooth We chose to go with the outside leg configuration    Here it is all stained up, with all the edges routered down to remove the shard corners and the legs as well    And the finished top     all thats left to do is to varnish it"
951234,davey buoy,2015-12-31 00:30:00,5505,"Very nice,well done,has to feel good you seeing the finished product !!!!!"
951235,leaf4,2015-12-31 00:30:00,2466,"Nice, in my next house I'll be doing one of these  http://projectnursery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/How-to-Make-a-Pallet-Wall.png"
951236,FloatnFly,2015-12-31 00:33:00,1640,"Nice, in my next house I'll be doing one of these  http://projectnursery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/How-to-Make-a-Pallet-Wall.png   would look great in my man cave/fly tying room"
951258,OhioFisherman,2015-12-31 03:13:00,6623,"Cool!  Not sure what is available up there, here some wood processors sell bundles of slab wood cheap. If you have access to the right tools it would be easy to plane 8-10 foot 1 inch boards out of them."
951273,wormdunker,2015-12-31 09:29:00,1711,That looks awesome!  Do you have any pix of the pallets?  Before your work began.
951278,Big Cliff,2015-12-31 12:29:00,6899,Very nice! It always feels good when you can take something that other people would normally throw away and turn it into something beautiful.
951280,lew,2015-12-31 12:37:00,12766,"I store firewood on my old skids, yours looks much nicer.  Really nice job !!  "
951281,mr blizzard,2015-12-31 12:41:00,1589,"Well done  sir We burn skids up here for the fire pit,,,,,but when I find some that r hardwood I keep them for the same purpose,,,to make things out of  There is gold in another mans junk for sure, its all in the eyes of the beholder  U did have me a little worried in the first picture lol re the legs  I will try to find and send some pics of 2 burl tables I made a few years ago  Again from a wood lover  WELL DONE"
951284,DanD,2015-12-31 12:52:00,2223,"Before my brother became ill, he was a hobby furniture maker and he made a few downsized tables for me to fit our weekend trailer; that I'm still using today, 18 years later. He loved working with oak and there'd be a     if he would see your table. Very nice work, especially coming from rough wood.  Dan."
951286,manitoubass2,2015-12-31 12:55:00,11391,Nice work!!!
951289,kitch,2015-12-31 13:05:00,42,"Amazing what hides in a skid!  A lot of work to bring it up the way you did. We heat with wood here and a friend dropped off over 100 skids of mixed woods.  Always a heartbreaker when you see good hardwood in them but it always seems it's full of nails and staples. Nice to see someone with the vision to take ""garbage"" and make it into something!"
951292,captpierre,2015-12-31 13:21:00,2521,Good work. Looks like ash boards
951304,limeyangler,2015-12-31 15:03:00,5204,That looks amazingâ€¦thanks for sharing.
951308,Gerritt,2015-12-31 15:13:00,6129,All the skids in my plant are either hardwood or chep pallets....  Never thought to turn them into something like that! Very cool!!!
951311,dave524,2015-12-31 15:20:00,4508,"Good work. Looks like ash boards  I know my wood , ( U of T Forestry 74 ) when I first started in the steel industry in the late seventies you would see a lot of Elm used on hardwood skids , when we were losing our Elms to disease. I suspect there will be a lot of Ash used in hardwood skids today cause of trees being removed because of the borer."
951313,misfish,2015-12-31 15:58:00,29133,"Thats a nice piece you built.  All our coils come on hardwood skids. I use to break,cut and stack it. You talk about a hot burning wood to heat the house."
951314,esoxansteel,2015-12-31 16:01:00,1307,"From skid row, to Wow, nicest looking table made of skids youll ever see, great work, got an edge for the vise as well"
951318,Dara,2015-12-31 16:18:00,3052,Looks good to me...now for some end tables eh
951324,GBW,2015-12-31 17:51:00,8460,I'll take 1  nice job. I made a blanket box for my son out of old barn boards cause they were there and looked good. nice work
951328,manitoubass2,2015-12-31 17:58:00,11391,Hahaha my neighbour just made a rabbit den and shed outta skids. Around here they are free. Its rustic to say the leasr but functional.  Baffles my mind you made a very nice table outta them. Kudos to you!!!!
951351,FloatnFly,2015-12-31 21:26:00,1640,"thanks all!  if you take the time to find what you're looking for, and spend some hours cleaning them up, its amazing what you can find in the pallets.  The hardest part is pulling them apart without snapping the boards  from the pile of skids, i also got some nice ash, and some beachwood as well"
951428,Moosebunk,2016-01-01 16:30:00,3970,Great job.  From skids to eh!?!  Recycling master in the making you are.
