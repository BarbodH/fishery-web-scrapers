950993,Fishwilly,2015-12-28 22:38:00,206,Wow that's a huge catfish. Guy beats state record then goes on to smash his own record 24hrs later!!
951025,OhioFisherman,2015-12-29 02:45:00,6623,"That is a big fish, and two in that range in a day?"
951030,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-29 03:50:00,8243,"Wowza. What size live well do you need t 47""oA Bl keep 105 pound fish alive, another boat filled with water? It didn't mention what lb. test, crane cable? Good for him, a story for a lifetime if he never catches another fish. Anyone know the world record cat?  Watch for the naysayers to come out now. It always seems to happen on a record fish.  I know how to Bing and Google.  2011, Nick Anderson a HS Football coach in Greenville North Carolina on Fathers Day weekend. A IGFA recognized World record of a Blue Catfish weighing in at 143 pounds measuring 57"" long and a girth of 47"".  This is where the naysayers start coming out of the millwork I'm sure. It took 45 minutes and he said he used an Ugly Stick with a Shimano reel spooled with 30 pound test. The record of any catfish in some states is not recognized as some consider them to be an invasive species. I believe it was caught but I have trouble myself picturing a Wall Mart Ugly Stick holding out that long."

Ugly Sticks aren't the most sensitive rods out there, but they are tough, and fairly inexpensive.  Catfish aren't Salmon, they aren't known for blazing runs? A properly set drag and some time and you wear them out, 30 pound test is fine for that. If you are in a boat fishing it makes it easier, they lead, you follow! LOL  There was a campground near me that also ran a couple of pay to fish catfish ponds, nothing as huge as those, but a chance at one 40-50 pounds. Ohio used to have a number of places like that, most ran the cat fishing deal from dusk till dawn. It gave people a place to park their lawn chairs and suck back a few beers while fishing."
