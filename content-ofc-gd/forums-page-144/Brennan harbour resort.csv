951121,richyb,2015-12-30 02:21:00,774,Has anyone been to Brennan Harbour resort in Spanish Ontario ?  6 of us are thinking about heading there in July. Any reviews would be great thanks.

951140,richyb,2015-12-30 13:36:00,774,Thanks . Is there some good fishing in the area?  Is early July a good time to have good fishing there ?  My uncle went last spring for the pike opener and said they had a blast but didnt get many fish because of the messed up spring. Im hoping july is a better option
