949630,ckewley,2015-12-17 15:44:00,699,Yes the lake Brad & Steve were on has only Brookies
949758,jimmer,2015-12-18 14:51:00,2730,Both are great looking fish!
949778,Dara,2015-12-18 18:17:00,3052,Pardon me asking because I don't know all the rules but aren't brookies closed this time of year?
949790,ckewley,2015-12-18 20:19:00,699,"In zone 15 all the stocked lakes are year round fishable, bait restrictions on some"
949791,Dara,2015-12-18 20:30:00,3052,"OK, up here all Splake lakes are year round but not spec lakes, stocked or not. Bait restrictions in LSSP"
949793,Joeytier,2015-12-18 20:40:00,3990,They don't mess around in LSPP...checked my set lines and tore apart my whole campsite while winter camping on Gama.  It was not appreciated LOL
949885,fishboy,2015-12-19 17:15:00,550,Great post fellas-looks like an awesome time on the water.  I'm a Minden-Haliburton guy too and can't wait until I can get back up for some ice fishing.
949889,limeyangler,2015-12-19 18:18:00,5204,HOW DID I MISS THIS REPORT??  Awesome stuff lads!
949892,davey buoy,2015-12-19 18:32:00,5505,"What nice looking fish,WTG guys!!!!!!!!!"
949897,SirCranksalot,2015-12-19 19:13:00,3291,"It is a Splake just has more of the Brookie characteristics , the one I caught had more of a Laker look  Ok, picky, picky!    dam nice fish either way"
950031,Dara,2015-12-21 03:26:00,3052,They don't mess around in LSPP...checked my set lines and tore apart my whole campsite while winter camping on Gama. It was not appreciated LOL We had an episode there once too..expensive
950749,hendrix,2015-12-26 19:47:00,61,Amazing report!! I'm super envious
949158,ckewley,2015-12-14 13:49:00,699,"This trip has been a little while in the making & you couldn't have asked for better weather or company so the wait was definitely worth it. Chris posted a open seat for a Minden/Haliburton area trip & one guy PM'd him. I make great time getting to Chris's place on Saturday & shortly after we're on the road to meet up with Brad & Steve (sorry guy's don't know your on-line names). Greetings all round then down to business, map comes out & we start to pigeon hole it. Brad & Steve are avid backwoods guy's & have fished just about every lake in the area & some as recently as last weekend. We settle on Lake X & the target species is Splake.   As soon as we hit the lake the guy's have a spot they'd hit a few weeks prior & did really well so the head over while Chris & I head to another spot. Saw one fish surface so I start chucking spinners & Chris is on worm. No luck for us but Brad & Steve tied into one quite early & nailed a few more before moving on. We wrap around the lake to a spot Chris knows & after a little while I get into one. Float goes down but I thought it was because of the bigger minnow, after a few seconds you knew it was a fish & wait a few more seconds to hopefully allow it to fully swallow the minnow. Set thew hook & bang, fish on. Fish flashes & I see half the minnow out it's mouth & think not hooked & a few seconds later he was off. Swearing ensues as I look into the deep trying to spot the bugger, not paying attention the minnow was floating on the surface boatside when WHAM he or another one hit it hard.   Get him in the boat & released. We hit the shore where the other boy's were & conversations start up with ease. Talk about Lake xx & Lake yy & fish stories galore. The action seemed to die down so We decide to hit a few connected lakes to try our luck. Once we hit Lake Y it's decided we'd blow through this lake for Lake Z, beautiful lakes these were.   We hit a few spots along the way with not much happening. We were to land on the island until we spied this spot & b-line for it.    Great drop off but Chris would bag the only one at this spot but what a beauty it was.    Lots of fishing talk later Brad brings up a secret lake that Chris knows. Brad & Steve have never fished it so Chris tells them how to make their way into this lake, too much for it to happen this day but Sunday is a whole other day. Chris receives a text on Sunday with this     They hit pay dirt on this lake, nothing huge but lots of action. I think it's safe to say that us 4 will be fishing together again maybe even quite often as time allows. I echo Chris's remarks in another thread, OFC'rs are a rare breed & haven't met one that has been anything other than fantastic. Great day!!  Final shot, Longmorn is a decent whisky, this 16yr replaced a far superior 15yr a few years ago, its good but the 15 was a hell of allot better    "
949159,AKRISONER,2015-12-14 13:55:00,5558,literally the most beautiful of all fish. I need to do more backwoods trekking for this kinda stuff.
949160,Roy,2015-12-14 14:06:00,13728,Excellent report! I love those back lakes too. A great trip with new friends and fish as a bonus...you can't beat that. Thanks.
949161,captpierre,2015-12-14 14:13:00,2521,Great report! And for middle of Dec. thanks
949167,chris.brock,2015-12-14 15:00:00,4053,"No wind and flat as glass water made for great boat control and easy paddling, but the bite seemed a little off.  Regardless, I had a great day, great guys.  Awesome write up Bud!"
949171,jimmer,2015-12-14 15:24:00,2730,"Thanks for sharing guys. I was really tempted to pursue the offer that Chris put out there last week and I'm sorry I didn't. Great scenery, fish and by the look of it, a great time."
949195,msp,2015-12-14 18:51:00,1336,"I sure hope that you guys blindfolded Brad and Steve ! Even blindfolded, Im sure they would still find the lake.  Nobody catches fish around them parts without Brad and Steve knowing about it !  Eh boys !"
949202,TJQ,2015-12-14 20:19:00,7806,Great report!  Small lakes RULE!!
949208,Joeytier,2015-12-14 20:56:00,3990,Beauty shots.  Glad someone is taking advantage of this December we're having!
949220,misfish,2015-12-14 22:04:00,29133,"Looks like you guys had some great waters and weather to make for a great day.  Like I  said Chris,,,,,,,,,,,,,     Next time I hope."
949222,manitoubass2,2015-12-14 22:07:00,11391,Love the title???  Looks like a beauty day! Cant beat the backlakes IMO  Gorgeous fish!
949262,Jds63,2015-12-15 00:02:00,1365,"Nice report , gotta love those colours on those beauties"
949267,Sinker,2015-12-15 01:07:00,8692,Sweet! Great lookin trout!
949276,Acountdeleted,2015-12-15 02:28:00,2562,This was a great report. Beautiful lakes and fish. Thanks for the read.
949284,Dara,2015-12-15 03:20:00,3052,I love catching them splake...sure we had ice and snow to get to my favorite lake...thanks for the post and pics
949298,chris.brock,2015-12-15 05:39:00,4053,"I sure hope that you guys blindfolded Brad and Steve ! Even blindfolded, Im sure they would still find the lake.   Exactly!  There was no use blindfolding them because they already knew all the lakes.  Your name came up in conversation msp.     You have your priorities straight Bri, good man. It looks like you guys had some fun on Saturday."
949308,msp,2015-12-15 12:25:00,1336,"""Your name came up in conversation msp""  Uh oh !  Glad you guys had a great time out. looks like a nice December day"
949313,Rod Caster,2015-12-15 13:24:00,5784,I wish there were more reports like this!  You guys certainly had a busy day. Usually one back lake per day is enough for me.
949421,SirCranksalot,2015-12-15 22:32:00,3291,"           Chris---why so glum??. If I'd caught a speck that size I'd be grinning from ear to ear!! I guess I missed a good opportunity. Double dang darn!!.  It looks like the expression ""...and a good time was had by all' would apply here. (BTW, I understand it's considered good etiquette for the guide to let his guest catch(or at least land) the biggest fish.  )"
949470,chris.brock,2015-12-16 05:42:00,4053,"  Chris---why so glum??.  I'm glum because you couldn't make the trip,   Next time.  Those guys are experienced, back lake bushmen. No beer guzzling guide required."
949472,Freshtrax,2015-12-16 06:22:00,2215,"Nice going guys, can't beat a trip like that."
949477,Chuck Enwinde,2015-12-16 11:50:00,247,"Thanks for the great day guys.  New friends, beautiful lakes, awesome weather and even a few fish to top it off.  You're right, you can't beat a trip like that.  It's funny, a few weeks ago I was praying for an early ice season - now I'm hoping it holds off a couple more weeks.  And chris.brock is selling himself short - He's like an encyclopedia for the area."
949511,jimmer,2015-12-16 16:27:00,2730,I thought that was a splake that Chris was holding????? The tail says splake.
949533,ckewley,2015-12-16 20:46:00,699,"It is a Splake just has more of the Brookie characteristics , the one I caught had more of a Laker look"
949627,jimmer,2015-12-17 15:32:00,2730,That smaller fish is a brookie though. Square tail and blue halos.
