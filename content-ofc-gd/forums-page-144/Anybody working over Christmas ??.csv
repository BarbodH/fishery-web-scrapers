950547,pics,2015-12-24 22:13:00,1268,I worked last year but I'm scheduled off this one . I have to go in on new years day though.. no big deal... my workplace isn't much different than Chris Brocks.. no thanks or Christmas party etc.. not even a handshake from anyone other than the shift foreman.
950602,Gerritt,2015-12-25 13:58:00,6129,"I had a bunch of personal days, N days and sick days to use up as well as 120 hours of vacation time.... I normally work every stat holiday I can get my hands on at triple time as well.. The money is too good to turn down around 1000.00 for one shift? Sign me up!  This year is different though I used my personal days and sick days up (use em or lose em) I've been off for a week now, I go in for one shift on the 27 and off for another week  and I still need to use my 120hours of vacation before April!"

At least it is nice weather out , that will be the only plus to working today .  I got out of the Navy in '67 and had awhile to wait before getting on the Fire Dept. and my buddy got me on with a private company at the airport. We had our own private hangar and looked after Eastern, American, Caladonia and BOAC  Only terminal out there in those days was the old round terminal 1 and Dixon Rd was a country lane compared to today.  That tarmac is a cold unforgiving place when the winter storms are blowing across those wide open fields."

I have to go in on new years day though.. no big deal... my workplace isn't much different than Chris Brocks.. no thanks or Christmas party etc.. not even a handshake from anyone other than the shift foreman. Don't we know it Phil, After working at Stelco for almost 40 years, now we sit wondering if we're going to get a pension cheque next month after our neighbours south took it over and our fine government's secret deal with them. Getting back to Lew's Question, I'm retired so I'm off Christmas but next year could be a different sorry?? Might be looking for a part time senior job."

To work 40 years and get the shaft, is not the way it,s suppose to end Dave."
950655,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-25 21:52:00,8243,"Dave, I have had a few sleepless nights. Apparently my salary pension is taking a 14% hit on January 1 and you guys are taking an even bigger hit. It absolutely is shameful as to what is transpiring. That coupled with our loss of major medical benefits ($600.00 a month for all the crap I was taking) is really making me reflect on my life's work there as well as working out here at the lake for a time in 79 and 80 and wondering if all the sacrifices we made was a complete waste. The only other place I worked until I retired was Russell's Drug store at King and Rosedale when I was 15. At 16 I started driving Euclid's on weekends and summers. 40 hour weekends when I could get them, man this doesn't feel very good Dave.  Sorry all for the rant and off topic. I needed to vent."
950667,MCTFisher9120,2015-12-26 01:13:00,3761,Christmas Eve and Christmas we had off work. Back at it in the morning. 2 days off not bad I guess
950669,fishing n autograph,2015-12-26 01:40:00,2540,I have never seen a busier Xmas eve than last night. It was insanity. No one wants to do over time Christmas morning....ugh

950673,ketchenany,2015-12-26 02:05:00,3229,I plan it so I take a few days before and then go back In January! My mother worked in a hospital and she always worked the holidays!

950726,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-26 15:11:00,8243,"What are we going to do Dave? Do whatever we need to to survive. I love this country but it can make criminals out of law abiding, pay all our taxes on time, work 8 out of 10 holidays and drag your ass in there for 40 years, in my case only 33. 110F on the floor and 0 unloading frozen material on the High Docks. You had the same thing up in that crane. I hear medical benefits are covered in the pokey where some guys may just end up. There was a movie about a crew of geriatric wiseguys that rob a bank in Boca Raton. Please watch my walker while I rob this bank. I left very early with our Ironmaking 25 and out pensions, I had a crystal ball behind #3 stove at E Furnace. I told anyone that would listen the sky is falling and they called me Chicken Little in 2000. I thought I would only get a few years in before they went teats up, I was wrong. I can't even stand long enough to hand out carts at Wally World, I wish."

I must have worked over 20 Christmases and New Years in all those years. Even when I was on days for a few years we had to go in for the shut downs and then start ups. It was part of the deal because I knew a good, really good, pension was at the end of the tunnel. I had enough for site to take it early even though I took a major hit. So I consider myself luckier than others.  Will we see you on the 9th? Try and make it."

950465,Acountdeleted,2015-12-24 15:06:00,2562,"Off christmas. I'm actually sad I'm not working NYE.  Back when I used to bartend, working NYE was the best, people would get you drunk for free, you still got to talk to the pretty ladies (more so then if you wern't working) and my pockets would often be full after the night. Sure beats paying $100 for an evening."
950466,fishing n autograph,2015-12-24 15:12:00,2540,I'll be working nights Xmas eve and Xmas. At least this year I'll be home to see the kids open their presents. I missed that last year and the year before.

950473,mike rousseau,2015-12-24 16:24:00,4661,I'm surprised in you chris...  During the holidays when most do what they can to give and be kind.... Instead of pointing out the mistake and EARNING your pay your choosing to capitalize on your bosses mistake for your own financial gains...  If you weren't aware and found out afterwords I understand you being mad for a missed opportunity but your sitting back and letting it happen...  Actions like this make me sick to my stomach

950498,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-24 18:27:00,8243,Worked the holidays for over 20 years depending on the schedule until I went on days. I hated it. If we shut down we had to start up with everything frozen and that was a pain plus dangerous and if we ran we had to dump Hot Metal into the pits. Often the pits would blow to Kingdome come. and the mushroom clouds could be seen in Toronto. That was before Health and Safety and MOE legislation.
950500,NAW,2015-12-24 18:37:00,4022,"Myself,I took a month off.  Some downtime between two jobs.  I had hoped to spend some of that time on the ice..!!  No dice.  Though I don't work Christmas, My GF does, and has for the last two years.  So we are changing Christmas to the 26 this year.  No biggie, it's just a square on a calender."
950508,misfish,2015-12-24 19:28:00,29133,"The rule for maintenance guys Lew is, work during shut downs. In the past, I would be looking for a break as to all the hours and days I had put in over the year, but still needed to get things done. Since I have stepped back and working 40-44 hr weeks the past few months, I am not so stressed about working them. Off today til sunday, then have some machines to over haul and move, monday to wed. Then off til the 5th of jan.  Life is good. Or getting better I should say.  Happy holidays to you and Di."
