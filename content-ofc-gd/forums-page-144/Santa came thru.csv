950884,captpierre,2015-12-28 00:03:00,2521,I had enquired on this site about a setup for trolling for walleye on Pigeon. A Tekota 300 with line counter was suggested. I picked up a used one.  Found it to be too heavy to hold for hours and cold in the fall. So Santa brought plan B. Quantum Accurist PT/rod combo from Cabelas. $150 Has a flipping switch for easy line let out. Will use the new coloured PP for help with depth. Hope it works out.  
950886,porkpie,2015-12-28 00:38:00,2521,"Sweet rig, it'll work awesome!  You'll like the PP metered line, it's just a bear to find it.  I had to order mine!"
950889,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-28 00:53:00,8243,"Santa was good to you. That is 1 sexy outfit. But buy a Scotty rod holder for 25 bucks man and save the pain, seriously. I put it in the holder and keep my finger on the line even with the spool open if sensitivity is an issue.  I blew both my elbows out badly requiring surgery on 1 from trolling in fast water on the Ottawa River. My Dr. said I had Tennis elbow, I said I don't play tennis anymore, it's from trolling. He said well you have fishing elbow, I asked for a prescription for a rod holder. He kicked me out, again."
950893,captpierre,2015-12-28 01:03:00,2521,I have rod holders Use them for skis Prefer holding my walleye rod. Nothing like feeling the strike.

950938,wormdunker,2015-12-28 10:21:00,1711,Yup install a rod holder!  Especially if you're in deeper water dragging a dipsey.
950940,porkpie,2015-12-28 10:27:00,2521,"He's trolling for pickerel rod in hand.  This also allows you to instantly drop your rod back to feed a light biter.  Rod holders are great, but not applicable to every scenario."
951018,Joeytier,2015-12-29 01:49:00,3990,Tekota is beyond overkill for trolling up eyes on inland lakes.  Looks like a great setup you picked up there.
951021,Freshtrax,2015-12-29 02:01:00,2215,How much you want for the tekota?
951064,Sinker,2015-12-29 14:51:00,8692,Lol.....thats what I was thinking too!  That is a much better rig for bouncing harnesses. Good score!  S.
951071,KraTToR,2015-12-29 16:08:00,506,"Lol.....thats what I was thinking too!  That is a much better rig for bouncing harnesses. Good score!  S.  True!  I use an Accurist for Bottom Bouncin'.. The flippin switch is great for when you're moving deeper, just thumb it and you're good to go..."
951103,fishindevil,2015-12-29 22:55:00,6254,I have 4 accurists with the flipping switch for walleye bottom bouncing !!! They are awesome and stand the test of time and hours doing the work !!! The flipping switch is the best for sure and yes I had to order mine as well they are getting hard to find !!! Flipping switches are going out of style I guess but I love them !!! Cheers
951109,porkpie,2015-12-30 00:28:00,2521,Abu silver max.  Cheap (sometimes $60 on sale). And work great for bouncing.  Have flipping switch.  I have 2 and looking for a 3rd for middle child.  I run them on 7 foot ugly sticks.  The ultimate cheap BB harness outfit although those accurists look pretty sweet.  I use metered  line in case we switch to all cranks cause I only keep one line counter in the boat unless I'm on the Great Lakes.  Those rods probably see the most use of any I own.  They are even better since i put the silver Max's on them!
