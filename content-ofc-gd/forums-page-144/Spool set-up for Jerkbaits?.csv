950944,DropShot'r,2015-12-28 13:41:00,62,"Greetings everyone,  Next year I will be fishing 87-110 sized jerkbaits with a new 7ft. med action fast taper spinning rod.  I have been going over several options for spooling my reel. At this point my choice is 15lb braid main line with  about a 3ft. leader of fluorocarbon line.  Just curious what others are using.  Thanks, Drop  "

950978,kickingfrog,2015-12-28 19:15:00,8333,Depends on what species I'm fishing for and how. If I'm trolling I sometimes don't bother with a leader and just direct tie with the braid. But casting direct tied jerk baits leads to lots of tangles so I'll use fluoro almost as much for its stiffness as for its stealth. The flouro does stand up to pike teeth much better than braid.
950979,backbay,2015-12-28 19:36:00,773,"Similar with me as well. Lots of pike where I fish, so I'll use up to 50 lb test flouro. Swivel at the leader/line connection, and I usually use Mustad fastach clips."
951142,Lape0019,2015-12-30 13:45:00,647,"Hey Drop!  I currently fish Jerkbaits on a baitcast reel with 30lb braid. Because the rod I use has micro guides and I have yet to find a knot to fit through them, I typically don't use a leader anymore.  Before I used this combo, I used a Dobyns 702sf/Stradic ci4 with 20lb braid. If I needed a little stretch or a little dealer presentation, I would throw a 4' flourocarbon leader on it.  As mentioned before, pike don't seem to go through flouro as easily but the fact it is virtually invisible and sinks can be used to your advantage while jerkbaiting as well."
951147,fishishere,2015-12-30 14:55:00,2,"I am using 6'6"" Rod with 10lb fluorocarbon straight, I feel braid line is hard to control the lure, but this is just my personal opinion."
951230,ecmilley,2015-12-31 00:17:00,2163,"for jerkbaits i usually use straight braid to the lure, as a impulse/reaction strike line shyness not usually a issue, with that being said i use regular power pro or suffix braid there a little stiffer and less prone to tangles thab slick 8 or suf832, personal preferance though find what works for you"
