950954,Toddyc20,2015-12-28 15:04:00,141,"To all that own a talon, where did you all buy them and how has your experience with them been? I'm currently shopping around for 1 and want to consult my fellow OFNers to see options and opinions."
950958,mattaw,2015-12-28 16:10:00,162,"I own one, love it. I wish I had the 12' model though. With the US dollar where it is the prices have been skyrocketing here. I was in the market for a new one, but it's a bit crazy right now.  I got mine from my local marina who is a Minn Kota dealer. My 0.02, if you get some, get a pair, the ability for your boat not to rotate with the wind is worth its weight in gold if you are serious about them."
950982,skeeter99,2015-12-28 20:33:00,109,"I have the 8 foot and love it , no issues  like mattaw, wish I had the 12 foot model but IMO they are ugly with the motor 1/3 the way down as compared to the 8  I bought mine at  tremblays spring sale  , best price at the time by $100 plus the $100 mail in rebate  like mattaw said also 2 of them is much better but  with one you get to learn how your boat pivots in the wind and you adjust really a non-issue unless you want it on a dime"
951022,ecmilley,2015-12-29 02:15:00,2163,picked mine up at gagnons in 2012 pretty much been perfect ever since got it during the spring no-tax sale
951024,tomkat,2015-12-29 02:37:00,246,Check radio world they had big discounts last time I looked
951044,Yellow Fever,2015-12-29 11:59:00,139,"Well ...I have a 12 foot on my 620, bought it from Radio World. Be prepared for all the non-fishermen to ask ""what's that thing"" and all the fishermen to ask ""how often do you use your Talon"". Being a walleye fisherman I don't use it a ton but it's pretty good the times I do"
951056,Steve,2015-12-29 13:43:00,2075,"buy the 12' and buy two....  you have to realize you need more length than the depth your fishing....  ie, an 8' talon isn't going to do well in the wind and waves in 7 or 8' of water....  my local shop advises folks to at minimum, wait and buy two (as one is truly silly in its application), and most say once they buy 8', they upgrade to the 12'....  as such, if you TRULY feel the need to buy an 8' model, buy it used, as many anglers buy the 8' models, then sell them within a couple years to upgrade to the 12' model."
951073,Toddyc20,2015-12-29 16:20:00,141,Thanks for all of the replies. I'm looking at the 12' for sure. I never put that much thought into getting two but I guess the pivoting is the big issue eh?
951081,skeeter99,2015-12-29 18:32:00,109,"Thanks for all of the replies. I'm looking at the 12' for sure. I never put that much thought into getting two but I guess the pivoting is the big issue eh?  you just learn  that when the wind is in your face when you put it down the boat will swing to the downwind side, i.e the talon will point in the wind direction, the most you will pivot is 180 degrees if the wind is right in your face"
951107,ecmilley,2015-12-30 00:16:00,2163,"pivoting not a big issue een in the wind just position the boat to take advantage of it, unless you want to drop $3600 on 2 12 ft'er"
951136,Yellow Fever,2015-12-30 12:07:00,139,"Well....if your a Bass guy you may need 2, when I Walleye fish I drop the Talon and use my bow mount at super low speed to keep the bow facing where I want."
951150,tomkat,2015-12-30 15:31:00,246,Tempted to get the 8 foot at around a grand at radio world
951152,tomkat,2015-12-30 15:40:00,246,My mistake 6 foot is 1000 8 foot 1300
951156,monomills,2015-12-30 17:23:00,1,"pivoting not a big issue een in the wind just position the boat to take advantage of it, unless you want to drop $3600 on 2 12 ft'er I'm in the market for a 12' talon as well, where can you find them for $1800 a piece? Lowest I've been able to find is $2150/ talon"
951174,Roy,2015-12-30 19:18:00,13728,"Quite the luxury. $2,000. for an anchor? I'd need to get a paper route."
951186,Garnet,2015-12-30 20:49:00,2056,Even 2 will pivot the 180 and then bunny hop across shoals when it gets real nasty. Still want 2.
951327,Sinker,2015-12-31 17:54:00,8692,"Ive always wondered why these silly things are mounted at the stern. Do you ever anchor from the stern?  Wouldnt one on, or close to the bow work better?   I would never get one myself, I just dont see the need for one, but I think they look silly on a fancy glitter boat.  S."
951363,Fishwilly,2015-12-31 22:32:00,206,"Quite the luxury. $2,000. for an anchor? I'd need to get a paper route. That's an understatement!! I guess it's for the droves of weekend warrior bass guys that fancy themselves as ""pros""."
951399,Yellow Fever,2016-01-01 13:43:00,139,"I don't think you need to be a pro to buy a fishing ""tool"" that will help you catch more fish, we could apply that statement everytime we purchase a new Finder,rod or lure for that matter. I have had nights where it helped me catch a bunch of walleye and it was priceless those nights."
951408,lookinforwalleye,2016-01-01 15:23:00,4399,^^^ what Roy said......having said that I can see them coming in handy trying to work a weed bed when its blowing  this is on my radar and more in my budget....
