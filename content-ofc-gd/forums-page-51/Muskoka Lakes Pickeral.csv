1039906,porkpie,2019-01-31 03:13:00,2521,"Thats a nice lookin shack, and a nice fish too!"
1039908,Chuck Enwinde,2019-01-31 05:31:00,247,That's a nice pickereye but I'm almost as impressed about the keeper perch.    And it looks like a fine spot for a beauty of a hut.  Looks like some thought went in to building that.  Mind sharing how deep you're set up in?  Strikes me as the kind of spot that could cough a big pike or two as well.
1039913,skidooseadoo,2019-01-31 15:31:00,4,"The hut was a nice build over this past summer. 8x10, 8 catch cover holes, perfect for 4 jigging and 4 dead sticking in the corners.. 12V solar with indoor and outdoor led lighting. Big buddy propane heat. 1000 lbs though. tricky getting her on the ice and moving. Winch helps. Sitting at 13.5ft on the edge on the quick rocky drop down to 15ft. "
