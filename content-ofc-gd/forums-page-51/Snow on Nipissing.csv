I would be more worried about trying to get through the bush or any trails if you have to. Once you get on the ice your quad will just blow right through it. Although, its starting to get so deep that you might be on the verge of plowing with the front end and then you arent going anywhere. Last weekend guys were on the ice with their quads no problem, but I think they just got another 25cm up there so it may change."
