Reports of my recent skunkings would be boring I'm sure. It was pretty windy on Simcoe yesterday and I again brought the wrong hut. I nearly died trying to pull my heavy flip last weekend on the north part of the lake in deep snow. So this time I brought a small and light popup only to find out its mostly glare ice and my flip would have been perfect. ? Setup in 32' and we were marking a few but not catching anything. We had five guys in three huts. I had to wait for the winds to die a bit before I could move shallower but I eventually got set up in  22 feet. I had one perch in the hut by 4 o'clock and I was packing up to leave. I had a minnow on a tungsten jig deadsticked while I was packing up. I reached for the power button to shut down my finder and right then had a good mark so I held off a second. I saw a tiny twitch in my line and set the hook. At first it felt like a large perch darting but I soon realized it was something bigger shaking its head so I backed off the drag and let it run a bit. Tougher than I thought to get its head into the 6"" hole but I eventually got it. I was so stoked! Catching a whitefish was my season goal. I'd hoped I'd learn and apply skill over the season but I did it through perseverance (over 50 hours on the ice so far this season) and dumb luck. I'll take it ? Can't wait to get back on the ice! I still want to catch one I can say was skill. PS: The ice was moving a little and created a shove near shore. We found a place to cross but it was a bit ugly by EOD. This was south shore.  "

1039998,Dutch01,2019-02-03 18:04:00,1431,The shove   
1039999,TJQ,2019-02-03 18:05:00,7806,Nice fish...  I would have expected more snow on the lake.
1040000,Dutch01,2019-02-03 18:09:00,1431,I know right? The north end has loads of snow.
1040003,misfish,2019-02-03 18:38:00,29133,"Yup, loads.  Nice fish buddy. Now catch one the real way, not the lucky way.LOL They are all luck."
1040004,Acountdeleted,2019-02-03 18:42:00,2562,Wow. Nice whitefish.
1040006,misfish,2019-02-03 18:58:00,29133,"See Jer, anyone can catch them."
1040007,Dutch01,2019-02-03 19:00:00,1431,Lol thanks!
1040033,Acountdeleted,2019-02-04 13:36:00,2562,"Ice fishing....... that's the sport that people with healthy, functioning knees do during the winter correct?  ........ Actually my knee isn't terrible now. Walking around mostly healthy. Doing my physio 2-3 times a day. Main reason why I haven't gotten out on the ice since surgery is I can't really sit for more then 20-30 minutes without everything getting sore and stiff. I figure I'll get out once for my overnight on Nippising in a month then maybe once more on my Laker Lake but that will be it for the year. I sure hope the whitefish are as feisty next year as they have been this year and last."
