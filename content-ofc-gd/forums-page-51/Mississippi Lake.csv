1039384,Justin C,2019-01-17 14:53:00,30,Hey there has anyone here fished Mississippi Lake. If so i would love to hear about it as i live 2 minutes from it. I am a beginner fisherman and would love to hear any advice on fishing there.  Thanks
1039395,BillM,2019-01-17 17:37:00,17367,I'd suggest searching Google 'Mississippi Lake fishing ontario'  
1039407,Lape0019,2019-01-17 19:12:00,647,"Hey Justin, I fish tournaments on Mississippi about once a year in the summer months. It is a very fun lake to fish. I target bass so am typically fishing shallow for largemouth are a bit deeper for smallmouth. I have seen the occasional pike in there too. What type of information are you looking for?"
1039408,smitty55,2019-01-17 19:13:00,928,Follow the crowds Justin. Most of the popular spots will have little villages by now. Watch out for Craig's Shore area yet though. That's where they went through last week.  Cheers
1039419,Justin C,2019-01-17 22:16:00,30,Thanks Um i don't mean ice fishing but i would love some info on any hot spots someone knows of that i can fish from the bank. P.s I bass fish.  Thanks

1039422,Lape0019,2019-01-17 22:35:00,647,Well... don’t know any hot spots from shore.  Im sure you could possibly catch some fish by the town launch but I don’t know of any other areas that’s aren’t owned.
1039423,Justin C,2019-01-17 22:48:00,30,Ok Thanks  Lape0019 Yes i have fished at the town launch there before. I have found one good spot at a public launch at the other side of the lake. The directions to get there are this:  You driving towards Perth on highway 7 turn of onto Con Rd 9A there is a public ramp there to fish from great spot. If anyone else knows a good spot for shore fishing and wants to help me it would be much appreciated as i am a beginner and do not know a lot about the lake.
1039426,OhioFisherman,2019-01-18 00:10:00,6623,"https://www.anglersatlas.com/place/102347/mississippi-lake Justin, there appears to be a couple of parks on the north end of the lake - river, both might have shoreline access? Here in Ohio that would be one of our bigger inland lakes, take a look on youtube, there are more videos of people fishing there. Not having a boat can limit you badly, but you can probably still catch fish and maybe you can hook up with some one fishing there with a boat that might not rather fish alone? LOL, if it was 2 minutes from my home and I could still fish I would be there!"
1039557,muskymatt,2019-01-22 01:30:00,2608,"Walleye, bass and crappie....snot rockets! Fish in the water and you will catch lol"
1039558,Justin C,2019-01-22 01:32:00,30,Thanks muskymatt.
1039562,OhioFisherman,2019-01-22 03:01:00,6623,"Justin, are you comfortable throwing soft plastic baits? If I was restricted to shore fishing I would be throwing a plastic worm or lizard for bass a lot, but you can use tubes and such also, just a lot of ways to rig them and they have caught a lot of fish for me."
1039568,Justin C,2019-01-22 14:09:00,30,Yes Ohio Fisherman that is what i primarily fish is Sencos and trick worms and a few tubes here and there never fished a lizard before but have Texas rigged some craws and stuff like that.  Thanks
1039570,OhioFisherman,2019-01-22 15:02:00,6623,"Justin, fishing a lizard is basically just like fishing a worm, just a bigger profile to the bait so, just my experience that the average fish tend to be a little bigger. A fan of Zoom lizards and Zoom u-tail worms myself, cheap and they caught fish, and you can just put them on a ball or mushroom style jig head and swim them over weeds and catch fish, even swimming them texas rigged slowly with just enough weight to keep them down will work."
1039571,Justin C,2019-01-22 16:27:00,30,Ok thanks I will try that. Thanks
1039574,OhioFisherman,2019-01-22 18:27:00,6623,"Justin, here is a video,   there are more out there. I usually used this style of jig head,  http://www.lurepartsonline.com/Online-Store/Worm-Jigs/Barbarian-Bullet-Nose-Jigs.html finding jig heads with a stronger hook than your typical Aberdeen hook in them used to be a problem. An exposed hook gives you a better hook up ratio, although that never seemed a problem for me even when texas rigging them."
1039581,Justin C,2019-01-23 01:34:00,30,Thanks I will do some more research. 
1039745,Moosebunk,2019-01-27 00:48:00,3970,"If fishing crappie you have to get permission. lol. Anyways, lake is super busy, holds all the above mentioned fish but even though it's the closest lake to my place, I still never fish it anymore.  Come summer it gets beaten to death... but guess the odd good one still gets caught.  Go for a drive and try different scenic spots you might be able to access along the river.  It goes for miles man..."
