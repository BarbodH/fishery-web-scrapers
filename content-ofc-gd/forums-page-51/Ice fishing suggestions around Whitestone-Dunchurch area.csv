1040087,AKRISONER,2019-02-05 18:03:00,5558,"Ive always heard Ahmic has decent fishing. Theres also always a few huts out in front of Duck Rock on whitestone lake itself. Easy road access from there too with plenty of snowmobile tracks to hike out onto the lake if you really wanted to.  Edit: always interesting...are you saying theres no fishing allowed on Wahwakesh? I was snowmobiling on it on saturday, and now that you mention it I dont think I ever saw any huts."

1040224,lunkerbasshunter,2019-02-08 01:27:00,2585,well worth the effort to get to crawford lake for crappie through the ice.  been a while but it was the most productive lake in the area.  got a few decent pike as well there. If it was summer i could give you way better tips but hardwater that is all I got.
