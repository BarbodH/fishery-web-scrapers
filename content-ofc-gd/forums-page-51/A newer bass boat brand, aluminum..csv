1039915,OhioFisherman,2019-01-31 16:56:00,6623,Most Affordable Bass Boat Ever?!?! Vexus Bass Boat Demo!! - YouTube 
1039916,Lape0019,2019-01-31 17:06:00,647,I've been following Vexus on Instagram and YouTube for quite some time. Not to mentions some other boards who have a dedicated sections on them. Their transom looks indestructible. Definitely looks like a very well built boat but I would expect nothing less considering who the major players in this company are.
1039919,OhioFisherman,2019-01-31 17:58:00,6623,"Lape, they look good and well built, time will tell? "
1039920,Lape0019,2019-01-31 18:03:00,647,"Just wish someone would bring them up here so we could walk through them. I am by no means in a boat buying situation (I just bought one last year...), but it would nice to be able to compare them to what is currently out there. My initial thought is there isn't much out there that is even close to the same style of boat. The Ranger 198P would probably be the closest followed by maybe Express? I believe they are supposed to be releasing their fiberglass boats at the classic this year as well so that should be interesting."
1039921,misfish,2019-01-31 19:06:00,29133,"Funny I came across this at lunch time I thought I heard the guy say that, Ranger was a major player with this boat. Or something like that. I will have to re watch the video clip."
1039922,Lape0019,2019-01-31 20:05:00,647,"Well, The lineage of this boat is all from the Wood Family. Most of the people involved in this are related or married into the Wood family and most of them left Ranger shortly after Johnny Morris took it over. Although I cannot confirm, I believe that many of the people that were working at Ranger have taken jobs at Vexus as well."
1039923,misfish,2019-01-31 21:50:00,29133,Thats what I heard. Took it as Ranger.
1039927,David Chong,2019-02-01 00:47:00,836,"Love what they'veÂ done with Vexus! The president is Keith Daffron who in Forrest Wood's grandson, Forrest is the founder of Ranger boats! Can't wait until they introduce their glass line!"
1039928,OhioFisherman,2019-02-01 00:50:00,6623,"Brian, as I recall Flippin AR was the home of Ranger boats. https://www.tradeandindustrydev.com/industry/manufacturing/news/ar-advanced-marine-performance-launches-new-brand-13490 Ya, it seems to be a Ranger boat product? Lape, maybe Range boat dealers will start carrying them, I believe Lund and Crestliner are both selling v hull aluminum bass boats now. https://www.lundboats.com/boat-series/pro-v-bass/ https://www.crestliner.com/bass-hawk/1850-bass-hawk/"
1039931,David Chong,2019-02-01 02:18:00,836,Vexus is located in Flippin AR same as Ranger but is definitely not a Ranger product although many employees there are former Ranger employees!
1039932,OhioFisherman,2019-02-01 02:31:00,6623,"http://www.ktlo.com/2017/12/01/new-fishing-boat-brand-to-be-manufactured-in-flippin/ You're probably right David, but it looks like Forrest was good with it? https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammy-wood-182915159"
1039934,Old Ironmaker,2019-02-01 03:48:00,8243,"I'm the last guy that needs a true blue Bass boat. But when I wanted one it was going to be a Ranger hands down only a Ranger. In my opinion after watching a short video it looks like all the players in this market is in for some competition. From what I saw, nice boat."
1039938,Lape0019,2019-02-01 15:09:00,647,"As David stated, this is not a Ranger product. Forrest Wood has not owned Ranger for quite some time although Ranger did use his likeness up until 2014-2015 I believe. The only ties to Ranger that Vexus has is that their upper management all came from Ranger when Johnny Morris bought Ranger, Triton and Stratos (fish Holdings LLC) from a Private Equity firm. As stated by David, Keith Daffron is Forrest Woods Grandson but there are more family connections to the wood family then just that I believe. "
1039939,Old Ironmaker,2019-02-01 15:44:00,8243,The former execs and managers at Ranger most likely had signed a non competition agreement as well as a non disclosure and had to wait an agreed upon period of time before they could return to the boat business.
