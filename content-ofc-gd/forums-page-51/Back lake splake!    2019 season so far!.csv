1040329,Meegs,2019-02-11 13:19:00,249,Went back to one of my favourite splake lakes yesterday.    Always nice to take a break from simcoe and do some relaxing fishing with no one else but buddies around!    Been a fantastic season so far catching some good numbers of some really quality fish!  First few pics were yesterday and rest are from January this year!    Just love how much fun the kids have had on some of these day trips!
