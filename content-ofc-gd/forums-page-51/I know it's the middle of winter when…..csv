I also start to get an idea as to day trips and possible overnighters for fins and/or feathers. This about the time I start to wonder if I should splurge on a fly-in or at least a very remote extended trip. The family summer vacation options. Do I need/want to replace any equipment and even what's ""new"" that I might want to try.  How about you?"

I do remember the good old days though, trying to get 30 - 50 guys to agree on some sort of a bass tournament schedule that was workable, trying to piece together info on open tournaments, planning a road trip to Toledo - Michigan to hit the tackle stores and stock up for the upcoming season, trying get vacations and tournaments to align, seeing what fun fishing options people were working on."
