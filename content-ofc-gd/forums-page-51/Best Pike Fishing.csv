Another drive to worth looking at is st Joesph, old post lodge is on the east side of the lake and there's a camp on pashkogan as well. St Joe is a great fishery with a lot less traffic then lac seul and its far better. Don't think you will have a hard time finding some big pike there."

1039441,adempsey,2019-01-18 04:51:00,1498,"I have a couple of suggestions. 1) Go in May or June. Big fish are shallow. September might work if you like trolling, but be prepared to work for them. 2) Forget American Plan. Added cost and it just bogs you down with schedules and mediocre food. You can BBQ everything and eat off of paper plates. Most of us don't want to cook or do dishes. I remember eating hotdogs for lunch and dinner 7 days straight (not recommended). 3) Go west of Nipigon (or to Lake Nipigon!) for improved chances at big fish. There are certainly some good choices in the east, but none are cheap. Although, Kag Lodge out of Nakina might be worth a look (rates are Canadian $ and I think they include tax, at least they used too, not sure now), maybe Brace Lake (rates also in Canadian $). 4) Pick a lake that is a good size, with a deep basin but with plenty of shallower bays and inflowing water. The bigger the better in my opinion. At least 10,000 acres. You want the lake to have pelagic fish for the pike to feed on - think ciscoes, herring, whitefish, smelt. That makes for some trophy fishing. Couple places worth a look in my opinion: https://oldpost.com/ https://www.thunderhook.com/ontario-fly-in-fishing/smoothrock-camp/ https://wildernessnorth.com/accommodations/strikers-point-lodge/ http://www.nighthawkcharters.ca/index.htm (Charter on Nipigon) https://www.northsuperiorcharters.ca/ "

There are pike in there, but generally pretty few and far between and I've never seen anything over 35""-40"". Most of the outfitters do not offer American Plan, though a couple do up around the Laniel area of the lake. And I will offer that Kipawa is a great lake, but it takes more than a few years to really learn the body of water and patterns of the fish depending on weather, fronts, time of day, etc. Hate to say it, but to get into the pike fishing I think you're looking for is not cheap.

I.e. second week of May through till the 3rd week in June. You also better have a guide or someone that knows where there are actually solid weedy bays otherwise you’ll find yourself driving around in uncharted water over a hell of a lot of rocks. In some ways it’s good because, to be honest at that time of year, find a shallow bay with weeds in it, there’s a great chance big momma is still hanging around nearby, but on the other hand, there are a bloody ton of shallow bays that don’t have a spec of life in them except maybe a few bedded up smallmouth hiding in the pencil reeds 2 feet from the waters edge. If you try fish it in July through august? Good luck. Then I’d recommend forgetting the pike fishing and instead enjoy some of the best smallmouth fishing the entire world has to offer. the benefits of GBay are 1. The drive is far more more reasonable than driving from Florida to Nipigong 2. You will find a totally different type of lodge, it’s going to be more cottaging than a fly in/far north outfitter. to me in some ways the experience of a northern outfitter is what it seems like the OP Is interested in, emulating his experience in the NWT if that’s the case go further north and catch a pile of Walleye and a ton of monster pike. or..shorten your drive and open up your horizons to catching some smallmouth, largemouth, Walleye and the occasional pike to boot! All while enjoying some of the most beautiful scenery on the planet.  also parry sound has ok laker fishing, but you didn’t hear that from me"

1039646,AKRISONER,2019-01-24 20:34:00,5558,"Wish I could help you out Lou, but to be honest, aside from a few locals...guides are few and far between on g bay once you get north of Parry Sound. I know of one guide in Pointe Au Baril, but personally I wouldn’t recommend him for pike, even if he was willing to drive you around. I’ve fished with him before but it’s mostly run of the mill stuff, things you’d easily do and figure out on your own. Plus his boat is a big old kingfisher. Not the best platform for fishing bass and pike.  My concern is that you may have people willing to “guide you” but I’m not so sure that their willingness equals results. Have you considered fishing the French river instead? I definitely know that there are multiple guides that offer services out of the area there. the complete lack of quality guides in my area is something that has had me thinking for a while that when the right time comes along, I may just end up making the jump to get the proper insurance and safety requirements to start guiding part time in the area. For the time being though, I’m still young and enjoying the fishing with my friends...but maybe the day when everyone moves on and has families and I’m left to fish alone, I will go full out. Ive tested the waters a few times with close friends at both my locals and on their home lakes and ive done a pretty good job. Some day...some day"

Maker a Laker I'm checking Air Ivanhoe.  It's a long drive up there to Foleyet, Ontario, but it does look like they have nice outposts.  We'd be doing our own cooking, and it appears (correct me if I'm wrong) that the boats at the outposts only have paddles, no motors.  I wonder how good Nemegosenda Lake is?  Probably it's pounded pretty hard by angling pressure.

1039263,scuro2,2019-01-15 07:20:00,904,Kesagami is probably too expensive and too pressured for it's size and the price. I would not suggest Kipawa if big pike are the goal. They are in there for sure but it is a damned shield lake and they take water levels right down in the fall which is not good for early spring spawning. I've been to a few camps there and found no ideal habitat or had a lot of success for pike. They are in ambush spots such as narrows etc. They are caught usually when folks troll for walleye or lakers! Nipigon is huge and beautiful but also a shield lake and prime pike spots are not easily accessible. That open water can be potentially dangerous in spring and big wind can create tide like conditions on wind swept shores! They used to do a cruiser rental that you would sleep in and they would tow a few boats that you could fish in once the cruiser was anchored. Meals were provided and that would certainly be a great experience and possibly in your price range once have enough people going. I always wanted to do that trip. The cruiser operated out of the southern bay. A lake like lake of the woods might work especially in the early spring. It could be one of those situations where it is the third target species and not specifically fished as hard. Spring would be good too before the cottagers are established. It is big...never fished it. 
1039269,angler lou,2019-01-15 13:55:00,10,"Scuro2 Thanks for the tips.  What do you mean when you say, '...they take water levels down in the fall'?  I've heard that Nipigon has its levels manipulated upstream, but I didn't realize that others are being manipulated (for flood control?) Let me know if you hear of the 'cruiser' option on Nipigon.  I had never heard of that.  LOTW was my first experience in Canada, and I loved the fishing there back in 1950, but I wonder how heavily fished it is.  I have heard of some big pike (and occasional muskie) being caught.  I guess success would depend on the guide one has. Jmeyer I checked out Onaman River Resort and maybe I should phone them to find out details, but their location appears to be many miles upriver from the lake so it would take at least half an hour of motoring just to get into the lake...and that would be with a big motor.  Most of these places max out at 30 HP which doesn't move a 16 footer very fast.  BTW I could not find any camps on the north shore of Nipigon."
