1039587,singingdog,2019-01-23 12:48:00,1047,"Both Jack and John were great. They knew the fishery, knew where to send a noob that just wanted to feel a tug on their line, and knew when to reward a valued customer with some ""inside"" information. Once Jack knew I was a C&R fisherman that didn't post hot spots he turned me on to some of the best fishing in the county. I returned the favor by sharing information with him in terms of what presentations were working and buying from him even when it was more expensive than big box or online."
1039652,chris.brock,2019-01-24 22:42:00,4053,"Well, Jack must of liked you a lot more than he liked me, lol, he didn't give me any tips a little gruff initially but a good guy though once you get to know him, I liked him and our conversations"
1039006,bobowski,2019-01-10 15:46:00,360,Hey guys. I have a boys trip planned to go to Mountain Lake in a week for 4 days. I have never fished the lake before. I know that there are Lakers and a few Walleye to be had. For anyone that has fished this lake before do you have any advice on how to get into some fish? Should we use tip ups for the Lakers? Unfortunately this lake is restricted to only one one line in the water per angler so just using a tip up would be kind of boring. Please let me know if you have any tips for me and my crew. It would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to PM me if you like. Thanks so much.
1039007,Jds63,2019-01-10 15:59:00,1365,"If its the Mountain Lake up near Minden , then do not go anywhere near the current by the bridge over Hwy 35 ... although I see guys setup huts close to the open water all season... not sure how far down that lake the current makes the ice sketchy ....I have never fished on the north end only the south end of the lake for that reason ... its been a hit and miss , we traveled by foot and covered a lot of area a few years ago , no luck with the white tubes did ok with minnows"
1039012,Garnet,2019-01-10 16:48:00,2056,She looks sketch near Hwy 35. The Vibrato doing good job on near by lakes. White tube 3# Berkley power bait is what I use.
1039017,jimmer,2019-01-10 17:12:00,2730,"The dreaded one line approach, I never really fully understand the reasoning to be honest with you.  Have two guys jigging with small spoons to attract and go with a simple tiny hook and split shot with a minnow for the other two lines.  Electronics really help on a lake like that to let you know what level the fish are hanging at."
1039053,bobowski,2019-01-11 00:08:00,360,Thanks so much for the info guys. I will let you know how we do.
1039214,mikeh,2019-01-14 01:54:00,824,"There is a bait shop on 35 almost across from kawartha dairies, nice people i'm sure they can give you some advice. I think there is a bit of current from 35 down to where it goes into horseshoe lake,"
1039220,Garnet,2019-01-14 11:25:00,2056,"Nice people in Minden Bait and tackle not much fishing help. Open at 7 am. If you are coming from Lindsay, Norland Bait and Tackle will work better for you. At the 4 corners NW corner Convenience Store just up the street you will see it from light."
1039222,singingdog,2019-01-14 12:40:00,1047,"The folks at Ogopogo resort are a great resource for ice conditions. They keep several huts all season, and keep a good eye on the ice. The folks at Minden Bait and tackle don't know the difference between a pike and a whitefish."
1039223,bobowski,2019-01-14 13:07:00,360,LOL. Thats good to know as that is where we are staying.
1039226,Jds63,2019-01-14 14:36:00,1365,yup ... not sure what the story is at Minden Bait but its kind of creepy ....
1039232,big guy,2019-01-14 16:25:00,414,"Pickerel in Mountain Lake? I know they're in Gull, are they all through the Hwy 35 lakes now?"
1039244,Garnet,2019-01-14 21:24:00,2056,Minden Bait and Tackle is well stocked with the right stuff. The husband must know a bit. I buy minnows early and the wife pulls that shift.
1039262,chris.brock,2019-01-15 05:32:00,4053,"I like the owners of Minden Bait. Nice people, good conversation, my dozen minnows is more like 2 dozen. I don't want my local bait shop giving out information and blowing up lakes. They must hear lots of stuff, but being tight lipped is good IMO. The previous owner Jack knew quite a bit but he was also tight lipped.  "
1039264,Chuck Enwinde,2019-01-15 07:56:00,247,"Me too, but then I like all tackle shops.  They actually have a really good selection for a little shop.  Maybe not great if you're looking for intel, but if you need bait or tackle, it's a good shop.  Norland Convenience, is also a good spot if you're not going as far as Minden."
1039266,singingdog,2019-01-15 12:36:00,1047,"Yep. Folks I know started catching through the ice with regularity about 4 years ago. I caught them downstream of there all fall, in spots where I have never seen pickerel before."
1039271,big guy,2019-01-15 14:54:00,414,"Interesting, will have to add it to my summer time bucket list. Always liked Mountain, easy access, a friend of mine (friend of a friend actually), that I got to know, donated the bottom end of my ice auger to the lake one day. Not sure how he did it, but when he brought it back up, all he had was the handle."
1039357,Garnet,2019-01-16 20:08:00,2056,I caught my deepest walleye couple years ago 106 ft just up stream.
1039549,manfish,2019-01-21 20:07:00,24,We used to catch whitefish in the south end east side in 50 feet We baited with salties the nite before we fished.Next morning guaranteed fish just using spreaders.Best day was 7 whities in 2 hours
1039550,AKRISONER,2019-01-21 22:03:00,5558,"lol try and chat with Dennis at Pointe Au Baril bait and tackle, youll be lucky to get a ""yup"" "
1039552,Rizzo,2019-01-21 23:07:00,4754,I find it odd that bait shop owners would not want to help. If I succeed I come back and I buy more bait.  I go out and have a crappy day I don't come back.
1039553,Rizzo,2019-01-21 23:09:00,4754,...as a fisherman I agree I don't want him giving out info on my favorite lake...but as a guy trying to make a living I would expect him to try and make some more sales to make a living. A bait shop owner not willing to help is like a guide hoping you catch nothing with him...doesn't make sense for someone trying to make a living from the sport
1039561,chris.brock,2019-01-22 02:17:00,4053,"I never thought of it that way, what you say makes sense. It's a small town though, if they were giving out too much information that would piss some people off and be bad for business too.  "
1039564,singingdog,2019-01-22 12:30:00,1047,"They aren't holding back info....they don't have it. I have overheard some of the discussions they have had with customers while trying to be helpful and it's quite entertaining. I once listened to the husband tell someone that lake X, which is probably the best multi-species lake in the area, ""probably doesn't have any fish in it, except where the river comes in."" Running any kind of retail shop is about serving customers and creating new customers. If all you have to offer is a tankful of minnows and the same lures/tackle as the CTire around the corner, you better have some other way to turn people on to fishing. Local knowledge is one of those things."
1039579,chris.brock,2019-01-23 01:05:00,4053,"I believe that. They bought the shop and then moved to town from somewhere else. I don't think the husband gets out and fishes that much either. One Saturday morning in the shop he said to me ""holy crap, did you see how busy Lake Z is?"" I said ""yeah, some dummy posted a glowing report on OOD from Lake Z last Tuesday, hence everybody from Toronto who fishes is now there"". Although this post might be better for business, the husband seemed to be really ticked off at this guy posting stuff like that.  What did you think of the previous owner Jack, singingdog? That guy was homegrown, fished a lot, knew a lot, had a circle of friends who fished a lot, but was very tight lipped. The owner before was John. Nice guy, more sociable, knowledgeable, but he still knew not to give out too much information.  "
1039586,Garnet,2019-01-23 11:41:00,2056,"It's still very important to engage people chat them up, find there interest. I've worked sportsman shows for 40 years and your products are just so so important. Hi how's your show going , Where do fish, What's your interest. I see rep's every show that would be fired in my booth and most at BPS/Cabelas, Sail would make minimum wages the knowledge people that get it would be paid more."
