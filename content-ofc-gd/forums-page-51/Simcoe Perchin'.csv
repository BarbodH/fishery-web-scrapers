Hopefully, we can catch 12 ""Big Jumbos"" on Sunday at the Canadian Tire Lake Simcoe Ice Fishing Championship! #HerePerchiePerchie #SlabGrabbers #NavionicsApp #SimcoeIceFishing #LiquidMayhem #HTIceFishing #GarminMarineCanada #DaiwaCanada    "

1040452,David Chong,2019-02-14 16:20:00,836,"That's a Slab Grabber! A jack spoon from McGathy's in Michigan, probably the #1 perch lure on Lake Simcoe at this time!"
1040454,OhioFisherman,2019-02-14 16:27:00,6623,"Thanks David, not an ice fisherman or any other kind of fisherman now, I thought it was some kind of slip float."
