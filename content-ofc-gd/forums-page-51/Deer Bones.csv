1040221,JoePa,2019-02-07 22:41:00,179,I figure that a lot of you guys go hunting in addition to going fishing - thought you might give me an idea about using deer bones to make soup - I just made myself a large pot of vegetable soup using beef bones - boy I'll tell you something - nothing like a nice hot bowel of soup on a cold winter day - the soup was fantastic - when I butcher my deer I usually throw away the bones - was wondering if any of you have use the bones to make soup and how did it taste - thanks
