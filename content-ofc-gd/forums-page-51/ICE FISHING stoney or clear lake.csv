1039775,bassman87,2019-01-27 23:55:00,586,Hello. I dont fish those lakes specifically but I reckon you'll have more responses if you formally introduced yourself and asked the question more specifically and politely. Goodluck
1039882,captpierre,2019-01-30 19:29:00,2521,Just panfish.

Ice is quite thick now.  Probably close to the thickest it will be in the winter.  Many Kawartha lakes that are quiet, no current areas are over 12 inches ice. Just like any Kawartha lake, you need to find public access spots and with navionics equipment see where to go that has the structure you are wanting.  But be sure that you know the water system or learn about it to ensure that location is a non-current area to have thick ice. As mentioned above, in this Zone, only pan fish are in season."

1040050,KawarthaAngler,2019-02-04 19:54:00,273,"Thanks for adding the info. But for those not overly familiar with the Trent Severn and particularly the OP's question, there ain't no Pike in Stoney/Clear. At least not that I've ever heard of ......"
1040061,Dutch01,2019-02-05 01:56:00,1431,Agreed. I catch em in balsam though so its only a matter of time til they move through the system.
