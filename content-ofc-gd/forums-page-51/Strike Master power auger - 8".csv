1040039,icefisherman,2019-02-04 17:10:00,952,"Looking for an 8"" Strike Master Lazer Mag (preferably) power ice auger, or just the drill bit ....bent my drill bit on Simcoe yesterday. Will try to straightened it but doubt it'll work very well. 	If someone has just the bit for sale (power head not working) it'll be great. Strike Master part # LPD-8. 	Of possibly complete auger in good condition.  	Feel free to PM me.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
