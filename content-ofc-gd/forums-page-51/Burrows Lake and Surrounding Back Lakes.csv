I tried looking online but there's little to no information out there regarding them. Any info is appreciated."

1040468,NAW,2019-02-14 21:31:00,4022,I've been on Burrows a few times in the last 10 years.  I found the fishing to be really slow.  The odd Bass.  Saw one dead pike floating.  But we fished most of the weekend with 3 guys and only caught a handfull.  Never fished it in the winter before.
