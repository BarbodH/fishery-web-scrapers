1039711,Jmeyer,2019-01-26 15:00:00,83,"Not much online at all, I did notice a slew of reviews on tripadvisor tho. All reviews were good for the base camp and fly ins, mostly great reviews on the operation, accommodations and experience with decent fishing. Looks like a good trip, not sure how they compare price wise to air Dale or white river air, American funds and no tax in the listed price would suggest a 7 day trip would be minimum $1200pp so it's not cheap"

1039737,chris.brock,2019-01-26 22:25:00,4053,"I haven't heard of anybody flying in with them, or anybody who's stayed at their drive in, it must be mostly American clientele. It would be a good idea to check out Air Dale and Hawk Air for comparison. All 3 fly out from Hawk Junction. "
