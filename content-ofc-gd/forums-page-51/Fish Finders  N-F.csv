1039683,Fisherman,2019-01-26 00:38:00,7201,Is it just me or are the regular graph f/f's  getting wider and wider at the expense of having better resolution when you're in deep water.  It seems like they're squeezing the picture vertically so they can accommodate multiple screens.   I think I'd rather have the height of the picture to see from top to bottom.
