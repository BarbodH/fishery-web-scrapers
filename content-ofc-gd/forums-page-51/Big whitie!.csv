1040238,Meegs,2019-02-08 12:07:00,249,Got this one afew weeks ago.   Measured in at  31.1/4” long and weighed in at 9.8 lbs bled out the day after.   Going to be my first whitefish on the wall.    Have caught them bigger years ago but haven’t got one close to this in quite some time!  You can probably guess what it was caught on lol.   Goby color!  
1040239,Dutch01,2019-02-08 12:12:00,1431,That's a tank whitey congrats!
1040240,misfish,2019-02-08 12:45:00,29133,Buddy HUGE  Looks like a baby Tarpon. LOL I remember losing one at the hole at JB probly 15 years ago. It was huge as well. 
1040241,Acountdeleted,2019-02-08 12:55:00,2562,Wow! What a monster. If that’s not advertising for the best lure to use on simcoe I don’t know what is. ?

1040268,PUMP KNOWS,2019-02-08 19:38:00,937,Tank!  How was the fight?
1040269,NAW,2019-02-08 20:43:00,4022,"Hey James, saw this on FB back when you caught it.  What a beast eh!  Was is a stocked fish?  If so did you do some research to see its age?"
1040272,Meegs,2019-02-09 00:08:00,249,Was zero fight really.   Didn’t think it was a big fish at all.  It it was a stocked fish from 2004!   Is what we figured!
1040284,cisco,2019-02-09 20:00:00,597,Congratulations on such a great whitefish!  Love the lure also. Got some whitefish on it but haven't chased em much with it.  This will change IF I ever get out with all these winds/cracks/cold/warm snaps!!
