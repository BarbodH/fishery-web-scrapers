161501,Nanook,2008-02-18 02:28:00,565," Glad ya mised it Glen. Keep ya head down EH !!. We had one pass 5 miles from us once when we were down there. The howling wind and shaking mobile, were quite enough for us. lots of damage where it hit. I'll take the snow !!!"
161507,Mike the Pike,2008-02-18 02:44:00,3421,Be safe Dog just walk around with the boat anchor you should stay on ground although you may look like the flyin Redneck.  See what your missin up here.  
161595,ccmtcanada,2008-02-18 14:44:00,7971,"Glad to hear you were ok again Glen, but I was more concerned with your boat...LOL.  Just kidding of course.  I never used to care about those tornado warnings in the southern US....but now I always check to make sure you've been online recently!!!"
161616,lew,2008-02-18 16:18:00,12767,"I was watching CNN this morning Glen and they were showing the aftermath of those tornado's down your way, and it's just hard to believe how much damage is caused by those things on such a regular basis.  They were talking to one lady who had basically lost everyhing she owned.  I spose we complain alot up here about the snow & cold, but at the end of the winter, the snow melts, the weather warms and we've still got our homes and everything else we started with, but those tornados hit and you've lost absolutely everything in seconds.  I've been thru 4 hurricanes but at least there's a warning their approaching, but those darned twisters drop from the sky and wipe you out in an instant.  Good to see you & yours are safe again after another bout with those things."
