160935,aplumma,2008-02-16 00:30:00,6896,I was driving down I95  when i passed a camper with 2 ft of snow on its roof. I was puzzled until I read the Quebec license plate. I guess it never a bad time to want a little warmer weather. I waved as i drove by and in their best Hawaiian shirts they grinned and waved back. I hope they enjoy their trip.   Art
160941,Roy,2008-02-16 00:38:00,13728,I probably know them Art. They're delivering snow to Florida. God bless'em and their pointy lil' ears.
160948,Big Cliff,2008-02-16 01:03:00,6899,"Art, we don't have anywhere else to put it, we have to ship it South."
160951,douG,2008-02-16 01:24:00,2693,"If you need more, jes let me know, provide fedex acc't #, etc.  We can have that delivered right some dam quick."
160955,ccmtcanada,2008-02-16 01:40:00,7971,Snow?? What snow???  
160966,Nanook,2008-02-16 02:21:00,565,"Ya better believe we got snow !!As much as I've seen in the last 10 yrs. A rough guess would be around 48 ins so far,and it aint over yet."
160970,Vanselena,2008-02-16 02:48:00,269,Yup we get some.  http://keithf.homedns.org/snow/top%20of%20...tanthony-01.jpg
160974,GbayGiant,2008-02-16 03:01:00,1780,"Yeah, if it wasn't so mild and didn't rain that one week this winter we'd be buried in it."
160988,Mike the Pike,2008-02-16 03:54:00,3421,The snow bank on my front lawn is so high from snow removal it is now as high as the roof of my minivan.backing out of the driveway has become a challenge cause we can't see down the street .look on the bright side water levels will be nice and high come the spring.
161009,Badger Shark,2008-02-16 05:11:00,291,9+ FEET here in Ottawa so far this winter and counting with another 20 to 30 cm on Monday. 30cm=1 foot for our friends in the south who dont know the metric system  .  1971 we had over 14 feet which is the most on record here I believe and 1977 there was I believe around 11 feet.  It would be kinda cool if we got close to those amounts this winter.  But in all honesty I need spring!
161028,Mike the Pike,2008-02-16 12:28:00,3421, I remember the big storm in 1971 badger it was the one time snowmobiles out numbered cars on the roads.  I was 5 yrs old but remeber the snow being as high as our windows on our house.My snowblower is working hard this year.  
161079,Badger Shark,2008-02-16 18:15:00,291,"Yep Mike, there were kids sliding off their roofs and people had to dig what looked like tunnels from the doors of their houses, that was cool."
161097,pikehunter,2008-02-16 21:13:00,1659,I was just out driving and saw that the pickup in front of me had Florida plates partially covered with snow. I don't get it? So many northerners are wishing they were someplace warm and sunny and those 2 clowns are up here slippin' and slidin' around! Go figure eh?
161103,bassboy,2008-02-16 21:58:00,161,    Thats a great picture Cliff!!!  And yes.....we can send LOTS of snow your way if you would like.....in fact its almost getting to the point where some of us would even PAY to ship it somewhere   Bill
161109,aplumma,2008-02-16 22:44:00,6896,well if my credits good go ahead and ship us about 10 inches down here to Virginia and I will send an early breath of warm air as soon as I can.  Art
161114,danc,2008-02-16 23:16:00,4677,Snow? I wish. It doesn't snow much when it's always -20.
161211,Tarzan's Jane,2008-02-17 11:59:00,1183,Yep plenty of snow here....smells really nice out.  Do you not get any snow?
161265,aplumma,2008-02-17 15:17:00,6896,Actually we are behind in our snow this year. We have had it snow twice so far with only 3-6 inches each time. Without the snow we will get behind in our ground water and have another year of low flow in the rivers. We seem to have more ice storms the last few years were the wet comes from the South and the North sends down some cold air at the same time. When we have snow we usually have a nice white ground cover for a day or two then it warms up enough to melt it off then a few weeks later a new blanket  comes. I lived up further North in Michigan were it snowed and it was white then dirty white and did not melt for along time it was not as much fun in my opinion. I guess if you focus on only one aspect of a regions weather it is easy to dislike it because the balance to Michigan was the nice cool summers and the longer daylight was very nice.   Art
