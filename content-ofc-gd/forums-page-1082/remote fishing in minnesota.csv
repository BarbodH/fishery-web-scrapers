161138,danc,2008-02-17 00:23:00,4677,Where are you coming from Bob?? I live 30 miles north of the Minnesota border in Ontario. I frequently travel the highway to the border and it's packed with USA anglers towing boats in the summer. Many with Minnesota plates. There's a reason for that. Go the few extra miles to the best fishing on the planet. Everybody else does.

161331,Whopper,2008-02-17 18:00:00,2174, LOL Dan well I'm one of them. NWO Ontario sure has endless oppertunities when it comes to fishing won't argue that one at all. Don't really know how remote your going to be able to get staying in Minnesota and if your planing on doing a fly in from there you'll most likely limit your choices because of the border crossing/ customs deal. If you really want to stay in MN do a search there still some decent oppertunities available but nothing like what available north of TBay. If your interested I can share a few things with you just send me a pm.  Good Luck in your search
