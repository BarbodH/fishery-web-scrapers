Hiding or destroing it does not help, it reapear again in the least expected moment ( like hooking the boat to car )  . This time the list was very short, but when I've looked at it I  1. Laminate floor in one bedroom and foyer upstairs.  2. Hardwood (oak ) stairs.  No big deal with laminate but the stairs??????. Well, I can always turn to the pros. After getting some estimates  I've decided to do it myself ( I have some woodworking tools ) I've spent ""few"" hours in the garage cutting, glueing, jointing, planing, sanding, staining, and just today I've put final touches to the new stairs. I did it for about 1/3 of the lowest estimate. Constructive criticism accepted        "
