161218,taper,2008-02-17 12:41:00,611,Did any one else see the moon last night? It was showing a very pronounced ring around it. A fair distance out and almost cloud looking but definitely surrounding the moon. I wondered if it was a reflection on clouds a certain distance away. Tried to get a couple of shots of it but with my limited camera skills they did not show up.
161220,Greencoachdog,2008-02-17 12:44:00,8163,I would say it was a reflection off of ice crystals in the atmosphere.

Those couds are about 5 - 7 miles up, where the temp is about 70 degrees below zero, so the clouds are made of ice crystals.  The Moons light passes through the crystals like light pasing through a prism, so you get a halo. Some are small and some large.  The large halo usually means precipitation sometime during the next 36 hours.""  Taken from: http://en.allexperts.com/q/Astronomy-1360/...around-moon.htm"
