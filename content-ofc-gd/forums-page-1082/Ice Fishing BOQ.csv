161276,young_one,2008-02-17 15:38:00,620,"Feb 16 Bay of Quinte First trip of the year, we originally planned for Trenton rivermouth, but it was way too risky.  Thanks to Ron from Skevy's, he directed us to Big Bay, where the ice was very safe. For anyone who is new to the area, I highly recommand dropping by the tackle store, it's professional, friendly, and informative.  With my parents and 2 family friends, we covered a huge area with ten holes. (Early Family Day outing)  Ron told us the area would be, ""pickerals or jumbos."" Sure enough, we connected the jumbos. As for the walleye...well, next time Most of the fish were caught using pickeral rig(spreader) with a tip-up application.  First fish caught through ice!  Excuse the background, if it gives too much information. Met a board member who was fishing the area as well, ""bricknblock"" Thanks for your help with the auger, and looking forward to fish with you in the future.  My new ice-auger, Jiffy - 2HP Stealth STX  broke down after drilling a dozen holes or so. (Gearbox problem)   How come everything big I purchase from BPS always brakedown on the first outing. (ex.Tracker boat in the spring) Gonna go to BPS this afternoon, hopefully I can work something out.  "
