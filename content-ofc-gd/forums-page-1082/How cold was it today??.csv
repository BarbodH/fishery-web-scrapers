160932,danc,2008-02-16 00:18:00,4677,"It was probably close to -50 with the wind chill today. So cold that when I shut this door at my job today, the paint shattered and fell off in a million tiny fragments. Honestly.  "
160937,Roy,2008-02-16 00:35:00,13728,"Dang! That IS chilly, Dan. In the banana belt here I woke up to -13 and 5-6"" of poop on the ground. It shot up to zero  by noon then promply came back down to seasonal temp of -10. Cold isn't too bad, it's the wind/humidity that gets to me.  ps. Protect that cam lens!"
160942,danc,2008-02-16 00:51:00,4677,"Roy, this February has been a reminder of winters from the past. We've had more frigid weather lately than I can remember. -30 tonight again. I'm staying in the house until Monday. Make that Tuesday. I almost forgot about the new NASCAR recovery holiday.  And the photo was taken with my cel phone. I wouldn't bring any of my better cameras out in this weather!!  Have a great weekend Bud and stay warm..."
160945,ccmtcanada,2008-02-16 00:54:00,7971,"We haven't had winter since 1999-2000 so I suppose we were due!  The nasty stuff coming for Sunday/Monday is looking like freezing rain and rain for Southern Ontario, but snow for the north!!"
160946,tbayboy,2008-02-16 00:54:00,1497,"Yikes, thanks for reminding me why I left Thunder Bay Dan (ok so maybe it was more job related but still).  All of my buddies back home are thinking the same as you - reminds them of days in high school before we were driving and having to wait for the bus or walk to school in -40 wind chills.  Ahh memories, and it was uphill both ways too!"
160952,brkygetr,2008-02-16 01:25:00,425,"yes it is cold....nostril freezing cold! ...still made it out on the ice this aft during the balmy -24 of the afternoon. basically an excuse to get out of the house and stare at the t.v. (Vex). Now I am home in the warmth cookin some venny, drinkin' a pop thinkin' bout how cold I am gonna be at 6:30 tommorrow morn  brkygetr"
160959,nofish4me,2008-02-16 01:49:00,404,"Ya, I remember walking to school in -40Â° weather, in 2' of snow, and it was uphill both ways."
160960,Joey,2008-02-16 01:52:00,9122,"Well quit slamming the door then Dan  Yep, she was pretty bitter out there.  Joey"
160973,Greencoachdog,2008-02-16 02:58:00,8163,Aww c'mon Dan!... it wasn't that cold!!! I mean it was kinda cool sometimes when the sun would go behind the clouds and the wind would blow.. but not really that bad. 
160985,Mike the Pike,2008-02-16 03:44:00,3421,So far this year I have used my 5 year old snowblower more this winter than all the 4 previous winters combined.  Hey Cliff give us a skating rink update will ya Bud?

161036,Greencoachdog,2008-02-16 13:31:00,8163," That is the ""Bait Stealer"" Joey, they can be a PITA sometimes!"
161696,irishfield,2008-02-18 22:22:00,26272,-31C on Saturday Morning. Lost the end off my left ear lobe to frostbite...and I even had a sled helmut on while going up the lake at 25MPH. It's all that Ron guys fault! LOL
