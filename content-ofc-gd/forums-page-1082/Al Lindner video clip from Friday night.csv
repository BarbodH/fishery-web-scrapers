161489,Garyv,2008-02-18 01:50:00,547,I watched the Linders show this morning on WFN and to me he's still the best.  When we had the video store I brought in all the In Fisherman tapes of different species for rental.  I learned more from those tapes and on occasion still look at them.  I was sad when they sold the magazine a few years back...what a fountain of information.
