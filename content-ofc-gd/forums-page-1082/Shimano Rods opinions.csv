161703,fishindevil,2008-02-18 22:39:00,6254,"Well if you have the convergence rods and you like them,well for a few more dollars you can get a compre !!!! the difference is like night & day they are all around $ 100 bucks or so !!! and they are amazing rods with awesome sensitivity !!!   so for a few more than what you would pay for the cumara,i believe they are around 60 bucks,man you gotta go the few dollars more you will not regret it,a great rod will up your catch rate too,its amazing,and you know its like the old saying goes:  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!!!    cheers"
161706,Rich,2008-02-18 22:41:00,3927,"Compre's are sweet. My flippin' stick is a Compre. If it ever breaks, I'll definitely buy another one. Worth the extra few bucks."

161732,Roy,2008-02-18 23:10:00,13728,"Compre here too. I have 4 of them, they handle well and I trust them. I'm sure that there are some other good rods in that same price range but I know the Compres so I'm sticking with them."
161745,mattyk,2008-02-18 23:50:00,2110,i love my compre musky rod.
161777,JPD,2008-02-19 01:05:00,296,"The Cumara rods are Shimano's new bottom contact Premium rod. I have used them and they are incredible for both lightness and sensitivity. These rods are developed with split grips, high density foam, SIC guides and im-10 graphite and are above the Crucial's. The also have a lifetime warranty.  Depending what you want to do with it, there are 8 casting and seven spinning models available. Nothing super heavy and nothing ultra light.  If you let me know what lures or species you plan on using it for I can help you out with picking the right size and action.  JP"
