Started drilling holes all around until I finally found one that was producing a steady line of perch.  I was able to stay on the same hole for about 2.5 hours, catching perch quite steadily, and even kept 7 to take home.  I was hoping and hoping for an eye or two to show up, but no luck.  The temperature had risen from 14 to 35 in a matter of 4-5 hours!  All in all, it was a enjoyable day. "
161375,Joeytier,2008-02-17 20:03:00,3990,"Also, all fish were taken on an orange hauger spoon.  The cheap tape was peeling off by the end of the day, and this was the first trip I had used it."
161382,Greencoachdog,2008-02-17 20:14:00,8163,Good report and great pic of fat fish!!!  I kinda like it when the fish tear up one of my lures!
161384,mattyk,2008-02-17 20:15:00,2110,those are some chunky looking perch.
161385,Joeytier,2008-02-17 20:16:00,3990,"Yeah, it definitely puts a lot confidence in that one bait. I just cleaned all those perch, and every single one was female and full of eggs."
161391,nelly,2008-02-17 20:25:00,256,"Nice looking jumbo. Did you see anyone catch crappie? BTW, I think you need to adjust the dates on your camera."
161393,Joeytier,2008-02-17 20:29:00,3990,"It's an old camera, I didn't want to take the new one outside in the rain  . I've heard lots about crappie getting caught, but I've yet to even see one personally. I wish I did, they can fight really good."
161401,gone_fishin,2008-02-17 20:42:00,481,"during daylight hours the only thing i've caught on Scugog is Perch and LM Bass, actually i did get 1 Walleye. Although most Walleye and Crappies are caught as the sun is going down, or right into the night.  Good job on those Perch. There are a lot of 10-12 inch Perch coming out of Scugog this year. It's been a great winter for that lake so far!"
161405,Joeytier,2008-02-17 20:46:00,3990,"Yeah, the only trip I caught walleye on Scugog so far this year has been in the evening."
