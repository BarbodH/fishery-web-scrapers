161682,Corey,2008-02-18 21:20:00,355,I think for you they will work as good as any other lure you use.
161683,Mike Pike,2008-02-18 21:21:00,1332,I love those!!!  Just wish I had a room big enough for 'em.  They'd make a nice addition to a large rec room.
161689,glen,2008-02-18 21:51:00,2641,My friend and i where talking about those yesterday.  If they were half that size maybe.  Might be good for sharks though.
161690,Chris,2008-02-18 21:53:00,405,You'll notice a decrease in your gas mileage trolling one of them around.
161693,Roy,2008-02-18 22:04:00,13728,Those Rapalas aren't tuned and can't be tuned. Save your money. At 3mph they blow out and roll.
