161144,danc,2008-02-17 00:46:00,4677,This might have something to do with it.  
161153,danbouck,2008-02-17 01:29:00,4380,That'll do it!
161154,Daplumma,2008-02-17 01:31:00,1961,That is one incredable machine!I could have my firewood cut up for a year in an hour or two.Looks like they are using it on new growth stuff.Prolly saves lives of loggers in the long run. Joe
161173,Clampet,2008-02-17 02:38:00,1947,I have seen an awfull lot of wanton waste of paper in the way businesses handle their document management.  I estimate between 30-50 percent of printed matter ends up in the recycler unnecessarily.
161179,fishindevil,2008-02-17 03:00:00,6254,Man that thing can sure cut em & stack em !!!!!....
161195,Deano,2008-02-17 04:12:00,767,"I posted a video a little while back, it's another extreme machine that hauls the logs out of the bush, pretty incredible machines.  "
161199,OhioFisherman,2008-02-17 05:24:00,6623,"They show a program on the History channel about logging, pretty incredible what some of those machines can do to a forest and even though we need wood probably not a good thing."
161203,waterwolf,2008-02-17 06:29:00,556,"take trees of mature quality. clear-cut ,,,, who -the-hell made this up????? diversified forests are the way to go ,, man-made or not .    talk to the farmers ,, the original conservationalists . my grandfather never ran out of wood on his 100 acres ,,selling to the mills ."
161206,waterwolf,2008-02-17 06:47:00,556,it's not  that far off .. forestry doesn 't have to be a negative...
161223,gekhunter,2008-02-17 12:48:00,61,nice machine.  makes those trees look like twigs
161257,outllaw,2008-02-17 14:44:00,1232,funny . the richest woman in china became that way. from importing our north american paper waste to be re-cycled.. we have a long way to go. depleting resources is a north american habit.
161312,Cookslav,2008-02-17 17:25:00,1457,"Oh man...its a real live Transformer!!! That thing is crazy quick and effecient.  The faster we can take 'em away, the less time to re-grow we have.... Here's an idea....  Can we not form our own little version of OPEC? Timber Supply is running low so lets jack the rates for Canadian lumber. If they can do it with oil, why can't we do it with lumber...or water for that matter.  Let start a price war, and see if we can get some cheaper gas LOL!"
161314,Casey123,2008-02-17 17:29:00,461,"Tree Mongers, UNITE!!!!"
161326,danc,2008-02-17 17:55:00,4677," Sawmills are big business up here, but most of them are shut down right now. The strong Canadian dollar and the economic slowdown in the US are to blame."
161344,Cookslav,2008-02-17 18:40:00,1457,"Ya closed, or ""reduced production"" Plants are kind of bitter sweet... Less cutting is the sweet, no jobs is the bitter part.  Can't have it both ways I s'pose"
161370,Joeytier,2008-02-17 19:55:00,3990,Our forests are disappearing because corporations need advertisements to send out to millions of people 10 times a day.
161402,Greencoachdog,2008-02-17 20:42:00,8163,"Forrestry is a renewable resource... if you plant it back!  You gotta love a mean green machine like that!!!... John Deere Rules!!!  Can you imagine what that thing would do to a ""Tree Hugger""?"
161406,Joeytier,2008-02-17 20:48:00,3990,"Yes, renewable... A tree in the boreal forest takes at least 100 years to grow to a size able to harvest again. It's just not that simple although I wish it was. Governments need to implement more regulations on recyclable materials on industry, in my opinion. Individuals by them self really can't make a difference."
161420,Greencoachdog,2008-02-17 21:31:00,8163,"  Sure it is!... if you cut a tree for harvest, plant one back! If the loggers of 100 yrs. ago had had the foresight there wouldn't be any problems... you could cut 100 yr old trees every year!"
161422,Joeytier,2008-02-17 21:34:00,3990,"I see your point. I don't mean to sound like a nag, but climate change is greatly affected by deforestation, whether you believe it or not.  I'm a strong believer in protecting our woodlands, and for me this means smarter use of timber."
161424,Joeytier,2008-02-17 21:36:00,3990,"But back on topic, that is one incredible machine!"
