The river was “very” fishable and although it rained off and on all day, the +5 weather and the hard fighting trout made the day one to remember!  Water colour was a green/gray and the river had lots of small ice chunks floating around.  Live Minnows and skein roe bags tied in pink, white, yellow and orange is what we caught the fish with. This time of year we’ve been doing much better in the afternoon.  Yesterday, we had to work for the fish in the morning, but after Lunch the fishing really picked up!  In the early morning the water temperature was 32.1, by 1:00pm the slight increase to 32.5 made all the difference! One of biggest misconceptions of the Niagara River is that you can’t catch fish unless the water is clear! In fact the fishing can be very productive with stained water and proper presentations.  If the water isn’t brown, and or pure mud it’s fishable. General guide line, if you can see the prop on the outboard motor you can catch trout!  See you on the River,"
