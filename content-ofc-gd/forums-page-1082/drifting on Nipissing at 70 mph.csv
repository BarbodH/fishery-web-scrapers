161256,Greencoachdog,2008-02-17 14:44:00,8163,  ... and they will continue to refuse to bite as long as you're raisin' hell on top of the ice.
161268,Muskieman,2008-02-17 15:24:00,2472,oddly enough they started to bite shortly after..
161289,Canuck2fan,2008-02-17 16:14:00,1444,"Can't be any different than fishing a river mouth and nothing it biting then a tug goes out and bang 5 minutes later 2 or 3 fish get caught. I think the noise, and vibration the tug makes ticks the fish off so they get a agressive. (Or it stirs up food for the bait so the big fish come into feed on the minnows) Anyhow I have seen it enough to see it as a good thing when a little noise is made."
161316,Cookslav,2008-02-17 17:38:00,1457,"I've actually heard that before and seen it work once as well....but being only one time, it could be complete coinsidence? The fishing started slow so the guys I was fishing with got on the sleds and let 'er rip zigging and zagging through and around the area we were fishing....I though they were nuts, and figured the fishing was going to be even worse.  Well wouldn't you know it...the bite came on HARD no more then 5 minutes after they turned the machines off. We landed 18 Pike in the next 3 hours. They say the noise, and commotion gets the Bait fish frazzled, and darting around, which in turn gets the fish going.  Now mind you we were in 6-8 feet of water...the water depth probobly maks a difference."
