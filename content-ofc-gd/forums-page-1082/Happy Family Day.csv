161564,lew,2008-02-18 13:01:00,12767,"Never said that before  Are you one of the lucky ones to have today off, or are you working ??"
161569,Seaweed,2008-02-18 13:10:00,135,Federal Worker in Ottawa here Lew... and yep I'm working today.  Although the Good Lord might have other plans for me ... or at least for my morning.  I went to hop in the truck this morning and low an behold there is a flat tire.  I just checked pressures on Friday too when I got the oil changed on her.  Go figure... oh well GM roadside assistance is on the way and will have it changed in no time.  Everyone enjoy your day off...
161570,fishing n autograph,2008-02-18 13:12:00,2540,"yep, gotta work...night shift and rain...gonna be fun  Anyone live in Stouffville so I can come hang out lol"
161573,bassdreamer,2008-02-18 13:26:00,128,"good morning Lew.city worker and  i get every monday off.heading too bass pro shops later today with the wife to do some shopping,if its open?"
161575,taper,2008-02-18 13:27:00,611,"I'm off today Lew, but I really think the government dropped the ball on this one. How do you call it Family day when a ton of people don't get it off, so families are not together.  Still I'll take the day."
161578,Fisherman,2008-02-18 13:43:00,7201,"Don't think the Gov't droped the ball entirely, some onions don't have it written into their agreements, (suffer ya swines for a change) and are crying the blues, some companies have other options."
161584,Hookset,2008-02-18 14:19:00,367,Well since I'm reading this at work...I must not have it off  Maybe I can get out early. Happy family Day to those who get it. Lucky Sods lol.  Hookset.
161585,Hookset,2008-02-18 14:20:00,367,"oh ya and I'm not in an Onion either, so I guess I'm not a swine...sheesh someone needs to take a nap.  Hookset."
161594,Riparian,2008-02-18 14:43:00,269,Im at work too.  I dont think that its the provincial or federal governments fault that my company dosent recognize a provincial holiday.  I really think every one in ontario should get it off just like the rest of the stat holidays.
161600,Joey,2008-02-18 15:05:00,9122,"I'm at home, and enjoying every moment of it.  I know my mailman has to work.  He said they had signed a contract before Family Day was brought into place.  Sucks being him as usually on some holidays I'm at work and the mail is not delivered and gov't offices are not open.  Its nice for a change.  On another note, I see the weather is following suit and being miserable for a long weekend, some things never change  Joey"
161612,ccmtcanada,2008-02-18 15:38:00,7971,"I'm home today.  Went to a local trib mouth with Bly at first light and drifted some pretty muddy, fast moving water, knowing I wasn't going to catch anything, but it was better than a day at the office!!!  Tried for about an hour and then we went for breakfast at a local greasy spoon.  Came home, did a hand print of my 5 year old in plaster, and I think later we're going to bake cookies together.  Nothing else really planned, just spend the day together."
161614,Guest skeeter99,2008-02-18 15:52:00,0,hey dont complain  if you must know all the provinces except ontario and alberta had 14 holidays recognized  most ontario and alberta employers gave 2 floater days  **1 deversity and another of your choice**  while the rest of the provinces had 15 recognized for quite a few years now   now 'family day' has been created in ontario and alberta only the rest of canada is working today boys!!!!  now we are even across the board 15 recognized days across canada  mind most employers in ontario took away a floater day now you only get a diversity day
161624,taper,2008-02-18 16:54:00,611,Yep skeeter at work we get the extra day on most of the long weekends through the summer making them 4 days off. When the new holiday was announced it was in our contract that because we already receive more than the mandated number of days we had to give up the Friday of May 24 weekend to get this one. Still a day off can never complain about that.
161625,mistyriver1,2008-02-18 16:57:00,600,"Yep, I'm off Lew.  As Skeeter said, my work just deducted one of our floater days.  I don't care, it's nice being off with the family.  Kind of a lazy weekend had a fish fry last night and the 4 of us are going bowling in a few minutes."
161635,Riparian,2008-02-18 18:11:00,269,"I get no such ""floater days""  Man that would be sweet."
161638,fishindevil,2008-02-18 18:22:00,6254,Im a custodian for the school board and i have it off as well !!!   even though it wasnt in our contract...so im lovin every minute of it !!!   cheers all
161655,Radnine,2008-02-18 19:03:00,1538,Hi Everyone Like Fishindevil I am in the education sector. Grateful for what we get already and grateful for this day. Best wishes to all!
161663,jediangler,2008-02-18 19:47:00,1923,"I didn't get today off either, but I booked a vacation day to stay home with my 7yr old daughter. Too bad the wife has the day off or it would have been really enjoyable."
161670,Crazyhook,2008-02-18 20:17:00,1154,Happy F day to everyone!
161673,douG,2008-02-18 20:21:00,2693,"I made brunch for the girls and their boyfriends, pancakes with initials on them, bacon, strangled eggs and mimosas.  Then we went bowling to find a 1 hour wait, so we did plan B, full contact Monopoly.  Not pretty."
161678,tapout,2008-02-18 20:49:00,166,  Hope your wife doesn't read the board
161680,FishFinder,2008-02-18 21:01:00,481,"lol, I dont think he was kidding"
161833,Moosebunk,2008-02-19 02:42:00,3970,"Yep, worked it... was more than happy to for 12 hours at a sick rate."
