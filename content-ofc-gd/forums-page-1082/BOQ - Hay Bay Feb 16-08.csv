161161,superdad,2008-02-17 02:02:00,353,"Was out to fish today with Laker John, BayBoy and myself around 0915. Fished an area unknown til recently and we heard it had produced some fish recently.  It was a Beautiful day without any wind, we didn't put gloves on til after 1300.  The morning produced a pair of nice sized perch.  Around 1300, we had a friendly visit from a C/O on a Skidoo, License and driver permits produced - all is GOOD.  The C/O left and Bayboy had a 'Fish On' and we scrambled to get the fish up out of the hole ( the ice is 15-18 inches) and it was a beauty.     He's on a HOT Streak..... with the Sidewinder...............  We fished and fished and finally I had a GOOD strike and with quite a tussle, the fishs' head appeared and Laker John scooped thefish out.  Hey, what do you know a PB for a hard-water walleye for Superdad, a doubledigit......    We weren't getting many hits and the conversation lagged as the humour wasn't there with no bites.....  Around 1515, BayBoy hits another - landed this one and hey-what's that - Another PB..........    The weather was changing with a squall coming in from Picton and so we headed back to shore  around 1615.  We had gone 3 for 4 for the day - the fish certainly weren't biting like mad, But, we came away happy.  Stay Tuned - 13 days of Quinte fishing left until May3rd (for walleyes)"
