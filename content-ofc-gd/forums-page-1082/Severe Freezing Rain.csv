161249,Woodsman,2008-02-17 14:22:00,1286,Just an alert. The forecasted freezing rain is now happening. Just got home after a scary ride. All fine when I made a short run into town. Then it hit. The usual 7-8 min drive from the edge of town took 40 mins. Main highways are passable at half speed. Secondary roads are a disaster (which I live on). Even at 20 km/h I was going sideways at times. Little to no ground wind here or it would be twice as bad. Storm should be now hitting the Toronto area. It is moving in a northeastern direction at about 80 km/h. Be Safe Stay Home  Rick
