161149,bucktail,2008-02-17 01:15:00,1857,Since we are all wasting time for another 6 weeks till old man winter at least takes a break I was wondering what everyones goals were for 2008. Other then getting out more do you have a specific goal or personal best. I have had a few good years and my PB list is getting tougher and tougher but I think it will be a 20lb Brown or 55 inch muskie. That and finding new places on Gbay
161151,danbouck,2008-02-17 01:27:00,4380,"My main goal is to go fishing at least once a week without dealing with work.  as for fish my goals are my first musky, walleye and salmon. A 6lb bass, 40 inch pike and a 10lb bow  and most of all I want my son to catch his first fish!"

161176,Rich,2008-02-17 02:54:00,3927,"Catch a 20lb pike in LPB, 20lb carp in the mighty lynn, 20+ channel cat (didnt get any last year), 50 inch musky, and fill the freezer with perch. lol"

161181,danc,2008-02-17 03:10:00,4677,"I must be getting old. In fact I know that I am. My fishing goals don't involve big fish, although they are welcome. My goals are to have some memorable outings with good friends. I'm at the point in life where I'd rather see one of my buddies catch a trophy fish rather than myself. If there is such a point in life. So I guess that my goal this year is to see a friend catch the fish of their dreams. That would make me very happy..."
161183,Rich,2008-02-17 03:13:00,3927,I gotta say I already reached my biggest goal this year it's right there in my avatar.

161190,crappieperchhunter,2008-02-17 03:43:00,2582,"Fishing Goals....Jeez....I really don't have any beyond just gettin out.  I kinda think in the same vein as DanC though...not really about me getting anything spectacular...just getting out and seeing my fishing buds...new and old...having some fun and landing enough fish to remind us why we enjoy it so much.  My dad, brother and I get together every fall for an overnighter in Orillia. Catch some perch..enjoy each other's company...which we don't get enough of in this busy world...and have a small wager on the biggest perch every year. Kinda like to see the old man get the biggest perch this year and win OUR MONEY...as it has never happened.  CHRIST...what was I thinkin???  The heck with that...it's game on and his $2 is mine!!!!"

I also want to get my daughter so she is a little more selfseficent when fishing."
161252,Spiel,2008-02-17 14:32:00,9065, ....Looks like you'll get the chance Dan. I've managed to snag vacation from August 7th to September 2nd....inclusive.   That's 26 consecutive days off and I'm only working 9 days in July and 10 days in June. It's shaping up to be a good summer. My only goal is to enjoy it.
161288,bassboy,2008-02-17 16:11:00,161," My goal this year is to actually catch fish when I go fishing Didnt land a whole lot last year......it was my first year fishing in a number of years, So I guess technically, to actually learn where the fish are, and how to go about catching them.  Above all, as a few of the others have said.......to have fun!!  Bill"

161328,Cookslav,2008-02-17 17:56:00,1457,"No goals...  Just want to get out as much as possible. With 2 kids under 3, and a 3rd Due in July....I'll be lucky to fish have as much as I did last year, and I only got out like 20 times LOL!  So Late June and July are complete right offs. If I can enjoy 15 times out on the water It'll be more then I expect."
161329,Rich Clemens,2008-02-17 17:58:00,3131,1).  Learn more about the waters I fish and recognizing those more promising spots. 2).  Try to get those lazy followers into biters. 3).  Break my PB 43 ski with something a tad bigger.   She should have a few more inches on her by now.
