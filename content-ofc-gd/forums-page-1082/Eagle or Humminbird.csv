Trying to stay under $300. Is GPS worth it? How about colour? Had my eye on the Eagle 320 colour. Anyone have one of these?  Thanks,  Mark"

I stuck with the Eagle cause before this, I had the Eagle Ultra II Portable and I had that for for 5-6 yrs maybe more and had no problems with it. So when it came time to upgrade..I stuck with Eagle. But My Eagle is a grayscale. Not Color. Although Color does look nicer and the images do stand out beter against a white background.   dsn"

You won't manage it in that price range so add a colour GPS after from Eagle and you wont be disappointed. Also if you make it to the London fishing show talk to Jos at Angling Outfitters he will steer you in the right direction."
