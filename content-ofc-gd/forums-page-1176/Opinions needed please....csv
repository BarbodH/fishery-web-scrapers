96724,Gerritt,2007-07-22 14:37:00,6129,"I Hope everyone is having a great weekend!  Now I hope I am not opening a can of worms here but I have to buy a new boat seeing as how my current rig wants to kill me! lol  I will be adding a new sonar to this boat as well and I need to know your opinions on a Mid-Priced Sonar that has excellent bottom detail in the $300.00-$500.00 range  Lowrance? Garmin? Eagle?  Any models I should be looking at? anything considered a ""best buy""??  Any models I should avoid?  and if you could include a link to the model you recommend? that would be awesome!  Thanks in advance!  Gerritt."
96755,fishergirl72,2007-07-22 16:54:00,455,"Hey Gerritt, Fishindevil swears by Lowrance. He would never buy anything else. I hope that helps you a bit, if you want to know more, pm him and let him know what you are looking for. He is great at this electronic stuff."
96762,Raf,2007-07-22 17:22:00,3495,"my votes for eagle/lowrance as well.  every single one i've seen/used has been a product.  should something go wrong, they are in mississauga."
96791,fishermccann,2007-07-22 19:33:00,655,my hummingbird also works great!
96805,Sinker,2007-07-22 20:31:00,8692,I put an X-97 on my boat this spring.....so far so good. I like it alot better than the X-87 that was on there before.  Its a great unit for the price.  Sinker
96874,Corey,2007-07-23 00:55:00,355,"Get the X67 Ice machine, but a transducer and mount for your boat, use it for ice fishing on hard water. I can gie ya maps too."
96880,Roy,2007-07-23 01:22:00,13728,Lowrance brother. The X-135 is probably the cleanest unit you can buy right now. Download the emulator...check it out.
97153,aplumma,2007-07-23 17:48:00,6896,I am a lowrance fan bud it is the best by far in my eyes. You can go to their website and download their emulator and take it for a test ride before you buy the unit. You might also go to tigergps.com and check their prices they seem to have a better price most of the time.   Art
97160,Gerritt,2007-07-23 18:00:00,6129,thanks guys!  Sounds like Lowrance is the way to go!  Gerritt
97164,Gerritt,2007-07-23 18:08:00,6129,Holy crap is that emulator cool!  Thanks again guys!   Gerritt.
97173,tonyb,2007-07-23 18:20:00,1637,"Humminbird 585c http://www.humminbird.com/products.asp?id=643  In addition to all the other options, I really like the ability to change the back light colour.  Rather than night-vision screwing white, you can select black or navy blue backrounds.  Still all the visibility without the blinding white lit screen that is horrible at night.  Lowrance seems to have a very loyal following, but compare prices and options as with any semi-large purchase.  On Lowrance, do their colour units show anything but purple/orange?  Tony"
97182,Roy,2007-07-23 18:29:00,13728,"Yes Tony. Mine has: *  Large7"" (17.8 cm) diagonal VGA, 16-bit color, SolarMaxâ„¢ TFT display * Incredible 480V x 640H resolution * Advanced cold cathode screen and keypad backlighting * Multiple full- and split-screen sonar/GPS options * Programmable color palette * 6 sonar display color choices"
97185,tonyb,2007-07-23 18:32:00,1637,"They should highlight that a bit more, all the screenshots seem to show a colour spectrum of light orange directly to shades of purple  Tony"
97215,Fisherman,2007-07-23 20:11:00,7201,"Honestly, I think Lowrance/Eagle spend more effort getting you a product that works than spending time putting gimmicky ""rainbow"" colours on the screen to look at."
97292,Tacklebuster,2007-07-23 22:43:00,303,"humminbird = stay away, sorry humminbird fans, just my opinion and experience.  Go Lowrance."
97308,JFR,2007-07-23 23:29:00,498,"Gerritt,  I prefer Lowarance's Eagle brand for the $$$, and little less in the features department but great units and will provide you with the data you need.  Are you looking for a combo GPS/sonar unit, or just sonar?  Are you considering a separate GPS unit?  Again, Lowarance is very reliable, as is Garmin (Garmin delveoped GPS with th US miltary, so their units may be a little more advanced)  I would stay away from Hummingbird, they seem to lag behind in the technology department (just my .02 worth)  John"
97313,Clampet,2007-07-23 23:44:00,1947,Here's a hot model...  
97368,Aaron Shirley,2007-07-24 01:27:00,655,"There is a reason why most people will mention Lowrance, because the have been the freshwater electronics leader for as long as I can remember.  I was a die hard Lowrance fan for many years myself because I am a technology junky that likes to own the best, and I still really like them a lot.  Don't be so quick to discount Humminbird though, as they are an entirely new animal completly as a couple of years ago.  Believe it or not, Humminbird is every bit as good as Lowrance today.  I have owned Humminbird for 2 years now, and I love the new technology.  I know it is hard to wrap your heads around this fact, as Lowrance has dominated the market forever, but it is true.  It is going to take Hummnbird many years for people to realize how good their new technology is now, as they have had an inferior product to Lowrance for way too long.  I'm sure you will be very happy with a Humminbird or Lowrance.  I would recommend looking at all the units at your price point, and getting the model you like best with the features you want.  Happy electronics hunting.  Congrats on the new boat!  Aaron"
97416,sonny,2007-07-24 03:01:00,511,"Thanks arron,,,i also own a humminbird and made my choice over lowrance for a reason,,and thats because i researched carfully before making my choice,,,not just going with the flow!"
