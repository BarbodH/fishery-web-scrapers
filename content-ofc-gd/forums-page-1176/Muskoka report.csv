97125,misfish,2007-07-23 16:44:00,29133,"All I can say is that lady is one tough lake to fish. With such a huge body of water,it,s hard to figure out where to start.  Saturday morning (day 1) the winds had died down and optimizm was in the air, as I had disgust with James what/where, we should start off and try to get a few fish in the boat early to kick the morning off. I was seeing the same excitment in James as I did in my son the weekend before.Big eyes and WOW look at this. Sitting at the staging area James was snapping pic,s and was taking it all in.      We were to plast off 40th.last boat of the first heat and I knew what to expect for the ride.It was going to be hairy concidering 90% of the boats would be heading to the narrows to go to the big lake.Were off and were doing ok til,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,we hit this turbulance area,boat goes left,right holy crap,cut back the throttle a split sec,then back into it and were good.  :o. That was a ride and a half.Get to the narows and I say,we get to do it all again so hang on. Well it wasnt as bad,as we were making a quick right away from the group and the ride was smooth from there to our distanation.  We arrive,flip the troller and I start of with a top water,James a tube (what else)LOL First cast,couple of twitches and boil,crap fish  missed the bait.James quickly follows with the tube and tick tick tick,wham,fish on. Sweet first fish. It,s hooked deep but managed to keep it healty and alive the whole day.Fresh water running the well all day.We continue on for an hour longer with no other results from this spot,so now it,s time to hit the flats. Arrive and as I expected,acouple of dozen bots are there. We started at the south end of the flats. Again me with the top water James with the tube. Not long into it,James has another on,minutes later another.Sweet 3 fish in the boat.Knew I picked him for a reason.LOL  With the top water not producing I switch up to a drop shot with tube. Seemed to be the right choice as I get our forth in the boat. We spent the rest of the day on the flats covering alot of water. I managed to get another to get our five limit and we were happy to have that as from what we were wittnessing,the flats really didnt produce like last year.By 12 noon the flats were basiclaly deserted.  2:30 it,s time to head in for the wiegh in. Not really confident about our wieght,but it meant points for the show at the end of the year. We wieghed in,8.54 for 5 fish. Not the greatest bag,but turns out we werent the only ones having a hard time.          On our way back in for the wiegh in we stopped at one spot to try for that kicker.We could se smoke and water flying in the air. We investigated and turned out to be the practice area for the firefighters.

Gives you that great feeling that this is a great day to catch some fish. Plan this morning was to hit the flats right away,figuring after yesturday it would not be to populated and maybe a few fish could be had. Blast of time,this time were 45,5th off in heat 2. Cool,wakes shouldnt be to bad/but I knew with having one of the smaller motors,it wouldnt take long to be passed so I just stayed wide all the way to the narrows. Wow only passed by 3 boats so we did ok.  Again James with the cam.LOL Narrows heading out to the big water.    Arrive on the flats to find like I thought only a hand full of boats. Great lots of area to move and cover. Well it didnt take long again for James to hit a fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,well a pike fish.Stupid fish they are.LOL  We cover alot of the area with no success,until I see this top water action happening. Man that is crazy,I point it out to James. I grab my top water and throw it right in the middle of the boils. Boil,wieght,wham,its a 13 inch dink,but makes the live well.Ok we now have 2 fish on a very slow morning.  Ok Im not happy with this and talk to James about run and gun hit a few spots,and maybe get a fish at each. He agrees and off we head to an area that has a 20 ft round patch of deep weeds surounded with some nice pads and boulders. Upon arriving we notice a real nice cedar strip on on the rocks.Seems it happen at 11 pm the night before.    I grab my worm rod and James continues with the tube. We work the weeds fully with no results. Head over a bit to the rock edge,throw my top water again,HUGE boil.Wait,crap he missed it.James follows again with the tube,but without result. We worked the area for 15 minutes hoping for that bigg,n to hit since it wasnt stung.Nope,wouldnt have nothing do do with us anymore. We managed a few dinks but nothing well worthy.  This is getting depressing as we only have one 13 inch dink in the well. After hitting acouple of other spots and no worthy fish,we head to the bar,sand bar. Turned out to be the right call as James puts number 2 in the boat,soon after I finally contribute aswell. Ok now we have2 dinks anda 2 pounder.Things are looking up. Continue working the edge of the bar and acouple of hits and miss,s. I turn the boat around to fish the other side of the bar drop and it would be the turning point to getting a decent fish in the boat. Throw the tube,line dosent take long to zing out. Set and I knew this wasnt a dink. After a quick jump after the set,I see the one we been looking for. Yes,3 pounder.Ok our spirits are up again and continue to look for the follower that was with it.Not thinking of throwing another tube right away to try and catch the follower,just thinking of getting this fish in the net.  We continued for an hour but that ws the last fish off the bar. Decded to circle the island and again,right call. I was showing James my megabass jerk bait,when zing ,he got another 3 on.Oh man this is going good for us now. Land it and we now have our five.YeS we both say.thats awesome. Withan hour left,we head back towards the weigh in. We hit our morning spot from the day before.Well didnt we hit them.No big ones but did get to call 1 dink,by quarter inch.LOL We hit 6 fish in 10 minutes from this spot,all would of made the min.  Well thats the day and time for the wiegh in.Again James with the cam.LOL      Time for James to fill the bag.Luck him,this time we have the ball attached to them.    Time to bring the fish up and see how we did. We were very surprised at the wieght.We were thinking around 11-12 pounds,which would of been a payout, the day before.

Looking forward to those two events. Great job this weekend James enjoyed the partnership greatly.  Before signing off,heres a few bloopers.  Saturday we have the well full and I keep the fresh water always on. Im at the front of the boat and can hear water rushing. Turn around and I see the well over filiing.WTH. Turn off the pump and check it out .I left the ball chains in the well with the fish and one of them blocked the exit port.lol Lesson learned.  Yesturday I had a gaurdian angle watching me. Ready to launch the boat, and I have no boat keys. Seach everywhere and lo and be hold,they are on the bumper at the lieciens plate.Just where I put them when I locked the boat toung in BARRIE.All the way up they didnt fall off. Im sure my Grandfather was sitting back there enjoying the ride up.   Sorry for the long winded report and bad spelling and grammer.LOL Like I really care.HAHAHAHAHA  Off this week.Going to fish Simcoe for smallies, finally."

Well Terry I got to tell ya,it aint like going out to fish for fun,although I do have fun when Im out there,but the pressure of getting a 5 fish limit that will put you up there,let alone just to get 5 fish in the well, really puts a drain on ya when your one fish short, hell, like the last day 4 fish short til it came together after lunch. It took a big wieght off of me and my partner."
97303,Terry,2007-07-23 23:15:00,14456,you don't have to tell me.....lol  every tourney I learnt something new.... sometimes I learnt what not to do...but I always took something new home and built on.....
