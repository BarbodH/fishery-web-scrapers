The world's largest retail chain will be selling the spirits at an affordable price, in the $2 - $5 range.   Wine connoisseurs may not be inclined to put a bottle of Wal-Mart brand into their shopping carts, but ""there is a market for inexpensive wine,"" said Kathy Micken, professor of marketing at University of Arkansas, Bentonville.   ""But the right name is important.""  Customer surveys were conducted to determine the most attractive name for the Wal-Mart wine brand. The top surveyed names in order of popularity were:   10. Chateau Traileur Parc 9. White Trashfindel 8. Big Red Gulp 7. World Championship Riesling 6. NASCARbernet 5. Chef Boyardeaux 4. Peanut Noir 3. I Can't Believe it's not Vinegar 2. Grape Expectations 1. Nasti Spumante   The beauty of Wal-Mart wine is that it can be served with either white meat (Possum) or red meat (Squirrel)."
