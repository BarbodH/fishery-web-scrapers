95450,nautifish,2007-07-18 17:00:00,1416,"  Thankyou pam.  I do have a tripod but have not yet used it. I guess i am blessed with having a steady hand....lol.....When i finally get around to buying some extra zoom lense attachments i may then start useing my cam with my tripod.  Here are a few more shots taken this morning. I was asked to try and take some pictures of dragonf;lies, so i headed down to the grand river and took these.  I have to say these insects are not easy to phtograph as they really do not seem to sit for long periods of time and move so fast when in flight. Plus these ones being so small made it even more of a task, But i did manage to snap a few. It was very overcast this morning so the pictures in my oppinion do not look as vibrant.      A wild flower shot.   A spider resting in my wild flower garden out back taken here at home.   & of course a few more butterfly pictures i also took in my garden today.       Nauti."
95462,fishnsled,2007-07-18 17:21:00,3520,Some beautiful shots there Nauti!
95654,fishindevil,2007-07-19 02:07:00,6254,"Very nice pictures tracy...they are sooooo....clear,and very focused,you really are very good at taking pics for sure...keep up the great work,so when do the fish pics come how about some close ups of fish....cheers"
95829,nautifish,2007-07-19 16:47:00,1416,  Thankyou fishinsled.  Sean i am hopeing later today. Things have just been so crazy busy of late not alot of time for fishing.  If i manage to get out later i will be sure to try and get some shots of hopefully some half decent size fish.
95943,highdrifter,2007-07-19 21:52:00,2534,WOW Nauti.  You are nice... to butterflies..  Those shots are so crisp you can count the scales off the wings...
95952,Guest lundboy,2007-07-19 22:21:00,0,Wow! Really amazing shots!  I've tried butterfly shots before...  It's really hard.  I never had a problem with film SLRs but the two digitals I've had just don't trigger the shutter quick enough after pushing the button... always seems to be a 1-2 second delay even if I push it half way down first to allow it to pre-focus.  Anyways... great results.
96004,dsn,2007-07-19 23:33:00,1018,Ok Nauti you inspired me. So I gave it a try. I came across this at the island. And thought ok I'll give it a try and see how it turns out.      I decided to get really close up and used manual focus mode. Snapped this pic before it flew off. Then I took this are my bros place.   Not bad huh? Usually they don't turn out for me cause of not enough light. But in this cause it turned out good. I was hoping to get a close up shot of a bumble bee but they are too quick!!.  dsn  Thanks for inspiring us!!
96081,nautifish,2007-07-20 02:00:00,1416,  Those are great DSN  AWESOME JOB LOVE THE Butterfly shots. Insects are not easy to photograpgh thats for sure. I was hopeing to get out fishing this evening and get some fish shots but nope instead it decided to team it down with rain big time. But Ahhh well forcast for a beautiful weekend ahead so hopefully i will be out on me boat getting some more shots of both fish & wildlife. Again great job on the pictures.  Nauti.
96082,nautifish,2007-07-20 02:02:00,1416,  Thankyou lundboy.  It gets easier as you get to know ur camera. I swear the manual i have for this camera is like 400 pages long....LOL...Ok sligh exageration a little maybe. But there are alot of pages....lol....Just keep playing with it as i have done.   I have different shutter speeds on my camera i am sure you probably do on urs also.  Nauti.

94887,nautifish,2007-07-17 06:10:00,1416, Thankyou so much.By no means am i a pro when it  comes to taking pictures. It is just something i love to do. I am still playing around and learning with the new cam but also having alot of fun with it.  Thanx again. Nauti.
94971,Mike Pike,2007-07-17 13:49:00,1332,"I respectfully disagree, Nauti.  They ARE spectacular!  Can't even pick a favorite.  Absolutely gorgeous.  You have a great eye for composition."
94975,Cast-Away,2007-07-17 13:56:00,790,"They are really nice to look at Nauti, especially the chick shot!"

95072,Joey,2007-07-17 17:28:00,9122,"Great pics for close ups, nice and focused.  Very cool!  Joey"
95083,nautifish,2007-07-17 17:48:00,1416,  Gotta love the macro feature Joey!   I am still learning with that!..  Last night while out walking with the pups came across to does one was huge too. The sun had set and the  light was starting to fade. I  tryed and tryed to get a snap shot with different options on my cam but too blooming dark...Would have been great shots.  So like i said still learning.
95193,dsn,2007-07-17 23:31:00,1018,yeah truely you have passion for photography!! I have canon A700 Powershot and I can't take close up pics without getting the shakes. And sometimes lighting conditions don't allow for faster shutter speeds. Did you use a tripod for the butterfly pics?  dsn
95316,Badger Shark,2007-07-18 04:22:00,291,"Those are really beautiful pics, very sharp and colourful.  I love taking nature pics as well and have discovered recently that taking pics of a big fire at night can really be interesting when you look back at them.  I constantly can find eerie almost demonic looking faces in the flames.  It really is quite creepy but you can see interesting things sometimes and it is also quite striking when you actually see the flames frozen in your pics.  Keep taking and posting more.  If I ever get a chance I will post some of my favorite fire pics and others."
95368,pameladallaire,2007-07-18 12:24:00,470,Beautiful butterfly shots!  I was also going to ask whether you used a tripod.  I have trouble getting the shots crisp but I'm still learning my camera too.  Pam
95445,nautifish,2007-07-18 16:51:00,1416, Thankyou DSN and no i did not use a tripod for those shots. Find it easier holding the actual camera.  Nauti.
95446,nautifish,2007-07-18 16:53:00,1416,  Thankyou badger and look forward to seeing some of ur own pictures.  Nauti.
