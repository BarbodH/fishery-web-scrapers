With the Big Boyz tournament slated for the next 2 wknds the bows have shown up and are biting and of course jumping! Good fishing is located about 6-8 miles SE of the marina in 57-61 FOW. Downriggers from 25-45 with hot colours being, Confusion, Watermelon, Geasy Chicken and Orange Crush. Dipeys are working too and are picking up bonus walleyes. 0 dipsey on #3 setting 85-135 back. LSC is giving up some good bags of bass mostly draggin tubes in 8-15 FOW. Water clarity will determine bait colour but look for rocks humps and weed patches on the slight breaklines. A Navionics chip will help lots for finding the breaklines. Musky fishing continues to improve from last yr with some big fish being caught. Try Woodies or Talonz Slashers in Perch, bass or Olive frog patterns for good results.  "
