96923,Mike the Pike,2007-07-23 03:31:00,3421,First weekend this year Camping we booked a site at Voyageur Campground just off the Ottawa River.  Believe me the Kids were excited.A chance to catch frogs and fish and my son was dirty enough to do a Tide commercial.   Our site for the weekend.   This is what the woman do when the boys go fishing Play scrabble.(BORING)       This little critter saved me from a complete skunking Saturday.   Fishing in the slop.  On the way back the wind was brutal all alone in the canoe getting back to camp took for ever I really missed the convenience of my tiller boat but at the same time I really enjoyed the total peace and quiet.Just the calm of Nature.Did I say I miss my boat motor lol.   My wife and daughter with my daughters friend.   My family.   Fun with glow sticks and sparklers.       A little bass caught by my friend Serge.   Serge and I could not bring our boats this weekend because we had our tent trailers. Back up is our Canoes. only a 250 metre portage down to the water. While I paddled serge had the luxury of an old Johnson 1.5hp mounted to his canoe .Got him around quickly . Ya thats why my fishing sucked.No Motor.  I did see a huge Muskie jump out of the water 30 ft away . Couldn't catch him though     Me trying to locate the fish.   My son and daughters caught hundreds of these all weekend.       Well we had to pack up and leave a great weekend with family and friends. Man it was the perfect weekend nice weather such a nice place I did not want to leave.  Sorry for the lack of fish pics.

Gets pretty competetive too. My sister in law is a linguist and it just KILLS her that she's not able to beat me  ."
