Will see if I have time to do our fishing success post, to date, before I return....or will save it for Fall.  Great to see EVERYONE again and meet some new OFC'rs ! Thanks for making Leah feel at home and she's even willing to come back again.  We went from Monday to Monday and on Tuesday Lew and I went out in seach of Esox but came up with nothing but a couple of pike each. Tell me this great man doesn't enjoy his time on the water! He also saw first hand how nice that Navionics chip in the Lowrance worked for combing thru the rock piles of Muskrat and West Bays.    Great seeing the 'plummas for the third year in a row and Maureen as well..    Leah working on Rock Bass Champion    Had a good day out with Rich Clemens on the boat, on Thursday    Part of the floatila at the Friday Noon fish fry on Tombstone Island. A great time had by all and a reason to arrive early folks! Hope it's a yearly event!    A few more shots     We had Dano and his sweety, Fern, out on Thursday night and Leah put on a clinic for us. Pickeral after Pickeral and us skunked! Hell we quit netting them for her....told her she was on her own!    T.J. Worshipping the devil !    Most of the gang before Saturdays fish tourney!    Chris winning the trolling motor supplied by Spiel    ...and Crappie Steve winning the crappie prize LOL    Bernie, Cliff, douG and Rick's father.    Some of the gang enjoying the tunes..    Leah and Shelley having some great laughs. THANKS Shelley !    A nice island in Marganser(sp) Bay, that Leah and I nosed up on for a picnic lunch.    and one of her numerous pike as we tried to leave the same bay. That was the hot colour for the day.  "
