97227,Canuck2fan,2007-07-23 20:40:00,1444,I don't know about where you folks are but for about 80KM around me the winds from this so called nor easter are a going to be a WHOOPING 15KM per hour from the southWEST that should really stir things up..... or probably not? By morning the winds where I want to go fishing are supposed to be southwest 10KM..  So where is this nor easter coming from?
