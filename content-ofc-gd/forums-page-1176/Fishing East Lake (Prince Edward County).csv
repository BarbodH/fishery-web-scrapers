Any helpful tips on lure selection?  Also going for walleye so if you have any tips as well please share.  Thanks a Bunch!!!!!!"

96801,Beans,2007-07-22 20:16:00,3339,Caught many pickerel and pike on East Lake many years ago (late 60's) with the original plastic lure...a Creme worm on a worm harness with a small propeller spinner...probably still work there...just add some weight above it and drift with the wind one way and troll back upwind the other...  Rice lake pickerel wouldn't touch it...
