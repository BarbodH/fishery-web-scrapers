96785,danbouck,2007-07-22 19:00:00,4380,Got a call from a buddy of mine last night who wanted to get out on the water. We casually showed up to the lake at 8:30am in hopes of finding some bass and perch. Started off going along the shoreline until I noticed some stomps in the water and threw my trusty J-9 at it and landed this nice 18 1/2 incher   Remember I am 6'1'' and 300 lbs    Had a couple more hits but nothing boated so we decided to get some perch. We got to the usual spot and got about 25 or so. All in all it was a very relaxing day out on the water away from work.  BTW All fish were released
