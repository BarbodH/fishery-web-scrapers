We went to the Gores Landing docks and caught some sunfish but that was about it.. had a great time though. We live around Ajax and was wondering if theres a spot in and around a 30 minute drive radius where we could do some shore/dock fishing. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.  Thanks!"
