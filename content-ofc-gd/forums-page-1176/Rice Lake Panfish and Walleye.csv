97031,i4walleye,2007-07-23 13:53:00,1,Very nice website!! just joined!! I will be going to Rice lake this Tues. and staying at Golden Beach resort. Any info on Walleyes and Panfish would be appreciated. I am bringing my boys and my Dad for 5 days of heaven away from work. I planned on fishing for Panfish in the mornings and afternoons and then trying walleye in the evening. Thanks in advance
