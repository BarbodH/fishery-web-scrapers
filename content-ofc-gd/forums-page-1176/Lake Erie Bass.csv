Its been rollin all of July pretty much and tough to get out without the Motion Sickness Pills. lol  Im launching off the Buffalo side and as some may know, we had the Bassmasters tournament here this past weekend. Kinda neat, but makes launching a bit of a nuthouse. Heres a couple pigs from the last couple outings  LOTS of fish out there,  the action is pretty consistant with the smaller fish, with some of these heavier fish mixed in to keep things really exciting  Lost a fish bigger than these on sunday, and Had a beauty that the camera didnt save due to a memory card error. Grrrr!  Find a hump or rockpile on the bottom and fish around it for some action. We caught fish all evening drifting over a large hump that went from 30ft.  up to 15 drifting tubes, leeches     "
