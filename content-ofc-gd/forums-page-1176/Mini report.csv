96788,danc,2007-07-22 19:22:00,4677,"Without too much planning, I can take off in a moments notice and launch on a large Lake Superior Tributary just minutes from my house. From there I can head to the big lake or stay in the river and fish for Walleye, Pike, Perch, Bass and most other warm water species. This morning Sis and I did just that. We fished the main river for an hour or so until dark clouds moved in. The fishing sucked. We caught one small Walleye and a tiny Bass.    I always admire the work that this guy put in to this project. I pass by it every time I'm on the river. This boat is no more than 14 feet long.    Abby came along for a ride today as well. And she got to try out her brand new fishing hat. She wasn't too fond of it at first, but seemed to get used to it.    I stopped at a marshy area and took a walk with my camera. You never know what you'll find in a marsh. This is what I found today.        We got off the river just before it started to rain. When I see this sight, I know I'm almost home.    I hope everyone is enjoying their day. I know I am."

96939,solopaddler,2007-07-23 04:20:00,8605,"Nice pictures, you do live in paradise as far as I'm concerned! I swear that style of boat is unique to Superior. Years ago I fished with a guy regularly at the mouth of the Michipicoten who had an identical boat...Only thing though, when the lake kicked up it was a floating death trap. So top heavy and unstable in big water with the structure up front. One time we got caught too far from the harbour and a storm came out of nowhere. Never been that frightened on the water before or since..."
