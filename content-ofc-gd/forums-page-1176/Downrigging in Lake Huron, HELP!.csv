We marked  lots of fish but couldn't seem to tag one.  I am experienced at down rigging for Lakers in Northern lakes but the great lakes is a whole new ball game.  We plan on trying Lake Huron, we will be heading out from the Maitland river area. Any advice on what to use, how far out  to go, depth, speed.  Any and all information would be appreciated."
