96917,solopaddler,2007-07-23 03:20:00,8605," Yep the ducks are whacko, I dropped them off in Latchford on the way home and gave them directions to your camp, enjoy!"
96921,douG,2007-07-23 03:30:00,2693,"Sweet report, Mike, fine lookin' fambly you got there.  Little kids are the best, mine are big and smelly now, with tons o' attitude.  Enjoy them while you can."
96936,solopaddler,2007-07-23 04:07:00,8605," Thanks, but mine are small and smelly with tons off attitude! And here I thought they'd outgrow that"

I hear you on vacationing with young ones LOL (mine are 2years 10 months, and 10 months old)  Certainly limits the fishing time and the level of intensity at which you can fish but.... its every bit as rewarding if not more to see your kids doing all the catching eh?  Thanks for the report. Cheers,"
