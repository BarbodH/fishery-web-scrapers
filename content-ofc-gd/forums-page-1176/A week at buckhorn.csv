We did catch fish, but just not in the numbers or size that we are used to. For the week we managed only 3 bass over 2 and a half pounds, with a 17 incher, and 18 incher at 3 pounds 5 ounces and a 19 incher at 3 pounds 14 ounces. The fishing over the first few days was really difficult because we are used to the water being atound 76 and it was right down at 68. We found the fish to be in 12-15 FOW over scattered weeds, and white spinnerbaits were the only thing that could coax them out. I have lots of pictures but im getting tired of scaling them down to rediculous sizes at the moment so ill just put the one up and then when the film from the other camera comes in ill get some more up.  Heres the big boy of the week at 19 inches and 3 lbs 14 oz.      Lots more to come"
