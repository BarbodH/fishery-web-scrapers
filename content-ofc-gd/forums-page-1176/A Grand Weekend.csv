96829,tbayboy,2007-07-22 22:13:00,1497,"After a disappointing T.O. Island trip for PatrickG and myself last week where the red ants got more bites than the fish Patrick tells me we should go to the Grand this weekend for some smallies.  Seems he used to live there and is willing to divulge a little spot he knows.  Hell yeah says me, as long as there's no bloody ants I'm in.  So Saturday AM we headed to the KW area (I'd post the google map photo and directions but Patrick may kill me  ).  I know we're gonna be wadding but I don't have any waders, just some water socks but thats fine, the weather was beautiful and the river water doesn't smell so in we go.  Sure enough 2 casts in Patrick lands his first 12 lb Grand river smallie:   <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1131/866265313_7aebca8b41_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1109"" /></a>  Meanwhile I'm tossing the tubes I'm sure will work, then the crayfish, then this then that while Patrick keeps offering me the magic brown flecked super tube but nooo I gotta be different.  After a couple more small guys Patrick lands this - definitely a 12 and 1/2 pounder:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1265/866279277_e93b7483c3_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""IMG_1133"" /></a>  That's it I give up and borrow one of the 'magic' tubes and a few casts later I've got my first little one.  Unfortunately I forget to tell Patrick how to use my camera so that pic got lost but thats fine, as soon enough I get this guy, a bit more pic worthy:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1063/867127400_1c1d4b7672_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""IMG_1128"" /></a>  Not to be beaten Patrick lands a couple more  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1258/866271185_fa603efa3a_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1119"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1266/867131036_44b1a1b8d6_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1132"" /></a>  And this one caught on video:  <object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""  The bite slowed down then with just a couple more little ones so we grabbed some lunch then went to another spot but the bugs there were pretty bad and so was the bite so we called it a day with Patrick out fishing by one nice one and a couple small ones.  That night I had a friends birthday bash but all the sun during the day had me beat so surprisingly I found myself back home at 2:30am and up at 9:00am with no hangover.  What to do what to do.  Oh I know, sneak back to Patricks spot and even the score  Quick stop at tims and I'm up to my chest in water at 11am for a few hours with 2 goals: prove I can catch a river smallie with one of the zillion plastics I bought (ie without Patricks super tube) and of course even the count with Patrick (just because he wasn't there for the second day it counts right?  ).  It was another beautiful day but damned if I couldn't get anything to bite until I put on the magic tube and then I had one that spit it on a jump.  Grrr.  Quick trip back to the car for some more sunscreen and I'm back with a black and red specked tube when finally I catch something with my own bait  Oh yeah, a monster  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1072/872425038_df65266c51_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1137"" /></a>  I got a few more of those sized guys when a hop over some weeds sent my line sideways and the drag spinning.  Hooray, a decent fish!  This guy was a lot of fun, damned if those river fish don't put up a hell of a fight.  Couldn't get much of a pic standing in 3 feet of water balancing my rod on my head and trying not to get my camera soaked:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1005/872426402_b309f8ebc0_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""IMG_1138"" /></a>  I stayed a bit longer but the sun went behind the clouds and the water suddenly seemed a lot cooler so I called it a day (after catching up to Patricks numbers - booyah).  This was my first time fishing the Grand (and I went to U Waterloo for 5 years - go figure) and I really enjoyed it.  Its such a nice way to fish when everything you need has to fit in your vest and of course the scenery was beautiful as well:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1221/866269931_e2c84c3d1d_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1116"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/866267485/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1423/866267485_2a1895a9e1_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1113"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/871572297/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1143/871572297_07689d646e_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1134"" /></a>  Thanks to Patrick for introducing me to this great little fishery, definetely gonna be back again (time to shop for a better vest and maybe some wader - when can I stop spending money on this damned hobby?   )"
96831,Cookslav,2007-07-22 22:18:00,1457,"Nice,  The Grand has a great bass Fishery if you know were to get in Cheers,"
96832,PHISHY!,2007-07-22 22:24:00,24,I love fishing the Grand.  There's a lot of little honey holes if ya know where to look! Nice pics.  
96838,007,2007-07-22 22:31:00,537,"Great report TBayboy.  Looks like you and Patrick had a great time and caught some nice fish.  Certainly looks like nicer, less crowded surroundings than the T.O Islands!  007"
96841,danbouck,2007-07-22 22:43:00,4380,Ya the grand has a great bass fishery. It's great for someone to show you some honey holes!
96915,PatrickGG,2007-07-23 03:09:00,562,Sure was a fun day despite the sun stroke but for some odd reason on days like it was Saturday I'd be hitting off alot of big samllies and it seems like you catch one and the school would quickly move to other holes nearby so it was kind of like a game of hide and seek but regardless it was one beautiful day and the Grand is still looking good.
96928,Mike the Pike,2007-07-23 03:51:00,3421,Nice report man  MTP
96986,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 12:13:00,7971,LOL...loved the report Sean.  Although I believe that 12 pounder was closer to 13 by the sounds of it.  Great pics...glad you found someone to fish with who actually puts you on fish...haha.
96990,MJL,2007-07-23 12:23:00,2427,Love the pics and report.  That looks like a great place to fly fish too.  WTG!
97015,Mike Pike,2007-07-23 13:16:00,1332,What a terrific report and terric pics Tbay.  Looks like you guys a great time out on the river with some nice Grand Smallies to boot!  Thanks for the post and the video.  I really enjoyed it all!  Nice job!
97052,tbayboy,2007-07-23 14:47:00,1497," I'm just waiting til the fall to take you up on the trib fishing Cliff - if we get skunked again then I may have to accuse you of holding out on me  Your probably right, they were hitting off the top as well (only got one hit on my topwater though grr) but after soaking my reel a few times just trying to balance it and retie lines I don't think I'm quite ready for fly fishing yet."
97056,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 14:49:00,7971," I can promise this...if we dont catch any fish in the fall on the tribs, you'll at least have the cleanest leader/hook set up in the area!!! LOL.  Seriously though...we'll definately head out in the fall....I'm no CANADIANCOPPER, but I can share what knowledge I do have."
97189,Carpe Diem,2007-07-23 18:41:00,61,"Humor me please. Can those fish be caught from shore, or do you actually have to wade in??? So far my only experience is fishing from shore. Don't live far from the Grand.  Thanks."
97194,Joey,2007-07-23 18:56:00,9122,Great report.  Looks like both days were beautiful.  You may have to go to the store and buy a bag of those magic tubes  Joey
97197,tbayboy,2007-07-23 19:04:00,1497,"I'm sure there's shore fishing spots but not this one but hey, its summer and the waters nice so why not wade on in there (though my feet are sore from stepping on rocks all day with water socks on)."
97199,Carpe Diem,2007-07-23 19:11:00,61,"Ya know what, that sounds like fun. Just may do that. Thanks TbayBoy.  Did i read that correctly? Water socks??"
97217,tbayboy,2007-07-23 20:15:00,1497,"Yeah, I haven't invested in waders yet so they're those slip on shoes with a tread on bottom of them.  Work well but they don't have a stiff sole so you feet still feel all the rocks (basically they're for traction not protection)"
97425,ehg,2007-07-24 03:25:00,2666,"Nice pictures and write up!  Thanks for report,  ehg"
97428,Mike the Pike,2007-07-24 03:30:00,3421,Did you guys have a change of clothes or did you sit your soggy asses in the car all the way home
