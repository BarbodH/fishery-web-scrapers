96845,Joey,2007-07-22 23:04:00,9122,This one is for my sister.  She is Leo the Lion and her birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks.  Just gotta get it framed and its good to go    Joey
96852,danbouck,2007-07-22 23:21:00,4380,Nice Work
96860,Beans,2007-07-23 00:00:00,3339,Was that done by hooking ?...Nice!
96864,Joey,2007-07-23 00:07:00,9122," No Norm, its by X stiching     A series of many, many X's in different colours and double toned colours.  Joey"
96868,Nanook,2007-07-23 00:23:00,565,"  Well done Joey, thats a hell of a lot of work in ""Leo"". It will look realy good in a frame. Now........... get some fishing Girl!!!"
96873,Roy,2007-07-23 00:45:00,13728,Very nice Joey...VERY nice.  I must show you mine some day also :-)
96887,Clampet,2007-07-23 01:41:00,1947,"Yeah, it ain't bad. "
96904,Bly,2007-07-23 02:14:00,1556,"Looks great Joey!  I am always impressed that anyone can finish a cross stitch...I haven't the patience.  I have a few that my father did..he liked the ones where you have to count the stitches/no patterns.....think Cliff would move out if I tried one   lol  Anyway, very nice and I am sure it will look great framed!"
96905,motv8tr,2007-07-23 02:15:00,2587,Very nice Joey!!!  Maureen
96906,Joey,2007-07-23 02:18:00,9122,"Yes Bly, those are the only ones I like too.  It seems like cheating to do the ones with a background already.  I like to start with a plain blank piece of aida cloth and then its great when the finished product is all your own doing  It always amazes me that some men do this kind of craft.  I even know of one male OFNr that told me he used to do them     But I've been sworn to secrecy.  Joey"
96907,Crazyhook,2007-07-23 02:19:00,1154,"Joey, wow awesome work!"
96948,pameladallaire,2007-07-23 04:46:00,470,Beautiful Joey!  Good craftsmanship (or is it craftwomanship?)  is not cheating!!  How many people can do it??  Great job.  Pam
96982,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 12:05:00,7971, That's a rather personal question.  Great job on the project!! Looks great!
97042,nautifish,2007-07-23 14:21:00,1416,Ahhh! Another happy hooker......lol.....Have a freind who also cross stitches and thats what i call her A happy little hooker....lol....  Very nice job joey well done grl.
97045,Cookslav,2007-07-23 14:25:00,1457,"Very cool,  Whats the time line on one of those....you must have put in some serious hours???"
97072,Beans,2007-07-23 15:06:00,3339,  Guess I shoulda asked if it was done by rug hooking...Cliff...no malice intended...LOL
97079,Joey,2007-07-23 15:10:00,9122," Its hard to say really, when you only do it after work or on weekends when you're not fishing.  Last year I did my wolves when I was home sick and it took me three months, doing it for about 4 - 5 hours per day, give or take.  Joey"
97081,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 15:12:00,7971, LOL...I know Beans...just thought I'd play with you a bit...haha.
