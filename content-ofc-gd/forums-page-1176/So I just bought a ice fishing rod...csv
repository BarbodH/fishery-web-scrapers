I'm thinking about going to Toronto Island to fish during this week.  Please tell me anything about the ice fishing rod and how it can be used for normal fishing instead of just winter fishing. I bought this rod because it's small and it can fit in my bag  since I'm an urban fishermen.  Oh yeah, the brand is ZEBCO. I also used a 6lb line."
