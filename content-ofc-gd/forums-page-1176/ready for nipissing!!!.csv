When i get back i hope to have a few pictures of fish or scenery for you guys and i will try and post it so you can all have a look(if i catch anything)  I made a a trip to bass pro shop bought a couple of frogs, some ""zoom"",some power bates, a bug zapper(for dad ) and my dad and i got the family's reels done putting 12 pound test on (triline).i humd and hawd about getting the braided superstren line wasnt really into it and i didnt wanna risk anything going up just in case i found it bad and it made it harder for me to fish.After BPS i went over to canadien tire to buy a ""barbie fishing rods"" for my sister shes only two now turning three this year so i figured it would give her a chance to learn put a little bobber on there for her or something.  packings is gonna be a nightmare  but anywho its gonna be worth it this year i hope to learn how to fillet a fish from the guy who owns the place we are staying at. Im staying at promised land camp its a blast there myself and the parents.They have a play ground,water slide, water trampoline and a canoe trip for the kids then after the canoe trip we go and get free ice-cream from wades landing.  Im going to also try this year to catch my first muskie hoping it will be about 20+ but its not gonna be easy :]  Oh another thing i did not mention in my shopping list from bass pro is Dave Mercers new dvd it was 3 bucks so i grabbed one.He does a bunch of ""artic Char"" fishing then some bass fishing then some extream tropical fishing  So thats it im heading up on saturday!Talk to yall in a week!!!! little angler"
