We would like to find a place less than an hour from Victoria Harbor, a place where we can rent for up to 4 people.  Was looking at Honey Harbour, but is it to populated? If you have any ideas, sure would be appreciated.  Lorissa"

You can fish the channel, Matchedash Bay, and go into Hogs bay (victoria Harbour)...all kinds of places right there...  Maureen"

I cant recall how to get there but the phone number is 1-705-534-7101 Kevin is the guy. Its right next to some good fishing waters.
