820131,John Bacon,2013-11-25 03:25:00,3277,"the account from the rescuers was only the tip of the bow was out of the water when they arrived, and that was almost immediately after they entered the water...  so i don't believe it would be from being water logged...at least not that quickly.  I meant that foam can become waterlogged as the boat ages.  This would be especially true for boats that are left unattended at docks for days at a time.  If water is left in the boat for a few days it would get absorbed by the foam.  That was the case for my boat.  Even without water logged foam; I would not be surprised if a large 4 stroke motor and a few deep cycle batteries could defeat the flotation."

I wonder if the foam rating is desigined to keep the boat afloat or a boat, motor, gear. There must be some specs available and it might be good to know for the future."

820169,BillM,2013-11-25 14:52:00,17367,"Glad everyone is ok, interested to here from the guys that went for a swim on what happened."
820180,ehg,2013-11-25 15:46:00,2666," No need to stress for giant gold socks cause they'll still be swimming and putting up wimpy fights the next day.   The 2-3 lb. fish are good eating size.  I guess the thrilling danger involved in fishing for these inedible 15 lb. wet socks is what gets some out there.  However, used to ice fish Long Reach/Sherman's Point years ago and getting a 10 lb.+ walleye was great, since i was used to little walleyes of the Kawarthas."
820185,JoshS,2013-11-25 16:18:00,729,"Comforting to hear those guys all alright. Those charter guys must of been close enough and quick enough to make all the difference in the world, well done.  When they're ready to tell the story.. I'm really curious to know details. Like others have said, we need to learn from what happened."
820000,Sinker,2013-11-24 17:34:00,8692,I'm very interested in hearing the whole story as well. Bottom line is that everyone made it to shore alive....thank god.....stuff happens quick and always when you least expect it. Sharing bad experiences like these could very well save someone elses life somewhere down the road.  S.
820018,Terry,2013-11-24 18:39:00,14456,"this  is what Scott wrote he was one of the charter boats involved in the rescue we had diner with him that night   I just finished tucking my kids into bed and I snuggled them a little tighter tonight and added a few extra kisses. Days like today make you feel lucky to be alive.I don't deserve any praise, we did what anyone of you would have done. We were just very lucky to be in the vicinity. I saw the bow of a boat and debri in the water then realized it was 4 guys in the water. I just happened upon them. I didn't go above and beyond just consider myself lucky to have been there very soon after their accident. I don't think they had been in the water very long based on how close together the debri was and how fast the boat sank. I radioed Sheldon as we had been fishing close together and running in together so I knew he was close. We each pulled two guys aboard then transferred the guys into my cabin added a Sheldon's heater and began the run in to meet the paramedics. A big thank you to Jeff a client aboard Sheldon's boat that was a paramedic who took control of monitoring the guys condition. These guys couldn't have been luckier. To have so much help close by. Yvan Rousseau responded to offer help as did several other boats in the area. Comforting to know we are all one big family out there. I know I don't want or deserve any praise just happy to help and did what each and everyone of you would have done.They all had float suits which made spotting them easier and kept them afloat. They were wet, cold, and scared but drove home tonight.Let's keep it positive and lay no blame. It blew up fast and the perfect circumstances occurred to create a horrible situation. All's well that ends well. It was the final kick in the pants I needed to wear my life jacket daily. I want to snuggle my kids tomorrow night too.Please no praise or recognition for me, there were others there to do it if I wasn't first in line. Just use it to be more safety conscious."
820019,Steve,2013-11-24 18:40:00,2075,Scott is a very solid dude.  Good on him.
820034,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-24 19:23:00,4399,"First let me say I am glad that everybody survived the accident. This does how ever reinforce my personal decision to avoid the big water in my 17-6"" boat especially this time of year and certainly with weather conditions the way they were yesterday I know my limits and the limits of my boat, was there not a severe weather warning for the area yesterday with winds in the 30-40 range I would think that would produce waves in the 1 to 2 meter range! My boat would never have left the trailer. Call me crazy but when the November winds are blowing and the waves are rolling I am much more comfortable sitting in my lazy boy watching a game!!!"
820035,Steve,2013-11-24 19:29:00,2075,"six years in a row I did 10 to 12 day trips in December on Quinte - in my 17' boat. you just have to know when not to go out. we never tried to ""beat"" the weather. if we saw the winds were going to blow, we didn't go out. the key is knowing if your up for 10 to 12 days, there is the next day to wait.  safety is paramount out there. i'm very glad these fella's are still around to hug their families.  what scares ME the most is the crazy kayaker's who are out there in November, then posting on the net to show their results.  THAT is going to cause a death.  My late buddy Serge, who died on Lake Ontario, in his Kayak, in November, was experienced, and went out on a calm day. A freak snow squall blew threw and that was the end of it.  Be safe EVERYONE!"
820038,Terry,2013-11-24 19:34:00,14456,"I have made some bad choices over the years, it's easy to do but made it home cold and wet...stuff happens"
820039,misfish,2013-11-24 19:39:00,29133,"Yup,I made a few and lived to tell about it. Im sure some took from my stories.  Im glad all four are alive to share and educate themselves and others."
820042,GBW,2013-11-24 19:44:00,8460,"I have made some bad choices over the years, it's easy to do but made it home cold and wet...stuff happens As we ALL have.  I would much rather be in someone else's boat than mine on windy days.  They know what the boat can do and I know what mine can do and big waves are not it's thing.  And I'm talking about my boat(s) here not what happened.  SO GLAD everyone is physically ok from this."

Different strokes for different folks I guess, I can`t imagine sitting in a freezing cold boat in December 15 pound walleye or not!!!! And there was a severe weather warning for the area yesterday calling for 40 km winds gusting to 60 from the northwest so I don`t know."

820059,Roy,2013-11-24 21:01:00,13728,"I'm grateful that everyone got out relatively unscathed. I'm sure that everyone here was concerned and wanted to know who was involved. People were just worried is all. Some life lessons learned here. Let's leave it at that. Hats off to Greg, Sheldon and the others for a quick and efficient mission.  I was asked to lock this by a few people. I think we should leave it up and think about it for a while."
820068,RangerGuy,2013-11-24 21:40:00,564,"I can confirm how fast the waves came up. We were just past Sherman's when I started my turn to head back down the other side towards glenora.  Before I finished my turn the waves were up and we were reeling up.  I myself made a mistake we just got lucky. It could have been easily us.  Instead of just working the motor I was reeling in the lines as well and the boat kept spinning side ways. I won't make that mistake again ever!  Again, glad to here all is well..."
820080,Big Cliff,2013-11-24 22:47:00,6899,"I haven't heard from a good friend of mine that was down there and I have been worried sick about him all day, no answer on his cell or at home. I know those involved survived but I'm still worried!"

820086,Big Cliff,2013-11-24 23:46:00,6899,"Ok, a phone call from a friend has put my mind at ease. My heart still goes out to those involved and I am glad that no members of this family were lost!"
820088,Sinker,2013-11-24 23:49:00,8692,"If it was me who was rescued, I would share my story everywhere possible. It could very well save someone elses life! There's no shame in that.......  S."
820091,GBW,2013-11-24 23:52:00,8460,Very true sinker BUT I don't know if he wants to right now.  Might not be ready to?
820092,Joey,2013-11-25 00:03:00,9122,Well I'm very glad all involved were rescued and are safe.  Maybe one day we will learn what happened so we can try to govern ourselves accordingly should we find ourselves in a similar situation.  Things can happen in the blink of an eye and these men are very lucky.  Did the boat sink completely?  I thought there was some type of inner foam to stop that from happening.  Anyone know?
820093,John Bacon,2013-11-25 00:13:00,3277,The foam can become waterlogged over time.  I know that a small piece of foam from my old boat broke off in sank to the bottom of the bilge area.  It wasn't too long after that that my boat sank.  I have been told that the new foam is better.  My old boat was a early nineties model.  Also kept the boat at the dock so it was often full of water.  It probably wouldn't be as much of an issue if the boat trailered when not in use.
820096,Steve,2013-11-25 00:19:00,2075,"the account from the rescuers was only the tip of the bow was out of the water when they arrived, and that was almost immediately after they entered the water...  so i don't believe it would be from being water logged...at least not that quickly."
820112,Sinker,2013-11-25 01:44:00,8692,"Fairly new boat as far as I understand. I can't see it being water logged. I don't think I'd even go on the water in a tracker boat now.  I totally understand not posting the story right away, those guys must be traumatized. Thank god everyone is OK....that's all that's important here.  S."
820113,fishhunter,2013-11-25 01:58:00,604,"After talking with the owner of that boat  last night for a bit im sure people will find out when he is ready to tell his story. Till then, let it go and let him deal with things."
820114,fishhunter,2013-11-25 02:01:00,604,Roy lock it down and let it lay till he is ready to tell his story.He has a lot to deal with and im sure does not need to read anymore.
820119,Moosebunk,2013-11-25 02:16:00,3970,"Some thankful fellas and a few heroes of the day are at home right now all counting their blessings.  Good show from Scott, Sheldon and all others involved.   Spent a number of days out there now, and have yet to suffer much more than a two foot chop.  Wind sites like Windguru and Windfinder do a great job steering to the best weather days, and those looking to fish the bay should consider having those sites in their back pocket.  Besides, if you have the choice of your days, calm and comfortable leads to better boat, crew, boards and lure control, and IMO are the BEST and safest days to be enjoyed on big Lady O.  No need to stress for giant gold socks cause they'll still be swimming and putting up wimpy fights the next day.  More important than the fish though, is the boat and lives within it... Know your limits and if your gut is telling you to get off the water, get off the water.  About kayakers... in the past two years I've seen a few here and there and never on a day when weather and waves was of any concern.  Even if it was, these guys are wearing their vests, have a vessel that will probably still float even if upside down, they have warm clothes on under waders to help them through the colder days fishing, they can pretty much beach wherever they want along any shoreline if safety becomes an issue AND, the fellas noted aren't at all far from the launches where they put-in anyhow.  Yeah cold water kills, but that'd be true for anyone in a boat or yak or tube that pushes their boundaries.  Happy this turned out OK... it could have been a tragic tale or reminder for us all, but instead it's just a reminder."
819832,RangerGuy,2013-11-23 18:54:00,564,"Managed an 18"" ...started at 8 finished at 11:30 do to the wind and waves.  Plowed back to glenora ferry from east of shermans.  Those big boats are gonna have a good day out there today marked a ton of fish.  This was my first trip in our 1800 Alaskan in rough water.  WOW! Awesome I got back dry...in my ranger 680 tiller I would have been soaked."
819833,lew,2013-11-23 19:10:00,12766,Good to hear the new boat worked well in the big waves Greg.
819834,Terry,2013-11-23 19:26:00,14456,18 ft tracker went down 4 guys were pulled out of the water by a charter boat. Nasty weather   We had a good day.
819835,Steve,2013-11-23 19:27:00,2075,damn ....  hope everyone was ok....sounds hairy.  good to hear you were happy with how your boat handled Greg.  much higher sides on your lund over a ranger.
819836,misfish,2013-11-23 19:29:00,29133,18 ft tracker went down 4 guys were pulled out of the water by a charter boat. Nasty weather We had a good day.  Glad all were helped out. Man was thinking of you guys. Glad yer safe bud.
819838,Steve,2013-11-23 19:36:00,2075,sounds like it was Scott Walcott (Bay of Quinte Charters) and Sheldon Hatch (Ezelo) who did the pickup.  great job boys!!!
819839,lew,2013-11-23 19:46:00,12766,"I heard about a 14' tinnie with 2 guys aboard that was missing from the Trenton area, anyone hear anymore ??"
819840,Steve,2013-11-23 19:50:00,2075,"no Lew, guys are still missing.  very sad.  went out last Tuesday evening out of Trenton.  Never returned.  Fellow was a member of Quintefishing.net  been a tough week on Quinte."
819841,Sinker,2013-11-23 19:50:00,8692,"Still no sign of them Lew. Pretty sad.  Glad everyone made out OK today, but I'm really curious to know how you swamp an 18ft boat on quinte. They must have either done something wrong, or had mechanical failure.  S."
819842,Steve,2013-11-23 19:52:00,2075,"boards out and/or riggers out, wind causes boat to turn, something gets caught in prop (rigger cable, line, etc), wave in back, done.  (not saying that is what happened)  but it is easy to happen.  had a close call in 2007. only difference was it was in december and i was the only boat on the reach. scared the crap out of me."
819843,lew,2013-11-23 19:53:00,12766,"Sad to hear the 14'er is still missing, Quinte can be nasty this time of year, specially in a small boat."
819845,Steve,2013-11-23 19:57:00,2075,"ya, the family of the poor fella has posted on quintefishing.net just asking anglers to keep their eyes open for any debris or anything....  now its just a recovery mission ...."
819846,Sinker,2013-11-23 19:57:00,8692,"Like I said, a mistake.  Sure it can happen.  Days like today, one guy has to be dedicated to running the boat. Nothing else. Just drive.   S."
819848,Steve,2013-11-23 20:00:00,2075,"absolutely Shane.  I know we always have the debate of tiller vs console.  in this case, tillers can be safer. I sit on the motor and don't leave. plus, you can lock down the tiller so it doesn't move/turn.  i've seen folks with steering wheels having a helluva time controlling their boat.....  two guys in boat, one on rod, other with the net, who has the wheel?  be safe out there guys!"
819852,lew,2013-11-23 20:16:00,12766,"A bu  but I'm really curious to know how you swamp an 18ft boat on quinte.  A group of us from this board did a November trip to Quinte a few years back and it was very rough that weekend too. Lotsa boats on the water and the only one to flounder was a bass boat. Guess the waves were just too much for them and he sunk to the gunnels and left the  3 guys terrified  One of our group towed them in and everyone stayed safe, but it sure could have had a much worse outcome."
819879,RangerGuy,2013-11-23 23:04:00,564,"Wow! Man, that is aweful! I'm glad I pulled out. I would love to learn what happen we could all learn from how this happened.  while we were launching there was 3 guys in a 17' boat with a Honda they couldn't get started. Finally they got it started and left.  I would have not gone out, especially this time of year.  Hope they were ok!"
819885,RangerGuy,2013-11-23 23:19:00,564,"Hey Terry  Did you guys get many, just curious.  I ran td-11's in clown, rainbow,firetiger and some purple/blue/pink silver color lol!  We ran over a ton of fish 5-6 big balls of bait or baits were running between 15-30' but only had one take, our boards were run at 100' & 50'.  Also I was impressed that trolling with the wind I got down to 1.9mph with the yammie, no trolling bags out either :-)  We were only out for 2 hours so didnt get alit of lure changes in.  I need more different baits lol!"
819900,Terry,2013-11-24 00:26:00,14456,15 yestarday and 11 on a short day today
819902,mike rousseau,2013-11-24 00:44:00,4661,Nice... Any piggies?
819905,Terry,2013-11-24 00:55:00,14456,12lb was the biggest this year  I think it was an ofc members boat  that sunk
819906,Terry,2013-11-24 00:55:00,14456,12lb was the biggest this year  I now think it was an ofc members boat  that sunk So I won't say anything  more. If he wants to post fine if not.  It's all good.
819913,Steve,2013-11-24 01:54:00,2075,it was an ofc member?  damn.  it will REALLY be interesting to find out what happened.
819929,RangerGuy,2013-11-24 04:25:00,564,"Well sounds like they were saved, that is the most important.  Wonder if the boat can be recovered. I feel awful for them to have to go thru that then loose such a nice boat on top of it all :-(  Wow good job on the eye's! I've never gotten more than 4 or 5 there in a day lol!"
819988,mike rousseau,2013-11-24 16:43:00,4661,Hopefully they do post what happened....  Then we can all learn a lesson...  Something must have happened to sink an 18 footer....
819991,Steve,2013-11-24 17:04:00,2075,i agree.  it would be a valuable learning experience for everyone that fishes big water.
