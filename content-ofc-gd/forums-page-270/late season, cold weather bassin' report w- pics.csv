I grumped at my wife in the summer for getting hung up on this rock twice, once on the trip in, then again on the way out, today was my turn      Damn!, stuck again, I broke a sweat while trying to get the bike out, not a good idea on a cold day     I knew Cam was about a 1/2 hour behind me with a winch and a cable so no worries     lots of water in the creeks and ponds, the lakes in Haliburton are at record levels for this time of the year      A beautiful day for fishing, the camera froze and didn't work during the period of time when we caught all the 4 to 6 pounders (Hahaha)    the only thing worse than warm beer is frozen solid beer     there's a tree blown down over the trail  ""no problem, don't bother with you bow saw Cam, I'll just bush crash around it""  Man Down!  "
