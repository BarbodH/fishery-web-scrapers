I am wanting a vest type arrangement that sits high on your chest so you can be at least waste deep. Will need to hold a couple of 4""x2"" clam style tackle boxes, and an assortment….possibly unto 15 hard baits, pliers/line/wire traces etc…etc. Needs to be lightweight…or at least not heavy material as it will be roasting hot where i am using it…..any suggestions would give me a starting point for a targeted online search.   Thanks. "

I have one of these http://www.basspro.com/White-River-Fly-Shop-Spring-Creek-Technical-Chest-Pack/product/93606/ sat in my garage that you can have if you think it'll work"
