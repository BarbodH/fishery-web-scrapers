819140,RangerGuy,2013-11-19 17:29:00,564,"Was planning on hitting Quinte this weekend.. looks like they are calling for 50km west winds, hopefully the forecast changes.  Would be some pretty big wave action with that wind I think"
819150,lew,2013-11-19 19:01:00,12766,"Hey Greg, if you don't think that old LUND of yours can handle the Quinte waves, you're welcome to  borrow the Skeeter for the weekend"
819152,RangerGuy,2013-11-19 19:10:00,564,Be careful what you offer Lew! HAHA!
819155,Terry,2013-11-19 20:30:00,14456,oh man I'm there for 3 days too ..high   winds = drunken parties and not much fishing
819161,RangerGuy,2013-11-19 22:18:00,564,Yup gonna watch the forcast...might wait till the following weekend if it doesn't change.
819162,misfish,2013-11-19 22:41:00,29133,Sounds like a great weekend to fish CHROMERS.. Just saying.  Be safe out there fellas.
819163,Pikeslayer,2013-11-19 22:42:00,1443,"I'm heading to Picton Fri - Sun as well. If anyone wants to get together for a post fishing bevy, PM me your contact info. Drunken parties are OK too as long as it's over by 5:00 am"
819241,RangerGuy,2013-11-20 14:10:00,564,"Looks like the winds are dropping.. We are going, my fingers are crossed!  Super excited I haven't been fishing since thanksgiving it will be a nice break from the slow duck hunting season we've been having.    "
819243,oldphart,2013-11-20 14:25:00,665,~~~~High of +2 winds at 25 from the west on Sat. should be okay under the Cement Plant
819252,Headhunter,2013-11-20 15:27:00,5703,  Some fish were caught on Long Reach this past weekend. HH
819256,RangerGuy,2013-11-20 16:20:00,564,"never been to picton harbour, how is the parking and what does it cost?"
819259,Steve,2013-11-20 16:26:00,2075,"with those winds adolphus reach will be tough.  you'll be limited to ""one rod per person"" water UNLESS you can duck behind the lighthouse point on the north shore.....careful water comes up shallow quickly but we often do well just NE of the lighthouse.  watch the gusts.....  oh - and have fun"
819261,lew,2013-11-20 16:31:00,12766,Alot of the long time OFC members will recall the 1st fall Quinte G2G we did when we had the HUGE waves down there.  Tough fishing for sure but we had a blast that weekend.
819263,Headhunter,2013-11-20 16:47:00,5703,"  Parking, especially this time of year is the challenge. Don't, I repeat don't park in the hotel parking lot as folks have been getting tickets... it's private property. You might have to do some walking to get a safe place to park.  We were up last weekend. Mid week last week, our trip looked like a write off based on the forecast for pretty high winds. Well, I'm glad we didn't take too much notice as Saturday turned out to be a great day on the water. Moral of the story, don't let the weather man mess with your plans! HH"
819266,lew,2013-11-20 16:59:00,12766,"If you take the ferry across to the east side of the bay, travel about 2 miles along #33 and you'll see a trailer park on the right. It's got a good ramp into Adolphus Reach and there won't be any traffic and there's acres to park in.  If their closed, go just a bit further on 33 and turn left on #8 and go north 1 mile to Dorland. There's another camp ground on your left that we stayed in for years. It's a decent dirt ramp and again there's acres to park in.  Don't know if either place is open this time of year Greg, but it's another option for you."
819268,Steve,2013-11-20 17:10:00,2075,"adolphustown park is open....  but it is very very shallow lew.  water levels are a bit better this year, but the last number of years that launch has been a no-go. (and i run a 17' tiller boat).  i love that launch however (if it was deeper).  tons of parking and little traffic. puts your right in the heart of the fishing."
819271,lew,2013-11-20 17:22:00,12766,"I haven't stayed in  Adolphustown for probably 15 years Steve and didn't realise it's too shallow now. The other camp at Dorland was usable until about 5 years ago, but it may be too shallow now too.  Oh well, it was a thought."
819277,Steve,2013-11-20 17:49:00,2075,"that dorland ramp is VERY secretive ...  your probably the first person i've seen mention it in all my years on the net.  superdad showed it to me a few years back.  when i used to do my late december trips, we stayed in Haybay, so the dorland ramp was the closest to our trailer park.  ahhhh those were good memories....cold...but fun!"
819282,lew,2013-11-20 18:11:00,12766,"Steve, we stayed in the Dorland park for probably 15-20 years on our annual spring Quinte trip. Nothing fancy but a decent place to throw up some tents and great fishing just a short boat ride away.  Here's a favorite pic of mine taken down at the water front.  I miss those days.  "
819283,Headhunter,2013-11-20 18:19:00,5703,"There is a launch on the south side of the Telegraph narrows bridge. It may be nasty for a short time in west winds and you will have to run around Forresters Island, which would be pretty rough, but once past Forresters, Long Reach would be relatively easy to fish... relatively! There's also the launch at Deseronto, but I would bet that launch would be problematic with a west wind gaining strength all the way from Big Bay, through Telegragh Narrows. HH  Edit: Telegraph launch is on the south side just as you get over the bridge."
819289,RangerGuy,2013-11-20 18:53:00,564,"Thank you guys!.. I'm bring'n my wife and sister-in-law out for the day so I'm hoping the wind lets up and to find a easy place to launch.  We got stuck at the ferry once .. it took my wife and 3 guys waiting to launch, to hold the ranger off the dock & rocks while I got the truck.... that was about as tough a time I've ever had  pulling a boat out."
819295,Headhunter,2013-11-20 19:31:00,5703,Not a launch I would consider with 50K west winds... HH
819297,mike rousseau,2013-11-20 19:41:00,4661,This time of year I'll take 25 km winds any day....  Walleye chop... Lol...  Nothing wrong with big waves if you can handle yourself in them... Just takes longer to travel any distance on plane....  I'll be out there Saturday....
819301,RangerGuy,2013-11-20 21:02:00,564,"I can deal with 25km , 50 I'm not sure I wanna try that there hahaha!  keep an eye out for a camo Lund Alaskan tiller, that will be me wave hi :-)  kind of hard to get close with 4 boards out hahaha!"
819321,Big Cliff,2013-11-20 23:40:00,6899,"Some of the best walleye fishing I ever had on Quinte was in 4-6' waves. (Note, I didn't say the most comfortable fishing LOL)"
