819875,Handlebarz,2013-11-23 22:47:00,3790,Dang I thought we had snow coming but it must have been fluff from dandelions as when I came back out side there was nothing on the ground just the way it should be
819880,Fisherman,2013-11-23 23:05:00,7201,"Well, they all must have been on their way to the Darwin awards.  Just prior to the pile up, police had radar on, most traffic rolling at 125km/h.  Just got that off the news."
819883,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-23 23:16:00,4399,Sounds about right when I was coming down from Orillia there was still the odd tool in a pick-up that was driving way too fast for the conditions. Oddly enough after passing the accident people slowed down I guess after seeing the carnage they figured it might be slippery.
819887,SirCranksalot,2013-11-23 23:38:00,3291,"We've got friends leaving Peterboro at 5 and heading to Casino Rama Brian, maybe not such a good idea from looking at your pictures.  Sound like bit of a gamble to me!"
819889,Raf,2013-11-23 23:44:00,3495,Car went off 109 into the grand river this afternoon.  109/9 still closed.  long way down off that bridge.
819911,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-24 01:28:00,4399,Just saw the interview with the guy that lost his boat...he said ya just heading up to Simcoe to do a little fishing....I have to ask why in the world would somebody do that with a winter storm warning high winds and zero visability...perhaps the accident saved him from drowning.
819922,Twocoda,2013-11-24 03:48:00,4130,"5 car pile up just south of Port Elgin...from the looks of the one truck the tow truck driver had cradled....ill find it hard to believe if they survived....slow down people,,,its still really nasty out"
819934,glen,2013-11-24 04:42:00,2641,"I went out and nearly froze my ears off just putting gas in the car.  Windchill was nasty.  Cancelled my trip today.  Got 4"" and it ain't snowing any more.  I hope that's it for winter."
819940,danc,2013-11-24 05:09:00,4677,No snow here yet but plenty of cold. -19 here this morning. I hate it.
819956,Rod Caster,2013-11-24 13:16:00,5784,-14 here and JUST enough snow to test out the new sled.      Oh and i've calculated that it would take just over 3months to pile up 40 cars on my road haha.
819958,Fisherman,2013-11-24 13:31:00,7201,"Just put up a ""free beer ahead"" sign on your road..that'll speed up the process a bit.."
819994,Freshtrax,2013-11-24 17:14:00,2215,About a foot here in alliston.  Im headed into town to get some gas to fire up the sled:)
820009,wildeye rainbow,2013-11-24 17:59:00,123,"If you want snow, come on down to St Thomas!  I woke up this morning to 4 ft of snow on the deck so I took the dog out front.  Dang almost the same thing - 3ft of snow on the front walk.  there is still 2 ft on the road, so it looks like I'm staying put for a while"

819801,MJL,2013-11-23 16:30:00,2427,"Hopefully it wasn't too major and no serious injuries. 2 weeks ago with just a small dusting of snow, I was stuck just north of 89 when there was only a 3 car accident - All 3 lanes blocked. I ended up chatting to family next to me for an hour and a half while we were parked. They gave me a breakfast wrap from Timmies  . I was only 300m away from my off-ramp  Can't imagine how long it's going to take to clear 40 cars."
819802,misfish,2013-11-23 16:31:00,29133,Snow squals here and there. 2-3 inches in some places. Just back from a nice walk through the bush. Was nice and sunny there.LOL  My new friend.  
819806,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-23 16:46:00,4399,"Just drove through that area south bound from orillia and the roads were not too bad, the pile up had just happened when I went through. At the time of the accident there was white out conditions and hard packed snow/ice going north not sure why the sanders were not out. Leading the pack at the front of the accident was a pickup pulling a boat he ended up sideways across the highway boat was off the trailer and looked like a write off...motor may have survived with minor damage. Saw lots of people driving with out their lights on in blizzard conditions smarten up people."
