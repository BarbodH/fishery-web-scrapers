819253,rbaquial,2013-11-20 15:55:00,968,"Hi Fellow Addicts,  I am planning on hitting Tottenham Pond this Friday (11/22/2013) - Just looking @ places to park....I noticed there's a little ""U-Shaped"" lot (Industrial and 4 Line) - Am I able to park there? I am looking through Google Maps and I've noticed there's a sign there - but based on what I can see - it doesn't look like a ""no-parking"" sign? I'm not sure.  Google Map these Coordinates:  Also.....Would anyone care to join as well? I'll more than likely be all day @ this...depending on situation. (Grandfather is in hospital care (Palliative Care) - trying to get my mind off things for awhile)  Thanks All, RoB (A2F)"
