He reflexively reached out, grabbed it out of the air, and handed it back.'Oh my, I am so sorry,' the woman said, as she popped her eye back in place. 'Let me buy your dinner to make it up to you.'They enjoyed a wonderful dinner together, and afterwards they went to the theatre followed by drinks... They talked, they laughed, she shared her deepest dreams and he shared his. She listened to him with interest.After paying for everything, she asked him if he would like to come to her place for a nightcap and stay for breakfast. They had a wonderful, wonderful time.The next morning, she cooked a gourmet meal with all the trimmings. The guy was amazed. Everything had been so incredible!'You know,' he said, 'you are the perfect woman.. Are you this nice to every guy you meet?''No,' she replies. . .....Wait for it ..... ......It's coming ...... ......The suspense is killing you, isn't it?She said .... ......:'You just happened to catch my eye.'"

819978,kickingfrog,2013-11-24 16:00:00,8333,"Reminds me of a joke that my dad loved to tell:  A very self conscious guy with a wooden eye sees a pretty girl at the bar. Her nose is a little out of proportion for her face but still very attractive. He works up the courage to approach her and say ""Hi"". They have a nice conversation and he starts to feel less conscious about his wooden eye. A slow song starts to play and he asks her to dance. She says, ""Would eye?"" He yells ""Big nose!"" ""Big nose!"" and runs out of the bar."
