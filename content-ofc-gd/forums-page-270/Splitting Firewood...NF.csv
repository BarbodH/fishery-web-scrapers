819829,Big Cliff,2013-11-23 18:35:00,6899,"I am surprised at all the different replies! When I lived up North all we ever used was an axe to split our wood, (and we split a lot of wood every winter) a good sharp axe with with a broad back so it acted like a wedge. Sharp ment it would drive deep into the block, the broad back forced the wood to split. We did split most of our wood when it was frozen especially the bigger tougher blocks which really does help, I can't remember us ever having to use a wedge.  A lot of it had to do with many of the things mentioned here; watch the grain of the wood, split between knots, make sure the block is turned the right way but the swing was probably the most important. You had to follow through, if all you tried to do was drive the axe into the top of the block, that is about all you did but if you tried to drive it through the block the result was much more positive. The other thing was using the momentum of the axe to do the work, hard to describe in writing but easy to show someone, a good swing started with the axe at your feet and was much like a golf swing (but in reverse) smooth and with that follow through.  Next time you are up this way Steve, stop by and I'll show you what I mean, you'll be amazed at how much easier it is."
819837,Bernie,2013-11-23 19:30:00,3190,"I agree with Big Cliff on the axe.I have a maul, but it was the lightest one I could find.I have been keeping an eye out for a good splitting axe head. I'll make my own handle."
819844,Sinker,2013-11-23 19:54:00,8692,"I find the ""splitting axe's"" will drive the thin end into the wood easy, but a lot of time, they will bounce back out. Especially if its good hardwood.  The maul works best IMO, and I split A LOT of wood! I do it at home, and at work. About 6 bush cords at work, and 3-4 at home. I use the splitter at home though.....work is too cheap! LOL  What kind of wood were you splitting Steve? Makes a big difference too. Oak, Ash, and maple are a dream. Anything that's twisted and knotty is much, much harder.  S.  S."

Anything that's twisted and knotty is much, much harder.  S.  S. It is good maple Shayne. It had already been cut to stove length...just needed splitting. But the troublesome pieces where  a section of the tree where it appears  2 trunks or the trunk and a big branch grew into each other. That combined with some gnarly twisted grain and some 4 inch knots made it a real workout."

When I got my 5LBer it was the heaviest one I could find at the time around here. I just figured that was as heavy as they got.  Check at Princess Auto, 8lb for $36."

There has to be an easier way?"

Today I grabbed a wood wedge at HomeDepot. Not happy with it at all. It is dull and I can't pound it into the wood without a ton of effort. If I put an edge on it I'm sure it will help. I got through all the wood I have for now but was wondering if anyone has any tips or ""tricks of the trade"" to make my next go around a little easier...cause I'm not getting any younger  This is strictly for home use and I actually enjoy the workout...so I have no intention of investing in a splitter. My aching body would appreciate any  gems you can share."

Its a great workout and I find its easier to split frozen.Plus you don't work up such a sweat doing in the winter months. What kind of wood is it your splitting?IMHO Wood wedges are for felling trees not splitting wood..

819627,aplumma,2013-11-22 20:05:00,6896,I had an iron wood tree at one point and took a chainsaw to it and it sparked the chain. I never tried to cut on that tree again. They do make a fine walking stick though.   Art

819640,fish_fishburn,2013-11-22 20:56:00,1311,Get an 8 or 10 lb maul

819651,Bernie,2013-11-22 21:52:00,3190,"Depending on the size of the log, what kind of wood and whether the grain of the wood is twisted. Don't try to split a large one down the center. Take it off the side to begin and work your way around it. Look at the log and how the grain goes. Avoid areas that have cut off branches. Not many I can't split up, even in the summer. The ones that give me a hard time I set aside and start a cut/split with the chain saw, then finish it off with the axe."
819658,Fisherman,2013-11-22 22:06:00,7201,"What Bernie said, and pay attention which direction the tree grew.  Cut with the top of the tree pointed down, if you can't figure that out, look at which way the branch stubbs are pointing.  Steel wedge and 14 pound sledge. And wear safety glasses, they stop your eyeballs from falling out from the pain if you wack yerself in the shins with a 14lb sledgehammer."
819675,bigugli,2013-11-22 22:42:00,6138,"A) Your maul is too light. I had 12 and 14lb mauls. If you can wait til the sap freezes, better. C) Large logs you work from the outside in, else you will bury the maul in the center. You can also work a split line by making hits in line from one side to the other across a large log. D) Twisted grains, like on Boxelder, Elms, etc.., are just a pain."
819694,aplumma,2013-11-22 23:16:00,6896,The frozen wood thinggy I would not have known about it rarely gets down that cold for long enough for me to have noticed. Thanks OFC I learned something new every day here.   Art
819733,woodenboater,2013-11-23 01:19:00,2277,"If you've got a chainsaw, try noodling the round then working it down it in sections."
819735,nancur373,2013-11-23 01:29:00,1211,  Applies to wood splitting also.
819742,OhioFisherman,2013-11-23 01:52:00,6623,"Use the heaviest maul you can comfortably handle, yes the wood does split easier when it is frozen.  Wedges? They are not all equal no matter how much you pay for them. Some of the best I found were at flea markets, and you could tell by looking at them they had been heavily used, probably because they worked well.  Some wood splits a lot easier than others, my favorite is Oak, for the effort involved it burns a long time and hot. Pine splits easily, but is a flash in the pan, all we used it for were bonfires.  The grain of  the wood will also make a difference in easy of splitting. Wood where large branches or stumps joined can be a pain to split.  My parents had an extra garage 250 feet behind their home, and my youngest brother had a tree service. We had split wood stacked up on both sides of the drive the whole way back to it. It became so much easier when he got a splitter. LOL"

819825,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-23 18:00:00,2582,Thx all for the replies. Especially the advise about eye protection....I never would have considered that a problem.  I have always heard splitting when the wood is frozen makes it easier...but I have a bit of a space consideration so I pretty much have to chop it up as I get it.  I'm not a newbie when it comes to splitting firewood...it's just that this batch was very knotty and extra difficult. It was the picked over crap left from the city cutting down a big tree....you know the stuff you generally say isn't worth the effort and leave for someone else....groan.    Anything I have split previously to now was handled with my 5 LB maul no problem.  I think I'll get myself a heavier maul....anybody have a recommendation which one to get or even where to get it? When I got my 5LBer it was the heaviest one I could find at the time around here. I just figured that was as heavy as they got.  P.S. Thx for the splitter offer Shayne...much appreciated.  But for all the wood I use I'll take the aching muscles for now.
