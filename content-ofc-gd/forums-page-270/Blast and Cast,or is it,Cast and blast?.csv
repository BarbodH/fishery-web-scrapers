818768,misfish,2013-11-16 20:54:00,29133,"Was told about spending a day called cast and blast. This is where you hunt then fish then hunt again. Cool way to spend a day. Kinda like a surf and turf day.  Lets just say,casting was a blast. LOL  Choice of arms,    Only surfed a couple today. But with no turf,I decided to let them swim free for another day.      Casting is a blast."
