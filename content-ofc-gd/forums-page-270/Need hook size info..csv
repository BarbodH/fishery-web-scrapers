I assume these are USA sizes and are those the same as canadian?   http://www.basspro.com/Offshore-Angler-Green-Ultraskin-Sabiki-Rigs-with-Fluorocarbon-Leader/product/53204/?cmCat=CROSSSELL_PRODUCT   thanks in advance."

820206,limeyangler,2013-11-25 18:38:00,5204,"Lol…thanks guys…so the people on Basspro site say size 3 is smallest, according to you guys…one is saying bigger number smaller hook, one is saying smaller number smaller hook."
820211,gaspumper,2013-11-25 18:53:00,393,The bigger the number the smaller the hook = a #10 hook is smaller then a #8 hook.A #1/0 hook is smaller then a #4/0 hook
820213,limeyangler,2013-11-25 19:14:00,5204,Ok…thats why i'm confused. The guy at Basspro said the opposite for the item i posted a link to….and a size 3 hook by your suggestion would be huge for a sabiki lure.
820216,Fishnwire,2013-11-25 19:36:00,983,"Hook sizes are the same as cable gauge.  The larger the number, the smaller the size/gauge...up to zero.  Then it goes 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, etc.  The actual size of hooks is not standard across the industry.  One company's #2 might be the same physical size as another company's #1 or #3...or whatever."
820218,GBW,2013-11-25 20:02:00,8460,"Howah! Thanks for that link GBW, very helpful! No prob.  A slow day around the house here so glad to help out...  LOL!"

820238,misfish,2013-11-25 21:57:00,29133,"All I know is,when I tie a #8 fly,I can see the eye of the hook. When I try to tie a #14,Im well you know,Im ****.LOL  Always thought the lower # was the bigger."
820268,limeyangler,2013-11-25 23:11:00,5204,Me too Brian….use #22 when river fishing in France and England….cant even see the hook let alone the eye.
