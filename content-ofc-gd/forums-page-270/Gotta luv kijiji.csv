819347,Steve,2013-11-21 03:22:00,2075,"anyone feel they are potentially supporting a black market of stolen goods by purchasing items that are ""too good to be true deals"" on KIJIJI/Craigs List/ Etc?  I read an article this past summer from a thief that was eventually caught where he explained he sold all his stolen items on KIJIJI."
819425,fishindevil,2013-11-21 22:41:00,6254,"Well yes there is tons of scams out there on all those for sale websites !!! But I would never buy a big ticket item without all the documents anyways and yes usually if it sounds too good to be true than it probably is !!!! I had a guy call about my boat and said he would transfer money into my account and send a guy to pick up my boat at the same time !!!! I told him to and hung up the phone !!!! Haha so ya you just have to be careful and smart that's all !!! But yes if you know something is worth say $2,000 and he wants it gone fast right away and only wants $400 and has to have the money right now and fast and has no address and stuff well yes then it's probly stolen or a scam !!!!!"
819442,Richie Razor,2013-11-22 00:42:00,536,"Amazing how some freely give out private details online like addresses and phone numbers to anyone who asks!!! Unreal.  The rules are simple;  * after a few emails of qualifying the buyer, ask for his phone number * call them and if possible meet in a public place, has station, Tim's, or mall parking lot * exchange nothing but cold, hard, cash.  That's it, pretty simple."
819533,RangerGuy,2013-11-22 12:58:00,564,"That's what was crazy.... I did get low ballers on line, so I either ignored or asked them if they are smoking something LOL!..  ...but the real frustrating people were the ones that showed up and offered like 1500-2000 (for a 5yr old cert'd car) and want me to bend over backwards to help them get it on the road CRAZY!!!!  One guy even wanted me to get him plates and drive it to scarborough for him ...."
819540,SirCranksalot,2013-11-22 13:45:00,3291,Kijiji is not much different from anything else. The weird walk among us! I think you an usually tell on a phone call if you are dealing with a straight up guy/gal or someone trying to jerk you around. When we last moved it was quite useful in giving away a bunch of 'student grade' furniture. We could have gotten a few bucks I guess if we wanted to deal with a bunch of e-mails and phone calls. On a lighter note---I put something up for free not long ago. Somebody asked me if I could deliver it to Innisfil at 5PM that day!! Everyone's a comedian!!!
819542,mosquito,2013-11-22 13:54:00,111,"....the worst part is having to use your email,and then you get tons of spam junk mail crap...but its worth it for sure and its free....  Simple, Don't use your real email!  Especially if it has your full name on the email, any idiot can look up your address in Canada 411 and as I mentioned in an earlier post when I started my clean up I just created a yahoo email account with a generic name. (ideas... ""Cleaning up"", ""Is it Friday yet"", ""Wishing I was Fishing""....) You can block the idiots easily, the idiots don't know your real name and you can check it when you want... the select all and delete works wonders    if you haven't used it for awhile."

819584,Handlebarz,2013-11-22 17:42:00,3790,It's not just kijiji I get people wanting me to drive 20 min- a hour away to meet them to sell them one lure. As much as I like to meet people and be supported I cant justify burning more in gas then I would make.  I have met people out on LSC to deliver my baits as well as used baits that I had on sale using the message boards that happens all the time.  I have had great dealings with kijiji buying and selling. One of the best was lead to make sinkers they had 60 lbs for $60 obo I offered $30 they agreed so I drove 20 min to meet them when I got there they did not have 60lbs it totalled 183lbs I think I won that round.

819145,mosquito,2013-11-19 18:37:00,111,"I have had some real odd calls since I started cleaning up, I follow some simple rules that Kijiji has right in their suggestions.... NEVER give out personal information and meet them in a public place..... I would say that includes the phone number. I just meet them down near the local Tim Hortons to exchange items.Since I have started my cleanup I have had been joined for a coffee to chat and also had lots of guys that I am glad they have no clue where I live. I have had a few that will send you email after email asking for your address or phone number and seem to just want my address or phone number.... when you hear of robberies etc.... I'll stick to Kijiji's advice.I have been doing some cleanup and created a yahoo email just for kijiji ing (not your real name in the email or title), then just ban emails for the idiots.... and never give out your phone number. If you call them....*67 before you dial the number blocks call display on the land line and #31# on the cell phone.  I have had a couple items that just woundn't sell and had dropped the price several times, then I just left if off for a week and put it back at a price jacked way up above the first price and someone will buy it at that price, no offers... just I want it, here's the money, thanks and good buy... go figure."

I can't believe how many people want to negotiate a price without even looking at the item. I could understand it if they came out and looked first, then wanted to negotiate. I've waited around for people who couldn't get their s&%t together enough to even show up when they said they would. I sold a van a few months ago and the first caller I had, was the one to take it. We did negotiate a price over the phone in that case and he was true to his word. He also told me that he appreciated me being true to mine. He said the truck was everything I claimed it was and he was pleased with the deal. In this case, he was a long ways from me and was tied up with work for a week or so. He said he would take it site unseen for the price we agreed to, but didn't expect me to wait for him. Turned out the others were so screwed up that it just worked out that it was still available when he got back from his out of town job.  I think items of a lower value (under $1,000.00) might be easier."

Picked them up.  4 sets of skis and bindings in brand new condition.  4 pairs of boots, still in the box.  4 sets of poles, and 4 travel bags/   Everything is in brand new condition..

I not saying someone is going to kidnap me for goodness sakes, but I don't like the idea of inviting some characters I have no clue as to who they are and what they're up to coming to home for me to make a few hundred bucks. Many no good dirty thieves use online websites to case places. Yes I'm very cynical now, life's experiences have made me get that way. I could always put a few more bucks into my jeans, but at what price? Security out in the sticks here is non existent during the winter.  My kid brother sells online regularly, I told him if some characters that look like they need a hit of oxycontin tell them it's sold before they go into the garage. It may be Rob Ford campaigning though."

The fellow said the he only used the item twice, by the time I showed up, the item was at least 20 years old antique carpet shampooer, I said it was very old, he replied he was not the first owner, since I did not ask , but he insisted he used it twice.  2, After I showed up to buy some electronics, another buyer was also there almost the same time, the seller wanted highest bidder!  3. I showed up and want to test the item, it was not working, he originally advertised that it worked the last time he tested it, I then ask when he tested it, the fellow responded............ a year ago.  4. I was giving away free stuff and few responded, the first person who wanted it did not show. I have re-post the ad."
