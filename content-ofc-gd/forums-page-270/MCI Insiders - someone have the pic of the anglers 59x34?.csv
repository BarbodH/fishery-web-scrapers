820176,Muskieman,2013-11-25 15:28:00,2472," I think that technologies have allowed people to go out much later into winter to target world record musky.  Some musky guides have spent decades targeting biggest muskies  (in Nov., Dec.) on St. Lawrence/Ottawa R. or Georgian Bay.like Mike Lazurus. This has resulted in a couple of near 60 lb. musky with all that time and effort for him.  This 59 by 34 in.fish is largest caught if accurately measured. I agree..."
820183,muskymatt,2013-11-25 16:05:00,2608,"I think the VHS virus in 2004-2007 that ravaged the St.Lawrence gave way for the healthiest, strongest and best genetics of the remaining Muskies to flourish. It's been about 10 years, just enough time for them to turn into giants."
820190,JoshS,2013-11-25 16:43:00,729,I get how the guys don't want the publicity.. but seems there is way more hype now that the pic is being held back. So much controversy in the musky record world. Can't wait until someone catches and keeps a giant and puts it all to rest. Regardless it's a undoubtedly massive pig and awesome accomplishment.. hope they didn't catch it on a jig and minnow lol. Congrats to the gentlemen who released it.
820195,Rich Nelson,2013-11-25 17:29:00,332,"Every year there are stories of huge fish, and many turn out to be Bull. Some nice fish, but for some reason, many guys lie about size, and add inches or pounds to their fish. Not sure what the point of that is, and who they think they are competing with. Not saying this rumoured fish isn't legit, as I really have no idea, but it's understandable if guys are doubtful givin the enormous reported size of this fish. Hopefully some pics are released for us to enjoy, and it would be cool if it is a true giant. Good on them for releasing it, and there is no such thing as a catch and release record..."
820224,Handlebarz,2013-11-25 20:53:00,3790,"Matt we are watching the girth of the musky on LSC grow each year also. And the numbers of fish in the 35-45"" range are huge here. Many of us thank the VHS virus for doing what Mother Nature has always done take out the weak and let the strong grow."
820270,landry,2013-11-25 23:14:00,1005,I think its unfair to throw daggers at this guy. I would have bonked it just to end the debate. Good for him for releasing it. I am curious about this fish and want to see pics. Some of these comments are exactly why some super fish never hit the internet boards. I will take his word as true even though other fish in the past have been blatant exaggeration a or lies. I will let you decide which ones I am talking about. Landry
820287,Handlebarz,2013-11-25 23:42:00,3790,From what I understand the release of this I do was not supposed to happen until the Mci release journal was out and at that time the picture would have been out also.  I hope all the negative stuff not here but on other sites does not keep the pictures from getting released.  The guy that caught it is a dedicated musky fisherman. Josh it was not a jig and minnow this time. Just a good guy that has finally caught his fish of a lifetime.
820289,Whitespinnerbait,2013-11-25 23:48:00,2038,"Once you've seen one Big Musky, you've seen them all"
820294,chris.brock,2013-11-25 23:59:00,4053,"I have seen the picture on Thursday night and it is a beast. I actually agree they didn't want the attention good guys and don't want any issues. It will come out later  interesting story, where do these guys usually fish? St Lawrence R ?"
820318,Ron,2013-11-26 01:08:00,1683,Chris Purdy caught a Muskie? I don't believe it for one minute! lmao!

819745,Steve,2013-11-23 01:58:00,2075,We all want to see this pig?!!!!  Released as well.
819746,mike rousseau,2013-11-23 02:18:00,4661,They're trying to build up hype online before the pic is released...  Trying to promote muskies canada or something...
819749,Gregoire,2013-11-23 02:48:00,1397,"No pics yet. Love it or hate it, the musky industry is all about promotion."

819770,lew,2013-11-23 13:07:00,12766,"they didn't want the attention good guys and don't want any issues.  Can't blame them for that, too many times when  someone posts a monster musky picture, all the ""experts"" tear them apart."
819780,Pigeontroller,2013-11-23 14:29:00,2793,"This has got nothing to do with Muskies Canada other than it was an Ottawa Chapter member who caught it, not John Anderson by the way. The Gentleman who caught this fish is a humble retired guy who is trying to avoid this becoming a big sh*tshow.  I haven't seen the pic(s) either.  And Ex Musky Mike, comments like that have no merit."
819781,esoxansteel,2013-11-23 14:56:00,1307,"They're trying to build up hype online before the pic is released...  Trying to promote muskies canada or something...     Other then it was caught by a MCI member, i do not see any self-promotion, or promotion of MCI what so ever."
819786,Steve,2013-11-23 15:55:00,2075,can't argue someone not wanting it to become a crap show. definitely.
819789,mike rousseau,2013-11-23 16:01:00,4661,"Go to ""Ottawa river musky factory"" Facebook page...  Top post repeatedly mentions musky canada and the story being released in their journal...  So yeah... MISKIES CANADA is going to get a lot of attention because theyll have the exclusive story..."
819790,mike rousseau,2013-11-23 16:02:00,4661,I don't care what they do with they're story or picture... I just want to see this animal....
819793,mike rousseau,2013-11-23 16:07:00,4661,I wasn't trying to be negative... Just posting what I heard... What I read... On a Facebook page of a well respected and trusted angler...  And until the story and picture are released rumors and assumptions will be all over the net....  Yours truelly  EX MUSKY MIKE...   LMAO!!!!!
819803,Handlebarz,2013-11-23 16:37:00,3790,I know the guy who caught it also and he is not one for trying to get hype at all. He is just a good guy that has put in his time and has paid his dues. I must say when I was talking to him some time after he caught the beast it had to be hard to not talk about it as I know I could not keep my mouth shut about it if it was in my net. His story will be released in the MCI RJ and I cant wait to read it. I also hope it does help to bring some good light to MCI and maybe pick up some members as we do have a great bunch of members here. I know there will be another big fish story in there as well it should make for some good winter reading.  For now Kudos to him
819805,Steve,2013-11-23 16:45:00,2075,"you mean he's not interested in parading the fish to every show in North America, asking if folks want his autograph."
819815,Moosebunk,2013-11-23 17:22:00,3970,"No rush.  Angler will tell his tale how he sees fit.  His catch, his life.  Looking forward to viewing this giant as I've take a much bigger interest in muskies this past fall, and this fish is a biggun judging by these preliminary details.  LSC, Nipissing, St. Larry's, Ottawa, and even Rideau (for it's size) have all coughed up some great specimens seen online through 2013.  Awesome to know the quality of the fishery is what it is, and that by some people's view is improving each year."
819873,Pigeontroller,2013-11-23 22:21:00,2793,"The FB page belongs to a Guide, who is a member of the Ottawa Chapter of Muskies Canada. The Guide just might be using this fish and MCI as a way of promoting his business.  The Angler who caught the fish is choosing to tell the story through the Muskies Canada newsletter."
819881,Steve,2013-11-23 23:06:00,2075,is the guide representing the fish as his?
819898,Pigeontroller,2013-11-24 00:17:00,2793,is the guide representing the fish as his?  No.
820135,GbayGiant,2013-11-25 03:40:00,1780,"""they didn't want the attention good guys and don't want any issues'  Yet here it is on OFC.  IW's!  Can't wait to hear the Giant Tale."
820138,ehg,2013-11-25 04:28:00,2666,Just curious of potential weight.  http://www.muskyhunter.com/weight-calculator/  According to the above link that fish would weigh about 85.25 lbs.  The largest dozen or so caught and weighed fish were between 58-65 lbs. Ken O'Brien's 65 lber was apparently 58 by 30.25 in.  That this fish is so much bigger is.....odd.
820159,Rich Nelson,2013-11-25 12:36:00,332,"Speculating about weight is wasting your time. The formulas are not accurate, especially when it come to big fish. A scale is the only way. Is that not Dale Mcnairs claimed 57 by 33 in your avatar?"
820161,Richie Razor,2013-11-25 13:18:00,536,"This guy is gonna have one hell time with all the Bromance's he's gonna experience in the next year.  Signing autographs and body parts, taking pictures, not to mention the hoards of groupies - Doesn't get anymore Rockstar than this.  Sounds like a lot of Bromance's developing on this thread too. Crazy what a mammoth Ski will get you."

Ya, using a weight calculator is only speculation.  But whatever, this fish sounds like it would be largest musky ever caught if measurements are accurate. Have to wait for MCI's next issue i guess."
820172,Muskieman,2013-11-25 15:09:00,2472,"Seems like every year the fish are getting bigger and bigger , I have to wonder , is it because more anglers are targeting Muskie and go out later and later in the season , or with good genetics is the species evolving into a general population of larger specimens , I'd like to hear Darwin's take on the subject."
