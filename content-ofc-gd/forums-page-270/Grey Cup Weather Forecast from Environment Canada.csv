819971,Handlebarz,2013-11-24 15:14:00,3790,My brother has a restaurant out in SK and just got tickets Friday night he asked if I wanted to go. I sure do but flights were $800-$2000 to get out and back on Monday do you think they were jacked up for a reason lol.  Well I will be watching from my living room a comfy 65 with the fireplace going as he freezes live.  Go 13th man
819974,kickingfrog,2013-11-24 15:43:00,8333,There's gota be a 4-5 connection flight from Detroit to Regina that would be cheaper no?
819996,Handlebarz,2013-11-24 17:19:00,3790,Did not look at Detroit I did Windsor London and Toronto. I am a cfl fan and a riders fan but not for that price heck that's a week camping with boat rental
