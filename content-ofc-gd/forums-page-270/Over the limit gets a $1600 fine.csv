819479,porkpie,2013-11-22 02:17:00,2521,"Nail on head.  Buddy kept himself 32 smolts for the fry pan no doubt.  A crappy deal all around, however some of the suggested punishments are a bit over the top.  We can barely get appropriate jail time for sexual predators in this country, and people are calling for jail time over fisheries offences?"
819490,bigmac1984,2013-11-22 02:52:00,193,"$1600 isn't a big fine if you consider he may be selling the fish and making money on it as others have suggested. I agree though, some of the suggested punishments are over the top."
819493,Richie Razor,2013-11-22 02:54:00,536,Don't get me wrong sexual predators should be burned at the stake!!!
819830,Gallie,2013-11-23 18:40:00,1215,Im just glad someone got caught. Somewhat stiffer penalties would be welcome though
819936,Tootsie II,2013-11-24 04:49:00,162,"The article did not say whether the judge heard the whole case in a trial by Judge only and then found him guilty, which meant he probably would have had to hire a lawyer or whether or not the accused entered a guilty plea under a deal with the Crown and his lawyer. Even if he pleads guilty, the judge must still ""hear"" the evidence to arrive at a sentence even if it's a negotiated one. Usually the Crown will agree to a reduced penalty if they can save the time and cost of trial and still get a conviction."
819979,BillM,2013-11-24 16:03:00,17367,"I bet Dave is right, not very hard to catch 32 steelhead smolts up in the place that guy was fishing, lol."
820010,ch312,2013-11-24 18:03:00,1590,"$1600 isn't a big fine if you consider he may be selling the fish and making money on it as others have suggested. I agree though, some of the suggested punishments are over the top.  34 bows that are small enough to fit into one cooler wouldn't be worth much would they? When was the last time anyone ordered trout at a restaurant and was offered a perch sized fillet?  I think the punishment was appropriate if this was a first offense."
820014,ch312,2013-11-24 18:18:00,1590,FYI...there is only one listing for someone with that name in Woodbridge. Who wants to call and ask for the full story to end all this assumption?

819349,Joeytier,2013-11-21 03:43:00,3990,The guy had 32 rainbows in his van???  Unreal
819350,Freshtrax,2013-11-21 03:45:00,2215,Should have been 16000
819351,Christopheraaron,2013-11-21 03:50:00,3525,"3 year suspension isn't bad, but the fine should have been higher."
819354,Tim Mills,2013-11-21 04:11:00,476,I'm not sure what the punishment should be but what he got isn't enough
819360,Richie Razor,2013-11-21 04:57:00,536,"What do you even do with 32 rainbows? I bet some were intended for the tomatoe garden.  A lifetime ban should be given plus jail time, plus community service at local spring fishing shows"
819361,redpearl99,2013-11-21 05:34:00,259,i couldnt catch 32 rainbows in september if i tried
819363,mike rousseau,2013-11-21 07:16:00,4661,Think a bit...  Lifetime ban = no more license dollars from the individual.... That's just not smart business wide...  Jail = cost to taxpayers....  A large fine works best... Then put the money to something good like stocking...
819364,glen,2013-11-21 07:53:00,2641,How many times has he done it and not been caught.  Does he sell to a resturant.
819366,fishindevil,2013-11-21 09:02:00,6254,The fine amount is a joke !!!!! They should seize the van and auction it off as well not really much of a deterent .....
819367,flippin,2013-11-21 10:21:00,34,The fine amount is a joke !!!!! They should seize the van and auction it off as well not really much of a deterent ..... Agreed! Bet he was selling them to a restaurant or trading it for free dinners. Alot of that goes on around here. flip
819368,RangerGuy,2013-11-21 11:10:00,564,"Yup they should seize everything and it should be a min of 50,000 dollar fine!  Good old Canadian justice... ""Here is your slap on the wrist., Now don't do that again!"""
819378,Richie Razor,2013-11-21 14:02:00,536,"I wonder if they were able to also search his home.... Based on this, I would certainly think they're are more offences to be found in his freezer. Guys like this need a lifetime ban, and at the absolute minimum their vechicle seized, with community service. If you don't comply with that, then right in the slammer with a 350lb monster named ""bubba""  I have no tolerance for criminals."
819384,bigmac1984,2013-11-21 15:29:00,193,"The 3 year license suspension can't be much of a deterrant either. If he wasn't afraid to keep 32 fish over his limit, he won't be afraid to continue to fish without a license,"
819386,Dara,2013-11-21 15:37:00,3052,"I don't get this ban stuff.  The guy wasn't fishing, he was poaching. That is already illegal.  The law says anything he was using to poach can be confiscated...take his van, and give a healthy fine.  One or 2 fish over a limit on a long trip is one thing (yes, its still breaking the law), but a cooler full of fish is out and out poaching and deserves special treatment like a real criminal."
819387,leaf4,2013-11-21 15:44:00,2466,"no way is that enough, put a tracking device on him that beeps within a radius of a body of water LOL, but 32 fish what is that $50 a fish hardly seems enough I wonder how many were out of the slot sizes, definitely a slap on the wrist should add a few zeros to that number"
819388,Roy,2013-11-21 15:46:00,13728,"Loss of license is a joke to these people. In addition to stiff fines, a clear photo of the individual on the net might be a good thing and it would not cost the tax payer a cent. Just sayin'."
819390,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-21 16:05:00,10439,"I think it is more than likely that the rainbows and specks were caught in the pine and were likely under 10"" in length. Not very likely they were steelhead. This certainly doesn't make it right but it's not nearly as bad as it would be if they were steelhead. I used to fish that piece of water all the time and the only time I was able to get anything of size was on opener."
819392,4x4bassin,2013-11-21 16:19:00,1025,"I live in this area and believe it or not there is a lot of enforcement by the MNR on the upper stretches of the Pine and Boyne ,you might not see them but they are there. See the trucks driving around all the time so like this guy , others will be caught eventually . 32 fish over is a disgrace and total disrespect of ""our"" resources , I agree with Roy and they should have gave him a much larger fine and put his face out there for everyone to see . Shame this idiot !"
819396,SirCranksalot,2013-11-21 18:16:00,3291,"What do you even do with 32 rainbows? I bet some were intended for the tomatoe garden.    all of them were in a cooler, so they must have been pretty small!"
819397,Big Cliff,2013-11-21 18:30:00,6899,"The 3 year license suspension can't be much of a deterrant either. If he wasn't afraid to keep 32 fish over his limit, he won't be afraid to continue to fish without a license, I have seen it right here on Sturgeon lake, busted one day for way over the limit, back fishing the next day and laughing about the whole thing!  Loss of license is a joke to these people. In addition to stiff fines, a clear photo of the individual on the net might be a good thing and it would not cost the tax payer a cent. Just sayin'. Loss of license? Roy most of these people that would go out there and take OOS fish and over limits don't respect the law in the first place. Loss of license to them doesn't mean a thing, most of them don't bother getting one in the first place.   all of them were in a cooler, so they must have been pretty small! I have a 150 quart cooler, I haven't tried it yet but I bet I could fit 30, 2-3 lb rainbow in it and still have room for a beer or two."
819402,SirCranksalot,2013-11-21 19:16:00,3291,150 qt cooler---possible? yes. Likely? no.
819403,mike rousseau,2013-11-21 19:21:00,4661,He had Brookies too... So I'm wondering if he was at a trout quary or something... They get stocked in the fall and catching high numbers for a few weeks is normal... Your looking at 8-12 inch fish most of the time....  I've seen guys limit multiple times and keep dropping fish off at their car 2-3-4 times a day
819412,MrSimon,2013-11-21 21:36:00,217,"Wow, this is a tough crowd!  You guys want jail sentences, $50k fines, vehicles confiscated, and public humiliation  ..... for what?  Keeping a cooler of illegal fish.  Come on, those kinds of punishments can ruin lives and destroy families.  The punishment should fit the crime.  For a first time offender who keeps a cooler full of fish .... a $1,600 fine and loss of license seems reasonable.  That's a lot of money and will sting enough that he'll certainly be more carefull in the future.  Heck, for some people, that's a year's worth of savings.  Its also more than enough money to replace the fish he took.  I do agree though that some community service time would be good additional punishment, and any repeat offenses should have heavier consequences.  I feel very strongly about resource management and the enforecement of conservation laws .... but you guys are just being ridiculous."
819415,Steve,2013-11-21 21:55:00,2075,careful?  do you feel his miscounted the number of rainbows he had?  a vehicle confiscated would not have been be too much to ask!
