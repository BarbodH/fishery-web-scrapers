819957,RangerGuy,2013-11-24 13:30:00,564,Yup Guest gets my vote...had 2 one on my last boat and 1 on my current. Solid state and water proof..can't beat them..  And from what I remember they tend to be smaller and thinner than both minnkota and cabelas brands
820064,aplumma,2013-11-24 21:23:00,6896,I went with the 3 bank one for each battery just because I have a 89  150 motor that can be cranky at times. It also will keep the battery at full charge so it will extend the life of the running battery.   Art
819576,Handlebarz,2013-11-22 16:44:00,3790,Hey all my three bank bps charger just crapped out is there any way to have these fixed?  I thought it was weird last weekend fishing my minnkota died after 7 hours I can usually get three long days on full charge.  I got home hooked up the charger but no lights came on so I unhooked everything and brought the batteries inside for the bench charger they are both good any ideas what might have happened?  The charger is three seasons old
819579,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-22 17:08:00,10439,Fuse maybe?
819612,Garnet,2013-11-22 19:25:00,2056,All 3 banks are dead?
819613,tb4me,2013-11-22 19:26:00,3295,Did it get wet?
819619,aplumma,2013-11-22 19:43:00,6896,If it is not a fuse it is toast. The electronic are sealed in an epoxy block and is not repairable.    Sorry   Art
819648,Whopper,2013-11-22 21:36:00,2174,Art is bang on. One thing you may want to check is the power source you were pluged into and make sure it was getting power.
819660,Fisherman,2013-11-22 22:10:00,7201,Warranty is up.
819664,Handlebarz,2013-11-22 22:14:00,3790,Like art said no fuse to it and yes Phil that was my first thing I ran a different cord from a different plug but nothing then I tried direct still nothing.  Warranty is up  I guess I have 6 spare fuses now lol. I will wait for the winter sales on them for a new one for next year.  I guess three years is better then some I heard about going each season. But each season you can exchange for a new one  Oh well thanks guys for the input but you all had the same thing I thought its toast.
819669,Roy,2013-11-22 22:26:00,13728,"Sorry to hear about that, Mike. I put in a Guest, 2 bank, 6 seasons ago and it's running great. This thing is always wet....not from waves or anything like that. It stays wet because of where it's installed in a hatch next to my 24 volt bowmount TM batteries. If you must get a new unit, take a good look at all that is out there. In the meantime, this coming spring, I'll be getting some air circulation around mine.  Good luck."
819672,Steve,2013-11-22 22:34:00,2075,"does your guest handle the wave bouncin?  i want to install one next spring but it needs to be installed in the bow of my boat....i'm concerned about the banging up there....  my 24v batteries are on the bow, not stern. as such the charger needs to be up there."
819710,Roy,2013-11-22 23:50:00,13728,"Mine is in a bow hatch, Steve. There's lots of bouncing up there but it's fastened in there securely. It does not move."
819719,aplumma,2013-11-23 00:12:00,6896,"The units now and for the past 8 years (around) are encased in a resin that is very vibration/slamming proof and waterproof. The trade off for this is they have a harder time bleeding off heat while charging. I mounted mine on the bottomside of the back lid off to the side of the 3 batteries. When it is time to charge I open the lid, plug it in and leave the lid up for air.   Art"
819723,Garnet,2013-11-23 00:25:00,2056,I would inspect the cord. I've never had all 3 crap at once.
819748,Handlebarz,2013-11-23 02:45:00,3790,Art I do the same the lid is open and yes it does get hot.  The cord is perfect I have zero power to the unit.
819771,Garnet,2013-11-23 13:10:00,2056,You are truly unlucky. Trash it. My Min kota 3 bank is 12 years old and still kicking.
819784,bassjnkie,2013-11-23 15:26:00,1101,"I like the Guest chargers,, I have a 3 bank for 10years now.."
819785,BillM,2013-11-23 15:52:00,17367,"+1 for Guest here as well...   Picked one up for the Lund on the recommendation of a few guys here, haven't been disappointed in it yet."
819811,lew,2013-11-23 17:11:00,12766,"I'll also recommend Guest, they make an excellent charger."
819822,Jer,2013-11-23 17:44:00,1426,"My first charger was a BPS brand, X-Pro or something like that. Crapped out in less than two years. I replaced it with a Minn-Kota brand several years ago and haven't had a problem since. Mine is mounted in the bow as well."
819823,Steve,2013-11-23 17:47:00,2075,"excellent.  sounds like i wont have an issue mounting on the bow.  folks that have 3 bank, are you using one bank for cranking battery?  my cranking battery never seems to have an issue.  as such i'm thinking a two bank for my 24v TM would be fine?"
819827,Roy,2013-11-23 18:20:00,13728,"Y'know, for those of you who haven't installed one yet, it might be an idea to use rubber grommets under the fastening points....maybe even an upside down mousepad. I didn't do that, I fastened directly to the bulkhead and it's been fine going to its 7th season.  Edited to add: Oh and Steve, I only have the 2 bank for a 24 volt 70lb TM. The main motor is always at the top of its game That's my experience...someone else might have other thoughts on this."
819931,BillM,2013-11-24 04:28:00,17367,"Roy, I don't have my starter battery on the charger either.  No need, the boat doesn't sit very long once the soft water season gets here.  I take it out in the winter and put it in the house."
819932,Steve,2013-11-24 04:29:00,2075,thanks for the confirmations. 2 bank it is!!
819948,RJackson,2013-11-24 11:04:00,113,"Steve,  I run a 3 bank MinnKota.  My main is in that mix.  It certainly can't hurt to have the main getting juice when having some downtime.  For the small extra cost I'd consider it.  Mine is under deck and fairly close to the batteries.  The MK comes with long cables so you'd likely be ok with having anywhere in your Lund.  Very handy to have!  RJ"
819950,Garnet,2013-11-24 11:41:00,2056,The 4 bank charger wasn't available when I bought my 3 bank Min Kota.  The high end electronics have a small constant draw but I don't think that's the problem.  Fishing longer in one spot and short runs seems to accumulate after a couple days and your electronics start shutting down. It's not long after that your cranking battery won't start your main.  Most guys with big motors and high end electronics charge their cranking battery.
