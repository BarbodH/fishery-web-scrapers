Can someone help direct me how to make it so that the photo is actually showing and not the link to the photo on an external site? I have the photos posted on Photobucket and what I have been doing is taking thier link for posting in forums and inserting it like so:  [image ] LINK [ /image] without the spaces.

When I was doing that before (copying the IMG link) it was posting a live link to the photo once I previewed my post.

At the bottom of a post there is an area that sez ""Attach Files""  Choose the file you want from your computer then follow directions...  This posts a thumbnail into your post but people can see the larger version by clicking on it...  Hope this helps..."
