819930,Acountdeleted,2013-11-24 04:28:00,2562,"Not as memorable as my last pic but I figure I'll post a few more.  Some of these were during and some of these were after a shift working the best job I ever had for a unnamed government organization that doesn't get the funding it once did. All of these were taking in Northwestern Ontario. I could post hundreds but these are the most memorable.     Some of the greatest hospitality I have ever experienced. Guys I met the night before took me to their secret fishing spot. The is the one lake where when someone said 'You will never experience fishing like this anywhere else' I agree with them. Limit of Walleye and about a dozen 12+ inch perch in under 45 minutes. Later that day they had a fish fry and invited the neighbourhood. After experiencing this and spending the summer there I can honestly say Dryden folks are the nicest folks I ever have had the pleasure to meet.    We used to try to get one gag photo on every lake we assessed. This is my favourite.    I remember this night like it was yesterday. Bluffy Lake just outside of ear falls. This was probably hour 15 or 16 of a 17 hour day. So many fish to process. Keith and his wife were the best hosts anyone could ask for and were always good to us. I really hope to go back as a guest and not a worker some day.    In my line of work 'I may never be here again' has a bit of a deeper meaning. Kern lake..... I don't even remember where because we had to fly in to process it. A fantastic lake with tons of fish and a beautiful area. Sunsets to die for. I remember talking to the girl I was dating over a satellite phone on the last night saying how sad I was knowing I would never be there again, she tried to tell me how it may be possible but realistically I knew that it probably wasn't.  If I ever strike it rich, I'd go back and do that job for free in a heartbeat. The experience is something that will last a lifetime."
819960,MCTFisher9120,2013-11-24 14:06:00,3761,"Here is still my favourite photo from all the trips and bass I've caught over the last 4 years. You never forget your biggest and for me my personal best Largemouth is all I chase. Back in 2009 I was doing a early morning solo fish off the docks at my old trailer park. Was working the Rapala Skitter Pop one of my standby techniques now (poppers in the am) on 12lb mono and a shady spinning rod. I had a passion for the forums and sharing reports so of course a camera was on a tri-pod behind me filming a good minute of the fight and the moment where I reached under the dock and held him on camera.  It was warm, smooth water and not a soul around to share the fun with me. I remember looking back at camp a million times hoping someone would see me. After another video of the release and 2 or 3 more photos this largemouth was all of 6lbs 13oz. I'll catch a bigger bass from my waters in Eastern Ontario it's only a matter of time      Hoping to get the replica mount done up this winter  MTBF"

Sounds like it was quite the day you two had.  I played with the original a bit. It seemed to have a strong blue overcast to it. Bumped up the greens and saturation a bit, and sharpened it a little. I hope that you like the results.  "
819763,Acountdeleted,2013-11-23 04:09:00,2562,My favourite photo of all time. Reminds me of home and how magical my last days in Ontario were. The baffled look on my girlfriends face completes it.

819766,Handlebarz,2013-11-23 12:14:00,3790,"Awesome pictures all. I can see that most are of family memories which will hold the closest to our hearts.  I have lots of pictures that are my favorites with my wife,daughter,and son but if I have to pick just one it will be of dad and I on our last fishing trip before he passed away he was to sick in 2010 to get out fishing and all the trips we planned in 2011 were also a bust as he would show up to the house at 5am and be sick so we could not get out until one day late August 2011 he came over as he did many time to go fishing I was expecting for us to head to McDonalds for coffee instead of fishing but that day he said lets go. (each trip we planned I always had the boat picked and ready this time we did not unload it) so off we went looking for bass pickerel and then musky. What a day it was we could not get a fish to take the line we had many bass follow to the boat and pickerel either seal the worms or follow to the boat ( they don't normally do that here on LSC from 18') and for musky well that was harder as we could not get a fish to show up until the last second when I used my Hail Marry and it worked. Dad was happy that it was a small fish as he said he could actually reel it in. I was just glad that we had one last trip out just the two of us. Its been two years as of last Wednesday since he lost his battle to cancer. But his memory is alive in my family and we share his story's all the time.   "

819813,Steve,2013-11-23 17:14:00,2075,"This is my favourite photo.  This was our ""families"" first 5lbs largie.  We had searched for well over a decade for a true 5lbs largie. Many smallies over five and a couple over six had been caught, but never a largie.  This particular lake we fished a couple years when I was a kid - great memories!  Well, a few years ago Louis Milo and I were fishing Quinte and I was telling him about our quest for a true five pound largie. He names a lake and I couldn't believe it. That was the lake I fished with my old man when I was a kid, in our canoe.  We went back, now in the boat, and on our first day Dad latches into this beast. We put it on the scale looking at the weight. Both of us just sat there in a moment of silence - I wish that moment would have lasted forever.  The photo was great. Dad with smoke in mouth is just how I remember it. Both of us now have caught largies up to six, but this one will always be the most special. Thanks again Louis!   Just look at the mouth on that fish, and the look on dad's face!"

819888,Musky or Specks,2013-11-23 23:38:00,2710,So I have two photos that I love  The first is my son's first smallmouth he caught without any help from me. I was fishing musky out of the back of the canoe. I had set him up with the rig we always used to catch stunted largies since he could walk. The dirt on his face and the smile always bring back some fond memories.    The other pic is just great cuz for me it captures his adventurous side. He would do anything as a child that his dad would do.
