Mom held my hand(maybe a bit too tightly) all the way home and talked about what had happened. Mom and dad talked about the day at supper, our normal happy evening meal was quite somber.  That evening mom and I walked to the theater to watch PT109."

819876,Rattletrap2,2013-11-23 22:49:00,1652,"i saw that show, it was pretty interesting, the original shooter apparently hit jfk in the neck and when the secret service was about to shoot the guy he stumbled and shot jfk So far, that seems like the most reasonable explanation. They claimed that the bullets fired from Oswalds rifle were a totally different type than the hollow point one that killed JFK. The three empty cartidges found in the school book depository were explained as one empty that was left in the chamber was ejected and to load the two others that were fired. One of those went right clean through the back of his neck. The other one, they believed hit the concrete beside the car and ricocheted. The fatal shot exploded on impact and was likely fired from the Secret Service Officers Automatic rifle.  Oh, and I watched the Appollo landing on the moon in July of 1969 and do not believe it ever happened."
