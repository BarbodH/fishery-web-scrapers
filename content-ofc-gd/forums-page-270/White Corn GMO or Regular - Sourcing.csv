I mentioned the Roundup or Glyphosate showing up in ground water on my Grandparents old farm, you say nothing other then ""Your reply is full of emotion but lacks any truth other that spouting off anti GMO reteoric and lies. Not to sound arrogant, but I am vastly more qualified in both experience and education to comment on this issue then anyone else that has posted here. Have a good day."" witch to me  translates to laymen terms ,I know it all your you know nothing. So please explain to me this ever rapidly growing list of contries that are opposed to GMO?  I wont  go on all day with you on this but its something im extremely passionate about.. So i could. The information is out there folks learn for yourselves and think outside the box.  Here's a list of countries (and U.S. counties) that have banned genetically modified crops in one way or another. In the United States: Only the California counties of Mendocino, Trinity and Marin have successfully banned GM crops. Voters in other Calilfornia counties have tried to pass similar measures but failed. In Australia:  Several Australian states had bans on GM crops but most of them have since lifted them. Only South Australia still has a ban on GM crops, though Tasmania has a moratorium on them until November of 2014. In Japan:  The Japanese people are staunchly opposed to genetically modified crops and no GM seeds are planted in the country. However, large quantities of canola are imported from Canada (which is one of the world's largest producers of GM canola) and there is now GM canola growing wild around Japanese ports and roads to major food oil companies. Genetically modified canola such as Monsanto's Roundup Ready canola have been found growing around 5 of the 6 ports that were tested for GM contamination. In New Zealand: No GM foods are grown in the country. In Germany: There is a ban on the cultivation or sale of GMO maize. In Ireland: All GM crops were banned for cultivation in 2009, and there is a voluntary labeling system for foods containing GM foods to be identified as such. In Austria, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria and Luxembourg: There are bans on the cultivation and sale of GMOs. In France:  Monsanto's MON810 GM corn had been approved but its cultivation was forbidden in 2008. There is widespread public mistrust of GMOsthat has been successful in keeping GM crops out of the country. In Madeira: This small autonomous Portugese island requested a country-wide ban on genetically modified crops last year and was permitted to do so by the EU. In Switzerland:  The country banned all GM crops, animals, and plants on its fields and farms in a public referendum in 2005, but the initial ban was for only five years. The ban has since been extended through 2013. In India:  The government placed a last-minute ban on GM eggplant just before it was scheduled to begin being planted in 2010. However, farmers were widely encouraged to plant Monsanto's GM cotton and it has led to devastating results. The UK's Daily Mail reports that an estimated 125,000 farmers have committed suicide because of crop failure and massive debt since planting GM seeds. In Thailand:  The country has zigzagged in its support and opposition of GM crops. The country had widespread trials of GM papayas from Hawaii but reversed its plans when the seeds got wild and began contaminating nearby crops. Several countries such as Japan moved to restrict the importation of Thailand's papayas as a result, not wanting to import any GM foods. Thailand is currently trying to embrace both sides -- producing organic foods for some countries at a high price while moving towards embracing more and more GM crops. The country has also tried declaring some areas GMO-free zones in order to encourage other countries to trust their foods."
819644,Old Man,2013-11-22 21:09:00,822,"So your comeback is to post an out of date list of countries that have or have had in past GMO bans. Bans brought about by fear mongering organizations and a lack of understanding of the science by politicians. When you say ""growing list"", this list has actually shrunk over the years as common sense prevails and the facts are known and proved.  And when I say out of date, I mean by several years. For example ""Only South Australia still has a ban on GM crops,"". Not true, the ban on GMO's was lifted there well before my retirement. We've conducted our winter nursery in South Australia for many years.  Good cut and paste off the internet, but you should check how current the information you're cutting and pasting is.  Then we come ot this; ""witch to me  translates to laymen terms ,I know it all your you know nothing"" No, it translates into, I know a lot more about the science then you do. Just as your family doctor knows a lot more about medical science then you do. That's why you consult them for health issues.  And as far as your claim that glycophate has contaminated the ground water on your grandparents farm. Really, because glycophate won't persit in the environment long enough to ever filter down into the ground water. Now if you claimed their ground water was contaminated by atrazine, I'd probably agree that there was a chance it was. Good thing farmers don't use atrazine any more."
819655,Rich,2013-11-22 22:01:00,3927,"No such thing as GMO beef?   Go back to school, you're out of the times.  Unless you think this ""corn fed beef"" program push is for some human health benefit?"
819659,Old Man,2013-11-22 22:09:00,822," Buddy, go learn what the term GMO means. It has nothing to do with what the animal is fed. Cattle have been fed corn during the finishing process for years. Long before GMO's. Most beef in Canada are finished with barley. Your ignorance about agriculture is readily apparent from your reply."

I was raised on a mixed farm in Minnedosa Manitoba. We had beef, dairy, hogs, grain and forage crops. I spent 7 years studying agriculture at the University of Manitoba including several courses in animal science. Don't try to tell me I know nothing about raising beef. I've done it.

819673,leaf4,2013-11-22 22:36:00,2466,"not to be rude but a career devoted to the study of agricultural science sounds a lot more prominent than being a butcher for 10 years, both of my uncles are butchers for 25+ years each and they both said I just cut the meat I could care less where it comes from, they are both hunters and fisherman and lead a similar life to many of the people on this board, but they are not impartial to organic or gmo when I asked the one if gmo beef was a thing or not he laughed and said no.  all in all it's these people we depend on as a population not just you and your family but the millions of others out there, if they have the capability of increasing yield,resistances etc all the better to me and 36million other people, it's the closed minded attitude to scientific fact that the groups feed off of to send across a negative connotation to the GMO industry, and I'm not partial to any side, I'm a sheet metal worker before someone tells me the man is signing my pay LOL"
819674,tb4me,2013-11-22 22:41:00,3295,So they successfully sued Monsanto then? Ya good luck with that..Very few can afford to successfully sue Monsanto..

819679,tb4me,2013-11-22 22:44:00,3295,"This all starts in the White House, where Monsanto often got its way by exerting disproportionate influence over policymakers via the “revolving door”. One example is Michael Taylor, who worked for Monsanto as an attorney before being appointed as deputy commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991. While at the FDA, the authority that deals with all US food approvals, Taylor made crucial decisions that led to the approval of GE foods and crops. Then he returned to Monsanto, becoming the company’s vice president for public policy. These are the people that feed you your information.

First of all, development and licenceing of GMO products is strictly regulated and tested by PMRA, Health Canada and CFIA.  There is no GMO products that contains animal DNA. Pure Bull made up by the activists to scare people and promote their ""franken food"" image. Most GMO's plants grown, have traits that have been transfered from weedy relatives that have lead to a reduction in pesticide use by producers.  GMO traits such as Round up Ready and Liberty Link has reduced herbicide use and contributed to better managagement and soil conservation through reduction in tillage require.  Bt corn alone has eliminated the need for application of 1,000,000's acres annually of insecticide to control the european corn borer. These are just a few on the input benifits the industry has seen as a result of GMO technology.  Output traits such Golden Rice have improved peoples health and life through better nutrtion in the third world. Eye sight issues due to poor nutrition is common in some countries. The introduction of beta carotene precursors into their rice has helped reduce these health issues.  GMO's traits have also helped improve yields in most crops. The hybridization of canola has lead to an almost doubling of yields produced by farmers. With old open polinated canola varieties 35 bushel and acre has aveage, new hybrid varieties are averaging in the 50 - 60 bus/ac range.

People die every year from organic foods tainted with listeria or e. coli, no one has die from eating GMO's.

How does this lead to lower use of herbicides?  Round Up Ready lowers the amount and variety of herbicies applies to crops. Prior to RR crops, on crops such as corn, a large amount of atrazine, banvel, bladex and other such compounds were applied to control the wide spectrum of weeds. Now with RR corn, rates as low as half a litre an acre and lower are used to control all the weeds. So yes, it's less in amount and also less in the variety of active ingredients used. Also in such crops as corn and soyabean, inter row cultivation was necessary to control hard to kill weeds, this amount of inter row cultivation has decreased with RR and this decrease is good for long term soil conservation."

As soon as the corn was done got to hill the potatoes with the same machine    There was atrazine at that time but we didn't use it, once you put it on  you could only grow corn on that land for at least 3 years, pretty persistent stuff ecologically."
819598,Old Man,2013-11-22 18:56:00,822,"You're right Dave. The other down side to some of the old technology. Atrazine, Bladex, etc. all had recropping restrictions if used. No restrictions with Round as the active ingredient biodegrades quickly.   Ahhh yes...the days spent row cropping. If you were doing a field planted by someone else and they were wiggly when planting, you'd curse them all day."

First of all, development and licenceing of GMO products is strictly regulated and tested by PMRA, Health Canada and CFIA.  There is no GMO products that contains animal DNA. Pure Bull made up by the activists to scare people and promote their ""franken food"" image. Most GMO's plants grown, have traits that have been transfered from weedy relatives that have lead to a reduction in pesticide use by producers.  GMO traits such as Round up Ready and Liberty Link has reduced herbicide use and contributed to better managagement and soil conservation through reduction in tillage require.  Bt corn alone has eliminated the need for application of 1,000,000's acres annually of insecticide to control the european corn borer. These are just a few on the input benifits the industry has seen as a result of GMO technology.  Output traits such Golden Rice have improved peoples health and life through better nutrtion in the third world. Eye sight issues due to poor nutrition is common in some countries. The introduction of beta carotene precursors into their rice has helped reduce these health issues.  GMO's traits have also helped improve yields in most crops. The hybridization of canola has lead to an almost doubling of yields produced by farmers. With old open polinated canola varieties 35 bushel and acre has aveage, new hybrid varieties are averaging in the 50 - 60 bus/ac range.  If anyone thinks thats organic is the way too go, here are a few facts about the organic movement. People die every year from organic foods tainted with listeria or e. coli, no one has die from eating GMO's.  Organic production practices produces  vastly lower yields, so if this was adopted as a wide spread production system, the price of food would sky rocket and the amount of starvation world wide would be massive.  So if anyone thinks the organic is ""socially responsible"" give your head a shake. Wow this type of thinking is whats wrong with the Agri industry. No offense Old Man but your wrong on so many counts..I can clearly see who has been signing your pay. I can post up hundreds of links of what is wrong with GMO. There is a reason the majority of  Europe has either limited or out-wright banned them.. If GMO's are so good for us then , please by all means tell me why ""they"" (monsanto, dupont ect ect) fight so hard to keep GMO's off the labels on our foods. Untill there is actual proof that GMO is indeed not harmfull im not willing to risk my children's future health on what Monsanto says.. Label the foods let us decide for ourselves..Yes I grow organic no my family has not been sick. As a youngster I helped my grandparents farm what we called cattle corn. There was no sprays what so ever and you know what? The grain bins were always full come October. Now these same farm fields are being sprayed 2 to 3 times a year by the new land owner. Roundup is not biodegradable and its now showing up in the ground water in the same area. So please pay close attention as to whats really going on here..If your really an ""Old Man"" Your grandkids future depends on it."
819604,Old Man,2013-11-22 19:15:00,822,"Number one , no one signs my pay check, I'm retired and have nothing to gain by sharing the truth with anyone that want's to know the real truth. Not like these activist groups who raise millions for their own benefit by spreading disinformation and fear. Your reply is full of emotion but lacks any truth other that spouting off anti GMO reteoric and lies. Not to sound arrogant, but I am vastly more qualified in both experience and education to comment on this issue then anyone else that has posted here. Have a good day."
