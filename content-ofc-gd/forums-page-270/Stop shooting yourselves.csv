819417,MrSimon,2013-11-21 22:05:00,217,"Bill - don't be so quick to judge the motives of others.  Leaving a deer on the back of a side by side on a trailer might not have anything to do with vanity or a lack of class.  It might simply be out of necessity or ease.  The guy most likely drove the side by side back into the woods and strapped the deer on for the ride out.  Deer are heavy, awkwared to move, and bloody.  Unstrapping it and lifting it into the truck (which might have other gear in it) could be a waste of time and energy .... especially if you need to move the deer around with the side by side when you get home.  Maybe the guy who owns the truck didn't get the deer ... it could belong to the owner of the side by side who is getting dropped off first.  Lots and lots of reasons.  Maybe they are being stupid and just want to show off or shock people .... but maybe they aren't.  Don't be so quick to judge."

818886,Fishnwire,2013-11-17 16:12:00,983,"I don't think its a big deal to see harvested game on display.  It wouldn't bother me personally, in the least.  I also don't mind seeing naked women.  If you painted a mural on your van of several nude women performing various lewd acts...not unlike a dead deer, it wouldn't bother me in the least.  The thing is, I recognize that just because I don't get offended over something, that doesn't mean its not offensive by someone else's very reasonable definition.  It's pretty obvious by a few of these comments that at least some hunters display their quarry not despite the fact that it offends others, but because it does.  Let's be totally honest here...there are some that get a little kick out of the shock value.  We don't like the P3TA types...so knowing that we're offending those people is a little bonus.  It reminds me of the time a very conservative guy I know asked me in a disgusted tone, ""Why would you walk around with that long hair?""...and I replied, ""To get that type of reaction out of people like you.""  Hunters sometimes bemoan what they perceive as attacks against them and their sport by non-hunters.  That being the case, maybe it's best not to shove it in the faces of those types.  It just gives them a reason to complain.  If you really don't want to cover up your catch, don't be surprised to hear people gripe about it...you're kind of asking for it."

Some could suggest the opposite. Alluding to some deep seeded traumatic experience one side could lead to the other suggesting some might be trying to make up for other shortcomings.

There's some deep, unexposed horrible thing that happened during my childhood which makes me shake my head at guys who drape a dead deer across the back of their side by side, for nothing more then to show everyone out there how much of a big bad hunter they are.  It's disrespectful to the animal and it makes you look like an attention *****.    I hunt for christ sakes, do don't try and peg me for some animal loving P3TA type  BTW, to the guy who mentioned Michigan, I just got back from 3 days on the Manistee, which also was the opener for deer out there..   I didn't see any of this behavior at all.  Lots and lots of deer in the back of trucks and trailers, but none out on display like the one I saw on the 400SB a few weeks ago..    If you're a deer hunter, Michigan is the place..  We saw hundreds of them!!"
818970,alexmedic,2013-11-18 02:03:00,186,"As a hunter, I fall into the category of no displaying my harvest on the way home.  I look at it in this way:  These days the general perception of guns and hunting are frowned upon.  To have a hunter (legally) display his/her harvest on the drive home only deepens peoples misunderstanding, and possibly increase the anger or fear of the sport.  This could ultimately make things harder for all of us in the long run.  Like many things I will teach my children about, I personally want them to learn about hunting the way I choose to tell them, not by a dead moose staring at them with it's tongue sticking out at any given intersection.  I want to give the same respect to others the same way.  Just my humble opinion"
818971,farsider,2013-11-18 02:13:00,456,"Personally, the viewing of a successful hunt in the bed of a pickup or trailer is part of living near an area blessed with such bounty and enjoyable pastimes.  To me, the act of taking an animals life to feed myself and my family, confers on me a huge responsibility to treat it with the utmost respect and reverence.  This primarily means that I make every effort to make sure none of the meat is wasted.  Even, not taking an animal if; the weather, the situation or my preparedness are not appropriate.  I also think it is worth noting that every time we engage in our pastimes, that we are all(sometimes reluctant)ambassadeurs for that pastime and we should make every effort to be at our best and remember that we are a minority and our enjoyment of our pastime does not occur in a vacuum.  This also means recognizing that there is a difference between downtown Wawa and downtown Barrie.  If one wanted to cover an animal upon your return and still allow for cooling there is always cheese cloth or shade cloth.  To me, festooning the grill of your vehicle with the head of the animal you just harvested or public square meat hangings speak poorly to the ego of the hunter and the level of respect the animal deserves.  I think most remember how easily the Spring-Bear hunt was cancelled because one well-financed individual was able to use one video showing disrespect of the Bear to further their agenda and bring about craven political change.  It is safe to say that there is plenty more videographers today.  Cheers, Mark"

Sure. Did they get arrested? Nope. Were they looked down upon by everyone (including other smokers)? Yes.  I see this in the same respect.  It is our right to hunt.  It is not ""right"" to parade it down 400 series highways. Maybe ""our right"", but not ""right"". And I have a feeling it won't be ""our right"" for long...."

Their preferred method was to push a field towards the station wagon, if no Deer seen, the next move was to load everyone into the wagon, all 8 of us, then mosey down to the next gin mill and have a shot of Kessler's and a Jenny, or two, then load up and find another field, push, repeat beer and shot. I wonder if this is the way it got them through Europe during the war.  A few years ago in Haldimand County here 2 knuckleheads were hunting a pond for Duck. These two yokels both in their 70's began to argue, one friend took offence and shot the other. No fatality fortunately. Both blew well over the legal limit for driving. They weren't driving the shooter told OPP, just huntin'.  Ask me why I never took up hunting? I don't like Kessler's Whisky."
817730,lew,2013-11-10 13:10:00,12766,"When we were kids we were visiting my uncles house and my brother and I were in the basement. My uncle came down and noticed us looking at his shotgun hanging on the wall. He took it down to show it to us and the damn thing fired. The 12 guage blast hit the concrete floor right in front of my brothers feet and blew the concrete shards up at him. He wasn't seriously hurt but had small cuts all over his legs.  Of course, the 1st thing my uncle said was ""I din't know it was loaded""  I still think of that day and shudder at the thought of how close my bro came to being seriously injured or killed.  It was a very long time before my family spoke to my uncle again."

And I know that was not necessarily the tone hear either, I'm just putting it out there."
817906,ch312,2013-11-11 15:58:00,1590,"  most guys will turn the safety off when in the stand, because the click of the safety can spook the deer, also the excitement in the time you have a deer in your sights and you forget the safety is on, well thats a missed opprotunity, kinda like not having your rod in your hand when you get a hit, next time you're float fishing, put a cast out, then put your rod down, or leave slack in the line so you have to reel it up before setting the hook   Sorry, but you can't be serious? You're either an anti trying to portray a bad image, someone who hangs around very irresponsible hunters, or an extremely ignorant hunter who hasn't shot himself or others...YET. Only someone who has never hunted would assume that the nearly silent ""click"" of turning the safety off would spook a deer.  Not most guys I hunt with,infact none of the guys I hunt with.  I've been hunting for 15-20 years and have never heard of leaving the safety off because it will spook a deer when you switch from ""safe"" to ""fire"".    I can't believe I just read that   Like I said I've been qualified as a Hunter Safety Instructor since 1977, after reading that I wish there was some way I could issue you a FAIL and pull your licence. That is just wrong in anyone's book, you are not serious I hope that was some kinda troll.  Yep       As Sinker mentioned, the controlled hunt brings out the yahoo's who have no clue how to properly use a firearm as they only hunt a maximum of 5 days each year during the controlled deer firearm hunt. Many of these folks don't even bother practicing with their firearms before the season starts, hence the ""world war 3"" amount of gunshots that can be heard during the first week of November in many area's as a huge majority of these guys spray and pray rather than making the first shot count. They have no idea how to handle a firearm, how to shoot it, or their effective range.  The controlled hunt will always be the most dangerous time of year for both hunters and non hunters due to the high number of very inexperienced ""hunters"" in the bush."

In northern Quebec they strap the head of the moose to the hood of their truck and drive it around for a week...its just a part of their culture. Now in more populated areas i can see how it would only be a 'shock' thing and is not really part of the culture.

Some people are either total asses, or just plain stupid.  I've also seen guys jump shooting, and not realize what was on the other side of the trees.  Until their shot hammers up against a cottage and someone comes running out screaming their head off.  It's an embarrassment  for all hunters.  Bunch of duck dynasty wannabes."
817529,Rod Caster,2013-11-09 01:35:00,5784,"Ok, southern Ontario, what's going on?  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/6-hunters-mistakenly-shot-as-deer-hunting-season-begins-1.2417094  Ontario Provincial Police are reminding hunters about the importance of firearm safety after six accidental shootings involving hunters less than a week into deer hunting season.  Central Hastings OPP said the first incident happened around 8:40 a.m. Monday, when a 42-year-old man was accidentally shot in the arm while hunting with a group in Tudor and Cashel Township, near Bancroft.  They said he was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries.  The second happened on Maple Road in Odessa, where a 55-year-old man was accidentally shot, according to police. The third happened on Weedmark Road in Montague, northeast of Smiths Falls, when police said they were called to a 59-year-old man's accidental shooting around 6:45 p.m. In all of the cases, no charges are going to be laid. There was another accidental shooting Tuesday near Peterborough. OPP said a 17-year-old boy was accidentally shot in the shoulder by someone else in their hunting party. He was taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. Again, no charges will be laid. Then, on Thursday, OPP sent out releases about two accidental shootings involving hunters that day. The first happened just before noon at a property on County Road 34 in North Glengarry Township. A 75-year-old man from the township was hunting when his firearm accidentally discharged, injuring him. He was taken to hospital in serious but non-life-threatening condition. The second happened after 2:30 p.m. the same day at 1935 County Rd. 43 in North Grenville. A 23-year-old man was found in the bush with a shoulder wound, and was airlifted to The Ottawa Hospital's Civic campus with a non-life-threatening injury. In both cases, foul play isn't suspected and the investigations are ongoing.  OPP said to visit Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources or Hunter Education Program websites for more safety information. These incidents come just over a year after an Ottawa hunter was accidentally shot and killed south of Ottawa."

One was shot in the shoulder by another member of the hunting party; another was found in the bush with a shoulder wound; the latter may have shot themselves, but that is not specified.  I too am having a hard time believing that none of these people need to charged.  Don't deer hunters have to where orange?"

I've been a Hunting Instructor since 1977, you know the course you need to pass to get a hunting licence, although I have not taught in a few years. 6 in such a short space of time is quite a blip on a good safety record but if it is a cases of not identifying your target there is no such thing as a honest mistake. Charges should be laid"
817583,lew,2013-11-09 13:18:00,12766,"50 odd years ago I knew an old man, basically a hermit, who lived in a log cabin in the bush near the s/e corner of Algonquin Park on the Bonnechere River.  70 years before I met him when he was just a small boy, he looked out the window of the same old cabin at sunrise and saw what he thought was a bear at the waters edge. His dad wasn't around so he got the gun and shot the bear. He ran down to the water to find that it was actually his dad he'd killed.

817591,Rich,2013-11-09 14:02:00,3927,"I don't doubt many of these men would accept the charges. They probably feel guilty enough as it is, added charges would probably seem suffice to them.  I think the compassion of the lawmakers not laying charges here, recognizing human error, is not a bad thing. It's kind of good fuel against any anti-hunting groups to not have a ridiculous amount of hunters getting firearms charges and licenses revoked.  I'm pretty sure if someone made the stupid mistake of shooting themself, they'd be pretty cautious of their safety IF and when they ever go back out.  Just my opinion."
817593,Rod Caster,2013-11-09 14:22:00,5784,If they 'accidentally ' shoot themselves then they could just as easily 'accidentally ' shoot someone else. Circumstances certainly matter but still a lot of cases make you shake your head;pro or anti whatever
