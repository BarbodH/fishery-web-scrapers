819284,lew,2013-11-20 18:19:00,12766,"It was 50% more wasn't it  Yeah your right Terry, 50% increase, not 30.  My bad."
819285,limeyangler,2013-11-20 18:23:00,5204,Stop along the way and pick up Uncle Guido and his violin case and make him a offer he can't refuse LOL.
819286,limeyangler,2013-11-20 18:35:00,5204,"thanks, you guys are awesome. . Gonna go with all the money, talk nice, and try to split the difference. He has usually been a decent kind of guy, but I just don't trust mechanics....too many bad experiences, but I will try to put that feeling aside and talk openly......If all else fails....the violin case gets opened!"
819287,jimmer,2013-11-20 18:40:00,2730,"It's always a tough call, but some great advice here. Not worth going to court over $200. Talk to him and if he holds fast with his latest figure, tell him you're disappointed and move on. Most of us have stories like this.  I brought an ATV into someone that said ""if I can't fix it no one can"". I knew it was something small, but he calls me and says he hasn't figured it out yet. I ask how much I have into it and he says $200. I told him not to do anymore on it because I didn't want a surprise bill of $1000 for an old machine. I go pick up the machine and he hands me a box of parts (crankshaft and all that) and said he would have to charge me more to put it back together. I take it home, put it on kijiji and it sells within the day for $300, my original purchase price. I talk to the guy the next day and he says he has it running, just some small electrical problem. I have never been back to him and I always tell the story to people that are planning on using that repair shop. His loss for not being up front. I was not expecting him to take the engine apart and he did not tell me that's what he was doing."
819290,Beans,2013-11-20 18:56:00,3339,Stop along the way and pick up Uncle Guido and his violin case and make him a offer he can't refuse  Tell Guido to bring Vinnie (The Chin) with him...
819291,Big Cliff,2013-11-20 18:59:00,6899,There is always more than one side to any story and believe me I could tell you plenty from a mechanics side of the fence too. There is no excuse though for quoting someone to do a job and not advising them if there is a significant increase in what you quoted. How this guy handles it when you go to see him will speak volumes for the type of mechanic he is.
819293,RangerGuy,2013-11-20 19:16:00,564,"I would question why he didn't notify me of the increase, I've been burned by this trick before.  Now I get a quote and specifically make them write on the bill ""Will call if changes"" or something like that.  With that said it depends on how long you've been using his services and your relationship with him..if it's buddy buddy then maybe he just assumed it was ok..if not then well sorry to him..  I would express my disappointment, try talk him down, pay the bill and go elsewhere the next time."
819296,Handlebarz,2013-11-20 19:35:00,3790,Dan I guess your dad never seen these stupid fruit flies we get here in SW Ontario around September the best way to catch them is with a glass of vinegar with plastic cling wrap on the top and poke a couple holes with a fork these things come flying out of every crack in the house when you shake the glass and get the vinegar stirred up.  But for Simons problem here I would use sugar or honey
819300,cheaptackle,2013-11-20 20:41:00,849,Why not send the mechanic a link to this post before you pick up the machine?  If he reads it through I'm sure he'll get the idea....  Michael

Tom should make this situation right, or you 2 grown men both need to come to an agreement and move on with your day. If the outcome is less than satisfactory on your end, I doubt you will seek Tom's services again. Surely Tom is bright enough to get your business more than just once. I could be wrong...lol"
819335,limeyangler,2013-11-21 01:51:00,5204,"So….went over….Tom seemed a bit ""off' for want of a better word. we loaded the machine in near silence, he said ""ok well, there ya go"". I explained we needed to talk before we went any further. I asked what problems he ran into that had caused him to go $200 over the original quote. He started off pointing out that he had changed the sheer pins too ""for proper ones""….."" i was quick too point out that sheer pin change is a 30 second job…cost max $6. He did not say much. I went on to explain that I could understand that he could have run into issues while the work was already underway, and that i appreciated he got the work done, but felt he should have given me a heads up as we were approaching a cost point not far off a new blower!!! I suggested we meet half way and offered $500….he accepted and I felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.  On the way home i was thinking if he had done what was on the bill he had done good by me, i was just finding it hard to shake the feeling that something was wrong.  Got home, had to pull start it to get into the garage….F$%$#$%^%….pull cord snaps first pull…..right at the very end. Call Tom as i can't believe this is coincidence….he says he has not touched it. Get the machine into the garage and hook it up , push the button…it fires up (he tested it in front of me at the shop too…fired up then) i start to go and try it…my wife comes out to say i have a phone call…go to switch it off….DOES NOT STOP NOW WHEN YOU REMOVE THE KEY!!!!! I know this was fine before it went in because i had to start and stop it to get it on the trailer……GRRRRRRRRRRRR.  Ok…really……REALLY!!!!!REALLLLLLY!!!!!!   pass the valium!!!!!"
819338,aplumma,2013-11-21 02:08:00,6896,The key should be a ground of the ignition system check for a little green wire that should go to the frame. A broken cord is kind of normal in my book. He after all though he was going to get the full amount so he had no time or reason to sabotage the unit. I am not defending the man I just think from the frame of mind you wrote it you might be seeing something that is not there. If I am wrong I am sorry you had to find someone who did not treat you as well as I think you should have been. Take the valium and look for the wire or call him when you are calmer in the morning.

819339,limeyangler,2013-11-21 02:21:00,5204,Thanks Art….no need to apologize. Its been one of those days….had to trailer my snow machine to Kenora today…..whole other bunch of attitude from the owner…whole other story lol….then a 2 hour drive back again to talk with Tom….my whole day has been filled with strife with small engine mechanics   Oh well….in the grand scheme of things this is SOD ALL….NADA….NUFFINK……but its been a day to forget…. i have a strangely sore behind and a hole in my bank account to show for it!

Also, I believe an estimate can go over by 20% without approvals.I never have had a money issue with a customer in 20 years of business. Doing it right avoids messes like this one."

819371,lew,2013-11-21 12:42:00,12766," Sometimes you are just plain dammed if you do and dammed if you don't.  Cliff, everyone who's ever dealt with you, including me, knows you do excellent work for a very fair and honest price and if you say that's what the job is worth, we all know you can be trusted.  The issue here though is a mechanic giving a price that the client agreed on, but then jacking the bill waaay up without checking 1st to see if the extra work and money is OK before going ahead with it.  Years ago my wife and I booked a room at a lodge for a week of snowmobiling and asked for a price for an all inclusive stay. He gave me a price that I felt was fair and agreed on it. At the end of the week  we went to check out and he told me that he'd given it some thought and had decided that he wasn't charging me enough and wanted an additional $200. I refused to pay the extra and gave him the agreed on price and left.  There was about 25 of us that stayed at that lodge a few different times but after the attempted rip-off and me telling everyone about it, nobody ever went back. He tried to beat me for $200, but ended up losing a few thousand dollars in the process."

819187,limeyangler,2013-11-20 02:19:00,5204,"Hi all,  So here's the deal.  Took my Husqvarna snowblower to a small engine mechanic business. Wanted them to change the belts and give it a tune up/service etc. I was told it would be $200.  When i got home i realized that i had forgotten to ask him to check the electric ignition on it. It would just make a whirring sound but not turn the engine over.  The next day he called and told me something to do with the flywheel/starter motor bracket…yadayadayadayada……..""i have a used part i can put in "" yadayadayadayada.  I ask how much this will cost me now all in with the original work included. he tells me $400. I told him, ""no thanks Tom, just do the original work then as i can hand crank it still"".  I get off the phone and the wife says i should just get it done, end of problem. I call Tom right back within 2 minutes and say, ""hey Tom, on second thoughts can you go ahead and do what we just discussed"", he says yeah and we confirm it is all in $400 and he tells me it will be ready by Tuesday. I say i will collect it on Wednesday and the EXACT last words out of my mouth are, ""so i'll see you Wednesday with $400."" he replied ""YUP"".   So i get home at 8pm and my wife tells me ""Tom left a message saying he short changed himself on the cost of the repairs, he says the snowblower is fixed but the total is …..$596.90!!!!!!! ""   What are my options here?  I am pretty sure there is something about a mechanic not being able to go over 10% of an agreed quote/estimate. Even if that does not apply, surely he can't go ahead and charge what he likes without at least discussing it with me first?!     THOUGHTS PLEASE!  "
819188,BillM,2013-11-20 02:23:00,17367,I'd go there with the $400 and not a cent more.    Not your fault he under estimated the work.
819190,ChasinTails,2013-11-20 02:34:00,90,yup give him 400 and walk out not your fault its his so it should be his problem not yours
819191,limeyangler,2013-11-20 02:37:00,5204,"Yeah…thats what i was thinking of doing, i don't want to answer his call so he has a chance to do anything to the snowblower, just show up and say $400 and say thats what we agreed….give me my snowblower. What happens if he refuses to give me my snowblower…..what are my rights?   I'd go there with the $400 and not a cent more.    Not your fault he under estimated the work.   yup give him 400 and walk out not your fault its his so it should be his problem not yours"
819192,porkpie,2013-11-20 02:40:00,2521,Do you have a written estimate?
819195,Terry,2013-11-20 02:44:00,14456,"your word against his  he's going to claim he said 200 for the on and 400 for the other  good luck  take your video camera and record, he might admit he made a mistake"
819198,Rattletrap2,2013-11-20 02:49:00,1652,"That really sucks! In my opinion, a deal is a deal. If he got into the work and found other issues, he should have contacted you to get approval to proceed. If he just under estimated his labour, it is on him. You win some, you lose some. Depending on the make and age of your machine, that price of $596 could have pushed things past the point of you even wanting to proceed with any repairs versus replacement of the entire unit.  Seems like a poor way of conducting business."

819208,Rattletrap2,2013-11-20 03:19:00,1652,"Simon, I've serviced mechanical equipment for over 30 years. It was never my own business, but I treated it as such. If I screwed up on an estimate,  I paid with my time. Just the way it is. If I thought there could be hidden issues, I would level with you first and explain exactly what my plan was to fix it. I would always let you know about anything unexpected up front and make sure you were still okay to proceed. Communication is key in these situations. Adding almost 50% to an estimate is not!  Good luck!"
819216,Blue Lk,2013-11-20 04:26:00,337,"Small town here Simon,nobody stays in business by ""ripping off'' the locals. I would talk to ""Tom"" & try to reach a mutual satisfactory agreement. Imho"
819217,danc,2013-11-20 04:27:00,4677,Geez. That's not good business. I bought a one year old Ariens 28 inch last winter with less than an hour on it for $800.00.
819220,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-20 05:06:00,2582,Simon  I had a similar situation here with my roto tiller a number of years ago. I paid the guy and just went somewhere else from then on. Trouble is I have had issues with the last 2 people to have there hands on my tiller.  I ended up after 15 years going back to the original guy because he at least did an excellent job with my tiller and was always excellent except for the one incident that drove me away. Everything has been great since I came back to him. I can't tell you what to do...but in my case if I had just given my first guy one  mulligan I could have saved years of grief.
819227,Terry,2013-11-20 09:51:00,14456,"you might have to go to small claim court but if you have the message, you should win  tell him you can't pay that much when you were quoted 400 so you will not be picking it up till the court settles the case, however you will be renting a blower till he releases your blower at 400  bucks and the rental fee and other costs will be added to the 196.90 in the court case, as advised by council"
819228,Big Cliff,2013-11-20 10:07:00,6899,"Ok I am a small engine mechanic and I am certified on Husqvarna so I have worked on plenty of them.  Now to be honest with you I would have to know a whole lot more before I could tell you what is a fair price or not. What is the model and serial number Which belt did he have to change the auger belt or the drive belt Were there any other issues (broken shear pins worn bushings trouble shifting gears) I assume he included an oil change and checked the fuel system, greased the auger... As for the starter issue; It is unusual for a flywheel to go on any of them, (but without being there and seeing it myself .....) the symptom you described is usually associated with the starter. Typically a rebuilt starter is about $100.00 and can be changed out in about 1/2 an hour, a new starter about $200.00. Oh, and what is his posted hourly shop rate.  At this point I would go to him with the $596.00 in hand, (if you don't pay he has the right to hold on to the snow blower) (after you get it back you could take him to small claims court and try to recover the difference) Get a detailed invoice from him showing what parts had to be replaced and any other work done.  Tell him you are really disapointed that he didn't call you when he realized that he was going to be over his estimate by nearly $200.00 and ask him if he can do anything to make this right with you. (If he didn't include taxes in his estimates that could account for about $60.00 above what you were expecting to pay) Also ask him for the used/broken parts because a friend of yours is a licensed, certified Husqvarna mechanic and would like to have a look at them.  Let me know how you make out."
819232,DanD,2013-11-20 12:30:00,2223,"All we're seeing/hearing here is the bottom line, the price tag. Go in and talk to the guy and find out why and where these extra charges came from. Take a minute and do the math; by the time you take all the tax off, it's something like $125.00 difference.  Like I said go in and have a talk; listen to what he has to say and let him know how you feel. If you both keep an open mind, I bet you two will come to a mutual agreement on the bill. Yes he should have called you; but maybe he was into this job up to his ass and the only thing to do was finish the repairs or junk the whole thing. Nobody would have been happy if that were the case. Just because he didn't call, don't you do the same thing by not talking to him.  Dan.  Sorry I had to add this; My Dad always would tell me this when he knew I was pissed at someone. “Danny you’ll catch more flies with a little bit of sugar, then you would with a whole gallon of vinegar”"
819233,Rizzo,2013-11-20 12:58:00,4754,that sucks but I would imagine you can work something out. Maybe split the difference if you feel the work was legit but he just didn't call you?
819235,aplumma,2013-11-20 13:22:00,6896,An open line of honest communication is your best friend. I would go by the shop and talk to him and see what services you got for the 196.00. He might have been in the project and found an issue and made the decision because you were such a nice guy to keep working instead of pulling out of the job and waiting for your approval. I have people ask me what the price of a job is going to be and most times I will give a rough estimate which is my best guess as to what the price is going to be from the state of the project that I can see before it is disassembled and examined. A broken bolt can account for an hour to free up or worse rethreading/heli coil the item. Did he do something wrong yes he didn't notify you of the over run did you do something wrong yes you do not have a written estimate. Legally a verbal contract is not enforceable while a written contract can not be amended by an oral agreement. I think that you will find that a repairman who wants to continue doing business with you will be flexible on the costs and a good customer will want to pay the repairman a fair wage for the work he did.  Best of luck and keep the sugar closer than the vinegar.  Art
819237,lew,2013-11-20 13:56:00,12766,"If we're given a quote to do a job from anyone and they find out the price is gonna be 30% more than the estimate, I think it's only fair that they call to give the up-dated price before going ahead with the job."

819242,Richie Razor,2013-11-20 14:24:00,536,"Seriously, small claims for $200? A verbal quote is one thing, but if he messes up and re quotes you a higher price because of a mistake, I'm sure there could be some common ground to be found to acknowledge his mistake. After all he can refuse the work, doesn't matter the reason... What's really matters is how bad do you need that piece of equipment up and running?"
819244,BillM,2013-11-20 14:32:00,17367,"A court case is silly.    If he won't bite on the $400, split the difference with him and be done with it."
819250,Whopper,2013-11-20 15:15:00,2174,Stop along the way and pick up Uncle Guido and his violin case and make him a offer he can't refuse
819251,Squid,2013-11-20 15:19:00,1656,I totally agree with Art's assessment of the situation. its not worth the 200 dollars to go to court. If you are not working and have the time then maybe but if you have a full time job ( no time)  then to me it is better to discuss it with the mechanic and see what he says before jumping to conclusions.
819255,fisherman7,2013-11-20 16:20:00,325,"Like the many others have said, talk to him first and see what his side of the story is. Then offer to split the difference if his side seems reasonable. Seems a fair way to do it."
