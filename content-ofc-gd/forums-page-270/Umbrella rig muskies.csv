819380,outllaw,2013-11-21 14:41:00,1232,on one of the rigs they had 5 hooks. illegal in Ontario. as we all know a treble counts as 1 hook on artificial lures. the max. hooks on a fishing line/rod is 4 in Ontario.

Which one?  They did explain that they had cut hooks off of some lures to keep within the four hook rule.

819395,cram,2013-11-21 17:38:00,1733,I only see 4 hooks.  Be sure to note that they removed the hooks entirely from one of the baits.
819398,outllaw,2013-11-21 18:36:00,1232,I watched it with no sound oh well I must be mistaken.. but at 7.05 of the video I saw the feller on the right holding the rig with 5 hooks. my mistake gents
