819750,nancur373,2013-11-23 02:49:00,1211,I saved a lady friend from choking once.....
819758,muskymatt,2013-11-23 03:34:00,2608,"Hahahaha that's priceless. Only in Canada,  and Newfoundland at that lol. I can just imagine the conversation after, "" so I'm walkin down the beach and I see this shark choking on a moose eh?""  LoL wait till the Americans get a hold of that one."
819821,Moosebunk,2013-11-23 17:42:00,3970,First time ever icefishing the fella who took me used moose meat and I had bacon.  We both caught specks. lol.  Wonder which a shark would really prefer?
819826,ch312,2013-11-23 18:08:00,1590,"Very odd encounter to say the least.  A while back while visiting Newfoundland I had the opportunity to see one of these sharks (about 13-14ft in length) from about 10 ft away while we were jigging for mackerel and cod. In one eventful day we saw the shark, caught some mackerel and cod, pulled up some lobster, picked some sea snails, and caught some sea run brookies.   Can't wait to go back for the third time"
