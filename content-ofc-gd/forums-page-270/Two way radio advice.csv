819753,kickingfrog,2013-11-23 02:55:00,8333,I'm thinking of a two way radio for a hunter.  Thoughts?  Things to look for? Stay away from?
819772,alexmedic,2013-11-23 13:19:00,186,"All I can offer is a stay away tip.  I recently won a set of Cobra CXT235's  Nice and small, great range.  However, and adjust you make (volume channel, etc) results in the unit emmiting a loud (and I mean loud) beep.  Kinda noticeable when you are trying to be stealth in the bush!"
819774,aplumma,2013-11-23 13:30:00,6896,if there is a signal use texting cheap and unlimited range.   Art
819777,Fisherman,2013-11-23 13:59:00,7201,"If you can, buy from a US source,  ""down there"" they allow up to 5watt GMRS/FRS radios, ""up here"" we only get the 2 watt radios.  Makes a whole heapin lot of difference."
819799,kickingfrog,2013-11-23 16:24:00,8333,"This hunter still doesn't have a cell phone, that's why I thought the walkie talkies might be an option. I know the range thing is always way over stated but I figured this might work within 5kms or so."
819808,Fisherman,2013-11-23 16:53:00,7201,"I got mine about 7 years ago from Cabelas,  used them up on Nippissing a bunch of years ago,  me in the cottage and the boys in the ice hut, they worked quite well.  Used them on a couple of deer hunts with about 5km distance between the guys, mine was the only one to make the connection, that's why I recommend getting the higher power ones."
819809,Sinker,2013-11-23 16:57:00,8692,"I have tried several different models, and I can't get 5km on any of them.....even on open water. IMO, they all suck! Better than nothing, but not near as good as texting on a cell phone.....unless of course there is no service.  S."
819810,Steve,2013-11-23 17:01:00,2075,"my experience was like sinkers.  we used to use them on quinte, fishing the reach.  unless the boat you were communicating with was in eye sight, you weren't talking to them."
819816,Bernie,2013-11-23 17:24:00,3190,Several of us in our hunting group use a Garmin Rino.They are awesome for how we hunt. One of the guys keys his mic and it sends his location signal to one of the bush doggers.It will take the dogger right to him. Don't cheap out with the regular radios though. Get a high power.Even a good one can be limited to a kilometer in bush and hills.
819849,Sinker,2013-11-23 20:00:00,8692,"If its hilly, forget about it.  I've had guys in eyesight on stand, and couldn't reach them. I think those ones were motorolas.....tried the cobra's too....same junk.  S."
819851,kickingfrog,2013-11-23 20:06:00,8333,By the sounds of it the ones I used as a kid were as good as the ones they have now.
819853,Joeytier,2013-11-23 20:17:00,3990,Ever thought of portable VHF radios?
819854,dave524,2013-11-23 20:20:00,4508,get a basic Ham Ticket and use a couple of two meter handhelds.
820221,chris.brock,2013-11-25 20:36:00,4053,"if you decide to try the Canadian Tire or Wally GMRS radios, we found the Motorolas to better and more durable than GE's or Cobras etc  I think they claim 56 km range (a total joke)"
820230,Terry,2013-11-25 21:23:00,14456,well I like the Baofeng UV-5R A Dual-Band 136-174/4​​00-480 MHz FM Ham Two-way Radio it does GMRS it does marine band it does vhf it does music stations and the cop and the fire channels can be set for 5 watts I paid 39  bucks for mine with free shipping from china   http://www.ebay.com/bhp/baofeng-uv-5r-radio

820243,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-25 22:19:00,10439,"If you can, buy from a US source,  ""down there"" they allow up to 5watt GMRS/FRS radios, ""up here"" we only get the 2 watt radios.  Makes a whole heapin lot of difference.  Yep, I have a pair of the Motorolla's with the high output."
820286,Fisherman,2013-11-25 23:41:00,7201,"well I like the Baofeng UV-5R A Dual-Band 136-174/4​​00-480 MHz FM Ham Two-way Radio it does GMRS it does marine band it does vhf it does music stations and the cop and the fire channels can be set for 5 watts I paid 39  bucks for mine with free shipping from china   http://www.ebay.com/bhp/baofeng-uv-5r-radio Terry, do you have to manually enter the GMRS frequencies or is it like channel 1,2,3..etc.   This is an interesting radio."
820292,Terry,2013-11-25 23:51:00,14456,there is a program you download then hook it up to the puter and click the freqs you want and if you want transmit and receive or just receive  and what not..then upload to the radio and play
820308,Fisherman,2013-11-26 00:51:00,7201,"there is a program you download then hook it up to the puter and click the freqs you want and if you want transmit and receive or just receive  and what not..then upload to the radio and play Okay, thanks very much."
820432,robfrawley,2013-11-26 15:30:00,25,"Motorola MS560  Waterproof, and float 56 km range** Headphone jack to keep quiet when in the bush or hands free use."
820440,Big Cliff,2013-11-26 15:48:00,6899,"Texting for me. I can sit in my stand chat with my son in French River, (I just put it on vibrate and stick it in my shirt pocket) be out in the boat talk to any of my other buddies even if they aren't out fishing. I tried the radio thing for a few years and several different ones. Never found one that worked well and the biggest problem was that you were limited to communicating with someone that had their radio on what ever chanel you were on."
