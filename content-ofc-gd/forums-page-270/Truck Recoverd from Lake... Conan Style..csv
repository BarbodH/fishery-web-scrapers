820011,dave524,2013-11-24 18:12:00,4508,Any bets on how many times it took them to perfect that
820012,Sinker,2013-11-24 18:14:00,8692,They must have learned that trick from a bunch of newfies!  S.
820013,Bernie,2013-11-24 18:16:00,3190,Very cool.Have something similar to this. My dad took the movie. Early 60's.  
820027,kickingfrog,2013-11-24 19:06:00,8333,Give me a long enough lever and I can move the earth.

820095,kickingfrog,2013-11-25 00:16:00,8333,Huge surprise if it was a beer. No surprise if it was a bottle of vodka.
820097,Fisherpete,2013-11-25 00:44:00,1814,It's a Honda... bet she started right up LOL

820134,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-25 03:28:00,4399,They should have a kiosk on Simcoe the business should be good starting soon!!!!!!
820136,Canuck2fan,2013-11-25 03:51:00,1444,"Brilliant use of what they had handy to get the job done.  Not sure if it started right up though. It does look like a snorkel on the left hand side of the hood to me. Probably not good enough for water that deep though, but maybe it has some other extra seals and stuff...  On the plus side definitely cold enough that mold wouldn't start growing right away LOL  Get it running  and get it traded in. Just lightly dry it out, who is going to question wet floor mats with much snow on the ground?  As for the beer he probably drank that as ""liquid wool"" to be able to brave swimming out of it."
820283,pidge,2013-11-25 23:36:00,438,How can I get ahold of these guys. Neat vintage video I enjoyed that just as much.
