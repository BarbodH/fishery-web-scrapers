Our group marked lots today, bite was slow. We landed 2/5 biggest was 6 lbs and we caught 15-16 jumbo perch.  PM if your heading out or want some more info."

Laker John and I fished from 0845 to 1700, walking across Hay Bay from the Shermans Launch all the way to the big weedbed  on the southshore by the farm with the silo. Many of you will remember that area.  We drilled 15 holes in our meandering walk across the ice, SHAD everywhere frozen in the ice.... No wonder the walleyes aren't biting in Hay Bay, the food supply must be staggering large under the ice.  The ice was 9-10 inches all across Hay Bay.  Stay Tuned  David  aka  Superdad"
