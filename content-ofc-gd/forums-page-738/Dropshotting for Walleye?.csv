424327,rbaquial,2010-01-21 01:20:00,968,"Hey Folks,  Just a quick question regarding Dropshotting for 'Eye's... I've seen shows of pros doing drop-shotting for walleyes... my question is...  Do they use Leader Material? or regular line?  Your thoughts?"
424347,pikeie,2010-01-21 02:20:00,380,regular mono or floro would work fine. you rarely get bit off by walleye.
424349,trevy727,2010-01-21 02:23:00,351,leader line not required
424350,douG,2010-01-21 02:25:00,2693,SSShhhhhhhhh.  Don't mention this or you'll wreck Christmas for everybody.  And their birthday too.
424352,wallyboss,2010-01-21 02:29:00,1095,Works in the winter also.  that's how I setup my walleye tipdown if there is a lot of current.  And like Ben Beattie said use a jig and minnow at the botom instead of a drop shot weight.
424369,Grimace,2010-01-21 03:13:00,2020,No need for the leader material.  Walleyes have cone shaped teeth.  Mono should work just fine.
424415,dave524,2010-01-21 11:02:00,4508," thanks for that, I've always wondered how a 2lb. hammerhandle pike could bite you off most of the time and a 5 lb. walleye so very rarely."
424430,trapshooter,2010-01-21 12:42:00,1234,"instead of using a dropshot weight on bottom, use a jig tipped with a minnow.  Half the time fish come on the bottom hook, half the time on the top hook.  Great rig."
424471,fish-miester,2010-01-21 14:57:00,864,   same here
424474,GBW,2010-01-21 15:07:00,8460,Did you not watch FOF last night?  Same set up applies to walleye's.
424485,daryl0815,2010-01-21 15:32:00,225,"I like that idea of using a jig on the bottom instead of just a sinker, thats brilliant!"
424608,archie_james_c,2010-01-21 23:29:00,618,tagged for interest
424631,rbaquial,2010-01-22 00:29:00,968, Seriously! I really liked that idea... up your odds!  Thanks everyone for your input!
424647,kevin booth,2010-01-22 01:01:00,57,"i fish quinte alot and on average to clear days for best odds use super line of some sort because the no strech you want to see and feel any movement of line or you want to feel it as well and yes for sure use floro and no more than 10 or 12 lbs as well 4 or 6 ft of it.you should have a good set up,and if you and a jig to the bottom of it will wor as well but you will also catch suckers and catfish if the jig is just lying on the bottom."
