HOW: Participants have been numbered in the order they signed up (currently 1-50). When selection starts, we will use a random number generator (www.random.org) For example: Team 1 - <click> 28 = tjsa Team 2 - <click> 38 = worm dangler ... and so on. Subsequent dispersals will be done in the same manner in groups of 10 until the June 30 deadline.  If you haven't signed up yet, do it now! http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=39531"
