424158,lew,2010-01-20 13:11:00,12766,"My 2005 Safari pulled my 1650 Crestliner with no problems at all, infact I'd hardly even feel it behind the van.  When I bought the 3000 + lb. Skeeter package last spring though, the Safari would still pull it on level ground OK and the stopping wasn't a problem either with the trailer brakes, but it got to be a bit of a struggle on long steep hills. The Safari has a pretty strong engine but definetely has it's limits.    Now that I've purchased the new F-150 with the 5.4 engine everything's gonna be good.    Not sure of the weight of your Ranger combo HTHM, but I'm guessing around 3000 maybe ??  If your full sized van is a V-8 you shouldn't have a problem."

Was pretty funny. Their was no ruts or hole,Just very slippery ice. The truck just sitting with all four tires turning. She got some weight behind her 7200 lbs dry. Took 6 guys just to start the momentum. Then last year.I help to push half a dozen vehicles out of the parking in Innisfil. Jump in my truck and pull out still in 2 wheel drive.  Do want too get a tuner. But first want to do the engine and tranny . No rush thou. Got another 800k to go."

424582,justin elia,2010-01-21 21:38:00,151," As long as the van is rated to tow the total weight of the van and boat combined, you're good to go.  I wouldn't risk voiding an insurance claim if an accident happens.  Insurance companies love to find ways out of claims, and MTO has become much more strict on the roads.  Safety first.  I would have suggested an F150; as long as you take your time driving and not hammer it, its pretty fuel efficient for its size.  Best of luck with the new vehicle!"

I towed it with a Chevy Astro van, but even it struggled at times, and it wasn't the best with gas consumption.  Whatever vehicle you choose, remember that it also has to have the brakes to stop your boat.  I would not suggest you tow it with any front wheel drive van.  I'm not sure what you are towing it with right now, but if you already have a vehicle, why don't you look for a reliable commuter car that's good on gas, and use it for work."
423152,Michael_Brown,2010-01-17 03:19:00,411,"I purchased a Hyundai Sante Fe last fall. It is a fantastic vehicle. 3.3L engine and on-demand all wheel drive it towed my lund last year and the new triton this year. You don't even notice the boat back there. The fuel mileage towing the Triton from Kentucky home was 12.3L/100km. The all-wheel drive is great at slippery boat ramps and the wife calls it her tank. It has ESC which will not let the vehicle fishtail or spin out, we tried on a snow covered parking lot. (bride and I actually had a lot of fun) Great looking vehicle and amazing warrenty. After years of domestics with nothing but problems this has been a great change. So far besides oil changes I have replaced one headlight bulb $12.99, 51,000km. We bought the limited model so it has lots of toys but you don't need a gas guzzling tank to haul a boat.  Just my two cents but I'm impressed with it."
423178,Sinker,2010-01-17 04:23:00,8692,How much does that boat weigh?
423181,John Bacon,2010-01-17 04:37:00,3277,"Do you two your boat often?  If you tow it to the cottage in the spring and back home in the fall; you may want to consider renting or borrowing a vehicle when you need to tow it.  This obviously won't work if tow it to a lake and back every weekend.  I can't really suggest a vehicle.  However, if are driving for work you should be able to deduct a portion of your auto expenses.  That will take a bit of the sting out of the expenses.  Remember to actually track your business mileage rather than just picking a % out of the air."
423856,bigbuck,2010-01-19 15:48:00,2449,"How heavy is the boat/trailer?? Make sure you leave 1000lbs of towing capacity extra. When towing capacity is measured, it usually means a 150lb driver and a full tank of gas and absolutely nothing else in the tow vehicle. So with passengers and gear you don't exceed it. Don't overload because if you need to stop in a hurry, it won't happen. I've seen too many yahoos on the road towing more than they should going wayyy too fast. I pull my 19ft Larson with my Olds Silhouette extended (3500lb towing cap) and it is too close to the limit. I'll be buying an SUV next year with a V8."
423860,Raf,2010-01-19 16:07:00,3495,"I think you are going to need to suck it up, keep your van or replace with a v8 truck.  those glass boats aren't teh lightest things."

I cannot say enough about this vehicle.  It drives like a car, storage of a van, never let me down.  It pulls and stops my boat no problem (around 2500-3000 lbs package).  Not too sure of the milage, but I know it is better than what my Astro was.  The only thing it is missing is a Dave Mercer bobble head!!!!  "

Have to fill up at North Bay to make it  to Temagami. Got 195K on her now and she's still going strong.  Too boot I can get a Clam Nanook and a Frabil Recon  with all the extra gear in the back with the seats folded down.  My next one will be an Expedition too.

Or maybe this?    But in all seriousness ....full sized SUV or 1/2 ton ... I wouldn't settle for anything less...  It's not to say that the Minivans or Compact Trucks aren't capable of towing your boat... But are they capable of stopping the rig in a safe distance???    I know that my Buddy's ZR-2 Sonoma has a REALLY hard time slowing down his 18' Lund....and Mikey's Ranger can barely stop his 18'Ranger even with electric brakes.  Play Safe.  RFS 
423935,bigbuck,2010-01-19 20:46:00,2449,"Keep your van for towing. Get yourself a used Impala or Grand Prix with a 3.8 and you'll have a good reliable car capable of decent gas mileage but is also fairly heavy and safe. I'm a road warrior and do over 40k/year and Iwould not even think of getting a small car. With all the crazy tractor trailer drivers out there........I need a heavier car to feel comfy, besides, they ride nice."

They changed the motor from a 3.5 to a 4.0.

Sure you can get away with towing with a 1/2 vehicle fo a while... but sooner or later it will catch up to you!!!  Do you really want to be the ""Boat Launch Bozo"" that can't pull his expensive boat up the ramp because he scrimped on the tow vehicle???"
