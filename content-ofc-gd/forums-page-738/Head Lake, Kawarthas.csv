423638,castgame,2010-01-18 20:51:00,161,"so i take it head lake is open for ice fishing this year, and it so happens my friend's got a cottage up there. anybody know anything about the lake at all? i'm suspecting we'll be getting into perch and crappie, maybe walleye? any info at all would be appreciated, thanks"
423643,johnnyb,2010-01-18 21:15:00,3413,"I know that there are two Head lakes up there....the one that runs along hwy#45 has walleye bass and muskie...don't believe there are any crappie in it...but I could be wrong.  I do know if it's a Kawartha Lake and doesn't have Crappie in it, there's no point fishing it through the ice...unless you're after perch, sunfish and rockbass. Not sure about the other Head Lake...which I think is more in Haliburton anyway."
423650,castgame,2010-01-18 21:47:00,161,"yeah, head lake on 45 is the one. reg's seem to say walleye and musky are closed until may and june respectively. so i guess we'll be targeting panfish, unless there's a better body of water to try nearby"
423651,Paully,2010-01-18 21:49:00,712, Walter does'nt want to come over for dinner.. he's closed for dinner  Unless you fish scugog.
423652,johnnyb,2010-01-18 21:51:00,3413,"Lots of lakes in the immediate area that you could chase trout on...roll into Miner's Bay and pop a few holes on Gull Lake, for example.  Check the regs tho...lots of one-line lakes (like Gull) and exceptions in that neck of the woods."
423709,vinnimon,2010-01-19 00:13:00,2593,"Is it connected to fishog lake,norland area?"
423733,Rizzo,2010-01-19 01:11:00,4754,All I know id if you go there next summer watch out for rocks! A dangerous little lake
423734,Chuck Best,2010-01-19 01:14:00,308,"Yup the one on #45 is,That's where we got a hunt camp........TC and tight lines.....Chuck...."
423978,castgame,2010-01-19 22:16:00,161, lake trout? we'll need something accessible by foot... so no 10k+ snowmobile approaches
424054,Rizzo,2010-01-20 01:28:00,4754,can you walk 100 feet? I fished Miner's Bay a few years back and its no walk at all from your car
424098,Beans,2010-01-20 03:16:00,3339, No walk but...it's that climbing down the hill using a rope that gets tricky...
424383,castgame,2010-01-21 03:59:00,161,well i'm not going to have much trouble with that i don't think
