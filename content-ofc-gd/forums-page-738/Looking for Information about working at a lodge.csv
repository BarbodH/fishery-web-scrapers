413059,Kinger,2009-12-18 00:55:00,351,Hey folks. I have from April until September off from my college program and I was thinking about going and working at a lodge guiding to make some cash. What I would like to know is if anyone has a site or message board with information and horror/success stories so I can select some good lodges to apply to. I'm a very capable multi-species angler who subscribes to the scientific approach to angling and I have very strong interpersonal skills and don't drink alcohol or smoke ciagerettes. Any info would be great and much appreciated.

424494,xeon,2010-01-21 15:59:00,350,"I also guide on LOTW.  Basically, just be yourself, professional, courteous, funny, friendly, tip focused, and be ready for people with all different types of personalities.  There are no ""horror"" stories. Just people who screw up. Also make sure to bring a large assortment of tackle, and ask them if you need to bring your own fish finder, gps, or whatever."
