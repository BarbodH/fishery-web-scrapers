423353,ehg,2010-01-17 22:14:00,2666,When i had a place around Buckhorn there was a person i trusted who tuned up my outboards. Now i am kinda stuck in Toronto but need an engine looked at. Hoping to find dependable service for a 9.9 Johnson. Bought the engines for a couple hundred dollars many years ago so don't want to spend hundreds of dollars for a tune up. Any suggestions or experiences will be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

423611,torco,2010-01-18 19:11:00,656,City Marine is right on the queensway. I know they specialize in Mercury products but think they still service other brands as well.
