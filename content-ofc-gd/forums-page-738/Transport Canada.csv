424292,cranks bait,2010-01-20 23:38:00,721,Hee Hee too funny.  I got a kick out of that watching Mercer last night.  Was really surprised to turn it on and see my buddy Steve from out west doing the avalanche part.  Brought back a lot of memories.  I could name almost every peak around them that they were blowing up.  I also like the liberal GPS commercial. Don't know where you are going with confidence!!!
