We fished both Saturday and Sunday, Saturday the fishing gods were mean to me .. and I lost a few and was skunked.  However today I caught a 20"" and 15"" laker to take home for dinner.  Here's a few pictures from the weekend, sorry there aren't more but I didn't have a camera and this is what my friend emailed me.   Hidden Bay Lodge  The Sleds  3lb Laker, 2lb Speck and two smaller 1lb and change Specks  Hidden Bay Lodge"

423781,Dara,2010-01-19 03:51:00,3052,  lemme know when you get it...I'll take you to some new lakes.  Not enough snow for trail riding so I may as well get a bit of fishing in.  Walleye are hitting at Brimley...the wife can sit in the casino while you fish right outside the door
