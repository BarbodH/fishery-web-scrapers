424224,tightline,2010-01-20 19:31:00,322,Was out for a walk at the lake trails yesterday and took a look for anyone interested...saw a few folks out there fishing so walked out for a chat...they said the bit had been off all week but theres 10-12 in of ice and plenty of holes out there so its not for lack of trying I guess...Saw another couple guys on the high side of 24 out near the trees too...didn't walk out to ask but for all who thought it was closed it doesn't seem to be...here's a few pic's of a couple turkeys we stumbled across...keep you busy chasing them if the fishing is no good!!!
