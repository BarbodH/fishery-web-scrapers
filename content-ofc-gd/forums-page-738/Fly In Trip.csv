366754,jeff24,2009-07-27 14:49:00,35,"Looking for the fall.  Would like amazing fishing for Walleye, Bass and Pike, min 3 days, Northern Ontario Fly In lake for a few buddies. Hoping some of you could share previous trips and experiences to help us in our search.  I understand availability will be an issur to overcome.  Thanks.  P.S. Feel free to pm me."
366761,lookinforwalleye,2009-07-27 14:58:00,4399,Sorry can`t help you with recommendation other than save your money unless of course your wealthy. I recently priced a fly-in to a well know Ontario lodge and the price came to about 5 grand for two people for 3-4 days.
366763,Whopper,2009-07-27 15:06:00,2174,"I've used both these outfitters and wouldn't hesitate to return to either No bass though, all the walleye and pike you care to catch  http://www.armstrongoutposts.com/rates.shtml  Not a remote by very affordable, been going here the last three years for walleye opener. The owner is a great guy and will treat you right  http://www.trophypikecanada.com/  Good Luck in your search"
366764,solopaddler,2009-07-27 15:14:00,8605,  My group is leaving this week for a 5 night trip out of Chapleau. Cost per person is $620 Can. tax in. Pretty reasonable if you ask me.
366768,BillM,2009-07-27 15:22:00,17367, Diggity diggity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
366774,jeff24,2009-07-27 15:33:00,35,I await the report!
366819,doack,2009-07-27 17:15:00,46," Good luck up there, we have two weeks to go.  Make sure you let me know how you did."

366884,douG,2009-07-27 20:40:00,2693,"Where in N Ontario?  Do you want full Murrican Plan, or do you want to pack your food and bedding in?"
366892,solopaddler,2009-07-27 21:06:00,8605, How did I know you were going to chime in with that?  Honestly dude I think most people that read the various boards get it by now. Same exact message posted literally countless times.  Are you sure you're not getting any kind of kickback from AWO?  Seriously give it a rest.
366894,jtuffedge,2009-07-27 21:09:00,6,"Nielsen's Fly In on Rowan Lake has largemouth bass, Lake Trout, Northern's and is an incredible Musky lake.  Hill Lake is a short portage with Walleye.  American Plan is $210.00 per day plus about $225.00 for the float plane. They have housekeeping cabins for less.  Great people and equipment.  www.nielsensflyinlodge.com  You'll like it!!  John"
366946,lookinforwalleye,2009-07-28 00:41:00,4399," certainly better than a 2,500 per person Can tax out.  I hope you have a good trip."
366972,ctdd2006,2009-07-28 01:31:00,531,Who are you flying with Solo?  I'm in Elliot Lake and am looking for an early fall/late summer fly out with the boys and Chapleau would be a nice close spot!  I hope you have a great trip and I hope things warm up for you.   Cool and wet are keeping the pesky flies near by during a part in the season where you'd normally wouldn't have to worry about them.  Cheers!
367115,jeff24,2009-07-28 13:09:00,35,"Thanks douG.  This will be our first time.  We're fine with packing in some stuff and cooking.  Certainly okay with roughing it.  Great fishing is the most important.  Any help is great.  We're from the hamilton area and ideally we would like to keep the drive to 6 hrs and then fly?????  New liskeard area and a bit north maybee.  As I said, this is our first and are trying to put something together for Sept."
367141,solopaddler,2009-07-28 14:18:00,8605," You're definitely going to want to choose an outpost camp imo. This means you've got the entire lake to yourself, bring your own food and do your own cooking. It'll be the cheapest way to do your first fly in and imo offers the best experience. You'll have to drive further than 6 hours from Hamilton though bud. There's probably slightly better fishing available if you're willing to drive to at least Nakina. There's a slew of great outfitters in Nakina that I've used and all offer superior fishing and camps. However the following outfitters are all excellent as well (I've flown with them all) and are an easier drive from the Hamilton area (where I'm from).   http://www.air-ivanhoe.com/ out of Folyet.  http://www.hawkair.com/ and http://www.ontariowilderness.com/ out of Hawk Junction east of Wawa.  http://northtoadventure.ca/view.php?lodge=...ge=wwa_outposts   out of White River  I've also flown with these guys out of Cochrane:  http://www.aircochrane.com/  Cochrane is an even easier drive straight up hwy 11. We have flown out of Cochrane on a few occasions because of the easy drive and quality of fishing (which is very good).  However if I had to choose I'd pick one of the first 4 outfitters mentioned. North of Cochrane you're in the James Bay lowlands. The terrain is monotonous and the lakes are all generally featureless shallow dishpans.  The 1st 4 outfitter's lakes are still on the shield. The lakes are deeper and more varied and the terrain is more interesting."
367411,Billy Bob,2009-07-28 23:05:00,5865,I also can recommend http://www.air-ivanhoe.com/   Went there last year.......George has a FIRST RATE operation.....whatever you do don't use Gogama Lodge....... http://www.gogama.com/  it's was DISGUSTING when we flew into one of Dicks outpost.......and I have heard may other complaints about his business.  Did Nakina years ago....good fishing but WAY too far to go.....fishing out of Ivanhoe or Gogama was just as good.  Bob
367993,jeff24,2009-07-30 13:52:00,35,"Okay, so plans have been re -routed.  It looks like the fly in is out based on work schedules and group constraints.........   We will be doing a drive in camp.  One of the guys says he has heard good things about Island Lake Camp in Temagami.  Has anyone heard anything.  They had an article in OOD Mag.  a few months ago.?????????????"
367999,corvette1,2009-07-30 14:08:00,1765,i have been to nakina 5 times with leuenbergers awesome people to deal with my last trip there 2 years ago the 2 of us cought 365 walleyes not bad in my eyes stay away from torando's out of port -lorning worst trip of my life
369376,jeff24,2009-08-04 13:22:00,35,So no one has been to Island Lake Camp in Temagami??
369397,ColdH20guy,2009-08-04 14:05:00,312,Bill nice pic..I have seen it recently in  a magazine somewhere..hmm where was that again   ...lol
369462,fisherman7,2009-08-04 17:01:00,325,I've not been but my buddy had a great time on Lady Evelyn Lake. They stayed at Garden Island Lodge (I think that's what it was called)
423881,wvman,2010-01-19 18:18:00,5," Agree totally with the post about Gogama!  They treat you like dirt if you fly into one of their outpost camps and don't expect the cabin or boats to be in reasonable shape.  The fishing was great but they don't treat you very well unless you stay at the lodge adn the equipment is bad.  If they ever change hands, attitude, and equipment then I might go back."
423895,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-19 19:05:00,0,These are both decent operators with decent rates.  hawk air from wawa: http://hawkair.com/  lauzon (better for bass): http://www.lauzonaviation.com/
423904,torco,2010-01-19 19:34:00,656,  Hey what lakes did you fish with tornado out of port loring? I ask because I have done a canoe trip to a couple lakes in that area and one has a fly in camp on it. I always thought the guys at the camp would be floored if they knew we could get in and out in 3hrs by canoe for free
423926,craigdritchie,2010-01-19 20:28:00,1586,"Five grand????? Are you kidding me??  It doesn't even cost that much to go to Saskatchewan. Shop around, my friend, because no Ontario fly-in is worth that kind of scratch."
