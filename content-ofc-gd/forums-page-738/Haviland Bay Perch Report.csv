Not knowing how to delete a thread, I'll turn it into a Lake Superior Perch report.  We went out last Saturday and set up shop in the closest group of huts to shore. Nice and warm, about two degrees. There was about 14"" of ice and as soon as we put down lines we were catching them. Action slowed during the day, but we had fun none the less.  They were all around 10"" long. We kept about 10 for dinner. Also had some good conversations with some other fishermen. Based on what we say on Saturday, I'll probably be out there a lot this winter, close to town and good fishing. If you see my hut stop in and say hi!  They were hitting on small shiners rigged on teardrop jigs in about 30ft of water.  We also caught some smelt which I also kept for dinner and Lake Trout Fishing.        "
