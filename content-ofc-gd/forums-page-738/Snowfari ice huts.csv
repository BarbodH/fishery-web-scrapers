423843,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-19 14:19:00,2690,Just a quick thanks to members who have posted about this operation...almost made the mistake of booking a weekend with them.  Then I read some of the horror stories that guys have posted in the past...yikes...guess that would be why they still have openings at fairly short notice.
423855,Jay T,2010-01-19 15:45:00,282,Your welcome!!
424057,Rizzo,2010-01-20 01:30:00,4754,haha...ya my buddy was dumb enough to book with them last year. Told me he's pretty sure half the hut was still on parking lot they were so close to shore. They caught a mudpuppy...that's what people go to Nipissing for isn't it?
424138,freddyp,2010-01-20 05:49:00,27,Very Welcome! Ya coulda stayed in a hotel on land and caught more than with this guy!
424140,tributaryhunter,2010-01-20 07:56:00,108,"probably one of the worst hut operators i have ever delt with, a few years ago one of my buddies decided to book a weeekend with them so i said sure why not and never again, huts are a piece of crap, the beds broke, the night fish alarm was a santuary bell, plus they were located in the traffic zone a well and the people that run it are retarted and useless."
424153,bubbles,2010-01-20 12:45:00,591, Listen man don't hold back tell us how you really feel.
424156,Big Cliff,2010-01-20 13:05:00,6899,"There are some fantastic operators out there and then there are some that can ruin a fishing trip. Many guys like myself can't afford to get away more than once or twice a year and to end up booked with an outfit that doesn't provide you with a good experience can be a real bummer. It is understood that fishing is fishing and the fish don't always bite but when you book a trip what you should be able to expect is a professional operator, clean, serviced accomodations that are in reasonably good shape and reasonable help and opportunity to catch fish. From what I have read in the past about this outfit, this isn't the case. ""retarded"" might be a little harsh though!"
424157,Spiel,2010-01-20 13:09:00,9065," I believe the word was ""retarted"" Cliff but I agree, not only ""harsh"" but also uncalled for."
424160,Bernie,2010-01-20 13:22:00,3190,Retarted... Definition.... is when you go into a bakery and you eat one and get another
424161,Jer,2010-01-20 13:28:00,1426,Retarted...when a rich old man dumps his trophy wife for a newer model
424162,Headhunter,2010-01-20 13:30:00,5703,LOL Bernie and Jer! HH
424172,Big Cliff,2010-01-20 14:10:00,6899," Ok, Ok  so I should have read it instead of trying to understand it. My bad!"
424179,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-20 14:30:00,2690,"Agreed, I also don't usually have too much extra cash for ""special"" trips, so when I do them...I definitely want to be with someone that makes the experience enjoyable.  It isn't always about numbers of fish, but, at least provide decent customer service.  Anyways, thanks again guys!!!!!"
424193,cityfisher,2010-01-20 15:55:00,959,Reminds of of years back when PERCH PALACE was open on Simcoe.... Complete Mess... run a lousy bussiness these days and you wont last... Internet is VERY powerful!
424204,Woodsman,2010-01-20 16:44:00,1286,Quite true. If they do sell I hope the new owners have enough sense to change the name. I can think of one place on Nipissing where the new owners had to work quite hard to overcome the past owners practices. The name is still enough for some to refuse to return although all I've heard about the new owners is quite positive.
424409,tributaryhunter,2010-01-21 08:09:00,108,"srry about the harsh word, we spent too much money for nothing and a ridiculous service, and yes i agree there are amazing hut operators out on nippissing, been to a few and always book another trip with them cheers"
424449,phiphntek,2010-01-21 13:36:00,115,"just got back last night from Hyatt Outdoors.A well run operation.Rob looked after us,made sure we had everything we needed, even offered to move us around if we werent on fish near the hut.Fortunately we getting some perch , pike ,walleye, herring at different times during the day.I plan on returning at some point and I would recommend Rob."
424453,Jer,2010-01-21 13:42:00,1426,"Rob runs a quality operation. I only fished there once several years ago and we had a great time.  Been to Snofarti as well, there is no comparison, the place is a joke."
