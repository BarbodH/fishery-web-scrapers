423680,Daplumma,2010-01-18 22:52:00,1961,There is an extended firearms season down here that runs until March 27th.Most of the bucks have already dropped their horns now and the does are all pretty pregnant.By the end of March they will be quite a bit along in their gestation.I'm not sure I could shoot a doe that late in the season.What are your thoughts?

They usually see on average 20 - 30 of them on a weekend.  I don't think I could shoot a doe that late in the season either.... I must say I truly love eating venison meat but I just could not find the strength to do it.  Leechman"

Didnt happen and wont happen now because overall populations are down.  May see more reduced number of antlerless and additional bow only tags here.  I'd rather not kill a pregnant doe, better for the population to take her in the fall."
423849,cityfisher,2010-01-19 15:01:00,959,i think the bowseason of oct.1 to dec.31st is plenty... certain areas the numbers are way down anyways
