424205,Toddyc20,2010-01-20 16:49:00,141,Hello all.  Myself and a group of friends are heading out to Paudash Lake on Feb 18th and was wondering if anyone has been out there ice fishing this year?  Any tips?  This will only be my second time ice fishing in my whole life and well the last was short on fish.  Any information would be greatly appriciated.
424213,laszlo,2010-01-20 18:15:00,487,I've fished it a few times in the summer. There are about 999 zillion rock bass in there.
424214,Roy,2010-01-20 18:38:00,13728, One more zillion and you have a Brazillian.

424283,Dozer,2010-01-20 22:49:00,896,... how many is 2 Brazilian people?  
424332,Toddyc20,2010-01-21 01:37:00,141,"Okay so there are a lot of rock bass.  Any idea what else is in there?  I have picked up a swedish pimple, williams ice jig, a rapala ice jig, a few airplane style jigs and i have a wide variety of jig heads and coloured hooks.  Do you think this will work?  Thanks for the help."
424381,GBW,2010-01-21 03:57:00,8460,my cousin fishes there and got a few lakers (fish not beer) throuh the ice last year.  I don't know the zone to now the fish open season either but I'm sure the MNR site has info or what is in the lake.
424384,jayess,2010-01-21 04:01:00,187,"If i'm not mistaken, some splake that were stocked in a nearby lake were noted (somehow) to have migrated out of that lake and into Paudash. Never know if you'll hit one of them. Bon appetit if you do!!!"
424432,laszlo,2010-01-21 12:49:00,487,"Aside from the 999 zillion rock bass I mentioned earlier, I've also caught:  Largemouth Bass (now out of season) Smallmouth Bass (now out of season) Whitefish  Again, this was in the summer. There are also some Lake Trout in there and some but very few Walleye which are found in very specific spots from what I hear. Mostly in the North West area of the lake.  Hope that helps."
424660,Toddyc20,2010-01-22 01:32:00,141,Thank you for the help.  I hope we catch a few nice fish and just have an overall great time.  Maybe before I go someone will chime in with some advice on what to use through the ice.
