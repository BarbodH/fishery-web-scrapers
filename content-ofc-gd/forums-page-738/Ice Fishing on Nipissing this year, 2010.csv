423644,freddyp,2010-01-18 21:17:00,27,Heading up this weekend. How's the ice holding out? Slushy with the warm weather? and of course what's the bite like? Walleye around??? THNX -freddyP
423825,Thrasher,2010-01-19 13:05:00,39,"Ice is good, 18"" or so everywhere. No slush, lake consists of snow drifts and bare patches. Drifts are only12"" deep max, and there are some bare patches that you could have a hockey game on. guys pullin big huts out with small cars. The bare spots are very slippery, if you're going with kids, old or drunk folks, it's a recipe for an injury. Fishings been on and off, some say deep, some say shallow. As usual, Nip's unpredictable at best. Hopefully you hit it right. Lively minnows and try mixing up spoons, flyer jigs, jigging raps, and whatever else you can manage from the arsenal. good luck, Thrasher"
423891,sandybay,2010-01-19 18:55:00,64,Thrasher nailed it. Walleye being caught anywhere from 24- 46 fow but only in spurts. Also anything deeper then 30 fow will produce lots of perch so bring some small minnows and have a blast.

Well if all else fails or if the weather stay what they say it's gonna be 0 degrees, then I'll take that trip out a lil deeper for the perch, hopefully jumbos! Walleye is what I'm lookin for though huts are at 24 ft they say. Hopefully the night fishing will work for us, if we can stay sober!"
