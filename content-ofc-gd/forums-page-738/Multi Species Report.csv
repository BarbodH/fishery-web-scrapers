We were constantly catching nice perch, and when they would stop hitting, someone would catch a pike. Also caught many herring, white fish and ling. We did really well using white jig heads tipped with a minnow. Here's some pics. All fish were released.        "

423828,LucG,2010-01-19 13:25:00,779," Thanks Roy. I'd say we have a nice shack. Nice and big at 9x9.   Yeah...  I have a program that removes red eye, but just too lazy. Besides, its the fish you should be looking at!"
