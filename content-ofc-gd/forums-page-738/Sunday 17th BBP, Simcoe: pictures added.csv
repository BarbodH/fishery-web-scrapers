423844,maksuttt,2010-01-19 14:49:00,21,"Sunday morning, BBP parking lot, bunch of buddies waiting to get on the ice…  What do you usually expect from a fishing trip? Catching fish, having fun, getting some challenge… Right combination of those factors is a recipe for the perfect fishing day.  Day was starting slow: fish was where, but not really interested in lures presentation. Early AM produced several lakers: two in +10lb range. All caught in +100’. The action slowed down even more by noontime: moving around didn’t help much – a few lost fish, and couple little lakers weren’t a big consolation… So, it was time to have lunch! I have to say it again: I love portable BBQ!!! Hot dogs on the lake – what’s could be better?!? Thanks, Matt! Most of us left ice by 3PM. I got to the shore with a modest personal result 7:3 (lakers), but in a great mood! Nice to be out fishing!  After a long time being against the idea, I have to admit now: portable ice hut is the way to go. I am a happy owner of a new Frabill Commando single person shanty – this Sunday was first time out with it. It’s light (I don’t use stock seat and mounting frame), sets up in seconds, has a zipped door and most important – it fits in my Toyota Echo!!! Max PS: pictures will be uploaded tonight"

424017,tibbs,2010-01-19 23:40:00,650,Nice Job!  Looks like you had a blast!
424020,johnnyb,2010-01-19 23:47:00,3413,Very nicely done!! That whitie looks HUGE
424028,maksuttt,2010-01-20 00:02:00,21,"2Tibbs: It wasn't a blast day fishing wise... Fish weren't that active. But we definetly had fun on the ice. 2johnnyb: +8Lb, I belive..."
424029,Terry,2010-01-20 00:04:00,14456,looks like a good day to me
424099,Skud,2010-01-20 03:17:00,739,Bigger the group the better chance of someone hooking up with a fish adding to the fun and excitement. Those are some nice fish in your pics. I will be out on Sunday morning again.  I will keep an eye out for you and your new hut.
424105,Paully,2010-01-20 03:22:00,712,Awsome Lakers !  How deep were you fishin?
424108,Leecher,2010-01-20 03:26:00,7832,Beauties     Congrats to all Leechman
424109,basketclam,2010-01-20 03:27:00,115,"I've got a question for you maksuttt, regarding your portable hut.  How do you fit it into the Echo?  Back seat?  Trunk?  I was looking into getting a portable hut and decided against it because of the difficulty of transporting some of the ""portable"" models.  I also happen to drive an Echo."
424148,maksuttt,2010-01-20 11:36:00,21,"Hey Doug, I am not sure about Sunday... Maybe I will be there... Anyway, see you on the ice!  We were fishing +100' I tried shallower water with no success: marked a lot of bait, but no big fish.  2basketclam: If you want to get the Frabill Commando into the Echo, you need to unbolt backs of the rear seats and  the mounting bracket on the floor. 6 bolts - 5 minutes of work... It fits tightly!  Clams won't fit, they have taller plastic sleds.  Max"
