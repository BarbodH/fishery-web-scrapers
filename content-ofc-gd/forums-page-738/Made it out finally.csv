I loaded up the sled to head to my favorite little laker lake but missed my turn off.   I ended up riding for a while because the trail I found myself on was just too much fun plus I need to get myself into shape for the big trip in March. I ended up putting about 110 KMs on the sled today with a lot of the riding on tight and twisty trails like this.    I eventually made my way back to the big lake and decided I would run out to some islands and see if I could find some whitefish. The wind had picked up so I took shelter behind one of the islands and checked depth through the ice with my trusty LX-5. First spot 20', nah lets look a little deeper     second spot 30' and I'm marking fish through the ice. I start up the auger (after changing the plug because I went and flooded it    ) and drill through 3 1/2 feet of clear black ice. Dropped the transducer in the hole and start marking fish, a good sign.  Start my jigging with a 3"" hammered 1/2 & 1/2 williams, got a lot of looks but no takers. So I switched to a different rod with a Badd Boyz jig and crappie tube, as soon as I dropped it down the hole fish started swarming it but wouldn't commit. I eventually tried thumping bottom with it and then slowly raised it about a foot off bottom had a follow and as I moved it up a little bit more the fish drilled it!!!!    After 4 or 5 min I get the fish close. I had visions of a sweet 24"" whitefish but it wasn't to be. Ended up being a pike about 24"". Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.   "
423608,Roy,2010-01-18 18:54:00,13728,Great report Dave. What are your chances of meeting another sled on that particular trail? Is it one of the more traveled ones? Did you return after nightfall?
423616,BillM,2010-01-18 19:30:00,17367,Looks like a fun time Dave!
423624,tightline,2010-01-18 19:57:00,322,did you say 3 and a 1/2 feet of ice!!! Holy Crap you in the arctic???
423640,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-18 20:55:00,10439,"  Uh, yes. Look under my avitar at my location.    It's not one of the more travelled ones and over the course of the trip I saw no other people at all. Just a few ptarmigan, shoulda brought the shotgun. I guess it would be pretty interesting to run into another sled though."

423654,Leecher,2010-01-18 22:06:00,7832,Great report and pics Dave So I guess a manual auger is out of the question in your neck of the woods  Thanks for sharing Jacques
423690,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-18 23:06:00,10439, I know guys that use manual augers but they're all Tundra Hugging Hippies that would rather snowshoe 20K into a lake than take a snowmobile.
423988,splashhopper,2010-01-19 22:32:00,2931,  Tundra hugging Hippies!    good one  man that looks ccccold  there.

Especially in a province the inhabitants keep electing that putz McSquinty!!!!! I get to spend a whole month each fall chasing bows and dollies in Alaska and I like it."
