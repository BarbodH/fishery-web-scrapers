Some great images here of the same structure take from both Lowrance & Humminbird -  http://bbcboards.zeroforum.com/zerothread?...3630&page=1  I myself I""m looking forward to seeing how the downscan and side imaging performs this season out on the big water.  Cheers, G."
423231,aplumma,2010-01-17 15:43:00,6896,Great post thanks for the link I can't wait till april to see what the update brings out on the Lowrance.   Art
423238,Tybo,2010-01-17 16:22:00,1373,"Always think, that brand new technology is great. The one thing is the price. So I tend to buy the technology that the new stuff replaced. I just payed 1400 less on 2 year old technology. I don't get the bragging rights that go along with new. But, At this day an age some newer technology is not better the the old."
423330,aniceguy,2010-01-17 21:19:00,1094,Gavin I just updated my humminbird today with the down scan its pretty sweet looking
423331,Roy,2010-01-17 21:22:00,13728, Which did you buy and where? Good price?  edit: OOPS!
423438,aniceguy,2010-01-18 01:36:00,1094,Roy Radio world had the 997 for sale for 1395...an incridible deal considering most pro staff were at 1600 or something last year...
423591,Fang,2010-01-18 18:16:00,1330,"Hey Ma looks like I need more $ this year, we gotta sell one of the kids!!!  Thanks guys, I've narrowed my search down to the Humminbird 997 (and I'm a long time loya lowrance guy - never owned anything but) and just waiting for the spring fishing show"
423784,Dara,2010-01-19 03:57:00,3052,I'm getting real close to pulling the pin on the HDS 7 with structure scan.  any other opinions or experiences out there?
423840,F7Firecat,2010-01-19 14:06:00,347,love my 997  cant wait to use the down imaging this year!
423998,ecmilley,2010-01-19 23:13:00,2163,i have the hds-8 on the ranger as the main graph and a hummingbird colour unit on the trolling motor while i like both units the hds is the best sonar i have ever seen for target detail can't wait to pick up the structure scan for it
