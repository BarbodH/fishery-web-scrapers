424502,daryl0815,2010-01-21 16:09:00,225,I would likely get shot for suggesting it! the wife isnt quite as avid of a fisherman as I am
424518,Fang,2010-01-21 16:42:00,1330,"fishing yes, just not with the wife!"

424578,Lunker777,2010-01-21 21:24:00,866,"hahah Last year my Ex and I went to the fishing show aswell.... Mr.Mercer casted his crankbait in my lap suggesting I wasnt goin to ""get lucky"" because I brought her there ! hahahah  Well now we arent together, so I guess bringin someone to a fishin show on Valentines day is a bad idea.... or is it ? hahah"
