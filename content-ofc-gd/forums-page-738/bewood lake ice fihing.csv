423699,fishinguypat,2010-01-18 23:46:00,547,few ... i thought i needed to make an auger before time runs out for me. you know  if i should just use minnows or jigs or both? ?
423766,bridge,2010-01-19 03:24:00,54,lots of holes at bellwood you could reopen.  i drilled about 40 the other day.  there isn't any evedence of fish catching around any of them though.
