424403,pike slayer,2010-01-21 06:17:00,1177,"HAHA the sad part is davey there was sober he just aint right, i tell you hes one strange cookie, you kinda want to go drinking with him and at the same time you dont, looking on from a distance is perfect hahaha freaking hilarious! you boys couldnt handle what we are drinking"
424510,cityfisher,2010-01-21 16:15:00,959,Love my underarmour... use it only on the coldest of days when i might be moving alot
424511,Beans,2010-01-21 16:19:00,3339," Wine is the only drink that will warm you up...  Whisky, beer etc. actually will cool you down more but if you drink enough you won't notice or care...  Take it from an ex bartender and ex wino..."
424333,EC1,2010-01-21 01:51:00,930,"Hi All, Good evening!  I find that the last few trips I've had, I would work into a big sweat before I even make it onto the fishing spot, only to sweat some more while drilling into the ice.  Usually I wear a normal t-shirt, 2-3 sweaters over top, and a Goretex Jacket. I pretty much need something that could wick away sweat or have it allow me to regulate my core temps a little bit easier. At this rate, Would I be looking to wear something along the lines of UnderArmour Coldgear or Heatgear?  And Another question, is there an alternative that would be cheaper than Underarmour? On a student budget, I want to get away with every extra penny I can save  Thanks In Advance"
424338,Greencoachdog,2010-01-21 01:57:00,8163,"If you're sweating while out in the cold, stay away from cotton clothing!!! Cotton absorbs moisture!  Polypropylene and wool are your best friends when it comes to sweating out in the cold, both ""wick away"" moisture!"
424340,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-21 01:59:00,2582,"I am not a student...but I am cheap   Because of this I waited years before I spent the $$$ on under armour. Wish I had bought it years ago. Absolutely essential gear as far as I am concerned. You get what you pay for IMO.  But if you still don't wanna pony up for it try wearing just a t shirt under your gortex jacket. Have your other cloths packed. Once you are settled take your t shirt off if it is wet and then throw all your dry warm stuff on. That,s what I did for years and still do. I just have the under armour on under my floater suit. Once I am settled my polar fleece turtleneck goes on with a hooded sweater on over it."
424341,vinnimon,2010-01-21 02:00:00,2593,Its not cheap but worth every penny.I purchased a set of long johns and shirt from fishing world a few years back.They still work like new taking the sweet away.There is no name that I can recall.But they are blue and have a logo with the letter n on the left leg.Money very well spent.
424343,jayess,2010-01-21 02:07:00,187,"Check out MEC's website for an overview on layering, various materials, etc. I find it better to understand why everything works rather than being told what to use:  http://www.mec.ca/Main/articles_main.jsp?F...D=1264039482578  (hopefully that link works)  Personally, I dig merino wool as a base layer. I put a fleece over top of that, a down vest over that, and a goretex jacket on top."

424346,EC1,2010-01-21 02:19:00,930,"Wow, Thanks everyone for the quick replies. I'll read into the websites you guys gave. Looking forward to not sweating like crazy this coming weekend"
424348,trevy727,2010-01-21 02:20:00,351,"Helly Hanson is good stuff too, but, it's probably comparable in price to under armor. do what i do, ask for it for your birthday, christmas and such."
424351,pike slayer,2010-01-21 02:26:00,1177,just go like this!! baffin boots are key!! 
424354,Tybo,2010-01-21 02:36:00,1373,"I use the UA base 3.0 and polartec heavy weight tops and bottoms. I find they work about equal for warmth and moister management. The polartec is a bit cheaper. Then one or two layers of wool. Depending on how cold, A down liner jacket. On top. A gortex 150g ultra thinsulate parka."
424356,Jet,2010-01-21 02:38:00,364,"I have lots of Under Armor, great stuff but yes very pricey - $70 for long johns!  Then I discovered Athletic Works, a line of Under Armor-like designed base layers sold at Walmart. Shirts, long johns are only $12; they even have full base layer suits. I have both the fleece and dri-fit base layers from Athletic Works. After countless trips on the ice and winter steelheading, I have to say it works just as well as my Under Armor. Both are 100% polyester, some with some spandex for stretch. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. They even have hoodies for $20 that are the exact thickness and 100% polyester just like the UA ones I have that cost $80.  In terms of sweating, it's going to happen if you're lugging gear on foot. If I only wore boxers under my floatsuit I'd still be sweating on the 2km walks I do with nearly 100lbs of gear. I find taking a good pace, opening up the jacket and adding more layers later as the best way to combat sweating."
424357,crankbait,2010-01-21 02:40:00,82,If you want a cheap alternative go check out the base layers at mark's work warehouse.
424361,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-21 02:51:00,0,"LOL!  nice pic flames!  underarmour can be pricey.  i bought some just before xmas on cabelas.com in the bargain bin there.... it was the underarmour coldgear shirt for 29.99  the only thing with underarmour is that it works TOO good!  initially i was finding that the sweat was wicking away to the extent that my clothes were getting soaked, then when you stop moving for 2 minutes, you freeze.   i hike with underarmour, a single long sleeved layer on top which will become soaked with sweat, and a hoodie.  when I hit the lake I throw a dry shirt on, my small down coat liner, and my goretex fishing coat and i'm dry, and warm.  the sky is the limit with camping gear though.  you could go into a frenzy ordering stuff from mec for layering.  this equipment works very well, but as you said, some of us are on a budget."
424366,archie_james_c,2010-01-21 03:07:00,618,"Misty Mountain and Rocky hunting gear make mid-weight micro fleece base layers, they retail for 19.99$ a piece....very cheap. Marks also has Dakota micro fleece at a similar price.  Keep your eyes on Cabelas for Polartec 1/4 zip polar-weight fleece sweaters that go onsale alot...they are only actually 40$ regularly. Stay away from their bottoms...they fit like crap.  Ontop of it you can pick up a uninsulated waterproof (also usually very windproof) jacket/shell to keep the wind out. Cabela's has their GORE-TEX MT-050 lineon sale right now...very nice gear for the price.   Also good outer layers would be any winter pants/jacket by Columbia with their Omni-tech water reppelant layer. I paid 180$ for my Columbia Ice-Ice Jacket, and if I wasnt afraid to get it dirty because its my fancy, goin out pickin up the ladies jacket...It would be my GO-TO outer layer....its very light, blocks the wind and has very large pit zips to dump heat when you're puttin on a sweat."
424367,archie_james_c,2010-01-21 03:08:00,618,  This is what happens when you let the Heyden Bible kids come out fishing...LOL...Chris is a strange man...

424389,EC1,2010-01-21 04:06:00,930,"Thanks once again Gentlemen! I think I will take my first look at the Wal-Mart ones, and if they fail(hopefully not), will move onto more expensive gear when I get a job finally this summer."
424390,EC1,2010-01-21 04:07:00,930,And whoever that is in worm dangler's picture is Crazy!!  So are you guys gonna let me in on what's the best booze out on the lake?
424391,archie_james_c,2010-01-21 04:08:00,618,  whatever the other guy brought
424394,douG,2010-01-21 04:20:00,2693,"If you are trudging through deep snow, bushwacking, or hanging off a manual auger all morning, you have to adjust your outer layer so you don't get soaked.  When you get covered in sweat, you must change your inner layers from damp ones to dry ones, or you gonna freeze.  I just remember not to exert myself too much."
424398,BillM,2010-01-21 04:39:00,17367,All I wear is a pair of polypropylene long underwear a matching top and that's about it.  I can't believe how warm my floater suit keeps me.
424400,kevin booth,2010-01-21 05:02:00,57,under armour then 1 layer of fleece and then floater suit mustang.when walking and drilling open up your suit to breath and then when you cool down zip up the floater.
