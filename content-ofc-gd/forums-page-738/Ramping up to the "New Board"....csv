424073,Syn,2010-01-20 02:24:00,519,You can just make your own chat room temporarily for now until they get the official OFC chat working: http://www.tinychat.com/OFC
424080,Roy,2010-01-20 02:42:00,13728,"Hey guys, time out. We are doing the best we can to keep this community as tight as it can be. It really isn't easy but I know that TJ, Rick, Spiel, Dan, Marty, Chris and myself are doing what we can. Please let's try to get along. The chat room accounts for one quarter of one percent of what happens here. It'll be there and it'll work well...you'll just have to trust that it will. Is there anything else?  Dang, I forgot to say...If you don't like how it's working you can always ask for your registration fees back."
424092,Dara,2010-01-20 03:00:00,3052,Boy o Boy...  giving Roy another poke with the stick

424103,Dara,2010-01-20 03:22:00,3052,"So its indefinite?  I always figured a ""month of Sundays"" was about 30-31 weeks"
424104,Dara,2010-01-20 03:22:00,3052,gotta work on the double post feature too
424112,Greencoachdog,2010-01-20 03:36:00,8163,  To a civilized human being... yes.  To an OFC mod... I wouldn't count on it.   They don't have a rubber duckie and a 5 gallon bucket of white lithium grease beside the hot tub just for decoration yanno!
424125,Syn,2010-01-20 04:24:00,519,When its done it will be done. Are you really dying without chat lol? Watch chat get re enabled and everyone forgets to use it.

424322,Greencoachdog,2010-01-21 01:09:00,8163,  You've got to let folks know you're in there by starting a Chat thread on the main board.  I like to start my own chat thread or will reply to someone elses so folks know what to expect before they go in there.
424328,vinnimon,2010-01-21 01:21:00,2593,"I would love to see how my thread will end.Got a few going in on it and whammo gone.It was going good for a while.Note I will only do this when the kids are gone to bed,it can get crazy."
