675715,Roy,2012-03-13 18:38:00,13728,You have til tomorrow the 14th. The rod trade ins are March 16-20.
675717,davey buoy,2012-03-13 18:41:00,5505,"Thanks,I wonder how much?"
675718,BillM,2012-03-13 18:43:00,17367,Depends on how much you buy a new reel for  Anything from $5-$100.
675734,davey buoy,2012-03-13 18:59:00,5505,"Thanks Bill,but when I was there Yesterday they had a bait caster with a computer chip for $799.00. Remembers everything. Low profile .That is almost a little to much in my opinion. But given the windfalls in tournaments, I guess it could make a difference?. Wow."
675739,BillM,2012-03-13 19:06:00,17367, Calais DC   Nice reel!  I bought my reel (Normal Calais) for a steal compared to what they sell it there for new (I think $599 or something crazy like that)
