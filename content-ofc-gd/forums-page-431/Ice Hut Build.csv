668714,ketchenany,2012-02-22 01:24:00,3229,"as I was posting the pics came on my iPad! What an amazing job you did, it will last for years. I had a wood stove in mine with a flat top and our cooking times were in the minutes.  take your time and experiment, you are so handy, maybe a small rack in the stove will solve your cooking problem.  ie get a fire going to heat it up and when the flames die down insert a rack and do your cooking inside the stove.  You can even bake cookies for the kids. a pot roast endless possibilities come to mind. I did veal in a wine sauce in mine!"
668723,Fishnwire,2012-02-22 02:00:00,983,  That's a four month old Jack Russel pup.  She belongs to one of the campers on the river that was fishing near by.  She seemed to really appreciate the shack.

672899,Fishnwire,2012-03-04 03:23:00,983,"Perhaps a bit of a test.  The last 24 hours saw a near foot of snow fall on Sudbury.  It's supposed to get cold the next couple of days and then go to around 6 above.  I'm in the middle of a seven day stretch at the mine, so I hadn't planned on getting to the shack until Wednesday or Thursday.  I'm thinking about taking some days off I have owed and try to get there on Monday.  My buddy (with the plow) is vacationing and won't be around until Wednesday.  I won't know if the Jeep will make it there until it does or it doesn't.  I might have to take the snow-machines there, (I don't think the quad will be any better in the slop than the Rubi) and I've yet to attempt towing the shack with one.  There's a good chance of slush coming up with all this snow.  And I'm not sure how the snow will drift around the shack, or the river.  It's blocked up, but only about 4 inches (2x8's on foamboard).  I've spoken with my vacationing buddy and he says not to worry...his shack is 50 yards from mine and he's confident neither are in any peril.  His shack is little more than a drafty windbreak with a tin-can stove and ceiling...so he has less to worry about than I.  I promised I'd share any problems I encountered, and despite my friend's assurances, I'm pessimistic that I may be rapidly encountering one.  The next few days look full of crazy weather, so I might have some adventures with that big pig.  Pics to come."
672903,Sinker,2012-03-04 04:38:00,8692,"Enjoy the adventure. You won't have any problems. How much ice is under the hut? Pack yourself a good runway before you try moving it, then let 'er rip.  S."

Good Luck, Bob"
672917,skeeter,2012-03-04 11:20:00,1907,"I think he is more worried about it freezing into the slush with it only being 4"" off the ice."
673000,wormdunker,2012-03-04 17:43:00,1711,"You've done a great job!  Thanx for sharing with us.  I'm new to Sudbury, & already thinking of a permanent hut for next season.  Your post has given me several good ideas.  Thanx again"
675390,Fishnwire,2012-03-12 20:04:00,983,"Well the season was a little short...but everything (except maybe the fishing) worked out great.  I arrived at the shack on Wednesday, having to take a snowmachine over the 6 inches of snow covering 4 inches of slush, to find that my insulated plank-blocks had done their job again and my runners were a couple inches above the slop.  Normally I take them out when I'm fishing but I left them in for the night.  It rained HARD all night long and I awoke to see no snow on the ice remaining.  That day it was cold and by the next morning things had hardened up nicely.  I brought the snowmachine back to the landing and took my jeep out.  I jacked the shack up and with a couple of blows from the broad-side of an axe my plank-blocks were free and the shack was on the ice.  Later that day my chum (who owns the marina) showed up and informed me I'd better start packing up.  He figured the next day (Saturday) would have to be the day top get it off the ice.  With a ton of melt-water on the way he anticipated the shore would start to break up and and there would be a lot of water as the level of the river rises and the ice starts breaking away from the shore.  I thought maybe he was jumping the gun a bit...but I needed his help (and permission) to get it up on his property so I let him make the call.  I towed the shack to the shore of his beach-house and then used my push-bar on the front to nudge it right up to the shoreline.  Then I drove my Jeep up on his lawn, pointing my winch at a big pine right near where we wanted the shack to rest.  Using a pulley strapped to the pine I ran my winch cable up to the pulley and back down to the shack.  Then we pulled 'er up.  I had to shovel a bit of snow that built up in the front a couple of times, and I used a roller at one point when the snow was particularly deep, but we got it where we wanted, with no real problems.        I'm going back next weekend to clean out the shack and, assuming the snow is gone, level it off.  I want it a good foot from the ground in case there's a lot of snow early next winter before I can get it back out on the ice.  It's a good thing I let my buddy talk me into moving the shack Saturday afternoon, because by Sunday evening there was about a foot of water right at the exact spot we pulled it up.  There's double digit temperatures on the way, so it wouldn't have gotten any better.  I suppose all that's left to say is, ""Can't wait 'till next year!"""
675393,NAW,2012-03-12 20:10:00,4022,Till next winter eh!  Thanks for the play by play.  I enjoyed this report

675579,Fishnwire,2012-03-13 12:59:00,983," Thank YOU...I'm always happy to hear someone actually enjoyed my ramblings.     You got that right, brother.  This guy has lived his whole life, as his Father and Grandfather before him, right there.  His intuition on the river's mood and likely short-term conditions is rarely off.  Also he has the equipment and know-how to ""get 'er done"", when unexpected problems arise.  I'd never have considered building such a monstrosity if I couldn't count on him...which I always can.  Add to that he's one of my favorite people I know, that his wife is awesome and treats me great, and that his daughters have stolen my heart...and you can see why I enjoy spending time there."
663170,Fishnwire,2012-02-03 12:07:00,983,"  Thanks Bob.  I wanted to put your reflective decals up, but it was raining a little and the shack was wet.  Maybe I'll try to find some metal backings for them like you suggested."
663174,Fishnwire,2012-02-03 12:14:00,983," It's pressure treated, will only get wet from one side, and once I have the wood stove going it will dry out a lot faster than now with a propane heater usually on it's lowest setting.  I might paint it this summer when I re-stain the outside walls.  It's something to think about, so I'll do that.  Thanks."
663191,Billy Bob,2012-02-03 13:09:00,5865," They will stick FOREVER on metal....not sure how long on wood....get some roofing flashing, it's super thin and will hold the reflectors well."

663248,Carp,2012-02-03 16:08:00,1488,"Graet job on the ice hut. We had issues with ours because of the weight and finally sold it last year.  Cherish these moments with your father in-law. Take lots of pics and video. You won't regret it.  I honestly think I'm the only person my father in-law like talking to. He was a quiet man. His kids would greet him, but never actually have a conversation with him. He would wait for me to visit when he had things to do around the house or just for my input. I would fix things as best I could with his very limited tool collection or return with my own arsenal to get the job done right. He called his 3 sons vagabonds. They were a waste of space in his eyes. I can't disagree !!!  He passed away 6 years ago when my wife was 2 weeks away from giving birth to our 3rd child. She is the last of eight grandchildren. Now I'm left to deal with the waste of space by myself. Haven't spoken a word to one of the vagabonds for 4 years. I'll have to sit with them tomorrow evening for a relatives' wedding reception/dinner. Lucky me !  At least if my father in-law was there, I'd have someone at the table worth talking to besides my wife. I miss him dearly.  To top it off, I'll be missing my daughter's first rep hockey playoff game.  "
664846,Fishnwire,2012-02-09 07:09:00,983,"I really should be in bed.  Getting off working a night-shift rotation gave be a pain.  I tried to stay up all day.  I did some running around and got ready for tomorrow...but shortly after I came home at around 2pm and started sitting around I felt like taking a nap.  Seven hours later I woke up, and now (2am) I'm not particularly tired...like I will be in 5 hours when my alarm goes off.  Tomorrow is another big day.  The roofing steel, a bunch of firewood, and the stove are strapped on my trailer and the Jeep and truck are loaded.  I hope to be at the shack by 10am or so (still gotta pick up bait and propane, get the trailer at my Father-in-law's, then drive for over an hour) and we'll start on the stove/stove pipe installation.  Depending on how long that takes (and the wind) we'll bang off the metal for the roof later that day or early the next.  I have a couple little things to do on the inside, a light to install on the outside, and my reflectors to put up...and then I'm pretty much done.  I'm planning on taking it down river to a spot I know (I hope) will be more productive.  Even if the fishing is poor, at least I'll be comfy while not catching fish.  Pics to come.  OK...I'm gonna force myself to go to sleep now."

I'm at home tonight but will be back on the ice tomorrow and plan on spending four nights in a row.  The shack is awesome but the fishing has been somewhat poor.  I'll post some pics and submit a decent update in a week or so."
667268,Jer,2012-02-16 23:56:00,1426,   Your wife must be lovin the new ice shack...
667307,Ron,2012-02-17 01:00:00,1683,"In a week or so?????   What's up with that???? Come on, put the rods down and spend an afternoon in your chair looking at your computer monitor. You owe it to us!  Nah, just kidding. If had the choice between fishing or uploading pictures to create a post for everyone to enjoy, I would take the fishing first too.  Looking forward to the post...  Cheers, Ron..."
668610,Fishnwire,2012-02-21 21:50:00,983,"Well, I spent most of the last two weeks at the hut.  The fishing wasn't fantastic, but the experience was exactly that.  I put the stove in and installed the metal on the roof...I have plans for another shelf or two, but I'm comfortable saying the shack is finished.  I've even got a perfect spot picked out on the shore of my buddy's place where I will summer the shack, so I'm all set.  I guess the first thing I'll mention is that I'm really happy with the insulated planks I made to use to block up the shack.  They are just 10 foot pressure treated 2x8s with high density foam board glued to the bottoms.  I had hoped by placing the insulated side (which doesn't conduct heat) down it would idiot the rate at which they freeze into the ice.  It seems to work pretty well.  I just jack up one side of the shack at a time, slide in a plank, and lower it down.  I left the shack like that for about five days and when I returned I was able to break the seal between them and the ice (once I jacked the shack up of course) by just kicking them with my boot.      The first time I stayed in the shack the wood stove was not installed, so I was heating with propane.  The first thing we did this time was get it into place.  My neighbour built me a collar for the stove pipe out of ducting steel, and I filled it with that fireproof ""Rockwool"" insulation.    I put the stove where I wanted it, measured where the stove pipe hole would need to be and marked it.  Then I pulled the stove out of the way, marked where the collar would go and cut out the ceiling panel.    Then I cut out the insulation in the ceiling.    I cut the hole in the roof about 3/4 inch smaller than the collar and ceiling hole so that I'd have something to screw the collar to.  I remember thinking, ""Holy crap...I just cut a huge hole in my perfectly good roof!""    Then we put the collar in, and with the Old Man pushing up on in from the inside, I got on the roof and put screws down into it, pulling it up into place.    Then the stove pipe...also I re-hung the heat shield which I had to take down because it was in the way of the sabre saw.    Then we put a piece of 1/2 thick cement tile board in the space where the roof was removed, to bring up that space to the level of the rest of the roof.    Finally I put the snow-cap on.    And we were ready to have our first fire in the shack...    I kept the fire fairly low for a while, only putting one or two small pieces of wood at a time in, and I kept checking the collar, heat shield, and wood around them.  Everything was staying cool, and even though it was already too hot in the shack, I loaded the stove right up.  It didn't take long for the temperature in the shack to get ridiculous...quite literally ""like a sauna"".  I noticed though that with the stove rockin' out loud like that, the collar and paneling beside the heat shield started getting alarmingly hot.  The thing is, there's absolutely no need to have that big a fire anyway.  Even with the shack around 30 degrees C the collar and paneling stay cool.  If I ever got the stove glowing red though...I'd probably burn the shack down.  The other problem with the stove is that the top doesn't really get hot enough to cook on.  If you leave a pot or kettle of water on there, it will eventually boil...but it took me about twenty minutes to make a grilled cheese sandwich, and I had to resort to putting the pan right in the stove for the last minute or so to get the bread to brown.  My Father-in-law tried cooking bacon on it one morning.  It made the shack smell great, but even after about a half hour, the bacon was far from crispy.    The next time I went to town I picked up a two-burner propane stove that gets so hot it boils ice-cold water in about three minutes.  I'm real happy with it.  The first thing I did when I got back to the shack after that supply run was remove the (now cool) stove pipe so I could put the metal for the roof on.  We were lucky to get a good day for it...sunny and not too much wind.  It went well.  I've got just the amount of overhang I want and with the addition of some high-temp silicon around the hole for the stove pipe, is water-tight.      So here is the shack in its completed glory!!!      Here's the inside...it's pretty messy.    In case you're wondering, ""Are those your pants on the bunk behind your laptop?""...the answer is, ""Yes.  Yes they are.""  I like ice fishing in my socks and underwear.    The leather chair is the best seat in the house, and it is offered to whomever is the guest of honour.        As I mentioned, the fishing has not been great.  I caught (and released) around a dozen pike in the 1-4 lb range, a bunch of little crappie and perch, and this one pike that was worth taking a pic of.    I also caught one really nice crappie that I had my Father-in-law take a picture of me with, but the photo is beyond terrible.  I even told him to take three...and they are all out of focus and off-frame.  He cannot seem to take a good picture even with it set to auto.  How is that possible?  Well I guess that's the end of my ""Ice Hut Build"" thread.  Thanks to everyone who offered up advice or lent a hand, and thanks for checking out the thread."

662155,Fishnwire,2012-01-31 03:20:00,983,"  Tomorrow IS the day.  I just got off the phone with the tilt-and-load guy.  He's committed to being at the build site for 10 am.  My buddy who owns the marina is expecting me around noon, and has a couple of sleds ready.  My Jeep is loaded with fishing gear and tools and the Father-in-law's truck has his quad in it.  The rest of the materials I need are in the shack, and I pulled the stove and whatever else I don't want bouncing around in there out.  It's ready for transport.  This is finally happening.  We moved the shack from the spot on the lawn we built it onto the driveway where the tilt-and-load can pick it up.  We jacked it up to pull out the milk crates it was resting on, but they were frozen solid to the lawn, so I busted them with a sledge hammer instead.  Using the winch on my Jeep I attached it to the far corner and easily spun the shack (which was resting directly on the lawn, not the snow) about 30 degrees so it was facing the driveway, then put the winch in the middle and pulled it straight out onto the driveway, at one point through about a foot of snow.  Then I slowly backed up, pulling it to the end of the driveway.  When I put my foot on the brake, the shack continued to slide for about six inches.  That's the first time I've moved the completed shack, and it went really well...better than I'd hoped even.  Hopefully things go just as smoothly tomorrow.  I just emptied my memory card on my camera so I'll have lots of room for pics and maybe a vid or two.  I should have something for you guys in a few days.  Wish me luck...with the move and with the fish.  Tomorrow will be the first time this season I wet a line.  I'm looking forward to that almost as much as getting the shack out."

662921,Fishnwire,2012-02-02 17:34:00,983,"Well...I did it.  The shack is on the ice, I fished from it and spent the night.  Pretty much everything went really well.  The day started off not so great...I jumped in the loaded Jeep and headed down the street to pick up bait before heading to my Father-in-law's to meet the tilt-and-load guy.  Part way there I heard a funny, ""tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk"" and then it stopped.  When I hopped out at the bait shop I heard a hissing, felt around on my tire and discovered a puncture.  I immediately jumped back in and flew the two blocks home while I still could.  My spare was at my Dad's and he couldn't bring it to me, so I put a plug in, pumped it up and threw soapy water on it...no bubbles, good to go.  Whew!  I figured if that was the worse thing that happened to me that day, I'd be golden.    I got to my Father-in-law's just before 10 am, the time when the tilt-and-load guy was expected.  I was worried about the long trip on a freshly plugged tire, so I sent my Father-in-law to my Dad's place to pick up the spare, and I waited for the tilt-and-load.  I found myself feeling somewhat nervous, and had to drink a beer to calm myself down.  When the tow-guy got there, he and his partner looked the thing over and said it shouldn't be a problem.  He asked about the weight, and all I said was, ""A lot lighter than most cars you've had up there.""  Then they went to work.    I've never posted a video...I hope it works.  You have to click on it I think.  If you didn't catch it, after the kid shoves the shack so it's square on the deck, he says ""It's pretty light!"" or something like that.  The actual loading went great.  They chained and strapped it down and we were on our way.      I followed behind until we got near the turnoff and then I passed and he followed me the rest of the way.  He told me he had the peddle flat down and we rarely went faster than 80km...on hills we sometimes we barely breaking 60.  The tow-truck guy said it was like towing a parachute.  Each time we came to a section on the highway with a passing lane about a million truckers would give us dirty looks as they blew by.   Going through town.   The speedo   On the highway.  When we got to the marina, the tow guy backed up to the boat launch, and tipped 'er down.      Then he used his winch to ease the shack down the launch.  When it got to a flat spot near the bottom he unhooked it, I paid him the $200 we agreed on (I also shot $20 to his helper) thanked him and he was on his way.  I can think of a lot worse ways I've blown 220 bucks...I consider it money well spent.  I was too busy for the next little while to take any pics.  But I can tell you that I was (sort of) able to tow the shack with my quad.  At the bottom of the ramp where the shack was resting, there was nice packed snow where I could get half-decent traction.  With my chum at the back of the shack using a 2x4 as a pry, the shack slowly started to budge and after a second or two I was towing it (as fast as I'd want to) down the lake.  I stopped to let my buddy and Father-in-law catch up, but once on the near glare-ice of the lake, couldn't get it moving again...my worn, stock tires just spun.  I had to resort to the Jeep, which I had always suspected I would.  It moves the thing no problem.  It even turns OK.  So here is the pic I've been wanting to post for a couple of months now.  The shack ON THE ICE!  x  You'll notice I didn't say the ""completed"" shack on the ice.  I still have a couple of things to do.  The metal for the roof has been ordered, but until I get it up, I'll make due with a tarp.  The stove and stove pipe need to be installed.  I'm waiting on my neighbour who is making me a metal box to feed the pipe through and insulate it from any combustibles.  There's a couple other things too.  I'm hoping to finish during my two weeks off in February.  The shack is quite usable though.  I spend the night in there using propane heat.  I had a digital CO monitor, and it's a good thing, because it went off at one point, and I had to leave the door open for 20 minutes while I sat outside and let it air out.  Once the reading was back to zero I went back in, but turned the heater down and opened the windows up some more.  Things were OK after that, but being able to check and knowing an alarm would sound was comforting.  You'd be taking a big chance without one.  So in addition to getting my shack on the ice and spending time in there...I also did a bit of fishing.  With more work to do on it and this being just the maiden voyage, I situated the shack fairly close to the launch.  The fishing there is hit and miss (at best) with little chance of a walleye bite...just a few crappie and the occasional pike.  That's pretty much what happened.  I got kind of a mixed bag of junk.  It was fun though.  Here is the first fish ever ""hauled"" through a hole in the floor of my shack.    I think I might print it off, frame it and hang it up in the shack.  Like how businesses do that with their first dollar earned.  I didn't get much in the shack.  There was that first perch, a rock-bass...    and then my Father-in-law landed this beauty...    I got a couple of crappie and pike outside the shack.  This crappie was the only one worth getting the camera out for...    I also got some pike...a couple hammer handles and three that were slightly better...like this.    I released everything but one pike that was bleeding bad, one little crappie and that first perch because their air bladders were in their mouths and they wouldn't swim down the hole.  Here's a few random pics...        I've still got a few things to do, so an update or two will yet be forthcoming.  Thanks for checking out my ice hut build."

Looks like you have exactly the same jeep as one of my Co-workers.. And I mean exactly... Color, lift, small winter tires etc.."
662965,Fishnwire,2012-02-02 19:38:00,983,  That Jeep was for sale and I looked at it around the time I bought mine.  Ask your buddy if the previous owner told him that he rolled it...because he did.  Do you work on Maley Drive?  I see it parked there sometimes.

Tough going bout the tire but at least it didn't put a major kink into your plans.  I'm liking the idea of getting your first fish framed and planting it up in the hut. I can see many more photos going up along with it too!  Cheers, Ron..."
663127,sleepjigging,2012-02-03 03:58:00,207,Nice going.  Any concerns of water on the floor rotting the plywood?  Jiggy
663164,Fishnwire,2012-02-03 11:55:00,983,  My Father-in-law is my best friend.  I guess that's kind of weird.  All I know is that seeing him happy makes me happy.
663168,Fishnwire,2012-02-03 12:05:00,983," The tilt-and-load guy said I was about 6 inches away from being over-height.  I will admit only now that when I designed the shack I never thought to check what the maximum was...I'd have been totally screwed if I was over, with nothing short of complete disassemble being the only way to get it down.  I looked into it about a month ago, so I knew I was OK...but even back then I had the walls up and roof on, and would have been in a bad spot."
660493,NAW,2012-01-26 03:58:00,4022,Post #420...  Reminds me of the olden days.
660766,Fishnwire,2012-01-26 21:12:00,983,"  Thanks.  Yeah...that's a can crusher.  And not one from the dollar store.  This one crushes cans, instead of being crushed by cans.  Unlike the shack, its already been tried out a few times."
660769,Fishnwire,2012-01-26 21:17:00,983,  I was going to put a GFCI on the outside and wire the rest through it so they are all protected but was worried about nuisance tripping.  As an electrician I see it all the time.  I might try one later and see how it goes.
660773,Fishnwire,2012-01-26 21:25:00,983,"  The plywood is treated with high quality oil deck stain, including the edges.  I plan on re-staining it this summer and every season or two after that.  I might do something with the interior OSB paneling later too.  I'll keep an eye on things and see what needs to be done.  To be honest I had considered (still am) something like what you suggested...cladding the bottom 6 inches to a foot with some kind of metal sheeting.  It will probably have to wait until next year though."
660774,Fishnwire,2012-01-26 21:27:00,983,  It has been tightened since the pic was taken.  Good eye though.  Thanks.
660792,Lip-ripper,2012-01-26 22:07:00,228,Make sure you have a rigid tow bar to pull it with.  We moved ours on Nipissing once with a tow strap and got a ticket for it... brutal.
660797,Billy Bob,2012-01-26 22:12:00,5865, On the LAKE....you got a friggin TICKET on the LAKE....now that's funny...
660836,Lip-ripper,2012-01-26 23:16:00,228,"Yep, the OPP were sitting on sleds nailing people repositioning their shacks after a big wind storm a few years ago.  They made a mint that day.  Glad you found it amusing!"
660837,Sinker,2012-01-26 23:18:00,8692,"Yep, rigid tow bar is a must."
660841,Fishnwire,2012-01-26 23:23:00,983,"  I wasn't planning on putting one on until next season.  The more I think about it though...  I really should rig something up before I move it very far.  It's only going a couple hundred feet from shore on Tuesday, so I shouldn't have any problems.  Once I want to move it downriver I'll need something to keep it from slamming into the back of my jeep when I stop.  That would suck for both my Jeep and the shack.  I wish I knew how to weld."
660843,Fishnwire,2012-01-26 23:34:00,983,"  I guess it is the law.  There's no law that says I can't tug it a hundred feet at a time using my winch though.  The rigid tow bar was going to happen sooner or later...I guess it'll be sooner, that's all.  Thanks for nothing, clear-thinking OFNers...now I've got another little project to spend time and money on."
660866,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-27 00:39:00,10439," You can do it on the cheap with no welding fishNwire. Grab yourself 2 pieces of 1/4""X2"" flat bar. On one end drill a 1"" hole to fit over your 1"" threaded rod. Mark and drill a hole for a large pin like the ones used for securing the ski bars on the old sled trailers or the pins used to hold your draw bar into your tariler hitch. I would put a big washer between the 2"" bar stock and retaining pin. On the other end drill 2 holes in each bar to line up with the mounting holes on a trailer coupler that will fit your hitch. Bolt it up with 4 bolts and Bob's yer uncle!!! You got a solid hitch with now welding and very little fab time and $$$$ into it. Try and keep the 2"" bars as short as you can to keep their strength. If you have to you can always bend a piece to make a brace at the mid point to stiffen it up. Just bolt it in place with a couple of bolts on each side."
660868,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 00:40:00,5865,SORRY....not laughing at you but at the thought of getting a ticket in the middle of a frozen lake....you got to admit that's funny...  Reminded my of a friend who years ago was going down his street and passed a cop then pulled into his driveway. The cop turned around and gave him a ticket in his own driveway for a expired inspection sticker.....  ...now that's funny too....
660872,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 00:50:00,5865," Only problem I see is for the average guy drilling a 1"" hole through 1/4"" stock...that a big hole in a piece of iron....hope he has a good drill press and some nice bits...."
660879,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-27 01:11:00,10439,"  It can be done fairly easily with a 1"" hole saw, slow rpms on the drill and some oil for lubrication."
660932,Fishnwire,2012-01-27 02:47:00,983," I've been sitting here thinking about something like that.  My Brother-in-law has a crapload of metal stock at his place...I'm gonna go out there and have a look at what he's got and maybe that'll give me some ideas.  I'll also go to Princess Auto and get a trailer tongue and look at that.  Thanks for the ideas.  When you say...""Mark and drill a hole for a large pin like the ones used for securing the ski bars on the old sled trailers""...you mean drill the hole in the threaded rod, right?   I've got a set of Greenlee carbide tipped hole saws that I'll have no problem drilling those holes with. I won't need a press...I've made bigger holes through thicker, harder stuff at work using similar bits and a cordless drill."
660948,moparhawk,2012-01-27 03:26:00,146,I haven't seen any discussion on naming it yet. You must have a name!
660957,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-27 04:08:00,10439,"  Yep, through the threaded rod to keep it from sliding off the rod. You could always just thread on a nylock nut but this will make installation and removal a 2 second chore and you won't need to break out the wrench."
661002,wormdunker,2012-01-27 10:57:00,1711,"I won't be able to visit this week end to view the palace. LOL  Got an important date with the perch on Callandar both Sat & Sun.  R U launching soon?  Got an idea for a name.  ""$$$ Pit""   No disrespect but this palace must cost a fortune.  My plywood/tarp thingy/hut is the cost of 1 of your windows!  HA HA"
661003,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 11:00:00,5865, It been named already....after Kyle's grandmother...forget the name right now but if read back it's in there.
661152,Mikeyfish,2012-01-27 20:15:00,21,"It is great having a friend on the shore to leave your ice hut for the off season. Is your shack going to be finish on the outside so it looks nice in his yard and would it be useable in the summer months for their company, like someplace for the extra kids to stay or a change room for swimmers. I like the size, it is a great family and party size"
661234,Fishnwire,2012-01-28 00:48:00,983,"  Billy Bob is right.  The name is ""Ice-9"" which is a nod to Kurt Vonnegut Jr, but in honour of my Grandmother."
661239,Fishnwire,2012-01-28 01:02:00,983," Tuesday is supposed to be launch day.  My tilt-and-load guy is getting work done on his truck and hopes (but can't be sure) it will be ready.  I guess it would depend on what you consider ""a fortune""...but yeah, I've got a few bucks into it.  It's funny you mention the windows, because I paid $15 total ($5 each) for them.  They're one of the few things I got on the cheap.  Good luck on Callandar."
661240,Fishnwire,2012-01-28 01:03:00,983,  I'm going to try something like that Dave...thanks.
661274,Fishnwire,2012-01-28 02:31:00,983," As far as I'm concerned it already ""looks nice on the outside""...but your point is well taken.  I've considered aluminum or vinyl siding.  It looks great and adds protection.  The outside walls are treated with oil deck stain, but siding makes it look like a little ""building"" and not a ""shack"".  I've thought about using it in the summer, but the layout is specific for ice fishing and other than a sleep camp, I can't see it being of much use.  I have a camp 100 kms or so north, and spend my time in the summer there.  It's a huge effort to get in on snow-machines (I have to break trail with my 79 year old Father-in-law on his pig of a touring sled) and the ice-fishing is not good, so the shack is so somewhere comfy to go in the winter.  Besides, the river is near deserted in the winter, but has too much traffic for my liking in the summer."
656679,Skipper D,2012-01-15 02:48:00,1970,Awsome...............
656694,GYPSY400,2012-01-15 03:21:00,191,"Looks good and comfy.. Can't wait to see some pics of it on the ice!! One suggestion: maybe if you have the time and resources, I would suggest painting the inside with a quick coat of white paint.. It would make it brighter at night.  Sure wish I was on the 5-4 schedule too, to have more time for fishing!! I sometimes envy you guys working underground."
656778,Fishnwire,2012-01-15 14:02:00,983,"  And I'm envious of people who don't have to wait for an unreliably on-time cage ride to bring them to surface at the end of the day.  I've missed appointments or been late for stuff because of it more than once.  I could never go back to 8 hour days, Monday to Friday.  Two days off is not enough...not nearly enough.  Even a three day weekend is too short.  My four day weekends are pretty good, but my five days off are when I can really have some fun.  When I go on vacation I take it a week at a time and schedule it so that it lies between two five day off periods and get 11 to 14 consecutive days off, three times a year.  That part is real nice.  I have a hard time remembering why I even bothered to go to camp (or anywhere) on Saturday, just to have to turn around and come out on Sunday."
656797,Billy Bob,2012-01-15 15:57:00,5865, Normal vacations are really 9 days in a row off any ways.........  When I worked on the railroad I got 6 weeks of vacation.....so come summer months I would take off 1 week (9 days) work the next week (5 days) take off the next week (9 days) work the next week (5 days) and keep doing that for the next 12 weeks or so....it was VERY easy going back to work after having off 9 days knowing you only have to work 5 days and you're off ANOTHER 9 days again and again and again...well you get the picture.....for anyone that can schedule it that way (employer permitting) I HIGHLY recommend trying it next summer....and you will then do it every summer from then on....
656974,GYPSY400,2012-01-16 02:59:00,191,"  Yeah I hear ya.. When I was underground the cage was pretty consistent.. Was only late once ( just happened to be the day I had an appointment)..  My biggest thing is not seeing the SUN!!  I preferred to work night shift during the winter months just to get a few hours of sunshine.  If I could pursue my boss to go to a 5-4 schedule where I work at the shop, that to me would be the ultimate... Not much action on the lakes on wednesday's.!"
656976,GYPSY400,2012-01-16 03:00:00,191,Considering the weather we've had this weekend ( cold).. Launch day must be coming soon?
657146,Fishnwire,2012-01-16 21:43:00,983,"  I've got a tilt-and-load tentatively scheduled for the 23rd...that's a week from today.  I was worried that I might be over the height restriction once on the truck but just now confirmed it won't be a problem.  It's basically ready to go.  The rest of the work can be done on the ice.  No pics...but I put up two eight foot long 16 inch wide shelves and secured the reflective tin behind where the stove will go.  I started wiring it too.  I'm going to do the stationary bench/bunk in the next couple of days and I'll cut the hole for the stove the day before it hits the highway.  The stove and stove pipe will be transported in the back of the truck and installed once on the ice.  Then I'll do the flip-up bench/bunk and a couple more ""accoutrements"" like a flip-down kitchen counter and some more shelves.  I might do an upper bunk later, but I want to use the shack and get a feel for whether or not it would be in the way.  Also, the sooner I get it on the ice, the sooner I can be fish while working.  I'm close...very close."
659230,Tom McCutcheon,2012-01-23 00:12:00,627,SOOOOO....Any updates?  Enquireing minds want to know
659245,Fishnwire,2012-01-23 00:50:00,983,"Since the last update, some shelves are up, the shack is wired, the reflector for behind the stove in installed, and the inside of the door is paneled.  I'll take some pics once I clean up a bit in there...it's a real mess.  I still need to install a tow bar at the front and back so I have somewhere to pull it from. Eventually I want to install a yoke at the back end with a tongue for a trailer hitch, but that will probably have to wait until next year.  I couldn't get what I need for the tow bars on Saturday, so I'm hoping to pick that stuff up tomorrow morning and bang it off by the afternoon.  There's a far amount of friggin' around involved...it'll be easier to show you some pics later than explain it now.  I had planned on moving it this Tuesday...but am thinking next Tuesday will be better.  That way I'll be doing it at the beginning of my days off, and not at the end.  It will give me time to do a few more things too.  Thanks for your interest and I'll try to get some pics up in the next day or two."
659246,wormdunker,2012-01-23 00:52:00,1711,"Kyle couldn't make it to your shop.  I was in our shop all day Sat. to get my gear ready as I just purchased a new ATV, so had to mount/fit my gear to it.  Fished Nip today wasn't too bad  1 perch 11"",1 small wally I released.  Only fished from 1:00 -4:00.  I was still doing final touch ups at 7:00 AM.  Left Sudbury 10:00AM. Arrived Sunset Cove Rd round 1:00.  Good luck on the launch.  Side note.  I'm a crane operator.  Our company has cranes, boom trucks, trailers, floats etc.   I don't set the prices.

659770,chuckymcd,2012-01-24 14:08:00,144,any update? i want to see this beast on the ice!
659809,Tom McCutcheon,2012-01-24 15:34:00,627," I guess you didn't read all of this report from the 22nd.  I had planned on moving it this Tuesday...but am thinking next Tuesday will be better.

659821,chuckymcd,2012-01-24 15:58:00,144, LOL nope didnt read that part thanks tho!
659882,Tom McCutcheon,2012-01-24 18:23:00,627,I too am waiting to see this Finny.
660120,wormdunker,2012-01-25 10:28:00,1711,Bought a 2012 Polaris 500 HO.  Really nice!  Never owned a brand new one.  Got 5 hours on it so far.
660368,Fishnwire,2012-01-25 23:50:00,983,"OK...so here's where I'm at now.  I put up two 16"" x 8' shelves.  I made them to accommodate my hole inserts on the top shelf and my open lap-top on the bottom.    I put up the reflector for behind the stove...    There's a few inches clearance at the bottom and where it's attached to the walls I spaced it out the width of a 1/4 nut.  It should keep the corner from catching fire, and doesn't look too bad, considering it was a piece of scrap I got for nothing.    I still need to cut the hole for the stove but will wait until it's on the ice.  I'll transport the stove in the back of the truck, not in the shack.  I'm done all the wiring.  It's all 120V, but my lighting is LED.  My buddy (another electrician) got me the fixtures at a price that made me not ask where they came from.  There's one at either end of the shack and they are independently controlled.  I also put in a switch and ran a cable for an outside light, which I'll install later.  There are five receptacles on the inside and one on the outside.     If you plug a generator, inverter, or power-pack into any of them (with a male/male cord) the whole shack is live.  I need to mention that OFNer Spouph made good on his intention to stop by and lend a hand.  His presence was of great value on the job, and we had a great discussion and good-spirited difference of opinion, the subject and content of which I'll not bring up here...for fear of getting the thread locked.  Fun time though.  Thanks for your help with the wiring and I'll make sure you get your strippers back, Jeff.      In the second pic you can see I put the framing for a couple more shelves in the corner.  You may also notice my satellite radio boom box...which I ran the cord for the receiver to the outside when I ran my exterior light.  Three bars!  Howard Stern rules.  You can also see on that pic that I framed the door, put all the hardware on it and installed a door stop.  There was a little bit of air getting through the crack around the door before, but now not even light gets through.  It's a good, tight seal.    I finished a 6'2"" permanent bench/bunk, and started the (approx) 5'6"" flip-up bench/bunk.  It started with a (almost) 12 foot 2x4 screwed to the back wall at a top height of 18"".    I had to notch it where the cable is...    Once I framed it (nothing in the middle...might put one in later) I screwed some 1/2 plywood the Old Man had laying around down and here it is.  Sorry about all the stuff in the way.    With only a few more little things to finish inside, we turned our attention to mounting something solid to the skis to pull from.    I took out the last bolt on each ski.  There's still plenty and a ton of glue in there, so I don't think they'll be missed.    Then I reamed out the 1/2 holes to one inch, using a step-shaped spade bit.    Then we cut 1 1/4 inch pipe to fit between the skis, and inserted 1 inch (that's right) threaded rod from one ski, through the pipe, and out the other, then put washers and nuts on.      Then I put one the exact same on the other side.  They'll give me something solid the pull the thing from until I get an actual tow-yoke installed (next year?).  I can also use them as somewhere to put my Jack-all when I need to lift the shack.  The first thing I'll need one for is as a winch point when I lower it down the boat launch, so I'm ready for that now.  I even got my Ice Hut Registration from the MNR in the mail yesterday, so I'll be all nice and legal.  Tuesday should be the day.  I have to work until Sunday, so that will give me Monday to prepare, all day Tuesday for the move, and leave me Wednesday and Thursday to set things up.  Then I have to work five night-shifts followed by 14 days in a row off.  By the end of that time I'll have got some use out of it, I'm sure.  Don't worry.  I'll take a bunch of pics...maybe even try out the video function on my camera.  Thanks for checking in.  F>W"

660469,Twocoda,2012-01-26 03:36:00,4130,ive never built an ice shack before....but ....do you think it might be wise to clad the bottom foot of the exterior plywood to keep it from delaminating with aluminium because when it is being towed out to site...im sure it going to get wet....does the bottom of the door have a treatment to it of some sort to stop it from swelling when the door is closed and sitting in snow or a puddle thats going to be inevitable from tracking it in...  im just thinking out loud....keep up the good work  edit to add..im sure even aluminum facia(6 inch) installed upside down would offer adequate propection but it would have to be caulked on the top
660482,alphaalpha,2012-01-26 03:50:00,475,Been following this thread since the beginning.  It has been quite the build and looks amazing.  Clearly tons of thought and effort put in and I hope it serves you well for many years!   Thanks so much for sharing!  -AA.

654699,Fishnwire,2012-01-08 23:35:00,983," Sinker, I'm sorry if I came off like I didn't appreciate any of the suggestions or advise offered here, by you or anyone else...I did and do appreciate it.  Don't confuse not taking the advise with not appreciating it...they are two different things.  I'm not sure how you ""learned [your] lessons the hard way"" from me, because I don't remember being hard on you.  At least I never intended to be.  Once again, if I came off that way, I'm sorry.  While I can't guarantee I'll make any changes to accommodate the suggestions you offer, I can guarantee I'll appreciate them, and give them consideration.  Even if I ignore them and suffer the consequences, at least others will benefit...as will I on the next build.  Just so we're on the same page...I already understand your feelings about the shack's weight being excessive.  You'll just have to trust me that I can get it where it needs to go.  To anything other than ""it's too heavy"", I'm all ears."
654705,Fishnwire,2012-01-08 23:55:00,983," I might be building a fold down tarp/hut ""thingy"" for next season if Sinker is right.  If he is I'll change the title of the thread to, ""Ice Hut Build...DON""T DO THIS!!!""  Maybe you'll take the advice that I didn't.  Or on the other hand, things might go fine for me and you'll be inspired to build a hut like the 20'x14' (not a typo) that my foreman's nephew is building on the shore of his parent's house.  A 280 square foot shack build by a teenage guy...I wonder if there will be any partying that takes place there."
654712,pics,2012-01-09 00:23:00,1268,"If you weren't in Sudbury I would say yes it's too heavy to be on the ice....but with the cold you guys get, you will be fine....moving it in slush or deep snow may take some work though... Even if it dosen't work out as a hut, it would make an awesome bunkie for a cottager.."
654779,Sinker,2012-01-09 03:46:00,8692,"I meant I learned my lessons about heavy huts the hard way. No hard feeling dude. I think its a great hut, and your going to have some great times in it, with many memories made. After 20 years of having permanent shacks, I've seen pretty much all the gongs that can happen, but they always work out with a bit of hard work and persistence. I've modified my hut over the years from experience, not sitting in my driveway pretending to fish in it. Simple is better.....but this is all just my opinion, and you have every right to yours as well, and I can appreciate that.  I've always lived by the motto, ""work smart, not hard."" Over killing an ice shack for comfort, is not smart IMO, and you will be working hard to move it around and maintaining it. Just wait till you get 2-3ft of snow, with slush under it around that beast. Your jeep is going to be useless, and a 3/4 ton with a plow is going to be under gunned in that kind of snow/slush. Ask me how I know..... lol.  You would be just as cozy in a light hut is all I'm saying, I guess.  Like I said, I'm enjoying the thread, and can't wait to see this bad boy on the ice with some fish slime on the floor!!  Get 'er done!  S."

654821,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-01-09 13:13:00,83,"Nice work fishNwire and thanks for posting your progress. I built a hut back in 93 and went through many of the same planing/design issues you have had. I laid in bed many hours thinking on how I was going to make it. It almost became an obsession. You have built a good solid hut, you might what to use it as a bunkie in the off season. Keep the updates/photos coming. Looking forward to seeing the first fish through the hole."
655150,Fishnwire,2012-01-10 03:59:00,983," I'm going to have to disagree with you a little bit there.  But I guess it would depend on one's definition of ""cozy"".  I already have access to a shack in the very location I plan on putting this one that is not quite as nice as the one in the pics you posted, but not far off.  Like the people in that pic, I spend most of my time in that one with my coat on, and wouldn't dream of being able to take my boots off and put a pair of slippers on.  I'm ""cozy"" compared to what I am when I'm sitting on my pail in front of the shack, but it's not like I get the feeling of having shut out the elements, or that I'm in an ""interior"" space.  I could spend the night there...but my Dad, Father-in-law, wife, or anyone else who wasn't drunk probably wouldn't.  Maybe the actual difference of opinion is how ""cozy"" one needs to be.  Perhaps what you mean to say is that I would be ""cozy enough"" in a light shack.  Maybe your point is that wanting to wear slippers and trick myself into thinking I am in my living-room is entirely unnecessary when ice fishing...and you'd be entirely right.  But that's what I want.  I've wanted it for a long time and decided I'd give it a try.  I know how much friggin' around smaller shacks require, and I'm willing to frig around ten times as much for (what I see as) one hundred times the ""coziness"".  When I'm moving it, I'll probably wish I'd settled for something that is cozy enough, but when I'm sitting it it, I'll be overjoyed that I didn't.  The thing is that like I said, this is the shack I've always wanted.  Unless I try I'll continue to want it.  If it's a huge failure and major PITA then I'll at least know (when I'm building the next one) that what I want is not only unnecessary but unrealistic.  Perhaps ""Ice-9 version 2.0"" will require spikes to hold it in place on days with barely any wind.  Or maybe it will have indoor parking for up to four snowmobiles and an observation deck off the third floor.  All I know is that before I try either of those design options I'm going to try this one.  I'm sincerely thankful for all the feedback from everyone, even the stuff I seemed unreceptive to.  It's given me a lot to think about (seemingly non-stop) and believe me, has weighed heavily on my mind at times.  I know a few people are eager to see how things turn out...not least of all myself.  I'll be man enough to admit if I should have heeded more adice.  Everyone who offered warnings will either get a ""You were right"", or ""What weekend is good for you?""...so there will be no mystery on OFC as to the outcome."

655162,Fishnwire,2012-01-10 04:17:00,983, Gee.  I can't relate to that at all.  Obsessed over an ice shack?  Your wife must have thought you were a weirdo.  Probably your colleagues got sick of hearing about it too.  I'm glad this is just a casual interest for me that isn't something I think about when I should be concentrating on other things.  I guess I'm in no way single-minded when I encounter something that interests me.  Wow.  Perhaps the biggest lie ever told here...and this place is full of fishermen!

If you didn't laugh at that one, you ain't got no sense of humour! ha ha ha   I know a bunch of guys that built a hut similar to yours, they set it up a mere 3 meters from the launch ramp. Had outdoor plumbing and used it for their poker nights! Perfectly legal, no taxes and the Police could not harass them for drinking in a public space because they had a stove for cooking, a place to sleep and a bathroom. There is nothing that says you have to have holes in your floor for it to be an ice hut!  Looking forward to a report on your first catch.  Cheers, Ron..."

I'm sure a bottle or two will be emptied, but it will be from the top a little at a time and not out the bottom all at once.  I like Wiser's and Pepsi in the evening and just about anything (no darks or reds) from a can while the sun is up.

655558,Big Cliff,2012-01-11 12:23:00,6899,"Well, I think it is absolutly wonderful and you have done a fantastic job of desigining and building it. I have had many wonderful ice fishing trips but one that I remember most was an ice challet up on Nippissing. It was -40 out side and I was sitting inside in a t-shirt, in front of a nice fire place, enjoying a hot meal and catching fish.  Good on you for having a dream and doing something about it"
655570,Billy Bob,2012-01-11 13:39:00,5865,BTW.....has there ever been any thought by anyone to build a large ice hut that gets put together in easy to assemble panels once on the ice and then disassemble to remove from the ice at the end of the season....I would think with some pre-engineering this wouldn't be that hard to accomplish...then weight wouldn't be much of a problem....just saying...
655668,fishnsled,2012-01-11 19:46:00,3520," Many years ago, that is how I built my hut. Didn't take up a lot of space when storing it, easy to move, and comfortable. A bunch of nuts and bolts to hold the walls and roof together and a bit of sprayfoam and all was good. Except for when I was the only guy available to take it off at the end of the season. Managed to get one of the others to help out, put it away and was never used again. In the end it became a storage shed."

I slept in a bit because I haven't been able to do so for a while and was at the build site by 10:30 or so.  First we started the heater and then we spent a few minutes clearing the area in front of the shack (where the sawhorse is) of snow.  Then we went to work.  By then end of the day we finished all the interior paneling.  I think it looks awesome and clears the way to begin benches, shelves and wiring.    I hear there are trucks on the ice where this thing is destined so I figure I'll do one bench and one shelf and then get it on the ice.  I can finish the rest of the inside stuff there (using a generator for the power tools) and as an added bonus...can fish while doing so.  It won't be long, gents."
651657,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-29 20:14:00,0,i wouldn't sweat all the critics.  there's always a couple of    OFC'ers who are experts on everything. post pics of all your success this winter just to prove them wrong.
651659,Billy Bob,2011-12-29 20:38:00,5865," Doc, I can't understand why you would say that....first all the critics are giving their advice via through years of experience to help Kyle, its up to him if he chooses to use or not use the suggestions that were posted.....second the OP asked for all forms of comments....this is his quote from his very first post, ""All forms of feedback are encouraged""....third why post something like this if you didn't want to hear the comments."
651673,Fishnwire,2011-12-29 21:20:00,983,"  You're right Bob...In fact if you look back a couple of posts you'll see where I said...  ""Thanks skeeter. I have numerous times encouraged all forms of feedback, but could do without the ""Good luck buddy, you'll need it"" type comments. I suppose in more ways than one, I'm asking for them.""  I guess I'm getting a little tired of repeatedly going over ""What am I thinking!?!"" having explained my particular situation many times.  Also, while everyone appreciates helpful advise, most don't appreciate it so much when the giver comes off like they're saying, ""You're an idiot, and here's why...""  There haven't been too many comments like that, but on both the forums I've posted the thread there have been a few.  I guess I was just in a bad mood and decided to respond to what I saw (rightfully or wrongfully)as one such comment.  No decals in the mail yet, Bob.  The X-mas rush must be holding them up.  I'll let you know though.  Thanks again."
651675,Billy Bob,2011-12-29 21:24:00,5865,I mailed them out on the 19th so I would of thought by now they should of arrived....I guess that's why they call it snail mail...

652566,LesCulpJr,2012-01-02 05:03:00,75,Holy Smokes:) I started skipping through posts about page six in anticipation of seeing a finished hut a the end of the thread!  Your doing a great job! Hut is going to last a hundred years and will be worth every penny with the years of enjoyment you'll get from it:)  Good thread!
652568,sleepjigging,2012-01-02 05:27:00,207,This has turned out to be the MUST READ THREAD.  Thanks. Can't wait to see what the Old Man has done while you're at work.  Jiggy
652578,Fishnwire,2012-01-02 11:17:00,983,"  Yeah...the build (and the thread) have gone on a little longer and become more involved than I had anticipated.  There's not sufficient ice to accommodate a tow vehicle yet so in that sense there's no big rush.  More importantly, I'm enjoying every minute of it.  I'm WAY past the point of no return now...so a completed shack is only a matter of time.  Anyone who bothers reading even the first six pages of this thread deserves seeing pics of a finished shack on the ice.  They're coming...I promise."
652579,Fishnwire,2012-01-02 11:23:00,983," Thanks for checking the thread out.  I wouldn't count on seeing much progress since I started my last rotation at work.  It's nearly impossible for one person to put up ceiling panels alone, plus he said he was feeling crappy for a couple of days.  Hopefully he's better today because I just got off work and will be heading over when the sun comes up."
652765,Ron,2012-01-03 00:07:00,1683,"Iv'e been watching this thread right from teh get go.  Looking for pointers?  Here's one...  Pick yourself up some trailer jacks and place one on each corner. You can then easily jack it up to set blocks underneath so it will not freeze in. This was not my idea but an idea I saw from the huts of BJ Tackle in Bewdley. I got pictures, I will post it later on.  Cheers, Ron..."
652799,aplumma,2012-01-03 01:43:00,6896,I hope that your helper feels better soon. I have no constructive info to give you because of the lack of ice down here. When it is all said and done the joy of the build should be cherished as much as the time spent using it.   Art
652801,Fishnwire,2012-01-03 02:01:00,983,"  I'm always looking for pointers...  I've got a two-ton ""jack-all"" that I plan on using to get my blocks in and out.  I might look at installing trailer jacks in the future, but not this year.  I'd like to get a look at those pics if you find them."
652802,Fishnwire,2012-01-03 02:05:00,983,  He was feeling good enough today to finish off the ceiling with me.  Update to follow.  I can't begin to describe the enjoyment I've got from this little project.  Lots of fun...I hope that comes through in the thread.
652807,Fishnwire,2012-01-03 02:40:00,983,"Update...Jan 1  We finished paneling the roof.  It went well and I'm happy with how it looks.  The seams are perfect.    I was planning on using something other than OSB to panel the walls but after seeing it on the ceiling I'm going to use it on the walls.  We went and picked up what we'll need and put it in the shack.    You may notice in that pic that we also foamed the gaps around the two sliding windows today.  I had bought two cans but only needed part of one so I used the rest in the corners between the nailers.  The place is nicely insulated and (with the hole covers temporarily screwed down) draft free.  I've got this heater...    ...and ran it on high for about 20 minutes.  I had to turn it down to low after a while because it was getting too hot in there.  I've got one of those wireless outside/inside temperature gauges set up on the shack and noticed this...    A thirty degree difference in temperature between the outside and inside.  I'm thinking I'll be happy I've got those sliding windows once the wood stove is rockin'.  I might need the door open too.  That'll be it for a couple of days.  There's a ton of work at the mine my boss is panicking to get done so he's letting us work as much OT as we want.  With Christmas just over and a few things such as metal roofing yet to purchase, I can't turn down the opportunity to work.  Building a switchroom 5000 feet underground isn't as much fun as building an ice shack, but it pays a little better."
652853,Billy Bob,2012-01-03 10:32:00,5865,"Looking at all the insulation you have installed in the Ice Resort I knew you would have no problem heating that puppy....that wood stove is going to drive you out unless you learn to regulate it by air flow into the stove. I have a wood stove in my living room and it heats the whole house without a problem....but when I first got it and I was a green horn on operating it, well we many times had several window open to bring the temps back down below 75 degrees.  I'm thinking all you will need is a zippo lighter for heat...."
654449,Fishnwire,2012-01-07 23:45:00,983,"A little update...Jan 8  I had only one day off this week, Thursday.  I had a few other things to do so didn't get to the build until after noon.  We started paneling the walls with 1/4 inch OSB.  I had previously planned on using something a lot nicer, like the ""Alpine White Oak"" interior paneling I saw at Lowe's...but it's $20 a sheet and 1/4 OSB is about $6.  If I was making this decision near the beginning of the build instead of near the end, I'd almost certainly have gone with the more expensive option, but with the budget beginning to stretch thin, I decided to ""cheap out"".  I think it looks OK.  Pretty good even.  Here's the first wall two-thirds completed...    And here it is finished.  There's a quartz light on in the shack...just in case you think it's on fire.    One down, three to go.  By the time we finished that one the Old Man wanted to call it a day so I had a beer with him inside and then went back out and put the hole covers in.  They are 3/4 plywood with two inch wide strips for the hinges.  They lay flat and flush and hinge up out of the way.   I still need to put deadbolts on but I don't won't to be tripping over them and their saddles while I'm still working in there.  I think I'll glue some circles made out of my left-over insulation to the bottoms too.      I've got at least two more days of high voltage construction underground, so the shack will have to wait.  I should be able to finish the paneling on my next days off, depending on how many of them I get.  Thanks for checking in."
654464,FishAbout,2012-01-08 00:48:00,106,"How big are the holes in the hut, you want them a fair bit bigger then your auger.  When you need to re open the holes after they freeze up you don't always drill straight."
654476,Fishnwire,2012-01-08 01:43:00,983," They are a little over ten inches, and my auger is eight.  It's funny you mention it because right before I was about to cut the first one I had a ""brain-fart"" and became unsure whether the Jiffy is eight or ten inch.  I had to dig it out to be sure.  I'll probably just shift it over a few feet and drill fresh holes when the old ones freeze up.  I have a ""no re-drills"" policy I've enforced on that Jiffy since I got it and the blades cut as well as they did when I bought it three years ago.  It has those ""stealth"" blades, but I still don't take any chances.  I noticed that my Dad and I had identical hand augers that he would sharpen at the start of each year and his would cut better for longer than mine.  He drilled more holes than me but only fresh ones, so now that's what I do...hand or power auger."
654483,FishAbout,2012-01-08 01:56:00,106,"I have the jiffy with the stealth blades. Been reopening holes for the last 3 winters with it and still the first set of blades on it.  Doesn't care that you are opening old holes, cuts through no problem. Most auger you shouldn't but the jiffy's you can and not hurt them.  You meet find that it is a lot of work to move the hut a few feet if you have snow and slush."
654492,Fishnwire,2012-01-08 02:39:00,983," If there is snow and slush and the shack has been sitting in the same place long enough for the holes under it to freeze...that's a good time to move it and re-block it.  I have 2x8s with one inch HD foam board on the bottom (I'm hoping this will idiot them sinking/freezing into ice...worth a try anyway) for when the shack is being used, and am planning on making bigger blocks to get it a good eight inches to a foot off the ice when I'm not there.  I've got a  two ton ""jack-all"" so lifting/shifting it a foot or two shouldn't (?) be too hard, and worth the effort if it minimizes the risk of freeze-in.  That's good to know about the Jiffy blades.  I might be less of a ""re-drill Nazi"" learning that.  I know it does my hand auger no favours...especially when I get to the uneven ice at the bottom and resort to backing the blade up and ramming it repeatedly to get it through.  I've seen a hand auger advertized as being made to re-drill holes, but that's not the kind I have."
654504,sleepjigging,2012-01-08 03:38:00,207,"I think the foam insulation looked better than OSB. We should all contribute Sunshine Girl posters to help with the wall paper.   Even my wife has started to read your epic thread. She said 2 things that I found funny. 1. That's something my dad would build. -- real high praise. Her old man is a construction worker. 2. She's looking forward to reading about ""the maiden voyage of the Titanic.""  Jiggy"

I'm just going to keep my mouth shut for now, though. I learned my lessons the hard way, and after offering some sound advice, that you don't want to take, I'll let you figure it out the same way  I'm enjoying the thread, and can't wait to see this beast on the ice!

The ceiling was made higher than need be for that exact reason.  After the roof is on, insulated and paneled...There will be about 7' 4"" clearance.  It's gonna be shelves, shelves, shelves.  Maybe even an upper sleeping bunk some day."

Didn't get any work done on the shack since Friday.  She released me from my duties today just after noon and I went with my Father-in-law to pick up the stove at my Brother-in-law's, then we bought the lumber for the roof and the rest of the insulation for the walls.  Now I'm back at home making the lasagne I promised I would for my wife.  It's back to work tomorrow...four 12 hour shifts.  Then we're right on top of Christmas so I don't know how much progress I'll make before the new year.  Trust me, if I had the time, I'd be working on the shack right now."
649415,GYPSY400,2011-12-18 23:29:00,191,  Great progress on the hut.. I live in Sudbury too ... What lake are you planning to put  the hut out on??
649416,Fishnwire,2011-12-18 23:31:00,983,  I'll PM you.
649572,bubbles,2011-12-19 20:02:00,591, Becasue you don't want 300 OFNers showing up to use the palace every weekend?
649605,tb4me,2011-12-19 21:09:00,3295,Ahh but why not..There will be enough room!
649613,Billy Bob,2011-12-19 21:25:00,5865," Kyle, just make sure you invite everyone up for set up and take down day....but don't let it out of the bag....just say you're having a meet and greet day..."
649653,Fishnwire,2011-12-19 23:41:00,983,"Yeah...I'm not crazy about revealing the exact location on an open public forum.  At least not this one.    I'm only PMing a somewhat vague location too.  You never know, right?  I'd definitely extend an invitation to anyone who has access to a tilt and load tow truck.  There are a couple of trailers I've been offered use of, but both would be a VERY tight squeeze, and getting the shack on and off of either of them would be a lot bigger hassle than just having it winched up a tilted bed and dropped easily where I please.  I may hire one when the time comes.  Tell you what folks...I've got a good chunk of this coming February off.  If anyone is seriously interested in coming out for a couple days, PM me.  If more than one person wants in, I'll take whomever lives furthest away.  We can work out details later, but if someone is serious...I am too."
649656,woodenboater,2011-12-19 23:46:00,2277,maybe a Sikorsky would be able to drop that down in the right spot for ya nice and smooth. would give away your location however
649668,moparhawk,2011-12-20 00:13:00,146,Hey Fish I've been following the build from oh about a thousand miles away and have to say its awesome. I'm going to toast a cold one at you at completion. Keep up the good work.
649738,ctdd2006,2011-12-20 03:35:00,531,....ask around.  Our local tow truck operator does it for fifty cash.  Well worth it in my eyes.  Great build!
650873,Fishnwire,2011-12-25 03:20:00,983,"Merry Christmas!  Just a little update.  I was supposed to be off work on Friday but my boss offered my the shift so I went in.  I did a bit of work in the morning and then went to surface for a free Chinese-food lunch, then I performed a magic trick...making myself disappear...so it was an easy day.  The only problem was that when I called my Father-in-law on Thursday night to tell him I couldn't work on the shack, he told me my Mother-in-law ordered it moved from the driveway and onto the lawn, so X-mas visitors would have somewhere to park.  I wasn't really looking forward to it.  We had to move it down the driveway about 10 feet and then over another 20 feet or so onto the lawn.  The driveway is gravel and there's a recently poured curb and all the dirt excavated when forming it between the driveway and lawn.  The thing is, it went really well.  I was thinking about Billy Bob and his eagerness to see video of the shack ""on the move"", but was concentrating on what I had to do and didn't take any pics.  Sorry Bob.  Next time.  We just jacked up the front and took the milk crates out from the corners, then slid 2x10 sixteen foot planks under the skis, then jacked up the back and took out those milk crates.    Then we put lanyards around the hut and using the winch on my jeep, skidded the shack along the planks.  When the shack got far enough down the driveway to where we could move it laterally (there was a tree in the way) we jacked up the hut, pulled the planks, put the crates back, and put the planks going the other way.  Using my winch with my Jeep parked on the neighbour's driveway, we slid the hut down those planks and onto two others, until it was where we wanted it.  Then  we jacked it up, pulled the planks, put the crates in and dropped 'er down.  Easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy, George and Weezy.  Here it is resting on the new site just before I took the planks out.    I was a little ticked off about having to waste part of my day moving the hut, knowing when I was done I'd be no closer to having a finished shack.  However, when I got there I was amazed to see the Old Man had finished the roof by himself.  He said he just plugged away at it a couple hours at a time throughout the week.  It's awesome.  Check it...    Now I've got four walls and a roof.  It's a shack now, and not just a pile of materials waiting to be a shack.  I'm pumped.  I had thought if I was lucky my Father-in-law would have done a little of the wall insulation that still needs doing, but when I saw he'd finished the whole roof I was blown away.  He was up and down on a ladder who knows how many times, and getting the 1/2 ply sheets almost nine feet up by himself must have been no easy task.  Like all good partners...the times he does stuff like that make up for the times he does stuff that makes me want to choke him.  Here's a pic of the stove I got from my Brother-in-law for free...    It's pretty heavy, but shouldn't burn out any time soon.  The fire bricks on the sides are mostly intact but the ones on the bottom are missing.  I'll replace them.  I found an old road sign my Father-in-law ""acquired"" behind his shed which I think I'll use to rest the stove on.  Then after the paneling is up I'll put roofing metal in the corner behind where the stove and pipe will go.  I'll screw it down with spacers between the wall and metal, so a little air gets back there.  A final pic for the update which I'm happy to show is this...    Just after we finished moving the shack it started to snow in Sudbury and hasn't stopped since.  We're going to have a white X-mas after all.  Considering the ice is still very thin, the weight of the snow is probably going to cause some major slush...the forecast is for mild weather so that slush won't be stiffening up anytime soon. Still, I'm happy I'll get to see the white stuff on X-mas day.  Merry Christmas to everyone, and thanks again for checking out my build thread."
650879,gaspumper,2011-12-25 04:10:00,393,"Going to be a nice shack,but a ""flat roof""."
650885,Fishnwire,2011-12-25 04:30:00,983,"  I'm going to clad it with metal roofing which I may put a slight pitch to.  Even if I don't, most of the snow is going to blow off...it standing out in the open on the lake.  And if a little water pools on the metal roofing...well, that's what metal roofing is for.  If I'd have pitched it, it would have meant sloping the east and west walls, instead of making simple square ones.  Plus eight foot sheets of plywood, insulation and paneling wouldn't have been big enough for the roof/ceiling.  Basically sloping the roof would have been a huge hassle.  What is your concern?  Snow load, water run-off, or esthetics?"
650891,Sinker,2011-12-25 05:33:00,8692,"A flat roof, with OSB on it.....hmmmm.  I think your going to regret not sloping the roof. Maybe not right now, but a few years down the  road it will come back and bite  ya!  Merry Christmas!  S."
650893,Fishnwire,2011-12-25 05:51:00,983,The roof is made of 1/2 ply which will be covered in metal roofing....the paneling for the ceiling will be 1/4 OSB.
651098,Fish Farmer,2011-12-27 02:24:00,2234,"I've never seen a hut that heavy, that wood stove must weight 300 LBs. Flat roof,freezing rain then snow. Your going to need a bombardier to pull it. I wish you luck. You've did a lot of nice work, I hope you don't run into problems."
651133,Big Cliff,2011-12-27 12:11:00,6899,"I have a flat (well, almost flat) roof on my boat house and there is less snow build up on it than any of the sloped roofs. Any wind and it just drifts the snow off. I ended up putting that rolled asphault stuff on mine. 4 years later and still no leaks or problems. You won't have any problems!"
651138,Fishnwire,2011-12-27 13:44:00,983," If the stove weighs at least 300 Lbs, then I'm impressed that my 79 year old Father-in-law was able to lift his end up to his waist when we put it in the truck.  I guess the old guy's pacemaker hasn't zapped him of all his strength.  Although another buddy I know owns an old Bombardier which I could borrow, I have a Jeep Rubicon with 6 inches of after-market lift, good winter tires, and a winch.  It also has a holder for the two ton jackall I go no where with out.  If that won't do the trick, my buddy on the river has a 3/4 ton diesel with a plow.  If you check out the thread, I've mentioned this about a million times.  I've also mentioned that nobody said it would be easy, and further stated if it was easy, then everyone would do it.  If you want a shack you can pull out by hand, and never be able to take you boots off in...that's the shack YOU should build.  I want one I can close the door to and feel like I'm inside.  I know the building, transport, and maneuvering of such a shack requires a lot of (what some might consider unnecessary) effort, but I'm OK with that.  As I've also stated more than once, I promise that regardless of whether the shack is a huge success or great disaster, you'll all know about it.  Any huge mistakes (or minor) I made I'll cop to, as I wouldn't want others to make them same.  I'm off to do guess what?..."
651351,Fishnwire,2011-12-28 12:34:00,983,"Quick update...  I hope everyone had as merry a Christmas as I did.  Lots of family around and too much to eat and drink.  That's what I'm talkin' about.  So the shack is now FULLY INSULATED!!!  I did the floor with 3 inch HD foam before I flipped it over.  We finished the walls with 2 inch a couple days ago.  North wall...    West wall...    South wall...    And the east wall with the door hung...    We made the door when we built the wall so only had to hang it.  I had to touch up one spot with the belt sander but now have a snug fit that doesn't stick.  I put a hasp on so we can leave our stuff in there at the end of the day and lock it up.  I did the ceiling with the same 3 inch stuff I used for the floor.  I've got 1/4 OSB I'm going to panel it with but want to cut the hole for the stove pipe first.  The problem is that it's 20 below with a windchill of minus 33, so I'm not eager to get on the roof of that thing with a sabre saw, or start playing with stove pipe.  I did just get off work, so a warm bed appeals to me more.  We'll see how the Old Man is feeling and go from there...  Thanks for checking in."
651376,skeeter,2011-12-28 15:13:00,1907,"Fishnwire, the hut looks good. It's your hut and you are the one it has to satisfy . Build it the way you want. Everyone can give you their advise and the reason for their advise, but you are the judge. Here's my advise. On simcoe you NEVER leave ANYTHING in the hut, because it WILL get stolen. NEVER lock the door cause the idiots will kick in the door to see what you are hiding. I left 3 BROKEN lures hanging from the roof in mine and the idiots stole them.  Every year there are posts about somebody who lost every thing cause they thought it was safe to leave the hut locked. This year will be no different.  Keep up the good work, we want to see the end result!!"
651422,Fishnwire,2011-12-28 18:19:00,983," Thanks skeeter.  I have numerous times encouraged all forms of feedback, but could do without the ""Good luck buddy, you'll need it"" type comments.  I suppose in more ways than one, I'm asking for them.  I don't plan on leaving anything I can't afford to lose in the shack when I'm not there.  We'll drive our vehicles right there so it's not a big hassle to pack stuff in and out.  I will say though that you and I have not had similar experiences with ice hut security.  Last year I forgot my camera in an unlocked hut very close to where I plan on putting mine and it was still there a week later.  My buddy left his rods and a few tackle boxes there pretty much all season and had no problems.  I don't plan on taking any chances though...your advise is sound.  Thanks again...I'll be happy to show the end results when I get there."

649083,woodenboater,2011-12-17 03:45:00,2277,Can you tell me again why the holes are along the walls and not in the middle ?  Things are moving really fast now and it won't be long before you're hauling that on the lake and cutting holes and pulling fish through the holes ! Looking great so far.
649099,BassAsin,2011-12-17 07:15:00,806,"the fold out bed idea, i was just joking because there were some similar in the shack i had sold you.   As for the back lakes, maybe one or two but there are a few that i vowed to the people that taught/showed/took me into them i would never say a word.  that shack is comin along quite well. in your most recent pics the one where the 3rd wall is erect it looks as though the roof on your garage is actually on the shack."
649108,Billy Bob,2011-12-17 10:18:00,5865,I think we need a contest to name this Ice Resort.......maybe the person who's name you pick could cut the ceremony ribbon once it's in place on solid ice...

649121,GBW,2011-12-17 14:19:00,8460,it's looking great!
649127,Fishnwire,2011-12-17 15:09:00,983,"  I spent a couple hours after the floor was done with a chalk line, measuring tape, magic marker, mock bench and jigging rod trying different layouts out.  Also I've been in lots of huts with different layouts and I knew what I liked and what I haven't.  Several sleepless hours in bed were spent agonizing over things like hole placement...what I'm saying is that a lot of thought went into just where the holes would go.  The three in a row (each about two feet apart) along north wall are situated so that anglers seated at the bench along the south wall (about half of which will be permanent and the other half will flip up making room for a table and chair(s)) can jig from them and watch outside lines through the long window.  The space down the middle acts as a walkway.  The holes may seem a little far from the seats, but they are actually just about right.  I'd have liked them maybe 6 inches closer but the runners are in the way.  To move them to the insides of the runners would have created holes practically between one's feet.  I'd rather have to stretch out a little to jig than be all cramped up the whole time.  If the holes were in the middle, you'd have to walk along the sides of the hut to get from front to back.  I'm going to have shelves and stuff hanging on the walls...I've been in a hut where you had to scoot along the inside wall to move around and we were always knocking stuff off the walls or from shelves with our bulky cold-weather gear.  You may have to step over a rod or two when you are at the back of the hut and blast through it to the door when you see a tip-up flag pop...but you won't risk a wet boot or broken ankle from holes in the middle of the floor...which, as far as I'm concerned, there is no worse place to put them.  It's all about preference though.  If you're laying out the cash, you get to have your preferences...or at least be the one responsible for screwing things up and making it so no one has their preferences.  I'm fairly certain I haven't made too many HUGE mistakes yet...but if the hole placement was one of them, everyone here will learn about it by about the end of January."
649134,Fishnwire,2011-12-17 15:24:00,983,"  First off...at this rate I'm not sure Sudbury will see solid ice before about the middle of January.  Secondly, the shack already has a name.  Ice9.  It's a nod to writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr...who my buddy Jamz and I were somewhat obsessed with as younger men.  Also, my grandmother recently passed.  We called her ""Nain"" (pronounced nine) which is the Welsh word for grandmother.  She left each of her grandchildren a little something with strict instructions that it be used for pure frivolity, and not stuff like bills or household obligations...and also with the understanding that it goes to us, and not our spouses.    My wife is pretty cool and lets me do my thing most of the time...she probably wouldn't have kicked up too big a fuss either way...but because of my Nain's thoughtful gift the wife can say nothing."
649135,Billy Bob,2011-12-17 15:29:00,5865,Nice......your gramdmother  paid for the Ice Resort....we need many more grandmother's like that in this world....  She was a smart and kind lady...
649151,woodenboater,2011-12-17 16:09:00,2277," Ahh, never thought of that. You've definitely given it some serious thought about what works and doesn't and this will add to the pleasure of using your hut when the ice is thick enough. Would be cool to have a small solar panel so you can run some patio lights along the outside"
649193,Fishnwire,2011-12-17 20:06:00,983,"  You have no idea how right you are.  The only thing you didn't get quite right is that we need more PEOPLE like her in this world.  I had always thought she treated me special because I was her grandchild (which I'm sure she did) but found out talking to those who knew her that she treated everyone special.  She had nothing but kind words even for those who absolutely didn't deserve them.  She lived almost her whole life married to an avid fisherman and raised two of her own.  Several of her grandchildren enjoy the sport but the passion for it her husband had that I inherited was something she always recognized and indulged.  She'd be happy knowing what became of her gift.  Thanks for getting me to take a few moments to really think about her, Bob.  I'll try to do that more often."
649283,Fishnwire,2011-12-18 04:12:00,983," It's possible you're joking...but I'm going to wire the hut (I am an electrician after all) and bring a generator.  I'll have a couple of batteries, a charger and an inverter.  I'll run the generator until the batteries are topped up and then turn it off and use the inverter.  When the batteries get low, I'll fire up the genny until they're good.  I figured on a four foot dual lamp, T-8 florescent fixture for the inside, and some kind of flood light on the outside to illuminate the area in front of the viewing window.  If I can get my hands on some cheap solar garden lights I'll put a couple on top so even when I'm not there the drunken snowmobilers will see it a mile away.  Regardless I'm going to cover the thing in reflectors."
649284,danbouck,2011-12-18 04:14:00,4380, LED light strips would be your best friend
649292,woodenboater,2011-12-18 05:06:00,2277,"ha ha, half joking but it would definitely be something I would probably do just to be different. I'd go LED though instead of fluorescent, easier on the battery but not same light quality though which could be important for those long sessions. Figure a 15w panel would top up a battery (if it was running LEDs) and then take the whole thing with you when yer done for the day/s.  Maybe add some 3m reflective tape or driveway markers to the outside corners as well as solar lights to keep sledders from running into your ice home.  Hope you take tons of photos when this thing is set up !"
649306,Billy Bob,2011-12-18 12:15:00,5865,"fishNwire,  The more I read about this Ice Resort the more I would like to see you move it and then see it again once it's in full operation and of course removal come March...it's going to be the standard from now on how ice huts should be built....everything else on the ice will only ice shacks in comparison... I just wish you were closer to me... So more pictures...and somehow find a video camera....many digit cameras have this option..."
649307,Roy,2011-12-18 12:20:00,13728,I think we should all chip in and get Brandon Broderick up there to film the documentary.
649312,skeeter,2011-12-18 12:48:00,1907,"The hut is starting to look good.  Reflective 3m tape is a good idea, when you put it on put it at waist level so that head lights will catch it.Also staple it to the hut so the cold doesn't lift it. I also put solar moonrays on my hut, bought from Dollarama. The one's that mount to a wall. They work great and they are high enough that a ladder or standing up on a seat of an atv/sled would be needed if someone wanted them more then I do. If they steal them I'm out $4.52"
649317,Skipper D,2011-12-18 13:01:00,1970,  Make it a twelve month running series and maybe call it 	 QUEST FOR HARD WATER  	.
649338,Billy Bob,2011-12-18 14:19:00,5865," OH GOD....I can see it now....""Canadian's Gone Wild on Ice""....hey, why not, they have the stupid ""Big Shrimpin"" and ""Sons of Guns"" still on the History Channel....  Every week a different ice hut would be visited to see how men of the Great White North cope when the fish are not biting....  I guarantee you it would be a better show then ""Big Shrimpin"" where each week the brine machine breaks down and they can't freeze the shrimp..."
649351,Fishnwire,2011-12-18 15:59:00,983,"  I'm not a big fan of them.  I think they look sort of ""tacky"".  To each their own, right?"
649358,Fishnwire,2011-12-18 16:20:00,983," The florescent fixture I'm looking at is 32W and only costs about $50.  I've seen some amazing 120 V LED fixtures around that use less watts and give better light, but the price is prohibitive.  I don't think I'll bother with a solar panel because I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving it set up when I'm not there.  I'm also not planning on leaving the batteries, charger or inverter (we drive our trucks right to the hut) so it's easier to just bring charged batteries and have the generator for when they need to be topped up.  It's not like I can count on getting the power I would need for an all-nighter from a solar panel set out during a winter's day, so I'd need the generator regardless.  There will be no shortage of reflectors affixed to this shack.  Of that I can assure you.  I will absolutely take lots of photos when this thing is set up, and a bunch between now and then."
649362,Fishnwire,2011-12-18 16:34:00,983," First of all Bob, make no mistake...I'm building an ice SHACK.  Secondly, I know you're eager to see photos/video of me struggling to overcome obstacles and encountering near (or outright) catastrophe...and I'll do my best to capture that and promise to share it here with everyone...I only worry you may be a little disappointed.  Then again...I'm worried even more that you won't.  Regardless, my camera does have video capability so I'll try taking some if something interesting comes up.  If you were closer to me, I'd invite you to come check things out for yourself, and maybe lend a hand when an extra one (or two) is required.

648772,Fishnwire,2011-12-16 00:17:00,983,"We got a fair bit done today, but I didn't take as many pics as I normally do.  My Father-in-law was not feeling well so he took the morning off and rested.  I got so into working alone and not stopping to confer with a partner that I forgot to document things with the camera.  I started by cutting out the jigging holes.  There's going to be four...three on one side and one on the other.  I put them as close to the joists as I could and still have room to work the sabre saw.  I actually used a jigsaw for most of the hole, using the sabre saw only for the tight sections.  I tested them with the pails I'm using as inserts and was happy, so I began fitting insulation.  I used the jigsaw to cut the insulation...it didn't make nice edges, so I cleaned them up using this baby here...    It's an electric knife from my kitchen.  I got it when my grandmother gave up her apartment a few years ago and have almost never used it.  It was great for shaving off a little bit at a time to get a good fit.  I think I dulled up the blades or burnt out the motor a bit...because by the time I was done it wasn't working so great.  Oh well.  The sections that had jigging holes were a little more effort.  I fitted them in and them laid down in the mud and traced the edge of the hole in the floor board.  Then I popped them out and used the jigsaw the cut the hole.  It sounds easy...and by the fourth one it was, but it took some friggin' around to figure it all out.        It took a while and generated a fair bit of mess, but I finished the fitting the insulation and cutting the four holes.  I was ready to skin the bottom with 3/8s ply.  By this time my Father-in-law was feeling better (or just left out) and came out to help.      I cut the ply to size, laid it down and (on the sections with jigging holes) marked them from the bottom.  I used the jigsaw to cut the holes and then screwed 'em down.  We finished just at dusk, so I needed the flash for the last pics.      Then with the help of the my Father-in-law's neighbour (who I happened to attend high-school with) we flipped 'er back over.  I stuck the inserts in and they all fit like gloves.  Check out the Old Man with a jigging rod pretending to fish.  We were both feeling pretty stoked.    Tomorrow, it's all about a massive erection...the walls go up.  Finally I will have something resembling an actual edifice.  I'm pumped to see that and take a few pics to post here.  Then the roof goes on and once that happens I'll have a dry, heat-able space to finish most of the work.  I'm still eager for suggestions, questions, or criticisms...thanks for those and thanks for checking out this episode of ""Ice Hut Build""."

648873,Billy Bob,2011-12-16 12:40:00,5865," I have never been in a ice hut that had the floor insulated...as a matter of fact...all the ice huts that I have been in were't much more then 1/4 plywood sided shacks with 1/2"" or so insulation board glued to the inside of the walls and ceiling with a small propane heater....and they were very warm to fish in...they didn't have satellite TV, a Lazy Boy recliner or a wet bar with a full kitchen but we did catch some fish in them...."

648878,Fishnwire,2011-12-16 13:14:00,983,"  Most do not.  At least most I've been in do not.  I figure that's why even hours after the stove is lit and it's comfortable enough to take off your mitts and coat there is still ice and snow on the floor that never melts, let alone dries up.  I don't want that."

648947,walleyejigger,2011-12-16 18:10:00,876,"lookin sweet,  never hurts to overload puckboard with screws, as it will shrink in cold weather and expand in warm, enough so that it will snap a few of the 3/8"" bolts that we use to secure it.  i dont know about you, but the weather the last 3 days has been depressing, i usually have my hut out by christmas but i'd be very surprised if its out by the 1st week of january this year, i did walk out on the ice last weekend and it was plenty safe to walk on but i wouldn't do it today.  at least we're back to freezing temps.  lookin forward to next update"
649068,Fishnwire,2011-12-17 01:54:00,983,"Had another good day today.  It was almost 10 degrees above zero yesterday, and almost 10 degrees below zero today.  I added a few layers to my ensemble and got to the site about 9 am.  My buddy Jamz and my Dad joined me and my Father-in-law shortly after and we formulated a game plan.  It was rainy yesterday and cold all night so there was a pretty decent sheet of ice on the floor.  We were worried that the walls would slip off the edges as we put them up, so with a bucket of hot water and some rags we melted and soaked up the ice where the footers would go.  The first wall was the hardest...we nailed braces to the sides and the four of us grunted it into place...three guys held and one guy spiked the braces in place.  Then we screwed the footers down.    That's Jamz pretending to work...I'll admit we ""staged"" that shot.  Once we had that wall in place and secure we took the brace off one side and put another wall up.    Then the third...      And finally the last one, which was a bit of an effort, but eventually went into place.    Yeah, it's pretty big...I know.    With the walls all up we cut the plywood for the sliding windows, and fit them in.    You'll notice that on this one I didn't stain far enough in...I don't know why I did that, but I'll have to touch it up in the spring.  Then we started fitting insulation.  It's 2 inch Plastispan foam board.  We just used a handsaw to cut it and the electric knife for the occasional trim needed.  We finished the 12 foot north wall and 8 foot east wall that will have the door on it.      With a little less than half of the insulation to go, I'll soon finished that and then start on the roof.  Once that is on I can insulate it and then panel the walls.  Then I'll have a heat-able space to work in for the bulk of the remaining work.  I found out today that I've got a free stove and stove pipe waiting for me at my Brother-in-law's.  He was debating putting it in his garage but decided against it.  I'm hoping to pick that up tomorrow, along with the 2x4s and 1/2 ply for the roof.  I need a few more sheets of 2 inch foam board for the walls as well.  If I get that far by Sunday night (Gotta be back at work on Monday) I'll be quite happy."
649072,Nipfisher,2011-12-17 02:17:00,2449,Will you have to be sitting or bending down to see out the windows? Nice to have at least one up at standing height. Maybe frame one into the door?
649076,Fishnwire,2011-12-17 03:05:00,983,"  The long window is at the perfect height to see outside lines while seated at the bench jigging an inside line.  The low slider is so I can open and close it from bed...also the height just above that window is perfect for a folding countertop to prepare meals on or whatever.  The high slider is placed so that it won't be blocked when the bench in front of it is in the folded up position.  I might put one in the door, but probably not this year."

645546,BassAsin,2011-12-05 17:06:00,806,"I'm liking this thread quite a bit.   the few shacks i have built over the years and sold eventually were 2x4 ripped into 2x2 with mahogony underlay used for sheathing on 24"" centre, no structural issues. your 2x3 and 1/4"" ply will be more than suffice.  just as a heads up, make sure that your windows are set at a comfortable level both when standing up as well as sitting down in the shack. nothing worse than having to stand up beside your lazy boy in the shack to watch your outside lines."
645742,Fishnwire,2011-12-06 02:29:00,983,"  Thanks for your praise and more so for your advice.  I've given the window height quite a bit of thought and I think I'm going to be happy with them.  From the pic you might think they're a little high but that wall is going up so that the window is on the lower half of it, not the upper.  You might have to bend over a little if you're standing to see out them, but you won't have to stand up if you're sitting.  Thanks for letting me know I'm on the right track and double thanks for giving me a head's up."
645743,Fishnwire,2011-12-06 02:30:00,983,"Update...Dec 5 - OK...I don't have a lot to show.  We made as much progress as possible today.  Curing time holds things up.  We finished the last of the framing on the first wall, cut the plywood to accommodate the window, and then glued and screwed it down.    What sucked was that we were pretty much at a standstill at this point.  The construction adhesive needs time to cure, so we couldn't put the finished wall out side to make room to start another.  So we went and got the rest of the studs we need, more glue, kerosene for the heater, and and few other things.  We came back and picked out our headers and footers (straightest ones) and then cut the rest of our studs on the miter saw.  Then we started talking about what we'd do with the outside walls, as far as painting or staining them.  I realized that while the adhesive is drying in the heated garage overnight, it would be a good time to stain or paint it, so that it could dry too.  I don't know when the next time is that I'll have a heated space and time to do such a thing...finding a place to do it once the walls are up would be hard.  Now was absolutely the time.  I ran out and looked at a few options. I decided to go with a tinted oil deck stain.  It's supposed to be good for at least 5 years, it requires only one coat, and was available in many shades...they take the base, add the tint and mix it up right there.  I picked something called ""north pole""...seems appropriate.  Good thing I only needed a gallon...it was close to $50.  If I painted or went with a non-oil based stain, I would have had to prime or do a second coat (respectively) and lost an added a day's drying time to each wall.  Plus, once I'd buy the primer plus paint, or two gallons (instead of one) of stain, I wouldn't save any money.  Here's the first wall stained.  It looks pretty gray in the pics, but has a slight bluish tint to it in ""real life"".  There is one spot were the chalk liner puked out an insane amount of chalk, and although I cleaned it up as best I could, there's a reddish hue coming through...what are you gonna do?  It's just an ice hut after all.  Gimme a break already.    -    So the plan is to move that wall outside in the morning, put a tarp on it, and then start the opposite wall.  We'll (hopefully) finish that studding (including framing a window) glue and screw the plywood, stain it, and let that cure/dry overnight.  If that goes as scheduled I'll have the walls done by the end of my days off.  After that I still need to take the base out of the garage, invert it, put it back in the garage, cut and glue the insulation, apply the sliders (still don't have 'em) let all adhesive (foam board stuff and regular stuff for the sliders) dry, take it back out of the garage and flip it back over, put it on a trailer, stack the finished walls on top, drive it to my buddy's with a huge garage (works on semis in there, but will only give me a day or two) unload it, put walls up, build roof, let adhesive dry overnight, load it on the trailer and take to my driveway...(Whew...just thinking about all that work makes me tired) then I can heat the inside while I do the insulation, paneling, benches, shelves, wood stove and pipe, holes, roof exterior, etc.  I'll be able to do an hour or two of construction after work, where as now I have to drive halfway across town just to get to the build site.  I'm sure there will be sufficient ice to drive a tow vehicle on before I'm done...I just hope it hasn't all melted by then."
645745,Sinker,2011-12-06 02:36:00,8692,"You really are building a mansion for the ice. Over kill, bigtime. How much do you figure that floor alone weighs? I can't even begin to guess how much the whole thing weighs.  our 8x10 is 600lbs.  S."
645753,Fishnwire,2011-12-06 03:04:00,983," Yes.  I really am building a mansion for the ice.  Thanks for noticing from the pics...imagine how my guests will feel.  It's being built for comfort and longevity...not for mobility.  It will see the highway one time, spending summers blocked up on the shore less than a kilometer from where it will spend its winters.  My partner has a 3/4 ton diesel with plow and I a Jeep Rubicon with 6 inches of lift, 33 inch winter tires, and a 9500 lb winch.  I'll get it where it needs to go.  I can't even begin to guess how much the whole thing weighs either.  I know that my 79 year old Father-in-law and I could shift the completed base around the garage floor by ourselves, so it might weigh a little less than you think.  I'm sure your 8x10 is solid, comfortable, warm...and that you get the experience you want from it.  I want a place I can feel at home for three or four nights at a time...and I want my wife and the Old Man to feel the same way.  Wow.  I guess I'm coming off as a little defensive...I see that.  Maybe I'm way too into this?"
645757,Sinker,2011-12-06 03:07:00,8692,Naw...its all good. Moving a hut that size may not be as easy as you think though. Just sayin.....  I had several heavy huts before I learned my lesson.  S.
645778,Fishnwire,2011-12-06 03:39:00,983,"  I appreciate the heads up...I really do.  I've gone with things like 2x3s instated of 2x4s and quarter ply instead of 3/8 or half inch that I would have if weight wasn't an issue.  I was also talked out of a pre-hung door in favour of just using the plywood (backed with insulation) that I'll cut out for the door opening.  Things like that.  It's not like I have a total disregard for weight...but with my situation, I can afford to pack on a couple of pounds that others (without plows and Jeeps at their immediate disposal) might not be able to afford.  Regardless, nobody said it would be easy.  Someone though did say that if it was easy, everyone would do it.  I'm sure there will be lots of friggin' around, a few mishaps, and some near catastrophes in the building, transport, and life of this hut.  That's the same as just about every weekend at camp for me though...that's part of the fun.  My Father-in-law already mentioned something about what we'll do differently when we construct ""the next hut""...a sort of shuttle to the mother-ship we are now building...for day excursions to side lakes or back bays.  It'll be his turn to pay for that one, and he'll probably take all the advice on lightweight construction he can get."
645786,Twocoda,2011-12-06 04:21:00,4130,"too heavy ...too light...too big ...too small  but your ice fishing fun started the day you bought your first piece of lumber for this project...i hope this hut serves you and yours well for many years of fun memories and comfort.....i dont ice fish ...but if i was to....it would be in something similar to this calibre of comfort....  IF your canvassing for a name for the hut ...""Stayin N Style"" comes to mind cuz everyone else will be gone home and youll still be (supposedly) fishing   Cheers and good luck with the project...build threads are alot of fun !!!!and thanks for taking us along for the journey"
646363,Fishnwire,2011-12-08 02:42:00,983,"Hey Folks...  We worked the last two days but I didn't post an update yesterday...I had non-icehut related matters (also referred to as my life) that I had to attend to.  Priorities suck when they get in the way of frivolities.  On Tuesday morning we showed up to find the stain dry...but the fumes from it very much still present.  My brother-in-law's wife made him change his clothes and shower after he was in there at about 9 pm the night before just long enough to put fuel in the heater and turn off the lights.  That stuff is pungent.  We opened the garage door and let it air out for a few minutes and then moved the completed north wall out into the driveway.  There was only the Old Man and I so we shifted one edge onto a couple of dollies, then picked up the opposite side and walked it out.  Then we rested it on four milk crates.      Now we had room to start the south wall.  So away we went.  I picked out the placement of the window (I wanted this one a fair bit higher and off to one side) and we started framing.    Then glue, plywood, screws, stain...no buffing or scrubbing, it's just that easy!    We'll cut the hole for the window from the other side, once the wall is up.  No need to stain there.  We left that to dry overnight (cracked a window this time) and I went to Fabricland to look at 4 inch foam, which I thought I'd use for my bunks/benches.  It's $65 a meter, and I'd need nearly four meters of it, so I'm looking at other options.  Even the two inch stuff (how good a night's sleep would you get on that?) would cost me $140...I think I can find something better and cheaper.  My buddy suggested crib mattresses...I might go look at those.  I'd also love to hear other suggestions...that's YOU folks.  We happened to have four guys first thing this morning, so we each picked up a corner and easily moved the completed south wall outside and rested it on top of the north wall.    We began the west wall next.  I wanted this window low like the first one and off-centre enough to stay away from the stove that will go in the west-north corner.    We finished framing it, put the plywood on (with glues and screws of course)...    Then...my camera's batteries died.  We finished the screwin' and stained it.  Then went for lunch.  When we came back, (because of it smaller size than the north and south walls) we were able to lean it against a wall inside the garage.  This freed up the space to start the east wall.  Knowing I want a 30"" bench/bunk along the west wall (anything less will not provide a comfy night's sleep), I put the door so that I'll have room once the inside is insulated and paneled.  I wanted a door around 32"" wide (I'll have a bulky snowsuit on a lot of the time I'm going through it) so I had to off-centre the opening.  Not by much, a few inches maybe.  We finished the framing, and were ready to lay the plywood down, but my 79 year old Father-in-law decided he was ""tired"" and ""hungry"" and wanted to call it a day...can you believe that garbage?  If it wasn't for the fact that his knowledge and experience as a carpenter has prevented me from making innumerable mistakes, some of which would have nearly ruined the build, and at best I'd have a rickety, drafty piece of junk at this point...............On second thought, let's just forget I said anything.  Almost done though.  All that's left is (not necessarily in order):  Cut plywood for door. Lay down plywood on east wall. Stain it. Frame and hang door. Invert base (need at least four guys). Fit insulation to floor, glue it in, let it dry. Re-invert base, load on trailer, (walls too) take to my driveway. Unload it all, level out base. Assemble walls to base. Construct roof. Insulate walls Panel interior walls Build benches/bunk, shelves, etc Cut holes for fishing. Install metal base/backing for stove. Install stove/stove pipe. Attach metal roof. Wire electrics (surface mount).  The time it will take is one thing, but nearly every one of those things requires an investment of something other than time, if you know what I mean.  I think I have a line on a free wood stove and all the metal I need to back it, but other stuff won't be as cheaply available.  I've already got the insulation for the floor, but I don't have any yet for the walls or roof...the cost of that stuff adds up when you buy 24 sheets at once.  I'm not looking forward to that hit.  I am looking forward to having a well insulated hut to kick back in though, so what am I gonna do...right?  I will say that this thing is costing me more than I anticipated.  Maybe not so much what I budgeted, because when I thought about how much I could (should?) spend, and then did a preliminary investigation of what I thought it would cost, I figured I'd have a ton of ""wiggle room"".  If a hut was constructed of little more than studs and plywood (the cost of which I concentrated on) I could build three of them for what this thing will cost.  I didn't realize just how much things like construction adhesive, screws and nails, insulation, stain, a few tools I didn't have, kerosene for the heater, burning gas in the truck running around...and so on (and so on and so on it seems) adds to the cost of such a project.  I've heard you should always make the most accurate budget you can predict...and then double it.  I'm not there yet, but I might get close.  That's FA...I'm going to end up with the hut I want and it's not going to break me.  By the time's it's done, I might have to offer you a cheap brand of beer if you show up...but I won't have have to live in it, so it's all good.  More tomorrow I hope.  Don't forget to give me your suggestions for bench/bunk padding.  I need something no more than 30 inches wide, and it has to provide a decent night's sleep so it should be 3 or 4 inches thick at least.  Thanks in advance for your ideas...thanks for just following along."

They inflate to about an inch thick. When not in use they roll up and fit inside a storage cooler I have in the hut. If you lok back to the pictures I posted of the Nipissing gtg on Callander Bay you will see that my benches/beds fold down from the wall. They are supported by straps and legs. I made them 24"" wide and 6' 5"" long. Couch cushions can be cut down to a better thickness but it is a bit messy."
646728,Fishnwire,2011-12-09 12:06:00,983,"More progress...a little anyway.  First of all, we're finally getting a bit of winter weather here in Sudbury.  This was the view outside the garage by about noon yesterday.    I swept off my walls and then shoveled the driveway for my Brother-in-law.  I'm really grateful for the use of his garage...and he did say it was ""taking a little longer than I thought""...so I want to hurry up and get out of there while trying to be a good guest at the same time.  One thing I forgot to mention was that we cut groves in the west wall to accommodate the runners.  Check it out.      That was yesterday.  I cut them before I stained so that I could stain along the cut edges.  Anyway...  When we got there today, We were finished framing the east wall, so we cut the opening for the door and then glued 'n' screwed the plywood down.    Then the stain...    We let it dry for a couple hours while we got supplies to build the door and had a bite to eat.  Then we leaned it against the garage door with the west wall.  I'll cut the footer at the door opening once the walls are up so there's nothing to trip over.  I need it for now to maintain the structural integrity of the wall.  After we moved it I realized I forgot to cut the notches for the skis.  The stain was a bit tacky still and I didn't want to generate the sawdust so that will have to wait until later.    Next we built a simple door.  We made it out of the same quarter ply and 2x3's the rest of the walls are made from.  It fits like a glove and is remarkably rigid, considering it's components' relative flimsiness.  I figure it'll stiffen up even more once I fit and glue the insulation down.      The doubling up along the sides was structurally unnecessary, but that way it gives me something meaty to attach hardware to.  I had some time left after my Father-in-law went home so I went ahead with an idea I've been playing with.  Guys have told me to use 2x(whatever) blocks between the runners and ice to keep the hut from freezing in.  Someone else mentioned styrofoam blue-board is good because it resists freezing in.  I figured I'd combine the two.  I bought a one inch thick 2'x8' piece of blue-board and two pressure treated 10 foot 2""x8""s.  I cut the insulation into three 8 inch wide strips.    Then I took the 2x8s and applied foam board adhesive to the tops, then the foam board on top.  Then I made a ""double foam-board on pressure treated"" sandwich, and clamped it all together.      When I take the clamps off, I'll have two pieces,  each ten feet long (will fit inside shack for transport) that I can put under the hut, insulation side down and running perpendicular to the skis.  If they don't work it will have cost me around $40 to find out.  I've had more expensive lessons that taught me less.  I figured it was worth a try.  I'll let everyone know how they work out.  I go back to work Friday but am on night-shift, so I'm hoping to get some work done in the morning.  The problem is that the next step is insulating the floor, and I need to organize a time when I can get 4 to a  half-dozen men over there to flip that heavy such-and-such over.  It'll take some effort, but I'm sure it's do-able  We have to pull it out of the garage (we have dollies) flip it over, put it back on the dollies and wheel back inside.  I'll be happy when that is done, except that I'll know I have to do it all over again to get it right-side up.  Pics of an inverted base to come next...I hope."
646729,Billy Bob,2011-12-09 12:09:00,5865,Wouldn't a DARK color been better to draw the heat from the sun....in the spring I have a all BLACK fishing jacket for that reason.  Bob  Nice job....but I'm concerned with the overall weight.
646733,Fishnwire,2011-12-09 12:34:00,983,"  Good question...on a different forum (ice fishing related only) this topic came up on another poster's thread and a few people warned that dark coloured shacks tend to melt the ice and snow around the hut faster than light coloured shacks.  It would seem to me the opposite would be true...the light and heat being absorbed by a dark shack as opposed to a light shack which (one would think) would reflect that light and heat back onto the surrounding ice and snow.  Who knows?  I went with a shade of stain I thought was sort of neutral, plus I just liked that colour.  I'm real happy with how it looks dry...the grain of the wood is not covered up but enhanced, and the bluish-gray has an arctic feel to it.  Besides, this hut is going to be tight and well-insulated (walls, ceiling and floor)...if the stove is going, a lack of heat probably won't be a problem.  Two guys exhaled breath alone will probably bring the temp up a degree or two.  As far as the overall weight goes...I'm ""concerned"" too.  But I want a certain type of ""ice-hut"" experience, and am willing to put up with a lot a friggin' around to have that."
646758,Nipfisher,2011-12-09 14:26:00,2449, Why not use the jack-alls you said you have to lift it up and block it? Then you can apply the styrafoam from underneath.It wont help much with the runners but you could get the foam done on your own or with the help of your father in law. I just repaired one of my runners this week. I jacked up each side of my hut and blocked it up. Laying on my back I was able to remove and re-attach the plastic runner by myself..
646759,Nipfisher,2011-12-09 14:29:00,2449,  My hut had white vinyl siding on it when I bought it. I was concerned about white on white snow but my hut has reflectors on every side. It shines in the head lights. Make sure your hut is visable to smowmobilers!
646783,Billy Bob,2011-12-09 15:11:00,5865," Well I will say  this....if you ever invite this old Redneck up there I would not refuse to take part in what looks like one of the finest ice fishing Resorts I have seen go together.....  I only have one more thing to say.............  ""Get 'R Done""  ....  Bob"
648492,Fishnwire,2011-12-15 02:14:00,983,"Hey Folks...  I've been working (for a living...not the fun kind) quite a bit lately so the progress is not great.  Last time on ""Ice Hut Build"" we finished the walls and door, including stain, and were ready to start insulating them.  We tried cutting the 2 inch ""Plastispan"" foam boards with a utility knife, but it was a bit ""hacky"", so we used the circular saw and straight edge.  It worked great and we did the door and west wall it will hang on.    We had planned on using foam board adhesive.  This stuff...    But we soon found out it is terrible stuff to work with.  Its consistency is nothing like regular PL Premium construction adhesive, which spreads easily but (I've been told) burns through foam board.  You also need to apply ""mechanical support"" for 24 hours while it dries.  We had to weigh it down and were running out of heavy stuff to do so with.  I decided to forgo the adhesive, knowing the paneling I'll use will keep the foam board from going anywhere.  This also meant I couldn't use it (count on it) to keep my foam panels on the underside in place.  I had previously considered skinning the bottom with 3/8s ply, so that made up my mind.  The ply will sandwich the foam board beneath the floor ply.  The other thing we found out is that cutting foam board with a Skilsaw, while allowing for a perfect fit, creates a lot of foamy sawdust.  That stuff (unlike wood sawdust) just flies around when you try to sweep it up.  I didn't want to generate that kind of mess in my Brother-in-law's normally pristine garage.  Knowing we didn't need the heated space for foam board adhesive to cure, we decided we were done there.  We loaded the 4 walls on my trailer and brought them to my Father-in-law's driveway.  It's pretty big.  He promised my Mother-in-law we'd have it done and out of there by Christmas...which he agreed to knowing full well it will never happen.  He wonders why he gets into trouble with her.  Then again, I've pulled similar stuff on his daughter, so I can't judge.  Then we made a second trip for the base.    That's my buddy whose place the hut is going.  The three of us and my Dad just picked up the base and put it on the trailer, no problem.  It wasn't as heavy as I thought...not nearly as much.  The walls are really light.  I think this thing is not going to be quite the pig I had imagined.  We unloaded at the new site.  You'll notice there's little sign that winter has arrived in Sudbury.  At least it takes the pressure off of the build schedule knowing there's nothing resembling an ice surface that will accommodate it within at least a hundred kilometers.    Flipping the base was not as hard as I thought it would be either.  ""My Two Dads"" and I did it ourselves, with only a moment's grunting.    I picked up some 1/4 puckboard cut into 4 inch strips, 8 feet long.  It cost me about $70 tax in.  I had a few lines on free alternatives...but none seemed to pan out and I just needed something so I could get it done.  I picked up a number 8 bit with a collar that allows counter-sinking of the screw head, and put about a million 2 inch screws in.  I tried one inch screws but they spun instead of ""sucking in"" slightly.        I wanted to cut the jigging holes before I fit the insulation and then the underskin, figuring it would be easier to do it one layer at a time.  Ideally I'd like them about 6 inches closer to the bench than where they will go, but the runners are in the way.  My other option is to move them to the insides of the runners, but they'll be way too close for comfortable jigging...almost between ones' feet.  If I'd have moved the runners further out, I'd have needed another east/west joist between them, so this was the best option.  Also this leaves a nice, wide walk-way through the centre of the hut.  I bought some pails from Lowes to insert into the holes to cut down on draft and provide a ""catch-ridge"" for items accidentally kicked around or dropped on the floor.  My father in law had a bunch...but they were of a variety of sizes and current condition.  I figured it would save a lot of hassle to just get four the same size and that are easily replaceable.  They were about $4 each, so they're far from a big ticket item.  They came with lids which I'll glue the insulation I'll cut out for the holes to the underside of.  They also have a nice big lip on the outside a few inches down that will allow them to fit nicely and flat even if my hole cuts are not perfect.  I turned them upside down and cut the bottoms out with a jigsaw.    Look at the Old Man...he's in his glory.  I can't seem to find a pic of my Mother-in-law from today with a similar look on her face.  Oh well.    It was raining pretty hard by now, so we didn't want to bust out the power tools in it.  That was the end of things for the day.  Tomorrow I want to cut those holes, fit the insulation and underskin for the floor (cut those holes) and flip it back over.  The following day the walls go up.  Thanks for checking in...  FISH'n'WIRE"
648499,Nipfisher,2011-12-15 02:34:00,2449,Coming along nicely.
648518,Fishnwire,2011-12-15 03:12:00,983," Slower than I'd like...and a bit more $ than I planned.  But thanks.  I realize these updates are painfully slow and contain way more detail than anyone is likely interested in, but I'm using it like kind of a personal journal documenting the build...something for me to look back on.  If others get some insight that is useful in their own builds...that's great too.  The questions, comments and criticisms from everyone have been invaluable at times too.  I really appreciate them.  I look forward to being able to post pics of the finished product in its intended location for those that have followed along.  I also promise that I'll let everyone know how things like transport to the ice, moving it around, freezing in, and other problems are handled, should they arise.  I want this to be the report that I'd have wanted to read before I started this build.  If I screw up huge in some way (many ways?)...you will all know about it."
648571,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 11:25:00,5865,"I would be VERY VERY interested on how you move this Ice Resort on and off the ice.....is it possible to video tape that procedure.....  GOOD LUCK....it's looking FIRST CLASS...why I have rented cottages (that's what they called them, not my wife) that were not half as nice as your Ice Resort.  Bob"
648761,Fishnwire,2011-12-15 23:16:00,983,"  I had thought maybe I'd hire a tilt and load tow truck, but today I was offered the use of a double axle landscapers trailer that will (just barely) accommodate the hut.  It will only see the highway one time, I'll put it on the ice via a frozen boat ramp, and I just have to pull it up on my buddy's lawn in the spring.  I can't promise video but you'll get to see a few pics."
648762,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 23:29:00,5865," Sounds good...just hope the weather now cooperates for you guys ASAP....  As a old saying goes ""it's tough sledding without snow""....and this time it hits the ice hut nail almost on the head....LOL"
643852,Nipfisher,2011-11-29 03:16:00,2449,Rod Caster had this thread last winter. some nice shacks on this site. My new one is on the 2nd page.   Ice shacks home made or not
643855,Skipper D,2011-11-29 03:34:00,1970,"  Thier amazing , its interesting how inventive people get when they build them , i like seeing all the diferant styles ........."
643858,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 03:41:00,983," I did ask for feedback and I appreciate every word of it.  I'm not dismissing any of it...I'll just let you know my situation and what I'm thinking.  Let me know if you think I'm still missing something.   I've got a Jeep Rubicon with lift and decent winter tires, plus my buddy (whose property it will likely spend summers) has a 3/4 ton diesel with a plow.  The hut won't go out until the ice is safe for a full-size vehicle and will come off before it isn't.  Slush isn't a big problem in the spring as the bay drains into the river...the water level doesn't rise, it slowly drops.  There isn't a lot of water coming up in the bay, even after hard snowfalls.  I'll have a road plowed and area cleared before it goes out, if need be.  I've got two 2-ton jack-alls from off-roading that will help me out too.  I've got friends who live on the river and don't work in the winter...I should be able to count on them to shift it around every couple of days if need be.  Hey, I know it's not going to be light...but I want a decent shack and the PITA it is to move around will hopefully be outweighed by its comfort level once its in place.   One inch styrofoam seems a bit thin to me.  I'm doing the floors/ceiling with 3"" and the walls with 2.5"".  I want it warm enough to not only take off my coat...I want to be able to take off my boots!  I have pretty much been convinced to go with 2x3s and 1/4 ply though...not 2x4's and 3/8 ply, that's for sure.  I'm going to try to keep it light, but I want an actual structure...not just a covering, if you can understand what I mean.  I'm planning on spending three and four days at a time using it...I want to feel like I'm ""inside"".  As far as locking it up...its not really thieves I worry about as the area is frequented mainly by locals, their comings and goings known to my buddy whose property they park on and cross to access the water.  My friend's hut which is there is sometimes used by whomever and I've come there to find little annoyances such as fish gut remnants on the floor, all the wood burned, or evidence of ""partying"" which I'd rather my wife or father not see.  Dumb stuff like that.  I just want to control who is using it more than anything else.  Thanks for your input...it's definitely given me pause for thought and ammunition when I debate my father-in-law on issues of weight vs strength."
643859,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 03:44:00,983,"That's a nice hut there, Sinker.  Very nice.  I really like your stove.  It looks like exactly what I want.  Do you mind if I asked where you got it and what you paid for it?"
643862,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 03:52:00,983, I'm starting to think I'll panel the inside with something.  Guaranteed after an outing or two of looking at styrofoam and studs I'll be wishing I would have.  What do you think of 2x3's and 1/4 ply instead of 3/8's ply?  I'm 90% convinced that's what I'm going to go with when I get to the lumber yard tomorrow morning.  I'll tell you what friend...I can't wait to see the finished product either!  Thanks for you your suggestions and compliments.
643865,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 04:08:00,983,"  Now you've got me rethinking the whole 2x3 idea.  2x3 = 1.5x2.5 = 3.75  2x4 = 1.5x3.5 = 5.25  Therefore 2x3s are about 71% the weight of 2x4s...right?  Including the framing of the door and windows, I'll need something like 60 of them (if I recall correctly)...I don't know how much 7'4"" (or whatever) 2x4 weighs, but a 29% reduction is not exactly negligible.  Like I say...now you've got me thinking."
643867,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 04:13:00,983,"  I've got two jack-alls already, and was planning on blocking it up.  I hear if you take 2x6's and glue some blue board insulation to their bottoms, they make excellent blocks which (due to the insulation in contact with the ice) resist freezing in."
643868,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 04:14:00,983,  That's really nice.  I like the Jeep in your avatar as well.  What's it got?
643870,Sinker,2011-11-29 04:15:00,8692,"That's our second stove. That one we got from princess auto...it was cheap....maybe $100?? I'm not really sure. It works great though, and you can cook on it no problem. One fire log lasts about 6 hours when its real cold. Even then you have to open the door once in a while. No problem at all taking your coat off, but I like to have my boots on....its hard to keep the floor dry when your hauling fish out of it, and baiting hooks! We've spent many a weekend out in it, no problem. One cold, windy night, we had 13 adults inside ""warming"" up....lol....it was full to the brim, but we were all in there  I keep it close to home, so no need to stay out in it, but we've had some good times out there!  S."
643872,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 04:18:00,983,"  That's really nice.  I haven't decided what I'm going to do about ""facilities""...I thought maybe a pop up and a 5 gallon bucket might be the best I can hope for."
643875,mukluk,2011-11-29 04:25:00,196,Didn't know you had an arsenal of lifting and pulling devices at your disposal.  lol   With that equipment than there should be no problem dealing with the  weight.  Forgot to mention proper ventilation for wood stove.   Have a window that will open.  Going to be a nice hut.  Enjoy
643876,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 04:35:00,983,  I'll go to Princess tomorrow.  You say it is your second stove...how come?  Why did you replace it?  The plan is to get a couple of pairs of slippers with water-proof soles.  That way I'll keep my feet dry but still be able to put them up on the bench and have a little nap.  I'm putting this hut about an hour from home.  That way I can be on the ice for sun-up without having to get out of bed at 4 am.  Also I can get the sun-down fishing in and not have to worry about driving home in the dark after a day of fishing and the occasional beer or two.  It also facilitates taking a nap during the midday hours which are often slow.
643877,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 04:48:00,983,"  I've got two insulated double pane sliding windows going in.  They're quite nice and I only paid $5 each for them.  Thanks again for your input.  Every single thing you said was bang-on.  A lot of it I had already thought of but if I hadn't, I would have really been missing something and the head's up would have been invaluable.  That's what's so awesome about this site.  People here know stuff and they'll take the time to share it with you...at no cost!  All you have to do is ask.  What a concept!  I'm fairly certain I will ""enjoy""...Thanks again."
643878,Sinker,2011-11-29 04:48:00,8692,"The first stove we had was an ooooold coal burning stove, with a water jacket on it. It was a great stove, but was burnt out. This one is only has two seasons on it, but so far, so good. Its fairly solid, but not too heavy, and will burn a 16"" log.  S."

643932,cheaptackle,2011-11-29 13:10:00,849," 29% is noticeable for sure BUT if you're talking 29% of 200 lbs of 2 x 4 the savings is only about 58 lbs.  That's a lot for a small hut, but on yours I don't really think you'd even detect it.  Best way to figure this out is calculate the total lineal footage you're going to use, weigh 8 feet each of 2 x 4 & 2 x 3 then take it from there. One suggestion I saw had 2 x 6 being ripped to 2 x 3  - that would be stronger than the finger joint stuff I'd think Now if you really want to complicate it consider the weight of cedar vs SPF"
644164,Fishnwire,2011-11-30 01:11:00,983,"Update...Tuesday, November 29/2011  Well I made the decision...I'm going with 2x3s and 1/4 ply.  The 2x3s seem pretty light...I think their smaller size means they dry out more and have a lower moisture content.  I could be wrong, but they feel around half the weight of a 2x4.  Noticeably lighter anyway.  You can't get a 12 foot 2x3, four of which I require for headers and footers, so we had to splice them.  More on that later.    I could have got 3/8 unsanded ply for about $6 a sheet less than the 1/4 ""one good side"" I opted for.  I couldn't find the 1/4 in unsanded, but I'll want to paint or stain it anyway, so it's probably for the best.  Also, 1/4 ply is only two thirds the weight of 3/8s.  The nice thing is that we have the finished floor to work off of and use to keep everything lined up and square.  We want the plywood to extend past the footers and headers of the stud walls so it covers and can be glued and screwed to the floor and roof joists.  We're going to use the full eight feet, so we used the eight foot width of the hut to line things up.  We started by measuring what we need to extend to the floor joists, and clamped our footers that distance from the edge.    Then we did the same with the header, and put the corner joists in.  Next we positioned the window where we wanted it, and framed it.    Then we had to deal with our splices for the header and footer.  The header has the four foot section on the left and the 8 foot section on the right, and the footer the opposite, so that the splices are ""kitty-corner"" to one another, and not one below the other.  Once the studs on either side of the seam were in place, we cut 2x3's to fit, and applied glue.    Then we clamped them down and put the screws to them.      We left those to set and have about another half an hour of studding left until we can put the plywood on.  Then we'll take the finished wall outside and start the next one.  We did have a couple things go wrong today.  When we went to cut our second stud with my Brother-in-law's mitre saw, the blade guard's auto retract stopped working...it appears some spring is broken.  I had just seen a 10"" laser sliding compound mitre saw and sale at Lowe's and said, ""To heck with it"", ran back there and picked it up.  I could have done without having to drop the cash but it is quite a nice saw and a joy to use.  I was planning on getting one sooner or later...sooner is OK.  The thing that really drove me nuts though was my Father-in-law and the screws he brought.  When we were making the shopping list he said, ""Don't buy 3 inch wood screws...I have lots.""  The problem was that they were all ones he used on concrete forms and reclaimed.  See anything wrong with these?      About a quarter of them were bent, and most of the other ones' recesses were either stripped or partially full of hardened concrete.  What a PITA!  I appreciate him helping me out with supplies, but I would have much rather just spent a couple a bucks and had screws I didn't have fight with.  I love having him around and his experience is often invaluable...but when he pulls that kind of stuff (which he does all the time) he drives me freakin' nuts!  I'm back at the mine for the next five days, 12 hour shifts...so I probably won't have much progress to report for a while.  I'd love to blow off a week or so, but if you added the lost pay to the cost of the build, I'd have to live in the hut to pay for my divorce lawyer.  Love the questions and comments from you folks...they keep my obsession focused."

645129,walleyejigger,2011-12-03 17:31:00,876,"vermillion lake itself is between chelmsford and dowling, and in the winter becomes overtaken by castles/mansions or wutever ppl. like to call them, it's primarily a party lake, fishing is done but not too seriously, easily drivable by truck and most of the time by car, literally hundreds of huts and many of them are just as nice as houses, with the comforts as well, many have a satellite dish or solar panels or christmas lights/ trees, street names, etc., roads are plowed on the lake quicker than our city/town streets, most years i make a jug curling rink on the lake, painted circles and lines and all. visiting family and friends during winter months happens more at the castle than our actual homes, thus the reason i have 2 huts, one for socializing and another on a different lake for actual fishing,  whitewater lake in azilda is the same,"
645443,Fishnwire,2011-12-05 02:13:00,983,  You'll get that tomorrow night.  I'm off this week Monday to Thursday so I'm hoping to make some real progress.  I'm dying to get over there and get back to work in the morning.  Being obsessed with something is fun!
643551,Fishnwire,2011-11-28 01:46:00,983,"I posted this on another site, one devoted strictly to ice fishing.  I figured I'd post it here too.  I hope you like it.  All forms of feedback are encouraged.  -  This year, I decided to commit myself (and a couple of dollars) to finally building the hut I've always wanted.  I've been in lots of huts and even worked on a couple with friends...I have a very definite idea of what I want and what I don't.  It's going to be 12'x8', fully insulated, and will sleep two comfortably.  It is destined for a section of the Lower X River called X Bay, about an hour away from where I live.  I'll have to transport it there only once, it will spend summers on the shore of a friend's house located close by.  I'm eager to share my progress and get feedback from others, so I'm starting this thread which I will update as need be.  Here goes...  The hut started with four 14 foot rough cut (actual dimension) 2""x10""'s.  I picked them up from a local sawmill.    The idea was to sister two together, creating two 14 foot 4""x10""'s.  They'd be the runners.  Then I'd notch them every two feet to a depth of 3.5"" to accept 2x4 floor joists.  We started doing this in my Father-in-law's front room of his house.  We lined up all four on their edges and clamped them together, marked the spots for the joists and used a Skill saw cut notches, then drilled the holes for the bolts.  Then we took two at a time, applied PL Premium construction adhesive to one side, clamped them back together and fastened them with 4.5"" long 1/2 inch bolts...which are a little big I know, but I got them for free.    Here's a ""finished"" one.      At this point my Mother-in-law started to complain about the sawdust and woodchips.  Frankly I'm surprised we got away with it as long as we did.  My Father-in-law gave his son a call and (I have a great brother-in-law) he agreed to give us use of his garage.  We packed up and headed over...    We still had to deepen the notches, as the skill saw blade was not deep enough by about 3/4 inch.  I used a hand saw and cut five or six notches in each notch, then we cleaned them up with a chisel.    Then we cut the ends at an angle to form skis...    And here we have two completed skis...glued and bolted with notches done and the ends cuts.  They don't look like a big deal...but it was way more work and took much longer than I thought it would have, that's for sure.    Here's a close up of an end and a notch...    Tomorrow is another day...an update will follow.  I welcome all comments, questions and criticisms."
643559,Nipfisher,2011-11-28 02:03:00,2449,Those are some solid runners. Great start to the hut process. If weight is not an issue then you are doing it right in my books. I pay a tilt-n-load tow truck to move mine twice each year. I store it for free at the end of my road so I can work on it durring the summer/fall.
643561,Stef,2011-11-28 02:09:00,63,"Thats going to be a big, heavy but comfortable hut.  Consider (if I guess your plans right) that you can traverse about 6"" of snow before you start plowing in front of your hut when towing....."
643562,Fishnwire,2011-11-28 02:12:00,983,"  I was thinking about a tilt and load tow truck when the time comes...how much do you pay?  I'm hoping to keep it on a friend's property right on the river in the summer, so I'll only need the service one time.  I wouldn't exactly say weight is not an issue...but I do want a solid, spacious hut.  To be honest, those runners are going to be the beefiest part of the build...I wanted a good base, but I'm going to try and keep things a little lighter once that's done."
643563,Fishnwire,2011-11-28 02:20:00,983,"  I'm thinking 2x3s (24 inch centres) and 1/4 ply for the sides, so it probably won't turn out as heavy as the runners might suggest.  Once I've affixed sliders to the runners, I figure I'll have close to seven inches clearance.  My chum has a big diesel pickup with a plow there, so I'll get it where it needs to go."
643570,Stef,2011-11-28 02:32:00,63,"Make sure it's not wider than the plow.  Also, will mean you will have to wait to get it out until the ice is strong enough for a truck, or catch it when the snow is down.....  Lots of the big huts here have removable skids, fairly deep, jack the hut up, pull out sled component and then lower hut to blocks."
643573,gaspumper,2011-11-28 02:38:00,393,"If your putting 24"" centers for the wall studs I don't think 1/4 plywood will be stong enough for a hut that size."
643577,woodenboater,2011-11-28 02:58:00,2277,"Looks like a solid hut you're building there and I look forward to updated reports.  Never built one myself but I'd considering adding more radius to the front of the skis vs the angle cut. Whether or not this will help in the pull or not, a more experienced member would have to pipe in with their thoughts. It would give you a smoother transition for the teflon/uhmw/whatever you use under the runners for slip."
643578,Fishnwire,2011-11-28 03:01:00,983," You might be right, I'm considering 3/8 as well...I'm not there yet.  Probably 2x4 studs for the corners instead of 2x3's too.  Regardless, I'm going to be covering it with 2.5 or 3 inch ""Plastispan"" insulation on the inside, fitted tightly between the studs and glued in place.  It should add some rigidity."
643579,Fishnwire,2011-11-28 03:04:00,983,  I was thinking about touching them up with the planner before I seal them and put the runners on...to get a more rounded profile.  I'll do that first thing in the morning.  Thanks.
643630,I'mHooked,2011-11-28 15:28:00,525,"So, you had all night. Is the hut done yet?    Let's see the pics! What's taking so long?  Looks like it'll be at least a sturdy base!"
643653,Jds63,2011-11-28 18:22:00,1365,"great post, looking forward to seeing your progress"
643766,GBW,2011-11-28 23:03:00,8460,"when you are done that, can you make me one just a bit smaller?     It only needs to sleep one..."
643789,Sinker,2011-11-29 00:12:00,8692,"I would try and find some metal for the exterior walls. Not only is it a lot lighter, but it lasts forever. If you can find printers tin, its usually priced fair. When I built my hut, around 15 yrs ago, that's what I used......and its still on there.  Same set up as your doing, heavy duty floor, and light walls/ roof. I used 2x2 framing for the walls and roof. Its plenty strong. Ours has lasted all this time with the odd patch here and there of the tin. Find some plexi glass for the windows, and a nice little wood stove and your good to go!  Did you put any thought into your floor holes when you laid out the notches for your joists?? Just askin....  S."
643799,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 00:47:00,983,"  Not quite done, but here's what happened today...  -  UPDATE... - I had a pretty good day today, things are taking shape.  Worked on the hut for a good five hours...it's not going as fast as I'd like, but good things take time, right?  I took the advice of others and rounded out my ski ends.  I measured three inches from the bottom corner in both directions, drew a line connecting them and cut that off with a Skil saw.  Here's one that I did to next to one I hadn't yet.    Then I took the power planer to it and rounded it off a little.    Next I applied wood protector...Cabot's Australian Timber Oil.  The rough cut lumber soaked up a ton of the stuff and I had to work it in with the brush to get all the nooks and crannies.  I didn't do the tops, bottoms, or notches because I'd be covering them with construction adhesive and wanted a clean surface.    Now we were able to start cutting the floor joists.  We used the miter saw and cut them all 93 inches (8 feet minus the 2x4's that would run on the ends perpendicular) then measured and marked them where they'd intersect with the runners, which we took of the bench and placed 48 inches apart (on centre.)    We started inserting the joists into the runners, checking our marks and making sure it was square as we went.    Things looked good so we pulled them out one at a time, spread adhesive in the notches and put them back in.  Then we attached the 12 footers on the sides, spread more adhesive over the tops of the runners and joists, laid down the plywood, squared it up, and screwed it down.      So that's where I'm at now.  The floor needs to be flipped upside down (3 guys should have no trouble) so that the insulation can be fitted and glued.  I'll decide then whether or not I'll put a plywood skin on the bottom.  I'll also put some sliders on before I flip it back over.  I think I'm going to go with puckboard which I've found for sale nearby.  BONUS PIC!!!!!  This is the dog eating the left-overs from breakfast.    I'm not sure what we'll tackle tomorrow.  I think it'll just be my 79 year old Father-in-law and I there, so inverting the base might not happen.  If that's the case, we'll start on our stud walls and wait to finish the base when we have another couple of able bodies.  We just won't be able to put them up.  There's a fair amount of framing involved...a window on each of three sides and the door on the other.  I'm tempted to use 2x3s instead of 2x4s but the Old Man is humming and hawing.  He knows a thing or two about carpentry but has a tenancy to overbuild things.  He is used to building for strength, with no regard to weight.  The outside skin will be 3/8 ply...and the inside will have blue-board insulation...I probably won't bother with any kind on interior paneling.  I'm planning on two foot centres...should I go with 2x4s, or could I get away with 2x3's?  I'd like to hear some opinions on the matter, if people have any.  More later...keep the comments and questions coming.  They are really helpful."
643806,Fishnwire,2011-11-29 01:03:00,983,"  I think printer's tin might be a little wimpy for this baby...I did consider it though.  I want it to be somewhat secure and nothing but tin walls between a thief and my stuff bothers me.  2x2 framing, eh?  So do you think I'd have any problem using 2x3's for my studs (with 3/8 ply) instead of the 2x4's my Father-in-law is cautioning towards?  I've got real windows for it.  I looked at a bunch of used ones and found exactly what I wanted...you'll see them soon I hope.  I had plexi on a hut I shared with a buddy and it always frosted up.  I am looking for a wood stove still.  I've seen a couple that weren't bad, but the owners wanted a fortune for them.  If I can't find one I like at a reasonable price I'll settle for propane until I do.  The joists pretty much had to be two foot centres to line up with the plywood seams, and the runners width was dictated by the width of the trailer that will be used to transport it.  The floor holes will have to go where the floor members ain't...I only want two or three, so I'm sure I'll find places for them."
643836,mukluk,2011-11-29 02:38:00,196,"Well you asked for feedback;so here goes FishNwire  Your making your hut waaay too heavy.  Secret is to keep it as light as possible for so you can handle it without an army of guys. First heavy snowfall is going to force ice down and water up: freezing those 2x10's into new ice unless you lift it weekly. A normal ice pick won't lift that weight.  You would need a fence jack or other jacking means. Another problem arises with weight If there is slush on the lake in the spring when huts have to be off and can't get the truck out there to fetch it in.  I have been making huts since 1967 and not a pro builder that's for sure but the secret is to keep it as light as possible. Try 2x4's for floor joists and 2x2's for framing, printers plate with 1 inch styrofoam for walls and half inch plywood for roof and floor. Plan your hole layout etc before you put down plywood. Build a sleigh sturdy and light as possible with 10-12 inch height. Either welded 1 inch pipe or wood with black abs on the wooden runners.  Take your valuables home with you when your not at the hut and leave it UNLOCKED.  Thieves will smash your door in if they find it locked."
643837,Sinker,2011-11-29 02:40:00,8692,"2x3's with 3/8 ply will be plenty solid. Over kill if you ask me.  Mine is 8x10, and we've never had a problem with the tin, or the 2x2 framing. Remember, I built it 15 years ago, and its still rock solid. Once we break it free from the ice with a bar, I can move it around with one hand. We tow it to the lake on a double skidoo trailer, with a winch to haul it on. We also put currogated plastic carboard on the inside walls, and sealed them up real good with 100mph tape and caulking. The plexiglas doesn't fog up once the stove is hot  That is going to be a beast once your done with it. A heavy beast!! You should be plenty cozy though  S."
643838,Sinker,2011-11-29 02:41:00,8692,Also....what Mukluk said.....all true good info!  S.
643840,Sinker,2011-11-29 02:51:00,8692,"Heres a few pics, might give you an idea.          We built the walls 5ft high, and the slope of the roof is enough for a guy my height, 6'4"" to stand with a hood and toque on. Its always open, with nothing it it. I bring all the gear out in a box that doubles as a bench. There is one permanent bench, and a couple fold down tables. We used to have two fold down bunks, but we never used 'em so, we took them out. They worked great though. 6 holes in the floor, but there is rarely more than 2 people fishing inside. I hardly ever do, I'd rather be in the open, but I do like to go in and warm up by the fire and get something ""warm"" to drink  S."
643842,GYPSY400,2011-11-29 02:54:00,191,"When I built my 8x8 hut we used 2x3 on 24"" centers.. Actually we ripped 2x6's in half because it's cheaper.. The outside was covered in 1/4"" aspenite ( chip board) and inside was covered with the cheapest panelling I could find, as I didn't want to look at bare studs and styrofoam.. It also gives you space to put up x-rated or fishing pictures.  Floors and roof are 2x4 on 16""center.. Strength doesn't seem to be an issue.  You seem to be on the right track with your hut, I really like the notched out ski idea, it would tie everything together and give it strength.   I recommend Ripped 2x6 walls ( so 2x3), and if your sheeting with 3/8"" plywood - glued and screwed 24"" stud centers will be plenty strong.. As the sheeting will add rigidity if it's glued and screwed too. I also recommend panelling the interior to give it a finished look, Which also gives you the option to paint as well. You've done a good job so far, so might as well make the inside nice to look at since that's what you see when your out there.  I can't wait to see the finished product."
643844,cheaptackle,2011-11-29 02:56:00,849,"Printers tin (printing plates) would be great especially if you glued them to your studs and rigid insulation - nice and firm that way.  As for security - windows break easier!  Besides, (sadly) anything you do other than bullet proofing will only keep out the honest thieves!  Use the roofing screws with hex heads & rubber washers to attach it to the exterior.  Excellent material for the roof too.  If you do it on the inside as well (glue & screw to insulation & studs) it becomes a solid modular panel with strength greater than the individual components, reflects internal heat & light and leaves you a nice finish rather than bare insulation. Watch the 2 x 3's-most are finger jointed meant for light duty such as interior non load bearing partitions.  You might wanna do the math and determine just how much weight you'll save by using less than 2 x 4 - on a hut that size fifty or a hundred pounds probably won't be a deal breaker. I remember a woodstove I had  -  it was stamped/rolled out of sheet metal, shaped like an oval drum, semi air tight and LIGHT.  Used it to heat a cabin much bigger than your hut, kept it toasty all night.  Took a 16"" x 10"" log standing up.  Lasted me for several years, use every weekend fall, winter & spring as the sole heat source (some cooking too!).  Michael"
643845,Nipfisher,2011-11-29 02:59:00,2449,"Go ahead and build it big and heavy. Just go buy a farm jack ""jack-all"" from Canadian Tire for $80 (was on for $50 last week). I have no promblem with mine but don't leave it for more then a couple weeks without making sure it is lifted up high. I use chunks of 4x4 to hold up my hut from freezing into the ice.   I have heard of people using ice blocks to hold up their huts but never tried it myself. Just have an ice cream pail at the hut and fill it with lake water and you can make al the blocks you need. I may try it this year as they do not need to be claened up at seasons end."
643846,GYPSY400,2011-11-29 03:00:00,191,Actually my hut has one of those oval tin can wood stoves too!! Put too much wood in and it becomes a sauna!
643848,Skipper D,2011-11-29 03:05:00,1970,"....... Here we are , check this baby out 14'x16', built it in the back yard  its framed with 2x3's , 1/4""plywood on the floor in 16"" centers , and closed in with wood grain 5mm sheeting , i don't ice fish so its going to be my guest bunk house out back ..... cost 2200.00 for every thing i needed to build it ."
