675850,MJL,2012-03-14 00:07:00,2427,"Here's one thread I made a couple years ago with keeping minnows in a fish tank during ice season  Keeping minnows  If you can find them, dace are super hardy and keep very well in a fish tank - I actually don't think any of them died compared to the shiners. I did feed them bits of algea wafers that plecos normally eat. I'm sure they'd also take flakes too if you wanted to feed them.  If you're keeping minnows as an educational experience for kids, it can be pretty cool watching them. Not the most practical way to store minnows that you're going to use though...It was often a challenge trying to net them out of tank with decorations, filters, air hoses, rocks, etc"
