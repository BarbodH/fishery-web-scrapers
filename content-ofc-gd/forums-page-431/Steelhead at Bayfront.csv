Once the rain let off I grabbed my tackle and went back to Bayfront. I started near a loading dock and circled my way down the perimeter of the park, I ended up in a location and knew there HAD to be something there. I was fixing some line I bought from crappy tire (triline - never again) on one rod when my other rod got smashed! Caught a nice steelhead, took a pic and released her. Mission accomplished, needless to say, I will return shortly! "
