674075,bigugli,2012-03-08 02:05:00,6138,Too nice to sit indoors. Besides I was going cross-eyed making baits. So I grabbed my bag and some salties and spent the afternoon chasing panfish til dark. Nice mix of just about everything today.     And a fitting reward after a good day's fisking.

675502,bigugli,2012-03-13 01:37:00,6138,"had another afternoon of feisty panfish All caught on an ice jig tipped with salties, then released.      Surprisingly, somebody else was catching all the WGSF."
675506,Rod Caster,2012-03-13 01:49:00,5784,  Good mix of pannies. What's this? White bass? White perch?

675541,Dave Bailey,2012-03-13 04:21:00,1641,A lot of them seem to like the taste of your left thumb. Ever think of using it as bait?
675595,bigugli,2012-03-13 13:55:00,6138,"Actually, pike really like the taste of that thumb."
