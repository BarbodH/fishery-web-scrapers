Different rules for different members. Especially if your best fishing buddy is a mod. Heck, the mods themselves even get to sling crap at members without reprise. There are definitely different standards of members here with different rules depending on whose      you kiss. I find it interesting that those of you who love to take liberties and shots at the 'unworthy' ones, do absolutely nothing to contribute to the community (fishing for Tyler/for a cure). You just take. You give zero.  So let's give that theory a little test now shall we?"

Is there an actual law that says they can't go on the ice, or did they disobey an order from police ??  I'm not being a smart azz, but although what they did was totally reckless and maybe even stupid, I believe it was still totally legal.  Or did I miss something ??"
675775,NAW,2012-03-13 20:39:00,4022,Charged under the criminal code.. No likely.  Fined at a municipal level for the use of emergency services.  Hopefully.
675782,lew,2012-03-13 20:48:00,12766," I worked in emergency services for many years and saw alot of bad stuff happen because of lack of smarts, but I don't ever recall an incident where folks were charged because we responded.  I'm certainly not defending these guys, I just don't see how they can legally be charged with anything, but then again, I'm not a lawyer."

You get in an accident, your insurance company gets a bill for the service supplied by the fire deparment.  OR atleast that what they're trying to do, not sure if it's passed yet.  How is this any different.  Car accidents are ""accidents""..  Ice fisherman on thin ice, in crappy conditions, in my opinion, is not an accident."
675791,lew,2012-03-13 21:02:00,12766,"Thanks for the info NAW, that's interesting.  I've been retired 12 years now and wasn't aware of that sorta thing and honestly don't agree with it, but I spose that's a topic for another day.  We already pay a fee when transported by ambulance, now were gonna pay for a fire truck so I guess next we'll also pay for the police to be there too.  Kinda makes me wonder what we're paying taxes for"
675792,bigugli,2012-03-13 21:04:00,6138,There are big sections of the CCOC which can be applied.  The criminal code is not that black and white. It was always written with lots of room for interpretation. You can be guilty of negligence by your actions or a failure to act. It can be with or without intent. Did their actions put others at risk? The rescuers were placed at risk Did their actions result in damage to property or loss of revenue? Taxpayer money was wasted and public equipment damaged. Was not a minor also placed at risk? A 12 year old boy.  More than adequate grounds for criminal or civic charges.
675795,kickingfrog,2012-03-13 21:30:00,8333, No it did not pass last year. It might come up again. I believe the main focus was fire crews on car accident scenes.

675803,d_paluch,2012-03-13 22:13:00,343," I'm with you on that 100%!  I mean, if they charge people for a ride in an ambulance....  If they are not charged under the CC, than they should at least be charged a fine for all of the emergency vehicles that needed to be used. It is one thing if it is an 'accident', but these people should know better, hell, especially after what happened late last week... they are really giving ice fisherman a bad rep..."

I read the article like most or everyone here and have no other info except what I read....plain and simple....  However, MOST here want to be judge and jury and hang some fellow anglers when you know mostly NOTHING what really transpired on that ice except for what some ill-informed reported wrote....hell, their names were not even reported by said bad reporter. That alone shows you how much investigated reporting this NON NAME Reporter did.  I don't know, but MAYBE just maybe they were on the ice to recover one of their ice huts....what if it was your hut....would you be out there to hopefully bring it back to shore ?  We as angler and hunters need to embrace each other and stand by each other as both of these sports are on a continualas attack by the famous tree hugging nutcases.  And as far as charging them $$$ and also charging them for some kind of criminal or whatever is REDICKULAUS IMHO....these same anglers are also being charge HIGH taxes like the rest of us....so now they need government assistance and you're all in favour of them pay even more money now is crazy....  What is next.....let's say you have a 14' tinny and you go out fishing on Simcoe but it's a bit rough....but you intend to stay on the edge of the bay where many walleyes hang out on a breezy day....but today your little outboard fails you and you go a drift into even larger waves and have to be rescued.....should you have to pay for your rescue mission also....What should be the wave limit on a 14' boat, a 16' boat or a 20' boat....should the already over powered government have a say on this also....  Why crack open this can of worms.....it will only come back to HAUNT you in the end....for cry out loud....don't we all PAY too much for too little already from our government officials.....isn't this EXACTLY why we pay them already ? ? ?  Let's just be glad that this wasn't a worse ending and hopefully many have learned by it....of course there will be others that didn't read or hear about this next year....but they are still our fishing brothers, are they not....
