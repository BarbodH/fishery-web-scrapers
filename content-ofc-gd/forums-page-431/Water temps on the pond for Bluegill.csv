I usually hit a local pond which is teaming with Bluegill (on a good spring day, I can hit 20-50 in 2-3hrs, I wade a pond!). Bluegills aren't so big but they are surprisingly aggressive. Last year, the thaw didn't occur till April and they didn't start hitting till mid-April. This year would seem to be different, my question is what water temp is ideal for bluegill to start hitting.  Other than that, what about Pike and Catfish! (temps) I was able to land pike at a river spot, May/June but not a lick in Summer, seems like they like cooler water.  Thanks all"
