674950,nancur373,2012-03-10 23:08:00,1211,Got a trailer on Pigeon Lake. Want to get out for crappie in the boat. Is there still ice up there?
674953,lew,2012-03-10 23:22:00,12766,I'm just a few miles east of Pigeon  at Clear Lake and from what I can see from here it appears to still be fully covered in ice so I'm guessing Pigeon will be similar ??  I could sure be wrong though.
674955,Kawartha Kev,2012-03-10 23:26:00,281,Here's a webcam from Lower Buckhorn main channel has been clear for a while but freezes up when it gets cold  Lower Buckhorn Webcam and here is a link to the resorts website where you can check the webcam from it updates regularily through the day Reach Harbour Lower Buckhorn
674963,nancur373,2012-03-10 23:49:00,1211,Thanks guys. Hope this warm weather this week wrecks havoc on the ice
674975,ecmilley,2012-03-11 00:56:00,2163,since there was 18-20 inches last week in the main areas you could be waiting another 2 weeks at least
675019,Jer,2012-03-11 12:26:00,1426,It'll be a couple weeks at least. Last year we got out the 1st of April and that was an early ice-out...
675029,Beans,2012-03-11 15:16:00,3339, Lots of ice on the lake (north end) still...I hope to get down by the shoreline this afternoon to take a few pictures...will post them here...  Nogies Creek is open water but the bay is basically ice covered...  The only open lake water I have seen so far is at the mouth of the river in town and it extends quite a ways out into the lake...No fishing in the river below the dam to the mouth until the third Saturday in May (fish sanctuary)...
675037,nancur373,2012-03-11 15:38:00,1211,Thanks Beans...look forward to the pics.
675038,Sinker,2012-03-11 15:40:00,8692,"How much open water is up around nogies? The small launch there might be open, no?  I just put my ice gear away, now going to get the boat ready. I was already out in it once in Feb, now I gotta get her out in march, so I can claim the fame of all 12 months in the water  S."
675039,nancur373,2012-03-11 15:41:00,1211,"And for the record, I'm on Floods Dr. at Sandshell Trailer Park. East side of the lake."
675047,Beans,2012-03-11 16:14:00,3339, Hey Shane...I have to take my garbage to the dump this afternoon and will bring my camera with me and take a couple of shots off the bridge at Nogies along with some shots off our private park on Taites Bay...  I'm guessing the launch in town below the dam on the north side of the river is free of ice as the river is wide open and the open water extends way out in the lake...  Two shots of Nogie Launch         
675093,Beans,2012-03-11 20:44:00,3339,Two shots looking north from Nogie Bridge        Two shots lookin south from Nogie Bridge        Last but not least...A view from our Launch (gated)     Sorry about the glare in the pics...hard to get good pics in the bright sunshine unless it is at my back...
675098,Siderli,2012-03-11 21:44:00,13," Check this site once a day.... identify your lake on map, white still ice.... dark is open water.  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/modis.cgi/modis?region=o&page=1"
675136,Sinker,2012-03-12 01:06:00,8692,Thanks for taking the time Beans.  Looks like its going to be a while before the boat will go in on that end of the lake. Maybe Gannons narrows has a little more open water. I'll have to go for a drive and see!  S.
675216,Billy Bob,2012-03-12 11:45:00,5865," When I had my cottage at Chautauqua Lake, I had one year that the ice left real early.....fished walleyes on the north end of the lake in my boat on March 13th (walleye closes here on March 16th) in the morning (caught 1 walleye), then fished for crappies (caught many crappies) at the south end of the lake....and from what I hear, this year I could do the same thing....only problem, my boat is stuck in storage until maybe late this week....but I'm trying to pry her out... ...we are expecting lost of NICE weather here for most of this week...."
675220,nancur373,2012-03-12 12:01:00,1211,Thanks Beans
675222,nancur373,2012-03-12 12:05:00,1211,Sid. Looks like only great lakes in that link. But I am looking on my phone so might not be right. Will check on the lap top later
675242,Siderli,2012-03-12 13:36:00,13,  On a laptop you can see very clear even small lakes.
675357,jimmer,2012-03-12 18:44:00,2730,"Gannons Narrows was wide open all winter. The rest of the lake still has ice. It will be awhile before the main part of the lake opens up. The lower end has some open areas, but again, the areas that had over 14"" will take awhile to break up. The old river bed will be the first to go. The water level is still way down, so most of the launches would be useless, other than Gannons Narrows Marina maybe."
675440,nancur373,2012-03-12 21:52:00,1211,Ok Sid. Works waaaay better on the laptop. Thanks again. Page bookmarked.
