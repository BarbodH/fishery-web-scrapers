675333,ckrb2007,2012-03-12 18:12:00,449,I bought a few spools just to use as backing on my reels. Can't go wrong for the price!
675335,davey buoy,2012-03-12 18:15:00,5505, I guess you were backing up your pin?
675341,ckrb2007,2012-03-12 18:26:00,449," No, I use it on my baitcasters.....mostly for the flippin' and pitching reels where I don't want to spool 150yds of braid on them. I know you asked about float fishing, but I'm just adding my 2 cents about what I use it for.  Cheers, Colin"
675344,cheaptackle,2012-03-12 18:28:00,849,Make sure the spool matches the box - there was a post (last year?) about getting it home to find the box was marked 10# test but contained something different.  Otherwise I haven't heard anything terrible about it for a mono line.  Michael
675346,davey buoy,2012-03-12 18:29:00,5505," Great idea!,I usually just fill mine up with what ever braid I'm using."
675347,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-12 18:30:00,2690,"  Interesting, I haven't heard anything good about it.  Terrible memory, about the only thing it would be good for is, maybe, backing."
675349,davey buoy,2012-03-12 18:34:00,5505, So that's what it will be then. Thanks.
675372,Roy,2012-03-12 18:59:00,13728,"It's terrible line. Don't buy it unless you're using it as backing or you can buy one spool of the 14# tough, to make walleye spinners. It's all it's good for."
675396,Bernie66,2012-03-12 20:13:00,123,"If you want a decent mono, they have the 600yds spool of trilene XL for $5. Good deal."
675397,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-12 20:14:00,2690,"  Yup, now one of those I did grab.  Not my first choice in line, but, decent enough especially at that price."
675398,davey buoy,2012-03-12 20:15:00,5505," Didn't see it ,thanks,I go by everyday,will pick some up!."
675442,danbouck,2012-03-12 22:01:00,4380,I buy about 5 spools per year for backing. You will find it's mostly 10# and 17#
675450,bushart,2012-03-12 22:23:00,2628,I bought one spool once...there will not be a twice
675452,Bassnbows,2012-03-12 22:26:00,58,"Yes, this line really sucks, but a good idea for backing."
675801,spinnerbaitking,2012-03-13 22:08:00,1622,"Agree it sucks bought some for our 4-H Fishing clubs members, got it home & it was rotten, might have been OK for backing I guess but how much of that do you need Tight Lines SBK"
675819,krixxer,2012-03-13 22:56:00,274,corkscrew line
675979,IFCFY,2012-03-14 03:51:00,21,Good deal!
675989,steel&chrome,2012-03-14 04:35:00,46,"Line's only good for backing, its still proabaly cheaper anyways if they put backing on for you, but ur going to have to bring the reel in...I use alot of suffix and find it to be outstanding...very little memory, supple, and just an overall good line  hope this helps!  S&C"
676005,davey buoy,2012-03-14 08:40:00,5505,There's been plenty of debate of how good or not Suffix is:whistling:
