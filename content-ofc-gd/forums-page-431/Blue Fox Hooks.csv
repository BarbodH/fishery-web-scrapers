674567,SirCranksalot,2012-03-09 17:55:00,3291,"I have a very specific question: When I but theses they have a single hook included in the pkg, but it's not obvious how to change from treble to single. How do you take them apart? Do they unscrew somehow or otherwise disassemble? thx"
674571,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-09 18:00:00,2690,Sounds more like Blue Fox spinners than Little Cleos???

674578,SirCranksalot,2012-03-09 18:11:00,3291,Thx---I corrected the title
674579,BillM,2012-03-09 18:14:00,17367,"You need to cut them off, loop on the single hook then squeeze the eye of the hook shut."
674613,tonyb,2012-03-09 19:38:00,1637,"I cut off the factory hooks, then add a small split ring (size #0 or #1) and better hooks on Panther Martins, I'm sure you could do the same thing on the Foxies  I had a hard time finding small split rings at local tackle shops when I looked, but you can certainly order them in-store or online."
674652,bassjnkie,2012-03-09 21:58:00,1101,I second the split ring. Make life easier.
674669,solopaddler,2012-03-09 23:43:00,8605,"X3. Cut off the treble and add a tiny split ring.  I can't understand why so many lures don't have split rings, it's a pita."
674681,drwxr,2012-03-10 00:07:00,453,i bough a pack of 50 spinner steel shafts for under $5 and just remake them with split rings.
674740,Sinker,2012-03-10 02:14:00,8692,"I find the split ring makes for a better hook up, and action, if your using a plastic on the single hook. I hate putting them on, though!!!  S."
675816,SirCranksalot,2012-03-13 22:46:00,3291," BM, My first response to this was ""You gotta be  kiddin'"". Then I looked at a Blue F and noticed the gap in the eye of the single hook and realized that you're quite right. I just think it's a wee bit odd that the Foxes come with a single replacement hook whereas other lures that have a split ring, making it easy to change hooks, don't come with a spare hook.  Anyway, thx BM and others others who posted. Mystery solved"
675827,BillM,2012-03-13 23:25:00,17367,"  No prob man, I remembered the first time I went to put on a single hook (due to regulations) and thought to myself... How the heck do I get this one off?  I thought maybe you could twist the body, or like on the olds Mepps slide the body up and over, remove old hook, slide the new one on, then slide the body back down etc..  Nope, not on these spinners!  LOL!"
