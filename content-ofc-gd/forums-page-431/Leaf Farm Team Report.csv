675240,Radnine,2012-03-12 13:31:00,1538,"I went down to the Marlies vs. Hamilton Bulldogs game on Friday night and noted the following: - Best Marlie hands down: Colton Orr (first goal, fight, third star of the game) - Scrivens looked very good - #29 D'amicho also looked tough and good - Kadri was invisible. Complete crap - Won't play in the NHL (IMHO) - The Bulldogs never were a threat - The captain of the Marlies (Hamilton, I think his name was) looked gritty and good, but too small perhaps? Jim"
675256,Lunatic,2012-03-12 14:21:00,536,"I think kadri needs a fresh start somewhere else , I think all of Wilsons negativity and tossing kadri under the bus ruined his confidence, also don't think you can judge a player by watching one game."
675258,fishin' magician,2012-03-12 14:27:00,10,The marlies would stand a better chance of making the offs than the Leafers. Maybe they should just switch?
675259,Radnine,2012-03-12 14:30:00,1538, You can if you're gifted. He's done. Jim
675260,Radnine,2012-03-12 14:31:00,1538," I meant to mention him, he looked decent too. Jim"
675262,BillM,2012-03-12 14:36:00,17367,"The kid is 22 years old, calling him 'done' is pretty hilarious, lol!  He'll play in the NHL guaranteed."
675271,dobee,2012-03-12 15:12:00,301,"i was there also.. i was behind the penalty box..  I went down to the Marlies vs. Hamilton Bulldogs game on Friday night and noted the following: - Best Marlie hands down: Colton Orr (first goal, fight, third star of the game) - he played great, - Scrivens looked very good didnt have to work alot for the shutout - Kadri was invisible. Complete crap - Won't play in the NHL (IMHO) i dont think he hit one person the whole game. i think he whines more than my neice. - The Bulldogs never were a threat they played terrible - The captain of the Marlies (Hamilton, I think his name was) looked gritty and good, but too small perhaps? also, zigomanis played great too.   Bill, if you saw how kadri played friday night you may have a different opinion. he was the smallest guy on the ice, and didnt go into any corners, hes gonna have to re-vamp his game to be effective in the NHL..  jeff finger - 3.5m/yr and hes in the AHL!! yikes!"
675276,Grimace,2012-03-12 15:21:00,2020,Kadri won't ride the bike or work out.  He is reported to be quite lazy.  That makes sense to me because I worked with two of his uncles and they were by far two of the laziest people I have ever come across.  We use to joke that they were too lazy to shiver when it was cold out.
675389,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-12 20:03:00,4399,I guess the future is bright when Colton Orr is your best player!
675392,davey buoy,2012-03-12 20:07:00,5505,"Looks like a promising future! Sorry guys,and I'm a beleafer."
