I heard Bayfront has some pike so me and a bud decided to try it out. We purchased some minnows and off we went. We were casting out towards the private marina docks and letting our minnows drift off closer to them. We also threw out some Rapalas and reeled them in at a reduced rate. Nothing. Eventually we started doing some research on our phones and heard there may be some trout near the mouth of Grindstone Creek. We drove down there and threw some minnows out again. At one point a seagull dove down 4 feet and grabbed my minnow! I should have set the hook and put on a show for the crowd. We even headed back out to Bayfront for the ""evening bite"" - got peppy le peu'ed all day, not even a sniff.  Can anyone give some pointers on where to locate some pike? Any information would be great. If anyone can shed some light on the trout at Grindstone that would be great too, when do they start there run and where are some decent spots to try and catch a couple?  Thanks "
