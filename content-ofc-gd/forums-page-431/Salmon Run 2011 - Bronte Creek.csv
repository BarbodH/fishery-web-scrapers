675371,d_paluch,2012-03-12 18:59:00,343,"amazing video! Makes Bronte look...beautiful!  Question though, at the 2:15 mark, what fish is that that swims by? See them all over Bronte, never caught one and they are very easily spooked."
675375,davey buoy,2012-03-12 19:04:00,5505," I saw that to,I don't know what that was?. A single fish by itself."
675377,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-12 19:10:00,0,looked like a sucker to me.
675379,davey buoy,2012-03-12 19:15:00,5505,"If that's a sucker,that is not what I thought I was catching in the river a year or two ago."
675381,Pigeontroller,2012-03-12 19:32:00,2793,More interesting is at 2:45-2:51 what looks to be a smolt Rainbow?
675383,davey buoy,2012-03-12 19:45:00,5505,"I think the 2:15 was a sucker,the 2;45 was the one I didn't know?"

675405,d_paluch,2012-03-12 20:25:00,343, I hear yah on that one lol
675648,Jon,2012-03-13 16:17:00,209,Great video! Underwater shots always give us surface dwellers a completely different perspective of what is really happening under the surface. What gear did you use to get the underwater video?  First non-salmonid (2:15 mark) is a White Sucker. Second (2:47) I'm not sure about.  Jon
675673,BillM,2012-03-13 17:29:00,17367,Fish at 2:47 is a rainbow smolt.
