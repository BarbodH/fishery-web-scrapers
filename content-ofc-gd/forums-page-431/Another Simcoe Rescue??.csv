675943,solopaddler,2012-03-14 02:11:00,8605,"On another note, how 'bout them Leafs?  Maybe we could combine the two topics and get a really interesting discussion going.   "
675944,mercman,2012-03-14 02:14:00,7054,  Jeez yer bad !!!!!!!!!!!!!
675945,Dan668,2012-03-14 02:19:00,1120,Leafs is old news. Wheels fell off that bandwagon long time ago
675950,woodenboater,2012-03-14 02:32:00,2277,"I feel for Carlyle, poor guy but he knew he what he was getting into. Kinda related (but not really), I hope Crosby is well and truly ok, medically speaking, but I'm scurred for him."
675952,Sinker,2012-03-14 02:38:00,8692,the guys rescued were leafs players?? Say wut??  S.
675959,solopaddler,2012-03-14 02:47:00,8605,  Actually what happened was the ice in Florida cracked and broke tonight under the weight of the oppression crushing the Leafs.  They couldn't breath let alone skate and had to be saved by local paramedics and a team of off duty SWAT members attending the game.  Sad really....
675967,Sinker,2012-03-14 03:14:00,8692,"Did they have to pay to get saved, i wonder?   Who would get the bill...the team? Or each guy?  Sounds fishy to me"
