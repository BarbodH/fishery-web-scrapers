675419,tonka-toy,2012-03-12 21:07:00,139,A friend went out to BC last fall and told me the most popular set-up he saw was a 10 1/2 -11 foot rod with a small bait-caster.Does anyone have any experience useing this type of set-up on smaller warer situations?I often use a bit heavier combo for chuckin spoons and bottom fishing but wonder if with the right gear could you have agood all rounder.
675420,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-12 21:12:00,10439,You need a decent amount of flow in order for the baitcasting setups to work for float fishing. This is why they are popular out West. The rivers out this way are mostly high volume/high gradient waterways that work well with baitcating outfits.
675422,davey buoy,2012-03-12 21:16:00,5505,"With the sometimes slow drift here,the spool diameter may have a hard time free spooling,unlike the diameter of a float reel."
675426,solopaddler,2012-03-12 21:20:00,8605,I'll disagree with Dave on this one. I believe he likely was correct back when baitcasters were inferior.  These days I see tons of guys using baitcasters for floatfishing on the river and they seem to be holding their own quite handily. Most guys will still use 12-13' blanks but have them custom tied with a spiral twist to the guides.  The most popular albeit expensive reel for this purpose seems to be the Calcutta TE's. Super smooth and light and you can cast light rigs with them a mile.
675427,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-12 21:24:00,10439,"  That's my problem!!!! I don't own a bait caster newer than the mid 80's!!!!!   :rofl2: Still don't think they would work worth beans on slower froggy water though. Maybe the Credit, Ganny etc but can't see it on the lower Willy or Bowmanville S bends."
675428,davey buoy,2012-03-12 21:26:00,5505," Me too,I stand corrected."
675429,Joeytier,2012-03-12 21:28:00,3990,"Up on the larger Georgian/Huron tribs with lots of flow they are quite popular, and are definitely in their element with that sort of application."
675430,misfish,2012-03-12 21:29:00,29133," I have one that would fit the bill Dave. I can deliver,if you will pay air charges?Me and the reel.Return trip is up to me."
675435,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-12 21:36:00,10439, Right!!! Stuff yourself into a cardboard box with one of these Shimano CTE-401's and drop yourself off at the post office and I'll pay for the postage as long as it's not more than a hundred bucks.
675454,davey buoy,2012-03-12 22:34:00,5505," All kidding aside,I have a late 90's spider stinger,but today almost bought a caenan,almost!"
675461,kickingfrog,2012-03-12 22:54:00,8333,Sometimes its fun just to watch the looks from the floaters when you fish a beat with a baitcaster.
675520,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-13 02:50:00,2690,"Used to know an older gentleman named Jim, fished mostly the Saugeen and at times Sauble.  He had two trademarks, one a big stogie, the other a baitcaster set up for float fishing.  Yes, he caught many fish."
675526,Ainsley,2012-03-13 03:17:00,142,I use a baitcaster for floating on the Niagara.
675552,Musky or Specks,2012-03-13 10:24:00,2710,Until I sold my custom rod last fall. This was the way I float fished since 90. The secret with the old baitcaster was to rip out the anti backlash magnets and remove the spool tension spring. But with the newer reels thats not needed as the spool move very freely. No reel advantage in the actual execution of a drift but I feel there was a advantage in fighting the fish. I used a 10lb XT mainline and was able to whip most steel like a rented mule. As far as frogwater my first choice  for fishing was always the lower Notty and while there is some current it very low gradient and I never really had any problems achieving a drift.  Not a good pick but here my old kit  
675557,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-13 11:23:00,3761, Glad you didn't. Take a cast or just spin the spool...then squeeze the reel a little and watch the spool stop. Got to love those.
675592,Harrison,2012-03-13 13:44:00,2202," ha! Can't fish anything else but a 28"" ice rod in those spots now anyways.  My bro and I use baitcasters on the Ganny and some parts of Duffins.  I prefer a spin or pin tho."
