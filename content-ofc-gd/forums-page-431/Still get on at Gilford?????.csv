675622,Bigworm,2012-03-13 15:07:00,119,I know it is warm but anyone know if you can still get on at Gilford?
675626,BillM,2012-03-13 15:36:00,17367,Look at the weather and decide if you think it's still a good idea to be out on the ice...
675630,whiskywizard,2012-03-13 15:42:00,305,"  If you go out from Gilford, don't go farther north than the abandonned fishing gear that's floating there."

675655,bushart,2012-03-13 16:32:00,2628,I'm thinkin shorts and sandals soon with these temps.  This is an official old guy alert-----A lot of times ice does'nt get thin---it just goes rotten
675676,Pikeslayer,2012-03-13 17:33:00,1443, NO
675680,RickOnt,2012-03-13 17:39:00,669,"Sunday the Ice was black,  Sunday Temp +16'C  Monday Temp + 16'C  Tuesday Temp +12'C   After last nights major rain there is zero water on top and the ice is white and Very Porous looking.  You figure it out from there!!!  Rick"
675682,johnnyb,2012-03-13 17:42:00,3413,Today is the last day Peter from CBFB is posting reports....he officially deems the ice unsafe after this.  Also hearing of more guys being rescued today.  
675691,kickingfrog,2012-03-13 17:55:00,8333,Two guys were just rescued off of a flow today.
675732,glen,2012-03-13 18:57:00,2641,Is it a rescue?  Maybe some people just think it is a ride back in.  Honey i'm home. I got a ride in a helicopter today.  Maybe tomorrow it will be an air boat.  If its a west wind can you pick me up in beaverton?
675740,LefroyFisherman,2012-03-13 19:08:00,602,LOL Glen! that's what it seems like for these people
675746,davey buoy,2012-03-13 19:25:00,5505,"I take it you got your answer, be safe and stay away!"
675752,Joey,2012-03-13 19:42:00,9122,"Well I can't believe they would let them bring any of their fishing gear with them on the boat or helicopter, so it is a pretty expensive ride"
675886,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-14 00:54:00,4399,  Your kidding right? Ice fishermen
