Also does anyone have a clue what they normally pay out on these kind of vehicles? I know it won't be much, just kind of looking for a ball park idea."

675776,jedimaster,2012-03-13 20:42:00,3472,If its driving you can drive it down to Hamilton and they will pay you by the pound for the scrap steel. I think that will likely net you the best return. I would think 200-500 dollars is within the ballpark dending on the price of steel right now. I would call them to make sure first. Wentowrth recycling 905-527-1707
