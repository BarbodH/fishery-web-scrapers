I spooled up a couple of reels with it and used it yesterday and today. Yesterdays temp topped out at about -3C with no wind and sunny skies. Today it was a bunch colder -19C with 25kmh winds and more sun. This line is nice and slick and doesn't absorb water at all. Unlike regular braids. Power Pro Ice Braid is a good ice line and it doesn't ice up nearly as much as the regular Power Pro. Having said that, this Tuff Line is better!!  I noticed that it is a little wirey and has some memory in the cold but not really any worse than most mono lines. It candles like any other line but unlike regular braid you can strip off the candle ice just as easily as mono.  What I really like about the line is that because it doesn't hold water like regular braid it doesn't ice up on the spool or the line roller on my spinning reels. This is a huge bonus as when reeling in a fish regular braid intstantly freezes as soon as you stop reeling and you need to pull line off by hand in order to free it up and continue reeling.  I didn't notice the line get any more wirey today with the big drop in temp since yesterday.  The only small issue I found was when tying heavy flouro to it with a back to back uni when tightening up the flouro and sliding the knot together it would strip the coating off if you were not carefull.  So far after 2 outings Duracast braid is getting   from me. I'll try and remember to give an update at the end of the season on how it performs over the long term. But for now it is my new favorite ice line."

663934,Dabluz,2012-02-06 04:34:00,701, It lasts about as long as the coating on SpiderLine.
663985,Harrison,2012-02-06 13:28:00,2202,"I was looking forward to your review Dave as you fish in the harshest conditions up there and would pull no punches.  I am glad you liked the line and it held up to some of the hype mentioned here. Thanks for taking the time to post and the heads up on tying a thicker leader and a uni.  I haven't had this issue, but I only use 8 and 10lb Flouro.  As for the coating Kickingfrog, on the reels I have spooled up it since last spring I have yet to show any loss of coating. Even on my jerkbait set up and it gets a work out in the fall."
675942,Sharkbait22,2012-03-14 02:10:00,297,Looking forward to trying DuraCast line on a new rod/reel. According to their website 6lb is 2 lb equivalent and breaks at 13lbs. Weird. Comes in green or yellow. I've been using Nanofil this season for ice fishing and have no complaints except that it is snow white. It too has low water retention.  Some ice still forms but it busts off easily. For softwater I hope to give Seaguar Senshi a try. Now where to find either of these lines in Canada.
675948,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-14 02:27:00,10439,  I got my Duracast from Phil @ etackle.ca
675949,solopaddler,2012-03-14 02:31:00,8605,"  Me too.   I decided to give it a whirl myself and so far so good. It's ""maybe"" a tad bit thicker than some of the other braids but fishes very very well."
