675821,GBW,2012-03-13 23:03:00,8460,"Hey all.  So I was at BPS to burn off $150 work of G.Cards on the weekend and now i think I need to find me a good worm binder type case for most of my plastics.  Any idea what's good out there (last's long) and at a decent price?  I just started looking at what I have in my 'stock' and OH MAN, I need something to keep it tidy...  Thanks all!  Geoff"
675823,Skipper D,2012-03-13 23:11:00,1970,Thats a binder not a bender ..... right Geoff .........lol.
675832,Andy,2012-03-13 23:30:00,330,"I had two from Storm. They were cheap, plastics bled thru them, so I would never go with them again. The best one I have is the BPS brand that I use for spinnerbaits. The plastic trailers do not bleed thru, heavier all around."
675853,mercman,2012-03-14 00:08:00,7054,"  You really know how to ""BAIT""  someone Skip !!!"
675856,bassjnkie,2012-03-14 00:12:00,1101,"I'm not sure if they are still around, but I bought a bunch of blue double sided zippered BPS worm bags. Never has a problem with them and they hold 40 replaceable bags. They come in different sizes. If you still can find them, I highly recommend these."
675858,tb4me,2012-03-14 00:15:00,3295,I also have the storm ones..No issues here if you leave them in the orignal packages..Going on year 3 now...
675864,GBW,2012-03-14 00:30:00,8460,"Tks  Tks  Too bad I didn't think to look for them when I was there last weekend...  I know the Storm ones were sold all over the place like Princess Auto for next to nothing $ wise and from what I can tell, not too interested in those ones.  Any other ideas/thoughts?  I have grubs and others I need a home for that is easy to cart around, cheers.  PS, Skip and Paul, I don't do that anymore mid week, well, sort of...  I need to be on a train to damn early for that..."
675890,jedimaster,2012-03-14 00:59:00,3472,"I dumped the binders a while ago and started using the plano cases, I find these way more convenient to use in the boat."
675931,GBW,2012-03-14 01:50:00,8460,"Same here but for the short trips in the tinny or a day out in a boat with a buddy it can come in handy, hence the reason I'm looking.  I have over a few dozen of the mid to large plano hard trays I can stuff in a bag but I would rather be light and use less space."
