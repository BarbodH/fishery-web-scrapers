Fishing was good but was hoping to catch a big one this year. My P.B is 5.9lbs, 26"" and this year the biggest I managed was 20"", maybe 3lbs? Oh well, was a really great time. I'm thinking about retiring this spot due to the difficulty getting in there. I'm going to go back to my old spot which is a longer drive but far less work for the same payout. Here are a couple pics."
