598220,Nipfisher,2011-06-30 04:06:00,2449,Very good article. I was a lifeguard for about 5 years and pulled several people from the water. Lots of times the children were close enough to the wall to grab on but never even tried. Worst situations were when parents tried to catch kids at the bottom of the slide or when jumping in. If the child panics and starts pulling down the parent it gets ugly. Called the double clutch. There are stories of people biting fingers off of the the other person becaus they get their hands in the mouth and push down. If you can't swim well then stay where you can touch.
