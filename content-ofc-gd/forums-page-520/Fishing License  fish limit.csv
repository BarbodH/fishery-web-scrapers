597656,Rod Caster,2011-06-28 18:00:00,5784," I'd be more concerned with those who poach rather than those who follow the legal limits, no matter how silly you think the limit laws may be.  I only get pissed (read jealous) at those who keep their limit, when I can't catch my own."
597661,solopaddler,2011-06-28 18:17:00,8605," I'm not saying that's what I actually practice on a regular basis. I'm merely pointing out the legalities.  If however I do want to keep a limit of walleye from both ON and QC I would and wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  There seems to be a newer generation of anglers, weened on merits of catch and release that's shoved down our throats on practically every single fishing show and magazine article.  It's definitely not a bad thing..but when someone is following all the laws and wants to keep his limit or limits then so be it.  Nothing wrong with that at all.  At lot of the holier than thou sentiments from people jumping up on their soapbox smacks of tree hugging, eco-touring, card carrying members of P eta.  But that's just me."
597665,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-28 18:27:00,0," nowhere in what i wrote did i say you can keep multiple limits.  all i stated was that if you fish in zone b and live in zone a, the rules and regs you follow are those of zone b."
597670,fishermccann,2011-06-28 18:52:00,655,Yet you say it like it is a good thing.
597671,dannyboy,2011-06-28 18:59:00,367," Amen and thanks, you have talent to succinctly make common sense - which is none too common."
597673,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 19:04:00,4661,  In most cases I don't even keep my limit of 4 in zone 20... Not cause I can't catch it... Cause I respect  the river that supplies me with fish for the hobby/obsession of fishing...  I would never keep 15 walleye for myself... Cause I can catch enough walleye year round exept spawn times
597680,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 19:31:00,4661,Limits in Boundary Waters Anglers who fish in waters that lie both in Ontario and another province or state must include the total number of fish caught anywhere in those waters as part of the number caught and kept or possessed under the Ontario recreational fishing regulations when bringing those fish into Ontario.  this is from the ontario mnr regs
597682,fishermccann,2011-06-28 19:33:00,655,That is the answer that I was waiting ( wanting) to hear. Thanks.
597687,CanadianShark,2011-06-28 19:39:00,13,"So back to my original question about fish limits   when i am finished my trip in Quebec and i come back onto Ontario soil,  with a cooler with 8 fish according to Quebec limit  as long as I have proper up to date  license from quebec I should have no problems??????  am i correct"
597689,BillM,2011-06-28 19:43:00,17367,"Yes, you should be fine."
597692,johnnyb,2011-06-28 19:52:00,3413," So...as long as I don't tell the truth on either side of the border, I'm good to go?"
597701,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-28 20:23:00,0,Sounds to me that you can only keep what you are only allowed where you live when traveling home after a vacation when it comes to different limits in different areas. The fish caught in area 'A' stay in area 'A' and so on if the limit is less where you live when it comes to being kept and possessed anyway...  Even with having both permits. So if the limit is 5 in the US and only 2 here....you can only bring two home then?...lol....  Man....where's the interpreter when ya need one.
597711,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 20:46:00,4661,i just got off the phone with the ontario mnr enforcment division  border water...  example lake erie... you cannot catch a ny state limit and a ontario limit... this is a fairly new rule... aparently you could do this before but not anymore   camping trip to quebec...  you can bring back you possession limit according to quebec rules and regs but a bit of proof would be a wise decision... have your quebec licence on you and a receipt from a gas station or something to back up your story of where you caught the fish...   zone to zone in ontario...   traveling from a zone where you caught the fish to a zone where you live... you get benifit of the doubt that they were caught where you say... so in other words... the example of lake O limit of 5 and when you get back to port with 5 and the limit where you dock is 2... your ok   and last but not least... you cannot keep a limit from several different zones unless the total amount is under the largest ontario limit... i am paraphrasing ...  exampl... lake erie you can keep 6 walleye so if you get caught with 6 walleye in your freezer anywhere in ontrio... and you say they are from lake erie... they arent gunna prove otherwise  keep in mind this is my interpretation of a 15 minute conversatoin with the guy whos job it is to clear up these questions. there is a bit of grey area in the rules but from what i understand... this is the way it is...   so hopefully this ends this he said she said nonsense...
597725,solopaddler,2011-06-28 21:06:00,8605,"  Not surprisingly you're not getting it. Who's talking about boundary waters? The majority of the people who chimed in, myself included, aren't talking about boundary waters.  The point in question is keeping multiple limits from different provinces or states assuming you're carrying current licenses for each specific area.  And in turn potentially having your possesion limit from each area in your freezer at home."
597727,solopaddler,2011-06-28 21:12:00,8605,  Yes!       Sorry but your interpretation is wrong.  I can have a limit of walleye from both ON and QC in my freezer. If I for whatever reason got questioned by a CO the onus is on me to prove where the walleye came from which I surely would.  There would be no charges laid and if there were they wouldn't get very far with them.  If you have no proof of what you're saying then yeah you're screwed.
597729,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-28 21:18:00,0,"solo is correct.  the fisheries are managed on a provincial level.  fish from quebec are not only not in his fmz, they are of another provinces jurisdiction, and an entirely different licensing system and limit.  funny thing about what the enforcement branch told you is that people have been repeating since the first page of this thread."
597733,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 21:37:00,4661,  i did not say anythin about keeping limits from more than one province or country when its not from bordering waters...
597734,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 21:41:00,4661,  muliple questions have come up in ther thread as well as false information... what i put in my post after talking to a mnr rep is from what i understand to be true... if you dont understand what i posted feel free to call the mnr and tell me how is was wrong... after i talked to the mnr of course... i will admit some of the previous posts were wrong but on the safe and legal side...
597746,smally21,2011-06-28 22:00:00,993,"thanks for putting the time and effort into finding an actual answer  musky mike, as opposed to just telling everyone how you think it is or should be. or what your cousins hairdressers uncle heard from a guy in a bar.  you certainly dont seem to be getting rewarded for your efforts...."
597749,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 22:06:00,4661, in fairness... earlier in the thread i was incorrect... however the advice i was giving was at least legal and a bit on the safe side...  corvette said he limits in usa and then limits in ontario on lake erie on the same day... and the COs say thats ok...  but its not ok anymore... this rule has changed... so at least a couple people including myself should lean from this thread
597805,corvette1,2011-06-29 00:55:00,1765,i just talked our co he said catch your limit put your fish in your cooler in your truck then you can go back out fish ont waters get your limit if you get pulled over and your gps shows you wern't in can water your screwed buy the way i its not a every day thing i caught 5 in twenty minutes so i went to the can side for my can limit on another note charter boats take six people out and take every fish they catch if its 36 10 lb fish they are all kept every day out i did it once last and im a hog i paid for my license its up to you if you keep your fish buy the way i fished quinte for 10 years straight every weekend never kept a fish and i had 50 fish weekends
597812,mike rousseau,2011-06-29 01:14:00,4661, fisherman in ontario... you know the O in OFC cannot do this... perhaps in ny state where you live but we arent allowed
597944,fishermccann,2011-06-29 14:14:00,655,See post# 63
597946,Governator,2011-06-29 14:21:00,879,I think Musky Mike pretty much cleared it all up as well as solo's post below it.
597174,Homer Is King,2011-06-27 13:58:00,305,"I agree, that can't be right. The limits has to apply to where the fish were caught.  What about slot size. If I catch a big walleye ( > 50 cm ) in FMZ 16 and then bring it back to FMZ 17 where I live it's now illegal? Doesn't sound right."
597175,Fisherman,2011-06-27 14:00:00,7201,"Now I'm beginning to understand why we have bad drivers, bad boaters, etc.  No common sense.  I guess half the province is poaching or illegally transporting.  I think we need a couple of oak plank emoticons for the thick ones."
597249,corvette1,2011-06-27 16:57:00,1765,i fish lake erie i take 5 from us waters and 6 from can side co says do you have both licences yes i do your good to go
597264,mike rousseau,2011-06-27 17:43:00,4661, That's very interesting...  Kinda makes possession limits look obsolete tho
597281,fishermccann,2011-06-27 18:20:00,655,
597284,solopaddler,2011-06-27 18:42:00,8605,  Unequivocally wrong.  My camp is on the border of both Ontario and Quebec. I fish both sides of the border regularly.  I'm entitled to keep limits from both areas and can have them in my possession....anywhere....as long as I have current licenses for both areas.  I've asked CO's from both provinces in that region this question and have received the same response from both.
597313,fishermccann,2011-06-27 20:14:00,655,"SO, an invisible line lets you to keep limits from both sides, Or just the higher limit?  If you can keep both limits,sorry but that is just WRONG!"
597335,solopaddler,2011-06-27 21:12:00,8605,"  NO, having a current license for both provinces allows you to keep two limits.  Please explain in detail your reasoning on why this is so WRONG."
597575,BillM,2011-06-28 13:50:00,17367," You pay for a license in both provinces, you are entitled to fish from each.  I don't see an issue with that."
597583,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 14:03:00,4661,so were i am i can fish ontario usa and quebec within a 10 minute boat ride of each other...  so  if i buy all three licences i can keep all three limits......  weather or not its legal...you guys dont see anything wrong with doing this... its not exactly helping fisheries if people are allowed to do this... cause this means i can harvest  ontario 4 ny state 5 quebec 6  so you guys think its ok for me to harvest 15 walleye (per person) out of the st.lawrence river cause we buy three licences each  so if there is myself and two friends we can harvest 45 walley!!!!!!! and thats ok with you????
597595,canadadude,2011-06-28 14:30:00,769,"sweet my NYS liscence just doubled my limits on Erie, funny though Randy my local CO dosn't see it the same way. He told me if I do that I'm busted, try fighting out in court and good luck."
597597,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 14:36:00,4661, keep in mind that COs will let some situations slide for travel and tousism reasons... im not gunna pay a great lakes guide hundreds of bucks if i can only keep 2.. 5 is a nicer number for the cash...
597598,canadadude,2011-06-28 14:41:00,769,"Good luck with that, I asked the local CO, he laughed and said if your in Ontario waters with 1 fish over the limit your busted, it dosn't matter how many liscenses you have."
597600,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 14:47:00,4661, did you by any chance ask him about zone to zone in ontario?
597601,canadadude,2011-06-28 14:51:00,769,"not yet, he lives around the corner from me so I see him quite often, especially now that Bass season opened up. Unfortunatly this is his busy time around here, lots of unethical poachers on the peirs now."
597609,fishermccann,2011-06-28 15:16:00,655,If I have to explain it then you are too far gone to ever make it back from the dark side.
597633,Governator,2011-06-28 16:31:00,879,"Aren't the limits in place to prevent over fishing of specific areas that we fish?  I don't see why on earth it would matter if we catch the limit of 4 in lake A yet the zone we reside in is a limit of 2.  I would think you should be allowed to take the fish home since you didn't effect any lake within your zone which is the reason for limits, no?  I understand in cases of selling fish illegally, but that's another can of worms."
597636,BillM,2011-06-28 16:40:00,17367, You've got it right...  The zone in which you live in has zero to do with your catch/possession limit from a different zone.
597637,solopaddler,2011-06-28 16:46:00,8605,  Oh really? The dark side?  I would sincerely love to know what you're thinking because what you're intimating doesn't reflect very well on you.
597640,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-28 16:55:00,0,"As stated by bill and others, where you CAUGHT the fish determines the limit, not the zones you pass through.  If a CO charges you, the onus is on the crown to prove where the fish were caught which can be done by genetic sampling.  If for whatever reason the CO didn't believe that the fish were caught in another zone, he could in fact charge you, but it doesn't mean the charges would hold without evidence of where you caught them.  Were you at a lodge or in another province then your atm/credit purchases would more than corroborate your story."
597644,lakerguy,2011-06-28 17:23:00,224,    wow
597649,fishermccann,2011-06-28 17:41:00,655,"What I am thinking is that just because you can do something does not mean you should.When you say, that you will keep all you can , even to go as far as having two or more liciences for the SAME body of water,to me ,that, is just greed."
597651,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-28 17:45:00,0,"don't hate the player, hate the game."
597653,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 17:56:00,4661,  not so  in my case i can fish 3 zones... quebec... ny state... and ontario... all on the st.lawrence river... so  i can keep 15 walleye a day... according to some on this thread... and they cant prove what zones they came from...  genetic sampling would not prove a thing  they would have to witness every single fish i put in my live well all day...
597654,dannyboy,2011-06-28 17:58:00,367, Legally you need two licenses to fish the same body of water if it is part of a provincial or country border and you fish both sides - has nothing to do with greed but responsibly obeying the law. As for keeping ones limit that is also legal which goes back to the original question which was answered in the first response.  Everything else is opinion and conjecture.  Dan
596368,CanadianShark,2011-06-24 20:20:00,13,Hey OFNERS  I am doing my annual fishing trip in Northern Quebec and have a question about fish limits   If i purchase a fishing license for 7 days  from the province of Quebec i believe the daily limit is 8  At the end of the week the number of fish i can bring home is it 8 or is 8 times the number of days for the license which would be 56  I am not planning on clearing out the lake I believe in preserving the fish life for the love of the sport i just want to make sure if i bring home  fish i am not over my limit
596369,BillM,2011-06-24 20:25:00,17367,Your possession limit is 8.  ie your take home.
596371,mike rousseau,2011-06-24 20:30:00,4661,If you are from Ontario and your returning with these fish to Ontario ... The Ontario possession limit is 4 ... Total... So if you get caught with more then 4 you may get a fine... Depends if wether or not th C.O. Believes where you caught the fish...  I'd only bring home 4 per person...
596372,CanadianShark,2011-06-24 20:36:00,13,Thanks for the replies  i didn't think about the limit changing when you cross the provincial boundaries  Even if I still had an active quebec fishing license for the day i would return home????  What happens if the people i am going with don't have an active ontario fishing license when they enter Ontario they just have the quebec license???
596374,beginner,2011-06-24 20:37:00,542,"okay lets say ur limits is 8 in Quebec in a day, that would be also ur limit possesion... so only 8 is allowed... not unless you ate the 8 bass a day then its okay.... but still if you have 8, can't go more than that.."
596384,mike rousseau,2011-06-24 21:40:00,4661, I live in the burmuda triangle of borders... In a day I am in Ontario... USA... And Quebec...  So I asked a CO if I could get a NY state licence and bring home 5 walleye... He said yes as long as I can explain where I caught them... But this would mean im in possession of 5 walleye in ontario... Wich is illigal!!!! You are only allowed to posses 4... But it's one of those situations where it depends on the CO that checks you...  And what kinda moods he is in...
596394,Terry,2011-06-24 22:26:00,14456,that kind of thing is every where because of slot size and and different limits  I have seen where on one side of a bridge I can keep 4 walleye get my limit then fish on the other side and catch 2 more because it's a 6 fish limit on that side and the slots are different to.. better have the video recorder running all day to prove it if the MNR show up
596555,canadadude,2011-06-25 13:06:00,769,"The CO is giving you wrong information, In Ontario you are only allowed to posses 4 Walleye,it dosn't matter if you have a NY state Liscence or not, it dosn't matter where the fish are caught. It's simple 4 walleye only in your possession anymore and your in violation and will be subject to fines"
596916,Fisherman,2011-06-26 20:36:00,7201,"Then by all rights if you are moving from one FMZ to another while transporting fish, you are only allowed to keep the lower of the limits wherever you end up, that's wrong.  Even in Ontario there are areas where you are only allowed 2 walleye and if you reside in a 4 walleye zone, that would mean you could only keep 2, not likely."
596963,canadadude,2011-06-26 23:39:00,769,"If the possession limit in that FMZ is 2 while in that FMZ you can only posses 2 if your caught with 4 you will be fined.It's simple abide by the limits, Daily catch and possession for the area your in."
596988,Fisherman,2011-06-27 00:40:00,7201,"Sorry but you're wrong on that one.  Scenario#1. I went to Vances Resort in Spanish, ON, it's located in FMZ 14, only allowed 2 per day, 4 in possession.  If you go up the Spanish river about 1 km you enter FMZ 10 where you are allowed 4 in possession.  The CO's see people going back and forth all day, no one gets charged. Scenario #2, You go and fish Simcoe for 2 days and catch 100 perch, go home on the 2nd day and you live in Peterboro or anywhere in FMZ 16 that has a limit of 50.  You don't get charged.  Some of the Americans that come to Simcoe in the winter have to travel back through lower limit zones, they don't get charged either."
596994,BillM,2011-06-27 00:53:00,17367,"If you aren't fishing in that specific FMZ, those zone limits don't apply regardless if you drive through it or not."

597049,mike rousseau,2011-06-27 02:45:00,4661,If the possession limit is 2 where you live and you get your freezer checked by a CO and you have more than 2... Your getting a fine... I'd bet my paycheck on that one  Otherwise I could say the 30 walleye in my freezer are from every zone in Ontario... That's not gunna fly with the CO
597083,John Bacon,2011-06-27 04:25:00,3277," No, you couldn't possess more than one limit; but you could possess a limit from the zone with the highest limit... unless the CO had evidence that you caught them in a zone with a lower limit."
597114,Fisherman,2011-06-27 11:25:00,7201,"Your possession limit relates to where you caught the fish, not where you're transporting them, wake up."
597129,mike rousseau,2011-06-27 12:19:00,4661,If your possession limit were you live is 2 and you have 4... You are 100% over you limit!!!!! Plain and simple!!!  Otherwise they might as well make the possession limits province wide cause all you have to do is say they were caught in a zone with a higher limit...
597131,mike rousseau,2011-06-27 12:20:00,4661, Your catch limit yes... Possession limit no
597135,BillM,2011-06-27 12:26:00,17367,"Someone needs to ask a CO, because I think we're all using personal opinions instead of facts, lol.  I can't see how my possession limit is based upon where I live and not where I fish.  That makes zero sense."
597137,canadadude,2011-06-27 12:28:00,769,"possession limits is the number you are allowed to have in your possession on hand,in cold storage,IN TRANSIT, or anywhere. Read the regs"
597139,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-27 12:36:00,0,I can't see the confusion. A Catch limit is for each day. Possesion limit is what you may have in your freezer. Sure the catch and possesion limits change from Zone to Zone.    I think an interpreter is needed....lol
597146,BillM,2011-06-27 12:45:00,17367," ...and you are telling me to read the regs, lol..  'The number depends on the type of licence you hold, the species, the zone in which they are caught and, in some cases, their size. '  So tell me where in the regs it states you possession limit is based upon what zone you live in, regardless of where you actually caught your fish.  If you find it, I'll eat my hat."
597152,canadadude,2011-06-27 12:59:00,769,"It dosn't matter where you live,or where you caught it matters where you are when you are checked.If your in a jurisdiction that only allows a said number of fish to be your possession and you are checked in that jurisdiction if you possess over the number you will be fined.If I'm in Quebec and am allowed to possess 8 walleye great, if I come into Ontario and possess 8 Walleye I'm 4 over the limit and will be fined simple."
597161,snoozer,2011-06-27 13:32:00,7,"So, if I take my boat out on Lake Ontario (Zone 20) I can catch and possess 5 steelhead, but once I set foot on land in Port Hope harbour (Zone 17) I can only possess 2 of those fish?  Doesn't quite make sense to me."
597163,BillM,2011-06-27 13:36:00,17367," According to some people here, that's how it works, lol!!!!  I wonder how many charter boat customers have been charged for being over their limits once they hit shore?   I dunno what to tell you man, except for that's completely inaccurate.  But hey, your fish, your limit you do what you want to do I guess."
