597462,Pangle,2011-06-28 03:04:00,64,"Hi Everyone This is my first post. Managed to get out on Lake O with my new (to me) rig.  Some of you might recognize the boat as I purchased her from a fellow OFC member, Gerritt.  I have to say it was a pleasure doing business with him and all the custom work he put into the boat is simply amazing.   So, we launched out of whitby at 5:30 am and had this king by 6am.  Not a bad start for the maiden voyage!  Actually, this fish was a fluke as I was reeling in to check the line and about half way in this guy hammered my spoon.  He made some impressive runs and stayed down deep.  I'm guessing 20lbs. Now, I normally would give the first fish to my guest but being the first trip I just had to have the honours, lol.    2nd fish came around 9am and weighed in around 17lbs.  His first ever salmon!    Anyhow, a great day on the water with my new rig and neighbour! Thanks for reading.   recap: launch- whitby fow - 80-140 ft down - 50 ft lure - green silver NK, spin doc/fly combo (both on dipsy) speed - 2.6mph    "
597463,Joey,2011-06-28 03:07:00,9122,That's awesome for a maiden voyage.  You got a great boat there that Gerritt put alot of work into.  Congrats on the new ride and the fish
597466,Fisherman,2011-06-28 03:09:00,7201,"Well you can't beat that combo, nice boat and a couple of nice fish to start the day."
597471,Gerritt,2011-06-28 03:19:00,6129,"Awesome Peter!!!! nice to see you got her slimed up!, how did the boat handle for you? any issues? nice wide and stable platform to fish from  I have been waiting for this post from you!  One word of advice, on those Salties, use a bit of sponge to prevent scratching the paint up... it will work wonders (just a suggestion)  Did you get the sounder and GPS figured out on how to use them?  I have changed cell phone providers, so if you have ANY questions at all pm me, and I will provide my new number.  Nice looking FISH!  G."
