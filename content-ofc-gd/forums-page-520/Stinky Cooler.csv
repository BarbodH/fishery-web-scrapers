597506,Fishnwire,2011-06-28 10:19:00,983,I left a cooler at camp with some stuff in it on ice because I was planning on being back within a couple of days...plans changed and I didn't get up there for over a week.  The cooler had some veggies and some cheese in there and now it stinks a little.  It's not over-powering or anything...but there's a definite odor there if you stick your head right in and sniff.  It's a big five-day unit and wasn't cheap...I'd like to try to clean it out before I buy a replacement.  I tried dish soap and warm water...it helped but it's not perfect.  Anyone have any ideas?  (Besides not leaving food in there for over a week.)  Thanks.
597509,turtle,2011-06-28 10:40:00,274,Try bleach and or borax. If it was smaller and older I'd convert it to a boat cooler for fish.

597514,spooner_jr,2011-06-28 10:48:00,193,"pour some pure vanilla extract in a bowl and leave it in the cooler for a week or so.  Just make sure it's the real stuff, not artificial."

597543,Jer,2011-06-28 12:35:00,1426,"Find yourself a good ""bio-enzymatic"" odour digester. Most effective against organic odours. Simply spray the surface down and leave it wet. The next day wash with soap and water.  We have lots of different versions at Swish, but I don't know where you could get any in Sudbury."
597610,bigbuck,2011-06-28 15:16:00,2449,"Put in a 1/4 cup of bleach and fill it up with water  and let it sit for a couple of hours and then empty it out and give it a quick rinse. That way you are killing any bacteria that are in there that are causing the odour. If it still smells, then try one of the other methods, I like the borax method, it will freshen it up BUT kill what is in there first."
597619,bow slayer,2011-06-28 15:44:00,1074,if you know someone who works in healthcare ask them to get you a few wipes of virox(it is used to clean patient rooms in hospitals) it will kill anything in the cooler(bacteria)Then clean with bleach or even lemon juice will work for the odour.
597629,EC1,2011-06-28 16:20:00,930,"Everyone seems to have their own methods, Mine is to use some laundry detergent while washing. I'm going to bet all of these work and just choose the easiest one for you and go for it!"
597631,BillM,2011-06-28 16:23:00,17367,Spray it down with a 50/50 mix of peroxide and water.
597642,Fisherpete,2011-06-28 17:20:00,1814,"Bleach is cheap, and works well. If there are any mildew spots or stains, use a Mr. Clean magic eraser. Just went thru this with my cooler on the weekend... put it away damp a few weeks ago with the lid closed. 'DOH'"
597647,Fishnwire,2011-06-28 17:34:00,983,Wow!  A ton of ideas to choose from!  Thanks.  I'm sure I must have some of the stuff you guys mentioned laying around the house...I'll give something a try and let you guys know how it went.  Thanks again.
597650,Fishnwire,2011-06-28 17:44:00,983,"  Thanks for the suggestion Mercman...but I detest the taste/smell of coffee.  I'd probably rather smell the old cheese odor that's in there now.  I poured some bleach in there, put the cover on and shuck it up...I'll let it sit overnight and scrub it out in the morning before I leave for camp."
597666,bushart,2011-06-28 18:44:00,2628,I know this'll sound obviuos  Hunting Scent Eliminator like Silver XP  My buddy had a trailer fridge with stuff growin in it all summer---probably a cure for cancer in it so much fungus---sprayed the elim --all was good  Either that or one of those l'il pine tree auto freshners
597674,mercman,2011-06-28 19:05:00,7054,"  Sumfin a bit icky about a man who don't like coffee Thats ok, my wife says ground coffee smells like skunk"
597679,Bassive,2011-06-28 19:26:00,58,The Coleman site says to use baking soda. I tried it and it worked.
597681,Pikeslayer,2011-06-28 19:32:00,1443, TOMATO JUICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  slayer.
597686,adempsey,2011-06-28 19:35:00,1498,Baking soda is my top choice for removing any type of odour anywhere. Works great.   Bleach for disinfecting (capful in a gallon or so of water is more than enough).
597712,Tybo,2011-06-28 20:46:00,1373,"Disinfectant wipes.If you don't kill the bacteria,I wouldn't put food in it."
597723,mercman,2011-06-28 21:06:00,7054,"  DOESNT WORK!!!!!!!!!!TRUST ME, I TRIED!!!!!!!"
597778,kickingfrog,2011-06-28 23:29:00,8333,"Bleach and water.  Bleach is very volatile so it breaks down quickly and is environmentally safe.  Just follow the instructions.  To quote an ad tag line I put that ""stuff"" on everything."
597872,Fishnwire,2011-06-29 10:03:00,983,"The bleach seems to have done the trick.  It has also whitened up the inside of the cooler quite nicely!  Thanks again, folks."
