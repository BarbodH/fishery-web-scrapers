Looks like a smaller lake and doesn't seem to connect to French River directly when looking at Google Maps.  Haven't fished the lake before and an extensive search on here produced nothing.  I've found very little info on the internet about it aside from two campgrounds on the lake and even that didn't help much.  Has anyone ever fished this lake and can give me any info about it, depths, species (from what I read looks like musky along with pike pickerel bass)etc? Any info would be great guys, only heading there for 2 days with the girlfriend before with hit Gogama for a week so would like to have some idea of what to do out there!"
