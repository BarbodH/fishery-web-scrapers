596877,Big Cliff,2011-06-26 17:24:00,6899,"Well they got here Friday about lunch time. Rain and more rain but it doesn't seem to have dampened their spirits. They have been boating a few walleye, going for a few boat rides, just hanging out and enjoying themselves or so it seems.  We are really going to miss them when they leave for home. Nice people, wonderful company, and we really wish they could stay longer! We have already invited them to extend their stay so we can have a mini G2G here for them on Friday. They will let me know if they can. I'll let you guys know! Would be nice if they could get a chance to hook up with some more of the crazy canuks!  Anyway, just an update."
596880,Spiel,2011-06-26 17:32:00,9065,That's great Cliff.  Get some pictures for us.

597097,Roy,2011-06-27 09:53:00,13728,Wish I could be there. I've never met a redneck from upstate New York...nor a Cajun from Hyannisport for that matter.
597104,motv8tr,2011-06-27 10:15:00,2587,"Glad they're haveing a good time and able to boat some fish, although it's always a good time at Cliff and Sue's  Maureen"
597106,mercman,2011-06-27 11:01:00,7054,"Tell Bob he has to wear those POLAR-ized sunglasses i sent up for him.They cut down on the UV a, b, and NHL."
597345,Big Cliff,2011-06-27 21:34:00,6899," I have to tell you (but I should probably wait until he has the chance to do it) Whth. He loved the ""survival package"" you sent him but he didn't bring a computer with him so you will have to wait until he gets home for a report LOL."
597359,Jer,2011-06-27 22:12:00,1426,"  What's the matter? You don't trust him with yours.  ...on second thought, I don't blame you."
597362,mercman,2011-06-27 22:15:00,7054,  Mums the word Cliff I wouldnt trust him with your puter either. Ya know those big redneck fingers of his
597507,Big Cliff,2011-06-28 10:19:00,6899," LOL, I offered, Cindy threatened! End of discussion!"
597561,John,2011-06-28 13:15:00,2956, Hey Cliff when are they headed home?
597565,Headhunter,2011-06-28 13:25:00,5703,"Come Cliff! You know the rules... no pic, no red neck! HH"

598144,Big Cliff,2011-06-30 00:31:00,6899,"Unfortunatly they have to leave about 5:00 am on Friday, we will be sad to see them go! However I have a feeling we will be seeing them again in the not too distant future and next time they come, we will be planning a G2G."
598160,mercman,2011-06-30 00:57:00,7054,  You let me know Cliff. Thats one i wil not miss
598219,Sinker,2011-06-30 03:56:00,8692,"I fished with Bob this morning. Great guy! We never stopped shooting the bull all day! I'll let him tell the story of our day, but, will add that he did catch the biggest of the day!  Good times, and your more than welcome back in my boat anytime, Bob!  S."
