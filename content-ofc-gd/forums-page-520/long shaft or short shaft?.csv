My transom from top to bottom is 15"" so I'm assuming I need a short shaft motor. Also I would like to know what part to start from and end at when measuring a motor to tell if it is a long shaft or short shaft? Thanks guys"
598167,GBW,2011-06-30 01:07:00,8460,"that sucks man.  PS, my MRS said long shaft but knowing that 15"" is normal you are fine with an STD (sorry! standard one)"

598170,GBW,2011-06-30 01:17:00,8460,"Yeah Paul.  But I went through something like this last year a short shaft will fix those that need to cover 15"" deep or more..."

598178,glen,2011-06-30 01:34:00,2641,"You need a short(15"") shaft motor.  Measure the motor from where it sits on the transom to the top of the cavitation plate (the flat part above the prop) If it is close to 15"" then it is a short shaft.  If it is close to 20"" it is a long shaft.  For the boat measure from the top of the transom to the bottom of the boat."
