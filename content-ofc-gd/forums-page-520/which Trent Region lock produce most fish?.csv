597361,maybo,2011-06-27 22:15:00,86,thanks I did not plan to fish in Sandbanks but now I will try
597553,kingjames_2nd,2011-06-28 12:55:00,72," I have only fished the river in sand banks that connects  the two lakes.  It has giant rock bass, Normal Bass ( large or small mouth, I can't remember) and Gar!  At least that's all I caught, There may be more.  Places to check out specifically are   anywhere up or down stream from the canoe rental hut, get between the lilly pads  or down stream of the bridge near the rental hut, beside the  rock cribs!  I caught everything using a smallish hook, and a white 2 inch mr. twister with a few split shot weights, reeling slowly.   My grandfather used to fish west lake for everything but he targeted eel...  At least my mother remembers eating eal sandwiches as a kid.  If you catch an eel now though,  you got to throw it back!"
597587,ehg,2011-06-28 14:13:00,2666,"Don't bother trying to fish in Sandbanks park. There is just Lake Ontario there and you have to have a boat and go way out in lake. If you have a boat launch into Bay of Quinte at Trenton which isn't to far away. If you want to shore fish Twelve O'Clock point a little south of Trenton, on Bay of Quinte, is pretty good for pike, bass, and walleye."

597625,maybo,2011-06-28 16:10:00,86,I want to fish lock 1 in Trenton which is not far from 401. any suggestion?
597777,maybo,2011-06-28 23:28:00,86,Thank you so much OFC rocks I wonder if all the shore line alone that little canal can be fished? or any specific spot ?
597828,ehg,2011-06-29 02:27:00,2666," That little canal is called Murray Canal. It connects Brighton Bay with Bay of Quinte. You can walk the length and fish it. Casting into Bay of Quinte at the west end seemed best. I've caught pike, bass, walleye and many panfish there."
597842,Rizzo,2011-06-29 03:13:00,4754,get yourself a boat rental or canoe or build a raft or strap on some water wings and get yerself out into East lake. Soon as you come out of the river there are pencil reeds everywhere along the left side. Drift through and cast a spinnerbait ahead and you will be exhausted from the number of pike/bass you catch. Great numbers lake but not too many big ones around.
