I'm learning much from them and so wanted to share a bit with you all.  1.  Digestive Enzymes - very useful in helping to digest our food.  Benificial to those with Chrohn's and irritable bowel and also for anyone who experiences bloating after a meal.  Pretty much we have overworked our liver and intestines from eating cooked foods.  We must eat more veggies - MUST.  2.  Hot Water and Lemon - every morning before you have a coffee or anything else, drink 1 cup (8 oz) of hot water with 1/4 - 1/2 squeezed fresh lemon.  (I use 1/4 of lemon because I found the 1/2 a tad strong) It gives your stomach a hug and kick starts your digestive system....aids in detoxifying our system.  3.  Vitamin E, D3 and Omega 3 - for an irritable liver.  Prior to going this route you must have a blood test.  Just recently a loved one had a blood test and was told to start taking these and no more than 2 alcoholic drinks a day because he has an irritable liver.  His is not due to excessive alcohol...but rather due to his diet.  Not enough Vitamin D and Omega 3.  If you live in a colder country like Canada, you need Vitamin D3 (Vitamin D3 is more easily absorbed in our body)  And as we get older, we need more.  4.  Water - drink 8 cups of water a day.  Not just any liquid....WATER!  I could go into more detail regarding the above....but decided to leave that up to you to investigate further on your own should you see fit.  Good Health to All"
597544,Harrison,2011-06-28 12:38:00,2202,Thanks for the read twilight.  My 103 year old great grandma swore living healthy was as simple as eating bran and not holding in your farts.
597548,HTHM,2011-06-28 12:48:00,4082,We can tell you follow her advice regularly.....

597554,lew,2011-06-28 12:57:00,12766,My grandfather smoked un-filtered Players and drank 5-Star whiskey regularily until he died from old age at nearly 90.  Course he fished almost every day until he died too so maybe that off-set the bad habits
597589,12footspringbok,2011-06-28 14:17:00,459,"Its sad when most doctors today are just pill pushers for the pharmacuetical companies...  You really do have to take the bull by the horns and be responsible for your own health sometimes. I'm on the last chapter of a good book call The Detox Solution I started a couple months ago. Lots of good info in it, including the things you touched on your post.  Thanks for posting."
597592,ehg,2011-06-28 14:26:00,2666, Always thought the desire to go fishing strengthened the will to have long life.
597628,Tarzan's Jane,2011-06-28 16:18:00,1183,"  Those were the good old days Lew!!  Sure would be great if we could turn things around but it may be a little too late for some booboos.  I for one stay clear of microwave ovens.....  Came upon a report from a child that did a school project on the affects that water has on plants after being put in the microwave.  Not sure if you can Google it or not, but here is the jist of it.  The student had two identical plants, one he watered with tap water the other with microwave water that had cooled.  Guess which plant died.....yep the microwave watered one.  For me....that there is proof enough to keep away from microwaves.  I don't need to spend any money or tempt the fates more than I need to."
597630,Tarzan's Jane,2011-06-28 16:21:00,1183,  And thank you for the info on the Book.  I hope I can stay calm as I tend to get so angry and pissed off at how little I know and how much has been kept from me.

597669,mercman,2011-06-28 18:46:00,7054,"Considering microwaves are being used to transmit all sorts of radio frequencies, i doubt whether your kitchen M/W will make a big difference in the long run.we are being blasted 24 hours a day by microwaves of all sorts."
597883,Tarzan's Jane,2011-06-29 10:56:00,1183,"  Interesting....  But so is this:  Scientific evidence and facts In Comparative Study of Food Prepared Conventionally and in the Microwave Oven, published by Raum & Zelt in 1992, at 3(2): 43, it states    ""A basic hypothesis of natural medicine states that the introduction into the human body of molecules and energies, to which it is not accustomed, is much more likely to cause harm than good. Microwaved food contains both molecules and energies not present in food cooked in the way humans have been cooking food since the discovery of fire. Microwave energy from the sun and other stars is direct current based. Artificially produced microwaves, including those in ovens, are produced from alternating current and force a billion or more polarity reversals per second in every food molecule they hit. Production of unnatural molecules is inevitable. Naturally occurring amino acids have been observed to undergo isomeric changes (changes in shape morphing) as well as transformation into toxic forms, under the impact of microwaves produced in ovens. One short-term study found significant and disturbing changes in the blood of individuals consuming microwaved milk and vegetables. Eight volunteers ate various combinations of the same foods cooked different ways. All foods that were processed through the microwave ovens caused changes in the blood of the volunteers. Hemoglobin levels decreased and over all white cell levels and cholesterol levels increased. Lymphocytes decreased. Luminescent (light-emitting) bacteria were employed to detect energetic changes in the blood. Significant increases were found in the luminescence of these bacteria when exposed to blood serum obtained after the consumption of microwaved food."" The Swiss clinical study Dr. Hans Ulrich Hertel, who is now retired, worked as a food scientist for many years with one of the major Swiss food companies that do business on a global scale. A few years ago, he was fired from his job for questioning certain processing procedures that denatured the food.  In 1991, he and a Lausanne University professor published a research paper indicating that food cooked in microwave ovens could pose a greater risk to health than food cooked by conventional means. An article also appeared in issue 19 of the Journal Franz Weber in which it was stated that the consumption of food cooked in microwave ovens had cancerous effects on the blood. The research paper itself followed the article. On the cover of the magazine there was a picture of the Grim Reaper holding a microwave oven in one of his hands.  Dr. Hertel was the first scientist to conceive and carry out a quality clinical study on the effects microwaved nutrients have on the blood and physiology of the human body. His small but well controlled study showed the degenerative force produced in microwave ovens and the food processed in them. The scientific conclusion showed that microwave cooking changed the nutrients in the food; and, changes took place in the participants' blood that could cause deterioration in the human system. Hertel's scientific study was done along with Dr. Bernard H. Blanc of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the University Institute for Biochemistry.   There is so much more:  http://www.health-science.com/microwave_hazards.html  I prefer to error on the side of caution and I thank and respect those that have done the research and have not hidden the findings.  Nancy  Who invented microwave ovens? The Nazis, for use in their mobile support operations, originally developed microwave ""radiomissor"" cooking ovens to be used for the invasion of Russia. By being able to utilize electronic equipment for preparation of meals on a mass scale, the logistical problem of cooking fuels would have been eliminated, as well as the convenience of producing edible products in a greatly reduced time-factor.  After the war, the Allies discovered medical research done by the Germans on microwave ovens. These documents, along with some working microwave ovens, were transferred to the United States War Department and classified for reference and ""further scientific investigation."" The Russians had also retrieved some microwave ovens and now have thorough research on their biological effects. As a result, their use was outlawed in the Soviet Union. The Soviets issued an international warning on the health hazards, both biological and environmental, of microwave ovens and similar frequency electronic devices.  Other Eastern European scientists also reported the harmful effects of microwave radiation and set up strict environmental limits for their usage. The United States has not accepted the European reports of harmful effects, even though the EPA estimates that radio frequency and microwave radiation sources in America are increasing at 15% per year.   Now that just makes me angry!"
597885,Roy,2011-06-29 11:08:00,13728,I'd check further into the credentials of Anthony Wayne and Lawrence Newell. It seems that the only people quoting their findings happen to be selling a product. Companies such as Health-Science.
597888,Tarzan's Jane,2011-06-29 11:12:00,1183, Thanks....I wouldn't have a clue what they are selling....I just appreciate their information.  And I believe that knowledge is power even though it can cause much concern and stress.  Anyhow....I've done what will help me sleep well at night.
597895,lew,2011-06-29 11:46:00,12766,"I think if we all worried about all the articles we read we'd all worry our selves into an early grave.  Just go out everyday and enjoy life to it's fullest,  and I think that's some of the best medicine around.  But then again, I'm no scientist"
