597635,bow slayer,2011-06-28 16:34:00,1074,I would suggest checking out the west arm of nipissing or the french river area(hartley bay).Lots of lodges to choose from and all are family friendly.
597660,adempsey,2011-06-28 18:12:00,1498,"I stayed at Pleasant Cove Resort a few years ago.  Was a nice place.  Outdoor pool and a decent sized beach.   They have a couple of nice cottages right on the beach too, the others are up top on a cliff and have great views.  As for fishing, well, never caught a musky, but there are some really prime looking spots in the vicinity.  His rental boats aren't anything special, but never had any issues (fish finder costs extra).   The one thing I hated was the boat traffic.  I most likely will never go back to that body of water in the summer ever again.  It's way too busy for me.   Although, I always wanted to head back in the fall for some musky fishing.  Rice lake has several nice family resorts, but I don't think the musky fishing is too spectacular - but, I never actually targeted them here.  Although, I have seen some real beasts caught over the years. In my experience, the Pigeon tri-lakes are much better for fishing, but the resorts I stayed at aren't as good for families IMO - only stayed at a few though, so maybe someone else has a suggestion.  French river might also be a good spot. My buddy goes musky fishing there every year.  However, not too sure about family resorts as I only stayed at what I would call a ""fishing resort"".  Good luck!"

Benn going there every since. However, the boys are all grown up now, so we may have to rethink our future plans. Scotsman have a daily kind program to keep the kids busy during the week while you are out search for muskie."
