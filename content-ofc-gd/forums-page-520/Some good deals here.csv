They are in receivership.  Still lots of sweet stuff there.  Definately worth a trip or phone call if you need a prop as they have hundreds.  New props and hubs for under $100. If anyone was looking for a new fishfinder they had one 596c hd di left.  Reg price there is 699 so you can get it for about $413.  I know the regular price was a bit high but that unit at bps in the states is still $550.  Sad times for the Sandy Cove.  Maybe it was just too big.  Anyway, If you need a tube or a decent wakeboard you can get some pretty good deals."
597532,NAW,2011-06-28 12:10:00,4022,Thanks Cudz!  Do the sell life vests?
597537,Mike01,2011-06-28 12:26:00,378,"Do you know if that applies to Sandy cove North, here in North Bay?"
597556,Lip-ripper,2011-06-28 13:00:00,228, I heard last night that they are going out of business also.
597606,bigbuck,2011-06-28 15:13:00,2449,Worth a trip to Barrie. It's too bad to see that happen but I guess those that go shopping there will score some great deals on stuff.
597693,wkrp,2011-06-28 19:55:00,656,That too bad.I bought my boat there in 2002 and have been buying all my maintenance supplies from them . Convenient and they always had what I needed.
597705,Cudz,2011-06-28 20:34:00,2652,Yes they had a bunch but only one auto inflate left and it was a mustang belt.
597865,targaboy175,2011-06-29 06:10:00,76,thx Cudz !! any fishfinder in ~ 300 range.
597932,Lip-ripper,2011-06-29 13:37:00,228,"Update... the one in north Bay has the same deal on. A buddy of mine went up and dropped $600+ on a bunch of stuff. Winch, life jackets, helmets, snowmobile belts etc..."
597940,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-29 14:03:00,4399,"Nice to see folks getting a good finally at Sandy Cove, I priced a boat there one time and almost fainted when the guy gave me the price. When I asked him if he was serious he said we are Sandy Cove we don't discount, I said okay and spent 20k down the road."
