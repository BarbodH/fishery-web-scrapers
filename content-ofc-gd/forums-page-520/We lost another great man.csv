598088,Big Cliff,2011-06-29 22:23:00,6899,Just talked to York Regional in Newmarket. No trust fund set up just yet but they think there will be. It will be posted on their website and in the media!
598089,Big Cliff,2011-06-29 22:25:00,6899," OK, sorry, I guess it isn't public knowledge yet or something. Angie at York newmarket didn't know about it. Thanks for the update!"
598091,express168,2011-06-29 22:31:00,327,"Sad situation, I read that the driver is suffering from paralisys right now. He may get a life sentence of some sort after all. A life is gone, children never getting to know their father,and a group of young teens that think they know it all about to learn consequences I hope. Sad for everyone all around."
598092,lew,2011-06-29 22:32:00,12766,CTV reports  that the boy driving the car is now paralyzed from the neck down.
598093,Big Cliff,2011-06-29 22:33:00,6899, There are no winners in a situation like this!
598096,Spiel,2011-06-29 22:40:00,9065, Definitely not but I hope the parents of this boy are held accountable at some level.
598099,GBW,2011-06-29 22:48:00,8460,"here-here  But with saying that I'm sure if we all look back at some of the things we have done we could have been a problem child in the eyes of others at times.  I hope the whole group get what's coming to them because this was not the action of one 15 year old taking a van, stealing it and then calling his friends and saying 'I got a ride and I'll pick you up in 5 min' or was it?"
598100,Spiel,2011-06-29 22:48:00,9065, Thank you!   
598101,GBW,2011-06-29 22:51:00,8460,and that right there is a life sentence for doing what was done.  sad but someone I guess figured this was as close as you can get for 'an eye for an eye' I guess.
598102,Big Cliff,2011-06-29 22:51:00,6899," Trust me, this is going to cost them plenty! Probably destroy the rest of their lives as a family and we don't even know anything about them yet. Are they anymore guilty than my friends whose 15 year old daughter stole their car keys and went for a joy ride? I think I'd rather do what I can to help than point any fingers right now. They might be law abiding, god fearing people that have done everything they could to try to raise their kids properly. I would think they are very tramitized by the whole situation right now too. I can only imagine how I would feel if I were in their shoes right now."
598103,Spiel,2011-06-29 22:54:00,9065," I know where my kids are every night Cliff, every responsible parent should. IMHO"
598106,GBW,2011-06-29 22:56:00,8460,"Cliff, reading that post you are talking about is why I said this.   the 15-yr old's folks I bet are in shock and cannot understand what is going on right now to them and the son.  I wish that all involved get grilled by the COPs and the truth be found and those ""leaders"" of this action be held accountable for."
598109,Big Cliff,2011-06-29 22:59:00,6899," Not arguing that my friend, I too knew where my kids were every night (or at least think I did). I just know some people that in spite of their best efforts (or lack of experience) weren't as lucky as we were."
598110,Grimace,2011-06-29 23:01:00,2020," Maybe the boys parents are incredible people.  None of the mistakes any of us made were because our parents wanted us to make them.  The kids parents are probably destitute right now thinking ""why the hell did he do this?"".  Or maybe they are crappy parents who do not give a crap, but I doubt it.  This is truly an awful situation.  My sympathies lie with the officers family.  It is absolutely awful that those young children will grow up with out a father and his wife has to raise them with out his love and support.  His parents must be completely distraught.  I just have a hard time thinking that when I was young and let's say I get caught doing something wrong and they drag my mom and dad off to the can.  Does not make sense.  None.  Sometimes people make really stupid decisions no matter what their parents taught them.   Why would you make those people pay?  If this was me my mother and father would be distraught. It goes against everything they had ever taught me.  Now they have to pay?   I do not get the reasoning."
598115,Spiel,2011-06-29 23:05:00,9065, Agreed.   
598120,fishing n autograph,2011-06-29 23:29:00,2540,Unfortunately the kid's father is (from what I've heard from friends) a great guy....very pro police and runs a diner where styles and the rest of his shift went for breakfast. I'm sure he's destroyed over this
598122,Big Cliff,2011-06-29 23:34:00,6899," Which just goes to prove that in spite of our best efforts, our kids don't always make the smartest decisions. Some of us are just luckyer than others I guess. My heart goes out to all involved! Like I said,"" there are no winners""!"
597531,fishing n autograph,2011-06-28 12:09:00,2540,"A York Regional police officer has died after being trapped under a vehicle during a traffic stop east of Newmarket.  The officer, a male in his 30s, was on duty at a highway stop on Hwy. 48 near Herald Rd. when he was struck and trapped under his police cruiser. He managed to send out a call for help to York police.  Emergency crews were on the scene around 5 a.m. and the officer was rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries.  Hwy. 48 is closed from Davis Dr. to Mount Albert Rd. due to major police presence as the investigation continues.  The OPP is advising motorists to expect the closure to remain for most of Tuesday.   It was a tough way to wake up this morning. I didn't know him, and but a friend of mine knew him. He was a great guy and a father of two young children.  Rest in peace brother.

The fatal collision occurred on Highway 48, which is closed in both directions between Mount Albert Road and Davis Drive, east of Newmarket.  Police said the officer was struck by a vehicle while he was conducting a traffic stop on Highway 48, near Herald Road, in East Gwillimbury at about 4:45 a.m.  The officer was standing outside of his vehicle when he was struck.  Footage from Chopper 24 showed a light-coloured van off the highway in a field. The van appeared to have damage to its front end.  It's believed one male has been taken into custody by police.  Officers have set up a wide perimeter. A canine unit is scouring the area for any additional suspects.  Ontario Provincial Police are involved in the investigation, as well. OPP said Highway 48 is expected to be closed between Mount Albert Road and Davis Drive for most of the day."

597574,Rod Caster,2011-06-28 13:48:00,5784,"Very bad news. It's the same with construction workers...people zoom by as if doing 10 over the speed limit is more important than a life. When someone is out of their vehicles on a highway, drivers must slow down and pay close attention....be it emergency, construction or other."

597584,Grimace,2011-06-28 14:04:00,2020,What a tragedy. Too kids to grow up without their Dad.  A woman has to go through the trials and tribulations of raising children without the love and support of her husband whilst dealing with the loss.   Horrible.
597608,Gerry,2011-06-28 15:15:00,257,How very sad this is. As the father of a police officer I am doubly affected. My condolences to the family.
597621,Tarzan's Jane,2011-06-28 16:05:00,1183,I spoke with my son this morning who is an officer.  Funny how he tends to call me whenever an officer dies or comes close to dying.  I love my son very much and I am so honored to be his Mom.  It makes me feel good that he is able to talk with me about the sorrow he feels for his fellow officer and at the same time I just pray that I never stop getting his phone calls.  My deepest condolences to this officer's family and friends.

597789,NAW,2011-06-29 00:02:00,4022,"I have to admit, I nearly shed a tear watching this on the news this afternoon. They played the audio of some of his last words.  Unbelievable how calm he sounded considering he had a vehicle on top of him.  It's my aspiration to become a police officer one day, and know many of them to be close friends.  News like this is horrible."
597793,Cookslav,2011-06-29 00:19:00,1457,"Sad, and senseless...I have no words other then that"
597807,GBW,2011-06-29 01:01:00,8460,"I will admit that being a son of a police officer this did disturb me for a lot of the day.  On the list of the past fallen officers was my dad's partner and this is why it bothered me even more so.  Right now I'm at a loss for words as to what I want to say....  But I will say this.  Those kids (and yes that IS what they are) are screwed for as long as they live.  A COP will always look after another COP and he will not die in vein (SP?) for doing his/her job.  I hope that the driver is not aloud to drive ever just for being such a fool.  I wish all the COP's out there a safe day every day they go to work as a son of one.  Yes, I have many a friend in Durham and York that wear a badge and I hope to never hear of this to one of them or a friend.  Things like this hit more people then just the so called few involved so to the fallen officer Constable Garrett Styles I say thank you.  Geoff"
598064,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-29 21:25:00,10439,Seems they charged the driver with 1st degree murder in this case.  Police charge 15-year-old with murder in officer's death

598074,Big Cliff,2011-06-29 21:52:00,6899,"As a young offender, what is the worst he can get? It sure won't = the life he took!  Does anyone know if there is a trust fund being set up to help Const. Styles family? If there is please post it, I would like to do something more than just offer my prayers.  I read the transcript of his conversations with the dispatcher, this man is in my books a hero in the truest sense of the word. Gravely injured, with a van crushing him, he was still worried about the kids in the van. That takes a very special kind of person!"
598078,Spiel,2011-06-29 21:56:00,9065," I'd also be interested.     I heard it on the news last night, truly a ""Hero."" I'm still too verklempt to offer much of an opinion on the driver....  "
598080,GBW,2011-06-29 22:02:00,8460,great to hear the kid has been charged.  sad to say it's means nothing to the kid and his friends at this moment.  I hope the other kids get the book thrown at them for being involved.  I'm sure someone in the car/van said something like let's get the hell out of here and as a scared kid he tried to.  too bad an eye for an eye doesn't work out cause then others are at a rather large loss too.
