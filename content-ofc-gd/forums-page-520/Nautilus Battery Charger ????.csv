597984,Raf,2011-06-29 15:54:00,3495,"a deep cycle can come in all 3 flavours. if yours has the caps on top that you can remove to top off the water inside, it is a flooded.  if it is an optima, it is gel."
597986,Terry,2011-06-29 15:55:00,14456,"well it could be any of the 3 but I will guess number 3..normal wet battery because 2 is every every every expensive  there are agm batteries that are deepcycle but you would know if that's what you bought, optima blue top are agm batteries "
