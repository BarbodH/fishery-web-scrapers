598301,cram,2011-06-30 15:56:00,1733, Thanks!   I wondered if there were little chambers and if it would he hard to pinpoint them.  Have you ever tried filling with veg oil?
598333,craigdritchie,2011-06-30 18:14:00,1586,"I prefer casting to trolling, so when conditions are good my go-to is usually a big inline spinner of some sort, normally black bucktail with a chrome willowleaf blade. It's easy to throw all day, easy to fish, has a good hook-up percentage and doesn't generally do too much damage to the fish afterwards.  If conditions are tough, I'll go to a jig - black bucktail tipped with an eight-inch black Reaper worm, anywhere from 5/8 ounce up to 2 ounces depending on depth, weed growth and how fast I want to fish it."
597066,peter23,2011-06-27 03:01:00,95,"hey guys, i know every one of you muskie anglers have that one go to bait and that one bait that you do not leave your house without. i was wondering what you go to muskie baits are? if you doing mind sharing that is"
597070,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-27 03:06:00,10439,"I don't muskie fish any more (no muskies where I live now) but when I did fish them my go to lure was always a spinner bait. I have caught most of my muskies on them including my PB 53 1/2"" fish. I have caught tons on bass sized blue/yellow skirted 1/2 ounce baits and also on larger 1, 2 and 3 ounce baits. My PB came on a 3 ounce black with orange blade musky spinner bait."
597101,Rich Clemens,2011-06-27 10:12:00,3131,I've been throwing the DC-10's more now.  Started last fall and continued for the opener this year.   Caught my PB at Lakair on one.
597111,Handlebarz,2011-06-27 11:14:00,3790,"Not to be bias but I would bring one of my Handlebarz double 10's as the double 10's have been rocking the fish on all bodies of water for the last bunch of years. It only makes sense to carry a versatile bait that can be cast burning it in, slow rolled deeeper, bulging the water like a top water, or trolled. Blade baits have been a go to bait long before I was born and I would think no matter the size they will be here long after I am gone."
597130,BillM,2011-06-27 12:19:00,17367,I love tossing a bullfrog coloured TopRaider.
597133,mike rousseau,2011-06-27 12:23:00,4661,Top 5 baits  Jakes Super stalkers Red October tubes Hellhound Any double 10 in line  You Cary these baits you'll catch musky in any waters
597179,Handlebarz,2011-06-27 14:11:00,3790,"Mike had a good idea as its hard for just 1  If I had a top 5 it would be:  Double 10 6 1/4"" Woodie black perch Sledge Black perch or pike 10"" Jake Black perch or perch Top Raider"
597188,Sinker,2011-06-27 14:53:00,8692,"I'd take a black and orange spinnerbait any day in the kawartha's. Any colour works, as long as its black and orange  S."
597213,peter23,2011-06-27 15:52:00,95,thanks guys
597238,mike rousseau,2011-06-27 16:36:00,4661,  I noticed a pattern in your color choices... BLACK PERCH!!!  I have a handful of baits this color and never hit a hit on them...  Is there a situation you fish that color specifically that produces... Or do you pretty much trust that color no matter what?
597285,Handlebarz,2011-06-27 18:42:00,3790,I fine Black Perch good at any time but its seems to rock on overcast days or during the darker periods of the day dusk and dawn. Its kinda like Black and orange bucktails they are good at any time.
597373,davey buoy,2011-06-27 23:18:00,5505,"used the panther martin 28 with black tail with some success,but this weekend caught a 34"" pike (not muskie) on a meppps red and gold giant killer.It looks like it may have some potential."
597443,Pigeontroller,2011-06-28 02:17:00,2793,"Most Muskie guys have way too many lures...Me included. Its tough to pick one, but a black(skirt) and orange(blade) inline spinner(bucktail) especially a Double 10 bladed one would be a good choice. An appropriate sized Spinnerbait would probably be the most versatile though...  Here's my top 5 as per Mike's post...  Black/Orange Handlebarz Double 10 Lac Seul Turbo (similar to a Topraider but better, colour unimportant on surface lure IMO) Hellhound (custom colours by Bare Bones Baits are so much nicer than factory) Orange Tiger 10"" Jake 4 oz Beaver Lures Tri-spin Spinnerbait (black and gold)"
597501,mike rousseau,2011-06-28 07:27:00,4661,Walleye spinner...  Seriously... My biggest musky ever was on a walleye spinner made of 100lb floro...  And I boater a fat 43 incher tonight on a spinner made with coated wire...
597508,outllaw,2011-06-28 10:24:00,1232,Our favorite is perch woodie bait. remember belly colors on cranks are crucial.
597511,Roy,2011-06-28 10:42:00,13728," You got that one right for sure, George. Fish seldom ever see the top of the bait."
597525,Whopper,2011-06-28 11:47:00,2174,  Mine too Some dude from Windsor makes some nice ones that actually catch fish
597542,mattybculp,2011-06-28 12:32:00,388,"hard to beat a bucktail or large spinnerbait up here in the kawarthas. I really liked the super stalkers as well, especially the ones with the plastic tails. When i was a younger guy, I remember ""wiley lures"" being a big deal I havent got any of em, anymore. Ps Can you still get the superstalkers with the plastic tail? or is that what makes them super. or was it the size?"
597547,F_ast,2011-06-28 12:42:00,154,"WOW, really suprised Suick hasn't been names yet. Here are my favorite baits for the style of bait.  10"" Weighted Suick - Perch Red hot thriller (Glider of choice) >>>I lost what would have smashed my PB muskie by a mile on this bait last year.  Bionic Gold bladed spinner (Spinner of choice) <<<Gold blades are killer on Kawartha lakes. Hair colour is not as big of a deal. >>> I like Bionic spinner bait (it's a little smaller profile than I like, so I mod every one I get)>>> My largest; 53.5"" Muskie in Late October 07.  Mepps Muskie killer (In-line spinner of choice)  >>>4 of 5 largest Muskies I have caught have all come on the original Mepps Muskie Killer (one with the 2 trebles).  52"", (2)51"", (2) 50.5"".... has been my highest numbers lure.  Great choice as a high speed troll bait... But I hate trolling.  You can get a good 6mph or so without bulging.  At least 100 fish on it in the last 12 years I have fished muskie.  Hellhounds (Jerk bait of Choice)  Weagle (Topwater of choice)  10"" Jakes/ Grandma (Fall) (Crank bait or choice)"
597643,linweir,2011-06-28 17:20:00,202,My go-to lure is Terminator T3 joint crankbait for casting and trolling. They are so expensive though. Another recommended lure is big tube like tiger tube.
597658,lew,2011-06-28 18:10:00,12766,"My #1 go-to bait is a 9"" Grim Reaper that I start EVERY day with. Absolutely the best casting bait I've ever come across in close to 40 years of musky fishing. The fish never get bored with it and it boats me alot of fish every year.  2nd is the 9"" weighted strawberry Sledge  3rd is an 8"" Double ""D"" that I painted myself  For trolling, my 2 best are the 10"" black/yellow Believer and a 10"" Jake in a sunfish pattern.  I've got other baits that I use for deeper water but these are the 5 I normally start with.  I've probably got at least 100 baits but these 5 see more water than all the others combined.  I prefer to remove the rattles from some of my Believers for trolling clear water on bright days.  "
597796,houski,2011-06-29 00:29:00,61,"Hey guys,  Lots of great baits in everybody's top 5. It's interesting to see how some lures seem to turn up in top 5 lists more than others, for no apparent reason I'm sure...lol.  Here's mine.  Double 10 inline Jake (10"" for twitchin, and 14"" for trolling) Sledge Dunwright Dancer Jimmy  I usually go obnoxious on my spinners and twitch baits, and natural on jerks (all things considered)."
598266,cram,2011-06-30 13:34:00,1733,Lew -- where on the believer do you drill to remove the rattles?
598268,Raf,2011-06-30 13:41:00,3495,"double 10 10"" believer top raider wades wabbler  i could fish all year with those 4 baits."
598289,lew,2011-06-30 15:03:00,12766," Dead center on top of the bait  about 1 1/2"" back from the large hook eye. Turn the bait over and point the nose down a bit and the rattles will roll right out. Then cover the hole with a bit of 5 minute epoxy, a dab of paint and your good to go.  Dirty water, low light or when I'm trolling deep I like the rattles but clear water & bright days or trolling shallow I'll usually go with no rattles.  Course the fish don't always follow the same strategy as me though"
