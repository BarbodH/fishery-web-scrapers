Thanks"

597848,Rizzo,2011-06-29 03:23:00,4754,"its been a few years since I bought a prop but I'd think you could get something for $100. Royal Distributing on the 400 near Barrie had props a couple of years ago. Not sure if they still do, or if they are any good, but I remember the cost being very reasonable"
