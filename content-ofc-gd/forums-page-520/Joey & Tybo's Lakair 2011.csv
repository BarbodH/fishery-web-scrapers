597176,Live2fish85,2011-06-27 14:00:00,1633,Great Report Joey. That's a nice job hooking yourself. Glad to hear it came out with no other problems. Great pics as well you sure got an eye with that camera.
597186,bigbuck,2011-06-27 14:49:00,2449,Great Report and even Greater Pics!! Too bad about your now hookless lure. Your arm will heal but the lure is toast.
597456,lunkerbasshunter,2011-06-28 02:51:00,2585,wow those where some amazing pictures!!!  sorry about the hook in the arm that doesnt look like fun.  Great report!  cheers!
597461,Joey,2011-06-28 03:04:00,9122,"Thanks so much everyone, really appreciate the kind words about my photos, our safe arrival home and arm healing.  Today it was not looking or feeling too good so I've gone back to bandaging it up again in hopes infection has not set in underneath.  I'll stay on top of it and if in doubt, will be heading to the docs for his opinion.  On another note, I've decided to take a photo taking course.  Although some of the photos seem great, I really think I'm missing many more opportunities to take better pictures by not fully understanding how my camera works.  It is my first DSLR and I mostly only use it in auto mode.  Those eagle shots were a real disappointment for me as they were too dark and out of focus.  I'm hoping I can learn all about taking shots in different types of weather conditions and circumstances.  So we'll see how that works and I'll hopefully be taking more crisp and clear pictures in the future  Thanks again,  Joey"
597464,Gerritt,2011-06-28 03:08:00,6129,"Awesome report J!... dang I really missed not being there this year... Next year, hell nor high water will keep me away.  Thanks for taking the time to put this together hun, Hope you heal up soon.  G"
597502,Jewelbee,2011-06-28 08:31:00,422,  I LOVE the pictures of Newt! I think you did a great job!!
597510,Whopper,2011-06-28 10:42:00,2174,Good report  Your picture taking skills have come a long way.  looks like a good time
597519,danbouck,2011-06-28 11:21:00,4380,Awesome pics! Good seeing you guys again
597523,Tarzan's Jane,2011-06-28 11:44:00,1183,"Hi Joey - great report and very nice pics.  (I can do without the spider shots though)  In regards to taking photo lessons....I think if you pull a Brandon you'll do fine.  He wanted to capture a Grizzly, and so he went to them.  I just don't know how you'll pull off getting up to the Eagle's nest.      Although something tells me that you will find a way.  Well done."

597639,Squid,2011-06-28 16:49:00,1656,Awesome report and pictures Joey!!
597783,douG,2011-06-28 23:42:00,2693,"JoAnne, I gotta tell you what you already know:  you made some excellent captures there.  Depth of field, focus, composition.  You most definitely have talent, congrats for recognizing that in yourself and pushing that forward by taking some formal instruction.  Best of luck.  This was the first Lakair trip I missed since the very first Crayola International Invitational Fish Tournament.  I've hit every one since then, but this trip busted my record.  Thanks to you, joey, I felt like I was there with the crew.  Thanks very large, dere."
597794,ChrisK,2011-06-29 00:21:00,2772,Great report Joey and your wild life pics are amazing.
597908,Aaron Shirley,2011-06-29 12:16:00,655,"Wow Joey, this is a great report. I always look forward to viewing your amazing photos and reading your Lakeair reports! You have such a great eye for the camera and great skills. Too bad about the lack of lighting, those eagle shots would have been National Geographic material, and a bunch of others.  Sounds like a great time by all, except for your mishap, OUCH! Glad to hear the trip to the local hospital went well and quick and you enjoyed the rest of your time up there."
596602,Joey,2011-06-25 17:32:00,9122,"Well another Lakair G2G has come and gone and we had a great time once again.  The weather could have cooperated a bit better for us and we now have the task of unpacking all our sopping wet camping gear (if we get a sunny day sometime soon).  Our trip started Friday morning, June 17th and we made it up by noon and were set up by 3 p.m. or so.  The usual suspects were already there and I took as many pics as I could of the OFC motley crew  So I'll start with the people pictures:  And Roy, to say you were missed is an understatement bud                                              The fish fry was delish as always, not sure what Sam is doing in the background here, praying to fish Gods maybe LOL!        Redneck meat grinding at its finest               Isn't this the cutest picture!!!!                                 Okay, on to the Wildlife, or is that what I just did  I have to say, I took some great shots and had some great opportunities to take shots, but it was dark and dismal for most of the rest of the days we spent up there, so I did my best lightening the photos to make them viewable.  There were some sunny moments, few and far between, but for the most part, very bad photo taking weather.  But here goes with what I could salvage from them.          These eagle shots were not my best from a moving boat, but I got a few better ones later the next evening at dusk.         Not really sure why this heron was so high up in this tree, kind of a dive to get some minnows if you ask me!        The Eyes have it!!!             continued......."
596603,Joey,2011-06-25 17:35:00,9122,"                   So, as I said, it rained ALOT, so here are some related water shots and some scenery and other random shots.                                      Okay, now on to the fishing, which was not too bad, we targeted musky and caught alot of pike.  We even tried for pickerel a few nights but due to the high levels of pollen in the water and the recent shad fly hatch, that was mostly just a few relaxing evenings in the boat.  Paul did manage to catch an old rod and reel, that stunk to high heaven, and I caught a mussel       As you have probably heard, I also caught myself     That was a learning experience in how things can go bad very fast.  I was fishing with Brian, Betty and TJ in the pike tourny and we forgot the net.  We were down to the wire and only had 1/2 hour left and no fish on board.  I finally got a pike on and TJ said he would grab it, but I had worries this fish was not going to make it into the boat so I said, its not too big, I'll just flip it in the boat.  I raised my rod and lifted the pike over the boat and as I did that, she spit the hook and landed on the deck.  TJ picked her up and put her in the livewell and at that point I felt pain in my arm, looked down and saw the hook in there - DEEP!!!       The guys were great and Brian yelled, pack it up, we're heading back.  TJ cracked his usual jokes to keep me calm and Betty was there comforting me and helping me to try to keep my arm steady as the hook went under the muscle and was hitting tendons and nerves.  OUCH!!!  Every wave we hit was another new pain.  I really want to give a HUGE thank you to Betty for grabbing the bull by the horns and taking me to the hospital in record time.  Kevin cut the lure (one of my homemade lures too boohoo) and then the guys took a look and said no way I'm gonna get that out.  So Betty ran to her car and plunked me in the passenger seat and we were off.  I must say the Sturgeon Falls hospital did a quick removal job and we were in and out in about a half hour  THANK YOU BETTY!!!!!  It healed up pretty good tho, but I do have a funny tan now!      So, where were we, oh ya, back to fishing.  I did manager to get a nice little 25.5 inch musky!!!!    And we caught alot of pike...               We also ate well and had some great nights around the campfire.      "

Always nice to see you guys and really good to hear your arm is healing up OK, that was just plain nasty.  We stopped by your camp Tuesday morning to say good-bye but didn't see any signs of life so just kept on going.  Did you happen to see the moose that was hanging around the hiway just 1000' north of the camp on Tuesday ?? When we passed by she was only 50' off the side of the road, and of course my camera was in the boat."
596620,Joey,2011-06-25 18:46:00,9122,"Lew, I heard about the moose, but was busy sawing logs so did not get the opportunity to see it.  Too bad your camera was in the boat  Brian, you can come and enjoy a day of fishing with us any time you want, you could even drive the Pro V if you want     Thanks again and yes, that is what friends are for.  You two are great friends for sure"
