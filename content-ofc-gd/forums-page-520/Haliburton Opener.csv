597473,fishboy,2011-06-28 03:36:00,550,"Got out for a while both Saturday and Sunday. The smallmouth were cooperating with at least a decent fish each hour; here are a 19.5"" that came on 4"" tube rigged on a 4/0 hook (no additional weight)and a 17"" on a senko clone.  They went back in to swim another day.  "

597736,Jigger,2011-06-28 21:41:00,1237,"Found the same, singingdog. Couldn't really put any kind of pattern together. Lots of dead water, it seemed. Nice start to the season fishboy, what were you hitting 'em on?"
597800,singingdog,2011-06-29 00:37:00,1047,"Yea, the smallies were all over the place. Search baits were key, but tough to get hit on."
598147,fishboy,2011-06-30 00:34:00,550,"Water temp was reading 68/69 F...white 4"" tubes weightless on a 4/0 hook was most productive...covered a lot of water and depths up to 14'...as Jigger said, no real pattern played out"
