597771,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-28 23:07:00,1107,"exactly why I throw 10"" worms and huge flippin jigs for bass they are lazy fish and want 1 huge meal over a bunch of little ones sometimes and some days they want a fly LOL stupid fish"
597818,Cudz,2011-06-29 01:39:00,2652,4 fours will always beat 5 threes. Not as many but often bigger with the big baits.  That is a big fat smallie for this time of year. Was the pic taken a few weeks ago?  Maybe she had not spawned yet??  odd.  Nice fish though.
