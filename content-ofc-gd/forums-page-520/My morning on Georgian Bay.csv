Steve, not remembering that Bass season was open took us back to where we got out Pike last week.  I don't care either way, I like pretty much any fish that will take my offerings   Sadly there were no Pike to be had today, so we went across to a small island and it looked like good hunting grounds.  I had several hits right away so I was thinking this was the spot....until I hauled in a 3-4 inch Perch that is   lol  After a little bit of time there we headed to a spot where we raised a nice Bass last year (spit the hook at the boat), but this year there we no weeds to be found, not sure if it's too early there or what, so off to try one more spot, and again, no takers.  While I had a great day on the water and it was nice and calm I was pretty frustrated that once again I had brought pretty much nothing into the boat....that is until we got to the launch and only one of 5 boats had managed one keeper, and a couple were skunked....there's hope for me yet  We'll see if I can do better next week as it's back to work for me tomorrow...

597274,Joey,2011-06-27 18:13:00,9122,A day on the water is better than a day at work I always say.  At least ya got out Moe
597280,lew,2011-06-27 18:19:00,12766,"I've been cutting & stacking firewood all day Moe, so even though you only caught one dink perch I'm sure you had more fun to-day than I'm having  Good to hear you & Steve had an enjoyable day !!"
597309,mercman,2011-06-27 19:49:00,7054,"I'm like you Mo. If i dont get anything, i start wanting to sell the boat But then comes the times when you can do no wrong, and the boat is stinking of fish  Worth the wait, isnt it?  "
597356,motv8tr,2011-06-27 22:05:00,2587,"Oh, make no mistake mercman, the only reason I would want Steve to sell the boat it so that he can buy a more fishing friendly boat   Even better would be to get my boat back on the water...  It was a good day over all, lots of sun too   but ya a fish or two would have been a bonus  Maureen"

597567,Beans,2011-06-28 13:29:00,3339,    Just kidding...makes for less lawn to cut...   
597837,limeyangler,2011-06-29 03:00:00,5204,Like you said Maureen...a day in the boat....all good.  Sounds pretty similar to my hour in the boat yesterday...slow days happen.
