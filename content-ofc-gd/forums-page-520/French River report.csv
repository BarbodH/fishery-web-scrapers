Slow bite but we managed a bunch of smaller walleye, lots of nice bass, lots of small pike, and a 46"" musky which is now my wife's P.B. All fish were released except for 2 unlucky walleyes that were great in the frying pan. Great time had by all. Saw a bear and a small mink i think. Here are a couple pictures of the nicer fish we caught."
