860634,Fish4Eyes,2014-06-27 21:22:00,1022,I'm redoing my boat floor and am at the point where I can start securing things. Can I get away with only screwing down the perimeter of the boat or do I also need to screw the middle of the floor as well? Trying to limit number of visible screws. Thanks.
860636,wkrp,2014-06-27 21:28:00,656,Screw it down wherever it was fastened before. Boats take a real pounding on the water.
860638,Freshtrax,2014-06-27 21:37:00,2215,Aluminum rivits or stainless screws.   Not the cheap ones go to fasten all.
860645,muskymatt,2014-06-27 22:09:00,2608,Screw it down as much as possible and predrill the right size or you'll be snapping off the stainless screws. Trying to get them out after being snapped off is no fun.
860649,pikeyminnow,2014-06-27 22:26:00,18,I agree with Musky Matt. I just re did mine and was able to find most of the existing holes and re-use these but I had to drill a couple new ones and didn't drill holes large enough and snapped off a couple. It was nasty trying to get these broken ones back out.
