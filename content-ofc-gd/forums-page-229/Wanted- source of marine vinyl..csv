860578,porkpie,2014-06-27 13:03:00,2521,Looking for an outfit that carries marine vinyl flooring for a project.  On the highway 6 corridor between Guelph and Owen Sound.  Kitchener/Waterloo would be ok too if there aren't any other alternatives.  Thanks for your input!
860581,dave524,2014-06-27 13:20:00,4508,"Heard some good things about this stuff on iboats, it appears to be available at most majour outlets.  http://www.ducan.com/vinyl-decking/default.php   look at the photo gallery for some marine installs"
860591,porkpie,2014-06-27 15:02:00,2521,"Perfect, just what I was looking for, and there is a dealer in Elmira.  Thanks!"
860600,glen,2014-06-27 15:58:00,2641,Homedepot too.

It still looks good today, easy to install, easy to wash down, hooks don't get caught in it like carpeting, & has a slip resistant texture.  I am very pleased with it.  Cost me $80.00 dollars for the vinyl for my 14' Lund & $45.00 for the glue.  It's available at Home Depot.  You'll notice it's the same vinyl they use in the new Lunds."
860762,porkpie,2014-06-29 14:01:00,2521,"Went to Home Depot in Guelph and they've never heard of the stuff, although they are listed as a dealer!  I'll try the place in Elmira.  Thanks for the first hand account!"
860765,wkrp,2014-06-29 14:42:00,656,Its a special order  at home depot .they dont stock it. If I am not mistaken I think it is called  deckmaster.
