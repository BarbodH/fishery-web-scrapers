860157,vance,2014-06-24 20:18:00,719,Princess auto is the place to go as they have most sizes mounted and unmounted in stock.   vance
860163,dracokaos,2014-06-24 20:39:00,116,Oh course! I always forget about that place  Thanks
860169,misfish,2014-06-24 20:59:00,29133,The rubber is good. Mostly carlisle tires . The rims are very sloppy IMO. Lots of play where they slide over the bolts. Grab the rubber and have it mounted on your rim.
860276,bigbuck,2014-06-25 14:12:00,2449,Check out your local tire shops. Many of them carry trailer tires and will likely have some decent pricing. My guy here in Oakville carries Hercules trailer tires and has had no problems with them. They are much cheaper than Carlisle and Goodyear. He has not steered me wrong in several years and several sets of tires. The rim and rubber I bought for a spare for the boat was cheaper than just the rubber at Princess Auto.
