Where the heck is all this money going?  When I turned 65 the one thing that I got as a perc was that I no longer have to buy the fishing license (Still need all the others though).  Now they even want to take that away from me!"
860277,grimsbylander,2014-06-25 14:20:00,3016,"I don't care if I have to buy a fishing licence until I'm no longer able to fish. I have more money now than when I was in my 20's and 30's, small kids, minor hockey, brand new mortgage and a much lower earning potential. I remember having to buy my wife a fishing licence just because she was in the boat for family time."

860422,aplumma,2014-06-26 11:18:00,6896,When are they going to start taxing our bank account balance? Actually they already do they tax it before it gets deposited. lol  The fishing license fee is something that you opt in for if you want to fish it is not mandatory. Kind of like the fee to go to a movie or amusement park. Those type of money raising do not bother me as much as taxes that are on products you need to live.   Art

I choose not to be a member, because they don't take any kind of a stand when it really counts. Yes, I'm generalizing. But I think back to how quiet they were when the spring bear hunt was cancelled. Seniors paying for fishing licences is a money grab."
860594,fish_fishburn,2014-06-27 15:22:00,1311,"All our fishing license fees go to the big purse. I can pretty well assure you none of it comes back to my area.

860085,superdad,2014-06-24 15:48:00,353,"Has anyone read the latest OOD???? In the 'NEWS' column there is an article about the MNR looking for new Funds.  Hunters and Fishers to bear the brunt of this.FYIDavid  aka  SuperdadHere's the article:The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is proposing new ways to increase revenue — and hunters and anglers will likely bear the brunt of it.An Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) posting, which closes for comment on June 2, says that by 2015 the Special Purpose Account (SPA) that funds the MNR’s fish and wildlife programs, which cost $100-million to deliver, will not be able to keep up with shortfalls caused by changing licence purchases, inflation, and an older demographic.According to the posting, the SPA will have to reduce expenditures in 2015 to maintain a positive budget unless actions are taken to offset the shortfall.All of the proposed actions are outlined in this Sustainability Strategy for the Special Purpose Account (SPA), 2014-2019 document.In the 40-page document some of the proposed actions include the following:    a $2 processing fee for Outdoors Cards and licence purchases;    increased commercial fishing licence fees; and    replacing free angling for seniors with discounted conservation and sportfishing licences starting in 2016.At current licence rates that would mean seniors would pay $23.11 for a sportfishing licence or $13.17 for a conservation licence, plus $9.63 in either case for an Outdoors Card.The draft strategy’s goals also include improving efficiency and cost savings within the MNR to allow more money to be directed to fish and wildlife conservation, corporate sponsorships, and initiatives that recruit and retain anglers and hunters.In addition to receiving public comment via the EBR posting, MNR Project Manager Silvia Stobl said that the ministry held presentations at 23 stakeholder sessions from December 2012 to March 2013, and focus sessions for key stakeholders from November 2013 to February 2014.MNR Sr. Media Relations Officer Jolanta Kowalski said after the 45-day comment period, the MNR will review the comments to develop a decision notice that will be posted on the EBR Registry for additional comments.- See more at: http://www.oodmag.com/news/mnr-looking-new-funding/#sthash.Aj8QX8AP.dpuf"

860122,Bill Shearer,2014-06-24 18:09:00,456,"According to one forum I'm on;  The Seniors new licence fee is a done deal, we had no chance for input. AND the Bull about a discounted fee for Seniors is apparently Bull as well. An owner of a tackle shop who also sells fishing licences has told me in no uncertain terms that I was wasting my time, the deal is done, they have already set the Seniors Licence up in their system and there is NO discount!!! And we will see it NEXT YEAR.All the time, effort and expense of the report etc. was just the government blowing smoke up a certain orifice to make us feel like we had important input to add. They don't give a fiddlers **** about what we say or think. If I am wrong I will apologise, but the tackle shop owner was firm in his remarks, If any other Licence sellers are out there please comment and let me know, RIGHT or WRONG. Typical of the way the present government did things"
860125,Oggie,2014-06-24 18:25:00,588,Does anyone know how much of the MNR budget for fisheries and wildlife is paid for by licenses?  If we use the idea that the users of the resource must pay for managing the resource then road tolls shouldn't be too far off with this new government!  If you drive the highway then you should pay for the maintenance of the highway; seem fair to me!  They've cut the MNR soooooo deep I'm surprised they haven't resorted to charging seniors prior to this. I don't like the idea because it won't solve the problem. Public tax dollars should be used for the MNr not just license money.. Dan O.

860180,alphaalpha,2014-06-24 21:30:00,475,"Yup I don't mind paying an increased license fee as well. Like other poster said the current fee is dirt cheap... Doubling the sport and conservation fee and it's still a joke really.  Leave the folks on a fixed income alone.  If you want to fish once or twice a year a conservation license is way cheaper than going to a movie or two. If you fish often and keep a lot or fish tourneys a $50 year fee  is a drop in the bucket.  All that being said the increases damn well better go back into the fisheries.  Cheers,  AA"
