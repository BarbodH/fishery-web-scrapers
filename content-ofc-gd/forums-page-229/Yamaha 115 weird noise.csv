Maybe during higher RPMs too.  Makes no difference whether in gear or not.  Can last for a minute.  Then disappears.  Otherwise runs like a clock.  Put my ear to the engine.  Seems to be coming from the middle below the block equally on both sides.  4 yrs ago a smashed her on a shoal.  Had to replace the midsection because was bent.  Done by a Yammy tech.  Been perfect since.  Any idea what this could be?  Can I wait or should she be looked at soon?  I know the fuel pump and reservoir are in there.  Any advice would be much appreciated"
860390,Big Cliff,2014-06-26 01:54:00,6899,Really hard to give you a definative answer without actually being there to hear it but I think I would err on the side of caution and have it checked out by a certified tech.
860407,NANUK,2014-06-26 03:57:00,797,"Most likely it is the drive shaft bushing squeek/whistle sound, common problem with Yamaha, this bushing is located just under the engine block where the drive shaft connects to crank shaft. nothing serious, just annoying. The fix,  take lower unit apart and apply Yamaha grease.......but the noise will return within a few weeks. If you are sure that previous repairs were done properly on the mid section, I would just leave it alone."
860412,spincast,2014-06-26 10:27:00,3279,"given the cost of the motor vs the cost of a mechanics inspection, really?  Just get it inspected."
860609,captpierre,2014-06-27 16:38:00,2521,"Thanks Guys.  I usually jump on these things.  Problems tend to get worse and more costly to repair.  it is however a huge pain to take the boat out of the water to a marine tech.  Stonefish, is there a downside if I don't get that shaft bushing looked after soon? "
860611,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-27 16:55:00,10439,"Yes, it's most likely the bushing. I have heard tons of reports of Yamaha output shaft bushing squeaks.  Here's a post about the issue. Seems it's more annoying than anything else.  http://www.thehulltruth.com/archive/t-291448.html"
860618,aplumma,2014-06-27 18:27:00,6896,So if you think it is the bushing and your wrong how much money does this mistake cost? I have never seen an issue that gets cheaper the longer it occurs.    .02 worth   Art
