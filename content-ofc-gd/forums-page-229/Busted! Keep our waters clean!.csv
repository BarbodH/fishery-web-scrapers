White, 49, of Fairview Park, and Kelly Plating Company with making illegal discharges with high concentrations of metals such as chrome and zinc into the sewer system, which in turn, after treatment, discharges to Lake Erie, said Steven M. Dettelbach, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio.  The Kelly Plating Company is a metal plating operation located in Cleveland.  White was an employee at Kelly Plating and responsible for operating the equipment which reduced the amount of pollutants discharged into the sewer system to an acceptable level, according to the indictment.  Starting around January 28, 2012, White changed the way wastewater at the Kelly Plating facility was processed.  During the weekdays, White ensured that the pollution control equipment was operated properly, according to the indictment. However, on the weekends White bypassed the pollution control equipment and discharged partially treated wastewater and sludge directly into the sewer system.  These discharges contained high concentrations of chrome and zinc.  This practice ended on May 19, 2012, according to the indictment. """
