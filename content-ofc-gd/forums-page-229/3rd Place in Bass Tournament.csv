This was their first fishing contest. My daughter ended up finishing in 3rd place with her 13"" bass. She was so excited and she received a medal! I can't wait to head up to ontario for some ""real fishing"" for toothy critters!   My daughter proudly displaying her bass!    Measuring the fish.    3rd Place medal!!!!!!!    My son with his big bluegill. He was sad that they didn't have a medal for big bluegills.    I was lucky enough to have some spare time so I hit the Susquehanna river.  I was able to catch this 20"" smallmouth but it was really skinny. I think it must have just finished spawning. "
