860612,Headhunter,2014-06-27 17:05:00,5703,"From what I have heard, the employees and another investor group have bought the plant and it will in full production, if not already. When I heard that Heinz was going to close the plant, I swore off of Heinz Ketchup, the only brand I had ever bought. Wit this news, I can feel good about buying Heinz products again. Ketchup loves poddaydos! HH"

860625,Handlebarz,2014-06-27 19:58:00,3790,No the plant is not in full production they went from around 800 people to around 200. I have only bought their product all my life but I will not support them ever again. I don't work there but am getting sick and tired of big business leaving and this time I can do something about it. I sent off my emails when it was announced and never got a reply. F Heinz  Sorry I love the product they make it is the best I will miss it but can sleep better with out it.  Yes the new business there is doing some of their stuff but nowhere close to the amount that was once booming. Look at all the other jobs that are going to be gone because of this.  End of my rant
860628,misfish,2014-06-27 20:45:00,29133,"That sucks Mike.  Someone get the story straight.  I was always one that said catsup was catsup. NOT  May have to go back to that bad catsup.  Frenches has a catsup. it,s not bad,but,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
860631,bushart,2014-06-27 21:14:00,2628,Yeah not sure who makes Ketchup other than heinz  it's like when Bicks pulled outta the Niagara Peninsula----bye bye jobs  Loyalty will be a word soon only to be found in history books

Cliff,  Heinz hired a Burger King executive... so McD's dropped Heinz... I can understand that..  But the plan to shutter this plant has been in the works for alot longer then the above.  E.D Smith is a producer of Ketchup and many other items. They are located outside of Stoney Creek. It is a pretty good alternative to Heinz if I may say so.  G  *Edit the rule of I before E does not apply here*"

G  *Edit the rule of I before E does not apply here* Not a good excuse in my books, (sounds like sour grapes LOL) I am sure ED makes a very good product BUT! it isn't Heinz!  That's it, I won't go to McD's ever again (well except for their coffee and muffins) (oh wait, that was the only reason I went there in the first place) ok, this shoukld be an easy one"
860712,John Bacon,2014-06-28 21:22:00,3277,I think Aylmer brand ketchup is made in Canada.  That is another option.
