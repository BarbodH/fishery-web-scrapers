While out for bass, i hooked a few pike lost them all, i forgot to mention, I've been having a very unlucky streak with pike, haven been out 3 times and have hooked probably around 30-40 fish, most spit the hook, some snapped the line, others cut my hands, others i dropped while lifting (keep forgetting the net) some i couldn't reach due to the shore, really unbelievable. Was reeling in a sunfish and had a nice sized pike hit it, hooked him for about 10 seconds, got a good look and he spit the hook! Some pics:[/url[/url[/url[/url[/url[/url[/url"
