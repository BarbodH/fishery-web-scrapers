857126,Handlebarz,2014-06-08 00:37:00,3790,I cleared this with Roy before I posted it.  I just want to give back to the OFC family. This contest is very easy it's just like one I have done in the past just post your musky opener pic here it does not have to be with a musky just you getting out on the water enjoying musky fishing. I will select a random winner the week after musky opens up north to give the members up there a chance to get out.  The winner will get a Handlebarz prize pack including lure shirt and beer koozie.  Best of luck this season to all the musky nuts here.
857129,dhickey,2014-06-08 00:56:00,1038,Cool but I wont be musky fishing. I will be going after pike or bass.  Got a good feeling this year.  Good luck. Knock em out.  Don.
857138,Joey,2014-06-08 01:40:00,9122,"Well hope you can wait until I get back from my week up north, at least give me a day or two after the first week of opener up there to do a report"
857140,fishnsled,2014-06-08 02:04:00,3520,Very generous offer Mike!
857143,Handlebarz,2014-06-08 02:25:00,3790,Yes Joey I figure it will be later that week or maybe the end of it so that everyone has more then just a day to get the reports in. Heck it gives the southern bunch more time to get the first trip in.
857167,outllaw,2014-06-08 13:51:00,1232,"are employee,s allowed to enter this contest lol"
857171,Handlebarz,2014-06-08 15:17:00,3790,Lol yes but they must go fishing
857203,Ron,2014-06-08 20:12:00,1683,"Very nice of you Mike!  Unfortunately, I won't be out until well after opener this year. Even if I wanted, most of my gear is North right now waiting for me. Got some proto types that are gonna see time on the water for big gators.  Cheers, Ron..."
857226,fishsevern,2014-06-08 23:45:00,112,Hey Mike...very cool of you and great timing! On buckhorn friday so hopefully I get into one.

857387,Djeep,2014-06-10 01:08:00,199,il start it off with a pic of a little guy i picked up trolling on opener. I had a nicer fish strike on the figure 8 but missed the hooks i suppose!   Awfully generous offer of you mike. best of luck this season!
860487,Handlebarz,2014-06-26 17:45:00,3790,Well it looks like Djeep is the winner shoot me a text Ron and stop over to get your pack.
860500,misfish,2014-06-26 19:05:00,29133,"Congrats D.  Mike I have a small lake with,n an hour or so that holds musky. Not sure how the battle will be with me in the tube and the fish with the whole lake to pull me around. Im sure I,ll ware him down at some point.LOL I am going to try it. Im sure it will be a blast."
860501,aplumma,2014-06-26 19:12:00,6896,Very nice of you Mike thank you as always for your generosity to OFC as well as being a heck of a good guy.   Art
860535,Ron,2014-06-26 23:10:00,1683,"Congrats Djeep!  And good on ya for putting this up Mike. You are truly a stand up guy.  Unfortunately, I haven't even been out for Muskie yet. Hoping to next weekend."
860538,Handlebarz,2014-06-26 23:29:00,3790,Funny thing is Ronnie won it last time when we actually had a lot of people post for it. Jade picked his name from a hat of all the names this time he wins because no one else entered. Ronnie is a good young guy so I know the package is going to get good use
860616,aplumma,2014-06-27 17:55:00,6896,I would have entered my muskie picture except it doesn't exist.....   Art
860623,Handlebarz,2014-06-27 19:39:00,3790,Lol you ain't gots not fish with teeth down there?  I tried to make it easy just any pic of members chasing musky no fish were needed.
