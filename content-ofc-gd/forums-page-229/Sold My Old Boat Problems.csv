860423,Matt Janes,2014-06-26 11:19:00,49,Bit of a weird one here. I just sold my old boat as I bought a new used one. Turns out that the VIN# on the ownership for the trailer does not match the VIN# on the trailer itself. When I registered the trailer I just took the ownership given to me to service canada and they gave me plates for it. I never thought to check the VIN#'s to see if they matched. I did a lein search on the boat before buying and everything came back legit with the current owners being correct. Any ideas on what I or the new owner have to do to clear this up?  Thanks

860425,Matt Janes,2014-06-26 11:26:00,49,Does the old VIN have to be removed before doing this or afterwords?
860427,Sandbag,2014-06-26 11:43:00,533,"It's Illegal to remove or alter a VIN.  You may have to take the VIN# from the trailer to the MTO, pay the fee and determine who actually owns the trailer.  Then go from there.  Cheers and good luck  Craig"
860431,Matt Janes,2014-06-26 12:01:00,49,What is the fee for?
860438,DanD,2014-06-26 12:41:00,2223,"To do the search; it use to be something like 10 bucks, no idea how much now? The bad part though if it comes back as stolen, even many years ago; you'll forfeit the trailer. But it is the proper thing to do.  Dan."
