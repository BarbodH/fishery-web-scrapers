860134,Big Cliff,2014-06-24 19:05:00,6899,"As much as I respect your opinion Big Cliff, I have to disagree with you on this one. The woman was directly responsible for the deaths of two people, regardless of intent. How would you suggest that the family of the victims deal with this, should she get off with a slap on the wrist. She stopped dead in the fast lane of an express way. That's negligence and it led directly to the deaths of two people. The only excuse for that action would have to be a human was on the road in front of her. We do not hold the lives of animals equally to humans... yet. HH And I respect your opinion too, but how about we also find the father guilty too! His actions contributed to the death of his 16 year old daughter. He was obviously speeding and in any rear end colision it boils down to care and control of your vechicle;  If someone hits you from behind, it is virtually always his or her fault, ­regardless of the reason you stopped. A basic rule of the road requires that you be able to stop safely if a vehicle stops ahead of you. So, as a tailing driver, if you ­cannot stop in time and wind up rear-ending the vehicle in front of you, you are not driving as safely as you need to be under the circumstances. If the father had proper care and control this wouldn't even be an issue and no lives would have been lost.  At no time have I suggested she should get off with a slap on the wrist but I do think that the circumstances should carry some weight too."
860135,Headhunter,2014-06-24 19:12:00,5703,I see your point Cliff. And I have to agree with FnS that we just don't have enough info to make a black and white assessment. HH

The jury has seen this and with respect to our legal system, which is not perfect and has it's flaws, you have to leave it in their hands.  Depending out the out come, I would expect an appeal would be launched.  She was at fault for what she did but the motorcycle driver only slowed down about 8kph before impact.   One would think that the motorcycle driver was distracted in some way.  I would think that this was brought up at the trail at some point. I doubt very much she would get the maximum sentence but what she deserves, I don't know.  In the end it will not right the wrong and bring the father and daughter back.  A tragic event for all parties. I have come up on a car that was  parked on the road, there were no brake lights or flashers on the car and it took my brain a while to catch on that something wasn't right, first I thought it was just going slower , by the time I figured it out I did not have time to stop and ran on the shoulder to not crash, then came to a stop..the car behind me did the same thing your brain just does not expect a car with no brake lights to be stopped on the road"

Well, the options available for restitution for the family as far as I can see are; -incarceration -monetary fines -community service -weekend time served -any combination of the above. I know that none of the above will bring back the family's lost ones, but to me, her actions were the directly responsible for the two deaths.

Irresponsible to the point of being criminally negligent (at what point does “criminally” come into it?)  Absolutely no common sense ( I never said in my OP that her decision was smart but she could face life in prison on the one charge and up to 14 years on the other one. My question was Where is the JUST in justice). I don’t believe she should get off scot free, I just believe that the sentence should be reflective of the intent.  Actions like that don't deserve a second chance in my books. (Here is where we would disagree; I believe that everyone deserves a second chance when there is no malice or criminal intent.)

The woman was directly responsible for the deaths of two people, regardless of intent. How would you suggest that the family of the victims deal with this, should she get off with a slap on the wrist. She stopped dead in the fast lane of an express way. That's negligence and it led directly to the deaths of two people. The only excuse for that action would have to be a human was on the road in front of her.

Yes, one does have to be fully aware of their surroundings and one must anticipate the un-anticipatable, especially when riding a motor cycle, but she clearly broke the law by stopping in the fast lane of an EXPRESSWAY! What we don't know is if she locked up the brakes to stop in time to save the ducks or came to a slow stop. Either way, she broke the law. Best intensions aside, as they have NO legal barring, she clearly broke the law. For that, she must be held to account. What if she had stopped because she thought she saw a unicorn... would the nay sayers still say she should not do time? HH"

I know that none of the above will bring back the family's lost ones, but to me, her actions were the directly responsible for the two deaths.

The jury has seen this and with respect to our legal system, which is not perfect and has it's flaws, you have to leave it in their hands.  Depending out the out come, I would expect an appeal would be launched.  She was at fault for what she did but the motorcycle driver only slowed down about 8kph before impact.   One would think that the motorcycle driver was distracted in some way.  I would think that this was brought up at the trail at some point. I doubt very much she would get the maximum sentence but what she deserves, I don't know.  In the end it will not right the wrong and bring the father and daughter back.

Had the motorcyclist been travelling a reasonable speed and paying attention they would most likely have been able to avoid the collision.  The motorcyclist applied the brakes before hitting the car, yet they were still travelling in excess of the speed limit after having slammed on the brakes.  If they were still travelling in excess of the speed limit after applying the brakes, how fast were they going before applying the brakes?  She should be charged, but I don't think an extended jail sentence will server a purpose.  The sentencing should take into account that the motor cycle driver was also negligent."

Emma Czornobaj has pleaded not guilty to two counts each of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death.  Czornobaj, now 25, is accused in the deaths of Andre Roy, 50, and his daughter Jessie, 16.  Roy was driving and his daughter was riding pillion on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle that slammed into the accused’s car in June, 2010.  The Crown said in its opening statement Tuesday that Czornobaj, of Chateauguay, wasn’t physically in her car and that the vehicle was at a dead stop in the left lane of a highway south of Montreal. Prosecutor Annie-Claude Chasse said witness and police testimony will show she was on a narrow patch next to the passing lane, tending to a family of ducks on the roadway.  “Would a reasonable and prudent person, in the same circumstances as was the accused, have done the same?” Chasse asked the jury. “Would that reasonable and prudent person have stopped their car, on a busy highway, in order to save some ducks?”  The charges are serious. Criminal negligence causing death carries a maximum life sentence while the charge of dangerous driving causing death comes with a maximum of 14 years in jail. Czornobaj has no previous record.  Witnesses expected to testify include Pauline Volikakis, who lost her husband and only child in the tragedy. She was riding in a motorcycle behind the two victims and saw the events as they unfolded on Highway 30, south of Montreal.  On Tuesday, eyewitness Martine Tessier testified she was driving along the same stretch of highway on June 27, 2010. The weather was nice, the sun was setting and the road conditions were excellent. Tessier said she was driving about 110 kilometres an hour when she saw a woman along the side of the road seemingly trying to shoo along a family of ducks.  “I shouted to my kids [in the car], ‘What is she doing there? She’s going to get killed,’ ” Tessier told the jury.  She testified that, moments later, she was staring down a car, completely stopped with no hazard lights on, with the door open on the driver’s side.  “It was close enough that I knew I didn’t have time to brake,” Tessier said. Instead, she swerved to get around the car. Then she looked back in her rear-view mirror and saw something else hit the vehicle.  “I saw a body go over the car, it was like a rag doll,” Tessier said. “I shouted to my daughter to call 911 with my cellphone.”  The jury is composed of 10 men and two women, while three weeks have been set aside for the trial.  The two victims were from St-Constant."

859688,Burtess,2014-06-20 21:07:00,901,"Driving home last week there was a turtle crossing the two lane road in the oncoming lane.  First thought was to pull a u turn and move it to the ditch.  Then I think of the location.... just over the crest of a hill... if I stop either my car would not be seen or they would see the car but not see me and I get run over...... to bad for the turtle! This girl had absolutely no common sense and is like many fanatical animal lovers today, they see an animal in peril and they will do anything for it, even if it means risking their life or someone else.  It's like they go into a trance.  Burt"
859701,Sharkbait22,2014-06-20 22:51:00,297,Stupid move for sure but lets say her car stalled for some reason or there was an accident in front of her.  Everyone must travel at a speed and pay attention such that you can stop in such circumstances.
859702,Big Cliff,2014-06-20 22:55:00,6899,"Oh, like I'm sure she thought about it.... gee, ""save some ducks kill some people"". I am quite sure she didn't think that someone would rear end her and die.  As for drunk drivers: I know of one that drove a transport truck into a car on the QEW and killed two people, he got two years less a day. He was so drunk that he didn't even know he had hit anyone. If that isn't a slap on the wrist then what is?"
859709,Joey,2014-06-20 23:36:00,9122,"I think that is the point Cliff.  She didn't think it would happen, yet it did.  So she is now found guilty of negligence because she was negligent in not thinking about the consequences of her actions.  Those actions caused the death of two people."
859713,bow slayer,2014-06-21 00:05:00,1074,"very unfortunate all round,but sending her to prison serves what purpose,only to basically end a third life,there should be a punishment for her bad desicion but prison is not it.  very tragic"
859716,SirCranksalot,2014-06-21 00:31:00,3291,"I'm not sure what weight, if any, the courts give 'intent'. As the old saying goes----the road to hell is paved with good intentions. As I see it, it's the actions, not the thought process, that count."
859731,BillM,2014-06-21 03:37:00,17367,"Stupid move for sure but lets say her car stalled for some reason or there was an accident in front of her.  Everyone must travel at a speed and pay attention such that you can stop in such circumstances.  Good point.  If the motorcyclists weren't paying attention and slammed into the back of a disabled car, who's at fault now?   The guy who's car broke down?   I highly doubt it.   Even in this case, the motorcyclist has to take some responsibility."
859735,crappieperchhunter,2014-06-21 04:02:00,2582,I am the first person to pull over for a turtle on the road. Couldn't begin to guess how many over the years. But this moron didn't pull over...they flat out stopped on a highway.   The thought of someone being that stupid just angers me...I can't begin to understand how the family of the people who where killed feel.  Sorry Cliff I feel that this was 100% avoidable if the dumb driver had just got the hell off the highway. I'm not sure what good prison will do...but they should never be allowed to drive again...period. Actions like that don't deserve a second chance in my books.
859736,Sandbag,2014-06-21 04:45:00,533,"Drunk drivers kill people every day and they get a slap on the wrist! If she had plowed through these ducks and one had flown into these bikers and they had lost control and died who would you blame then? I'm sorry, what she did might have been the wrong thing to do but she tried to do what she thought was right! I don't think the penalty fits the crime.   I'm not sure that we know the penalty yet do we Cliff.....I agree her heart had no malice whatsoever......but also had a huge lapse in judgement.  very sad story all around.  Cheers  Craig"
