860688,Parnelly,2014-06-28 15:34:00,108,"I recently just bought a Kirkland deep cycle battery. My question is, can I use the deep cycle for cranking as well. I have a 2010 20hp merc. I still have the cranking battery, but im wondering due to weight and space, should I bother to install both batteries? One simply for cranking the motor, and the deep cycle for electronics? Being that its a 20 and likely doesnt have a real big draw for firing, would it be bad thing to simply switch to the deep cycle for cranking and electronics?"
