860767,Shloim,2014-06-29 15:11:00,515,"I have a minn kota 55lb riptide hand control bow mounted motor and It just stopped working. So I took it apart looking for something and found nothing noticeably wrong. So my dilemma is that although its not what i really want, when it was working I was happy enough with it. But it broke, so before I put any money into it do I just get a foot control as that is what I really want. Or does anyone think Im getting this fixed inexpensively??? I would much prefer to not spend the money "

Grant Mills Boat Tech in Pickering will set you up. He is an authorized Minn Kota repair/ dealer. Great person to deal with.  Cheers, Ron..."
860827,bigbuck,2014-06-29 21:58:00,2449,Check the fuses and/or circuit breaker to see if there is power going from the battery to the unit. Hopefully it is something that is an easy fix.

The nice part about a powerdrive or a V2 is that you can add copilot to the one or I pilot to the other eventually and it makes them more versatile!  But, if overall you where happy enough with the unit, it might be just as worthwhile to get it fixed and use it while saving for the unit you really want!"
