860621,maestrolaker,2014-06-27 19:21:00,7,Would love to hear if anyone and Laker jigging with any consistency and if so if they would be willing to share anything on the topic.  I've seen a few videos of some early and late season stuff out of Michigan but wondering if anybody has found a pattern on Lake Ontario for this time of year

860624,maestrolaker,2014-06-27 19:40:00,7,Sorry for my ignorance but haven't had the opp to fish here a great deal yet.  The Niagara bar being the big flat at the mouth of the river? Are people just drifting and jigging?  I was out in that area a couple of weeks back and saw a couple of people jigging near the marker bouys at the mouth but not much else.  We trolled around the area and caught a couple decent fish but all in all pretty slow
860626,Sharkbait22,2014-06-27 20:15:00,297,The bar is just to the west of the mouth although the mouth can produce lots of fish too.  The Bar has less current but sometimes wind. A trolling motor anchor would help keep lines short and tight.  Lots of fun. It's such a big river mouth that you never know what might be caught!
