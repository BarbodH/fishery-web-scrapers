Not familiar with your area, but here until mid May they seem to be in sheltered areas to spawn, the same areas that largemouth frequent to spawn a week or two later.  Marinas with rip rap shores shallow bays with a mix of gravel and weed bottoms? and any cover like wood pilings and docks in shallow water. I am just guessing your spawn runs a bit later than ours."
