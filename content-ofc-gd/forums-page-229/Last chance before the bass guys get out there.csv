860633,kickingfrog,2014-06-27 21:20:00,8333,A good day fishing but a frustrating one as well. Lots of action but a few musky follows that ended in no hook-ups and a group of gar that we couldn't get to bite left more questions and a lot of what ifs.  First fish of the day was a smallmouth out of 12 fow on a double 10.  Since we've established that the suspending husky jerk works we tried just about everything else in the box.  White x-rap   Perch crankbait   Live target herring        
860635,fishing n autograph,2014-06-27 21:22:00,2540,Nice fish! I'm dying  to get out...haven't been for 2 years
860667,Tim Mills,2014-06-28 02:50:00,476,you guys are really getting your money's worth out of the new boat
860678,kickingfrog,2014-06-28 12:14:00,8333,That's the idea. If I didn't use this one it would be hard to justify the next one.
860692,grimsbylander,2014-06-28 16:20:00,3016,"Very nice fish. I have to comment on the fact the water is calm, you're not alone in the boat and still you wear a PDF. You set a good example."
860696,kickingfrog,2014-06-28 17:11:00,8333,"It's a habit I got into when I used to do some whitewater canoeing and solo canoe tripping. I also grew up on, and in the water and back BK (before Kids) I used to do a lot of triathlons. I have a healthy respect for water and part of it is setting an example for my young kids but I also fish with a few people who don't know how to swim. With the inflatables it's easy now. I put it on and don't even think about it until I get in the car to go home."
860701,Joeytier,2014-06-28 18:27:00,3990,Very nice pike.  I went and got a stringer of smallies today which was a blast but thise guys are always more fun
