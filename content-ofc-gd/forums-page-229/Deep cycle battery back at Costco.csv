857936,Consigliere,2014-06-12 20:27:00,121,"Deep cycle is best for trolling motor only.  Get the one with the highest Ah (amp hours) and you will get the longest run.  Deep cycle need to be kept charged, you can't let them go or they will never charge back fully.  On board charger is a good thing to have with them so you can just plug in when done fishing."
858170,captpierre,2014-06-13 20:47:00,2521,My deep cycle Dekas lasted 7 yrs  LeBaron sells some
858259,msp,2014-06-14 00:43:00,1336,So now Im just confused....... a yes or no question. Are the Costco deep cycle batteries a good deal ?
858268,Sinker,2014-06-14 01:56:00,8692,"Yes, they are great mike.  S."
858271,Matt Janes,2014-06-14 02:16:00,49,"I guess my question really was: Is a marine battery that says just ""deep cycle"" better than a battery that says ""deep cycle/starting"" if it is only being used for a trolling motor?  Even if the ""deep cycle"" battery has say 115 Amp hours. And the ""deep cycle/starting"" has 120 amp hours? As the Costco batteries earlier in this thread show.  I recall reading somewhere that this is the case but wanted to be sure."
858297,bigbuck,2014-06-14 10:26:00,2449,"Matt, the so called dual purpose batteries deep cycle/starting are not real deep cycle batteries. They would not be my first choice for a trolling motor battery. They do not work as well with the depletion and recharge cycles. Get the biggest one you can afford or fit in your boat. As mentioned above, Costco is a great place to buy them."
858298,lew,2014-06-14 10:38:00,12766,"Costco is a great place to buy them.  As I mentioned in another thread, I just picked up a pair of Group 27 deep cycle Kirklands from Costco for $95 each.  Never tried them before but lotsa guys around here like them so I figured I'd give em a go."
858326,Pikeslayer,2014-06-14 15:12:00,1443,YES
858328,Steve,2014-06-14 15:18:00,2075,"man, running 12 months a year, and using my batteries through December, January, and February, I wish I could get 5-7 years out of my batteries.  If I can get 3, I'm lucky (that's with keeping them at 100%).  Once they drop below 80% on a full charge, I sell them off (or most recently, given them away).  these are group 29 batteries."
858330,Sinker,2014-06-14 15:22:00,8692,"I get about 3-4 yrs on mine as well, but I bet 95% of my battery use is steady trolling with the bowmount. I turn it on once, and it basically stays on until I'm done fishing. Its hard on batteries.  S."
860261,Parnelly,2014-06-25 12:24:00,108,"Can anyone confirm if these deep cycles are available at Peterborough Costco? Tried looking online, only found charge units, no deep cycles."
860275,Consigliere,2014-06-25 13:58:00,121,The local Costco inventory for batteries is never online.  All the stores normally have them in stock though...but since it was just bass opener they may be down.
860278,Parnelly,2014-06-25 14:21:00,108,Hey thanks for the response. Ill stop in today and see if they have any stock.
860328,Parnelly,2014-06-25 19:44:00,108,Indeed they are at Peterborough Costco. Picked one up this aft.
860332,Sinker,2014-06-25 19:55:00,8692,"Kawartha battery is cheaper for the same size battery....fyi....good batteries too. I have a pair in my boat now. Costco batts are great too, though.  S."
860417,Lucky Linda,2014-06-26 10:56:00,93,Yesterday we bought the Costco starting deep cycle in London for $105. They had lots of marine use batteries.
860418,Lucky Linda,2014-06-26 10:57:00,93,Oh and they have a good boat cover for $99!
691512,bassfighter,2012-04-30 18:43:00,366,"Saw Deep cycle battery back at Costco, 650 amp for $80, while 750 amp for $90. They are decent for the price and warranty has always been the best in the industry.  They also have dual purpose battery. For trolling , I would suggest use single Deep cycle, my battery lasted me for 5 years with proper maintenance. I read on line the Dual purpose is not as powerful for trolling.  It was discontinued last year and now back on the shelves. Autospot sells trolling motor battery for $85."
691611,soobnoob,2012-04-30 20:52:00,55,perfect timing.... i need one!!! thanks for the heads up
691645,Roy,2012-04-30 22:26:00,13728,Are these the Kirkland batteries?
691665,Wolf 3,2012-04-30 23:01:00,134, Yes
691683,NANUK,2012-04-30 23:36:00,797,"Deep cycle batteries usually have ""Amp Hour"" rating Starting batteries usually have ""Cold Cranking Amp"" ratings Are you sure the ones you mention are deep cycle? Just wondering"
691726,Wolf 3,2012-05-01 00:43:00,134, I noticed them at Costco the other day as well.  They had the  Kirkland group 27 size deep cycle battery for $89.99. Will check the amp hour next time I'm there.
691731,ecmilley,2012-05-01 00:50:00,2163,"that a great price for a 27 series battery, my cost from my battery supplier is way above that for a 27 series dc"
691767,Sinker,2012-05-01 02:05:00,8692,I'll have to go get one tomorrow.  S.
691787,bassfighter,2012-05-01 04:34:00,366,"Costco battery warranty are the best,no question ask policy even after 3 years.  make sure to check the manufacture date as well, to ensure you are getting one made this year not last year. Do not disregard the sticker that show the date 5/02, useful info when battery gets damage and need replacement warranty.  My car and boat has their battery for the past 15 years. only car battery got damage after 3 years and they prorated the cost of the battery , they have 48 months warranty on their batteries."

691952,cityfisher,2012-05-01 18:01:00,959,agreed.. they are the best.. just bought a new one for my Trailer.. cant go wrong

692040,Billy Bob,2012-05-01 22:38:00,5865,"I have found the dual purpose batteries make GREAT main engine starting batteries (my outboard is only 50hp) and they run EVERYTHING from VHF radio, 2 LMS 520C graphs, etc.....everything EXCEPT my trolling motor...the last 1 lasted 9+ years......but I do have a onboard dual charger that is ALWAYS plugged in when the boat in not fishing or being trailered."
692063,Dan668,2012-05-01 23:48:00,1120,"I was considering the costco ones, but than they disappeared. I went with a group 31 anyways. Have 3, paid 140 for the first two, 150 for the next. I think they were rated 810CA, 225 min and made by Trojan. Seem to work good soo far.  If your looking for a 27 costco or walmarts seem to be the cheapest."
692229,tonyb,2012-05-02 16:52:00,1637,"Sort of related, but wanted to add if you're looking for an extreme marine battery, check out Odyssey Batteries    They are not the cheapest (in fact probably the most expensive!), but they're likely the best.  I picked up the group 31 marine and it is rated at 1150 Cold Cranking Amps!  It also weighs nearly 80lbs hehe  Tony  "
692235,doubleheader,2012-05-02 17:18:00,497,"I just went through a somewhat exhaustive study of batteries; specifically investigating AGM vs traditional wet cell deep cycle.  I had 2 Group 27 Interstates in my boat and wasn't satisfied with my run time. From what I read I felt the best value for a deep cycle application was the Deka group 31 AGM battery sold by Sams Club. AGM's have some specific advantages over wet cell in marine applications, the most important being they are safer, but they also discharge more slowly when stored, recharge more fully over time, and last considerably longer than wet cell batteries. One can expect 6-7 years of service. The biggest disadvantage is weight (not a concern for me) and cost. The Deka's offered at Sam's Club, however, are made in the US, PA to be exact, have a 3 year full replacement warranty and cost only slightly more than a group 31 wet cell @$170 ea. I read many positve reviews on them. In comparison most other AGM batteries of this size and reserve capacity are around $250.00."
692314,tonyb,2012-05-02 20:19:00,1637," That's a great deal! I paid around $500 for my 31 Odyssey.  The specs are better on the Odyssey, but wow, decent specs on the Deka Intimidator for that price!  Can you get them around here anywhere?  Is there Sams Club in Ontario?"
692369,Wolf 3,2012-05-02 23:14:00,134,"   These are the marine batteries available at Costco,  Group 24, deep cycle, 685 MCA, 95 AH, $77.99    Group 27, deep cycle, 750 MCA, 115 AH, $89.99    Group 27, starting/deep cycle, 845 MCA, 120 AH, $99.99  "
692545,doubleheader,2012-05-03 13:48:00,497," Pretty sure if you go on-line and select the Sams Club in your area you can determine if they are stocked in your store. If not, however, it might be worth a call to your Sams Club because AGM's can be shipped with less precautions than wet cell batteries. My understanding is the Sams Clubs in the eastern part of the US stock them but not out west so you have a decent chance to find them. I bought mine at the Lakewood NY store."
692559,Jer,2012-05-03 14:30:00,1426,   I think Sam's Club fled Ontario a few years ago.
692807,ecmilley,2012-05-04 01:11:00,2163,"yes the agm are great, I sell em, made by east penn can be deks or powersurge but as good as even the regular batterys are cannot even begin to compete with costco pricing a 27 series deep cycle i add 10 bux to my cost still have to sell it for $125"
692975,doubleheader,2012-05-04 14:54:00,497,"  I totally agree if the group 27 will provide the needed performance, but unfortuantely I needed more in my heavy 20' boat. I probably should go to a 36 v system, but I'm hopeful the battery upgrade will significantly improve my battery life."
857900,Matt Janes,2014-06-12 18:02:00,49,Just stumbled upon this old thread. Is it better to get the Group 27 Deep Cycle with 750 MCA or the Group 27 Deep Cycle/Starting with 845 MCA if being used exclusively for my trolling motor?
857902,NANUK,2014-06-12 18:19:00,797,"MCA ( marine cranking amps ) Sounds like a cranking or a duel purpose battery, Deep cycles are usually rated in Ah ( amp hour )"
857907,grimsbylander,2014-06-12 18:38:00,3016,MCA is simply a different measurement rating for marine batteries.  CCA is measured at 0 deg. F MCA is measured at 32 deg. F
