860750,skinny,2014-06-29 12:37:00,442,my new to me bow rider is curently being covered by a big grey tarp  I think it needs a boat cover I'd really like a custom mooring cover but dont think it will fit budget  what are people buying that make them happy and work/last  
860751,lew,2014-06-29 13:02:00,12766,"I went with a mooring cover plus a full stand-up cover for my boat and am very happy with everything.  It's the Sunbrella material and was made by a fella that contracted with Hastings Marine although I don't think he's there anymore, but you could call them if interested.      "
860784,landry,2014-06-29 17:11:00,1005,That's a very nice boat Lew.
860787,Cosmos,2014-06-29 17:22:00,588,"Nothing beats custom cover, but they are expencieve. I am using heavy duty storm pro from princess auto."
860805,Big Cliff,2014-06-29 19:27:00,6899,"Love the way you mounted that rod holder Lew! Just gave me an idea.  As for covers, don't cheep out, you'll regret it in the end!"
860850,scugpg,2014-06-30 01:36:00,1373, Otherwise off the shelf costco or princess auto is a good choice.
860874,bigbuck,2014-06-30 11:34:00,2449,"You are looking at over 1k for a custom mooring cover for a bowrider, depends on the size and the material. A cover from CT or PA will be a stop gap measure while you save up for a more permanent solution."
860879,Pguzik,2014-06-30 11:49:00,34,Save your money and grief and don't but anything from Canadian tire or any big box stores. I went to see Greg at Cover Unlimited in Brampton for a custom cover. I promise he will take good care of you and does 110% work.  Good luck
