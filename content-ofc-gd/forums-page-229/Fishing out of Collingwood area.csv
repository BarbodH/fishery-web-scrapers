What happened to this lake, what am I doing wrong or am I spoiled to normally fish out of Lake Ontario.  I fished for about 5 hours so far and not even a sighting. Anyone have any suggestions they care to share.  I am on the lake right now and can only see two other boats fishing. Maybe this is a futile cause?  Been trolling between 2.2- 2.7 mph.  Using both spoons and body baits on very long leads. May try a flie soon.  Problem is only one rod per person (unlike Lake Ontario). And this on a body of water that you definitely need more lines in the water!  Got my son and his cousin joining me tomorrow and wanted to get them into a fish or two. Cousins first time fishing. Otherwise anyone know where I can get them into some perch or other pan fish?  Maybe collingwood harbour area?  Thanks!"

I know I can not escape this place! Grab a small fly rod or ultralight and go fish up on the escarpment for some trout.
860698,misfish,2014-06-28 17:58:00,29133, Yup Troll around with AC shiners or small body baits (flat line) . You can also perch fish out from the old silos. There are pike in there as well.  Good luck
