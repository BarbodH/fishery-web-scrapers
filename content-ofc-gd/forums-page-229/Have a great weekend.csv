In fact, it was the first time since all three if us had been at a game together since 1993. The smile never left my old mans face and that meant a lot to me.  While I was gone my oldest daughter who is now 7 went to get her hair cut for the first time and decided to donate her hair! Boy was I proud!  In the morning I'm going out for bass on the fly for the first time in 2 years"
