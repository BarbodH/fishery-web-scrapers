860652,Raf,2014-06-27 23:39:00,3495,"Hi guys, I found this one hanging not connected to anything.  Can anyone point me to where it should connect to?    it's right by the oil dipstick on a yamaha 40hp 4-stroke"
860653,davey buoy,2014-06-27 23:48:00,5505,Breather hose?You can't find any where within that length to where it may go?
860654,Raf,2014-06-27 23:57:00,3495,no i cannot unless it is underneath / behind the manifold?? directly above?
860655,aplumma,2014-06-28 00:10:00,6896,Open the brass screw 1/2 turn it should let fuel flow out if it is what I think it is. If it does it is the bleed down for the carb. If no fuel then re close the screw 1/2 turn and I have guessed wrong.   Art
860657,Raf,2014-06-28 00:38:00,3495,Art this is a fuel inject motor.  Tho that doesnt mean you are wrong.  If I do turn it and fuel comes out what do I do with it
860665,mike rousseau,2014-06-28 01:59:00,4661,Looks like a fuel drain line to me
860666,Raf,2014-06-28 02:23:00,3495,"well, I will feel silly (but relieved) if that's what it is.  i'll give the screw a quick turn tomorrow and if i get fuel coming out i guess it is safe to assume it's the drain"
860675,TennesseeGuy,2014-06-28 10:15:00,957,Possibly in place to drain ethanol gas before it does more harm.
860677,aplumma,2014-06-28 11:36:00,6896,Yes it also applies to fuel Injected motors  I am used to working on the carb. engines because it is what I own. Same principle though.     Art
