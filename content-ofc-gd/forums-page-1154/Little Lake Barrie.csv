I guess I needed to be reminded of the mental benefits that a day on the water provides.  Reserved a boat on Thursday, $15.00 and hour to a max of $60.00 per day, reservations are held until 8 AM. Cedar Park Campground.  Arrived at 7:30 (Poker night with the boys helped me be a bit sluggish) to find that there was about 25 boats on the lake already. Little lake is a small lake about 2.5 Km at it's widest, and if you don't like weeds you may want to skip this one. It was about 17 degrees, and there was little cloud cover.  I was out on the lake by 7:45.  Being the first time on the lake I went for a quick trip to check things out. Weeds, grass, and more weeds. Not sure what to use I turned to the old red devil, it always produces. I anchored and begun casting. I switched spoons a few times moved locations, with no success. Switched to worms for a while to see if the was any thing alive in the lake...Pulled in three or four sunfish..""Well I won't get skunked"" was my thought...  I figured that casting was not working, or my location sucked, figured that trolling would be the answer. I put on a Mepps Cyclopes and headed to the back of the lake. Around 9 AM I nailed the first Pike, the perfect hammer handle, but still it was a pike and where there are little ones there should be big ones.  I trolled for the next hour or so catching about 4 more each bigger then the last. Around ten I nailed the biggest of the day, just under 2 feet. This is when I started to think that having a net may be a good idea, oh well...  I stayed in that area for the next hour or so trolling until it got too shallow, and turning around. Drifting and casting and the trolling some more. The action was fantastic, bringing 10 in the boat in about 90 minutes. All small but really aggressive, one even came opposite the lure and smashed it right in front of the boat. I could only see 3/4 of an inch of the top of the mepps sticking out of it mouth. Wow! Been a while since I've seen that.  Good action in the shallow water too, although it's tough to keep the lure out of the weeds.  All in all I had a great day. It is not northern Ontario where the big pike are, but it is only 20 minutes from home and the action was great.  Next time I'll try and find some bass, but me thinks I'll need to read up on weedless rigs...  If you go, watch out for the big snags, I had three that turned out to be pike that took me into the weeds. Fish and salad to go....."

109706,Rizzo,2007-09-02 18:18:00,4754,good report.  Whenever I drive past there I'm shocked there are any fish in that lake anymore.  25 boats sounds like a typical Saturday or Sunday.  Guess catch and release is working!  If they were pickerel instead of stinkin slimy pike that lake would be empty by now
