I was looking at Canal, Balsam, Rice or Scugog. While I would love to land a monster, quantity is just as important as the two of us are somewhat new to muskie fishing.  And a second quick question does anyone have any boat rental suggestions for these lakes?  thanks in advance for your answers  Jonaton"
109866,Smokey,2007-09-03 13:49:00,1278,I would think scugog would probably have your best chance for a fish. May not be a monster but you should be able to find some action there. I live just off Rice and finding Muskies in there is tough so it's an easy one to cross off the list.
109876,fishinfool,2007-09-03 14:02:00,366,Musky fishing is great in Balsam. You can rent a boat in Coboconk at Thompson's Marine right under the bridge at the falls. Good Luck and take lots of pics  SS
