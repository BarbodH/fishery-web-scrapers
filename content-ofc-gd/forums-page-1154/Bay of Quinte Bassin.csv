We got blown around a lot by a real stiff South-Easterly wind but managed to put some fish in the boat.  Highlight of the day was my Grandson getting his first Largie... on a tube bait.  It was well worth the trip.   My Son got this nice fish   Nice little Largie for Gramps   My Grandson's Largie - ok you have to hold it for the photo I say ""No Way""   Grandson's first Lip Grip He's hooked now.  Great Day."
