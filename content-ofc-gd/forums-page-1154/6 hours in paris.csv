109597,tbayboy,2007-09-02 00:02:00,1497,"Just when I thought I wasn't going to have any fishing plans for today I got a PM last night from fatherof3 offering to show me the sights of the Grand and Nith rivers in Paris.  I'd read his posts over the last little while about the 2 pike under the bridge that kept taunting him.  I figured I've caught a pike or two so lets check it out.  First off - Paris is a great little fishing spot.  When I pulled up and FatherOf3 was standing around with no car I kinda wondered what the deal was but it turns out you can't really live in Paris and be more than a 15 minute walk from the rivers.  The fishing opportunities are just great with Bass, Pike and Trout all available.  Or at least so I was told ....  We spent the late morning/afternoon covering a lot of interesting water and we had a few of these guys show up :  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1193/1297680151_8e6492bb05_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Paris - Sept1-1"" /></a>  Unfortunately we never did find the big one.   We also managed a couple chubs (thats a first for me - weird fish) and I managed to get a sucker on a crank bait (go figure).  Then just at the end of the day my x-rap went a little crazy -woohoo - finally got a good one.  Get a glimpse and what do you know, I've snagged a carp on its top fin.  I don't have any pics but Father does.  Now I kinda get the whole carp fetish - they sure do put up a fun fight (and this was just a 7 or 8 lber).  Once she calmed down a quick flip of the pliers and of she went with a couple little holes in her back but I'm sure she'll be fine.  Anyhow, not a great day of fishing but I'm stoked that Fatherof3 took me around the Paris area.  I'm definitely going to be back again, I'm not sure what were doing wrong but I'm sure there's some nice fish in there and its amazing how much water you can cover just by walking around town.   Thanks again for the nice tour - I'm sure the fish are there somewhere  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1018/1298549512_26dc5f8d71_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Paris - Sept1-2"" /></a>"

109599,Greencoachdog,2007-09-02 00:13:00,8163,Great river report and pics!!!
109601,PatrickGG,2007-09-02 00:24:00,562,Awesome report! I never fished Paris dam does it hold any walleye?
109604,fatherof3,2007-09-02 00:32:00,1769,"as far as I know walleye only get as far as Wilkes dam in Brantford.The Paris dam would have bass,pike,trout at certain times of the year.I have even heard of an odd salmon not sure if that is true or not."
109620,huntervasili,2007-09-02 02:22:00,1604,Nice report... I enjoy fishing some of the same spots you mentioned and have pulled a couple nice ones out of the dam
109650,Burtess,2007-09-02 12:57:00,901,"Years ago I used to fish at the Paris dam for smallmouth in through October, really could count on some big ones that time of year.  I have seen a couple salmon trying to negotiate the dam there. Are you still allowed to fish off the rocks right at the base of the dam (on the east side) or is it now posted as no fishing?  Burt"

109686,Mike Pike,2007-09-02 15:08:00,1332,"Always enjoy the river reports, so thanks for the post and pics, even if it wasn't as productive a day as you'd hoped for.  But that's river fishing, isn't it.  Wading the Grand and it's tributaries can be hit and miss.  And even when the fish are co-operating, they can run on the smaller side.  The rewards for those River-rats who persevere, though, are great!"
