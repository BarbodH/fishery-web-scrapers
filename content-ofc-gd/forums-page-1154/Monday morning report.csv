I stretched and did exercises this morning to loosen up enough to head for work.  Next I'll hang upside down for a few minutes, ride my recumbent bike and then do a little weight work.  After that I'll head in to pull the plow for a few hours.  It's been 16 days since my last meal of walleyes and I miss them."

109792,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-03 02:14:00,957,"JohnG, will get you a PM.  Don't want DM to know my plans.  Don't want him in my cabin when I'm out on the water."
