The reel with that line on would most likely be used to fish for pike, carp or maybe salmon but I have a few questions.....  For the pike  - assume the best think would be to tie on a wire leader between lure and braided line (as I would do when using normal mono as my mainline)?  For the carp - can I tie a hook straight to the power pro or should I tie myself a leader of 14lb mono and tie the hook to that?  For the Salmon (probably too early yet) - do I tie a cleo spoon straight to the power-pro or do I tie a mono leader or even use a wire leader?  Thanks in advance for the advice and feedback.  007"

110085,snag,2007-09-04 03:46:00,1932,What pound line are you using?  Dougs got the knots.  I'm so lazy that I use uni for everything.  Bring nail clippers and tie directly to your leader.  I would recommend an 80lb. floro leader for pike which will work for Salmon too.  Now you'll use braid 80% of the time.  Good luck!
110086,MJL,2007-09-04 03:50:00,2427,"Like douG stated I tie on a snap swivel for chucking cleos for salmon and a wire leader for pike.  For the carp, I often tie hair rigs out of PowerPro - It's supple and very strong.  The downside of using PowerPro for hair rigs (or as a leader material to tie a hook on) is it's prone to severe tangling when casting heavier weights. You can use an anti-tangle system like rig-tubing above your weight or leadcore.  Mono hair rigs generally don't tangle.  I use both PowerPro and mono for my leaders and either way works."
