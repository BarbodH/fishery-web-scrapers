109014,fatherof3,2007-08-30 13:56:00,1769,great report and a bunch of fish
109015,TennesseeGuy,2007-08-30 13:57:00,957,"Glenn, that was a good dam report.  Same here on minnows at the usual spots.  Last week I drove 45 miles to the Big Bait Dealer and picked up 3 pounds of large tuffies for $27. Packed them in salt, 20 Mule Team Borax, and garlic powder.  After 20 hours or so spread them on a towel in the sun to dry before storing them in quart Ziplock bags and then into the freezer.  I promised them a trip up north sometime in late September or early October.  Fall walleyes will know what to do with them."
109023,Roy,2007-08-30 14:10:00,13728,A good report Bubba. Quite the variety of fish too. So you have saltwaters and freshwaters in the same body of water then? (stripers)
