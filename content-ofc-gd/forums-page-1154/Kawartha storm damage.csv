I posted last week about a severe storm that hit the Peterboro area and did some damage in our trailer park, so I thought I'd share a couple pictures of a cottage that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This tree was probably 30"" wide across the trunk so the cottage didn't have a chance, but fortunately there was nobody around it, so there were no injuries. Another tree came down about 100 yards away and hit a trailer but didn't do any serious damage to it.  Scary stuff, but like I said, no injuries and buildings can easily be replaced.  Keep your head up when the winds start to howl    "

109952,Fisherman,2007-09-03 20:26:00,7201,"That looks pretty much like a right off and total rebuild coming, could have been a tragic ending for someone.  Hope they had some insurance.  Kinda makes me glad my old trailer is a little further away from the big trees."
109953,PatB,2007-09-03 20:31:00,104,"Hi Lew, That's a bit of damage, glad no one was in there.  That was a nice musky that you caught.  I fished for another 4hrs. not even a follow........ I'll be up there in couple of weeks give it another shot."
