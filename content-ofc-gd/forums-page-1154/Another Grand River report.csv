110044,tbayboy,2007-09-04 01:45:00,1497,"After a less than stellar performance Sunday on Buckhorn I hooked up with PatrickG for an afternoon of smallie hunting on the Grand River.  I knew I was in trouble when he caught the first fish of the day on the second cast.  Fine fine, let me get the camera out - DOH.  Batteries are dead    Can't believe I didn't try it before we left the van.  Sigh.  I took a couple casts but couldn't handle the idea of not having the camera with me so I slouched my way out of the water and as I left I joked with Patrick that that he'd probably catch a big one while I was gone.  15 minutes I'm almost back at the bank and I hear ""Seaaaannn... get over here""  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1190/1315925893_9ae0b7c0fe_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1740"" /></a>  You gotta be kidding me.  Ok, quickly I start tossing my tube out and what happens:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1152/1316811230_3d62fed3f2_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1741"" /></a>  3 nothing and I've had maybe 4 casts so far.  An hour later and its 7 nothing including this nice one along with smaller ones  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1408/1316821022_d4698d3841_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1759"" /></a>  At this point I've already switched to the same tube but no luck so now I'm blaming my line (yeah I'm desperate).  Anyhow, off I go back to the van AGAIN to switch to a braid (stretch be damned) and I bring back a secret weapon - the chug bug topwater I'd forgotten twice already.  Pat manages to land a couple more little guys and I missed one topwater hit but finally I get a real hit on the chug bug, the battle is a tough one but I finally land my first topwater fish of the year  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1420/1316822810_686dfc75c8_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1760"" /></a>  Now its about 12 to 3 I think ... guess who's holding the next one: <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/1316824660_b6221a2745_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1762"" /></a>  yup.  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1340/1316796726_e03e6dd8fb_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1763"" /></a>  But things are looking up, I quickly land another with the top water after missing a big blowup:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1035/1316799064_daef3db5dd_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1766"" /></a>  Notice the enthusiasm I'm showing there .  At this point I go back to the magic tube but with the nicer line and finally, just as we're about to call it a day I get a decent fish  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1015/1316802798_b5016704cd_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1767"" /></a>  And then just as we're leaving I land one more  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1193/1316800860_6a76e70cf9_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1768"" /></a>  So at least I got the last fish even if the final score was probably something like 15 to 5.  Ahh well, I'll beat ya next time.  Was a great day out there and I managed to get a bit of video as well - watch my frustration rise   <object width=""425"" height=""353""><param name=""movie"" value=""  "
