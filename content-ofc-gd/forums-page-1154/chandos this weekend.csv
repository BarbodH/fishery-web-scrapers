How deep are the trout running right now?  Is it true that if you use a larger lure, you get larger fish, or will larger fish still go after a small lure?"
109290,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-31 13:00:00,698,You should be able to catch a few nice Pike up there. Use a 5 of diamonds spoon or a white spinner bait with a grub trailer. Run them over weedbeds that are about 5-6 feet deep during the morning time and it should produce you some pike.
109377,eyefish,2007-08-31 18:12:00,135,I am surprised that all you have caught up there are 2 lbers....there are lots of huge fish in there I was up there last weekend and caught 2 HAWGS...1 almost 6 and one pushing 8..the bigger one was on a senko and the smaller one(funny when you call a 6 lber a smaller one) but he was on the flippin jig. Try deep weedlines

109804,mgrieve,2007-09-03 02:48:00,20,"Again, another DRY weekend! I fished the bays, the rocks, the weeds...Nothing. I was using a mepps, tried jitterbugs, brass spoons, some minnow jerk baits, hula poppers, etc... NOTHING! We used a depth finder and were fishing from 6-12 feet. tried South Bay, Doc Evans Bay, etc... What am I doing wrong?"
