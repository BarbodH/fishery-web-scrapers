109918,silveradosheriff,2007-09-03 17:13:00,1025,Took the boat out on lake 'O' yesterday (first time for the boat) with Iceguy to chase some salmon. Lots of action early as shown by Iceguy.       Got some size as well with a PB for myself - thanks to some good coaching!       Went out again this morning with a couple of buddies.  Tough water out there today - 4/6 in 2 hrs with two shakers and two teens.  :-)
