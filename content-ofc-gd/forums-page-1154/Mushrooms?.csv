109931,Roy,2007-09-03 18:29:00,13728,"I found a bunch of these in a part of the garden that I don't visit very often. Can someone here tell me what they are and if they are edible? They're all about 3-4"" across.  Thank you. "
109934,Tacklebuster,2007-09-03 18:34:00,303,"I would definately get a book and look it up before eating it, and I think there is something called a spore test to help identify with certainty the type of mushroom it is."
109936,Roy,2007-09-03 18:35:00,13728,Thanks TB.
109937,ehg,2007-09-03 18:39:00,2666,"Yeah, they are probably edible, looks like an Agaricus (related to store bought mushrooms). It's probably a 'horse mushroom' , check for bugs and their tunnels. Bright white gills would be 'Death Angels' but brown gills are cool. Gotta be careful.  ehg"
109959,Kawartha Kev,2007-09-03 20:45:00,281,"I would agree witht the horse mushroom identity. It is also known as a meadow mushroom and by the latin name Agaricus campestris and apparently is edible and defintely related to your common store bought white ""button"" mushrooms but won't do anything for you if you are looking for shrooms fi you know what I mean    Anyway here is a link  http://www.perspective.com/nature/fungi/agaricus.html  Enjoy Kawartha Kev"

109963,addict,2007-09-03 21:10:00,475,"mushrooms are cheap to buy go to the grocerry store unless u are 100 percent sure.mushrooms can be hard to identify,many deadly ones have no tell tale signs like stinging or bad taste some take several hours for sickness or death to occur.ive only had 2 different wild mushrooms puffballs and morell.both times someone with expierence had picked them be careful man."
