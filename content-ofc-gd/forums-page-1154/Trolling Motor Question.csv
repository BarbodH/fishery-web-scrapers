You can also check Gagnons in Oshawa as I know they used to be a dealer, but not sure if they still are after the fire.  I recently purchased a MinnKota myself and found LeBarons to be cheaper than BPS."

Personally, I would not buy from LB's no matter what. I think BPS is a little pricey for this stuff, but they most likely have stock and when they go on sale there, it is probably competitive.  I love the motor and would buy another in a heart beat."

Le Baron's probably will be the cheapest for buying at a store.  When I bought my Minn Kota, Cabela's was cheaper than buying local; that was in 1994 so that may not be the case anymore."
