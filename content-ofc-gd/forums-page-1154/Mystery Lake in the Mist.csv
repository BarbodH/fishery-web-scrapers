109516,brandon,2007-09-01 04:11:00,857,Weather slightly cleared here later in the day and after work I decided to head up seymour again hoping for some good photo opportunities.  When I got to the parking lot about 900m above sea level I was almost at the height of the clouds.  Now I normally hate taking pics in these conditions because the lighting is horrible.  But I looked up the trail a bit and the clouds were starting to roll right across this place where Mystery Lake is.  I hauled my ass up there and took a few panoramic photos.......All taken within 2 minutes of each other        I was kinda hoping for a rainbow to peek out of the clouds but not today.  Hope you enjoy

109537,mcallister.grant,2007-09-01 13:13:00,327,Beautiful pics... I was thinking the same thing solopaddler. Any fish in that lake?
109542,brandon,2007-09-01 14:20:00,857,nope no fish at all.  just lots and lots of mudpuppies.  When the weather is nice theres usually lots of people swimming up there.
109544,addict,2007-09-01 14:29:00,475,i love smoke on the water
109586,Greencoachdog,2007-09-01 23:38:00,8163,Excellent pics as always Brandon!!!  Seems like a sin to be that close to the water and not be fishin'!  Still no tackle???
109605,Dozer,2007-09-02 00:32:00,896,Oh my %@# ...  I could spend three days there just sitting.
