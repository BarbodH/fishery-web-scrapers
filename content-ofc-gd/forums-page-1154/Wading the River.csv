109692,Mike Pike,2007-09-02 16:04:00,1332,"My Labour Day Weekend started with a few hours of fishing in the K-W area.  The Grand River and it's tributaries offer a lot of opportunities for us 'river rats' and wader fishing is probably my favorite way to fish of all.  When I arrived, I found another fisherman working the water.   Lots of scrapy little Smallies on this day but they were all on the small side and not 'pic worthy.'  lol  But I was pleasantly surprised when this guy showed up on the end of my #3 Mepps.   Also hooked into a Perch a little later which surprised me because I honestly didn't know the River held any up this way.  Also surprised pleasantly hooking into this little 13-inch Laremouth, which I would have to be happy with as the big fish of the day.   Now about the one that got away.  A nice no-less-than 3lbs Smallie was all over my Mepps spinner and went airborn.  I really wanted him for the camera so I lowered my rod tip to hopefully keep him from performing any more of those jumps.  Well, while fumbling for the camera( and countng my chickens before that hatch )he got off.  Dohhh!  Lesson learned, though.  Anyhoo, an enjoyable time on( and in )the water. "
