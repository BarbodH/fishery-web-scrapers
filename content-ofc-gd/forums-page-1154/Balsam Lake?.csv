109847,Terry,2007-09-03 11:48:00,14456,"I have heard that the pike have moved there from canal lake but I have never seen one and when they get to a new lake you should see hunderds of little pike and that just has not happened but there are muskie, that might be what they were thinking  the walleye fishing has been slow this year for me but the smallmouth bass has been good any rocky shoreline or hump or point or where rocks meet weeds seems to hold them"
109856,fishinfool,2007-09-03 13:21:00,366,"My family has a cottage on Balsam for 35 years and I have been fishing it for that long. In all that time, I have heard once or twice that a pike was caught but never actually seen one. The Musky are there in abundance if you know where to go though. Good Luck, take pics  SS"
109868,bbog,2007-09-03 13:51:00,665,The Walleye in this lake seem to all fall in the restricted size. Decent smallmouth though.
109869,Pike_Nut71,2007-09-03 13:52:00,18,"Thinking Pike all the time...Can't get them out of my head...But I have heard that area is mostly Muskie.. I gather the two don't really like to share the same water....  Thanks for the replies, I'll post a report upon my return...with pics if I figure that part out..."
109943,mattyk,2007-09-03 18:54:00,2110,"There are pike in balsam lake, but not too many. Here is one that i caught this summer while muskie fishing. Also caught a nice little largie on my muskie spinner bait.    "
