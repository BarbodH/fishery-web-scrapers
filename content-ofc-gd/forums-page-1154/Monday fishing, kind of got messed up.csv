110015,evster,2007-09-04 00:44:00,367,"My original plans for this weekend were to take my brother in law and dad walleye and steelhead fishing with a friend of mine who runs a charter boat, but that got cancelled due to a last minute charter booking so we had to figure out what to do.  My dad has a boat in Turkey Point marina so we decided we'd drag out the inflatable boat and park out by pottohawk island and try out a weedline first thing in the morning before the boats all move in.  Ended up not being able to find the weedline we were looking for so about 9 we tied the boat back on and dragged it across the bay to Bluffs Bar.  Got over there and it was pretty rough, waves were probably 2-3 feet so we anchored the big boat in about 15 feet of water before getting to close to the bar and tried our luck there for a few minutes.  We noticed a boat in awfully shallow water and people swimming around it and wondered why anyone would want to be swimming in such rough water.  Not long after another guy comes over in a zodiac and asks us if we can give them a hand pulling this boat off the bar.  Some guy got his 35 footer stuck dead center of the bar!  I don't know how he got so far in but he did and he was good and stuck in water that wasn't even to my knees.  So anyway, we used the two zodiacs to dig a trench in front of the boat and one guy cranked in the anchor.  And slowly but surely we moved it out.  It took about 4 anchor chain lengths and about an hour and a half but we got it out.  After this the other guys didn't feel like fishing so after a grand total of 40 minutes fishing I was done for the day.  Kinda sucked in terms of fishing but I was glad I could help someone out.  And the moral of the story is....if you are driving at night, make sure you know where you are going."
