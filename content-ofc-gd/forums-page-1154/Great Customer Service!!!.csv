Turns to me and asks if I have my unit there and I bring in it and he sets it up as per his, including updating my operation software - no charge. Not rocket science but a definite improvement over the way I had it set-up (especially some of the gps related stuff).  This guy really knows what he is doing!  Always nice to get more than you bargained for, instead of feeling violated!  :-)"
109755,aniceguy,2007-09-02 22:55:00,1094,jos is a pretty good guy and always can find a deal in there.........
109783,fishdawg,2007-09-03 01:57:00,912,one the best shops in the province no doubt
109799,Handlebarz,2007-09-03 02:30:00,3790,I only see them at the shows here in Chatham and in London great people for shure. and the deals they always have them I gotta get to his store but then again I dont know that I cam afford it

I seen a guy that had a brand new Ranger bass boat the dealer had installed a Lowrance network and it didn't work properly 2 minutes outside he new what the problem was and did all the repairs for the guy on the side of the road. He always treats me great, thats why 99% of my buisness goes to him."
