Mikeh and I are going to try Lower buckhorn for the first time on Sunday and we're looking for any advice on where to launch and maybe some general ideas on where to find some bass and/or muskie  (or specific spots, hey a guy can beg right?).  I have the adventure map of the lake and JohhnyBasses report from a couple weeks back (as well as everythign else I can find via this funky intraweb invention of Al Gores) but I'm always looking for more tips, heck I need all the help I can get .  PM me if you want to keep things private, I promise not to give away anything (photoshop guarantee if you want hehe).  Thanks in advance Sean and Mike"

109617,Kawartha Kev,2007-09-02 01:41:00,281,"I posted this to a similar topic earlier don't know if you saw it. I have a cottage on Lower Buckhorn so I know the lake pretty well so hope this helps once again I caution you about the submerged shoals on this lake so be careful especially on the north side of the lake but there are good fishing spots on the north shore. Anyway here is what I posted in the other topic  ""Deer Bay is very open but has some good weedlines to fish for the muskies. One of my favorite areas is just up from Deer Bay called Black Duck Bay. It is very weedy but with lots of good shoreline to cast along but be warned there are lots of submerged rock shoals you can also try the many small rock islands going up Deer Bay Reach to the dam in Buckhorn but again I caution you if you get outside the main channel there are lots of submerged rocks especially on the north side of the lake.  Good Luck Kawartha Kev"

109818,tbayboy,2007-09-03 03:43:00,1497,Thanks for the responses everyone.  Fishing was tough (too say the least) but we learned a few things about the lake.  Now I just gotta learn how do a figure eight (laziest looking muskie follow I've ever seen).
