979467,NAW,2016-08-14 17:21:00,4022,"I realize I could search this out.  But OFC is always good a fast replies.  I have my 36 Lb Endura all torn apart right now, because it hasn't been working right for a while.  Drive pin is broken.  Retaining ring pooped off and stuck to one of the magnets in the motor and has worn down to almost nothing.  A seal is shot, so the motor filled up with water.  One brush is worn down to the wire.  Online, I can find all the parts for about $35 US.  But I've never bought parts from them before, and don't know if I should trust them.  Anyone know a shop I can order them from?  I thought there was one in Orillia that I can get Minkota parts..?  Or if anyone knows a good online place that they trust and could recommend?  I want to get it back together soon!  I need my motor for duck hunting and fall fishing/camping.  Any help is greatly appreciated.!  Thanks,  Nick"

979497,NAW,2016-08-14 21:23:00,4022,"Thanks 206!  I also found both those places.  When I looked on the Minkota website, I actually got a quote from the website (USD Before shipping) and for the seals, drive pin, retaining ring and new brushes it only came to $5!  So cheap!  Prices where similar at the two placed you mentioned above."
