979231,Fisherman,2016-08-11 21:52:00,7201,"Somewhere in the book it also mentions that you must maintain the lighting the way it was designed by the manufacturer, if it came with 2 lights, then that's the minimum.  I'm too lazy right now,  but I'll go the extra mile to ensure people can see the trailer in low light conditions.   No point in garnering interest from a Leo or MTO."
979236,chris.brock,2016-08-11 23:21:00,4053," yes, running one red light = heat score and dangerous too  personally, I wouldn't bother wiring up a light over the plate though"

979273,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-12 07:49:00,8243,"I want my boat trailer lit up like an 18 wheeler. I don't drive much at night anymore but if I do it's generally because I'm heading out early or coming home late with the boat. Why anyone would try to get away with the minimum lighting is beyond me guys. it's not expensive, maybe not cool? I don't know. As far as a light for the plate my tail light/signal assembly on the left side of the trailer has a white light in it to shine on the plate below. The right side does not. I have read that that the plate must be lit in Ontario, I don't know where, it doesn't matter. If it isn't law your going to loose a day of your life telling it to a Judge in some town hours from home because your not getting a ticket where you live you are getting a ticket 8 hours up north. I'm going to ask my pals OPP son when he's home for our Golf Tourney on Labour Day Saturday.  Out in the boonies a STOP  sign on our side roads and concessions is basically a suggestion, especially at night. A Fisherville stop is looking down the cross road as far as possible both ways and continuing at 100K, maybe slow down to 80, it's scary out here at night.  The first time I rode at night with locals it was scary, the guy says as I'm stomping my imaginary passenger side brake pedal as he's doing 110 in a 80 approaching the imaginary STOP "" are we good there slicker? Now hand me a beer, my whiskey is good."" I swear.  Coming across a truck or car load of people, usually kids coming back to the cottage from the bars at 02:30 out in cottage country generally isn't coming home or going to work.  This thread actually is reminding me to get strips of some hi tech reflector for the thing. My to do list for the boat is to change out my mini side markers to something that can actually seen other than a little 1"" amber marker. I switched to halogen tail lights last fall, big difference. I don't think a trailer can be over lit. I just don't get why you would try to get away with the minimum."

This is what they say about license plate lights. license-plate lamp Would fail inspection if. - not white, fails to illuminate license plate when operated by headlamp control - lamp not shielded from projecting light rearward. Yes this is for light duty and passenger vehicles; but it also includes trailers. I can't find the actual highway traffic act number for this; but if you search E-Law long enough you will. Up until these up dated regs, the only light that a cop could write you up for is no license plate light. Once the cops get up to speed on these new regulations they'll be able to write you up on any light on the vehicle the is not functioning as intended. Here's a link to the new safety regs reference hand book, If it's in the safety inspection regs, a cop can act on them. http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/trucks/pdfs/passenger-light-duty-vehicle-inspection-standard.pdf  Dan."

Is there any reason I can't just mount it to the back frame of the trailer with zip ties or wire?  simple answer...no not at all...if the plate is displayed prominently it does not matter how you attach it to the vehicle. (restricting safety concerns)  As a guy into the modified car scene for years many of us mounted our front license plates in interesting ways...it is never an issue until the police cannot see it.  You can definitely zip tie it onto the trailer.
979071,dave524,2016-08-10 19:25:00,4508,I think it has to have a light on it.
979072,Woodsman,2016-08-10 19:44:00,1286,Yes a trailer plate must be lighted at night.

The only ""light"" is the red tail light and we know that that doesn't light spit.  The light on plates is a dated law that serves no purpose now but to write someone up for it.

Currently replacing a plate ($35) is far cheaper than a ticket so back it goes.  Yep, my trailer doesn't have a light on the plate either. Came that way from factory. Never had an issue with the cops over it. I need to move mine as it's getting beat up and could easily suffer the same fate as the OP's.  My first boat I used a flat bed trailer to haul it around. It was hard to see the plate so I hung it on a chain around the OB so the cops could see it. Got pulled over and they said it needs to be on the trailer and that it didn't matter if they couldn't see it."
979105,Sinker,2016-08-10 23:06:00,8692,"I bolted mine to the trailer frame between the lights. No issues. Been that way for many years, and even been pulled over with it there with no questions asked.  S."

979120,dave524,2016-08-11 00:29:00,4508,A lot of plates sit right under the tail light assembly and a clear lens on the bottom allows the tail light bulb to illuminate the plate as well.
979121,cheaptackle,2016-08-11 00:36:00,849,"Use gear clamps - allows the plate to swing if it contacts an obstacle just like zip ties would, but are much stronger.  Almost all my boat trailers (amongst others) have had that highly tecknickel redneck modification.  Michael"
