979160,scuro2,2016-08-11 11:18:00,904,"Incredibly 50 of the nation’s most senior Republican national security officials, many of them former top aides or cabinet members for President George W. Bush, have signed a letter saying they will not vote for Mr. Trump...""Donald Trump is not qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being. Most fundamentally, Mr. Trump lacks the character, values, and experience to be President. He weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world. He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws, and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary. In addition, Mr. Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding of America’s vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances, and the democratic values on which U.S. foreign policy must be based. At the same time, he persistently compliments our adversaries and threatens our allies and friends. Unlike previous Presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself. He continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics. Despite his lack of knowledge, Mr. Trump claims that he understands foreign affairs and “knows more about ISIS than the generals do.”  “Well, I respond by saying that I wasn’t using any of them and they would have loved to have been involved with the campaign,” Trump said. “And these were the people that have been there a long time,” he continued. “Washington establishment people that have been there for a long time. Look at the terrible job they’ve done. I hadn’t planned on using any of these people. They don’t feel relevant because of that and they form a group and they go out and try to get some publicity for themselves and they hope that somebody else other than Trump wins because that way they can get a job,” he added.  Yup, what 50 of his own parties top security members said means nothing because they have too much experience."

If you are a republican candidate your focus is on getting elected to congress. I would press republicans at this point to forget about trump and worry about what goes on in congress where the real decisions are made.   The point about how he is a business bully is one that I have never considered but makes total sense. You hire a subcontractor with smaller capital, refuse to pay them and then cut them a deal for a much smaller portion of the agreed upon amount. You then indicate that unless they accep that offer they will have to sue you which inheritably slows everything down and costs you a pile of lawyers fees.  and what keeps contractors working for you is that you threaten any whistleblowers and potential new contractors see having their project with the Trump Label as a huge selling point so you just keep making people jump through hoops and bully everyone.

He is also promising to use executive powers to impose a moratorium on new agency regulations. On trade, Mr. Trump underscored his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He also wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and label China a currency manipulator. And on energy policy, Mr. Trump said he would tear up the Paris Climate Agreement and halt the United States’ payments to United Nations global warming programs"".  Also promised recently was to double Hilary's 275 billion commitment to infrastructure spending and lower taxes. All in all these promises should put the US much further into debt."

You know, the convicted child  pornographer Jeffrey Epstein.  Here's how Trump sees his molester buddy (direct quote):  ""Ive known Jeff for 15 years"", Trump told New York Magazine in 2002. Calling him ""a terrific guy"", Trump continued, ""Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about itJeffrey enjoys his social life.""  Now, the Clintons have some connections to this guy too, I'm not gonna lie.

In reality, the Trump brand  is like K-Tel.  But I guess that is the land of Honey-Boo Boo and Duck Dynasty. I guess if you keep telling stupid people the same thing over and over again, they start to believe it as fact.    Do Americans realize that their entire political system is becoming the laughing stock of the rest of the world?  The cruel irony may be that Donald Trump is complaining that the political system is broken in the US, and yet that is the reason he has been able to get to where he is.  Here is a prediction for you:  Donald Trump loses in November and then immediately blames everyone else around him and launches a lawsuit against the GOP to recover the money he invested in the election."

It's obvious from the leaked emails that they were never going to let Bernie be their candidate. I think that's a huge mistake. He's not perfect, but I think he'd do better than Clinton against Trump. One possible ""silver lining""; maybe the DNC cut the same deal with Bernie (ie. he's next) in order to get his endorsement for Hillary (and avoid a big lawsuit I'm sure).  Pure conjecture on my part but it's at least plausible, and you can't say that about almost anything that Trumps says ?"

Gary Johnson seems like a reasonable candidate; he is technically a third party candidate rather than an independent.  He is polling much better than most third party candidates, which is probably a reflection of Trump and Hillary.  The Green party is also running a candidate.  There may be others.  If there was ever was a year to vote for an independant or third party candidate, this is it."

These traits include his obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law.  The dangers that flow from Mr. Trump’s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump’s vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated"".

She is a taker, the ultimate hypocrite.  Sure, Donald Trump says stupid stuff sometimes, but its off the cuff and non-politically correct.

Hilary is either a liar and self-serving politician or a superb person/leader - depends who u listen to. But all negative reports about her come from Republican based sources or are conversely matched by people who state the exact opposite about her. It's all so confusing and hard to filter for the common person. I'm not saying she's THE answer. However, she at least projects positivity and forward thinking.  Donald, however, constantly spews negativity and fear mongering.  Unfortunately, he gives us firsthand and filmed instances of racism, hate, inaccuracies, lies and a serious lack of understanding of trade, security and basic American constitutional law. He himself gives anyone who is willing to listen with a critical ear all the information one needs to see that he would be an embarrassing stupid, narcissistic, dishonest, arrogant and dangerous world leader.  A good chunk of the world already resents, mistrusts or hates America. Trump would only exacerbate that problem.  Do we need change in North America - dam right!

It is scripted, he is reading a statement he did not write. Someone has choreographed his words to make you think one thing when the opposite is true. Donald used Ryan's own words to snub him but didn't have the balls to follow through. They told him to dance like a puppet and he said how high? Ryan didn't come to the rally. All the important Wisconsin Republicans snubbed him and none showed up. Establishment Republicans are distancing themselves from him and he is dangling in the wind.  He has only his white people who hopelessly believe that he is a maverick prophet of truth who will lead them back to a pure America.

978575,Canuck2fan,2016-08-04 20:50:00,1444,"Trump does have a very good chance of winning. I personally can't understand the appeal of electing a person who HAS by deed and speech always been a bully. He always been too afraid to fight anyone straight up over anything who stands a chance of beating him.  He has defaulted on BILLIONS of dollars owed, never paid anyone what they are truly owed except perhaps his lawyers. He has personally NOT won at anything he has ever done, except get the nomination, and picking good lawyers.  He does however tell a great pack of lies. For anyone who thinks he is a successful rich self made man, they should ask themselves why no tax returns? It has been proven time and time again he INFLATES the value and his percentage of any pie he gets his tiny little hands into. Not to mention he has CONSISTENTLY peed away more than he has been able to hang onto over the years. Also he would probably be worth a lot more if he had of just passively invested the money his daddy gave him. There is a reason the only place he can borrow money from now is from the Russian oligarchs....  As for HIllary, what can be said that hasn't already been smeared across Internets.... She is allegedly a crook whitewater etc etc etc. Allegedly a heartless stone cold killer for not spending money the republican congress wouldn't give her for MORE security at the embassy in Benghazi...  Allegedly a treasonous idiot who is bad with email accounts. Yet after the FBI has just spent an estimated 7 MILLION investigating her, the very republican director of said agency didn't find any thing to lay charges against her over....  The only real thing Hillary has going for her is a vote for her is NOT a vote for a certifiable madman.  Hollywood and Bollywood together couldn't pick more dysfunctional candidates in a fantasy election from hell...  Popcorn INDEED!!!!!"

Work must have been INCREDIBLY boring for you!!!!! ...as for you avoiding this thread, Bwahahahahha  Meanwhile my initial statement on this thread has come true...latest polling has come out and Trump is cratering. I guess you can't attack the military and your own party and not take a hit.  Have you noticed that Trump has been relatively silent for a day after he attacked his own speaker of the house? That won't last.  As I predicted previously my bet is that he gets back to his ""normal"" and attacks new targets like the super rich and continues torching establishment Republicans. He will lose running a straight election and 70% of his base are angry white people who like a good bonfire. It's the only way he can keep his TV ratings up, he loves his ratings."
