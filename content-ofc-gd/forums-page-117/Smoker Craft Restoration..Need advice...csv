979646,tb4me,2016-08-16 01:58:00,3295,"So here is yet another progress update.. Yikes there is a Boat load of work here..Pun intended. lolI got lots of interior lighting in for night fishing eyes. Got a nice stereo system for days at the beach- dock for when beers are in order.I still haven't found an automotive electrician comfortable enough to touch my gauge issue. They all want proper wiring diagrams from the boat manufacturer. Mission impossible to say the least. Any way I have all the marine grade ply cut to fit and primed, and ready to be installed. Quick question. Can I use stainless screws to install the wood floor? I have a ton of them that I inherited from my grandfathers work shop years ago, so its not like its going to cost me anything extra to use them. I was going to pre drill and countersink so screw heads were completely buried."
979649,cheaptackle,2016-08-16 02:11:00,849,"I only used either stainless steel screws/hardware and/or big (huge) aluminum pop rivets on the restorations I've done.  Usually I prefer screws if I can use them - thinking ahead to removal in the future.  Lucky me I haven't had to yet take out a floor I've put in, but the main reason I finally chose to use the pop rivets would be it's easier to drill them out than it is to drill out a stainless screw if something goes wrong (glue in the head of a screw comes to mind).

979704,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-16 18:13:00,627,"I think you can use the stainless screws, but I recall somewhere reading or being told to that stainless and aluminum are not compatible and will react against each other chemically??? Can some one else confirm that or am I mistaken? Am I thinking about aluminum and pressure treated?  I know that a lot of the hardware (cleats, eye bolts for tie downs etc.) on most boats are stainless, but are they coated or protected from contact with the aluminum?"

979712,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-16 19:10:00,627,Must be my aged memory thing kicking in. Thank you.
979715,cheaptackle,2016-08-16 19:48:00,849,"I used aluminum rivets to hold down 3/4"" in all the floors I didn't use screws on.  Didn't worry about the silly cone as the glue for the carpet (imho) locks the screws in.  They can be bought from Brafasco, but I found Acklands in Barrie to be much cheaper.  Think it was 3/16 or 7/32 x 1-1/4 that I used.  Bear in mind different people do stuff differently - this is what worked for me.  As I said earlier, the main advantage of the rivets is they can be drilled out much easier than ss screws (think you need cobalt bits for ss) if something goes wrong with the screw. Good luck as you finish your project - it's a labour of love that's looking good and will be something you'll appreciate every time you use it - ain't nothing like a good job well done and used by oneself!

918332,tb4me,2015-06-03 04:31:00,3295,"So sort of an update...I have been up last weekend and finished most of the gutting process.I didnt get any pictures at all due to the horrible weather..Im going back  this weekend so ill be sure to get some more pics..Now's the time im considering what wood to use for the floor...Either im going to use 3/4 inch plywood or 3/4 marine grade ply.. Im looking around for the marine grade ply and the cheapest  can get it $150 a sheet. Does anyone know of a place that's reasonable in the Hamilton- Brantford area or in the Peterborough, the Kawartha's areas? I cant imagine paying that kind of money per sheet.. Now I see this new pressure treated plywood Sienna (looks like cedar) wont react to aluminum..Did this suddenly become an option that wasn't avaiable less then a year ago...Also I feel stupid for not looking when I was there last but are the tires on all boat trailers the same size? I have a chance to score new tires never uses for dirt cheap.. I want to bring the boat home so I can get more done right here in my own back yard.Im going to call my neighbor up there and ask him to get me tire sizes.. Was just wondering if most were the same size anyway.."
918336,DanD,2015-06-03 10:43:00,2223,"Tire sizes vary on trailers, almost as much as they do on vehicles. It all depends on what load the trailer was designed to carry and what the manufacturer decided to put on the trailer. Call your neighbor and confirm the size.  Dan."

What ever you choose put a couple of coats of sealer on all surfaces to help it last longer.  I'm very lucky with my boat as the entire floor is aluminium and will last for ever."
918457,tb4me,2015-06-04 01:04:00,3295,Ok here's something new..I called Monaghan lumber about marine grade plywood. They say that they have a 3/4 inch pine marine grade ply for $70 a sheet.I have never heard of this..Anyone have experience with marine grade pine plywood?
918460,HTHM,2015-06-04 01:25:00,4082,"Marine grade, by definition, has no voids, and is glued with a waterproof adhesive. So, I think pine could work as well. Those who know more, please correct me."

918656,dave524,2015-06-05 14:42:00,4508,"The big difference between marine grade plywood and exterior is not in the glue but in the integrity of the plys as far as voids and knots, seriously unless you are building an actual hull out of plywood you are wasting money springing for the extra bucks for a floor that you're going to cover with carpet anyway, seal it well though."
976936,tb4me,2016-07-18 16:03:00,3295,"So I was finally able to get back to work on the Smoker Craft...Yikes having friends that let you use their boat is both good and bad. Good is I haven't missed a beat..She is a smaller boat but I have spent the last 7 months in it on and off. We finally got back to the Smoker Craft though..Saturday was a big day..Finished the gutting, drilling of the rivets and started with sanding scraping and using the Goof Off on the heavy residue..I decided to go with Marine grade 3/4 inch ply..$500 for 4 sheets...Yikes. The sheets are cut and ready for sealing..Do you all think I should use primer or resin, or both?  As you can see I got lazy and didn't bother to remove the center console..It is completely rotten on the bottom where that soft floor was so im going to  try to rebuild it in place..Height of laziness I know...lol. I was able to get 90% of the carpet residue off with a orbital sander and a scraper. The rest had to be rubbed off. I went with Goof Off over acetone only because that's what I had on hand yesterday...lol Here are some pics..Ill try to do better at keeping this thread alive until i'm finished the boat..Oh any good places to get marine grade vinyl at a reasonable price?

914905,Kerry,2015-05-12 23:15:00,383,No one else piped in about this so I thought I would. I redid the floor in my old Starcraft about 9yrs ago.I used normal 1/2 inch plywood for the flooring and covered it with the duradek vinyl floor and it was great. However you made a point of stating you were going to seal all the wood including the cuts.When i did mine I used varathane on the two sides of the plywood and left the sides of the wood open so it could breathe.I figured in a marine environment it may be better to allow the wood a chance to dry rather than hold water if the bilge was to flood to any point.Maybe someone else has a better answer for that.Anyway the floor was solid and the vinyl was still in great shape when I sold it so I figured it was OK to do that.

I asked my Doctor and good friend about it one time and he knows I use it daily, bare handed, and he told me I had more important things to worry about. A one time deal doing your boat isn't going to hurt you if you at least have ""workers"" hands. I actually clean my hands with Acetone at the end of most days before going in the house to wash up.  Now MEK.. I won't touch unless I have to. One good splash in your eye and you'll be blind before you can find a tap to wash your eye out.  Most women use nail polish remover which is basically acetone regularly, so it could have some behavioral effects. Methyl Ethyl Ketone , we used it a lot as a solvent in the coil coating industry, not nice stuff."

915057,irishfield,2015-05-13 17:41:00,26272,Well considering the fight I had this morning with some thick tape residue... you may want to tray a small can of Acetone first before you go out and buy any quantity to try on the glue! You may have to remove it mechanically..
915145,tb4me,2015-05-14 04:13:00,3295,What about goof off? would it hurt the aluminum? Thanks for the heads up on the switch! Im going to order one tomorrow..
915146,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-14 04:32:00,10439,"Depending on what glue they used you may be able to get by with just the scraper I suggested. That is all I used, but I did replace with carpet and any slight imperfections were not noticeable. I would go with the scraper and if you need to get it smoother try the acetone or other glue removing liquids or a wire wheel on a drill to get it smooth enough for your liking."
915150,DanD,2015-05-14 10:59:00,2223,"Scraper and a heat gun. Warm the glue up just enough to soften it and then scrape it off. Yes you have to be careful not to overheat the area, you're working on; but it works. I've removed glued on advertisement stickers from cars & trucks this way and haven't burnt any paint YET. LOL I would work on small areas at a time; then move to a completely different area, allowing the first to cool. Too much heat in a large area could warp the metal. The wife's hair dryer is not hot enough or you'll burn it out. Get a proper heat gun for this and I'll bet you'll find 100's of uses for it even after this project.  Dan."

I also wanted to maybe paint the aluminum everywhere but the floor.. I want clean ans simple..Nothing worse then getting hooks snagged into carpet..My daughter was a master at that..
915323,JoshS,2015-05-15 14:40:00,729,I got glue off easiest with a wire cup brush on the hull then a glue remover solution (http://reviews.canadiantire.ca/9045/0491051P/ds-super-ds-super-remover-paint-glue-and-varnish-remover-reviews/reviews.htm - worked better than acetone for me).

914580,tb4me,2015-05-11 03:38:00,3295,"So here's what I decided to start this weekend..I wanted to dive into this in April but the boat was in lock down in a barn.. I just got her out this weekend. The floors were soft the last 2 years so i milked it as long as possible.. Well I have to admit im in it up to my eyes..Its an 18 foot with 2 live wells and a walk thru window. The floor is so bad the only thing keeping me from falling thru is the carpet. The passenger console came right off, the screws holding it to the floor came right out effortlessly... All i had to do was drill out the side rivets and lift it out..Now the drivers side is where I need the advice..Its just a bad and rotten as the other side. My question is, is there any way to take that section of floor out without disconnecting all the cables, steering and wiring? Can it just be lifted a little to drill out the old rivets and slide new plywood under, or is this a major project now including ripping all that apart too?Also what about that monstrosity of a fuel tank.. I dont use it as its part full of water. I have never used it in the 3 years I have owned this boat.i want to get it out of there as there seems to be a way for water to get in it. If I drill out all the rivets that hold those 5 inch aluminum strips will that mess up the structural integrity of the vessel? Ill be replacing everything with aluminum rivets and stainless hardware. I will also be using 3/4 inch fur plywood coated with resin all over including the cuts. Is there any more advice you all want to lend? How about a hand? lol all the beer you can drink (after) and some awesome fishing  on the Trent River!Edited to add that ill be using marine grade vinyl flooring when its all done.. "
914583,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-11 04:44:00,10439,"Your in it far enough that you should do it right. The steering cable is easy to disconnect from the helm. The wiring, not so much but is not a big deal if you take your time and make good notes of where all the wires are supposed to go.  Looks like no issue removing and reinstalling the straps over the gas tank. Why not replace it with a plastic or fiberglass unit?   FYI, this is the kind of project you do in the garage in the winter."
914584,tb4me,2015-05-11 04:52:00,3295,I wont get back up there until Friday for the long weekend.. So I have a ton time to plan..I was thinking of installing a new smaller tank and adding in floor storage. Right now we just use a red marine fuel tank. Man i really dont want to tear all that wiring apart. When i took the front apart the switch broke for the motor trim when i was gently pulling the wires off the back of the switch. Good luck replacing that switch now..I hear ya Dave my gut tells me to rip it all out but im no electrician.
914585,tb4me,2015-05-11 05:01:00,3295,Would also love any tips for getting all the glued on carpet off the aluminum of the boat?  Its under the gunnel (SP) and everything..

I also installed a new power center and VHF as well as new gauges, steering wheel, steering wheel and helm......  This is what it looked like before.    And my wiring on the back side of the new helm.    And the after view. The cover on the switch plate comes off and there are fuses underneath it. Saves having to crawl under the dash to find out which one is dead if there is a problem.    "
914600,aplumma,2015-05-11 11:57:00,6896,"The fuel cell can be removed but make sure you replace it with one that is rated for being covered. You can not put a mobile cell in, The fiberglass cells are prone to dissolving in ethanol so plastic or aluminum is preferred. Wires are not scary  if you take your time. I usually replace all of the wiring and make my own loom but if that is not something you are comfortable with then you can get assorted wire connector blocks and cut them and install the disconnect as you go. The 2 plates that you remove to remove the fuel cell need to be reinstalled for support. Electronic shops or auto store sell the disconnects or on line is also a good option. The most important thing is to take your time it took me over 2 months to get a Ranger back together.   Art"

914761,irishfield,2015-05-12 05:06:00,26272,"Rag soaked in Acetone. Soak the rag.. place it over a section and cover with a piece of rubber mat (or similar) for a few minutes (mat stops the acetone from evaporating.  Lift the mat and see if the glue will scrub off.. or at least soften up enough to just a PLASTIC scraper.  Acetone is $9 a quart can at CTC. Believe TSC sells gallon jugs for not much more... Remember any gouges or deep scratches you put in that .040 or .063"" thick side wall = a stress point for a crack."

Thats exactly what it is..Im reading in the manual its not an 18 footer at all...Its a 17.2 lol So it shrunk over time.....LOL  As other said, don't remove the console, just work around it by lifting it up enough and maybe plan your floor plan to be cut so you can easily put that piece under it. The floor doesn't have to be exactly like the original because once you cover it with carpet no one knows anyways.  To get rounded / contoured cuts right, get some larger pieces of flat cardboard and trim to fit nicely. Then use that to transfer to your plywood floor, it beats re-cutting plywood several times.
