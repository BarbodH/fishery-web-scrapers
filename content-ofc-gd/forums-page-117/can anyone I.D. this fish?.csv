979431,John Bacon,2016-08-14 03:49:00,3277,Looks like a fallfish.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallfish
979435,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-14 04:39:00,8243,"Too dark for a Fallfish, it's a Springer.  Hamilton looks like they are loosing another 38-22 BC, 4th quarter, man."
979448,Meegs,2016-08-14 11:20:00,249,Shefish/ fallfish... have caught lots of them in Algonquin
979451,Spiel,2016-08-14 12:10:00,9065,Fallfish gets my vote.
979457,206,2016-08-14 13:39:00,563,We always called them white fish as kids?
979461,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-14 16:14:00,535,We called them whitefish too but it's actually a fall fish. Did it make gulping noises?  They actually fight pretty hard for their size.
979462,Rizzo,2016-08-14 16:27:00,4754,forget what its called...how did it taste? Looks like great musky bait.

979511,Rod Caster,2016-08-15 02:12:00,5784,We catch them in the Ottawa river and use them as pike bait under a float. None better
