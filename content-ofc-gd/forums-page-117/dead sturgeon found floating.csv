979337,mike rousseau,2016-08-12 19:12:00,4661,I haven't seen this.... And I'm in the Rez 90% of the time I'm fishing... I've seen 2 dead this year... One was full in tact and the other cut in half (I assume the hydro turbines or the ships do this) which I see every year  Hope it's only a few isolated fish and they stop  On the plus side sturgeon numbers seam strong... See all kinds of em jumping all over the river
