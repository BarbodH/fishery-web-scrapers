979375,misfish,2016-08-13 17:52:00,29133,"All the rain we got here, and still the temps have not dropped. No relief. Well the grass and trees got some."
979376,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-13 17:53:00,8243,If it brings some rain here I'll take it. With all the deluges around Hamilton the last 2 days we haven't had a drop in Haldimand. There was a grass fire here last week in Hagersville and 2 of our Fire trucks caught fire. They are parked in the yard next to Toronto Motorsport Park ( 2 or more hours from Toronto) and 1 looks to be a write off. There are bean fields turning 2 months early.
979377,misfish,2016-08-13 17:57:00,29133,"Was talking to a buddy farmer this week. He didnt get insurance for his bean crop. Never has. This year he was going to take a big lose, but this rain just might get him by. I,ll bet he was dancing in his fields.LOL"

979381,pics,2016-08-13 19:39:00,1268,I'm watching a boat in the harbor heading towards lake Ontario here in Hamilton.. a half an hour ago I couldn't see across it due to heavy rain with lightning.. not the smartest move..you never know when a storm will pop up on days like this.. not much rain at work yesterday or today but 15 minutes from here at home we had an inch or more..
979384,ehg,2016-08-13 20:35:00,2666,"Turns out small tornado hit my old hood Ritson Rd. South in 'Shwa. Maybe small one in Brampton and one south of Beaverton. Crazy rain, thunder and wind downtown T.O here as well today."
979385,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-13 20:50:00,8243,"Pics, aren't you supposed to be there to protect my pension? They are calling for a load at the screen house. I just realized I have forgotten all the names of the coals. Look for my PM please."
979387,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-13 21:13:00,8243,"You don't think the farmers are going to take the hit for the bad crops do you. Some are getting a dismal second cut of hay, some none, therefor milk goes up, some corn and bean fields look like a bomb site, milk and oil goes up. My sis-in-law from Newmarket said the there is huge damage to Onions and Carrots from a hail storm  few weeks back. I didn't know almost 100% of these 2 crops are exclusively from Newmarket/Holland Landing for the entire country. I can't wait to see how much they want for veggies this winter. I planted what was supposed to be 3 Beef Steak Tomato plants, turned out they are Cherry tomatoes. Enough for 2 salads if I don't pick one every time I walk by."

Ok I will take HATE here BUT, how many decades have they grown at the marsh and been rewarded with multy $$$$$$$$$$$. This year they are crying foul do to the weather. Please. Take  the bad once in awhile."

It became off-topic political when someone mistook it for personal messenger kinda sad.  Anyways, more severe weather(maybe tornadoes) on way from Woodstock to Peterborough. Heads up! My buddy in 'Shwa had some  damage."

979402,Sharkbait22,2016-08-13 23:29:00,297,Looks like more rain on the way for me. 30mm so far on my gauge.  Planning to see Sloan at the Hootenanny On Hunter but it looks like rain and t-storms.

979460,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-14 16:00:00,8243,"The world revolves around talking about weather then a conversation may morph into something else. I did PM Pics. What is the ""goof tax"" for the foul?  Sorry."
