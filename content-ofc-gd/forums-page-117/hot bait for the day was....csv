LOL!  Don't know the total fish count for the day but that bait worked for a trout, pike, bass and perch!  Thanks for the good day and lesson!  I'll let him post the pic's if he want's to as I haven't downloaded them to my pc..."

Walleye tourney at Nanticoke postponed until tomorrow, I doubt much will change then either. Not a good year for catching fish here this year, actually the worse I can remember in 20 years. Water temp75 feet down is 75F!!!!"
979410,GBW,2016-08-14 00:03:00,8460,even with all the rain we found most of the day to be just under 80* of the trolling motor finder.  Even in over 50' of water.
