Pick up the lures... Pay the guy cash... And ship to me?  I'd pay for this favour or take you fishing then you wouldn't have to ship... Musky or walleye on the st Lawrence river  If you can help me out let me know please  Thanks
979318,lew,2016-08-12 16:33:00,12766,I'd do it for sure Mike but am leaving in the morning and will be gone 2 weeks. If you can wait till then I'll gladly get them for you and send them out.

979323,lew,2016-08-12 16:45:00,12766,"I'll be home on the 27th Mike, let me know if you still need them picked up."
979333,mike rousseau,2016-08-12 18:20:00,4661,Pete is taking care of me Lew  Thanks again for the offer brother  You going to nippising?
979334,lew,2016-08-12 19:02:00,12766," You going to nippising?  Yup, staying at Memquisit Mike."
979336,mike rousseau,2016-08-12 19:08:00,4661,Good luck brother  May the musky bite hard and the hits on target  Let me know if you wanna come back down here again Lew... I've learnt a bit since we fished last
979338,Sinker,2016-08-12 19:14:00,8692,"I can grab them if you want. I can pay for them, and you EMT me the payment. No paypal.  I live 5 mins outside of Peterborough.  Let me know. I can even mule them to Pete if that's better. He has helped me out in the past as well.  Whatever works. Pete has my cell number. I will be in Petes neck of the woods next friday too if that helps.  S."
979341,lew,2016-08-12 20:14:00,12766,Good luck brother  May the musky bite hard and the hits on target  Let me know if you wanna come back down here again Lew... I've learnt a bit since we fished last  Thanks Mike but after we get back from Nippissing  Diane and I are gonna head down to Nova Scotia for a few weeks.  My fishing days are pretty well over now and the only fishing I do anymore are muskies up north a few weeks a year.  Sure did enjoy the couple days we spent together a couple years back though.
979342,woodenboater,2016-08-12 20:22:00,2277,"As a psa, for something like this amongst Cdn brothers and sisters, I use Interac email bank transfer vs Paypal if sellers are cool with it. And they usually are once they realize it's through a financial institution. Basically free and no hoops to jump or money held, sellers get their payment asap."
979343,mike rousseau,2016-08-12 20:44:00,4661,Yeah but buddy selling the baits didn't even have online banking
979345,mike rousseau,2016-08-12 20:46:00,4661,"Just to share  The guy was selling 3 10"" hooker musky baits that retail for $59.99 USD for $75 Canadian total and they look mint..."
979347,Steve,2016-08-12 21:32:00,2075,good score!
979353,mike rousseau,2016-08-13 00:23:00,4661,And Pete managed to buy 2 more at $25 each when he grabbed mine so we both got a deal
