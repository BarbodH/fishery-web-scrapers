The transfer payments for 2017-18 will be set by Trudeau's government; not Harper's.  How can you use Harper's planned 2017-18 budget as an excuse for cuts by the Wynne government?  As for no one whispering a peep; I have heard far more complaints about Harper reducing the rate of increase from 6% to 3% than I did about the Liberals actually cutting health and social transfers by 34%.  At least they were still going up under Harper instead of going down like they did under the previous Liberal government.  Three percent annual increases is way better than what the provinces got while Chretien was in power.  McGuinty & Wynne have had very generous transfer payments compared to the cuts that Rae and Harris had to deal with.  Did you notice the original question to all of this? I questioned why the double standard. A Conservative Gov't decides to put forth cuts for reduced spending Con supporters are in favour. When the Liberal Gov't does the same thing, there's a raucous. After all, isn't reduced spending one of the goals of Conservative supporters? As it currently stands, nothing is being changed and we are on due course for Flaherty's proposal to happen in 2017.  Hypothetically speaking, if Trudeau goes about and reverses the proposed reduced health transfers starting 2017, will you be supporting that decision or be up in arms about increased spending under a Liberal gov't?"

They tend to campaign as the protector of social spending, telling us not to vote for the big bad Conservatives because they will destroy health care, etc.  So, when they actually start making cuts they expose their hypocrisy.  The Liberals aren't supposed to make cuts; so when they do, people cut upset.  There is also the issue of waste.

To me, a cut means a year over year decrease in spending.  By that definition, the Conservatives have not cut funding; nor were they planning to.  Health transfers increased by 6% a year.  They were scheduled to reduce that to a minimum of 3% a year.  But they would still be increasing, just increasing at a slower rate.  Even 3% annual increases are far, far more generous than the funding from the previous Liberal government.  The Liberals on the other hand have actual cut funding year over year.  I don't have the link handy; but recently there was a ~$90 million increase in year over year federal transfer payments to Ontario and a ~$50 million increase in total healthcare spending in Ontario.  That means that Wynne actually reduced the provinces share of funding by ~$40 million.   Harper didn't reduce nor plan to reduce year over year funding for healthcare.  So, to answer your question about the double standard.  It was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who actually made year over year cuts to funding.  The only thing Harper did was plan to reduce the rate of increases in funding.  I actually see the double standard as the opposite of the way you do.  The federal Liberals absolutely gutted health and social transfers in the 90s; cutting them from $18.9 billion in 1993 to $12.5 billion in 1997.  But Harper is the bad guy for only increasing transfer payments by 3% per year.  Wynne actually made year over year decreases in spending; but Harper is the bad guy for only giving them a 3% increase in funding.  You claim that Wynne has work with the hand that was dealt to her; but she got a pretty sweet had compared to the ones dealt to Rae and Harris.  She got 6% annual increases in transfers that may drop to only 3%; but Rae and Harris had to deal with a 34% decrease in transfers.  And the Liberals have delisted services that were previously covered when the PCs were in power.  Health and social transfers increased by a measly 1% between 1993 and 2003.  Not 1% each year; 1% for the entire decade! ($18.9 billion in 1993 to $19.1 billion in 2003).  But Harper is the bad guy for reducing the annual increase from 6% to 3%.  Yes, there is a double standard.  There is hardly a peep when Liberals slash spending while people complain about perceived cuts that never even really happened under the Conservatives.  As for your other question about whether I would support Trudeau reverting back to 6% annual increases, that would depend on his long term plans.  The only funding formula that is indefinitely sustainable is one where funding increases are tied to the growth in GDP.  Funding can increase by more than GDP growth on a temporary basis.  But doing so means that healthcare funding will continually become a larger and larger portion of the annual GDP and annual budgets.  Eventually there will be a point where someone will have to put their foot down and say that if cannot get any bigger (as a % of budget).  I can support a short term increase of 6% a year if there is an understanding that this is temporary measure to bring funding up to a higher level.  But to have my support for such a move, he would have to communicate the long term plan of how to fund this and what percent of the budget it will be capped at.  Canada has not seen any sustained growth in GSD at 6% annually since the 30s.  The general trend has been a reductiuon in percentage annual GDP.  So we are unlikely to see sustained 6% growth in the future.  Like it or not, 6% annual increases cannot continue forever.  A responsible government needs to make that clear.  Even 3% annual growth (or higher depending on GDP) in funds will not be indefinitely sustainable.  They are just sustainable for longer than 6% annual increases.     "

How about the fancy ""fake"" pool during the G20 summit that cost a nice cool $1mil and didn't the entire thing cost over $1bil when compared to other host nations that spent a fraction of that? Or how about Tony Clement getting a $50mil G8 funding approval to splash around his riding?  On a whole, and I agree with you John, Canada's health care has seen a nice boost year after year. The general salaries of our physicians also indicate that. The one thing that I would be cautious is the annual increases that are tied to GDP. Think about that one...if a province has a lower GDP, they will not receive the 6%. A lower GDP usually can be associated with an aging population...people who are retired.

I agree that the Harper government has its share of issues.  But on the topic of healthcare transfers, I think they have been pretty good.  As for tieing healthcare transfers to GDP.  I was thinking of the federal growth in GDP.  From the mid thirties to present, there has been a general downward trend in annual GDP growth.  I think it average about 2.5% annual growth under Harper.  Most of the projects for the next couple of years that I have seen have been less than 2%.  It would be nice to just keep giving the provinces a 6% more each year; but the money has to come from somewhere.  If the GDP growth is less than the annual increases, the we will eventually run out of money.  It is not a question of if; it is a question of when.

If teaching is such a lucrative and easy job, quit what you are doing, go back to school and become a teacher. Same for a doctor. That would be and undergrad degree(3-4 years). Pre-med (4-6 years), then internship (2-3 years). Minimum 8 years and up to 13 years.  No this isn't a watered down community college trade course that you can do in 2 years and be out earning $40 to $80+ an hour repairing plumbing.  Don't get me started on lawyers and the legal system ($400 an hour minimum and the sky is the limit). 5 minute phone calls costs you at least $100 and a photocopy can be as much as $200.  So Terry before you spout off on the people that hold jobs that are essential to our society (yes there many other not mentioned here) take a good look at what they really do and what it costs to get there.  Just to put it in perspective, my 28 year old neighbour across the street is a high school drop out.  Partied and spent every cent  he got from his parents, part time work, EI, etc. 4 years ago he got a job in the paper mill as a labourer. He got his High school equivalency at a local college and officially he holds a HS diploma. He has  matured and worked his way up, from one job to another. He is now 4th hand on the paper machines and earns just over $90,000 a year without overtime. He has made an extra $20,000 to $30,000 per year overtime so he can buy his expensive toys. Yup he makes more than most teachers with out any responsibility after he punches out. I DON""T HEAR ANYONE COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS EARNINGS!  Good for him, he made it.  I have grown weary of the complaints about teachers,doctors and other professionals.  Don't blame them for working hard academically and getting ahead.  Nobody forced you to do the work you do, you picked it. It  didn't pick you. Don't like it, become a teacher, doctor, lawyer or what ever but don't begrudge them.  7-12 million a year to chase a hockey puck or 35 million to hit a baseball and nobody complains.

Ya that's good money but they have to invest a ton and study under great pressure for 8 years and they work insanely hard with huge responsibities. Shouldn't they be rewarded and for taking this hard and costly career path. Shouldn't we want to encourage smart and skilled people to enter this profession so we have the best and brightest as our first line of defence in health care and illness diagnosis. We should be attacking politicians over their waste and poor spending and accountability - not our front line physicians.  And I love how a thread like this always ends up bashing teachers. Lol. I'm an experienced teacher and I can tell you I work 8-4:30 everyday plus, not 6.5 hrs Terry. I get fired up when people attack other professions or careers - especially skilled tradesmen or professionals who invested in their future and then are supposed to feel bad for their good salaries. I don't criticize unless I've walked in their shoes. I have friends that make nearly 100,000 at Toyota in an unskilled job too - sounds ridiculous - but would I want to do that everyday - no way!!! They also deserve it. Good for them."
978898,Terry,2016-08-08 16:08:00,14456,"again I did not say teachers dont deserve every cent they make, and 100% there are lots of teachers that show up at school at 7am and they stay well pass 4:30  but these days in this part of the province more show up when they have to and leave as soon as they are allowed to leave which is 15 min before school and 15 min after and that is with in the letter of their contact... so I am not putting them down  its  fact  as is the wages"
978899,FrankTheRabbit,2016-08-08 16:35:00,479,"Terry, if you are now acknowledging that some teachers do more than the 9-3:30 shift, why wouldn't you have stated that in the beginning? The comparison you initially made between doctors and teachers, sounded like ALL teachers only do 9-3:30. I don't think it was a valid comparison to begin with. Both professions are important and they rightly deserve what their compensation currently stands.  I'm still not sure why you think that ""docs should make more compared to teachers"" because they already do. Tell me how many teachers have you seen or know own a $1mil home or have a cottage in the Muskokas or send their kids to private school?  Family doctors do not take home as much as u think after expenses. Less that 150 for sure but closer to 100,000.

We should be attacking politicians over their waste and poor spending and accountability - not our front line physicians. I've included a few links previously that physicians certainly earn more than what some of us think. They average over $200k easily and I don't think that they need any sideline cheering from us.  If we really want to root for the underdogs (and there are plenty!) who are overworked and underpaid...have no further look than our farmers. But that is another conversation altogether."
978902,Terry,2016-08-08 16:53:00,14456,"i stated it because they do not have to work more then what is stated in the contract and the ones that work  the hours that are set out in the contract are not bad teachers, they are highly organized , have taught the same grade for many years, so they have little trouble getting everything marked checked and prepared during work hours... the only real hold up is the line waiting to use the photocopier .....and I hate how long they went without a raise and the poor/crappy raise they are about to get..."
978910,landry,2016-08-08 18:46:00,1005,"I agree Terry that some teachers take advantage. It drives me crazy. My friend is a doctor and my doctor and he makes low100,000 but he takes great pride in his work and does not whip through his appointments. He is always behind schedule cause he gives all his patients the time that is needed. That is where I got my info and first hand define from. He is awesome. I'm sure it varies with each Doctor. I wish there was less jealousy and anger directed at other contributing Canadians and more anger and accountability for our politicians. Now there is an area where did ills salaries, pensions and spending is out of control. I wish there were more fishing thread in this site lately:)"
978914,Big Cliff,2016-08-08 19:15:00,6899,"This is nonsense! It started out as showing what a Dr. actually got paid for a visit compared to an appliance repair person and turned into a fight about what teachers get paid!  Personally I just had a conversation with a man; his wife is a school principal. He told me that if teachers ever don't get the summer off it would be because of him! I do feel that there are teachers that do the bare minimum and get paid way too much for doing it but I also remember a teacher that played a major role in my life and helped me become the president of a corp. when most of the other teachers in my life would have been happier if I just didn't show up in their classes.  Mr. Hugh Stephenson, grade 7 teacher, principal in our school, a man above men and he had confidence in me when even I didn't!  But this isn't about Mr. Stephenson, it's about a cardiologist that has kept my wife alive for longer than my washing machine has survived, a man who has invested countless hours and money to perfect the skills to do it and he got paid about 30% of what the appliance repair man gets.

978927,lew,2016-08-08 21:11:00,12766,"I seldom get involved in these types of discussions as they generally go downhill faster than a political thread but here's my thoughts.  2 years ago my wife was diagnosed with lung cancer and went thru dozens of tests in 3 different hospitals. When all tests were completed the surgeon studied them and said ""yup, you've got cancer for sure, but don't worry, I should be able to fix you up and make you well again""  He got her into surgery and made a few incisions then inserted a camera into one and his tools in the others and did what surgeons do so well. He removed the cancer and sewed her up and put her into ICU and then 3 days later he said ""go home Diane, your all fixed up""  8 years prior to that, my wife was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and after all the tests were completed another surgeon studied all the test results and said ""yup, you've got a brain aneurysm for sure, but don't worry, I should be able to fix you up and make you well again.  He opened the side of her skull, went inside and actually lifted her brain up, then repaired the aneurysm, put her brain back in place, repaired her skull and told her to spend the night in the hospital and the next morning told her she was ""all fixed up and go  home""  Just my thoughts on doctors, specially surgeons, but as far as I'm concerned they can't be over payed and  are NEVER payed enough for their unbelievable skills.  And when I hear about athletes being payed tens of millions of dollars for throwing a ball around it really makes me wonder about the screwed up society we live in."

How can you use Harper's planned 2017-18 budget as an excuse for cuts by the Wynne government?  As for no one whispering a peep; I have heard far more complaints about Harper reducing the rate of increase from 6% to 3% than I did about the Liberals actually cutting health and social transfers by 34%.  At least they were still going up under Harper instead of going down like they did under the previous Liberal government.  Three percent annual increases is way better than what the provinces got while Chretien was in power.  McGuinty & Wynne have had very generous transfer payments compared to the cuts that Rae and Harris had to deal with."

If a doctor has to rent an office, employ staff, and purchase medical equipment, is it overbilling if he earns enough revenue to cover these costs?   More than 90% of physicians are independent contractors and are incorporated, allowing them certain taxable benefits: lower taxes, income splitting, and tax deferral payments. The overhead, depending on the specialist, can range from 10%-38%, but the average seems to be around 26%, which is self-reported.   Average case scenario: Physician bills $360,000-$93,600 (26% overhead) nets $266,400 with a take home income of $169,297 after taxes, with the ability to defer taxes around $86,000, which stays in the corporation.  I think back in 2013, 252 physicians billed around the $1 mil mark, equating to $252 mil. If general taxpayers are to be held to the same standards of living within your means, why should doctors be exempted?

Some examples of pay... $160-180/hr in rural ER.  $1200/day on-call or working in a northern office.  Many Physicians nowadays in general practice are part of Healthcare teams with other Docs and services sharing the rent and resources. They still earn incredible money with that, and for a 9-5 M-W-F office job in reality.  And then there's the extras earned through other days/hours spent working in hospitals or within other practices nearby.

In my time beyond 2000 noting what's been happening in the north, I have seen their annual incomes rise from $180,000-220,000 to $380,000-500,000.. and in some regions again, it can reach closer to a mil.  In that same amount of time, I think nurses have taken about an 9 - 11% raise, have been cutback and cutback, and working in what is fast becoming one of if not the most under-man-powered, most governed and heavy work-loaded degree educated professions. And the NP's... talk about getting the shaft even more.  The Physician's Union sure is a strong one it seems."

The ones that I know, arrives to the school by 7:30, leaves around 5pm, and still works a few more hours for marking papers/assignments/quizzes...PTA meetings, etc.     More than 90% of physicians are independent contractors and are incorporated, allowing them certain taxable benefits: lower taxes, income splitting, and tax deferral payments. The overhead, depending on the specialist, can range from 10%-38%, but the average seems to be around 26%, which is self-reported.   Average case scenario: Physician bills $360,000-$93,600 (26% overhead) nets $266,400 with a take home income of $169,297 after taxes, with the ability to defer taxes around $86,000, which stays in the corporation.  I think back in 2013, 252 physicians billed around the $1 mil mark, equating to $252 mil. If general taxpayers are to be held to the same standards of living within your means, why should doctors be exempted?  But this has gotten a bit off topic...my main point is why the double standard when there are cutbacks? Next time someone you know and love is really sick, call a teacher and see how that works out."
