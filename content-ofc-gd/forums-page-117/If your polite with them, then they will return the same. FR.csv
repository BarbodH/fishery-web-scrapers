It came while I was away on my five day five lakes.  From me  Sorry for the delay as I was away. I recieved my new bladder friday. I thank you Angel for all your help and patients understanding what I was trying to say was my issue. Also to Classic , for helpping me out with this issue. Great service and it has been shared on  fishing forums I am on. Keep up the great customer service. Brian, I will send you 2 packs of the oar lock bushings for you.  We have processed your Warranty claim and it will ship out within 24 hours. You will receive a UPS tracking number via email.  You will see that it was covered under warranty, even though it was my neglect. (Not making sure they were properly screwed tight after many outings) These pieces are like $2.50 US a pack. Shipping Im sure would be triple that.  Be polite, and they will be nice to you."
