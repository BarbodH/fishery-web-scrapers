978992,misfish,2016-08-09 23:44:00,29133,Doing my google search again for another lake to try. Looks like a nice trip to make with the toon.    Feel free to pm if you must.  Looking for a public access spot to launch my toon and park the truck without bothering the locals..  Thanks  B  
978996,cheaptackle,2016-08-10 00:11:00,849,No help here Brian but because I never heard of it I had to google it.  Interesting looking lake with lots of (or so it appears) access to adjacent ones too.  Looks like it could be a winner - and I hope it is!  Michael

That area could be a weeks vaction next year. I want to learn it abit, travel some of the roads. Im sure If I talk to a few locals and tell them Im just looking to catch not keep, they will lend a few trails.   I've never heard of it either, but there's lots of decent little toon friendly lakes in Haliburton if you wanted to head in that direction.  I havent study the area that much Chris. You and ckew seem to have it peged pretty good. I will be looking out that way for future fishes. If I find something that looks interesting,I,ll be sure to chew your ear off bud.  Whats come to me about going all over the place is, I wish I had started doing this much sooner. I am starting to understand what you guy see and feel on these outings. Plus I need to get my mind open to other spiecies. Not just bass and pickeral and pike. Them trout and white fish lakes I know would be a blast.  Are you talking about the one near Sparrow?   No Roger, But now you have me looking at it.LOL"
