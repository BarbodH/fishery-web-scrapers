Weather was hot for day 1 then it cooled off for 2 days slightly. After that temps were cranked as I'm sure many of you already know. Water temps started at 74-80 degrees and rose to 80-89 degrees. Water levels were also very low so my shallow frog bite I was hoping for was gone. I did manage to get a few fish pitching the TRJ in the pads and however 95% of everything else came on a 3/4oz and a 1oz flipping jig. Couple jerk bait fish as well through the week but only one of decent size.  We had engine issues with my rope start, got things fixed up the next day but lose a evening and fished with the electric for a morning found a pair of smallies no braggers but still didn't want to waste a hour or two on the lake. Enjoy the pictures, was a tough bite for my dad this week he did manage some small ones and 2 decent fish. Weather sucked on the way home all of our tents and camping gear came back soaked as we packed up in the rain. Lot's to do tomorrow drying everything out and the usually work after a camping trip.  Day 1 I was invited out to fish a small tournament with a couple of guys. First was 16lbs last was 10lbs I had 14.88 for 5 if I remember correctly. 4 good ones I caught and a dink we couldn't get rid of before 2pm.   Later in the evening the bite slowed found a couple smaller largies.   Next day was tough started searching the ""spots"" found some nice fish and one of the bigger largies of the week.   Got to love that pitch into the pads then the mean fish that jets out to the boat. Was a fun fight managed to get it on the GoPro   Great way to wake up in the morning. Caught smaller fish every morning finally a nice smallie took the jerk bait.    Solid fish gonna be huge one day very healthy. Morning Jig bite.   Smallmouth on the jig. Unreal fight managed to swing this one in as it jumped beside the boat.   As always we found a bowfin. Fun fight but still a drag when bass fishing.   Lot's of smaller fish shallow found this 3 later on. Decided to abandon the pattern and switch to just the deep weed and banks.   My trip down the bank out front of camp before making a coffee and getting the motor fixed. No braggers but glad to be out.   Finally got onto some deep main lake fish. Produced just a few the first day but next day we had a blast for 2 hours putting about 10 in the boat on the jig. Dad found some on his 10"" worm as well.   One for dad   The next day when we hit the spot took a few pics 1 big one but solid fun.   Another   Loving the jig bite   The reward for sticking around   Dad enjoyed one big fish also   Last 2 days were the hottest and the toughest. Wish I got to fish today when the temp dropped and the rain came but good test to my patience and man did i drink water.   Another chunk happy to get a bite   Little better fish off the weed edge   Last day was tough but caught some smaller fish in the morning and before packing up for the day we headed out and found just 2 fish but one was the big fish for the week. Awesome end to a great vacation.   Perfect end to my day. Such a strong fish not a nickel but o so close.   Thanks for reading everybody. Looking forward to the next trip when temps are cooler and i take my mom and brother out for a week.  I'll miss this for a few weeks no better sight to see in my mind.    And our GoPro edit from the trip. A couple picture fish in this clip lot's of smaller bass but lot's of fun to edit and put together. https://youtu.be/qXpy2QMia6k  Tightlines  MTBF"
979445,buick14,2016-08-14 10:53:00,741,Man look at all of those fishies.  Great report! That dogfish probably fought like crazy too! Fish definitely aren't in their normal milk run spots for me this year that's for sure ...

979534,manitoubass2,2016-08-15 14:26:00,11391,Wicked Mike!!!  Lotsa beauties in there! Looks like a blast!  Can Dad fit 1 more yard of line on that spool ???
979537,Roy,2016-08-15 14:43:00,13728,"Great report, Mike. Fantastic pictures too. Thanks for posting this."
979606,MCTFisher9120,2016-08-15 23:16:00,3761,Thanks for the comment's guys trip was tough but still relaxing and a blast. Hardest part was lasting those 4-8 hours in the boat but a bite a hour was all it took to keep me in the heat. Wicked Mike!!!Lotsa beauties in there! Looks like a blast!Can Dad fit 1 more yard of line on that spool   We keep our reels full yes. I'm not one to cheap out on line so full spools 1/8th of a inch from the level part of the spool. The 45degree lip is to reduce friction and create those super long casts. Dad reels slow so fuller spool means more line pickup not much but hey what ever works. Glad he caught a nice fish.  Here is my GoPro edit from the week. No picture fish but 2 or 3 in this but constant Jig action.  https://youtu.be/qXpy2QMia6k
