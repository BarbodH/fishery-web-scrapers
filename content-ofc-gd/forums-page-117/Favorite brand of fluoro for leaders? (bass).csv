978721,Tjames09,2016-08-06 01:41:00,664,Just wondering what the board consensus is on fluoro brand for leaders and what lb test most prefer. It would be matched with 20lb braided lines for bass fishing.
978727,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-06 02:26:00,8243,I tie on 4 feet of 10 pound Seagar. As soon as I feel a kink I change it.
978763,grimsbylander,2016-08-06 13:43:00,3016,"I also use Seagar 90% of the time. 6 foot leads on my rods with micro guides and 15 foot leads on the rest. As for weight...6-8 on Erie(spinning), 10-20 anything clearer and senko(spinning), baitcasting = sky's the limit lol"
978764,FloatnFly,2016-08-06 13:55:00,1640,scientific anglers or RIO
978766,adam lancia,2016-08-06 14:04:00,234,"I use Seaguar Red Label, P-Line FC, and Berkley 100% FC (both XL and regular). I like them all to be honest."
978783,ecmilley,2016-08-06 19:40:00,2163,"use Berkley, used seagar and right now trying some suffix leader really like the suffix o far great knot strength not as stiff as the others"
978794,fishindevil,2016-08-07 00:18:00,6254,I have been using Berkley as it's reasonable price and works pretty good 10lb or 12lb just keep checking it for nicks and kinks re tie often
978797,mike rousseau,2016-08-07 01:53:00,4661,Seagar is the best I've used  I use 10lb... 20lb... 40lb
978802,dave524,2016-08-07 12:04:00,4508,"6 to 10 Trilene XT, but then I'm thrifty."
978805,Tjames09,2016-08-07 13:14:00,664,Thanks guys! I had 8lb Pline and felt it was a little fragile.
978810,mike rousseau,2016-08-07 14:24:00,4661,Pline is good in the higher lb test  I use 100-150lb pline for musky and love it
978839,manjo39,2016-08-07 21:12:00,354,Largemouth in weeds or wood you don't need a leader.  No need to introduce another point of failure.  On super clear conditions under docks with a slow sinking bait 20lb flouro lead.  BPS Extreme or Sunline.  Smallmouth with jerkbaits 10 or 12 lb flouro lead to keep the trebles from snagging onto the braid.  Dropshoting 8 or 6 or 4 lbs flouro.
978892,AKRISONER,2016-08-08 14:14:00,5558,"agreed on the no leader need when fishing heavy heavy cover...  otherwise though if there are substantial pike on the lake im running 20lb.  Im sorry but P-line is trash! throw it out. just my experience.  Dont even get me started on what im using fly fishing though..the best fluro you can buy...and also the most expensive...fluroflex +  the stuff is by far the most supple, low memory line I have ever used"

I was only using the leader with finesse style stuff and walleyes and muskies seem to like anything and have been eating our finesse baits as well. Had a few line breaks from toothy critters."

I was only using the leader with finesse style stuff and walleyes and muskies seem to like anything and have been eating our finesse baits as well. Had a few line breaks from toothy critters.  I have PLINE FC 8lb on two of my tube rods, not as leaders. I dont spool the whole thing with it it. Just half. I use old braid for backing. I have been using it for over 6 years. Never had an issue. I also use 10-12 for jerk baits. Again, never an issue. Also like it for leaders on my ice fishing rods."

(lost a true giant PB gator trying to get it up the hole this winter  ) just remember to retie if a pike nicks your line."
979265,Dutch,2016-08-12 03:22:00,831,I use Seaguar 14 pound test. I used vanish before that and hared it.
