979007,Pikeslayer,2016-08-10 01:54:00,1443,Edited in the interest of recognizing Mike's accomplishment  & keeping the thread 'alive' despite someone's attempt to poop on it
979023,bigcreekdad,2016-08-10 11:51:00,546,"Just some payback for some unwanted words from a post of a muskie I caught from years ago.  OK, I'm over it.  Very nice fish."
979025,mike rousseau,2016-08-10 12:01:00,4661,Oh your the guy that laid that musky on your carpet so you could get a picture and when I PMed you instead of trying to ruin your post you got your panties in a bunch....  That's kinda weird your still dwelling on some constructive advice from so long ago  You aren't the guy that's been looking in my windows at night when I shower are you?  Or are you the guy calling and breathing heavy on my phone?  Have a good day
979027,bigcreekdad,2016-08-10 12:08:00,546,"My post was genuine, as you thought yours was years ago. You obviously reacted to mine the same way I did yours.  Now you've started to act a bit childish."
979028,lew,2016-08-10 12:23:00,12766,"Mike and I have spent a couple days in a boat together and boated a few muskies, he definitely knows how to handle them."
979047,bigcreekdad,2016-08-10 15:45:00,546,Lew...I don't doubt it.
979110,bigcreekdad,2016-08-10 23:36:00,546,"Getting old and cranky. My original post was out of line. My apology to Mike.  And, it was a very nice fish."
979113,Whitespinnerbait,2016-08-10 23:51:00,2038,Beauty of a fish to say the least !!
979116,Pikeslayer,2016-08-11 00:07:00,1443,Well done  You are a better man for that.

979161,mike rousseau,2016-08-11 11:21:00,4661,Thanks guys
979162,scuro2,2016-08-11 11:28:00,904,You must fish only trophy walleye then... I was trolling for walleye when she hit... It wasn't long before I realized it wasn't a walleye...
979185,manitoubass2,2016-08-11 14:56:00,11391,Id think thats pretty fair to say lol.  Mike posts pics of monster walleyes year after year?
979188,mike rousseau,2016-08-11 15:32:00,4661,"I try  Got a 30.5"" walleye last week"
979300,ehg,2016-08-12 13:55:00,2666,"You are in best spot for smallmouth(30 lb. 6 fish tourney bags), chance at 15 lb walleye, chance at world record musky. Lucky guy! That huge musky has that reticulated pattern. Great! You have it made."
979301,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-12 13:56:00,535,Show off lol. I still haven't even caught a single walleye this year.
979358,Joey,2016-08-13 02:19:00,9122,"WOW, congrats!!!"

978330,floater,2016-08-02 12:24:00,220,Fantastic catch! You are never going to forget that one!
978332,OhioFisherman,2016-08-02 12:30:00,6623,"10lb power pro with 20lb fluorocarbon leader LOL, even steel leaders didn't help me!"
978338,msp,2016-08-02 12:58:00,1336,Whoa ! Giant fish. Congrats
978427,AKRISONER,2016-08-03 14:20:00,5558,ridiculous...this is always how things seem to go though. perseverance always pays off.

978460,Carp,2016-08-03 19:32:00,1488,  Sweet fish ! Congrats !!!  Sigh.........only in my dreams..............
978478,reelingMachine,2016-08-03 21:30:00,29,An incredible fish. Congrats!  Two times I went out for walleye this year ended up with no walleye at all. The first time a couple of bass helped to relieve the pain. OMG! I suck...
978487,misfish,2016-08-03 23:26:00,29133,Thats a real beaut Mike. Well done.
978499,mike rousseau,2016-08-04 01:10:00,4661,I'm hoping she sticks around so I can get her again in the fall when she's fattened up...  Maybe catch her on purpose too lmao!
978507,Steve,2016-08-04 02:16:00,2075,"did you have your rod in your hand when she hit, or was it in the holder?  I could just imagine what it must have felt like...you mentioned it was a taildancer, how deep of water were you fishing?  As someone who loves to troll, I can't even imagine what that must have been like!  (finally, 20lbs test for walleye eh! bet your glad you had that)"
978550,mike rousseau,2016-08-04 16:35:00,4661, To be honest it took a little while to realize it wasn't a big walleye... They don't fight much at first cause they hardly realize what's happening  15 feet of water  I always run a 20lb leader... I was lucky tho cause it was hooked in the corner of the mouth
978559,AKRISONER,2016-08-04 17:14:00,5558,"Rod in hand structure fishing some stones  To be honest it took a little while to realize it wasn't a big walleye... They don't fight much at first cause they hardly realize what's happening  15 feet of water  I always run a 20lb leader... I was lucky tho cause it was hooked in the corner of the mouth  isnt that the truth  my PB had me confused at first when i set the hook because it was swimming towards the boat, i wasnt even sure if i had a musky or another stupid bass that had decided to hit a twin 10...but then the fish saw the boat and you know the rest."
978942,bigcreekdad,2016-08-09 00:38:00,546,Nice fish. Hope you didn't take too much slime off with the tail grab.
978946,mike rousseau,2016-08-09 01:11:00,4661,My gloves have rubber on em so they don't strip much slime
978997,bigcreekdad,2016-08-10 00:17:00,546,Yeah...right!
979001,manitoubass2,2016-08-10 00:43:00,11391,Nice...  Need a pail for your tears?
979002,mike rousseau,2016-08-10 00:52:00,4661,Maybe I should have let her swim away with a crankbait still in her face?  I know how to handle fish
978200,mike rousseau,2016-08-01 00:08:00,4661,"Hey gang  So I've had a tough start to my musky year... So I decided the other day to take a break and fish walleye for a few weeks to get ready for a couple tournaments... And wouldn't you know it second day walleye fishing I get the biggest musky of my life... Go figure...  I was trolling for walleye when she hit... It wasn't long before I realized it wasn't a walleye... Then when I got my first look at her I almost puked... After a few good runs she behaved herself and settled down boat side.... I had to hand bomb her so I put some gloves on (anyone who thinks I'm a sissy hasn't hand bombed a 50"" fish)... First attempt she did a big shake and bumped the boat shifting the small walleye crank to the inside of her mouth... I almost puked again... I thought it was over... We got her close again and I grabbed the line to position her and she did another head shake breaking the walleye crank at the lip breaking her connection between me and her... I was left holding the line attached to nothing but the lip of a taildancer... A second seamed like an hour while I looked at the fish of a lifetime swim away... NOT ON MY WATCH... I dive nearly falling out of the boat and managed to grab her by the tail and miraculously she didn't run... I quickly got another hand under the gill plate and slid her over the side of the boat...  If I had this happen another hundred times I'd bet against the tail grab every time but I got lucky today  And here she is... 56 glorious inches of accidental, hand landed, lure breaking Musky  "
978202,manitoubass2,2016-08-01 00:16:00,11391,OMG!

978205,DaveRoach,2016-08-01 00:22:00,202,wow!!!!!!!!
978208,manitoubass2,2016-08-01 00:34:00,11391,"How was the girth mike?  The way your holding it looks deceiving.  The back of the head(at least to me) says that is not only one long ski, its thick as ..... as well"
978209,mike rousseau,2016-08-01 00:39:00,4661,Didn't take the time to get a girth  With the long battle on walleye gear I wanted to get her back fast  She was thick and healthy
978211,manitoubass2,2016-08-01 00:42:00,11391,Awesome!!! Congrats mike! Thats one heck of a rebound!!!
978213,Rizzo,2016-08-01 01:23:00,4754,wow what a giant...I need to go walleye fishing apparently. Love the landing job too
978216,GBW,2016-08-01 01:28:00,8460,"she got to be a 56"" by learning how to bust a bait I guess...  NICE FISH!!!  and congrats on the PB too!!! who cares about the gloves too...  I know bass guys who want to avoid bass thumb and use a golf glove all day..."
978217,manitoubass2,2016-08-01 01:31:00,11391,Ummmm. On my lil 30 something I was hesitant lol.
978220,MJL,2016-08-01 01:42:00,2427,What a beautiful fish! The leopard spotting on that fish is amazing.
978221,GBW,2016-08-01 01:45:00,8460,Ummmm. On my lil 30 something I was hesitant lol. between the hooks stuck in my hand with all size fish and teeth i'm fine with a glove.  in fact I think I'll be packing one for my next trip!
978223,manitoubass2,2016-08-01 01:55:00,11391," Doesnt bother me but yeah, a big fish makes you recalculate lol.  No problems with those using gloves at all  Sorry mike...  May the thread go on!"
978226,GBW,2016-08-01 01:59:00,8460,"No problems with those using gloves at all  Sorry mike...  May the thread go on! I was thinking the same, Sorry Mike..."
978237,lew,2016-08-01 08:13:00,12766,"AttaBoy Mike, outstanding fish and a great tale to go with it, congrats on the PB.  Don't worry about what anyone thinks about you putting on that glove, I once got my thumb sliced open for 8 stitches from a dopey little 30""er."
978238,wormdunker,2016-08-01 09:06:00,1711,Awesome fish!  Your story of landing it had me in suspense.  Nice colors!
978239,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-01 10:36:00,535,Way to go Mike!!! Plus a great story to go with it! I'd call that a fish of a lifetime but something tells me you're going to beat even that...
978240,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-01 10:47:00,535,"The gloves are probably what gave you enough grip to even grab it by the tail too. Thankfully you got your fish, it just adds to the experience. There's no worse feeling fishing than losing a PB  boat side."
978241,farsider,2016-08-01 11:26:00,456,"Beauty fish!  Nicely done sir!  Cheers, Mark"
978246,OhioFisherman,2016-08-01 14:16:00,6623,Dang! nice fish! Taildancers the new hot muskie lure! LOL 8# test line or 10?
978250,Pikeslayer,2016-08-01 14:56:00,1443,Awesome fish Mike. Congrats!!!  Seems this fish may be an OFC BEST????
978251,Rich Clemens,2016-08-01 15:07:00,3131,I really need to STOP Musky fishing and start Walleye fishing.  Geez !!!       Congrats.  That one may be a little tough to beat.
