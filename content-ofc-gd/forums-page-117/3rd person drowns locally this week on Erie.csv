A 45 year old woman drowned just down the road here Thursday. I never heard a word about that until I just read it. I don't recall the details of the third. Just tragic. The families of those dead must be devastated and always will. My heart goes out to them.  I can't seem to paste the link from The Simcoe Reformer.  We were just talking today on the Long Point Fishing Forum about the kids playing in the huge breakers this afternoon at Port Stanley beach after a Dad dropped his kids off, he told them not to go in the water after he saw the huge waves. It has been a bad year here for drownings. Just last week a young mans boat washed up on shore on the US side. He launched alone out of Port Maitland. His body was found a few days latter off of Maitland. He was 35 and a very experienced fisherman. No PFD.  The call has gone out from locals at Pt. Stanley to have the beach closed when the waves here can match those of any Ocean and people insist on swimming. The local vendors are dead set against it. Those beach combers keep their places open. They only have a few months of revenue. The beach open means their cash boxes are open. The politicians don't want the beaches closed, no way. It's a easy call for me. But I don't run a business there. What's a kids life worth?"

He was trolling & the reports say he fell overboard but did not have the kill switch tether attached to himself.  Since reading that report I ensure my tether is attached.  I have always worn my PFD at all times in the past 10 years.   Now, when are we going fishing?  Monday wind conditions look favorable & the air temps are lower than the past few weeks."
979446,buick14,2016-08-14 10:58:00,741,I'm surprised there aren't more drowning in the upper niagara drift swimming and all. Very sad news indeed.
979458,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-14 15:47:00,8243,"Brian you are right he launched out of Crystal Beach and was found south of Maitland. I am a no go this week. Need to pack some boxes, actually I will watch my wife pack, and Thursday movers are coming to my parents retirement place to move them back to the place they moved from 4 weeks ago. Oh man.  From the reports I have read it's supposed to continue hot and humid. I won't go out until this humidity drops and there is a thermocline to speak of. I think it's a waste of gas when the bottom water temps are the same as the surface 75 feet down. I have never looked forward to a cold front in my life, I am now. This is the first summer since I was a kid that the heat has gotten to me. I started working in the steel plant at 16 on weekends and holidays in High School and that took some getting used to. No child endangerment laws then I guess."

979535,manitoubass2,2016-08-15 14:36:00,11391,Sad to hear.  We lose lots here on rainy river but its almost always current related. Usually tourists passing through and the water looks nice for a dip.  Rainy lake is usually alcohol related and driver hits a reef  Its not fun when we get called to go search for bodie(s) on the river.
