Then seen a sign, DONT FORGET TO PAY YOUR ROAD DUES.$100. So that plan got put on the back burner. CRAP. I could see the lake and it looked so inviting. Way to early to be knocking on doors, so headed down the road and found another lake and a  spot to slip the toon in. This spot screamed large mouth. Yes they were there, but not in the big size. Many in the 2 pound range.  What a beauty of a spot.  Some pics to share          Top water again would not get them, so slow rolled a spinner bait just outside the lilly pads, and boiled it  through the pads. Seem to be the ticket to get some to play.  All were pretty much  this size,  Fun morning.      "

978826,misfish,2016-08-07 18:05:00,29133,"Geoff, your lake is on my September list. Will probly be a Thursday visit. Will let you know. There is another one thats  out that way I want to hit too. I have a place to camp out if need be, which is a bonus. Not like the Ram sucks gas, also Im up early enough to be at most lakes within a couple of hours, before the sun awakes .LOL"
