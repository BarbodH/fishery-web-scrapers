979629,Terry,2016-08-16 00:18:00,14456,we use to put spinnerbait skirts on them to make a more versatile Texas rig bait sinker

979638,dave524,2016-08-16 00:51:00,4508,"Almost looks like a collared bullet head jig, that some one forgot to put the hook in the mold on."
979639,mike rousseau,2016-08-16 00:58:00,4661,That's what I thought  Instead of a hook just a shaft straight through to make a hole for the line  I was surprised how well it pops in the plastic
979640,Terry,2016-08-16 01:01:00,14456,"no it was meant for a skirt, thats how they were sold"

979642,mike rousseau,2016-08-16 01:39:00,4661,Yup  Looks like a nicer version of grandpa's
979644,Terry,2016-08-16 01:45:00,14456,yeah i had the exact same ones as you grandfather in 5 different sizes you would change the skirt to match the worm you were using they did work but you had to peg them with a toothpick or they would slide up the line and the fish would bite them rather then the hook
979656,gaspumper,2016-08-16 03:27:00,393,"Its called a slip jig,do-it still makes a mold for it model # slip-6-a has 6 cavity's 1/8-3/16-1/4-3/8-1/2-9/16 sells for $51.95 depending on where you get it."
