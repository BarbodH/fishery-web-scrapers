976513,AKRISONER,2016-07-14 14:35:00,5558,"expensive, but heavily consider a Blue Top Optima battery...when I was in the ""car world"" these were the go to for guys running serious electronics in their cars. The best part about them is that you can flip them any which direction do whatever you want and with them and they hold up.  My experience with cheaper energizer and the like batteries hasnt been great. The life span on them is a bit shotty and they also require a lot of care when it comes to making sure that they dont freeze etc. We lost 3 batteries last winter after a power outtage during a cold snap caused temperatures in our storage area to get below -30 and that was a wrap on our deep cycle marine batteries.  Just my two cents..."
976515,Dutch01,2016-07-14 14:38:00,1431,"There's an article about fishing from a ""tinny"" in the August issue of Ontario Out of Doors.  You might find some good insight there."
976526,Sinker,2016-07-14 15:33:00,8692,"A fully charged batter won't freeze. So, losing your batteries in the cold was your fault for not having them charged, or they were already toast.  I don't bring mine inside ever.  S."
976531,bare foot wader,2016-07-14 16:08:00,1354,"if you buy from cdn tire, I'd check out the nautilus batteries, but make sure it's the real deep cycles, not the hybrid version...I have 2 nautilus agm31's and the nautilus onboard charger as well, was initially skeptical as they get mixed reviews but you need to take battery reviews with a grain of salt, as imo they are very dependent on properly maintaining and charging to get full useful life out of them....my batteries stay plugged in all winter while stored outside in my car port, and then asap when I get home from fishing, on my 5th year and going strong"
976539,AKRISONER,2016-07-14 16:33:00,5558,"A fully charged batter won't freeze. So, losing your batteries in the cold was your fault for not having them charged, or they were already toast.  I don't bring mine inside ever.  S.  probably partially on their way out the door already anyways...further to my point about crappy walmart deep cycles. You get what you pay for.  Also...have you ever seen a car battery freeze in the car? I dont think it gets that cold in the kawarthas.  It happened one epic morning 2 winters ago up in Pointe Au baril. Nothing likes it outside when its 39 below."
976557,Sinker,2016-07-14 18:25:00,8692,"It doesn't have to be that cold for a crappy battery to freeze, but a good, fully charged battery wont freeze. Its just water in them after all.....  The walmart batteries are made by the same company as the costco batteries, and many other ""brand"" batteries. You get out of them what you put into them. If you don't take care of them, they don't last.  S."
976565,Joeytier,2016-07-14 19:58:00,3990,"Hopefully you don't regret being a cheapskate and going the electric route.  Wind will not be kind to you.  I know you said speed is not important but it sure is nice to be able to hop from spot to spot with ease.  Also, if you're fishing alone you're gonna have to load up the bow of your boat with lots of weight or buy cable extensions for your motor, one guy plus a heavy deep cycle in the back is like having a sail in the front of your boat lol"
976580,Tjames09,2016-07-14 21:17:00,664,Still considering a gas motor as well. Just haven't found one in my budget. The electric motor I wouldn't take out to the lake portion. Just the rover.
979413,scuro2,2016-08-14 00:10:00,904,"Here is a different question on the same topic.  If you use a good AGM 31 battery as a trolling motor for several hours how do you know when you are reaching the point of deep dischage, where more use will limit the life of your battery."
979417,wormdunker,2016-08-14 01:05:00,1711,"Minn Kota has a small battery gage which I have used to determine how much charge is left in the battery.  Cheap, about $20. if I remember correctly.  Also my Minn Kota 55lb thrust has a built in gage right on the motor."
979437,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-14 04:47:00,8243,For a 12 foot tinny a good 50 lb thrust and the best battery you can afford will get the job done. If only an electric the battery is the key. For peace of mind any good gas engine up to 9.9 is the choice. Both will troll just fine.
979443,wormdunker,2016-08-14 09:52:00,1711,"Go to batterystuff.com they have very good info about batteries, chargers & how to maintain them properly.  I purchased one of their chargers which also goes through a desulfation process as it is charging.  I have an Interstate & a Nautilus which are 4 years old.  They are still running strong.  I recently returned from a northern Ontario trip & I was getting 12 hours trolling time out of each battery.  Yes I use my 55 lb MinnKota on my 14' Lund for trolling for extended periods of time."
979472,scuro2,2016-08-14 17:43:00,904,"I have a good agm 31, small tin boat, and an older Minn Kota 30 pound thrust electric. I have used this set up but got the wrong type of battery previously. It's a small lake so 30 p t is good enough for me. It's reserve capacity is rated @at 177 min @ 25 amps. Does that mean if I'm mostly trolling, roughly 3 hours?"
979476,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-14 18:03:00,8243,"If I have learned anything about batteries I learned it from here. The #1 thing I did learn is that the difference between a $79.99 battery and the $139.99 battery that all look the same to me looking at them is that the cheap battery has less numbers of available charges in it from 20% to full charge than the more expensive battery does. So that tells me I will get better value from the more expensive battery. The other thing is that batteries sit on retailers shelves for a long time. The older batteries are brought forward on the shelve to sell first, like milk at the store. Check the manufacturers date. You can be buying a battery that is a year old when you can buy a new one. One battery manufacturer makes 80% of all batteries sold. I can't remember the company, something instruments. Then the sellers name is plastered on it. The best deals on batteries in the Hamilton/Niagara area is Acme Battery off Parkdale Ave. North, Paling Ave maybe. He will sell you the best battery available. If you want it to be an Interstate they put that wrap on it, etc. They did 20 years ago at least. They have been there for 30 years and that tells me something. I have bought cranking batteries that lasted 10 years as long as it is maintained, maybe more I sold my cars with their batteries in them. Wormdunker got a good deal in Niagara area.  Better yet buy a gas kicker. All this battery talk is draining. Ha."
976255,Tjames09,2016-07-12 02:32:00,664,Well it looks like this year isn't the year for a complete boat purchase. We do have a small 12ft tin boat with no motor. I was thinking of just getting a 50lb trolling motor transom mount. It wouldn't probably make it to the main part of the lake but I could cruise all the scugog river with it. The other option on a little more costly is getting like a 9hp has motor. Not sure which woukd be more beneficial.
976256,OhioFisherman,2016-07-12 02:55:00,6623,"I used to fish a number of lakes here in Ohio that were water supply reservoirs and electric motors only, 1 was almost 1000 acres in size. A 50lb thrust electric will push a 12 tinny along pretty well, but don't expect miracles from it, any outboard from 6-10 hp will be a lot faster."
976262,Gallie,2016-07-12 03:30:00,1215,"I might have a a 55 lb thrust prowler for sale if you are interested, got a bow mount and its been my security blanket while i learned how to use the motorguide lol."
976267,Sinker,2016-07-12 10:46:00,8692,"I have a 50lb minnkota on a 14ft tinny with a 31 DC Deep cycle battery. It last a fair while, but you cant go too far with it. Better than rowing. A small outboard is definitely the way to go.  S."
976269,wormdunker,2016-07-12 11:01:00,1711,"Put a 9.9 hp on your 12', You'll be very happy.  An electric as your main motor will wear down a battery sooner than you would like."
976272,Korber,2016-07-12 11:28:00,79,I have a nice old Voyager 4.2 Horse motor for sale on the cheap. great old motor and would be much better then an electric.
976275,DanD,2016-07-12 11:49:00,2223,"A buddy of mine son went that route with an electric, on his tinny. He must have found is range very limited; because my buddy couldn't find his mini generator anywhere. His son snagged it to keep the battery charged; while out fishing. LOL  Dan."
976287,Tjames09,2016-07-12 13:55:00,664,"Can you troll with a small HP engine? I mainly just want to troll the river, Im not to interested in the ability to go fast or far. I just need something to go short distances, and keep the boat in place."
976288,John Bacon,2016-07-12 13:56:00,3277,"I think a small outboard will give you better over all use than an electric.  The electric motors are nice for positioning but they have limited range.I think a 9.9hp may be overkill for a 12' boat.  A 4-6hp should be enough power for most situations.If you have to choose one, I would get the gas motor first.  I would probably add and electric later too.  Having both is good.  The electric motor is better for positioning the boat; the gas is better for trolling or moving from one locaton to another."
976289,AKRISONER,2016-07-12 14:01:00,5558,"speaking form experience, ive got a 50lb bowmount on my 14 foot tinner...it will get you around pretty good.  If you are trying to troll though i wouldnt recommend it.  How much would a 4 horse set you back?  If you are looking to cover ground use the 4 to position yourself and let the wind do the work. Thats what i do half the time with the bowmount anyways."
976291,porkpie,2016-07-12 14:33:00,2521,"I will buck the trend here.  Where I live we have a few reservoirs with no gas engines allowed.  I've been all over them in a tin boat with a 50lb thrust electric and now I'm using a sportspal canoe I bought off of this site.  I have yet to hit the oars or the paddles!  On my fishing boat I have a 55lb thrust bow mount that pushes a 16 foot boat weighing 1300lbs plus me at 230, my 16 year old and my 7 year old boys at walleye speeds of 1.1 to 1.6 MPH.  I run a GRP 31 battery up front and can go for about 6 hours continuos and possibly longer.  My old 27 used to drop dead on me after about 4 to 4.5 hours.  I haven't run the 31 to max yet (new battery though so I'll see after it's got a season on it).  A gasser is nice and you can troll with it no problem, but electrics will work and they are so stealthy.  I only troll on my main these days if it's pretty rough out, or if I go out for salmon or something that requires more speed.  Just another point of view."
976297,OhioFisherman,2016-07-12 15:01:00,6623,"Sure you can troll with a small hp engine, 5-10 hp engines are great at it. What is the maximum hp for your boat? Probably 20 hp or less? Some places are safer than others for small boats with small motors, you don't want to venture anywhere known to kick up quickly."
976298,Tjames09,2016-07-12 15:04:00,664,"Sure you can troll with a small hp engine, 5-10 hp engines are great at it. What is the maximum hp for your boat? Probably 20 hp or less? Some places are safer than others for small boats with small motors, you don't want to venture anywhere known to kick up quickly.  Its Sturgeon Lake. Its a busy lake and usually pretty choppy.  The tin boat doesnt have a HP rating on it, its fairly old from what I can tell, but it floats. I looked for the HP rating and never found one. I imagine its topped out a 9.9. Its 12ft 3 row seating."
976304,OhioFisherman,2016-07-12 15:52:00,6623,"Tjames, they made millions of them, they are popular here because we have a lot of smaller lakes and small city water supply reservoirs that are electric motor only and you don't really need an outboard to fish a 30-100 acre lake.  If it's an older boat 9.9 or 10 hp might be it's limit, older boats tended to be a bit narrower than newer boats, most used to have a tag on the inside of the transom with a hp and weight capacity?  As a kid I spent a lot of time motoring around Pointe Au Baril in a 14 footer with an old 5 hp motor, I didn't get anywhere fast, but it was enough to get around and beat rowing or an electric.  It's been years since I was up north, I can just imagine the boat traffic now, and like here the trend has probably gone to bigger is better? A lot of bigger boat traffic can make for a bumpy ride in a small boat.  You don't have to go fast to catch fish though, and going slower gives you more time to explore new places and methods."
976305,Gallie,2016-07-12 15:57:00,1215,"An electric trolling motor is only as good as the battery you hook it up too, when i was younger we fished for years out of an inflatable raft and a canoe with an electric motor. I bought a big nautilus marine battery and could troll all day on 3-4 setting with no worries. Plus use max(5) if i wanted to boogie somewhere."
976307,GBW,2016-07-12 16:00:00,8460,"I have a older Johnson 9.9 that was last serviced by our very own ""Big Cliff"" that I'd sell you.  Motor, gas can and line.  PM me if interested. PS: It sat last year unused so you know."
976308,AKRISONER,2016-07-12 16:02:00,5558,"for your reference Tjames, i spent an entire day 12+ hours up on georgian bay using a minkotta 50lb with an energizer marine battery, we had the 14 foot tinner with 2 guys, a casting deck loaded with gear and the battery still had a quarter power left after 12 hours."
976324,Dabluz,2016-07-12 17:49:00,701,"I had a 14 foot tinny Espadon Cartop14 made by Princecraft and maximum size of motor I could use was 7.5 h.p.  With the 7.5, it would fly along at a good 25 km/h.  I put a 10 h.p. motor on it after reinforcing the transom with 2 very large 3/4 inch panels.  I used a 2 h.p. gas motor or my 32 lb thrust electric for trolling.  There are no bodies of water in my region that prohibit gas engines."
976405,TJames,2016-07-13 10:33:00,11,"Ended up getting the electric. The cost difference was fairly substantial. New electric was $260, and new gas is $1200 for like a 5HP. Even used nothing was under $500, most were closer to the $1000 mark,"
976409,porkpie,2016-07-13 11:26:00,2521,"Keep your trip reasonable in duration and keep a set of oars handy just in case (oars, not paddles.) and you'll be just fine.  You'll probably catch more fish as well because you'll always be at trolling speed!"
