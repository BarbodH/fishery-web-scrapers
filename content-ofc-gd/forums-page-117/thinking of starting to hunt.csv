979767,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-17 02:50:00,8243,"I tried but never got into it. The boys and I had a remote camp we went to on the Ottawa years back Fishing until hunting season. I went out with them as a shadow for a morning goose hunt. Laying on my back in a cold damp frozen corn field with stalks jammed up my kiester in the dark waiting for daylight is not what I call fun. As soon as it was daylight I heard boom, boom, boom and before I could get to my feet it was over. So I went along for a Deer hunt, with my knees it was a bust too. I did learn that Blue Jays are Forest Rats as in they warn every other animal you are there.  I'll stick to fishing. Shooting, that I like, I still get to the gun club for some trap skeet when invited and that I enjoy.  Good luck to you. I hear it's fun."
979769,GBW,2016-08-17 03:15:00,8460,"I want to thank you all for the comments and please keep them coming. As for my ex, we talk and I help her when in need and pay more than I have to in child support but she would NEVER help me out if I said something like ""can you drop the kids off here as I work till 9pm?"".  She would say come get them the next day in the AM then...  It's only 65KM away so...  LOL! Even if I can study online and get a book used and save cash I'm all for it!  I have my buddies and family who will help me with my Q&A"
979772,BITEME,2016-08-17 11:51:00,1968,There is the option of studying yourself and just taking the test The PAL test is pretty easy but I'm not sure about what's involved in the hunting nowadays  they have done away with the challenge you must now sit the course
979776,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-17 13:52:00,535,"$300 each but we shared the books so it was $585 total. Some people charge $500 around here per person for both courses combined so it's a pretty good deal.  As for being out there early in the morning, I've done it for fishing and I'm always up early so that shouldn't be a problem. I just love being outdoors. There's more to a hunt than the actual hunt itself."
979777,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-17 13:53:00,535,"Yeah the only one you can study on your own and then go write the test is the turkey course. Yes, you have to take a special course just to hunt turkey....."
979782,dave524,2016-08-17 14:45:00,4508,"I can't believe how these courses have turned into a business and the fees charged  . I did the Hunter Ed courses back in the 70's, for members and kids of the local OFAH affiliated Hunters and Anglers Club for the cost of the handbook and materials and used the clubhouse for the course."
979786,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-17 15:36:00,535,"I don't mind spending paying for courses and licences as long as the money is being put back into wildlife management. Having a 6 hour course specifically for turkeys is a bit much though. How much turkey specific knowledge do you need? Charge extra for a turkey licence, fine, but another course just for that?"

Too bad it don't work that way, I got my Handbooks and Tests from the MNR, could have actually been the Dept of Lands and Forests back then   , I was free to charge the going rate with nothing going to them. I assume the PAL course is the same, about '96 I got a letter from the Attorney General, Ministry of Justice asking me if I wanted to get dual certification, I assume all Hunter Ed guys got the letter and the MNR gave our names to the Ministry of Justice as possible candidates to teach the PAL course. I really doubt the office of the Attorney General  gives any money to wildlife management. The OFAH club that I gave the course for did raise pheasants from day old chicks for years and release them in the fall, not many small local clubs like that anymore."
979800,hunteronwheels,2016-08-17 19:30:00,112,Does anybody know what exactly they dive into with the background check? Is it only a criminal check unless there's a ex involved? they will also want to check on medical records to do with depression ptsd and other things that have involved care and/or drugs you took/take i have ptsd and due to my medication i am not able to get my pal but i did take the hunter course in my late 40's and now hunt with my crossbow i do still have a hunters course book and would be willing to give it to anyone who wants it   this form tells you exactly what the ask 
979816,GBW,2016-08-17 21:24:00,8460,"I thank you all for the info!  But from the looks of it, I'm going to have to wait a bit longer.  I just don't have the funds and I'm sure I will not be ready in time for this season.  If I come up with the cash then I'll take it over the winter (if offered). Feel free to keep this going for others wondering too!"
979817,dave524,2016-08-17 21:30:00,4508,"I recommend getting the Restricted PAL the first time even though you don't think you'll need it, often interests change and I've seen personal firearms moved to restricted status requiring the extra certification."
979729,GBW,2016-08-16 22:07:00,8460,"Well with the recent posts and my cousin and buddy bugging me I'm thinking about it.  I sure don't have the funds at this time to go buy gun's or bow's but I need to learn more to the process. I have fired many gun's when I was in the Canadian Armed Forces over 20 years ago so gun's I'm ok with.  But what do I need to be legal?  I know a with a PAL I can buy and sell a gun.  I see 2.5 day courses for $150 in my area, but what do you get with that? IF I was to hunt I'd be going out with guys who have been hunting a very long time so they would be my 'teachers' for that as I'd be a tag along using their guns.  Do I just need a PAL and then a hunting license for water foul?  I don't have the cash or time for deer... Any help here would be great! Oh and I need to keep my costs DOWN!  I just had some BIG bills as of late... Thanks folks! G"
979730,GBW,2016-08-16 22:09:00,8460,"Oh and the reason I'm not asking them about this right now, one is in Mexico and my cousin is non-stop with work and house reno's"
979731,kickingfrog,2016-08-16 22:29:00,8333,"There are some nuances but yes, the hunter safety and gun course are needed. They can usually be done as a 2 day course. The OFAH site will list courses in your area. Once you pass that you have to wait for your background check from the RCMP. That can take a few months. Once you get that, then you can get a small game licence and you're good to go for some species. If you are hunting migratory birds (ducks, geese and what not) you also need a migratory game bird stamp that you get from a Canada post outlet (think you can get it online as well).  Take that all with a grain of salt as I did not sleep at a holiday inn last night."
979732,GBW,2016-08-16 22:37:00,8460,"With the background check, I have nothing to worry about other than if they contact my ex-wife.  She'll think I'm getting this for other reasons as when I was with her I kept telling her no to hunting while the kids are young... So what you are saying is my best bet is the $150 course then?  My problem with that is the dates and times.  I work every other weekend and the weekends I don't work it's my time with my kids.  Is there any 'private' ones anyone does? And I too didn't sleep at a holiday inn either..."
979733,kickingfrog,2016-08-16 22:46:00,8333,I believe that the course is offered sometimes in evenings. Maybe 5 nights of 3ish hours (there is a minimum number of hours). The ofah site isn't the only place to find the course. Local gun clubs or stores will host them too. Maybe even Sir Sandford when the students get back?

Pretty much right on the money: You'll need an outdoors card if you don't already have one but you should have it already. You need to take the course, you can't even borrow a firearm without having completed that. Then there is your small game license, migratory game bird permit, turkey license (oh and you have to take a course before you can get that) bear, dear, and moose licenses.  Now, when it comes to a gun; IF you go through the courses and complete them, IF you have all the necessary paperwork in place, I have a Remington 870 Express magnum which I would LEND you until I need it back (which might be never). It's the old style so it's pretty much indestructible and by switching out the chokes (and I have the set) you can use it for just about any hunting you would ever want to do.  One step at a time but keep me in the loop."

979738,kickingfrog,2016-08-16 23:02:00,8333,Not sure what the wait time is right now for the background check but even if you passed the course yesterday it would be unlikely to get your firearms licence before November assuming it all went smoothly.

Its worth running it by her first rather than a surprised phone call.

Hunting equipment is expensive but you can get the stuff you need over time. Bow hunting might be an option if you don't end up getting a PAL..
