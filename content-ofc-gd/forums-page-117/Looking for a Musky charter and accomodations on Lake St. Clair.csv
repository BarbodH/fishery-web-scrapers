979643,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-16 01:44:00,8243,"I need to catch a fish, and what better than to catch a Musky. There was a Musky guy that chartered on LSC that was a member here that went by the name of Handlebarz, He was very active here but I haven't seen him here for quite some time. Anyone have a contact # because he would be my first choice if he still does it. We would go out on a charter then spend a few days on our own. I have never set foot on that lake fishing.  The second thing would be a cottage with water access or a motel close to a ramp recommended. A slip at the cottage would be best.  We are talking the end of Sept into Oct. My God Daughters wedding is Sept 17th and my fishing buddy is my Compare. Her wedding gift is a 40 year old home Dom and Mary bought for them in Hammertown in May and he and I (plus a few dozen guys that owed him) did a complete gut and remodel, more he than I. We all chipped in. All top notch materials. I told him if there is life after death I want to come back as his grand child.  Please any recommendations."
979645,Bondar,2016-08-16 01:57:00,817,www.handlebarzfishing.com Mike is a great guy and you'll get to cruise in his nice new stratos
979648,leaf4,2016-08-16 02:09:00,2466,"Mike does casting guides, if you're into trolling I went with rampage fishing 2 years back and we got into 8 or 9 for the day, he considers that slow.  We just stayed at the comfort inn or whatever it was, about 15 mins from the marina"
979655,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-16 03:24:00,8243,I would rather troll. I tossed bricks with Dan Columby a few years ago and needed Tommy John surgery after that. Thanks Lucas. I'll consider him. Where was the Comfort Inn?
979661,leaf4,2016-08-16 08:55:00,2466,"Here's their website, from what I remember we told the hotel we were on a charter with him and it saved us 10-15% also  http://www.muskie.name/chatham-ontario-hotels-motels.htm  We stayed at the one on Richmond"
979664,outllaw,2016-08-16 10:28:00,1232,"mike parker handlebarz,casting, if you only want to troll call ian jones. fishlsc.com hes a young gun with lotsa drive."
979667,bigcreekdad,2016-08-16 12:14:00,546,Google Spencer Berman....very good guide
979675,leaf4,2016-08-16 13:15:00,2466,Another guide service that's been having a great year from the pictures posted on his Facebook page is Pond predators fishing guide  https://m.facebook.com/muskiecharter/
979677,outllaw,2016-08-16 13:37:00,1232,"pond predator is very qualified. tell capt nick,george sent you. nick is dedicted 27ft sportcraft.we sponsor nick"
979678,Brettiop,2016-08-16 13:49:00,279,"Yupp there are dozens of good musky charters out there, most have it dialed in.  Pond predator surely catches alot of fish...  Kyle Moxon guide service sure has been posting a lot of brutes on there facebook page...another young guy just starting out but seems to find alot of 50""++ class fish...  Can-am, Rampage, Drifter 2...they all know what they are doing"
979688,landry,2016-08-16 15:43:00,1005,I would go with Rampage or Drifter as they are experienced trollers. Berman mostly casts and Mocin is a new young guide but seems to do well. Drifter and Rampage launch out of Lighthouse Cove. There is a really nice cottage u can rent there too near the ramp and corner store/LCBO.  They list on Kijiiji. we often stay at the petite Dragon motel right by the Belle River ramp.
979691,landry,2016-08-16 15:49:00,1005,I couldn't find it on Kijiji but I did see a sign out front last week. I will get the info if u want it when I go on Thursday
979693,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-16 16:26:00,8243,I've Googled most of the suggestions and they all sound great. I have sent a few air mails out. Thanks all.
979714,SuperDave,2016-08-16 19:27:00,204,"If you wait a few weeks longer, you won't need a guide to catch fish. They come to you at the river mouth. You can troll the Thames River and catch fish without going out on the big lake. Or, you can join the fun and combat fish the river mouth with the pier chuckers and the rest of us wingnuts out there!"
979808,Shloim,2016-08-17 20:27:00,515,"Email [emailÂ protected] he has a great cabin, very reasonable, super nice people Brad n Maryanne. sleeps 3 beautifully, then there are bunk beds.The dock is 15 feet from your door, cant beat it IMO. We stayed there in May and have booked 4 more dates since, in the fall."
