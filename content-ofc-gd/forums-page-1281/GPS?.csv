27043,irishfield,2007-01-26 23:38:00,26272,To find the shoal/hump you marked while in the boat during the summer...
27044,FishFinder,2007-01-26 23:38:00,481,knowing where you are
27053,irishfield,2007-01-26 23:50:00,26272,"Absolutely FF. On a lake like Simcoe a compass at minimum in your pocket, at least, to find shore...and take a heading/bearing while you can still see it before the weather turns....so you'll know how to get home. A GPS would allow you to continue to move around hap hazardly and still find your way home...provided the batteries don't die!"
27054,urbanangler1990,2007-01-26 23:51:00,933, i think i figured that one out...   thnx irish
27055,SlowPoke,2007-01-26 23:51:00,2984,"Waypoints are your friend... Heading out on the ice (walking, sleding, atving) drop waypoints for hazzard areas (cracks, slush, holes etc.) Mark your good spots as Irishfield said and visit them year after year. When you're ready to get off the ice, follow your tracks on the gps for a safe return route... especially handy when a storm blows up or in the dark. Meeting some friends on the ice? tell 'em where you are! -Brian"
27062,Terry,2007-01-27 00:03:00,14456,"in the past we would look for the blood spots on the ice to know we were in the same spot we were on the day before , for whitefish, if it snowed  it was a guessing game and with a gps now there is no guess work"
27086,fishindevil,2007-01-27 00:37:00,6254,well just like what wayne said...you mark all the waypoints in your boat then go to them in the winter...its a deadly combo...it works all the time....
