26404,blaque,2007-01-25 14:08:00,2419,"  You got it Rich! Try listening to a pop radio station nowadays (rock/metal format) and finding a guitar solo to listen to. Ive been listening to metal since about the mid 80's and Im now 36 and wont put it down. The talent out there nowadays is amazing (with the right groups).......try some of the more melodic metal bands i.e. Killswitch Engage, or All That Remains.......for starters. ATR's ""This Darkened Heart"" release is the best of their work. Anything Killswitch is amazing, and i mean talented. Metal gets a bad rap for just being niose. But the talent these guys have for musical arrangements, balancing brilliant melodic riffs with powerful vocals, and just plain goosebump raising guitars and drums.....its just ridiculous. (install a subwoofer in your vehicle for the full effect   ) KSE has been stuck in my CD player for a long time now. Good listening."

Canadian boys all, but Levon, he is a good ole boy from Tennesee. Bob Dylan thought they were good enough to be his back up band, they proved to be better than him at times. Ronnie Hawkins might be the daddy of all thats got country and rock roots, he also figured they made a pretty good back up band. Look at who showed up to play with them when did The Last Waltz.  Genre: toss up between Rock a Billy and Blues.  I was raised on the classics like Floyd, Goddo, whatever happened in the late 60's thru 70's.  All positive stuff.  Don't have much use for fluff like disco or canned pop or negative stuff like thug rap.  Music ought to inspire us to better things. If it doesn't then it probably isn't really music"

They were great, even though Ritchie Blackmore (guitarist/songwriter) had retired and wasn't touring with the band. He's an unbelievable talent and I was disappointed he wasn't there, but the show was still great.  I've seen Goddo in concert along with a bunch of other lesser known bands. Some bigger names too like Scorpions, Quiet Riot, Triumph (2x), Stones (2x), Paul McCartney, Black Crows, Deep Purple, and dare I admit I attended a Celine Dion concert (against my will).  I'm exited to hear tickets for Heaven and Hell (AKA Black Sabbath) go on sale this Friday. Ronnie James Dio is doing the vocals in place of Ozzy Osbourne. One of the greatest rock vocalists in my opinion. He did a couple of albums with Sabbath. (Heaven and Hell / Mob Rules) Two of my favourites.  I would have loved to have seen Queen, with Freddy Mercury. Dang AIDS. He was one of the best vocalists and entertainers in the business. Taken away from us far too soon.  Iron Maiden put on a great show too. Disappointed I missed them last year. Bruce Dickinson is another amazing voice in the rock world.  Would have loved to see Lynard Skynard before the plane crash took Ronnie Van Zandt, but if they roll into town again, I'll certainly be looking for tickets. (I think they were here recently)  I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  Underrated ? Hmmm ? I suppose there are many. None that pop out and bite me on the nose right now."
