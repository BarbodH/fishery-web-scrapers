26277,sturgman,2007-01-25 02:01:00,249,I have been really happy since I took the advice from some of the guys on here a few years ago to download the free AVG virus protection software. But it seems in Febuarary all users will require to pay for there services. Any other free virus software protection software programs available for download on the net that you guys have been using or can recommend? I hate to pay for something that I can get for free
26279,bigfish1965,2007-01-25 02:04:00,3382,How much are they going to charge? It would be very difficult to keep something like that as Open Source. Updates are daily.
26287,Bernie,2007-01-25 02:16:00,3190,Havent seen anything on the antivirus going to fee but the antispyware is only a limited time trial. I have used avast antivirus with good success in the past as well.
26288,DanTheMan,2007-01-25 02:19:00,257,"Here are a few that are free.I havent tried them,cause I use Norton. But I hear a few good things about them  http://www.avast.com/  http://www.bitdefender.com/ca/  http://www.clamwin.com/  Hope this helps"
26294,Hooked,2007-01-25 02:31:00,891,"When I kept seeing a message popup when I had v.7.1, I thought they were going to discontinue the free package.  But that is not so, it still will be free.  Here is a clipping from their site:  GRISOFT is announcing a new version of the AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition. This new 7.5 version with improved performance and full compatibility with the latest Windows Vista version is available. Users that are using AVG Free 7.1 will be provided with a specific dialog, within the next few weeks, with the opportunity to choose the right option fulfilling their needs. AVG Free 7.1 version will be discontinued on 18th of Feb 2007."
26295,JerseyDog,2007-01-25 02:31:00,190,"I have an old laptop that I use AVG on because of the low overhead, but for my main machine I use Norton.  If you have a modern fast computer, spend the $50 on Norton.  Get one virus and like insurance, you will have wished you spent the $50 upfront."
26296,Hooked,2007-01-25 02:34:00,891,"  I have read a couple articles concerning AV's, and BitDefender was ranked above Norton each time.  Just an FYI."
26313,Bernie,2007-01-25 03:16:00,3190,Used Norton in the past. I found it slowed my puter down too much.  I found it was always popping something up or a reminder as well. And it was tough to get rid of if you ever wanted to drop it. Avg has defended me well for the last 3 years-no virus. And free.
26318,DanTheMan,2007-01-25 03:27:00,257,"  Its because its working   AVG works well, but IMO, Norton is by far the best antivirus out there.  But, thats just my opinion"
26321,bigfish1965,2007-01-25 03:36:00,3382,I'd rank Kaspersky and AVG ahead of Norton because of Nortons resource usage and the way it rewrites alot of your registry and is so damm difficult to uninstall.
26338,Corey,2007-01-25 04:08:00,355,"It's not that you have to pay for AVG... the message you are getting is that the version you are running (7.1) is discontinued and no longer supported. All you need to do is download version 7.5 and upgrade, for free.  No need to worry, just take the free upgrade and continue with what I feel is the best free AV software out there.  cd."
26342,sirfish,2007-01-25 04:21:00,175,Me doesn't think sturgman took the time to read the whole pop up. It only takes a minute or so to dload 7.5 FREE . IMO still the best FREE one out there. Norton is just a pain in the azz.Dunping it out was the best thing i did for my puter.
26345,danc,2007-01-25 04:27:00,4677,I've also switched from Norton to AVG free and am quite pleased with it.
26349,JerseyDog,2007-01-25 04:29:00,190,"To clarify, I think Norton is a great product but also a total resource pig and I would only recommend for people running fast systems with tons of memory.  For older rigs, AVG is definately the choice and not b/c its free, but b/c it runs with very little overhead and therefore does not bog down slower, older systems."
26476,Corey,2007-01-25 17:06:00,355,"no	Anti-Spyware ... There is a free antispyware program available from them, so you have 2 programs, not 1 for all no	Anti-Spam ... Be discriminating with handing out your email address, your ISP should have anti spam filtering on their servers no	Firewall ... If you have highspeed internet, buy a $20 router, perfect hardware based firewall, if not, use the free built in windows firewall no	64-bit and server support ... If you are actually running a 64bit version of windows, chances are you know enough to find something else that works. If you have a server in your house, you most likely know the same. no	24/7 Technical Support ... Who cares... never needed it, rock solid software with updates frequencies that match commercial AV software no	High-speed updates ... The updates are plenty fast, takes a few seconds through my cable modem no	Multiple languages ... I only speak english, considering it's german made software, english works for me, nothing interesting to read anyhow no	Detailed settings ... ok... so I can't exclude a keylogger or some other kind of virus that I *really* want on my system, bummer no	Consent for commercial use ... if you are using the machine on a business system, you should purchase the commercial version, for those in the know, it pops up and complains if the machine is joined to a domain only. If it's a single computer, it'll never complain.  try it out, you won't be dissappointed.  cd."
26609,Snypa,2007-01-25 22:23:00,25,"AVG is excellent, its free & updates almost daily.. what more can you ask for"
26651,Peter Panfish,2007-01-25 23:59:00,46,"I suggest seeing if you can get ahold of NOD32, its not free unless your an arrr pirate, but its well worth paying for, I like it because it doesnt hog your computers resources like norton."
26674,mepps,2007-01-26 01:07:00,1301,"Im with Rick, AVG and Kapersky is better then Norton.  Personally I would say stay away from Norton and Mcafee all together. I consider myself to be pretty hardcore computer user.  I reun alot of domanding software and games and having a spiyware/virus program that sucks up resources is just not gonna gut it for me.  I have used AVG for ages, and its great, I also liked usign NOT32 which i got from teh place I was working.  You can find free software for just about everything you need. I recently started using Ubunto (no cost linux OS) and I am very impressed with teh amount of open source free software offered to do just about everythign you cost hundreds (or thousands) to do on a windows machine.  http://www.ubuntu.com/"
26704,Corey,2007-01-26 02:54:00,355,"now now... linux has it's place, but I really don't think it's here. 99% of OFC'ers have a tough enough time with Windows. Linux is not the right thing to plug here.  Don't get me wrong, I run several linux box's for various things, including an 8 node beowolf cluster, but I am geek #2, or so it has been said  Let's keep things relatively simple.  cd."
26733,mepps,2007-01-26 03:51:00,1301,"That is the common misconception for Linux, running Ubuntu is not much different then windows, it even looks similar!  If you have an old PC lyign aroudn and get board, I say give it a try!"
