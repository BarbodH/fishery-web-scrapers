26455,douG,2007-01-25 16:11:00,2693,Kris at FishOnLine has a good selection of European lures like Salmo and Marmooshkas.  JB's Fishing Depot is also a good place to look.
26615,buckster,2007-01-25 22:51:00,530,the bait shop on the 400 has them but be prepared to pay 3 times more than anywhere else
26626,steelhedrmatt,2007-01-25 23:11:00,278,"The bait shop in Burk's Falls has most salmo lures. If he doesn't have it, he'll usually order it for you."
26659,tjsa,2007-01-26 00:17:00,1578,"A bud just bought one a three weeks ago, and I said ONE. They are expensive. He bought the 3rd biggest size out of 4 sizes I think. It was over 9 bucks, but the action on the thing is incredible.  Perch colour for walleye is a killer, chartreuse for lakers is also supposedly.  I will pick up a couple for laker season soon, and hope to have a report to back them up. Darn............. with taxes in, 2 of them is worth almost a case of Lucky, lol.  I think I will be using power pro to jig with them, don't wanna break one off at that price."
26670,Roy,2007-01-26 00:55:00,13728,We nicknamed one of the kids in gym class that. That was 47 years ago...probably just 'Darter' now....

26785,bassinator,2007-01-26 12:22:00,32,"Went to see Kris at Fishonline yesterday thanks to douG's suggestion and he had them. Also had a great selection of european ice jigs and different lures that you can't get from the ""BIG STORES"".  Kris was really helpful and since it was my first time there he also made my entire purchase tax free!! ....thanks Kris. Don't think they would be willing to do that at the BPS.  Anyhow just thought I'd share and will let y'all know how ""MR. Chubby"" works this seasons. Thanks to all who responded.....Tight Lines Jeff"
26838,douG,2007-01-26 15:13:00,2693,"Kris is great, isn't he?  He's got to be the most enthusiastic tackleshop owner in the world.  Talk yer ear off.  Good luck with your chubby."
26895,buckster,2007-01-26 17:09:00,530,where exactly is fishonline located?
26896,douG,2007-01-26 17:15:00,2693,"Buckster, the best way to find them is from their website.  Clink on the link in my earlier post, above."
