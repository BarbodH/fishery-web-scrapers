26948,xrap,2007-01-26 19:56:00,683,I'm going to buy my ice rod today and I don't know wether I should buy new line as well or use my steelhead line from fall. I still have a spool with about 100 yards on it. The line is Gamma and is 6lbs. Would this line be good to put on a ice rod. I'll be fishing for pike crappie blue gill. I don't know if that matters but anyone have any suggestions on lines?
26950,buckster,2007-01-26 20:00:00,530,sounds good.....but i use a florocarbon leader 100% of the time for any fishing
26951,Clampet,2007-01-26 20:05:00,1947,"Yank off a couple of feet, then try to brak it with your hands. Good 6lb test should provide a fair bit of resistance. If it breaks easy, get rid of it and buy some 6lb trilene xl. It has an uncanny way of lasting for several seasons."
26953,xrap,2007-01-26 20:14:00,683,"I always have 4lb seaguar flurocarbon.  How long of a lead do you use?    Hey clampet this is very strong line, but I was more worried if 6lb is to thick for ice rods?"
26957,buckster,2007-01-26 20:16:00,530,i usually use 2ft  i wouldnt use much more because i dont like reeling in the swivel through my guides.  I usually use an 8lb mono with a 6lb floro for live bait and for jigging depending on the species i go to an 8 floro
27085,FinS,2007-01-27 00:37:00,463,if you are after perch go with 2lb flurocarbon does wonders pickerel and pike 4-8lb trilene ice the blue stuff
