26889,brkygetrr,2007-01-26 16:57:00,6,right o Tony...thanks I'll give that a try though without a fax handy it may be difficult..lol.. I may just end up driving up there during the week some time and stop in to the office...worst aprt is I was just there last week and only picked up the new list...that'll teach me for trusting the technology and not the ol' fashioned paper system...    hey Troutologist...you can get me at [emailÂ protected]'ll send ya 06' once I get your address  Brkygetrr
