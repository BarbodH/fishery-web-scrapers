26532,cityfisher,2007-01-25 18:34:00,959,"Hey all,  I was planing to get a power auger this year but since the season was so late and other $$ issues Ive held off for now.  My dad has a chainsaw laying around and wondered how a Chainsaw fairs against the ice ? I know some hut operators use it to make there ice hut holes but never seen DIY ice fisherman useing a chainsaw to make smaller holes  Good idea to bring it VS my manual auger ??"
26535,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-25 18:38:00,2585,i have seen them used before looked to work ok.  CHeers!
26538,irishfield,2007-01-25 18:44:00,26272,Make sure you slide the block back in the hole when done! Death trap otherwise....I think it was Spiel that took a dunk in a similar freshly iced over hole.
26543,Terry,2007-01-25 18:48:00,14456,that or a spud was the only way to cut a hole when I was growing up   you get damn wet using a chain saw and as the ice gets thicker it's not as easy as one would think to get the big piece of ice out of the hole or to push it down and over..auger is the way to go
26544,carll2,2007-01-25 18:48:00,443,cant oil from the chain saw get in the water?
26553,tonyb,2007-01-25 19:07:00,1637,Auger vs. Chainsaw = You staying dry vs you getting wet  Tony
26599,camillj,2007-01-25 21:55:00,1988,"I watched a couple fella's messing with a chainsaw on Lake Joe last year ... not only were they making a heck of a racket for about half an hour ... because the ice was so thick they really were having trouble ... and getting soaked ... IMHO it actually looked more than a little dangerous .... but was god for a laugh since nobody got hurt .... but seriously ... I cut six 8"" holes in half the time they cut their two and stayed dry and quiet through it all. Also ... a lot easier to transport the manual auger"
26607,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-25 22:18:00,4399,I used a chainsaw once many years it was very messy got soaked slipped and fell and almost cut my leg off so needless to say i prefer an auger.
26624,DanTheMan,2007-01-25 23:09:00,257, Exactly!!!!!!
26702,jjcanoe,2007-01-26 02:47:00,744,First time I ever went ice fishing me and my buddy rode the bikes down to the river  with our new tip ups we made from plans in OOD magazine We use an axe to chop our 1st ice hole.  jjcanoe
26737,Carp,2007-01-26 03:56:00,1488,"I've seen, and heard, the chainsaw method. Extremely messy and wet. I would think the oil gets in the lake too.  I have a 10"" power auger and it's the best thing for thick ice and/or quick holes. ......and I don't get wet."
26741,joonmoon,2007-01-26 04:03:00,528,Used a hatchet once...got wet. Use my hand auger all the time....stay dry. You make the call.
26745,POLLIWOGG,2007-01-26 04:08:00,835,"You would have to rinse the oil tank clean with varsol, oil slick on the water = huge fine."
26788,cityfisher,2007-01-26 12:31:00,959,Thanks guys ! ill stick with my manual auger...dont feel like getting soaked when its -15 out !!
