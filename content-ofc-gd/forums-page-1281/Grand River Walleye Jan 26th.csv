27258,Fishmaster,2007-01-27 17:54:00,920,Ill post this pictures later tonight when i finally get home ..will be out again tonight trying for some big girls ...... Clampet: where have you fished the Grand i have never really went out walleye fishing on the river and not got walleye.. we stock between 10000 and 30000 Walleye a year ..so you may wana try something diffrent ..im sure other guys on this site have done very well also ..
27303,Clampet,2007-01-27 20:34:00,1947, I tried from shore just below the damn.  There were some other people who were fishing there also with no success.  So I never went back.
27319,xrap,2007-01-27 21:29:00,683,"  I fished thier alot in the summer from shore and everytime we went we atleast got a few small walleye around 14 inch range. It's a fun place to fish but there are alot of snags there, gonna cost you a bit."
27321,Clampet,2007-01-27 21:36:00,1947,Thanks.  I had the impression that it was over fished.
