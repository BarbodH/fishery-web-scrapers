26668,Canuck2fan,2007-01-26 00:48:00,1444,I do what I did today. Find current on a trib with a little opening in the ice and have at it. Of course I had to break open about 50 feet of sheet ice with my rod holder tied to my stringer so I could fish. It was a bit of a joke though watching 20 or so rainbow swimming around totally ignoring all the different baits I had with me.  The craziest part was everytime I smashed open more ice the bows would come cruising over to check things out. I would have thought the noise and dragging my rod holder would have spooked them. NOPE just made them swim over for a look see.
26677,huntervasili,2007-01-26 01:27:00,1604,"Fly tying, and hunting are what I do to keep that fever away... although it comes back afer 3 or so days of not doing some sort of hunting or fishing related activity..."
