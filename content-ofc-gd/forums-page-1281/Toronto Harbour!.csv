26825,Headhunter,2007-01-26 14:47:00,5703,"From my vantage point high above the big smoke, it sure looks like Toronto Harbour has frozen over!!! Yesterday, I could see the bays around the islands had frozen up, but was suprised this morning. It looks like the whole harbour, as much as I can see, has hardened up! HH"
26831,snag,2007-01-26 15:00:00,1932,My ice auger and I have a date at the islands with some pike next week.
26836,motv8tr,2007-01-26 15:09:00,2587,"Frozen at the top maybe, but on the news last night, they showed it's only surface ice right now and won't take much to go through it.  Maureen"
26839,huntervasili,2007-01-26 15:14:00,1604,Its supposed to get above Zero anyway and rain.. so I wouldnt really count on any time soon..
26842,bucktail,2007-01-26 15:23:00,1857,Rain????? Not sure where you are getting that one but this forecast is  set up for one of the coldest stretches in a few years.  http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/city/pages/o...3_metric_e.html  and another http://wwwa.accuweather.com/canada-forecas...Z2&metric=1
26844,Clampet,2007-01-26 15:25:00,1947,"Ahh the thrill, the thrill gentlemen to be on thin ice. Live the adventure. You only live once."
26845,huntervasili,2007-01-26 15:26:00,1604,I watch the weather channel and they said up to zero with chances of rain for two days...
26858,iceguy,2007-01-26 15:53:00,341,Like Bucktail said coldest strech in years so much for el nino. Everything is gonna be solid for a little while. If ya like Icefishing a hut will  be in order.
26863,ehg,2007-01-26 15:59:00,2666,"Been contemplating pike on quick strike rig at the Leslie spit for years. Maybe this year. Thanks for update!  cheers,  ehg"
26865,huntervasili,2007-01-26 16:01:00,1604,"I am not saying by any means you are wrong, but, that when I looked at the website again today it said on saturday it is supposed to get to 1... http://www.theweatherchannel.ca/weather/ci...es/CAON0100.htm"
26866,Headhunter,2007-01-26 16:02:00,5703,"The Spit has been frozen over for a couple of days now... I suspect the recent cold snap will have added more to it. Sorry can't say how much is there, but definately been atleast four days of ice. HH"
26903,urbanangler1990,2007-01-26 17:29:00,933, can u really ice fish around the islands?    i have never heard of such a thing? has anyone ever tried this?
26911,kemper,2007-01-26 18:04:00,2232,All this talk of ice is depressing!  SOFT WATER PLEASE! lol
26913,Jon,2007-01-26 18:05:00,209,"My buddies and I ice fished the Islands about 5 years ago.  Having done well in the spring and fall from a boat, we thought it would be worthwhile.  We got nothing and haven't tried ice fishing there since.  Jon"
26920,snag,2007-01-26 18:14:00,1932, Don't know but thought it might be worth a try if I can do it!
26921,lew,2007-01-26 18:16:00,12767,"I drove along Queens Quay yesterday and although there is ice in some areas, there's still open water in alot of places.  Toronto Harbor Police did a TV segment 2 nights ago at their Rees St. station, just below the CN Tower, showing how unsafe the ice is by walking across it and breaking thru.  Be careful folks if you decide to try it"
26925,snag,2007-01-26 18:33:00,1932," Your right Lew,  I went by Ont. Place and was watching the search and rescue team (20 ppl) practicing ice rescues the other day. If you don't freeze to death, the mutigenic sludge will get you."
26984,fishindevil,2007-01-26 21:34:00,6254,well you might be on to something snag if you could get there and drill a hole ...you never know right..that would make for an interesting report...cheers
26987,Ben_Daniels,2007-01-26 21:41:00,435,From my vantage point it looks pretty open still...im in  the CN tower.
