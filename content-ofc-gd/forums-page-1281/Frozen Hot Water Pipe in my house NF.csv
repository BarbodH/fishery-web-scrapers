27202,pigeonfisher,2007-01-27 12:01:00,696,"Well, Bad news.  The pipe froze again overnight.  Wasn't even that cold out.  Now I am more than a little bit surprised that the heat added into the area didn't solve the problem.  I am wondering if it might be freezing closer to the sink.  almost as quickly as I found it was frozen it has unfrozn itelf.  This can't happen all the time as at some point I am just tempting fate.  I will have to call in some small today to get near those pipes.  DANG"
27239,Jigger,2007-01-27 16:32:00,1237,"Hey PF, too bad about the pipe freezing again. If you live near Brooklin, I'd come take a look, but would it be a big problem to move the waterlines? If theres an adjoining bathroom or w/p going upstairs you may be able to put in a TEE and go through a wall or something. Not something to wake up to on a Saturday morning at any rate.  Just to add to what Daplumma is saying, not only is it the hot waterpipes that freeze first, but pipes on the NW corner of the house tend to freeze quicker than on other sides of the house. One thing that no-one has mentioned is sediment build up in the wp itself. Do you get good flow when the temps are above freezing? We had a guy call during the summer and the copper pipes were full almost to the point where there was almost zero water going through the pipes. Something to consider. I've only been plumbing now for 4yrs, so I'll never second guess what these other guys are saying. I haven't seen nearly as much...crap   as they have.  As for last nights water test, I went to the store for ten minutes and when I came back both glasses were frozen."
27260,pigeonfisher,2007-01-27 18:02:00,696,"Wall is the South East Wall...could certainly be sediment build up in the pipes.  I need to flush them I think.  I got some small to come over, he is going to help me put some insulation along the back wall.  I also threw a thermometer in there and get the digital reading from the kitchen.  it is cold down there but not to bad."
27117,oldschool,2007-01-27 01:59:00,38,"Another nice option for future cold days, and all days really, is a recirculation loop in the hot water side.  This is a feature that nearly all higher scale homes have as standard.  It is a simple return pipe to the water heater that allows the water to flow freely even while the tap is off.  This reduces the time it takes to get hot water to nearly zero.  With such a system it could also solve the water line freezing in winter with no need to heat a crawl space simply to keep the water flowing.  Normally the hot water line on older homes is placed closest to the outside wall in the thoughts that the hot water flowing through them would assist with resisting freezing of the lines.  In times when the water is used fairly frequently, this is true.  Other times, as you know now, this makes no difference.  The expense to add another line is minimal and the cost to have it circulate is very litte.  It can be done two ways: with a small recirculating pump near the heater, or many times it will work from gravity utlizing the natural tendency of hot water to rise.   Either way, the total cost of installation and use would be less than the cost of buying heaters or using furnace ducting and heating a crawl space.  Every time you turn on the tap for hot water you will have a warm (no pun intended), fuzzy, feeling all over as no wait is needed.  Imagine how much water flows directly to a drain as we all wait for the water to heat.  I am a new poster, long-time reader, and will not now or ever get even close to showing disrespect for anyone.  However, please consider the issue of hot water freezing before cold water.  As a young lad that would occasionally partake of the barley pops, I would enter into challenges with other bar patrons of a similar ilk.  We would allow for anything other than outright violence.  Two of our nights were consumed challenging the 'wive's tale' concerning water freezing.  Our test confirmed that cold water freezed first.  Now please try this before jumping on me.  I was the one that lost.  And it cost me more than you in that I had to anty up for several rounds.  That's a lesson that I learned for a long time.  Subsequently, while in college, I did ask my physics professor about this.  I never did understand his reponse (yeah, I graduated, but not as a physics major) but he said that it is usually true that cold water freezes faster, but at time in certain conditions, it is not true.  So essentially, unless we define parameters more in depth, we are both correct.  The issue of hot water being clearer can be valid.  The fuzziness in ice is essentially bubbles.  Hot water allows for fewer bubbles, therefore, clearer ice.  Of course many other things can come into play, such as, mineral content, and time to freezing, but all of that is a bit over my head.  Please take my comments as to how they are intended, to provide whatever assistance I can with my limited set of knowledge.  I did, at age 50, enter into a university seeking a formal education to match what life has taught me.  I graduate this May with my undergraduate degree in Accounting/Management.  No other work since then than the college classes.  That is and was enough.  It is never too late folks, it is mostly just realizing that we can do pretty much anything given a proper attitude.  By the way, I do love to fish.  Since going to Canada for the first time 10 years ago, I am spoiled.  It is a wonderful country with good people and great fishing.  Thanks,  Roy"
27122,Jigger,2007-01-27 02:18:00,1237,"hey oldschool, nice to have you aboard! We've done this on nights like you're describing and also have tried out this myth. Cold water does freeze first! I wasn't too sure if I was imagining it, so before I posted,I wanted to make sure of this. So I took a glass of cold water and a glass of cold water and put them in the freezer(outside). elapsed time so far...18mins. neither one is frozen yet....will post final results since the experiment is underway."
27124,Daplumma,2007-01-27 02:24:00,1961,"Welcome aboard Oldschool.The system you are talking about,either by natural convection or mechanical means is a simple install on a new constuction setting but is a little tougher in an existing structure.I suspect that hot water lines will freeze faster becuase the minerals in the hot water in the house have ""settled"" in the holding tank and are more pure than the cold water.I'm sure my brother (aplumma) will have the correct explanation for this.I do know that the first lines to freeze up in a house are the hot water lines from almost 30 years of plumbing work.I always like to see a lurker finally post here.Cheers! Joe"
