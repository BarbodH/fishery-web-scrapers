26632,Woodsman,2007-01-25 23:28:00,1286,Presuming safe ice is anyone up to meeting up at Wildwood on Sat.   :worthy: On my way home from work tomorow I will stop at the lake and spud a few holes to check out for safe ice. With this cold weather I suspect it should be good for Sat. Also a good chance to try out my new spud I just finished making(brother-inlaw did the welding) a couple of hours ago. Off the ice by about 2 pm to get ready for the London Swill.  Best Wishes: Rick  Ps: Will post results of the ice check on this thread arround this time or a little earlier tomorow.
26649,Woodsman,2007-01-25 23:54:00,1286,Just straight across. Always seemed to work good in the past with other spuds. It weighs about 15 pounds. It also has plenty of blade so I can regrind & modify if required.  Rick
26665,Canuck2fan,2007-01-26 00:42:00,1444,I don't know about the ice.... The spillway was still wide open on Wednesday all the way to the bridge on the way into St. Mary's and there were lots of open holes over Wildwood in front of the dam too.... The temps are colder last night and tonight though. Be real careful checking.

27017,Woodsman,2007-01-26 22:42:00,1286,"Went out & spuded about a half dozen holes. Not great news. Close to shore started at 3 1/2""-4"". By the time I got to about 60' from shore it was down to 3"". This was along the western shore not far from the highway & would still be in fairly shallow water (6-8'). The ice did fell solid &  did not sag. This area usually has some of the thicker ice. The area's most people fish usually tend to have a little less ice. I'm sure there are some spots that are only 1 1/2""-2"" out there & highly recommend to wait a while yet before going out.  Be Safe: Rick"
