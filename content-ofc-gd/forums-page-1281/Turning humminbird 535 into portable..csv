The portable unit runs off two 6v batteries and that could get expensive draining those 2-3times a week while on the ice. If not I am thinking of just buying the portable eagle 320.  Thanks, Rustic"
26243,Bernie,2007-01-25 00:53:00,3190,A small ATV or Ski-Doo Gel cell battery would work real well.

26249,tedley,2007-01-25 01:04:00,36,"the 2 batteries are hooked together to get 12volts. any 12 volt battery will work eg. car battery( too heavy) motorcyle or garden tractor, computer batteries, cordless drill (12v). I bought a skill cordless drill, has 2 batteries, and charger. I used a pcv pipe collar, drilled and tapped 2 holes, put bolts in to hold wires from fishfinder. Runs all day no problem."

It beats buying a regular unit then spending 70-80 on the portable kit. Then you can go over to BPS and pick up the gel-cell and charger for about $26 (LeBaron's'll cost you about $60 for both).  I read somewhere that you can use a dremel to modify the portable case for the gel-cell. I just bought the Eagle 320 Portable and so far after messing around with it in simulator mode, I like it. The true test will  be when I'm able to get out on the water."
