26971,Greencoachdog,2007-01-26 20:55:00,8163,"That's a pretty snazzy lookin' Tip Up there, I'd be interested to know how they work for my next trip to the Great White Frozen North.  $24 for a fishin' license? That's outrageous! Ours are $9.50, but we're backwards backwoods Rednecks and don't have alot of money like y'all Canadian millionaires do... oh that's right, I don't even buy fishin' licenses anymore..."
27048,Clampet,2007-01-26 23:43:00,1947, There is talk of raising our minimum wage to $10.00/hour cdn. What is the minimum wage your way?
27065,SlowPoke,2007-01-27 00:07:00,2984," Democrats are trying to raise it from $5.xx to $7.xx A lofty goal and will be difficult for businesses... Republicans are crying in thier Martinis, I feel for them. Here's a thought, had Republicans bumped the minimum wage on a regular basis over the last eight years to mirror COL increases, there wouldn't be such an outcry from low wage employers. Who am I kidding.  But I digress...  I'd be willing to pay more for my fishing privlidges if I were certain that the money was going directly back into the MNR.  Wait, what was this topic about? Oh yeah Tip-Ups.... don't they have better methods for catching baitfish? -Brian"
