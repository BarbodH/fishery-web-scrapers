136402,Photoz,2007-11-23 21:58:00,792,"First . . . . .     I hope it's deemed okay to copy a post with some very interesting fish species identification that Will placed on another fishing board? It IS from the Department of Fisheries & Oceans . . . .     a quick quizz to test your knowledge in identifying Ontario baitfish & gamefish. If this is a no-no, then, hopefully a mod will be right on the ball, and ZZZZZZZZZZAP it? Here's the site . . . .      http://fishiqtest.com   P. S.  Did Will ever get back to us on POSITIVELY identifying Rich's Atlantic trout / brown salmon . . . .    or whatever, from a while back. I think the majority vote on it was a brown though?"
136407,irishfield,2007-11-23 22:03:00,26272,"Even Rich decided it was a Brown, even though he was adamant it tasted like salmon, after finding out Atlantics were closed! LOL"
136419,007,2007-11-23 22:56:00,537,Great link.  How well did you do on the test Photoz?  I managed 17 out of 20!  I was amazed I did that well cos I've only been fishing on this side of the pond for a few years and there were quite a few hard ones in there - lesser known species and I can't say I'm that good at remembering what families they belong to either - had a few lucky guesses too.  007
136436,Photoz,2007-11-23 23:24:00,792,I'm TRULY embarrassed . . . . .     13 outta 20 . . . . .     I'm now sitting in the corner with a big 'DUNCE' hat on!
136442,wuchikubo,2007-11-23 23:36:00,1114,"Geez, I averaged only 16/20, took it a few times, best was 20/20. It was fun though."
136630,Photoz,2007-11-24 14:26:00,792,I wonder how many time I gotta try it till I get 100%? This is the type of test (and more) that you should have to write to get a fishing license!
136656,tedley,2007-11-24 16:28:00,36,15  correct now if I can find some of them.
136773,Photoz,2007-11-24 23:31:00,792,Geeze . . .    tried again . . .   different fish . . .    same score!
