136722,Garyv,2007-11-24 21:09:00,547,Lew I like retirement but have worked at many things since doing so.  It occupies your time pays you a reward and gives you something to do during those long winter weeks.  I used to jack cars to and from the auctions while in University many many years ago and it was a lot of fun back then.
136734,Dano,2007-11-24 21:47:00,719,"Good for you Lew, now you can see what those little machines can really do!"
136835,Clampet,2007-11-25 03:06:00,1947,"Way to go Lew.  Hope you have a successfull time of this new opportunity, and that you keep us posted. "
136867,OhioFisherman,2007-11-25 10:38:00,6623,"Congrats Lew! It does get boring not working, and no doubt the extra cash will come in handy."
136930,TJQ,2007-11-25 16:54:00,7806,Thats great for you buddy!!  Keep busy till the spring....
136952,caper,2007-11-25 18:41:00,210,"Good for you, will make the winter months go by a little quicker for you...And you can stop by the old firehall with a new vehicle everyday! Keep em guessing.."
136958,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-25 18:53:00,1351,"ohhh.. i think i know where ya working lew... would you happen to know a mechanic there by the name of david lee or a admin. lady by the name of silvia delgado?  thats great lew, now you can make some extra moola over the winter for some more shopping in the spring.. well.. lets not forget the deals during the off season too!  kevin"
137035,Handlebarz,2007-11-26 01:11:00,3790,Hey Lew did you already put in your two weeks notice that june 7th will be your last day?
137075,mattyk,2007-11-26 10:53:00,2110,congrats Lew and have fun out there!
137105,bigbuck,2007-11-26 14:19:00,2449,"That's great Lew!!! You can occupy yourself during the winter and come soft water again, BYE BYE!! I guess there will be a couple of roadtrips to Dundee Michigan to Cabela's to pick up some odds and ends???"
137108,Squid,2007-11-26 14:26:00,1656,HAHA!! welcome back.
137233,musky_man,2007-11-26 23:29:00,159,"Lew,  Good luck -- hope you enjoy your new-found employment.   Mark"
136398,lew,2007-11-23 21:52:00,12767,"I've been retired for about 7 years now and luv it while I wander around the province fish'n & camping whenever & wherever I want, and even have the approval of my wonderful wife of 41 years, just as long as I phone home once in awhile to let her know where I'm at  The last couple winters though have been pretty boring, so I decided this winter to get my butt back to work till the softwater season re-opens in May  I checked out the local rag last week and found an ad from a  car dealership just down the road looking for a part-time driver to deliver new cars around to different dealerships. I went over and talked to the guy and was hired on the spot, and made my 1st delivery today.  It's gonna be good having something to do during the next few snowy months and a few extra $$$$ in my pocket for fishing toys won't hurt either.  I've just never had a boss before that was 1/2 my age.....dang"
136403,irishfield,2007-11-23 21:59:00,26272,Guess you're not available to hit the bay next week?  What's that...you just quit? Good to hear! LOL
136406,wuchikubo,2007-11-23 22:03:00,1114,"Congrats !?? Lew, just make sure he remembers that you don't have to take the stress of the job, if you don't like it you'll leave.  I've got a few friends in the same situation as you and they enjoy themselves. Sometimes it's harder for the employer to find a good replacement when they have someone with a good work attitude and the skills than to put up with minor mistakes that may happen from time to time.  Take care out there especially at this time of year. (then again who do I think I am when I'm speaking to a person who has seen it all before!)  Stan"
136409,Photoz,2007-11-23 22:06:00,792,
136413,Uncle Buck,2007-11-23 22:39:00,1000,Who's gonna complain about a car to a man that never smiles  good stuff Lew
136416,pikehunter,2007-11-23 22:40:00,1659,Congrats Lew  Now just don't go taking any guff from the young punk eh!  Save up those dollars for some fine  gear. But remember to put aside a couple of bucks for the tax man as he may want a couple of extra coins from you.
136418,misfish,2007-11-23 22:53:00,29133,"Now maybe the rest of us can sleep in a bit and not be on Lew time.HAHAHAHAHA  Nice going Lew. I cant see though,how the winter months are so boring."
136425,Roy,2007-11-23 23:10:00,13728, One of the prerequisites for the job was to be able to deliver to the correct address on the first try. (sorry Steve)   Good on ya Lew.
136429,Joey,2007-11-23 23:17:00,9122,"Good for you Lew, some extra dough and some more conversation to add to the mix with the misses at night is always great  Good luck.  Joey"
136435,Shelley Cooper,2007-11-23 23:23:00,394,Ya.... What Joey said...  Good for you Lew.. Hope you enjoy it...
136438,Photoz,2007-11-23 23:28:00,792,"Roy . . ..    doesn't 'If at first ya don't succeed, try . . .    try again?' apply to mail delivery?"
136446,JohnF,2007-11-23 23:41:00,3494, Let me know if yer gonna be in Stratford some time. I'll buy lunch.  JF
136448,JohnF,2007-11-23 23:42:00,3494, Was Lew ever a mailman?  JF
136475,LeXXington,2007-11-24 00:35:00,1928,"Sounds like a cool gig too me, I hear yea about thoese winter months. My company made me take about 2 months off ""WORK FROM HOME"" unless there was a emergancy through december and January.  I went nuts, never again! I wold rather be a greeter at Walmart than sit at home making up projects to pass the time.  Besides you don't seem like ""Would you like Fries with that"" type of guy.  They still deliver POST? I thought it was a Junk Mail / Bills delivery service."
136487,motv8tr,2007-11-24 00:59:00,2587,"Well, you'll get to see all the new models up close and personal  Enjoy it  Maureen"
136495,Tom McCutcheon,2007-11-24 01:22:00,627,Lew I did that same job with one of the dealers in London for two years after I retired. It was real neat meeting different people all over the province and they even paid me to deliver a new vehicle to Halifax once. All they had to do was pay for the lobster and I would have delivered it for nothing. Good luck and keep the RUBBER SIDE DOWN. Tom
136518,Blake,2007-11-24 02:47:00,418,Congrats on the new job.
136615,aplumma,2007-11-24 13:22:00,6896,Sounds like the perfect job Lew not to many hours and you get to drive alot of different cars. You can go ahead and splurge now and get an ipod and fill it with all of the best drivin songs for the hours on the road.  Art
136625,Smokey,2007-11-24 14:06:00,1278,Congrats on the job Lew. Will be something to help pass the time for you this winter till fishing opens up again in June. Enjoy your time driving.
136627,bassdreamer,2007-11-24 14:09:00,128,"lew good luck with your new job.is it the dealership i met you during the summer,where you get your vehicle fixed?"
136638,lew,2007-11-24 14:54:00,12767,"Thanks folks, it's gonna be strange going back to work but I'm looking forward to it.   Nope, it's actually a Honda dealer bassdreamer, I've gone over to the dark side"
136645,Mike Pike,2007-11-24 15:33:00,1332,Congratulations Lew.  Driving around brand new vehicles all day long sounds like a sweet gig!  Enjoy your new job and the extra 'jingle' in your pockets!  Cheers!
136651,Handlebarz,2007-11-24 15:52:00,3790,Welcome to the dark side Lew now you can test the motors i pick up for them just remember if it runs bad I had nothin to do with it.

136673,bpsbassman,2007-11-24 17:40:00,941,Great News Lew.  I've been thinking about doing the same type of thing when I retire.
