136659,iceguy,2007-11-24 16:32:00,341,I fished on lake St.John A few years back on December 13 on 4 inches of good clear ice but didn't get a sniff from any Pike. I've been on cook's bay before christmas as well. I'm sure the up norther's can beat that.

136698,dwc67,2007-11-24 19:21:00,140," we were spread apart fishing the weeds in about 8 ft of water close to shore. open water could be seen from where we were, i aint that stupid now"
136707,iceguy,2007-11-24 20:17:00,341,"I fished a few times Simcoe where you could see open water. Once on Cook's and once from Big bay point, just have to be careful of the off shore wind."
136713,Muskieman,2007-11-24 20:54:00,2472,"September 26, 1990  Schefferville Quebec..  I once crossed Lake Nipissing on snowmobile on December 2nd ,1992 and with my truck on the 10Th that same year.  It's looking good for an early ice up here ..some of the bays have more than an inch and 90% of the ponds are frozen enough to support a 4 wheeler.. If it keeps up like this I'll be splaking in about 2 weeks ."
136719,Photoz,2007-11-24 21:07:00,792,"December 16, 2003, on 4"" to 6"" of ice, a kilometre out from the end of Airport Road on Cooch! That particular morning it was -16, and my carp-fishin' Brit pal was with me, on the ice for the first time in his life. The ice was REAL noisy, he was walkin' like he was on eggs, literally 'tippy-toeing' his way . . . . .      all of a sudden a loud CR R R R  R   A   C   K!!! A crack ran across right in front of us . . . .     I turned around (he was right behind me) and there he was, froze, dead in his tracks, holding his breath, scared to move . . .  .    I swear he didn't even blink for a full minute!   I convinced him it was safer to hear the ice 'talking' (as my ol' Grandad called it) rather than silent. Once he got the hang of walking on glare ice, he had a ball, enjoyed this outing even more than carping!"

136760,fishindevil,2007-11-24 22:50:00,6254,"it was around the first week in november,it was also on the petawawa river right near the achry road entrance to alqounquin park northeast gate,we went out on the ice about 3inchesof clear ice to see if we could see any trout under the ice,and to mark the edge of a weedbed for ice fishing later on,so we knew where to put the ice-hut !!!!!! and we could see the trout swimming under the ice it was so cool.....it was also a 5 day cold snap....."
