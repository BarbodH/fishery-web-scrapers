136881,Woodsman,2007-11-25 13:20:00,1286,"14 of 20 here. Not likely to try again. I believe the ""quit when your ahead"" theory. Not likely to do any better."
137057,jjcanoe,2007-11-26 03:09:00,744,An honest 18 /20 But I have had most of the bait fish types in an aquaruim at one time or another.  If I had my native species of Ontario book with me I could have cheated!  jjcanoe
137059,007,2007-11-26 03:38:00,537,"Just tried the test again 3 times - scored 17/20, 15/20 and 19/20.  I knew there was a reason for catching all those small fish (chubs, shiners and minnows) during the year!  Taking the test is a good way of learning about a few unusual species.  007"
137070,chickenhawk,2007-11-26 05:47:00,612,Easy 19/20 first try! lol i've studied fish recently in one of my classes
137132,Marko,2007-11-26 16:10:00,854,I don't think i got one minnow right. I rarely use them anyways but still. 11/20
137149,Terry,2007-11-26 17:55:00,14456,"so far I get the first half of the question right every time but the second half who know..it's a shiner, I really don't care about the fine points"
137150,Headhunter,2007-11-26 17:56:00,5703,15/20 here... darn those tiny little buggers! HH
137162,fishing n autograph,2007-11-26 19:05:00,2540,"11/20....ha, half those fish i have never seen before"
136564,Bernie,2007-11-24 04:31:00,3190,Havent seen this posted here before. I came across it surfing around and found it interesting. I apologize if its been on here in the past.  http://fishiqtest.com  I only scored 12 out of 20. I guess it's a passing grade lol .
136567,Hooked,2007-11-24 04:39:00,891,"I sucked, 11/20.  Always had trouble with types of minnows.  But I did get the one right I use almost exclusively!"
136568,Dondorfish,2007-11-24 04:40:00,1000,16 / 20 - guess I could'a done worse!  Don
136570,fishindevil,2007-11-24 04:41:00,6254,"WOW...thats harder than i thought !!!!...everyone should take this,well at least im not totally stupid i got 15/20,thanks for posting!!!! go ahead everyone take it its cool....cheers"
136574,bigfish1965,2007-11-24 04:50:00,3382,Well there is an error on the test..anyone spot it??
136576,Hooked,2007-11-24 04:53:00,891," Was it that red belly minnow one, cuz I didn't see no red belly.  That would change my score tremedously!!  I was robbed."
136577,Bernie,2007-11-24 04:54:00,3190,I didn't Rick. I think the test may be different depending on what you enter to begin.
136580,Badger Shark,2007-11-24 04:57:00,291,"Man I sucked, I couldnt even get passed the postal code question!"
136581,Hooked,2007-11-24 04:58:00,891,  haha
136585,SlowPoke,2007-11-24 05:35:00,2984,12/20 for me but at least I know what a Pickeral isn't!  
136604,brickNblock,2007-11-24 12:14:00,598,"....'Sigh' 11/20.......I don't know nuttin'  Brian, I never got the pickeral question on my test........there must be different tests available. I thought they all looked like minnows sorta....hahaha Loved the Stickleback Q........it just had to be and then the 2nd portion of the same Q asked, Ninespine or threespine........best Q...all you had to do was count the spines....Duh!  Thanks for posting the test.......a nice time waster."
136607,Corey,2007-11-24 12:41:00,355,"I got 11/20. Interesting about all the baitfish. Wonder if that has anything to do with the commercial ban and limit of angler caught baitfish. Maybe they are going to try and educate anglers about catching baitfish, identifying them in an effort not to transport non-native species."
136631,Photoz,2007-11-24 14:28:00,792,At least I got the carp right!
136635,Burtess,2007-11-24 14:43:00,901,        Burt
136649,Bear,2007-11-24 15:43:00,106,14 of 20 ....... this is the second time I did the test ....... the fish/questions were differant this time  First time was 10 of 20
136654,tdotfisherman,2007-11-24 16:25:00,317,10/20.. But what the hell do I know about the little guys?
136676,Anatz,2007-11-24 17:52:00,74,12/20 and I hardly fish O_O.
136684,kickingfrog,2007-11-24 18:10:00,8333,Re. Fish IQ test.  I am not going to take the test. I know I'm smarter then any fish....   and if I'm not I don't want proof.
136686,Nufdawg,2007-11-24 18:30:00,13,"I need to brush up on my knowledge as well, 11 / 20"
136726,dsn,2007-11-24 21:19:00,1018,Yeah that was tough I got 12/20. When I did it the second time I got 10/20. When I did it again the third time I got.. well I'm too embrassed to say. Each test was differnt for sure.   dsn
136727,bowshep,2007-11-24 21:28:00,378,Just like every test 9/20 failed... Peace Ken
136809,Dabluz,2007-11-25 01:33:00,701,"I got 11 out of 20  I can't complain, even perch are rare where I live and fish and using minnows of any kind is illegal."
136821,007,2007-11-25 02:15:00,537,"Photoz posted this the other day and I took the test - got 17/20 first time up, though there were some lucky guesses.  I'm gonna try again soon to see if it was beginner's luck!"
136832,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-25 02:36:00,2585,12/20 i suck but i did get the grass pickeral one right!  Cheers!
