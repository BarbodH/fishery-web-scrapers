136887,ccmtcanada,2007-11-25 13:54:00,7971,"I've only seen them in the 'boats for sale' sections on kijiji.ca and craigslist.org.  Since I'd never heard of them either, I tended to stay away, but they could be nice boats."
136896,superdad,2007-11-25 14:38:00,353,They are a fiberglass boat made in Quebec many years ago.
136898,Roy,2007-11-25 15:16:00,13728,"They're built in a town called St-Jean des Piles (go figure). They were a very popular boat at one time and there are still lots of them around. They're solid and very seaworthy. I don't know what's happening with the company nowadays but there seems to be a lot of canoes coming out of that town.  Edit: They must still be in business. This is their website. http://www.cadorette.ca/index.htm Sorry, French text only."

137056,Canuck,2007-11-26 03:00:00,491,"If you mean Cadorette, they were made in Quebec up to about 1990 then were merged with Thundercraft and Doral.  Not a bad boat, but low end."
