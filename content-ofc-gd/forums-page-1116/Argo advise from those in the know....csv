136558,irishfield,2007-11-24 04:18:00,26272,Thanks Bernie...definitely one of my fears with it. Maybe I should just stick with a long track sled...or grab a high HP scoot.
136688,nofish4me,2007-11-24 18:43:00,404,"Wayne, You live in an area that is enriched with Scoot history. The original Scoots had the notorious problem of killing their operators. I suppose you're not affraid of a spinning prop., except for the fact that you generally sit on the opposite side. There was a book available from the Huronia Museum that is no longer on their website, I can get you the book info if needed. There is alot of people on here that probably don't know what a Scoot is. I'm sending you a picture with an email. You could post it if you'd like. A few years back, there was a feller that lives at the mouth of the Bad River (check that out on a map, they need one) that still builds custom Scoots.  Brian"
136706,irishfield,2007-11-24 20:17:00,26272,"Yep..lots of scoots up here. F-in-law sold his...the bugger... a week before I bought my place in Temagami in '04. Could use it for sure. As in your picture many got injured because they took engine/prop right of an airplane and put the prop facing forward right above the occupants heads. Pusher props are readily available these days so no reason to do that..and like the swamp/air boats you can also cage in the prop to protect the ""challenged"" that walk into spinning props. Props don't scare me, or anyone in our family...because we have GREAT respect for them!  Fangs nephew has a REALLY nice scoot that he uses, from ice in to ice out, to get his kids to the school bus each day on Lake Temagami."
136759,aplumma,2007-11-24 22:48:00,6896,Heres you answer Wayne mini track vehicle I am betting you can build it with out to much problems but hey it is only $1750 and you can be the first kid on the block with it.  Art
136774,Gerritt,2007-11-24 23:31:00,6129,ok i'll bite...  what the heck is a scoot? from the sounds of it a swamp boat idea?... but for our winters??  G.
136775,irishfield,2007-11-24 23:33:00,26272,Basically a boat with an airplane engine on the back Gerritt. Like an airboat in the everglades..but with a hull designed to ride on the snow/ice.  Here's the pic nofish4me sent of a really old one.
136776,irishfield,2007-11-24 23:43:00,26272,"Here's a more modern one. Guess they're really called airboats...just always referred to as Scoots up here...guess because someone once said..""man that thing sure scoots along"" !  lol  "
136778,Bernie,2007-11-24 23:52:00,3190,Id love to have one of those right now. Wouldn't need to wait for thick ice. Hey Wayne. Lets build a couple. Me with the boat building and you with the aircraft? If we get at it we may have them ready by next weekend!
136779,Terry,2007-11-24 23:59:00,14456,old jon boat and an old VW motor and you are good to go
137118,wallyboss,2007-11-26 14:52:00,1095,"There's a guy In Wendover on the Ottawa River that has one of those, but it definitely isn't a VW motor cause you hear him coming from a couple of miles away."
137215,davis,2007-11-26 22:45:00,128,"All I know is you can hear an Argo with tracks coming from miles away!  Every winter we head out to my buddies hunting camp for an ice fishing weekend. Pretty secluded and quiet area. The last year we were out, some dude came out of the forest onto the lake in one of those - for a minute, i thought we were being invaded by the germans!"
137218,irishfield,2007-11-26 23:01:00,26272,LOL... can't be near as bad as a 2 stroke seadoo ripping by your dock at dusk!
137221,glen,2007-11-26 23:09:00,2641,"""Maybe I should just stick with a long track sled""  One thing to remember is that last year the slush was real bad on Simcoe.  I don't know if you had the slush that up north.  But every year may be different.  I hope we don't get the slush this year.  A long track with some power would get on top of soft stuff.  Also my buddy says that the new Argos have more ground clearance and bigger tires."
137246,Sinker,2007-11-27 00:54:00,8692,"I'd take a good long track snow machine over an argo anyday......as long as your talking winter travel only.  You can have  some good fun in the argo all season long, but if your after good reliable winter travel.....ya can't beat a long track with lots of power!  Sinker"
137250,Fisherman,2007-11-27 01:02:00,7201,"Heard from a friend of a friend...there's a fellow in Midland, Brian Dumont(sp) that builds Scoots up there, not as big as the monster in the pic above, more like a 2 seater.  I'm sure as long as somebody tries hard enough, you could hang up an Argo, but drive one like a ""normal"" person wanting to come home at the end of the day... The newer ones do have a couple extra inches clearance with higher tires.  An all rubber track is available from a dealer in QC, apparantly even better floatation on soft stuff than what the Argo tracks do."
136170,irishfield,2007-11-23 03:22:00,26272,"So I know I need a bigger sled for the lake... after last years slush fiasco and luckily having Ron to pull me around 1/2 the lake. Got to thinking about it and thinking maybe an Argo with tracks would be the better way to go and safer way to go to explore ""new"" untracked ice.  How fast will these things go with tracks on them?  If you do go in thru the ice....will they pull themselves out...or is it as I expect and I need to get an anchor into ice and use the winch...that's mounted on the wrong end usually !  What should I be looking for in say a 10 year old machine in way of worn out items?  Way too much money new...even expensive used and don't want to get burned.  Thanks for any input in advance! Wayne  "
136172,Guest skeeter99,2007-11-23 03:29:00,0,"I know they float, have been duck hunting in them  but I am not sure if you did go through the ice if it would get itself out, probably would have to anchor like you said  they do get stuck the same as snowmachines but not as much, seen alot of them stuck on simcoe last year and the sleds just pinned it and when right past  top speed maybe 35 km at least the one my friend had   honestly a snowmachine would be better I think(alot quicker travel) but the argos are comfy with the heater though"
136177,Landlocked,2007-11-23 03:35:00,171,"Hey Wayne, Just some FYI, most insurers exclude marine/amphibious use on ATV's and in particular the Argo....I doubt you're worried about it but thought I'd throw it out there. What you need is a hovercraft"
136179,irishfield,2007-11-23 03:43:00,26272,Thanks Andy and Skeeter.  Andy/anyone...do you know what the regs are on insurance on an Argo.. Do I need it..does it need to be plated for lake use?  I'd get a scoot before I went hovercraft. But they freeze in as well when you park them!
136182,Guest skeeter99,2007-11-23 03:47:00,0,"I looked on canadian sites for used argos  they are not to bad used  a 2000 to 2002 ranges from 5 to 6 grand not bad for what you are getting   my friend does have insurance on his, and if he has insurance on it it must be law not sure (he is a cheap s.o.b.)"
136191,irishfield,2007-11-23 04:22:00,26272,Found their website...claims it will claw it's way back up on the ice.. I'd have to see it to believe it. 
136192,Guest skeeter99,2007-11-23 04:27:00,0,I would have to see it to believe it too  they were in a swamp the machine would get leverage from the bottom of the swamp?  ie. rear track would grip mud and debris  out in 10/20/30/40/50>>>>>>100 ft of water  there is no leverage there LOL!!!
136196,Guest skeeter99,2007-11-23 04:34:00,0,"I think you should get a snowmachine, faster and you can boot around on the trails tooo!!  here are some good ones under 3 grand, really great deals almost pocket change  http://www.trader.ca/Search/Details.asp?mk...;ADS=6532517%7C  http://www.trader.ca/powerpage/details.asp...mp;adid=6583708  http://www.trader.ca/Search/Details.asp?mk...;ADS=6582791%7C   http://www.trader.ca/powerpage/details.asp...mp;adid=6567377"
136198,KyleM,2007-11-23 04:44:00,218,"Wayne, I have looked at a few of them. I know most of my toys quite well (sleds, quads, bikes, boats) but Argos have always been a tad pricey for me.  Anyway, if you had a connection in Alberta theres a good deal on another forum Im on. Not sure if its still 4 sale but I know its cheap.  http://www.outdoorsmenforum.ca/showthread....;highlight=argo"
136207,SlowPoke,2007-11-23 09:47:00,2984,"Wayne, give Greg a call - he uses them for ice charters and would probably be happy to give you the good/bad and ugly on them. Keep in mind Argo is one of his sponsers.  http://www.profishntanglingservices.com/#C...t%20Information"
136211,verno,2007-11-23 10:16:00,178,"My inlaws have one and they have tracks for it.  They go just about everywhere, and they travel reasonably quick.  I learned the hard way that they dont always come out if you break through the ice.  It kind of depends how it goes in.  If just the front goes through you can usually back out.  But if you go right through and are floating it's pretty tough to get out without someone pulling you on a sled. And if you get one like you have picture above, and you fold the window down, don't lean on it when you are getting out.  The crack, then spiderweb and your father in law gets REALLY ticked.  I learned that the hard way too."
136218,Spiel,2007-11-23 10:54:00,9065,....I thought this was going to be about football of which I also no nothing.
136222,Terry,2007-11-23 11:24:00,14456,they are slow you feel every bump  but they are the last vehicle to get stuck  this is a good choice   
136229,solopaddler,2007-11-23 12:50:00,8605,"Wayne, just bite the bullet and get one of these babies:  http://www.snobearind.com/"
136232,ccmtcanada,2007-11-23 13:04:00,7971, Wow...I just might take up ice fishing if I had that thing!!! LOL.....that's pretty sweet.
136237,Fisherman,2007-11-23 13:10:00,7201,"Top speed is about 35km/h on tires, it's drops to about 25 with tracks. If you get the tracks, I would go with the wider Super track kit with ice cleats for real deep snow.  As for maintenance, the newer ones, (2000+) are better, no more shear pins to replace, they have splined axle shafts that go on the sprockets.  I just replaced one set of bearings on one of the axles, not a hard job, if you build planes you're mechanically inclined enough to fix these machines."
136253,spooner_jr,2007-11-23 14:28:00,193,An argo is treated the same as any motorized vehicle in Ontario; if you want to operate it anywhere other than private property you need to carry liability insurance on it.  Price would be similar to an ATV of the same value.
136255,Seaweed,2007-11-23 14:31:00,135,Gregg Klatt - Simcoe Guide  He uses Argos and is a friendly enough dude for sure.  Drop him a line and he will give you the ins and outs of Argos.  He goes to some pretty deep spots with his.
136257,irishfield,2007-11-23 14:35:00,26272,"Thanks guys! Much appreciated. Hard to justify any expense when it comes right down to it...as I only make 2 or 3 trips North each winter...but I rather not go thru what I have been again with my ""big"" Yamaha 250 Bravo out on the ice the last couple of years. It's fine for the few times I use a sled around here in the snow. I have no interest in humping the trails...I just want something safe to run the lake with when at the cabin to check on it and ice fish in the winter with the lads.  Terry...have seen those tracks. They have a used set in Alliston for about $2000 and I could put them on my Yamaha Big Bear I presume."
136262,Terry,2007-11-23 15:03:00,14456,the atv needs to be at lest a 400 cc and 4x4
136303,Tybo,2007-11-23 17:22:00,1373,Couple of Friends use to have them. Both said they like to wear the axle seals.
136527,John Bacon,2007-11-24 03:26:00,3277, Your friends like to wear axle seals from Argo's?   Some people are strange.
136546,Clampet,2007-11-24 03:52:00,1947,"An an Argo can go on the frozen lake until there's about a foot of snow, give or take depending on how wet it is.  Snow drifts will cause many argos to bog down.  More than once I witnessed riders having to jump off and push.  The upside is, an argo is more versatile than a snowmobile/sled, allowing one to go moose, deer, and bird hunting.  Also can be used to hunt ducks."
136551,irishfield,2007-11-24 04:01:00,26272,Stuck with tracks on it Paul...or are you talking just tires? I'd never think of heading out into snow with tires only.
136554,Bernie,2007-11-24 04:09:00,3190,Wayne. The limitation with just about any tracked vehicle like the Argo is the belly pan. Ground clearance is the key here. If there is more weight of the vehicle supported by the pan than the tracks you are stuck. Slush is the big enemy. God help you if you get one of these stuck in slush.
