136817,Beans,2007-11-25 02:04:00,3339,"I quit watching after Don Cherry's Coaches Corner...  Switched over to Boston PBS featuring The Three Tenors...Great music to listen to while surfing the ""net..."
136818,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-25 02:07:00,1351,i've lost all hope in the leafs...
136819,holdfast,2007-11-25 02:09:00,1813,"Yea I hear ya.  Ex well almost Mtl fan here.  Our Teams are probably in the weakest division going.  I dont care if MTL with the likes of Oh so many europeans keep them in the standings.  But I know Dang well,  The Stanely Cup winner this year will have Young, Tough, Players, with a  Tough Captain.  So I rule out Leafs. Yea Ottawa, And The Mtl Europeans."
136822,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-25 02:20:00,2585,next year will be our year lol  Cheers!
136830,glen,2007-11-25 02:33:00,2641,But they just had a good game against Ottawa.  Guess that was it for the season.
136838,Tacklebuster,2007-11-25 03:16:00,303,"Yor make a good point.   Leaf fans have to spend more money.........for tickets............Leaf TV (what a joke, the insult of all insults), and show more support for The Teachers Pension fund."
136846,ecxstriper,2007-11-25 03:54:00,343,I just love  that the Leaf can still beat the  Rangers ( did I ever mention I hate the rangers)
136854,ilario11,2007-11-25 04:49:00,41,"long suffering leaf fan here...  i have almost lost all interest in this team..  this franchise is a joke  I've said once, i';l say it again, untill larry T and the condo boyz at MLSE relinquih control of the team, this franchsie will continue to flounder...   trade any commodidty over 28 (except keberle) if you can  tucker and sundin are your only two valuable  over 30 commidities (other thean Kaberle)  how could you sign kunina and mc clutz for $12 mil????  how could you trade for two lousy goalies within 10 mnths...to top` it off, JFJsign vesa for anoth 3 year?? why? let him prove himself..  JFJ is an absolute idiot, but the bigger idiots are the morons execs who hired an inexpereinced, unproven GM  This team should be sold to Mike Illitch or Lou Lam !"
136857,KyleM,2007-11-25 04:57:00,218,LETS GO BRUINS!
136878,Rizzo,2007-11-25 12:56:00,4754,"I know in the past few years Phoenix has been absolutely brutal, after seeing that score (notice I didn't say ""seeing that game"")I have to hope they have had a major turn-around and are a legit contender this year...someone please tell me Phoenix is a good team"
136880,lookinforwalleye,2007-11-25 13:14:00,4399,"Wasn`t it Paul Maurice that said at the beginning of the year that this was the best collection of talent that he has ever had?  Looks to me that Maurice might have lost the dressing room,his players are sure not responding to his style of coaching. Eighty six goals against by far the worst in the league and only 3 or 4 points away from being the worst team in the league.  Look on the bright side.... you have  McCabe for 3 more years @ 5.75 million Kubina for 2 more years @ 5.0 million Blake for 4 more years @ 4.0 million  The above 3 should be enough to get any GM fired!!! now throw in....  Toskala for another 2 years @ 4.0 million Tucker for 3 more years @ 3 million Bell for another year @ 2.16 million 4th highest paid forward on the team by the way, great signing, what a stiff this guy is. Raycroft for another year @ 2 million."
136904,jediangler,2007-11-25 15:43:00,1923,"And the ACC will be sold out every game anyway, so why would anything change?"
136946,Dano,2007-11-25 18:08:00,719," You out lasted me, thats for sure!"
136949,brickNblock,2007-11-25 18:25:00,598," I hear ya on the 'LEAF'S TV'..... Let the only child left in the house and my wife have any selection of TV (Satelite) packages they wanted....I only picked 2 for myself.... WorldFishingNetwork...........  ......'cept......'Go Shelley, Go Shelley,,,,,,' and LEAFS TV..... before the season started it was great....But first couple of games into the season I found myself watching this stupid station waiting for the game.......Well they dont televise it till after the game is over and then you get to watch them lose the same game maybe 6 times over the next 48hrs............I'm cancelling it Monday morning.  Media has ideas for GM as perhaps Ronnny Francis, The Moose, Healey or ????????? I dunno........Id give Francis a look see"
136964,lookinforwalleye,2007-11-25 19:12:00,4399, Three more candidates with no experience...Let them go learn some where else.
137111,Squid,2007-11-26 14:32:00,1656,HAHAHAHAHA GO  HABS GO!!
137133,Kirk,2007-11-26 16:14:00,347,"Where's all the leaf fans gone since the Sens shellacking a few days ago?  They'll be back, its a long season and the playoffs are the only thing that really counts.  Ask the sens how important regular season performance is (you get the Presidents aka 'I don't know what its called' Cup)...Leafs make the playoffs and its a whole new world."
137230,camillj,2007-11-26 23:25:00,1988,GO LEAFS GO !!!!!! ... we may be down .. but we're not out .... I have to admit it was painful to watch the other night .... but for all the whining and complaining we still manage to beat some pretty good teams.... and nobody is on top all of the time ...   I have been a LEAFS FAN all my life and dont intend to stop just cause theyre not winning today .... guess I'm just not a fairweather fan ... kinda like fishermen who only get keen when everybody else is catchin fish .... means very little to me... I say switch baits and keep casting ...
137239,lookinforwalleye,2007-11-27 00:17:00,4399,  Good for you for not jumping off the bandwagon during a little dry spell (40 years)!  Sorry I could not resist.LOL
