137253,Fisherman,2007-11-27 01:09:00,7201,"Took a look, couldn't find anything newer than this, will have to ask at the local shop I guess.  Commercial Bait Fish Harvest and Transfers  In early January 2007, the ministry announced measures to control the harvest and transport of live bait used by anglers while ice fishing across Ontario. Commercial bait licences were issued with conditions to reflect these controls.  On March 29, 2007 the Minister announced that these measures will be modified in response to new information about the distribution of the virus, and to allow bait harvesters and dealers in the virus-positive zone to resume limited operation.  Transport of live commercial bait fish harvested in the VHS Management Zone out of the VHS Management Zone is prohibited."
