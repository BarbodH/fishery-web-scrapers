137051,ccmtcanada,2007-11-26 02:37:00,7971,"You can try the Magic Eraser first on it...we have small kids here all the time and that's the only thing we've found that works....I'm assuming it's marks on painted drywall?  This is what it looks like and is available almost everywhere (grocery stores, Canadian Tire, anywhere that sells household cleaners).  "
137053,fishing n autograph,2007-11-26 02:47:00,2540,is that good for  matte paint? I know it works for glossy paint
137055,ccmtcanada,2007-11-26 02:50:00,7971, We've used it on both....but check it in an inconspicuous spot first just to make sure.  We've only tried it on lighter colour paint....not sure if it'll fade darker colours or not.  If the spots are small then I would think it shouldn't be too much of a problem.
137069,ecxstriper,2007-11-26 05:08:00,343,what are the marks from ? if CCMT's idea doesn't work you will have to repaint with stain kill primer
137100,Fish Farmer,2007-11-26 13:40:00,2234,"You say black marks, not seeing, it's not mold is it?"
137114,taper,2007-11-26 14:39:00,611,The other thing I have seen is shaded black marks that can almost look like shadows. They can be caused from poor vapour barrier and will show over the stud faces and screws.
137126,fishing n autograph,2007-11-26 15:40:00,2540,"sorry for being unclear guys. It's not mold, they're scuff marks from literally touching the walls lol...moving furnature, and now i'm noticing that if my leather jacket touches the wall it'll leave scuff marks"
137135,Kirk,2007-11-26 16:21:00,347,"get a painter with good plaster skills...they patch and paint as they go and it all looks new at the end...our drywall looked like the buildings in Beirut Lebanon with skuffs, marks and chips from tonka trucks and other toys.  (if you stood back the line of holes and marks looked like we were attacked by a three foot tall machine gunner LOL)"
137148,Terry,2007-11-26 17:53:00,14456,"GOD, it's mold burn the house and start over   or it's scuff marks  remove them and get a better type of paint"
137156,Sandbag,2007-11-26 18:36:00,533,"Matte paint is pretty hard to stay on top of for scuff marks.  It may be worth your while to repaint using an eggshell finish at the very least if it is a high traffic area like a hallway or something.  I've found the magic erasers work to get rid of the scuffs, however they tend to leave a bit of a haze where they were used.  At least on darker colors they seem to.  Cheers  Craig"
137158,Headhunter,2007-11-26 18:47:00,5703,"RE: Magic Erasers.... don't let your kids near them! They release toxins that will really harm a child's skin, cause burns... never let kids use this product! HH"
137160,fishing n autograph,2007-11-26 18:59:00,2540,  good to know
137163,ccmtcanada,2007-11-26 19:05:00,7971," This is an urban legend as noted in this link.....  http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/eraser.asp  The product contains no toxins....it's in fact abrasive. and that's what caused the 'burns' on their skin...the same as if they rubbed sandpaper or steel wool on themselves.  Here's a website of the lady who's kid was 'burned'....if you read through it, the story was blown way out of proportion.  http://kerflop.com/2006/11/02/chemical-burn/"
137228,camillj,2007-11-26 23:20:00,1988,for 99cents you can get a can of comet .... that and a damp J-cloth will literally wipe away your scuffs ... dont be to harsh with it though so that you dont scour the paint right off your walls .... let me know how it works  J.
137304,HTHM,2007-11-27 03:39:00,4082,However for $2.99 you can buy a roll of duct tape. There is no child discipline challange that can't be solved with duct tape. That'll stop the marks on the walls.
