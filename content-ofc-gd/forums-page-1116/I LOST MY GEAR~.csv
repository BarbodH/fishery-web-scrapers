All that work gone! Oh well!"
137402,Greencoachdog,2007-11-27 14:03:00,8163,You'll probably find it underneath or behind something next Fall...
137409,LeXXington,2007-11-27 14:19:00,1928,My thoughts are you will find it after you replace all of it.. not one second before
137420,douG,2007-11-27 14:40:00,2693,"I found a tray with a bunch o flies along with some roebags, sinkers, hooks, etc.  Since I don't fish with flies, if you need em, you can have em.  These don't look like minnow patterns to me tho.  Pm if you wish."
