137141,Alumacraft,2007-11-26 16:42:00,139,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I just heard from a buddy who was at Queenston this morning and he told me that there was only about one foot of visiblilty. He did not hook up or see anyone else hook up.The whole river is dirty he drove up the parkway and looked down at the power plants, the water coming down the river was the same as what was coming out of the power plants. Those damn south west winds Saturday messed it up.I have another friend who is guiding on the upper today for musky, I'll probably get an email later today from him on the results of the days fishing and a water clarity report.If I get an update on the visiblity I'll post it, but it wont be till after work tonite.
