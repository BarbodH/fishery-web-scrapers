137103,Zamboni,2007-11-26 14:15:00,235,"Haven't seen anything but fishing maps north of Kawarthas, PM's you links to some you may want.  Do Ontario chips sold by Garmen/Lawrence for GPS units have lakes charts other than what those offered by Canadian Gov't? Always wondered if those companies took 'soundings' and made charts for smaller lakes or just gave you the general lake outline for lakes without official paper charts?"
137106,Roy,2007-11-26 14:23:00,13728,"Aside from the navigable waters found on the regular Navionics chips, the Hotmaps (Navionics) for Canada contain 80 or so Ontario lakes.

137117,Terry,2007-11-26 14:47:00,14456,"I can't find a detailed list of what is on the Navionics 14XG chip it states the Trent Severn Waterway, so Balsam, BOQ  and others would be on it, I would think, I see they are also on the the Hotmaps but with out a clear list it is hard to decide which one to buy, I need simcoe so I guess 14xg is the way to go"
