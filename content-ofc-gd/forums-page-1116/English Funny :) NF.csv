""I know"" says Paddy, ""but we've no money for a cab and we've missed the last bus home.""  ""We'll steal a bus from the depot"" said Mick .  They arrive at the bus depot and Mick tells Paddy to go in and get a bus while he keeps a lookout. After shuffling around for ages Mick shouts ""Paddy, what you doing? Have you not found one yet? ""  Paddy shouts back , ""Can't find a No: 9."" ""Oh Jeysus Christ, ya thick twit â€“ take the No: 14 and we'll walk from  the roundabout.""      ..................................................................       Moose Hunting  Two Irish hunters got a pilot to fly them to Canada to hunt moose. They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose.  The two lads objected strongly. ""Last year we shot six. The pilot let  us take them all and he had the same plane as yours."" Reluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. However, even on full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down.  Somehow, surrounded by the moose bodies, Paddy and Mick survived the crash. After climbing out of the wreckage, Paddy asked Mick, ""Any idea where we  are?"" Mick replied, ""I think we're pretty close to where we crashed last  year."""
