136885,pikehunter,2007-11-25 13:36:00,1659,If asked to pull over to claim your purchases expect to pay at least both taxes. If the item was imported into the States from a foreign land (China) expect to pay duty. If it was made in the States or perhaps Canada then there will not be any duty.  There is probably a government website regarding duties and exemptions if you Google it.  Have a good trip to the land of cheap.  Maybe try this for some answers
