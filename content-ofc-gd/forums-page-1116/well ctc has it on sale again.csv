136831,ccmtcanada,2007-11-25 02:34:00,7971,These power/booster packs are a great idea!  I decided against this and went for the nautilus deep cycle.  The booster pack you mention only has 33AH compared to 103AH for the $119.99 deep cycle.  I'd use it as an emergency backup for my main battery though!!
136899,Rich,2007-11-25 15:30:00,3927,Going to pick mine up this week. Great little item to have kicking around.
136905,irishfield,2007-11-25 15:50:00,26272,"This one keeps it's charge well..as well. I have one I leave at the lake all year. So it sits in it's spot at what ever the temp is outside, all winter, and when I arrive in the spring I plug it in to top it up and it's still pretty much fully charged.  You'll find the nav lights are a novelty pretty much...but they will get you out of a bind if you have someone strong enough to hold that sucker up while you blast down the lake. The white light should have been put on the opposite side of the red/green..so you still need to hold a mag light up or something at the back of the boat to be (semi) legal."
136916,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-25 16:18:00,1351," HAHAHHA....yeah.. the nav lights are pretty much garbage.. unless your front deck is high enough the air compressor has only so much power... the compass seemed to work fine the 12v cigarette lighter is nice to have for anything.. the power meter is nice to have too.... it has a ac adapter to charge it with, so for people that don't have the battery charger, this is would be great...  but its a tad bulky...  overall still a good item!"
137021,nautifish,2007-11-26 00:09:00,1416,I have one use it all the time for the trolling motor on the tinny and i love it. Had mine allmost two yrs now and still works great. Never had any problems with it.
137087,Spiel,2007-11-26 12:41:00,9065,....Perhaps Santa will leave one under the Christmas tree for me?
137097,Fish Farmer,2007-11-26 13:34:00,2234," Catch a Big Bow and you mite win one I know, Smart ass right."
137127,Spiel,2007-11-26 15:42:00,9065," ....Oh sure, I'd have to get out on the water to do that!"
