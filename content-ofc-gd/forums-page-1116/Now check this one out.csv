137291,nautifish,2007-11-27 03:09:00,1416,Well they do say the crows are very smart. We used to visit a place regulary back in germany tienharm  which was like a small zoo they had a crow there that would actually sit and talk to you  in both english and german....lol.....  But what amazed me with that video footage was the not so much dropping the nuts in the traffic but the fact they were doing it on the pedestrain crossing. Now that is amazeing.
