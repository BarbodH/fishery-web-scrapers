136740,TJQ,2007-11-24 22:04:00,7806,"Monique and I decided to spend one last weekend at camp... got a babysitter for the kids and off we went...  got up here to about three inches of snow which makes 4 wheeling a little toughr hills are slick...  It went to -15 last nite.... it was cool in the tent, but so long as someone got up ever couple of hours and put wood in the fire we were fine... (note to self... insall oil stove...)  when we got here... there was little ice on the river... this morning it was just about froze accross.  heres some pics...   I'm gonna whip her ass at crib.. then backgammon.. then were gonna watch some movies...     The view at 5 oclock..      We brought up a cheap microwave and hot plate so we could keep all the cooking inside..    Getting waters a bit of a challange..   "
