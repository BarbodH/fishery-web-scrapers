137164,fishnpro,2007-11-26 19:10:00,93,Hey steve nice fish! where did you get those if you dont mind me asking? I also go to fleming and am a 2nd yr F&W student. We`ve been hitting the eastern tribs with great success but I want to try somewhere new. Also people tend to get mad a gill hold shots so you might just  wanna let your buddy know before taking a pic next time. Great report and good luck!
137167,steverowbotham,2007-11-26 19:19:00,1800,"if ppl read our other posts, they would see that we very rarely gill hold fish, so flame all u want, im not worried about it.  They are held by the gill plate, not the gill rakers, the fish will be fine."
137255,solopaddler,2007-11-27 01:14:00,8605,"Awesome Steve, nicely done!"
136783,steverowbotham,2007-11-25 00:30:00,1800,"Well, its about time, I finally got out for some chrome !!!  Water had some tinge, but still good vis.  Chromers were eating up the roe bags, all dime sized, colour didnt matter.                    Hope u enjoyed"

136827,007,2007-11-25 02:23:00,537,Beautiful fish and pics.  Thanks for sharing what looked like a fantastic day's fishing.  007
136829,Tacklebuster,2007-11-25 02:30:00,303,I amazed you even found some open water.  The past couple of days the ice on the trib I frequent has been so thick I had a tough time breaking through it.  I could see them through the ice but that was about it.  Nice fish by the way.  I look forward to some rain or warmer weather to clear away some of that ice.
136836,fishindevil,2007-11-25 03:14:00,6254,Nice fall steel for sure !!!!.  ..great pics as well...
136839,douG,2007-11-25 03:19:00,2693,"There is a market for pictures like those, just beautiful.  Composition, balance, exposure, they're all there.  Wrap 1000 words of text around those shots, you gots yerslef a treat.  Good luck!"

137084,Milty,2007-11-26 12:31:00,121,"Nice work,...great report,..you really should tell your buddy though unless he is keeping those fish to stay away from the gills while holding them.  Cheers!!!"
