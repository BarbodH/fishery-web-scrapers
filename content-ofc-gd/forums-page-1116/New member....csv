136320,Love2Hunt,2007-11-23 18:40:00,2,"Signed up a few days ago,  I now have time to write up an intro  A little bit of myself, I'm 38 yrs old. Married and a 2.5 yrs old son. Moved to the GTA in 94. Hometown: Sudbury, born and raised  Currently living in Mississauga..  While growing up, did lots of fishing, from Salmon, Pike, Musky, Pickeral, Bass. Once became of age, started hunting with my Father.  regular stuff, grouse, rabitt..ducks. I was never able to go hunting with him and learn the hunt for either Moose, deer, caribou, Elk,,ect. I have the equipment: Bow and Shotgun, Rifle soon  Since 94, I've been looking for places to hunt with no success, either I get, ""Get lost"" or ""Slamming the door"", the most polite let down was ""sorry"" Been looking for places to hunt since then...  Signed up a few years ago for Wild Turkey, can't wait to give that a try.   So currenttly, I'm looking for a hunting/fishing partner. Hopefully leads to a friendship..  Later on, my goal is to get my son involved in hunting/fishing in all game...  "
