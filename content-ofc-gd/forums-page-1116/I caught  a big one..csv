The moose are rutting right now and very agitated. He was thrashing around and got his antlers stuck in the cables. When the men (miles away) began pulling the lines up with their big equipment, the moose went up with them. They noticed excess tension in the lines and went searching for the problem. He was still alive when they lowered him to the ground. He was a huge 60 inch bull and slightly peeved!'  As they say in Canada ~ 'Is there a Moose in your Hoose' !!  Some one had to make  it Canadain , eh, "

136286,Tacklebuster,2007-11-23 16:18:00,303,what an unbelievable story.  I wonder if that has ever happened before.
136304,PAZE,2007-11-23 18:05:00,132,"This story has been around for a few years now, Its was have suppose to happen, but I find it very hard to beleive"
136305,Roy,2007-11-23 18:21:00,13728,"It did happen one other time in 2002 but it was a rabbit. They didn't bother getting him down cause they found that the entire city of Fairbanks was getting better TV reception if they left the rabbit ears up,"
