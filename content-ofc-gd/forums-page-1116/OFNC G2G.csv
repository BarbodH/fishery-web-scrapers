131078,HTHM,2007-11-07 17:57:00,4082,"I am in for a Saturday, however I am boatless. Clueless too, but that is another story."
131082,wuchikubo,2007-11-07 18:11:00,1114,"A Sunday vote here, as I work Saturdays. I'd make the trip if someone has room on their boat, of course I'll share the expenses too."
131333,jjcanoe,2007-11-08 03:49:00,744, That's what I would call great conservation technique!  jjcanoe
131458,SHAD,2007-11-08 14:36:00,134,Could possibly be in and may have a seat open.  I'll check monitor this thread for a confirmed date on this.
137464,Squid,2007-11-27 18:14:00,1656,Ok this G2G has been pinned at the top of the general discussion board.
130509,Squid,2007-11-06 15:55:00,1656,"Is there any interest in putting together a G2G   on the upper Niagara this December?? dates available are the 1st, 8th and closing, the 15th. The restaurant on the parkway near netherby road has opened with new management and we could meet there after the day is done. We have always had a great time in the past and I would love to get folks together for on last kick at the Muskie bucket before the season closes. There is also excellent rainbow fishing on the upper.  Pete  "
130517,irishfield,2007-11-06 16:15:00,26272,Are there any fish in the upper Niagara.... member formerly known as Squid.... Peter? lol
130518,Squid,2007-11-06 16:16:00,1656,"Yes there are Wayne, just hard to find. Playing with my settings, cool that you can change your dsiplay name."
130529,irishfield,2007-11-06 16:28:00,26272,Have to see how much work I get done around here in the next few weeks and what the weathers doin. Good luck THIS weekend...
130531,Joey,2007-11-06 16:29:00,9122,"We'd probably be interested again this year Pete.  We'll see what date as the time gets closer.  Cheers,  Joey"
130535,Squid,2007-11-06 16:30:00,1656,"Ok Joey, thanks Wayne."
130538,Fishmaster,2007-11-06 16:39:00,920,I might join in on this ..depends on how the new move goes ..
130541,Squid,2007-11-06 16:56:00,1656,Good luck with the move FM.
130551,lew,2007-11-06 17:16:00,12767,"This is always a good day for anyone who's interested in joining us.  We all meet up on the Niagara Parkway in the morning, then spend the day on the water and as Pete said, we'll all head to the restaurant at the end of the day for supper & fish'n tales.  Great way to close out the season.  It get's pretty chilly some years, so If your coming, dress well for the day."
130585,Whopper,2007-11-06 18:03:00,2174,I'd luv too.......but you know.......

130600,John,2007-11-06 18:26:00,2956,"Hey Peter, if anyone has any room, I would love to go and share expenses.  John..."
130603,Squid,2007-11-06 18:29:00,1656,"I' see what I can do John, stay tuned."
130605,John,2007-11-06 18:31:00,2956,Hey this is cool.........
130609,Squid,2007-11-06 18:34:00,1656,Wha???
130617,John,2007-11-06 18:37:00,2956,Wha? Wha?
130619,mattyk,2007-11-06 18:40:00,2110,"i wish i could, if it wasnt a 9 hour drive i would be there."
130620,Squid,2007-11-06 18:41:00,1656,Love to see you there Matt.
130673,fishindevil,2007-11-06 20:09:00,6254,"Ithink i might be interested,it would depend on th weather,but sounds like fun i remember you guys all did it last year!!!! hows the walleye fish above the falls anyway????"
130708,Rizzo,2007-11-06 21:10:00,4754,"best part is, out of all the years we've done this, I don't think a single musky has been caught by anyone.  Someone will be a hero one of these times."
130715,Uncle Buck,2007-11-06 21:27:00,1000," someone belly snagged a rainbow a couple of years ago, but you're right, no musky has been raised by an OFNer yet...  I'm interested if someone has room aboard... and if i'm not working... Sundays are better for me...  Lew, i believe the restaurant closed..."
130718,Pigeontroller,2007-11-06 21:29:00,2793,I would probably be in...
130724,lew,2007-11-06 21:37:00,12767," Yes it did Goran, but evidentely it's open again under a new owner.  Hope it's as good as before, their burgers & fries were worth the trip themselves"
130782,fishdawg,2007-11-06 23:00:00,912,I too would possibly be able to make it - 20 minutes from home for me...   Saturdays are usually better for me...
130938,Rizzo,2007-11-07 05:01:00,4754,another saturday vote
