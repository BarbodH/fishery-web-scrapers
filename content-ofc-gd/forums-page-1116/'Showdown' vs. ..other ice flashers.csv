136937,brkygetr,2007-11-25 17:44:00,425,Hey i have also been looking into getting a Vex but got to researching these 'new' systems called 'Showdown'. Anyone used them or heard about them....they are quite a bit cheaper ($250) and seem somewhat easier to get use to??? They are made by Naturevision (same company that makes Aqua-veiw). Any info or thoughts guys and gals???????  Thanks Brkygetr
136939,Dondorfish,2007-11-25 17:50:00,1000,Never heard of them - got a link?    Don
136940,brkygetr,2007-11-25 17:54:00,425,try this.....  http://www.naturevisioninc.com/shop_nvi/pr...p?productid=229  If that doesn't work just google 'showdown fishfinder'  Brkygetr
136942,Dondorfish,2007-11-25 17:57:00,1000,Hmmmm............. that looks kinda interesting!   Don

136980,Terry,2007-11-25 21:00:00,14456,I see no reason to buy one it's  basically a LCD fishfinder with no history
136984,wallyboss,2007-11-25 21:40:00,1095,It's been out for a couple of year. last year it was called the VPG I think. some people like it more than a flasher. For me nothing will replace my Vex.
