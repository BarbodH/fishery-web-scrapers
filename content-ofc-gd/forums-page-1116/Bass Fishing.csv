136917,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-25 16:20:00,1351,"i would like to head out too, but with the forecast calling for 10-35km/hr winds.. might be a bit much for me... the 10k winds might be okay.. but i cant go on those days ... or it'll be raining which will make the ramps hell..  good luck smalliefisher, kevin"
136919,mbac31,2007-11-25 16:26:00,904,"Yeah I forgot about the ramps, guess I better go buy some salt to put on the concrete. Is there any easier ramps I should be going to. I'm planning on going on friday of this week, hopefully it will be ok. Either way I will be going."
136923,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-25 16:30:00,1351,"i launch at two places and they are over in keswick.. one is harry's and the other is some other marina down the street.. if you know of some better ramps, let me know! perhaps over in the barrie area? maybe they got some nice smallier in the bay... and hopefully it'll be more protected from the waves over there...  kevin"
136926,SlowPoke,2007-11-25 16:36:00,2984,This time of year all those crappy free ramps we swear we'll never use again might be your best bet provided the ground has some firmness to it. Might be a little early for that yet. -Brian
