132258,irishfield,2007-11-10 23:46:00,26272,I think there's just enough docks there for an OFC get together! LOL
132315,pikehunter,2007-11-11 03:55:00,1659,"   I missed something. Did Steve buy Manns Marina?  BTW Wayne, the docks are no longer there only the steel posts are, so he has his work cut out.  I'm surprised my brother's son-in-law didn't buy it, he's bought up a lot of good properties in Dunnville. If you did buy the place you beat him to it, congratulations!"
132317,Corey,2007-11-11 04:02:00,355,Awesome! does this mean I don't have to drag all my crap from the gate now? I can just drive right on through? Free boat launching for OFC members?
