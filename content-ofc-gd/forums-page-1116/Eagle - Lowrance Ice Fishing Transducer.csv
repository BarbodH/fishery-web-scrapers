136894,seansmith_smith,2007-11-25 14:34:00,32,"Im looking to use my Eagle Cuda 168 for ice fishing, and have asked around about what to do for the transducer.  A few people have told me to mount my skimmer transducer on a hockey stick or something like that to mount it in the hole, but i'm looking for something with a little less hassle.  The Lowrance website has a transducer described as ""Portable-mount, 20 degree ice fishing type (200 kHz)"".  wondering if anyone has used this product or something simialr and what they thought about it.  thanks Smitty"
136922,JorgeCarlos,2007-11-25 16:29:00,109,Smitty i use a pice of foam with a hole in the middle for the transducer.

137068,dwc67,2007-11-26 05:06:00,140,pipe insulation works well 
137090,Sinker,2007-11-26 13:15:00,8692,"A chunk of pool noodle duck taped to the cable just above the transducer works well too. I don't have a pic, but that's what I do with mine. Just slit the noodle, and put your cable in the slit, this floats the transducer in the hole.  The hockey stick works just fine too............  If its a portable transducer already, with the suction cup, 2 pieces of plexi glass hinged together are a good way to do it too. Just make one piece of plexi big enough for the suction cup, and the other end long enough that you can pile some snow on it to keep it out of the hole......works pretty good too.  Sinker"
137092,wallyboss,2007-11-26 13:20:00,1095,Just make sure that your transducer is horizontal !!!!
