Will be launching from the keswick side most likely, since it's close for me.. I was thinking of launching from harry's or going to bonnie's? but how are the conditions? I havent been there since the summer.. so is the water level low? how is the launch at bonnie's like? is it a good concrete launch? and what is the cost? i heard its like $20 + $20 parking???!?!  We'll be in seach of some football smallies...if you guys got any tips.. especially around what area.. please pm me! i've never fished there for smallies but i know there are some to be had for sure...   i promise to post a report if we get anything, with lots of pics!!  thanks kevin"

137101,cranks bait,2007-11-26 13:45:00,721,"Hey Kev,  Can't help you much in the area you want to fish.  I got out yesterday (for my last smally fish for the season) and noticed the river is up about 6 inches from last week, hopefully it will be the same for you.  I managed to catch 5 nice smallies in about an hour and a half.  I was using a 1/4 oz. weighted hook with a green/ gold speckled 3"" tube.  I was fishing 10 to 20 feet of water.  The location I went to was the same place I fished in the spring for them.  Had to stop because my bildge pump burnt a hole in itself.   Getting that fixed tonight so I can get out again this weekend.  I just have to remember where and how to catch the toothy critters as Bass closes here on Friday.  It's gonna be a long winter."

137320,Sinker,2007-11-27 04:16:00,8692,"I don't fish that side of the lake much. If I was going after perch, I'd launch in pefferlaw and head out from there. Not sure what the ice situation is there in the canals though, might be iced over. A call to Caseys would fill you in though.  Sinker"
137370,Terry,2007-11-27 11:42:00,14456,"I would be looking at the wind Barrie may be the best choice, with the wind  but out from sibbals point park or beaverton to the perch grounds is where I would go"
