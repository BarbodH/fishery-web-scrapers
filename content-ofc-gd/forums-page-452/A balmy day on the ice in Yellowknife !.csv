My son and I decided with the blue skies and -37 windchill we would try our luck at catching dinner. With mother nature blowing the wind at our back, we soon realized that we may have to cave in and eventually buy a clam shell or pop-up. But that silly thinking was thrown out the window when we had a tug on the line. We tagged on to a nice Lake Trout after about 1 hour on the ice. Our new filleting knife will be put to the test tonight. Hope the rest of the country cools off fast to make some hard water. Check out the pic !"
