655293,ketchenany,2012-01-10 17:25:00,3229,"Welcome To Canada  The guy shooting this video is deer hunting from his tree stand, when an adult-aged black bear moseys into the clearing directly below his tree. What the bear does when it looks up the tree--after over two minutes-- and sees the hunter may surprise you.  I personally think itâ€™s an ""oh crap!"" moment, but this guy has got to be one cool customer ... either that, or he had a video camera in one hand and a .44 magnum in the other! The moral of this story must be ... ""if confronted by an adult-aged black bear, just be calm and act cool ... then merely ask the bear a question."" Turn your audio up so you can hear this; you just won't believe it unless you hear it for yourself!  http://www.wimp.com/curiousbear/"

655313,fishnsled,2012-01-10 18:34:00,3520,I can't believe the hunter let the bear get the close. Cool to see and funny how the bear seemed just a little surprised when asked the question.

655539,OutdoorDan,2012-01-11 06:12:00,325,I went on the guy's youtube page and he has another video where he calls a coyote in close and then asks the same question.  I like this guy.  
655540,manitoubass2,2012-01-11 06:28:00,11391,I wish the bear I ran into this year was that afraid  I had to do some Jacky Chan moves with a fillet knife in hand to evoke and positive reaction(Get it to run off!!!)
