655818,Moosebunk,2012-01-12 02:30:00,3970,"The pic with (I believe that to be Craig Blackie, Phd in char guy) the laker you posted Dave... that fish I thought was a Deline netted fish.  So, if they're one in the same fish (pic and article) that's cool to now be clarified.  The ""sagginess"" of the fish... well, my guess is it was either frozen before and thawed, or it spent a little too long in the net or out to rot and soften.  I remember getting some arctic char that had been in the net awhile and then frozen, when I thawed it out the skin of the fish looked kinda like that... and the soft flesh saggy and only good for chowder.  GREAT fish.  Agreed with Luke... I think they're something like 20 years to 20 inches in those northern climes, and then a 1/2 inch per year on average until reaching max.... not sure though.  Some lakers up there do make the 100 year mark.  It's absolutely great to see that fish came from Slave.  One can only imagine how much of that waterbody never sees anglers."
655828,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-12 02:42:00,10439," Yes, it's Craig. The picture was taken in the Hay River enr office.  The one netted in Deline is still in the freezer up there last I heard. 83# Laker  "
655834,fishing n autograph,2012-01-12 02:59:00,2540,how the hell would that thing swim geez it's huge!
655916,BUSTER,2012-01-12 15:40:00,1336,Good Read
655475,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-11 02:35:00,10439,This is an article from our local newspaper published in the summer of 2011. This piggy laker was caught in a net on the South side of Great Slave. Here is a pic taken of it at the enr office in Hay River.  
655478,Rizzo,2012-01-11 02:39:00,4754,that thing is ridiculous
655479,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-11 02:41:00,2690,That gives a whole new meaning to the term Hawg!!!
655484,BillM,2012-01-11 02:46:00,17367,I can't even imagine how old that fish is.
655486,Terry,2012-01-11 02:48:00,14456,"what no weightwatcher in Yellowknife, NWT  man that thing is fat "
655493,Nipfisher,2012-01-11 02:58:00,2449,Ya but look how far out he is holding it lol. JK.  That is a brute!
655525,young_one,2012-01-11 04:40:00,620,Great Laker!
655530,John Bacon,2012-01-11 05:08:00,3277,Looks well fed... I guess bait fish are plentiful on Great Slave.
655541,FieroLuke,2012-01-11 07:02:00,24,I think I've gone a little soft since I have had my first child but I feel a bit sad seeing that big fish dead. I read the article and the laker could be well over 65 years old.  Thats quite the fatty
655542,Freshtrax,2012-01-11 07:06:00,2215,"Imagine tryin to get it through a hole?  ""Hey jimmie...run to the house and grab the chainsaw"""
655586,johnnyb,2012-01-11 15:03:00,3413,So fat!  Would love to pull that beast in
655594,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-11 15:23:00,0,wow... that fish probably hasn't spawned in a decade in order to grow a belly like that.
655619,MCTFisher9120,2012-01-11 17:07:00,3761,"That's just amazing...wow  Good little read, thanks for posting"
655657,l2p,2012-01-11 19:15:00,346,WOW!
655658,Harrison,2012-01-11 19:16:00,2202,"Holy Hoffa, that thing is fat."
655677,mercman,2012-01-11 19:58:00,7054,i bet it tasted like crap
655680,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-11 20:02:00,10439, It wasn't eaten. It was turned into the enr office for study and probably mounting for the visitors center or other public building.
655689,Roy,2012-01-11 20:30:00,13728,He's holding it too far away from himself. He's purposely trying to dupe the viewers into thinking it's a large fish.
655692,Harrison,2012-01-11 20:40:00,2202," I dunno, looks a little banked salmon sun baked."
655698,smally21,2012-01-11 21:00:00,993,"there is something odd aboutthe pic. ive held a laker at nearly 60 lbs fish that size can barely support their own weight out of the water, the fat just sags over your hands. how does the guy hold something so big and heavy at arms length without straining?  look at this fella struggling with this monster, please disregard the rope I think he may have rode this old girl in.  "
655711,BillM,2012-01-11 21:28:00,17367,"That top fish is most likely frozen, it's also resting on the side of the table..  He's not holding it outright."
655727,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-11 22:19:00,10439,  Bingo!!
655759,smally21,2012-01-12 00:19:00,993,"if it was frozen, why would his hands 'sink' into the flesh where he is holding it, and why would the tail sag?  if it was soft enough for his hands to sink into it, then how come the fleshy, soft belly isn't indented equally, or more, where all that weight is resting on the table?  was there a second shooter? grassy knoll?"
655760,BillM,2012-01-12 00:25:00,17367,Let's just call it an Atlantic and be done with it.
