654585,Billy Bob,2012-01-08 16:03:00,5865," Nope, that's the most recent bills....but there is only the wife and I here now....so you can't compare it to a family of 4 or more.  Bob"
654600,GBW,2012-01-08 16:42:00,8460,"we just got put on the ""peak time"" billing this month and it's already screwed my weekends up.  my wife runs a home daycare so we are going to get screwed big time with this.  I might have to get an exercise bike and hook it up to the TV if anyone wants to watch TV they have to ride the bike.  kind of like Gilligan did for something way back when stuck on an island for 'power'...."
654603,dave524,2012-01-08 16:47:00,4508,"Just the wife and I here too, my bills are right in the same ballpark as Billy's when you look at the cost of the actual electric, gas and water used it's all the extra add on charges that drive it up"
654624,Fisherman,2012-01-08 18:56:00,7201," Keep it up, I'll send the mighty Cummins down there to whip your TOYotas    and that'll just be the start "
654636,GYPSY400,2012-01-08 19:34:00,191,"Keep in mind too that if you are "" locked in"" with an electricity ""supplier"" for Kw/h rates that the time of day thing doesn't apply..  So you don't have to do laundry at midnight .. You pay a little more for hydro at night, but it's cheaper during the day."
654697,Billy Bob,2012-01-08 23:30:00,5865,"After giving this a little more thought why are guys struggling with electric shortages.....it's that the reason for a ""smart"" meter....for a country that has less people then the state of Kalifornia you shouldn't be struggling or being jerked around with electric."
654711,Fisherman,2012-01-09 00:21:00,7201," Ed Zachary    it's not that we're having shortages, hell we sell off enough to other places when they need it.  Summer time a little different, ACs going like crazy.  It's a political ""green"" thing driven by that idiot leader we have.  If everybody wants 5 big screen TVs in their house and every other electrical gadget, fine, let them pay for the high rate and then some.  Maybe they'll learn that the power source is not infinite.  I (we) do our best at home to conserve.  There are far too many out there, that ""walk out of the room and don't turn off the light"" if you know what I mean.  Anyway, had some good fun there.  Now I have to get back on my bike and crank out a few more watts."
654758,Tomcat,2012-01-09 02:16:00,395,"After perusing this thread, I compared my typical average daily electricity consumption before the installation of a smart meter to my average daily consumption after installation of the smart meter. Guess I have to count myself lucky because my daily consumption has remained fairly constant. The only difference is what I pay for the juice. Consequently, we try to relegate high power usage activities to off peak times.  For comparison sake with Billy Bob, my last 1 month heating bill (natural gas for a high efficiency furnace as well as for my hot water heater) was $71 (actual gas supply charge was only $28), last water bill for 2 months was $131 (actual water charge was $58) while my last electricity bill for 2 months was $160 (actual charge for electricity plus HST was $96)."
654799,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 09:56:00,5865," Your natural gas comparison is really probably better priced then mine....although I don't have a high efficiency furnace and I also use gas for the water heater, stove, grill and dryer my heating bill is supplemented by my wood burning stove.....I should of mentioned that....so that $60 gas bill should be a bit higher if we didn't use the wood burner....but it so nice 'N WARM (70-75) with it going...  Why is you water bill so high ? Seems out of line living in a area where freshwater is abundant. However you TWO month electricity bill is about par with mine.  Those idiots that call themselves the 99%'ers want to do some good....protest our high utility bills....."
654873,Tomcat,2012-01-09 15:30:00,395," My water bill includes a sewer surcharge (117% of charge for amount of water used) as well as a charge for water for fire supply (approx $5 for 2 months). In order to make our annual municipal tax increases more palatable, our municipal government transferred the charge for fire supply water from general taxes to individual water bills (more smoke and mirrors). My actual charge for water used is $1.32 per cubic meter (or $1.32 for every 264 US gallons)."
654876,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 15:37:00,5865,"Our water rates are $2.96 per thousand gallons. But then they add on a $3 per bill cycle (3 months) for Infrastructure Invest Charge....  We pay no fire supply water charge or any other taxes on our water (how did they miss that). We do have a sewer charge that is applied onto our town/county tax bill, but it's very little....I'm guessing under $75 per year...but since it's part of the tax bill I can write that off on my federal taxes."
655248,jedimaster,2012-01-10 15:02:00,3472,Why not just get a couple deep cycles and an inverter. Charge them at night when the power is cheap and burn it off during the day.
655262,Fisherman,2012-01-10 15:24:00,7201,"Problem is, I know you need just a wee bit more than a ""couple"" of deep cycle batteries and an inverter.  If you plan on running anything like a Mwave, toasters, anything high current draw, your euchered.  Then you need the transfer switches and all that wiring added.  Unless you know what you're doing or have an electrician do it, it becomes pretty expensive."
655266,jedimaster,2012-01-10 15:33:00,3472,"it would take some getting used to but we do much the same for our hunt camp every year, run the generator during the day and use thebatteries all night. You may not be able to run your furnace or dryer off of it, but lights tv etc...wouldn't be a problem. move all the lights, tv's etc... to a seperate panel and power the panel off of the battery rack, and charge it at night."
655288,bubbles,2012-01-10 17:15:00,591,"  problem is that is not where you are using all the power, the cost to to it would be too expensive, it would be a 200 year payback."
655315,jedimaster,2012-01-10 18:38:00,3472,"Not if you already have all the stuff laying around, spare deep cycles, inverters etc..."
654159,Fisherman,2012-01-06 23:50:00,7201,"I'm curious to know if there's any possibility that a Smart Meter read out can be changed remotely.  Quick intro, I've lived at the same address for quite a number of years, check my meter old or new over the years, and without fail, my average kw/h useage per day averages from 9 (low) to 16 (high).  This can be attributed from not cooking, no AC running, etc in the summer to having a few more things running, ie. truck block heater on timer, etc.  I have a new (3 yr old) very high efficiency furnace, DC motor,  gas hot water, gas dryer, high eff washer, only use the dw(dish washer) (not dear wife),  every 2 or 3 days as needed.  My monthy average ranges from a low of about 270 kw/h to a really high month would be 450 kw/h.  Okay, so I'm a frugal jerk, but I don't use candles or make the wife shiver.  All appliances are in good shape, not power hogs.  Fast FWD.  Yesterday read my meter 14250kw/h  minus last month 13850kw/h = exactly 400kw/h.  Neighbour happened to be out there with me having a chat.  Today as I walk past the meter, roughly 24 hours later, it's jumped to 14301 or 51kw/h higher.  That's more than 3 days maximum use for me with no apparant reason.  I call  Hydro One, the person says, yes there was a bit of a ""spike"" yesterday,  Spike, more like a freaking Titan Missile.  I'm not completely electrically savvy but, I don't think if I turned on every bulb, appliance and tool in the house I could dump 51kw.   Does anyone have a possible reason.  Thanks."
654162,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-06 23:54:00,10439,"I'm sure that it can't be the equipment. Just pay the $34,654 bill when it comes in."
654167,Fisherman,2012-01-07 00:02:00,7201,"That's what I'm kind of wondering too, if it jumped every day, it would pretty much triple my monthly amount, kind of an anomoly after being steady for 28 years.  Now if they screw you just a little bit, no one notices except them, they profit."
654171,ketchenany,2012-01-07 00:13:00,3229,"The ""smart"" meter is sitting at Queen's Park, Mc something. Who does not have to worry about conserving for the rest of his life. I've done the same thing short of washing dishes and laundry after midnight. (he doesn't have to worry)  This smart metre  to me is bunch of crap and only put in to take our hard earned dollars.  My wife watch our grand children (under 2) can we keep the house cold, not turn on the stove to feed them, wash their clothes in the daytime . . .  Let's keep voting them in."
654176,davey buoy,2012-01-07 00:17:00,5505,"Ever since they put that meter in a year or two ago my bill is about $40-$50 more a month. Even changed the bulbs over ,drying and dishwasher after 9pm/now 7pm when possible. Rec'd my water bill a couple months ago and my waste water was$8 more than my water coming in ,how is that possible now? Getting back to the meter, I think there is something going on! in"" Hydro's favour."""

Waste water can not be read thru a turbine unit due to the solids the only technology that reads waste water is a ""ping"" unit and are very expensive. We have a system if you have water irrigation they put in a separate meter in the house then deduct it from their meter and multiply it by the sewer fee.  Hope this helps   Art"
654217,ketchenany,2012-01-07 01:35:00,3229,"  So when I buy one of these does it make it cheaper? We all know how to save energy, it's the government who dictates how much we pay. I've done all possible to keep my costs, down  but then I also like to live comfortable according to the amount of taxes I pay very year. Why can't we turn off every second light on the 400 series of Hwys after a certain hour. Plazas with glaring lights all night long . . .parking lots empty. Who pays for that?  The water over Niagara doesn't run according to time of day, I know, I advertise how much water flows over the brink. yes there is maintenance . . .   Why do governments COEs Hydro/ Hospital . . . have to make million dollar salaries?  I have saved my energy bills since 2004, they are not doing us any favours!            I'm not making the millions that the hydro/hospital CEOs are making"
654236,nofish4me,2012-01-07 02:27:00,404,"I've been on the smart meter for over a year now. No problems like what you state. My cost actually went down for some months. ""Time of Use"" crap. Check out Hydro One website, you can track your usage. I wrote to MP and MPP, that I was concerned about time of use billing. I swear, I'm not ever going to tell my wife, when to run the dishwasher, wash my clothes, or run the clothes drier. Over 20 years ago I criticized a lunch she made for me, and I've been buying lunch ever since. So far I have no complaints about the smart meter. I can see the usage and determine the days my wife is home from work. Hahaha"

I check the site every few days and look for suspicious spikes in usage. It helped my realize we had left the baseboard heater on in the spare room one time after we had overnight company. Could have stayed on for weeks if I hadn't checked usage."
654300,Fisherman,2012-01-07 14:27:00,7201,"Thanks for the links, I'm going to go and open the account to track usage and see what that can reveal."

I have a smart meter and I do whatever I can to run all the appliances at night (they all have a delay option now) and if not we do the laundry all weekend.  No matter who is making me do it, or asking me to do it, the bottom line is that it is saving me a few bucks.  When the rates skyrocket it will be a habbit and it will save me a few more.  It's been a year and a half now and it has beccome the norm, my wife thought I was nuts a year ago.  It is interesting to watch the time of use stuff on line, you can see when the wife uses the hairdryer and coffee maker in the morning, then leaves for work, and when we ate dinner that day.  I think THAT is what is behind all of this, the government leaning our every step!  LOL"
654304,Jer,2012-01-07 14:47:00,1426,"It's certainly taught me that our biggest power spike is from the hot-water tank, showers and laundry are obvious on the graph.  It's a neat tool, I can even see the fridge cycling on every hour or so during low usage periods when no one is home or we're asleep.  Last Tuesday night when it was really cold (-23C or so), I could see that the baseboard in the basement had cycled on a few times. I keep that t-stat set at only 5C or so just to keep the pipes from freezing."

654376,captpierre,2012-01-07 20:19:00,2521,"Remember guys.  Hair dryers, lights, coffee makers etc add heat to your home.  Furnace will run less. Dryers are the biggest pigs.  Not only do they draw power (esp electric) but they suck the warm house air out and make your furnace work harder. Central vac does too if the unit is in the garage.  I close the door to the laundry room and open the window in that room so that the dryer sucks in mostly outside air. Or try to dry clothes on a warmer day."
654377,Fisherman,2012-01-07 20:19:00,7201,"Ha, good guess but no donut for you.  Yes I do have a little Linc Mig 100, but it has not been used for about 6 months, I know they can suck up the juice. I've gone to the website and opened up an account to see my hourly/daily/weekely usage.  Funny thing is we are not on Time of Use in my area, but the chart shows it as such, only we still pay the average 7.1¢/kw/h.  What I'm still stumped on is the 51kw/h jump on the meter in 24 hours and it doesn't show it on the chart.  That meter just might have a bad encounter with a tree branch that's conveniently co-located.  I'll keep the peace for now, check the meter daily and see what happens."
