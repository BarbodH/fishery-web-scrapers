If your thinking about one ,he has a few."
655337,BillM,2012-01-10 19:49:00,17367,The Okuma covers are nice and big.
655340,davey buoy,2012-01-10 19:53:00,5505," Bill didn't have much of a option,this is from what I see and they told me It's more than big enough.Will put on later this evening.Will you know."
655360,Roy,2012-01-10 20:55:00,13728,What are you protecting them against at home? When I see them in pictures they're always either submerged in a brown river or laying in the sand and rocks on shore. I'm missing something here.

655716,spinnerdoc,2012-01-11 21:51:00,556,Daiwa has a pretty good one. I got mine at lebarron's. The one i got houses my 5 1/4 reel nicely with rod attached
655718,solopaddler,2012-01-11 21:55:00,8605,  HAHAHA!
655720,misfish,2012-01-11 21:57:00,29133,"  Why would Daiwa have one?   Davey,if yer down that way again,I could use one."
655729,spinnerdoc,2012-01-11 22:22:00,556," I was wondering the same thing, it's probably for a salt water spinning reel"
