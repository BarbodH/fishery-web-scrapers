The winds were HOWLING and seemed as though we got there right when the winds and clouds rolled in.  Long story short, fishing wasnt very good (10 perch, all 6 inches lol).  BUT to the most important part: ICE!!!!!!!!!! There was a solid 5-8 inches around Stephensons point, and Port Perry towns boatlaunch same amount.  Ice seemed a little thicker as we went out deeper.  So for those of you itching to hit the ice, shes there in Scugog, and its safe!"
