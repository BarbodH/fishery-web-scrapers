655599,duxbware,2012-01-11 15:36:00,102,"Hello all,  With this warm weather we are having I have put off icefishing our trip to the BOQ. We are thinking of heading down to the Niagara River. Being first timers I think the safest way is to go with a guide. I did a quick google search and found a few guides. Nomad Fishing, Cast Adventures and Niagara Fishing Adventures are the three I have selected. Has anyone ever been fishing with any of these three guides? Do you recomend wading or boat? It said on the website it takes 10 days to get a N.Y state licence mailed to you. We want to go the weekend of the 20th in Jan, so fishing N.Y state pools are out...if anyone has any info please post or pm me. If you think we can do it on our own(no boat) please tell me how. Thanks in advance.  Todd."

655616,Fang,2012-01-11 16:58:00,1330,You can use the NY website and print out your license immediately for use the next day. Takes a bit to get your little yellow wallet card
655627,dheitzner,2012-01-11 17:41:00,314,"Second vote for Cast Adventures, Paul is one of the best anglers that I've ever fished with and is a great guy to boot!  Shore fishing can be good in the gorge, but from a boat is tops IMO. You can print your license off of the NYS DNR website right away. Good luck, Darcy"
655637,BillM,2012-01-11 18:05:00,17367,Paul is an easy choice.
655639,NAC,2012-01-11 18:09:00,369,From a boat with Paul Castellano at this time of year is a very good choice.  They have been doing quite well recently too.  Not that I wouldn't like the business but shore fishing once January hits can be spotty.  Whirlpool has been very inconsistent lately due to dirty high water. Good luck!
655653,torco,2012-01-11 19:06:00,656,hey nomad I just looked at your website looks like you do some pretty cool trips. I bookmarked for any future plans I may have with a guide.
655669,rhare,2012-01-11 19:46:00,387,"The Niagara is an amazing fishery. Paul a a great guide and a good friend of mine, you won't be disappointed booking a day with him. I set up a trip for a guy sub-contract for and tagged along on sunday. He wanted to target lakers and he got lakers all right. Lots of em! here's a few pics..    "
655681,duxbware,2012-01-11 20:05:00,102,Not much of a choice to make LOL....I just called paul and left him a message. I hope he has an opening that day. Thanks for all the advice. I will post photos!!
