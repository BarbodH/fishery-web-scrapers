655040,misfish,2012-01-09 22:57:00,29133,All I seen was DEER tracks.
655054,NAW,2012-01-09 23:40:00,4022, Maybe some coyote too
655058,irishfield,2012-01-09 23:49:00,26272,LOL.. yep those are 'yote tracks where I turn around to take off! (the deer tracks are at mid field! LOL)
655064,NAW,2012-01-10 00:02:00,4022," I might be picking up a 22-250 this weekend, if they yotes are bothering you, fire me a PM"
655284,bigbuck,2012-01-10 16:50:00,2449,"Wayne, that's where I go watch the sunset and smoke a nice cuban cigar. A lot of sledders aren't too thrilled about the lack of snow and ice this year. Last year, there was plenty of ice up on gbay but little snow."
653919,NAW,2012-01-06 10:40:00,4022,Does anyone live up near 6-mile lake?  Just wondering if she's iced up good enough for a little crappie fishing Saturday morn.  Any input would be great.
654058,irishfield,2012-01-06 19:51:00,26272,Chip.. CHIP.. slide... chip.. CHIP... slide !  Be carefull out there... there are snow machine tracks on it.. but there are also snow mobile tracks in my last picture and there ain't no ice there!          (thanks for the excuse to pull the 'bird out of the hangar!)
654067,johnnyb,2012-01-06 20:17:00,3413,Coolest reply ever  
654070,NAW,2012-01-06 20:22:00,4022,DANG WAYNE!!!  How could there possibly be a better reply?  Is that last pic G-bay?
654079,irishfield,2012-01-06 20:38:00,26272,"Yes.. that's the main boat channel out of Honey Harbour... going past Thompson Island at that point. Sledders going nuts on 1/4"" of ice."
654094,NAW,2012-01-06 21:00:00,4022, Who needs ice!  
654097,irishfield,2012-01-06 21:04:00,26272,"Yah.. I know the Webber clan... Fine when your Grampa can foot a helicopter for you, but these were solo runs by some nut!"
654098,irishfield,2012-01-06 21:04:00,26272,...
654105,BillM,2012-01-06 21:19:00,17367,"Might be time to get out on GPool.  Wayne, you see any open water except for where Whites Falls dumps in?"
654115,irishfield,2012-01-06 21:53:00,26272,Everywhere Bill... I'll dig up another shot coming over it. I know I got one at the locks and the lake above it. Not sure about before the 6mile dam...  ..edit.. all I've got !
654419,irishfield,2012-01-07 22:44:00,26272,"Well.. did you get there Nick??

654424,NAW,2012-01-07 22:51:00,4022,"We made it out.  4 to 6 inches of decent ice.  6 in the back bays, and 4 on the main lake.  Guys on quads running out on the main lake on 4""  Didn't get one single Crappie!  Managed an accidental eye though      The weather was a little nasty, with some freezing rain and snow.  If you look really close, you can see a guy on a sled running across 4"" of ice.  Foggy cell phone image though, so it's hard to see.   Here's me in front of my cottage.   And my fishing partner for the day. "
654428,irishfield,2012-01-07 22:59:00,26272,Yah.. we got three bands of nasty ice pellets here thru the day.  Glad you got out.. hope I helped make the decission for the days outing. Have a buddy with a place on 6 mile that flies as well...
654438,NAW,2012-01-07 23:28:00,4022,"For sure Wayne, it was a big help.  Very much appreciated eh!  Now if I could only figure out those darn Crappie.  We must have caught 40 of the smallest perch I've ever seen.  Unbelievable."
654461,ohhenrygsr,2012-01-08 00:23:00,947,Dear Wayne...
654537,GoneFishin,2012-01-08 07:22:00,349," I'll second that,  irishfield you are a legend! Can't beat a reply like that. I've got a lot of respect for you Wayne. Not because you drive a plane, but because you would go out of your way for some one else. Not that it's the first time that has happened or the last. It's people like you that makes this an awesome community to join. Just though I would share that as I take your advise as if it were law.  Keep at'er n.a.w, I'm looking for some crappie through the ice this year also."
654574,irishfield,2012-01-08 15:39:00,26272,I didn't go out of my way.. it gave me somewhere to go!  Thanks gonefishin!
654579,danc,2012-01-08 15:54:00,4677,I enjoyed the videos as well Wayne. And remember that I still have your parking spot reserved for the bird next summer.
654616,livinisfishin,2012-01-08 18:43:00,661,After you left Nick we still didn't get a single bite...we are on our way to little to give it a shot!
654622,fishindevil,2012-01-08 18:51:00,6254,thats the best reply i have ever seen on this board wayne !!!! awesome
654625,Leecher,2012-01-08 19:03:00,7832,Awesome of you Wayne to take the bird to the sky and survey the area Nice walleye btw Nick
654681,NAW,2012-01-08 22:18:00,4022, Thanks!  They are few and far between on that lake these days.
654773,Rod Caster,2012-01-09 03:29:00,5784,"Considering the lack of numbers, that's a real nice walleye, Nick. Hopefully nipissing puts out for you again this year.  Is Wayne doing this as a regular feature now?"
654993,jpfishing,2012-01-09 21:23:00,53,Amazing
655003,Skipper D,2012-01-09 21:50:00,1970,"Glad you got out for a day of fishing Nick , this video of Waynes is awsome , i been watching it over and over , wonder if i traded him some hours with the 550 six way if i could get a ride some time .... lol ."
