655322,goteeboy,2012-01-10 19:07:00,175,"Saw this posted on my friend' FB page. I'd take this over not fishing w/ all this warm weather.  Looks like a tournament.  The yellow banner in the middle is translated, ""Body Thawing Centre"" haha. "
655324,Lip-ripper,2012-01-10 19:10:00,228,Would be awesome to see a big pike get hooked and make a few nice long runs with that many lines down!
655331,richyb,2012-01-10 19:34:00,774,wonder what the chances are of the guy in the middle catching a fish ?
655332,Uncle Buck,2012-01-10 19:35:00,1000,"That's awesome...  no marathon walks out to ""the spot"""
655333,mike rousseau,2012-01-10 19:38:00,4661,Looks like the Alexandria ice derby...  1500 people on a pond... Holes are 25 feet apart in a straight line... Lines are 25feet apart... So you basically get a 25 foot circle per person...
655335,Rizzo,2012-01-10 19:45:00,4754,"good thing for the thawing centre, there are lots of people out there in running shoes!"
655351,Headhunter,2012-01-10 20:21:00,5703,All right who farted! LMAO! HH
655356,Fish Farmer,2012-01-10 20:38:00,2234,Kinda reminds me of the icefishing derby they used to have at Keswick.
655366,Rizzo,2012-01-10 21:20:00,4754,"just for fun I'd hook up a bait that is prone to wander a bit, once enough lines are caught in the mess...set the hook and watch everyone fight each other. Cut your own line and start fishing with a different rod"
655367,mercman,2012-01-10 21:24:00,7054,   You and i have wild imaginations !!! I can just picture something like that happening!!!
655374,Big Cliff,2012-01-10 21:41:00,6899,Probably not a good spot to go scuba diving at that point
655398,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-10 22:56:00,130,  THAT WOULD BE SO FUNNY
655407,davey buoy,2012-01-10 23:13:00,5505,I wonder how the re-stocking program is working?. Wow!
655421,Rustic-Fisher,2012-01-10 23:43:00,826,Ice  a couple whiteys and leave em flopping on the ice at BBP on a saturday and you may come close to a crowd like that with your hole in the center LOL. Seriously thou that's nuts. I wonder what they are fishing for??
655439,skeeter,2012-01-11 00:21:00,1907,Seriously thou that's nuts. I wonder what they are fishing for??  Doesn't matter. If it comes up out of the hole then it's going in the blender for fish patties.
655476,Rizzo,2012-01-11 02:38:00,4754," I once had a muskrat come up through the hole, I'm sure even that wouldn't escape the blender"
655492,waterwolf,2012-01-11 02:56:00,556,who got the contract to drill all those holes? don't see an auger anywhere. cha ching!
655521,mike rousseau,2012-01-11 04:22:00,4661, The Alexandria tourney with 1500 people... They use a kabota with a ground auger attachment... The ones they use for fence posts...
655522,Fishnwire,2012-01-11 04:24:00,983,"Would you even bother fishing there?  I guess just for a lark...or maybe if it was your only opportunity.  Seems almost like entering a lottery to catch a fish.  I'd love to know if anything was caught, (something must have been...you'd think) how big and how many...stuff like that.  I wonder if anyone bothers to fish there the rest of the year.  It would be kind of cool if fishing was prohibited there every day but one, and this was that day.  They might do OK if that was the case."
