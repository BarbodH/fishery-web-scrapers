655094,Dozer,2012-01-10 01:03:00,896,"Getting the bathtub out is the easiest part!  Chances are you will have to cut out the drywall as the poster above stated...  is the tub on the second floor or first floor?  Do you have acess to plumb the sucker once its in?  Technically it is easy to do, a bit of work is required, but it can be done.  Trust me, I would suggest just getting it refinished... if you're not handy.  As previous posters have stated, what started off as a bathtub replacement quickly became a bathroom make over.  If you have any questions, post pictures, I'm sure we can help you out."
655123,jedimaster,2012-01-10 02:10:00,3472,"Thanks for all the input, I think I'll just look around for some sort of anti skid coating for the bottom, failing that a full length tub mat. Just more work than I want to bother getting into. I think everyones input was of much assistance, and I thank everyone. Including the pm's I got.  besides its more time to sharpen my hooks and go fishing. Lol"
655198,aplumma,2012-01-10 12:38:00,6896,Good choice final input get the matt not the paint it will flake off and clog the drain.     Art
655203,Fish4Eyes,2012-01-10 12:56:00,1022,"I would keep in mind the fact that if you are replacing the tub, chances are the tile is old as well and bound to leak at any time (assuming it is old). My bathroom L-Cove tiles lasted 30 years before they started to leak, which is considered excellent. As a result of the leak, I was into water damage on the ceiling beneath. Something to keep in mind."
655209,solopaddler,2012-01-10 13:17:00,8605,"I had a really crappy old bathtub refinished a few years ago just before we moved.  Can't speak about the durability, but it looked absolutely mint when the guy was finished.  This may not be the best option, but it's likely your cheapest and most hassle free option."
655243,jedimaster,2012-01-10 14:52:00,3472,Do you recall how much it cost solo?
655287,solopaddler,2012-01-10 17:02:00,8605, About 350 give or take.
654869,jedimaster,2012-01-09 15:18:00,3472,Just wondering if anyone has replaced a bathtub? We have a standard metal powdercoated tub with the floor all scratched up. Its inset into a 3 wall setup with a front apron(all one piece). I was thinking of removing it by cutting the apron off with a sawzall and then if need be splitting the tub in half. Is this ok or is ther an easier way? I want to avoid breaking up the walls and removing any of the tiles if possible. I am not too sure if thats even possible. If I need to get into any major demolition I think I would ratehr try and just recoating it with one of those kits. Also will I be able to just slide a new on in without much difficulty presuming I can find one the same size that is. I would imagine I would its a fairly common sized one.
654870,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 15:23:00,5865,First you probably will NOT be able to remove the tub without tearing out some of the tile.....and that project tends to grow out of hand on some of these tub replacement jobs....also is there a chance it's a cast iron tub....the new steel tubs of today are made VERY cheap compared to older tubs.... That being said have you looked into just having the tub refinished....make a hell of a lot more sense if that's all you want to do is replace the tub....once it's refinished it will look like new.  Bob
654872,I'mHooked,2012-01-09 15:27:00,525,"Most of those tubs have lip that turns up around the egde which is how they are fastened to the studs. If the tiling was done properly, the tiles would come right down past that lip as close to the top horizontal surface of the tub as possible, then the edge sealed to the tub. This means that at least the 1st row of tiles would have to be removed to even get the tub moving.  Good luck."
654877,Mike Pike,2012-01-09 15:39:00,1332,Have you considered having Bathtub King just refinish your current tub.  I dunno if they have one up your way but they do a pretty decent job no matter how aweful your tub looks.
654879,blaque,2012-01-09 15:46:00,2419,"Been here, Done this LOL. I was in the same boat a few years back, wanted to replace a weathered tub and before i knew it i was in the middle of a gutted bathroom reno LOL. If your not into that, look at bathfitters or something similar (we have them in the states not sure if you guys have one up north). They basically fit a tub over your tub.  This took quite a while on my own, but it was worth it in the end.  Its true what they say, the first thing on site when building a house is the bathtub......and they build the house around it LMAO      "
654880,bigugli,2012-01-09 15:47:00,6138,Another alternative is a modular insert to sit where the tub sits now. It is a complete unit of tub and surround. You tear out the old tub and slide the unit into the wall space without the hassle of wall or tile repair. Removing old tubs always becomes a major project.
654881,jedimaster,2012-01-09 15:47:00,3472,"Yah I wasn't sure if there was a lip or not. From when I looked at it looks as though the tiles go down to the bottom. Refinishing was my first thought, whats the best home kit for refinishing? I have read mixed reviews on refinishing it."
654882,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 15:51:00,5865,DON'T do it yourself....get a pro to come in and do it....he will have the proper acids to clean the tub and the proper spayers and paint so it will last. Trust me it's worth paying around $500 as it will look brand new and have a 10 year warranty on the work.  Bob
654885,jedimaster,2012-01-09 16:01:00,3472,"I think in reality I'll just cut the old tub out and replace the lower strip of tiles if need be. I am definatly not going to get into a major demo of the bathroom, i'll cut it into 20 pieces before that happens."
654893,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 16:09:00,5865, That MIGHT get the tub out but unfortunately  it will not make enough room to drop the new tub in since you will have to noodle the tub in a manner that will make it too long to be placed into such a tight fit unless you tear out a LOT of rows of tiles.
654901,jedimaster,2012-01-09 16:25:00,3472,hmm
654902,206,2012-01-09 16:31:00,563,"We used the ""Bath Fitter"" in in out in a day looks beautiful....i didn't lift a finger and they back up the work.  OR  I got a buddy,pulled out the old put in the new....new leaked pulled out new reinstalled the new...few weeks later he's exhausted and has a half decent looking finish with no guarantee  I'm proud but not to proud to know when I'm in over my head!"
654909,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 16:44:00,5865, See your PM
654912,jedimaster,2012-01-09 16:49:00,3472,yep gotcha
654926,Jigger,2012-01-09 17:20:00,1237,Sounds like you just want to spruce up the look abit. Go for the refinish. Its not worth it for you to pull the tub.
654943,bubbles,2012-01-09 18:32:00,591,"You will have to tear out more than a could rows of tiles, likely going to turm into a complete gut.  Been there, Done that.  A couple pics would help us make a more edumacated comment"
654945,aplumma,2012-01-09 18:40:00,6896,Refinished bathtubs are nothing more than an epoxy paint sprayed on a cleaned surface. They will show any damage in the old paint thru the new paint. They will be a spot that is not cleaned well enough and the paint will bubble or peel. They will come out and fix it for free but you will have a repair that looks like a repair and the tub paint will be at a different height than the surrounding area and show a line every time the water dries. I have seen a lot of these repairs when they call me to replace the tub after they spent the money. Option two is a plastic cover they put over the tub and form up walls to make a pretty seamless finish. The dirty secret is the way the drain line is attached it can allow water to get trapped in between the tub liner and the old tub. You will find few plumbers who will repair this issue and none of them will offer a warranty. To remove a tub you can cut out the old tub but to install a new unit you need to strip out 3 to 5 courses of tile so you can place the tub in one corner raising the other end up high enough to get it in place then set it down flush. You then install the drain line and then the durarock and tile are installed. Don't forget to replace the faucet if it is worn or older than 10 years a good tile job should last another 10 or 15 years and to replace the faucet sooner than that makes tile work needed again.

654980,jedimaster,2012-01-09 20:45:00,3472,"I'll snap a picture tonight, is there any kind of non slip coating I can put on the bottom? must some sort of epoxy or something I can use. Or even a permanentish sticker? I just want to cover it up. the only worn areas are on the bottom."
655006,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-09 21:53:00,130,A SEEMINGLY EASY JOB AS A TUB INSTALL WITH BREAKDOWN EVEN THE BEST OF THEM. LIKE BILLY BOB SAYS...GET IT REFINISHED UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO DOWN A ROAD THAT'S NOT NICE
655009,jedimaster,2012-01-09 22:01:00,3472,I'll go down to Lowes and Home depot tonight and see if I can find a non skid epoxy or something I can put on the buttom. Even if I have to re do it after 6 months I would be ok with that. Failing that I think I'll just buy  mat to put on the bottom and just leave it.  sounds like way too much work.
655015,danbouck,2012-01-09 22:12:00,4380,"I replaced my tub 2 years ago, ended up gutting it all. The floor tiles go in this weekend"
655017,aplumma,2012-01-09 22:16:00,6896, It's that dang fishin habit that got you so far behind.   Art
655022,danbouck,2012-01-09 22:27:00,4380, There are plenty of excuses    I'd just rather do other things lol
655026,aplumma,2012-01-09 22:33:00,6896,I hear yaa I will do other peoples bathrooms for money but I payed someone to do mine. I Know ME without pressure I will find anything ELSE to distract me from finishing the project.  Art
655061,tb4me,2012-01-09 23:55:00,3295,"I do mostly bathroom remodels for a living. Are the tiles on the wall a ""standard"" 6x6 white or beige? If so you can CAREFULLY remove the bottom row of tiles, and buy enough to replace them when finished. Then cut out the drywall that sits over the ledge of the tub (approx. 1.5 inches up from the tub).If the tub is on an exterior wall be careful to not cut the Vapour Barrier on the other side of the board or you will be gutting it. Disconnect the plumbing from the basement. Slide the tub out, you may have to remove the toilet or sink vanity to make room. Cutting out the old tub wont make a difference as you will need the room to install the new one. Once the new one is installed and hooked up in the basement (Level) then replace the missing drywall (i recommend cement or Rhino board tile backer). Then install a product called Kerdi Band over the cut in the drywall and right down to the base of the tub (you may have to go double wide)to seal it up. If you do it right one layer on Band will work just fine as the roll is 6 inches wide.. If you do go double wide on the kerdi be sure to overlap a minimum of 2 inches, I think you get a 50 foot roll at Home Depot for $35 bucks. You can use mastic to adhere the kerdi band for that small amount, but I recommend using a non modified mortar..Install the new row of tiles the next day and 2 days later re-grout. Finish it all off with a nice even bead of silicone and your golden for another 10 to 15 years! Its really not that hard to do..If you need a couple more questions answered id be glad to discuss further over PM..Good luck no matter what you decide to do but id stay miles away from Bath Fitter, For what they charge you can put in a new tub and surround.. I just love pricing jobs after they are in the potential customers house..Makes my sales job real easy."
