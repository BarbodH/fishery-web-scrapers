655697,Locnar,2012-01-11 21:00:00,645,"I've been reading, don't know how credible the sources are... but I've heard that the Snakehead has made its way to Ontario... Anyone know about this? If they have, anyone know what lakes to find them in? I'd like to take part in trying to control their population."
655700,BillM,2012-01-11 21:02:00,17367,"Bowfins, not snakeheads....   People confuse them all the time."
655703,kickingfrog,2012-01-11 21:10:00,8333,"Certainly posible. They are tougher more hardie for southern Ontario's climate then piranha, and usually once a year you hear about someone catching a piranha."
655705,kickingfrog,2012-01-11 21:16:00,8333, Of course.    That is a very likely explanation.  Although if someone really knew what a snakehead looked like they could not possible confuse the two.
655707,Locnar,2012-01-11 21:17:00,645," Yeah, I could definitely see that happening. That and the burbot."
655708,Locnar,2012-01-11 21:20:00,645, Really? A piranha in Ontario?? I guess it's just people's pets that get released into the waters?
655715,kickingfrog,2012-01-11 21:45:00,8333, Definitely released from home aquariums. The supposition is that piranha would never survive the winter in any Ontario waterbody.
655719,mercman,2012-01-11 21:56:00,7054,Sheesh...looks like sport fishing is becoming a real HE MAN sport. Next thing ya know some rednecks will be noodling for snakeheads.  
655730,Billy Bob,2012-01-11 22:22:00,5865, NOT this Redneck.....
655732,Roy,2012-01-11 22:38:00,13728,There has never been a confirmed snakehead catch or sighting in Ontario waters. None in Quebec either.
655736,mercman,2012-01-11 22:43:00,7054,"   Give a whole new meaning to the question ""so....Are the fish BITING today buddy?"""
655738,Twocoda,2012-01-11 22:51:00,4130,they are supposed to be very good eating ...another Asian cuisine ....unless im actually in Asia...i dont want to eat local snakehead...In my new years day recovery haze i watched river monsters marathon and he did quite the show on them ....it is very possible that they will find there way into our waters...  although they look fun to catch creatures that bite and you dont know its comming scares the bejeesus outta me
655783,Freshtrax,2012-01-12 01:11:00,2215,I caught a bowfin this summer in simcoe.  Thought it was a snakehead...mean lookin fish and fought hard!!
655803,wildeye rainbow,2012-01-12 01:51:00,123,"I believe that I saw a show about them on River Monsters on OLN.  They are knocking at Ontario's door.  They have been caught in Pennsylvania and Illinois.  I hope they taste good with some Cajun Fish Crisp.  I googled ""snakehead"" and some of the sites reaffirmed what the tv show showed.  I'm going to need some kevlar waders."

655841,kickingfrog,2012-01-12 03:16:00,8333,Are you implying that they live and bred in Ontario waters?
