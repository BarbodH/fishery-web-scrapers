655446,kenzy31,2012-01-11 00:39:00,261,"trying to plan a trip up to Penetang Bay for pike this weekend.  Has anyone been out in the past few days? Not looking for spots, we can handle that part, just ice conditions. Thanks guys for your help  Jesse"
655447,Terry,2012-01-11 00:40:00,14456,I would be interested too
655457,BillM,2012-01-11 00:56:00,17367,"I'm sure Wayne has flown over the bay recently.  That being said, I doubt there is very much ice out there.   If there it, it's going to be sketchy."
655461,fishinmortician,2012-01-11 01:02:00,100,  2 huts on the ice so far.  A few guys walking out a bit further.  As for thickness I have no idea.
655480,Rizzo,2012-01-11 02:42:00,4754,this is getting kind of crazy. Kempenfelt Bay here in town has zero ice on it other than the marina areas...and even the marina looked sketchy today. This may be the latest I've seen in the 7 years I've been here.
655482,BillM,2012-01-11 02:45:00,17367, Time to get the boat out for whities!  lol
655488,Rizzo,2012-01-11 02:50:00,4754,I already unwinterized the boat once (a month ago)...not doing that again. Here's hoping we get some ice soon!
655496,BillM,2012-01-11 03:04:00,17367,"You and me both man, I'm itching for some ice action.   I might take a drive tomorrow morning to some sneaky spots."
655517,mike rousseau,2012-01-11 04:08:00,4661,  A guy I know hit whities the other day by boat... I think it was on simcoe...
655518,irishfield,2012-01-11 04:10:00,26272, Dang.. what's with all these board members poppin up in town! LOL  If you don't know the bay.. you'd better be carrying a spud bar that's all I can tell ya! Full of springs... multiple creek inlets... a friggin sewer plant outflow.. ETC !
655553,kenzy31,2012-01-11 11:42:00,261,"Thanks for the replies so far. South Basin off the point is where we will be accessing from. And yes, spud bar will be in hand, floater suits on, the works!  Thanks again, hoping to post a report Sunday!"
