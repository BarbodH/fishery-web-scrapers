655261,jedimaster,2012-01-10 15:17:00,3472,last time I tried to exchange a 70 dollar Bass Pro branded tackle bag with a broken zipper that I phoned in about and was told it wasn't a problem they told me I was only allowed to get a 20 dollar in store credit and that I was too cheap and couldn't afford to pay the difference for a new one. It didn't end well. Many bad words were exchanged and a cart full of musky baits ended up on the ground.
654997,jedimaster,2012-01-09 21:38:00,3472,"I bought a rod rack with a gift card I got for Xmas a few days ago, and wanted to pass on my info to you folks. It was the deluxe 150 dollar one with the  2 drawers and a cupboard with a racking system for tackle trays. All of my rods fit on and most of my boxes fit in. Thats about where the good things end.  One of the drawers came with a cracked and broken piece of wood, I glued it together and stapled it. One of the uprights on the cabinets also had a split in it. Its at the rear so it doesn't bother me too much. The drawers don't fit and don't shut properly. I had to redrill new holes for the sliders. They sort of work now. There was also a wood burned image of the Bass Pro logo on the top. It wasn't fully burned in and they had colored it in with a Pen. Yes a Pen. An Ink Pen. They didn't even use a black pen they used a blue pen. They did a fairly sloppy job even at coloring it in.  Anyway I guess I should return it, but its all together now and I don't want to go through the hastle of returning something to Bass Pro. It'll make for good conversation of why I don't shop at Bass Pro whenever possible.  So just a heads up do NOT buy this piece of crap Rod rack. I really shouldn't have been so lazy and built one myself from scratch. Oh well buyer beware I guess. I'll see if I can take a picture and upload it tomorow. For something that is pre drilled it should just fit together and function."
654998,lew,2012-01-09 21:43:00,12766,"Sometimes it's not worth the hassle of returning inexpensive items, but for $150 I'd sure be making the trip, but that's just me I spose."
655000,danbouck,2012-01-09 21:46:00,4380,I would return it. They will never fix a problem that they don't know exists
655004,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-09 21:51:00,0,"i read bad reviews on all the rod racks online.  cheap materials, sometimes missing pieces... i bought a plastic mhx rack instead for 20 dollars. lol"
655005,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-09 21:53:00,10439,  I just use a garbage can!!!
655008,jedimaster,2012-01-09 21:59:00,3472,"The wood feels like slightly balsa wood, anyway. I just really feel too lazy. The stupid thing took me 3 hours to put together. After having to put it together and take it apart. When I bought it the guy said they had a really bad batch with lots of returns but this new batch noone has returned any. Its so junky though. I would be embarassed if I owned Bass Pro and I stuck my name on it. The desing is just what I was looking for though, Lots of rod storage, and room for lots of tackle trays.I just wish the workmanship was at least better than a grade 7 wood shop class."
655010,Pigeontroller,2012-01-09 22:02:00,2793,I ain't hard to make yer own...
655013,Pigeontroller,2012-01-09 22:05:00,2793,"I find this particularly handy, out of the way and right above my boat! Of course it only holds some of my rods...  "
655018,ranksda58,2012-01-09 22:18:00,69,i would absolutely be returning it with a price tag of $150...and especially after an employee told me that they had a bad batch and there were lots of returns
655020,aplumma,2012-01-09 22:23:00,6896,I have 2 10ft pieces of PVC hug from the garage ceiling that the rods sit on. So far it has served me well for rod/reel combo storage. The extra rods and reels are in cardboard boxes and the tackle boxes are stacked on the shelves.  Art
655056,msp,2012-01-09 23:48:00,1336,Thats a great set up. can you show a close up of the rack where the rods sit in. Is that foam ? I might have to steal your design.
655065,mercman,2012-01-10 00:08:00,7054,"  That looks great !!! What did you use for the front piece, to hold the rods in place?"
655073,misfish,2012-01-10 00:21:00,29133,Want to sell the riggers? LOL  Very nice PT.
655077,HTHM,2012-01-10 00:31:00,4082,"Similar idea using PVC pipe: Have two pieces one 6"" long the other 3 - 4' long. A slot in the longer pipe 8"" long wide enough to slide the reel through, a space between the two pieces and slide in the long, slide butt of rod in the short and they are hanging. ======]   [=="
655125,jedimaster,2012-01-10 02:14:00,3472,"Well I am in a condo so I need something floor mounted, and something not too distracting or my fiance will put me on the curb. I am thinking about using it as a template to make one with betterr materials. I'll have some time since I am not doing the bathtub replacement."
655130,Pigeontroller,2012-01-10 02:26:00,2793,  They're long gone...I figured new ones would work better...
655131,Pigeontroller,2012-01-10 02:35:00,2793," 2"" hole on one end...    I cut a notch on this end that was smaller on the open end and glued some mini-cell foam into it, 1/4 hole drilled into the foam, slice into it with sharp utility knife."
655132,Ron,2012-01-10 02:46:00,1683,"For those of you who have left handed reels...     Cheers, Ron..."
655133,Rattletrap2,2012-01-10 02:46:00,1652,"Pigeon troller, that is some nice workmanship right there!  Jedi, To my knowledge, The C.Hina company has never been known for their prowess in woodworking skills! LOL  Too bad BPS has to stoop to this low level though. There was a time when they cared about the products that carried there name. Its not like Johnny Morris is hurting any.  Imagine if IKEA ever got into making products for fishing tackle storage? Now there stuff usually goes together very well!"
655234,lookinforwalleye,2012-01-10 14:38:00,4399,Don`t know why on earth anybody would stand for that you should have returned it no questions asked.
655236,BillM,2012-01-10 14:40:00,17367, I see what you did there..   LOL!!!!
655242,jedimaster,2012-01-10 14:50:00,3472,"Ok fine, I'll return it. I guess it'll give me something to tinker with on the weekend since I am still waiting for furniture to be delivered and no interent at home yet(yeah Bell service)...I'll see what the schedule is like tonight after work, sanp a few pictures before I load it up in the car and drive over to bass pro. Hopefully I will be able to get a refund. I definatly do not want a store credit. Maybe I'll get the cash back instead of the gift card and I'll go shop around for a better built one, or go to home depot and buy some wood."
655249,lew,2012-01-10 15:02:00,12766,You may actually have a problem returning it now that you've drilled holes in it and applied glue to some parts.  Be interesting to hear how you make out and best of luck with it.
655250,jedimaster,2012-01-10 15:04:00,3472,"Yes, I am sure it will be an interesting experience. I'll likely end up on youtube with a million hits... ""Shopper goes ballistic at Bass Pro over a rod rack"""
655252,lew,2012-01-10 15:06:00,12766, That'd be worth the price of admission just to see that
