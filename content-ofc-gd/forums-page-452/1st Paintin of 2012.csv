655057,davey buoy,2012-01-09 23:49:00,5505," Nice painting,great question pike!"
655135,bushart,2012-01-10 02:52:00,2628,"Yup  In real life---My boat is named ""Alice E.""  The day after I took delivery of my boat in 96 my mother passed away  So I named the boat after her---Alice Elizabeth or E.  She was forever warning me about the dangers of waters and to make sure if there was lightning to get off the lake--so in this way She always would remind me.  So fast forward to my painting------that li'l abbreviated name is something us painters hide in our works from time to time"
655136,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-10 03:11:00,336,"  Yup, thats the stuff of legends.  The ""Alice E"" .  Thanks for sharing."

655221,Skipper D,2012-01-10 14:04:00,1970,"Bushhart , why the one blue & one brown ?"
655224,bushart,2012-01-10 14:17:00,2628,Skip---that's the camera---they're both blue  I learn something every day about photographing my paintings----but I talk with other painters and unfortunately----there's sometimes no substitute for real time viewing  I work hard to get it as close as possible but---I'm told internet art may even boil down to monitor calibration.  Welcome to the new age
