655751,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-11 23:48:00,2582,I have been on Couch since Dec31 so I'm betting St John is as good or better. But I have not been there so I can not say for sure. Play safe and don't go alone.

655939,deffect,2012-01-12 16:34:00,15,I was on lake st john two weeks ago and there was about five inches of clear and 2 of white. Had some cold nights since then so i would imagine it will be even thicker now. Apparently there is two springs in the middle of the lake though that need to be avoided this time of year. I should be out there this weekend. hope this helps
655994,cheaptackle,2012-01-12 20:25:00,849,BE CAUTIOUS!!!  They've taken a couple logs out of the dam to lower the lake level - it's gone down almost 2 feet since christmas.  I'm on the north shore in a little cove - the ice surface right in front of me is showing several cracks with water welling up.  It's seeming somewhat better further out but only that I can see from shore - I ain't going out there for a bit yet.  Michael

656024,cheaptackle,2012-01-12 21:28:00,849,Only info is what I can see from shore lately.  Never got my tinny out this year at all and not looking like I'll get any hardwater time unless things change drastically.  I did see one chap walking around the entire west side and there are reports on another board.  I ain't gonna be the one to say go or no - we all know how to judge for ourselves.  I really don't like the look of what I see out front so I think I'll just stay in the warm and see what develops. If I ever DO get out and come up with something you can bet I will be bragging about it!  Michael

656029,johnnyb,2012-01-12 21:51:00,3413,I never knew it was a dammed lake.  Well I'll be darned.
