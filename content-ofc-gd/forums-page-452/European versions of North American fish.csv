655177,BassAsin,2012-01-10 05:36:00,806,"a zander,  they once stocked a lake in the states with them, cleaned the lake out and scared the government so they killed the lake off a couple years after so the american zander record was like 3 lbs, until a few years ago a lady caught one that made it through the ""lake kill off"" and it was 17 lbs i believe it was in an ood mag a few years back."
