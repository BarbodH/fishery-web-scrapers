653802,timmeh,2012-01-06 01:22:00,609,"Never know when you'll hook into the big one...   Here are a few from this year;  The first one was my PB for about 30 minutes until I landed the second one.     This was caught while fishing for bass with the 6wt. Nice surprise and I may target these guys once or twice next year with the fly rod.   Salt water fishing is a blast, except when you need a heavy hoodie in Florida.. but I really wanted to get a decent snook so I was quite happy with this one. "

Now I just need to relax and hope I don't continue to cough blood. They say it happens like 1 in a 1000 where the vains to the lungs bleed a small amount. Well lets hope my odds are that good fishing and I get sone monster fish that is 1 in a 1000.
