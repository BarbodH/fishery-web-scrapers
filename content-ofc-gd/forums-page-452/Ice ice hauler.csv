654400,davey buoy,2012-01-07 21:49:00,5505,"Met up with a couple fellows there this morning for a bit.Looks like you had a good day Guys. Wish I would of seen your""buggy"".looks great.You have given a lot of people some good ideas. Maybe a patent first?:whistling:LoL."
654402,Terry,2012-01-07 21:54:00,14456,to be honest  I had a totally different design for it and was going to build them from scratch but I would not be able to get a patent because nothing was original..and it's hard to patent an idea and to show it to a manufacturer..well they would just change one thing and sell it as their own..if it was a good idea
654404,Rob,2012-01-07 22:04:00,467,I'm not sure who has meaner looking eyes.. you or that Crappy!  :clapping:  Rob C
654411,Skipper D,2012-01-07 22:20:00,1970,"A couple of sets of lawn tractor wheel weights mounted to the wheels hu Terry , i know a guy ner you who should have some ."
654416,Terry,2012-01-07 22:34:00,14456,yeah that would do the trick
654421,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-07 22:45:00,10439,Yer not gettin' enough wheel speed on dat ting. Ya needs ta throw on a tubro charger and nitrous system. Could use a free flowing aftemarket exhaust system and a little porting and polishing too. Then it'll get where ya want to go.
654423,davey buoy,2012-01-07 22:50:00,5505," If he increases the motor pulley diameter,look out!,gives you more rpm's to the drive wheels."
654426,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-07 22:53:00,10439," Yeah, but there's no substitute for horse power."
654430,Terry,2012-01-07 23:05:00,14456,LOL  it wasn't built for speed I do have a 600 Kawasaki motorcycle engine I could throw on it  LOL
654435,tb4me,2012-01-07 23:19:00,3295,you have to be carefull with those snow blowers..They operate on a friction plate. They will wear out real fast pulling weight.. Its a rubber wheel that spins on a metal disc. The old snowblower I have in the yard has this same issue..The wheels dont turn under load..
654436,Skipper D,2012-01-07 23:24:00,1970,"  I believe i have a set of cast iron ones that should fit your wheels back in the shed you can have , 50 pounds each i think ."
654437,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-01-07 23:27:00,83,Good use of and old snow blower. They made machines similar many years ago. They called them Hus Skis.  
654439,Terry,2012-01-07 23:29:00,14456,that is how it works I had to clean the disc to get the wheel to turn and to get reverse to work  if this thing works well I will change it to chain drive
654444,tb4me,2012-01-07 23:41:00,3295,Awesome Terry! Id love to see how the chain drive conversion works out..If you do it please take pics..
654448,misfish,2012-01-07 23:45:00,29133,"For what it was designed for,it will work fine, once it,s done right. It,s not meant to pull the weight of Terry and gear.It,s to make the haul of the port hut and gear. It will work,yoda has the force.HEHEHE"
654453,Terry,2012-01-07 23:51:00,14456,
654454,Leecher,2012-01-07 23:54:00,7832,That is nuts   but I like it    Looks like fun
654455,misfish,2012-01-07 23:58:00,29133,"I did catch a OOS fish,but it was quickly released.        Take no offence to this,I just wanted to be one up on a bud.I GOT ONE TOO LOL  "
654659,Terry,2012-01-08 20:58:00,14456,I figured you would post that one...LOL
654671,misfish,2012-01-08 21:24:00,29133," A salute to a friend ,my friend."
655394,Stoty,2012-01-10 22:37:00,2910,That's awesome!!!!

654348,irishfield,2012-01-07 18:41:00,26272,Da 'tings a guy will do when he starts getting old !!!  Yah think you can get up and into Browns Lake with that Terry???
654349,Joey,2012-01-07 18:51:00,9122,"OMG Terry, that's very inventive I'll give ya that"
654350,Terry,2012-01-07 18:56:00,14456,you know when you're a redneck when
654356,kickingfrog,2012-01-07 19:21:00,8333,The weight needs to be over the wheels.
654357,misfish,2012-01-07 19:22:00,29133," I was going to sit on it Rob,but that darn muffler gets hot."
654359,kickingfrog,2012-01-07 19:25:00,8333, The alternative is that it needs less weight in the back.
654360,Terry,2012-01-07 19:27:00,14456,it does need more weight  a block on the front and my gas auger on top and that should do it
654363,tb4me,2012-01-07 19:31:00,3295,"Awesome..I wonder If you were to weld something to the frame with a metal box above the motor that you could put a cement block in to help with traction. I showed the wife and she said "" he could walk out quicker"", clearly she hasn't had to drag 150 lbs. of gear and hut a couple miles out..Good idea Terry. No licence or insurance needed for that. I happen to have an old 8HP  snow king blower here..Now ya got me thinking."
654365,Terry,2012-01-07 19:35:00,14456,once it got going it didn't spin the wheels  but the extra weight would help  the wheels I have n it are much bigger and wider then the ones it came with  
654366,GYPSY400,2012-01-07 19:39:00,191,That's funny... Now your giving me ideas for that old snowblower I got in the back yard!
654367,Terry,2012-01-07 19:40:00,14456,everyone says it funny then they say they have a snowblower they could use......  guess it wasn't all that funny...LOL
654370,misfish,2012-01-07 19:59:00,29133,"Come on Terry,tell them the real use for it?   It,s wasnt meant to work like that.(but was fun to watch) There was a melfunction with the attached ski. This will be remidied soon."
654373,Terry,2012-01-07 20:12:00,14456,"yeah it had a ski and it was to pull all the huts out the bolts for the skis broke we need to rework it  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2FPB060029.mp4"">"
654375,danbouck,2012-01-07 20:14:00,4380,Can't find damn used snowblower anywhere but apparently everyone has an old one in their backyard lol
654380,Sinker,2012-01-07 20:34:00,8692,"screw some studs in the tires. Pretty slick rig there guys, I like it!!  S."
654381,Terry,2012-01-07 20:43:00,14456,I have truck/atv chains on it  they are as pointy as any studs. I think more  the thing is just too light
654382,irishfield,2012-01-07 20:44:00,26272,  I think some other wise old bugger suggested that to him on a trip to BOQ as well..
654383,GBW,2012-01-07 20:50:00,8460,the force is strong in old yoda on the sled...

654386,misfish,2012-01-07 21:05:00,29133,Dang we forgot the fish pics bud.      Trumpiters  
654390,Rob,2012-01-07 21:14:00,467,Awe I can See Brian! I can See! Nice little snot rockets there Terry! You guys will have to change the gear ratio on that thing and get some of that Ice chewed up with those chains. One would have to assume that those Geese or cranes took off when they saw you guys motoring across the lake with that machine!  Rob C
654391,misfish,2012-01-07 21:17:00,29133,I was wondering that Rob. Same thing I seen in Collingwood a few years back. They did hunk tho.
