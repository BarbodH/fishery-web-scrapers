655345,BillM,2012-01-10 20:03:00,17367,I could use some SA Sharkskin Trout taper in 6wt.

655349,solopaddler,2012-01-10 20:18:00,8605,"  They already had a 50% off sale in December, pretty much all the fly line went at that time.  No noteworthy rods or reels will be available, they've already been moved to the new location and aren't part of this sale.  What's left you say?  A bunch of tying material and everything in their Archery shop if you're a bowhunter is up for grabs...."
655357,torco,2012-01-10 20:47:00,656,"Don't head up there much wish I had known about the  50% off sale, don't need anything major just some leaders, tippets, etc"
655358,torco,2012-01-10 20:49:00,656,"I just went to the website, are they just moving or going out of business? Ken gave me my first taste of fly fishing when I took a course he instructed at Conestoga College."
655359,solopaddler,2012-01-10 20:50:00,8605,  They're moving.
655361,torco,2012-01-10 20:57:00,656," Thanks Solo, just wanted to confirm. It would have been a shame otherwise."
655365,SylvanOwner,2012-01-10 21:18:00,266,Anyone know what their selection of bowhunting stuff is like?  Have they moved some of this stuff to the new store or are they dropping this part of the shop altogether?
