I was wondering if anybody has one of theses, and has any feedback on it.   I have not been able to find any information about this hut, it seems like CT is the only store that sells these. They are not even listed on Rapalas website, and all of Rapalas huts have a red/black colour scheme and this one is blue, which seemed odd to me.  I was wondering if this is 300 or 600 denier material and insulated or  not. also general feedback wwould be good, if anybody has any.  Thanks  "
