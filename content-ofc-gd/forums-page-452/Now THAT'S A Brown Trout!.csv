655410,davey buoy,2012-01-10 23:31:00,5505,You can say that again:clapping:
655413,Musky or Specks,2012-01-10 23:36:00,2710,"Let me be the first to say...Atlantic.... Just kidding, huge fish though."
655414,Rod Caster,2012-01-10 23:36:00,5784,That's a pretty big net for not expecting a fish that size  Great video
655415,atvaholic,2012-01-10 23:37:00,271,"WOW, thats a beauty!  I love how he jumps on it near the end and looses his rod in the river...done that a few times...with some less significant fish"
655417,Stoty,2012-01-10 23:37:00,2910,WOW!!!! I love the way he didnt care and jumped in to make sure he didnt loose it! That's a true fisherman!
655425,Moosebunk,2012-01-10 23:45:00,3970,"Quote Matt, ""I pulled a Brad Pitt River Runs Through It to net the fish.""  The PG version but still great nonetheless.  Who wouldn't want a beauty brown like that take on a mayfly.  Cool stuff!"
655426,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-10 23:55:00,2690,Spectacular!  Browns and specks do it to me everytime.
655427,kickingfrog,2012-01-10 23:55:00,8333,Nice Fish.
655432,okumasheffield,2012-01-11 00:08:00,318,I would have jumped in earlier! nice nice fish
655433,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-11 00:09:00,0,that's awesome.  tackled a steelie a few falls back in a similar fashion.  water dries quick but the pain of watching a big fish take off lasts a lifetime. great video. thanks for sharing.
655436,Leecher,2012-01-11 00:15:00,7832,"30"" brown    WOW man... simply WOW"
655442,solopaddler,2012-01-11 00:29:00,8605,"It is impressive for sure. But....this is no doubt a small tributary of Lake Tahoe and the fish is migratory, not unlike our own great lakes browns.  There's obviously a short seasonal fishery for large browns when they run the rivers flowing into lake Tahoe to spawn.  By the size of the guys net the fish wasn't a huge surprise.  Our own fishery in this neck of the woods is absolutely world class for lake run browns.  I had at least one myself slightly larger than 30"" this past fall. A beautifully colored buck that smashed a small crankbait.  Still havn't caught one that big on a fly rod, that's pretty cool."

655463,Jds63,2012-01-11 01:17:00,1365,beautiful fish for sure
655481,kemper,2012-01-11 02:44:00,2232,"That is pretty cool stuff Mike, I'd love to tangle with a fish like that on the fly.  I managed to tackle one of my own this fall, he was slumming it in one of our east tribs...no lake Tahoe mind you.    Didn't put a tape on it, but had to be somewhere around  the 30"" mark."
655543,FieroLuke,2012-01-11 07:11:00,24,"I love steelheading but brown trout are still my favourite by far, beautiful colours both on the fish in the vid and yours. Been a while since I caught a full spawning colour brownie."
655548,solopaddler,2012-01-11 10:41:00,8605,  Beauty fish Brady!
