655999,Court R,2012-01-12 20:29:00,213,How deep?
656001,Musky or Specks,2012-01-12 20:39:00,2710,Head out from the landing to the west off the islands about a third of the way to Arthurs Point and find about 35 to 40 feet of water. There might be huts out there already but with the mild start maybe not.
656046,sirfish,2012-01-12 22:33:00,175,"Hey Court ,was up there a few years ago .Found lots of shoals lots of deep drops a couple miles down from the provincial park. We nailed some decent pike and eyes all around the shoals and although I didn't target them,there were tons of hooks on the bottom in 60 to 90 ft. most likely lakers and whities. This is one lake I have to get back to as it is loaded with fish...oops shhh don't tell anyone..I'll just black out the background of my previous statement and noone will have a clue where i'm talking about... Good luck would love to hear how you make out."
