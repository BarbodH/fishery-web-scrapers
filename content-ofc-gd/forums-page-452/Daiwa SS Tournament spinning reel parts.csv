I plan on repairing them myself this winter and was wondering a good place to order the parts?  I was thinking Ebay but if anybody has any specifics I'd welcome that.  As well, anybody have experience modifying the anti-reverse to make it instant?  To me that would make it perfect.  Thanks"
655774,Ralph Field,2012-01-12 00:52:00,1018,I think that Aikmans in the GTA carry parts for them.
655853,kingofthesteelhead,2012-01-12 04:24:00,140,I am also in the same situation.I was told to try Rocky's which is in Orillia. Have dealt with Aikman's in the past with no problem.Need two bail arms as they snapped on each reel.

656016,NANUK,2012-01-12 21:04:00,797,"Some parts are available on ebay, search ""daiwa ss"", shipping might cost more then the parts thogh, other then that, try Aikman, they are authorized Daiwa repair centre. If you are looking for a drag upgrade, smoothdrag carbontex washers are the best money can buy. $8.00 for a set of 3 washers and you'll have a silky smooth drag. best results when coated with Cal's or Shimano's drag grease."
