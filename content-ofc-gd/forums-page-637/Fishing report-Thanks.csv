Although the fishing was slow, we did manage some very nice panfish, I missed a really good musky hit and had another follow.  Sorry no pictures, was too busy enjoying the extremely hot weather and being out on the lake for the day. Surprised to see the weed growth this year and that almost all of my favorite drop offs and holes seem to be devoid of fish. Managed a visit with my parents, Big Cliff and Sue, to finish off a nice day. Thanks again HTHM.    PS. The boat is running better for those that have asked but I still have some tinkering to do.  Thanks again for all the help."
500387,Joey,2010-09-01 01:21:00,9122,"Well I'm really glad you got a chance to get out Carole, and got a chance to see your ""parents""  Kudos to HTHM for taking you out, very nice indeed.  I'll just imagine the pictures in my head  Joey"
500389,HTHM,2010-09-01 01:26:00,4082,"Your welcome, I enjoyed the day, but not the heat..... Oh, I got my work done too.  You may be better off with pics in your head, the real ones may have had me in them."
500391,fishnsled,2010-09-01 01:34:00,3520,Nice to hear you made it out Carole.  Too bad about the fishing but sometimes it's just the getting out that matters.  Thanks for the report.  
500440,motv8tr,2010-09-01 05:41:00,2587,"Hey Carol, glad to hear you made it out,  Maureen"
500444,SlowPoke,2010-09-01 08:39:00,2984," Yup!! I'd rather chase the skunk off the boat than away from the garbage cans at home! Carole, your season is just getting warmed up and we're all looking forward to more reports."
500458,Big Cliff,2010-09-01 10:34:00,6899,I'm glad I managed to get home from work in time for your visit. It was nice to see you both again.  Now you know what I was talking about when I said you could hardly get a boat through the weeds they are so thick this year and there is no way you can fish off the dock.
500478,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-01 12:30:00,0,"Thanks for the report. At least you got out there and was able to enjoy some fishng. I'm stuck at home with a cast! Anyways, thanks for sharing."
500810,Bly,2010-09-02 11:29:00,1556," Thanks Joey. I will try for pictures next time   LOL   very true!   Those weeds are ridiculous but not enough to prevent a visit   Always happy to get out, even if I do not catch anything.  How much longer in the cast for you?"
