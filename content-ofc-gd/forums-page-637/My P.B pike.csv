499287,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-08-28 11:14:00,1362,Beauty looking pike!!!...congrats!
499288,dnb_cbr,2010-08-28 11:21:00,61,"Thanks for the comments. It hit in about 5 fow back trolling a black ""Big Hammer"" 5 inch swimbait on a 1 oz unpainted swimbait head.  It was the last day of an 11 day trip, and i hadn't landed a big fish yet, so she was very welcome to come have a rest in my cradle for a few minutes.  These big hammer swimbaits are amazing, They have a great balance of price,durability and action.  These things swim great even with the slowest retrieves.  "
499291,16sailor,2010-08-28 12:14:00,38,nice fish.
499296,yakpiker,2010-08-28 12:29:00,160,"Maybe it's just my eyes, but the colour and pattern of the head doesn't seem to match the rest of the fish.  Is that common with pike?"
499315,Joey,2010-08-28 13:45:00,9122,"What a gorgeous fish, congrats on the PB.  Joey"
499534,Fisherpete,2010-08-29 16:38:00,1814,"The only appropriate response is WOW. What a beast, can't get over the head on her. Ducklings? Buh-bye. Ducks? Buh-bye. Moose? OK, maybe not just yet..."
499563,vinnimon,2010-08-29 19:01:00,2593,OMG! Nice one
499566,Raf,2010-08-29 19:19:00,3495,"nice fish  from what i've seen head size has more to do with environment and forage than whether a fish has potential to grow into anything  given the same length, fish that tend to spend most of their lives in deep water have smaller heads, shallow water fish the opposite.  great lakes (deep) fish that may eat a lot of alewife, cisco may have smaller heads than inland lake fish that spend time eating shallow water food"
499569,Pigeontroller,2010-08-29 19:42:00,2793,"Yup, thats a nice Pike!"
499575,sutherh,2010-08-29 20:18:00,15,Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water. An unbelievable creature....
499685,WeedLine,2010-08-30 00:51:00,322,Great fish. What a gorilla
499878,aplumma,2010-08-30 18:07:00,6896,Now we know how the rumors of Toe Monsters living in the water comes from. Nice fish   Art
499935,Jigger,2010-08-30 21:38:00,1237,"Wow. Thats a gorgeous head, I mean Pike! Awesome looking fish man. Out of 5fow no less..."
499956,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-30 22:14:00,0,  go it!
498961,dnb_cbr,2010-08-27 04:17:00,61,"44 inch, guessing 30 lbs, based on a 46 i had on a scale that tipped 28.5. "
498963,The JAY,2010-08-27 04:25:00,239,Nice gator buddy!!!
498964,Grimace,2010-08-27 04:25:00,2020,Look at the head on that thing.  Nicely done.
498965,dnb_cbr,2010-08-27 04:38:00,61," This fish made me think...I mean will this fish actually grow into its head? It was unproportional to any fish i have caught before.  Ive seen 42's that are obviously genetically maxed out, they look in proportion. Then you get a 38 that has the head of a 42, and a body that seems that it cant catch up, In my opinion the 38 with the big melon has the potential to be a monster, while the in-proportion 42 is about as big as she's gonna get.  So if the moose( thats what i named her) actually grows into that noggin im thinkin g she'll be a 50+++ class fish"
498967,Roy,2010-08-27 04:42:00,13728,Just beautiful! Congrats to you.
498968,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-27 04:57:00,0,"What a beast..............I asked b4 but never checked again, what does PB stand for??"
498970,kgeary,2010-08-27 05:29:00,82,Great fish Really big head That shows she will get even bigger before she is done. Congrats
498976,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-27 08:38:00,1107, Personal Best and thats a nice PB gator just a big thick fish.
498979,sauce,2010-08-27 08:48:00,219,"I was told that fish head size is based on age and growth rates. A fish with a large melon is an old slow growing fish. Smaller head would indicate a younger or faster growing fish. No matter what, that's a great fish you caught. Best of luck breaking that PB."
498985,lew,2010-08-27 09:53:00,12766,"Big chunky pike, really nice !!  Been a very long time since that big girl was called a snot rocket."
498995,scugpg,2010-08-27 11:21:00,1373,That is awesome!
498997,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-27 11:30:00,0,Man! Was that pike caught in Ontario? I used to dream about catching big pike and I barely recently broke the 10lb mark. That is definitely a fish of a lifetime! Thanks for sharing.
