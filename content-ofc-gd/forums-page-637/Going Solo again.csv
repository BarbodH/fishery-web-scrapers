495669,johnnyb,2010-08-18 02:17:00,3413,I think I`d have to head for Chapleau.  Or dive off hwy 144 and find some back lakes to explore.  
495698,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-18 03:04:00,1107,Trolling for monster Erie pike at the bar some big girls out there in october.
496289,danbouck,2010-08-20 00:07:00,4380," Plenty of time for that!   I figured it out, just gotta decide on what I'm driving and canoe or boat.  50° 0'29.75""N  79°51'0.25""W or close to it  Thanks for the help everyone."
496356,fish_fishburn,2010-08-20 10:05:00,1311,Hey Dan you don't have to travel that far. If you like fall smallmouth in the 4 lb average with a good chance of catching 6 lber's and walleye averaging 4 lbs come up to the Ottawa Valley. Were so spoiled here with over 2000 lakes in Renfrew County and major rivers as well. Fall time smallies here is just plain SICK. Pm me if your interested. Less traveling= more fishing. Good Luck.
496360,Stoty,2010-08-20 10:26:00,2910,October - Feb 28 = BAY OF QUINTE TIME!! That's TROPHY season for Walleye's!
496361,fish_fishburn,2010-08-20 10:30:00,1311,"You got that right Stoty, already have my 4 day trip planned and booked for the end of November on the BOQ"
496364,danbouck,2010-08-20 10:45:00,4380, That's happening too
496580,Stoty,2010-08-20 19:22:00,2910,"I am really getting the itch to fight some 10+ lb'ers, that's for sure! These 4-8 lb summer 'eyes, just aren't cutting it anymore for me! lol  I can tell trophy time is coming, because we are really starting to book up fast for the upcoming months! Woooooo"
499994,danbouck,2010-08-30 23:23:00,4380,Sooo.... I had my trip planned then I ran into this http://www.jamesbayroad.com/travel/intro.html
499996,fish_finder,2010-08-30 23:29:00,370,oh man....is this the new destination?
500001,danbouck,2010-08-30 23:32:00,4380," Could be but it will be about 3500km total, which is a lot of $$$"
500005,solopaddler,2010-08-30 23:38:00,8605, Lots of opportunities to choose from Dan.  I can actually give you a good one in QC off the trans taiga road.  You can drop a boat right in it.. and tons of fish.  Can also give you a bunch of options in N/E ON about 7-8 hours from home.  If you havn't decided yet we should talk.
500011,danbouck,2010-08-30 23:45:00,4380, I'll definitely send you a PM regarding my trip. Right now the plan is to head up 652 and basically just stop at random lakes and try them out.
495124,danbouck,2010-08-16 21:07:00,4380,"OK, I am sending the wife and kids to Scotland for 11 days in October to visit her Grandparents. Sadly the funds just aren't there for me to go so instead I want to find somewhere within 15 hours from Cambridge to catch an insane amount of fish. Mainly walleye, pike or bass. I want to be able to wake up, cast and catch something.  Where would you go?"
495128,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 21:12:00,154,"BISCOTASING, monster pickerel, that or Tyson lake."
495130,alexcba,2010-08-16 21:12:00,634,loblaws? i think they still have those live fish tanks..  maybe time to look into some northern ontario back lakes and camping.
495159,danbouck,2010-08-16 21:48:00,4380, That's what I'm looking for
495166,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-08-16 22:04:00,0,Chapleau or Wawa/White River
495170,danbouck,2010-08-16 22:08:00,4380, I'm already thinking Chapleau
495177,Musky or Specks,2010-08-16 22:22:00,2710,This! Solo would probably agree except its probably not tuff enough slugging for him.
495187,TDunn,2010-08-16 22:38:00,680,Chapleau x2! heading in that direction in a few weeks myself!!   TDunn
495189,fish_finder,2010-08-16 22:41:00,370,hmmmmm.....kesagami?  Get on a plane somewhere after you've driven 10 hours and you should still be well within your 15 hour time fram
495192,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 22:44:00,154,pretty well anywhere up north
495195,fish_finder,2010-08-16 22:46:00,370, Thats half the distance you are willing to travel....  Why not push it to the limits?
495201,Guest natron,2010-08-16 22:53:00,0,"Come to Northwestern Ontario, anywhere around Fort Frances, Thunder Bay, Kenora or Dryden. IMO the bass lake fishing in the world. Many of the lakes are also full of numerous trophy fish from many species, like largemouth/smallmouth bass, crappie, walleye, musky and pike. Some lakes in these areas will also have nice trout as well."
495215,bucktail,2010-08-16 23:46:00,1857,Fishing has been very slow at Bisco this summer.
495216,CLofchik,2010-08-16 23:57:00,854,"Are you bringing up a boat like a Sportspal or a canoe?  Hardcore canoe version (to keep Solo from thinking you're slacking off) the Shumka Loop from Missanabie to......Missanabie.  Take the train or a shuttle and canoe through a dozen lakes (with 27 questionable portages) to Little Missinaibi Lake, Missinaibi Lake back to Missanabie.  Including the drive up and back in 11 days is doable but it would be a slog death march some days.  Hardcore Lite version, grab the train at Foleyet to Elsas and paddle the Kapuskasing Lake & Nemegosenda River PP for a week, flag the train back to Foleyet.  But yeah with 11 days including the drive up & back Chapleau would be a good start."
495236,smally21,2010-08-17 00:43:00,993,"the name eludes me but remember a post about a fly im just outside of sudbury, an awesome walleye lake that was only about 5-6 hours.  it was a great post that looked like it should have come from way further up north.  less of a drive but you could invite some local OFC'ers to your cottage for some fall bass and smoked meats...."
495252,HTHM,2010-08-17 01:27:00,4082,Long Point Bay!
495318,craigdritchie,2010-08-17 11:23:00,1586,Cheaper to go to Scotland.
495321,Roy,2010-08-17 11:36:00,13728, SHHHSHHHH His wife hasn't left yet!
495326,Harrison,2010-08-17 12:00:00,2202,"Hahaha, Dan you've dailed this one in nicely. Hey, my wife's Grandparents are in Scotland too, hmmmm"
495396,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 15:13:00,154,"Ontario is just such a great resource you'll have no trouble finding a place, but you should definetly push it to the limits."
495420,danbouck,2010-08-17 15:58:00,4380,"Thanks for the info. I think I'm looking at going 4 days total and fly ins are out. Money is an issue. I am thinking drive the first day, camp and fish for 2 days, then drive back."
495423,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 16:01:00,2690," Nah, less travel...more FISHING!!!!!"
495448,wallyboss,2010-08-17 16:47:00,1095,Might be hard to find an Outfitter at that time of the year in Northern Ontario. Moose season!!!!
495456,danbouck,2010-08-17 16:56:00,4380, I am planning on sleeping in a tent or the truck depending on the temps
495488,Musky or Specks,2010-08-17 17:59:00,2710,Dan why don't you go back to Restoule but do some boat in camping on Clear Lake. If you need some info on where and how PM me.
