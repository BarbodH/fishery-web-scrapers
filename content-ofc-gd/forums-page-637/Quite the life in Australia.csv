They started off in Vancouver sailing their boat down to Mexico, across the Pacific stopping in places like Fiji and New Zealand and ending up in Australia.  After a hiatus they are back at it and have made a short video of the 1st leg of the next journey.  Hope you enjoy!   Highlights from our 600 nm trip from Brisbane to the Whitsunday Islands. Good to be back out sailing the ocean, catching fish, playing with dolphins and watching the whales.  "
