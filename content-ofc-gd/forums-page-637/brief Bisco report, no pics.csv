500352,chris.brock,2010-08-31 23:47:00,4053,"yeah, we did Ramsey about 6 years ago, surprising good walleye fishing, good average size too, we considered portaging into Ramsey for a day trip I never really felt that I figured out Bisco, maybe a couple more days and we would have"
500419,Nipfisher,2010-09-01 03:02:00,2449,Some guys I know were in Ramsay last week. The caught and ate their limits (4 guys) twice and brought their limits home too. Two of them also brought home limits of nice sized pike. They had some breif periods where they were consistantly getting double and tripple headers and then the bite would die off.

The lack of fish is kinda frustrating though, only 5-6 walters per day isn't much. There is always a trip next year.........."
