499901,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-30 19:37:00,2582,"I think salt water fish tastes better....but I never have it at home. At home I eat what I catch. It provides me with an excuse to get out and enjoy the outdoors and the chance to get a feed of fish. If I lived near the ocean I know I would eat alot less fresh water fish, cause I would have the chance to fish salt water species."
499903,misfish,2010-08-30 19:42:00,29133,Dave  Ever have grayling?
499919,kickingfrog,2010-08-30 20:52:00,8333," I had a bunch of them on my arctic canoe trip. Tasted great. In all fairness They were about as fresh as you could get and they were our only fresh meat for 5 weeks. My fear is that if I ever have grayling again it won't taste as good as I remember.  As to the original post, I like them both. In general I like the light flavoured fish like walleye, perch, sea bass, halibut etc. more than the ""meatier"" fish. Doesn't mean I don't like smoked salmon, a small laker fried in the pan next to my campsite, or a deep blue piece of tuna that has just grazed the grill."
499957,Kinger,2010-08-30 22:15:00,351,"I don't EVER buy freshwater fish, simply because of how it is caught and who is allowed to catch and sell it."
499978,bigugli,2010-08-30 22:59:00,6138,The pure satisfaction is in cooking the catch. I'm not down in the maritimes so I just have to be satisfied with what's available here til I'm down East again. Once I'm there I'll eat fish every day. ( the wife hates me  ) If I go south I eat loads of cat and crawdads. It's whatever the catch of choice is.
500041,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-31 00:25:00,10439," Yep, don't like it. Some people do but I just don't like it. Gotta say I don't like salmon either."
499408,misfish,2010-08-29 00:35:00,29133,"Always loved a great feed of fresh water perch,crappies and whities,but my tastes have gone back to the sea.   Last night the mrs and I had a great feed of fresh west coast halibut and other sea crestations at the fish house,also tried something new,Newzeland blue cod.Im a big fan of the east coast cod,but this Newzeland blue cod was very tastey.  Question is,do you prefer sea of fresh water fish?"
499409,bassman87,2010-08-29 00:37:00,586,i just love red snapper
499432,bigugli,2010-08-29 02:35:00,6138,Fish is fish either way. The fresher the better.
499436,oxcowboy,2010-08-29 02:45:00,544,"mmmmm halibut, my favorite by far, but there are not many that i dont like.   jason"
499438,misfish,2010-08-29 02:47:00,29133,"Sorry Bruce,you of all,should know better.Fresh seafish IMO,cant be beat."
499441,Duckie,2010-08-29 03:00:00,305,"Vagina jokes aside, probably the best fish I have ever eaten was fresh fried red snapper caught that morning straight out of the Caribbean Sea in Cozumel Mexico. I still dream about it. and the restaurant on the beach and the great rum punch helped a lot with the experience  and I have eaten a hell of a lot of fish in my time. good ocean fish like snapper, good grouper or mahi mahi beats any freshwater fish IMO."
499442,bigugli,2010-08-29 03:06:00,6138,"I appreciate each for their distinct differences, whether it be East coast halibut and cod, BBQ char from Frob, gravlax from Sweden, or fresh perch from the ice on Simcoe. I don't play favourites. They all have their place on the plate."
499443,misfish,2010-08-29 03:10:00,29133," I,ll give you that one."
499446,Kinger,2010-08-29 03:40:00,351,"I LOVE cod, can't get enough."
499448,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-08-29 03:56:00,0,lobster and crab.
499450,shimano25,2010-08-29 04:58:00,31,"Seriously, saltwater fish generally beats freshwater fish hands down in terms of edibility. My favs are cod, haddock, and ocean perch (always fried). Saltwater fish has the advantage of not having that weedy/muddy taste of a lot of freshwater fish.  The only freshwater fish that I have tasted that comes close to the saltwater fish in terms of a lack of a fishy taste is perch.  "
499464,Rich,2010-08-29 11:02:00,3927,Never had saltwater fish that I really enjoyed all that much. To catch or eat. lol.
499483,Burtess,2010-08-29 13:15:00,901,"I tend to like the ""meaty"" fish, and you don't find too many of those in fresh water. Swordfish, dolphin, shark...... IMO nothing much beats a rare (almost blue) sashimi grade tuna steak... YUM!!!!  Burt"
499517,Duckie,2010-08-29 15:28:00,305,I agree with that. A nice rare peppercorn crusted tuna steak is tough to beat.  no bass or pickerel can even come close.
499523,MJL,2010-08-29 16:04:00,2427," You know it!  Most of the fish I do enjoy eating come from the sea. I don’t usually keep any of the fish I catch though.  I’ve never tried crappie, walleye, bluegill or pike so I'm probably missing out.  I really like eating the oily types of fish like mackerel, herring, tuna and salmon the most.  I guess I have an acquired taste for it.  I do like halibut in fish & chips as well as small baked trout and BBQ eel (from the sushi restaurant).  This season I kept 2 small brown trout that swallowed the hook too deep and they were pretty tasty."
499532,OhioFisherman,2010-08-29 16:37:00,6623,McFish! and not too often.
499690,aplumma,2010-08-30 01:02:00,6896,One of the best things about living on the coastal area is the variety of fish we have in both saltwater and fresh.I was bass fishing Saturday and the saltwater has come up so far in the Potomac their were people catching crabs right next to me.   Art
499759,Beans,2010-08-30 02:57:00,3339,I find cod or haddock much more flavorful steamed with a ginger/garlic (fresh) sauce than freshwater fish...red snapper or orange roughy come a close second...  My oldest son is highly allergic to freshwater fish of any kind and though I can eat some I prefer saltwater for eating...catching...that's a different kettle of fish...(my bad pun)
499763,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-30 03:57:00,10439,"I am also a big fan of ocean fish. My favorites are halibut, cod and believe it or not flying fish. Them little winged buggers are soooooooo tasty."
499764,Duckie,2010-08-30 04:02:00,305,"yeah, flying fish is the sweetest fish I have ever had. had it many times in the Islands. it amazing when marinated in lime, garlic and peppers then breaded and fried. amazing!"
499866,Billy Bob,2010-08-30 17:35:00,5865,"Fresh water perch, walleye (pickerel, eh), crappie are my favorites but tuna is hard to beat, even with a Ugly Stick...  But what about pacific salmon......it's caught both in fresh and salt waters.....huh, either way it's hard to beat smoked.  Bob  BTW...does ANYONE eat stinky smallmouth bass ?"
499870,sheyuid,2010-08-30 17:42:00,25,"sea fish is clean, fresh water fish is tasty."
499871,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-30 17:43:00,10439,"  Dude, you're killing me!!!!"
499884,siwash,2010-08-30 18:34:00,683,"I am not even going to bother reading the other posts - I feel more strongly about this than any other ""issue"" out there! There is NO friggin comparison. I grew up in an italian home eating fish regularly, and there is no way anyone in their right mind who knows anything about food can claim that freshwater fish tastes better or even close.  Try grilling swordfish and see what ya think!  Case closed!!!  "
499889,Mike Pike,2010-08-30 19:06:00,1332,"Well, I gotta agree with Swordfish on this one.  Saltwater fish, most every saltwater fish, tastes better than freshwater.  High marks, however, to Lake Erie and Lake Simcoe Perch."
