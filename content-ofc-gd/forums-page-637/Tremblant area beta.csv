499778,Jer,2010-08-30 10:13:00,1426,"Several years ago, we stayed a week at Tremblant at my brother's condo.  Looking at a map, there were lots of lakes in the area so we dragged the boat with us. We never did find anywhere to launch and fish for a day. Hopefully you'll have more luck getting your kayak wet somewhere."

I think there are a variety of public beaches on the lakes up there. I know there is a least one on lac tremblant. You could launch a kayak from the beach. I would suggest bringing a bass gear and fishing obvious structure. From my experience topwaters can be a good choice this time of year, Good luck and post a report if you get anything."
