This year has been a bit of a struggle as we had to move the date due to a conflict with the CSFL’s Great Lakes Series which changed its dates for this year. As we have done the best we could to work around Bassmania we have had to go with this new date.

It's a fun event for a great cause. Last year we were able to donate $3000.00 to the charity and hope to increase that this year. Prizes are donated from local businesses both small and large as well as sponsors from the fishing industry. Last years winning team walked away with $1000.00, All other competing teams went home with cash or prizes. There will be food and beverages available for the competing anglers after the event. Entry form is available at our website at www.niagarabassmasters.com or email myself (Pete) at [email protected] and I will email you a copy. Once again this is a fun event and any/all teams are welcome. (B.A.S.S. membership is not required)  This is also a great opportunity to enjoy fishing the same waters that the Bassmania Great Lakes Series and OBF qualifier was held on. Hope to see you there. Remember that this is for a great cause and the money raised stays locally. Thanks, Pete Elphinstone Tournament Director - Niagara Bassmasters"
