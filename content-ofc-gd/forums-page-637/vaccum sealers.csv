Thanks Al"
499973,danbouck,2010-08-30 22:45:00,4380,I got a food saver from Bass Pro and it's been awesome
499974,Billy Bob,2010-08-30 22:51:00,5865,"There are MANY different models of the ""FoodSaver"". The one I have has been flawless for about 3 years now.....but remember the bags are a bit pricey.....I found I can purchase and save money on the bags using Ebay.  Bob"
499975,walleyejack,2010-08-30 22:54:00,358,what model did you get Billy ? there are about 4 or 5 different ones i have seen   
499977,Billy Bob,2010-08-30 22:57:00,5865, V2830
499980,walleyejack,2010-08-30 23:00:00,358,right on. will look around for that one. See if i can find it somewhere  thanks B Bob  
500133,Roy,2010-08-31 10:15:00,13728,That's the model I have. I've only had it for 2-3 years but I use it a lot and it works very well.
500187,squiggs,2010-08-31 14:02:00,10,"Definitely recommend the Foodsaver brand, I don't know if there is a mechanical difference from one model to another, I just have the $100 version available at sears, zellers and such. It is fantastic for keeping bulk purchases fresh, and especially for transporting fish home from a road trip. The bags are cheapest at Costco (if you know someone with a membership) A box of 4 large and 2 small width rolls is about $35. The best I have found at other retailers is $20 for 2 large rolls. Cheers jamie"
500208,dave524,2010-08-31 15:17:00,4508," grab the flyer when you go into Costco, often they'ii have them for $10 off the 4 roll deal, stock up then."
500390,walleyejack,2010-09-01 01:33:00,358,"thanks for all the input guys. picked up Foodsaver v3 something model at wallyworld, was cheapest spot around, and u can use Rival bags in it,which are 12 versus 27 for the Food saver bags, tried it out,works pretty cool Thanks Al"
500395,solopaddler,2010-09-01 01:45:00,8605,The bags are even cheaper when they're free.  If you buy your milk in bags like I do you're set. Clean them out and they work just as good as the ones you buy.
