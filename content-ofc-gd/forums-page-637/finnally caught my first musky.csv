499050,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-27 14:54:00,932,Man what a way to break the musky cherry!!!  That is one thick Musky.  Congrats bro.  Ryan
499100,esoxansteel,2010-08-27 18:12:00,1307,"Congrads on your first musky, and your expert hold and quick release, that fish will still be around and you can catch her when shes a 50,"
499110,diggyj,2010-08-27 18:33:00,548,"Sweet muskie, nicely done for a first!  Dirk"
499220,ttreacy,2010-08-28 00:59:00,19,"Welcome ot the ski club.  Once you are hooked, it is tought to quit hunting them.  My biggest is a 52 and I need to top it."

500030,sheyuid,2010-08-31 00:11:00,25,"nice fish, good job."
500058,justwannafish,2010-08-31 01:12:00,82,Nice fish man!! I'm a little upset with the picture though.....I mean really.... It's your first Musky and it's pretty much as big as you are and you don't even look the slightest bit excited. You should work on that.  hahahah  Amazing catch! Can't wait to see more! Thanks for the post
500279,muskeybugged,2010-08-31 19:09:00,282,haha Nice! Yeap you'll always remeber your first!  I found that second one was harder to find though...Go get em'  Congrats good to see the hard work pay off!
500358,Aaron Shirley,2010-08-31 23:58:00,655,That's a great musky. Congrats and many more to come
500411,k-max,2010-09-01 02:45:00,20, That is a BEAST by any standards!! Nice fish!
500451,Rich Clemens,2010-09-01 10:07:00,3131,"I'll bet after that one, you hooked.  I started off the same way, but my first wasn't what I was fishing for.   Congrats.  You caught a very impressive fish as your first.  Now - go out and get a ""bigger"" one."
498855,walleye_man,2010-08-27 00:17:00,135,"well today we spent a good 12 hours in the boat fishing for musky and hoestly if i didnt get one today i was about to give up.... thank god today was the day  but fist lets start off with the story we started off and after a couple of casts i get backlash and the line gets stuck in the trolling motor so we head back over to mickeys take the prop off and get rid of all the line  45 minutes we were back on the water trowing bucktails, topwaters, jerkbaits you name it without a sniff  so we try a bunch of spots and about 10 hours into the trip im talking aabout how i have never had a hit on one of theses ""secret lures"" and just as i say that boom my rod bends RIGHT over and the fight is on  what i brought in was this BEAST..... by my standards        he was 40 inches long and was REALLY thick im still shakeing that was my biggest ever fish to date and gave one of the best fights ever  he wasnt out of the water for more that 45 seconds and swam away strong  im really happy about how everything went and by the way my new favorate fish are musky  hope you enjoyed chevy"
498856,Familyfisherman,2010-08-27 00:22:00,188,"Great job  !!  My first (and only) was about the same size -- what a rush!  Mine was missing an eye and part of its tale, but hey fought great  Thanks for sharing -- nice pics!"
498862,ctdd2006,2010-08-27 00:34:00,531, Beauty thick beast!  Way to go....love the smile!!!  Awesome stuff!
498866,Pigeontroller,2010-08-27 00:39:00,2793,"NICE first Muskie! If you are getting the shakes and need to talk ""Muskie"" and be around others with the same 'sickness' check out www.muskiescanada.ca  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/chapters/ottawa.php"
498871,Gregoire,2010-08-27 00:43:00,1397,"Congrats. The first is a huge rush. It is dangerous though. Once you catch musky fever it's hard to recover, but in my mind its not a fever you want to get over."
498883,Grimace,2010-08-27 01:09:00,2020,Well done sir.  You look pretty thrilled.  Cheers to many more.
498898,alphaalpha,2010-08-27 01:36:00,475,"NICE work!    I still haven't landed one yet.  It's coming though i can feel it   P.S.You should smile, we can't tell if you are excited or not."

499009,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-27 12:16:00,2690,"Congrats!!  You ""gotta"" love those big, stinky, beasts!!!!!!!"
499013,jbailey,2010-08-27 12:22:00,866,"congrats man! your huge smile says it all! I love the KR3W hat too, lost mine a year ago.."
499026,K_F,2010-08-27 13:42:00,107,be careful - its an addiction and over 12 hours without a fish is a stretch you might have to do from time to time  congrats
499029,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-27 13:55:00,3761,"Awesome catch dude. Haven't caught a fish like that for 2 years or so now...Probably I know enough that the musky addiction is very expensive!!  Tightlines buddy, must of been fun.  MTBF"
499030,Spiel,2010-08-27 13:55:00,9065,Outstanding! Congratulations.
