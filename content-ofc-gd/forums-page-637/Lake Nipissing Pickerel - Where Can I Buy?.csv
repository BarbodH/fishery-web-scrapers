499933,Gerritt,2010-08-30 21:34:00,6129,  You have hit the nail on the head. We have had many discussions about this while playing cards or out fishing on Nip.. and the same resounding conclusion is made... just as you put it.  G
499948,canadadude,2010-08-30 22:07:00,769,"Still the same old blame game, been like this for the last 20yrs"
499969,Billy Bob,2010-08-30 22:37:00,5865," Yes you are right.....but we need to come together in this world. We will NEVER be united until we all live under the same rules. Can you at least agree on this ?  ?  ?  UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL. I know many don't like a outsider telling you what to do but sometimes we see better from a step back.  Does anyone remember the ""Blue Pike"" in Lake Erie......the walleye can disappear on the Nip just as easily."
500021,crosshairs,2010-08-30 23:58:00,55,"There are some commercial guys who are selling non certified fish (not cleaned in a CFIA inspected facility) and those who aren't even part of the program. The non certified are counted, and the ""poachers"" fish are accounted for and are included in the quota. The First nation has a really good handle on the number of fish being caught, that is the main part of their whole purpose. They even publish their numbers, I beleive they had went over the quota alittle this past year. It was published by choice not need.  There are approx 20 boats, and the enforcement are out approximately 4-5 shifts per week. To be eligible for unemployment stamps fish must be purchased by the first nation.  The data set for lake nipissing has shown an increase in population for the past 13 years in all age classes, last year the numbers dropped off the map. Not just one age class (which could explain who was catching that size) but all age classes. This is whats being looked into at this time.  As for the age old fight of treaties and equal rights, these were government to goverment agreements produced by the crown to share the lands we lived on. There was no wars because of these treaties, and for the comment about stopping our subsidies, these are al part of the ttreaty as well as resource sharing which hasn't occured in canada yet. There is a site GLIFWIC which is a first nation run operation like ours except a much larger scale and funded throught the US revenue sharing agreement. I beleive it is in michigan. Very interesting site.  Take care all, I might not be for a couple days. New born in the house. lol"
500054,JimC,2010-08-31 00:59:00,86," Thanks for weighing in, HH, and for your positive thoughts re our family vacation.  The lady in Camp who filets Pike like a surgeon is also an amazing 'shore lunch' style cook,  so the entire Camp had a satisfying taste of Pickerel and Pike, deep fried to perfection.  re: Can someone here please tell me how opening up the Nip Pickereye market to many more sales opportunities is beneficial to the fishery?  Seems a bit of a contradiction of terms doesn't it?   Well my hope (and there has to be hope here) is that 'quotas' will be respected no matter what,  and that market price adjustments (up or down) will make the New retail / direct to Restaurant arrangement sustainable.   Of course buyers (joe public, and reputable restaurants) need to give the 'pickup truck' questionable fish handling / quality, a pass.  Hey, these dudes can get with the program and make more money for their catch.  re: Can anyone tell me how putting a biologist on their payroll is going to be beneficial to all parties interest? Ok, well imho, this is where 'trust' comes in ... and I trust that a Professional Biologist, has the integrity to carry out his work honestly (creel counts, etc), make tough recommendations (eg. reduce quotas), when necessary, to sustain the Walleye fishery,  and if NOT followed by NFN, resign.  re: Can anyone tell me how the local band is dealing with folks who are not participating in this operation and are simply loading up trucks to sell ""under the table"" My understanding is that the 'program' is voluntary, as it should be.  But those who choose to opt out, then abuse the fishery (gill netting during spawning ... then selling 'under the table') that risks the new retailing program, deserve to be shunned by the band, ignore them and their families ... peer pressure is powerful. Plus,  who is buying their questionable catch ... I for one, wouldn't touch any of it with a 10ft pole,  at any price.  Established, reputable restaurants won't touch it either.  re: What authority, if any do the band leaders have over folks who are not using the newly opened processing facility? What good is a biologist if they are only getting some of the info they need? Another good question, HH ...  pretty sure bet the Band leaders (and the Biologist) know full well who the ""under the table"" guys are, and what their approx. 'rape' ...er, harvest, would be.   Hey, its a small community in the big scheme of things.   I also believe that if the 2-retail outlet, and some limited direct sell to restaurants program is successful, more will opt in.  Why wouldn't they?"
500067,JimC,2010-08-31 01:28:00,86," Crosshairs ... As the initiator of this thread, I want to thank you for your 'insightful' and positive comments.  Your 'inside scoop' might help some here with strong opinions against NFN commercially selling pickerel, take a 'wait and see' approach.   As you said in an earlier post,  it's a good idea to ask questions and have an open discussion on this subject ... I certainly concur, so long as it remains respectful.  and Congrats on the 'newborn'.   As a recent first time Grandpa ... there's no feeling like it."
500077,Nipfisher,2010-08-31 01:42:00,2449,Congratulations Crosshairs. I sent you a PM.
500184,Headhunter,2010-08-31 13:54:00,5703,"Thanks to all who have replied to this topic. I appreciate the civil way this has been discussed. Emotions run high in these conversations and for good reason. That said, emotions certainly come into play when one party, who deems themselves to be the victim, find themselves having to ""trust"" the integrity and good will of their fellow man... throw money into the equation and well, trust goes right out of the window. As many have mentioned, the well being of the lake is of the utmost importance and it's health came be directly related to the commercial success of many diverse people and businesses. Lake Nip is owned by the population of Ontario. Currently, Ontario has a population of approximately 12.9 million, all of which has a right, under law to use the resource within the bounds of the law. Nipissing first nation has a population of approximately 2000 people... yet they have virtual control over fish stocks for the entire lake. There seems, to my simple mind anyway, to be a fair amount of disproportional representation in these numbers. I can't think of any other situation where such numbers could happen. I won't get into the whole treaty thing as, well, those agreements were signed at a time when they made sense to both sides based on circumstances of the day, but times have changed and ""progress"" for lack of a better word, has been made. Laws are amended all the time to reflect changes in our society, unfortunately there is NO POLITICAL WILL to do anything... it's a can of worms that no politician, at any level, wants to let out. Given that I personally can't do anything to influence this situation, I guess I will ""continue to hope"" that people will do the right thing... but my life experience has told me to not hold my breath... HH"
500207,JimC,2010-08-31 15:11:00,86,"HH @ 09:54am ...  Very good summary of what a lot of folks are feeling.  and since I started this topic, ditto for me re: your first point.  A couple of final points / comments: - the NFN have a golden opportunity to get top dollar for Lake Nipissing Pickerel (but also including Perch, (boneless) Pike, whitefish, etc) through proper use of the new, squeaky clean, government inspected cleaning station, and (two) retail outlets, that will be sustainable only if they LEAD THE WAY, in protecting the resource.   Politicians aren't the answer, and we know it.  -  the slot restriction on Walleye, for non-natives has to go ... at least in its present form.  It is too restrictive, and is the cause of much of the resentment that is festering, imho.   If an expanding commercial fishery is ok for the resource, then a one-per-day Pickerel of any size for non-natives is reasonable, and let's bump up the minimum to the rest of the Zone.   The inconsistency in the present situation is ridiculous.  -  Under certain circumstances, I would buy fish from the approved NFN retail outlets, and only there.  No ""under the table"" pickup trucks for me, thanks anyway.  -  I hope everyone reading this, and especially NFN band leaders pressure the Provincial Government to sanction a controlled cull of Cormorants.   I believe these birds are doing more damage to the fishery than we realize.   My understanding is that they are native to ocean coasts and have moved inland for easy pickings.   They are every bit a much of an 'invasive species' problem as a goby or what have you.    Cormorants begone.  - at $14+ per pound retail,  and $23+ for a dinner at an established North Bay restaurant, like Churchills, or Inn-on-the-Bay,   I can't see the working stiffs, seniors on fixed incomes, etc, in the area, gobling up all the Pickerel in the Lake anytime soon.    But, for the first time,  average folks in North Bay, Sturgeon Falls and area without means to fish themselves, can legitimately treat themselves to an occasional pickerel (or perch or pike) dinner they cook themselves.   I expect this thread to 'die' a natural death very soon;   however,  if anyone has anything new to bring to the table (no pun intended), then by all means,  resurrect it as you see fit.   Just my 2-cents worth.  Good fishing, all."
500241,Bernie,2010-08-31 16:30:00,3190,"Good posts guys. Allowing fish in the slot is defeating the original purpose of releasing them. Unfortunately this system will not work in the present situation. Shorter seasons or as Solo suggested a complete closure to ALL to allow fish stocks to rebuild. This won't happen either as the tourist operators depend on fishing seasons to operate. So what is the solution? Dang if I know. Years ago the season was closed through the winter and ice fishing wasn't allowed. Perhaps alternating closing seasons winter/summer? All I can honestly tell you is at the present pace, regardless of any biologists ""expert"" opinion (sorry), is that no one will have anything to catch in the near future."
500253,fishnsled,2010-08-31 17:40:00,3520,"  Well said Joe.  Good post guys, nice to see all the opinions on the subject.  I know that I will never buy a fish from a lake that I'm able to go out and get it for myself.  If I don't get it the steak will be fine on it's own.   I've had store bought walleye that others have bought and the taste is just not nearly as good as the ones you catch yourself. So for myself, why bother buying it?  For a lake that is hurting from both fishing pressure and netting something must be done.  But like others have said, what do you do?  What if anything can be done to keep everyone happy?  What will be done when the resource is gone???"
499217,ttreacy,2010-08-28 00:51:00,19,Hire a guid and go catvch some...it will cost a bit more but will be lots more fun.
499286,solopaddler,2010-08-28 11:04:00,8605,It's good meaning people like Jim C who are enabling the demise of the walleye fishery in lake Nipissing.
499348,Bernie,2010-08-28 16:44:00,3190, Agree fully here Solo.
499514,JimC,2010-08-29 15:16:00,86," whoa there, solo ...  pretty sure I kinda resent your comment, on so many levels  ... (and this, despite the really, really complimentary comment I made on your recent 'Eddie Norths Attiwapiskat adventure' thread)  First let me say that we just returned from a fantastic family vacation on Lake Nip, (Camp La Plage, as was asked above), maybe THE most fun week (after 30+) that we've had.  Having our first (and only) grandchild along to experience his first 'cottaging adventure' made it very special.  About the fishing ... as it turned out, there were lots of nice Pike brought in, and a few nice Walleye (including a 28 incher), and the Perch even turned on for awhile;  a HUGE Camp-wide potluck pigout made it unnecessary to drive into North Bay to purchase pickerel.   A lady from Camp is an absolute surgeon when it comes to the 5-cut boneless Pike fileting method;  so everyone, including the kids had their fill, worry free about ingesting a fish bone.   Every single family in Camp, contributed to our massive feast.  solo ... specific to your comment and what it infers ... t least you referred to me as 'good meaning' but in the context you are using, I find it rather condescending ... you know, like I mean well, but my actions (if I chose to buy a few filets of NFN harvested Walleye) would enable the demise of the fishery.  Do you really believe that?  Lets talk facts ... NFN are entitled by treaty to net fish.  They have been doing it for hundreds of years and it's going to continue.  Ultimately, enforcing critical areas such as 'quotas' and 'a moratorium on netting during spawning season' falls on the Chief and her council.  I did some research of found this  >>>  http://www.nfn.ca/land_fish.php  <<<    Be sure to check out the four video links posted, in addition to the text, and make your own conclusions.  Based on Nipfisher's comment on pg1 of this thread ... 30 Walleye outing by a friend ... I'm not sure the Walleye fishery is close to demise?  But if you believe it is, and want to talk about 'enabling' that eventuality,  then you might want to give appropriate Ontario Government Agency heads a call and voice your concerns.  There was recently a picture in the Nugget of Nipissing Ontario Liberal MPP Monique Smith, cutting the ribbon at the new NFN fish cleaning facility.   Other funding groups are mentioned via the link above, on the NFN website. Part of the recent agreements and funding was to enable (there's that word again), NFN selling directly to local (and not so local) restaurants.   Pretty sure that Churchills and Inn-On-The-Bay are dishing out way way more Walleye in a day, than my family would consume in a year.  And what about the thousands upon thousands of those Big, black rat Cormorants still alive and well all over the Lake ... I'm sure more than me has noticed the dramatic decrease in perch and bluegill stocks, since their arrival in huge numbers several years ago.   In the shallower areas of the Lake,  Fish vs Cormorant is No Contest.  Does this relatively new problem affect the larger fish?  Pretty sure it does.  Call the MNR and demand a controlled cull,  and all you get is a lot of nothin.   Is this Ont Government Ministry not then enabling the demise of the Walleye (by lack of specific action)?   Makes ya go hmmmmmmm ... doesn't it.  I'm betting most everyone reading this has personal knowledge of non-natives who routinely make multiple daily outings in the spring, stuff their freezers full of Walleye filets, where (4) is the per license limit,  and maybe ignore the 'slot',  and think nothing of it.   Gee, I wonder if its only a couple, or maybe a whole lot, who do this,  and maybe they are enabling the eventual demise of the fishery, as you say.  So its complicated, but I believe the NFN have a vested interest in keeping the overall fishery healthy and sustainable.  If they don't control their part,  then they and we will all lose.   I don't blame them for wanting to make a decent living for their family, by getting market price for their catch,  preferably in an above board open retail outlet(s), and not out of the back of a pickup truck.    On the other hand, if quotas are not respected, and the Chief and council can't control it,  then they, and the Ont. Government who enabled the present situation have only themselves to blame.  hey, I said goin in that this thread would be controversial."
499522,solopaddler,2010-08-29 15:57:00,8605,"  Do I really believe that?  Absolutely unequivocally 100% yes.         It's not complicated at all as far as I'm concerned.  They're not controlling their part Jim. It's happening right before our eyes and yes we're all losing, both natives and non natives alike."
499527,canadadude,2010-08-29 16:18:00,769,"Well said JimC the NFN seem to be the only organised group actually studying and coming up with a plan to protect and improve the Nippissing Walleye populations.Instead of all the mud slinging coming from Tourist operators and sport fishers, they should maybe get on board and help.Everyone has a vested interest in the fishery,maybe it's time everyone got together and developed a decent plan to sustain the populations. IMO the natives are the only ones doing this."
499769,Nipfisher,2010-08-30 04:39:00,2449,"Jim, I'm glad you and your family enjoyed Nipissing and the fish cooperated. I will just say that I enjoyed a combination of caught and bought Nipissing walleye last night. I couldn't taste the difference  I love fishing on Nipissing and when I go out and get skunked it would be easy to blame the natives but I blame the fish.  Maybe if we would pay $14 per pound for the Cormorants we wouldn't have any problems.  I can see this thread getting locked now  as it really has no where positive to go. Thanks for the thread Jim, I hope you're returning next year.  Blair"
499783,Billy Bob,2010-08-30 11:12:00,5865,"When someone like me (from outside the area) reads about commercial fishing on the Nip, we think twice before making any plans to fish the area. What once was a great fishery that I experienced several times out of Sturgeon Falls back in the 70's now only seems like a memory by many of the readings here. That's only my honest opinion but it's also my money I'm spending when looking for a fishing vacation. So with that said I will never again bother to fish the Big Nip in future Ontario fishing trips.  Commercial fishing is never a good thing for any area, even the ocean is hurting with many species being over fished, like the Blue Tuna.  Lake Erie is raped by commercial nets and the Big Nip is a much more delicate water column to be gill netted. What's the difference what color the people are who set the nets as they do their destruction without hesitation.  I'm very sorry to say that different rules for different people will ALWAYS divide us against each other. That's the real problem with this world and by the time (if ever) we recognize that it will be too late for the Big Nip and other bodies of water. Bob"
499790,OhioFisherman,2010-08-30 11:33:00,6623,14 bucks a pound for walleye? LOL give me two steaks! Heck that is 6 cans of spam! Buying fish? uncivilized!
499792,Bernie,2010-08-30 11:56:00,3190,"As one who has been on the lake all my life I can say that at the present pace of fishing, be it netting or fishermen, the fish population in the lake is just a mere fraction of it's former self. It cannot sustain the pressure. Yes, there are those that are catching fish but try it without a depth sounder or a GPS. Personally I would never buy a pickerel. To each their own I guess."
499800,canadadude,2010-08-30 12:37:00,769,"The problems on the lake go far beyond native netting, which has gone on for 100's of years, the whole lake is under great pressure.There are way to many tourist operators tapping the resource, the winter fishery exploded in the last decade with 1000's of huts, bungalos you name it.Everyone seems to want a piece of the dwindling fishery so to blame one single type of use is vastly unfair.To sustain the fishery everyone with a vested interest needs to come together and work towards a common goal.I commend the Natives for at least hiring a biologist and attempting to manage the fishery.Like I said before they seem to be the only vested group doing anything to study and improve the fishery.Now if the tourist operators and sportfishermen climbed on board instead of waiting for the government to do something perhaps the fishery would improve."

Same with Pointe Au Baril in 1964, they were working on the highway, roads off of it in some cases weren`t much more than rock and sand.  Nip was an adventure, the modern highway system has made it easy to get to, same with most of southern Ontario. Sure netting has had it`s adverse affects, but so has the growth of cottage country. You mix in people in areas that had little fishing pressure, today`s technology, and it isn`t hard to figure why fish populations go down.  Every camp I ever stayed at had a weekly fish fry for the guests, x all season? x every camp in the area? mix in shore lunches? then mix in the lake shore cottage owners and residents that eat fish every time they go there?  Is it a wonder the best fishing for certain species now involves a fly in trip? Limited access and facilities?"

499879,OhioFisherman,2010-08-30 18:13:00,6623,"Nip, Roy nailed it. Bass fishing is better here than in the 50`s - 80`s for one reason alone, catch and release. You don`t give out spots here, every one can see when you catch fish! 150 bass boats on a lake 1500-3000 acres, plus the week end anglers doesn`t leave much room to hide. Most of the guys here that know what they are doing know if you fished one area of a lake? they can find your spot.  Lake Erie? just massive, but there are certain areas that produce smallies and walleye more often than not. On this side the state buying out the commercial walleye fishermen and an improvement in water quality turned the fishery around. A longer growing season, and more bait fish than you can shake a stick at helps.  Just my view that here some changes to the regs could help? I don`t see a need for people to keep a limit of 8-10 pound walleye in the fall, or a limit of 20+ inch smallies for a mount."
499887,canadadude,2010-08-30 18:57:00,769,"By opening up the fishery to commercial sales the native fishery is now regulated and has brought employment and much needed monies to band. Now that the NFN treat there fishery as a business it has brought regulations and quotas.With a business comes $$$$$$ and the band has a vested interest in not poaching and ruining the fishery, if other band members are poaching,selling fish under the table I'm sure the band in some way will deal with it.The poaching not only hurts the fishery but also the profits the band makes legally and if it hurts there business they will deal with it. By putting a Biologist on the payroll they are in fact studying there resource and making smart decsions in order to keep a sustainable harvest.I don't see tourist operators looking into allowable harvest, the number of ice fisherman on the lake, tha amount of fish harvested by there clients all I here from them is alot of mudslinging and blame."

What if any, are the ramifications of them telling the band to go pound salt, I got a family to feed. -I recall reading about some tourist operators getting involved with the stocking program in an effort to help with sustainability - I believe I read it here. -the tourist operators help to enforce the slot limit and every one I have been to has taken me aside to ensure that I have all the knowledge I need to make the right decision. They don't want me to get fined for having slot fish... - the regs only discuss the catching, cleaning and storage of fish and do not address the number of fish being caught and kept. -comparing Lake Erie to Nip is like comparing North Bay's traffic snarls to that of Toronto... there is simply no comparisson.  So far, unfortunately I am only hearing about how this will positively affect the band members, I am not able to quantify how this will help non band members who have a vested interest in the fishery."
499897,Terry,2010-08-30 19:31:00,14456, I don't buy that argument  the bands will take what they want when they want.........and they have the right I will not argue that.....but not to sell.....   not in Nip. but another lake the gov. bought some of the commercial licenses off some natives to help save the fish  the next week the owners brother use the boat to fish .......I am afraid the more we allow them to sell the more they will sell..the less for us  and we keep stocking fish so they can be sell back to us........ I see nothing good coming from that
499905,crosshairs,2010-08-30 19:51:00,55,"The vested interest the First Nation (we) have is that if the walleye population plummets so do the treaty rights of us as well as our future generations. If the stocks of fish are proven to be in danger, there is case law where communities have lost their right.  As for what powers cheif and council have over band members, the treaty was not signed by all us band members, it was signed on behalf of a community which makes these rights cummunal rights. The community wanted action done, they voted and now there are laws and regulations in place.  All must keep in mind this is a work in progress, every year the regulations have been updated to close loop holes found, and to deal with new issues that arise. A biologist being hired, regulations, enforcement, assessment work being completed is all benefits to the lake. Quota was reduced this year due to our FWIN results, if quota is reduced again price will go up again. Less fish doesn't mean less $$$ for the fisherman.  All this work is being done because the community wanted it, no outside influence had a say in any of this work being completed by the first nation. Assessment work being done is not just on walleye (like the ontario government was doing) but on Pike, Bass, Musky, Whitefish to get a better picture of what the whole ecosystem is doing.  I see no reason to shut this thread, this is how information is shared and how people learn. There is nothing wrong with questions.  In the end we all want the same thing, a healthy productive lake to enjoy for many generations.  Take care all."
499910,canadadude,2010-08-30 20:09:00,769,"The idea of hiring a Bias or unobjective Biologist serves absolutly no purpose,they could just fish without it,the fact they have somebody sampling and studying the health of the lake shows that they are commited to a sustainable fishery. The imformation the biologist gathers helps everyone on the lake, it studies the quality of the lake fishery and does not distinguish between native or non-native its all about the fishery. I am not a band member and I have no idea how they deal with poaching.It is illegal however for anyone including band members to sell fish from the back of there truck,it always has been and I'm not sure of the law concerning restaraunts selling poached fish.If this is happening it's breaking of provincial laws and perhaps the provincial police should be the ones dealing with it.I really don't know if the band or the province or perhaps a combination of the 2 should be enforcing the laws.  It's in the best interest of the tourist operators to educate there visitors of the regulations it's bad business if your clients get busted for not knowing the rules.As for enforcment of the regulations I'm not so sure many outfitters are on board with that.  I did here some rumblings of stocking and such, but that was just talk and when push came to shove nobody got on board, somthing about stocking fish so the natives would catch them to sell pulled the plug. I mean the thing is the non-natives want the native commercial fishery to stop and the natives want the non-native comercial enterprises to stop.Both sides have reasonable arguments and good points, I think for the health of the fishery both sides should get together and work out compromises and instead of always playing a blame game get out and work on the fishery"
499912,canadadude,2010-08-30 20:12:00,769,Thankyou well said and I learned alot more
499913,Billy Bob,2010-08-30 20:14:00,5865,"Crosshairs has made some VERY good points.....it's a start but there is one thing that bothers me. The ""slot limit""...if I catch a fish in the slot I have to release said fish only for that same fish to be caught in the gill nets and be harvested for SALE. What's the difference if I purchase that slot fish or keep it and eat it. Either way it's not reproducing in the lake.  Just to make things a little bit fair in Nip......the slot limit should go or am I not seeing something here."
499918,solopaddler,2010-08-30 20:51:00,8605," Of course it's not fair.  One group is allowed free rein, the other is forced to abide by laws and regulations.  Don't expect anything to change until it's too late.  Crosshair neglected to mention the other native anglers who are selling fish in roadside stands and out of the back of their trucks.  How are they being regulated?  Don't tell me that's not happening because I've seen it.  Nipissing has been one of the top tourist destinations in ON and has been for generations.  It's value both economic and intrinsic is priceless.  It boggles my mind that government would allow such a decline.  Yes overharvest by non natives has also played a role (especially in winter), but no one can tell me that the leading cause of the decline in the walleye fishery isn't native netting.  This topic has been hashed and rehashed so many times it makes me nauseous even replying to this.  It's been said before but until the natives in this country stop getting subsidized by our government and integrate fully with the rest of society they will continue to be this countries leading social problem.  If any of you liberal minded people really believe that we can all work together (natives and non natives alike) to create a healthier, stronger fishery in Nippissing then you're deluded.  You're living a dream world.  In order for the lake to bounce back to historical levels drastic measures need to be taken.  If it was up to me I'd ban all netting and put a 10 year moratorium on all winter fishing.  Unfortunately that's never going to happen."
494917,JimC,2010-08-16 15:08:00,86,"I realize this topic may be controversial, but please take it at face value.  My family and I will be vacationing at a lodge in the Sturgeon Falls / Verner area next week. This is an annual trip, but in recent years we have not had much success catching Walleye (pickerel) and really miss the unmistakable smell of fresh pickerel frying in the kitchen.  I understand that pickerel can be sold legally by First Nations fisherman, but where is the best place to get it?  Anyone tried some?   I must admit that I would not have considered going this route in years past,  but with the water where we will be only a couple (few) feet deep I know our chances of catching Walleye is Zippo.   I am not willing to go miles across the lake in unfamiliar waters ... just too many rocks in play .. I also heard about logs.   So spending $40 (or whatever) for some fresh pickerel fillets seems a safer route.  The obvious concern is that by purchasing walleye, caught by gill nets is only enabling the further decline of fish stocks. I don't know if this is true or not,  but I like to think that the commercial harvesting is being done with the future in mind?  Last year we caught ONE Walleye for the entire week.  It was a nice 20 incher, but we abide by the slot, took a quick picture, and released it.   Very frustrating, but the law is the law.    So what other choice do we have,  if we want to enjoy one good pickerel feed while on vacation?  I guess one option is to find a good restaurant that has Lake Nipissing pickerel on its menu.   Any recommendations of good restaurants in Sturgeon Falls, Cache Bay, over to Lavigne?    It think I saw a small ma and pa looking place advertising Pickerel Dinners just outside North Bay (heading towards Sturgeon) on the right.   Anyone eaten there?  Any feedback is appreciated.    Please PM me, if not wanting to post to this thread.   thanks a lot.  ... Jim"
494918,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 15:12:00,154,"I have your sentiments, just down the highway from me we sometimes buy pickeral cheeks from Tarini Bros, usaully a 1lb bag of cheeks, as to your diner question I'm not sure, but someone here could most likely help."
494929,Nipfisher,2010-08-16 16:13:00,2449," Jim, No one should take offence to this thread. It is an honest question on how to buy legally caught walleye from a legitimate source. They will keep netting and selling and this will not hinge on your purchase.  To answer your questions.....There are 2 places that I know of that sell the fresh Lake Nipissing Walleye. One is the fish market at the North Bay waterfront (old boat) and the second is the a Fresh Meat and Fish store which is just a few minutes West of North Bay on the left hand side of the highway when heading to Sturgeon Falls. I have heard tremendous reports about the quality of the fish and meats (awesome steaks) from this store. Next answer is restaurants....there are 2 on the highway between North Bay and Sturgeon Falls. One is the Eagle's Nest Restaurant and gas Station. They have ""fresh pickeral dinners nightly"" and there is also another place called Chester's Shore lunch that I belive sells fresh pickeral. There are alot of restaurants in North bay that lists Fresh Nipissing Pickeral on their menus. I assume there are some places in Sturgeon and West towards Verner. Good luck.  Don't give up on Lake Nipissing walleye fishery. The West end is challenging this year due to low water but Callander Bay and South Shore areas are still producing. My friend had a 30 walleye outing on Callander Bay last week, and  my neighbor caught a nice 27""er at Iron Island on Friday.  Blair"
494975,Joey,2010-08-16 18:01:00,9122,"I know Kevin orders in fresh pickerel for his guests at Lakair, why not give him a call?  He can probably point you in the right direction.  Joey"
495044,Kinger,2010-08-16 19:32:00,351,I will never buy gill net fish.  NEVER.
495046,Muskieman,2010-08-16 19:35:00,2472,Walleye fillets to be had at almost every smoke shop on hwy 17 between North Bay and Sturgeon.  Randy 
495047,Roy,2010-08-16 19:35:00,13728,Almost every fish you buy has been netted.
495048,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 19:37:00,154,"yup, unless its salmon, they're mostly farmed"
495096,blarg,2010-08-16 20:27:00,289," Well golly gee then where do I get a net and a permit to net a lake?  If you can't find pickeral from a store you could always follow a net boat around nipissing and pick up the by catch, some of it might be edible.    I watched a net boat yesterday i didn't see them catch a single pickeral but they did pull a couple dozen of those, maybe a white sucker, out of the net and throw them back to the gulls.  Surely they don't do they same with other species of fish while taking part in this traditional power boat gill net stringently managed fishery.    But hey every fish you eat is gill netted on lakes like Nipissing so no harm done."
495101,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 20:32:00,154,"I believe thats a shorthead redhorse, I catch them frequently, they share habitat with pickerel"
495225,JimC,2010-08-17 00:29:00,86,"thanks for the feedback so far,  folks;  some really good tips for us to check out next week.  and like I said at the outset,  this subject was bound to be controversial,  and I totally understand those who say they would NEVER buy pickerel that have been taken on Lake Nipissing by gill nets.   I myself have been in this camp till now,  but am now leaning towards buying some from a 'certified' location,  so our family can enjoy 'a taste'  while on vacation.  note to Nip ... thanks for your lengthy and informative reply; I'll try not to give up on Lake Nip for catching our own pickerel ... it is encouraging to know that folks you know have had recent success bagging some Pickerel in high numbers, in Calender Bay,  and the biggie at Iron Island.   I've actually fished at Iron Is. a few years back, and we got some nice jumbo Perch there,  but didn't see any Walleye.   If we get some light wind conditions maybe we'll give it another shot?   If not ... then I'm likely visiting one of those places you mentioned.  ;-)"
495428,Mike Pike,2010-08-17 16:06:00,1332,"Hey Jim, I think your problem is negative thinking!  lol  You're already looking for a place to buy walleye in anticipation of not catching any!  Who was it that said; ""Confidence is the best lure you can have in your tackle box!""  Hey, good luck to you and family!"
495431,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 16:11:00,154,"  I like that saying, just keep dropping lines, the pickerel are there, you just have to look, making the catch even more worth it"
495442,canadadude,2010-08-17 16:24:00,769,"Here's an idea buy some commercial walleye and support the locals and practice catch and release supporting the fishery, a win/win solution hahahaha"

495533,JimC,2010-08-17 19:23:00,86," well Mike,  you may have a point there, but I'd rather call it 'good vacation planning'  ...  in any case,  I think we will try our luck first,  and if unsuccessful (even with all that new found Confidence), by say, mid-week,  then it might just be an early morning trip to that place on Hwy 17 between Sturgeon and North Bay.    and thanks for the well wishes ... I know we will have fun regardless of the fishing,  just like that big OFC get-together early in the season."
495567,JimC,2010-08-17 21:32:00,86," pikeguy - we usually troll or drift on the west side of the Hardwoods / Little Oak out to the marker buoy,  and over towards Pine Island / Pickerel Rock,  so Hay Narrows is within reach;  we've avoided that area, based on reports that there are a crazy amount of prop eating rocks lurking.  But where isn't there rocks this year?   If we do venture over there,  I assume your tip 'around the target' will become obvious?  btw, our gang will eat Pike (nice handle you have there), so if we can't scare up any pickerel, we may throw out some spoons and spinner-baits and maybe we'll do ok, in the Pike department?     thanks for your input."
495570,pikeguy,2010-08-17 21:49:00,195," not a problem always willing to help out on the west arm. I'm a spinner bait lover for pike and do very  well with them on nipp, have done well with the purple/white red/white, and on covered days i use the green/yellow, green/bright green and on all of them i will use a 4"" gulp minnow or smelt they work well for me and in other threads i have some pics from that spot. Grab a map and you can check out the canoe pass. There are lots of rocks i will not lie but for the most part they have bean marked some that i did not know about and some that i did stay to the water that you know and you will be safe. From the tip of oak to the narrows is a safe trip and you can find Musky in that area as well  good luck and happy fishing"
495844,JimC,2010-08-18 17:40:00,86," thanks for the info,  but I would never buy any ""Fresh"" pickerel (or any other supposedly fresh food item) from a ""smoke shop"".   The only places I'd consider buying walleye fillets from are those that have 'restaurant standards"" certification, and are regularly inspected by the power-to-be. Period.   For sure that's not the cheapest route ... I had since learned that they're getting $14.99 per pound.  Yikes! ... but at least it is guaranteed only hours out of the water.  Joey ... thanks for the additional option re Lakair lodge ... something else to consider  and thanks again Pikeguy, for the very detailed info, to help us catch our own (Pike or walleye).   much appreciated"
495878,nuke,2010-08-18 19:11:00,60,"Hey JimC.  You staying at camp LaPlage?  If so, and you don't mind pike, try surface lures (something like a torpedo, crazy crawler or jitter bug).  Lots of pike and bass at dusk in the bays and weed beds. Good luck to you and yours and have fun.  As for suporting the local walleye fishery.............  Randy, any eyes left down the dams?"
496433,JimC,2010-08-20 14:05:00,86," hey nuke,   sent you a PM,  and thanks for the tip.  Thanks to everyone for their thoughts on the original questions about actually Buying Walleye / Pickerel,  either fresh or at a recommended restaurant.  In addition to Eagles Nest, I have learned there are at least two North Bay restaurants (Churchills,  Inn-on-the-Bay) in North Bay that are featuring Lake Nipissing Pickerel on their menus.  It ain't cheap ($24 range) but what is these days. The cost of fresh pickerel fillets at the NFN outlets (I tracked down a phone number) also surprised me at $14.99 a pound. But that is not far from what the larger food chains are charging ($11-13 per lb. in S. Ont),  and they can't tell you where the Pickerel came from (most likely Manitoba or lake erie).  So the jury is still out on whether I'm going to pick up a few Pickerel filets (at The Boat or NFN store on Hwy 17) en route to our impending cottage rental ... will be a last minute call.     Thanks again for the input on this thread."
499147,crosshairs,2010-08-27 19:58:00,55,"Jim C  There are alot of places that advertise lake nipissing walleye, and smoke shops along the highway that have them. The certified fish you are looking for all come with a certification label, and the restuaraunts who are selling the walleye will have a banner, or some other form of this certification label on display just Ask for it. On the reserve there is just R&J's meat market, another located at the water front in north bay is the old cheif fish market. All the fish sold at these 2 establishments are sustainably caught, and cleaned in conditions that meet CFIA standards. All fish are iced immediately when they come out of the water. They supply the restaurants that have certified lake nipissing wallaye.  The other locations who cannot provide proof of the certification label are not cleaned or caught under the same conditions. Some are on the back of pickup trucks, others on plywood etc, are the fish iced?? no one knows, how long were the nets in the water, how long were the fish out of water prior to going to establishments there are alot of unknowns with the un certified fish.  As for the certified, the fisherman have regulations, and there are quality expectations they must meet. I see an establishments name mentioned earlier about walleye cheeks etc, I'll just say if people seen where these fish were cleaned the health units would be getting calls."
