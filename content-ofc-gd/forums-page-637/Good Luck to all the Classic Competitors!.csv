Classic Champs 2009 Cory and Chris Johnston www.luresandtours.com   Hundreds of anglers from across Ontario are descending on the Haliburton’s this weekend, in preparation for the upcoming Bassmania classic to be held on September 3, 4 & 5. Practice is allowed as of Saturday August 28th, and most anglers will be taking advantage of every day to learn this challenging body of water.  Speculation is that the five-bass limits are gong to be lighter than past classics, but you never know what will happen when that many great anglers concentrate their efforts on a multifaceted body of water that makes of the Haliburton chain of lakes. In fact it is not such a small body of water as there are several lakes that anglers can choose to fish including Head Lake, Grass Lake, Kashagawigamog Lake, Soyers Lake and Canning Lake all accessible to the anglers that wish to fish them. These lakes have both small mouth and large mouth bass in them, but I speculate it will be smallies that win the tournament. A largemouth after the second day will be pretty hard to come by as most shallow cover will have been thoroughly worked over by day three.  Even though these lakes can be tough to fish it will still be a great competition; all the anglers will be fishing the same lakes under the same conditions. I suspect there will be a few donuts (zero fish weighted-in) over the three day classic, and the final winning three day total limit of bass may be just over 30 pounds. Consistency is going to be key, and anglers will have to be happy with days where five bites are all they get.  Up for grabs for the winners of the classic is two $25,000 Lund Boat Certificates. Second to twentieth place will compete for thousands of dollars in prize money. Each day’s big fish pool will be about $1,000 for any lucky angler that catches the day’s biggest fish.  Attending the weigh-in is free for spectators (bring a chair!). Weigh-ins will be held at the town docks in Haliburton from 4pm till 5pm each day. The final day will see an exciting drive by weigh-in process with only twenty anglers fishing for the top prize.  Congrats to all the teams that qualified, and good luck to all entrants. Be safe.  Tight Lines, Andrew"

It will be interesting to see how the power boat catches stack up against the those from the Haliburton Kayak Fishing Classic that was just held there on those same five lakes this past weekend.  and yes, good luck to all!"
