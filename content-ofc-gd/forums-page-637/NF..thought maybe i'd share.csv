500476,bushart,2010-09-01 12:24:00,2628,Really cool Mercman...Soon us old painters will be gone with the dinosaurs when you can produce work like this.
500494,ketchenany,2010-09-01 13:24:00,3229, But can you paint a ceiling? great work Mercman
500501,bushart,2010-09-01 13:46:00,2628,  Ya'll mean like Michaelangelo??
500517,mercman,2010-09-01 14:45:00,7054, most of them are done in Vue d'Esprit. I like the hd realism in the finished product. Some are in Bryce. i post process my images in photoshop or photoimpact.
500518,mercman,2010-09-01 14:49:00,7054,"  NO WAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i envy those who can do this by hand. Nothing beats oil, or pastels, or pencil. My only talent is my imagination and the ability to manipulate pixels."

500570,blaque,2010-09-01 17:13:00,2419," Sorry, i literally thought he was referring to a location where these images derived from. Thought it was a french canadian thing"
