I had an excellent day on Cooks Bay last week so I've been focusing a lot out there as I've been on them good every day for the last week now.  Most of my success has come flippin pads and cane using jigs and ""power-shotting"" Strike Zone Slammers and DartWorms. My dad and I had a good day fishing a small Muskoka lake and I reunited with an old friend for a day on Balsam Lake today!  Here's the fish porn!        smallie on Simcoe..flippin the cane.  First time for everything   "
