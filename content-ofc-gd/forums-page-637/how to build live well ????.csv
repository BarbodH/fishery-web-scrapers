499963,skinny,2010-08-30 22:28:00,442,my boat doesn't have a live well in it but I have been thinking of building one just not sure how to go about it. How big should it be ? what to make it out of ? what to use for pumps to get water in and out (not sure I want to put a hole in my hull)  so looking for pros cons and such
499976,Billy Bob,2010-08-30 22:55:00,5865,Don't know what your boat looks like or how much room you have to work with but I would seriously consider making one out of a cooler that can either be built in or carried out of the boat.  Bob
500024,Fisherpete,2010-08-31 00:02:00,1814,"Yep, the cooler route is the easiest... BPS and many other tackle shops sell an aerator kit that you can get for cooler livewells. I had one before and it worked very well. It was around $35 if I can remember correctly."
500137,Roy,2010-08-31 10:47:00,13728,"The others have it right. If you absolutely need a livewell, use the appropriate sized cooler. IMHO, unless you're doing live release tournaments, a livewell is useless. If you're a C&R guy you don't need a livewell. If you want to keep a fish or three for dinner, you're best to dispatch the fish and put it on ice. I have a 42"" livewell on my boat and it is now a storage compartment for tackle. If I need to have minnows aboard for any length of time, I use a cooler with a $35 aerator kit. But that's just me...."

500161,aniceguy,2010-08-31 12:48:00,1094,"building one is complicated but here it goes if your into it, You need to source out a rotational moulder ( there is one in Mississauga ) find the right tank you ll have to build a base of 2x2 to sit it on and fll the cvavity with rigid foam. Cut the top of the tank to fit a hatch of some sort and make sure its supported on all sides, ( if your looking for 30 gallon plus I also suggest some sort of baffle system to prevent water sloshing) 2 500g water pumps and 1/2 inch abs piping secure 1 pump to the bottom and one pump close to where you intend to have a water intake ( it might require a hole in your boat below the water line ) run the power from a battery to both pumps and some sort of toggle switch run the plumbing from the pump out somewhere outside of your boat ( requiring another hole ) source out the fittings for the hull attach them and your good to go.  Sounds like a lot of work but a solid afternoon and its done. the cooler though is about 30 seconds to buy"
