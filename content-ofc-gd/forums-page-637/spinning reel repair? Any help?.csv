500747,sconceptor,2010-09-02 02:21:00,146,"I have a 04 Shimano Symetre 4000 which is on the fritz.  It starts to knock and reel heavily every so often.  I tried to relube it, but it didn't help.  Only thing that fixes it, is put it in reverse for a few cranks and it goes back to normal.  Any clues on why that would happen?  It's a nice reel to have on the go this time of year, when chucking heavy spoons of the end of the piers.  I'm not sure if Fletcher's up in Shallow Lake would be able to fix it.  He's a little busy these days with the derby going on, and I'd like it back the same day to save on the driving.  Hope to get some help.  Thanks a lot!!!"
