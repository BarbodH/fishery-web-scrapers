I really didn't want to deal with the traffic though  So we decided to stay at my house instead, and fish a different local lake each day in the morning.  Then play some golf in the afternoons.  Maybe a few bonfires in the backyard in the evenings.  A mens weekend  I think we're going to hit Georgian Bay Saturday.  ???? Sunday, and Simcoe (cooks bay) Monday.  I want to try a new lake in Muskoka/Kawarthas on Sunday.  I've fished 6-mile, and Sparrow.  I want to try something new.  I would really like to get into some walleye.  What are my chances of hooking into some walleye on Rice Lake??  We'll those are my plans.  What are yours?  Any help on getting me into some eyes would be great!  I live in Barrie, and don't want to drive more then an hour or so.  Thanks Folks!"

I’ll be on Team Canada for the third straight time, aiming to bring home our third straight victory against the American carpers.  48 straight hours of no sleep, chucking bait into the water at 100 yards and hopefully tons of fish fighting.

I don't generally fly fish so it should be fun. His bride to be's family have a house just outside the city on a lake that holds small brookies. Last time I was their the biggest boated was about a pound. It won't be an extreme Nfld fishing trip with monster brook trout, but should be fun anyway."
