499832,PHISHY!,2010-08-30 15:41:00,24,"Hey guys,  My pops turned 60 this weekend and I was going to get him a full day charter for some trophy walleys's either on Lake Erie or Ontario (BOQ area).  I've been looking at the charters, both from what I could find off Google and also from this site, but so many of them are no longer in business or don't give enough information on their sites, not to mention all the American ones.  I'm pleading for some help!  Can anyone recommend a charter outfit for 4 guys on any Great Lake for some early Fall Walleye fishin'?  I figured my trusty OFC brethren would be the perfect ones to ask!  Thanks!!"

499949,ch312,2010-08-30 22:09:00,1590,"they have been nailing the walleye with quite a few bows off burwell. some are saying this is the best year they've seen for a while and there are tons of reports to prove it.  here is what i just read on another board. i believe the name is wild reels and they are out of burwell. but, any reputable charter near burwell will put you into fish. all these pics of full fish boxes are hard to look at when you cant make it out to prime waters...  ""well all I can really say is WOW! that fishing is on fire! 6 trips in a row with catches like this! limiting out full boxes in 2 hrs, the action is absolutely insane! its nice to leave the dock after 7 setup around 8sh and be swimming with the clients just shortly after 10, a great way to end a season off thats for sure!"""
