500028,EC1,2010-08-31 00:10:00,930,"Thanks for sharing! Too bad about the car, hope everything ends up ok and karma comes around! I can't believe that there are perch in Europe too!  Do you know what kind of trouts are the same in Europe too?"
500029,bassman87,2010-08-31 00:10:00,586,sorry to hear about the thieves (they suck) what a crappy scene to return to
500031,Gregoire,2010-08-31 00:13:00,1397,Sorry about the car. Spent a week outside of Tours a few summers ago at a friends Aunt's house. Your pics reminded me of the good times.
500034,bigugli,2010-08-31 00:16:00,6138,Sorry to hear about the car.  Airport lots are anything but secure. Beautiful countryside for exploring. Thanks for the pics. That lad is sure growing some. The face and red hair say pure mischief in the making
500042,Pigeontroller,2010-08-31 00:25:00,2793,"Great pics, thanks for sharing, very cool looking area!"
500062,ehg,2010-08-31 01:19:00,2666,Looks like a great time was had! Real nice place your folks have in France
500076,Leecher,2010-08-31 01:41:00,7832,"Awesome trip, pics & videos Simon From all of the pics you posted in this report.... this one has to be my favorite  Man is little Jack ever growing fast.... and looks like you two are having a blast  Thanks for taking the time to put this report together and sharing your trip with us!!!  On a side note..... As-tu eu l'opportuniter d'apprendre quelques mots en Fran√ßais le temps que tu as passer en France??  Hope you understand.... if not, I'll translate for you Again welcome back and thanks for sharing Jacques"
500081,moparhawk,2010-08-31 01:50:00,146,"Awesome Simon. Hey sometimes Jack looks like Mom then sometimes like you, but the older he gets I think he favors ole dad. Ha ha your dad laid back in his coveralls. Sweeeet! We should all be so lucky. Thanks for sharing"
500090,limeyangler,2010-08-31 02:01:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies guys, aalways appreciated.    What bothers me is karma is a 2 way thing, i must have done something pretty crappy...lol....dunno what it was though.  the perch in Europe are  Perca fluviatilis whereas in N. America they are Perca flavescens. Whilst the N.american yellow perch get big i think the european ones get bigger  BRITISH RECORD PERCH OVER 5LBS    As for trout i think you generally get most of the species you get here, with a few you cant get here.    LOL...i know Tours, used to miss the turn to the highway everytime whislt driving down from England, spent alot of time in one way systems in that town!    Thanks Bruce, yup...trouble is on the way!"
500094,Joey,2010-08-31 02:07:00,9122,"What a great place your parents have, very cool!!  Great pictures Simon, really enjoyed those  Joey"
500103,Nipfisher,2010-08-31 02:24:00,2449,Welcome back Simon. Missed your posts and vids. Jack is getting big and I cant get over the red hair. Karter turned 17 months old today. He has fallen down the stairs and split his lip open in the last few days. He is a BUSY boy. Glad you had a nice trip. Sucks about the car.  Blair
500126,Gerry,2010-08-31 05:11:00,257,"Nice report and too bad about the car.  My daughter and son-in-law just got back from a 16 day honeymoon trip to France and Spain. They visited places like Paris, Dijon, Chamonix, Annesi, Carcasonne, San Sebastien and Madrid....just saw some of the pics last night and all I can say is I'm going there someday."
500176,Blue Lk,2010-08-31 13:38:00,337,"That's a long way from the shores of Wabigoon Lk,great pics. Wpg is becoming the crime city of Canada,sorry about your vehicle."
500202,Rattletrap2,2010-08-31 14:49:00,1652,"Limeyangler, I'll be the first to admit that i am very 'narrow minded"" when it comes to things like vacationing in Europe. It's just something that would never interest me....until I see your report! LOL  The pictures around the parents farm are amazing! Thanks for 'the eye opener""!  The majority of my travels have been in the US and there are some amazing sights there and here in other parts of Canada as well, but I am always glad to be back home again! I guess there really is no place like it!  I really enjoyed looking at your pictures and videos. Thanks"
500214,johnnyb,2010-08-31 15:36:00,3413,"For whatever reason, it doesn't matter what kind of report you post, pal....they are always a pleasure to read.  What a beautiful place your parents have...and the pics of Jack are great....I love his two-handed stance with the rod LOL    "
500222,fish-miester,2010-08-31 15:51:00,864,looks like a good time! (minus the car.. sorry to hear that)

500360,Bly,2010-08-31 23:59:00,1556,"Love all the pictures....Little Jack is growing up so fast! Looks like you all had a wonderful time, thanks for taking the time to share it with the rest of us."
500505,limeyangler,2010-09-01 13:55:00,5204," I think you are asking if i picked up any french words while away...lol...my French is more like Franglais...a bit of a hybrid language but i get by. I talk to all the fishermen along the banks of the river...seems like fishing is a universal language.    Thanks man, lol...in fact me and jack did lots of bonding while there, really pissed mum off as he always wanted dad.    hey Blair, thanks for the welcome back...OFC ROCKS!  Its terrible when the start exploring, Jack has had his fair share of bumps...never forget when he faceplanted the hard floor in Walmart...the bump was the size of a grapefruit...people looking at me like i was abusing the kid!    If you go...make sure you get to carcasonne, fantastic history (cathar's, holy grail stuff etc..) and amazing sceneryarchitecture and climate.    No worries Rattle, glad you enjoyed the pics...travelling the US is something i'd like to do more of too.    The fishimng pics are my favourite too JB. How's the new job goin?"
500561,johnnyb,2010-09-01 16:35:00,3413," Well it has its fair share of stress, but having the weekends off is AWESOME...every weekend is like a mini-vacation   Not that I am getting a TON of fishing with little miss baby-pants crawling around the place....but I'm not going insane either...so it's all good."
