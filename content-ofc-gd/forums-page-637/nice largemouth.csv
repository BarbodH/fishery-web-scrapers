500385,k-max,2010-09-01 01:19:00,20,"I was out fishing a small backwoods lake in hastings county on sunday, and this bass hit a spro topwater frog bait around 9AM.  Fish didnt fight as hard as some of the 3-4lbers ive pulled from this lake and looked old and tired.  Unfortunately I didn't have a scale handy and wanted to get it back in the water and swimming asap so I just marked my boat on its length, and later got it at just slightly over 21"".  Biggest fish I have weighed out of this lake I caught a couple years ago at 5lbs 4oz, and I'm sure this one was bigger, wish I knew though! As a frame of reference im over 6'3"".  Forgive the lousy Iphone pics!   "
500388,Musky or Specks,2010-09-01 01:23:00,2710,Its a very nice bass
500393,fishnsled,2010-09-01 01:40:00,3520,"Nice fish!  I'll say it's about 6 pounds give or take.  I caught this 21"" a couple of years ago and it was just shy of 6lbs.  "
500413,Cypher,2010-09-01 02:49:00,20,Nice Bucket. Keep up the great work.
500484,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-01 12:53:00,0,Regardless of the weight that is a nice bass! Thanks for sharing.
500492,MCTFisher9120,2010-09-01 13:19:00,3761,I would say a 5 or 5 1/2 lb bass. Most likely 5 1/2lbs  Great catch man
500514,fish-miester,2010-09-01 14:35:00,864,agreed with MTB my guess would be about 5.5 or 5.3/4 Heck of a fish tho!
500516,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-01 14:40:00,0,"Nice and juicy, good catch..........."
500529,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-01 15:25:00,932,Great Fish & good camera phone pictures!  I've stopped caring about bass weight and I go almost strictly by measurement at this point - it's an easier barometer and does less harm to the fish.  Ryan
500530,k-max,2010-09-01 15:26:00,20,"thanks for the comments guys!  not sure if the pics show it, but it was a very old and weathered looking fish, maybe 20 years old (if they get that old!)... probably one of the main breeders in the lake over the last few years (small lake)....anyhow im glad its still swimming and hopefully has another couple spawning seasons left in it!"
500555,johnnyb,2010-09-01 16:24:00,3413,Awesome fish -- good on you for releasing it!  Gotta be 5 and change....wow!
