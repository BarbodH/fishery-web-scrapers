499183,kickingfrog,2010-08-27 23:31:00,8333,Some people have no clue where most of the food we eat comes from.
499193,fishinguypat,2010-08-28 00:04:00,547,Let's take a walk over to the local hotdog factory shall we?
499194,spinnerdoc,2010-08-28 00:08:00,556,  i agree. you guys complain about bottom feeding and all but i bet a lot of you like chicken....like  me... but they do live their life in filthy conditions and eat their poo as well.  and about the lobster...they were once used as fertilizer...ground up and used as such.  catfish meat is mighty fine tasting and has a nice texture to it. just like what the other guys said it's when and where they are caught.
499201,bongo,2010-08-28 00:26:00,67,"Yes Catfish is a delicacy in Louisiana and Carp is a delicacy in Eastern Europe. However these fish are farmed, and are not the beasts that come out of the great lakes, like the 40lb carp and 30lb channel cats. The fish that these people eat are around the 6lb range, therefore much tastier and healthier"
499207,mercman,2010-08-28 00:43:00,7054,"  between fishing mixes and rod/reel combos, sounds to me like you work at CT or something. whats up with that anyway"
499230,Michael_Brown,2010-08-28 01:15:00,411,"I will take catfish, panfish, cold water suckers ahead of trout or walleye. Beside the fact that they are great eating fish, their populations are strong in most waterways. Catfish are easy to clean if you have the right stuff...pliers. My grandmother used to send us out to catch them everytime she came for a visit. A pair of pliers was all that was needed to skin them and then break off the head. Great fish to feed kids as well because they have strong bones. Cook them with the tail on, then grab the tail and the meat falls off bone free every time.  I have not tried carp yet but if I get a small one from a cold river, it's coming home.  I have seen what they call ""feed"" to cows, pigs and chicken and I agree with Roy garbage in garbage out. "
499233,kickingfrog,2010-08-28 01:25:00,8333,"I wouldn't eat a 40lb walleye... if they existed. I don't eat ""big"" walleye and it's not just because I feel it helps the fishery. Too much bio-magnification for me, thank you."
499241,Kinger,2010-08-28 01:46:00,351,"If you don't eat Ling/Burbot you are missing out.  Beautiful white, delicious meat. I also enjoy a few small spring pike (1-3 lbs range), if cleaned and cooked well it is absolutely delicious."
499242,Dozer,2010-08-28 01:47:00,896,"Mmmm, catfish..."
499245,Musky or Specks,2010-08-28 02:10:00,2710,The mud pout I eat are all about 8-10 inches when cleaned they leave a pc about the size of a chicken wing. Suck the meat off of each side after a quick fry. Its the only time I fill the white bucket.
499272,Stern Rules,2010-08-28 03:49:00,342,Oh that's funny.
499273,Stern Rules,2010-08-28 03:57:00,342,"I don't think the catfish I've tried ever tasted like eel. I would try suckers and carp if someone prepared it but I don't think I'd go out of my way to clean and eat 'em on my own unless they were really tasty. I tried the eel for the first time this year and they weren't bad. Still got some in the freezer that I caught in New Brunswick where they aren't endangered. Unless they are fairly big, they aren't worth the effort of cleaning."
499301,danbouck,2010-08-28 12:38:00,4380, 
499350,SudburyAngler,2010-08-28 16:53:00,154,I would have a hard time eating a garbage fish
499457,pikehunter,2010-08-29 09:51:00,1659,Ya but you can smoke anything it will taste better. Just wondering....which end does he light
499463,Rich,2010-08-29 11:00:00,3927,"Catfish is hard to beat, bullheads too. Carp is okay, a bugger to clean though. Sheephead I have yet to see done so it's edible. Suckers were really good, but way too boney for me to bother with again. If ya don't mind the extra work, you're very right.. most fish are tastey if prepared right.  And for anyone who assumes they are ""bottom feeders"" I guess you better stop eating perch, crappies, bluegills, bass, walleye and trout because 70% of their diets are off the bottom too!"
499861,mpt,2010-08-30 17:29:00,158,Sheephead or drum are greatr boiled in salt water and dipped in butter. Just keep the tenderloins on the top of the fish the rest is a waste of time to clean.
499872,sheyuid,2010-08-30 17:43:00,25,I don't think so.
499894,ketchenany,2010-08-30 19:25:00,3229," You are right Roy!  Just like the guy who walks into a restaurant and asks the waitress what was on special toay.  She replies it was oxe tongue sandwich to which he replies ""I don't eat anything that came out of an animal's mouth""  The waitress then asks ""what can I get you""  ""a fried egg sandwich"""
499900,kickingfrog,2010-08-30 19:36:00,8333,Mmmmm cloaca.
499993,fish_finder,2010-08-30 23:22:00,370,"I honestly think people would have no idea what they were eating if it was battered in crispy chronzey, fish crisp or a homemade batter.  How many of you folks who won't eat anything but 'game' fish have actually tried 'garbage' fish??  probably not many.  I'd take a nicely battered slice of carp over a steak from zehrs or sobeys or whatever anyday."
499995,buick14,2010-08-30 23:27:00,741,one time I caught an old tire from the humber..fried it up tastes just like chicken!
498972,shimano25,2010-08-27 05:52:00,31,"I know many pro anglers have this distate (no pun intended) for fish species like suckers, drums, bullheads, carp, etc. However, when I fry them up using those packaged seasoning powder you buy at Canadian Tire I think they taste great. I know that people will always rave about walleye, perch, crappie, etc., but I think those ""trash"" fish species also taste good when prepared right (and fried with the right seasoning). Anyone agree?"
498973,fishinguypat,2010-08-27 06:03:00,547,"Carp have many recipes that are great,suckers are ok.drums don't eat em. catfish apparently tastes like eel... i much prefer pike or walleye though"
498978,Roy,2010-08-27 08:47:00,13728,"Why does the phrase "" Garbage in, garbage out"" come to mind?"
498987,scugpg,2010-08-27 10:37:00,1373,"I enjoy the taste of mudcat/bullhead, but they need to be taken from clean water.  Never tried carp but I would just not around here!"
498988,Musky or Specks,2010-08-27 10:52:00,2710,Bullheads(or mud pout as we call em) are mighty tasty. Just a lot of cleaning involved.
498989,lew,2010-08-27 11:14:00,12766,"I'll have a pork chop  instead, thankya very much"
498990,CLofchik,2010-08-27 11:14:00,854,Spring suckers out of G'bay tribs taste just as good as the trout.  Where they are caught I think has more bearing than what species.  I'd eat a whistle trout out of Nipissing before I ate a salmon out of Lake O.
498993,scugpg,2010-08-27 11:20:00,1373," For sure. Some species inheritenly taste better than others, but water and diet has a big difference on age.  Even size, some fish could be much heavier than others of the same age depending what lake they are in and their diet."
499016,OhioFisherman,2010-08-27 12:44:00,6623,I agree completely! Eat more Carp and Sheep head! Sucker are good for bait.
499021,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-27 13:13:00,2582, I agree with that statement 100%
499022,Peps,2010-08-27 13:20:00,191,  Make that 2 please!!!
499023,uglyfish,2010-08-27 13:23:00,981,"Mudcats and catfish are one of my favorites.  As for the rest, not for me. I won't be eating them anytime soon.  I did have a buddy tell me he ate a sheepshead and said it just tasted like a bass."
499033,toca,2010-08-27 14:10:00,274,i will never eat bass or carp or anything from toronto rivers...
499035,John,2010-08-27 14:15:00,2956, I think he meant that it tasted like ass
499036,Headhunter,2010-08-27 14:24:00,5703,"Silver bass/white perch taste just like Tilapi... Lew, pass the pock chops, would yah! LOL HH"
499038,bassjnkie,2010-08-27 14:34:00,1101,I had fried carp in the past (made by a Hungarian friend) and I have to say it was pretty good.
499039,jimmer,2010-08-27 14:34:00,2730,"I have a buddy who smokes carp on ocassion and I would put them right up there with any other smoked fish.  He pulls it out on our ice fishing trip and it's gone in minutes. Catfish are okay out of cooler water, but I haven't tried sheephead or sucker yet."
499046,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-27 14:44:00,932,Carp is a delicacy in Europe.
499055,cwpowell,2010-08-27 15:12:00,265,"  Does he use a pipe, or roll it like a cigarette?"
499062,bdox,2010-08-27 16:15:00,329,I wish people would keep more carp. Whether they eat them or not I could care a less. Just get them out of my bass water!
499133,aplumma,2010-08-27 19:24:00,6896,Channel cats are the number one table fare here at the farm. The 3-5 lbers are sweet and clean with a good texture that few other fish can match.   Art
499134,Leecher,2010-08-27 19:24:00,7832, I totally agree (mud pout or French name Barbotte) real good eats!!!
499139,kickingfrog,2010-08-27 19:38:00,8333,"I've had bull heads and drum. They both taste great, and I mostly eat only walleye and perch. The smug superiority of some people is really quite amusing, but that may have been the original goal."
499154,adempsey,2010-08-27 20:37:00,1498,"At some point in the past lobster was considered ""peasant"" food too.  I think for me it's more about when and where you catch it, not what you catch.  I'll try almost anything once."
499172,2kj,2010-08-27 22:04:00,77,"Agreed!  You couldn't pay me to eat a carp!  The type of water and areas they come from and all that bottom feeding, not to mention the age of the fish, gross.  I could make skunk taste good if I rolled it fish fry and sunk it in pot of oil, doesn't make it good or good for you."
