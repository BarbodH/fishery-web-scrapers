500118,WeedLine,2010-08-31 02:57:00,322,"Hey guys/gals, I have a Garmin Oregon 200 and was wondering if the BlueChart Canada g2 chip is best for the unit. I can't get a straight answer from BPS or RadioWorld about this chip. Should I just buy the inland lakes and Great Lakes chips separately. I really need the inland lakes more than anything but could use the Great lakes chip as well. I heard that the BlueChart is mainly for the Great Lakes but am not sure. Does this make sense? Thanks for the help."
