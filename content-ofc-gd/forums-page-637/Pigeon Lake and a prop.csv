500258,hammer swinger,2010-08-31 17:51:00,7," Sure looks familiar, after they found it, they pbly set it on that rock for EHG to find"
500261,hammer swinger,2010-08-31 17:57:00,7," No damage to the hull/transom, it came off pretty clean, I coasted for about 100 ft -  I was doing about 30mph It was a terrible sound and feeling, since then I always keep my Position Error on my overlays"
500263,fishnsled,2010-08-31 18:03:00,3520,"Nice musky and it certainly is a small world.  I know the area and it certainly isn't one to mess with.  Unless someone is out fishing you then it's a great spot to kick them out of the boat, right Cliff??  "
494646,ehg,2010-08-15 16:21:00,2666,"Haven't really fished much this year for different reasons (mainly illness) so was glad to get out Saturday for a bit, only third day out since musky opened. Was worried about thunderstorms and the sun beating down on us but it was mainly cloudy with some sprinkles here and there Always figure to target muskies at Pigeon and started off trolling Jakes and Believers in open deeper waters, no fish were caught. So ended up throwing spinnerbaits and topwaters for bass mostly, as usual. Some decent bass are usually caught but yesterday was all small smallies and rock bass. Like fish shown here...   So we went down to south end of Big Island to a rocky spot that has a huge reef coming up to about 1 foot deep. Have always done well for smallmouth here but today just a bunch of 1 lbers and WGSF's. This shallow rocky reef covers about 400 square yards and is unmarked and submerged. Over past 20+ years i've seen no markers but yesterday i saw some bleach jugs marking reef. Dave spotted something odd on a shallow flat rock, so we looked and he pulled this out...  This part was completely sheared off. The depth would probably be about 2 ft. for at least 100 yards in any direction. This was a big boat, seems the outcome would have been nasty no matter what. Must be why someone finally decided to mark the reef.  Not far from here there are channel markers where musky folks trolled. I never fished there until earlier this year. Decided to troll a firetiger musky spinnerbait. Ended up catching this musky as we were going into shallower weedy water. Thought i caught a weedmass until felt strong headshakes.  Didn't measure fish but maybe it was 35 in. Had a great day outside and caught a musky. Gotta love going out fishing"
494649,Sinker,2010-08-15 16:40:00,8692,Atta boy Eric!! That area is worth spending sometime in!!  S.
494650,tdotfisherman,2010-08-15 16:48:00,317,"Great looking Musky Ehg, thanks for posting!"
494652,SudburyAngler,2010-08-15 16:53:00,154,nice musky
494688,ehg,2010-08-15 18:28:00,2666,"You know where i was at there Shayne. Will submit somethings before year end for tourney, still time"
494691,danbouck,2010-08-15 18:38:00,4380,Nice Job!  That looks like it would have been a nasty ride for whomever owned that prop.
494694,alexcba,2010-08-15 19:00:00,634,looks like someone had an expensive and hairy boat ride.
494732,fishdawg,2010-08-15 21:15:00,912,"wouldnt be suprised if there were a few more submerged lower units in that stretch... allways enjoy your reports Erik used to fish there a lot, have only been once in the last 2 yrs..."
494738,darsky,2010-08-15 22:07:00,586,hurricane point maybe
494746,thalweg,2010-08-15 22:51:00,112, Funny...I know the boat that prop belongs to.
494787,MJL,2010-08-16 01:15:00,2427,Beautiful 'ski Erik...Congrats and great report  I wonder what you'd get for the prop if you sold it on ebay? LOL
494794,ehg,2010-08-16 01:29:00,2666,Ya Hurricane Point has bad bits but that is at very north part of lake. This area is at very south part of Big Island maybe 3-4 miles south of Hurricane Point. We trolled Hurricane Point for 'skis but nada. It isn't called DSI either Thanks for replies.
494796,majorlifts,2010-08-16 01:37:00,171,"  I look at the pic of that prop and it still amazes me, I cant get over the thought of that thing being ripped off."
494799,highdrifter,2010-08-16 01:56:00,2534,Good for you Erik.  Was supposed to hit Buckhorn today but decided to err on the side of caution on account of the foul weather..  Nice fish bud!  HD
494859,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-16 11:33:00,0,Nice Musky!
499907,hammer swinger,2010-08-30 19:51:00,7,"I just had to share... (first time poster, long time lurker) 5 years ago I was musky fishing in November with a group of guys. This happened on the last day of our trip.  It was a terrible day of snow/rain/wind. I was tucked behind the windshield following my course on the GPS. I had been over that spot hundreds of times over the years and at least 15 during this trip. All I heard was bang and then the smell of lower unit lube. That was the day I learned (the hard way) about GPS position error. Then a few weeks ago, my buddy who was in the boat with me, sent this picture. They were on a sea-doo trip through the trent, and were laughing about the ""event"" and found the lower unit.   I am glad to hear it is marked now, it is a great spot surrounded by deep water, rock & weed (and boat parts)"
499985,Pigeontroller,2010-08-30 23:05:00,2793,"Thats funny, sort of..."
500075,ehg,2010-08-31 01:40:00,2666,That is the flat rocks your buddy is standing on with the prop. Thought surely must've been damage to the hull of boat as well with the shallowness and abundance of rocks. At least no one was hurt. Small world
500093,solopaddler,2010-08-31 02:05:00,8605,Small world indeed.  Nice to see you get out Eric.
500095,Leecher,2010-08-31 02:08:00,7832,Great report and pics Eric Glad you had the chance to get out and hook into this beauty Thanks for sharing Leechman
500105,Fisherpete,2010-08-31 02:25:00,1814,"Nice ski! And WOW, that prop pic is crazy... I have always wondered what would happen if somebody hit a rock or shoal with a big outboard... now I know! Was there any damage to the boat? Growing up on Rice Lake, I heard many stories of boats tearing their transoms off on the sunken railroad tracks... never saw any to confirm though."
500106,thalweg,2010-08-31 02:27:00,112, Hey Hammer swinger.  You figure thats the same prop as the first posters picture?
500138,lew,2010-08-31 11:04:00,12766, Haven't heard of DSI since Jamie left the board  Definetely some nasty spots around there if your not paying attention to where your going.
