499500,Spiel,2010-08-29 14:25:00,9065,"You have to be careful with those toothy buggers, I hear the slime off them will rust your pliers in mere seconds."

499572,Tom McCutcheon,2010-08-29 20:00:00,627,What did you use for that Matt?  Fish Crisp or Darryl Chronzy's batter....  Tom.
499591,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-29 21:22:00,2050,"Where's the picture of your musky? Haha just kidding dude. Ugly bugger for sure!  Cheers, Ryan"
499646,muskymatt,2010-08-29 23:33:00,2608,Since you asked!    Good fight casting the cowgirl on a weedbed at dusk
499666,Handlebarz,2010-08-29 23:55:00,3790,Yep that's a UGLY bugger for sure. I here some salt and pepper little oil and cast iron and you have a great snack there.  Nice Ski Matt
499668,Joey,2010-08-29 23:58:00,9122,"Nice Ski, and yep, nasty little buggers ain't they, yuck!  Joey"
499682,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-08-30 00:47:00,0,That's actually kind of neat.  I'm guessing that's a silver lamprey (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis) as opposed to the dreaded (and hated) sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).
500032,sheyuid,2010-08-31 00:15:00,25,what's it? looks so ugly!!!
