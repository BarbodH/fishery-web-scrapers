932699,AKRISONER,2015-09-04 18:08:00,5558,I know a few of you guys are bird watchers. A buddy of mine in Mississauga has had a group of about 10 of these strange looking birds hanging around his front lawn for a couple of days. I have tried everything to try identify them but am coming up empty.  Anyone else have any clue what the heck these are.  
932701,Brettiop,2015-09-04 18:12:00,279,"Those are Dodo birds!!!     Nah, i believe they are called Chukar, its a kind of partridge"
932707,BillM,2015-09-04 18:25:00,17367,Almost look like Quail.
932708,Beavertail,2015-09-04 18:26:00,331,"Yep, Chukar for sure. Introduced upland game bird, my guess is they escaped from a farm."
932709,Fang,2015-09-04 18:36:00,1330,used to know a couple farms that raised and sold them outside Caledon and Orangeville. one of them was pretty big operation with several hundred birds on site  they raised them for the game bird farms and private shooting clubs  you can still see ads for them on kijiji
932716,dave524,2015-09-04 18:56:00,4508,"Chukar...Saw my first one , picking gravel in the parking lot at work at least 10 years ago along the south service road in Stoney Creek. Seem to be locally common now, where there is pay to hunt game farms as previously mentioned. Haven't seen the similar Hungarian Partridge in many more years, was a few around Smithville when I was young."

932994,Headhunter,2015-09-07 15:10:00,5703,I spotted the same birds in my backyard this weekend. Scarborough/Pickering border. HH
933015,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-07 16:49:00,10439,Yep definitely chukkar. I used to see them at our place in Grand Valley. They would release them in the Luther Marsh and some would end up @ our place along with pheasants.
933154,AKRISONER,2015-09-08 14:31:00,5558,lol turns out frank lives very close to my friend. small world!
933180,jimmer,2015-09-08 18:27:00,2730,Funny that this is posted. I saw a ring neck pheasant this morning on the way to work. Haven't seen one in years. This was just east of Lindsay. Definitely a chucker in the picture.
933185,NAW,2015-09-08 19:04:00,4022,Those poor chukars take a beating during dog training practice!
