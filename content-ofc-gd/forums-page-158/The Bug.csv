932452,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-03 04:48:00,8243,Coke.....................It's the real thing. Appluma is bang on. The name comes directly from the word Cocaine.
932454,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 05:07:00,11391,"True.  But cocaine is not codeine, nor is it related.  Cocaine is a stimulant based of phenyethylamine.  Codeine is a weak opiate"
932456,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 05:10:00,11391,"In the earlt 1900s, cocaine and codeine were like tour modern acetaminophen(tylenol).  They were used to treat anything and everything.  Even given to infants and toddlers"
932457,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 05:12:00,11391,"Their was even a ""cough medicine"" that contained both, plus alcohol and cannabis oil.  Make nyquil look like juice lol"
932468,dave524,2015-09-03 10:56:00,4508,"  MB2 you are probably reefering to this stuff, remember sharing it on Facebook back in Feb."
932470,Beans,2015-09-03 11:39:00,3339,"Back before I had a back operation for a protruding disc, I was using percocets to relieve the pain...One night I had Maribeth take me to the hospital in Lindsay as I had terrible pain like a kidney stone...After looking at the x-rays the doc sez...""the good news is you don't have a kidney stone...The bad news is that you are full of crap...Constipation is no fun...!"
932482,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 12:46:00,11391," Frig imagine that st7ff being sold on the shelves?  Hahahah unreal  The cocaine version was probably the ""dayquil"" of its time lol"
932486,SirCranksalot,2015-09-03 14:04:00,3291,Leave it to a plumber to know that.  Brilliant!!
932559,aplumma,2015-09-03 20:35:00,6896,"You are correct codeine and cocaine are two different substances with different base ingredients both can lock you up some kind of fierce. lol . If you go into the hospital and they have to use some of the big gun pain relievers ( morphine, dilaudid, Codeine,  etc) they will not discharge you from the hospital till your butt is working correctly.

932924,Fisherman,2015-09-06 18:18:00,7201,"Ok, enough already. He,s old. Lives in Angus. Give the guy a break will ya. Ha, well beat the bug, got back to normal, then while fishing rough water in Owen Sound during the derby the old L3/L4 disc goes for a _____, they definitely weren't constipated.  Couple of percs and other funny meds and I'm humpin around like Quasimoto.  Getting old sucks.  I wish you could have all those ailments and grow out of them as you get older."
932928,misfish,2015-09-06 18:47:00,29133,Getting old does suck bud. Glad to hear your on the mend. We need to talk about this pickled fish recipe that doug gave me. Says your the owner of it.
932930,SirCranksalot,2015-09-06 19:11:00,3291,"Getting old does suck bud.  Yeah, but it's better than the alternative!!"
932932,kickingfrog,2015-09-06 19:24:00,8333,"I work with a gentleman, and he often tells me to ""Take your time getting old."""
932938,Fisherman,2015-09-06 19:52:00,7201,"Doug, his memory is too classified.  Pickled perch(pike or whatever you want)  Slightly different from raw pickling,  I fry my fish first, pat off all the oil or butter, sort of let them drip oil free.  Don't have to de-bone them.  Pickle juice, 2 cups vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar, bunch of chopped up onions dill and whatever other poison you want to add.  Give it a quick boil, let it cool.  Stand the fish up in jars pour the cool juice over them and put them into the fridge.  Wait a couple days for the juice to permeate the fish, then have at it.  Not everyone's taste, but hey, every tongues different.  Eat within a month."
932293,Fisherman,2015-09-02 00:13:00,7201,"Holy motherin what agony. Frozen this morning in that heat this morning, felt like Fido gettin rid of rusty razorblades."

932430,aplumma,2015-09-02 22:50:00,6896,"If it was not for the Chinese bringing opium to the West it would have not been settled. The water was often full of parasites and bacteria that gave true meaning of the phrase ""two step"", The snake oil industry had one base ingredient you guessed it opium which not only made you feel good but it got rid of the trots, This harmless drug even made it into a favorite snake oil called Coke a Cola which then became a drink that spread across the USA it was not till 1902 it was removed from the formula. This info has been brought to you by me having to do a  dissertation for my masters on water treatment and field sanitation.   Art"
932449,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 02:56:00,11391,"Codeine constipation takes a few days generally, its not immediate.  Anyhow"
