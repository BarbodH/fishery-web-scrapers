While driving down the TIP last weekend from Brockville to Rockport I noticed tons and tons of bays with great looking reeds (Butternut, Browns, etc).  The water looks really fishy.  Does anyone fish there regularly?  Any decent pike fishing?  How about largemouth?"
933556,OhioFisherman,2015-09-10 16:38:00,6623,"Mr. Simon, it's sort of interesting, I don't even see hardly any videos of pike fishing on the St. Lawrence on youtube.  http://www.letsgofishin.us/Pikeimages  This site has some pictures, but they seem to be based around Massena NY?  The first couple of days of the recent tournament there had 6+ pound largemouth as big bass, but they didn't say in what area they caught them. Some of those weedy bays have to hold some good largemouth?"
933674,mike rousseau,2015-09-11 04:58:00,4661,I'm further east and pike here are becoming very rare...  We think they lost too much spawning habitat now that all the tiled farm land has filled the creeks with mud... No more gravel beds...  There are still pike of course but after June they're a tough go
