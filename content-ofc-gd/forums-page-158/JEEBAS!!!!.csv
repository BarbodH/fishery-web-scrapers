933251,mr blizzard,2015-09-09 01:14:00,1589,Better call Maaco
933256,captpierre,2015-09-09 01:25:00,2521,150 mph in the fog. Better have radar. Or a brain.
933259,Fisherman,2015-09-09 01:48:00,7201,I'll take the brain over radar.
933268,manitoubass2,2015-09-09 02:30:00,11391,Wow for dumb
933271,John Bacon,2015-09-09 02:54:00,3277,"It looked green, so I guess it wasn't a speed limit marker."
933272,SirCranksalot,2015-09-09 03:01:00,3291,If the buoy had hit them in the head it would not have damaged anything!!
