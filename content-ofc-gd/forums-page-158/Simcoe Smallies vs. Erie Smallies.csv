Like Simcoe, these waters hold an abundance of big smallmouth bass.  I was out yesterday afternoon drifting over a large shoal about 4 kms off shore and picked up 3-4 fish with every drift.  I tried a Carolina rig (which boated me a 20lb catfish!) and a drop shot rig with a pumpkin sharp shooter by Yum.  The drift was about .7mph so I had to use 3/4 oz drop shot weight.  The biggest came from the deepest water     "

933062,Mister G,2015-09-07 20:41:00,1429,When it comes to pickerel and smallies there is NO PLACE better then ERIE.........or I have been there yet.
933076,misfish,2015-09-07 22:06:00,29133,"I just wish they were closer together. Erie has some great toads, Simcoe will produce soon enough some of the same, once the feed bag starts."
933118,huzzsaba,2015-09-08 02:40:00,884,Here is a lake ontario smallie caught off the pier at night.  looks very similar to yours. Same size and probably weight too.
