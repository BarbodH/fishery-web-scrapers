933563,NewHips,2015-09-10 17:10:00,111,"Mike, you have always been supportive in any and all questions thrown your way., Thank You for helping me on various occasions (marking maps...lures...etc.) Please keep up the fantastic trip reports, it's as close to actually being there. The best of luck with your new endeavor.........you will always have the respect and encouragement from the majority on this forum. You are highly regarded by me......keep up the good work."
933577,TJQ,2015-09-10 17:50:00,7806,"As long as you don't start telling me to use the Banjo Minnow, we're cool.  If ever we needed a LIKE button that was it... lol  But seriously Mike has helped me out with photos and much more over the years.  When ever I visit a clients resort I post here...  Mikes reports are wonderful.  Mike..  4 pages of ""keep it up"" speaks VOLUMES."
933409,Salmonidstalker,2015-09-09 21:19:00,265,What happened to guys not really caring what other guys think???  I enjoy your posts Mike. Keep them coming.
933413,aplumma,2015-09-09 21:28:00,6896,The truth of the matter is if OFC felt that someone is promoting there products and giving back nothing them we as the owners would PM or lock their account. In Mikes case if he wanted to advertise it would be most likely after a discussion between the owners be for free because of how much he puts into the board as well as the members he has helped over the ages. The revenue that we need to make updates and pay for the site usage actually comes from the 3 banners we have. People using adblocker or other programs cost us far more and in some cases we have had to put off updates till we could pay for them because of them.  The final thing is if you receive unwanted PM's you can find on the left sideof the PM near the top a button to block that person from sending you any more PM's. I also encourage people to send a PM to one of the owners/mods and we will be happy to put a stop to it on review.   art
933414,davey buoy,2015-09-09 21:41:00,5505,"Good stuff Mike as always,funny how this person has not stepped up to defend his/her self.Not surprising for sure.Love your reports as others.Keep them coming sir,always a welcome read with just a tad of dreaming !!!!!!!!!!!!"
933416,glenner,2015-09-09 21:46:00,56,"I am someone who has looked forward to reading your adventures every time I see you have posted another epic, in no small part because I dream that one day I can experience just one of these trips. Am I jealous? Sure. Am I resentful? Not one bit. It is obvious from the way you write, and the videos that show your unabashed joy with what you are doing, that you love to share your experiences with other anglers. Also I have seen many reports of fly-in trips by others on this board where they mention the advice and assistance you have offered (free of charge) so that they can have a great experience. Those are not the actions of someone whose aim is self-promotion. This board would not be as good as it is now without these wonderful reports of yours that offer many of us a glimpse into something we may never get to experience. Ignore those who, for whatever petty reasons, will try to bring out the negative, and keep regaling us with tales of your adventures."
933418,misfish,2015-09-09 21:59:00,29133,"Mike, a few years back I got a pm about how I post about the same thing (nothing like you, as your posts are about traveling fishing areas I wish I could only fish) The pm I got ,was about you and your laker reports and bass reports from the same lake. Always the same thing. I thought to myself, w t h. I fish, enjoy my day and report my day. I dont get it. It,s a fishing site. Ya I have been on the cooking thread more then fishing, but this site is open minded. Well that was til I seen this thread.  You have helpped me in many ways. My first float rod,pin reel and the how to. Also had a good time with your arival of Zoey. Met you for the first time buying my first custom rod made by a mutual friend. You gave some advise and let it be up to me to go with what I wanted. I was I must say, over whelmed with your knowledge and was like OK, DA, i,ll take this one.LOL  You have even offered up some river outtings which I  ( at my own fault ) could not commit to. Im still without a pass port. Thats what, 6 years now?    Lazy ass I am I know,  I enjoy your reports. Long read at times (just like Drews  ) but I do read them and enjoy.  One thing that really comes to me reading and watching the videos, is the time you share with your son. Some may think, ya he has the money and time to do that. To me it,s , wish I could of done that, but I did what I could and enjoyed what I did. They have the memories of our times, just like you and your boy will have.  I remember when you changed your name here from solopaddler to Mike Borger and you said things were in the works. I PM,ed you and said your on to big things. Turns out I was right . CONGRATS  I sit back and read your reports and say, theres a guy that did his time, and got what he deserved.  yA iM SURE THERE ARE SOME HERE IT PISSES OFF. TOO BAD.  Im rambling here, but one that has watched you do what this ole boy wish he had of done and so many others, I am here to say  JOB WELL DONE SIR.  Now, can you help me with my passport so I can atleast fish one day with you?  Let it be,let it be."
933420,Cast-Away,2015-09-09 22:09:00,790,"Mike, there have been plenty of jerks on this board over the years. The good ones stick around and the others move on to the next board to poke at people.  The internet can be a cowardly place.  I read all of your adventures and have for years. I don't like to say great story or great post unless I have more to say.  Keep it up, you have many fans!"
933422,Kerry,2015-09-09 22:14:00,383,"Hey Mike, As a long time member who reads much more than he writes I just want to say your posts are awesome. If the mods had a problem you would have known it long ago. I read through your Lk St Joseph report last night.I went to sleep thinking about big Pike and tons of eyes- well  while some of us can only dream about it SOME get to show us how it's done!! Kerry"

I like reading your posts and you have answered the questions I had about little missinabie. Actually u took time out of your day to talk to me on the phone during regular work hours. Keep the reports coming plz!

I had to respond to this. I don't need anyone to bite although your support is very much appreciated! I loved writing for OOD and in fact just before I stopped writing for them last spring I finally had a presence in the masthead of the magazine plus my own regular column. Do you know many people who would throw all of that away? Well I did, and one of the reasons (there was a few) was they were attempting to restrict what I was writing about on the internet (my online reports).  No one EVER makes a living writing for someone else whether Ontario Out Of Doors or anyone else and I dislike being dictated to - intensely.  So I had to consider, what's the next logical step in your evolution? I gave it a LOT of thought and I'm now preparing to publish my own magazine. I'm hoping (praying) that people will support me. But you know what? It's like I tell my kids, you will be successful in life if you're truly passionate about something and most importantly if you do it yourself. No one ever really achieves greatness riding anyone elses coattails.  This was probably not the place to make this announcement, but what the hell LOL!  At some point I'll make a more formal announcement.    NOW, can someone PLEASE reply to the St. Joe report that took me 62 hours to create and post? LOL!

933455,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-10 00:23:00,956,I was jealous when I read your post I admit.  Makes me want to do a trip like that one day.  One twenty pound pike after another.  So much action I would bring my ultra light ice fishing rod and see if I can land one of those.

I few years back he recommended a place near Nakina that was a great trip.  The way I see it, if the mods have no problem with his posts, why should I or anyone else? He provides great content to this site. Why would the mods/owners have a problem with that? Any 'trip write-ups I see in magaz such as Outdoor Can. or ONt Outdoors has some sort of 'plug' for the  lodge---many (most?) not written as well as Mike's. We pay for these type of magazs----all Mike's great stuff is free onhere!  Keep 'em coming!! Keep making me green with envy!!"
933482,Tim Mills,2015-09-10 02:40:00,476,Thanks for sharing your posts and your knowledge.  You are a class act and you add a lot of value and enjoyment to OFC .  The guy who PM d you is jealous.

933504,Roe Bag,2015-09-10 12:18:00,246,"Hey Mike guys like this aren't worth getting upset over. To some degree, jealousy is in us all. I'm jealous when I see the places you've been. The fishing you're able to enjoy. Your ability to put fish on the bank or in a boat. The way you can put pen to paper. Most here have nothing but respect and admiration for your abilities. Almost everyone here would love to be in your boots.There's nothing like a narcsisist that thinks he's better than everyone else. Guys that can't stand it when someone else is getting the attention.Keep it coming. Always a treat to ride along when you share your adventures.​"
933507,Headhunter,2015-09-10 12:52:00,5703,I think the whole thing became spam once it hit page three! LMAO HH
933522,MrSimon,2015-09-10 14:29:00,217,"I'm one of the many who has benefited from Mike's helpful suggestions .... we had the best trip ever based on his recommendation.  We all know he is working really hard to make his passion his career ..... and personally I think posting incredibly helpful and entertaining posts/reports is a great idea.  It puts fun content out there for the public to enjoy while simultaneously bringing attention to him as an angler/guide/coordinator.  Sure seems like a win win situation to me.  And let's face it ... there are a handful of guys on here who regularly post YouTube videos that are monitized (myself included) .... again, that's also a win/win.  Folks get excellent fishing content to watch/read and the owner gets a buck or two in return.  I think it's great.  And all of this generates traffic for the forum, which I assume is a good thing.  I just don't see why anyone would complain about any of this.  If content on the forum is designed to benefit or entertain the users, then who cares if the poster gets something in return."
933529,GRINGO LOCO,2015-09-10 15:15:00,20,Mike:  Speaking for myself your reports are the primary reason I check this website almost daily. Your reports allow me to evaluate different outfitters from a source that has fished numerous locations. Not there are not other reports I enjoy here as Moosebunk really has a flair for writing. My guess is the negative feedback you received may be from a competitive outfitter not liking one of your more favorable reports on their competition. Keep writing!
933533,ehg,2015-09-10 15:35:00,2666,"Back 30 yrs. ago as a kid i liked getting fishing mags (pre-internet). Ontario Fisherman, Ontario Out of Doors, etc....i found your posts provided the same if not better photos and info, From Lake O. trib steelheading back in the day to your Sutton R. brookie trips, being stalked by a wolf around eastern Lake Superior, central Quebec picking blueberries with your whole family,etc... all were good and without intention of self promotion. Nice work and thanks."
933562,FLEX ROD,2015-09-10 17:08:00,394,"Oh good, no actually thank God I am able to reply prior to this post being locked!!!!!  Mike I have have had the pleasure and privelage to know you now for 6 years for sure possibly 7, your Solopaddler days was what got me hooked on the site and I have not left since.  I had the pleasure to meet you the first time when I bought a reel from you, and that was the day that I can say with a hug smile on my face that was the moment we clicked and became friends.  In life, one, even with lousy luck usually get lucky and that was one of those rare moments for me, since then I have really been lucky and not only have your suggestions been great, yes I am one of those lucky 89, but I have also had the pleasure of joining you on some - TOO FEW - outings.  But Mike, you did one thing that really stands out in my memory, and that was one time when we were back from a day trip and speaking about our sons I mentioned just in passing if you knew where to get a pair of waders for my son, you asked me a few questions and said hang on and in couple of minutes you came walking out with a pair of Neoprene Cabela's waders and just handed them to me.  That sir is what I call being a true gentleman and really a true friend.  The day that you stop posting on here will be a very sad day for this SITE, as I for one will not be back as I will have nothing to look forward to and I will be following you via whatever venue you chose to be on free or pay does not matter  and as I told you already just let me know how and when to get on your subscription list for that new magazine.  FLEX - John"

933341,sauce,2015-09-09 16:22:00,219,"I love fishing. I love seeing pictures of big fish. I'd much rather be out there fishing than browsing the Internet drooling over someone else's pictures. Your reports / reviews are always loaded with good information and of course lots of pictures. Thank you for taking the time.  If I had just purchased a lodge or fishing resort, I would want to have someone like you come for a week and review my operation.  I somehow doubt you are being paid to visit these outposts. I hope you get a discount. I can't imagine funding your adventures. Whatever the case, you have put in your time and it's obvious that you are well respected in the greater fishing community. Keep up the good work."

I enjoy your posts and can get more lasting information from them than any half hour fishing show.  Yes, your posts may be a little commercial at the end, but I value the honesty that you present in your review rather than cutting it short and not commenting on the boats, the accommodations and the operator/owner.  Good job.  Keep you head up and keep 'um coming.  Mike G."

933299,solopaddler,2015-09-09 14:10:00,8605,"I received a pm last night from someone on the board who will go unnamed that's been bugging me. I didn't respond to him, but I feel the need to say something here. I might regret this, but I'm in a mood this morning.  The gist of the pm was ""thanks for clogging up the board with another huge advertisment"" then I was asked if I was paying for advertising. More was said, all of it in a nasty tone.  I'd like to respond to this publicly by clarifying a few points, just in case there's others that feel the same way.  I've been a member of this board for a pretty long time and I feel like I'm a part of it. I've made a good number of friends through this board and I've enjoyed following other members exploits online.  What I'm doing now travelling to all of the various camps and writing about them has been a natural progression for me and a true passion. Everyone controls their own fate and through a HUGE amount of hard work I'm now VERY close to being able to do what I love for a living. There's a lot more currently going on behind the scenes right now, and when the time is right I'll be making an announcement. It would be nice if people were happy for you and not seemingly petty and jealous, but sadly that's not case with certain small minded people.  My posts on this board are done for ONE reason only: to share the experience with everyone here. When I first launched my own website I initially thought I'd simply post a link back to my own site for my reports, but then thought better of it.  Let me throw some numbers at you. When I post something here it might get anywhere from 25-40 replies and 400-700 views. When I publish the same story on my own website on average I get anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 unique views. The Kazan River write up in June received over 70,000. I don't NEED to post my stuff here at all.  I post here solely because I want to share my experiences with people who for the most part I've grown to like over the years. Fact is in order for me to post my reports here there's a LOT of extra work involved because the photo and video embed codes required are different from my own website, yet I still take the time.  The lack of responses to something you've poured your heart and soul into creating has never bothered me, that's the nature of the internet. But then I get a message like I did yesterday and I felt like I'd been gut shot.  For what it's worth I'll continue to post here for all of the reasons I've mentioned. If anyone thinks negatively about what I'm doing, that I'm too ""commercial"" think again.  Anyhow that's it, end of rant.  Carry on.   "

933306,wkrp,2015-09-09 14:27:00,656,I always enjoyed your reports and look forward to more. Please keep them coming
933307,Ontariowine,2015-09-09 14:28:00,1,"Hey Mike;  For what little it's worth, your contributions of amazing posts are a Primary"" reason why myself and a group of good friends have been opened up to many excellent fishing adventures.  I feel like I have been living parts of your life on a 2 years lag time.  Having flown into Anjigaming (3 times) and Keezhik last year, your FREE advice, FREE tips and FREE sharing of hot spots, both by PM and on this board have contributed significantly to our success and enjoyment. Last year I replicated your fall trip to Lower Twin Lakes and yes, the grouse hunting was fantastic.  I, for one, search for and consistantly re-read, your posts and appreciate the work put into them.  I will not be alone in continuing to enjoy your adventure reports  Paul H  Ontariowine"

I like seeing people improve in life and doing what they love. Gives me inspiration actually. I'll give props to anyone who does well at something when they are above-board and fair and nice. You seem to be doing exactly that... plus you've helped out countless people here, so that alone makes you a welcome presence.  Keep up the great work mon-frère! Please start posting epic perch or bullhead reports though..."
933310,BassMan11,2015-09-09 14:30:00,583,"Mike,  Don't let one idiot bother you. Your reports an write ups were one of the main reasons I joined to community back in 2008."
933311,T-Bone,2015-09-09 14:34:00,160,"Love the reports and the insights I gain from them; and moreover, I love the entertainment value of reading them and living vicariously through your experiences. Don't let jealousy rain on your hard work and passion. You've always been helpful to me and very gracious...too bad that isn't always what you get in return from some.  Keep 'em coming..."
933312,ccmtcanada,2015-09-09 14:37:00,7971,"Mike.  Ignore them.  I've learned so much from you over the years and your posts are not huge advertisements.   Ever since your ""solopaddler"" days here I've always read your posts with envy!  Meeting you and fishing some rivers and our trip up north have been highlights of my fishing trips!!   Keep on posting!!"
933313,Dozer,2015-09-09 14:38:00,896,"I always enjoy your posts - but I do have to say there is a grain a truth to it.  I tell it how I see it and please don't take it the wrong way.  Every lodge is AMAZING with its name splattered all over the post and HUGE FISH.  While that may be the case your trip reports have become more of an advertisement - nothing wrong with it as that is your line of work so don't let peoples opinions get to you.  Am I allowed to post my opinion on here?  PM-ing you asking if you pay for advertising is rude, some jealousy involved mixed with someone having a crappy day?  Carry on with the posts, I love fish porn."
933314,blaque,2015-09-09 14:38:00,2419,"Ya know its funny...........because ive never ever thought about your posts as anything other than recreational. AT ALL. Never even crossed my mind to wonder if they were put up for any type of personal gain.  Theyve always come across as though youve just had the trip of your life, and you JUST HAD to share it with the guys, and  It shines thru every time that you post. Keep on truckin"
933315,AKRISONER,2015-09-09 14:41:00,5558,"I think this is a time where we can all sit back and take time to remember that there are always going to be that 1 idiot that ruins it for everyone. I think the sentiment on this board 99.9% of the time is that your posts are appreciated and a joy to read. Dont let some idiot bring you down, the clown doesnt know what he is talking about anyways.  Ill also mention that I have never felt like your posts are an ad, and if they were they would be pretty crappy ads that point out the fact that fishing may not have been the best at times, or that you struggled on another day etc.  Most ""ads"" dont point out any negativity."
933316,big guy,2015-09-09 14:42:00,414,"Mike, I love your posts, the longer the better and find your information invaluable. If it wasn't for them, I would not have known about you and been able to ask you the many questions I had when planning our first fly-in with White River Air, 51 weeks to go, can't wait. Keep up the good work and next time, please make your post a 3 part one"
933317,DanD,2015-09-09 14:42:00,2223,X2 to all of the above!!!!!!!!!!!!! If it wasn't for your report on the Attawapiskat and Eddie's camp; my brother and I would still only be dreaming of a fly-in. Your help with PM's and phone calls made our trip the best of our lives.  Thank You Mike!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Dan.
933321,solopaddler,2015-09-09 14:59:00,8605,"Thanks fellas! The irony is I'll bet this post gets more views and replies than the recent report that took 62 hours to create LOL!    I always enjoy your posts - but I do have to say there is a grain a truth to it.  I tell it how I see it and please don't take it the wrong way.  Every lodge is AMAZING with its name splattered all over the post and HUGE FISH.  While that may be the case your trip reports have become more of an advertisement - nothing wrong with it as that is your line of work so don't let peoples opinions get to you.  Am I allowed to post my opinion on here?  PM-ing you asking if you pay for advertising is rude, some jealousy involved mixed with someone having a crappy day?  Carry on with the posts, I love fish porn.  Of course there's a grain of truth to it. The last couple of years promoting camps has become a big part of what I do for a living! As far as everything always being amazing, there's no embelleshment - it's truth. I choose my destinations wisely and 60-80 photographs and 12-15 video clips don't lie. Plus, I work damned hard to succeed on all of these trips - I make it happen. If there ever was any negative aspects, trust me they'd be talked about.  Also, it's not like I simply post a pile of photos and say "" hey check out this great camp, it was awesome!"" I'd like to think that the writing and story itself offers some value and entertainment. Regardless of what you think my motives are there's a gross amount of work putting one of these things together often with a ridiculous deadline. The St. Joe write up took 62 hours to do in just a little over one weeks time. That's in addition to my regular 40 hour a week job.  Again, my stories are posted here because I want to share the experience with a large number of people whom I consider friends - no other reason."
933322,porkpie,2015-09-09 15:04:00,2521,"While I think someone sending you private messages to complain about your posts is a loser move, I agree with the poster above that said most of your posts have a pretty strong commercial element.  I don't begrudge you your success, but I have been against private web forums being used in any way to promote commercial gain without due consideration to the forum owners, and members being told by way of a site sponsor logo or the like,  that the entity is commercial.  Take channel 6-8 for example.  You can clearly see who is paying to play.   There are a lot of posts that I will either pass on, or have a cursory glance at here because I know they are basically an advert.  Nonetheless, the site owners here seem happy with the arrangement, so it's none of my business, and generally I'd say nothing, but seeing as how you brought it up in a public forum, I'll give you another perspective.  Best of luck with your ventures!"

Best of luck with your ventures!  You're right, I brought it up - you can say/think whatever you want.  So you don't begrudge my success and you're against private forums being used for promotion or gain.  I'll say it again, there is zero tangible benefit that I gain by posting here. None. It's possible that the outfitter in question might gain a booking or two, but myself I get nothing.  Here's some more numbers for you. I keep track of all of my correspondence with OFC members. Since January 1  89 different people have reached out to me for help. The vast majority of these guys I've spent a large amount of time with, either through emails or phone calls and most often both. In a great many cases there's a lot more involved. I do this because I enjoy helping people - no other reason.  Now I'm going to say something publicly about my business which I might regret...but then again, maybe not. One of the things I do (there are several) is act as a trip planning consultant and booking agent. Currently I work directly with over 100 lodges/outfitters across the country. NONE - let me repeat that - NONE of the camps I write about online garners me a single dime of income. That's the deal I have in place for anyone who hosts me.  The irony (not surprisingly) is most of the people who contact me want to ask about trip X which I've just written about. They don't want to hear about some unknown outfitter. Because of that the outfitters I write about probably DO get bookings, but I don't know for sure since I have zero stake in anything.  When people call for advice it would be in my best interests to suggest any number of outfitters, anyone besides the ones I've written about (I might actually make a tiny bit of money!). In a huge number of cases I'm happy to direct people to an outfitter I've helped promote if that's what they want or if I think it's the right fit. Trust me that happens a lot.  I'll bet I've dedicated easily over 80 hours of my time helping those 89 people since January 1 and have not made a cent.  What it has done is foster a whole lot of good will and that's something I'm big on.  In any case nothing is ever as it seems on the surface. I really can't stand it when people make assumptions that are patently wrong."
933330,fish_fishburn,2015-09-09 15:52:00,1311,"Keep up the good work Mike. I enjoy your posts very much. The complainer must be a Conservative, there not in a very good mood lately.lol"
933332,netminder,2015-09-09 15:59:00,514,"I'll be honest - I'm totally jealous. You are totally living the dream. Personally, if these are ""ads"" I see them as more promotion for the camps and not your service. Anyone could just contact the lodge instead of you. And besides, if there truly was an issue with trying to promote or advertise, the staff would put an end to it quickly.  I remember this spring asking you for some advice on fishing trip locations and you were nothing but accommodating, even if the donkeys I was going with weren't reciprocating to me and we ended up going to the same place we were at last year. I'll definitely be contacting you in the near future to book next spring's trip.  Keep the fish porn coming even if I never have time to read the entire post. I know a lot of effort goes into it and I'm pretty sure everyone here appreciates it."
