Caught six fish including my brothers 31 inch pike right off the bat.  I managed to land a couple of 18 inch largies, but the highlight was this bass that my nephew landed.  It was his PB of 16 inches.  Jumped twice to add a little excitement.  He set the hook, fought it, and released it all by himself.  Not bad for a 10 year old. "
