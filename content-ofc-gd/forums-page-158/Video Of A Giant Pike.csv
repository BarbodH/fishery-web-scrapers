932459,solopaddler,2015-09-03 06:33:00,8605,"I fished Lake St Joseph last week with Aaron Shirley and beyond some really tough weather it was a pretty killer trip! The full report should be done in a few days, but until then here's a little teaser....."
932460,Roy,2015-09-03 07:13:00,13728,Thunderstruck here Mike. Apex predator indeed.
932466,Gallie,2015-09-03 10:32:00,1215,Nice gator mike!
932474,TennesseeGuy,2015-09-03 11:57:00,957,Nice!  Big pike like eating JSM.

932477,BillM,2015-09-03 12:06:00,17367,"Mike doesn't need sleep, just coffee  :)   Can't wait for the report bud!"
932480,FLEX ROD,2015-09-03 12:24:00,394,"Once again Bill you are correct, but does it not have to be with the Baileys coffee mate?"
932485,solopaddler,2015-09-03 14:02:00,8605,"Thanks fellas!       Mike doesn't need sleep, just coffee  :) You know me well.  Once again Bill you are correct, but does it not have to be with the Baileys coffee mate? YECH! Absolutely not! LOL!"
932487,chris.brock,2015-09-03 14:19:00,4053,"Awesome for you guys to get video of the whole deal, from the hook set, to the release of that giant.  Did Aaron fly in that big muskie landing net? It looks better than a cradle."
932495,AKRISONER,2015-09-03 14:36:00,5558,I love seeing that a guy as spoiled   as you  :tease:is still able to get fired up about catching big fish.
932496,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 14:37:00,11391,"Awesome!  Great fish and great vid!  Mike, its ok to get a lil excited bud???"
932499,solopaddler,2015-09-03 14:52:00,8605,"Awesome for you guys to get video of the whole deal, from the hook set, to the release of that giant.  Did Aaron fly in that big muskie landing net? It looks better than a cradle. Slate Falls provided the nets. They also had brand new cradles for each boat which I normally use but the sides of those Alumarine boats were so high it made using the cradles difficult.  I love seeing that a guy as spoiled   as you  :tease:is still able to get fired up about catching big fish.  HAHA!! I'll tell you what, when I first watched that video I thought I was barely excited at all, almost comatose. You should see me when I'm really excited LOL!  Mike, its ok to get a lil excited bud Thanks, the fire still burns hot in my belly and always will."
932505,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 15:49:00,11391,"Ok mike.  Do me a favour. On your next trip, i wanna see a fish landed where you act like mike ianconelli.  Pretty please?  ???"
932508,solopaddler,2015-09-03 16:02:00,8605,"Ok mike.  Do me a favour. On your next trip, i wanna see a fish landed where you act like mike ianconelli.  Pretty please?    I usually edit the idiot stuff out but just for you, okay.  Am headed north Armstrong next week with Chris and a couple others, I'll see what I can do."
932509,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 16:55:00,11391,"Hahaha your awesome mike!  This will be epic!  The vid was great btw, and the graphic.

932537,msp,2015-09-03 19:30:00,1336,Nice !
932538,Pickeral eater,2015-09-03 19:31:00,155,That's awesome mike!!   Love the video man!

932714,solopaddler,2015-09-04 18:47:00,8605,"OMG !!  That thing looks like it could eat people.  Yeah, the fish is pretty big too."
932727,misfish,2015-09-04 20:07:00,29133,Thats a real nice gator Mike.  I notice you use the spinning reel alot in your videos. Are you not a fan of the bait casters?

I'm 50/50 spinning/baitcaster when fishing for pike. The spinning equipment I use offers some pretty serious advantages over a baitcaster depending on the baits I'm throwing. My current favourite is a 71/2' St. Croix Avid med/hvy saltwater rod paired with a 4000 series Shimano CI4 reel. It's a pure joy to fish with, rock solid and butter smooth."
