Anyways being in Brighton, I live fairly close to the Trenton Armed Forces base... And see all sorts of planes and jets etc on a fairly regular basis flying at low altitude. Today was different though....  Saw this chopper circle several times we assumed just another training flight... It was a lot more then just that when they dropped in on us.  SARTECS doing their thing, training for emergencies to help keep people safe. They drop them at one marker/bouy and pick them up at another....  Here's some video of it..... Less then 100' away. Should of casted into the rotor wash for musky!     G"

932949,glen,2015-09-07 00:15:00,2641,The only way that would be better is if they pulled a fish out instead of a person.
