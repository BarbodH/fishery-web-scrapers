Sooooooooooo, are there any charters that you would recommend, specifically to go out and target bass...? Or does anyone out there need someone to split gas money with? I'd love to fish a tournament for fun!  A little back story: both my wife and I play wheelchair basketball for the Canadian Paralympic team. We completed in the Parapan Am Games this past August and with all the training leading up to that, the most fishing we managed was getting up to Burd's twice. We both enjoy fishing but I'm the truly afflicted one. I really NEED to fish. We start back to training in a couple of weeks and would really like to get out on the water, by hook or by crook. If you have any suggestions, feel free to either respond here or send me a PM.  Thanks in advance! Adam and Jamey"
932639,Joeytier,2015-09-04 07:01:00,3990,Erik Luzak is a well known guide in the Kawarthas that will definitely put you onto fish.  I think a couple members here even went out with him on the water and put tons of fish in the boat!
932642,Meegs,2015-09-04 09:03:00,249,Happy go fishing charters... Calum Johnston.. he's on Lake simcoe and does bass trout and perch
932646,misfish,2015-09-04 10:49:00,29133,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^And his boat is real slick looking. he does well out there.   Also try Greg Klatt on the board here.
932652,Lape0019,2015-09-04 12:37:00,647,"I know it won't help you this year but there are quite a few Bassmasters clubs within the Toronto area that pair boaters with non boaters for tournaments. I joined the Ottawa Valley South Bassmasters in the off season and will be fishing my 4th tournament on Saturday with them. Because our club was low on boaters, I have been a boater for 2 of the 3 events I have participated it. Our club is run really well and I have learned from my boater and non boaters alike. Everyone has something to learn from someone else and I find clubs like these are very good for learning and getting out on the water.  I know not all clubs are run the same so check out the ones in your area and maybe attend a meeting. I do not know how they vote people in up there but our club makes you attend at least one meeting and on the second one you attend, you can be voted in.  Check out Ontariobass.com and click on ""about"" to see the ""find a club"" list.  The other positive is I have found many people who have offered to take me out in their boat from this club as well as found a slew of people I would have in my boat any time. Its a good way to meet people with the same love as fishing that you have."

932658,mark demmery,2015-09-04 13:02:00,68,"I've gone out with Taro Murata for Musky/Walleye 3-4 times now...according to his twitter account, he is still crushing bass.  Might be worth a call? Very knowledgeable, entertaining guy....  http://fishcity.tv/"

932828,FrankTheRabbit,2015-09-05 17:04:00,479,I've been on with Taro as well. He's super enthusiastic and does his utmost best to get you onto fish. He even finds fish where other people just boat by and don't even think of fishing those spots.  Super knowledgeable and a very people person.  Couldn't recommend him enough.
932943,landry,2015-09-06 21:03:00,1005,Go with Frank or Paul castellano on Erie. They will get u on bass till u get bored of it. Don't know Frank but Paul is a great guy.
932947,Toronto_Angler,2015-09-06 23:25:00,698,Can't go wrong with Taro. You'll catch fish and gave a great time he's an awesome guy! Come to think of it you can't go wrong with any of the choices above and I'm sure any of the guides would be thrilled to have a gold medalist paraolympian out with them!
933468,adam lancia,2015-09-10 01:39:00,234,"Ok guys, rather than book a guide, how about renting a boat for a day...? Looking for bass lakes within about a 2 hour drive of Scarborough that also have marinas on them which rent boats. A 9.9 tinny isn't what I'm looking for though, something with decent seats (pontoon or a bass/fishing boat) is a must. A trolling motor would be a huge bonus and a fish finder would have me that much extra excited, though neither of those things are necessities. Fire your suggestions my way, thanks!!!"
933539,Acountdeleted,2015-09-10 15:42:00,2562,"Rosedale marina out of Rosedale on highway 35 is top notch. For $150 I got a 16 foot primo boat with all the fixins and full tank of gas (lasted the entire day. We ran out right at the dock). Balsam lake to the west, Cameron lake to the east for a $16 lock lift fee. Even if you don't catch anything (you will catch something) the area is so beautiful you will have an amazing day."
933641,adam lancia,2015-09-11 01:00:00,234,"That's the only place on the lake that rents boats now, and the 16 footer with a depth finder is what we're renting. I'm looking forward to finally getting on the water!"
933683,Acountdeleted,2015-09-11 11:44:00,2562,Have fun. Post pics of your day.
