927632,hutch4113,2015-08-04 14:08:00,374,"Out on Balsam yesterday (notice there is no fishing report to go along with it   ).   Using the trolling motor - going into the wind, so the speed was set to 8 I think - when all of sudden the motor died.  It still turns left/right with no issue.  Noticed a distinct electrical smell, but the plug itself was not hot.  When I hit the ""test"" button nothing shows up on the battery gauge - but I had a full charge/batteries are brand new.  I am guessing something on the Motor burnt out - any thoughts?"
927636,OhioFisherman,2015-08-04 15:01:00,6623,"I don't know what the connections look like in the newer models. Years ago I was using a Minnkota electric on a weedy and windy lake and it stopped working, it was just a simple pedal cable control. One of the spade connectors overheated and burnt thru and broke off. I replaced it and all was fine, yes there was a burnt electrical smell."
927722,davey buoy,2015-08-04 19:58:00,5505,"I have a V2 as well,maybe a silly question,but did you notice if the motor shaft was turning?Haven't had my blade off,maybe the prop insides are toast?That electrical smell worries me ."

By shaft turning - do you mean left/right?  If so, yes it would turn left or right when I hit the pedal.  But no thrust/prop turn - either with the pedal or with the thrust set to on."
927843,glen,2015-08-05 11:42:00,2641,Prop shaft turning.  Blades on prop not turning?
928190,Sinker,2015-08-06 23:21:00,8692,Try another foot pedal.  S.
928357,BillM,2015-08-08 01:04:00,17367,Try another foot pedal.  S.  Shane is most likely right.  V2 foot pedals tend to crap out...  (Actually they all do)
928370,ecmilley,2015-08-08 01:59:00,2163,"foot pedals are common for going,another item is the armature goes, the commutater walks down the shaft and causes the brush plate to overheat"
928393,hutch4113,2015-08-08 13:40:00,374,"I was thinking the foot pad.  However - when I plug the trolling motor itself into power, the Test Guage on the motor does not light up when pressed.  I am wondering than if it is the motor itself."
928420,ecmilley,2015-08-08 21:55:00,2163,"take the prop off, remove the screwa that hold the bullet together and pull end plate check brushes, plate, aarmature or if you wanna make a drive to dunsford bring it here should have an answer for you quickly"
929174,hutch4113,2015-08-12 15:36:00,374,"Thanks to everyone for the replies - but it just donned on me.  I have a Fuse on my trolling motor batteries - which I never checked (it is on the negative lead).  I will start with the simple and go from there, but that would explain why my battery gauge/test shows no power on the Motor.  That was the part that bugged me, and I have been letting it peculate in the back of my mind.  I could not figure out why a non-functional pedal and/or motor itself, would impact on the test meter.  Guessing i will look and notice that the fuse is blown - which sort of makes sense.  I was at full power when it went, fighting the wind."
929202,wallyboss,2015-08-12 17:38:00,1095,If it was the fuse then it wouldn't turn left or right. Don't think that it's a fuse issue.
929204,Sinker,2015-08-12 17:41:00,8692,"Also, your fuse should be on the positive cable.  S."
929215,hutch4113,2015-08-12 18:30:00,374,If it was the fuse then it wouldn't turn left or right. Don't think that it's a fuse issue. Darn..that is right.  Sigh
929230,bigbuck,2015-08-12 20:26:00,2449,Fuse should definitely be on the positive cable. Not the negative. Could be either the motor itself or the pedal.that it turns and the prop does not spin makes me suspect that the motor itself is suspect. I would take Ernie up on his offer.....
929334,hutch4113,2015-08-13 14:05:00,374,"Sorry - it is on the Positive.  I had red on the brain - but said negative by mistake - must have been my mood.  Will take a look based on what Ernie posted, and PM.  I have been sick for the past week and  1/2 so boat has been last thing on my mind."
932371,springbok,2015-09-02 15:34:00,3,"Any update? Did you fix the problem. I have the same issue with mine. Turns left right, but no prop."
932378,hutch4113,2015-09-02 17:01:00,374,"Any update? Did you fix the problem. I have the same issue with mine. Turns left right, but no prop.  So went up to see Ernie.  He plugs it into his boat - motor works fine.  Test Gauge also lights up showing remaining battery power, etc.  From what I understand the motor only needs 12 volts to turn, but 24 to run the prop.  Ernie suspects the plug on my boat may need to be replaced - possible metal fatigue.  I am also going to look at my batteries - they are brand new, but will check them as well - maybe I lost one?  Plug should be easy to verify too."
932391,springbok,2015-09-02 18:48:00,3,"Mine worked fine when I got home. Was also told that it uses less battery to turn, so it may be my battery. I'm going out tomorrow with my battery on full charge, and I borrowed a pedal and second battery from a friend. Lets see what happens."
932611,springbok,2015-09-03 23:53:00,3,"went out today, it was the battery"
932882,Mister G,2015-09-06 12:24:00,1429,Tough time to buy a new battery. Season is ending and old stock on shelves. Maybe wait until next spring if you can.
932894,Rob,2015-09-06 14:44:00,467,"Well I have a brand new Kirkland deep cycle battery that I bought because I thought my battery was on the fritz. Turned out to be sulfated and gave it a super charge and now it is fine. So if you need one I have one for sale, let me know cause I was planning on returning it to Costco for a refund.  Rob C"
