933411,iFish4real,2015-09-09 21:24:00,386,"Hello everybody, I have checked and re-checked all the regulations and I believe I have my answer but, as we all know, they can be hazy and interpretable so, I'd like to know what other hunters think on the matter.  This is the scenario: I go moose hunting up north, bow season, I have a bull tag, I am on my ATV with my crossbow ready to hunt. Am I, at this point, allowed to have my rifle on my ATV also, in the case and trigger locked since I have a bear license too? My guess is that I would be only transporting the rifle at that point but if, let's say, in the afternoon I'm away from the camp and I decide to stop hunting moose and start hunting bear I can do that.  Oppinions please  Thanks!"
933415,chris.brock,2015-09-09 21:43:00,4053,"I think if there's open seasons and you have the tags, no problem.  I don't even think you need the trigger lock, just in the case and not loaded.  Same as having a doe tag, a small game tag and 2 guns. You can't shoot the deer with the 22, but the grouse you can."

With an archery moose tag, and a rifle bear tag, you can decide which one you want to have loaded, but only one or the other......and only once your off the atv.  S."

933567,Sinker,2015-09-10 17:26:00,8692,"No, it does not, as long as it is within legal hunting hours. 30 mins after sunset until 30 mins before sunrise everything has to be cased.  S."
933569,dave524,2015-09-10 17:30:00,4508," i dont think it needs to be encased while in transport..   Under the Fish and Game it does after sunset.  Edit: 2 sets of rules are at play here , what might be legal under the Provincial Fish and Game might not be OK with the Federal Firearms Legislation.."
