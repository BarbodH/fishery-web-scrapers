933013,Tomcat,2015-09-07 16:24:00,395,"Hi Jay  We are staying in West Bay off of the main lake.  That is the only area that I have fished.  Have you been to Winawiash previously as well?  Cheers Craig  Yes, Craig, our group has fished out of Club Trout Lake (CTL) for the last 9 years. We have never fished the big lake, Lac Ã  la Truite. The first 7 years, we stayed on Lac Bay. We also fished Lac Pierre, the next lake over via a 100 yard portage from Lac Bay. In 2014 we fished Lac Winawiash for the first time and we returned there this past Aug. Our group departs tomorrow morning for a week (9-16 Sep) of walleye fishing on Lac Kikwissi (a lake about 18 miles SSW of the CTL main lodge). Hope we both have good trips.  Jay"
931540,wvmedic,2015-08-27 16:26:00,144,"Thought I would share some pictures of this years Zec Kipawa trip, we were there from July 24th to 30th. The weather was very hot, we did well though. I was very surprised to find that 90% of our fish was caught in 3 to 8 FOW, we only caught 10 to 20 Walleye in 16 FOW and they were suspended at about 10 feet deep.  We arrived camp on Friday the 24th and setup camp, we finished early enough to get about 2 hours of fishing in. We fished early morning and late afternoon finishing up Wednesday evening and packing out Thursday morning for the trip home.  With the heatwave in effect, my fishing partner and I still managed to boat nearly 100 Walleye in the little over 5 days and an unknown number of Northern. The numbers of Northern I would say was about equal to the Walleye, no big Northern but many above average.  The Northern Express.  Jeff   "

931549,adempsey,2015-08-27 17:12:00,1498,Sounds like a successful trip.    I've had my eye on Two Moon lodge for a while.  Hopefully I'll make a trip out there one day.

931568,jimmer,2015-08-27 19:39:00,2730,Sounds like it was a successful fishing trip. I find the fishing in Quebec quite amazing.
931604,floater,2015-08-27 21:32:00,220,Great trip. Very nice up there but those washboard roads in are killer on the equipment! More than two or three days really starts too add up too with those extra costs for fishing there.
931678,wvmedic,2015-08-28 10:53:00,144,"adempsey, I want to fish Lake Kipawa in the near future.  floater, yes the roads can be pretty bad, though this year they were in decent shape. The fees are not to bad, they did tac on a $15.00 fee per tent this year on top of the Zec fee though.   Glad you folks liked the pictures.  Jeff "
931682,can u fish,2015-08-28 12:11:00,326,Thanks for the report and photos Jeff the province of Quebec does offer a lot of great fishing you should check out Parc La Verandrye.  Cheers Mitch

Jeff  Assuming you went down the Maniwaki Rd, you could just go a bit further up the paved road and launch at Kipawa. After that it's just a matter of how far you want to travel by boat. My favorite lake for sure.  Cheers"

Two days of high humidex (high 80's) and one all day thunder storm curtailed our fishing to essentially 3 days out of 6. Still had fun.  Jay"
