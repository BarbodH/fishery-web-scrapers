933129,spincast,2015-09-08 09:31:00,3279,"But seriously, that is some awesome editing there Rick  Format & music was refreshing from the same old, same. yeah, well, Thanks Simon -  a lot of that is life from G's perspective - combined with we weren't really ready for the filming session. Had the cameras, but we weren't setup up quite yet..... got a bit to learn before we make an entry for TIFF I think My initial choice in music was the cause of the censorship - as it turns out, both tunes.So the tune that the title of the thread was referencing also had to go      Lesson learned re: Youtube - check the details on the video manager screen before releasing....  in all the learning curve challenges of moving to movies, looks like I forgot one of the nicest fish of the weekend   and now its off to work for another week. Gotta pay for all those miles on the boat this weekend."
