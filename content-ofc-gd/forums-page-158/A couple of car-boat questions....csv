928144,sauce,2015-08-06 18:25:00,219,If you want a ford ranger or a Mazda b series you better start looking. The 4 litre 4x4 is a solid little machine that can be beat on for years. A very popular model that is only available used now. Why did ford/ Mazda stop making these trucks? I just did some serious searching for a small truck and all I could find in the 4L 4x4 category was old high mileage at $6000 - $12000 or 5-6 year old trucks selling for $15000
928145,Raf,2015-08-06 18:28:00,3495,"be careful of the source of these tow ratings  the same vehicle in europe / asia / australia may be rated to tow xxxxlbs while in north america it is rated to tow zilch.  it doesn't mean it can't tow xxxxlbs but it does mean if you get into trouble, you ain't covered.  always check the canadian specs."
928151,lookinforwalleye,2015-08-06 19:01:00,4399,good advice Raf....could you imagine towing a 20/22 foot bass boat with a Golf LOL....having said that somebody will chime in and say they have done it before....
928180,huzzsaba,2015-08-06 22:48:00,884,"you should take a look at the volvo xc90 or xc70 from 2004 to 2007 with the 2.5t engine.  Solid AWD drivetrain and not heavy on gas. reliable and very comfortable family car and can tow 3500 lbs easily without the addition of anything. and if you want to check reviews, do not look at the reviews for the t6 models as the transmissions on those are no good.  check for the 2.5t and you are gold!"
933648,northernpike56,2015-09-11 01:22:00,717,"Hi guys,  went to go look at my first boat today! Now I have a couple more questions...  The boat is an older looking 12 ft starcraft, on a good condition trailer with an old 9.5 hp outboard on the back. The motor had the serial number in the usual spot, but I couldnt find a serial number anywhere on the boat or trailer... Do they usually not have serial numbers? (even my sportspal canoe had a serial number on it, so I'd think there would be one for an actual boat/trailer). The owner has the ownership for the trailer, but I would think I might have some trouble registering it without a very precise bill of sale that has a serial number written on it.  Also, in terms of the bill of sale, should I be getting him to write me three bills of sale, so I don't have to pay a huge amount of tax when just registering the trailer?  Thanks!"
933799,Bondar,2015-09-12 01:27:00,817,"If you don't plan on registering the boat than you'll just need 2 Bills of sale, one for the trailer. One for boat and motor to prove you now own it. If you want to register it than get 3 boat, motor and trailer. There is a form online that shows what they would like to see on a bill of sale as far as information goes."
927691,northernpike56,2015-08-04 18:20:00,717,"Hi guys,  First question:  The time has come for me where I have to sell my 1991 mazda miata convertible and buy a more practical car that I can use to get to school/work every day, but I want to also purchase a boat to tow with it. I'm thinking of purchasing a 12-14 foot aluminum with an engine no bigger than 9.9hp on the back. Two cars that have been appealing to me lately are a 2008-2009 mazda 3 GT sedan (fwd, 2.3L engine), and a 2005-2006 subaru impreza RS (awd, 2.5L engine). Would either of these two cars be suitable for towing my future boat, or should I be looking into getting something else? Any other vehicle options would be appreciated too!  EDIT: I really prefer to drive manual, but if there is some huge advantage to towing with an automatic, I'd like to hear anything about it too! (Also, I don't mind a bit of wear on the clutch from boat launches, thats just normal wear and tear to me)  Second question:  I have had a square stern sportspal canoe that I have mounted many small outboards to in the past, but obviously there is no ownership/insurance/registration I had to worry about with the canoe. Just have the boating license and the appropriate safety equipment, and you are always good to go. When I purchase said 9.9 hp aluminum boat and trailer, whats the registration/ownership process like for both the boat and the trailer? (i.e. when I purchased my miata, I had to get a bill of sale from the owner signed over to me, insurance for the vehicle, safety and e-test it, and then I was fit to register it with the government and get plates for the vehicle...) Is there any specific process like this for a small boat, or is it more a game of you just give the seller some cash and drive off with the boat and you are good to go? I would assume that there would be an ownership for the boat and trailer, so you can legally prove it's yours, but then again I really have no clue right now...  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Matt."
927716,Cosmos,2015-08-04 19:28:00,588,I used to tow my 14 footer with 25 hp Johnson with my Pontiac vibe. Had to put transmission cooler. Was OK to tow. I think  subary will be better vechile to tow also awd is necessary sometimes. Once you will buy a boat you will have to change Ontario registration - simple process. Just Google it for necessary instructions and form.
927717,Cosmos,2015-08-04 19:33:00,588,Forgot to add get 2 separate bills for boat and motor and trailer. You will have to register trailer with ministry of transportation to get a license plate.
927731,FloatnFly,2015-08-04 20:45:00,1640,"get a car with AWD, will make towing easier, and look at a diesel as well.  look at a subaru forester or a volkswagen tdi model"
927732,Bondar,2015-08-04 21:09:00,817,"You don't need to register a boat under 10hp (pretty sure) , so you'd just get the trailer ownership just like you have for your car  and a bill of sale for the boat and motor, and a separate bill of sale just the trailer. Say $100 Or so"
927739,Joeytier,2015-08-04 21:45:00,3990,"correct ^  There's a reason they're 9.9 and not 10 hp.  The Subaru will be better for towing and likely will end up being more reliable, though neither are ideal towing vehicles, but I'm sure you know that already"
927742,Sinker,2015-08-04 21:53:00,8692,Subies suck for towing and burn gas like crazy.  S.
927744,crappieperchhunter,2015-08-04 21:59:00,2582,I towed my 14 footer with a 15HP motor from 2004 until 2013 with my VW golf tdi diesel. Never had an issue and had great milage when I wasn't towing. Opted in 2013 for a bigger vehicle to tow a bigger boat.
927818,northernpike56,2015-08-05 03:27:00,717,"Thanks for all the responses guys. So, from my understanding now is that as long as I have the bill of sale/signed over ownership for the boat/motor, I should be fine out on the water. No registration/insurance or anything needed as long as its under 10 hp. (I guess the numbers painted on the side of the boat wouldnt mean anything to me either then).  In terms of the trailer, I just bring the bill of sale/signed ownership to the MTO and buy some plates?  I've been seeing a lot of ads on kijiji lately where the guy says he's ""lost the ownership to the boat and trailer, but you can register it as a homemade trailer"". Does this make any sense? I would assume that the gov't wouldnt allow some random guy to slap together a trailer in his garage, load a 1500 pound boat onto it, then pull it down the highway at 120 km/h...  Matt."
927820,chefboi17,2015-08-05 03:37:00,128,"you would think there would be more to getting trailer plates, but literally you can go in, say you built a trailer, give the color, approximate weight, number of axels, and pay like 35$ for plates. no inspections from what i know, but it has to have working lights, fenders, etc, otherwise you could get pulled over."
927822,Bondar,2015-08-05 03:51:00,817,"If the previous owner had the boat registered with numbers on the front I'd remove them if you plan on running a 9.9, you can register the boat but then you'll need to pay tax on the bill of sale for the boat"
927829,Joeytier,2015-08-05 06:22:00,3990,"Yeah, the only you need to have registered is the trailer"
927876,MrSimon,2015-08-05 14:25:00,217,"I've towed similar boats with 4 cylinder sedans, and it's just fine.  I towed a 14' boat with a 15HP outboard and a week's worth of gear from southern PA to Canada once with a 1997 Nissan Altima.  It did just fine.  If you will only be doing occasional towing and using decent ramps ..... just about anything will do .... pick what suits your daily needs best, throw a hitch on the back, and go fishing."
928051,Dabluz,2015-08-06 01:10:00,701,"I've got a 4 x 12 flat bed for hauling ATVs and snowmobiles that I also use to haul my 14 foot aluminum boat.  I drive an Impala and I don't even feel the trailer and contents behind the car.  I did have a Suzuki 4X4 and it also did a great job even though the motor was shot and would barely go up any hills,,,,even without a trailer.  A 12 to 14 foot aluminum boat on a boat trailer.....you could haul it by hand.....almost."
928069,northernpike56,2015-08-06 03:50:00,717,"Sounds good. Maybe a transmission cooler kit installed on my future car might be a good idea before I start to tow stuff, just because I want to keep whatever vehicle I get for a long time. Does anybody have any experience with the ford ranger 4x4 trucks? I believe they had a 4.0L V6 option too... Could be another potential car to look into."
928071,Bondar,2015-08-06 04:01:00,817,"I've had a 4x4 ranger since 2009 it's a 4.0l V6 and it's been a great vehicle. Other then regular stuff like brakes, and the 2 front wheel bearings I have done anything to it except for oil changes I've put 100k on it . Just not a lot of room in the cab not so good one piece fishing rods Or passengers . I put a fibreglass cap on it and have used it to sleep in on several fishing trips fits a air mattress"

My brother's Ranger with the 4.0L lasted him 250k miles with only the normal maintenance and repairs.  It's a good solid truck with plenty of towing power.  Down sides were terrible gas mileage and a relatively small interior.  You might laugh at me, but if I were in your shoes, I'd get a V6 Honda Accord with 100k miles on it.  Fairly cheap, reliable, efficient, comfortable, inexpensive to maintain, and plenty of power for towing."

Any car can pull that safely with no issues."
928096,craigdritchie,2015-08-06 13:16:00,1586," It all depends on what you're towing.  A small boat/outboard/trailer will be less than 1,000 pounds even with gas and gear.  Any car can pull that safely with no issues.  I agree, but that's not the issue. If the vehicle isn't rated to tow anything and you have an accident while pulling the boat, the insurance company can void the policy and leave you on the hook for all the bills.  The Subaru is a great vehicle with an awesome reputation, and because of that they can still be fairly pricey ... you'll have to look long and hard to find a deal on one. On the other hand, 4x4 Rangers are widely available at excellent prices. They may eat a little more gas, but they will cost less to buy so there's a bit of a wash there. I've had a couple of 4x4 Rangers in my life, all were excellent trucks that went through pretty much anything, lasted forever, and never cost me a dime beyond regular oil changes, wiper blades, tires and other basic maintenance. Very reliable truck, I can't recommend them highly enough."
