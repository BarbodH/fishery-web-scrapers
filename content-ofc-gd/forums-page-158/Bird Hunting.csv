933517,Beavertail,2015-09-10 14:03:00,331,"Good luck on your trip, hope you see lots of birds. I do all my hunting in southern Ontario, but a co-worker heads to the Chapleau area for a week every September, they usually do pretty well."
933518,Rod Caster,2015-09-10 14:06:00,5784,"I have 160 acres of bird-land with a couple kms of trails on it. I can't friggen wait until the 15th!!! Man I love bird/rabbit hunting.  We also have a surf n turf grouse n laker trip coming up soon. I've never planned a hunting and fishing mix trip, so I'm super stoked!  Good luck on your excursion Mikdor"

933601,Joeytier,2015-09-10 20:25:00,3990,"Our season in my ZEC opens on the 18th, so in a little over a week me and the girlfriend will be able to make a couple day trips in the truck bird-hunting with my 5-week old daughter in the back seat of the truck  Also, grouse are open until January 15th in Restigo so the first 3-4 weeks of ice fishing will cross into bird-hunting.  Pretty neat!"
933639,manitoubass2,2015-09-11 00:56:00,11391,Hunting partidge is my favourite.  Been doing it almost as long as fishing?  Some of the best meat in the world IMO  Its just a tease too there are so many right in the back yard lol
933719,lakerguy,2015-09-11 17:31:00,224,"Putting supplies in the cabin last year ,on our arrival a grouse flew into the back wall and broke its neck.  I was like this is too easy.  This is by far my favourite time of year"
