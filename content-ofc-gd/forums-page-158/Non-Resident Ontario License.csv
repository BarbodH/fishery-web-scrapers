933690,T-Bone,2015-09-11 13:01:00,160,"After a long wait me and a few of my long-time friends are heading up to Pigeon Lake in a couple weeks for a long-weekend of R&R. I looked online to see approximately how much a 3-day (or week) long Ontario Fishing license would cost for a non-resident and the site was nothing short of confusing. It reads in places like I need to order it online and print it myself....in others it's wildly inexpensive (like $6.50), but you have to be a ""member of an organized camp"". Not sure what that means...we're staying at an organized camp...not sure if that makes me a member though.  Anyway...can someone shine some light on please? We'd prefer conservation license, and really only need a 3-dayer.  Thanks."
933693,G.mech,2015-09-11 13:25:00,830,Each non-resident would have to buy an outdoors card and an 8 day non-resident license.   The card will be sent in the mail later but the 8 day license needs to be printed and carried (make a pdf copy just in case).   This can be done here:  http://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-licence-non-residents-canada  The outdoors card is about 10 bucks (good for 3 years) and an 8 day NR Sportfishing license is about 54 bones.  All prices are here:  http://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-licence-fees-non-canadian-residents#section-0
933712,T-Bone,2015-09-11 16:47:00,160,"Thanks for the info. I haven't fished in Ontario for at least 7-8 years, and the Outdoors Card is new to me. What's that for? Paid fee permission to fish in the lakes or be 'part of' the environment experience?"
933715,dave524,2015-09-11 17:11:00,4508,It's part of the government's hand in your pocket experience.
933718,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-11 17:31:00,10439,NOT !!!!!!  Fixed it fer ya!!!!
933749,Mister G,2015-09-11 21:06:00,1429,A outdoor card is like a NFL seat license that allows you to purchase a seat/fishing license......think MONEY GRAB at it's finest.
933768,Blue Lk,2015-09-11 22:16:00,337,"If you & your group are Canadian non-residents ie(another province),you can only buy 1 day or 1 yr licenses,Outdoors cards are needed for anything except 1 day.Non- Canadian fishermen can buy 8 day licenses & also need an Outsdoors card."
