I arrived Saturday night around 10, got unpacked and readied my gear for the morning hunt.  I was greeted by this sunrise on the water    After not a whole lot happening on the morning bite, I decided to take my daughter out in my inflatable to some weed patches for panfish on the ultralight, she caught her first fish, I set the hook, she reeled it in    Then it was time for some relaxin on the beach front    We headed out later that evening for some better fishing, ended getting into quite a few small pike like this one, also some bass, perch, more blue gill, and dinner plate sized crappie! lure of choice for me was a mepps black fury #4 tipped with a half of worm    Once the sunset, which was incredible, was time to head for dinner, some nice 2"" Prime grade NY Strip Steaks on the Q, eaten fireside!
