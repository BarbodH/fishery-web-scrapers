932741,John Bacon,2015-09-04 21:26:00,3277,"I drive a GMC Jimmy.  Yesterday, I had a really tough time getting the shifter out of park a couple of times.  It is an automatic shift on the centre consol.  Once I was able to get it in gear the transmission worked fine.  I know that there a few mechanics on the board.  I want to get this looked at so that I don't get stranded somewhere; like a boat launch for example.  Does this sound like something that needs to be looked at by a transmission specialist?  Or, should my local mechanic be able to handle it?  I am thinking the latter since the transmission seems to work fine once it is in gear.  Thanks"
932743,Roy,2015-09-04 21:40:00,13728,I have a Jimmy....I think your problem might have to do with the ignition switch.

932745,misfish,2015-09-04 21:45:00,29133,Could be the brake  sensor. You have to press the brake if Im not mistaken to shift. Just a thought.
932754,porkpie,2015-09-04 22:38:00,2521,"Used to happen to my old commuter civic.  Apparently there was a cable, or linkage that got a bit seized up.  My mechanic lubricated it every so often and all was good.  Apparently it's not that big of a deal to have replaced.  Not sure about Jimmy's, but just another thought."
932767,huzzsaba,2015-09-05 00:50:00,884,"When it happens again, just wiggle the keys and see if that helps, or take the keys out and put it back in very quickly.  Sometimes that will help if indeed it is the ignition switch.  it also helps to park with the steering wheel straight.  I find sometimes when parked with the wheels turned and the steering column locks, it can put added pressure to the ignition switch causing all kinds of problems."
932769,KLINKER,2015-09-05 01:03:00,256,My first thought was the key but its a console shift. Might be something to do with the brake.

932811,wallyboss,2015-09-05 14:27:00,1095,Were you parked on an incline?  if you put pressure?? on the transmission before turning off the key it might be hard to get it back in gear? It happen to me once with my escape and that was the only thing I could think of. ( But I am not a mechaninc!!!)

I was taught to always set the emergency brake before shifting to park when parking on an incline.

My drive way has a much greater incline than where I was parked the two times that it did happen.
933156,SBCregal,2015-09-08 14:55:00,688,does the shifter move fine once it is out of park or is it really stiff?  If it moves easily once out of park i'd look at the shift interlock or brake switch.  if it is really difficult to move once out of park it is likely the shifter cable.  my dad had a 2000 or so jimmy and had to have the cable replaced
