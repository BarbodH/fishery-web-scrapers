932569,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-03 21:13:00,8243,"For a rectifier would a local dealer not suffice? I don't order on line for parts, are they that less expensive than buying Canadian? Down here I find dealers have great, well good, prices on some parts and expensive for something else at the same place and vice versa. They matched the price of my steering cable here for the price on line from the States. It was in stock too. I like picking them up locally as I don't want the boat sitting while it's fishing season waiting for a part. We ordered a crate engine and they said 4 to 6 weeks, that was in June, finally came last Friday. Great price though.  PS I think your thread is very fishing related Chris unless you fish from a dock and use the boat for something else, no?"

The local dealer is good, I'm just trying to save a little money but I may end up at the dealer in Kinmount.  I'm still running with the burnt rectifier, I just have to take the battery out and charge it myself every couple days.  Good points as usual Old Iron, thanks.  Thanks Dave \/ \/ \/  I don't want to put on a part that doesn't fit Klinker, thanks Gallie"
