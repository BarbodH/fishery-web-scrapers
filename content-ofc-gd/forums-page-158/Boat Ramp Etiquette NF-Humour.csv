932517,Headhunter,2015-09-03 18:14:00,5703,I need a shovel. HH
932518,manitoubass2,2015-09-03 18:18:00,11391,Hahahahah two thumbs up!
932527,206,2015-09-03 19:03:00,563,good one!
932530,kickingfrog,2015-09-03 19:13:00,8333,I need a shovel. HH   Can I borrow it when you're done?  Along those lines I'm not a huge fan of those floating speakers with 400hp inboards either. The good thing is after this weekend they almost completely disappear until next July 1st.

The good thing is after this weekend they almost completely disappear until next July 1st. Best time of year lol. Sunrise isn't 5 am anymore, all the fish are putting on the feedbag, everything is still open and the ""let's see how fast this boat goes"" crowd is pretty much gone. The lake is left to the fishermen."

932801,Gallie,2015-09-05 09:17:00,1215,Not bad lol
932927,Fisherman,2015-09-06 18:28:00,7201,I think I might have a shovel like that..
932933,kickingfrog,2015-09-06 19:26:00,8333,"I think I might have a shovel like that.. How do you get the impressions out of it? Or do you leave them in for ""character""?"
932936,Fisherman,2015-09-06 19:47:00,7201,"Saturdays you swing clockwise, Sundays counterclockwise.  Holidays, just wail away."
932937,kickingfrog,2015-09-06 19:49:00,8333,"Good, don't want to favour one side too much."
