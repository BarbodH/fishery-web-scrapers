933211,grt1,2015-09-08 21:54:00,638,I was just in town at the local marina and noticed a sign on the door . the mnr has just sent out notices of an invasive species found and confirmed in the red lake area waters.  I didn't have my cheater glasses but the fellow behind the counter said it was the spiney water flea that has been found.    
933212,fishindevil,2015-09-08 21:56:00,6254,Yes they are sure spreading fast and the MNR can't keep up with the reported sightings all over Ontario sad and very alarming ......
933215,chris.brock,2015-09-08 22:08:00,4053,"Yep, noticed them for the first time this summer on my lake in Haliburton. Not nearly as thick as Lake O though."
933219,Gallie,2015-09-08 22:33:00,1215,"Thats a real shame, after every trip to lake o i have to meticulously clean all the fleas off the riggers, rods, reels, lines, and inside and out of the boat. I can see how some might not go through the trouble after heading to thier next destination. A few minutes from each individual can help stop these things from happening."
933220,grt1,2015-09-08 22:37:00,638,"so the wife asked, what do these things do, I didn't know, maybe you southern Ontario guys who deal with them can give us some info."
933234,FloatnFly,2015-09-08 23:50:00,1640,they wreak havoc on native zooplankton populations that small fish feed on
933238,Gerritt,2015-09-09 00:10:00,6129,Are they only found out in the blue zone? I ask because the bay's I fish are connected to lake O I have yet to see them In 4 years
933239,BillM,2015-09-09 00:15:00,17367,"Are they only found out in the blue zone? I ask because the bay's I fish are connected to lake O I have yet to see them In 4 years  Nope, they're pretty much everywhere in Lake O.   I've seen them way up north in Ontario (In places where you'd never expect)"
933265,captpierre,2015-09-09 02:20:00,2521,Is this advisory so folks don't spread them further? Are they in the kawarthas?
933273,John Bacon,2015-09-09 03:03:00,3277,Are they only found out in the blue zone? I ask because the bay's I fish are connected to lake O I have yet to see them In 4 years  They are usually fairly deep; but not limited to just the blue zone.  If you are fishing a shallow bay you probably will not see them.
933278,chris.brock,2015-09-09 03:44:00,4053, They are usually fairly deep; but not limited to just the blue zone.  If you are fishing a shallow bay you probably will not see them.  Is it possible to actually see them?  I only see the mass of white crap on my line while downrigging.
933279,FloatnFly,2015-09-09 04:08:00,1640,they prefer deep clear lakes
933294,Joeytier,2015-09-09 12:32:00,3990,"They seem to be spreading all over the place last few years, likely from people trailering around and not cleaning their gear off"
