I'M A DAMN DOG! -------------------------------------------------- '3'  Taking me for a walk, then             not letting me check stuff out.             Exactly whose walk is this anyway? -------------------------------------------------- '4'  Any trick that involves balancing food on my nose. Stop it! -------------------------------------------------- '5'  Any haircut that involves bows or ribbons.        Now you know why we chew your stuff up when you're not home. -------------------------------------------------- '6'  The slight of hand, fake fetch throw.          You fooled a dog! Whoooo Hoooooooo what           a proud moment for the top of the food chain! -------------------------------------------------- '7'  Taking me to the vet for 'the big snip', then acting          surprised when I freak out every time we go back! -------------------------------------------------- '8'  Getting upset when I sniff the crotches of your guests.         Sorry, but I haven't quite mastered that handshake thing yet. -------------------------------------------------- '9'  Dog sweaters. Hello?  Haven't you noticed the fur? --------------------------------------------------  '10'  How you act disgusted when I lick myself.              Look, we both know the truth. You're just jealous."
