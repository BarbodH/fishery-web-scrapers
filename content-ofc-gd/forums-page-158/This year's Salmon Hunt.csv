933680,huzzsaba,2015-09-11 10:44:00,884,So I have been hearing a lot from the locals about port hope area doing well. Wondering if it's true since I plan to go there next week just to check it out. It's far from home so just want to make sure it's worth the trip. Also wondering if they are already running up the river . Would be nice to see them jumping the fish ladder.
933783,BowSlayer101,2015-09-11 23:33:00,296,"They have been in the porthope area rivers for a month now, all brown now mostly so I stopped until the cohos start running, few bows and browns around, after this rain its a safe bet that you will catch at any given east trib, cant say anything about fresh fish though, that's up to you and how much legwork you are willing to put in..."
931016,captpierre,2015-08-24 13:30:00,2521,So. Used to fish Lake O a lot. Only once this year with a skunk. What is the consensus? Good or bad year? Size. Numbers. I hear not so good.
931022,Gallie,2015-08-24 14:02:00,1215,"Terrible year for us, nowhere near the number of matures we normally see and a lack of teen kings as well. Normal amount of shakers and steehead, only 1 coho all season as well. I only fished out of bluffers so guys out east may have a different story."
931038,leaf4,2015-08-24 16:25:00,2466,"Not so great here either, been going to lake Erie and having awesome walleye/bass days instead"
931049,LeXXington,2015-08-24 17:34:00,1928,PC so far this year has been a ghost town.. few and far between.
931057,Salmonidstalker,2015-08-24 18:18:00,265,West end was hot in spring. East end is hot now. Hot meaning best fishing but by far another terrible year for numbers. Good thing MNR is around to fix things....insert sarcasm.
931063,John Bacon,2015-08-24 18:53:00,3277,I definitely had better luck this year than last year.  I have not been fishing Lake Ontario regularily for many years so I don't have much to compare to.  The last few times that I have been out the other boaters seem to have caught quite a few fish.
931099,Steve,2015-08-24 22:23:00,2075,West end was hot in spring.  Care to elaborate on that?
931101,irishfield,2015-08-24 22:25:00,26272,I think there was a boat fire Steve....
931102,Steve,2015-08-24 22:28:00,2075,that would be the only thing that brought heat to the west end of Lake Ontario in 2015.  That - or tons and tons and tons and tons and did i mention TONS of Lakers?!
931117,huzzsaba,2015-08-24 23:58:00,884,"This is the first time I am actively fishing for Salmon, but I am doing so from the pier. 2 weeks ago, they seem to be jumping at Bronte mouth, but since then things have quieted down.  I am pretty sure the head of the fish looked like salmon but now I'm wondering if it really was Salmon or maybe something else?!?  Whatever they were, headed back to deep water and never looked back lol."
931123,Steve,2015-08-25 00:20:00,2075,"keep an eye on the winds.  it might be that two weeks ago the surface water temps were colder....  keep an eye on north winds....they'll blow out the warm surface water and let the cold water in...  a few days of south or east winds and the warm water is back....  when you see them on the surface, usually it is because the water is cold (50's)."
931136,spincast,2015-08-25 01:00:00,3279,"the view down my chute ---  2014 was tough, especially compared to 2013 and 2012. 2015 is tough compared to 2014 this goes for kings, ho's and bows  There are fish to be had - but it ain't the fishery it was just a few years ago. Hopefully the stagers will give us something to justify our investment this year."
931137,Steve,2015-08-25 01:01:00,2075,"Look out, I'm running down your chute  exact same observations."
931155,fishnsled,2015-08-25 02:21:00,3520,"I was down that chute as well till Sunday, Likely the best 2.5 hours of fishing I've every had out there.  I guess I should do a report up."
931156,Steve,2015-08-25 02:22:00,2075,west end?
931158,fishnsled,2015-08-25 02:26:00,3520,east end
931162,Steve,2015-08-25 02:37:00,2075,man...you had me slightly excited for a second....  i was up on huron this past weekend for a bachelor party ... thought maybe a fish or two made it past the wall that was built at ashbridges bay.
931169,fishnsled,2015-08-25 03:33:00,3520,"Sorry Steve, hoping they show up soon for you westenders.  Report is up though."
931171,Tim Mills,2015-08-25 03:34:00,476,I hear water is very cold. shakers only closer to shore.  matures are in the 300ft depth.  Bronte guy told me this for what it's worth. Very slow this year.
931176,Freshtrax,2015-08-25 04:43:00,2215,"Lol same thing as all year.    I've fished grimsby and bronte all year, biggest fish has been 15 lbs."
931199,BillM,2015-08-25 12:43:00,17367,Get ready for those staging fish...
931278,tonyb,2015-08-25 21:38:00,1637,"I typically fish the GOSD pretty hard each year.  This year was a lot like last year, so I learned from that and spent all my time fishing out East.  I had a great year, if comparing to what others were reporting, but only because I was travelling East of Toronto on the weekends.  Many times during the week for evenings I wouldn't even bother heading out despite having a ramp pass in Oakville and the lake being only 15 minutes away, it's all about location....  You won't see this at Bronte!...fishing is easy with quantities of Kings like this   (Sorry I can't seem to embed Google photos on this forum)  https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2bPtnVCPtnE7vKvHfISSuKjCXvQZBqRu9o8JbaqrJFrj=w1698-h955-no   https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1d7EoKsK8tCEgNgrhp40SA7hdhih3dOjhZBjYycQg7OQ=w1778-h930-no  A lot of people also get stuck doing the same thing year after year, ignoring what the conditions and fish are telling you.  You have to adapt to the conditions, and for sure, don't keep doing what isn't working.  That definitely means starting by fishing where the fish are, then by dialing into them based on repeating what succeeds, no different than any other type of fishing.  I hope we have a milder winter (but not too mild that ice fishing is unsafe on Simcoe ) to give these fish a break, back to back frigid winters seems to me as the culprit more than anything else.  The good news is that the Halton Region Salmon and Trout Association has a new Pen Rearing project at Bronte, and there are talks of improving the method of stocking for the fish that are put in at the Shipping Canal in Hamilton. (e.g. not dumping them during the day to feed the birds)  It would be nice to not have to drive so far to fish the derby competitively.  I am kinda glad those 2:30am starts are over for another year...  Tony"
931300,Steve,2015-08-25 23:36:00,2075,you certainly had another great year Tony.  I was really rootin' for ya to win.
931303,huzzsaba,2015-08-25 23:46:00,884,What is the best place for spoon chucking from the pier out east?  I have never fished out east so have no clue of the area.   Also curious if anyone knows if fishing is allowed from the oakville pier at the mouth of sixteen mile creek? There is always talks about port credit and bronte but never of the oakville one.
931332,Rich Nelson,2015-08-26 02:48:00,332,"South shore was great in the spring, but has been very slow since. 2 tough years in a row, hope next season is better."
