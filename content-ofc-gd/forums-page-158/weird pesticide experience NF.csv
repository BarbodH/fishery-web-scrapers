932808,Rod Caster,2015-09-05 13:02:00,5784,"There is likely a local forest management group (here is Nipissing Forest Resource Management) that has some authority over spraying, logging practices etc. They might have some info.  Their number was on one of those signs near one of my borthers  Speckled Trout creeks. It was Glycosphate as well.  Sudbury CBC had a spot where an environmentalist nobody discussed this issue with professional forester...let's just say the forester sounded WAYYY more credible and actually provided some good information.  What I took away from the spot, was that it's extremely diluted, has been extensively tested and it's just way cheaper than manual cutting.  Are you saying that your buddy actually got sprayed-on (you said he felt 'rain' and tasted nickel. That potentially could be bad and should be reported to a doctor and the MNR for exposure."
932810,manitoubass2,2015-09-05 14:14:00,11391,"I hear ya.  She told me it works very well for giving the softwoods a year or two growth advantage over hardwoods or the hardwoods just take over.  She also said they have ""military grade electronics to track the dispersal of glycophosphate"" so she could look on her computer data to see if any had been near the road(my buddy was standing on)  Then she started talking to me about foraging and fishing and she sounded totally clueless about nature, so it was an odd conversation.  She was very pleasant and insightful  Id just like to know how this effects the local wildlife"
932822,Blue Lk,2015-09-05 16:03:00,337,"They have been spraying the forested slashes north of Dryden for years. I used to hunt in WMU 5 & have seen the results.The biggest impact (imo) is on the moose.Their favorite browse is the young tender hardwoods,over the last few years much of the moose population has moved on to greener pastures."
932825,dave524,2015-09-05 16:27:00,4508,By slashes I assume you mean clear cuts. Yes the browsing would be better in an unsprayed clearcut after a few years. Before cutting though it was probably a mature even aged spruce or pine forest with next to no browse. Burns or clear cuts are only attractive to browsing animals for a few years and as they mature the animals move on.
932829,manitoubass2,2015-09-05 17:19:00,11391,"Blue lk,  Same as south of dryden  Huge decline in moose populations"
932951,chris.brock,2015-09-07 01:08:00,4053,"The use of spray to help the spruce has been used for a long time. I admit I don't know all the science behind it, but intuitively this doesn't sound like a good ecological idea to me.  Not cool turning the boreal forest into a tree farm.  A mixed forest is a healthy forest."
932952,dave524,2015-09-07 01:35:00,4508,"Chris , Boreal Forests are typically even aged single species forests born out of fire, not unlike a tree farm but without the neat rows."
932959,manitoubass2,2015-09-07 02:21:00,11391,"Possibly, but usually at the hands of nature, not pesticides/herbicides  As nasty as they can be, ill take the forest fire please/preferably caused by lightening"
932960,chris.brock,2015-09-07 02:33:00,4053,"Chris , Boreal Forests are typically even aged single species forests born out of fire, not unlike a tree farm but without the neat rows.  I don't know.  I've been to northern places without logging. Spruce, poplar, birch, jackpine and tamarack, all fighting for the same real estate."
932975,dave524,2015-09-07 13:21:00,4508," I don't know.  I've been to northern places without logging. Spruce, poplar, birch, jackpine and tamarack, all fighting for the same real estate.  What you are seeing is probably an area in the middle stages of succession, This lesson has a good writeup and graphics of the stages. Also perhaps what you see is known as the ""Edge Effect "" you will see greater diversity along the edge of a forest or where a road bisects a forest because of the lateral sunlight penetration , this allows many more different species of flora to grow than is possible further in. These edges are very attractive to wildlife because of this diversity, you will see far more grouse along a logging road or along the edge than deep into a woods for example.  http://www.arlis.org/docs/vol1/83599936/boreal_forest_succession.html  The use of these herbicides speed up this succession returning the forest to its original mature state which is surely  what was  originally cut."
932678,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 14:50:00,11391,"So my buddie drives puralator currier truck and has to drive up the dryden highway frequently(at night).  He messaged me and said he pulled over at cedar narrows road(limeyangler im sure you know the road).  Its got wicked fishing lakes and is a very popular hunting spot in NW ontraio  Anyhow my buddy pulled over because he seen weird low flying lights and he wanted to take pictures. Next thing ya know hes being rained on with a mist and said it tasted like nickel???  He looked around and found this sign posted near the cedar narrow entrance road    Anyone ever seen a sign like this? What the heck language is it in?  There is no farm land anywhere near this place, its all lakes,swamp and thick bush.  Kinda weird IMO"
932679,dave524,2015-09-04 15:00:00,4508,"I'm guessing Ojibway or Cree, could be the ministry spraying for pests like spruce budworm."
932680,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 15:05:00,11391,"Yep its ojibwe sylabics  I was thrown off by the triangle in for W  I wish i could make out the number and call, see what the issue is"
932682,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 15:07:00,11391,Id also assume they spray at night to avoid spraying humans?
932684,adolson,2015-09-04 15:27:00,783,"807-?75-8723  Only one number in there I couldn't make out, but you could figure it out by making 10 calls or less."
932685,BillM,2015-09-04 15:41:00,17367,Spraying for aliens.
932686,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 15:41:00,11391,It would ne 275 for this area  I tried to call and it just drops the call asap  MNR would know i would imagine. Ill try them
932687,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 15:42:00,11391, Im protected by tinfoil at least???
932688,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 15:55:00,11391,"Well i called the forestry division and left a message.  Hopefully see whats up.  Hopefully its not anything too bad, fish up there lots"
932689,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 16:19:00,11391,"Hmmm, even the mnr doesnt know whats going on?  He said if it was MNR it would likely be herbecide and they fly at dusk or dawn to get a controlled spray when the winds are down, almost never at night"
932690,vance,2015-09-04 16:21:00,719,We where out atving around mattawa 2 weeks ago and we were stopped from using the road while they were spraying. Same signs. We were told that as soon as they stopped spraying we could continue on our way which we did. Were told we didn't have anything to worry about the insecticide they were using which was for bud worms.  vance
932692,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 16:41:00,11391,"Just off the phone with resolute forest products.  They are spraying the area with ""vision max/round up/ glycophosphate"" to keep the hardwoods from competing with the softwoods"
932693,dave524,2015-09-04 17:12:00,4508,"That is not too cool, spraying for budworm with Bacillus thuringiensis is pretty safe as it is more of a biological control being a bacteria that attacks caterpillars, herbicides on the other hand are pretty nasty stuff, a little surprised they are still doing stuff like that on a large scale."
932695,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 17:19:00,11391,"I was pretty shocked to hear.  Glycophosphate is nasty stuff to spray all over the bush  She also said numerous times, ""to protect HER grids""  Like she owns the forest lol"
932711,dave524,2015-09-04 18:39:00,4508,"I have taken a few courses in Silviculture , Forestry U of T Class of 74, eventually ended up in an unrelated field      Seems that they now spray fairly recently cut over areas with herbicides to reduce the competition between the faster growing broad leafed plants and deciduous seedlings with the slower, more desirable coniferous spruce and pines. I assume that the broad leaf plants get a significantly higher dose than the thin spruce and pine needles effectively weeding them out and let the spruce and pines survive. Not crazy about the practice but here is a piece of propaganda on the subject.  http://www.sudburyforest.com/herbicideuse.html"
932729,glen,2015-09-04 20:22:00,2641,I'm glad it's safe.
932732,Dara,2015-09-04 20:35:00,3052,"I'm glad it's safe.   Yeah, its only for killing trees"
932748,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 21:57:00,11391,Only hardwoods?  Yeah totally safe lol

932790,dave524,2015-09-05 02:55:00,4508,"Salt and vinegar will kill weeds and we put it on our French Fries. These roundup type herbicides are way safer than the stuff used in the 50's and sixties , remembering Atrazine on corn and using 2-4-D and 2-4-5-T to kill weeds in the vineyards and orchards, you older folk may remember a cocktail of the last 2 as Agent Orange a defoliant used in the Vietnam conflict and responsible for a lot of health issues with servicemen. Our railways and hydro crews used it to keep their easements clear of bush too."
932792,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-05 02:57:00,8243,"Last year we are perch fishing off of Pt. Bruce. A low flying crop duster goes by and sprays on the lake. One guy's boat got sprayed and his wind shield has residue on it. He's flipping out on the radio, I don't blame him. I contact the MNR, as well as the MOE. Are pesticides in the tank, what were they doing, did you know? I never got a call back. There is a thread started on another Fishing forum. A farmer that ""says"" he is local chimes in and says they are practicing dusting and there was residual chemical in the tanks, not to worry. The question is why over water not a field that could use water in a field? Why so close to the boats.? No reply. The guy joined that day and he deletes his response and quits the forum.  Government conspiracy I say to keep us fishing guys calm and not vote."

Anyhow, dumpimg mass quantities of glycophasphate on the bush troubles me  And as nice as she was, she referred to the areas as ""her plots"" numerous times.
