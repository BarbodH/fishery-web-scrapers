932348,bobowski,2015-09-02 11:21:00,360,Spent some time fishing southern Georgian Bay last week with my bro and some buddies. We typically target Bass and Pike but catch the odd Musky accidentally. We had a blast fishing and tubing with some late night bevy's mixed in.                  
932351,bigbuck,2015-09-02 11:31:00,2449,"Nice. Fishing with boys, tubing, meat and cold beer. Recipe for fun."
932422,captpierre,2015-09-02 21:53:00,2521,You did well. Pretty area.
932554,Moosebunk,2015-09-03 20:28:00,3970,Looks like fun was had.  And congrats on the ski!

932623,SirCranksalot,2015-09-04 01:23:00,3291,"Nice to see men with facial hair.............  Doug  Doesn't turn me on, but different strokes for different folks I guess!"
932630,akaShag,2015-09-04 02:17:00,2073,"Back to SirCranksaLot...........  Look at my avatar, that's me...........  Facial hair is a GOOD thing!"
932865,SirCranksalot,2015-09-06 01:02:00,3291,That's real? I wasn't sure what with Photoshop and all. I bet you'd have a lot of fun at the Ont Sci Center with their Van der Graaf generator!!!
932875,Gallie,2015-09-06 02:30:00,1215,Good fishing fellas! Aka shag that beard is seriously respectable! 10/10
932883,akaShag,2015-09-06 13:16:00,2073,"Yes that is my real hair and at that time my beard was about half-way down my chest, with several beard hairs touching my belly button.  The photo was a ""special effects""  picture that showed all of the hair as standing out from my head.  Here I am with a three month beard.     I get it trimmed right down when I get my hair cut at Easter and Christmas............  And so yes I think it is a very proper thing that men have facial hair.  And how about that fishing trip, eh!!!!"
932884,akaShag,2015-09-06 13:16:00,2073,OK fixed it
