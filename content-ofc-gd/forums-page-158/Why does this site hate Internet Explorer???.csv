932289,Oggie,2015-09-02 00:04:00,588,I was an IE guy but I got tired of the various glitches.  I'm trying Mozilla on the advice of this thread.  Maybe I can even POST effectively.
932406,aplumma,2015-09-02 20:30:00,6896,"Still the most used browser on the internet, works everywhere else. Actually it isn't and it has issues on other sites as well Wayne. The code for IE is restricted and many sites/providers are moving away from it to the open codes that are available on chrome and firefox. If we want to tear down the site again we could get a provider that is more IE friendly however not all of our important information would cross over and could make it necessary to wipe all of the accounts as well as losing the money invested in the past. Kind of a no brainer as to whether it is worth making IE  more friendly to this site.  Art"
932408,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-02 20:43:00,8243,OK so I am willing to join the 21st century. Now what do I choose amongst all those recommended. I tried downloading Chrome months ago and I couldn't do it properly for some reason and was told by an I.T. expert that owns her own tech support operation that administrates more than a few Gov. agencies not to use it. She told me why but don't recall right now.  So what do I use?
932432,aplumma,2015-09-02 22:57:00,6896,You can use firefox if chrome is not to your liking. Chrome is what I use and have no issues. I also used firefox which has less demand on your resources. Chrome has more bells and whistles when it is used on different sites. Chrome does allow more information to be collected anonymously by websites and google but to be fair you give out way more info on the web by yourself than your browser does.   Art
932444,FloatnFly,2015-09-03 01:01:00,1640,"both are chrome and firefox are similar in the way they work, ie tabbed browsing.  which is so so so much nicer than having 4 windows of IE open at once.  both browsers will save your most visited sites for easy navigation when you open a new tab, click the new+ sign on firefox, or the blank tab on chrome, adding pages to your bookmarks collection is so simple, click the star on chrome in the name bar, box will pop up, you can rename the page to what you want, click ok.  for me, i love chrome, its fast, easy to use, and has everything i want, the g/f loves firefox, cause she can customize the top menu bar and make it look pretty.  IE is so far behind in what a web browser should be, and that simple, fast and user friendly  another point to chrome, since its made by google, type in a search word in the address bar, and it take you to google and bring the results for you, firefox takes you to yahoo by default"

932464,dave524,2015-09-03 10:28:00,4508,"I've been running Windows 10 the last month with their new browser, Edge. it is a tabbed browser with minimal stuff and bars at the top, still doesn't do the quote thingy in here. Looks somewhat like Chrome, which I also have on this laptop."
932472,FloatnFly,2015-09-03 11:40:00,1640, Firefox takes me to Google by default.   Mine as Well.   hmm  might be something in the settings
932516,davey buoy,2015-09-03 18:13:00,5505,How many times JD do you need to be told ?  .Just get Firefox and be done with it.I thought you read all the posts .  . Good luck either way you go !!!!.Just get off IE.
932533,adolson,2015-09-03 19:23:00,783,I use Chrome on Linux; works fine for me. I'm surprised there are still people using IE.

933137,craigdritchie,2015-09-08 12:09:00,1586,Internet Explorer has so many security flaws in it that you really should replace it with anything else. Seriously.
932234,akaShag,2015-09-01 20:18:00,2073,"YES I am an old fogey, so let's get that out of the way first.  NO I do not want Google Chrome, it interferes with other stuff.  Just about every time I am here, ""a problem with this website caused Internet Explorer to stop working"" and it has to re-load the program.  Or sometimes just kicks out completely.  No cut and paste, no hyperlinks, etc  Is there a technical reason?Doug"
932236,Gerritt,2015-09-01 20:25:00,6129,"Yes, it's Internet explorer itself..... What version are you using?"
932237,akaShag,2015-09-01 20:27:00,2073,How would I tell?

932242,AKRISONER,2015-09-01 20:34:00,5558,FYI Internet exploder is no longer supported by Microsoft. Hence your problems are going to increase over time as IE doesnt update to keep up with the internet of today.  Please change to firefox or chrome...for the love of humanity.
932244,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-01 20:48:00,8243,"I use Explorer. Other than not being able to use the quote feature I don't have any issues. I used to get the same "" Explorer stopped working"" thing as you but it was my PC. New PC, no problems. And I'm not getting Google Chrome either just so I can use the quote thingy. Is that a computer term ""thingy""?"

932252,Dan668,2015-09-01 21:16:00,1120,Explorer is a terrible browser.
932254,aplumma,2015-09-01 21:31:00,6896,The outdated IE does not like the code that we have to use to keep this site up. We have an upgrade coming up that we will be forced to do and it will try to address some of the IE issues but it will just trade one issue for another is some unknown areas. It is not an issue of money on the upgrades it is the reformatting of the skins and all of the other plug ins we have to make comparable. The running of a site that is this big is quite a bit of work behind the scenes.   Art
