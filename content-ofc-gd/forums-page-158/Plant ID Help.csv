931877,npt1,2015-08-30 00:03:00,220,"From the photos, My guess is the plant is Giant Hogweed. If so, the sap from it can cause severe burning irritation to the skin. Give it a wide berth."
931880,dave524,2015-08-30 00:13:00,4508,It's a white variety of Joe Pye Weed that is quite common in wet swales and marshes. Usually  find the lavender variety around here .  https://www.google.ca/search?q=eupatorium+maculatum+bartered+bride&sa=X&biw=1301&bih=585&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&ved=0CCUQsARqFQoTCJHd6pzCz8cCFYs9kgod-TgDYg ​

Give it a wide berth.  the leaves are a dead give away that its not hogsweed.  these are long and relatively thin, where on the hogsweeds, the leaves are similar in shape to that of a maple, but only much larger, with rounded points"
931949,Sinker,2015-08-30 17:16:00,8692,I've always called that queen anne lace.....or something like that lol  S.
931954,FloatnFly,2015-08-30 17:46:00,1640,"Queen Ann's Lace is completely different, the leaves are thin and feathery, the stalks are thin and curved, and the flowers looks like a tumble weed when bunch up"
931961,manitoubass2,2015-08-30 18:52:00,11391,Yep. We have that in our yard
931962,dave524,2015-08-30 18:59:00,4508,"Yep. We have that in our yard  As a kid we called that wild carrot before we knew better cause it smelled like carrots if you crushed the leaves and stems. Still think the plant in question is Boneset, a medicinal herb of the family that includes Joe Pye Weed."
932440,FloatnFly,2015-09-03 00:05:00,1640,"Confirmation from Ontario Invasive Plant Council, it is boneset, thanks dave524"
932455,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-03 05:09:00,8243,There was a recent article in the Simcoe Informer ID ing all sorts of toxic plants common to Southern Ontario that look just like what I always called Queen Anne's lace and other harmless looking plants. Come to find out our Queen Anne's lace isn't and it is toxic. After reading that article I won't be looking in the woods for my wayward golf balls anytime soon. Not that I don't hit straight mind you.
932465,singingdog,2015-09-03 10:29:00,1047,"Boneset. At one time it was used as a treatment for breakbone fever, as well as other fevers."
932503,highdrifter,2015-09-03 15:29:00,2534,Yep.  Mom used to call it herbe à fièvre..  (Fever weed)  And it's good for constipation doncha know!!
932632,Dave Bailey,2015-09-04 02:40:00,1641,"Yeah, looks like boneset. Do NOT confuse it with the similar looking water hemlock, which is so poisonous that you don't even want to touch it. Just tasting it could kill, swallowing isn't necessary. http://www.perverdonk.com/wild%20flowers/Parsnip/Spotted%20Water%20Hemlock/200307281030%20Spotted%20Water%20Hemlock%20(Cicuta%20maculata)%20-%20Manitoulin%20Island.htm"

932842,dave524,2015-09-05 20:39:00,4508,"In keeping with this turn of the thread and herbicides, anyone else remember the early 70's , when the US war on drugs was spraying Mexican herbs with Paraquat, nobody would touch Mexican weed back then for fear of getting more chemical than you bargained for. MB2 better watch your field for low flying copters  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraquat"
