932854,NANUK,2015-09-05 23:13:00,797,"After trying all kinds of tie down straps, I finally bit the bullet and installed a set of stainless steel Boat Buckle retractable transom tie downs . They are not cheap but the best tie downs I have ever used, no more fumbling and readjusting every time. I kick myself for not Getting them earlier ."
932856,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-05 23:57:00,10439,Boat buckles on my trailer too. Regular tiedows suck!
932898,KraTToR,2015-09-06 15:11:00,506,"THese are the ratchet type, not the regular cam-lock tie downs.  Fulton gives them a 5 yr warranty.  I will check into the Boat Buckles tho.  Cheers!"

932970,fishindevil,2015-09-07 11:20:00,6254,Yup boat buckle gets my approval I have been using one form or another of them for years & years !!! Just put a new set on this summer !!! Good for another 3-5yrs !!!! They stay tight and don't fail but cause of the many miles I do every year they just wear out eventually but that's ok !!! Just like tires they are a wear item but Are well made and last along time.      Cheers
932973,KraTToR,2015-09-07 13:00:00,506,"Sprayed a little WD-40 lithium on the ratchet mechanism, careful not to get any on the strap.  They work better than new now..  Thanks everyone!"
