384903,bassfighter,2009-09-19 18:03:00,366,"Caught my 11th Salmon within the last 3 outings for the past 2 weeks, lucky to have hit an early Salmon run.  I am still trying to recuperate from lack of sleep, but it was all worth it. A fishing ritual I must do this time of the year.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing016.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing019.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing020.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing007.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing002.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing005.jpg  The Salmon temp seemed to be warmer than the surface air temperature, which is normally the other way around. Only during my first Salmon outing, the Salmon fought real hard. On the last 2 outing, the fight was just mediocre. I was using 10lb mono and no problem landing them within 5-10 minutes.  One of the photos show my 14 year old son complaining that the fish was a bit too heavy, he also landed his first 3 Salmon of his life, this is his second year trying.  Lots of Salmon this year and not as crowded yet, saw a lot landed since we caught the early run. I added my home made oyster and garlic oil extract( bought from Dollarama) to my roe and marshmellow, it was quite potent. My friend was using my roe and marshmellow, was fishing beside me for 3 hours and no luck, until he decided to add some of my secret receipe, and made a believer out of him.  I introduce a tennis buddy to this Salmon fishing sport on my last outing, he also caught and lost couple. Some anglers across us decide to cut his line when his line, with a fighting Salmon, went across and accidentally tangled other's line. We did call ""Salmon coming across"", but those guys were rude.  Rain coming this week, this will be a major run."

384943,KelfuN,2009-09-19 21:05:00,246,great pics! always good to hit the early run before everyone in the city heads out  i also noticed the salmons caught 2-3 weeks ago fought way harder that the ones recently...i think its due to the oxygen level from all the low waters we're getting.
384946,fishinguypat,2009-09-19 21:11:00,547,i have never seen anyone ever catch a fish off the actual piers at goderich..i have seen them be caught off the rocks though
384958,timmeh,2009-09-19 21:32:00,609,Do people actually eat those brown boots or do most people just let them go? Nice fish either way.
385006,Leecher,2009-09-20 00:15:00,7832,Nice.... some good looking salmons in those pics    Congrats bassfighter Leechman
385190,bassfighter,2009-09-20 16:39:00,366,"A Response to Timmeh's question ""Do people actually eat those brown boots or do most people just let them go? ""  Out of the 11 I landed, we took one home and split it among few families, the fish actually taste fine , nothing beats fresh fish, the color is somewhat pinkish when raw and turns more white when cook. The meat is not as delicious as Steeleheads, but still taste fine with butter salt and lemon or add some Terriaki Sauce. Many Anglers actually take them home, and won't release the female ones. I release two female, because I have enough eggs to last me for few years, and I use artificial lures most of the time even during winter months catching trouts.  I was hoping to catch a jack or any fish under 15lber and so far no luck, the fish are too big to even fit my fridge. I normally ask a friend to clean the fish for me and just give me a small slice, I don't have to clean fish this way. I also normally lose my appetite when I have to clean the fish, and then cook it.  The fish seemed to taste better when someone else cleans and cook it.  Response to FearThe Mullet: You have not miss the run. You must be willing to put time and will eventually be lucky to hit the major run. Few of us are willing to lose sleep this time of the year just to enjoy fighting with these Salmon. We all got skunk many times just to make sure we don't miss a run. Based on my years of fishing Salmon experience, the weather should be cold when the Salmon actually start heading to the river system. The weather is not yet too cold as of now, especially the water temparature seemed to be warmer this year, the major run has not started.  I remembered last year, by October, when the run seemed over and the crowd died out. By the last week of October 2008, it had a mini snowfall during that day, I took a chance to check out an area that evening, there were 2 other anglers that showed up, my instinct was right, Fresh Salmon came in, I landed 6 within 1.5 hours using crank bait. 2 days later, it was packed with anglers again, and no spot to fight with the crowd as always."
385193,timmeh,2009-09-20 16:55:00,609,Thanks for the response bassfighter. I don't spend much time at all fishing for salmon in the rivers so I wasn't sure whether or not people kept most of their fish.

385529,bassfighter,2009-09-21 17:52:00,366,"SEPT 20-21 Sunday to 3:30am monday report  Last night fishing was wierd, So few anglers and many fish jumping everywhere, but very few fish were caught or hitting. Few anglers on site means others were getting skunk days before. We tried everything using my roe bait combo and then spoon and then back to roe. Only until 3:00am, when I stored all of my equipment ready to packed it up, change to glow spoon, suddenly I had two hits casted from 2 different spot within a minute of each other. Probably the fish just turned on. I landed my only female fish for the evening, it was release. We fish from 9pm to 3:30am.  My other buddy also caught his fish 10 minutes after I landed mine, due to his lack of confidence, excitement, fought way too hard trying to let the fish turn closer to shore with his 20 lb braided line, the line broke, losing his $4 spoon. I have been using 10lb mono all along with the proper drag set, and works just fine. I caught enough fish in my life not to get too panicky or excited, and let the stretch mono line do its job of absorbing the shock. I just have to re-tie everytime I landed a fish.  Picture of the same fish from last night.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing035.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing033.jpg"
385917,ciceri,2009-09-22 18:12:00,535,"Nice fish man.. Me and a couple buddies went out lastnight to try for some too, didn't land any though, had few on, one destroyed my lure. Saw one guy get one up stream and it came running down infront of us, and jumped like 6 times 4 feet in the air, it was great."
