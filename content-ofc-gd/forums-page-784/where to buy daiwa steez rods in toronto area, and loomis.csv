Does anybody know of a tackle shop in or around the toronto area that sells or would order these daiwa rods..???  Bass pro does not, JB's does not, le baron used to but not anymore, al flahertys no, tremblays no..........So anybody who knows and could tell me, I would appreciate it  I am also interested in knowing a store which carries a good selection of Loomis rods as well (except bass pro and le baron)  thank you have a good day!"
