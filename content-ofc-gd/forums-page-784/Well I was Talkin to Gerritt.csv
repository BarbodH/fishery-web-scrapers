384956,bushart,2009-09-19 21:30:00,2628,This past summer I met member Gerritt and in discussion I had mentioned that the 1st place my Dad took me fishin was Calendonia back in the 60's  I recalled a mill there and he indicated that it was still there.  When I took on a new project I thought--why not---it was definetely a big part of my life.  So on Misfish' advice--I checked the expiry on my artistic licence and set forth  I have'nt seen the mill or river in many years so an exact likeness on my memory would have been not really close---so I went with the feeling of the day.  Man life was alot simpler then.  My Father passed away in 72 but I took what he taught me and spent that same quality time with my kids.  Short of a few highlites this is pretty much done  Bushart
