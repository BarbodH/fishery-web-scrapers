Saturday evening, after a beautiful sunset, bonfire and all the kiddos went to bed I decided to throw some topwater off the dock.   There's a small island just out of casting range with a nice big rocky shoal off the point...I'm thinking Musky!  I know there in this lake but so far all I have been able to get are buckets, smallies, perch, pumpkins and a few rocks. It's about 10:30pm, no moon, tons of stars and very dark.  I put on my favorite wake bate and start casting.  I get about 4 bites in the first 10 casts but just can't seem to set the hook  Then wammo, I hear the blowup...wait...set the hook and YES!  I start reeling, pulling, reeling, pulling, tighten the drag as this thing is getting farther away instead of closer.  My heart is justa pounding and all I can think is I FINALLY got my musky and...I can't wait to show Cudz. lol       I yell to my father-in-law (still sitting around the fire) to get his camera cuz I got a big one!  Then it hits me...I didn't put a leader on (I guess I didn't really expect to get the musky)   .   I keep fighting it for about 15 seconds but then...I lose it    .  I reel in my line expecting to have lost one of my favorite lures, but nope it's still there!  My father-in-law arrives with the camera only to find me pissed, but still shaking from excitement but with no Musky. I keep fishing for an hour or so hoping there's another big one out there but knowing there ain't no way the same one's gonna bite again.  I end up catching a few nice buckets and one smallie (sorry, no pics as everything was disappointing at that point).  I call it a night at about 11:30 to try and get some sleep and give it another shot in the morning.  I get up at 5:30, on the water at 6:00 but don't go too far off shore as the fog is crazy thick and I got no GPS in the 14' tin.  I decide to cast the same point only from the water this time.  Second cast I get another nice smallie and I'm thinking it's going to be a good few hours....NOT. The fog lets up around 7:45 so I decide to go across to another island for some bucket action on the scum frog.  Somebody takes a picture of me. 8:30 rolls around and that smallie at 6:05 was still the only bite of the morning.  I decide to head in and get back to taping the drywall...yeah!!  We decide to quit working around 5pm so I can fish with the kids off the dock for a while before heading home.  They definitely had better luck than me!    Well, at the end of this weekend all I could think about was ""the one that got away"".   I'm heading up near Perry Sound this coming weekend for a fishing trip with some buddies!  Won't get any Muskys but maybe, just maybe a 40"" Pike...oh ya and my first nickle!"

LOL Ya, I read your post about 10 minutes after posting this and had a good laugh.  At least I still got my lure!  Hopefully, I know one of the neighbours caught a 45""er in that same spot in the middle of August...maybe the same one..."
