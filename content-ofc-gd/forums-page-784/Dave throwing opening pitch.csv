385748,GBW,2009-09-22 02:50:00,8460,youtube?
385750,Joey,2009-09-22 02:52:00,9122,"I tried youtube, not there"
385751,rbaquial,2009-09-22 02:53:00,968,I tried YOUTUBE too!  Maybe Dave's gonna post it on his website?
385753,HTHM,2009-09-22 02:55:00,4082,I'm gonna stay up and watch the news. Which station would be best??
385754,GBW,2009-09-22 02:55:00,8460,I tried too.  Let's hope!  maybe TSN or Rogers?
385757,rbaquial,2009-09-22 03:19:00,968,"  I would guess either ""THE SCORE"" (Chan. 53 in Toronto)... or TSN (Chan. 30 in Toronto) . Maybe even CP24 during their SPORTS broadcast? I really hope Dave posts it somewhere!"

385897,Governator,2009-09-22 17:06:00,879,I tuned in a couple of minutes before the broadcast began and they didn't show it!  From the video online on the facts of fishing site he did an awesome job though.  He gunned that in there.
