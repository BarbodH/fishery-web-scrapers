385918,JohnF,2009-09-22 18:19:00,3494,"Looked to me like he mighta thrown (cast) a strike first pitch. Rare enuf for these ceremonial pitch tossers. But then he got on the catcher about booting it and asked for the ball to cast again, and it looked like another strike. Waytago, Mercer!.  I think the vast majority of folks who get to throw the first pitch are just relieved to get it over with, usually cuz they went in expecting the worst, and got it.  JF"
