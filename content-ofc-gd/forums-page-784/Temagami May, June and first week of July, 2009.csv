386117,irishfield,2009-09-23 02:46:00,26272,"Leah happy to be back in her sunny spot.. May 19th 2009. Just what she needs to keep her lungs working.    Water a tad high..  free firewood toooooo !    This years project.. the bathroom..      Anyone still think a paper dust mask would protect your from SARS ??    Completed.. new floor, dual flush toilet and new sink (paint, lights, etc)    Does this mean I can drink in my boat now??    Leah with wood..    Changing props to try and scrape up some more short back lake performance.      More food for the Lynx ! New baby bunny hiding in the lylock bush.    One of the better fishermen on the lake. Lands on our dock daily.    June started off great ! First visitor of the season.... Moosebunk... how can you beat that!?? Well find him some fish in the first 10 minutes!        I even got to reel one in !    Unfortunately Bunk was just blasting thru town and couldn't stay for more than 4 hours! Our daughter and her friend showed up the day Bunk was there and met briefly. Next day we took the girls to Sandy Inlet for a beach explore under the shadow of a huge electrical storm.        Then the common pigs amongst us appear... not even a good choice of beers!    and some of natures beauty in the same spot.    A shot for the gals of me on Father's day.    Sorry didn't mean to make you lose your supper!  Ours was great though!    Next day Leah let me go play on my own. First real test of the canoe loader/unloader and man does it work slick. Siderock lake for stocked Brookies... nobody home but what a great day out!      June 25th we scrambled to go to Lakair as a last minute decission and decided to just take the 12' tinny and load it in the back of the truck. Leah praying we don't sink!    Took the stove I'd rigged for the pursuit tracks. Worked great. I'd removed the legs so had no choice but to use the mounts.    Joey and Pauls beauty new ProV with Bassmastermike uglying up the picture!    Lucky to spend two outings out with Lew in his new boat hunting Musky. Caught and pulled the baits away from a lot of pike... but no Muskie unfortunately.    Leah fishing off the dock for pike during the Saturday Pike tourney.    Measure in time!    We left Lakair on Sunday to get things ready for John and Barbara's arrival Monday for their all inclusive vacation (that I'd put up for auction on the Fishing for Tyler Auction last year).    Wasn't long finding them some Lakers to play with.    Barbara with her first Laker. Two months later and my thumb is still an open sore from lipping that little bugger!      John and Barbara left on Canada Day and a few days later Moosebunk was on his way back North and was able to stay overnight for a more relaxed pace.          The next day my Mother and Step-Father arrived and a couple days later we got out on the lake, July 8th, and got Mother her very first (and unfortunately last) Laker.        Three hours after all these smiles I had to tell her that her daughter was dead.  Unfortunately we had to pack up at the lake and head for home to deal with the sudden death of my sister, and her estate, that put the first 23 day dent into the summer and our hearts.  Arrived home to find that our property is overrun with Fishers!    Will try to get late July, August and September up tomorrow."

386136,Twocoda,2009-09-23 03:30:00,4130,"ohhhhhhh, my hearts with ya man ....  on the lighter side if at all possible ....i was thinking it was because all you guys caught was lakers...?  truly my deepest condolences again ...and may i never have to say that to you again ..."
386200,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-09-23 13:24:00,53,Thanks for sharing those great shots and moments Wayne. I'll be sure to give you the 2 honk salute from Hwy 11 when I pass by your place early on Oct 9'th on my way to Lady Evelyn for the first time. Spending the holiday weekend there with my bud from Liskeard. Jack.
386218,Headhunter,2009-09-23 14:14:00,5703,"Nice Wayne! Can't help but notice that many of the fish pictured seem to be rather slim (something I'm not personally familiar with!LOL). Perhaps as you travel Temagami, you could drop some sandwiches or something, so those poor skinny fish can put on a few pounds! Lookin forward to the next post! HH"
386220,johnnyb,2009-09-23 14:20:00,3413,"A great report...bittersweet...hopefully the toughest summer you'll ever have to go through.  Way to capture all the positives though -- bathroom looks great, you got some fishing in, and the boat/plane setup is amazing!  Too bad we missed you on Siderock...our fishing results were identical to yours Keep smilin!"
386230,tonyb,2009-09-23 14:32:00,1637,"Thanks for sharing Wayne, some difficult times for you and your family this year.  You did well surrounding yourself with the beauty of the outdoors and some great folks too, and that must have made things a little easier."
386232,Joey,2009-09-23 14:44:00,9122,Super report and pics so far Wayne.  Looking forward to the next installment.  What an unfortunate set of circumstances for you this year tho.  You're a strong man to come through it like you did.  *hug*  Joey
386235,highdrifter,2009-09-23 14:57:00,2534, LMBO!!  All those lakers in one report make you look like a pro dude!  We need a bittersweet symphony to go with that.  That was great bud.  cheers HD
386236,John,2009-09-23 15:07:00,2956,  Looks like your addiction is not getting any better bud!
386241,Terry,2009-09-23 15:30:00,14456,"great report Wayne  so the different prop on the plane, will let you take off on smaller lakes, or will help lift Lloyds fat butt off the ground"
386243,Leecher,2009-09-23 15:56:00,7832,Excellent report and pics Wayne WOW never a dull moment in your little piece of paradise  eh Thanks for sharing Leechman
386245,JohnF,2009-09-23 16:04:00,3494, Ya forgot the head. That's critical to protracted onboard imbibery.  Oops! Shoulda looked closer. I didn't see it hidden under those saddlebags.  JF

386260,Roy,2009-09-23 16:40:00,13728,Good on ya for making the best of a not so good summer. I'm glad you had a good time.
386265,Ron,2009-09-23 16:52:00,1683,"Well Wayne,  You definitely got some great memories from the Summer and certainly some not so great memories as well. It's hard to do a juggling act on your Summer but I do hope the good memories far out weigh the bad.  Chin up bud.  Cheers, Ron..."
386296,solopaddler,2009-09-23 18:25:00,8605, Now that made me laugh.  Great post. Nice to see you around again Wayne...
