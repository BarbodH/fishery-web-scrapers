Feel free to PM me if you prefer."

There's no Pulitzer waiting for him, and the grammar is a little rough, but the information and tips are incredible.  It's actually broken down into 6 parts.   The best part of it is his screen captures of actual fish finders, and his explanation of what he's seeing.  He even blew up ballons to ""bass size"", and anchored them underwater 5 or 10 feet down, then drove over them in his boat and took pictures of what his Lowrance screen was showing, then explained how it works, and how to adjust sensitivity etc. to get the best display.  Really, really good stuff, I've found."

When I first had my unit(500c)I thought all I had was a #$^*@#$%$$$ depth finder.After some time spent with it and few chats with Jos I now see arches,bait balls and bottom structure like never before."
