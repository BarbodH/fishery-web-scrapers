All in all a great few hours with 8 trout caught. Great fun seeing the fish attack our bait on the fishfinder as we were anchored up in 60' or so of water, and on light spinning rods with nothing but a 1/4 jig and medium minnow the trout give a good acount of themselves.   Fish were through the whole water column as were the schools of baitfish, some of the baitfish clouds were huge. At one point i even wtched a trout dissipate the cloud on the graph as it swam into it...pretty cool to watch on a fishfinder.    DAVE'S FIRST LAKER       "
