385870,TJQ,2009-09-22 15:26:00,7806,"The vine that ate the south is here! Dreaded invasive kudzu vine has been found in Ontario  It has been taking over fields, roadside signs, fences, trees, and even houses in the United States for years, but now, the kudzu vine (Pueraria montana) has been discovered in Ontario, on the shores of Lake Erie near the town of Leamington. The kudzu vine is a native of Eastern Asia, and was first brought to North America in 1876 for a centennial exhibition. It was later used for erosion control and promoted as a forage crop. Eventually, it took over much of the southern states and despite attempts to stop it, has continued to spread northward.  ""We have been watching the kudzu vine move toward Canada for some time now, with great apprehension. Our colleagues in the south have been fighting a tough battle with this invader, so we need to take immediate action in Ontario to stop kudzu in its tracks,"" says Rachel Gagnon, Coordinator of the O.I.P.C. (Ontario Invasive Plant Council), a collective of organizations collaborating to address the spread of alien invasive plants in Ontario. ""Fortunately, it's been found early, so unlike previous invaders, such as dog strangling vine, we have the potential to eradicate kudzu and protect Ontario's biodiversity. Controlling this menace is critical to maintaining our native plants and wildlife habitat. If we let kudzu become established, it will cause untold ecological and economic damage.""  Like all other invasive species, when the vine takes to its new environment it spreads quickly at the expense of native species, including trees, which are girdled by the vine; broken by its weight; or killed by lack of light. The kudzu grows at an astounding rate of 30 centimeters (one foot) per day, and in a single season can grow up 30 meters (90 feet) in length.  Control measures include hand cutting, mowing, controlled burns and herbicide. Grazing animals, such as goats and pigs have also been effective at containing the spread of the vine over the long term.  The O.I.P.C. is a non-profit, multi-agency organization that facilitates a coordinated response to the threat of invasive plants. The council provides leadership, expertise and a forum to educate, motivate and empower organizations and citizens.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, Ontario's largest nonprofit, fish and wildlife conservation organization, houses the O.I.P.C. and supports its efforts.

385873,LucG,2009-09-22 15:35:00,779, What's a centennial exhibition?
385885,ketchenany,2009-09-22 16:21:00,3229,"  It's a Worlds Fair, just like our Expo 67 in Montreal. I would gather that the 1876 Exhibition was to commemorate the 100 th American Birthday."
385888,LucG,2009-09-22 16:28:00,779,"Yeah, I never did that well in history class...lol"
385896,dave524,2009-09-22 17:03:00,4508,"Thanks for the heads up on that, I've been aware of its reputation for a long time.  Living by the Niagara Escarpment here in Grimsby we have two other invasives that are making life difficult for our native wildflowers. They have been occurring with increasing frequency the last few years and I would urge anyone who has them on their property to eradicate them.  Japanese Knotweed  http://ontariowildflowers.com/mondaygarden...icle.php?id=110  Garlic Mustard  http://ontariowildflowers.com/mondaygarden/article.php?id=54  On a upbeat note, Purple Loosestrife, while still present, I don't see the massive fields of purple that were common a decade ago. I believe they imported a weevil from Europe that feeds on it, seems to be keeping it in check."
385905,Greencoachdog,2009-09-22 17:35:00,8163,"It's just a little present I sent up there to y'all!  As a Kudzu battler from way back, I can tell you that there are only 2 ways to kill Kudzu!!!  1. Dig it up!  2. Keep it mowed short, no more than 3"" tall... this takes about 3 or 4 years to actually kill the tuber.  Herbacides will not kill the tuber, the leaves on the vine will turn yellow, fall off, and new ones will grow!  We have Kudzu festivals down here in the South, with Kudzu eating contests, fried Kudzu, and even Kudzu wine!  http://www.kudzufest.net/  The oldtimers call it foot-a-night here and claim if you sleep with your bedroom windows open it will creep in and steal you away, never to be seen again!  The birds will eat the seeds and drop them elsewhere, but is spreads the most by just spouting roots whereever the vine touches the ground.  Y'all have fun trying to kill it now... ya heah?!!!"
385921,JohnF,2009-09-22 18:25:00,3494, I wonder when we'll declare that weevil an invasive species and commence weevil eradication.
385933,TJQ,2009-09-22 19:05:00,7806,I knew it was all GCD's fault.. I just knew it.
385937,JohnF,2009-09-22 19:12:00,3494, He also brought the Yellow Horde (Possums) to Ontario. He figgered we'd like some house pets too.  JF
385962,Gordy Mohr,2009-09-22 20:14:00,21,Ive see this Kudzu down in Tennessee. It takes over and nothing else will survive where its  established.  Another invader becoming more prevelant in Ont is the the Giant Hogweed. It was imported as an ornamental shrub and has now started to sprout where it hasnt been planted. This plant can be toxic to certain people causing severe dermatitis.
385966,HTHM,2009-09-22 20:40:00,4082,"Could someone post a pic of this plant? Re: Killing the tuber, would a steriod based herbicide for work? I.E. Roundup?"
385974,steelhead hunter,2009-09-22 20:55:00,152,ya that's all we need a plant on roids
385978,dave524,2009-09-22 20:58:00,4508,I think Killex and Roundup are on the prohibited weapons list in Ontario
385988,Greencoachdog,2009-09-22 21:41:00,8163," Not entirely true it cohabitates very well with the Korean Boxwood, the Kudzu thrives in the summer and then when the frost kills it back the Boxwood thrives in the winter... together they make a nearly impenetrable barrier!!!    Click on the link Dude!  http://www.kudzufest.net/  Look at the timelapse flash pic in the top left corner... it shows going from winter to summer."
386003,Gordy Mohr,2009-09-22 22:53:00,21,"You may very well be correct GCD, I was down there during summer and the Kudzu was thick! I didnt see any other plants where it flourished. I have no idea what that boxwood looks like, but I know Kudzu when I see it. And down there I seen alot of it!  Gordy"
386284,lhousesoccer,2009-09-23 17:39:00,442,"   The next pic, that's a house under that bump in the centre of the pic.      "
386292,JohnF,2009-09-23 17:56:00,3494,Think Virginia Creeper on steroids.  JF
386304,LucG,2009-09-23 18:44:00,779,How long does this stuff take to overtake a house?
386330,aplumma,2009-09-23 20:41:00,6896,Actually the goats love the stuff and can keep it in check. Round up also works but you need round up pro concentrate and mix it to 6 oz per gallon will also kill the roots.   Art
386331,LeXXington,2009-09-23 20:42:00,1928, The owners in the south were sitting outside on the couch and it darn near just snuck up on them..
