386040,Raf,2009-09-23 00:40:00,3495,beckman and frabill make quality nets that are easy on the fish.  they will likely be the last net you buy.  find one that fits your budget and the size of fish you plan on catching.
386070,pike slayer,2009-09-23 01:19:00,1177,"i bought that frabil net with the red shaft at crappy tire. it was a bit pricey at $59.99 plus tax but omg sooo worth the money! it extends out past 5feet i believe and compacts back up nicely, the net has that spray rubber netting for getting hooks out easier and i netted a 40"" pike with it on the weekend with no problems."
386075,Radnine,2009-09-23 01:25:00,1538,I use one that extends as well but has the full rubber mesh. It is great or getting hooks out of and I have not had a fish complain yet! Also purchased from Canadian Tire. Jim
386114,Garry2Rs,2009-09-23 02:39:00,1425,"My good friend Musky Striker uses a Beckman Pen Fin Saver Fishing Net. It's the best net I have ever seen. Here's what they say about it on-line...  With a Fin Saver there's less mesh-snarling of teeth, fins, and gill plates. Today's trophy angler requires a rugged right-sized net for landing large fish — as well as a fish-friendly net bag for the most lively releases!

386349,Dabluz,2009-09-23 21:52:00,701,I don't like those heavy rubber landing nets.  They are ok if you built like Arnold Shwartzenegger or have a buddy you can trust to use the net.  I prefer those rubberized fine meshed nets that I can operate with one arm.  I like the nets that are rather deep yet have a flat bottom.  The fish don't panic so much in them because those real deep cone shaped nets.....the fish gets almost folded in two and they don't seem to like that very much.
386350,Bernie,2009-09-23 21:55:00,3190,I had a decent rubber net until it was left on my boat top (I won't mention any names  .) I found out at high speed it will blow off and into the lake. .....It didn't float Next one I get if it doesn't float will be filled with foam in the handle.
