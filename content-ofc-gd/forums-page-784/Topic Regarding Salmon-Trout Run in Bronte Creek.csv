366012,rbaquial,2009-07-25 05:25:00,968,"Hey Folks,  As time gets closer and closer - its making me wish I could do some river fishin'! (and not just dinky lil' guys)  Anyway, my question is to those who has tried fishing Bronte Creek (in Burlington) for Trout/Salmon... Just wondering if the fish are known to run up there?  Thanks! RoB  PS: I'd like to know of your fav. places (PM me)."
366013,yo_guy,2009-07-25 05:58:00,111,"Fish do run up there and sorry I can't and will not tell you my favourite places... You can work the river anywhere from the mouth of bronte all the way up Petro Canada Park.  If you like to walk keep going north till you're tired you can find a few spots with some small pools.  Generally speaking this creek is really shallow.  Time the rain and should find fish anywhere. It's all site fishing!  Keep in mind of the regs as well for closing dates of particular stretches.  Honestly, you are better off at the credit with more flow."
366060,tonyb,2009-07-25 13:49:00,1637, Not quite 100% accurate yo_guy as these signs are posted between Hwy2 and Rebecca St...    Petro and N is ok though
366068,Spiel,2009-07-25 14:01:00,9065," Actually that has been changed. I believe there is still no trespassing but boat access is permitted.

366074,CLofchik,2009-07-25 14:20:00,854,"Learn to fish the gun metal freight trains off the piers at night instead of the dark mud sharks up little creeks.  North winds, cold water, glow spoons.............   Oh and Solo, opportunities, plural.  Credit has an even better estuary to fish, with it too small & shallow to really run boats up it pretty much stays untapped.  Oh crap, where's the edit button!!!!!............."
366076,Spiel,2009-07-25 14:26:00,9065,  Shhhhhhhhhhh...............where's the delete button?
366078,solopaddler,2009-07-25 14:33:00,8605, Where do you think I fished most of last spring?
366258,yo_guy,2009-07-26 01:32:00,111,It's been a while since I fished this creek... at any rate that's why I stated

366297,timmeh,2009-07-26 04:12:00,609," I bet you would, but I doubt anyone's willing to give them away. It's one thing to ask for help but to not even be polite about asking for such info seems kinda rude..."
366358,rbaquial,2009-07-26 14:06:00,968,"  My apologies... you're absolutely right. What I meant to say was ""if you care to share your fav. spots, i would greatly appreciate it - fire me a PM""...Sorry 'bout that folks!"
366394,Raf,2009-07-26 15:41:00,3495,"believe it or not, people caught fish before the internet  they typically put in some leg work; had their share of successes and failures but eventually, found their own little holes  try it sometime."
386059,BLUE-EYES,2009-09-23 01:09:00,5,So does that mean i can fish in the sanctuary if im in waiters in the water???

386067,Ziki,2009-09-23 01:17:00,128, :lol:  Are you implying those cookie cutters you posted last spring were from the Credit??   :lol:
386097,timmeh,2009-09-23 02:02:00,609," NO, absolutely not. You cannot fish in a sanctuary at all."
386153,BLUE-EYES,2009-09-23 07:44:00,5, Well according to what i quoted... you can fish in the sanctuary from certian dates and from a boat!!!  please someone correct me if i am wrong!!

386177,packrat,2009-09-23 12:13:00,93,If you fish Petro Park be prepared for the most disgusting display of sportmanship you've ever seen.  The stench when the run is on will have you looking for something to cut the smell a bit.
386180,Marko,2009-09-23 12:23:00,854,"Was there yesterday, its very very shallow. Still no stench tho and not too many dead fish laying around which probably tells you that there was no major run just quite yet."
