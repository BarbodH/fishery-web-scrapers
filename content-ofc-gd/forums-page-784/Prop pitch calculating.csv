385959,Fishn Technishn,2009-09-22 20:10:00,198,Got a buddy who has a Stainless steel prop that will fit my motor. Apparently there are NO markings on it that tell what the pitch is!! Only thing visible is  698099-1 Anyone know the best way to measure the pitch accurately?  I know there must be some simple method but I can't think of it HELP!  FT
385971,Roy,2009-09-22 20:44:00,13728,"Props are measured  using two numbers   for example 13 3/4 x 21. The first number is the prop's outside diameter... 13.75"". The second number is the pitch. All pitch is is the distance travelled forward in one complete revolution. While  this way of measurement is not accurate to the closest ml.... it`s very easy to place the prop on a flat surface and turn it the same way it would turn on your motor in the water. The distance it will have travelled in inches will be the pitch.  There are tons of sites that will help you with that."

386045,Fisherman,2009-09-23 00:48:00,7201,"Something like what Roy said, set the prop on the leading edge of the hub, measure from the leading edge of the prop blade, (not the hub) to the trailing edge of the same blade vertically, don't follow the edge of the blade at an angle.  Take that measurement and multiply x 3,( for a three blade), it should be pretty close to the correct answer."
