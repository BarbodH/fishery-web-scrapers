385131,Chris,2009-09-20 12:29:00,405,  OK despite the smartass tone of your responses you guys do have a point with the number of trucks out there. But what about the resale value? Let's hear how you explain that. There's no comparison in resale value. That definately speaks volumes about the trucks.
385146,Billy Bob,2009-09-20 13:18:00,5865, I maybe wrong on this but Chrysler was going to make the Titan's but that was before they went broke.......not sure if Nissan is still producing them now or not.......  Now you GM owners..........what's with the doors that can't close unless the windows open or you SLAM it.....come I know there are a ton you guys out there.....(25 years later with the same old problems with GM)
385153,Tybo,2009-09-20 14:08:00,1373,"MY 93 gm I had to slam the door. My 03 gm, Push it closed with one finger and a coffee in hand. And theres not one air leak. Boss's 09 gm, Which he traded his Toy for.You don't have to slam the door. Friends O8 gm. which he traded his Toy for. Same thing.  The reason you see so many used trucks for sale. Has nothing to do with the truck. It is the economical down turn. People can.t afford the gas and payment.  Put it this way. How many times have you seen a truck with a hard tonnuo cover and no hitch. What do you think that truck is used for. Car with a very large trunk.  Trucks are not forgiving if used as a truck. If you don't have a proper maintenance schedule."
385174,Lunatic,2009-09-20 15:06:00,536,"lol, thats me. the passenger door i can close with one finger but the drivers door needs a bit more. the door pins need replaced is all. when the door sags its harder to close because its not lining up with the stricker. because i get lazy i just moved the striker more forward,so it dont need slamed so hard. this is untill i feel like changing the pins"
385281,danbouck,2009-09-20 22:13:00,4380," I would have given you $10,000"

385423,kemper,2009-09-21 12:02:00,2232,"Recently bought my first car...1994 (really used) Acura (fancy word for honda) integra. 285 000 kms, rust in all the right places and it runs like the day it rolled off the lot. Doesnt leak a drop of anything, doesnt cough sputter or otherwise, the thing barely even burns any oil (about the only issue Ive ever heard with Honda)  This car has sold me on Honda...find me a 1994 sunfire that has no leaks, good exhaust, passes E test and safety...wait you would have to find that that even starts first!  Parents both drive GMS, their first ones in years and both swear to never drive another. Dads 2005 Cadillac CTS 3.6 (~$60K) TWO wheelbearings at under 90km, $700 each, FULLY seized up steering rack at under 100km, leaks everything, hogs gas and other than the fact that it is stupid fast and fun to drive its basically been useless since day 1.  Mom bought a 2001 Aztec and has been driving it since it had about 50k on it... upper and lower rad hoses, rad itself, A/C, blower motor, exhaust, also TWO wheel bearings, etc etc etc.  Ill drive my 94 Honda for a while, seems like better bang for my buck."
385444,pikehunter,2009-09-21 13:48:00,1659,"So? That is typical of any car/truck. Give it a break. I too put a new rad in my wife's/son' Honda, and a grand into the front end last year then 400 bucks last week for a catalytic converter and pipe. Things wear out. Your dad's Caddy though, why so much maintenance and was it covered under factory warranty?"
385452,kemper,2009-09-21 14:04:00,2232,"  I guess I should have added that all those things went on the aztec in the first year...its been fairly good since.  as for the caddy, only the steering rack was covered. Mechanic said he had never seen anything like it before.  OH and the kicker is that it was leaking rad fluid when he bought it! nice.  That there is quality. They did fix that too."
385453,BillM,2009-09-21 14:05:00,17367,"I love my truck ('03 S10 ZR2) but nothing defines reliable more then my Jetta TDI.  519,000km's and it's my daily driver  Hopefully I'll hit at least 800,000kms before I have to retire it."

385884,skrillaguerilla,2009-09-22 16:21:00,30,"Sweet truck!, yes i consider it a truck, it has a boxed frame, solid rear axle, a 2 speed transfer case, and sometimes they come with electronic rear lockers - some features you won't see on a few of the 'domestic' brands! If i was in the market for a new SUV i would be going with an xterra for sure! You're gonna love that 4l motor too. Come on over to my Canadian Nissan Truck Club website. There is lots to learn there and i guarantee you will get the off road itch after you see what other owners have done and can do with their xterras. Members also get discounts on service and other perks from a couple of the participating dealerships in the GTA and Milton.  Canadian Nissan Truck Club  my username is nige on that forum.  I've been enjoying my old Pathfinder for close to 8 years now. Outside of bigger motor, manual gearbox and solid front axle, there is absolutely nothing else i want changed on it. It hauls my 14' aluminum no problem and has just enough space to carry a week's worth of camping and fishing gear and tools for two people and a dog (probably more if i use the boat for holding coolers, beer, tents, guitars etc.). I've taken it to Florida, Timmins twice, countless trips into the Muskoka, North Bay area, and stinktown (t.o.), and almost every ski hill, lake and river within a 4 hour drive of here. I've modified it a little bit and i take it down all the trails in the Minden/Kawarthas area where it has seen it's fair share of off road abuse (including a hydrolocked engine!). The 4 wheeling is a bit rough on them and i have spent my fair share of time disassembling and cleaning parts. I've been planning a cross-country trip out to BC with it to visit all my friends and family in Calgary, Christina Lake, Kelowna, Vancouver and Victoria, and i know it will make the trip without any fuss.  As for domestics, I would like to see how many 1995 vintage trucks like Blazers and Exploders are still on the road with everything still working on them. It's very rare to see anything other than beat up old Jeeps and Toyotas that are that old and still running trails. Jeez, we even have some 80's Nissans that run the trails with us every so often.  Anyway, enough babbling. Hope to see you over there on the club message board       photo by my friend Slawek"
384731,tizfun,2009-09-19 00:28:00,292,"Well after many many sleepless night trying to figure what I should do, I pulled the trigger and put my 2003 Chevy Trailblazer to bed..  That truck has been a nightmare for me since day one..  With over $8,000.00 in repairs since new, I vowed that GM has seen the last of me..  It was in need of repair again...  Exhaust manifold, brakes, tires, 4X4 not working, no muffler and the list goes on.. Took it into my friends garage for an estimate on the repairs and he figured about $3,000.00 + ... NO THANKS !!!!   It had 311,000 kms and some of my friends bet me it wouldn't make it to 300k..  You loose !!!  I just traded it in for a 2006 Nissan Xterra with the Off Road package and the Rockford Fosgate sound system... The ride is really nice and tight  and the 4.0 ltr really hauls ass..  Pick up my newer truck on Tuesday.... can't wait...    "
384737,GeorgeJ,2009-09-19 00:45:00,207,"let me understand you spent $8000 in repairs to travel 311,000 kms? thats 188,000 miles, I'm not a big fan of GM products but I don't think that's unreasonable. Good luck with the Nissan but being an auto tech for 32 years I know Nissan's are expensive to repair."
384744,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 00:55:00,8163,"In case you didn't know... when you buy used, you're just buying someone elses problems!    .. sorry to be a downer... but it's the truth!!!"

384828,tizfun,2009-09-19 05:20:00,292,"GeorgeJ... these repairs were after I spent $3000.00 for the extended warranty to 160k kms...  You may have seen or worked on many cars but Imports from my past experiences cost less because they have not as many problems as our Domestic junk...  I've driven our GM for a long time and owned 2 Nissans....  And for myself..... there is no comparison......  GCD...  you may have a point, here are my cars/trucks bought new.. 1996 GMC Jimmy.... Junk.... 4 years and traded.. 1997 Pontiac GTP ....Junk.... traded after 2 years   ( Wife hated this car because of all the problems ) 2000 Isuzu Rodeo....Junk... compete engine rebuild  @ 71k kms 2003 Chevy Trailblazer LTZ  ....  don't even get me going....   paid $47,000 new and worth $2600.00 now  So you tell me if buy used is so bad, why were these car/trucks bought brand new and all with major problems...  Have owned used before (imports) as we currently do....   Henry......  the truck never did have a hitch installed.... it's ordered though...   These are my past experiences and some may have had great ones, but I will not spend one more dollar into GM..... wish they had disappeared and it's to bad , we had the chance.... and that's from the bottom of my heart....  Too much hard earned money spent on poorly made vehicles...   Just my thoughts. Tiz"

IF i spent 10k on the truck i've spent maybe 2k on the bmw in repairs. Ill never buy a chev again, never, the list of crap that went wrong with that truck is just mind blowing, 4th set of brakes(built with brakes that are too cmall for the trucks goes thru brakes like crazy),cat convertersx2,both power window motors, driver side twice,complete rear end under warranty,transmission left me at 108000k warranty ended at 80k 2800 for rebuild, u-joints,front end rebuilt twice,front wheel bearings 300 plus for the part alone,and i can keep going and going lets no forget piston slap on start up truck can sound like a diesel sometimes, since new, check pistonslap.com...anyway  see ya later gm ill never give them a penny again."
384836,pikehunter,2009-09-19 11:16:00,1659,"Congrats on your new vehicle.  Don't knock the domestics, you get a lemon so you make lemonade. You can get a lemon in any make, foreign or N. American. Don't you see all those import dealers all have  packed service bays? They have them for a reason. My sister in law just got rid of her Benz and bought a new not used Escape, the Benz was costing too much for repairs.  My 1997 Ford Aerostar, knock on wood, has been the best car I have had, bought it new and it now has over 300, 000 K's on it. Have I spent much on it so far? NO! And it's an Aerostar! That's not exactly a cream puff!  And the repairs your old truck needed were mainly routine service items, all brakes, tires and exhaust wear out, it's normal. And don't carp about the 4x4 repair, aren't they known for problems?  Enjoy the new ride all the same, it looks nice in the pictures."
384845,Chris,2009-09-19 12:08:00,405,I'm with Tizfun and Buster on this one. None of my money will ever go to GM again.....except for when the gov't steals it from us to give to them.
384850,danbouck,2009-09-19 12:38:00,4380,"NIce Ride!  IMO every manufacturer makes lemons. A good friend had a new 97 Blazer, never a problem, greatest vehicle he ever had. Sold it for a new Nissan Sentra SE R, went through 2 engines (1 not under warranty), had many other smaller issues. He got sick of fixing it and bought a new Toyota Tacoma. It has been in the garage every 2 months for problems.  Crap on GM all you want but people are crapping on Nissan, BMW... every other manufacturer at the same time for the same reasons."
384855,keiths,2009-09-19 13:09:00,30,Maybe you have bad luck with new ones. Or maybe you just don't look after them? They all need repairs and up-keep. But the new one looks good. Hope you have better luck with it.

With all that was going on with GM when I was ready to buy, I figured why not try an import for a change and so far, so good. Doesn't that truck come with the 3.5 VQ motor?

In all seriousness, my 78 Mustang caught on Fire, so all companies have their issues, lol  I did drive a Geo Prizim, which i think was GM for a couple of years and it was great.  However, my last truck was a 94 Ranger that had about 200,000 MILES on it when I scrapped it because it needed a new engine (my fault, first vehicle that I was responsible for the service, I missed some, so my bad)  and box and my current truck is an 04 F150 that I bought with 9k Miles on it and I've had almost 0 problems with it, knock on wood.  While I like the Xterra a lot and don't classify it as a truck, I really don't understand why people buy foreign trucks.  Buying foreign cars I can understand.  Gas mileage, dependability, INFLATED public reputation.  Buying foreign trucks makes no sense to me when the Ford, Dodge and even GM trucks have been solid for years.  I'll never buy a foreign truck.  (I think the Xterra is actually built in Tennessee)"
384935,jediangler,2009-09-19 20:44:00,1923,"Hey Wask, that Geo was built in the California plant that Toyota and GM share. Before the Geo they made Chevy Novas that were the same as Toyota corollas. Now they build the Pontiac vibe that's a clone of the Toyota matrix. The most reliable cars to be sold under GM nameplates in the last 25 years came from that plant. They are closing this plant. I don't think GM is moving in the right direction."

385030,Chris,2009-09-20 00:46:00,405," Check out the ""Truck Trader"" and see how many domestics (GM, Ford, Dodge) are for sale compared to the imports (Toyota, Nissan). Probably about 10:1 ratio that says something about owner satisfaction. Also check out the resale value of the domestics as opposed to the imports. The imports definately hold their value. The domestics do not. That says alot also.  There are stories of lemons and of great vehicles on both sides of the fence. But I think the lemons are rare with the imports just as the great vehicles are rare with the domestics. Either way, I'll never buy GM junk again....ever!"
385040,Puckhead,2009-09-20 01:08:00,377,"^^Bingo!  Not all domestic built cars are junk... plenty of good one's out there but the reputation isn't down to good marketing or import novelty.
