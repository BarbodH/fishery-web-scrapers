386071,Cudz,2009-09-23 01:21:00,2652,octopus 2/0 and 3/0 for wacky rig. 5/0 wide gap worm hook texas style. I usually go with owner hooks but with the octopus I will also used mustads.
386077,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-23 01:30:00,3761,Gamagatsu 4/0 Wide Gap Hook for the texas rig.
386087,EC1,2009-09-23 01:49:00,930,"Texas rigged would be my choice since the majority of time for me to use a senko would be inside of the weeds. Gamakatsu...Owner..Wide gap for texas.Don't use sub-par hooks or you will face disappointment especially if you hook into nice sized fish.  For wacky rigging, I saw these green hooks made by owner that looked pretty interesting! They had a weed guard on each side of the hook."
386104,Garry2Rs,2009-09-23 02:16:00,1425,"I think those ""good"" hooks for Senkos are a waste of money.  For Texas I use Wal-Mart 3/0 EWG hooks that cost about .30 cents each instead of $1.25 a piece.  Wacky worms fish nicely on red Mustad 1/0 or 2/0 weedless hooks.  They are also a wide gap type of bend and can be found at Wal-Mart and CTC. for about .60 cents each.  I have caught lots of 5 and 6 pound Bass on these hooks and have never lost anything because of hook failure."

386247,JohnF,2009-09-23 16:07:00,3494," I wuz gonna say Gammy Finesse 1/0, and not weedless. Excellent with wacky worms or crays.  JF"
386269,uglyfish,2009-09-23 17:10:00,981,"for wacky rig, i use a size 1 or 1/O eagle claw circle hook. for texas rig i use a 4/O or 5/O wide gap"
386367,singingdog,2009-09-23 23:20:00,1047,"Keep in mind that when Trigging, the bigger hook you use, the less wiggle you will get on the fall. Most of the time I use an Owner 1/0 Wide gap. It's short, but with a really wide gap that still gets good hookups. I will only go to a 3/0 or bigger if I feel the fish are not taking the whole bait into their mouth."
