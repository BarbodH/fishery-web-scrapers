509856,Skud,2010-10-07 01:06:00,739,"As some have noticed from my last pic I posted, Moultrie cameras take a pretty crisp picture. Ten times better than my Bushnell. There are still some blurry pics when the animal is moving quickly but most are great. Here is another one of the same doe. My camera is on the same tree but turned to a different direction.  I don't think I have seen a deer with such dark ears and such a dark stripe down the chest.  "
509890,irishfield,2010-10-07 02:21:00,26272,"Thanks Skud! Nice shot. Where is said trailcam model available and at what cost. I want something for the lake, I know our ""kitty cat"" (Lynx) is still around but we never did see it this summer."
509918,Skud,2010-10-07 03:09:00,739,I bought it at canadian tire last week when it was $50 off so it was only $150

510056,Leecher,2010-10-07 17:27:00,7832,Awesome details on that pic Skud Hope you have a doe tag this year     Cause that's a nice one Leechman
510072,misfish,2010-10-07 18:12:00,29133,"I know you dont want to see does Doug,but real nice shot. I get to put mine out tomorrow,along with the 12 or so""no tresspassing"" signs."
510527,irishfield,2010-10-09 00:42:00,26272,Is it the I-35-IR model??
510541,Skud,2010-10-09 01:30:00,739,Yes
510542,irishfield,2010-10-09 01:33:00,26272,Thanks!
510561,walleyejack,2010-10-09 03:58:00,358,where can you find one ? Ctc doesn t have that one listed anywhere
510581,Terry,2010-10-09 12:08:00,14456,is this the one  http://www.cabelas.c...ction=&ID=23415
510584,TJQ,2010-10-09 12:32:00,7806,"Great pic bud, ive got two older moultries, not particularly ""Happy"" with them, the newer models must be better!!! How many batteries does that one take?? I just put my two out yesterday, they take 6 d cells each, $$ ouch!!"
510587,Terry,2010-10-09 12:39:00,14456,Requires six C batteries (sold separately).
510592,Skud,2010-10-09 13:02:00,739,"As Terry said, 6 C batteries.  My Bushnell took 4 D batteries.  When you go to the CT site the camera is not listed as the I-35, but just as a 5Mp camera in camo. Just go by the pic Terry linked to."
