509849,Beans,2010-10-07 00:04:00,3339,"I may call her ""Lumpy""...   She jumped up on my lap to look out the window while I was in my big Lazy-Boy chair and damn near wrecked me for life...  "
509858,Jewelbee,2010-10-07 01:14:00,422,"Awesome of you take her! Won't hurt her to be off her food for a while..LOL! Start her exercise slowly, you don't want her to get sore and it will help her to gain the urge to eat again"
510032,Leecher,2010-10-07 16:45:00,7832,"Looks like you have yourself a great fishing partner Norm Like others said, a little exercise will do her good Leechman"
510035,Spiel,2010-10-07 16:55:00,9065," Good on you for taking her in Norm but the above quote has me laughing, twice.  The fact that you said she ""jumped"" and of course the ""near wrecked me"" comment which assuming she actually did/could jump up the lap landing would have been near fatal.   "
510197,Beans,2010-10-07 23:13:00,3339, I s'pose crawled up would have been more accurate but her weight and the placement of the feets left a lot to be desired
510205,misfish,2010-10-07 23:35:00,29133," As they say Norm. No pain, no gain,,,,,oh wait,,,,,,,,,  Get walking my friend,with mans best friend."
510569,hammercarp,2010-10-09 07:33:00,964,Ha! another bread box beagle. That's very good of you to take her in.  Watch out they are escape artists. There's lots of cottontail and snowshoe up your way. Just let her run while your waiting on a carp. She'll be in shape in no time.
510828,Beans,2010-10-10 16:21:00,3339,"Further:  It has been five days now and she is settling in nicely... Not too happy not getting any table scraps as we don't believe dogs should eat ""people food""...The wife walks her around our complex (= 1 mile) at least once a day and I walk her around our property early for her morning constitutional (pee and poop)...  I'd like to walk her further but I have poor circulation in my legs from diabetes...One of the reasons I like shore fishing for carp...once I'm set-up I can park my a$ on my chair and wait for some action...  I hope to get her out in ""The Tin of Beans"" soon to see how she re-acts and behaves..."
509740,Beans,2010-10-06 17:15:00,3339,Maribeth went to visit her ailing sister yesterday and phoned me to ask if I'd like a big fat bagel...  Gotta get my ears checked as this is what she brought me...     A Big Fat BEAGLE...  She has an a$$ on her like a tame bee...    Just kidding...I knew Chiquita was coming as Maribeth's sister is too unwell from chemo therapy to take care of her and was thinking of taking her to the Humane Society...  She is five years old and has always been in an apartment and since Jim died of cancer a while ago she has not been getting much excersise...  She whined quite a bit last night as she has never been in a car or anywhere other than home so she is off her food but drinks water ok and has done both her businesses outside earlier...  She has gone to get her nails done with Maribeth...(I hope they don't paint them pink or I'm not walking her off the property...  )     
509743,Carp,2010-10-06 17:18:00,1488,I think I better get my eyes checked. Can't see what you're trying to show us Beans.
509744,ld17,2010-10-06 17:23:00,319,He probably ate it!
509747,Spiel,2010-10-06 17:28:00,9065,I'm thinking Beagle......
509748,ld17,2010-10-06 17:31:00,319, LMAO
509750,Beans,2010-10-06 17:34:00,3339,Sorry guys...I couldn't post pics on a new post for some strange reason so I posted some text and edited in the pics etc...     
509752,oldphart,2010-10-06 17:35:00,665,"~~~Know how big you are, Start walking bud you both need it"
509755,Carp,2010-10-06 17:40:00,1488,"Hey Beans, I hope your eyesight is better than your hearing and you didn't try to take a bite."
509758,Joey,2010-10-06 17:44:00,9122,Well I can see the pics and I feel sorry for the old fat gal.  No way you two can keep her?  Would be a shame to go to the Humane Society.  She must be pretty old eh?  Joey
509761,blaque,2010-10-06 17:48:00,2419,I think hes sayin that she was going to go to the humane society until he decided to take her in?
509762,TC1OZ,2010-10-06 17:49:00,987,awesome story!
509763,Beans,2010-10-06 17:50:00,3339, She is ours now Joey and I hear a cat might be next...   Ki's (our cat's) nose is really going to be out of joint then...she is not too happy with the dog but they will sort it out...
509767,toca,2010-10-06 18:06:00,274,"She Aint Fat She's Just Big Boned.....  Glad To Hear She Didnt Go Back To The H.S  Got My Dog(Beagal) at the H.S when it was 8months old.... with three different owners before I got him.  Eight Years And Going The Bugger Still Wont Settle Down.  Cheers,  Todd"
509768,bigugli,2010-10-06 18:10:00,6138,"She'll be a loyal, loving, lifelong companion. A walk every day and fish 3 days a week and she'll be living a ripe old age."
509771,capt bruce,2010-10-06 18:22:00,820,"Bet she has a nice personality lol , might be a case of the pot (belly) calling the beagle black lol. Im sure she will be great addition and you will both enjoy the walking ."
509772,splashhopper,2010-10-06 18:25:00,2931,that is one faaat beagle....  holy COW !
509773,fishnsled,2010-10-06 18:33:00,3520,Good on ya Beans!  Your dog reminded my client of her bagel ( I mean beagle) 	Maybe you could both be in on of those Fido commercials based on what oldphart is saying.   (Joking)  Enjoy your new best friend.
509778,Joey,2010-10-06 18:54:00,9122," Looks like you are right Blaque, whew  You're a good man Norm!!!  Joey"
509788,misfish,2010-10-06 19:26:00,29133,"Just think Norm.After a couple of months jogging with Chiquita around the block,you,ll both be getting as fit as a fiddle."
509789,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-06 19:37:00,2582,Finally my friend. After listening to you chat about it all summer I was starting to think she was never gonna give up the dog. I'm sure it was a tough decision for her.  Next spring when I'm up in Caygeon again maybe you can bring her over to Carp Point to sit and fish with us. I'm sure a Beagle could be trained to make an OUTSTANDING bite alarm
509793,brw,2010-10-06 20:13:00,101," She's not fat--just a full figured gal with more to love!! Love beagles...so kind and lovable, even though they're not the brightest bulbs in the packet.....she'll give back way more than what you put into her!"
509796,motv8tr,2010-10-06 20:41:00,2587,you guys are dreaming if you think Beans is gonna walk her...lol...my mom is the dog walker in that house   chaquita will be slim and trim in no time  Enjoy your new foot/lap warmer Beans  Maureen
509798,mercman,2010-10-06 20:46:00,7054,SHE IS GORGEOUS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fat bottom girls make the rocky world go round...... I hear they make great fishin buddys too.
509805,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-06 21:00:00,0,"My buddy had a beagle just like that one. We called him stumpy. Looked like a stump, with legs.."
509817,mercman,2010-10-06 22:19:00,7054,  they aren't fat......they are fluffy
