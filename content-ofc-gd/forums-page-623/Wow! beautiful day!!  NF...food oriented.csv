So, I did a little smokin'..& a guy dropped off a big load of scrap lumber from a local mill. All red oak & hard maple boards, some destined to be smoker fuel!  I tossed on a couple turkey breasts, one for dinner, one for sandwiches this week...   I also smoked my nuts!!!      for chestnut stuffing...   did mashed taters & gravy for the wife( she hates stuffing..)& smoked a butternut squash.  breast after resting..   inside...    piled lumber...shot of the porch on rodshop,,,note the ""Muskie"" ..a board came off the saw at the sawmill...a guy grabbed it ,& had it painted...    just a great October day...."

But your pictures now have me wishing I'd been tending the BBQ while I was out there, it was after all only a few feet away."
