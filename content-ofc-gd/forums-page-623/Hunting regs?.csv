510646,misfish,2010-10-09 20:13:00,29133,"I have looked through the regulations about having a shotgun and bow at the sametime .  Can anyone clear this for me?  Come next week it will be turkey time(would sooner knock the head off the bird, then shot through the body with an arrow,dont want to waste good meat), it will only be bow for deer.To me, Im covering both senerios."
510663,mercman,2010-10-09 21:49:00,7054," if i remember correctly, as long as you have no slugs on your person, and only bird shot, you shouldnt have a problem.i would leave the slugs and anything else not required for bow hunting deer, at home so MNR officers have no doubt what the guns is for."
510679,steelee,2010-10-09 23:00:00,13,"Ive questioned this before a long time ago my reason was for bow hunt deer, and shotgun for coyote if they were out of bow range. you can have both with you as long as one is encased, if you get firm confirmation would love to hear it, since my info never came from the mnr so i may even be wrong."
510708,cranks bait,2010-10-10 00:45:00,721, This is my understanding as well.  Otherwise you have two firearms out at the same time.
510715,misfish,2010-10-10 00:56:00,29133,"  A crossbow is not a fire arm.......YET.  I,ll give a call to Rick."
510718,NAW,2010-10-10 01:43:00,4022,Just get a few turkey broad heads.  The ones the open up wide.  I know guys that cut heads off turkeys from 60 yards with those things!
510719,irishfield,2010-10-10 01:45:00,26272, Not to the gun Registry and PAL... but it is to a CO during hunting season!
510723,Skud,2010-10-10 01:55:00,739,I think as long as the shotgun shells are only #2 shot or smaller you should be ok.
510724,misfish,2010-10-10 01:56:00,29133,"  Good luck with that in court Wayne.A CO with half a brain, would know that."
510763,chilli,2010-10-10 04:08:00,199,No but it is a tool used to hunt both turkey and deer. If you find out that your allowed to hunt turkey during deer shotgun season make sure you still wear the hunter orange.
510891,ch312,2010-10-10 21:59:00,1590, how so?
510919,bassjnkie,2010-10-10 23:28:00,1101,Don't see why not. just don't have slugs or buck shot on you. Orange would be a must.
511040,chessy,2010-10-11 15:32:00,610,the only way to tell is call the enforcement supervisor in the area you will be hunting and ask him.... each area interprates the laws differnentyl ...
511041,SBCregal,2010-10-11 15:42:00,688," from pg 21 in the hunting regs.   Firearms Firearms include rifles, shotguns, air or pellet guns, bows and crossbows. You may use semi-automatic or repeating firearms for hunting in Ontario, but not handguns or fully automatic firearms. Air and pellet pistols with a muzzle velocity less than 152 metres (500 feet) per second may be used for hunting in Ontario (see restrictions on page 22)."
