511143,Marko,2010-10-12 00:54:00,854,"Hey guys how is everyone doing? Hopefully you all had great Thanksgiving and got to spend some time with loved ones. Not much of a bass fisherman really, I tend to start chasing them in rivers here when carp bite dies down. I`ve had some luck this year, got some nice ones. All fish were caught bottom bouncing worms in some fairly strong current and Blue fox size 1 and 2 spinners. I`ll let the pictures do all the talking, i am too tired after having spend 7 hrs on 401 driving from Ottawa today.               Love the color pattern on this guy, just a beautiful fish all around.                  This guy had half of a crayfish sticking out when i caught him, hard to see from this shot...crappy cell cameras.  Couple of real pigs now. Its hard to take decent shots when you are standing in water waist deep and in some pretty fast current. My hand is size 10 and some of these pictures are not doing these fish any justice.        Only large mouth of the year.   Again love the color pattern on this one as well     A fishing trip would not be a fishing trip without catching one of these guys....he just nailed my spinner   fish sitting next to a 7 ft rod     This was the last thing that how many minnows and crayfish saw???!!   Decent fish next to a size 12 flip flop    Last but not the least my fishing but Trevor with a couple of his own.        Hope you guys enjoy the pics!"

511164,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-12 01:59:00,0,Very nice. Looks like the fish were biting well for you. Thanks for sharing.
511165,Marko,2010-10-12 02:02:00,854," Yes all were caught in a river, 4-6ft of water and a very rocky bottom."

511178,Victor,2010-10-12 02:35:00,1609,Lots of nice bass there Marko. I haven't been fishing all that much myself this year so i haven't ventured out your way yet. But i'm sure we'll find time to fish together again some day.
