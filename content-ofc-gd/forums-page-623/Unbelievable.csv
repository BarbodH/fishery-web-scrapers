510525,scuro2,2010-10-09 00:19:00,904,"International Association of Fire Fighters General President Harold Schaitberger today issued the following statement on the September 29 fire in Obion County, Tennessee:  “The decision by the South Fulton Fire Department to allow a family’s home to burn to the ground was incredibly irresponsible. This tragic loss of property was completely avoidable. Because of South Fulton’s pay-to-play policy, fire fighters were ordered to stand and watch a family lose its home. Everyone deserves fire protection because providing public safety is among a municipality’s highest priorities. Instead, South Fulton wants to charge citizens outside the city for fire protection. We condemn South Fulton’s ill-advised, unsafe policy. Professional, career fire fighters shouldn’t be forced to check a list before running out the door to see which homeowners have paid up. They get in their trucks and go.”   Read more: http://www.kansascity.com/2010/10/05/2279115/fire-fighters-condemn-south-fultons.html#ixzz11ofai4nf  I guess some people see fire fighters as an essential service whose duty is to protect people and property against fire. Fire fighting is not a business like dry cleaning. If you can't pay for your suit the house doesn't burn down. If you can't pay for your shirt three pups belonging to your grandchildren don't die. This fire fighting is a ""business"" is total  thinking of the first order."
510531,scuro2,2010-10-09 00:56:00,904,"Fire-fighting personnel across East Tennessee seem almost universally outraged by the actions of a small-town fire company on the other end of the state that responded to a house afire but was ordered to let the structure burn because the owner had not paid a $75 subscription fee. ""We don't particularly care who's paid his dues,"" said Steve Wheeler, chief of the Vonore, Tenn., Fire Department. ""If somebody needs help, we help and worry about everything else later. Truly, a firefighter cannot stand by and watch something burn,"" said Doug McClanahan, chief of the Blount County Fire Department. ""He can't stand by and not try to react to a fire or rescue. They are trained to take care of people.""  Not all fire-fighting agencies in East Tennessee sell subscriptions for their services, but some that do are adamant that they would never let a structure burn depending on whether the fee had been paid or not. Among such agencies is Rural/Metro, which handles fire-fighting duties for Knox County under the direction of Chief Jerry Harnish. The chief said the South Fulton case is a ""major topic of discussion"" among those in his profession, and he finds it ""kind of hard to relate to. People don't join fire departments to not respond to emergencies."" Wheeler's five paid and 15 volunteer firefighters, he said, are driven by the same sense of wanting to help people that causes most to get involved in such potentially dangerous work. ""It's in your blood,"" he said. ""You love it. It's about helping people."" Wheeler said he does not know how the South Fulton team even knew Cranick was not a subscriber. ""We don't ask,"" he said, adding that he believes the firefighters who responded were probably anxious to attack the flames despite their orders. He said his unit would not ""let policies and stuff get in the way"".  Blount County residents who fail to subscribe to fire services for $110 will be presented with a hefty bill after firefighters finish their duties at a house fire. McClanahan said it amounts to $2,200 for the initial call and $1,100 for every hour past the first two that firefighters are on the scene. Wheeler said his department has no set fee but does ask the homeowner to assign to the fire department any insurance money designated for compensating the fire department. If no subscription is paid, he said, the standard rate is $1,200 per hour for each unit dispatched to the scene. ""And we never send a single engine to a fire,"" he said. ""We send four engines and a ladder truck,"" meaning the homeowner is charged the hourly fee for each truck. Knowing that, he said, most people realize it is ""more reasonable"" to pay the subscription fee.  http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/oct/08/fire-chiefs-we-wont-watch-a-home-burn/"
510552,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-09 03:07:00,0, LOL. Whatever my beef is with the American system shouldn't be taken personally by you. I've been raised in a different environment and have some differences of opinion. I am very opinionated and can ruffle feathers but mean no offense to anyone.  Yes PEACE is the objective.
510555,John Bacon,2010-10-09 03:27:00,3277," That depends on whether you are charging them the $75 after the fact or the actual cost of putting out the fire.  I am not sure what the actual cost of responding to the fire is but I believe that someone did mention $3,000.  If people knew they would be hit with a $3,000 bill or may more after the fact, then I think they may be inclined to pay the $75 annual fee.  I still think they should add $75 to the property taxes and just do their best to put out all fires."
510556,Grimace,2010-10-09 03:29:00,2020,My sentiments exactly.
510559,scuro2,2010-10-09 03:40:00,904,
510560,fish-miester,2010-10-09 03:48:00,864,saw this.. was pretty shocked
510596,Billy Bob,2010-10-09 13:24:00,5865, I concur as I am the same way.....hell I even let you buy the cold Canadian beer while we argue non-sense we have no control over....  Bob
510608,I'mHooked,2010-10-09 14:59:00,525," Sounds familiar.   Couldn't have said it better myself...well maybe close!  I netted a couple 4-5 lb Steelies this morning for a guy. Didn't catch any myself.    ...other than some 10"" smolts."
510614,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-09 16:29:00,0," I would assume that the people from the city were paying a heck of a lot less then $75(seems a bit steep to me). I think the guys in rural areas were getting dinged more because they were probably paying as individuals and weren't getting the group rate.  The cost they said was $2,000 + just for responding, and $1,000+ for each truck they dispatch for each hour and they usually dispatch about 4, so you do the math. $6,000-$9000 is a bit steep for  a trailer. Maybe if it was a large building I could understand....  The guy offered to pay the fire department what ever it takes to save the house and his pets. I know how some owners feel about their pets and it is difficult to put a price on that, since they can't be easily replaced(he lost 3 cats and a dog). I think even a $1,000 bill to put out a trailer fire is MORE than sufficient for an hours work.  I know many people that gamble and cut corners to make ends meet. Fire protection is not something you gamble with and should be provided by the government to ALL. Take it out of the tax dollars or whatever."
510657,Billy Bob,2010-10-09 21:23:00,5865," In a working house fire you are way off on how long a fire truck would spend from ""out"" to ""in"" service time...that means from the time the truck left the fire hall until it's back in service in the hall ready for another fire call.  Even a routine garage fire would take 2-3 hours for out to in service time.....a big working house fire where you might knock it down and save, let's say half the structure, you could be there 4 hours or more easily......don't forget, even after the fire is out their is a lot of hose and equipment to be put away. Then the rest of the structure has to be check with the thermal imaging camera to make sure there are no hidden hot spots between the existing walls that could restart the fire once we leave. And don't forget, it has to be investigated for possible arson. In order to do so at least one truck with one line (hose) will remain in the house so the fire department hasn't relinquishment control of the building back over to the owner. This is a legal move because once the fire department leaves the scene it will take a court order to return and investigate if arson is  suspected. You don't want a bunch of arsonist running around your neighborhood do you ?  Yep, just keep beating up on the volunteers and someday (and it's coming) nobody will want to volunteer anymore. We are at about 55% strength because of all the time it takes to VOLUNTEER....    Bob"
510672,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-09 22:26:00,0, Now I get it!!! That explains the $6000-$9000 dollar price tag for putting out a trailer or garage fire!  All that shouldn't cost more than a $1000 bucks for a trailer.  Who is beating up on the volunteers?  Even the firefighters association president said that was the wrong thing to do.  And over 80% of Americans polled (with the 20% probably coming from the south) agree. Your in the minority Bob.  They were there in time and they just watched it burn when they could have put it out in less than 15 minutes give or take. Its a trailer!
510728,Billy Bob,2010-10-10 02:03:00,5865," Boy Johnny, you know a LOT about EVERYTHING......how long it takes to put out a trailer fire that you were NOT at... Do you have any firefighting experience ? ? ?  You know the percentage of Americans who agree that the fire should of been put out.......tell me, WHO did the polling, YOU....  You know how fast they arrived and how bad the fire was without even being there....  And the most important fact....you know the ratifications of the volunteer fire department involved when it comes to fighting fires when they are NOT legally contracted to do so in case someone was injured or worse while doing so.....YOU are one smart man when it comes to fighting fires. Have you ever thought about becoming a fire chief ? ? ? It usually only takes about 15-20 years of experience as a firefighter and assistance chief but with all your firefighting knowledge you might be ready now...."
510736,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-10 02:13:00,0," Yes, I consider myself an intelligent person. Oh and I guess you have more knowledge than the President of the firefighters association! Maybe you should apply for the job!  I go by what the news said and they arrived in time to at least ATTEMPT to try to salvage something. Why don't you enlighten us and tell us how long it would take a firefighter with firetruck to stop a trailer from burning! And what expenses that would involve!  Did you know one of the kids assaulted the fire chief for refusing to put out the fire? You think he did that because the house was already burnt down? Its clear I know more of the incident than you do and I and everyone in the know has stated that the firefighters were incredibly irresponsible.  As far as who made the poll? Here it is and try reading some of the more intelligent comments.  http://msnbc.polls.newsvine.com/_question/2010/10/05/5232681-should-firefighters-have-put-out-the-blaze-at-gene-cranicks-home-even-though-he-hadnt-paid-the-fire-fee  Tell me? If your neighbor didn't pay his fire protection and you were a trained firefighter and in a position to extinguish it and he had all his belongings, his 3 cats and his dog inside. Would you put out the fire and do you think it should be put out?  Bottom line? They shouldn't have watched the trailer/home burn down and fire protection should be provided by the state for all its citizens. Not pay and play."
510798,scuro2,2010-10-10 14:26:00,904, Best just to say the firemen did as they were ordered and the wife said exactly that. She did not blame the firemen. There is no shame here for the firemen.
510830,bigfish1965,2010-10-10 16:43:00,3382,"One of the biggest reasons this is a shock to Canadians is the difference in culture. We expect some universal standards more than our neighbours do. We expect that some things will be taken care of and then we can worry about money after that. Fire, police, paramedics and hospitals are primary as well as education. To Canadians we know that no matter where we travel in Canada, those things are always there. I remember when the local fire department here said they wanted to charge out of town people a fee for response. It was quickly struck down when someone told them that everyone from that town could then expect to pay in other municipalities should they need help. So it is a wash.  It is a different mindset here. It is something we will never grasp. The idea that only those who can afford fire and police protection will receive it is shocking to us, but is the way some places are. I could not have stood by myself and watched the house burn with pets in it. I hope the people had insurance and I hope the insurance company takes the town to task over it.  Rather than have 100 people pay $75 a year for advance protection (which absolutely smells of a racket to Canadians) they would be better off charging $500 for each response afterwards. More flies with honey..."
510888,Billy Bob,2010-10-10 21:46:00,5865," OK, let's do the math....100 x $75 is only $7,500.00 per year...with this amount you will not get much for your dollars.....I am not saying that firefighters should stand by but SOMEONE has to foot the bill BEFORE the fire starts....the cost are enormous when it comes to supplying the firefighters with the proper equipment and training not to mention the amount it takes to MAINTAIN the equipment....OSHA has MANY different demands that we as a fire department must maintain...just recently we have to furnish BAILOUT equipment to all interior firefighters at a cost of $30,000.00 for our small department. Each truck cost $250,000 or MORE....turn out gear, helmets, new boots, radios, batteries, thermal image camera's, ropes, ladders, hazmat response equipment, ladders, fuel, tires,  ropes, life of jaws, first aid equipment, safety cones...the list goes on and on....not to mention even if this equipment has NEVER been used it expires because of the date on it....and this is all mandated by the federal or state government.....we haven't even covered the cost of the buildings or insurance or utilities....Scott Packs, refills.....for those that have been involved in fire departments, then they realize what I am referring to.  This is the last time I will post here and here is WHY the fire department was not able to respond........they were not under contract to protect that building.....if they HAD and someone got hurt or worse the CHIEF would had been in BIG TROUBLE as he violated his agreement with the city/town/village he worked under....would YOU risk everything you owned including the well being of your family AGAINST orders ?!?!?!?"
510911,HTHM,2010-10-10 23:12:00,4082,"AS original poster, I would suggest that this debate be closed, both Rick and Billy Bob have expressed the differing views quite eloquently and there is no further need for discussion. This was a great debate that illustrated the differences between us northerners, and our neighbours to the south."
510930,Woodsman,2010-10-11 00:11:00,1286,"Let's just except that the debate boils down to different political views on how public(?) services should be provided. We in Canada generally expect that most services should be provided though our taxes where in the US it is more common to expect to pay for services through insurance or voluntary fees.( fire coverage, health care ect.) Saying that I'm sure there are some if not many on both sides of the border who believe that the other countries model is best."
510151,Billy Bob,2010-10-07 21:02:00,5865," NOPE, I still think you're swinging and missing the point just like the Cincinnati Reds last night...by your thinking then it's fine and dandy that no one pays for fire protection until they call for help....that can't work and you know it.....again, how about if I only purchase a Ontario fishing license AFTER I'm caught not having one. And of course with no fine whatsoever. Maybe no one should get car insurance until after the accident....."
510156,OhioFisherman,2010-10-07 21:09:00,6623,"most likely rural we would agree? if a structure fire has progressed enough to threaten/ignite adjacent properties its toast. especially with 3 ff's working off a 30 year old firetruck.( in a town whose 2500 residents, lets say own 500 homes, each contributing 75$ = 37500 not enough to cover one ffs wage for the year by the way not to mention half million dollar appparauts). almost ALL rural properties will be destroyed by fire in a rural situation, even in wealthy areas with serious volunteer or composite firefighters. 400 in taxes wont get you fire protection even with a 75 levy.  Not sure exactly how much our volunteer  firemen make, but it isn`t much more than minimum wage, and they only get it for training and when they are fighting a fire. They don`t hang around the station and get paid.  There are some decent size small cities in the area here that still use a volunteer fire department. Instead of paying to have a full time fire crew it allows the mayor to make 100k a year or more. Them civil servants aren`t to civil when they run the town.  If the people won`t pass  tax increase for fire and police protection? It has to be passed to be included in the property taxes.  My property taxes are half of what Medina Ohio`s are 10 miles away, but we don`t pay to support a mayor, city council, law director, chief cook and bottle washer and family and friends jobs of all. 3 trustee`s making 15-20 k a year part-time handle everything."
510190,mbosh1980,2010-10-07 22:44:00,349,"""most likely rural we would agree? "" Agreed. And by the time they were able to respond the place was probably a complete defensive attack anyway. Best just to protect exposures."
510199,HTHM,2010-10-07 23:14:00,4082,"As the original poster, what I was commenting on was the fact that one has to pay an additional amount over and above one's taxes in order to get the services of one's local fire department."
510212,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-07 23:45:00,0," All I have to say is WOW!  Certain things should be covered by your property taxes. And two big ones being police and firefighters. Firefighters are a very important part of a community. They do more then fight fires.When lives are at stake, there should be no risks. Same as wearing a seatbelt or lifejacket.  Oh, today I seen someone drowning. I know CPR but I decided not to try to save them because I might get sued."
510225,mbosh1980,2010-10-08 00:19:00,349,When was it said lives were at stake?
510230,mercman,2010-10-08 00:31:00,7054,"  hummm, i read and re read the post, but dont see a comment at all.you put the topic in and like all controversial posts, we ran with it HTHM."

It's about responsibility to finance a fire department....my point is if everyone only wants to pay after they have a fire how can a fire department even be formed, yet maintained.  I have been a volunteer firefighter for over 35 years and I believe I have some knowledge on the cost of running a fire department. If everyone was like the folks that had this fire there would be no trucks to send to the fire in the first place. Stop being a    and think before you type."
510317,lew,2010-10-08 12:27:00,12766," Paul, my brother was a volunteer fireman    and if I recall correctly they were payed $3000 per year and recieved it in one lump sum payment once every year. He left the job about 17 years ago so I don't know what type of salary they recieve now.  I have a friend who's a volunteer in this area but I have no idea what their payed but I'll ask him next time I see him."
510321,bigugli,2010-10-08 12:48:00,6138,"Out our way, it was $10 an hour for duty calls only, a few years back. Had a few VFF friends who retired out now."

Let's assume that you really don't know what I'm thinking, and you're just reading the words I've typed. I know, I know, it's so easy to jump to conclusions and warp things to your advantage, however I don't THINK I made any reference to it being 'fine & dandy' that no one pays the protection fee.  Boy, I can only imagine who's crew they'd rather see pull up to their house fire...Mr. ""gotta get paid 1st"" BillyBob   , or Mr. ""I'm Hooked"" on saving the place.  I would think a small town service who is cash strapped might actually look forward to the opportunity to be ""hired for service"" and paid actual cost coverage. But hey, what do I know about small town finances & mindset, I just do what I can for the 160,000 people who rely on us to act.  Getting car insurance after an accident? Now you're just being silly. But wait, if you're stupid enough to not have car insurance...will the fire dept still not come to your collision? You see, in our neck of the woods the fire dept responds as needed, to even those out of town motorists who haven't directly contributed to the city bank account ahead of time.  Anywho, for those interested, here's a link to the news site with a video clip of the incident:  http://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/local/Firefighters-watch-as-home-burns-to-the-ground-104052668.html  ...and a Happy Thanksgiving weekend to everyone! Gotta go find some Trout with my name on it!"
510353,The Urban Fisherman,2010-10-08 14:54:00,2050," I was looking into it out my way as I'd like to help and figured it'd be a good way to get involved with the community.  They make $20 an hour here while fighting fires and get paid for training as well.  But the guys agree'd to pool the 2 or 3 grand a year that everybody is ""supposed"" to get and keep tabs of who show's up to clean and maintain the trucks and property of the station, and who comes to fundraisers and kids events and such and the more you show up to do that stuff the more money you get from the pool at the end of the year.  I'm hoping to get involved if I can!  Cheers, Ryan"
510359,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-08 15:17:00,957,Does anyone else think Gene Cranick should have observed the burn ban that was in force and not have started the fire that destroyed his shed and mobile home?  Or at least tend to the illegal fire instead of leaving the scene and going inside for a shower while the blaze was ripping and roaring beside the shed?
510361,Chance,2010-10-08 15:22:00,420,"I suppose the answer would be to take away the non payment option and add this to their taxes.Funding must come from somewhere and a ""pay per incident ""way of thinking does not even come close to the amount needed.If there were no funding then there would be no argument over who they would rather see pull up to their house fire as NOBODY would be pulling up!"

Mine eye sight is 20/15 how's yours.  I live a in small town and have belonged to the fire department for over 35 years....I'm not just pulling Bull out of the thin air...  Our department gets it equipment and trucks from the town (taxes) but the companies themselves have to do fund raisers to finance their companies.  We go thru HUNDREDS of hours of training and drilling EACH YEAR to be qualified to be a firefighter, truck driver/operator, fire police, etc.... Not to mention meetings and fundraisers.

510402,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-08 18:07:00,0, No because then everyone wouldn't pay until their house got burned down.

510031,Chance,2010-10-07 16:45:00,420,"Far too many unknowns involved to start judging the firefighters.How far along was the fire,was there anything to save?What threat to life for the firefighters was involved?Hazardous materials,propane etc???Were they fully equiped at that time to fight that fire?Easy for many to sit back and judge without being in their shoes.I am sure each and every one of them would of reacted differently if life were involved.  I can tell you that if you disobey a lawful order from your superior and do the complete opposite you better have a VERY good reason.If you get injured or injure or kill someone else in the process then forget your reasoning its too late."
510034,mercman,2010-10-07 16:55:00,7054," absolutely right. fire fighters are like soldiers. they work as a tight team, taking orders from superiors who have the experience and the knowledge to direct his men. I,m sure any of us would have tried to help, but when it comes to risking your comrades lives, we would think twice and look for direction from someone able to make the decisions."
510039,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-07 16:59:00,0," No one is judging the fire fighters. Just the fire department and politicians. To believe that people can just stand by and watch a person's house burn down without helping makes my stomach turn. For $70 they made a house burn down!  Then for someone that cant pay the premium, they are pretty much screwed! It should be included in the property tax. GOD KNOWS we pay enough of it!And the more people that are covered the less people will have to pay.  Capitalism at its worst. Profits before people."
510041,Billy Bob,2010-10-07 17:01:00,5865, Oh no....not your commie Bull again.

Look at prostitution, soon to be taxed when they can figure out how to do it........."
510050,Chance,2010-10-07 17:19:00,420," Hmmm...I would say that statement is fairly judgemental AND directed towards the firefighters in attendance.They MADE their house burn down, c'mon now.  How do you know they could not pay,perhaps they defiantly decided not to pay,you dont know.Once again you cannot judge a situation without all the facts."
510051,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-07 17:21:00,0," That's what it is! A money grab! Canadians should recognize it right away since it is common practice in Canada!!

The facts are the house was burning down, the firefighters were in a position to stop it and they didn't because the home owner didn't pay the money grab."
510055,Chance,2010-10-07 17:24:00,420,  Good point
510058,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 17:34:00,987," I usually like your posts Johnny... But its not a money grab... everything in this monetary system has a cost associated with it. And we all know money has real world value right?    HAHAHAHAHAHA  So you can't argue logic in a monetary system, because its not a part of the system.   And compassion... that's just plain absurd."
510060,Tybo,2010-10-07 17:40:00,1373,If you can't pay a $75 fire fighters fee.  IT'S TIME TO BUT DOWN THE BEER!!!
510063,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 17:43:00,987, LOOOOOOOL  I'm sure there were a few in the fridge that got fried....  Any story can be told from any perspective...  I bet if it were a grow house burning down that didn't pay their fee's people wouldn't be as heart felt for the family...
510080,I'mHooked,2010-10-07 18:34:00,525," I didn't miss any point.   Yes they were billed the $75 ahead of time, and if they paid it they MAYBE wouldn't have lost everything. My point was about still fighting the fire and THEN billing them the total cost of doing so AFTERWARDS. Just like if they didn't have fire insurance on the unit, they will have to PAY for the services to get rebuilt or what ever. So what'd the responding truck do, call & check on the surrounding exposures to see if they were paid up before deciding to protect them or not?...Ooops Mr. Neighbour, you're not paid up either, so if your house catches fire as a result of your neighbour, we're going to sit and watch it burn as well.  You're telling me that you'd stand & watch the initial fire spread to other houses and not REACT if it was known they hadn't paid the $75? I'd be more concerned about the ramifications of NOT acting. If someone from 'out of town' gets in a car accident, they will get a bill for the response. We don't check for valid car insurance 1st."
510085,smally21,2010-10-07 18:53:00,993,"most likely rural we would agree?  if a structure fire has progressed enough to threaten/ignite adjacent properties its toast.  especially with 3 ff's working off a 30 year old firetruck.( in a town whose 2500 residents, lets say own 500 homes, each contributing 75$ = 37500 not enough to cover one ffs wage for the year by the way not to mention half million dollar appparauts).  almost ALL rural properties will be destroyed by fire in a rural situation, even in wealthy areas with serious volunteer or composite firefighters.  400 in taxes wont get you fire protection even with a 75 levy.  as to this happening in ontario?  youd have to give me a good ezample, and not soemting you heard from uncle burt.  ontario has great funding for small communties and mutual aid agreements exist between communities as well.  the fireprotection act allows for ff's to enter and act on lands adjacent to their districts so there is no 'its not in our district'.  as an example hamilton responds regularlyy with burlington on the QEw,  and with grimsby, and with brantford."

510097,smally21,2010-10-07 19:15:00,993,"its a stratos excursion series.  it haunts fishless bodies of water surrounding the hammer.  you could have seen it on lake erie from dover to lngpoint, at the bay, on simcoe, etc. or parked at a bar between here and there."
510100,Chance,2010-10-07 19:19:00,420, Wouldnt have a IAFF sticker on it by chance would it?
510112,mbosh1980,2010-10-07 19:36:00,349,"Thats a pretty different system down there... It actually sounds like how fire brigades used to be.  A city would have several brigades run by different insurance companies.  They would only protect buildings that had their companies fire mark (like a little plaque) on the outside which showed they had paid for fire protection.  Obviously cities eventually took over the responsibility to make sure everyone got equal protection. I'm not sure what the deal is down there, but I'm sure its much more complex than the article conveys."
510113,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-07 19:38:00,957,"I'm guessing the mobile home was totaled even before it caught fire.  Metal structures warp beyond repair and that baby had to be pretty hot from being next to the burning shed.  I checked the property on the property tax rolls and it didn't seem to be much of a prize.  Gene Cranick built a roaring trash fire near the shed, the shed caught fire when ol' Gene went inside to shower and then the mobile home ignited.  Burning mobile homes need to be located pretty close to the fire station if we expect firemen to save the structure.  Might have been better to have it burn competely than to tear down and haul off the remains.  Removal can be time consuming and costly.  Who would pay for that?"
510114,Chance,2010-10-07 19:42:00,420,Trucks only carry so much water and without a tanker present or a pond near by when its done its done.If the trailer was a right off then the thought process then turns to saving the exposures or trailers that are not yet involved fully.
510118,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 19:55:00,987,Those who wanted to go put this trailer out wouldn't last a month in today's business market.....   Sad but true.

509862,HTHM,2010-10-07 01:32:00,4082,"This beggars belief!  http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/101006/world/us_house_left_to_burn  SOUTH FULTON, Tenn. - A woman in the southern state of Tennessee said Wednesday she doesn't blame the firefighters who watched while her house burned to the ground after her family failed to pay a $75 annual protection fee.   Paulette Cranic said the firefighters who came to the scene were just following orders. Her family had paid the fee in the past but simply forgot it recently. Cranic, 67, said she's just thankful no one was hurt in the fire last week that destroyed the doublewide trailer in rural northwest Tennessee.   ""You can't blame them if they have to do what the boss says to do,"" Cranic told The Associated Press. ""I've had firemen call and apologize.""   Firefighters did not try to save the burning structure because Cranic had not paid the subscription fee for fire protection. Firefighters went to the scene to keep flames from spreading to nearby property whose owners had paid. The county has no free fire service.   Her grandson, Lance Cranic, 21, who lived there with her and her husband, started the fire while burning trash in a barrel. He went inside to take a shower and upon returning saw a shed next to the house in flames. It spread despite his efforts to put it out with a garden hose.   Paulette Cranic said they had paid the fee in the past, although sometimes late, but it slipped their mind this year.   Lance Cranic said ""this is something I've got to live with the rest of my life.""   ""To see the house and everything you grew up in burning down before your eyes is kind of harsh,"" he said.   He recalled that he called the fire department and asked them to come but they declined.   ""I was in shock,"" he said.   Local officials did not immediately return phone calls Wednesday to The Associated Press for comment but have confirmed to local media that the family did not pay the fee."
509868,Dave Bailey,2010-10-07 01:37:00,1641,"What's worse is that the local authorities have apparently admitted that there was enough tax money in the accounts to pay for emergency services, but they made people pay extra anyway."
509875,mercman,2010-10-07 01:46:00,7054,this is a joke .........right  i've never heard of such Bull. Criminal charges should be laid against the chief who gave the order to watch it burn. sounds a bit like the mafia.Pay your protection money or else...........sheesh
509886,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 02:06:00,987,I bet they don't pay as much in taxes as we do.... Still pretty crappy
509887,knightfisher,2010-10-07 02:18:00,237,"This is sad and sickening. Everyone of those firefighters were afraid to lose their job so they just watched the place burn to the ground. Would of thought there was a least one man there with some integrity.  .....[in-teg-ri-tee]  –noun 1. adherence to moral and ethical principles; soundness of moral character; honesty.....  Now if one or all of the firemen there put out the fire, do you really think they would lose their job. No way. It would have made the papers, the same with it made the papers now."
509893,mercman,2010-10-07 02:28:00,7054,"  iits our moral duty as people, to help out.I think we are even obliged by law to help someone in danger to  the best of our ability."
509894,ontariofisherman,2010-10-07 02:32:00,52,don't laugh to much they do that up here. I know here in Toronto they always ask you for your insurance info so they can bill them. It's kind of funny we pay for the trucks and their salaries from our taxes and we still end up paying more.
509897,Carp,2010-10-07 02:35:00,1488,"So if there was someone inside, they would have stood by and watched them burn to death. Whoever is responsible for this stupidity should be dismissed immediately."
509946,sauce,2010-10-07 10:13:00,219,Its definitely a sad story. I'm sure this doesn't happen often. Especially when people hear about instances like this one. Don't want to pay for protection? Then you'd better be ready to find a new home IF something like this happens. Just imagine how many people would stop paying the protection fee if they found out that their neighbors didn't but were protected anyways. Its a moral dilema for everyone. I'm sure the firefighters on scene all wanted to do something. But you can't blame them for standing by and keeping the situation controlled. Its not like they sat at the hall and played cards waiting for a call that a second (protected) trailer was burning.
509948,sauce,2010-10-07 10:22:00,219,I'm not aware of the fine print involved with the protection fee. But I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with rescuing people that are trapped inside. Fire rescue crew would have likely made an attempt to remove victims from the burning trailer and then let it burn. They do not stand by when lives are at risk. Never. A rescue attempt is made even when the chances of removing a survivor are low. Don't harp on the people that risk their lives to protect ours. No one was injured. No one died.
509949,smally21,2010-10-07 10:24:00,993,south fulton tenn has 2500 residents residential property tax average 409$ fire dept consists of 3 ff's nearest town over 50000 people is 60 miles away. that house was going to the ground anyway. a citizen has no legal duty to act. a firefighter has a legal duty to perform his job to the standards set by his dept. this is a crazy story. im just throwin in some factoids.
509951,splashhopper,2010-10-07 10:37:00,2931,something is very strange about this story as I just read a similar one ( almost verbatem) about a guy in Africa in the same situation....  I am looking for the article
509959,OhioFisherman,2010-10-07 11:31:00,6623,"A union of states? Unfortunately that is not quite accurate, you would think congress here could get one thing right? Promote the general welfare of the people?  It is really a complex situation, some communities are very small, and spread out. Volunteer firemen, and a county sheriff patrol for police protection, some one has to pay to support this? A fire truck and other equipment? Police vehicles?  Some people and communities won`t pass tax hikes to cover these, a politician suggesting them may doom his career, so they make excuses. The small township I live in has a volunteer fire department, but luckily the people support it. We don`t have fire hydrants and some homes are 1/4 of a mile or more off the road and not all driveways are designed for a fire truck to enter.  Fighting a fire with a garden hose may not work well? We have city water, but water to fight fires is usually trucked in or taken from the nearest pond, a time consuming and expensive proposition.  Freedom doesn`t necessarily mean you don`t have to pay taxes and expect every one else to support your needs? Fire protection, police protection, schools?  If you look at some of our states that make a big deal about having no state income tax, or very low taxes? They are usually first in line when they have an emergency and need federal tax dollars to fix it, then they complain about the federal income taxes.  Really not sure of all the details involved in the story, but try buying home insurance after the home has burnt to the ground? My property taxes are $2000.00 a year, but I get fire and police protection and decent schools with that.  "
509981,Billy Bob,2010-10-07 12:56:00,5865,"I have been a volunteer firefighter for over 30 years and what I have learned is there are MANY different set ups when it comes to how a city, town or village finances it's fire protection. But in all cases the fire department has a legal agreement with the people who reside there and can't go beyond that for many reasons with liability to it's firefighters being the #1 reason. And over the years I find everyone either takes their protection for granted or actually complains about it until they need it.  I had a fellow worker once tell me when he sees the flashing blue light on a volunteers vehicle working (trying to get to the firehouse) he said ""he's probably rushing to the beer tap""......  In the case in SOUTH FULTON, Tenn they might now have to look at how they collect their fire protection money, maybe included it in their property taxes to prevent this from happing again.  Bob"
509986,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 13:05:00,987," I would enjoy paying 409$ a year for property taxes, and they didn't disagree to living there, its not like this was a surprise... they are usually late paying the bill and forgot this year. So its something they were aware of, not brought out of left field. Just sounds shocking to a Canadian who's never heard of such things."
509989,wallyboss,2010-10-07 13:17:00,1095,Similar stuff happens in Ontario. In my Hometown i know of a house on a Concession rd that the Fire department watched burned to the ground because the house was on the West side of the street. The west side of the street was in another District.
509996,I'mHooked,2010-10-07 13:45:00,525,"As a Canadian Volunteer Fire Officer I'm appauled at the notion of this. In emergency situations we take 'calculated risks'. The notion that a late $75 could mean the difference between total property destruction and potential protection of some personally valuable property/belongings is ludicrous. We have a duty to ACT within the confines of our level of training. In-action could have our  in legal troubles over negligence issues. The city bills the province $350.00 per truck per hour for responses to provincial highways. Why the hell can't they bill a 'delinquent' home owner for the services they've used to fight their fire? Fight the fire 1st, then send them a bill for $1200 per truck ($300/hr x 4 hrs) plus materials. Add it to their taxes owing. Allow them 1 year at $100/ month to pay it off. They will sure as heck not forget the $75 annual fee again!  My point is, I would ACT then worry about $  Anyone heard the term 'essential service'? Kind of has ring to it!"
510000,SlowPoke,2010-10-07 14:03:00,2984,"Well said. Whether or not this story is true, it doesn't matter. It's a sad state when people are willing to witness tragedy before their very eyes because of policy or money."

It's a sad state when people are willing to witness tragedy before their very eyes because of policy or money.""  Agreed, but, we have some of these same types of people writing opinions to their local newspapers claiming raising taxes amounts to Socialism or Communism. The same type of limited views that prevent us from having a national health care plan of Canadian style?  The same people that seem dead set against it scream like crazy when they open their hospital bill, or don`t carry medical insurance at all.  We have 3 or 4 communities in our area that haven`t paid their fees to the county sheriff`s department, but still won`t pass a levy raising their taxes, and still expect police protection?  Kind of like fishing with out a license? The rest of us are expected to pay? what makes you so special? You gambled and lost?"
510019,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 15:35:00,987, I'd say that hit's the nail on the head.  But at the end of the day should it really cost money to save another human being... in this society we are currently living in... I guess so?

510026,Billy Bob,2010-10-07 16:19:00,5865, You're missing the point on many issues here.....THEY DID BILL the property owner and the bill was NOT paid....no one was in the building so it wasn't a life threating fire but could have had the firefighters fought the fire and one of them got hurt or worse....since they were not under contract to fight the fire then if a firefighter would have gotten hurt maybe their liability insurance would not cover the medical expensive's. It would be like have another fire department from another county respond when they are NOT contracted to do so. Even our mutual aid has to be contracted out to protect the firefighter involved AND all the EXPENSIVE fire fighting equipment.  As Ohiofisherman pointed out......wouldn't it be nice only to buy a fishing license after you were caught fishing without one. When that's OK with you let me know.  Bob
510027,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 16:23:00,987,   If you want to put a value on everything in this world... why would it stop when it comes to saving lives and properties?  People will have to wake up sooner or later....
