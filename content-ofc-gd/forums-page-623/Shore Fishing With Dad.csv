We caught 9 bass by the end of the few hours we spent fishing all were 1lb or under...maybe a pound in a half but either way they were small. Never saw a pike follow a spinnerbait so it might be a week or two early for them or they are just further out off the shores.  Here are 2 pictures, just random fish no significance. Anyway had a ball fishing all day today in the perfect weather.     Thanks for reading, MTBF"

510838,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-10 17:15:00,2582,Thx for sharing that. Time with the old man....priceless.  Next weekend is our annual trip up to Orillia with my brother and father to molest Simcoe perch. Some colorful banter on the water and back at the hotel with a few pops and a good fish fry Saturday night. Wouldn't miss it for anything.
