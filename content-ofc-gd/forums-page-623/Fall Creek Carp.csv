509542,Rich,2010-10-05 21:46:00,3927,"Managed to hit the backyard this morning before the river became chocolate milk and she sure didn't disappoint. 6 of the biggest we have caught back there this year. Can of corn, legwork and patience can lead to a really fun morning, especially on the float reel. The chubs were also co-operative, lol.            "
509671,ehg,2010-10-06 11:57:00,2666,"Carp on a float setup, sounds like a decent fight was had Pretty muddy looking from the rain, that didn't stop ya from trooping there."
509691,Rod Caster,2010-10-06 13:20:00,5784,"Nice hat. that's along the lines of ""bonk and release"" haha I didn't know you could find carp in such small creeks. I would have painted that as a trout creek but not a carp spot. Nice spot, nice pics, nice fish. Are carp typically in such small creeks...are they there only because of the high water?"
509700,Joey,2010-10-06 13:45:00,9122,"Boys will be boys, always playing in the mud  Great report Rich, some decent carp there  Joey"
509702,TC1OZ,2010-10-06 14:01:00,987,Awesome report dude! Gotta love those carp!
509916,splashhopper,2010-10-07 03:05:00,2931,"love that last pic !  Coulda called the thread "" hawgs in da mud"" too"
510033,Leecher,2010-10-07 16:49:00,7832,Sweet reward for your efforts Rich    and on a float reel to boot Thanks for sharing Leechman
510134,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-07 20:27:00,932,Some big Carp for a small body of water . . . interesting.  Looks like a great day out.
510142,MJL,2010-10-07 20:43:00,2427,Great catches Rich.  Been almost a month since my last carp adventure...I may have to boil up some corn for some fall trophy carp action...
510997,iCarp,2010-10-11 10:40:00,50,"Thanks for sharing Rich.  Carp, floats, and creeks are three of my favourite things and it looks like you have a great spot there to enjoy them all.  Are you fishing with your bait pinned to the bottom?  It looks like you could have great results, and fun, drifting your sweetcorn steelhead style in that creek.  Carp will hit hard when they see that yummy yellow lunch going by.  Lots of fun with a centre pin."
511064,Rich,2010-10-11 17:33:00,3927,"Bottom pinned, floated or drifted weightless, depending on the day and how the carp are behaving when I hit the river.  Lots of fun, but nothing serious. Just playing with the carp in the backyard."
511081,jediangler,2010-10-11 19:38:00,1923,Sweet backyard Rich. Get any other species out of there?
