510591,Fish Farmer,2010-10-09 12:58:00,2234,Why would anyone use 407
510604,BillM,2010-10-09 14:37:00,17367, You don't live or work in the city do you.  
510607,bongo,2010-10-09 14:43:00,67,"Can't you tell by his country like accent, he works with cows, lol"
510609,Joey,2010-10-09 15:31:00,9122,Well it sure came in handy when a plane had to emergency land on it yesterday  That was a funny video Chili  Joey
510610,SlowPoke,2010-10-09 15:37:00,2984, Ughhh... Why would anyone use a Tekota when a Magda will do? Why would anyone use an Optima when a Nautilaus will do? Why would anyone use a St. Croix when an Ugly Stick will do?  Because we want to.
510620,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-09 17:26:00,0," Well..... If you can afford it, it can be convenient. It beats traffic.  Its just like the wealthy executives downtown were complaining that there was too much traffic on the Gardner Expressway and they wanted to set up tolls for people to pay for using it to reduce traffic so that the transport trucks and executives could get to work more easier.  Payed for by tax payers dollars but only to benefit the few."
510743,chilli,2010-10-10 02:45:00,199,"I occasionally go from Fort Erie to Brampton for dinner. I'm one of those drivers that likes to set the cruise control and only speed up to pass. On the way to the 407 I feel like running cars off the highway but things smooth out on the 407. Then its back to chaos on the 410. I don't mind stopping for cows, they never had to pass a drivers test but some of these people must have bought their licenses."
510774,Jewelbee,2010-10-10 11:20:00,422,Did you take this video? LOVE this guy's humor..LOL!
510790,Fish Farmer,2010-10-10 13:54:00,2234,"I guess I just like life a little slower, I'll save my 30 bucks and sit back and relax, no rush. I'll still get there, 5 min's later.  Just get up a little earlier, no traffic.  Make a flask of coffee."
510938,chilli,2010-10-11 00:43:00,199,Yes I made that video and fishfarmer I think coffee might be part of the problem. I'm a small town guy so hitting the highway puts me out of my element. I'll do 3 hours in a tree stand over 5 minutes on the highway anyday.
510957,BillM,2010-10-11 02:12:00,17367," If it was only a 5 mins delay, people wouldn't be taking the 407  I despise taking it as well, but my time is worth more then sitting in traffic for hours.."
510967,danc,2010-10-11 02:55:00,4677,Glad I don't have to make such decisions.
