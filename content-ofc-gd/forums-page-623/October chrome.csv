510796,Rod Caster,2010-10-10 14:22:00,5784,Nice one SRT. Those things sure do battle.
510807,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-10 15:04:00,1107,"  this one came out of the water instantly when I set the hook and flew across the hole river landed right infront of a logjam, I thought I was done but it turned and went the other way and proceeded to jump 5 more times wasn't very big but no one told it that."
510811,Rod Caster,2010-10-10 15:10:00,5784," Adrenaline rush eh? One day ago i wouldn't have thought a 5-10lbs fish could fight so hard, but after last nights  whooping I have a new respect for these things. Are theyfilled with gunpowder or what? Set the hook and they explode."
510819,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-10 15:37:00,1107,  Yep thats why I spend all my free time walking the creeks and rivers in the fall I love catching steelhead even a 1lb chromer is fun on a 13' rod and centerpin
510974,BillM,2010-10-11 03:31:00,17367,"All due to the water temps....  When it gets a bit colder they settle down, but not much"
511005,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-11 12:11:00,2690," Got to love October steelhead.  I remember reading an article in Ontario Out of Doors, by John Kerr, probably at least 20 years ago, in which he said he would trade five (may have been ten) spring steelhead for every ONE October 'bow!"
