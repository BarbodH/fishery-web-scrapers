510813,misfish,2010-10-10 15:23:00,29133,"Holly molly,was it nippy this morning in the stand.There was frost on the pumpkin.  Got out at 6 am and sat til 9:30.Have chores to do today,but it sure felt great to finally get out even if it was for a few hours.No deer seen,but the turkeys were out in full force. To bad they dont open until Tuesday.  Back out Monday with Skud.That will be a short stay aswell,being thanks giving and Skuds afraid of his wife  .I,ll be out in the back field using my doghouse ground blind for the first time. The owner told me this morning,the deer were coming back out.   Cant believe Im not posting pics.LOL"
510821,Joey,2010-10-10 15:43:00,9122,Well you got a taste of what's to come B.  So turkey season doesn't open til the day after Thanksgiving?  Priceless  Bet they'll be nowhere to be found on Tuesday!  Good luck to you and Skud.  Joey
510833,danc,2010-10-10 16:52:00,4677, You call watchin' a race on tv a chore Brian??
510835,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-10 17:07:00,2582, Thx Dan...got a good chuckle out of that. Not into it myself...but a few co-workers are hard core.  I thrill them with fishing stories Monday mornings...and they could care less.... and they thrill me with racing stories. Seems like a fair trade off  I tilled up my vegetable garden this AM...but not to early as to upset the neighbors. Beauty day out there. I'm sure your time in the stand was enjoyed Brian.
510841,misfish,2010-10-10 17:28:00,29133," Dan,you know it,s time consuming to get supplies   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,for the race.  Hey look at that,Jr,s in the 5th row. WOOT WOOT."
510847,Leecher,2010-10-10 18:03:00,7832,Yeah was quite chilly overnight..... had to turn on the furnace for the first time this morning  Can't complain about that..... got myself a nice bird too    the frozen type that is  Good luck tomorrow and be safe Jacques
510848,AzuluSpookd,2010-10-10 18:06:00,348,Nice job Brian...Can't wait to get out myself...with my compound...got rid of the xbow last year...so this should certainly be interesting! Just got back from Moose hunt...what a week.
510865,misfish,2010-10-10 19:04:00,29133," The mrs,s not taking care of you Jacques?    Hey Marty. My buddy came back from a bow hunt.Got a 1000 pounder.Still waiting for pic."
511042,misfish,2010-10-11 15:43:00,29133,"Skud and I got out for a few ours this morning.Plan was for Doug to sit in the field stand and I was in my ground blind in the north end field.We arrived at 5:30 am. Pull into the field to drop Doug off,and were greeted with shiny eyes in the field.Boy these deer are earlly birds. No worries.Doug heads to the stand and with hopes of them coming back out. I head to my spot and set up.Blind goes up pretty quick and Im set and ready in 15 minutes.About half hour latter,the yotes are howlling.Need to turn the volume right up.  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf""'>http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvidmg.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fv731%2Fmisfish%2F20101010_01.mp4"">  What a great sun rise.
