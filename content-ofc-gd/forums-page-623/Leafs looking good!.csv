Ottawa really played poorly and the defense was invisible. It looked like they were short handed most of the game.lol I feel sorry for Leclaire. Really good goaltender and the best player out there for Ottawa, even though they lost and he let in a cheesy goal.  That Fisher vs Versteeg fight ticked me off! If I was the coach I would have sent Orr to take care of Fisher! We have to protect our good players! I don't mind when the goons fight but that's about it!"

510741,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-10 02:42:00,0, I'm surprised that Giguere didn't get a shut out! But he had no chance on that goal.
510744,Leecher,2010-10-10 02:55:00,7832,Yeah sounds like they had a solid game
