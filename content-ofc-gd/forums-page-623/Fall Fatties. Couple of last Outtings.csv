Lets start with my first fall nickel!    This pig came out of 20 FOW on a sand point.  It was cought on a YUM crayfish patern.  Tube was on my ''to try'' list.    they did not fail!       This year we found a new weed bed on the lake.  fished it 2-3 times.  it did produce 4 +  but this 5.2lbs bronzy made my friends day.  Hes PB    CHUNKY feeed bag.      Flippin for pike on this lake is a must.  ragetail from strikeking was our ''key'' lure today.    pulled this one out of a weed flat in 25 FOW.  THEN!    sly beats his P.B again. with a 13 lbs pike.    and of cours....  back she goes.    the fall is just starting here in Quebec.     pike and smallies. are getting realy active.

510309,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-08 11:55:00,2690,"Some awesome ""fishies""!!!!  Got to love the YUM.  My better half (Juli) has made me a believer in that stuff.  Kicks Gulp's butt, everytime we go out...in fact on Long Pt...she came up with a Yum pattern that caught perch almost as well as real minnows.  I swear the Gulp minnow actually repelled the perch!!!"
