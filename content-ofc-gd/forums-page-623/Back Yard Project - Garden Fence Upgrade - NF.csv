Started with the tomatoes, I still have to staple plastic mesh around it..... got a small door installed to give me access when it's time to plant or harvest..... notice the hinges and wing nuts.... it opens from the the top    Next, tackled the garlic box..... now this, had to put some thinking into it..... the height of the fence is 36"" and somehow need access for planting and harvest so I decided to build small doors that can be removed from the top by sliding them.... suffice to say that I'm real proud of the outcome    Here it is when all doors are down    I still got this one to do    and this one    But like I said previously, running out of time..... will have to wait until next spring....  The rasberry plants has been cut down to normal heights    and a couple of pine trees has been trimmed to my likings        and so are the flower beds    Now what would Thanks Giving be without one of these    Hope you enjoy! Happy Thanks Giving Everyone Tight Lines Leechman  *********** UPDATE *********** Since it was such a nice day today got a coat of stain applied      Still got the doors to do    Leechman"

510975,sleepjigging,2010-10-11 03:35:00,207,Beautiful wood work.  The mesh that you will install - is that to act as a sun house or to keep critters out?
510978,Joey,2010-10-11 03:46:00,9122,Nice work.  That gives me ideas for my garden.  I was waiting for my blackberries to ripen and just when I figured they'd be ready - gone!!!  Some critter had a nice little dessert
511019,Leecher,2010-10-11 13:56:00,7832, Not much time to fish right now....
