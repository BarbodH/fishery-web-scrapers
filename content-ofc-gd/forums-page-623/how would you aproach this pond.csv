510898,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-10 22:48:00,1107,I would check the regulations for your area first I know in S Ont any pond would be closed right now. Now that being said if they are fair game try spinners out as far as you can get them I would think there out deeper suspended this time of year.
510980,S.M.05,2010-10-11 04:01:00,145,"SRT8 thanks for not jumping on the guy, but asking him to check the regs(one of the other sites I post on is that way). The stocked lakes/ponds in our area are open yr round for browns.  Hard to go wrong with a good ol Mepps black fury. If their shy tip it with a tiny piece of worm. Sunrise and sunset are peak times. Be stealthy  . "
510982,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-11 04:27:00,1107,Nice that would be fun catchin them through the ice I know the regs for my area pretty good but saw he's from Ottawa which I have no clue about the reg. nice stocker brown.
510984,S.M.05,2010-10-11 04:56:00,145, They are lots of fun though the ice. I would post a few pics but I dont want to hijack Walleye_man's post. That was my first brown. Stocker??? What rounded out tail?
510998,Mike P,2010-10-11 11:06:00,19,"  I was fishing for them the other night Chevy. Try leadcore, 4 colours and small spoons and spinners."
