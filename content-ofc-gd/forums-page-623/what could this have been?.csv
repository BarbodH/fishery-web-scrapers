510059,bassmaster4,2010-10-07 17:38:00,801,"I was fishing an area of water that is about 40 meters wide last night with my buddy, it flows into lake ontario my buddy was fishing with a worm with the sinker below his bait. Out of nowhere the rod got dragged into the water and darted out into the lake. I have no idea what it was but im thinking it was a salmon."
510061,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 17:42:00,987," Hope it wasn't a nice rod....  Could of been a salmon or trout, but what do I know?"
510062,bassmaster4,2010-10-07 17:43:00,801,it was just an ugly stik from wal mart i think
510064,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 17:52:00,987, That's a nice rod in my books!  I am on a family budget though...
510067,Muskieman,2010-10-07 17:56:00,2472,Beaver?
510068,capt bruce,2010-10-07 18:03:00,820,"Will not be the first or last rod and reel ripped of the bank by a CARP .I have been with guys who even tho they were some what watching thir rods when fishing for these guys , that had one of those lake o bad boys grab their worm float weight and all and head out into the lake never to be seen again , could have been a trout or salmon (makes for a better story , damn this giant salmon ripped the rod out of my hand and lo I lost my rod ) but I would bet the house that it was just a bottom sucking lowly CARP ,I mean that in a good way for all the carp guys here ,IM sure anyone of them will have a story or two about rod stealing carp.It happens all the time"
510071,TC1OZ,2010-10-07 18:12:00,987," I've come very close to loosing a rod to a carp, I still ended up getting the best of him.  But since then I have purchased a bank rod holder... because you never know when you let go for a second or take your eye of the end to light that smoke....  "
510079,Roy,2010-10-07 18:33:00,13728,Carp.
510083,Spiel,2010-10-07 18:43:00,9065,Replying to what could this have been?  A blessing in disguise.......
510087,smally21,2010-10-07 18:59:00,993,"the fish is trying to tell his buddies 'hey i stole this super fancy gloomis custom blah blah' and his buddies say  'sure man, it was probably just an ugly stick.""  even fish tell fishing stories."
510094,irishfield,2010-10-07 19:10:00,26272,One of our coal fired subs took a wrong turn at Dartmouth...
510095,Tacklebuster,2010-10-07 19:12:00,303,"could have been this or that, maybe even a beaver.  If you don't have one of those rod holders then loosen the drag so that any fish can peel off line, hence leaving your rod where it belongs.  Just an idea"
510111,Headhunter,2010-10-07 19:36:00,5703,"I was fishing the pier at Goderich, many years ago, and yes, fishing for the Wiley River Hog, also known as carp! I was with some newbies so I was distracted for a minute and when I looked back, my rod was gone!!! Grabbed one of the newbies rods, tied on a big heavy spoon and started chuckin it and dragging bottom. Got the rod back and a little 5pd Carp still on the line... So as others have said... probably a carp, but you never know, it could have been a mutated Gobie! HH"
510161,The JAY,2010-10-07 21:22:00,239,"Lost a cheap little spinning rig this year up on Lady Evelyn. Bass pulled it right over the transom while I lit a smoke.... And like Headhunter, I tied on a Storm walleye with a big:asshat: treble on it and got my rig back on the first cast... with the bass still on it.  Your case, I'm guessing a big 'ol carp. I grew up down by the lift bridge in Hamilton, so I've seen how big they can get.... Scary at times...."
510168,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-07 21:44:00,2582,  Thx for the chuckle
510172,GBW,2010-10-07 21:52:00,8460,uglystick's are sunfish magnets so I'm going with this; a W.R. sunfish took it...
510175,Dutchy,2010-10-07 21:56:00,416,I nearly lost a rod when fishing for steelhead in Goderich. And a carp was the culprit.
510220,Rod Caster,2010-10-08 00:10:00,5784,  I had my drag on zero and STILL almost lost my combo to a carp...those fish go NUTS when they figure out they are hooked.
510233,vinnimon,2010-10-08 00:33:00,2593,Carp!!
510234,MJL,2010-10-08 00:40:00,2427,Mermaid who wanted to have some fun by yanking on his worm...
510240,GBW,2010-10-08 00:53:00,8460,
510468,Guest swiss,2010-10-08 21:34:00,0,"Probably a carp, better leave the rod all the way back (not close to the water) next time. Although I would not rule out a mermaid, who works at Wal-Mart during the weekends."
510564,nofish4me,2010-10-09 04:22:00,404,"Ugly Stick I'm of Scottish blood and besides I usually catch as many fish as anyone else in our group (some have reels and rods worth more than some of the cars I own), or even more on a good day."
510586,daryl0815,2010-10-09 12:37:00,225,It was probably a big ol' Tarpon
