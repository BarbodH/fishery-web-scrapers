511082,l2p,2010-10-11 20:18:00,346,"""Man, these new Cameras are amazing! Very vivid pictures! Thanks for sharing."" with that being said i do edit some of the pics i take, nothing crazy i just like trying to make the colours pop out more.  Some more pics i took this fall season.              "
511086,MJL,2010-10-11 20:46:00,2427,Beautiful pics Mark and great fish! I'll be getting into steel full-time very shortly...  Are you using just a basic P&S camera?   You have much more patience than me...I just picked up a tank of a DSLR today (Still need a new lens).  Iâ€™m pretty sure most rocks found on the riverbank weigh less   .  Hopefully no more post processing
511093,Leecher,2010-10-11 21:15:00,7832,Awesome pics l2p Thanks for sharing Leechman
511094,l2p,2010-10-11 21:16:00,346,"haha nice whatcha get? cannon? im just using my dads olympus dslr, dont even know model name. its got wierd aperture settings on it so i edit the pics most of the time!"
511097,MJL,2010-10-11 21:28:00,2427," Canon 40D.  FrozenFire came with me for moral support...Handing over that much money for anything other than a centrepin or a new float rod just seemed so foreign and highly irregular - It was on the borderline of just being wrong.  With 6fps in burst mode, I should be ready for some tail walking steelie action and the weather sealed body makes it somewhat more idiot proof"
