I was 'blessed' to be able to buy the camp nextdoor about 4 years ago, so , I turned it into my custom rodbuilding shop. Then I added my ""cooking/ smoking"" gear to it. ( I cater banquets, too).  rodbuilding first::      threadwork on custom rods::   this guy owns a restaurant called ""The Train Station""...      bass rod for a young guy..    colorful handles on rods..     this rod maches the truck...   now , the mancave part..I don't NEED to go to the wife's house for anything, except to take a dump I have all the 'necessities' for life...wood stove, TV, fridge, freezer, microwave/coffee pot.    with stainless prep table on the proch's ""outdoor kitchen""..   And, the cookers...a horizontal smoker, & 2 drum smokers...    with lots of wood...   a few 'samples'...  chickens, turkey breast, & acorn squash..   some ribs..   a brisket...   lake erie steelhead...   & I have my 3 best friends ..   And, my Son & friend on Chemong...    And, I sometimes have to share with other ""visitors""'''      Life is Good"

510412,torco,2010-10-08 18:32:00,656,"That is impressive, since having a baby I feel like my space is getting smaller and smaller. Originally it was the rec room in the basement and now every day my wife is harping on me to get rid of my table top hockey game which so far I have refused to make a point. I am trying to turn the garage into my space but everything seems to pile up in there.  I may need to build another shed next year and turn into my own mancave. I figure run some electricity, put at TV and couple comfy chairs, beer fridge. Plus keep all my fishing stuff in there and I will be set. But something tells me I'm dreaming."
510415,Terry,2010-10-08 18:35:00,14456,"here is as close to a man cave as I could get                    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=5dollarDogHouse.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/5dollarDogHouse.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  well the dog wasn't using it      LOL"

Yup, more than a couple of taps...   I take a lot of pride in my brewing efforts, and do I like to share quality homebrew with my buddies.  Cheers "
510565,Dara,2010-10-09 04:24:00,3052,Mine is a woodworking shop           the pictures are a month old and lots has changed. I just built the house and shop this summer.

510576,lew,2010-10-09 11:26:00,12766,"When we began our search for a new home in the country last winter we had a wish list of what we wanted and it included a big house, lotsa rooms and plenty of property, but something at the top of MY personal  list was a large garage for a shop and room for my boat and also the truck and fortunately we got everything on the list.  The garage is over 1000 sq. ft. at 21' X 52' and is fully insulated and has a propane furnace and then upstairs at the rear is a fully finished 400 sq. ft. loft.    All the room any guy could ask for inside.    A great shop for putzing around or building things and there's even a sign on the back wall that my daughter got me for Fathers Day that says ""Dad's Man Cave""  Infact, I just finished building a nice walk in closet for one of the rooms and it was great having all the space in the shop to fabricate everything..    My boat is 19' long  and it's great to just back all the way in and still have plenty of space in front to park my truck with still over 1/2 the garage not being used.    My wife asks me why we bothered buying such a gorgeous home when I spend all my time in the garage    Gonna be a fantastic place to hang out thru the winter months !!"
