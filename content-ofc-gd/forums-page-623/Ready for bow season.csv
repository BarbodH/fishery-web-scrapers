510636,Skud,2010-10-09 18:56:00,739,I was brushing up on my shooting skills with my compound bow for the deer season. Had to adjust the sites because it was wandering a bit to the right. Got things straightened out but it cost me twenty dollars.    Even pushed the nock straight down the shaft.  
510645,archer379,2010-10-09 20:12:00,277,very nice. gets expensive if you do it to many times lol. I still have have my first one around somewhere. used to have it on the wall. non shooters wont belive you did it by shooting. i always shoot a 3 spot traget now.

510685,misfish,2010-10-09 23:13:00,29133,"Doug is very good with his bow.Kicks my ass,and I use a crossbow,,,,,,,with a scope."
510939,chilli,2010-10-11 00:49:00,199,"My god it took me 3 looks to figure out why the arrow was so bloody long. I've done it once with a crossbow using 16"" bolts but since have only cut the feathers off. Now can you get a deer broadside and in range?"
