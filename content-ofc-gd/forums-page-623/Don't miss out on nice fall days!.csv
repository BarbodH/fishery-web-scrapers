I went fishing for some walleye's in the Field region I fished without even having to put a jacket on !! The fishing wasn't too fierce but was still able to catch about 15 nice eyes, most of them where released, kept a couple for a nice meal. The point is don't miss out on this time of year when most people are gone hunting, the lakes are almost deserted! Only the hardcore fisherman are outthere fishing and getting the best fishing there is! FALL=BEST FISHING OUT OF THE WHOLE SEASON !!! FOR SIZE AND NUMBERS! Hint: Slow down your action/retrieve on most days !     19"" walleye (Released)     Girlfriend's Nephew is happy about my catch lol     Get out there and have some fun !"
