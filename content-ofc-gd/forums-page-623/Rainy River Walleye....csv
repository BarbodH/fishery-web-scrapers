508605,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-02 00:48:00,0,"Went do do a lil' bassin off shore today, and caught a nice surprise!  Caught a nice lil' muskie right away (very rare in this river), and about 20 minutes later, felt a distinct walleye nibble, lol. So I let the jig/minnow sit for a minute, and baam! Nice 3lb walleye.  So I changed targets and fished mainly jigs with minnows, a few leeches, and a few grubs. Within 3 hours had about 13 walleye, and a few saugers.  I'm so happy, can't wait for tomorrows bite!!!"
508612,limeyangler,2010-10-02 01:17:00,5204,  Nuffink like the inmistakeable 'THUD' feel of a nice walleye bite......cant wait for this weekend either....2 days on Lac Seul.  Nice job on the musky!
508621,Leecher,2010-10-02 01:45:00,7832,Sounds like you guys hit the walleye jackpot Thanks for sharing Leechman
508644,Nipfisher,2010-10-02 03:12:00,2449,"Where are the pictures Manitou? Can't just tell us, we have to see the fish."
508656,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-02 06:09:00,0," I only kept 5, but I'll get the pics up in the am.  I was fising alone for the first bit, so I usually dont take pics by my lonesome. I did take a few with the help of wifey once I got home though, lol"
508660,scugpg,2010-10-02 11:21:00,1373,I wish I could get back up there sometime this fall!
508688,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-02 16:38:00,0," Too bad you cant come right away, lol.  There are two good fishing derbies in the next few weeks, Oct.20 in Manitou, which is just a one day. And a good one out in Morson on Lake of the Woods, a good three day er.  For the next 2 months, there are hyyyyoge walleye around here, makes for a fun day. Get the braid on and get ready for 10+lbers throughout the day!!!!"
508716,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-02 21:06:00,0,"Went to the same spot again today, caught some nice keepers in the range of 18-21 inches. I'll upload and get yesterdays and todays pics up sometime after our b-day party this evening.  In other news, I lost a nice 10+lber, right at the net too, so heartbreraking"
508720,Leecher,2010-10-02 21:31:00,7832, Looking forward to your report and pics
508780,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-03 01:52:00,0,"I got some more pics from today I'll put up as well.  These walleye were caught in 7- 22ft of water, using many different baits. Some were chartruese jigs and minnows, or black or pink jigs. Some were caught on white grubs or bloodsuckers.  I casted out and to my left, let it hit bottom, let the current drag it to my right a few few, then a slow steady retrieve just ever so slightly bouncing off bottom. @ nights ago I had to pause, jig, pause, reel. Today was a steady slow retrieval after the jig hit bottom.  The 5lb smallie was caught using a jerk method with a Rapala flat rap, firetiger pattern. Beautiful healthy fish, fought like a ton of bricks  More pics to come  "
508781,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-03 01:54:00,0,a few more...  
508893,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-03 18:15:00,0,"more pics coming from earlier today. Started catching walleye right off the bat, even though it's so windy it's hard to place the bait, lol. Only 2 keepers for the fish fry tonight, all the rest were in the 5-6lb range, too big to eat!  Today they were biting on a white/pink jig, with black/silver salted grubs, also black jigs with salted white/yellow/black grubs. Haven't had to resort to any live bait as of yet  Seen one other boat out a few hundred yards away, and seen them pulling in the walleye as well  I love this time of year!!!"
508950,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-03 23:16:00,0,"well, done for the day, ended with 38 walleye between a few of us. Time for a nice feed!  My son (6 years old) also tied into his biggest walleye to date, 5lbs!!!!"
