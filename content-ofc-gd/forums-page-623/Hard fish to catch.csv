510241,Rod Caster,2010-10-08 00:58:00,5784,  Sacrificial lures to the salmon gods huh?
510301,singingdog,2010-10-08 10:39:00,1047,"Rainbows in lakes. I can catch them just fine in current, but not in still-water. Anytime I target them I feel like I'm just rinsing lures."
510466,Guest swiss,2010-10-08 21:25:00,0," What's so bad about that? Isn't the whole point of fishing is to enjoy the outdoors? I could care less if I don't catch any fish. The hardest fish to catch is anything, especially if you're shore fishing, which is what I do all of the time."
510493,Rod Caster,2010-10-08 22:49:00,5784," The point of fishing is what you make it. Some people have goals set when they go out and others simply enjoy the time with friends and the outdoors. I'm A-ok with both  I've been chasing bows for the past few weeks and not a sniff. It's a beautiful area so I'm the better just for trying, but I sure wish oh I wish I wish I had caught that fish."
510497,Muskieman,2010-10-08 22:59:00,2472,Wow!  Randy 
510528,aplumma,2010-10-09 00:47:00,6896,"Chris should be able to catch them then since he is a sub fisherman.  My white whale is a Blue Catfish we call ""Fluffy"" who was last caught last year and weighed #56 lbs. Out of 4 of us no one has seen her I sure hope she was returned if someone else caught her.   Art"
510702,Bunker,2010-10-10 00:34:00,29,"I got My muskie this year So I would have to say, For Me it would have to be a walleye over 13lb's  on Quinte  with a jig.."
510727,BillM,2010-10-10 02:01:00,17367,"50 inch pike (Oh so close at 48.5 inches)  This spring though, I feel it!!!!!"
509872,Rod Caster,2010-10-07 01:42:00,5784,"We all have a proverbial ""white whale"". That certain fish that we've chased and tried to catch on many occasions without success. It might be a resident 5 lbs brown trout in your local creek or an elusive musky that has made you circle a lake ten times with nothing but 5 empty tanks of fuel to show for your work. Everytime you go out you are over-prepared and confident, yet you return home with nothing but scenery shots.  I've spent many hours trolling and ice fishing for big lake trout. Many lakes, different spots, lots of reading, new tactics and many miles on my car. I have nothing to show but a 0.5 lbs baby laker and I'm still searching for something of substance. I'm looking forward to hard water season because I'm certain ( ) I'll catch a big one!   What fish are you working extra hard to catch?"
509878,mercman,2010-10-07 01:52:00,7054,fish...........          but wait till next year

509881,splashhopper,2010-10-07 01:54:00,2931,"I want to land a 40""+ pike in the river I fish solo on targeting them.  I know they are there   as i have caught quite a few 25-30"" ones so far this summer on it."
509917,ch312,2010-10-07 03:09:00,1590,this year? salmon
509927,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-07 03:28:00,0,atlantic salmon in the st. mary's rapids have had my number for years.  i can catch them in the tailrace below the hydro dams but in the rapids i was broken off by 13 consecutive fish.  it's been a decade or so since i fished the rapids in summer but it's been a definite thorn in my side.
509930,limeyangler,2010-10-07 03:40:00,5204,brookies and specks....spent many hours treading quietly around on the ice ....no luck yet.
509932,OhioFisherman,2010-10-07 03:58:00,6623,"Only landed one ski by accident a small one, had some big fish on but not properly prepared for them."
509939,Kinger,2010-10-07 04:39:00,351,"Never caught a brook trout, lake trout or brown trout.  I have never known when/where to fish for them."
509945,toca,2010-10-07 06:29:00,274,lake trout in algonquin
509950,smally21,2010-10-07 10:26:00,993,i catch more unicorns than walleye these days
509971,LucG,2010-10-07 12:27:00,779, We'll have to go to Temagami this winter. I caught some pretty decent lakers there last year.
509972,Harrison,2010-10-07 12:30:00,2202,"Only spent a couple days trying, but found Lake trout in Sheild lakes tough to get a handle on."
509973,Rod Caster,2010-10-07 12:36:00,5784,"   Thanks Luc. I spent at least 7 full days on the ice last year in the temagami area looking for back lake Trout but litterally didn't get one bite. Lots of work hauling that auger around in cold/slushy conditions.    +1. Two hours last night, two hours monday, half a day last weekend etc etc...not a sniff! And yet I keep seeing these beautiful Steelhead reports on the board."
509975,jbailey,2010-10-07 12:41:00,866,those prehistoric lookin walleye constantly avoiding my line grrr
509985,anders,2010-10-07 13:02:00,1168, Come up to the park this winter...we'll show you! And by we i mean bring up the doc and we can meet up for some solid action!
510024,Kinger,2010-10-07 16:17:00,351,That would literally be a dream come true
510028,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-07 16:34:00,0,it's not like i haven't tried to getcha out duders!  how many times did i invite you this summer?
510037,Spiel,2010-10-07 16:58:00,9065,Try as I might fishing all the local southern Ontario rivers in the fall I've still yet to hook into an Arctic Char! Very frustrating.......
510040,Rod Caster,2010-10-07 17:01:00,5784,  I think they are called sub-arctic char in your region.
510084,Kinger,2010-10-07 18:43:00,351,"  At least 5 or 6. My head has been quite clouded.  I should have at least gone for bass once with you, the videos looked incredible."
510109,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-07 19:35:00,0, have you tried using a marshmallow?
510116,dave524,2010-10-07 19:49:00,4508,"I really haven't specifiacally targeted them, but have had a few gar strike while fishing other species, I'd say they are pretty tricky getting the hooks into them good enough to land one, haven't done it yet. Low percentage fish I'd say making them my hardest to catch."
510129,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-07 20:20:00,0,"muskie for me.  I usually end up so frustrated I'll switch to bass and or walleye  I did catch a few this summer, but nothing of any size.  Oh, and big sturgeon, like over the hundred lb mark. I've caught plenty in the 40-60lb range. I've hooked a few bigger ones, but usually ends up being a 20-30 minute fight only to have them break me off."
510164,codered,2010-10-07 21:27:00,123,"Well I havent got a real big pike yett. lake trout on simcoe last winter  were  ..  Well ,, didnt catch  one  I fished it  twice as much as previous years   landed about 50 whitefish  and  not a single trout .. The year before I caught  just as many Trout as whitefish..Strange ..."
