510624,Stern Rules,2010-10-09 17:59:00,342,It's supposed to be the best time to fish the 2 or 3 days before and after a new and full moon with the new and full moon being the best days.
510632,The JAY,2010-10-09 18:49:00,239,"Never had much luck using the solunar calendar as a guide. No more than on 'off' days anyway. Paid pretty close attention to it this year... But, then again, some swear by it...."
510637,Roy,2010-10-09 18:57:00,13728,"It doesn't have much to do with ""full moon, new moon"" etc... but more to do with moon rise and moon set (activity) and that's just a small part of the equation. Get your self a book or two by John Alden Knight before you discount the solunar theories."
510655,mercman,2010-10-09 21:02:00,7054,"  i've been reading alot about it on the net.i guess as i practice, i will get better at it.i didnt do so bad this year fishing. my biggest probelm has been retrieval speed and patiences patience kinda disappeared when i turned 50  im not used to the speed that baitcasters have when retieveing my bait.i figure if i learn more about habitat, and how the fish are affected by weather and such, that it'll make me a better angler next spring.........can't hurt  paul i wonder if they would have that book at indigo"

510696,Dave Bailey,2010-10-10 00:09:00,1641,"I've often thought that this would be interesting to investigate scientifically, but the logistics are daunting. Arranging a double-blind test would consume a lot of time and effort."
510704,mercman,2010-10-10 00:36:00,7054,  sheesh......maybe i should rethink this idea and put another logistic on the fire
