Locals tell me that fishing is much better if the dam were ""on"".  Can anyone tell if the dam is running again after the recent rainfall?  Thanks."

509404,Keenan,2010-10-05 15:09:00,59,one side of the damn is open
509485,fish-miester,2010-10-05 19:01:00,864,the flow is very minimal. and I have heard locals say the same thing.
509583,sleepjigging,2010-10-05 23:53:00,207,"Went there on Sat. night. One side was open - since Friday night. I didn't skunk but one pannie and one GSFW was not what I was expecting. I did not see many fish come out of the water.  However, I did meet some locals that said - the fish were on - Friday night. And the Friday before that (even with no flow.) Their most important advice: come out and fish - cause you ain't going to catch nothing from your couch.  Thanks guys."

Well because of this post I headed up Saturday night, 10:30 rolled around I got a hit on a spinner thing I've got rigged wth a minnow, and a guy next to us on a pink jig and white grub pulled out a 22 incher.  After that nothing happened for an hour so I packed up.  Get out and fish!"
