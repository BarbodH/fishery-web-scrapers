So early this am I went fishing to settle my mind, and got this little gem!Back she went!That made my day knowing I was going to muck around with the boat, engine wise in the afternoon! I arrived home to a mess, so I opted for the boat work!LOL So I stripped the engine down a bit, took an hour!All the tools were on board!I recall telling thejay, if I had to rebuild on the water, it can be done!LOL Anyway heres the pics!  If theres any boat techs here, I would love to hear your opinion on the cam gear wear(damage)! too high rpms,wrong prop? Here you go"
510680,vinnimon,2010-10-09 23:00:00,2593,Another view of the cam gear!
510959,HTHM,2010-10-11 02:20:00,4082,I'd say you put the tooth fairy out of business....
510970,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-11 03:00:00,1107,Ouch that looks bad hope ya get her fixed all up for spring
510989,vinnimon,2010-10-11 09:23:00,2593, Spring?  A week from now!LOL it should be back in the water for some bow action!
510992,Fisherman,2010-10-11 10:08:00,7201,Rusty cam..and more the the shaft to the right..
510994,greenfshrmn,2010-10-11 10:18:00,65,"I'm not sure that we are seeing rust, I think it may just be the colour of the fibre cam sprocket.  Did it come out that clean or have you wiped all the oil off it?  I'm wondering if there's any motor oil reaching the gears.  Check to make sure that there is nothing preventing the camshaft from turning (other than valve spring tension)before replacing everything.  Good luck...Oh yeah, don't foget those timing marks too~"
511011,bassjnkie,2010-10-11 12:45:00,1101,I agree with green. Looks like a lack of oil.
511020,vinnimon,2010-10-11 13:57:00,2593,"No rust, internally!Both gears had plenty of oil on them!The cam gear is that colour(compsite fibre) to begin with. Cam shaft turns freely! I spoke to tech about this issue!Its more than likely, running the engine at too high of an rpm!  "
511034,SBCregal,2010-10-11 15:00:00,688,looks like it may be a balance problem
