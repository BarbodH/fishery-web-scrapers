Got the rest done all around the property. I made sure they were big enough so when asked,did you see the sign?        Now that signs were done and taken care of, it was time to clean up around the stands and get the feed out.  I picked up this blend from TSE.SMELT GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT.     Still pretty green and lots of leaves on the trees,but a good heavy rain and wind should knock them off.  Feeder filled    Stand one    Two    And three    Time came to set up the trail cam. New batteries,check,1GBchip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, DOH,left in on the pc table.Oh well.Still early yet."

Thanks Merc.  Rodcaster,"
510440,TC1OZ,2010-10-08 19:39:00,987,That looks pretty sweet! Whats it run ya to buy land to hunt on? Prolly a couple grand and a few hundered bucks a year for property taxes?  Lucky you! Looks like you have a great season ahead of you!

510453,Leecher,2010-10-08 20:13:00,7832, Well.... let me see..... your going to have to choose one or flip a coin
510460,mercman,2010-10-08 20:52:00,7054," HE SAID ON HIS ORIGINAL POST, HE ASKS THE LANDOWNERS PERMISSION TO HUNT ON HIS LAND. as i said in a previous post, you should read the WHOLE post and not just the words you can read.  peace  paul"
510464,misfish,2010-10-08 21:22:00,29133,Easy Paul.
510467,bassjnkie,2010-10-08 21:30:00,1101,"Your set Brian, looks like a great area. I'm going to set my spots up on Monday."
510483,misfish,2010-10-08 22:24:00,29133,"Ok Jacques,so what yer saying is,good luck.LOL     TC1OZ  I dont own the land (wish I did) nor do I have to pay the taxes(thankfully,but would be willing to help if asked).I do though,share my havests with the land owner.My second year hunting on his property,I was lucky enough to shot a 7 pointer.He was given a quarter of the animal.Butchered and wrapped at my expense. The following spring,I was lucky to get two turkeys.First was mine,as it was my first,the second,was cleaned and wrapped and delivered by myself with a bottle of white wine.  Some have a hard time getting property due to problem tresspassers ignorant hunters.  If anyone is lucky enough to get such a piece of property,treat the owner like a best friend."
510486,mercman,2010-10-08 22:35:00,7054,  lol !!! he riled me up with his latest remark on your original post. go check it out.  breath in breath out.....
510487,Skud,2010-10-08 22:37:00,739,I think that second tree stand is too close to the ground.
510488,Leecher,2010-10-08 22:39:00,7832, Yeah that's pretty much it Brian LOL   and I hope you get to set your sights on a creature in the dead zone this season
