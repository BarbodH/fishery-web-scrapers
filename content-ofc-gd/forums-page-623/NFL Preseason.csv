510262,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-08 01:55:00,932," Yes Sir, just what a young team needs to build some confidence.  Watch out if they upset the Texans or the Colts in the next two weeks.  They have the coaching to do it, though I still think they lack the QB.  Run game will make some big plays and chew the clock and the receiver staff is quietly dangerous . . . and I think they're better on D.  Again, lifelong Packer fan here, but I like what KC is doing and I did last year as well.  They'll be hosting a PO game @ Arrowhead in the next couple years.  And the Bills will make a serious bid for 0-16.  Maybe they'll beat the Jags this weekend though, they also have Cleveland (though they perenially struggle vs them in some of the worst games the NFL can produce).  They'll take a QB first overall and then they'll remind themselves that not even Manning, Brees or Rodgers could do anything behind that O-Line - the worst in the league."
510481,Billy Bob,2010-10-08 22:21:00,5865,"WOW, I'm impressed with your NFL knowledge....."

510492,Gerritt,2010-10-08 22:48:00,6129,I am afraid to admit here on OFC.. but I have been a Minnesota fan for all my life....  Sad that I still root for a losing team... But I do the same for the Leafs..  perhaps one day..  one of them will win!  G.
510536,rock34,2010-10-09 01:14:00,215," I will give you credit for sure man.  I didnt see it coming.  I do think they will be 3-3 still in 3 weeks and I still have 8-8 overall, which is better than I would have projected pre-season.  Their major hangup is that their QB is backup quality and that is it.  Their running game is quite dynamic though.  Oct. 10  	at Colts   L 06 	Oct. 17 	at Texans  L 07 	Oct. 24 	Jaguars    L 08 	Oct. 31 	Bills 	   W 09 	Nov. 07 	at Raiders L 10 	Nov. 14 	at Broncos L 11 	Nov. 21 	Cardinals  W 12 	Nov. 28 	at Seahawks L 13 	Dec. 05 	Broncos    W 14 	Dec. 12 	at Chargers L 15 	Dec. 19 	at Rams    W 16 	Dec. 26 	Titans 	   L 17 	Jan. 02 	Raiders    W"
510621,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-09 17:39:00,932," Yeah, I won't say 11-5 either, but Ill give 'em a few more wins than you did (def the Jax game).  Right Now I'll call it 10-6.  Oct. 10  	at Colts   L 06 	Oct. 17 	at Texans  L 07 	Oct. 24 	Jaguars    W 08 	Oct. 31 	Bills 	   W 09 	Nov. 07 	at Raiders W 10 	Nov. 14 	at Broncos L 11 	Nov. 21 	Cardinals  W 12 	Nov. 28 	at Seahawks L 13 	Dec. 05 	Broncos    W 14 	Dec. 12 	at Chargers L 15 	Dec. 19 	at Rams    W 16 	Dec. 26 	Titans 	   L 17 	Jan. 02 	Raiders    W  The Chiefs getting Cleveland and Buffalo as opposed to Denver getting Baltimore and The Jets is a big blow for Denver.  Still, the Broncs shouldn't be 8 point dogs this weekend - that's crazy with how their offense has looked."
494182,Billy Bob,2010-08-13 18:59:00,5865," Blaque, you are correct in saying that the athletes of those days are long gone. Now it's ""where's MY money"" and kiss my feet. Sorry not this guy. NFL football is no longer in my heart these days as it once was not only because the Bills are not a good team but also because of the THUGS through out the league.  The ""Network""....wasn't that the club Jim Kelly owned downtown..if it was, my son was playing little league football then and we got to take the team down there and the kids were on TV because they taped a show out of the place. The head coach, Mike Powers new people in high places and got the invite.  It will be interesting to see how the rest of history will be written once Ralph Wilson passes away.....I can see the team going to LA or MAYBE Toronto. Time will tell.  Bob"
494185,uglyfish,2010-08-13 19:22:00,981,Giants and Buccaneers!
494187,bow slayer,2010-08-13 19:27:00,1074,"  well the Bills of the early 90s may have gotten their limit of dolphins,it was the cowboys,redskins and giants they could not hook. Sorry to say I still remember listening to superbowl game on the radio when Norwood went ""wide right""   I was so excited I almost went off the road. A dolphin's fans biggest nightmare would have been the bills cashing in on that or one of the other 3."
494199,misfish,2010-08-13 19:51:00,29133," It will all change,when they become the TORONTO BILLS."
494200,Steve_R,2010-08-13 19:55:00,81,You have to feel sorry for Marino...was one of the best QBS and never got a ring...
494208,blaque,2010-08-13 20:25:00,2419," My sentiments exactly.........i spend more time fishing these days on sundays during the season. And its not even the bland football team thats on the field nowadays here in Buffalo that is to blame, but more the feel of the game. Its just flat to me anymore.  And yeah i believe Kelly owned or at least co-owned Network. It was one of the banks that used to be downtown turned into a club........you could enter it thru the main place mall or outside on i believe N. division street. Its funny, I used to live there on weekends but its location is a bit fuzzy if you get my drift LOL"
494235,lucabrasi,2010-08-13 22:49:00,114,"A pretty diverse fan base on this board....and that's great. But I'm suprised that I'm the first to make mention of the 5 five-time Superbowl champion, 8-time NFC Champion, the 2010 NFC favourite and soon to be 6-time Superbowl champs, ""The World's Team"", the Dallas Cowboys. I've been a hardcore fan, and I mean hardcore, for over 30 years.  Good luck to everyone and their teams. Should be another great season!  BTW, anyone play pro-line/pointspread? How d'ya do last season? I was terrible. Hope to do better this year."
494238,Billy Bob,2010-08-13 23:21:00,5865," Don't feel bad about being a bit fuzzy....there are a LOT of old NFL QB's that are still fuzzy from being blind sided by Bruce Smith.....he was on the radio this morning talking about the old days here in Buffalo and he wished this Buffalo team luck but tried to say playing that 3-4 defense is a lot harder then most think.  I can still remember like yesterday at games at Rich Stadium when it was a third down situation and the opposing team needed to throw the ball for a first down and chants of BRUCE  BRUCE  BRUCE got louder and louder while he pinned his ears back and made ANOTHER important sack for the defense. He beat MANY double and triple teams to do it but sometimes he needed a little help and Biscuit Bennet ran down the QB with his lighting speed. OH, those were the days, my friend.  When my son went on to Cortland State to play middle linebacker is when I learned to watch college football...we follow him and his team all over the country and really enjoy watching him play. But even now I still rather watch college football for various reasons....#1 reason is there is a LOT LESS commercials and a LOT MORE FOOTBALL played."
494240,ctdd2006,2010-08-13 23:27:00,531, Don't be too quick raising that banner!  GO PACKERS!  See you in week 9!
494241,lucabrasi,2010-08-13 23:28:00,114," The College game is definitely a great tradition and a lot fun to watch no doubt. I don't watch it as much as I used to unfortunately. Bang on about the NFL and commercials. It gets worse and worse every year. You used to be able to watch an NFL game in less than 3 1/2 hrs, now their pushing 4 with all the stoppages. It's getting really annoying."
494244,Toddyc20,2010-08-13 23:32:00,141,I'll be the second one to say Go Broncos!!  I love my Broncos and always will.  Although i don't think they're going to have a good year this year i'll still cheer like they have a shot at the superbowl.
494246,lucabrasi,2010-08-13 23:34:00,114, HAHA! Love it! I'll seeya week 9 alright. Should be fun.
494247,lucabrasi,2010-08-13 23:39:00,114," Don't get too down on your Broncs. Until Dummervil went down, I would've given them more of a shot. But your biggest problem might me your QB. You might wish you still had Cutler. (What is it about that Belichick clan that breeds arrogance) McDaniels made a big mistake in getting rid of him."
494273,Marty,2010-08-14 01:36:00,873,Steelers.  THE only team with SIX and more on the way.
494286,Toddyc20,2010-08-14 01:58:00,141," I'm just a realist.  Two running backs already injured, pro bowl linebacker out till december, Kyle Orton as the #1 QB and just lost the #1 receiver (Marshall) and replaced him with a rookie.  The Broncos will be great again but not this year."
494316,Dusky,2010-08-14 04:12:00,310,"No high hopes, but I just can't ditch the BOYS, Dallas all the way!!"
494368,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-14 14:14:00,932," Who in the rest of the division outside of San Diego is going to be better than the Chiefs?  The Broncos?  Not Likely . . . McDaniels is ruining that team systematically.  Oakland is Oakland.  Trust me Rock, I got Prociw to go through the Chiefs lineup when he was saying the same things to me, and he was immediately convinced.  They've been stock-piling picks and making good ones.  Oh, and does this coaching staff look familiar?  HC - Todd Haley OC - Charlie Weiss DC - Romeo Crenell  "
494482,lunkerbasshunter,2010-08-14 22:00:00,2585,which ever team i bet on is my favorite team!!!!  i love football but it signals the end of summer so lets enjoy the next few weeks before its here  cheers!

510137,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-07 20:37:00,932," It's not too early to say I told you so, is it?  They'll win the division next year and compete for it this year (as previously stated).  Here's the remaining schedule:  05   	Oct. 10  	at Colts 06 	Oct. 17 	at Texans 07 	Oct. 24 	Jaguars 08 	Oct. 31 	Bills 09 	Nov. 07 	at Raiders 10 	Nov. 14 	at Broncos 11 	Nov. 21 	Cardinals 12 	Nov. 28 	at Seahawks 13 	Dec. 05 	Broncos 14 	Dec. 12 	at Chargers 15 	Dec. 19 	at Rams 16 	Dec. 26 	Titans 17 	Jan. 02 	Raiders  Hahahaha - A legitimate shot at 11-5 based on strength of schedule.  I'll be cheering for them (and my Packers as always)."

494049,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-13 12:02:00,932," I feel your pain . . . I have a lot of friends that are Bills fans, some are long-time season ticket holders and they still just keep going, full well knowing that it's going to be disappointment after disappointment.  Like me when it comes to basketball . . . I'm a Knicks fan  If you're looking for some ""up and comers"" I think these are a few:  The Bengals - will win the division this year and could win a playoff game or two.  That young defense is starting to look SCARY.  Their O is still capable.  The Chiefs - This year will be when they start emerging, and depending on when they emerge, they could even compete for the division.  I think they'll win the division in 2011 and start to cash in on all those early draft picks they've been taking.  I don't have a second favourite team, but if I was going to adopt one, it would be right here.  You've got to love their tradition too.  Remember when Arrowhead was inpenitreble?  The NFC doesn't offer much - the East is generally a crap-shoot and I find the teams kind of disgusting.  Packers/Vikings will win the North division, the other will win a wildcard.  The south will clearly be New Orleans & Atlanta and the West is just terrible.  I hate how the 49ers have been ""dark horses"" for the past 8 seasons now.  I don't do Superbowl predictions this early, but if I had to, I'd say Green Bay represents the NFC and (for lack of a better option) the Colts get one more crack at it before their ""dynasty"" fades."
494077,rock34,2010-08-13 13:28:00,215," Ryan, are you serious with the Cheifs??  Come on now.... They are miles away from decent at this point.  Matt Cassel is not a good enough QB to lead any team that is not the Patriots to the playoffs.  I give KC last in the AFC West this year with 4 wins.  Unfortunetly one of those wins will come against the Broncos as usual."

494101,Billy Bob,2010-08-13 14:30:00,5865," I can remember some tough games the Bills had in Arrowhead and coming home with their heads between their legs....but I also remember RICH STADIUM as being unmerciful to any team that dared to come into it's confines. Between the VERY FAST No Huddle K-Gun and extremely loud fans, most teams didn't know what hit them until they were back on the plane heading home shaking their heads in disbelief.  Although I'm not a season ticket holder I was at several of those games and I remember my two young sons holding their fingers in their ears because of the noise level when the opposing team was on offense, especially in the Red Zone. I can also remember opposing defenses having to take ""basketball"" time out because of how fast Kelly ran the No Huddle offense. Later defenses faked injuries to save on time outs. But it didn't help, Kelly still got the ball in the end zone......now we can't even get near the Red Zone...sometimes not even past the 50 yard line during a game....  As Bruce Smith once said in a TV commercial ""Bad, bad things can happen""...now we know what he meant.."
494112,Mike Pike,2010-08-13 15:03:00,1332,Miami Dolphins!  I'm also a fan of the Ti-Cats and Maple Leafs.  Anyone see the trend here...

Not I though, superbowl rings or not....that team brought about an amazing AMAZING era to this town.  I was at the game when the crowd rushed the field and the goal posts came down. It was surreal (disclaimer, i do not condone it) but i was forced to go on the field being in the first couple rows of the endzone. My other option was to get crushed by 80,000 plus lol.  It'll never happen again, we may win again someday. But never will i have the feeling back of those years with that team. They were a family to this city. DO you remember a nightclub called ""Network"" downtown Billybob? We used to hang out there every weekend and see them all come thru walking to the V.I.P. room talking to fans along the way. Just a really unorthodox group of guys in comparison to todays athletes that felt so tight knit and in tune with the city and it gives me chills to sit here (as i just did) and look back on it all via Youtube. I couldnt even imagine winning with any other team, and having it feel the same. Go watch some youtube from those years Billy bob and get all them chills back!!!!  I hang my head for NO-ONE during those superbowl losses, and feel blessed to have lived through that era of Buffalo history"
