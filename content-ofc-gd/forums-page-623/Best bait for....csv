510170,GBW,2010-10-07 21:49:00,8460,"you can catch walleye, perch, musky, pike, and bass on one lure.  A darter jighead with a 3 or 4"" grub.  I say this because I have gotten all but pike with this.  never tried it though for a pike but I might next time I fish waters with them.  cast out, let it start to sink and reel in...  just change how you reel it in from time to time, IE swim it back while raising and then lowering the rod tip."

510617,Garry2Rs,2010-10-09 17:11:00,1425,"This question is way to broad. Are you fishing from shore, wading or using a boat?  What season?  How is the water clarity?  Rocks or weeds?  Moving of still water?   If I could only have one bait for each species, this is what I would choose.   Musky - Black and Orange or plain Black Bucktail in-line Spinner, or Bucktail Spinnerbait.  Bass - Watermelon-Green or Rootbeer-Brown Senko style worm.  Panfish - Trout or Crappie Magnet Grub and Jig in Chartreuse or Dude Special. Click Here Garry2R's"

510673,timmeh,2010-10-09 22:27:00,609,"The thing is there is no universal best bait. If there was everyone would only be using it instead of having a tackle box full of lures. Depth, water temp, turbidity, current, weather conditions, natural food sources and many other factors determine the best baits for whatever particular situation you're fishing. I know you're looking for easy answers on here, but they don't always exist."

510768,sauce,2010-10-10 05:20:00,219,"I disagree with kinger. Xr8's are for small fish. Try Xr10 in perch or yellow perch. Haven't caught trout on one yet. But that's cuz I've never tried one in ""trout"" waters."
