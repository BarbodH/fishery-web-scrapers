510387,Lunker777,2010-10-08 16:45:00,866,Hey everyone  I really like the pricepoint on the St.Croix mojo bass rods... I can pick up a skeet reese/Curado E5 combo for $250 plus tax. but I dont know about the Skeet rods... read some bad reviews on the BPS web site  mojo bass and the skeet rods are with in $10 of each other... so its kind of a toss up  Any body using these rods ? used both ? any comparisons ?  Thanks !

510482,Pigeontroller,2010-10-08 22:23:00,2793,Go with the St.Croix
510529,Toddyc20,2010-10-09 00:47:00,141,From what I've heard you can't go wrong with the Mojo Bass.  All around good rods at a very reasonable price.
510532,bare foot wader,2010-10-09 00:58:00,1354,"mojo...w&m is not known for quality, especially in my experience...and st. croix is a better rod IMO and has better warranty"
510533,zeeter,2010-10-09 00:59:00,92,MOJO.  Tough to beat at that price.
510537,aniceguy,2010-10-09 01:23:00,1094,"I picked up a mojo last week, for the price a very decent stick..."
510539,Fang,2010-10-09 01:25:00,1330,"Bought my first mojo this summer and was very impressed. Picked up a 6'8"" spinning. Will look at their heavy action next season as my 7' pitching rod needs upgrading"
510549,uglyfish,2010-10-09 02:44:00,981,"i used the mojo rods all of last year before switching to a new sponsor rod company. the mojo's are excellant rods, i had 4 or 5 of them, and still have one that i use from time to time."
510817,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-10 15:34:00,0,Was looking at the mojo's yesterday at BPS. Gotta see how much Lebaron sells them for but its a decent rod. Any of you have an extra one to sell in the Toronto Area? MH F to XF 6'10 or longer one piece?
510829,ADB,2010-10-10 16:34:00,444," Unfortunately, Le Baron doesn't carry St. Croix."
510832,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-10 16:52:00,3761,The Skeet Reese rods are good rods aswell but they also offer a Lifetime Warranty rather than the 5yr that the Mojo series has.  I would buy the Skeet Reese rods rather than the mojo's.
