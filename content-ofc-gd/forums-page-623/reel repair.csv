I will give as much help as I can, since I've never heard of or seen that reel.  1 - Post a photo of the spring, more likely there are other reels that use the same one.  2 - Long shot, but..... Call Aikman's Repairs @ 905.277.3595, he might have parts for uncommon reels, Worth a shot.  Hope this helps."
