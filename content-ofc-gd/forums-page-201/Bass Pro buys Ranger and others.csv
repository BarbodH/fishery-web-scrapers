886117,HTHM,2014-12-12 03:11:00,4082,"http://www.muskyhunter.com/musky-matters/bass-pro-shops-buys-ranger-stratos-triton-boat-brands/  SPRINGFIELD, MO – Bass Pro Group announced today an agreement to acquire Fishing Holdings, LLC, a manufacturer of fishing boats that include Ranger Boats and the Stratos and Triton boat brands from Platinum Equity. The agreement combines popular fishing boat brands that are recognized internationally. It also creates another connection between two industry leaders, Bass Pro Shops founder/CEO Johnny Morris and Ranger Boats founder Forrest Wood, who are dedicated fishermen, conservationists and entrepreneurs. Years ago the iconic outdoorsmen both began fishing on the White River and White River Chain of Lakes in the Ozarks and even fished together in the first National BASS Tournaments. “This partnership brings added long-term stability for both companies and for the dealer networks that provide customers with quality boats at exceptional values,” said Morris, who also is founder/CEO of Tracker Marine Group. “I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Forrest Wood many years, and I deeply respect him and his family that founded and built a solid performing business with excellent products.” Morris added that: “It’s also important that our companies share comparable cultures and values and are dedicated to manufacturing quality products in the USA.” Following the closing of the transaction, Fishing Holdings will continue operating independently under its existing management at its headquarters in Flippin, Ark., located a two-hour drive from Bass Pro Shops headquarters in Springfield. “We are impressed with the company’s leadership team and performance and look forward to welcoming them to the Bass Pro Shops family,” said Morris. “We are fortunate to partner with Bass Pro Group, which understands the industry and our brands,” said Fishing Holdings President Randy Hopper. “This new alliance will provide synergies that will strengthen our independent dealer base and ensure our continued focus on fishing.” Having grown the business since its origins, Wood also praised the transaction. “I’m excited for Ranger and the team at Fishing Holdings,” he said. “Johnny’s organization is deeply rooted in fishing and dedicated to conservation. He’s made a huge contribution to our sport, and I believe this is a real opportunity to better serve so many dealers and loyal customers around the country.” Both Morris and Wood have for many years generously donated their time and financial resources to support conservation efforts that help ensure a future for fishing by future generations. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Financial terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed."

886175,BillM,2014-12-12 14:51:00,17367,"You don't buy a brand like Ranger, then go changing everything.  If they were smart (and I'm sure they are), this will be nothing more then changes on paper."
886179,manitoubass2,2014-12-12 15:11:00,11391,I thought almost erbody hated Ranger boats?  oh well good deal I suppose for all these millionares
886192,Fang,2014-12-12 16:48:00,1330,I think it's more about controlling distribution. Existing Ranger dealers may be ones with the most concern
886199,mattaw,2014-12-12 17:46:00,162,"Interesting to see how it shakes out. It will either be par the course, or very bad, and brands like Basscat will see a bump in sales. I feel for the dealers if anything changes though."
886210,Fish Farmer,2014-12-12 18:44:00,2234,"Here comes a Ranger, Just crackerin along"
886227,fish_fishburn,2014-12-12 20:47:00,1311,I doubt there will be any changes. Maybe Stratos might be gone. I bet all the Ranger Pros who have slagged Nitro publicly are crapping in there pants right about now lol.
886362,hirk,2014-12-13 13:04:00,571,"  Funny stuff, sadly a good part of this is true lol  "
886385,KraTToR,2014-12-13 16:00:00,506,Glad I own a Larson!  
886386,kickingfrog,2014-12-13 16:07:00,8333,I thought almost erbody hated Ranger boats?  oh well good deal I suppose for all these millionares  I think it's BPS brand tracker that has a bad rap.
886407,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-13 17:37:00,8243,"When Harley Davidson was bought out by AMF, 1967 to 1981, famous for their bowling machines they also weren't going to change anything and they almost deep sixed HD because they were making garbage trying to keep up with the Japanese machines. I think Stratos and Triton will go the way of Pontiac and Oldsmobile."
886409,Dan668,2014-12-13 17:44:00,1120,Nothing will change.  Still operating independently
886418,manitoubass2,2014-12-13 18:28:00,11391,oh yep I think your correct
886453,aplumma,2014-12-13 22:01:00,6896,I personally love the way my 1989 Ranger runs. I spent a lot of money restoring it because it has the hull design that I found both fast and stable. With the acquisition it might mean more R and D to bring more improvements to an already great product.   Art
886525,craigdritchie,2014-12-14 15:21:00,1586,"Nothing changed when they bought Mako, and that was what, 10 or 12 years ago?  So why would anything change for Ranger and Stratos?"
886527,Steve,2014-12-14 15:30:00,2075,"because bps knows they can't make a mako boat....but they THINK they can make a freshwater boat....just look at cracker and nitro...  but like cracker and nitro, they actually can't make a fresh water boat....  so I have a feeling, unlike mako, this will get changed.....  like SO many things out there, folks will start looking for a ""pre"" BPS ranger...and these will be come valuable."
886645,ONbuckhunter,2014-12-14 23:54:00,39,I really hope they don't cheap out the Ranger.  Once you own one you can't go back.  I guess if they do change them the value of the used Rangers will go even higher.
886786,hookerdown,2014-12-15 16:55:00,110,"All I have to say is, TURN OFF THE LIGHTS THE PARTY IS OVER!!!"
886808,Dan668,2014-12-15 18:47:00,1120,"Right from the article,  ""Following the closing of the transaction, Fishing Holdings will continue operating independently under its existing management at its headquarters in Flippin, Ark., a two-hour drive from Bass Pro Shops headquarters in Springfield.""  It be stupid to change. Their just holding for control.  Not sure about their tracker line or ""cracker""  but for the price their newer nitros are pretty nice. Ive rid in the z8/z9, i was surprised."
