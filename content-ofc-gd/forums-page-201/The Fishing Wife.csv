886079,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-11 23:19:00,81,"My wife says that during ice fishing season, I don't pay attention to her. At least I think that's what she said."
886083,misfish,2014-12-11 23:34:00,29133,"LOL  Mine says, have a nice day,be safe.  Then again,after being together for more then 36 yrs,shes use to me fishing,hunting and golfing.  Not to worry though. She knows I take care of her with dinners out and washing her car."
886086,bigugli,2014-12-11 23:41:00,6138,Mine can't wait to get me out of the house. I drive her nuts when I gets restless.
886093,Joey,2014-12-12 00:17:00,9122,"I say let's go, gotta get me a laker"
886094,misfish,2014-12-12 00:34:00,29133,"Paul sure knew that you were a keeper,not a releaser."
886096,Joey,2014-12-12 00:43:00,9122,"Paul sure knew that you were a keeper,not a releaser.  Actually he said to me I think the second year we were together, what do you want to do for your birthday and I say, I want to go fishing, so we went to his parent's cottage in Minden and took the canoe out and caught some bass, then bought the tinny, then the Tracker, then the Lund, so it's all my fault"
886098,Whopper,2014-12-12 00:55:00,2174,"Not to sound sexist but beside Joey, Graftongal are as hardcore as they get for fisher women. I've seen both in action and it was a real treat."
886099,Joey,2014-12-12 01:08:00,9122,"Not to sound sexist but beside Joey, Graftongal are as hardcore as they get for fisher women. I've seen both in action and it was a real treat.   not sexist at all, thanks for the compliment"

886101,grt1,2014-12-12 01:14:00,638,"my wife loves to fish, just not first thing in the morning, or when it's rough."
886102,Joey,2014-12-12 01:18:00,9122,"No, I'm not a morning person either.  Paul calls us the crack of noon fishermen  But I will get up early for ice fishing, otherwise, you can't find a parking spot !!  And honestly, I've caught my biggest fish in the afternoon, so..........."
886106,Rizzo,2014-12-12 01:37:00,4754,My wife fished with me until we got married...the fishing then abruptly ended
886107,James77,2014-12-12 01:40:00,175,My girlfriend enjoys suntanning while I fish
886140,Freshtrax,2014-12-12 07:03:00,2215,"Mine likes the boat on flat days,   She hates the ice, won't come out till there's a foot of it.   But most of all she is understanding when I get manic before a big trip."
886164,Sinker,2014-12-12 14:09:00,8692,My GF begs me to take her. Sometimes I don't even want to go......she kicks my ass most times too! I use fishing as a leverage tool with her haha. I'll take you fishing if you do_________......LOL  S.
886166,Fish Farmer,2014-12-12 14:14:00,2234, Not to worry though. She knows I take care of her with dinners out and washing her car. Suck Hole Hope my wife don't read your post Yous givens us mens a bads name homer
886178,manitoubass2,2014-12-12 15:04:00,11391,"I love the outdoors and my better half hates it. Ive gotten her to shore fish once, and the only time she ever gets in the boat is every other year for camping, and she hates camping too!  but my kids love it so she never minds when we are out and about.  in the winter though she beads and I make harnesses, and we sit and chat and do it for hours most evenings.?"
886180,Acountdeleted,2014-12-12 15:15:00,2562,My girlfriend really surprised me this summer. I knew she liked fishing but I didn't know just how much. After having a brutal Saturday of fishing on Presquille bay and her getting a bad sunburn I felt horrible so I said 'Sunday we can do whatever you want'  She responded with 'Today's fishing was really bad. Let's head out to one of our hot spots tomorrow' I was so surprised and happy.
