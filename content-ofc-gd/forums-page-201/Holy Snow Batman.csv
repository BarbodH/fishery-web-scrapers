886074,kickingfrog,2014-12-11 23:04:00,8333,Side benefit of it getting dark early... can't see the snow.
886141,Joeytier,2014-12-12 10:14:00,3990,I went for a nice sled ride down hwy 63...conditions were great!
886142,Big Cliff,2014-12-12 10:43:00,6899,"Was on the road at 7 am, didn't get back to the yard until 10 pm. Lindsay to Scarborough to Cambridge to Tottenham to Beaverton and back to Lindsay.  Best area was Cambridge, just a light trace, worst was Tottenham snow was deep enough there were several trucks stuck in the middle of Industrial drive. I didn't get out to measure it but I'd guess a good 15 - 18""."
886145,Fisherpete,2014-12-12 11:31:00,1814,"My commute is usually 45 minutes, yesterday morning it took 4.5hrs. 3hrs to get home in the afternoon. Grrrrrrr.

886163,Fish Farmer,2014-12-12 14:09:00,2234,"The good news - gas in Whitby at Petro Canada stations is 93.9!!! See how they got us thinking that $4.50 a gallon is a good deal. Back when it went to a $1.00 a litre, people were going to block the hyway."
885955,Joey,2014-12-11 11:25:00,9122,"Must have got 6 to 8 inches overnight.   Between Paul and the dog snoring and farting and the snow plows, I'm up now  Bet the snow plow guys are in heaven   Me, not so much hahahahahaha!"

885976,Beans,2014-12-11 14:56:00,3339,"Looks like we're are right on the edge of the system here, about 2"" on the ground and still snowing light...   Same here up ""Caygeon way...I hope it is the same south of here...I gotta go to P'Boro for a BCG treatment at the hospital tis afternoon..."
885991,c10,2014-12-11 16:04:00,131,"not much snow on the ground in K.W, its just blowing everywhere,     as long as there's ice forming I suppose lol"

885999,bigugli,2014-12-11 16:59:00,6138,"Got about 6"" so far.  perfect day for painting and tying bucktail jigs."
886009,mattybculp,2014-12-11 17:47:00,388,"Well the weather network dropped the ball on this one, saying we were to get 5cm of snow. 15 cm later and its still coming down. That being said I got a new to me snow blower and I'm pretty excited about using it tonight !"
886013,Joey,2014-12-11 18:33:00,9122,Still snowing here!!!!!!
886014,BillM,2014-12-11 18:33:00,17367,"Yup, not stopping up here.  I'm not complaining, the snowys love this weather!"
886017,Sinker,2014-12-11 18:39:00,8692,"We have maybe 8"" here. I'm kind of in a snow belt too. I would think a lot of the snow I'm getting is coming off lake simcoe.  Beans, I'm just south of PTBO. Sounds like we have more than you. Drive safe!  S."
886023,kickingfrog,2014-12-11 19:29:00,8333,10-12 inches here so far.  
886024,4x4bassin,2014-12-11 19:31:00,1025,"We are getting buried here ( Mansfield ) at least 12"" and its still coming down really hard . I think this storm is picking up some strength and moisture off of G Bay and dumping it on us here . Wasaga Beach area straight down to highway 89  is getting pounded with snow and of course I'm in the middle of it , no worry . Day off !!!"
886038,Beans,2014-12-11 21:11:00,3339,Thanks Shane...  It was a slow drive to P'Boro...Curve lake Road (for gas @ $0.93.9) and Selwin Road were plowed and driving on Chemong Road you could actually see the pavement in the car tracks...36 and 23 had been well salted and sanded...
886044,irishfield,2014-12-11 21:52:00,26272,Haven't even bothered starting the plow truck... there's no point! I've shovelled the doors and walks 5 times since noon though. Looks like 4 or 5 hours in the plow truck come morning...  Radar forecast doesn't look bad after 7pm... but considering the wind just changed to out of the N/West I'm not gonna have much faith in that with a wide open lake.  Hey it's Canada...
886061,Joey,2014-12-11 22:18:00,9122,"Well how many inches do you think this is?  IMG_3337 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr"
886062,BillM,2014-12-11 22:19:00,17367,8-10 would be my guess.
886063,Joey,2014-12-11 22:22:00,9122,"On that little table I'd say 12"".  I'll have to go measure"
