883953,GBW,2014-11-29 16:21:00,8460,"So now that my kids have asked for all new ice fishing gear this year and really want to get out I know I need a new pop up hut.  Shopping online I see a good deal at Costco for a Fish Inn 4-6 person ($300).  I also like the Clam Big Foot XL2000 ($330 at Sail) because it's has less sides to pop open.  But it is smaller on the inside.  If I can get my hands on any others of this quality and size for less I'm open.  Feedback please, thanks in advance."
883967,misfish,2014-11-29 17:06:00,29133,"I knew I should of taken pics of the one at Cabelas today. Their band name, ice team one is huge. 6x6x6. Think it was in the 300 range. That Clam Big foot is real nice."
884016,GBW,2014-11-29 22:36:00,8460,decided on the Clam Bigfoot XL2000 as it's 20% off at Sail right now and I get to hang out with Jackie for a bit tomorrow too!
885687,2jack2,2014-12-09 21:37:00,92,Good to see you Jeff.
885745,Moosebunk,2014-12-10 01:41:00,3970,I think ya made a good choice Jeff.
885844,mike rousseau,2014-12-10 17:35:00,4661,"Bring lots of pegs and rope for tying out the sides...  I had that hut and the wind picked up one day... One of the walls ""popped"" back in and the hub hit my buddy between the eyes... Nearly knocked him out...  He had to hold the walls out by hand until the storm passed...  A little parachute cord and a few extra pegs were a life saver..."
885845,mike rousseau,2014-12-10 17:35:00,4661,That hut is very roomy tho....
885852,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-10 18:24:00,956,Thanks for reminding me Mike Rousseau about the pegs.  Forgot to pick up a few for this upcoming ice fishing season.  If theres a heavy windy it could be a short day if I don't have enough of them.

885879,misfish,2014-12-10 21:35:00,29133,"If it,s that windy,forgetaboutit."
885883,irishfield,2014-12-10 21:53:00,26272,Lexxington is the king of pop up anchoring !!

885921,123chadder,2014-12-11 01:30:00,165,"go to kijiji get a used pop up for much cheaper,there are lots to choose from.i had a 4 man eskimo and it was 7x7 on the inside....but setting up alone in the wind can be a whine!"
885952,mike rousseau,2014-12-11 06:18:00,4661,Yup  Used my Bigfoot once then sold it...
885993,c10,2014-12-11 16:15:00,131,"I don't know what the quality of Costco's Fish Inn hut is, but if you want one that you can return unconditionally then that's probably the place to go! lmao I have seen some people bring back some crazy stuff when I worked there, overcooked steak without any sort of seasoning, one piece of apple pie, worn out shoes... all taken back for at least partial discounts lolbut Sail is really good as well so maybe this is just a moot point... sorry! lol"
886123,GBW,2014-12-12 03:48:00,8460,"It's all good all.  I know what a pop up is like in the wind considering a had a 'hybrid' of that with a Clam 2000 (hard base fold up) and have had that move like a kite and I have used other pop up's a bunch of times in the recent past with others.  When the ice is thick enough and the Ram and I can get out that's the primary anchor and wind block for the XL2000.  My initial question was for cost, ease of use and quality.  The XL2000 is exactly what I was after from a quality, price and weight (if needed to carry or drag in a sled) point of view.  The best part of the transaction was when I walked into Sail and said ""Hey Jackie"" and he said ""Hey Geoff great to see you again"".  That's customer service on top of a great product and a great deal..."
886124,Moosebunk,2014-12-12 03:53:00,3970,Lexxington is the king of pop up anchoring !!  Did I not just sit outside and fish that day? lol.
886126,GBW,2014-12-12 03:55:00,8460,Now that doesn't make you the king of pop-up-anchoring now does it Bunk...   HA!
886129,irishfield,2014-12-12 03:57:00,26272,That was last year Drew.. not the year before. Wind was a good 70K  and we were set up right in the middle of the NE Arm..
886153,BillM,2014-12-12 13:07:00,17367,70k winds?  I'll stay in bed.
