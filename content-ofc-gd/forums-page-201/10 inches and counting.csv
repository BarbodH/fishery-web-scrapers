886007,captpierre,2014-12-11 17:29:00,2521,Forecast was for about 10 cm here in Stouffville.  Weatherman just as bad in winter as he is in summers it seems.  Stay out of the ditch Peter
886032,Salmonidstalker,2014-12-11 20:41:00,265,Storms can dissipate and intensify.  Don't give the weather people a hard time.  If you understand weather It's very difficult to predict exact forecasts lol.  Enjoy the snow!
