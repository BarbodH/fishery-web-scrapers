By kid-friendly, I mean ideally they transport you to and from the hut in some sort of covered or heated sled, maintain good huts, and have a good reputation overall.  I'm not picky.  Perch or whitefish/trout would be fun.  He'd probably prefer perch I suppose.  Any suggestions? Thanks  "

He puts you on top of more perch you could ever want, drives you out in a concealed sled and gives you an abundance of minnows. And if you need to head in early, you just give him a ring and he's out in 15 minutes.  Your son will love it."

886687,fishnguy,2014-12-15 01:29:00,96,AWESOME!  Thanks guys!
886706,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-15 03:09:00,956,Before I bought my tent I went through a guy named Peter.  He's got his own website and forum (Cooks Bay Fishing Forum). His number is 7054560000.  Call him or Terry to see who's cheaper.  I take my niece and nephew on cooks bay and they loved it every year.  Perch action all day bud.

886744,fishnguy,2014-12-15 13:42:00,96,Thanks all around.
886748,Mike Pike,2014-12-15 13:54:00,1332,"Ya, I second Terry Goy out of Gilford.  He's a great Op and is usually on fish, so the kids will be kept busy.  On the other side of the lake, Floyd Hale out of Beaverton has a great operation going, with burner elements in his huts, so you can cook up your catch right there if you're so inclinde.  Have fun!"

886798,Beans,2014-12-15 18:05:00,3339,"Jerry of Pefferlaw Fish Huts down at the bottom of Holmes Point Road (where the motel is)...nice dining room for breakfast, Jerry would bring us out great hamburgers and pop for lunch and check up on us to see if we were on fish...depending on how busy he was, he would move us to another hut if we weren't catching..."
887271,Sinker,2014-12-17 14:07:00,8692,"This..^...he even has covers for his holes, with smaller 8"" holes cut out so the kids don't fall through. Great guy, great equipment, and the perchin is usually good too.  S."
