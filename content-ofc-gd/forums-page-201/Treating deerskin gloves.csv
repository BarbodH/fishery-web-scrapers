886530,Burtess,2014-12-14 15:47:00,901,"I just picked up a  pair of WindRiver (Marks Work Wearhouse) mitts and they have deerskin leather on the palms.  I did some google searching and people seem to put everything on them, and also say not to put everything on them.  What have you used to treat deerskin that has worked in the past?  In house I have various silicone sprays (Tana All-Protector, Pro-Tex Water and Stain Protector) and my boot stuff  (Mink Oil, Dubbin....).  Burt"
886696,backbay,2014-12-15 02:01:00,773,"I only use sprays on synthetics, as I've found they tend to dry out leather. I'd opt for the Dubbin, myself...."
886712,i2cool2fool,2014-12-15 03:46:00,349,I have been using the same gloves from Marks forever. I don't put anything on them and easily get 5+ years from a pair.
886713,Freshtrax,2014-12-15 04:13:00,2215,Haven't had a pair side I was a kid but if I remember correctly we put mink oil on our deerskin gloves.
886715,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-15 04:32:00,10439,Pureed kitten works the best. Actually I use nothing on mine either.
886878,aplumma,2014-12-16 00:24:00,6896,I keep mine without any treatment so when I rub my eyes they don't burn.   Art
886881,misfish,2014-12-16 00:27:00,29133,I keep mine without any treatment so when I rub my eyes they don't burn.   Art  I wonder how the deer do it?
886885,irishfield,2014-12-16 00:43:00,26272,They don't rub their eyes either Brian !
886886,misfish,2014-12-16 00:49:00,29133,They don't rub their eyes either Brian !  LOL
886891,Burtess,2014-12-16 01:30:00,901,Lol....  I think for the first couple wears I will leave them as is and see how slimy they get (I always remember wet deerskin feeling gross when it gets soaked).  Burt
