887124,John Bacon,2014-12-16 23:38:00,3277,I found a few links with some more detailed maps of the zones.  These maps provide better detail than the regulation summary.  They may be helpful when fishing near the border between two zones.  https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/fisheries-management-zone-20-fmz-20  https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/fisheries-management-zone-17-fmz-17  
887125,misfish,2014-12-16 23:45:00,29133,Have you come across anything that indicates  they are going to open the herring on lake Simcoe?
887159,BillM,2014-12-17 01:52:00,17367,"Brian, it's only been proposed so far..  Maybe next year?  http://www.afs-oc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Proposed-Changes-to-Cisco-Fishing-Regulations-in-Lake-Simcoe-English.pdf"
887161,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-17 01:59:00,956,I fish Upper Niagara and was wondering if anyone has heard of anyone getting in crap for fishing on the American side.  I've drifted over there and I think I have even caught a musky over there too.

887166,irishfield,2014-12-17 02:29:00,26272,... or a passport in your pocket...
887167,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-17 02:31:00,956,Throwing my passport in my tackle box I'm sure wont hurt lol.
887177,BillM,2014-12-17 03:00:00,17367,NYS license went down to $50 for the year for a non-resident.  Much cheaper then fishing without a valid license    You should pick one up if you fish the Niagara that much.
887181,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-17 03:06:00,956,"Wow Bill that's expensive.  I only wonder if the American Boarder Patrol officers would be pricks and fine you for fishing on there side with not having any fish in the boat.  I would think they would give you a warning and tell you to stay on your side, but I might be wrong."
887192,BillM,2014-12-17 03:21:00,17367,Expensive?  It used to be $70.   You can't fish in US waters without a US license.  The fine would be much more then $50.
887232,mike rousseau,2014-12-17 06:16:00,4661,I was glad to see the cost drop as well...
887233,mike rousseau,2014-12-17 06:22:00,4661,If the fishing isn't worth the $50 don't fish there... Otherwise put your money in like everyone else that doesn't want to be a stinking poacher...  As someone that has to buy 4... That's right 4 licenses to fish my home waterbody I can't understand people complaining about buying 2...
