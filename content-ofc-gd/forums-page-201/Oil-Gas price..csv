887057,Mister G,2014-12-16 18:09:00,1429," Because it's winter and the demand is high for home heating oil (which is diesel)  If this happened in June/July, diesel would be lower then the price of regular right now. I don't think so. Diesel fuel in the states has dropped by 70 cents while gas has dropped there by about 80-90 cents."
887059,Mister G,2014-12-16 18:18:00,1429,These low gas prices will continue for some time into the future as long as the Arabs are trying to break the Americans from using fracking methods of obtaining oil. I don't see anything in the future that will be changing this. ENJOY the drop in oil / gas prices and it will continue throughout this year or more.
887060,BillM,2014-12-16 18:20:00,17367,"I don't think so. Diesel fuel in the states has dropped by 70 cents while gas has dropped there by about 80-90 cents.  So you're saying diesel is still more expensive in the winter then gas is in the US?   Thanks for proving my point.  Diesel is always cheaper in the summer time compared to regular.  If you owned a diesel vehicle, you'd realize this."
887061,Mister G,2014-12-16 18:22:00,1429," So you're saying diesel is still more expensive in the winter then gas is in the US?   Thanks for proving my point.  Diesel is always cheaper in the summer time compared to regular.  If you owned a diesel vehicle, you'd realize this. In the US diesel is ALWAYS more expensive.......that was my point."
887062,BillM,2014-12-16 18:23:00,17367,"In the US diesel is ALWAYS more expensive.......that was my point.  Who's talking about the price of US diesel?  What country do we live in?  So you're agreeing with me that diesel, in Canada, in the summertime is usually less then regular?  I wanna make sure we're on the same page here (And referring to the same country)  The price of diesel in the US doesn't impact me, the price here does."
887065,Mister G,2014-12-16 18:26:00,1429,Sorry but I'm 100% right.......Diesel fuel in the states have been on average 40-50 cents more ALL YEAR LONG.
887066,aplumma,2014-12-16 18:27:00,6896,Gas 2.45 a gallon and Diesel always 70-85 cents a gallon more. The split last year was only 40 cents. The funny thing is all of my oil stocks are showing a profit and dividends are averaging 3 to 4 % whoo hoooo. So if you use 10 thousand dollars of fuel and you own 40 thousand dollars of their stock you will be getting fuel at a discount of 16 percent. With the banks paying one fishing lure per 10 years guess which one is better.  Disclaimer This is not advise on how to grow your future what worked for me might be bad for you.    Art
887068,BillM,2014-12-16 18:29:00,17367,"Sorry but I'm 100% right.......Diesel fuel in the states have been on average 40-50 cents more ALL YEAR LONG.  Again, why are you referring to the US when I'm clearing talking about prices in Canada?   If diesel is more expensive in the US all year then great, but why would you think I care?"
887069,Terry,2014-12-16 18:31:00,14456,"but as Bill said here in Canada diesel is always cheaper then gas in the summer and more in the winter, as stated they blame the demand on heating oil"
887071,Whopper,2014-12-16 18:35:00,2174,"Diesel here is always higher than regular unleaded gas no matter what time of year.  Since the freefall started regular unleaded gas has dropped $1.70 a gallon, diesel on the other hand has dropped 50 to 60 cents a gallon.  It's been good on the wallet lately, maybe not so much for people invested in energy funds."

887076,jimmer,2014-12-16 18:41:00,2730,"I don't feel that we can necessarily get too comfortable with the low prices here in Ontario, the carbon tax is looming like a dark cloud."
887090,Whopper,2014-12-16 19:21:00,2174,"BillM you are correct.  The past two years gas has been about the same price when we've made our annual trek to NWO at the end of May. Two years ago I bought a half tank of gas in the Vermilion Bay area for my truck and it cost me $92, our money was par with yours. I just filled up on Monday on my way to work, had about a 1/4 of a tank or so left, filled up at todays prices was $50.00 total."
887091,BillM,2014-12-16 19:23:00,17367,Can't complain about that!

When I first started driving tractor trailers some of them had gas engines, at least short haul local pick up and delivery ones, and almost all straight trucks had gas engines. That picture has changed dramatically, even UPS's little brown delivery trucks are diesel powered.  Diesel gets better mileage, so you pay more for it?"
887093,bow slayer,2014-12-16 19:32:00,1074,regular gas is 89.7 everywhere in London and premium is 102.7  .....regular is as low as 85.9 on the reserve
886937,limeyangler,2014-12-16 05:49:00,5204,"Nice to see cheaper prices at the pumps.A barrel of oil is trading at half the cost  than it was a year ago, gas is cheaper, but not half price. Wont be long before they have to claw back the lost revenue from somewhere."
886938,Roy,2014-12-16 05:56:00,13728,"I'm not too worried Simon. I have an account with $10,000. in it, and that account earns me $0.07 (7 cents) a month.  I can get a free lure every 10 years! wooooooohoooooooooo!   Edited to add: But I understand your comment and yes, you're right, there will be consequences."
886939,Woodsman,2014-12-16 06:26:00,1286,That being said I'm not saying we are not being shafted just theres more to the equation than the cost of crude.
886949,G.mech,2014-12-16 11:23:00,830,"And it will never be as the cost of crude is only one factor. Costs of refining,transportation and sales have not dropped in half. That being said I'm not saying we are not being shafted just theres more to the equation than the cost of crude. Not to mention, the taxes....another huge factor in the price at the pumps and most are on a fixed cost per litre basis and not a percentage.  If the cost of the gas was zero we'd still be paying almost $0.30/litre at the pumps....."

Our gas ships with a  Manitoba company. So west to east. So usually you see steady increase in the price the further from Winnipeg you go, which would make sense since it costs more to ship further, prices top out at Terrace Bay on Superior. So how comes the price in Kenora which is west of us is staying a stubborn 7c - 10cents higher."
886970,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 13:45:00,956,My TFSA is taking a hit and I'm thinking with gas being down it has something to do with it.

886973,bigbuck,2014-12-16 13:54:00,2449,"Gas is a by product of refining. The refiners do not make a lot of money off it. Diesel and kerosene however, are the major drivers of their profits. Come spring, oil will drop significantly Asthe demand for heating oil eases. The long term forecasts are showing a relatively warm January with daytime highs around -5 or so, that will drive the perceived and real demand for heating oil down. Oil has had its day in the commodity markets, as well as other resources, time for the next hot thing for 10 years. That my friends, I cannot tell you as my crystal ball is cracked and the future is cloudy....."
886978,Raf,2014-12-16 14:17:00,3495,"Bill I think that's bunk (sorry Drew).  Yes, diesel is cheaper than gas in the summer and more than gas in winter for the reason above, but you're looking at maybe 5 cents either way.  If gas is 97 / liter, I would expect diesel to be around 1.00 - 1.05 right now yet it's at 1.16 - 1.18 around me.  We've been told that the gas drop is due to low demand for oil, so which is it?  high demand for heating oil or low demand for oil?  LOL"
886980,mattybculp,2014-12-16 14:24:00,388,"I was going to start a topic this morning asking how much you guys/gals were paying at the pump, not to hi-jack the op, but I filled up on the reserve today for 90.7 c/L. I know its a far cry from where it should be but its saving me about 12 bucks every time I fill up, which is nice for a change. Its crazy to know how quickly it will jump back to $1.30/L"
886981,Fish Farmer,2014-12-16 14:26:00,2234,"Funny when the price of gas was going up they told us it was because of oil prices. Gets me how we are brain washed Litre and Gallons. $1.00 Litre, $1.00 Gallon And they got us thinking were getting a deal, the 99 cent thing. Did I ever tell you guys I have 1 lure that is guaranteed to catch fish every time it hits the water."
886982,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-16 14:29:00,2582,After driving  diesel golfs for 27 years I gave up a long time ago trying to figure out how they determine diesel pricing. I believe that whoever is in charge throws darts at a dartboard and thats the price we get  I also remember when it was always 5-10 cents a litre cheaper then regular.  Now that I no longer have a diesel vehicle I have come to realize that regular gas pricing is determined the same way. Just somebody different throwing the darts.  BTW 89.9 at Costco in Oshawa this morning. I love the guy who's been throwing darts lately...but somehow I think his days are numbered.

LOL   I'm getting diesel for about $1.15 or so, which isn't far off the mark it normally is compared to gas in the winter (Say gas is $0.99 right now)..   It sure beats it being $1.45 like it was last winter."
