886997,Fisherman,2014-12-16 15:06:00,7201,That's just nasty and I would expect there will be some damage to the creek.
887003,Gerritt,2014-12-16 15:22:00,6129,No doubt some damage. And the trucking company should have to pay for the remediation or at the very least thier insurance company.  G
887034,Garnet,2014-12-16 17:08:00,2056,The Detox depot is about 2 miles from the crash site and they have 2 big vac trucks near the creek. The tanker is back on the road but it will need a float to haul it away.  Still heavy diesel smell in area.
887086,moxie,2014-12-16 18:58:00,1566,Unreal how these things almost always seem to happen in the worst possible places. Also cannot understand how any heavy truck is allowed to tow two trailers instead of one given the amount of accidents involving big rigs these days. As far as the driver goes I hope hes alright and if this was just plain ole driver error someone should kick his ass repeatedly with a heavy boot until his ass just simply falls off.
