Now she's mid term with the second one and the little guy is a 19 month old eating machine. Between this and prices rising in the last couple years I have just given up on caring how much groceries cost and just hand over the card. It's even more expensive when you're choosing healthier options.  I plan on getting back into breeding rabbits for meat as they're cheaper to raise and healthier to eat when compared to chickens. At 8 weeks they'll already weigh 3.5 - 4 lbs each and the meat can be used in any dish calling for chicken and they almost taste the exact same.

I eat that much taste testing. I don't know how a family with kids can even afford medium ground beef today buying from the grocery store. Last week whole chickens on at $1.99, bought 10. Once and a while pork loin on at $1.99, bought as many as they had in the display and waited for the butcher to package 5 more. Cut them in 3 pound pieces. When they have eye of the round on sale buy them all, add some fat I get from the butcher and make ground beef. The boys and I are splitting on a 1/2 beef next week from a local guy. Who can afford food today, veggies ain't cheap either. $3.99 for Red Peepers, anything imported is nuts, come on man. 4 bucks for rye bread??? I told my wife last month if this keeps up we will be skinny soon.  Just today a local farmer told us they are concerned with cattle rustlers believe me or not.

I can hear it now, "" Your Honor the accused was in possession of a pig with the intent to traffic"".  we use Ontario FFNR (Farm Fresh, Naturally Raised) pork butts for our sausages, we don't sell side ribs at all, not a big enough market for them, people would much rather have the nice back ribs"

I understand why the costs go up, but they are all gong to put themselves out of business if you ask me."
886217,mr blizzard,2014-12-12 19:21:00,1589,"Thanks guys They are called country style loin ribs, not made spaecial by the butcher just plain old ribs on the shelf wrapped in styrofoam and shrink wrap  We used to go half and half on a cow with my brother back when we were in Barrie  Just one problem there are no farms up here lol  Thank God we have whities and lakers though, I think I will go and fire up the ice auger  Cheers Blizz"
886229,irishfield,2014-12-12 21:00:00,26272,Probably has more to do with the massive die off of pigglets from the virus going around.. than the price of feed.

886269,G.mech,2014-12-13 00:24:00,830,"Probably has more to do with the massive die off of pigglets from the virus going around.. than the price of feed.  PED has not been a major factor in pork prices and has been basically under control in Canada since early summer.  It had a moderately more significant effect the US but since most (about 60%) of our pork is exported the effect here has been minimal.  The single biggest cost in raising livestock is feed, you cannot discount that.  A not bad summary of the cause and effects:  http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/higher-meat-prices-in-store-for-consumers-1.2750441"
886287,ketchenany,2014-12-13 01:09:00,3229,"yes food prices have gone up, no question. I can see in Yellowknife  prices being higher due to transportation. . . .Fish is a lot better, but down here we get shaft for fish.  Here I can can a difference of a $1 a lb just by going from Fortinos to NoFrills and they are owned by the same company! Something is wrong here, just like gas prices, differ by a wide margin from a one area to another.  We do buy ribs as another member suggested when they are at around $2 a lb.  I've had a good butcher for 46 years and he keeps telling me buy ribeye steaks in the winter!  wonder why?  We are at the mercy of the ""providers"" and they can set prices as they wish as long as it meets their  $ needs."
886290,FloatnFly,2014-12-13 01:15:00,1640,"I am a butcher of 15 years, beef prices have gone nuts due the harsh winter, in combination with the states buying our cattle.  now, that normally wouldn't be an issue, however, farmers have been keeping animals meant for slaughter, as breeding animals, therefore reducing the number of cattle going to market.  for instance, ground beef has gone from 8.77/kg to 12.10/kg  not sure why pork has gone up, but it hasn't gone up too badly, not like the beef, but most suspect the piglet disease, as well as cost of feed.  and f course, chicken farmers seeing that beef and pork have gone up, have also increased their prices to get their'cut' of this crazyness"
886300,Freshtrax,2014-12-13 01:59:00,2215,My uncle had to travel from dunnville to kitchener to find some stockers  to get some beef it's crazy right now.
886303,bigugli,2014-12-13 02:06:00,6138,  And the prices at the St Jakob auction have been a little crazy some days because the numbers of animals are not there.

886311,Freshtrax,2014-12-13 02:26:00,2215,Everybody do yourself a favour and find a local farmer to sell you a side of beef and pork a year.    Support your local farmers . Eat better. And save a ton of cash.   I love eating  prime rib at 4 bucks a pound.
886332,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-13 04:00:00,10439,"Hey, at least the price of gas has dropped a bunch!!! It's cheaper now than when I moved up here 9 years ago."
886334,glen,2014-12-13 04:13:00,2641,I gave up on ribs.  Too much money for the meat you get.   Very limited on chicken wings too.  It was ok when the cheaper cuts were cheaper.
886345,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-13 04:45:00,8243,"When your buying side ribs it's 1/2 bone and gristle, or more, don't buy it. And if any butcher says they throw it out they lie, that's what sausages are made of, sticky pork. Just today I saw a small piece of outside round, not inside, outside, maybe 6"" long, 4"" across and 1/2"" thick. $5.75 at Food Town in Cayuga and we have beef farms this way. WHAT!!!! I eat that much taste testing. I don't know how a family with kids can even afford medium ground beef today buying from the grocery store. Last week whole chickens on at $1.99, bought 10. Once and a while pork loin on at $1.99, bought as many as they had in the display and waited for the butcher to package 5 more. Cut them in 3 pound pieces. When they have eye of the round on sale buy them all, add some fat I get from the butcher and make ground beef. The boys and I are splitting on a 1/2 beef next week from a local guy. Who can afford food today, veggies ain't cheap either. $3.99 for Red Peepers, anything imported is nuts, come on man. 4 bucks for rye bread??? I told my wife last month if this keeps up we will be skinny soon.  Just today a local farmer told us they are concerned with cattle rustlers believe me or not. Think about it, it might be more lucrative than selling dope and legal to have possession. I can hear it now, "" Your Honor the accused was in possession of a pig with the intent to traffic""."
886348,bigugli,2014-12-13 05:21:00,6138,"Livestock theft happens more often than you realize.  One fellow, a few years back, was brazen enough to steal straight from the auction yard.  They finally caught him, but who knows how often he had done it before."
886350,OhioFisherman,2014-12-13 06:39:00,6623,"Here stateside our big cattle states have had drought problems, last year (2013) I guess was especially bad. Feed prices as I recall more than doubled and suitable grazing land was in short supply. There were numerous news reports on farmers selling cattle and hogs early to avoid feed costs and shortages, which also lowers the herd population for the future. Even in my area hay and corn prices as feed more than doubled, an acute shortage of it, it was a very dry summer here also.  Rustlers? I was in Florida for 5 weeks in 2009, there were a number of reports there of horses being butchered in their fields, they said black market horse meat could go for 40 bucks a pound."
886356,misfish,2014-12-13 10:27:00,29133,"I,ll be heading down to my fav store in a hour . I always get my ribs from this place. I,ll let you know what they are charging .  As for those S&S rib cuts,they are way over priced no matter where you buy them."
886358,Mister G,2014-12-13 11:56:00,1429,Winter usually has the highest rib prices for some reason.......seen them for $2.99 per pound and I consider that a bit high.
