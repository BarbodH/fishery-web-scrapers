885135,Dave Jones,2014-12-06 22:31:00,50,Same could be said for all commodities. The guy that put me on to managing my own money converted all of his RRSP's to gold about 12 years ago. He dumped all of his gold about 2 years ago and is now happily retired.
885136,Dave Jones,2014-12-06 22:36:00,50,Garnet  I will get back to you in five yrs
885207,Garnet,2014-12-07 13:41:00,2056,"I'm sure or hope you can to well.  Like me you bought in the crash. I bought bank stock until I was rolling Quarters to pay for another 100 shares. I max my credit card 3 times 25 days before GIC money was available to me.  The majority of these people on this forum are not ready for that stuff.  As you are likely aware selling a profitable stock is incredibility hard, but until you do you have made nothing."
885296,sofabed,2014-12-07 21:45:00,119,Thanks for all the advice in his thread. Has anyone sold their stocks they purchased in 2008? I am looking at unloading them however what do you invest in if you sell your stocks GIC's at 2.5%? I will retire in 5 years and I am fortunate to have a full DB pension.
885312,irishfield,2014-12-07 22:19:00,26272,"If you don't need the money, as is evident that you want to reinvest at todays piddly GIC rates.. why would you sell ?"

885407,danc,2014-12-08 05:18:00,4677,"I'm no financial genius by any means, but have been working full time in a big three trade union for over 37 years. So I'll be fine. I thought that I'd be able to retire in just over a year because we had a $500.00 a month bridging at age 58 to age 60. It's been there forever, but when my time comes up.... POOF!!! It's now gone after this year. Oh well. I have to go a couple more years but I'm seasoned enough in my trade that I can pretty much pick my own jobs. Also I have two pensions in my union. The big one that pays a set amount, and a smaller self directed one that started out with nickles and dimes, that is now worth a small fortune.  For you stock guys, here's my pick. RUBICON minerals. They staked the claims all around Goldcorps flagship Red Lake operation. Right from under their noses. They are going full steam ahead and are set to start producing gold next year. About a buck per share right now. These guys are going to be pulling massive amounts of gold up from the ground. I,m heading to Red Lake in the morning to have a look around."
885430,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-08 08:44:00,8243,"That is the only way I would ever invest in a company. I need to see the operation for myself up close. You can tell if they are serious and able to make a profit. A cousin invested 6 figures in a BC mine that turned out to be basically a Mom and Pop operation with a PO box, idiot. It's worth an airline ticket and a truck rental to take a look yourself. Show up like you want to own the place and they will give you a tour and lunch."
885440,Garnet,2014-12-08 12:15:00,2056,Should you sell your stock bought in the 2008 crash?  This is why people lose money in the markets. Are you going to use these stocks to produce income. Are they in a volatile sector. Do you need the capital.  As I stated our rrsp money is set to provide a pension income for my wife. The 5 banks we hold are all up 300+% from the 08 crash along with a few other div. stocks return just over 5%. This is rock solid boring investing. When the next correction happens I will buy again.  Inflation can still hurt use so theirs income available for that.  We have 5% in high mer mutual fund front load that invests in jr oil/gas that has been crushed lately but still up 100%. My reason for paying high mer is I'm not a geologist and I don't want to spend hrs and hrs on the computer.  You never had a gut punch until the markets correct and you just lost 250k if you react wrong or you are in the wrong stuff.
885506,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-08 22:15:00,2582,"You never had a gut punch until the markets correct and you just lost 250k if you react wrong or you are in the wrong stuff. Not that much...but in the 2008 crash we lost on paper more then we made working. That was enough of a ""gut punch"" for me. Thankfully we stayed the course and by March of 2009 we had got it all back plus some and have been doing great since then.  Between the 2 of us I think we drank enough wine that year  that we could have  bought a winery ourselves"
885523,Garnet,2014-12-08 23:16:00,2056,2008 was my 6th correction. My 1st I stayed the course  and like you back to even in a few months. The last 5 correction I've bought heavily.  Still a gut punch.  I finally started buying individual about 6 months before the tec crash turned 50k into 6k with fuel cell stocks.  The only good thing most of the 50k I won fishing bass tournament's and learned to build a rock solid foundation then buy high flyers.
885538,sofabed,2014-12-09 00:45:00,119," I am also looking at generating an income from my stocks in retirement. I have all the blue chip stocks which are paying a 4 - 6% dividend ( banks, communications, railways, reits etc). My question comes from the old saying buy low and sell high. My stocks are at all time highs and is it a good time to sell?  The problem is I have not been through the ups and downs in the market as I was 100% GICS until interest rates hit an all time low. From what I see suggest is I need to get used to riding out the lows as well as invest in them. I also know its all about your risk level and what lets you sleep at night."
885540,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-09 01:19:00,8243,"Another reason I never got back into the market, boring.  No control other than to buy and sell while risking my hard earned money to get a meager 5% to 6% return. I love control. Can't touch it, feel it, smell it, taste it, hug it, watch it grow big and strong more importantly make love and sleep in it. I like to be personal with my money, we've been through a lot together and don't want it to just disappear one night when I'm not looking.  I know many get exited buying and selling but I never got the bug."
885596,Garnet,2014-12-09 12:00:00,2056,"Well Sofa to buy in a crash you need cash on hand.  So that would be my ? What's your cash position. I've went from zero to about 25% that is in short term Gic.  The only thing I sell is SU when it gets up around $50. It didn't make it this time no worry's still the largest present in the oil sands. My avg. price paid is $29/share so no buy opp just yet. Around $24-25.  I slow down my div. reinvestment to get the 25% cash position.  Iron I also love real estate just don't like the work, no midnight phone calls, no disasters when packing for trips. I bought Rio Can it's a REIT. My wife and I own 1 sq inch of every major shopping mall in Canada. They send a nice distribution every month."

We're taking the dive next summer renting our current home with no mortgage and buying a larger home where the basement can be turned into a legal rental unit. We'll let both rentals help pay off our mortgage and then use the equity from both properties to buy our ""we'll die here"" home. We'll then have 3 rental units paying off our mortgage. When the tenants are done paying for my nice house their money will then be diverted into my retirement account where it will grow quickly and for as long as I can deal with the headaches.    Once the first property is paid off you're golden."
884867,Garnet,2014-12-05 11:55:00,2056,You really should get into what your rrsp are invested in. What funds and what mer Management expense ratio.  Most are 2-2.5%  but could be up to 6%. This comes off the top you pay good and bad years. Just about every mutual fund has a ETF equivalent at .05%. Your plan may not let you get the etf's but you should ask.  Because you have a db and dc plan you don't need to be crazy with rrsp. For mine I needed to provide a pension for my wife and then some exacter when inflation starts to get tight.  You should still have emergency fund setup like 3 months of bills and your tfsa is a good place for that.
884870,BillM,2014-12-05 13:11:00,17367,"Yeah, you gotta watch the MERs, they can really hit you in the wallet, especially when you end up with substantial amounts in your RRSPs.   I've got stock options through work, also a RRSP they'll match  up to 6% of my annual salary.  I also invest outside of work as well (Another RRSP, TFSA and a bunch of ETFs)...   We get company stock at a 15% discount right off the bat, and we're allowed to use 10% of our salary towards that as well.  It's built up a sweet little nest egg for myself over the past 10 years.  I think the most important thing people have on their side is time..  I started investing in my mid 20's, bought a house at 28 (That will be paid off in the next 4 years)..   If the market dips, that's the best time to stop worrying about what you've potentially lost and drop more $$$ into it.  I did that in 2008 and I'm reaping the benefits of it today...   Just gotta be smart, don't panic and things will work out.

Lost one pension plan due to my company going bankrupt, lost another small fortune in a divorce. Still, I'm going to be okay, not abundantly wealthy, but certainly okay. The key for my wife and I was to have a goal, even though we've done well we spent money nearly as quickly as we made it, so 5 years ago we created a spreadsheet with all our monthly income, expenses, and planned savings. Don't get me wrong, we had been saving all along, but we didn't really have a plan and couldn't really see the end. As we developed our spreadsheet we were kinda forced to answer some questions. Did we want to pay off everything we owe or squirrel more money away, and how much savings did we need before we retired given our other income streams just to name two. We decided we wanted to retire debt free. We determined an amount the cash and savings we needed for our planned lifestyle and then we calculated how much we had to save to achieve these goals. Now, each month we review how we're doing. This has really helped us stay focused and avoid things we'd like to have but don't need. It also has forced us to seek answers to questions for which we had little understanding, so anyhow we think it's been a savior for us, and I would recommend this process to anyone, no matter how old. You won't have all the answers at first and that's okay, but if you keep at it your spreadsheet will get more detailed and accurate."

A weekly hi light is grocery shopping. My mom gets out with other seniors all the time for cards or whatever. Volunteers at the hospital. Drives her senior friends around who no longer have a license. If you phone there house my dad answers the phone 99.9% of the time because my mom is off doing something. From watching there retirement unfold I have a pretty good idea what I want to do and not do.

I don't have a pension plan at work and many of my friends are retiring or talking retirement, so my investment is that I have no debt and a house as an investment (mortgage free) that I can sell if I can't afford to survive in retirement. A friend of mine says that the only thing golden in retirement years is the colour of your piss. I'm travelling now, while I still have my health and don't need high insurance coverage, so that means spending money. I can't take it with me.

884936,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-05 18:29:00,8243,"We tried it 14 winters ago Steve. Kept the home in Hamilton, rented it out and moved to the cottage on Erie about an hour away. Probably the biggest reason to make the move to take my pension very early. I calculated if we would be able to survive on my pension alone and could if we downsized. No need for all those rooms we had for 2 people. Can only sleep in one room at a time.  I can tell you though I was a few R values short last winter with that snow and wind blowing off the lake and it was tough for my wife to get to work, she missed 9 days due to white out conditions. So this year I did not rent a studio on the 3rd floor in the city and if need be she can go there. It actually has come in handy as we have stayed there a few times this fall rather than drive home after a night out in the city. It is killing me knowing I'm out the rental income but worth it when she can't see the road in front of her once she gets within a few K's from the lakeshore. It is great if you can swing keeping both properties until you put in at least one winter at the smaller home. It is a real change for sure. Storage was the biggest challenge as I tend to keep everything I ever had including my high school jackets. They will be back in style I tell her, as for fit, well....."
884940,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-05 18:50:00,8243,"I think I am freinds with your Mom and Dad. Sounds exactly like a few friends I have that are retired. Louis' high light is his afternoon nap and driving into town to do some shopping and standing in line at the bank. Your parents are my parents but the opposite. Dad is go,go, go, even though he slowed down a bit at 85, 87 now. Rode his 10speed to the Boce club everyday until his late 70's .Mom has been sedentary for years. Many back operations from the 60's to 90's have crippled her up and can hardly get into and out of the car, I timed it, a good 5 minutes of struggle and pain, sad to see and scary, that could be me someday, we share much DNA. Sad to see. Even when they lived in FLA in the winters for 20 years she never left the condo for one reason after another. She only went to the pool if someone was visiting from here.  I started putting resumes out before I left the plant. Almost took a great job as a Ministry of Labour inspector, Gov car with a light on it! And a basic flex time schedule only having to into the London office a few times a week, basically working from home, that is until I realized it was a union position and I would be getting a few weeks vacation for the first few years. I couldn't go from 9 weeks to 3, no way. And I carefully looked at business opportunities before leaving.  I put together a bucket list of things I always wanted to do that I never had time to do because I worked shifts for 25 years of 30. I's never too late to learn and took a business course at Mowhawk after I finished the reno's to the cottage, and I wasn't the oldest there. I always wanted to get involved in the theatre and acting as I mentioned earlier, fantastic experience but never made it to Hollywood. Dennis Farino, a very successful actor never acted a minute on stage until he retired from the Chicago PD, he was my inspiration to do it, Hollywood never called, yet. Another was to visit many relatives in the US that I was never able to. Drove Route 66 from Chicago to San Fran in a rag top and we took our time doing it. It was still tough, the guys and gals at work is what I still miss the most. A few still keep in touch but it's not the same as breaking their balls every day, I still dream about the action there 15 years latter. Another was getting something bigger than my 14 foot tinny and golfing more than a dozen times a season, the list is long and I'm not anywhere close to done, as long as the money holds out and more importantly my legs. The list is constantly growing. This winter will be helping a pal finish refurbishing his 35 footer and working on my 19 footer. More painting and drawing this winter. I can't go south much as health insurance for me is ridiculous now, a few weeks is about it as my lady works full time still.  The adjustment was probably the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I started working at that plant at 16 years old on weekends and summers.  It doesn't take much effort to make a list of things you always wanted to do in your life, the tough part is doing it. As the Nike motto goes "" JUST DO IT"".  Keeping busy is different than being productive. It doesn't take money to be productive, sometimes it can be lucrative as well."

The sad thing is that so many people who have nothing left to loose end up there in desperation trying to win something, just think about it; have you ever bought a lottery ticket? Why?  Our wonderful government plays on the gambling addiction just as they play on the alcholics addition or the smokers addiction. You do have a choice (unless you are addicted)!"

The only difference is that the con artist can get 7 years, but the govt bureaucrat will get a  nice pension for bilking the public of its money."

885106,Dave Jones,2014-12-06 18:25:00,50,RRSP's are the biggest rip off there is ! The only ones making money are the guys that are selling them to you. Open yourself a TD waterhouse account and watch BNN.  There are some excellent opportunities in the energy sector right now.  I bought Ford @ $2.18 in 2008 and sold it last year for $17.00 (this was a huge gamble and I don't recommend you try this one but I had a little inside info on this one )  Here are a couple of my acquisition from this week (Excellent companies with strong balance sheets and they are on sale right now !!!! )  PD.TO RRX.TO PPL.TO
885112,Garnet,2014-12-06 20:01:00,2056,Do not start with these types of energy stocks. You can make money but 95% hang on to long and lose.  Build a rock solid div. portfolio and do a lot of study then take 5-10% and try cottail stocks.
885113,BillM,2014-12-06 20:03:00,17367,I think I am going to sell all my investments and start slinging crack

885133,Big Cliff,2014-12-06 22:29:00,6899,I grew two pot plants on our deck one year (until Sue found out what they were). Figured out that at about a grand each they were a good investment and they didn't take up much room. Note to self: Sue might not know the difference between hemp and pot but some of her friends sure do!
884527,Salmonidstalker,2014-12-03 19:25:00,265,"At some point that money has to come out. I'm not saying that you're right or wrong, the stock market just doesn't really interest me, even if the returns are fruitful. It wouldnt sit right with me at night."
884528,irishfield,2014-12-03 19:27:00,26272,As I pointed out.. the idea is for the money to come out ONLY after you have stopped making an earned income. So you draw from your RRSP's at the lowest tax rate available and if possible not above the basic personal deduction so you pay NO tax on it.
884529,Garnet,2014-12-03 19:28:00,2056,"I'm waiting for my 6th correction of 20 % or more. I did panic the first time the other 4 I made out like a bandit.  VXP 2 things you are in the stock market every day of your life. Weather you pay cash or credit if you buy anything you are in the markets.  And the 5 major banks have paid Div. every year for 175 years strait, not much to worry about."
884532,Big Cliff,2014-12-03 19:33:00,6899,"Realestate and in particular waterfront if you know what you are looking for is probably one of the best investments you can make. The big thing about waterfront is they aren't making any more of it. Places like the Kawarthas are growing and will continue to grow. When you have people selling their houses in the GTA for $650,000.00 + and looking for a place to retire on the water, well, they have the money to spend.  In my case, one of my pensions went by by leaving us with a lot less to live on than we expected to have. We do have a lot of equity in our home but don't want to use any of that until the time comes that we need it.  Fortunatly for me I love working and doing things. I was fortunate to find a job that I love, I can work when I want to, play when I want to, and the extra money I make from working pays for all the extras that we enjoy.  We also rent out our basement apartment to students every fall to spring, the income from that pays our taxes and utilities as well as some of the up keep.  I haven't had much success with the financial planners, Sue invested a bunch of money with one and basically lost almost all of it. I also invested through our bank, after 4 years I had slightly less than I had invested and I decided I wasn't going to be able to retire on that so I pulled it out.  Most of all, don't give up everything today for what you might have tomorrow, live for today look forward to tomorrow."
884533,Salmonidstalker,2014-12-03 19:33:00,265,"Yes I understand fully how RRSP's work, and for some they make sense but I personaly do not want the government in control of my money with the fear that if I ever needed it one day, I would be slammed with taxes. Just my opinion and don't really fault anyone for investing their money that way. To each their own."
884558,irishfield,2014-12-03 20:59:00,26272,What ever makes you comfortable VXP.. that's all that matters. BUT..  if you put it in this year to defer the taxes..even at 51% as a highest earner.. and you need that money next year for something real important and you're still working. You're still only going to pay the same 51% on it.. so nothing has been lost. You only gain if you can leave it there until you are in a lower tax bracket or not making money at all.
884607,bigbuck,2014-12-03 23:35:00,2449,"So just how exactly is the government in control of your RRSP?? Are they in any more control of that any more tthan anything else, your home, your bank accounts, etc.... how else is the average Joe going to be able to save enough money to retire?? CPP and OAS will put food on the table and pay some bills but is no where near enough to get by. Not everyone has a job with a generous pension or works for the government. You have to do something to be able to retire."
884618,captpierre,2014-12-03 23:55:00,2521,"Lots of good advice.  LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS  Pay yourself first.  Save 10% first.  Automatic withdrawal,  Live on 90%.  Get out of debt.  Highest interest rate debt first.  RRSPs if you will be earning less money after retirement than now. -there will be a tax advantage. Some financial advisors  recommend interest earning investments in RRSP  Stocks outside of RRSP ( capital gains will be taxed at at 50% when sold rather than in RRSP where taxed at 100%)  Max out TFSA  AVOID  equity (stocks) mutual funds.  Way too expensive .  You will pay 2-2.5% per year on the total amount whether they go up or down. 60% of these funds don't beat the exhanges (TSX, DOW, Nasdaq etc) because of these fees.  You can buy theses exchanges thru ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) for .05%.  No research and analysts to pay for.  My concern is, the whole world economy is deeply in debt and fragile. Some say there is a huge collapse coming in the future. It might get ugly.  Like money is worthless. Food.  Land.  Maybe gold. In the mean time, you have to be in the stock market.  Interest accounts don't even cover inflation.  Work hard.  Don't get sick.  Fish more.  You'll be good"
884643,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-04 01:29:00,8243,"That would be me. Never put a penny in RRSP's because of the rather good, at the time and still hanging on company pension plan that at one time was funded at above 100% currently at 89%, so if it was to be wound down tomorrow I would see a 11% loss that is offset by taking the early CPP pension. I have been retired 15 years and have not missed any meals, believe me. I needed every penny of cash I could get my hands on to invest in properties. Whether a rental or flip. We were flipping before there were reality shows showing how to do it. Believe me we had to learn through our mistakes.  Not all debt is bad, if I have to pay a slightly higher than prime rate to see cash to buy more "" good deal"" properties to sell at 12% or more above the interest as aim ROI, so that's good debt. Eventually that interest is no longer overhead unless that money can get a greater return elsewhere and a low interest loan is secured for purchase. There were times we had to buy material or pay a specialty tradesman on a credit card, well that's what had to be done. High interest loans will kill you yes, but some debt is the price of doing business."

884688,Moosebunk,2014-12-04 06:46:00,3970,"Can't help either... really do know little of investments... especially those for the long term.  But that said, great thread to read through.   Do believe though, (for maybe some other's reading) that it doesn't hurt when you're young to invest in an education or skill that has ""actual"" job prospects, even if that maybe means incurring some extra debt on top of debt already existing.  Get working, make better money, and sock some of it away for the old and grey.   And don't make it all about the end game either... there's plenty space in the middle you won't get back, and plenty things you won't be physically able to do despite finally having the time and money to do so."
884696,Garnet,2014-12-04 12:48:00,2056,Learning about investment that can be held in your RRSP and your TFSA is a huge subject.  So read Wealthy Barber and look up Idiot Millionaire Derek Foster his 1st 3 books are very good for building foundation.  The last couple he moved to options. There's money to be made in options but it takes a big time commitment and lot's of computer time.  Remember to send twice the time researching investments .  Canadian Money Forum is a good DIY investing site. Has a good real estate thing to.
884701,BillM,2014-12-04 13:19:00,17367,Canadian Couch Potato is another good site if you want to do some reading.
884702,Sharkbait22,2014-12-04 13:33:00,297,"That's some good advice from Moosebunk. It can be a tough balance between doing something you want to do and doing something that will land a job.  I'm in my 40s but can appreciate that times have changed for young adults.  It certainly doesn't seem as easy to get a job early in life, raise a family, and stick with the job for life. This is even more true if you can't or don't want to move e.g., out to Alberta.  Most kids these days would love that opportunity to get ""life"" started early. Kids graduate (if they take the post 2nd route - which too many do likely) with a lot of debt and don't even have a job, perhaps no car.  Free government money (grants) for education is largely a thing of the past. University and college tuition is very expensive.. Most of this is not relevant to the OP and I'm not entirely certain of what I've written - just trying to understand things. I have a preteen."

884793,Steve,2014-12-04 23:41:00,2075,"great advice....and great participation....no worries for the little side tracks, lol.  Gerritt, was in the office today and checked up with HR on my plan.  I too am in a base DB plan, which is based on my pay grade.  Then I contribute on a DC plan, in which the company matches, but only to a certain % based on annual salary. I double checked and I'm paying in the DC plan enough to ensure I'm getting my company to match their full 50%.  It sucked that I took 25K from my RRSP savings to buy my home, but I'm of course already well into paying that back.  I keep a low credit card balance (<$1K), and don't have a line of credit.  I see the point of sacrifice, for sure. I just cancelled my personal cell phone. Wife still has one....but I'm done with those evil things.  I wish I could have paid cash for my house...that is quite an achievement!!!  again, thanks for the advice...I did find out my company has a 90 plan.  age + years of service = 90 and you get retirement.  For me that works out at age 58."
884406,Steve,2014-12-03 01:42:00,2075,"Let's face it. We all want to retire (or at least most us, lol).  However, for many of us, retirement is just a dream.  One common piece of advice is to ""start planning early"".  With that said, if you're not in a union job, or not in a public service job, retirement planning is even more important.  Obviously RRSP's are a key....but there must be more to it than RRSP's.  Can someone who is ""almost"" there, or maybe has some financial planning/retirement planning knowledge, provide those of us not in the public sector, or unionized environment, some advice?  Thanks greatly!  Steve  edit: Grammar."
884412,Gerritt,2014-12-03 02:10:00,6129,"Steve, I just went through my pension package for the company I work for (non Union factory) I had some choices to make...  I could go with either a DB or defined benefit package  Or  A DC defined contribution package.  The difference between the two is that the DB package the company administering the plan makes all the calls where my money is invested.  The DC package I can direct where my money is invested, after speaking to a financial planner the DC option was a better option in terms of return.  That said I can change to the DB plan at any time. And visa versa.  My pension is 100% company paid. I can contribute additional funds as I see fit ie. Company stock which are match to a certain percentage by the company (free money!)  I am also given a percentage of my wages based upon years of that I can put into rrsps, tfsa, company stock or into gics etc.... I chose the rrsp route but have directed those funds into my wife's rrsp account. This is a tax savings for me, as I still get the tax write off, but pay less taxes when they are used based upon my income and the other monies I will be receiving.  Speak to a financial planner. Speak to several of them if need be. Tell them what you think you will need to retire monthly. They will tell you what is needed to achieve your goal.  Just advice from a normal guy that just went through the process.  G"

884443,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-03 04:22:00,8243,"Finances are an intricate portion of retirement and one must prepare for it. I can't quantify the percentage that good finances are to a successful retirement but it isn't only finances. Mental preparation for who you will be, what will you do and how you will do it is in my opinion equally important as being financially sound. We concern ourselves with the money and do not prepare ourselves with the reality that retirement is. What you did before you retire is what you will do after retirement. Don't think that you take up golf, or start fishing, or travel because you don't have the time to do it working if you have never done it before, not always but seeing many guys retire one usually does what they did before. I had a few things I've never one and actually did it, if only to prove myself wrong. Actually joined the local Theatre and did a stage play. That turned into lead roles that turned into a few ""guy looking tough in the background"" real pay to see movies, no talking, they have to pay you for that above the 10 bucks an extra gets, plus you need something called talent. That was fun. digress as usual, sorry.  I as well as many thought this place I work my entire life including weekends in High School just can't do without me, think again. The day after you are gone you become a second thought. A few months latter there may be a lunch, dinner, golf tourney that you used to organize, the next year they may forget to invite you. It's just the way it is. I left very early. Having started at 19 and with our bonus of 20% credited service given without penalty I left with 27 1/2 years service at 45. Fantastic, healthy, a great pension with full benefits, just turned 45. I always wanted a job in the fresh outdoors and no responsibility. So I took a dream job working the grounds on a 4 star not yet open golf course. Free golf, no one to manage, no meetings, no MOL or MOE investigations, no getting called in at 4 AM on Christmas day and everything that goes along with really good money back then. Yea right, when a kid that had 3 years from community college reminded me I was supposed to clean the front stoop of the clubhouse and actually wrote me up, the first time in my life, ever disciplined, I quit right on the spot, handed her my name tag and walked to the opposite side of the counter to book a T time. Actually that was fun, I had never resigned or quit anything in my life. What wasn't funny was when the owner asked me to come back in and the poor 24 year old ""manager"" was in tears when he made her apologize to me and ask me not to leave. That was sad to see. Needless to say I started my own business a month latter and I was sweeping the stoop in front of the showroom.  Be prepared besides the financial aspect. Both mentally and physically. Don't forget you won't be 40 forever and along with a CPP payment comes many a prescription for old timer meds.  Check out HBO Sports program 30-30. Just today the Peter Berg documentary program interviewed Brett Favre. Michael Strahan, Tiki Barbour as well as the soldier who's story was told in the movie Lone Survivor. Marcus Littrel is the Navy Seal frogman that was portrayed by Mark Walburg. If even one smige of what he went through in the movie is true this guy's the real deal.

Sure you don’t get a tax refund but all income earned is tax free and more importantly you get to control when you take back some dollars. If you can sock away more each year than the allowable TFSA limit, then consider RRSP contributions. Remember that Government forced withdraws from RIFFs at age 71 can lead to OAS clawbacks.

Regardless of capital gains it has worked well for me as well. Plus we can go to one when we want a tan, any time we want. Not for everyone, absolutly. I just don't think you can lose if you are able to manage it. When I got hit big in a market crash in 81 that was enough for me trusting my hard earned money with someone in a glass tower.

Lost one company pension when the company went bankrupt. Govt allows companies to borrow against the pension. Had a great RRSP until the I.T. stock collapse. The investment fund stopped paying out, and remains locked up until the RRSP has recovered from the losses.  Biggest challenge to retirement is health care costs. There is a lot the government does not cover. If you have pre-existing medical conditions, most private health plans will decline you or bleed you. This I have learnt watching my wife spend 6 years going through the surgical revolving door."

Real Estate has worked for us. Having tenants is not for everyone....but it sure is nice having someone else pay your mortgage off for you. Our son has jumped into that pool now as well. Got a place 3 years ago when he was 22 and has 3 tenants. The first 2 years he was working part time and going to school full time...I really don't know how he managed all that on his own.   His entire mortgage is covered by his tenants. Now he's full time and making a decent wage so he is really paying down his mortgage fast. Made a lot of sacrifices...how many 25 year old's still don't have there first car...but have a house? Very proud of him."

884476,Garnet,2014-12-03 12:15:00,2056,"I started finical planning very young. Have read most books on the subject and have made it to retirement. 7 years'.  It's just like building a house, start with the foundation. Daily expense's, weekly expense's, monthly expenses and yearly expense's. This means pay your bills on time, avoid late charges, don't pay weekly insurance that cost more at end of year.  And at pay yourself first. (Wealthy Barber) 10%.  Then look into pension plans.  Everybody should have both tfsa and rrsp to some degree . You need to understand these are just suitcases that you hold investments in.  These investments might be GIC,Stocks ,bonds, riets , etf's , mutual funds.  Real Estate is also investment it's like buy a job.  Financial Planners are a mine field. They are mostly salesman working a commission, banks just as bad as private planners. The best are for fee planners and you need a 1/2 ton on money. Likely 500k.  Make sure you study Canadian investments.  This is just a small outline something to remember we spend hours and days and weeks researching boats motors, fishing rods, resorts. Your future takes twice the time."
884478,Salmonidstalker,2014-12-03 12:30:00,265,"The key is getting out of debt as soon as possible. I'm 32 and I've never bought anything if it wasn't in cash, including my house, my boat and my cars.  It's probably my European background. I'm completely debt free and what a load off it is not to have the mortgage payment every month, car payment every month etc.  Im also a saver. I sacrifice a lot but what I get in return is much greater and deeper than having more STUFF.  Add up your interest amount on your house, your car and everything else you need a loan for and you'll probably see that you are working for the bank not yourself.  If you have debt, get rid of it and you'll see that retirement will not only come sooner, but the load off your shoulders while getting there will make a huge difference in your overall happiness.  Debt.......that is the killer.  I guess to add to this is that I am not retired so, I can't really add the advise of those that are there; however, I think I'm headed in the right direction.  Can't imagine how hard it must be for young families out there with kids, a never ending list of bills, a mortgage, and car payments. At the end, very little must be left."
884484,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-03 14:31:00,2582,The OP was asking this question with regards to people being close to retirement. I'm 44 months out so I guess I qualify. I have a question of my own to throw out there as well. Recently my wife the banker has been asked when we plan to retire. Her birthday is in May and mind is July. So we where looking at retiring Aug 1st. She has been advised to retire at the start of a year. The reason being you will have less income to claim and can potentially save thousands in taxes.  Haven't looked into this yet to see if it will really make any kind of a difference.  Being the cheap so and so I am I got no problem retiring Jan 1st instead of Aug 1st if it means more $$$$ left in my pocket. Anybody out there know more about this?

884486,wkrp,2014-12-03 14:44:00,656,True your financials should be in place but remember that life is short and to have fun as well.You will never have as much as some others but you will be rich in life. I see too many people accumulating wealth while forgetting to live.
884489,bigbuck,2014-12-03 14:56:00,2449,"I was a financial advisor for 17 years before I sold my business this year to switch gears in my life and focus on what really matters most, my health and my family. There are many good points here. For the average person working for a living, RRSPs combined with a TFSA are definitely a huge part of retirement. I also stress that consumer debt is a killer, get out of it asap. Mortgage debt is different, at the end of the day you have 4 walls you can eat or pass on to your heirs. Buy a rental property if you can muster up the down payment. The sweetest money you will make is the money made while you sleep. Someone else is paying your mortgage for you. It is work and has its ups and downs but if you buy the right property and are handy, you will do ok. When you have to pay someone to unplug a toilet, then rentals are not for you, you will end up spending more than you bring in on the property. As for RRSPs and TFSAs, balanced investments are the way to go. You need the fixed income portion to cushion the downs and equities to provide the upside. Yes, the market tanks every few years, it has always done it, but it makes its way back up over time, our whole economy is based on this. For the doomsayers that think everything is a house of cards and it will come crashing down, it probably is BUT if our economy and way of life collapses, you could have a mattress stuffed full of cash that will only be good for lighting a fire, nothing else. Buy monthly, ignore the noise and when the market tanks, put more money in, that it the absolute hardest thing to do but let me tell you, if you have the intestinal fortitude to do that, you will make out like a bandit if you buy into companies that are perfectly fine but get dragged down with the rest of the market. Use your tax refund to either pay down your mortgage or fund your tfsa. Do not blow it on frivilous things. PM me if you want to chat. I can help you out with a few ideas, FOR A PRICE, a fishing spot or two......."

This is true, I retired June 2008 just before the markets tanked, it was a scary ride down, the TSX lost about 40% of its value. Make sure you position yourself to make more on the way back up than you lost on the way down and you will be fine.  Started with a max RRSP contribution in the late seventies and went payroll deduction RRSP thought the 80's and 90's , mostly gic's cause the interest rates were good sometimes over 10% back then. Last few years couldn't do RRSP's cause past service adjustments to my company pension ate up my deduction amount.  One of the best funds I have is a TSX index fund, strange that many funds can't outperform the TSX index , don't say much for fund managers.  Instead of GIC's look at buy and hold stocks, like Bell Canada Enterprise and majour bank stocks, the dividends paid are higher than interest today."

884523,irishfield,2014-12-03 18:59:00,26272,I had an Engineer that worked for me from '85 to about 93 that believed that the only reason there was RRSP's was so that the government would know where your money was and how much they could steal by simply passing some legislation. He know lives in a shack up near Magnetawan trying to make ends meet. Deferred taxes... RRSP's work if you are even one step up off the minimum tax bracket. Save the tax on that amount.. make interest tax free and hopefully don't need to pull it out until you can do so in the lowest tax bracket.  That said... the Government is starting to go along my Engineers thinking... Capital gains on some RRSP funds will now be taxed fully as fully taxable income and not at the 50% of the gain as in the past.
