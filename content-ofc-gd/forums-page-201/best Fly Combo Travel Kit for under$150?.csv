886051,Christopheraaron,2014-12-11 22:00:00,3525,"30 feet is a shooting head, basically a very heavy piece of fly line that has the weight of a full 90+ft line but in a much more compact package. It's great for distance and big flies/heavy tips but sucks for presentation, that doesn't matter much for streamer fishing but if you do intend on fishing dries it's less than ideal. The maxima he's using is just a nice stiff mono, you could easily go up to 40lb for running line if you decide to go with a shooting head system."

My fav for dragging the depths was a 280 or 300 grain 30 foot shooting head on a 8/9 wt rod, used a 100 feet 20# or so Maxima Mono for shooting line on top of the backing.  that just sounds perfect for the type of fishing ill be doing"

885694,BillM,2014-12-09 22:19:00,17367,What are you going to be fishing for?
885695,123chadder,2014-12-09 22:20:00,165,"it has to be strong enought to handle lake trout,its for specks and lakers"
885928,mosquito,2014-12-11 02:41:00,111,"I have never seen a kit that can do what you are asking.  Build your own ""kit"", I would say an 8wt atleast.   If you want keep the price down watch for sales, Cabelas has a travel fly rod that I heard was good you could look at. My first travel fly rod was a cheap Bass Pro one with a reel I got for about $60 on 50% off sale and ... it worked. I upgraded to a March Brown later but one would use up your whole budget> For a reel I have an  Okuma SLV it is a reasonable reel.  I would suggest going a size up in reel and having a bit of extra backing.  The line is your choice.  So a Bass Pro or Cabelas 4+ 8wt fly rod and reel, Say $100 (if you don't watch for sales) + a Okuma SLV another $70 + Lines for both reels    $100   Less than $300 ... or maybe around $200 if you are wait and watch and are not in a rush. plus backing and leaders  I would suggest watching here or some other forums and also watching Kijiji you MIGHT find someone selling what you are looking for or close enough.  Good Luck"

885944,Tim Mills,2014-12-11 04:05:00,476,I bought a 4pc pack fly rod at bass pro calgary for $44.00.  It casted well but I went fish less out there.  Scientific anglers used to sell a good starter package but I think the rod was a 2 PC.

I was looking at this a while back.  That rod is $159 USD.  The website states $45 standard shipping to Canada.  Duty and taxes, its probably closer to $300 CAD."
885985,123chadder,2014-12-11 15:43:00,165,well thanx for bursting my bubble
885988,123chadder,2014-12-11 15:51:00,165,didnt think of that...lol
885989,Christopheraaron,2014-12-11 16:00:00,3525,"Ummm, where are you fishing? An 8wt may be a little overkill depending on the size of lakers you're talking about. If you're just talking smaller back lake lakers around here I'd consider a 6wt. And for the line I'd look to see if you could find a Versitip system for sale (they retail for around $160 but you should be able to find one cheaper, DO NOT skimp out on line, it is by far the most important part of your setup) that way you get all of your lines in one and save on an extra spool/reel. For a rod I'd look towards Echo or TFO, both make very good starter rods, again you could look towards something used. For a reel take a look at an SLV as suggested or even a Flystart from Ross."
885996,BillM,2014-12-11 16:42:00,17367,You can even cheap out and use some leadcore to get down instead of using a full sinking line
885997,Christopheraaron,2014-12-11 16:43:00,3525,"You can even cheap out and use some leadcore to get down instead of using a full sinking line Leadcore goes for 30 bucks a spool, I can get a nice smooth casting poly leader for much less"

886010,bare foot wader,2014-12-11 18:11:00,1354,"it seems like you're tying to keep the budget around $200?  If you're a casual fly angler and want to switch lines, I'd go with that first costco combo and buy a sinking line for one of the cassettes...it will do everything you want it to  if you have a bigger budget, say 400 or so, then lots of other options open up  a lot of fly guys (all fisherman in general really) are huge gear hounds, always flipping gear...browsing classifieds would be a good idea as well"

886020,BillM,2014-12-11 19:09:00,17367,6wt/8wt not going to make a huge difference.  Personally I'd go with a 6wt.
886022,bare foot wader,2014-12-11 19:29:00,1354,"a 6wt would be a blast on 3-5lb lakers, but may/likley struggle to cast larger streamers with a full sinking line, especially in the wind...8wt would be great for bass and pike too if you're into that"
886033,mosquito,2014-12-11 20:52:00,111,"OK, Lake Trout at that weight a 6wt would work and if you go with the 6wt and don't get a kit I strongly suggest you go a size larger in the reel with that bit of extra backing that is a bit heavier and a drag like on the Okuma SLV.  You hook that 1 in a thousand fish and have a clicker reel or not enough backing and you will be rather upset.. ALSO   ALWAYS... ALWAYS have the backing have a higher lb rating than the leader.   If you get a run or a snag that has backing out you want the weak point to be the leader, watching the line zip out no longer attatched to the reel STINKS!!!!   Hook, leader. line and some backing all gone...  you are done unless you have a spare reel ready to go.  I still suggest the 8wt and the Okuma SLV 8/9 or bigger reel.  I don't know the Costco's but Cabelas has free shipping right now and there is this 6wt http://www.cabelas.ca/product/29226/st-croix-rio-santo-fly-fishing-outfit  and this has a 9' 8wt 4 piece that is backorderable... double check the shipping is still free if you backorder. http://www.cabelas.ca/product/71436/cabelas-prestige-collection-fly-outfit  At this time of year and heading on towards spring, watch and wait is my suggestion, know what you want but wait. Clearances, boxing days, Kijiji... lots of options and savings if you take your time."
886037,123chadder,2014-12-11 21:09:00,165,yes i agree waiting would be the best bet... so a 6 weight rod and an 8 weight reel?that makes sense.... are the akuma slv reels good?
886040,dave524,2014-12-11 21:28:00,4508,"Definitely 8 wt if you want to get down , with fly tackle the light lines don't sink that fast or as deep cause they are lighter, whodda thunk My fav for dragging the depths was a 280 or 300 grain 30 foot shooting head on a 8/9 wt rod, used a 100 feet 20# or so Maxima Mono for shooting line on top of the backing.

886043,123chadder,2014-12-11 21:46:00,165,i think i understand....so really only need 30 feet of fly line?
886049,dave524,2014-12-11 21:56:00,4508,"i think i understand....so really only need 30 feet of fly line?  yes it is like you purchasing the 30 foot  tip section of a weight forward  flyline and then using mono as the the running line instead of the light  level flyline that normally comes with a WF line . You lose in finesse but gain in depth and distance cast, the finesse is not critical when fishing sub surface. Google shooting head flyline and you should get the idea. Mono is good for a sinking head but for floating heads you can get light level floating flyline specifically for that use."
