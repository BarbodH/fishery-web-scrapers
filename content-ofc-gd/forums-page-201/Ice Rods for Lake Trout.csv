886181,jace,2014-12-12 15:16:00,472,"10 rings all the way down works well on heavier rods.  Use an 8's for the transition guides  if it's a spiral, then back to 10's.   I built a few heavy ice rods for a group of friends who fish big lakers up in the territories.   I had 7.0' #10-17 mag taper bass casting  blanks and cut out the section each one wanted.   Most ice rods and ice blanks on the market are pretty whimpy.   These guys already had custom ice rods built for them but they were very whippy glass rods with no power at all.  I think the builder's goal was to sell/make indestructable rods for them that could yank up those 40+"" fish without snapping, but the rods were bent over at the fore grip during the fight because they're so soft.    Beyond this, my only advice is to keep the tip tube at a size 7 or less for the best selection, size 8 has a very limited selection but they're around.   Anything bigger than that and you'll be looking at heavy weight boat rod tips.   n.b. now i'm talking about tube size on the tip, not ring size.   Decided to make my own, stumped on the guide size to use. Dont think ill go to small because of potential icing issues."

I think the most important thing is finding your own niche; if that means using a stick tied with mono or a Thorne Bro's rod, I'd say - use whatever you feel most confident in and that is usually going to be the most productive for you.  As long as you are fishing legally who cares whether you spent 5 bucks or 150 on your setup if you like it and it works lol?"

I've caught quite a few on a jigging rod and reel that size and bigger since, and don't remember them quite the same. There is something to be said about handlining a fish up through the ice. I love it.  I also carry all the high tech gear with me. I usually pull out the stick on a day when they are hitting good, just for old times sake, or if I'm traveling light to a back lake.
