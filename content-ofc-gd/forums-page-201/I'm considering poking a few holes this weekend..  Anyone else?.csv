886003,NAW,2014-12-11 17:20:00,4022,"I've got some free time Saturday morning (which is a rare thing).  I was thinking about going to check some ice conditions.  Southern Muskoka area.  This snow will not help things at all.  But I've got some quiet back bays that are sheltered from the normal prevailing winds.  They usually ice up early, and stays tight through the warm stuff.  Anyone else gunna go out for a poke this weekend?  (in this area that is..  I know you northerners are already driving trucks on the ice...)  It's highly unlikely, but I may be able to creep out for some Crappies.."
886005,BillM,2014-12-11 17:23:00,17367,Good luck man!  We gotta get out this year
886012,misfish,2014-12-11 18:24:00,29133,Hmm I was thinking sunday morning Nick.  Have a cup of coffee on the way up.LOL
886054,Christopheraaron,2014-12-11 22:02:00,3525,"With any luck I'm going out Sunday morning as well, will be on the hunt for some troot!"
886055,misfish,2014-12-11 22:06:00,29133,"With this dumping of snow,I might wait til next weekend. Dont like walking on new ice I cant see."
886089,RickOnt,2014-12-12 00:12:00,669,Yes B!!  When it comes to ice    A lot of evils can hide under the snow
886092,Joey,2014-12-12 00:16:00,9122,"Hmmm, I'd say it's iffy at best, be careful please"
886172,NAW,2014-12-12 14:42:00,4022,Yep.  Lots of snow!!  maybe a wee tad to much snow in the last 24 hours.  I had about a foot of snow in my driveway last night.
886176,Dara,2014-12-12 14:52:00,3052,Northerners don't drive trucks on the ice
886187,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-12 15:45:00,8243,It depends on my wife's mood. I couldn't help it sorry.
886191,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-12 16:00:00,956,"Be safe if you do so.  Ice may be good when walking out, but coming back with the heat being on it all day it could be a bit weaker."
886225,Joeytier,2014-12-12 20:21:00,3990,"Nick, we had 5-6.5 "" on back lakes up here on monday so I'm sure you could find some walkable ice on small lakes around there"
886251,Bondar,2014-12-12 23:08:00,817,I read this post title and immediately had the same idea LOL
886432,NAW,2014-12-13 20:27:00,4022,"well, to stick with Old Ironmakers theme!  My spud pole got his cherry popped for this years Ice fishing season!!  Poked a few holes, caught enough crappie for a small snack.  I got invited to see the trews last minute.  So I didn't leave the house until about 10..  Solid 4"" of black ice.

886439,misfish,2014-12-13 21:01:00,29133,You got up that little hill did ya Nick? LOL  Nice.

886485,Big Cliff,2014-12-14 02:37:00,6899,"Drove by Scugog this morning, looked solid..... unti l!!!!! lots of places out there where you could see what looked like open water. I could see where a person could suddenly find themselves in serious trouble out there. Please don't let it be one of our members this year. It just isn't worth a fish or two."
886514,livinisfishin,2014-12-14 13:41:00,661,Good job on getting out and catching a few!
886521,can u fish,2014-12-14 14:46:00,326,Great to hear you got out my son and I poked a few holes on Friday out in front of our place anywhere from 6 to 7 inches of ice got out on Saturday with the sleds and ice hut got a couple of small pike it was nice to get out and wet a line we will need a few more nights of colder temps in order to cross where the lake opens up so we can get to our winter hot spots.  Cheers Mitch...
