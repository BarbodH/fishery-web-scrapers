886194,Headhunter,2014-12-12 16:56:00,5703,"Another Long Point Bay adventure... Mid-70's, we are out on a family adventure to the Bay. We are four of us in our 14ft fiberglass ""run about"". Mom's sitting right behind me casting a Mepps number 3 dressed. She reached back to whip out the Mepps, but kinda miss judged her back swing. Yup, I've now got two of the trebles imbedded in the top of my head! She whipped it so hard, the drag ripped as the hooks sunk into my head. (now that was quite an accomplishment, because in order to make my mom happy, my dad had to crank the drag down on the Mitchell 300) So, there we are, floating a good 5 miles from shore, with my mom giving me what for, for my head being in the way of her cast! So, dad grabs the pliers and starts reefing in the Mepps! He did eventually get it out and yes, the bleeding did eventually stop. LOL To this day, I can't even look at a Mepps with a dressed hook without getting a shiver run down my spine! #2. Was fishing the Hartley Bay area with some buds, outta a canoe. We were a good two hour paddle from the launch, late 70's time frame. As the day was wearing on, we decided to troll back to camp. I hooked a small pike. I flipped it into the canoe and reached out for it to get the hook out. Well, this pike was like every other pike known to man and it did the usual freak out. (I was using a Rebel minnow bait with three trebles) I ended up with two of the three hooks, imbedded in my baby finger. First step, kill the fish! Second step, get the lure unhooked from my line. 3rd step, paddle back to camp for an hour with a Rebel lure hanging off my finger! Once back at camp, we realize that we don't have a first aid kit, but we do have a roll to TP and a roll of masking tape. I had to cut the hooks outta my own finger as my buddy was turning green just looking at the embedded hook. I lost all feeling in that finger for the better part of 5 years! Yah, yah gotta love fishing! I won't talk about the time my brother sat on a big ole musky bait out in the Moon River basin. Al three trebles jammed onto his bottom. His wife had to put him in the bed of the p/u truck, laying in his belly on their way to the clinic. Apparently, the doctor was laughing so hard, he had a hard time staying focused! HH"
886226,Musky or Specks,2014-12-12 20:30:00,2710,"I have a habit of catching good sized musky in front of a crowd. My buddy and I were fishing in our first boat- a 12ft jon up on Lake Restoule. The boat had a tiller style electric motor with a four foot handle extension. We are off a little patch of weed in front of a cotttage with a family gathering when BOOM my Grim Reaper gets attacked by a 46"" ski. First fish in this boat and I'm in the bow. Fish gets close to the boat and I realize that he might get all tangled in the trolling motor. I yelling at my friend to pull it up but its a really small boat and he can't reach around me. So with a mighty heave I give the trolling motor rope a pull. The four foot handle swings across the front of the boat and knocks me ass over tea kettle into the water. Managed to land the fish but dang it that was embarrasing and hilariosly funny. I only wish there would have been go pro back in those days. Americas funniest home videos here I come."

LOL She is sitting on her lawn chair feeding our lunch to a young skunk!  4-5 foot high grass and bushes all over, it's mom couldn't have been too far off.

Fed up he told her to shut up and he didn't want to hear another word. He comes back from parking the truck to find her standing there with a smile on her face, holding the rope and the boat half full of water. Guess who was the winner of that argument."

We headed out & were catching walleye when I spot the snake under the front seat which is occupied by my GF. I said ""the snake is under your seat"",to which she replied ""that's the anchor rope"" (rope happens to be green"") & then proceeds to tell me ""maybe it's time to get my OLD eyes checked"".

I managed to get my waders off in time, my shorts however, didn't make it.  was a great ride home to whitby, half naked, was hoping i wouldn't get pulled over.   last year, my dad came up from sarnia to do a weekend salmon fish on lake o, we get up nice and early, have a good breakfast, then head out.  stopped as the gas station to fill up the boat, my dad gets out, walks by the boat on the trailer and then stops dead, ask him whats wrong, and he gets this stupid look on his face, and says 'for a minute i thought we had lost the boat' he had walked past it thinking it was still his truck   then while out on the lake, after landing a nice chinook, and resetting the downriggers, my dad gets all frustrated and upset, ask him whats wrong he says ' well sh!t, i can't find ,my sunglasses, i think i set them on the back and knocked them over board'  i said what glasses are you looking for, he goes 'my polarized ones, i can't find the dammed things'  i look at him and say what, you mean the ones you're wearing on your face?  he just starts laughing and goes yea, those ones, i need a drink!"

I looked down the dock and noticed a small Musky chillin under the dock.  I was gonna tie the boat down but noticed it was in an eddy like pool and seemed to stay in same spot.  And of course I was right there.  Well I took 2 cast and had the Musky moving and then I noticed the boat floating away!  I had to think quick, do I jump in, I had a float suit on, or what??  Well I decided to cast my lure onto the deck, which was carpeted thank goodness.  And I reeled her back in without my dad noticing a thing. I can't believe how many things ran through my mind during that short period of time.  Hahaha."
886843,AKRISONER,2014-12-15 21:39:00,5558,"Maybe more embarressing for my friend but still hilarious. This spring on Upper Buckhorn im with a buddy on the early morning bass, sure enough were far from home and the fishing is good, Daves gotta drop an aqua dump. I personally had never used a foot pedal trolling motor control before, but dave tells me to take the helm and keep the ladder on the back end away from our neighboring fishing boat.  There goes dave off the back of the boat. Theres me at the controls not knowing what the hell I am doing. A gust of wind comes up and starts to push the boat around, i try to correct to keep daves bare turd butt concealed, but i over correct and the thing somehow locks into drive and immediately the boat spins a complete 180 with dave yelling at me to stop the boat.  I think his racket gave him up more than hanging out with his bare butt ever did ahaha.    I also have a total knack for somehow forgetting how to tie my line. Just this summer, I took a brand new spoon, tossed it out to watch it go flying out into the middle of the lake, walk back to my tackle box, take a new lure out retie and somehow throw that brand new lure into the depths as well. Dont ask me how it happens it just does.   I will say that in general I am just a total clutz, so getting myself snagged on hooks and tripping and falling in the boat etc etc are all common place. I am lucky that i dont manage to wreck gear or drop rods in the lake though. My dad is the pro at that."

885935,Acountdeleted,2014-12-11 03:07:00,2562,"So many good stories.  My top 2 for this year:  End of the season, my cousin, grandfather and I are all fishing at my parents cottage, walleye are hitting well and my cousin is cleaning up. On the first day he and I both had success and my grandfather got skunked. So we keep ribbing my grandfather saying he'll have to sleep 'ON DA LAWN"" because he didn't catch a fish.  Next morning my cousin boats another two and I get another one and we start ribbing my grandfather again. We say to him 'you gotta catch a fish or we won't let you in the car and you'll have to walk home'. Right as we say that his rod bends over and he ends up boating the biggest walleye of the day. Guess the fish must have been listening.    This year, I have had the privilege of dating a girl who loves fishing. I introduced her before I left for Alberta and she loved it, so we went quite a bit last summer (except she always out-fishes me). The thing she hasn't gotten used to it waking up at ungodly hours to go fishing. So, one Friday night over the summer, we are at her place and I mention I have to go pick up my new boat in Prequile bay and I have to do some work first along the way. I also mention I'll be going fishing with buddies after we get the boat. She asks if she can come and I say sure but that we will have to wake up at 7am.'No problem' she responds.  The next morning at 7am I go to wake her up and shes totally not having it. The conversation goes something like this. 'Come on hun. Time to wake up.' 'unnnnghhhhh' 'Come on. Fishing!' 'Unghhggh' 'You said you were going to come'. 'What is the pointiest, spikey-est fish in the lake?' 'I dunno......... a catfish. Why?"" 'I am going to smack you in the face with a catfish'  So a few hours later, all of us are in the boat fishing Presquille bay and none of us can buy a fish. I'm at the back of the boat fishing over the motor when I feel a spikey 'tap tap tap' in the back of my head. I turn around and there is my girlfriend.  'Jeremy! I caught a catfish!'  Only fish caught all day.  "

Well as you can imagine with a 9.9 it was pretty slow and the motor was howling and lugging the whole way. As we get there we start fishing and after 20 minutes I said...its pretty windy eh? And he replied that it was, so I asked him why we were not drifting and he looked at me and said  did you throw out the anchor to which I replied ....throw it out....I didnt pick it up 5 miles ago. We hauled it in and it had enough weeds in it so it was the size of a VW Bug. Had a chuckle about that one and the motor ran fine after that."

Only 2 campsites on the lake, and according to the online registry we were the only ones to have booked a site that week. I love this little lake and have been there many times...not unusual to spend the whole trip without seeing another soul. Well, it was a beautiful, sunny day and we thought to ourselves what could be better than a little ""afternoon delight"" on the rocks down by the waters edge. Not long into the session and we hear an unmistakeable paddle bang off a gunwale...look up and lo and behold two canoes rounding the point. We both scramble and do a naked mad dash for the tent...I think we covered that 50 yards in under 3 seconds. Once in the safety of the tent we couldn't stop laughing and that was the end of that!"

Might be a good one to keep in mind  You should get a pee bucket! My dad has to pee every 15 mins on the water because he drinks so much water lmao, so he just cut off the top of Tropicana containers so you have a handle to hold and everything.  Doubles as a bailing bucket as well lol Everytime we have someone new out in the boat they always comment on how much he has to pee lol, We have learned not to sit on the side the cooler is as you spend less time fishing and more time getting out water bottles for the guy ahaha"

Went out had a decent day boating a couple ski's, heading back to the launch we notice a military exercise of some sort going on with many military trucks, soldiers, and a couple boats working around using the launch and it was miserable out (cold and wet). I pride myself on being efficient at the ramp both loading and launching by myself a lot of the time. So I say to myself lots of eyes watching better make it good. Everybody is standing around watching, I back the trailer in flawless and quick, hop in the boat load it on the trailer, clip the front of the boat on the winch, hop out, pull the truck and boat outta the water and I'm like ""nice job under the pressure "" so I pull about 20 feet from the launch and I get out and I'm all head nods and stuff to the guys, and I start strapping down the boat emptying out my equipment and such and after probably 3 mins a guy walks up to me and says "" hey you might want to shut your motor off."" it was so loud that I couldn't even here my motor running from all the military equipment, definitely felt like a knob."

Sure enough, a boat comes around the bend before I finished.  As they passed by they said ""Nice moon"" hahahahaha.

I get a hit, decent fish I said to my partner, then as I get it near the surface I see it is a 4-5 pound ski, in a hurry I lip it! Bad move! LOL   Fishing with a buddy on one of Lake Erie's bays, make a long cast and sit down on my bow seat, a bass grabs it! I set the hook! and as I do the seat snaps off the pole at it's base. Over backwards I go! Lucky I didn't bust my dome on the gunnal, the last thing I saw on my way down was the bass jump and spit the hook.  Up in Ontario for a couple of weeks, a Canadian couple was also there with their kids and not catching much, so I offered to take the husband fishing the next day and show him around a bit. Crack of dawn the next day we hit the water, enter a cove and a big sailboat is moored, just minding our own business fishing and we hear a female voice "" catching anything"" we both turned around and two bare naked ladies are standing on the back of the sailboat!

I'm fishing on the French river with my grandfather who is using a jig, we are getting nothing when all of the sudden he hooks into something big, He reels it up, it pulls out more line, back and fourth for a few minutes before it snaps the line. We figure he must have hooked into a huge muskie.  Later that day, I go back to scout out the spot with my snorkel gear, to see where the drop-offs are and how deep. I didn't have the heart to tell my grandfather that I found his jig, hooked into someones waterline.    I'm no better. About 5 years ago, I'm working in Dryden and friends of friends tell me they are going to this lake with fishing unlike I have ever seen before if I'd like to come. I jump at the opportunity  After about 45 minutes fishing, all of us have our limit of walleye with a dozen beautiful jumbo perch. The other guys are ready to go and I say 'come on. Just one more'. They say ok. Less then a few minutes later I hook into another one. After fighting it for a few seconds I bring up the marker bouy the guy tossed out at the beginning of the day.

I have launched hans solo without the plug only to run back from parking the truck to stand there wondering why my auto bilge wont stop. my boat leaks so it took a second to come to my senses.  ive also fallen out of my old 14ft while fishing smallies on lsc. I like to remember that day being windier then it probably was. it was on video but in my embarassment i deleted it.  Ive had the pleasure of being hooked in the face and the back of the head by my fishing partners. Both were the first and last time I went fishing with those guys!  The one that gets me the most is my habit of unhooking fish and throwing the plies in the lake. I get to hasty for that picture and Ive lost atleast 5 pairs of pliers this way. Unfortunately theyre usually not mine but im always a good guy and replace them.  Last year while fishing wilmot early spring i was trying to climb the hill at the end of the path going up to the road, it was extremely icy so it was slow going. I got 3/4 of the way up and i had to cross to the other side of the path to avoid the ice. I got to the middle of the path with nothing to grab. Again im 3/4 up the hill and start slipping, arms flailing.  I wound up falling and sliding down the hill continuing down an adjacent hill down into the valley only coming to a stop when my waders snagged a tree and ripped. I had my new GLX in the hand the whole time so I was unable to slow down my slide. I went slid faster that day than ive ever gone at boler mountain! I ended up going the long way around back to the car.  Keep the stories coming!"
886182,manitoubass2,2014-12-12 15:27:00,11391,"last year ice fishing NW Bay Rainy Lake me and my partner ran into a couple of his buds. bonus some fishing company and great weather!  ice was maybe 8"" and pretty clear for rainy lake, but we had trouble locating the big walleyes we caught the day before. we had a good mixed bag going though pike crappie perch a few small walleyes and i got my first ever whitey  anyhow this other guy gets a big bite and runs to his rod holder but its too late! nice expensive rod and reel gone.  we were teasing him pretty hard when buddy number two get a big bite and the fight is on! it looks like a bigun so we wonder over to help.  he gets it to the bottom of the hole and its a beauty of a walleye! maybe 29-30""er  one problem. its got buddy number ones rod somehow wrapped around it and they try and try and try but cant get it through the hole.  in disgust he cuts his line and now we have two pissed of anglers yelling at each other...  so I says"" you know, the rod was right there, you coulda just grabbed it, cut the line and got your rod back, and your bud coulda landed his fish!""  it was one of the dumbest things ive ever seen from two guys claiming to be big time guides hahahaha  after some bickering between the two, they finally got in the laugh fest with my partner and I"
886184,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-12 15:34:00,8243,All great tales.
885817,ccmtcanada,2014-12-10 14:47:00,7971,"I saw a topic like this on Facebook and thought I'd try it out here.  We've all had hilarious/embarrassing moments while fishing or launching the boat.  Let's hear your stories!  I'll start....  First time ever launching a boat, I repeated to myself to put the plug in.  After walking around my boat a dozen times I slowly backed the boat into the water.  Before it totally floated off the trailer water started coming into the boat!!  Yep...forgot to put the plug in!!  Another time came while Muskie fishing.  It was raining and my hands were soaking wet.  I was using a spinning reel and throwing a big 12"" bait.  On one cast I wanted extra distance so I flung it out there with all I had!  About mid way through, the bail closed and the momentum, coupled with wet hands/handle caused the rod to fly out of my hand and ""splash!!""  Yep.  My rod ended up about 6 feet out of the boat and I slowly watched it sink. Lol."
885824,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-10 15:26:00,956,Usually ever year I get on these slow streaks where I don't catch much..  When I finally hook one and lose it I have a little temper tantrum.  This results in me slamming my rod in the water and yelling like a child.  I think I have even shedded a few tears lol.
885825,manitoubass2,2014-12-10 15:30:00,11391,"just this year my dad and I took my kids out fishing. small walleye lake and got a limit quickly so the kids wanted to fish bass for awhile. so I break out some heavier rods and all three of them are spooled in the 20lb range.  so were trolling the shoreline and im up at the front on the trolling motor. I hear this big snap and thud, something smacks me in the back of the head, pretty hard too  all the kids start laughing. I shut off the motor and im trying trying to figure out what just happend???  I look at the back of the boat, I see my new rod snapped. kids notice and stop laughing. im looking around the boat and I see a branch floating beside, good size branch too.  so now the kids fess up. my youngest had casted into a tree. so as I trolled the rod was under alot of tension. in a panic he musta tightened the drag. one thing led to another and as the branch broke the rod flung it at me as it snapped in half  I wasnt very happy but after a few minutes it was a good laugh:)"
885829,Bondar,2014-12-10 16:27:00,817,"A couple years ago I booked a Lake Erie Charter for Bass for my 85 year old grandfather and myself. I get to the ramp and get all our gear loaded into the boat and off we go for a full 6 hours of fishing. It wasn't until the ramp came into sight on our way back in it dawned on me, I had left my truck running beside the boat ramp passenger door wide open and windows down the entire time we were out. When I got back to shore my truck had been moved and the keys placed under the floor mat and a business card from the regional police asking me to give him a call. Guess I was pretty excited to get out there fishing with Gramps. Officer had a good laugh at my expense"
885831,manitoubass2,2014-12-10 16:34:00,11391,wow that coulda ended way worse  hahahaha
885834,BillM,2014-12-10 17:06:00,17367,"Left about $2,000 worth of camera gear sitting on a boat ramp in Toronto.  Buddy went back about 30 mins later and it was still there."
885840,NAW,2014-12-10 17:24:00,4022,"Oh boy, where do I start!  I backed in my 14' tinner.  Went and parked, locked the car, came back to realize there was no Plug.  I have never backed a trailer in to the water to fast in my life!!  The plug was at my house, and the boat was full of water, so I un-hooked the trailer and left it at the launch to drain while I drove home to get the plug.  I lived just around the corner from the launch...  I have also dropped my brand new LED mag light down the hole while ice fishing at night.  Spend an hour trying to jig it up..  20 FOW, so I could see the light on the entire time...  (is that illegal??)  Trailered my sled up to go crappie fishing one cold winter day, and realized after pulling the sled off the trailer, that I forgot my winter boots at home, so I fished the entire day in running shoes.  I wrapped a towel around my feet to keep warm.  I had latches on the inside and outside of my hut door.  And the inside latch some how bounced in to the lock position when trailering behind my sled.  So I had to lift my hut up, then carefully walk under the hut, line my body up with the hole in the floor, and slowly let it down on myself.  Good thing my hut is light!   There's more,  I just can't remember them all."
885850,mike rousseau,2014-12-10 18:21:00,4661,I've done that as well... 4-5 hours running in the parking lot... Lol
885851,Joey,2014-12-10 18:21:00,9122,"One year, while fishing for Salmon on a river up north, not a big river, lots of traffic, so when there was nobody around, I had to take a pee and as soon as the last boat went around the bend, I whipped down my pants and went over the side of the boat for a tinkle.  Sure enough, a boat comes around the bend before I finished.  As they passed by they said ""Nice moon"" hahahahaha."
885858,Headhunter,2014-12-10 18:45:00,5703,I bought a floating fillet knife. We were out on Long Point Bay and I mention to my buddy that my new fillet knife floats. So I hang it over the side and let go... it sank like a stone! Apparently it only floats when it's not in the sheath! Never got to use it once! HH
885859,adam lancia,2014-12-10 18:47:00,234,"I was fishing from shore in August and the spot I was in was pretty dense with small trees and bushes. There was a small clearing to get to the water, but in order to cast, I had to stand on some rocks which where slightly above the waterline. They were dry for the most part and the water was only a foot deep. I fished for 5 hours without a mishap... until I got a phone call. I had just cast so I was switching the phone to my other hand so I could retrieve my lure when I forgot how to use my hands. Turns out a Galaxy S2 will work after it dries out, it'll just do it's own thing rather than what you're telling it to do..."
885864,glenner,2014-12-10 19:25:00,56,"Was away fishing with my two buddies, went down to the dock early in the morning to get in a couple of casts while waiting for them to  go out for the day. I always sit in the front seat when we fish so it's my job to tie up the bow. I guess when we came in from the evening fish the night before, it was real dark so I didn't notice how much slack I left in the bow line. When I stepped in with one foot, of course the boat swung away from the dock, leaving me doing the severe splits with one foot in the boat and one foot on the dock about 5 feet away. While I'm trying to figure out how the heck to get out of this, my two buddies come around the corner and start laughing so hard I thought they would choke. After a couple of minutes I realized that there was no way out, so i just stepped off the dock into the river with the one foot and then swung the other one into the water up tp my waist. As I marcehd up the hill, dripping water from the waist down, I could still hear them laughing. My friend who owns the boat decided that my new name for the trip would be Aquaman"
885868,BillM,2014-12-10 20:21:00,17367,"Glenner, your story reminds me of when I failed to tie up the boat two summers ago on White Otter Lake.  Sand beach, awesome camping site, we had 6 people there, so 3 boats.  I beached our boat to the far right, my buddy Al's boat to the left and Steve's boat to the left of his.  Super crazy storm that night, howling winds, just one of those crazy nights.  I wake up at about 3am and gotta take a leak.  I walk down to the water with my flashlight and the boat isn't there.  I'm thinking, this isn't good our Lund is now up on some rocks getting smashed to bits because I forgot to tie the damn thing off!!!!!  I look over and it is snuggled nicely inbetween Al and Steves boat, even had the bumpers out so zero scratches.  I laughed good and hard at that one (And didn't bother telling the oldman either!)  Don't ask me how that even happened, the physics behind it just make me shake my head."
885870,bigugli,2014-12-10 20:25:00,6138,I have a habit of finding the rotten board on the dock.  My son has his own special curse while icefishing. If there is any open water nearby he will find it.

885875,chris.brock,2014-12-10 21:18:00,4053," French River, big group.  It's me and my buddies day to do dinner. We put 2 big blocks of frozen chicken thighs on one side of the BBQ, turn the other burner on low, close the lid and head out fishing for the evening.  We stayed out longer than we thought. Boating back into camp, it looked like a bunch of people huddled around a campfire.  Coming closer we could tell it was other people from camp trying to extinguish our fully engulfed, flaming BBQ.  The other guys weren't too impressed with hot dogs that night."
885877,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-10 21:32:00,8243,"Theres a few, demonstrating the new fangled rod "" The Ugly Stick"" you can't break it, watch boys just like on TV, SNAP!! They're howling, that don't happen on TV.  Played around all winter tinkering around with an old office swivel chair I could mount on any tinny seat turning a 500 buck 12 footer into a fishing machine. Played it up all spring and bragged about it on and on the 7 plus hour trip to the camp. The first day out for Pic opening I have it mounted up front. First time I turn around to look at my pal who's driving the weld breaks I fly backwards and get jammed in the hull, can not move I'm stuck. Legs strait up and ass jammed in tight. Had to go to shore to get unjammed. He made me stay that way for far too long. I took heat all week, they all wanted to know when they are going to be mass produced and, and, and.  Those were in front of friends so really not embarrassing just feeling stupid.  This was embarrassing. Just this past September our first trip to Mashkinonje Lodge. Launch the boat and putt over to the cottages slip. Plug, who needs a stinkin' plug. I'm yelling to my wife who is chatting with Goldie and her little boy, help, help like a little girl, they come running over and I'm bailing like mad but the water is coming over the transom faster than I can bail. Goldie who is one smart cookie and my new hero runs and gets a submersible and tosses it in. So there we are, My wife, Goldie there little son of 6 or so and I crowded on the bow of the boat to keep the transom above water. She had called Reagan that was out fishing to come and help this idiot customer that hasn't been there for 15 minutes and makes an idiot of himself after I begged her not to as I'm embarrassed enough. Who's in the boat with Reagan who unnecessarily came to the rescue, Italo Labignon. I ask Italo, ""it's never happened to you before I guess?"" without looking up he replies,,,,,nope."
885878,206,2014-12-10 21:33:00,563,"Long story short, had been under the weather a few days got up on a holiday Monday by noon felt great, took daughter out on Rice. few hours out and to far for a 20hp to make it to launch i cramp up bad and shoot over toward a small island....no sooner i have my pants around my ankles this old couple come around the corner....She is reading a book he just continues to cast lol. impressively i manage to squirt it onto a rag in the bottom of my tinny! To this day I have no idea if they saw what was unfolding  but my daughter is still traumatized.  Yes I sheet in my boat"
885880,chris.brock,2014-12-10 21:39:00,4053," Albany River  Heading back to camp, everybody feeling good, full throttle, I just happened to be looking at my brother and cousin in the other boat. They ran over a native gill net, it hooked the skeg, and they went from 20 mph to a stand still in about 10 feet. Them and everything else in the boat ended up on the floor."

Sue wouldn't dare try to pee over the side so if she does need to go she just uses the live well (I take any fish out LOL) then I just turn on the pump and flush it out. Might be a good one to keep in mind"
885894,Rod Caster,2014-12-10 23:22:00,5784,"I was fishing a small remote lake, thought I was alone and was singing out loud. Someone in a canoe turned the corner without me noticing until he was within 100 feet. Stopped singing, said hi and avoided further eye contact."
885898,manitoubass2,2014-12-10 23:43:00,11391,"my dad caught a good pike 2 summers ago and tried to get a pic. a bald eagle took a few runs at him and the pics turned out hilarious(my step mom has em or id think about sharing them lol).  i didnt hear this story until fishing walleye one day, we get a limit and on the way back to the landing we stop on this mud flat and cast for some pike.  we are catching almost every cast, just having fun with smallish pike. I notice a baldie up on a branch watching and mention it as im about to take out my phone for a few pics. next thing i know im half in the bottom of the boat as my dad fired up the boat and decided to take off full tilt...  i guess he doesnt like eagles anymore lol"
885901,Big Cliff,2014-12-11 00:00:00,6899,"Not fishing related but I have had plenty of them. I had a fantastic bird dog, a GSP. Andy was a champion both in show and in the field, he won so many awards we have a wall full of them.  A friend who was also a photographer had asked me if we could take Andy out to do some field work because she needed some photographs for a project she was working on. No problem, Andy knows his stuff and I'm an excellent shot (she wanted shots of everything) so we load up and away we go.  Beautiful day sun is shining we get to the area I want to hunt and let Andy out while I get my stuff ready, then it happened; I realize that I had grabbed my 20 ga by mistake but I had brought my 12 gauge shells, we are miles from the nearest place I can buy ammo.  Then, to top it off Andy is nowhere to be seen, I start looking for him and sure enough he is locked up solid on point on a beautiful male phesent. I flushed the bird and poor Andy just stood there looking at me like I was nuts because I didn't even fire at it.  I think I really broke his heart when I I loaded all of us back into the car for the ride home. I have to say I was pretty embarrised!"
