Looks like it might be good for ice fishing, a change from the tip-up flags and the mess of line lying on the ice..  http://www.lightinthebox.com/electronic-led-light-fish-bite-sound-alarm-alert-bell-clip-on-fishing-rod-black_p1532060.html?currency=CAD&litb_from=paid_adwords_DISPLAY&gclid=CNj_lonXysICFe1cMgodNyUAxA"
886969,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 13:43:00,956,Looks good.  May get one when I go carp fishing.
886999,Fisherman,2014-12-16 15:09:00,7201,"Catching fishermen, I used to use a little clip on bell, first good hook set and it flipped off the rod, did a 2 and a half backflip and right down the hole."
887036,Mike Pike,2014-12-16 17:10:00,1332,"Not very much different from the bite alarms we use carp fishing, other than this alarm clips to the rod itself, and not on a carp pod that the rod rests on.  Interesting though, and looks like it would be very usesful for carp and cat guys.  I hope the alarm doesn't keep sounding the whole time you're fighting a fish, though.  That would be annoying."
887127,chris.brock,2014-12-16 23:50:00,4053," There was a carp report, awesome edited video, ducks eating the corn on the underwater GoPro etc, what alarm was that, same as this one?  I am also thinking ice fishing applications"
