886466,davey buoy,2014-12-13 23:25:00,5505,"Amazing!,How many times I drive out in the country and wonder what might be in some of those barns I pass. Interesting to see how this all unfolds."
886468,lew,2014-12-13 23:48:00,12766,"Never could understand folks who have nice things and just let them rot away. If you don't want to sell them, why not give them to folks who would appreciate them."
886471,Whopper,2014-12-14 00:49:00,2174,"I saw that earlier this week, what a shame for most of those cars. The two in the garage are the money pieces, I believe one was one of three made and is worth between 10 and 15 million if I remember correctly.  Had a guy in the area that was a horder, amassed a nice collection of early Mustangs, most sat in the same space for over 30 years, most sat and rusted. His property along with a bunch of land around him was annexed by a small town and after a couple years he was made made to clean up a eye sore he created."
886473,irishfield,2014-12-14 01:01:00,26272,"Issue is a lot of guys have ""plans"" for things and just get too damn old before they can see them through to completion. Oh well, his Estate is going to do well when some of those go to auction."
886489,Freshtrax,2014-12-14 03:18:00,2215,I see your point but many of those cars wouldn't be worth what they are today 15 years ago. No matter what shape there in.
886493,irishfield,2014-12-14 04:09:00,26272,Wish my father had of left this $5700 (in '71) car in a barn for me to find..  http://www.rkmotorscharlotte.com/sales/inventory/active#!/1971-Plymouth-Cuda/133269

886513,creditmaster,2014-12-14 13:37:00,190,what a shame  people need to stop hoarding and killing beautiful cars
886515,Roy,2014-12-14 13:43:00,13728,"what a shame  people need to stop hoarding and killing beautiful cars  Yeah, some poor cars even get dragged behind trucks."
886518,Steelheadphycho,2014-12-14 14:22:00,470,How does a collection like that get forgotten for decades. let alone the compound its on.  breath taking and astonishing
