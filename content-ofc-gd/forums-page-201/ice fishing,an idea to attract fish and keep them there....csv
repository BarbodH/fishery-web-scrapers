886397,123chadder,2014-12-13 17:00:00,165,"have you ever seen a ball of smelt or herring go through your hole and a trout wizzing through stunning and eating baitfish?its quite the site...i chum when i fish and it simply works...what if you were to take clear fine mesh,something easily plyable, filled it with minnows and sent it down a hole a couple feet from the hole you are fishing in,i think it would work very well in attracting fish! maybe even put one small hole in the mesh,so one minnow could escape at a time,the mesh bag would take quite a while to lose all the minnows....sort of like a slow release chumming system"
886398,BillM,2014-12-13 17:03:00,17367,Use an umbrella rig under the ice instead.  
886401,123chadder,2014-12-13 17:05:00,165,"not the same,i could fish an umbrella rig while i have the bag down too!"
886403,BillM,2014-12-13 17:14:00,17367,"If you do this on Simcoe, the herring would most likely take care of those minnows in about 3 seconds     Try it out though, get it on video!"
886404,123chadder,2014-12-13 17:16:00,165,"its a thought,i know it would work for perch. im going to rig something up"
886406,Woodsman,2014-12-13 17:31:00,1286,"A simular tactic has been used for years. Fill a glass jar(just small enough to fit through the hole)with water & a few minnows. Put a small hole in the lid & run a cord through it and tie some sort of stop(knot, washer, sinker ect)inside the lid. Also put a few extra small holes to let air excape. Attach lid and lower under the ice."

886421,123chadder,2014-12-13 18:43:00,165,"well i made up a new bait and technique for perch(didnt invent bait,its been around for millions of years) last year,just on a thought,now nobody outfishes me for perch ever!  it kills perch even when they are slow  If you do this on Simcoe, the herring would most likely take care of those minnows in about 3 seconds     Try it out though, get it on video! well if it brings herring in the trout will follow...."
886472,Paudash,2014-12-14 00:58:00,273,great idea but is it legal?
886476,Woodsman,2014-12-14 01:20:00,1286,If it's set up to allow minnows to excape it is not legal.
886481,123chadder,2014-12-14 02:27:00,165,"ill have to look into that,someone on another board says its illegal."
886482,dhickey,2014-12-14 02:32:00,1038,123 Its illegal No doubt absolutely .
886486,Terry,2014-12-14 02:39:00,14456,"Ontario for use as bait.NO RELEASE OF BAITIt is illegal to release any live bait or dump the contents of a bait bucket, including the water, into any waters or within 30 m of any waters (see page 13).BAITFISH"
886487,dhickey,2014-12-14 03:08:00,1038,Terry . I don't want to get into it but the regulations also include a section for chumming while ice fishing?. I know you are aware of this. It sounds like some of the new ice fishermen need to realise that it not about numbers its integrity that makes an angler. Hopefully we can meet up out there this year? Don.
