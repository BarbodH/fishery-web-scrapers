886256,wallyboss,2014-12-12 23:29:00,1095,I have a 2007 RAM TRX4 Quad Cab.  I am looking at Goodyear Duratracs 275/55R20 but what is stopping me is that size does not have an LT  or P  in front of the numbers.  I looked at the Load capacity for them compared to some LT275/70R17 and they are the same. Just wondering if these new tires would be okay for my truck??
886257,Joeytier,2014-12-12 23:34:00,3990,There are websites that will visually demonstrate tire size comparisons so you can see the difference between the two.  So long as they don't rub I don't see their being an issue
886260,wallyboss,2014-12-12 23:38:00,1095,"I am sure that the size will fit.  I am just not sure becasue of no  "" LT"" in front of the numbers."
886270,Fish Farmer,2014-12-13 00:25:00,2234,"I'm, no mechanic, but that larger tire, wouldn't it screw up you computer?"
886276,wallyboss,2014-12-13 00:44:00,1095,"what I found on a Website was  ""We recommend staying within 3% difference from overall diameter of your original (OEM) tire size when selecting an alternative size""  And the difference that I got was  -0.77 %   I used http://tireconvert.com/"
886282,Raf,2014-12-13 01:01:00,3495,"you are aware that you will need a 20"" rim for those duratracs right?  the stockers are 17"" wheels. if you have the rims, then those duratracs will be slightly smaller than the stock size. they'll fit fine but my personal prefernce is to go slightly bigger than slightly smaller. you could easily get away with a 285/55/20 or a 275/60/20"
886288,wallyboss,2014-12-13 01:12:00,1095,"Yes I have a set of 20"" rims also, thanks for that other option.   But how about the missing  "" LT"""
886297,Fisherman,2014-12-13 01:47:00,7201,"If I'm not mistaken those rubber bands won't come with an LT designation, they're not meant for load carrying capacity."
886314,wallyboss,2014-12-13 02:41:00,1095,My truck is never used for hauling stuff in the box. I have a trailer for hauling stuff.  Just trying to figure out if I need the LT Designation.
886315,Freshtrax,2014-12-13 02:52:00,2215,Nope.  My super crew f150 came with p rated michelins  from the factory.   I just put a lt tire on it it rides allot stiffer.  But I plan on buying a 5000 lb boat in the spring otherwise I would not have gone lt.
886318,irishfield,2014-12-13 02:58:00,26272,"I think every 1/2 ton I've owned.. GMC or Ford ... since 1995 has had P rated tires on it.. Goodyear Wranglers.. Michelins..  Ameritracs.. The only time the tire shop went ""we should have put LT's on that"" was when I told them I plow with my '98... for the stiffer side walls of an LT to carry the blade weight."
886320,wallyboss,2014-12-13 03:07:00,1095,"Thanks guys, that is great info. By the way I will probably go 275/60R20 (thanks RAF)"
886343,Joeytier,2014-12-13 04:26:00,3990,Duratracs are E rated tire I believe.  More than capable of hauling for a halfton
