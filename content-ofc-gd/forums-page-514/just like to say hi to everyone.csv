601770,aplumma,2011-07-11 23:11:00,6896,"Welcome and here is a blurb that might help you post pictures.   How do I upload a pic right on the post? Below the Rich Text Editor (RTE)..thats the area you enter your text for a post...you will see a 'File Attachments' field. Click browse and navigate to the image. Then choose 'Open' fromt he file browser and 'Add this attachment'. If you have multiple images, you can select where they go by using the 'Manage Attachments' option. Put your cursor where you want the image, and select the appropriate image for that spot. Not that all uploaded images are displayed as thumbnails.   How do I include an image from another site or from the gallery into a post? It's even easier than before. Copy the image properties. In Internet Explorer, right click on the image at full size, select 'Properties' and hilight and copy (CTRL+C) the image URL. Make sure to get the image URL and not the page URL. In FIrefox, right click the image then select 'Copy Image Location'. Then in your post, click the image button (looks like a little tree). A pop-up window comes up. Just press CTRL+V (or right click, paste) and the image is put into your post right away. You can even see it without having to preview first.  This should get you on the right track   Art"
