601750,bobowski,2011-07-11 22:42:00,360,I fished Georgian Bay over the Canada Day long weekend. The fishing was pretty good. I caught decent numbers but no monsters. I did a lot of fishing with the Live Target Perch crankbait and I have to say that it performed pretty well. Here are some of the fish from the weekend.   Beautiful sunset   Biggest pike of the weekend

602014,NAW,2011-07-12 15:44:00,4022,Right on man.  I'll be hitting G-Bay hopefully next weekend.  Thanks for the report.
602021,bigbuck,2011-07-12 16:15:00,2449,I'll be fishing GBay Friday afternoon if I can get up there early enough. I need an hour to get my trolling motor mount on right and I'll be hittin' the water and beatin on some bass. Nice pike BTW.
