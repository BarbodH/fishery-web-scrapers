601660,lew,2011-07-11 19:56:00,12766,"A 50"" musky last week and now a big azz bass...your havin a good time for sure !!"
601662,beginner,2011-07-11 19:59:00,542,what a hog!!
601664,Roy,2011-07-11 20:01:00,13728,A great looking chunk of fish and some pretty good looking bass water behind you there. Congrats!
601666,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-11 20:06:00,1107,Nice bucket
601713,misfish,2011-07-11 21:25:00,29133,"Love the shirt,water yer fishing too. Nice bucket.  5 lbs maybe a bit much,not to burst your bubble.4+"
601718,bdox,2011-07-11 21:31:00,329,"Nice fish, whatdid it hit?   If his measurement was correct, that fish is easily 5+."
601721,misfish,2011-07-11 21:37:00,29133,"Not going to argue it. 21 inch is a good fish. Buckets at that length can be deceiving.Where as a smallie at that lenght, with big shoulder, can go 7. Just saying.    Still a great fish  walleye_man."
601730,walleye_man,2011-07-11 21:53:00,135,  my last 5 pounder was also 21 inches if i can remeber correctly and that one was 5.5 it could be a nickle or not im happy no matter what she was a big fat fish  and i got her on a spro popper frog in that big pocket behind me in the 2nd pic
601734,fishindude,2011-07-11 22:14:00,220,"Very chunky, very nice  Congrats!"
601738,mercman,2011-07-11 22:27:00,7054,Nice one for sure. Gotta love them bucket hawgs  Congrats
601783,Live2fish85,2011-07-11 23:21:00,1633,"Nice one man, your on a roll this year by the looks of it. Keep it going and keep the pics coming."
601785,peter23,2011-07-11 23:23:00,95,thats a fat one nice job
601847,Rod Caster,2011-07-12 01:25:00,5784,"I'm almost up to 5, 1-pounders this year. That pretty much puts us in the same league.  All kidding aside, that's a beauty, this might end up being a record year for you! keep it up."
601854,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-12 01:37:00,2585,nice fish!  I would say its close to 5.  I have seen 5lbs bass that are in the 21 22 inch range.  Best way to figur eit out is to get a scale  Cheers!
601886,grimsbylander,2011-07-12 02:18:00,3016,Looks like a 5 lb smile on your face!!!! Congrats bud that's a fish any of us would be proud of!
602071,Cudz,2011-07-12 20:41:00,2652,"Nice pig for sure. I caught one almost exactly the same 2 weeks ago.  It was 21"" and it was thick.  I weighed it and it was 5.2 pounds.  I did not post its weight because I did not want any issues. Either way I was happy with the fish and I can see you are too.  That spot looks very familiar to me but since the comorants have taken roost nearby the fishing havs not been the same in the past 2-3 years."
602087,ehg,2011-07-12 21:41:00,2666,Think that 5 lbs. or so is about right judging from other responses. Keep up the good year your having so far. Usually the fish are bigger and weigh more as fall approaches.
602201,Cypher,2011-07-13 03:42:00,20,Very nice catch. Keep up the good work
602318,johnnyb,2011-07-13 19:06:00,3413,4+ or 5...doesn't matter...that's a gorgeous bass!  Well done man!!!
