Any spot suggestions , bait suggestions. ? Anything?"
600945,BiggFish,2011-07-09 14:35:00,40,I fish Paris to Brantford weekly in a canoe and jerkbaits in greens and silvers 4 inches in size.  Also Live target perch coloured cranks.  Lots of Bass between 1-2.5 lbs caugh each trip.  I think the key is to throw somethign you can cover alot of water with.  Chad

600975,laszlo,2011-07-09 17:41:00,487,"I would think that since the water is very low and warming up, there are less fish around."
600983,Broker,2011-07-09 18:27:00,482,Do you how i could find some fish?
600995,Live2fish85,2011-07-09 20:13:00,1633,"Looking is a good way to find them lol, But I stopped down there the other day at the York bridge on the way to my parents and caught 2 smallies there in a matter of 15 mins then went and got tons on Erie."
600996,Broker,2011-07-09 20:17:00,482,Did you fish under the bridge?
601149,The JAY,2011-07-10 15:27:00,239,Going to try wading around the bridge with the whippy stuff this evening....
602000,Motorhead,2011-07-12 15:12:00,163," Having lived in York since 1972, I`m gonna have to call BULL on this one.... There is NO possible way you can troll from York to Cayuga... Float downstream Ok but trolling no way...  Want to catch fish??? Try the mouth of McKenzie Creek  Doug"
