Within dropping my 3rd line we struct chrome I made sure it was hooked and let the young lad hawl it in. Once it was close to the boat both I and miller handled the landing. I didnt want to disapoint the lad and made sure he had a pic of himself with the biggest of the day That there in itself made my long weekend complete. HE can continue on once he joins our wacky world of fishing "

As for the lad, I didnt realize till a few days after how much it meant to him. So polite, he asked the captain if he can step aboard Hes going to make a great sea cadet one day, in my books.  "
