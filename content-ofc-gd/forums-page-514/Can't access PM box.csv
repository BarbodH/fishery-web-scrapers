602308,lew,2011-07-13 18:47:00,12766,When I try to access my PM's and open the drop down box at the top right corner of the page it goes straight to my profile every time. This just started happening yesterday so I'm guessing a setting has changed somewhere.  Any ideas ??
602309,bucktail,2011-07-13 18:51:00,1857,Lew.. did you upgrade your internet explorer. I had the same issue when i did that and still do.
602310,irishfield,2011-07-13 18:52:00,26272,Workin fine for me here at the hospital on their old HP...
602312,lew,2011-07-13 18:54:00,12766,I just got a new computer Darren and it came with IE9.  I think my old machine was IE7.
602313,Spiel,2011-07-13 18:58:00,9065,"Google Chrome or Firefox Lew, problem solved."
602321,lew,2011-07-13 19:10:00,12766, I tried to install Firefox yesterday Chris but it wouldn't install as it said I had an unspecified error.
602325,Spiel,2011-07-13 19:19:00,9065," Can't help you with that Lew.  I'm using Google Chrome here, much slicker and faster than IE, perhaps try that installing it.   "
602339,Grimace,2011-07-13 19:43:00,2020,Google chrome is way faster and never freezes.
602350,lew,2011-07-13 20:05:00,12766,"Well, that's very interesting, I just downloaded Google Chrome as suggested and sure enough, it solved the problem with my PM's. And not only that, it solved a problem I posted a few days ago about none of my pages opening to full size.  Everything I open now is working well and even a couple other issues I had have been fixed, so thanks for the tip Chris !!"
602429,skeeter,2011-07-13 23:42:00,1907,"I too was having the same problems as you Lew. I just loaded google chrome and it fixed the pm problem, that I have had for months.  Now im trying to figure out how to get a tool bar up with spell check,auto fill and a couple other things on it."
