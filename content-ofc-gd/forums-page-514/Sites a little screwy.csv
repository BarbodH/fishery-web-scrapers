602219,Roy,2011-07-13 11:16:00,13728,"Yes the domain change was a little sudden but we're doing the best we can and appreciate your patience and cooperation. I don't think that giving a month's notice would have changed a whole lot. But hey, that just my opinion. Trust me when I say that we're doing the best we can."
602232,Fisherman,2011-07-13 12:28:00,7201,"If those little buttons were any smaller, nothing would happen, nobody could see them."
602242,irishfield,2011-07-13 13:25:00,26272,The blue page has full size icons exactly like it was in the past...
602253,misfish,2011-07-13 14:55:00,29133,"No it,s not.Fibber."
602259,irishfield,2011-07-13 15:26:00,26272,Looks like it depends on the computer. It's exactly as it was using Jen's computer with the well marked icon buttons and here at the hospital I'm seeing the little tiny icons instead.
602263,TJQ,2011-07-13 16:34:00,7806,"To be honest I asked the host what it would take to do a domain name change. and they just went ahead and did it, so now Im scambling to get everything back in its place. Im working on it."
602269,mercman,2011-07-13 17:07:00,7054,  
602311,johnnyb,2011-07-13 18:53:00,3413,"Ha!  I never noticed the pinned message...thought the site was down for a record period of time 	Tried coming in thru Google yesterday...that was a no-go.  My ""favourites"" link worked today though....and I haven't updated it.  "
602316,Rod Caster,2011-07-13 19:01:00,5784," Ha, that'll light a fire under anyones butt"
602377,Jer,2011-07-13 21:09:00,1426,"I'm using the ""club"" skin and everything works just dandy..."
602406,Big Cliff,2011-07-13 22:11:00,6899,"Between the site being down and my internet connection being down I never know what is going on anymore! This explains why I all of a sudden ended up with a whole new look at the site though, I just changed everything back to club view and just thought it was my computer that messed up."
602430,misfish,2011-07-13 23:44:00,29133,"Dont you have a beagle to walk? Why are you here?   My edit is alot faster,but I see small icons and nothing else. Good thing I know where Im going in the dark."
602432,TJQ,2011-07-13 23:51:00,7806,"Ive got all the redirects done so anyone going to the old site will get here automatically, even if they find the old site in google. Thanks to Dana for the quick fix... a snippet of code that would have taken me hours to get right, lol.lol ill be working on the missing graphics shortly, i think someone mentioned they were being referenced to the old domain name so ill be investigating that next. I think ill also make the club skin the default so its least confusing as its the one that people use the most."
602435,lplp,2011-07-13 23:56:00,83,"I didnt think i was on the right site until i signed in,, liked the old one,, but will get use to it.. no biggy"
602127,misfish,2011-07-13 00:16:00,29133,Not up to par. Anyone else? Just a FYI for ya boss.
602132,e-z-out,2011-07-13 00:21:00,1052,the sites gives me lots of errors or kicks me off and asks me to sigh back in
602133,misfish,2011-07-13 00:23:00,29133, Have you seen my bro ? He seems to be MIA?
602134,e-z-out,2011-07-13 00:24:00,1052,last time i saw him was 2 years ago and that's no lie Ever since he gave up ice fishing
602135,Terry,2011-07-13 00:24:00,14456,I have not had any problems  well except the boat and that is a whole different story
602136,e-z-out,2011-07-13 00:25:00,1052,  Terry time for a new boat brake out the gas can and burn that bad dream
602138,misfish,2011-07-13 00:28:00,29133,"  I see a legend in is future.   Hell, you seen him more then me."
602140,danbouck,2011-07-13 00:29:00,4380,No problems here
602142,e-z-out,2011-07-13 00:33:00,1052,  your kidding me right? it's only a 2 hour drive to see him B  He comes on from time to time adds his 2 cents and goes back to what ever he was doing.
602147,mercman,2011-07-13 00:46:00,7054,"Things seem a little blurry.Colors seem to be bleeding together               No, wait.....Put the wifes glasses on by accident Nope, its fine"
602159,Tdel,2011-07-13 01:36:00,393,I didn't know the web address for OFC was going to change. I had to do a little searching to find the new address.  Maybe some people are wondering why they can't connect to OFC like I was or maybe I am the only one.  Tom.
602160,Terry,2011-07-13 01:48:00,14456,it was pinned to the top of the page that the domain changed
602163,irishfield,2011-07-13 01:57:00,26272,Yay Terry... for about 5 hours. lol
602165,Tdel,2011-07-13 02:00:00,393," If you aren't on the net and you don't know the website is going to change to a different address, then how can you read the about the domain change.  Even a mass email would have helped.  Tom."
602167,mercman,2011-07-13 02:03:00,7054,we have a built in homeing mechanism/gps that brings us back every time.
602170,NAW,2011-07-13 02:04:00,4022,"I guess cuz of the domain change, but when I try to open the site through my ""favorites"" is didn't work.  Had to delete the old one, and put a new one in.  No big deal, all is good now."
602171,Fisherman,2011-07-13 02:05:00,7201,"No you weren't the only one, I thought the website was down and had to go hunting. Now there's just the itty bitty dinky little things at the bottom of the page to click on for ""add a reply and quote""."
602172,Tdel,2011-07-13 02:06:00,393,  Ah!  One of the in crowd.
602174,mercman,2011-07-13 02:16:00,7054,  Good to see you too
602187,mike rousseau,2011-07-13 03:01:00,4661,I was worried for a couple minutes there...  I once was lost but now am found...
602189,Sinker,2011-07-13 03:06:00,8692,"Its a little wonky for me too. I am missing some text, and some images here and there. I just have little icons like Fisherman said for reply and quote.  S."
602196,kickingfrog,2011-07-13 03:22:00,8333, That's pure logic.  Although I think things sometimes happen too fast to give everyone a proper heads-up.
602210,Cudz,2011-07-13 04:27:00,2652,I had no clue things were going to change.  There should be a link from the old page to the new.  I suspect lots of people can't find this site now.
602211,Tdel,2011-07-13 06:33:00,393,  Amen.  Tom
602216,Billy Bob,2011-07-13 10:42:00,5865,I just went fishing for the new site and snagged it within seconds....
