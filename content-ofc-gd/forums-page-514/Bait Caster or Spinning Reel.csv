601516,BucktownAngler,2011-07-11 15:47:00,582,"I agree, don't cheap out on a baitcaster. Spinning you can and will be fine"
601524,Bass Assassin,2011-07-11 16:04:00,23,I don't like to cheap out on any type of reel or rod i like to go all out I like spinning reels because that's what I've been using for years but on all the t.v shows and tournaments all the pros are using bait casters and i don't understand why because what every you can do with a bait caster you can do with a spinning reel. I see that there is so thing u can do with a bait caster like thumbing the line but i find you would get more birds nests and tangles. There has to be something amazing about bait casters for everybody to be using them over spinning reels.
601541,BucktownAngler,2011-07-11 16:42:00,582,Its already been mentioned. Baitcaster is more accurate casting. You have more control. Me personally its feels better using a baitcaster. Trolling/casting whatever. I can do more casting and retrieving w my baitcaster then my spinning reel in the same amount of time. Its a more natural motion
601542,BucktownAngler,2011-07-11 16:43:00,582,Google baitcaster vs spinning and you will get all the pros and cons of each
601629,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-11 18:50:00,0,the only answer is that you need both to be a complete angler. if you want an all around combo i would get a spinning.
601651,PainInTheBass,2011-07-11 19:37:00,102,"You don't need to use a baitcaster simply because you see the pros using them.  If you do decide to learn to use them, it should be for the right reasons.  Although one can become accurate with spinning reels via feathering the spool on a cast, thumbing the spool allows one to have that much more control over the distance of a cast and cast placement.  Baitcasters are offered in a much larger variety of retrieve ratios, which have benefits to different fishing techniques.  To some (me) baitcasters are more comfortable to fish all day.  I tend to find baitacster combos more balanced and more comfortable to fish in general.  And, they are just plain fun.  I recently built a light action baitcasting rod to all but replace my spinning combo lol.  Oh, and as others have said, don't cheap out on a baitcasters, it may come back to haunt you.  Around $100 is a good starting point."
602207,adolson,2011-07-13 04:04:00,783," $100 for the reel? Or for the rod + reel? This combo on the shelf is regular $130 for the pair... I went to look at it again tonight but they're sold out. I looked at a couple others that were on the rack, but the only ones that felt as good or as solid (hard to say how they'd feel with line on the reel and casting and whatnot) were the same brand, and maybe $10 more for the combo. There was only one standalone baitcaster reel in the store, and I don't know the price exactly. I think $80, but can't recall for sure.  WalMart had zero baitcaster reels or combos when I looked yesterday.  My spinning setup is a 7' Ugly Stik and Shimano (forget the model) reel that I got for I think $50 each many (17-18 I think) years ago. The reel has the large Fightin' Drag feature that I don't see on the reels in the stores around here anymore. One thing I noticed about all the baitcaster rods I looked at was they're all pretty stiff in comparison to my rod. I suppose that's fairly normal?"
602358,PainInTheBass,2011-07-13 20:20:00,102,"  I am talking about the reel alone.  Some of the features that I want in a baitcaster are aluminum frame to resist any sort of frame warping over long term, and to ensure that the gears remain in alignment.  I also want to make sure that there are as few plastic parts in the reels as possible since these will go more quickly than aluminum or other metal parts.  For me, the delineation point has been around $100 for reels.  baitcasters below that price point don't seem to last as long generally.  To buy above your budget, consider used, and buying from forums such as this.  You can get much better quality if you are willing to by used.  edit: in general, baitcaster rods are heavier in power due to the intended techniques/applications vs spinning rods.  However, they do make heavier powered spinning rods and lighter powered baitcasting rods - they are just fewer and further between."
601257,Bass Assassin,2011-07-10 23:25:00,23,What are the advantages of a bait caster reel over a spinning reel? and what situations is it better to use a bait caster reel than a spinning reel?

It really is a preference and not necessarily an advantage/disadvantage  thing.Depends on what and how you fish."
601300,Bass Assassin,2011-07-11 01:03:00,23,ahh just a couple threads ive only posted 2 or 3 i cant see why there would be a problem here im only asking some questions
601302,BillM,2011-07-11 01:09:00,17367, A couple of threads from someone with 11 posts total.  Think about that ratio for a second.
601306,Pikeslayer,2011-07-11 01:17:00,1443," Umm, there is no problem here Shad. You can ask all you want. Some members will choose to help you, others well... Here's my quick 2 cents; Spincasters are ease to use and are sufficient for most applications. Baitcasters are less easy to use but definitely enhance your casting accuracy and ability once you have mastered them. I'm pretty sure some of our more experienced members have much to add.  Slayer"
601307,danbouck,2011-07-11 01:17:00,4380,nice fish!
601326,fish_fishburn,2011-07-11 01:37:00,1311,"Don't mind them guys,,, it is more of a personal preference.  I like to use baitcasters most of the time because I like the low profile and like to palm the reel. Also most of my fishing is river fishing, so lots of casting with plastics and crankbaits. For finese fishing, drop shotting I like a spinning reel. Skipping tubes under docks calls for the spinning reel as well.  I do skip tubes with my baitcasters but your reel has to be really dialed in or you will have a mess in no time. My buddies look at me weird when they see me doing it.  For trolling I will use both but will move up to larger reels, like curado 300 or stradic 4000, cause I am usually using larger lures and fishing deeper and using 7' H action rods. A Medium action is as light as I go for trolling.  For shore fishing in strong current I prefer my baitcaster because I have more control free spooling the line. For creeks and small water a 5' lite to ulra light with a small spinning reel, great for casting light gear. Like Mercman said it more preference, and to what type of fishing you do most. This is my opinion and there are lots more out there, but this is comfortable for me for the type of fishing I do.  Hope this helps ya out."
601360,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-11 02:25:00,4399,Whats`s a snacher?
601370,mercman,2011-07-11 02:37:00,7054,  You`re bad....
601371,irishfield,2011-07-11 02:39:00,26272,Thats an adjective of the noun.. correct?
601377,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-07-11 02:49:00,535,"I used to be strictly a spinning reel guy, didn't want the hassle of learning how to use a baitcaster. I liked using a spinning reel, it's what I grew up on. But last month I gave in and bought my first baitcaster for musky/pike (abu garcia revo toro winch) and I love it. I'll probably buy a baitcaster for bass fishing in the future but I've already got 2 good spinning reels for that right now so I'm not in a rush. I wanted to get into musky so I kind of had to give in and give a baitcaster a chance and I'm glad I did. I shouldn't have been so closed minded lol. It takes a bit to get used to casting one but it's much more fluid motion. I do like spinning reels for jigging though, just feels comfortable to me.  Just make sure you feel comfortable with whatever you go with, try it out first if you're able to."
601378,irishfield,2011-07-11 02:49:00,26272,Not sure Gord.. so dehydrated after our walk our fingers are swollen and we can't make fists smaller than a pint glass!  Baitcast.. for burning baits.. large baits etc. Spinning reel.. for everything else!
601379,splashhopper,2011-07-11 02:52:00,2931,ask away Shad..... this site has been very helpful for me....  No such thing as a dumb question either.....
601380,Bass Assassin,2011-07-11 02:52:00,23,Thanks for the great opinion's guys they will be very useful to me and a snacher well its just like snatcher but more of a redneck way aha like calling a fish a shad for instance.
601406,adolson,2011-07-11 05:27:00,783,"I was wondering this same thing, actually, because I was in Canadian Tire yesterday and saw a combo on for 50% off, regular $130. It's Quantum, Zebco, I dunno, something like that, and I did some reading afterwards and seems like people have bad things to say about the brand and combos in general. But I loved how it felt in my hands (the reel, more than the rod). I compared it with a Shakespeare baitcast combo on the shelf and didn't like that one nearly as much. I didn't buy it, but I'm definitely interested in a baitcaster now, to complement my Ugly Stick and Shimano spinner setup that I've been monogamous with for close to two decades (though it hadn't seen much use for a while, there)."
601415,singingdog,2011-07-11 10:24:00,1047, Too late!  Baitcasters are great when pinpoint accuracy is necessary (casting to cover). Spinning reels are great for lighter baits and open water where distance may be more important than accuracy. Baitcasters are also good for making a seemingly competent angler look like a complete idiot for several months.
601419,mercman,2011-07-11 11:00:00,7054," if you want to try something new, an inexpensive, brand name combo is the way to go. They have most of the bells and whistles as the high end equipment, and you dont have to put a ton of cash on the line."
601432,Bassaholic,2011-07-11 12:03:00,74, Going the inexpensive route with a baitcaster is a bad idea. A cheap baitcaster will perform a lot worse than a cheap spinner no matter how skilled you are at using it. My advice is to always spend the most you can and then a little extra on a baitcaster. Because then you know if you cant cast its your skill and not because its a cheap pos walmart special.
601447,lew,2011-07-11 13:00:00,12766," I agree 100%, if your gonna buy a baitcaster get a good one to start with or you'll have nothing but problems and will end up spending more for a good reel anyhow.  Nothing worse than trying to learn something new with inferior gear."
601454,Bass Assassin,2011-07-11 13:17:00,23,what skills do you have to learn to use a bait caster? Why is it so much harder to use?
601499,umKthxbye,2011-07-11 15:01:00,247,"I started low cost with a shimano caenan reel and abu Garcia vendetta. Just started using it this year and haven't toutched my spinning outfit since.  The skills they are referring to is thumbing the spool to control the speed that your line comes off the spool. It takes a little while to get it down but after you do, it awesome. Start with your breaks on all the way and the spool tension tight but not so tight that it goes no where.  Once your comfortable losen the spool tension till your bait free falls. Adjust the spool tension so when the free falling bait hits the ground or water the spool stops.  This is how I tough my self. I also looked at YouTube videos."
601507,lew,2011-07-11 15:16:00,12766," It doesn't take any special skills to use and isn't really any harder to use than a spinning reel, although some folks make it sound like rocket science. Just think of it as another tool in the box.  Simply learn how the adjustments work, start off slow and practise will make you a pro before you know it."
601508,Raf,2011-07-11 15:20:00,3495,"some tips on learning to use a baitcaster:  use heavier line (mono or braid) 12lb+ mono, 30lb+ braid - alot more user friendly.  once you get used to it, you can go lighter.  use heavier lures - easier to learn to cast using heavier baits, same as above.  particularly when there's a breath of wind.  once you get used to it, you can start using lighter lures.  never go cheap on a baitcaster.  and once you go baitcast you'll never go back for casting most lures.  a spinning reel is still a great tool for jiggin or casting light baits."
