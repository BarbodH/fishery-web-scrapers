Was out fishing lake cameron on the weekend, got out nice and early sat morning.  The surprise of the day was catching my first musky about half an hour into fishing.  ended up catching about 5-6 bass and the musky, all were caught on pink senko (the fish were loving that thing)  anyways enjoy the couple of pics  "
