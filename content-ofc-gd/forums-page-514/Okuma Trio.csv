601807,Bass Assassin,2011-07-12 00:10:00,23,Whats your Opinions on the Okuma trio? I came across this spinning reel as I was looking at Shimano stradic reels. I've been told that the Okuma Trio is the top of the line and is a reel like no other. Im looking into this reel and want to know if it would be a good decision to buy it.

Multiple ""question"" post are annoying but someone send him a PM with some protocol and shut this one down or just let it die. Who knows, he may have some valuable info. to provde."
