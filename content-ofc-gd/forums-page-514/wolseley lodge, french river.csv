The French can be a lower unit eater, so stick to the routes Harold mentions and note his locations for dangerous rocks.  He will also provide you with a map of the area that he marks up for different types of structure, drop offs, weedbeds and spots were guys have had success.    "

I usually stay at Wolseley for a week each September, but will have to miss this year.  Been going there for several years now or so and we typically target musky only."
