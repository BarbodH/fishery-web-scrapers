601700,fishermccann,2011-07-11 21:08:00,655,"Does  the profile views # mean those that look you up or you looking others up, because mine shows over 2000 views and I have not looked up more than a dozen , I hope 2000 people have NOT checked me out. What is it see or be seen? Nice new set-up by the way, good job!"

601717,fishermccann,2011-07-11 21:27:00,655,"STOP  looking at me! And how do you have replies without views, strange."
601722,Roy,2011-07-11 21:40:00,13728, Don't flatter yourself. Your profile view gets a hit anytime someone sends you a PM and for other reasons as well.
601724,BillM,2011-07-11 21:42:00,17367,  See that van parked outside your house with the big FREE CANDY painted on the side?  .............That's Roy.   
601725,misfish,2011-07-11 21:44:00,29133,"Bill, that was funny right there.HAHAHAHAHAHA"
601731,mercman,2011-07-11 21:57:00,7054,"Strange is the key word. MY take on it is this. You join up, you offer a bit of info on yourself, whether its real or not, no one cares. Then when you start a thread like this, or post on someone elses thread, we like to see who the heck that masked man was, hence the views of your profile.Sometimes you PM them sometimes you dont. When someone drops a PM on me, like you did a while back, if i dont reognize them, i see who they are before responding, even if they never respond to the response   See...Simple."
601736,Nipfisher,2011-07-11 22:25:00,2449,I just viewed your profile because you said not to.  I'm soooo bad.

601747,aplumma,2011-07-11 22:38:00,6896,Every time you click on someones name at a post and visit the profile it is a hit. In one day I got over two hundred hits when I moderated a long time member. If you want to keep your count down just be very quiet and read a lot.   Art
