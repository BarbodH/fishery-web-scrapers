601877,rhymobot,2011-07-12 01:57:00,174,"Went here Canada day weekend. Lots of power boats with tubing and all that but saw a few bass boats out there. However, I was in an inflatable so i went 75 metres from shore at the max from the boat launch shown in this map. I think there's another launch but this one is a dirt launch with limited free parking on the dirt on N Orr Lake Rd. There's space for maybe 10-15 cars.  Orr Lake map  Close to this launch there aren't many weeds and so I was lucky to catch this guy as he was the only bite of the day between the 2 of us in 2 hours of fishing.  Definitely better off with a motor and not a dingy like me especially since it was a little breezy and I could easily drift away from shore and have a hard time paddling back though it would be easier in a canoe or kayak than a dingy.

602125,Cudz,2011-07-13 00:07:00,2652,  It is a very small lake.  That is all I am going to say.
602137,BillM,2011-07-13 00:26:00,17367,I don't think we need detailed reports about lakes this small to be honest.  The OP should use a little restraint next time.
602141,misfish,2011-07-13 00:32:00,29133,"Those that dont read the rules ,need a time out and educated.  Maybe time for,pay to play here. Just saying."
602162,Rod Caster,2011-07-13 01:57:00,5784,"He caught one fish... no big deal. Pretty much every lake on the map has at least one fish.  Maybe there's no need to say the lake name if it's a small watershed, but it's not like he reported a honey hole full of fish. I think your guys' resentement is giving it away more than anything.  To yush: I hope you didn't body slam that fish after that pose."
602169,Cudz,2011-07-13 02:03:00,2652,The lake is a small lake that is all I am going to say
602176,GBW,2011-07-13 02:22:00,8460,it is a very small lake because I know from my brother in-law.  I asked if he wanted to go fish it and he said forget it because of the size and it was a weekend and he's only 5 to 10 min. from it.  we drove a lot farther to go fishing that day.  and that was a year ago and I'm sure there is more traffic now.
602178,irishfield,2011-07-13 02:24:00,26272,Come on guys... the lake is totally ringed with homes and cottages and not a fishing destination for anyone I know in the area. Lets not blow this post out of proportion!
602179,GBW,2011-07-13 02:25:00,8460,I'm not.  just going on why my brother in-law didn't want to go.  we went for bow's instead anyway...

602188,Nipfisher,2011-07-13 03:06:00,2449,He only has a little dingy and he wanted to show his girlfriend a good time. Give the guy a break.  Go Yush. It isn't that hatrd to find smallies. There are tonnes of lakes that have them.
602320,johnnyb,2011-07-13 19:10:00,3413,  Hey -- my lady says it's not the size of my dingy that matters....it's how I use it...and she always has a good time
602332,misfish,2011-07-13 19:40:00,29133, OFC rule broken here.   I think there's another launch but this one is a dirt launch with limited free parking on the dirt on N Orr Lake Rd. There's space for maybe 10-15 cars.  Orr Lake map
602458,NAW,2011-07-14 01:26:00,4022,"I agree.  Lesson learned hopefully!  Thanks for posting Yush, just be a little more discrete next time eh."
602461,ChrisK,2011-07-14 01:36:00,2772, Thanks for being good sports about this guys. I'm sure Yush chalked this one up as a learning event full circle....
