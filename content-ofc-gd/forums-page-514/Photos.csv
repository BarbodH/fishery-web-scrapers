602327,GBW,2011-07-13 19:29:00,8460,"do you have a photobucket account?  if not, make one and it's free.  then you just copy and paste the image [ img ] code in to your report."
602328,Terry,2011-07-13 19:36:00,14456,the easy way is to do it is photobucket.com and set up the account the click upload and browse to where the picture/pictures are on your computer click on the photos you want and click ok  once uploaded you copy the direct link below the photo on photobucket and put it in the image link in your post on OFC and it will appear in your post when you click on preview

602348,mike rousseau,2011-07-13 19:58:00,4661,so is there a limit to how many photos you put in a post when you use photobucket?  is this how people post 20 pic reports?
602349,misfish,2011-07-13 20:01:00,29133,"  Your confussed Geoff. Put your cursor on the image you want.A bar will drop.Click on the img link (bottom one),Click on it,it will read  copied. Then you right click on this site/on your thread and paste. Nothing else required. Unless your pc operates dif.???   If you are doing a report with multibul pics,you will need to click auto break."
