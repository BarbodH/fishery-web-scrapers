I think/know you are one of us. You just need to let your mind go free and clean. You should sleep well tonite and pm me in the morning.  Slayer"
601857,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-12 01:42:00,2585,"i just think its the way things go.  The earth heats up and cools down naturally or by events such as asteroids/meteors/humans.  It will heat up then cool off again and while she does this she rocks and rolls all areas at certain times.  Cant prevent it.  One day there will be no glaciers to melt, then one day she will be covered in ice once again.  Enjoy everyday is what I say!  Cheers!"

According to the report quotes the astronomer mission, the space body would be found in the comet’s tail and was analyzed after the mysterious signals that came off of an unknown formation “strange and obscure.”  In the words of Toscano, the Chinese have said that the spacecraft is stationed in the same place for ninety days, ”before that looked like it was coming from an extraterrestrial civilization,” said Argentine scientist.  According to the Daily Chronicle, this phenomenon was corroborated by Rosie Redfiel, the new director of the Program of NASA’s Astrobiology. ”But when NASA began to make calculations and projections of orbit of the comet, they realized that something was wrong and the first thing they did was remove the website which provided information on this issue,” said Toscano   "

Last 8 years or more over Georgian Bay around Midland/Collingwood, etc. Of course they've been aerial seeding clouds for decades, but this is on a MUCH larger scale. I've witnessed as many as 5 tankers at a time laying down one mile grids, turning the spray on and off while they built their ""checker board"".  Only shots I have access to right now... they're not contrails. Contrails dissipate... these ones spread out and form cloud layer. Pics taken from our front deck in Penetang.    "
