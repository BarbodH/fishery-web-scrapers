601502,Roy,2011-07-11 15:05:00,13728,"Well there you go.....stay with what you've always used....10lb. XL. Case closed.  You don't need to thank me, you're almost at 20 posts anyway."
601510,OhioFisherman,2011-07-11 15:24:00,6623,"Actually Cudz I have used leaders, and not just to prevent bite offs. Braided nylon and Dacron were used a lot when I was young, a mono leader to reduce visibility also. Also used blood and uni knots, no issues with them slipping or going through the guides.  For me the jury is still out on line visibility, if the bite was tough I would go through the motions, lighter line, floro, but didn`t see a significant difference in the number of bites. Like mentioned, I used braided nylon and dacron with and with out mono leader, black, multi color camo, golded stren, original trilene, green , clear blue. Sort of like lures to me? Pretty colors to catch fishermen?"
601768,Live2fish85,2011-07-11 23:11:00,1633,"Shad Snacher if you have an answer for everything don't ask, braid is good and easy to use SRT8 is correct and because you don't know how to tie a good knot with braid maybe learning to tie something like a palomar knot would help. Plenty of people use braid and don't have troubles try learning something new rather then just switching. I also use a flouro leader for drop shotting, as SRT8 said it helps catch alot more and it's true. And pros don't all use Nanofil they use what is needed for the type of fishing they are doing, As for the birds nest and that it's not the only the line it's the person using the line."
601899,Lunatic,2011-07-12 02:52:00,536,"like i said earlier green trilene xl is my favourite mono, i use it in 10lb but my main rod/reel is set up with 30lb power pro braid. nothing wrong with braid,ill use it for any type of fishing."
601946,Billy Bob,2011-07-12 11:04:00,5865,Found out years ago Cabela's ProLine mono is Stren....it cost less then half as much for 4 times as much line....been using it for years.
601182,Bass Assassin,2011-07-10 18:41:00,23,I want to buy new Trilene fishing line and I don't know which type would be the best to use for bass fishing. Please let me know your opinions?
601187,Live2fish85,2011-07-10 19:04:00,1633,"All depends on what type of fishing you are doing but there is better brands then trilene, the only thing I use trilene for is top water with mono. But if your throwing spinners and or crankbaits or jigging try braid."
601191,mercman,2011-07-10 19:36:00,7054,"Why Trilene? I found the memory in Trilene Monofilament drove me nuts. Strem did the same, but Suffix Elite and Suffix Siege are an excellent Mono with very little if any reel memory."
601208,Whitespinnerbait,2011-07-10 20:49:00,2038,Trilene...........XL
601209,Duckie,2011-07-10 20:50:00,305,XL is great. especially the green colour.   
601221,Bass Assassin,2011-07-10 21:41:00,23,Well I have tried braid and tying knots is a pain and i found take i get birds nests with braid but not with fluorocarbon or mono line. I'm looking for a line that i can do fishing on top of the water but also under with some cranks.
601223,Bass Assassin,2011-07-10 21:45:00,23,I'm leaning towards Trilene xl but i just took a look at Trilene big game and it has all the same specs as xl but it's supposed to be stronger and have more knott strength
601247,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-07-10 23:03:00,535,"I hate trilene, like mentioned already it has terrible memory. I only use braid for bass fishing, 50lb power pro usually. It's strong as hell for pulling fish through the weeds or if you get snagged, plus I find it very sensitive too. If you tie it right it's almost impossible to break. I've snapped brand new hooks in half many times without my line breaking. I wish I could explain how to tie a good knot for braid but it's hard when you can't show how, I'm not even sure the name of the knot I use."
601250,Bass Assassin,2011-07-10 23:16:00,23,Most pros now a days are using nanofil Trilene and not braid because its to heavy and fish can see it.
601255,kuhaman,2011-07-10 23:22:00,503,Spinning reel or baitcaster?
601256,misfish,2011-07-10 23:25:00,29133," Interesting.  P-Line floro.   If you are casting a reaction bait,it dosent matter what your using."
601260,kuhaman,2011-07-10 23:29:00,503,I use P line floroclear on my spinning and baitcaster. I love the stuff. Trilene xl or xt is good too!
601282,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-11 00:28:00,1107,Why not order a spool of nanofil and let us know how it works   .I use braid on all my rods and run a floro leader when needed check out the knot tying sites and practice a few braid is great and easy to use once ya get the hang of it. I used to use a improved clinch knot on braid but a polamar knot is really easy and strong.I will definately be trying this nanofil stuff though sound cool .
601294,Bass Assassin,2011-07-11 00:52:00,23,you shouldn't have to use a floro leader every time it makes ur line weaker because there's a knot in it and plus it cost money to buy leaders u should just be able to tie right onto the lure rather than messing around with floro leaders. leaders should be for pike fishing with steel leaders.
601322,OhioFisherman,2011-07-11 01:35:00,6623,"Stren almost exclusively, no leaders for bass fishing, true, not necessary, but in lakes with ski`s and pike? figure on losing some lures to them."
601382,fish_fishburn,2011-07-11 03:02:00,1311,X2 as ohio said.
601383,Lunatic,2011-07-11 03:06:00,536,this.  best mono i have ever used.
601384,Gregoire,2011-07-11 03:07:00,1397, I've found that steel leaders can damage fish if they roll. I prefer to use fluoro or mono leaders.
601386,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-11 03:22:00,1107,Unfortunately leader are nessasary when drop shoting with braided line unless you want to spool straight floro which is more $$$ than braid and if you tie a good not its plenty strong enough to handle any bass if you feel you have to use trilene then have at it.it is good for top water and cranks because it stretches. BTW I fish erie a lot and is supper clear so floro gives me more confidence in my presentation which = more fish weather or not it actually help doesn't matter as long as they get to the boat.
601426,docknocker,2011-07-11 11:17:00,36, Trilene XL on spinning reel
601431,Cudz,2011-07-11 11:52:00,2652,"   Shad you are correct about he knot but I don't think you or Ohio understand the fluoro leader that SRT8 is talking about.  THis leader is not a leader to protect against being bitten off by toothy critters, it is a leader about 6 to 20 ft long that is used so that the fish won't see the braid. it is tied line to line using a uni to uni or other knot.  The actual knot, when finished is very small and can pass through the eyes of the rod on casts. There is no medal snap or swivel in this kind of a setup.  You can use a mono leader or fluoro leader.  I use the same setup as SRT and I bet there are hundreds of others here who do as well. Braid with a fluoro leader.  When I used to use mono it was always Trilene XL (but i don't do it anymore)"
601451,beginner,2011-07-11 13:14:00,542,"I used 6lb test line with 10""ft rod in bass, pike, walleye to salmon.. 6lb test is all I need.."
601456,Bass Assassin,2011-07-11 13:22:00,23,I see many people are saying the trilene xl is the best for spinning reels so I think ill go for that because I more of a top water fish I use mainly hula poppers top water lures and shallow water lures but i also fish for perch and smaller fish and I think braid would be unnecessary for that kind of fishing
601489,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-11 14:24:00,1107,"feeling bites is always necessary, if your fishing for perch you can go down to a 8-10lb braid and 4-6lb flouro and you will feel it whan a perch farts near your bait    there is a reason for any set up and using just trilene mono exclusively will catch you fish but don't we all want to catch MORE fish  Cudz thats exactly what I'm talking about I put enough for a rod lenth as a leader so I don't have to re tie the back to back uni all the time."
601493,Bass Assassin,2011-07-11 14:40:00,23,I usually use a 10 pound test this way i can still catch bigger fish without my line breaking but its also not to big so that i still have sensitivity and invisibility
