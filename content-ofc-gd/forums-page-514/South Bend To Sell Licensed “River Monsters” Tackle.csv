You could fly all the way down there to learn this, or just click here to read it now and save yourself the cost of the flight.  It's actually a pretty good idea, and I expect these will sell like crazy at Walmarts all across the US. If it gets people to go fishing, then why not?  No word on whether or not the stuff will be promoted on the TV show, but somehow I doubt it."
602036,Roy,2011-07-12 17:41:00,13728,Right up South Bend's alley. I'm surprised Quantum or Okuma didn't grab it.
602038,Pikeslayer,2011-07-12 17:44:00,1443,Looks like Mercman and Skeeter will be adding to their tackle selection.
602040,Roy,2011-07-12 17:47:00,13728, South Bend was making fishing equipment 50 years before Mr. Walton purchased a chain of five and dimes.
602042,craigdritchie,2011-07-12 17:54:00,1586,"Yup, South Bend has a grand old name in the tackle business. Some interesting info on the company here.  Roy - my thoughts exactly. Doesn't this remind you of the Rhino Rod??"
602044,danbouck,2011-07-12 17:58:00,4380,Awesome! South Bend is one of the first rods that many people use when they get into fishing.
