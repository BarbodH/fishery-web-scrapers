I fish with Phishfearme and went on the latest trip he posted about at Kearns Lake. Have been going to Canada since 1977. Had a close friend who owned a drive to camp(Silver Birch Camp) about 20 miles north of Kenora near Redditt and went there for 30yrs until he sold it and has since passed away Also have gone on over 40 plus fly-in trips to various areas of Northwest Ontario  The walleye photo posted by Phishfearme waqs caught in 2009 at Wettlauffer lake it was a little over 29 inches. I can highly recommend Thousandlakesoutposts out of Thunder Bay for great fishing and a Super Luxurious cabin with Everthing needed for a fishing trip or a family vacation  I also recommend North of 51 Outposts out of Pickle lake  for excellent fishing,with short flights and very reasonable prices  Looking forward to all the posts on this site Will try to contribute my 2 cents at various times  	Larry s"
