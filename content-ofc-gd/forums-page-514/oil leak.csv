601964,archer379,2011-07-12 12:48:00,277,A buddy has about a 04 yamaha 90 hp yesterday when he pulled it out. He saw oil was leaking. He said it smells like gear oil. It is leaking from the rectangle hole I think its the waater intake. He just got the boat but had bought it last fall when he changed the oil he thouight theere may have been water in it.

I don't have a link, but I know there are manuals available online for under 10 bucks.  I assume they are copied, stolen, or copywritten somehow, but thats another can of worms."
601979,bigbuck,2011-07-12 14:10:00,2449,Has to be a problem with one of the seals. I think he could probably get a copy of the manuals at iboats.com.
