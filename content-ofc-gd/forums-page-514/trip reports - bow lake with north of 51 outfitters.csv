On the other note... Kesagami... it's kind of too bad you didn't enjoy it there.  The lake certainly can be a nasty one in a blow, but it's fishing once you get onto them is top notch.  Thanks for the posts."
602459,phishfearme,2011-07-14 01:31:00,20,"moose - we only drive to pickle to get to the float planes!!  just like armstrong, red lake, ear falls,  etc..  while driving past all that water getting to these northern outpost towns, we frequently wonder if we should try some drive to resorts but with limited time and $$ we stick to one flyin outpost where isolation is guaranteed.  in addition to kesagami we also fished evans lake in quebec and also detour lake with cochrane air service - these are all ""james bay lowlands lakes"" (outside of the schield) and i guess i just like the ""hunting"" aspect of structure fishing that the schield lakes provide.  we'll probably never go back to this region - just not our cup of tea.  i do recognize that other people love this area - a friend of mine can't wait to back to evans every year and troll and troll for monster pike.  to each his own i guess.  i really enjoy your reports - must take a ton of time to put them together - thanks for posting them.  phish "
