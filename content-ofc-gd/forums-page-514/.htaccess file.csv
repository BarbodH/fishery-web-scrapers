602281,adolson,2011-07-13 17:39:00,783,"rewriteengine on rewritecond %{http_host} domain.old [nc] rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://domain.new/$1 [r=301,nc]  hope that helps!"
602283,TJQ,2011-07-13 17:43:00,7806,is that all that needs to be there???
602284,Raf,2011-07-13 17:46:00,3495,# This allows you to redirect your entire website to any other domain Redirect 301 / http://example.com/
602285,adolson,2011-07-13 17:46:00,783,"Yep, should be. That's what I use on one of my domains, and it works. For example, if you try to go to http://www.tawkn.net/?user_id=1, it'll change it to the proper domain, tawkn.com, but still retain the rest of the URL/parameters at the end."
602286,TJQ,2011-07-13 17:51:00,7806,Thanks Dana that worked!!!
