601740,Nipfisher,2011-07-11 22:29:00,2449,Nice largie.
601744,misfish,2011-07-11 22:31:00,29133,No arguement here. Thats a fatty .  Nice fish.
601903,BiggFish,2011-07-12 03:06:00,40,PokerDemon4 thats a nice tank right there.  Please tell me that this fish was not caught at a reservoir that starts with a V?  Chad
601905,splashhopper,2011-07-12 03:10:00,2931, very nice...
601908,n8tivebigguy,2011-07-12 03:17:00,30,Thats a nice one!
601917,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-12 03:36:00,2585,great fish!  Cheers!
601930,FrankTheRabbit,2011-07-12 04:35:00,479,It's nice to see largies in Ontario getting to that size. It was depressing to watch the US based fishing shows on TV where they have 8lbs bucket mouths pulled onto the boats and 5 pounders were a minimum.  Nicely done and thanks for sharing.

602246,pokerdemon4,2011-07-13 13:59:00,135, Me and a friend were targeting bass that day. We were fishing a derby at Valen's conservation area. I caught this one after the derby had ended. There are some big bass in there if you know where to look.
