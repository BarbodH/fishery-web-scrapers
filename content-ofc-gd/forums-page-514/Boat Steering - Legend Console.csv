601804,Sharkbait22,2011-07-11 23:51:00,297,"I have a 2004 Legend.  Great boat but the steering seems loose. Trims out fine and there's not a lot of play.  The problem is when trolling because the kick of the motor (Optimax 90) will slowly steer the boat.  It's a real pain when tending rods while on the move. There is also the concern of the motor steering rapidly while on plane and trimmed out right.  Fortunately this hasn't happen - I just have to keep my hands on the wheel.  Anyways.  Is there something I can adjust to apply some friction to prevent the ""motor kick turn"".  I remember a 9.9 Merc I once owned had a screw to tighten the steering. I think they even called it the autopilot.  Any help would be greatly appreciated."
601900,HTHM,2011-07-12 02:54:00,4082,"Single or dual teleflex cable on the motor? A single may not have the strength to hold the motor, and at full throttle can cause a very nasty turn and throw you out of the vessel."
601904,mike rousseau,2011-07-12 03:07:00,4661,My motor has a tension bolt to add resistance to steering...  Full pin I can take my hands off... And thats a tiller
601911,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-12 03:24:00,10439," I had the same issue with the Teleflex steering system on my boat. I finally got tired of going in circles when setting the riggers so I replaced it wit a Teleflex NFB Helm and matching cable. No more problem. The NFB Helms have a built in clutch that will lock the steering when you are not turning, but functions normally when turning. I think it cost me about $230 US but it was money well spent.  Here's a link for ya As an added bonus they are on sale.  Teleflex NFB Helm & Cable Kit  Make sure you remove your old cable to measure it to get the right length (I didn't and got it wrong and had to send back for exchange $$$$$ )"
601957,Uncle Buck,2011-07-12 12:15:00,1000,the hillbilly fix for this is a bungee cord to your seat post and hook it to your steering wheel when you want it to go to maintain a certain course...  the proper way ($$$) is the NFB that Drifter is talking about...
602094,Sharkbait22,2011-07-12 21:58:00,297,"Well thanks for the replies.  Yes it's single Teleflex steering.  It's a pita.  Seems like poor design/dangerous too.  I will call Legend tomorrow and see what they have to say.  The Hillbilly approach might work for a bit. This website (its members) is so helpful.  Thanks.  NFB Safe-T II is a great choice for most single outboards up to V-4, 50 mph. Replaces Teleflex Safe-T and MorseÂ® Command 290 systems. Stainless steel cable ends fit most brands and sizes of motors.
