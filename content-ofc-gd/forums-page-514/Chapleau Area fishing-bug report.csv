I am heading up on Wednesday into the backcountry and would appreciate any relevant info.  Also, what online weather source is the most reliable for that area?  The several that I have found have widely different weather forecasts for the week.  Anyone have an idea about which one is best?  Thanks in advance!"
601547,TDunn,2011-07-11 16:54:00,680,"  Bugs - oh ya! but on the decline  temps- 60's for the ones you mentioned to me before....maybe warmer on the shallow ones  weather - bring rainsuits, warm clothes and shorts/tees It doesn't matter which one you watch. Our weather forcasts change daily it seems.....   TDunn"
