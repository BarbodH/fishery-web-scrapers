677019,ADB,2012-03-17 16:28:00,444,"Here is an update from the Algonquin Outfitters Blog:  ""Quick ice update: And while I'm here, here is a little snow and ice update: rain and mild weather has definitely made a BIG dent in the Algonquin Park snowpack. Having said that, I must report that people are still cross-country skiing and snowshoeing this week in very ""spring skiing"" conditions. All lakes are frozen right up to the shore, small streams are in flood, and the long-range forecast is looking colder by the end of next. So, shall we see a repeat of the record-breaking 2010 ice-out? I doubt it. Early-ish maybe, but not that early."""

677382,chris.brock,2012-03-18 23:36:00,4053,"I was just up in Haliburton, a little south of Algonquin but with similiar altitude, I think the ice-out is going to beat 2010, with the warm weather it could be gone by next weekend"
677398,Christopheraaron,2012-03-19 00:26:00,3525,"I got a spring brook trout trip lined up for may, if it's not out by then we're in trouble!"
