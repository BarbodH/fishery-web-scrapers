Dispite every thing i was told this week about trying to get one i just went on line to Service Ontario and renewed mine , it was easy and hassel free and only took a few minutes , seems every thing is up and running well . Thank you for reading and a sorry to those who found this to be old news ."
677109,livinisfishin,2012-03-17 23:19:00,661,I did mine before january and it was pretty well painless online....i am still waiting for my license to come in the mail.
677110,davey buoy,2012-03-17 23:23:00,5505, Good news never get's old.Thanks for the update.
677113,Old Man,2012-03-17 23:27:00,822,Renewed ours online last year and it was easy and we received our new Outdoor card and 3 year license with in 3 weeks. No problems here.
677125,danbouck,2012-03-18 00:02:00,4380,I renewed mine online 3 weeks ago and got it in the mail last week
677140,coreyhkh,2012-03-18 00:24:00,163,I tried 4 times and it would not work for me so I just went to Canadian tire.
677141,mercman,2012-03-18 00:27:00,7054,"Got my outdoors card and years licence a few weeks ago.Painless, and had it within 2 weeks of applying."
677227,Rod Caster,2012-03-18 12:52:00,5784,Haven't received my license since buying it Jan 1 and they still owe me 50 bucks. Will I ever see that check?
677231,Billy Bob,2012-03-18 13:24:00,5865," Dan, did they actually mail you a fishing license or was it the outdoors card....the reason I ask it because I received my new 3 year outdoors card in the mail about 3-4 weeks after I did it online (Jan 2nd)....BUT  I had to print my ""FISHING LICENSE"" and I'm glad I did because they never mailed me a ""Fishing License"" from Canada and I believe I will never get one mailed because the printed downloaded version says ""FISHING LICENSE"" compared to the printed version of my outdoors card that said TEMPORARY Outdoors Card...  Just trying to clear this up and at the same time make sense of it...."
677232,danbouck,2012-03-18 13:28:00,4380, It was my outdoors card but it says Fishing 2012 on the back. Same as past years
677233,Billy Bob,2012-03-18 13:30:00,5865,"See, mine doesn't.....they must do it differently for non residents.....I guess."
677235,Dave Bailey,2012-03-18 13:30:00,1641,"Went to Gagnon Sports about 3 weeks ago and got the floppy piece of yellow plastic. Haven't received my card yet, or do I even get one?"
677239,fish_fishburn,2012-03-18 13:52:00,1311,"I went to service ontario and bought mine 3 weeks ago. Got my card in the mail last week. I wanted to keep my old card for a sovineir but she wouldn't give it back to me, said she had to keep it. Found that weird, what do they do with the old ones, through them in the garbage."
677265,mercman,2012-03-18 16:07:00,7054, The paper you printed IS your fishing license Bob. I saved the pdf to my desktop so i can reprint if it gets mangled in my tacklebox.
677277,i2cool2fool,2012-03-18 17:05:00,349,I did the same and was quite happy.
