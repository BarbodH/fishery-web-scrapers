676966,CRAPPIE,2012-03-17 10:16:00,213,Is any one use this effort to find depth and fish? Is this accurate to locate fish and see the fish bite like ice fishing? Thanks in advance!
676990,Joeytier,2012-03-17 14:19:00,3990,"If the only place you're fishing is directly under the boat, then yes..."
676999,Nipfisher,2012-03-17 15:32:00,2449,Allows you to scope out some depths under your canoe then put that info together to map out drop offs and shoals. Like Joey said....once you find the fish you can jig under the canoe and watch the fish.
677216,Pgidley,2012-03-18 05:53:00,14,I use an X67 and the ice-ducer shoots perfectly through the hull of my kevlar canoe.
677217,CRAPPIE,2012-03-18 07:14:00,213,But the current and wind will move the boat a bit. Will it affect the reading even u anchor the boat ?
677219,Moosebunk,2012-03-18 07:39:00,3970,"Should work fine if you're not at high speed.  For jiggin from a canoe while just slowly drifting about, I'd think it would work OK.  Used my x67 last year for laker jiggin from the boat."
677288,Pgidley,2012-03-18 18:35:00,14,"I just use it like a normal graph. I was going to buy a suction-mount transducer but the ice-ducer works fine, better if anything as I don't have to worry about it bumping anything and I can move it around if necessary. Just make sure that its in a bit of water."
