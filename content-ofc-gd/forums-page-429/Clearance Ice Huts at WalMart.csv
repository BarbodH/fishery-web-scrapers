They're ""Black Canyon"" I believe.  Obviously not Clam, Eskimo or Frabill quality but for those on a budget or looking for a spare, this is definitely a good option.  There were 6 or 7 left when I left this morning."

676969,steverowbotham,2012-03-17 11:45:00,1800,Huts have now dropped to $52 !!
676973,Handlebarz,2012-03-17 12:01:00,3790,"Talk to the sports manager ask if they will reduce more. I did it years ago and got 2 jiffy augers 8"" for $230 out the door I sold one for that price and mine was free. If they have a bunch make a offer for them all they need the shelf space"
676974,Skipper D,2012-03-17 12:01:00,1970,  At that price if you scooped them all up could you sell then back here next fall ????????

676977,skeeter,2012-03-17 12:39:00,1907,"If those are the same huts that I bought a few years ago, DONT TOUCH THEM!!!!!!!  Mine is an ozark trail hut. It is JUNK. Comes with 4 steel tent poles and 2 fiberglass cross overs for the roof. Hard as heck to set up and then the slightest breeze will blow the sides in on you."
677386,steverowbotham,2012-03-18 23:56:00,1800," good to know. i never took one out of the bag even, just saw they were on clearance and thought i'd let people know."
