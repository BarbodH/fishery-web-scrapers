677738,davey buoy,2012-03-20 00:31:00,5505, I couldn't see a date either.
677739,Terry,2012-03-20 00:32:00,14456, but we had a vote 8 years ago and I won the position   judge and jury is a lifetime appointment here  but no pension plan or benefits
677740,danbouck,2012-03-20 00:33:00,4380, I voted for Solo
677741,Terry,2012-03-20 00:34:00,14456, maybe you didn't read some of the guys drive by there all the time and know when it opened up and when the snow left
677744,lovetofish,2012-03-20 00:38:00,500,I guess we can only hope it was an honest mistake. Misread a reg or something
677745,solopaddler,2012-03-20 00:38:00,8605,  I walk the river in Caledonia every 2nd day with my dog and I know damn well it wasn't fishable in February.  You guys can think whatever you like.
677746,Billy Bob,2012-03-20 00:39:00,5865, NOT ME.........I'm from the U.S.A. where  you're INNOCENT until proven GUILTY.....UNLIKE here.......  I hear RUSSIA can almost be seen from Canada for those who have a quick verdict in their minds......
677747,danbouck,2012-03-20 00:41:00,4380, what???
677749,Pikeslayer,2012-03-20 00:48:00,1443, Keep grasping at those straws. It's all you got goin' for ya. You might be an exceptional fisherman but you're a pretty weak lawyer.
677750,skidoosafari,2012-03-20 00:48:00,46,Maybe the OP has native status???
677751,Billy Bob,2012-03-20 00:48:00,5865, I'm sorry Dan if we have a mis-undertanding.......just going off what I read from your other post....
677752,Billy Bob,2012-03-20 00:50:00,5865, ANYONE can catch fish is a barrel....
677753,Pikeslayer,2012-03-20 00:50:00,1443, Now that's pretty racist  :asshat:
677754,Grimace,2012-03-20 00:54:00,2020," Well there is that and the fact he was asking people to go with him before it closed on March 15th (which it doesn't, it closed at the end of Feb). He also stated he did well that Sunday.  There were a couple of Sundays in between that post and open season.   I don't think he is exactly grasping at straws.  Since being painted into the corner the OP hasn't come out and said anything that would make sense out of those facts."
677756,Billy Bob,2012-03-20 00:55:00,5865," OMG......now let's play nice and not open that can of worms....get it ""worms"".....LOL....BTW younguns.......you should be using minnows..."
677757,NAW,2012-03-20 00:56:00,4022, That's not racist at all.. I was thinking the same thing
677758,Pikeslayer,2012-03-20 00:57:00,1443, He doesn't need to. It's the others that made the slanderous accusations that seem to be posting their defense.
677760,skidoosafari,2012-03-20 01:03:00,46,"Now now folks, assuming gets ya in trouble. I HAVE NATIVE status. BTW good on the mods for letting this play out."
677761,Billy Bob,2012-03-20 01:03:00,5865,ATTN MODS:.....sometimes some or even ALL of us need to get out an do some FISHING because we are what we are........why not have a thread limit on ANY kind of threads to keep our male hormones  levels down here on a daily bases.....I would recommend 50 post per thread.....just something to think about......Just saying....  Gone FISHING 3 time in my boat............  Bob
677763,Joeytier,2012-03-20 01:09:00,3990,"I wonder how many times you've done this now....  You make extremely unsubstantiated comments (often offensive).  You then receive well-deserved rebuttals, blame it on the 'young-un's' then cry to the mods for everyone being in a sour mood.  Why is it out of line for someone to question whether or not the fish were taken legally?  Seems perfectly sensible since it IS being posted on the internet for all to see.  I'd hope that OFC takes all measures to promote ethical, legal fishing practices, and this is a prime example."
677766,Pikeslayer,2012-03-20 01:10:00,1443," Yep, you're right. Assumptions is what started this whole thing. Sincere apologies if I offended you?  Considering one of the mods 'fuelled' this fire, yes it is right to let it play out. It's the right thing to do."
677768,Roy,2012-03-20 01:10:00,13728,"Well, I've stayed out of this for as long as I could. It wasn't going anywhere good at the beginning and at this time, not much has changed.  GOOD NIGHT, Mrs. Calabash--wherever you are!"
677769,Grimace,2012-03-20 01:10:00,2020,"He asked people to go fishing with him on the 12th of March for walleye in Caledonia where it is closed.   He stated he wanted another shot at them before they closed on the 15th (which they don't, they closed at the end of Feb).  He stated he did well the previous Sunday (there are 2 of them in between then and when the season closed).   It is pretty evident that he fished Caledonia for Walleye after they closed.  The pictures of the fish at the dam appear to the guys who live there to be taken after the end of Feb.  The odd ramblings and double talk of the OP do not make any sense.  Mike's argument makes sense and the OP has not responded in any way to that argument.  It is not a wreckless smear and slander campaign, the posts raise questions to which no suitable answers have been given."
677771,Bigworm,2012-03-20 01:11:00,119," This is only my 3rd post on this thread and I was the one to start it. I've read everyones comments and you know what the problem is here, he was fishing illegally! Despite what everyone wants to say about ""no clear date, amateur investigation, brothers of the board blah,blah...."" There is enough reason for me to say that he was fishing illegally! For everyone that is justifying his catch and saying "" this is stupid, a ridiculous post and so on....think about the sport you love! If it was someone beside you, on the shore doing the same thing, would you just say you're ridiculous, this is stupid! Or, would you take action because you don't want to see the spawning walleye pulled from their beds and the sport you love become jeopardize...? If you would just ignore it, you are as much at fault than the person commiting the crime. AND IT IS A CRIME!"
677619,Terry,2012-03-19 20:17:00,14456,"wow  now I am afraid to post my pike spearing trip last night week month....in a different county country  yeah that's what it was, but I think I will pass on posting about it"

677630,sauce,2012-03-19 20:34:00,219,"I'm goin to throw in my 2 cents. A few have posted references to the regs. Yes Caledonia is off limits for walleye. Season there ends feb 29 as per the exceptions. Somewhere upstream from there (onandaga tuscarora line) walleye and pike switch back to the general regulations. This line is downstream from brantford, not exactly sure where, I think its near chiefswood/ middleport area. I was fishing in brantford last week and a guy told me to try caledonia, ""they're slamming them now"" was the phrase he used.  I was also told to come back and fish the spot I was fishing after the season closes. The fish stack up and ""they can fish for then, so can I"" Yeah, try tellin that to a CO."
677635,Roe Bag,2012-03-19 20:37:00,246," I drive across the Caledonia bridge at least twice a day and you are absolutely right sir, when you say, ""It's only really become fishable in the last two weeks"". This statement too is the absolute truth: ""No way does the condition of the river prior to March 1st jive with a couple of the pic's he posted.""   In the fourth picture if he were to turn around, stand on the edge of the wall and drop his line right at his feet, he would still be within the 22.9m/75 foot restriction. Besides, it's not where you stand. Your bait or lure musn't be within 22.9m/75' of a dam, fishway, obstruction etc.etc.  I think if it were up to a jury they wouldn't be out very long!"
677636,solopaddler,2012-03-19 20:39:00,8605,  What's been posted that's incorrect?

677645,Live2fish85,2012-03-19 20:57:00,1633,"If you know the regs so well you should have known that it was closed March 1 not 15th, that there shows you don't know your regs that you are so sure you know.  What does the commebt about people being retired have to do with it. Are they losers because they worked there entire life lol.  I think you are a lost cause. Go fish Caledonia this week again why don't you."

677725,solopaddler,2012-03-20 00:17:00,8605,   The issue here is not signage or where he was standing.  The issue is the Grand in Caledonia has been closed to walleye fishing since March 1st.

Do I look new? I know my limit and stay within it it! I can't believe I am actually defending myself here! But hey, just sayin' "
677535,mikeseb,2012-03-19 15:58:00,201,"Nice fish!! Thats where I caught my first and only walleye LOL Dont worry about all the harassment youll get used to it, I get accused of fishing fish sanctuaries every time i post a report.  Knowing and obeying fishing regs is something i take very seriously and Ive even yelled at a few guys fishing in a questionable location that I would report them if they didnt get their 's outa there, after they tried convincing me they werent doing anything wrong I pulled out my cell phone and walked over to a sign no further than 100 yards from where they were fishing and begun dialing the MNR hotline that is boldly printed on the sign.  After punching in about 5 numbers I saw the 3 guys quickly moving downstream.  They were fishing under a bridge that has signs all over it saying fish sanctuary no fishing and there are other signs posted ALL over the river stating that there is to be no fishing north of the bridge but it did not say anything about under the bridge?  Does anyone know if this boundary starts at the north or south end of the bridge?  These guys were trying to tell me it was the north end of the bridge but after they fled the scene while i was dialing the MNR hotline it makes me think they were in fact fishing in the sanctuary."
677539,Pikeslayer,2012-03-19 16:10:00,1443, Ummmm.......No it does not. There were is no reference to dates that the actual photo were taken on (with the exception of the stringer shot) Seems to me that you guys are desperately reaching for straws. You posted assumptious remarks and railroaded the thread. No to mention publicly/openly questioned a members intergrity. The right thing to do is apologize openly IMHO. But knowing the way things work around here the general consensus is it will be easier to make it go 'poof'.

677545,Spiel,2012-03-19 16:27:00,9065," I think not.  Posted Mon. March 12th the OP stated he was looking for a fishing partener for walleye fishing in Caledonia, mistakenly believing that the walleye fishing season closed on Wed. March 15th.    Given the lack of snow and ice as well as the green grass and the lack of warm clothing it would seem to fit well with the above quote.  Even if I'm mistaken on all of the above this still applies! "
677547,Darrel,2012-03-19 16:31:00,82," Ok Mr. Reg's, if you know the area so well, then you know where that big log crosses the concrete footpath at the shoreline, right? I was fishing the far side of that and I don't know about you, but I've been in the construction business most of my life and know how to eyeball a measurement and I'm PRETTY sure I'm 75' from the dam!!! But why don't you go prove me wrong and get yourself a big steel tape, get your bass down there and measure it up for me....seeing you don't have much else to do. maybe getting off your computer and gettin' out for some fresh air might do you some good!!! Lemme know how it goes for ya!  Oh yeah, I know the reg's too, big fella! Just sayin' "

I am human. I clearly stated what I had thought was closing date for walleye in Caledonia as well. Did you think to message me at the time of this post to correct me? Were YOU one of the 149 viewers of that post and didn't reply to it like the other 148? Give me a break!!!!! How many of you guys that are busting my balls are retired? LOL"
677555,Darrel,2012-03-19 16:50:00,82," Are they closed in upper and lower Niagara as well, or are they fair game all year round?!!!!!! I know the answer to that, so don't bother replying...just ask yourself before shooting you mouths off....OMG you guys are something else. Remember when you're pointing your finger, there are three more pointing back at you....and hey, it's a nice day out, so I'm sure you can go clean the crap up in your own backyard!"
677568,i2cool2fool,2012-03-19 17:59:00,349,Darn. Maybe the poster should have included the newspaper of the day in his pictures. I didn't immediately assume the fish were out of season. I am not familiar with the area and would not be able to determine if caught in a non-fishing zone.  Nice fish though!
677576,solopaddler,2012-03-19 18:31:00,8605, You're pretty adamant here that you weren't fishing Caledonia.     Here you claim you're fishing Delaware.     According to this quoted post you were soliciting members to join you walleye fishing in Caledonia. The post was dated 12 days after the season closed.     In this response you actually admit to fishing in Caledonia.    Surely you can see why some people are thinking this post is a little fishy.

677506,Darrel,2012-03-19 14:50:00,82,"BTW.... the stringer pic is in Delaware ON, taken March 2. Season didn't close til March 15!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not that I need to explain myself. Do you guys have nothing better to do, but ruin a good HONEST story! Are YOU for real?!!!   quote name='Bigworm' date='19 March 2012 - 08:06 AM' timestamp='1332158760' post='677469'] ARE YOU FOR REAL!!!!!!!!! CALEDONIA IS A FISH SANCTUARY FOR WALLEYE RIGHT NOW! NICE STRINGER PICTURE!  Grand River and its tributaries - downstream of the Onondaga and Tuscarora Twps. line to Lake Erie. Walleye and Northern pike open from Jan. 1 - last day in Feb. & 2nd Sat. in May - Dec. 31. "
677507,Pikeslayer,2012-03-19 14:54:00,1443, Good of you to clear that up BBM. Hopefully they will retract the assumptions and post a deserved apology???
677508,fishrking,2012-03-19 14:55:00,24,"Wow.  Not suprising to see guys jump the gun without any thought or post digestion.  The OP actually references when he can get back out a fish the system - you guys didn't think that maybe he has an idea of the regulations?  Some guys make reports about trips that occured two monthes before posting - this guy could have been fishing up to a month ago legally which is undoubtedly when these were caught. Nice fish BBM they look awesome, hopefully some of the guys who have been cooped up all winter get a chance to dust their rods off for a couple days this season instead of crapping on the guys who are willing to put on a coat and GO fishing.  jf"
677510,Rod Caster,2012-03-19 15:01:00,5784,"It would have been wise to post the dates in which the fish were caught, to avoid such a spree... either way, definitly some trigger happiness going on.  Nice walters. I was hoping for the same yesterday but the Ottawa was destroyed with debris and mud."
677511,Darrel,2012-03-19 15:03:00,82,"Plus, did none of you wise guys take the time to read the comment before you jumped all over the location of the pics?!!! I don't know, but where I come from, a good, ""Congrats, good for you!"" goes a long way in my books. So tell me something.......If I won the lottery and posted it on here, would I be a prick, because you figure that ticket should have been yours, or would you say, ""Good for you, 'A to go BBM!""? To judge is to be judged! My mamma always said, "" keep your mouth closed and be thought of as a fool, ot open your mouth and remove all doubt."" Something some of you guys might wanna apply to your daily living!!!"
677513,Darrel,2012-03-19 15:04:00,82,Well better luck next time!!! And TY!!!  
677514,Nipfisher,2012-03-19 15:05:00,2449,"  Good on you BBM. I was dissappointed in this thread when I first read it this morning and even more so now. All you assumers need to PM the OP and apologise. This site can be rediculous some times. Hey BBM, didn't you read in the rules where you have to explain every picture including, zone, date, and time of catch?  Dissapointed in a mod challenging the pictures in this thread as well. Wouldn't a PM have been more appropriate?"
677517,mercman,2012-03-19 15:10:00,7054,Excellent report BBM !!! Late season walleye are a blast. get ready for the new season too !!!!  Paul
677518,Spiel,2012-03-19 15:11:00,9065, Knowing the area well I can still say that the above applies.
677519,BucktownAngler,2012-03-19 15:14:00,582,good job BBM
677520,Pikeslayer,2012-03-19 15:18:00,1443,Yep. Nice shootin BBM .
677523,Nipfisher,2012-03-19 15:32:00,2449," Fair enough. If BBM is within the 75 feet of the dam or obstacle then he is wrong. Pretty difficult to measure 75 feet of rugged shoreline.  Still, I feel a question to the OP or a PM asking how close he was to the dam would have been more appropriate. I took one on the chin last summer in a report by MercMan and Musky Mike where I challenged a picture of 9 walleye as being over the 2-person limit. I was WRONG to challenge it within the thread and I have apologised and made ammends with both of those fine anglers and gentlmen.  I find fault with the way the regs are written in many instances. Why wouldn't thr MNR post a sign that says no fishing from here to dam?"
677526,Spiel,2012-03-19 15:42:00,9065," As I said being very familiar with the area the background in the fourth picture is the entrance to the fish ladder, the other pictures are from the same location just from a different angle. It's up to the angler to be aware of the regs, with or without signage."
677529,Bigworm,2012-03-19 15:45:00,119,"  I was the first one to post about your illegl fshing and I wouldn't have done so unless I saw this post from you dated March 12th 2012 11:05pm  ""I'm looking for someone to go fishing with in Caledonia this Wednesday. I went with a buddy on Sunday and did very well, but I have no one to join me for the closing day of Walleye season, which is technically Wednesday at midnight. If you don't mind a workout in somewhat of fast moving water, I would love for someone to tag along for some fun, breast deep in water, walleye fishing! Plus, it's good to have someone else there in case I take a dip in the drink! LOL. Please let me know via inbox or open reply ASAP and we can discuss details of time and place to meet.  Thanks  Darrel"
677530,Nipfisher,2012-03-19 15:45:00,2449,  o.k.
677531,Spiel,2012-03-19 15:48:00,9065, I guess that sums it up nicely.
