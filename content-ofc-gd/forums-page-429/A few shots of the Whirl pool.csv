The water was prime and down.  Thought I would just share some pics I took.            Before we got to the falls, a stop to see Spiel for a rod order. I  finaly got to meet Solo (Mike) and Zoey(dont think she liked me   ) and a surprise, old friend Gerritt was there aswell. Good to see you lads and cant wait for delivery of my new Spiel creation.  Let me know when your heading up this way Mike.For sure were going to hook up.   As for the days events,what happens at the falls,stays at the falls."

677263,misfish,2012-03-18 16:06:00,29133, Sure was Dan. Forgot it was ST.Pattys day.
677284,tomO,2012-03-18 17:34:00,363,Nice pics. That second pic it looked like he was standing on a car untill I enlarged it.
677286,davey buoy,2012-03-18 18:04:00,5505,"Nice getaway Brian,hard to tell but the water looked fairly clear.Good for you for holding back lol, if I was there not so sure:thumbsup_anim:What's that saying, kill two birds with one stone!"
677295,Spiel,2012-03-18 18:45:00,9065," As my status says Brian, good to see you and the Mrs as well. But as for Zoey, well she wasn't here, that's Solo's dog.  You saw Brook and she's okay with you, just liked your Mrs more.  "
677297,Roy,2012-03-18 18:48:00,13728,"Yeah, I'm with Brook on this one."
677301,misfish,2012-03-18 19:10:00,29133, Sorry for missing out on Brook. Yes she took to Betty. Zoey was in Mikes truck Chris.
677303,Spiel,2012-03-18 19:30:00,9065," Oooops, Sorry Brian I forgot that Zoey was out there, my bad."
677308,Joey,2012-03-18 19:50:00,9122,"Great shots B.  Don't know how you could have gone and not taken your rod and tackle, great willpower man!!!!"
677312,misfish,2012-03-18 19:59:00,29133,I took the most important one.  I did buy Mrs.s B a HUGE chocolate strawberry.  
677323,Raf,2012-03-18 21:22:00,3495,It looks much nicer when you are actually down there.
677335,Terry,2012-03-18 22:11:00,14456,sounds like you had a good time  but you really didn't take a rod? wow
677370,danc,2012-03-18 23:11:00,4677,It actually reminds me a lot of the Nipigon River with the water color and flow. One big difference though. What's with all of those people down there?
677378,Fish Farmer,2012-03-18 23:31:00,2234,"Holy Gezz Brian, if I new you were hear, I live just around the corner from Chris."
677408,Rustic-Fisher,2012-03-19 00:44:00,826,"Looks like a good trip, good on ya for not bringing your gear. I paid a hefty price when I brought mine. Never again! R"
677414,bigugli,2012-03-19 00:50:00,6138,"If Brian stopped to say hi to all of us, he'd have no time left fer his better half."
677436,solopaddler,2012-03-19 02:16:00,8605,"  Hey it was great meeting you! As far as Zoey goes I don't think she likes Nascar.     It really is too bad you didn't bring a rod, I was fishing the whirlpool with my son on Friday and it was great.  Glad you two had a fun weekend. As far as fishing goes this coming week is going to be huge."
