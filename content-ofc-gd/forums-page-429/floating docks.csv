677290,Gerritt,2012-03-18 18:40:00,6129,"only two that I can think of that might apply here....  Shore allowance & building permit.  but not 100% sure as the docks I have built had shore allowances already purchased... and they forwent the permit..... (permits depend on the township... organized or not, provincial regs etc..)   but those would be my guesses.   G"
