677450,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-19 04:36:00,0,"burke made a statement with that big contract.  he knows he's in toronto for the foreseeable future and likely knows he has to step it up.  and he's got to learn to skate with his head up (as Cherry mentioned) though because some young buck looking to make a name for himself is going to take his head off at some point. sarnia's yakupov is probably the most dominant player i've seen in the ohl in a very long time but he skates sort of like grabo and often puts his head down.  he recently got destroyed by mike halmo of the owen sound attack, and was subsequently suspended for 10 games (silly considering Yakupov puts himself into the awkward position while travelling at a high rate of speed).  i watched yakupov cut across the middle with his head down like this many times this season in the soo.  thankfully for him the porous Soo Greyhound defense was more into poke checks than body checks and he went unmolested.  but every time he cut across the middle i imagined how vulnerable he was to a heavy hit, and repeatedly said to my dad that he'd get killed in the nhl. i hope there was a lesson learned for him. He's a brilliant hockey player. Halmo hit on Yakupov"

677795,Live2fish85,2012-03-20 02:23:00,1633," What do you know about celebrating when it comes to hockey lol. I hate to say it but I am sure there are some leafs fans here that remember the leafs winning the cup.  I don't know any sens fans that do. Maybe in your future you will but probably not for along time. Remember as yes the leafs play like crap, in the nhl the objective is to win the cup not make it to the playoffs to blow it all in the first round lol."

676621,jedimaster,2012-03-16 02:15:00,3472,"It just seemed like there was a talk before the game for the rangers not to touch crosby, on his assist he had two that that could have pasted him, he is still skating with his head down, its just a matter of time before he gets levelled and is out again. IMO, if he goes down again he is done for good. No use in eating from a straw to just to play hockey."

676743,jedimaster,2012-03-16 15:28:00,3472,"Pens are strong, and I have always been a big fan of crosby. However I am not a jaded hockey fan. I see it for what it is. He looked like a leafer out there. poking at pucks from 6 feet away. Hopefully he listens to Cherry this time and keeps out of the mix or he is gonna be just begging for someone to run him through the boards. New York even looked like they were going easy on him throughout the game. A chop here and there, but noone seemed to want to rub him out. Big mistake letting him get back into the lineup this year, imo. Once the playoffs roll around if he is producing points people aren't going to go easy on him. Especially teams like Boston and New York."

I didn't catch the end of the game, so I checked the box score on NHL.com and I swore I saw that Sid had 2 assists, and then I looked just now and it says one.  He was up there for 2, I'm sure of it, last night.  Good point on Jedi, as well.  I'm born and raised in southwestern Ontario, Leafs fan my whole life, but beyond that, I'm a hockey fan pure and simple and I like watching talented players and teams play good hockey.  You're just as likely to find me watching a Calgary game or a Pens game as you would a Leafs game (moreso lately, cause the Leafs just plain suck!).  There's no denying Sid is one of the best ever and arguably the best player currently playing.  To come back after missing the last 40 games and still be able to contribute - not sure there's many out there who could do that. And if he can keep his melon intact, it's only going to get better through the rest of the season and post-season.  And yes, I'm starting the ""fire Burke"" chant, right now ....."

Turns out I'm not crazy after all!  They at first said he got his stick on the shot from Letang and deflected it to Dupuis who then scored.  That was his second assist in the 3rd period.  Then, Crosby WASN'T listed in the box score on the assist.  And now, I just checked and he's listed again.  Go figure.  http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2011021054&navid=sb:recap"
