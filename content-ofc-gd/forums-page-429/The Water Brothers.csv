I didn't relise how these carp destroy existing fish habitat and how they effect the fishing and water activities we all enjoy. The red neck fishing was quit entertaining, I don't think the Mounties will take kindly to it. I think the bearers to stop them from getting into the great lakes are kind of a Mickey Mouse. But what else can be done. It's only a matter of time.  Also enjoyed their interview on the Agenda with Steve Paikin.  Looking forward to seeing their other shows in the series on water.  Good work Water Brothers!"
