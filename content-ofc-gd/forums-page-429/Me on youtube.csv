I plan on making a fishing one sometime soon, just need to figure out the topic... maybe an ice fishing one where people float away.  http://youtu.be/8xYMjotzGAU"

677167,jedimaster,2012-03-18 02:02:00,3472,"haha, yah no doubt the kids think they are so funny. It took us about 3 hours to make this one in cluding the effects... Dragon Movie  imagine 3 hours for 30 seconds. But what else is there to do when its pouring rain and the boat is still in storage."
677171,Twocoda,2012-03-18 02:09:00,4130, ive invested alot more time than three hours for less then 30 seconds of satisfaction...lol...

So I thought I would show them how. A point a click digital camera and some patience. Each movie is about 300 individual pictures."
677177,jedimaster,2012-03-18 02:14:00,3472,P.s. It sure beats playing barbie. I always get stuck being the one the dog ate with a missing leg. Haha
