Meaning, young (or foolish - not saying this was the case) folk heading out eager at either the start or end of the season to enjoy their past time. In a lot of cases, undue risks are unknowingly or naively taken. It's just too bad."

I paddle whitewater and while the weather may be gorgeous in late winter/early spring, chances are I'll still be in my drysuit if I'm any distance from the car or a road. Will have to look for it but there was a formula that determined ambient temperature and water temperature and time till hypothermia set in and it was sobering.  For many, the shock of total immersion in frigid waters can lead to cardiac issues or sudden gasping (which may introduce water to the lungs).  Stay safe, keep a dry bag of extra clothes and understand the local conditions and you minimize your chances of a very bad day."
