677193,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-18 02:50:00,10439,Got an email from Cabelas tonight offering a free fishing app. Haven't checked it out as I have a Blackberry. Looks pretty cool though and the price is right!!!  Recon Fishing App  They have a Hunting Version too.
677201,EC1,2012-03-18 03:01:00,930,"Just wondering, does anyone know the security of these fishing apps? When I track myself with these apps, does someone else have access to this data and my GPS spots without my permission? Especially when they're claiming that you can ""share"" your reports.  It feels an awful lot like the story that you can be tracked just by taking pictures and posting them onto the internet.  I do think that this app sounds very promising though. Would be great for me because my fishing diaries get recorded probably less than 50% of the time."
