676411,jedimaster,2012-03-15 16:19:00,3472,"Yah, well as we all know burnt out headlights are the gateway crime to arson and murder.  Live and learn I guess. Change the headlight in the parking lot at crappy tire instead of doing it at home."

676437,jedimaster,2012-03-15 17:39:00,3472,"Yah, it was an experience, that's for sure. there was about at least a hundred people also there for a first appearence, from the sounds of it, 50 percent of these people were people that had multiple tickets, speeding/no insurance slip etc... I was the only one there for just a single infraction of a burnt out headlight. I still think I would have been fine being pulled over for a burnt out headlight if somethign else was missing, like a ran through stop light or a missing insurance or speeding or something, but really pulled over for a burnt out hedlight then get just the single charge. Such a waste of public funds. I blame it on the liberals. lol.... sorry just a jab.  Thanks again for all the comments in here, if I hadn't have posted here I likely would have just paid it. I am glad I didn't."

676489,bassfighter,2012-03-15 20:31:00,366,"I am glad to hear you have won your case, since it was an honest mistake, and you were sincerely about to rectify the issue.  I knew another friend who got similar ticket when he was on his way to Canadain tire to buy his lightbulb to replace the busted one. I  presuaded him to fight his case in court as well. This fellow was in such bad luck getting tickets, he got a ticket once from driving too close to a parked police car on the freeway at 2am in the morning when no other car was on site.   He did not know that one should avoid the lane closest to a parked cop car if possible.  I also knew another friend who has not change his busted head lights for almost 4 months even if he was aware of it. He was just too lazy and got away with it.  A car with a busted light coming towards us can be mistaken as a motorcycle, we cannot be 100% sure which lane the car with the busted light coming towards us, depending on which Left or right front headlights were busted."
676503,irishfield,2012-03-15 21:27:00,26272,Did they throw it out because the JP/Judge sided with you... or the cop didn't show up?
676517,camillj,2012-03-15 22:33:00,1988,"  Aw Crap ... I guess I need to prepare better ... we paid ours  ... Firstly I'm glad justice prevailed for you bud ... for me ... on the other hand .... my wife came home from dropping my daughter off at a friends condo-townhouse ... all pale and  lets just say ... cranky .... it seems some smart-arsss cop followed her into the condo complex and gave her a $150 ticket because her licence plate light was burnt out ... we had her car oil change/light checked (at a reputable establishment) less than a month prior ... anyhow instead of giving her a heads up so she could fix the problem (because lets face it we dont ALLL walk round our car evey time we get in it ... they hit her with a ticket and some cockamamy lecture about the law .... and NOW ... we all hate traffic cops ... WELL DONE ... Public Relations classes can now be cancelled because clearly everyone ""gets it"""
676537,blarg,2012-03-15 23:09:00,289,"What i don't understand about this at the most basic level, is that isn't it most likely your plate light, or any light, would burn out while you were driving the car?  Which aside from the headlight that you might notice, you likely wouldn't be aware of the bad light, and through no fault of your own.  That being the case how could any police officer determine that you were knowingly driving with a light out?  The short answer is that they couldn't, meaning at worst you should receive a warning, unless there is some record (if they even keep records of warnings) of you being warned before.  Are you supposed to stop every 5k and check you plate light? Don't think so."
676558,jedimaster,2012-03-16 00:03:00,3472,"It was the first appearance, so The officer wasn't there, but I am pretty sure they dont attend first appearences. I am not sure if it was a justice of the peace or judge or clerk or what, I don't think i would know the difference. Everyone just waited in line, and got called into an office one at a time. She looked at the ticked, asked if I fixed it. I said yes, she said, ok I'll cancel the ticket, you can go. Now why this couldn't have been done the first time I went to arrange the first appearence is beyond me, but in the end it cost me 10 dollars in parking fees, and two half days pay, but noone really noticed at work so I think I may have snuck out on that one.  In this case I knew it went out as I already had bought the lightbulb not 5 minutes before I got pulled over. Pretty frustrating, but what really can I do? It got dropped, and in the end I guess only cost me 10 dollars in parking donations and some time. Believe me, I have been raked over the coals a few times, and this one was minor, and I am very happy its not on my record. Minor offense or not. I didn't want it there."
676561,jedimaster,2012-03-16 00:08:00,3472,"Cam, I feel for you, just fix it, take a picture of it, and go get a court date. Its not something that should happen but it does. Fight it. In fact I have never fought tickets, but now I think I always will."

She is out there tying up the court system with this drivel and wasting everyones time and money!If it turns out that they support her actions, well at least you will know what state we are really in in this Country!  I mean, come on, would I have stopped him, yes of course, but only to make him aware. That's it! In the mean time, there are absolute morons out on the streets pulling all kinds of crap that IS SERIOUS, but this cop is busy playing her little games!

Even is he beats the charge...which I'm sure he will...the man is still out a bunch of $$$$ from work, plus all his inconvenience.

661395,jedimaster,2012-01-28 15:11:00,3472,"Yah, I am surprised about the amount of attention this got here and thanks to all the supporters. I am happy for the suppot but I think my options are and were limited to the three little check boxes the second she wrote the ticket. Anyway, I am hoping I get a reasonable justice of the peace or whoever it is that I see whenever I see them.  I dunno, maybe she really thought I was really doing public danger driving in the city with one headlight. Maybe she just got reamed out by her boss to give more tickets, Maybe someone in a grey corolla ran over her cat when she was a child, maybe she thought I looked at her funny, maybe it was that time of the month. I really don't know. She was determined to give me that ticket though I can tell you that much. She didn't give me any chance or anything. Before I knew what was going on she had it written up and it was in my hand, and I was trying to plead my case for all of 5 seconds before she was off.  I am angry about it, yes. It does serve to taint my already not so high opinion of certain various police departments and there procedures. I don't think it was right. I really think she could have given me a warning, or followed me home, or told me to change it and come in to the department or something. I really don't even see what the big deal is to be honest with you. Its not like my car is invisible in the city with one headlight. Its not like I can't see where I am going or like I can't see pedestrians. I mean the whole point of mandating cars to have 2 headlights on a car is so that if one goes out you can see with the other.  I think we should just put this one to rest until I go to court and deal with it. I'll be certain to update everyone on the proceedings for sure, and thanks again for everyone support, especially the PM's."

660723,SlowPoke,2012-01-26 19:54:00,2984," The amber lights you're talking about are marker lights. The amber lights mentioned in Wayne's post refer to fog lights. We don't see them that often nowadays. People often refer to white auxillary/driving lamps as fog lights but they just add glare when fog is present.  I believe 'by the letter of the law' she is not wrong for issuing a ticket but it seems insane considering; you had the replacement bulb with you, I assume it was daylight by the time of your post and I'll also assume you were polite.  That might not be enough to toss the ticket. Imagine how pissed off you'll be taking time off work to lose the case."

(1)  When on a highway at any time from one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after sunrise and at any other time when, due to insufficient light or unfavourable atmospheric conditions, persons and vehicles on the highway are not clearly discernible at a distance of 150 metres or less, every motor vehicle other than a motorcycle shall carry three lighted lamps in a conspicuous position, one on each side of the front of the vehicle which shall display a white or amber light only, and one on the rear of the vehicle which shall display a red light only   For less than a days pay (i.e. taking the day off work) you can get a paralegal to represent  you in court. The charge will more than likely be tossed (there are no sure things in court) , especially if you have proof you had a replacement bulb with you. the question is, which will be cheaper - the ticket or the para. That cop must have been having a bad day if the exchange between the two of you was respectful (not necessarily the case for commercial motor vehcles in the Windsor area - but that is another story altogether).

They will take the info and submit it. You will then get a letter in the mail telling you the time and date of the preliminary meeting with the crown. At that time have the receipt and ticket with you, the crown will throw it out right then. I went threw this crap in the fall with my CLEAR license plate cover.

660680,jedimaster,2012-01-26 18:17:00,3472,"Yah I have a two amber lights one on each side, and one headlight was working. As for the mailing it says you cannot set a trial date by mail."
660681,jimmer,2012-01-26 18:19:00,2730,Just go to where you pay the ticket and setup an appointment for a meeting with the crown and bring the ticket and receipt. The Justice of the Peace should throw it out.
660682,jedimaster,2012-01-26 18:20:00,3472,However it says the head lights must be able to operate at high and low beam.  My low beam that was burnt out still worked as high beam. so I guess the amber light canbe low beam and the high beam can be high beam?
660686,fishing n autograph,2012-01-26 18:24:00,2540,"wow, i don't even give those tickets....and i'm a traffic cop"
660691,lew,2012-01-26 18:37:00,12766," So what's his next move Dave, so he doesn't have to pay that ridiculous ticket plus lose a days pay in court ??"
660693,strik,2012-01-26 18:42:00,175,"think the whole thing sucks you had the light with you   I got luckey enought to get a speeding ticked (my fault cop was good )  On the back  if you look at option 3 i belive thats what you want   send in the ticket with out payment  check  option 3  in a couple weeks  you will know  when  your  trial  will be.  They call Option 3 Trial Option,Ontario Court of Justice, Provinical Offences Office  Hope this help  your ticket might be different"
660694,jedimaster,2012-01-26 18:43:00,3472,My best guess is I'll go to court and pay  half the fine or something like that. Thats what happened to me the last time I was told to take a ticket to court. That one was for having the wrong color boat number stickers on my boat.
660695,John,2012-01-26 18:43:00,2956,"Got stopped last week for 68km in a 50km zone..........fair 'nuf.........however when I handed my insurance slip to the police office he politely told me that it had expired and could he see a current one, told him I would look for it. Well it took me 5 mins or so to sort though all of the crap in the folder it is usually in, finally found it. When he came back to the car I presented it to him and he said ""sorry, ticket has been issued, ($60), fight it in court""."
660696,fishing n autograph,2012-01-26 18:43:00,2540,"Only thing he can do is show up to court/request a first attendence meeting with the crown and show proof that he fixed it. I know thats how our court works, i'm not 100% sure about Toronto.  Like I said, I've never given a ticket for a burnt out headlight. Its a reason to stop and talk to you, and let you know you have a light out for your safety, but I wouldn't tag you for. That being said, if you have illegal headlights (different colours) then you might get a ticket."
660697,TennesseeGuy,2012-01-26 18:44:00,957,"It's a good idea to replace headlights in pairs rather than one at a time.  When one dies, the other is soon to follow."
660698,jedimaster,2012-01-26 18:47:00,3472,Its hard to find headlights all the same color. I had bought a pair of the only ones in the right size they had for my car at ctc. they are slightly whiter/bluer than the originals. I guess I better not drive with one slightly yellowy standard one and one slightly brighter/blueier one. I am bound to get nabbed for that on my way home tonight. hehe
660700,fishing n autograph,2012-01-26 18:48:00,2540,"white/off white etc are fine...i'm talking about the dummies who put red, purple, dark green lights that make their rice rocket look cool"
660701,BillM,2012-01-26 18:49:00,17367,"I wouldn't admit guilt, there's no way a police officer should have given you a ticket while you were on your way home with a NEW bulb ready for replacement.  Plead not guilty, get your court date and the judge will probably get a laugh and toss it out.  I'm all for going in and pleading to a lessor charge if you've actually done someone wrong, but no way I'd do that in this case.  That's complete Bull.  Make sure you bring your receipt with you that shows the time/date on it!!   Easily showing you knew you had the issue and were in the process of fixing it."
660704,jedimaster,2012-01-26 18:52:00,3472,"We will see what happens I guess. I am gonna go in tomorrow morning before work to the arrange a court date thingy. It opens at 8:30 so if I go in early enough I might be able to sneak into work without anyone noticing, and only lose a single days pay when I go to the actual trial."
660713,lew,2012-01-26 19:23:00,12766," And isn't that a complete farce !!!!!!  A man does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG and is actually getting ready to fix the stupid bulb like he's sposed to, yet he's still gonna forfeit a days pay.  If I was the judge I'd make the dopey cop with no more smarts than a fence post reimburse his lost money plus pay the court costs too.  Jeeez, I don't usually get riled up but this kinda crap needs to stop !!!!!"
660718,bubbles,2012-01-26 19:41:00,591,"I am with Lew on this one, this is a total pile of crap.  It's Bull no matter how you look at, you are losing because some schmuck cop was on a power trip."
660720,jedimaster,2012-01-26 19:43:00,3472,boy o boy lew I am glad you're on my side.
660597,jedimaster,2012-01-26 15:16:00,3472,"So I had a burnt out headlight, Went to crappy tire, to buy a light was on my way back to my place to change it and I got pulled over. I wasn't speeding, didn't miss a signal or cut someone off. Yep I got pulled over for having a burnt out headlight. I told her that it just burnt out and I just bought a headlight and was on my way to replace it at home and she said, take a picture of it and set a trial date.  Been on hold now for 49 minutes waiting... sheesh man... I would love to say how pissed I am about this but I will just hold off.  Anyway it must be quota time in the GTA so make sure you got your nuts tightened."
660599,mike rousseau,2012-01-26 15:21:00,4661,Brutal...
660601,SirCranksalot,2012-01-26 15:23:00,3291,That's ridiculous!!!  Not a great way to encourage the public to have respect for the law!!!
660602,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-26 15:24:00,0,"precisely why law enforcement doesn't have my respect.  many of them are just bullies with badges.  and the females often have bigger ""balls"" than the males do."
660604,fishingfarmer,2012-01-26 15:25:00,34,   That it total Bull.You had the light and were on the way home.Actually the key word was she. I got pulled over for a seat belt .The thing that made me mad was I had it on .My coat and seat belt were almost the same colour.It was my word against hers.I did not win.
660605,SlowPoke,2012-01-26 15:27:00,2984,I hope she's proud of herself; you could have killed someone running around in daylight with one headlight out. Medal of Honour.
660608,jedimaster,2012-01-26 15:30:00,3472,"Crap, spent 68 minutes on the phone just to be told, and I quote ""The cop didn't know what she was talking about, you don't phone the number you have to come in in person to request a trial""  Looks like another waste of time.  I mean I was pretty much fuming and am still abit tempered about it. But of course she has the taser so I guess I have no choice. If I was speeding or something, or cut someone off, or whatever, yah give me the headlight as an extra. Or if she was loking for somethign and found nothing, seriously why not just a warning, or an escourt home around the block so I can change it. Man o Man, this is exactly why my faith in the folks in blue have lost my respect a long time ago. Not only that a cop without signals on was behing me on my way to work this morning at a light. I was turning left and so were they. He did a double lane change around me and almost side swiped a car coming towards us making a right.  I want to pull my hair out."
660610,mike rousseau,2012-01-26 15:36:00,4661,There are some good ones out there tho...  I got pulled over cause all my trailer lights were out... I told him they were working the day before... The cop said he had a boat as well and understood how often lights can go out and wiring harnesses come loose...  He asked how far I had to go... I said 2 blocks... So he followed me home so I didn't get rear ended...  So it can be one extreme to the next... You would think there should be consistency... Like ISO for coppers...
660611,lew,2012-01-26 15:41:00,12766,I'd be taking the ticket plus the bill of sale for the new light and heading straight to the cop shop  to talk to whoever is in charge.  Nobody has any control over when a light will burn out and I can't see any way you should have been charged.  That cop needs to be raked over the coals by her boss.  Used to be a time when you were given 24 hours to fix stuff like that and then just take the car in so the cop can see it was repaired.
660612,bigugli,2012-01-26 15:42:00,6138," We have a winner!!!  After Ford's budget battle, every municipal service is being pushed to tighten belts and drum up revenue. It's the way the system works."
660614,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-26 15:44:00,0,"hey wait, aren't you a habs fan?  case solved."
660617,jedimaster,2012-01-26 15:49:00,3472,No way leafs all the way. So just out of protest I am going to leave one of the lights the old yellow stock ones and the other one is a super ultra bright blue one. If you ever see the silve franken light corolla thats me in protest. Damn. Too bad it actually wasn't pirate day. I am sure I got that ticket for actually joking about being pulled over for having a burnt out light bulb.
660621,jedimaster,2012-01-26 15:51:00,3472,And btw I don't mean this to turn into a bash to cops thread. I mearly wanted to post to people and tell them to do a double check because they must be out for every little thing.
660632,Rod Caster,2012-01-26 16:15:00,5784,did she think your bulb was defective because it was flashing every time you made a turn?? Was her last name Wiggum?  
660636,SBCregal,2012-01-26 16:17:00,688,"on the back of the ticket, isnt there options for how to proceed?  you have 15 days in most cases to respond and several options, you can request a trial date and plead guilty, guilty with a reason or try and fight it.  im pretty sure you dont have to go in person to request trial."
660637,bassjnkie,2012-01-26 16:20:00,1101,"Exact same thing happened to me a few years back. I noticed the light was out, so I bought one at CT. Problem is the headlight has to be removed to change the bulb. Well I left CT and got pulled over 500m down the road. I explained the situation and showed him the bulb. Without a care he handed me a hefty ticket. Oh, well. Fortunately it was thrown out in court."
660638,BillM,2012-01-26 16:21:00,17367,"Request a court date on the back of the ticket, drop it in the mail.  You'll receive your court date in a month or so."
660640,OhioFisherman,2012-01-26 16:28:00,6623,"Here in the states I have been stopped for having a license plate light out, although not recently, no ticket though.  The reality of the situation is this, traffic stops result in the apprehension of people for other criminal activities. Our local police reports confirm this, people stopped for minor traffic offenses and found to be drug mules, drunk, carrying concealed weapons with out permits, people in possession of stolen property.  Granted in your case it seems extreme, but consider how many excuses a police officer hears? Heck I got stopped returning from a fishing trip with Deg, it was my own fault and I admitted it, and received just a warning."
660642,lew,2012-01-26 16:28:00,12766,Going to court is gonna cost a days pay too.  This whole thing is a crock and should never have happened.  Not many things worse than a punk cop on a power trip.
660646,Big Cliff,2012-01-26 16:39:00,6899,  X 2 on that one! The ticket will be dated and the time will be marked on it. The receipt will be dated and the time marked on it. You can go in at your conveinence!
660650,capt bruce,2012-01-26 16:55:00,820,"Funny but I had the same thing happen to me but I was given I think it was a 24 hour thing . I went home changed the light drove right to police station ,maybe a half hour latter .. Told the guy at desk what had happened,showed him the ticket , he asked ""you changed light "" , I told him car is outside .. He said case closed , I was so mad he did not even go outside (was a cold raining night) to even check ..."
660655,BillM,2012-01-26 17:00:00,17367,"Bruce, you got a 'fix it' ticket..   I've had them before.    This is what the OP should have got to be honest.  I can't believe the cop even gave him a ticket, lol!  Should we start posting our good cop/bad cop stories?  I've got some great ones!!!"
660662,jedimaster,2012-01-26 17:45:00,3472,"haha, don't get me started, on good cop bad cop... the guy on the phone said there is no way to get a court date unless I go in and request one, so this will be two days pay."
660663,irishfield,2012-01-26 17:47:00,26272,Check the traffic act... I know you are only required to have ONE brake light and I'm pretty sure you only have to have ONE white light on the front of your vehicle as well. Signals are not required if you stick your arm out the window!
660664,Headhunter,2012-01-26 17:51:00,5703,"That sucks! perhaps FishnAutographs will chime in with some knowledge... But I have to question... why not just use ""The Force"" on the cop....? HH"
