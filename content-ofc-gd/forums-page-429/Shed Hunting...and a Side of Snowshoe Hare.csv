676070,JustinHoffman,2012-03-14 14:47:00,482,"Hello All,  With the warm weather of today, and with an itching to find a spent antler, I headed out with camera in hand for a day of shed hunting.  Conditions varied at my favourite hiking spot. Deep snow in some spots, bare ground in others, and miniature ponds scattered amongst them for good measure. Regardless of the terrain, wearing only a t-shirt and having the sun shine on my face sure felt great.  I have certainly had a fascination over the years for finding a deer antler. But, for the many miles  I’ve walked in the woods, a shed I have yet to spot. The signs were excellent on this outing – dozens of deer trails, plenty of scrapes, and scat everywhere.  Sadly, after 5 hours and 8.6 kilometres of working the brush, I came up empty handed.  I did find plenty of this:    And a couple of these:      As well as a flock of these:    A great day out!!   For the rest of the images, and the full story, feel free to check out my site: http://justinhoffmanoutdoors.com/2012/03/14/shed-hunting-and-a-side-of-snowshoe-hare/   Cheers,  Justin"
676115,NAW,2012-03-14 17:51:00,4022,"Keep at it.. You'll find something.  you'l have to, with all the sign you've been seing.  I hope to go for a walk this weekend.  I'll post a pic if I find anything."
676118,JustinHoffman,2012-03-14 17:57:00,482,"Thanks, Nick. Going to give it another try later this weeks. The amount of deer in this area is ridiculous. But, it is a big area to cover. Any specific spots I should key in on?  Cheers,  Justin"
676121,NAW,2012-03-14 18:03:00,4022,"I've never been shed hunting myself.  I just stumble across them while turkey hunting/scouting.  I would be looking specifically for beat down game trails. There are some deer highways around here, that are trampled down to mud, even in the winter.  That's where I'm going to start my hunt.  Also, areas that look good for bedding down.  Areas with tall grass, along the edge of a fields.  The scubby areas between bush a field."
676122,Bob,2012-03-14 18:07:00,370,"If there are many porcupines around, chances of finding sheds are slim, porkies chew them up pretty quick. Mice chew on them too."
676127,Pikeslayer,2012-03-14 18:16:00,1443,"Justin, You may find this article of interest:  http://www.ontariooutofdoors.com/hunting/BigGame/?ID=322&a=read  Good Luck and Happy Hunting  Simon"
676132,JustinHoffman,2012-03-14 18:34:00,482,"Thanks for the tips and the article, guys - much appreciated. Yes, their are porkies around for sure. I'm wondering with our mild winter, they may have dropped early and been chewed up by now. The area does allow dog walking within it. Talked to a woman last week that told me her dog routinely brings back 5 or 6 sheds each season while running through the bush.  Ahh, regardless of finding any...always good to be out in nature.  Cheers,  Justin"
676139,cityfisher,2012-03-14 18:50:00,959,"on the couple lots I hunt on,,, ive never found a shed,,, eventhough there are lots of deer by the time i go for a walk in late april.. Most i assume are chewed up"
676150,Leecher,2012-03-14 19:13:00,7832,"Justin, been hunting deer since I'm 12 years old and never found any sheds while exploring the bush  maybe because I never paid too much attention to them    but I sure would seek their bedding area if I was looking... good luck with your hunt  Tight lines Leechman"
676222,Skud,2012-03-14 22:40:00,739,I have been out also with nothing to show for my efforts. Actually it has been several years now with no treasures found. Will be out again tomorrow with camera in hand
676230,NAW,2012-03-14 22:56:00,4022,"You guys need to release some Fishers in your area to eat the Porcupines, so you can find some nice antelers before they get eatin"
676232,Joeytier,2012-03-14 23:02:00,3990,Beautiful shots.  Those waxwings are among the prettiest birds ontario has to offer.
676253,vance,2012-03-15 00:59:00,719,I know sheds are hard to find but the two I have found were both wedged in a branch in a tree.I guess they were removed on purpose by a buck.   vance
676254,Joeytier,2012-03-15 01:05:00,3990,ps.  time to make up some snares while the snow's still down...
676925,Rustic-Fisher,2012-03-17 00:40:00,826,Does this count as shed hunting???? goofy dog came running out of the bush as proud as could be carrying this deer leg

677243,JustinHoffman,2012-03-18 14:21:00,482,"Hey Jim,  Checked online - porky scat is more cylindrical and has a curve at the end. Fairly certain it is deer...but I could be mistaken.  Anyone else have an opinion?  Cheers,  Justin"
677433,NAW,2012-03-19 01:48:00,4022,"Well Justin.  Me, my wife, and my nephew spent a good 4 hours in the bush today.  And not one shed to be had...  Tons of sign, but no sheds.."
677453,ch312,2012-03-19 05:09:00,1590," i've probably seen thousands of piles of deer scat and that pile in the pic you posted is 3-4 times bigger than the largest pile of deer scat i've come across. i've never seen anything like that, but we don't have any porky's around here either.  i googled to see what porky crap looks like and i came across a few pics exactly like yours. like other critters, diet probably affects the size and shape of porky's in different areas."
677559,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-19 17:08:00,130,"NICE POST...NATURE IS GREAT ISN'T IT. THE WAXWINGS ARE COOL WHEN THEY START TO PASS THE BERRIES BACK AND FORTH TO EACH OTHER AND SOMETIMES GET TIPPY FROM THE FERMENTED BERRIES   I LIKE THE RABBIT...BET IT WOULD TASTE GOOD WITH SOME VEGTABLES, A NICE GRAVY AND SOME PIE CRUST...JUST THINKING. AS FAR AS YOUR ANTLERS, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET SOME WITH SOME MEAT LEFT ON AND MAYBE 4 LEGS TOO"
