I saw a good debate here to day be aloud to settle its self , a first since i've been a member , i saw a newbie be aloud to speak back in his own defence , and i saw the moderators patiences as will as see him do a fine job as an out standing moderator can do . I saw the boundarys get pushed back on both sides of the board here today and  i can say i saw the changes that have been asked for by its members  . Thank you  thank you , my faith in this place was restored as i think it was for many  . Thank you mods for making the extra effort in what it took to judge how much salt ends up in every ones wounds . And i hope its members will know when enough salt is enough as well .	Job well done  .... just a word from Skipper Kissingger to the place i am proud to be a member of . I hope the feeling is mutual by us all ."

677733,Billy Bob,2012-03-20 00:26:00,5865, NOT much from my view point........but locked threads happen for a reason....
677735,Billy Bob,2012-03-20 00:26:00,5865, And you're not the only one.....
677774,ChrisK,2012-03-20 01:17:00,2772,"As long as everyone remains civil there's no reason to lock down any thread of this nature. Maybe,just maybe we can all learn from this one and perhaps future controversial threads may go the distance as well."
