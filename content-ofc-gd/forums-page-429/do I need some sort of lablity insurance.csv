676649,bramptonjerry,2012-03-16 03:55:00,132,i have a 14 ft Lund wide body and a 20 HP yamaha on a fairly remote part of the French....do  need insurance?....What do you guys do?...Have never asked anyone about this but am wondering
676651,bigugli,2012-03-16 04:14:00,6138,"You are operating a motorized vessel on a public waterway. I'm still amazed that it is not a requirement considering just about every other motorized recreational vehicle, ie; skidoo, atv, require insurance Even though boater insurance is not mandatory at this time, good sense would dictate you have some manner of coverage"
676653,bramptonjerry,2012-03-16 04:25:00,132,"what sort, and how much do I need?"
676664,davey buoy,2012-03-16 08:37:00,5505," I would think liability at least,would be a minimum of $1,000,000.00."
676669,skeeter,2012-03-16 10:26:00,1907,Boat insurance is cheap. Peace of mind is even better.
676670,misfish,2012-03-16 10:29:00,29133, Yep.
676674,ecmilley,2012-03-16 11:16:00,2163,"my bass boat is covered under my home policy about 100 bux extra a year, phone your insurance company your home policy covers you automatically depending on the size of your motor, my policy was no charge up to 25 hp then added extra from there"
676675,spooner_jr,2012-03-16 11:16:00,193,"If you have house (or renters) insurance, most companies provide liability coverage for lower powered watercraft (25 hp and under)."
677502,fisher,2012-03-19 14:31:00,451,"Why would operating a boat legally (regardless of the horse power motor) exclude you from the liability coverage on your house insurance if you were to injure someone accidentally?  From my understanding, as long as you are doing things legally (ie. operating a boat while not impaired, tossing a baseball with your son and having a mis-thrown ball cause an accident, etc...), you are covered in case of an accident.  I also asked this question to my insurance company regarding hunting.  If I accidently shoot someone while hunting am I excluded from the personal liability coverage on my insurance policy.  After having to confirm with their head office, they came back and said I would be covered (again, as long as I was not under the influence, and abiding by all laws, etc...).  For this reason, I opted out of the OFAH membership fees when contiplating them for the liability coverage it provides."
677509,Ralph Field,2012-03-19 14:59:00,1018,"With my insurance company they said I was covered towing my boat to and from the lake, but that I wasn't covered when my boat was in the water. I would definitely check to see if you have on the water liability with your insurance company."
677549,OutdoorDan,2012-03-19 16:39:00,325,"If you just want liability insurance it is insanely cheap.  The marina that I'm going to be docked at this year actually requires 2mm liability coverage, I think this is a pretty good policy."
677556,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-19 16:53:00,1022,"As mentioned above, check with your insurance company and see if they can add it to your house insurance policy. With Meloche Monnex, it was included and it didn't even cost me anything extra given the value and specs of my boat."
677565,bubbles,2012-03-19 17:53:00,591,"  Interesating point.... I always assumed that since it""s on your home it for for tings that happen at your home, you have separate liability on your car, mottorcycle...etc so why do you expect a boat to be different?"
677834,OutdoorDan,2012-03-20 06:50:00,325, Unfortunately I doubt that if it actually came down to it you would have much luck proving that you were operating a firearm legally and as per safety standards if you shot someone.
677867,fisher,2012-03-20 13:09:00,451,  happened here...but I do hear you.  http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/728419--deer-hunter-cleared-in-hiker-s-death
