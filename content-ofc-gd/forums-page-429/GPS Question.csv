The fellow there indicated that I would need to buy the chips that have the lake maps, specifically Simcoe and Georgian Bay what I want.  So, is there a place that sells these individually  rather than the whole bunch that I'll never use for a price that's more than the GPS.  I'm interested in that model as it has 12V DC capability for the boat, don't have to rely on batteries.  Thanks."
