I was in the Canadian Tire store at the Centre Mall in Hamilton just a short while ago and was strolling through the fishing department. Looked up at the several canoes they were displaying balanced upside down from the aisle racks and there was a 14.5 foot green Pelican with 2 molded seats reduced from $699, to a lower price, then again to a lower price then again to a new lower price and then down to $379.99!!  If anyone can use an inexpensive canoe you have a chance to grab one there."
