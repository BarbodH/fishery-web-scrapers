676906,Old Man,2012-03-16 23:25:00,822," In June and July we fish the shallow bays of our lake pitching Hot n Tots for smallmouth. We catch a lot of nice smallies, but also pile of good size walleye and of course huge northerns and muskie at the same time. We usually wear the color off a Hot n Tot in a few days or loose a few each year to bite offs from huge northerns and muskies. My biggest muskie 46"" I caught was on a flame red early one evening while fishing for smallies. Hooked him by the corner of the mouth and spent 15 to 20 minutes to land him"

677084,wormdunker,2012-03-17 21:31:00,1711,"I usually target walleye & use the go getters that Nipfisher posted pix of.  I tie my own in the winter as a hobby on a cold, rainy day.  In my boat I will usually have 40 - 50 different styles & colors.  My go to color is perch or chartreuse.  When the bite is slow I'll even try black, gold, silver & sometimes purple."
677114,Ralph Field,2012-03-17 23:27:00,1018,For steelhead the Dominion 377 is by far the best spoon I've ever used. Dominion was sold to Lucky Strike and they marketed it as the Wizzard(brass) and the Lizzard(steel) but stopped producing the smaller size and now you can only get them in a size which is too large for steelhead.

Haven't seen them for years...no need for steel leaders as they were built on a long metal shank...

I almost always bring 2 tackle stores worth on a short half day trip, so limiting myself would be really difficult.  I like Leechman's breakdown.  top water: zara spook  mid depth (down to 12 feet or so): any number of rapalas, husky jerks, x-raps  deeper: deep taildancers and the mid depth ones on a three way  And always enough jigs to sink a battleship.  My first colour option is almost always ""natural"", that's me, but it is also about the clear waters that I tend to fish most often."
