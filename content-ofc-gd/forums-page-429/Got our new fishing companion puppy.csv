635799,Fish Farmer,2011-10-30 11:14:00,2234,"Congrats on the new fishin partner, Chris may have a life jacket for him. Brooks was getting to small"
635801,Roy,2011-10-30 11:21:00,13728," YA, what Dave said. Please note that an auto-inflate would be a bad choice. Lifting his little leg for relief only to have the PFD trigger would cause him to not pee for a year."
635802,Billy Bob,2011-10-30 11:29:00,5865,Cute pup.......love the ears...  Life Jacket ? ? ?  all you need is a large bobber attached to the collar...
635804,skeeter,2011-10-30 11:38:00,1907,"Life jacket? I've seen what happens when Joey sets the hook or tries to lift a fish into the boat. I think a ""life jacket"" for him would be a full body Kevlar suit with safety glasses.  :tease:"
635811,Spiel,2011-10-30 12:20:00,9065, LOL....I put Brook on a diet and she's now good with her life jacket.       
635816,solopaddler,2011-10-30 12:33:00,8605,  Musky Bait.   Congrat's on the new pooch Joey!
635828,Jer,2011-10-30 13:07:00,1426,"Wow, you guys don't waste any time. Cute pup!"
635835,John,2011-10-30 13:21:00,2956, Naaaa definitely Roy's eyes. Congrat's guys he's much cuter than Paul!
635860,Joey,2011-10-30 13:52:00,9122,"Thanks everyone, and for the suggestions to knit him a firetiger sweater  He's doing very well and slept from midnight to 6 a.m.  I thought that was pretty good. He's eating, drinking, pooping, peeing and playing, so things look to be in order.  Alot of laughs already with the little guy.  Cheers!"
635867,Beans,2011-10-30 14:05:00,3339, Or lunch maybe for Digger...
635888,Jewelbee,2011-10-30 16:35:00,422,Congratulations guys! He is SWEET!

If I can offer one piece of advice...leave only Paul's stuff out in the open for the first few months as the little guy will need to practice his chewing skills.  Really happy for you both here.  Can't wait to see him reel in his first muskie!!!!"
