677416,muskymatt,2012-03-19 00:54:00,2608," WOW, I never thought about mods being leaf(respect  ) fans, and that I would be po'ing them too, interesting concept, I like it!!!  That said, it's all about taking it for what it is, a game!  Well said Dan!  "
677426,Leecher,2012-03-19 01:20:00,7832, Now that's more like it Matt  Didn't mean to single you out but got a little ticked off by your snarly remarks   I don't usually get involve in this but it was just too much for me   but it's all good now  Tight lines Leechman
677449,Twocoda,2012-03-19 04:35:00,4130,Go Flames GO.....we won one in a row!!!!!!....
677326,Leecher,2012-03-18 21:39:00,7832,One guy can rib a hole lot of fans and gets away with it.... but when a little heat comes his way... thread gets deleled    just saying
677327,[email protected],2012-03-18 21:46:00,119,must be a senoritas fan...........
677330,muskymatt,2012-03-18 22:00:00,2608,Blah blah blah Quit yur whinin Even I'm getting bored reading laff fan drivel! Can you blame them for deleting it?
677332,Leecher,2012-03-18 22:08:00,7832, Blah blah blah... what took you long???  you seem to get a kick from all this   and I'm not even a Leafs fan  Make no mistake about it... Sens are collapsing in the playoffs like it or not    been this way for the longest time  Tight lines and enjoy the open waters
677333,Gerritt,2012-03-18 22:09:00,6129,  Funny..... you are part of the problem.  G
677334,[email protected],2012-03-18 22:10:00,119,meh....not worth arguing when opponents are unarmed
677338,muskymatt,2012-03-18 22:23:00,2608, That funny cause I don't argue with fans of teams who haven't made the playoffs in 7 years bahahahaha
677341,Leecher,2012-03-18 22:31:00,7832, It's funny but I don't think your Sens are going to last much in the off season either   better call Alfie and get a tie off time now before it's too late    but want do I know eh
677343,muskymatt,2012-03-18 22:34:00,2608,"Theoretically, with 16 teams in the playoffs, and only one winner, then 15 teams collapse in the playoffs. Whether you go out in the 1st round or the finals, you still ""collapse"" Now the kicker is, you have to make it to the playoffs, which clearly sets you above the remaining 14 teams who did not make the playoffs. So I would much rather ""collapse"" in the playoffs than ""collapse"" from Oct to April for 7 years in a row, like the Laffs... Bahahahahahha"
677345,[email protected],2012-03-18 22:35:00,119," come at me when you have a Stanley cup, till then, the senoritas will ALWAYS be second fiddle to the LEAFS.  BTW - is Quebec city gonna keep the name senoritas ??"
677352,Leecher,2012-03-18 22:46:00,7832, OK MATT.... now did I spell that RIGHT   or is it....  NAH I wont even go there   Not even worth it   but I give you A+ for trying     Watch your team crumble in the first round    Like they ALWAYS DO  Edit: The Bruins are going to eat your Sens like there's no tomorrow
677355,muskymatt,2012-03-18 22:48:00,2608,Are you a habs fan?
677356,Leecher,2012-03-18 22:49:00,7832, Guess again dude.... NOPE
677359,Whitespinnerbait,2012-03-18 22:58:00,2038, :huh:
677367,Leecher,2012-03-18 23:08:00,7832, What you have to say???  Seems like Sens fan everywhere   Crumble is all I have to say
677381,craigdritchie,2012-03-18 23:35:00,1586,Again .... the Sens couldn't even beat the Leafs. That says it all. They will (once again) fold up like a cheap tent.
677387,Joeytier,2012-03-18 23:58:00,3990,"Some food for thought...Some of you should really take this article to heart. http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7654198/the-writer-crap-my-dad-says-why-your-team-give-damn-you  I like cheering for Montreal, but you won't catch me getting upset over those bunch of goons, let alone throw around childish insults because someone said something wrong about your favorite little group of millionaires"
677392,i2cool2fool,2012-03-19 00:13:00,349,"Joeytier: you're bang on. Tip of the hat to you, sir."
677397,tb4me,2012-03-19 00:26:00,3295,I see the Sens thread has instantly vanished..Mods must be Sens fans...lol  Is there some rule I missed where we cant talk hockey either?
677399,Leecher,2012-03-19 00:28:00,7832,"Craig, they couldn't even beat the Habs in regulation time either     But that's beside the point.  What ticked me off was the bashing and not having any respect for the NHL team name ""The Leafs"" not the laffs.... that has been going on for some time now  At first it was funny, but has it got older, got tireing, irritating and old age.  I know it's all in fun but to me was all wrong.... I don't care who you root for, but please have respect by all means  Just thought I'd shared what triggered this behaviour of mine.  Tight lines Leechman"
677405,aplumma,2012-03-19 00:36:00,6896," ONE of the rules  Debate is encouraged, but please follow the basic guidelines of debate. No name calling. Back up your claims with proof. Don't get your knickers in a knot if someone disagrees. KEEP IT CIVIL!  Talk hockey all you want but if the thread goes South it will be locked or pulled at our discretion.   Art"
677407,Grimace,2012-03-19 00:43:00,2020, Keep that in mind for the religious threads.   :-)
677410,tb4me,2012-03-19 00:46:00,3295,lol thats funny..
677411,danc,2012-03-19 00:46:00,4677,"Well here's a unique combo for you. I'm both a Leafs fan and a mod. As a mod, it's not such a simple job. Nothing is carved in stone. When we delete/lock/edit posts, it makes some folks happy, and others outraged. We often discuss things in our own forum before making a decision. We always try to make the best decisions. I think that we have a good bunch of fairly intelligent mods here who are capable of such decisions.  As a huge Leafs fan, man do they suck lately. I'll be the first to admit that. Being a Leafs fan however, does not control my life. That's why you haven't seen any comments from me on the Leafs threads. I've got way more important things in my life to worry about right now.  So have at ér boys. Play nice so we (mods) don't have to get involved.  GO LEAFS GO!!!!    :thumbsup_anim:"
677413,Grimace,2012-03-19 00:47:00,2020, I try.   :-p
