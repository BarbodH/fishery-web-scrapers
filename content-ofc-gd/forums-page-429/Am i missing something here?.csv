Fishfinder/Chartplotter Lowerance Details: HDS5 Lowerance fishfinder /Chartplotter Three years old, used 6 times, kept indoors during cold weather New Transducer. Paid 780.00 Asking price: $ 550.00   Really? even if you included a map chip (does not say it does) you can get a Gen 2 new for that price from a few sites i've seen, pretty sure the warranty is done after three years."

677028,limeyangler,2012-03-17 17:00:00,5204,"  Thanks Roy...just needed a reality check.  This is just one example...one guy has had 3 sleds for sale for what i would say is at least $1500 over for the whole winter. GREED. You noticed we dont have forestry any more up here? GET REAL PEOPLE. I almost feel like calling him up and arranging to get it delivered(200kms away in Ft. Frances) , says he'll deliver,and give him a bogus address..but i'd never do that"
677029,BillM,2012-03-17 17:02:00,17367,"People think they can sell stuff for 90% of it's retail value...  Some stuff you can get close to retail for, but most you can't.  Some people can't wrap their heads around this concept.  Especially the guys that drop 10k into their cars, then think they'll see that 10k during the sale, lol!!!"
677052,Nipfisher,2012-03-17 18:23:00,2449,  Gen 1s are under $400 brand new at BPS.   I'll give you a great deal Simon. I will sell you my HDS5 for $549
677190,captpierre,2012-03-18 02:46:00,2521,Finding the same with used ATVs.  Why would you pay 70-80% of the new value for a potentially abused ATV 3 yrs out of warranty?  But people do.
