677242,kickingfrog,2012-03-18 14:17:00,8333,The question was about a screw tybo.
677246,Tybo,2012-03-18 14:30:00,1373,"A screw by what ever means used for, was the wrong solution."
677247,kickingfrog,2012-03-18 14:46:00,8333,And that is why someone was looking for a real world solution.
677248,aplumma,2012-03-18 14:46:00,6896,The winning answer seems to be rivets....   Art
677051,irishfield,2012-03-17 18:20:00,26272,"  ..what I was getting at Grimace.. and Skinny.. you don't think wings are flat do you? A proper rivet will, or can be formed, to fit just about anywhere. If you were closer it would be fixed already."
677053,Grimace,2012-03-17 18:24:00,2020,"I know Wayne, you laid the joke out there, I just thought I would finish it off.  :-)"
677054,Sinker,2012-03-17 18:31:00,8692,"If its not leaking, just leave it alone.  Why fix whats not broken?  S."
677055,i2cool2fool,2012-03-17 18:34:00,349," .....even bad ones, i imagine, if they exist. LOL"
677056,skinny,2012-03-17 18:40:00,442, now is the time as the floors are out and I can get to it I would hate to get the boat all back togethere then have a problem
677059,jim,2012-03-17 18:56:00,124,Yous' guys are all rong.  Duck tape on the outside and tuck tape on the inside [for added strength].
677062,Muskieman,2012-03-17 19:19:00,2472,Aluminum Button Head rivet or Stainless Button Head bolt with silicone and a Nylock nut ...  Randy
677067,i2cool2fool,2012-03-17 20:09:00,349,"My old man taught me that a 9/16 wrench, hammer and duck tape should just about fix anything."

677142,i2cool2fool,2012-03-18 00:28:00,349, Nope. East coast trucker. Just a practical handy fella and had lots of phrases to share. Don't dare sharing some of them or I could be on the MOD q. LOL
677143,danc,2012-03-18 00:28:00,4677, Tell that to my pension plan managers.
677149,vinnimon,2012-03-18 01:14:00,2593,"  Tim , bring your boat up to the shop. Its a two minute fix with buck rivots. Water tight, will form to the hole and your good to go."
677152,irishfield,2012-03-18 01:26:00,26272,Let me know if he's doing that Vince.. as I'm mailing him rivets come Monday!
677189,kickingfrog,2012-03-18 02:46:00,8333,  And I can break anything with them.
677234,Tybo,2012-03-18 13:30:00,1373,If you be in the trades.A comment like this would get you fired in the tech trades. For there is only one solution.THE RIGHT ONE! If you only what to be a handy man do what ever. Safety depends on the right solution.
677002,skinny,2012-03-17 15:45:00,442,ok SO I was working on my boat . I'm doing the new floor thing . when I pulled out the old ones I found this sticking up . it's not in a real good spot as it's near the bend in side for the water line. I don't know anyone that can weld it and I have heard mixed things about welding as it work harden the alum. inside boat look down from top   outside boat  
677008,irishfield,2012-03-17 16:03:00,26272,I'm trying to figure out why it was there.. and where the head went? Is it counter sunk and covered with filler?  If you want it gone.. remove it.. drill a clean hole and stick a rivet in it.
677011,Sinker,2012-03-17 16:15:00,8692,Just leave it there. It was probably a leaking rivet that was replaced with a screw and sealer.  S.
677013,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 16:18:00,0,i would cut/grind the screw flush and reseal it on the inside.
677021,Gerritt,2012-03-17 16:32:00,6129,  that is the last thing I would be suggesting.
677022,mercman,2012-03-17 16:37:00,7054,Rivet and sealer best idea so far
677025,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 16:50:00,0," you didn't!   and to be honest, while i wouldn't want a full welded hull, i wouldn't think twice about fixing a small hole with a TIG."
677027,Gerritt,2012-03-17 16:58:00,6129,"  Nor would I suggest it... I am not fool hardy.  more then likely grinding it off will cause it to break the seal seeing as how there is no head on this screw, possibly causing even more damage.... even if he ground it off and didn't cause further damage, there is already little to no bite (thread) left on the screw on the thin hull... and cutting the screw will make matters even worse....boats take a pounding and vibration....  His best option is to drill it out and rivet it.  Or you can be his boat mate with a bailer in hand."
677030,BillM,2012-03-17 17:03:00,17367,Put a rubber cap over it so it doesn't snag on anything and leave it be.
677031,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-17 17:11:00,10439, And seal with 3M 5200 marine sealer.
677032,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-17 17:12:00,10439, Heads covered with filler Irish.
677033,vinnimon,2012-03-17 17:16:00,2593,"A waterproof aluminum rivot will do with a drop of siloprene, and voila its sealed.  "
677035,vinnimon,2012-03-17 17:17:00,2593,
677037,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 17:21:00,0," perhaps it would ""likely"" leak if you did it... hahahahaha..."
677038,Gerritt,2012-03-17 17:24:00,6129,"Looks like a reverse countersink to me...   looking closer I see a Robertson head?....  Thanks for the heads up Dave,  this looks is a carpenters screw...  it certainly does not look like a pan head metal screw upon a closer look... Looks like a standard carpenters #10 or #12 reverse countersink...??  Hence the reason for the filler!  I would remove this screw asap... as you risk galvanic corrosion and as said... Rivet and seal.    Thanks for making me look a bit closer Dave it was not easy to spot.   G"
677039,Gerritt,2012-03-17 17:26:00,6129,  says the academic to the tradesman
677040,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 17:28:00,0,"i don't think you need to be a tradesman to fix a screw but keep pumping your own tires.  besides, my academic days are behind me as i have been in the metal trades for the last year and a half.  passed all my engineer inspections so far.  to my knowledge the equipment i fixed is back in the mines doing their thing...  besides, saying that the trades aren't ""academic"" is a great injustice to tradesmen as many are no more/less education than those in the science field."
677043,irishfield,2012-03-17 17:35:00,26272,The school bell rang lads.. the principal wants to see ya's...  All over a screw    .. who'd a thought.
677044,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 17:42:00,0,"when someone asks a question, no matter the subject, i would expect different people would have different solutions."
677045,Grimace,2012-03-17 17:43:00,2020,Some of the most venomous arguments on this planet have been over a good screw.   :-)
677046,Gerritt,2012-03-17 17:44:00,6129,  Dude... you kill me!
677047,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 17:49:00,0,well played sir! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obKLdou0LH0&feature=related
677048,BillM,2012-03-17 17:53:00,17367,"I'd probably listen to Wayne when it comes to rivets, screws and anything you want to stay together while in flight"
677049,skinny,2012-03-17 18:11:00,442,I know it's hard to see in the photos but this is right on a bend in the hull so I don't think a rivet will work
677050,mercman,2012-03-17 18:17:00,7054,"  Settle the discussion, is it a metal screw or a carpenters screw.  http://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/mech_spec_epxy/overview/Loctite-Metal-Filled-Epoxy-Putty.htm  I used this on my dads old tinny."
