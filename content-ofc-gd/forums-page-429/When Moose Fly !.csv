633379,irishfield,2011-10-23 14:48:00,26272, No... but I'll see what I can do.
633385,mistaredone,2011-10-23 15:33:00,913,Great story!!  Really looking forward too the bow cam vid
633409,irishfield,2011-10-23 18:45:00,26272,"I've asked him... but he's back on his ""week"" on duty at the firehall and they don't come home at all."

633558,Moosebunk,2011-10-24 03:02:00,3970,Will wait to get that pdf at work some night.  Great prize for your buddy... what a way to present it too!
633653,bigbuck,2011-10-24 14:22:00,2449,"That's a big animal!!! Angus is a heck of a guy, he thinks on his feet and was able to take down a big bear, deal with the meat and hide, get his plane off a sandbar, get the moose, get said moose out of the bush via chopper to cold storage and then drive back up north to retrieve it for butchering. That was an adventure of a lifetime that took a lot of saving, planning and preparation."
634983,tjsa,2011-10-27 22:34:00,1578, here is a link to an interview with local Thunder Bay cbc superior morning reporters Lisa Laco and Gord Ellis that was on this morning.  http://www.cbc.ca/superiormorning/episodes/2011/10/27/the-flying-fourteen-hundred-pound-moose/
635011,spincast,2011-10-27 23:29:00,3279,wow. Priceless.The grandkids kids will be telling that story.
677041,irishfield,2012-03-17 17:29:00,26272,An update to the flying Moose story...  Angus has indeed secured the new Ontario record 204 and 5/8ths!  http://www.frow.ca/moose/archery/
677060,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 19:01:00,0,very cool... slates are a sweet spot... have pics of my chums feeding caribou apples by hand... the laker fishing is pretty good too! what an experience for that gent.
677086,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-17 21:42:00,10439, That's an old moose and he has worn them down to the nub.
677101,captpierre,2012-03-17 22:56:00,2521,  Very cool.  Any idea from how close the kill shot was taken?  What would that fly out have cost the guy?
677102,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-17 22:59:00,10439,  Shot was about 30 yds.  Cost was about $3000.
677105,captpierre,2012-03-17 23:10:00,2521,  Incredible.  That's a once in a lifetime  How far did the moose have to come?
677188,mistaredone,2012-03-18 02:45:00,913,Did the bow cam clip ever surface?
677192,irishfield,2012-03-18 02:47:00,26272,I'll give him a bump and see!
677202,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-18 03:03:00,10439,I'm dying to see it!!!!     :thumbsup_anim:
677425,irishfield,2012-03-19 01:19:00,26272,I know it's 30 seconds of video.. captures the whole affair and he's keeping it tight under wraps while he makes a deal with Bow Hunter Magazine for the rights! So far Angus has got a one year contract from APA Archery doing trade shows for them and he's guiding an upcoming archery/turkey hunt for Whitetail Fix from Ohio on Sportsman's Network.
633088,irishfield,2011-10-22 02:53:00,26272,"My flying buddy Angus flew his amphib float equipped airplane (just like mine and built by Angus) up to the North/West shores of Superior and more specifically the Slate Islands. A trip 3 years in the making.. waiting for a Bull tag in the draw, honing his bow skills and saving the funds to make the whole thing possible. I'll tell you that the A Star helicopter that's shown here hauling away, what may be the next record bull taken with a bow, wasn't cheap either  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/AEcbIBK1JSA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Here is the article he wrote for his Recreational Aircraft Chapters newsletter and the only pic of the big lad I have so far.  It's a 4.3mb PDF I saved to our website... so don't try it on dialup !  http://www.irishfield.on.ca/gallery/Angusmoo.pdf"
633090,misfish,2011-10-22 03:00:00,29133,"Can you amagine what would happen in the GTA, if that happened at a local butcher? LMAO   Thats what I call,easy hauling.LOL  Thanks Wayne."
633091,glen,2011-10-22 03:03:00,2641,I though moose had longer legs then that.
633092,irishfield,2011-10-22 03:03:00,26272,"If you read his story... there was no ease in any of his hunting. Almost taken out by a Mother Black Bear that he had to dress and haul out. Stuck on a sand bar on Superior with the plane, etc. Thank God he's one of the fittest Paramedics I've ever met."
633093,irishfield,2011-10-22 03:05:00,26272, It would suggest that someone previously found out that those long lanky legs make for bad flying and they trimmed them before flight !
633095,NAW,2011-10-22 03:14:00,4022,That's a great video.  Massive Moose!
633096,mercman,2011-10-22 03:18:00,7054,Lord Thunderin BeJeepers Thats the biggest Mouse i ever saw
633097,glen,2011-10-22 03:29:00,2641,Thats a lot of bull.  Great read.  He should sell the movie rights. Thanks Wayne.
633100,woodenboater,2011-10-22 03:34:00,2277,"Terrific read, thanks Wayne ! I have to admit I was nearly doubled over in stitches watching 'stumpy' get lowered from the helicopter  ( I'm thinking ""someone get this moose some lifts"" )  Going to be hard for Angus to top this adventure, that's for sure and I agree, that rack is just plain humongous !"
633101,irishfield,2011-10-22 03:39:00,26272,I kept watching the vid over and over again and it finally hit me.... Robert Downey Jr slung under the helicopter in Air America... over the Monks temple!
633102,OutdoorDan,2011-10-22 03:40:00,325,Those are some expert helicopter skills for that smooth landing.  Great video.
633115,Rod Caster,2011-10-22 04:02:00,5784,I just drove by that place a couple days ago... too bad I missed the action. That's one massive bull
633136,Roy,2011-10-22 09:09:00,13728,Thanks Wayne. What a great read and video! Now there's a fella who thinks on his feet. Unstoppable dudes they are.
633146,TennesseeGuy,2011-10-22 11:58:00,957,A moose flying over my town would collect lead.  Lots of lead.
633159,danbouck,2011-10-22 13:37:00,4380,"Great morning read, thanks Wayne!"
633166,farsider,2011-10-22 14:05:00,456,"Incredible piloting!  That approach and landing were so smooth.  Well Done Sir!  Cheers,  Mark  Oh yah, nice moose!"
633170,GBW,2011-10-22 14:51:00,8460,"but how do you ""win your bait"" there?"
633173,irishfield,2011-10-22 15:11:00,26272,Got some still shots from Angus this morning.  
633174,irishfield,2011-10-22 15:13:00,26272,Massive..now to see if it breaks the Ontario Record of 204 1/8th from last year that had beat (or was pending) a 23 year old record. 
633176,nroadrunner,2011-10-22 15:28:00,113,Amazing bull.  Great flying too.  Is shooting a moose with no legs kinda like fishing in a barrel  JK  LOL    Ian
633199,Joey,2011-10-22 17:44:00,9122,"Wow, great video, pics and story Wayne.  That is one big beast!"
633244,Jds63,2011-10-22 20:32:00,1365,"What an awesome story !! Hunting trip of a lifetime. Even getting the 3000 dollar helicopter lift it was still a lot of work , he should get that story published for sure."
633259,SirCranksalot,2011-10-22 22:04:00,3291,"Wow. !  Quite the story.  But I was struck by the 'headline'. I thought it was another Leafs joke. Y'know When moose fly, when leafs win cup, when pigs fly!!"
633298,Dutch,2011-10-23 01:05:00,831,"Thanks for sharing.  For those guys that haven't read the pdf - take the 10-15 minutes to have a read.  It is written really well, kind of like a wilderness short-story."
633350,simonl,2011-10-23 11:39:00,28,Fantastic Story!!!  I would really like to see the video that he spoke of that was recorded from his bow stabilizer...Is that posted anywhere?
