677006,bushart,2012-03-17 15:58:00,2628,  Not surprising---follow the money  Environment in the way??---well we can fix that
677009,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 16:04:00,0,"The same change in regs will be used to force a new deep water harbour at essar steel here in sault ste. marie.  the deep water harbour is UPSTREAM of the st. mary's rapids and dredged sediments are going to unleash a wall of contaminants (such as hydrocarbons) on the river...  this isn't just about the west coast, it's about industry located on water everywhere in the country.  mining and petroleum are already insanely profitable even in tough economic times and don't require further restructuring to the EA process.  these companies can afford whatever ""obstacles"" proper environmental assessment requires."
677010,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 16:09:00,0,Even former conservative fisheries ministers are opposed to the proposed reg changes...  http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Former+minister+decries+tinkering+with+Fisheries/6316346/story.html
677090,SirCranksalot,2012-03-17 22:14:00,3291," Well, not quite. The former minister was Progressive Conservative, unlike the current rapacious bunch."
677148,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-18 01:13:00,0,excellent distinction KG.
677546,troutologist,2012-03-19 16:31:00,951,"  If they get permission to dredge the approach and dock at Essar (as proposed when I was working on the river) I will be shocked. It is a Federally designated contaminated site, plus 2 engineering reports highlight the futility of silt curtains for containment in that area. What a circus that will lead to. I sure hope someone will be taking some intensive water samples during construction....wait budgets forced MOE to sell their boat....  Its nice to have a deep water port installed when river levels currently prevent ships from carrying full capacity.   Want a scary example of a proposed project that will benefit greatly from this change in the Fishery Regs? Read up on the Mary River Mine Project on North Baffin Island....seems like leaving a barge full of diesel fuel to overwinter in an area of highly mobile pack ice is a good idea?? Good thing they have great ways to contain oilspills under the ice....oh wait.  Jobs obviously are needed, but gutting the mandate of a Govt Dept and then gutting said Dept to increase jobs in another sector is not the way to go about it."
677569,MuskieWannabe,2012-03-19 17:59:00,79,"I just do not understand when the Gov't says that all of this will create jobs...last I checked the oil companies and whatnot were pocketing MILLIONS....I haven't heard of them making huge investments in people and hiring more and more people, just them bringing in more profit for the elite few who get their million + dollar bonuses.  By cutting all of this the only thing that will happen, IMO, will be the owners getting more money but not a proportional increase in workers.  I think we need a long term plan, which is not around.  When will someone get a leader who can see past 4 years and plan accordingly.  Annd I don't mean Harper's ""we'll do that in 2020"" plan because even he knows he won't be here at that point.  I'm hopefull they lose the next election, problem is I don't know who I want to replace them."
677639,Jer,2012-03-19 20:45:00,1426,  You should check the job listings for Fort Mac...lot's of work and money if you don't mind getting your hands dirty. It's not the executives that are pumping oil and building pipelines.

Now they are nearly all stocked in my region and the limits are extremely low. They didn't care about the lakes as long as they got a couple hundred meals out of it."

676374,chessy,2012-03-15 13:37:00,610,"its really to vague to comment . the cost of doing any thing around or in water is crazy the only ones making money is the consulting firms. the projects are usually done the feds should not be in that bussiness. in port hope we have the grca they dictate what goes on in ""water"" areas ."
676377,Rod Caster,2012-03-15 13:52:00,5784,"  You'll never see a group like the GRCA in the Ring of Fire or any unorganized township. Consultants provide independent and properly conducted assessments... if they are done for the Feds or on public property, then they are publicly available (FOI). In some instances, this ""ammendment"" to the act will allow the industry to perform their own Env. Assessments. ""YUP, DIG HERE, THIS BROOKE TROUT HAS NO CLEAR CULTURAL VALUE"". Yes, Consultants are too expensive and sometimes provide obvious information for $100's per hour...but there's gotta be a middle ground, and it would be nice if something like this wasn't slipped in with the budget."

676388,troutologist,2012-03-15 14:52:00,951,The scary part is the potential re-writing of the Fisheries Act (Sec 35) to remove the need to protect a fish's (or marine mammal's) habitat. In the current regs habitat having a very over arching definition involving all the areas and attributes required for all life stages/processes of these animals. The importance of this is huge. You can't have a program to protect coaster brook trout and provide no protection to critical habitat areas.  This is worth writing your MP about. Information and review of environmental impact statements for proposed developments should be done by someone other that the proponents.  I really can't understate the potential impact of this.
676392,Rod Caster,2012-03-15 15:10:00,5784,"They also voted no to Bill C-267, the ""Canada water preservation act"".

676394,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-15 15:15:00,0,"this prime minister has been installed by the petroleum industry to gut environment canada, and any scientific agency that does not agree with it's agenda.  ironic how many anglers on this board voted for the party that regularly demonstrates it cares the least about the environment.  don't crap where you eat."

676396,bigugli,2012-03-15 15:24:00,6138,"It's OK to pollute our waterways, lands, fields. A lot of what you eat today comes from countries with no envitonmental and health regulations anyway. Why should our country be any different?"
676407,bushart,2012-03-15 15:54:00,2628,  You mean packaging it up---putting a bow on it and voting on it with the budget---is peculiar??  So now---if you vote against the budget---your standing in the way of jobs and growth for hard working Canadians.  Can you hear it Now?
676409,Rod Caster,2012-03-15 16:10:00,5784,  pretty much exactly how I worded it to my gf last night.
676495,Rob,2012-03-15 20:52:00,467,He is only doing this because it is taking way to much time to get environmental assessments completed.

676547,blarg,2012-03-15 23:31:00,289,"We clearly need to tear up most of southern Ontario, a lot of good land and water being destroyed by people, imagine, how dare they.  Epic fear mongering, there are a lot of federal and provincial overlap in the regulations, now i hope this doesn't lead to a free for all, and it is nice to live in a province that is concerned with the environment, but have you seen the Ontario economic outlook lately?  People need to work, just as people need places to live, resulting in the giant suburb that exists south of Barrie, you want to talk about pollution, look in those backyards and the millions of others in southern Ontario, But people need homes, they also need places to work outside of Toronto.  Considering the natural resource wealth of Ontario it is a wonder that the economy is having trouble, maybe there are too many regulations, but i am no expert, but then i doubt most of you are either, despite your assertions that Harper was installed by the oil companies, hey i bet he stole the election too right?  of course you cant prove it, but you don't need to, you just KNOW it right?  We should wait to find out what this really means before we go crazy about it."
676588,bushart,2012-03-16 00:57:00,2628,Ontario's issues are hindered by a high Canadian dollar---driven up by natural resorces (oil) and a weak American economy  Ontario's manufacturing lives and dies by the value of our $$$--ask the now unemployed Cat workers in London their thoughts??  But all this aside---has ZIPPO to do with the Cons sliding these changes to the fisheries act in under the sly  no surprise though---when your covered in oil---you tend to be slippery

Read the whole blog in it's entirety and you will see why we a doomed.It goes way beyond environmental assessment."
676620,bushart,2012-03-16 02:15:00,2628,Well if your into not being informed---do not watch The National tonight at the beginning regarding the voter fraud latest.  Too many folks who were called from certain #'s countrywide---asking for Cons votes---when told they were not supportive---then led to polling station changes calls from those same #'s---when there were no changes.  Must be me---maybe too many paint fumes---Yeah that's the ticket-
676636,Sharkbait22,2012-03-16 02:48:00,297," Sounds about right from what I'm hearing and reading.  Fish need places to live (habitat). This is like burning your house and saying everything is alright.  The fisheries act is the main legislation for fish, their habitat and what they eat.  Various agencies administer it e.g., conservation authorities, MNR. There isn't that much overlap. For this and many others reasons Harper needs to go. Sad day for Canada."
676673,Squid,2012-03-16 11:09:00,1656,"Bushart this is the best one yet describing our current PM!!!  ""when your covered in oil---you tend to be slippery"" Awesome!!!"
676676,turtle,2012-03-16 11:22:00,274,"I voted CPC in the last 2 elections mostly due to Liberal Adscam in Quebec, CPC's good track record on the econcomy relative to other countries and in my opinion NDP lunancy and inability to govern.  This type of obvious pro-oil legislation, parts of the omnibus crime bill like mandatory minimum sentances for small cannabis charges and in my opinion policies to be more like the USA (it's really working out well for them) has me shaking my head.  Once you destroy the environment there's no coming back."

676823,torco,2012-03-16 18:31:00,656,"I am not surprised, its pretty clear that the Governments strategy around the economy is nothing more complex than Sarah Palins ""Drill Baby Drill"" philosophy. Its an outdated model that does not make sense, to create short term economic growth at the expense of everything else is just lunacy. You would have thought by 2012 we would be thinking more integrative, holistic and long term and not so short term and linear.  One needs to remember what the purpose of the economy is to improve ones life but I am not sure how that can be achieved without appropriate regulations and rules. I am not anti-mining or oil but we need to do this right or else whats the point?  John Kenneth Galbraith stated it is not the quantity of our goods that matter but the quality of our life. I think many of us forget this regardless of your political stripe."
676993,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-17 15:06:00,0,very disappointed that democratic conversations on politics were locked.  the conservatives would be very proud of OFC for their first rate censorship.
