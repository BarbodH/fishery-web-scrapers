We arrived at a spot that may produce but we werent sure what we were up against. The temps rising and casting into shallow water I did have doubts.  Casting away I finally had a hit in which produced a 11lbs 10 ounce male brown(a stocker).  Shortly after a guy fishing along side of us landed a 3 pounder  We kept casting and chris had a nibble that went away as fast as it hit, i felt so bad about it. But hey hes a team 7 captain There were a few other nibbles that didnt produce, but who cares ,It was a beautiful day out."
