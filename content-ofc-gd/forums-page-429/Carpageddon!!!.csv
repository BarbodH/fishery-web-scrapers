677690,Snidley,2012-03-19 22:53:00,620,TV Ontario has a new series on water starting tonight and one episode concerns the Asian Carp problem. Maybe they have some new solutions that we have not heard yet (like how to cook them lol) It's on at 7:30 tonight. The first episode is on at 7:00. Maybe solutions to the Asian Carp might be a bit optimistic in a half hour show.

Several University Outreach Extension Offices as well as State F&W agencies in the US have invested quite a bit of State and Federal grant money trying to develop both palatable recipes and commercial markets for them.  http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/asian-carp-cooking-chicago-chefs/Content?oid=1571974[  http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/news/Pages/IDNRAddsAsianCarptoHungerProgramMenu.aspx   FROM  Draft Management and Control Plan for Asian Carps in the United States Submitted to the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force Prepared by the Asian Carp Working Group April 2006  Recommendation 3.3.3.2. Inform recreational fishers about Asian carp harvest and preparation methods.  Provide information to recreational fishers on how to catch Asian carps and the culinary attributes of these fish. This could be enhanced by encouraging tournament-type events to increase recreational harvest. Establishing partnerships with chapters of the American Culinary Federation would encourage development of Asian carp recipes. A potential negative effect of this strategy is the possibility that some may eventually view these fishes as a beneficial species. Educational information for the public should include information on the positive environmental benefits of removing and consuming these species.  Stakeholders representing a cross section of interests should work with partners to develop appropriate outreach products for recreational fishers to encourage Asian carp harvest, cleaning, preparation and consumption. Angling and bowfishing for Asian carps should be promoted, including angling techniques, equipment, baits, and tournaments throughout the geographic distribution of feral Asian carps.  The Missouri Department of Conservation and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources have published articles describing techniques for catching and preparing Asian carps in their outreach publications (Perea 2002; Chapman 2004). The Native Fish Conservancy, together with bowfishing organizations and Bass Pro Shops, is organizing an Asian carp cook-off in central Missouri (personal communication, Robert Rice, Native Fish Conservancy)."

All native species remains and survival is remarkable better than i would have expected (He actually loves fishing so he has evolving techniques). In his stretch of the river the cod has made a return as well as yellow belly - there are mechanisms. Just saying there not good but if they get in the trent in Canada it may take something like this to slow there progress."

Both were good for young kids if a little light on new information or any hint of a solution. The Caribbean has it's own alien invader and LOTS of problems from over development. You can see it coming from miles away, all that Caribbean Riviera ultimately looking about as attractive as Wasaga Beach with filthy, stinking water devoid of aquatic life. By then 20th Century robber barons will have moved on to the middle of the Pacific assuming it isn't a big plastic filled toilet bowl. The Carpagedddon film did offer up a solitary firm trying to make a living from Big Head and Silver Carp (since Buffalo Fish and Catfish are now virtually gone)but he pointed out they make literally pennies for carp."
