Changed batteries and still not preforming like it use to. I was just wondering if anyone knows what the life of these motors are, or if there is something I can do to improve the preformance. Thanks,  Dan"
677007,ah_long,2012-03-17 15:59:00,354,Did you remove the prop and see if its jammed with weeds?
677036,davey buoy,2012-03-17 17:19:00,5505,"I have the same,about 5 years old,runs like the day I bought it.Maybe weeds as said or spinning because something broken.Under load is when the trouble would show up likely."
677042,Roy,2012-03-17 17:29:00,13728,"I agree, take the prop off and remove the fishing line."
677412,BassAsin,2012-03-19 00:46:00,806,Try changing the prop if there is no line stuck on your drive Shaft the props will wear on the slot where the sheer pin is and you will lose speed. Happened on my endurance as well as Minn kota after only a couple years.
677415,knightfisher,2012-03-19 00:53:00,237,Thanks for the replies. Took the prop off no line or weeds. I do check for that a few times a year. May try a new prop.  Dan
677434,fish_fishburn,2012-03-19 02:10:00,1311,Charge your batteries and then do a specific gravity test. Maybe your batteries are getting a bit tired. If they are put some re-store in your batteries and recharge. The Re-store will bring them back like new.
677446,Dabluz,2012-03-19 04:10:00,701,"I had a Minn Kota 15 (9 lbs of thrust) for close to 30 years.  When I sold it 2 years ago, it was as strong as the day I bought it.  I could get about 10 km/h in high when I used it on my canoe.  However, 3 years ago I got a 36 lb thrust bowmount made in 1999.  It worked a couple of minutes and slowly came to a stop.  I just took it apart today and the inner bearing is damaged.  The shaft has not been damaged though.  Anyway, taking the motor apart only takes about 2 minutes.  You may just need new brushes and bearing (bearings?)  There is a site on the internet where you can ask a pro questions about these kinds of things but it costs too much for the info."
677447,barrystrs,2012-03-19 04:20:00,75,"When I replaced my prop with a weedless one from crappy tire, it is faster than it ever was, and it is truely weedless in forward."
677459,Garnet,2012-03-19 10:40:00,2056,"Clean contacts is huge. Pop the top off and shine those contacts, make sure your battery post are clean and shiny. Put a little dab of white grease.  So battery,contacts,motor."
677831,RSF,2012-03-20 05:42:00,47,"You might check and clean all power contact points of the lines, clamps/connector as well as threaded connectors from batt-up, including any crimped ends. I Just purchased a new MInn Kota Endura C-2-50 for the unheard of price 189.00. Includes Manufacture rebate $50.00 and a free 5 amp logic controlled 5amp MK Charger. Lebarons. I believe the sales ends, the end of the month (March)."
