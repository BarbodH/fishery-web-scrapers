281828,knightfisher,2008-12-20 02:02:00,237,Fishing from a canoe really has it's advantages. You can get into almost any water. Go where the big boats can't go. The scenery is just fantastic at times. Experience wild life like you would not believe. One of the most spectacular times was when Tom and I were in a small back bay and all of a sudden tens of thousands of minnows just started jumping out of the water all around us as far a we could see.   Some pics from a few outings this year.

281837,Beats,2008-12-20 02:11:00,543,nice pics there.  I have had many successful fishing trips in canoes and love them for their ease of use and stealth appeal.  It's true that they can be taken many spots other boats either can't go or don't want to risk.  The pic of the culvert is cool.
281840,nancur373,2008-12-20 02:15:00,1211,I second that coulvert pic.  Curt
281853,BUSTER,2008-12-20 03:00:00,1336,WELL DONE
281855,Leecher,2008-12-20 03:10:00,7832,Great report and pics knightfisher  Good mix bag of fish you caught.... Liked the muski pic.... WTG Thanks for sharing Leechman
281866,waterwolf,2008-12-20 03:36:00,556,"just bought a 14 foot sports pal ,, couldn't believe my good fortune . seeing those great photos is the reason why i bought this canoe. there is so much to be said for the low impact approach a canoe brings to a sensitive environment. thanks for sharin'"
282294,knightfisher,2008-12-21 14:34:00,237,"Glad you guys like the pics.   Well done on the Sports Pal Waterwolf.  I have owned many canoes and by far,  the Sports pal is the best. Not the fastest,  but the most stable and able to take a motor  if desired. Also unsinkable."
282328,jediangler,2008-12-21 15:52:00,1923,I have been fishing from Sportspals for almost 20 years. Just recently I have converted to kayak fishing. One of my fishing buddies has two of them. I prefer the squareback or transom models because they allow more customization and seat upgrades as well as give you more room. Here are a few picks of my Sportspal adventures from 2008.          Go Team Sportspal 
282336,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-21 16:20:00,3761,"I don't own this Sports Pal but  my friends dad does, i went in it several times this past summer at bass lake. He even had a little 3hp motor on the back of it, worked like a charm.      Even caught my first fish off shore out in this canoe. Very lightweight(without our gear) and safe."
282601,jediangler,2008-12-22 00:31:00,1923,"Had to do a little digging to find it, but here it is. The biggest fish that has been caught in my Sportspal. My brother, Joonmoon, with his 41"" musky caught on opening day at Sturgeon lake a few years ago.  We should do a Sportspal GTG next year, maybe at a conservation area where the gas burners won't spoil the peace and quiet."
282737,waterwolf,2008-12-22 06:56:00,556,"some great testimonies to a great canoe via the camera. my first intro to the sportspal was with a buddy on sparrow .he's 6 foot and stood up and casted with some umph with a baitcaster,, i did the same . two adults standing ,, casting from a canoe . knew then i would own one very soon. nothing short of incredible.  it's so wide it comes with oars not paddles ,and like some of the previous photos suggests has a modification to house a sail. this craft is unsinkable and only  weighs about 3olbs .  my first blue pike from that trip."
286919,knightfisher,2009-01-02 14:29:00,237,Some real nice pics there guys.  A sports pal GTG sounds like a good idea.
286926,Spiel,2009-01-02 14:44:00,9065,"....I used to have a 16'er (square back), complete with running lights, bow electric, 5 horse gas and clamp-on mini riggers.  Spent countless hours fishing from her. Only regret is that I sold it years ago, big mistake!"
287013,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-02 18:11:00,3761,Would anybody give me a guess as to how much a used square back SP would cost about...just wondering thats all
287262,jediangler,2009-01-03 15:23:00,1923,"They are over $1000 new, so I would expect around $500. Just guessing. You can get the little 11.5' pointed at both ends canoe used for around $300 if you keep an eye on your local classifieds, kijijji, or pennysaver. Chances are when most people decide to sell, friends or family usually snatch them up first."

311224,irishfield,2009-02-26 23:22:00,26272,I'll be fishin from mine this year as well... many times hopefully in remote spots !  Great pics Knightfisher
311235,bbnotty,2009-02-26 23:45:00,93,"A sportspal g2g sounds good, heres a few pics of my sons 14ft squareback      Love your pictures , its amazing where you can get to with a canoe."
311245,scugpg,2009-02-27 00:10:00,1373,How stable are the Sportpals? I have a novacraft prospector and was wondering how it would compare to that.
311475,jediangler,2009-02-27 16:14:00,1923,"When I bought mine in 1994, a hunter told me he could let go with both barrels of his 12 gauge broadside without so much as a wobble. They are extremely stable but a bathtub would be easier to paddle. I've never even had a close call in 15 years with mine."
311492,Golfisher,2009-02-27 17:03:00,586,Can you stand up and cast without risking tipping over?
311504,jediangler,2009-02-27 17:21:00,1923,"Standing and casting is no problem Golfisher, the bottom of a Sportspal is flat. This is the same reason it stops gliding the second you stop paddling."
311506,johnnyb,2009-02-27 17:24:00,3413,  LOL -- too true...it's where most cartoon animators get their ideas from
