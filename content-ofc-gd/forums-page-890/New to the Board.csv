I also work at Le Baron, so if there's ever a question about product availability, pricing or feedback I've heard, I'd be glad to help.  I just wanted to introduce myself, and I look working to talking with all of you!  -ADB."

311595,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-27 20:08:00,2050, I'm thinkin JDMLS is talkin' about pink trout worms for steelheading...I made sure to nab a whole wack of them in december when they were still in stock @ BPS...    I've got the regular soft plastics and picked up some of the gulp worms to try out...  welcome to the board ADB
311600,ADB,2009-02-27 20:15:00,444,"Oh...the Berkley Trout Worms.  Yeah, the pink/bubblegum always do sell out fast.  I think all we've got at the moment is natural and chartreuse.  With spring steelhead coming up we'll be getting some in stock soon enough, though."
