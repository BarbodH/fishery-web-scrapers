306304,Zebco,2009-02-14 13:51:00,123,Isn't this like cheating?
306372,Mattones,2009-02-14 18:07:00,587,"Nope. Its allowed on facebook, etc  Its just to rack up as many votes as you can by the end of the month. No rules. Even if you have 3 computers at home you can use those."
306376,Ziki,2009-02-14 18:26:00,128,^not true. Unless you have 3 ISP's all those computers are going to be under the same IP address.
306413,Mattones,2009-02-14 21:35:00,587," Its what they said so who knows  But it is not cheating as everyone of them has a facebook group, etc. Its just a matetr of who gets more votes wins."
