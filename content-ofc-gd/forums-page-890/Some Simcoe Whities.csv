311659,Joey,2009-02-27 21:56:00,9122,"Paul is feeling much better and is scheduled to go back to work Monday, so I decided to take one day off work to be with him on his last day off work.  We decided to do what else.... go fishing  We left early for Simcoe and it was a bit damp out, not really raining, and quite warm.  We got out to our spot and set up.  The fog rolled in pretty quick.  Took a shot of some huts in the disance.    Paul doing a jig.    First fish on      My Turn.    A little guy for Paul, thought it was a herring.    It rained pretty good for a bit so I decided to fish in the hut.  Then all heck broke loose and a wind came along out of nowhere and almost blew everything away.  The hut flipped back and Paul's chair and helmet went for a ride down the lake.  After retrieving our stuff and securing the hut, we fished once more.  Paul got this guy but I couldn't get my hut zipper all the way open anymore because everything that was wet a few moments ago was now frozen    My turn for a nice one - 22.5 inches, woohooo.  More inches for Team 5    And another one for Paul    who totally outfished me today.  Not sure what has happened to the universe.  Think it must be off its axis    So I was 2 for 4 and Paul was 8 for 12.  We only kept our limit tho and look forward to having a nice Whitefish dinner.  Packing up gear that was rained on then frozen was not fun tho.  Might head back out tomorrow or Sunday, weather permitting.  Paul's back did pretty good.  Made sure he sat on a chair instead of a bucket and just took it easy.  Cheers,  Joey"
311661,johnnyb,2009-02-27 21:59:00,3413,Very well done -- crazy weather!  Thanks for inspiring the rest of us
311663,ozaibak1,2009-02-27 22:04:00,401,"Great report, pictures, nice fish! Well that's definitely an encouraging sign of fish activity, I'm heading up tomorrow morning for some perch/pike action myself! Which part of the lake were you fishing? Hope to get into whitefish/trout next year."
311664,Terry,2009-02-27 22:10:00,14456,nice report  I figured you would get some but Paul catching some...WOW my universe is upside down  nice going
311666,Leecher,2009-02-27 22:11:00,7832,Great report and pics Joey  Got to love it when the fishies come out to play Congratulations to both of you on catching those beautiful whities  Talk about crappie weather.... certainly didn't matter much as long as the bite was on Again great job you guys and thanks for sharing Leechman
311667,Joey,2009-02-27 22:11:00,9122, We were just out at Innisfil.
311669,Big Cliff,2009-02-27 22:14:00,6899,"Excellent report Joey and really glad to hear that Paul is feeling better. Those sure are some nice fish!  Please be careful out there, conditions are changing really fast, this morning there was a pressure ridge out in front of our place, in the last two hours it has disapeared and there is now a 100' wide stretch of open water North and South as far as I can see. With the cold temps they are calling for tonight this will likely skim over and anyone trying to go across there will be in serious trouble."
311672,Roy,2009-02-27 22:18:00,13728,"Beautiful Joey and Paul, just beautiful! Great pics too. Really glad you had a great time, Paul's back is getting better and you're both back safe and sound. All's well with the world."
311682,Greencoachdog,2009-02-27 22:43:00,8163,Great report and pics Joey!!!  There must've been thousands of them under Paul's hole in the ice for him to bring them up like that eh!!!  Congrats on the Whitey inches for team 5!
311690,douG,2009-02-27 23:02:00,2693,"Good stuff, Joanne, and good news that Paul is on the mend."
311693,misfish,2009-02-27 23:06:00,29133,"Great catch guys. I heard from the oldest boy, they went for almost the same yesturday caught and lost more. Said they were on big time.  Good to see Paul is out and about."
311698,irishfield,2009-02-27 23:15:00,26272,I think Paul gets sick just so you can go fishing... this has dejavu written all over it! lol
311707,fishhunter,2009-02-27 23:40:00,604,Well done!!!
311713,WeedLine,2009-02-27 23:43:00,322,Right on! Those are some good whities.
311729,richyb,2009-02-28 00:30:00,774,"Nice catch ! , i was out in that crap too ! Fished on the ice for 30 mins untill the rain soaked us to the crack and the wind picked up bigtime. Then we headed to the hut for a couple of hours. Cooled off so much by the time i got home my coveralls wer frozen solid and could almost stand on their own. The 4 of us ended up with 5 whities and 3 trout."
311730,crappiesteve,2009-02-28 00:30:00,220,"...Joey nice fish,but Paul catching something,that's odd   at least his back is well enough to go   LOL. Now send him back to work,holidays are over now.   Steve"
