311455,bushart,2009-02-27 15:24:00,2628,I went to my cousin's farm a while ago and took some pictures for my next art piece.  This is situated in the Ottawa Valley and actually AJ Casson (Group of 7) painted a barn up the road some years back.  Anyway this is a special place where I used to spend my summers in my youth working on the farm and in the bush splitting and piling firewood for winter.  The old log barns are really cool---actually the cows were calving when I was there --thus the addition.  I usually put these in the foto section but this one is a little different than what I've been doing.  Bushart
