310724,bassman,2009-02-25 15:40:00,384,That's one damn ugly fish. Almost looks alien like.
310726,Headhunter,2009-02-25 15:44:00,5703,"It looks like the fish in Monty Python's Maeaning of Life, the part where they are in the restaurant, just before the stout fellow walks in and orders everything on the menu! HH"

310964,PatrickGG,2009-02-26 00:51:00,562,"Did some research on it's habitat:  ((MBARI researchers Bruce Robison and Kim Reisenbichler used video taken by unmanned, undersea robots called remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to study barreleye fish in the deep waters just offshore of Central California. At depths of 600 to 800 meters (2,000 to 2,600 feet) below the surface, the ROV cameras typically showed these fish hanging motionless in the water, their eyes glowing a vivid green in the ROVâ€™s bright lights. The ROV video also revealed a previously undescribed feature of these fishâ€“its eyes are surrounded by a transparent, fluid-filled shield that covers the top of the fishâ€™s head.))  Amazing what lives in that Depths with so much pressure that would crush a human being."
