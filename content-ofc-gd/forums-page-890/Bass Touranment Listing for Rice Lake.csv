311542,Hooked,2009-02-27 18:48:00,891,I was wondering if anyone knows of a web link that contains the dates that big Bass Touraments are held on Rice Lake?  I am heading up there for a week in July and was hoping to avoid a weekend that one of them are going on there.

311643,charlesn,2009-02-27 21:12:00,551,"CSFL has some July 4/5.  CBAF has their Qualifier for Team Canada going to Lake Champlain on July 11/12.  CSFL will probably have close to 100 boats.  CBAF between 40-80.  Other than that, I'd guess there will be club events there, but no other major events that I'm aware of."
