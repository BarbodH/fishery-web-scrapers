He has several patents and provided wonderfully for my mother and 2 brothers.  Any gift ideas for such a remarkable accomplishment? My wife and I (kids) are taking him out to eat tonight to celebrate. However, His company is putting on a large scale party in which I feel my wife and I should do something."
311629,irishfield,2009-02-27 20:54:00,26272,"Maybe a Canon camera?? lol There'd be no bigger gift than a big hug and a thanks for all you've done for ""me"" statement I'd bet. Does he fish?? Maybe a new rod reel..."
311631,diggyj,2009-02-27 20:55:00,548,"Big screen TV, boat, car, golf clubs. Or something that he loves to do."
311633,web-fisherman,2009-02-27 20:56:00,54,hahahahahahahahahaah - Good one.   He does fish and is stacked in that dept. It would have been my first thought  Thanks
311639,Roy,2009-02-27 21:00:00,13728,Why don't you sign over the title to that boat you've been trying to sell?
311640,GBW,2009-02-27 21:00:00,8460,"Take him out for the strippers, or is that spelt sripers? either way it's a charter day for you both..."
311653,Big Cliff,2009-02-27 21:36:00,6899,"Well, I don't know about your dad but the very best gift my kids can ever give me is spending time with them, it is the one thing I can never have too much of and I cherish every minute. I think most fathers would feel the same! How about bringing him up to Lakair for the G2G this summer? Now that would be something special that he would never forget!"
311660,johnnyb,2009-02-27 21:56:00,3413,"Sounds like he needs a trip...a fishing trip!  Go all out on a week at a fly-in ... or if that's not his speed, then something down south"

311684,Radnine,2009-02-27 22:50:00,1538,"My buddy Kirk, took his dad out to Vancouver to one of those ""fishing trips of a lifetime"" (think upscale, flash freeze your catch and fed ex. it home) kind of place. About $5000. in all, but memories that will last forever. Tell your dad congratulations from me, I love to see them get out alive. This story might be the best news to come out of Eastman Kodak that I have heard in some time. Jim PS. You're a good son."
311694,bigugli,2009-02-27 23:06:00,6138,Take him to a lodge or fly-in for some together time.
311697,bbog,2009-02-27 23:12:00,665,Nothing beats time together - doing what he'd really enjoy.  Good to hear a success story from a US ICON that has been faced with reinventing itself over the last decade or so.
311714,Leecher,2009-02-27 23:45:00,7832,"First and foremost, congratulations to your father for his well earned retirement  Taking him out for supper is a good start and I'm sure he will enjoy it. You mention that the company he worked for will be honoring him at a large scale party.... write up a nice speech  for him with details of his evolution throughout the years that he worked there and be the one to be the speaker at his reception.  Not an easy task to do but I'm sure that he would be very proud of you.  Next I would tell him that he is invited to join you and your family to a place of your choice, it be fishing, camping, touring etc....  After 42 years of working for the same company, your dad deserve the very best and I know you will make it happen for him.  Leechman"

Anyhting else, is material.  Trust me,I know what Im talking about here.  Thanks Wayne for saying that."
311794,web-fisherman,2009-02-28 03:18:00,54, Hahahaa - That would do it. He does love that boat
311795,web-fisherman,2009-02-28 03:19:00,54,  Excellent!!! And he is the type of father that would rather have that.  Thanks
311796,web-fisherman,2009-02-28 03:20:00,54,  Leechamn your awesome! Well said. Advise will be taken.  Thanks  Mike
311797,web-fisherman,2009-02-28 03:24:00,54, That is a great thought! Thanks. Maybe grab my brothers and go up for a 4-day - 3 night on Lac Seul. I could get the Musky/Walleye master Ben Beattie to guide our trip.
311805,Mattones,2009-02-28 03:54:00,587,42 years at the same job. Wow. Thats effort must of loved his job very much!  I say buy him one of these.   I agree go to a Lodge as bigugli said. That is a great idea.
311863,Billy Bob,2009-02-28 13:52:00,5865,"I worked on the Railroad for 30 years and had to take a early retirement because both my shoulders were bad. Left one needs to be replaced. Thank God it's the left as I can still fish and hunt.  Most railroad guys have 40+ years before retiring so I seen quite a few retire in their 60's but only one really sticks out in my mind because what the family did on his last day at work.  The family hired a stretch limo that was waiting in surprise for the ride home for this worthy dad on his way home. Blew me  and others away to see that limo pull up and take this retire home from work for his last time.  Of course on their last work day at least on the RR you just come in sign the time sheet, eat some cake and thank everyone who you worked with. So if you can use this idea try checking with his supervisors to see what time will be heading home so the limo's timing is correct.  Bob"
