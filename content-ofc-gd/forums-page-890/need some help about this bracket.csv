311651,Fishn Technishn,2009-02-27 21:33:00,198,"Been there ...done that! Went thru this ""mounting scenario"" last year. I asked many questions from many experts on MANY ""boards"" and best advice was to mount the motor directly to the transom ....if possible. I don't have all the stuff from last year but if you have to use a bracket there is a quick connect bracket so you can remove the whole thing quickly. Will see if I can remember the name.  FT"
311665,wallyboss,2009-02-27 22:10:00,1095,If you are going to put a 2 stroke Merc be careful here is something I did to mine. Cause if you tilt up a Merc 2 stroke you will hit and possibly break your gas connection with the small lever at the front of the bracket. And it can very quickly ruin a day of fishing. But after the change I did to mine it works great.  But I agree if you can mount it straight to the transom it's a lot better but some boats it's just not doable  like mine.
