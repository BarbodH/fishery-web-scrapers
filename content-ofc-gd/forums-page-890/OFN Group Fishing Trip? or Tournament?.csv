311376,Big Cliff,2009-02-27 10:34:00,6899,"Well, there is Lakair in the summer usually about the 3 rd week in June I believe, that is quite a get together. Then in the winter there is the Fishing for Tyler event and there is usually 100+ people get together for that; usually about mid Feb.. There is usually a bunch that get together in the fall and hit the BOQ. Apart from that. We do have an ongoing annual tournament with teams all set up and lastly many of us get together and fish at different times throughout the year. Stick around for a while, you'll be amazed at how much does go on around here."
