If you like cat fish there some good footage. Enjoy.  <object width=""340"" height=""285""><param name=""movie"" value="""
311686,Leecher,2009-02-27 22:53:00,7832,"Great report and video iceguy  Looks like you guys did not want to handle that big cat once it was iced     Best way the handle those is to grab them by the belly near the head and stay away from the side picks.... them picks if you get stung, will give you a burning sensation pain that will last for quite a while.  Too bad you lost that eye near the hole.... sure look like it was a biggun. The music in the back ground was perfect Thanks for sharing Leechman"

311727,fishhunter,2009-02-28 00:27:00,604,well done. Ill take cats like that over eyes any day of the week and twice on sundays. Way better fight.

311988,Joeytier,2009-02-28 22:33:00,3990,I never caught a single cat fish when I was there in January.  I'd love to hook into one of those!
312072,wallyboss,2009-03-01 02:12:00,1095,It usually happens right at the hole because at that point the water isn't holding the fish anymore. When there is somebody there with you he should be on his hands and knees right beside the hole and be ready to get his arm wet. As soon as the fish is on it's way up the hole you just keep a tension on it and he should grab him by the gill plate.
