311394,Mr Twister,2009-02-27 12:22:00,71,Was hoping to check out this body of water this weekend and woundered what speices of fish are targeted in that lake?  Thanks
311404,MuskieWannabe,2009-02-27 12:54:00,79,"Smallies, largies, pickerel, pike, muskies......Not too sure what else but I know I'm missing a few.  Pretty good fishery and a great place to go if you have a smaller boat because even on a windy day you won't get blown around too much....Usually a first destination for me for the muskie season as it's the first spot that opens up in the summer."
311414,Seaweed,2009-02-27 13:27:00,135,Mr. Twister  Are you fishing the derby?  Did you know about it.  Check out our other local discussion board for info.  I might be heading up.  I have never fished the Head Pond through the ice but... I know some spots where they fish eyes a lot in the spring fall so the fish can't be too far.  I would caution about the ice conditions though... I hear a guy went through with a truck a few weeks back.  I think they both lost their lives.... don't stray too far from shore my friend.  I will be running around with my sled and portable if I get up there.  The big eyes are biting around Wendover so I might hit that area.  Good luck
