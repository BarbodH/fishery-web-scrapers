Loretto girls school wasn't called ""The Loretto Bordello"" for nothing   Bernie, you forgot to print the applicant's instructions that go with it. They are better than the app itself."
311847,Bernie,2009-02-28 12:15:00,3190,"A young fella stopped to take one of my girls to a movie. I went out to have a chat with him. I see 4 bald tires. Sorry bud but you are not taking her in that car. Next night he swings by, 4 new tires."
311849,muddler,2009-02-28 12:26:00,623,"This is a true story. Verified by my buddy's daughter.  I have a friend that has his black belt in Kung Fu. He a a big burly guy. He's as nice as can be, calm pleasant and easy going. His gorgeous 16 year old daughter was going on her first date. The door bell rang and his daughter answerrd the door. The date (a young man of about 18 years old) plants a friendly quick smooch on his daughter. The dad rushes to the door and grabs the young man and kisses him right on the lips (very passonionately I'm told) and then let the kid go and walks a way. He turns around and says to the kid, ""Have a great time, but remember, what ever you do to my daughter, im going to do the same thing to you."" ""What time do you want her home, sir?"", the date asked. ""12 o'clock would be fine,"", answered the father. ""She'll be home by 11."" the shaken date said. And she was home by 11.  muddler"
