311574,JohnF,2009-02-27 19:22:00,3494," I'm with you. It's just never occurred to me to look closely at chicken poop.  For those who do, what's the attraction?  JF"
311575,Roy,2009-02-27 19:27:00,13728,I hope I'm not too late! DAWG! You can't eat that!!! That's crap too!
311576,Fisherpete,2009-02-27 19:29:00,1814,That's wasabi. They serve it with Sushi.
311577,JohnF,2009-02-27 19:31:00,3494, I knew wasabi came from someplace disgusting.  JF
311578,capt bruce,2009-02-27 19:33:00,820,"""That's wasabi. They serve it with Sushi""  just fell out of my chair lmao"
311586,Greencoachdog,2009-02-27 19:45:00,8163,The voice of experience!!!
311593,blaque,2009-02-27 20:06:00,2419,"screw the green spot, why'z the rest of it white???????????"
311604,hammercarp,2009-02-27 20:20:00,964,I know I know! And this is the truth. It is white due to a birds very high body temperature. It affects the chemistry of digestion. I always did well at Trivial Pursuit.
311610,blaque,2009-02-27 20:25:00,2419," So is that the same explanation for white dog doo?, HEY.......Dont look at me! GCD started this whole mess."
311615,capt bruce,2009-02-27 20:32:00,820,"So I guess the green is the part in the middle and it does not get as warm as the outside stuff so it dont turn white, makes sence ., but who decided to use it to mix  with rice and raw fish ?????"
311618,Silo Buster,2009-02-27 20:41:00,81,"Could be Newcastle Disease.If it is,it's a reportable disease.  Why you asking?"
