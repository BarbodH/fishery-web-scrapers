I had a bunch of minnows left that I got from the bait shop on 7A in Port Perry so I took them home and stuck them in the freezer.  This bait should be VHS free (I would hope) so is it going to be a concern for me to use it on the lake my cottage is on in the summer?  I don't fish Scugog in the summer, I'm farther North in zone 17.  Thanks in advance. G"

311283,WeedLine,2009-02-27 01:43:00,322,My buddy salts the minnows we don't use on trips. I think the salt kills everything and adds flavor to the bait
311312,BassAsin,2009-02-27 03:08:00,806,If its that much of a concern G try boiling them quickly and then salting them boiling is your best bet to kill any bacteria
311333,GBW,2009-02-27 03:41:00,8460,Thanks folks.  I'll be defrosting them soon and I'll preserve them some way.  I was thinking the mineral oil and garlic way but now I'm not sure...
311343,cram,2009-02-27 04:08:00,1733,The effort and cost to treat them is likely more than the minnows are worth.  You might try them as fertilizer in your garden.
311349,John Bacon,2009-02-27 04:25:00,3277," VHS is caused by a virus, not bacteria.  When boiling water to treat for drinking purposes, it is recommended that you boil the water for five minutes to ensure that all bacteria is killed.  I am not convinced that boiling them quickly will ensure that all bacteria, viruses, and parsites would be killed.  I think the fertilizer idea is the best I have heard so far."
311359,BassAsin,2009-02-27 05:33:00,806,"thats true i know, like you said it is ""recommended"" thats is also for human ingestion were just trying to prevent it from spreading in water its a suggestion is all try boiling them for 5 minutes then G in salty water trying not to turn them into mush of course, but it is just and idea"
