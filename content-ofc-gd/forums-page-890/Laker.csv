308292,troutologist,2009-02-19 18:34:00,951,Last weekend I headed out to camp for a few nights. Saturday we never got on the water til 1 or so do to some technical difficulties encountered the previous evening.  Fished without action until about 4pm. All the sudden there was a frenzy of hits on set lines...a few hook ups and losses.  Seemed like a school of smaller fish nibbling on the minnow tails. This kept up for about an hour.  Packing up I saw my gad pop and at a speed only coors can provoke I was off.  Took almost 10mins to handline this fish in on 6lb test. It took a solid group effort with people holding the line off the ice to keep it untangled and an excellent arm down the hole landing job.     9lb 14oz on the digi   Funny thing is went back to the same spot the next evening and the girlfriend hooked into one the same size or bigger that we never got in. Plus it broke my rod.   Good weekend with some mild weather to be out on the ice.
