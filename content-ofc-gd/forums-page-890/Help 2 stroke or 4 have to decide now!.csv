311320,Tybo,2009-02-27 03:18:00,1373,"When you are running 100 \1 most people wouldn't be using a jug a season. Which comes out to less money then a oil & filter change on a 4.  Also hanging a extra 15 to 20lbs on the back of a 16 tinny,would be the same as 100 to 150lbs off a 19ft Lund proV. At the same hp and rpm the heaver engine would take longer to plane and long to reach a equal and set  speed. Which in turn uses more fuel. This will very slightly to props. On which ever I get,2 or 4 sroke(a 150 to 200). I'll choose a prop that gives me top end and poor hole shot."
311588,Fisherpete,2009-02-27 19:45:00,1814,I absolutely love my 30hp Honda 4 stroke. A friend of mine bought a 2 stroke 25hp Merc at the same time I got mine - and after fishing the past few seasons from both boats he wishes he had spent the extra $ and went with a 4 stroke.
310691,boatman,2009-02-25 14:15:00,350," Excellent comment. You've basically compared both the subject motors in real life. Your results would suggest exactly what Sinker and I have been arguing.  Getting on plane IS hole shot. Go with the 20 hp now and in two months you will be asking the age old queston ""Do hydrofins really work?""."
310706,Bitsmith2k,2009-02-25 14:53:00,396," wow!.. that right there, is the gods honest truth.. i've thought about it more than a few times"
310721,pikehunter,2009-02-25 15:34:00,1659,"4 Stroke. It's only 14 pounds or so heavier plus the weight of the starter, don't forget that is probably not included in the spec weight when you are comparing specs but they are close in weight unless there is a typo. Most comparable hp size motors are much heavier in a 4 stroke version.  I went against the popular vote when I bought new a few years ago and purchased a 2 stroke. Ever since I have secretly envied 4 strokes when they glide past me in near silence. Actually I tried to get out of the motor part of my package deal when I found a good deal on a new but non current 20hp Honda at a different dealer for a little more $$ than my then current 25hp Johnson.  The 4 stroke you are describing also has an electric starter and this is worth about half of the $500 difference in price. Also don't forget that the battery to power your electric starter is also going to add more weight to your boat.  If you buy the 2 stroke you will always wonder if you should have bought the 4. If you buy the 4 you will always wonder if you should have bought the 2. It's a tough choice to make. If you are buying used then that is different, you buy the best cleanest motor for the price.  As for smoke? I don't mind a little bit of it, good oil = less smoke, except for start up. I have also seen some 4 strokes on the water blowing some smoke too."
310734,corvette1,2009-02-25 15:57:00,1765,2 stroke smoke 4 stroke no smoke if you troll 4 stroke all the way
310739,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-25 16:14:00,10439, Just 15 years guiding experiance. We ran 30 horse 2 strokes at the lodge for years and when we switched to 4 strokes our fuel consumption dropped a between 40 and 50 percent. This is not based on a single event or even season but over 15 seasons of running one or the other for two to three months a year. Before we made the switch we were carrying 3 or 4 fuel tanks when we were making our longest runs but after the switch were able to cut back and carry only 2 and still have 1/2 a tank left after our longest day runs. With the 2 strokeswe would burn 1 to 1 1/2 tanks more.
310744,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-25 16:19:00,10439, It's not a friggin' Bass boat it's a little john boat!!! You think he's going to be rocketing down the lake at 70.
310745,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-25 16:30:00,10439,  Yes and he also noticed a big difference in fuel consumption which is what the rest of us were saying.  So to the original question A/ if you're not a speed freak and want to save on fuel and not have to smell 2 stroke oil go with the four stroke. B/ if performance is your goal and you don't mind spending more on fuel and oil go with the two stroke.
310748,boatman,2009-02-25 16:37:00,350," No, he'll go about 40-45 kph with the 25 hp. The 20 hp will have to work harder than the 25 hp to maintain the same speed. Therefore, using more fuel and struggling to plane with heavier loads (ie two big guys and gear). That will make the fuel consumption a wash. However, he'll still miss those extra ponies.  Any new 4 stroke will probably get 40% better fuel economy than my 1988 2 stroke. Then again, a new 2 stroke will get much better fuel economy than my motor too.  If we were comparing two 25 hp or two 20 hp motors then I'd say get a 4 stroke, but we are not. I think too many of you are giving advice from your hearts not your heads."
310749,boatman,2009-02-25 16:42:00,350," He was also comparing an old motor to an new one. My 1954 25 hp uses about 1/3 more fuel than my 1988, which probably uses 1/3 more than a new one. Either way, its a 25 hp. He won't be spending big bucks on fuel anyway.  Its not an issue of being a speed freak. Its about setting up a boat that can do everything you need."
310792,GeorgeJ,2009-02-25 19:11:00,207,"Thank You all very much, this thread did what I hoped it would. There was a lot of good lets call it debate on both 2 vs 4 stroke. A couple of comments brought it home for me though, one being said that a 20hp 4 st would not plane the boat with 3 guys in it, and with the previous old 25hp 2 st it would have. Another was a suggestion I'd be shopping for a hydro fin if I bought the 4 st. I have seen a lot of motors with these on them, I'm not sure if they work and I don't want to find out. I'm sure the 2 st will burn more fuel than the 4 but I'm prepared to spend extra on fuel for some extra performance. At a 100 to 1 mix running on synthetic I don't think smoke from the motor will be a big concern. I plan on running a bow mount to troll with which I will buy with the extra money I saved so that addresses trolling. I will miss the electric start  and the fact the 4 st would be quieter but I'm already half deaf in my right ear so now with my left ear towards the motor maybe things will even out. That is about it so I put a deposit down on the 2 stroke 25 hp and will pick it up in March and never look back! Well hopefully never look back."
310796,2 tone z71,2009-02-25 19:15:00,1311,its a Yamaha either way you wont be looking back congrats
310839,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-25 20:14:00,10439," Sounds great, good luck with it. I'm sure you will be happy with it.  FYI, if you re-read that post, he actually said that it took a little longer to get on plane with two people (big person)  and the smaller 4 stroke but neither engine would get up on plane with three people on board.  the only thing i've noticed is if i get a big 2nd guy in the boat it takes a while to plane out (it wont plane with 3 of us) whereas with the 25, i'd get it up on a plane fairly quickly (still wouldnt plane with 3 of us).."
310860,lookinforwalleye,2009-02-25 20:52:00,4399,Well I am glad that debate is over with!!  Anybody wanna debate E-Tec versus 4 stroke or Yamaha vs. mercury.  Just kidding!
310875,GeorgeJ,2009-02-25 21:16:00,207,"Yes right you are, I must have still been sleepy from my midnight shift. The fact that it would get on plane faster with 2 guys is still valid and that the old 2 stroke was pretty much on it's last legs still indicates a significant power difference. I'm hoping that a new 25hp will plane my boat with 3 or 4 people in it, depends a lot on weight distribution too. I almost started entertaining putting on a 30hp but didn't want to have issues with insurance or warranty on the boat."
310883,lookinforwalleye,2009-02-25 21:28:00,4399,I would think a 25 would be hard pressed to get on plane with 4 people/gear on board.
310897,boatman,2009-02-25 22:04:00,350," Congratulations, you made the right choice. You won't be disappointed.  Four people is probably outside of the max cap anyway. If you find you have any planing issues try trimming your motor differently. My 14' boat with a 30 hp planes two +200lbs guys no problem. With three guys it planes, but it runs better if I trim the motor out one pin to raise the bow."
310904,Bernie,2009-02-25 22:30:00,3190,George. If you will be using the boat continually with a large load you may want to think about getting a smaller pitch propeller. This will allow the engine to stay in its powerband.
310905,pikehunter,2009-02-25 22:31:00,1659,"Congratulations! Glad to hear you made a choice. My 25 Johnson 2 stroke does fine with me in it alone, gets up on a plane real easy and flies over the surface beautifully. Now mind you I'm the size of 2 guys of average or slightly smaller stature. When I am in it with my son or a guest it is slower but does move along nicely.  You will be happy I'm sure. Have good times doing lots of this"
310937,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-25 23:44:00,2038,  Couldn't take it anymore when that happened  When out and bought a FOUR STROKE
311162,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-26 17:23:00,709,2 stoke #1  you guys talk about smoke ..... mine must be mint cause it dosent.
311173,Tybo,2009-02-26 18:15:00,1373,"A new technology 2 stroke has less unburnt fuel in it's exhaust the a 4 stroke. New synthetic oils are biodegradable and have no ash. 2 stroke have more torque and are lighter,which mean the engine needs not to work as hard. In the research I have been doing. A 2 stroke gets about the  same fuel consumption. So please tell me how a  new 2 stroke  can pollute worse the a 4 stroke. the emission restrictions are higher on 2 stroke then they are on 4.  If you compare old to new technology. Nobody would be driving Japanese cars."
311223,Fisherman,2009-02-26 23:20:00,7201,"Well, makes you wonder why there's no 2 strokes in cars and trucks.  Weight isn't much of a factor anymore., and shake, shake, shake your booty should be left on the dancefloor, not in the boat.  I would also be sceptical of the emissions results of 2 strokes unless the motor is at full operating temps.  I can't see spending $$$ for synthetic oil, just to blow it out the exhaust, bio or not."
311231,GeorgeJ,2009-02-26 23:29:00,207,from what I have read about synthetic two stroke oil is not only is it cleaner burning it provides better lubrication for the engine.
311279,boatman,2009-02-27 01:35:00,350," Because back when cars were being invented/perfected the size of the 2 stroke engine required too move them would have been too noisey, caused too much vibration and used more fuel than 4 stroke engines. So the 4 stroke gas engine won the battle for automotive supremacy. It also beat out the steam and electric cars."
311280,Radnine,2009-02-27 01:36:00,1538,four stroke
310543,Bernie,2009-02-25 02:08:00,3190,The smaller but heavier 130 4 stroke sunk my boat down 4 more inches into the water Mike. It was properly propped and would push the boat 35 MPH. The 175 2 stroke is every bit as quiet as the Honda and just as smooth. It really doesn't matter to me what anybody buys. I'm just trying to let people know there are good options out there.
310548,Mike the Pike,2009-02-25 02:14:00,3421, How about a long distance race see who runs out of gas first
310551,fishhunter,2009-02-25 02:18:00,604,if it was a race who could run longer 20 lt of fuel you would loose to the 4storke. it will beat you in operating cost but you would win buy a min or two in speed so in the end is that winning in the big picture.
310554,GeorgeJ,2009-02-25 02:22:00,207,"did you guys hear about the new proposed mandatory home energy audit required when you sell your house at the tune of $300, who ever thought this could happen. Maybe a 2 stroke band in Canada is not out of the question, the closest I have heard of lake that has a 2 stroke band is in S Carolina but there may be some closer. Even if there is a chance they could band them in the next 15 years it be too soon to spend money on a 2 stroke now. There are quite a few 20 year old plus outboards still running and doing the job they were intended to do."
310561,Pigeontroller,2009-02-25 02:41:00,2793,Get the 4 stroke. You won't regret it.
310576,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-25 03:00:00,10439,  About 50%
310583,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-25 03:06:00,10439, Don't try taking a 2stroke on Alaska's Kenai River in July or August you won't like the fine you receive.
310598,Sinker,2009-02-25 03:45:00,8692,  I'm highly doubting that........got anything to prove it? Just curious.......  S.
310602,Mike the Pike,2009-02-25 03:52:00,3421, I think that  the 25hp there will be a little difference but I don't think 50%  I know when I had a 55hp Suzuki it sucked more than 50% more gas than My Honda 50hp 4 stroke. Sinker I really did see a hell of a difference in fuel costs.  Last year in November in Quinte when the price of gas was around the $1 mark I spent $34 for 3 days of fishing covering 25 to 30 miles per day
310603,Bernie,2009-02-25 03:53:00,3190,I have heard talk of banning 4 strokes on some northern lakes. Seems some are changing their oil right on the lake. Hmmmm 50% better? I will grant you some % on a smaller outboard but have to disagree on 50% too.
310604,motion,2009-02-25 03:53:00,403,"Go with the four stroke. I have a 100 Hp Yamaha and I love it. Had a 115 Merc two stroke and there is no comparison. Quieter, better gas consumption and you can troll with your four stroke at lower speeds. Just my $0.02.............."
310605,boatman,2009-02-25 03:55:00,350," Where did you get that number? Out of a hat? At wide open throttle (WOT) both 2 and 4 strokes get about the same fuel economy. Lots of published reports and comparisons on the net to prove it. You can't compare RPM's and fuel economy when you are comparing 2 and 4 strokes. That is why 4 strokes look so much more economical on paper. That isn't to say they can't be more economical, it is just that they may not be under certain conditions.  I think everyone needs to take a step back. He didn't ask if you prefer 2 or 4 stroke. He didn't ask about ETECs or if your boat performs better with a 135 or 175. What he asked is what is the better motor for his boat. If they were both the same horse power then we'd have a need for a discussion, but the fact of the matter is he is considering either a 25 hp 2 stroke or a 20 hp 4 stroke on a 14' jon boat max rated to 25 hp. Given these choices the answer is clearly the 2 stroke."
310606,Sinker,2009-02-25 03:59:00,8692,"I'm sure a 4 stroke is better on fuel. Im sure they're better for the environment. I'm sure they run smoother and quiter.   I know all this.......  The question here was a 25 2 stroke, or a 20 4 stroke on a 14ft duck boat rated for a 25.  I still say get the 25 2 stroke.......its a small boat, with no gadgets on it. No need for the charging system, no need for the extra weight with less power. Max power is the best you can do.  If your worried about the difference in gas.......you got issues.....we're talking a 25 HP........you'll prolly only need to fill the tank 3-4 times a season!!! You'd spend more on beer for one weekend!!!!  EDIT: Boatman beat me to it.....he knows his stuff!!!!  Sinker"
310607,fishhunter,2009-02-25 04:02:00,604,clearly 20 hp 4 stoke with out any question. http://www.deepscience.com/articles/engines.html have a look at this i think it will give you all you need to make your own mind up hope it helps and another http://smalloutboards.com/4Stroke.htm
310608,boatman,2009-02-25 04:07:00,350," How so? The 20 hp will have less hole shot, less top speed, more strain underload. Fuel economy will be negligible. So why is it better?"
310610,boatman,2009-02-25 04:14:00,350, That only explains why some motorbike guy likes 4 strokes better than 2 strokes. Doesn't explain why the 20 hp is better than the 25 hp on the poster's boat.
310612,fishhunter,2009-02-25 04:24:00,604,ever gone slow on a nice day with a 2 stroke then have have the wind pick up slow at your back and enjoy the nice smell of 2 choke smoke. start a 2 choke up in the morning and be siting in a cloud of smoke. try and enjoy a talk with your friend while your trying to talk over the motor. none of this happends with a 4 stroke and like i said before so you get to your spot 2 min before me what did you gain other then to say your beet me. i had a smooth ride with very little engine wine. cost me less to get to the spot. and when i get there and troll around i dont have to smell 2 stroke smell. guess for me having had both its a no brainer. if your still not sure go down to the boat lauch in the morning on a nice day watch boats fire up watch and listen the the motors the ones with smoke all around the boat is a 2 stroke and the one purring is a 4 stoke. again just my 3 cents
310614,jwl,2009-02-25 04:28:00,1056,"....I have had absolutely zero issues with my 40 -2 stroke, it's not silent to the effect that you wouldn't know the motor is on unless it was peeing water and beeped when you turn the key  , but it's not all that noisy.  It's decent enough on gas, you don't get choked out with fumes,planes out really quick which is great, my kids like to tube, and a couple people I know have ski'd and wake boarded behind my boat.  As far as oil fouling things up like the plugs....I have never had one issue with that, still the original plugs in it from new in 2003.  I use it 12 months a year with no issues at all in the cold either.  If I where to buy a new motor for my smaller boat-14 footer rated for a 15, I currently run an old 9.9 2 stroke on it, I would definately go with a 2 stroke for a new purchase if I replaced my motor I use now.  Weight would be a big factor as it is what they call an ultra lite utility boat and in comparison the 4 strokes look too big and heavy for the boat let alone the portablity aspect of having the tinner in the first place as a ""pop in the water anywhere"" boat for me....2 guys can pick it up and throw it in the water anywhere, load up the motor and gas and gear and off ya go  I even asked the guy at the dealership how the weight difference may affect the max horsepower rating just because I thought that the 4 strokes looked too big for the boat...being as the boat was new in 2003 and the market was not quite dominated by the 4 stroke bandwagon, they looked into it for me in the specs according to the 2008 booklet, the conclusion I got was the horsepower ratings didn't get affected but the max load for people/ motor/ gear is different  I am just giving an example.....you can always get some great advice from a fishing forum, but don't beat your head against the wall too long, there are always going to be huge differences of opinion...just like brands of motors,boats, cars, beer..ect......people like what they like and some will always say that thier choice is the best and everyone elses sucks    don't get caught up in all the hype..in the end do what you think will give you the most of what you  want out of your boat/motor combo"
310619,Sinker,2009-02-25 05:11:00,8692,"You guys make 2 strokes sound like all they do is blow smoke. Sure, there is a little smoke, but good gawd....nothing like you fellas make it out to be. Run some decent oil, and learn how to mix it properly. The smoke out of mine looks like steam........and I like the smell!!!  This isn't a 2stroke vs. 4 stroke discussion.

310649,boatman,2009-02-25 12:14:00,350,"At Yamaha's 100:1 mix there will be very little smoke. Use synthetic oil and there will be half as much smoke. Synthetic marine oil is also biodegradable.  Even my antique outboards which run at 24:1 don't smoke so bad that you ""choke"". I use synthetic oil and you only notice the smoke at start up when its cold.  I have two newer Yamaha 15 hp 2 strokes at work and they barely smoke. They also troll right down and don't rattle a lot. You can't compare the old 2 strokes to today's. New ones are engineered so much better.  Actually, Bushart, hole shot is important for any planing hull boat regardless of hp."

If you are taking the engine off and on your boat constantly, go 2 stroke. Lighter to lift and carry. Also an advantage is better power to weight ratio. 4 strokes are heavier and it's taking away efficentcy. I like the 2 stroke throttle responce and quick planing ability. On the other side of the coin a 4 stroke may be better on fuel. Here it will depend on how much use it will actually get. To each his own, thats why they make both."

310464,Fisherman,2009-02-25 00:00:00,7201,"I wouldn't consider doing an oil change on a 4 stroke ""extra maintenance"" matter of fact probably much less maintenance because, 1. you don't have to keep refilling the oil reservoir on a 4 stroke, and, 2, in my case, my 12 year old Honda 25 is running on the 2nd set of plugs,  I may change them this spring, so the extra work theory is pretty much shot."
310468,Mike the Pike,2009-02-25 00:03:00,3421,"I have had both small and large.  My first was a 55hp Suzuki 2 stroke quick hole shot hard on gas smokey and noisy.  I also had an 8hp 2 stroke Yamaha yes it was a pleasure to carry compared to the 4 stroke 7.5 Honda four stroke that I had but again too noisy and too smokey.  These days I have a 50hp Honda 4 stroke as well as a 2hp now I will never go back to a 2 stroke.  Only the speed freaks will tell ya to get a 2 stroke but for you 25hp will be pleasantly quiet when trolling.  Pay the extra money and buy the fuel saving 4 stroke.  check out this article.  BTW nice boat and good luck with your purchase.   The decision to purchase an outboard engine is getting more selective as technology improves. As of now the majority of consumers are faced with several options when deciding upon what kind of outboards will best suite them. The number one factor lately is whether to purchase a new or used two stroke or four stroke engine. When faced with this decision you must prioritize several features that are prevalent in each motor. For example, two-stroke motors are lighter, faster (in most cases) and less expensive. Four-stroke motors are cleaner, smoother, and more economical. Many people who run in lakes and rivers prefer 4 stroke boat motors because they make great trolling motors and meet the 2006 EPA mandated requirements. Others prefer 2 stroke engines when the need for top end performance and acceleration takes precedence. This is not to say that two-stroke engines cannot troll or four stroke motors are not fast. It's just a matter of preferences, features, and benefits that attract customers. Regardless of what you choose to purchase, if you use due diligence and do your research you cannot go wrong, Below is a table of pros and cons for both motors:  2-Stroke Outboards Pros* Cons* Lighter More Pollution Accelerate Fast, In some Cases More Top End \ Smoke Purchase Price Less Expensive\ Must Mix Gas with Oil (Non Oil Injection Models) Easier to Repair Rougher Idle \than 4 strokes Have Been Around For Almost 80 Years \Noiser than Four Stroke Outboards Very Strong Used Market Harder to Start (in some cases) Parts Availability\ Carburetors gum up if not used often High Resale Value, High Demand Spark Plug Fouling Simple Design Meaning Less Things To Go Wrong -  4-Stroke Outboards Pros* Cons* Quiet and Smooth \Heavy Good Fuel Economy\ Often Expensive to Repair Great Trolling Motors \Not As Many Trained Mechanics Yet (Growing Rapidly) No Oil/Gas Mixture \Often Expensive to Purchase Smooth Idle \Technology Still Being Improved Less Pollution \Very Limited Used Market (Although Growing Rapidly) Accepted at Any Body of Water \More Parts to Malfunction (Technology Improving)* Future Production will Be all 4-Stroke or Similar \Most Not as Powerful as 2-Stroke Rated At Same HP* Very Reliable \Harder to transport or position in storage w/o a stand *These are based on AFA Marine's Comparisons. We in no way are responsible for purchasing decisions influenced by the material found on this web page. Please do your own research prior to making an outboard motor purchase. This article does not compare direct fuel injected 2 stroke models. Summary:  What should I buy, a 4-Stroke or a 2-Stroke? Well that really depends on your boating situation. Here is list that may help you decide which motor is appropriate for you.  Choosing a Four-Stroke Outboard Engine When you are required to operate in a ""4-Stroke Only"" body of water To use as a lake trolling motor when smooth and quiet operation is a priority Larger budget to spend on a motor When weight of engine is not an issue When you feel as though noise and smoke are serious factors in your purchasing decision To use as a kicker or emergency back up motor on your boat. If you don't want the hassle of mixing gas and oil. If you are dissatisfied with two stroke performance Choosing a Two-Stroke Outboard Engine When you are not required to operate in a ""4-Stroke Only"" body of water To use as an emergency back up or kicker motor Limited budget to spend on a motor When weight of engine is an issue and you want the most power for the weight. Familiarity with engine repairs Limit budge on repair costs Hard usage and abuse and you want something that can be modified, repaired, and adjusted easily Speed, acceleration, top-end, and performance are issues. Interested in finding a good deal on a used motor. There are more used 2-stroke outboards available. If you want motor that all marine mechanics are certified to work on. You really cannot go wrong with either choice. Both motors have their advantages and limitations. Right now you are safe to purchase a 2-stroke motor in most places and not have to worry about being excluded from boating. There are some lakes that require 4-stroke motors but the majority have not adapted these mandates yet. We suggest that you review some of the information on this page as a source of knowledge when it comes time to purchase an outboard motor. Sincerely,"
310475,smokin joe,2009-02-25 00:22:00,226,I would have to say a 4 stroke simply in case they pass the ban on 2 strokes.
310477,Mike the Pike,2009-02-25 00:28:00,3421,  You should go with the maximum HP which is 25hp 4 stroke yes it costs more electric start is always better.Buy what you want now and not regret it later.Ask the dealer where you purchased the boat which shaft lenghth you will need.If you buy the 4 stroke you will get the money back in fuel savings less spark plugs and no oil to mix or buy.If you can get the motor with power trim then buy that too it will improve the performance of the boat and saves fuel.  You saved alot on the boat why not spend more on the motor.Can't wait for your decision   I bought my boat new last year transfered my old motor 50hp Honda onto the new boat but my maximum hp was 60hp it was not enough for my heavier boat. I just bought a ..........
310486,Sinker,2009-02-25 00:44:00,8692,"I wouldn't think twice about a 25 2 stroke. There is nothing wrong with 2 stroke engines. The yammies run 100:1 mix.......that's barely any oil at all.  If you put a 20 4 stroke, beside a 25 2 stroke, the 4 stroke will be MASSIVE! A 2 stroke 25 will make your boat fly.  I know, I know.......4 strokes are the way to go, so much quieter, so much cleaner......blah, blah, blah.......I still like my 2 strokes.  I have a 40 2 stroke on my boat. A 40 4 stroke is almost 100lbs heavier......and just friggen massive. I raced a guy with a 40 4 stroke and just smoked him. Same hull.  Again, I wouldn't even think about it, get that 2 stroke. You won't upgrade, because your maxed out on power. If you do upgrade, it will be the whole rig.........  I wouldn't put a 4 stroke on my own boat. JMHO  Too friggen big and heavy........and I like the smell of a 2 stroke on a nice cold morning  Sinker"
310489,diggyj,2009-02-25 00:46:00,548,I'd go with a 4 stroke. Better on gas and the lake and the environment.
310491,GeorgeJ,2009-02-25 00:47:00,207,Link to Yamaha specs  Hard to believe but the Yamaha specs have the 20hp 4 stroke at only about 10lbs more than the 25hp 2 stroke
310497,holdfast,2009-02-25 00:56:00,1813,"I would go with the 4 stroke.  The Only Disadvantage is its heavier.  Advantages.  Quieter Better on Gas Trolls down Electric Start.  Did I say electric start cheaper on oil easier maintenance  Heres the Kicker, dont want to start rumours, but I got a feeling going green may ban some two strokes in some waters in the near future."
310501,Sinker,2009-02-25 01:00:00,8692,"  Exaclty.......more weight and less power!!!!  Put it this way, if you had a choice of more power with a lighter engine, or less power with a heavier engine what would you do??  How much fuel do you think you'll save with a 20 4 stroke over a 25 2 stroke??  If you have the right power on your boat, the last thing your going to worry about is fuel......especially on a 25 hp.  To me, the 2 stroke makes more sense. Less money, less weight, more power.  4 stroke is a tiny bit less money, more weight, less power........doesn't make sense to me??  Its your choice in the end, but there is nothing wrong with a 2 stroke!!!!!  Sinker"
310506,Fishn Technishn,2009-02-25 01:08:00,198,"All depends on what kind of boating you want to do!  Two years ago, I bought a new 16' dual console and maxed out the HP with a 75 Mercury 2 stroke. I have had both 2 and 4 and they each have advantages etc. I did a lot of research/questions/list/pros/cons!! Almost drove myself (and everyone else nuts)Biggest decision maker was ""how do we plan to use this motor,today,tomorrow?"" Me, I zip out to where I want to go and then use my Minnkota, don't hardly ever troll as I am mainly a Caster(Musky). Kids like to go tubing/boarding etc a lot. 4 stroke wouldn't get them up as well. So far NO REGRETS. Very little maintenance just routine, key is to be pro-active. THERE ARE SOME 200 MOVING PARTS IN A 4 STROKE  AND MAYBE 10  IN A 2 STROKE!! I do 95% of maintenance myself. I currently have a Honda 9.9 for a kicker and it does that job fantastic!  Do your research and you will be fine. Just remember that you will sooner or later need to get it serviced ...so make certain that a dealer is close by  FT"
310514,boatman,2009-02-25 01:21:00,350,"Both are fine motors. Since you don't have a preference between 2 or 4 stroke and you are just looking for the best performance possible then the answer is obvious. You should get the 2 stroke. More power + less weight + less money = the better option. The only real benefit of the 4 stroke is the electric start and quieter running.  Fuel consumption may be better with the 4 stroke, but that depends on how you run it. At WOT they all use about the same amount of fuel. The savings come at trolling and (sometimes) cruising speeds. However, the 20 hp will have to work harder to attain the same cruising speed as the 25 hp. Could be you won't see any fuel savings at all so I wouldn't use that as a determining factor in this case."
310520,Mike the Pike,2009-02-25 01:34:00,3421, Sinker most motors being 4 stroke or 2 stroke have the same top speed .I admit the 2 stroke gets you there faster .I have owned both have you?  no more 2 SMOKES for me.  4 stroke all the way.BTW you have the right boat  let the can of worms be open  
310527,Bernie,2009-02-25 01:42:00,3190,Not all of them smoke Mike.   You know that. As a matter of fact there are 2 strokers out there that have less emissions than most 4 strokes. Using proper mixtures and good oil in your 2 strokers will result in less smoke too.  As far as top speed  I also disagree. The extra weight of the 4 stroke slows you down all things being equal.
310529,Mike the Pike,2009-02-25 01:48:00,3421, I think you fiberglass boat performs better with your etech because it has 40 more hp that the 130 Honda you were running.I think you were somewhat under powered before you upgraded to 175hp this may explain why the Honda used more fuel than you etech it was forcing too much.
310530,fishhunter,2009-02-25 01:49:00,604,I have had Lots of 2 chokers in my days and own 3  4 strokes now 50 and 2/ 9.9 all yamaha and if a few mph is the diffence think of it this way if it takes you 20 min to get to a spot with a 2 choker and takes you 21.5 min with a 4 stroke what is 1.5 min. to have a motor that can troll all day with no smoke. clean running. great on fuel and oh ya it purrrrrrrrrssssssss not spits and sputters lol Look at all buys as pay now or pay later. Buy the best now and forget the rest. if you are not sure most dealers will let you do a water test to close a deal. so put money down to hold the deal and ask the dealer for a water test in the spring. just my 3 cents worth ps oh ya and the 4 stoke will charge better then any 2 choker
310532,Mike the Pike,2009-02-25 01:56:00,3421, well said .  Bernie is right I think the new Etechs do not smoke my question is do they shake alot during a slow troll every one I ever used was annoying shake rattle and roll while trolling .Not to mention they make other things in the boat vibrate.
310533,John Bacon,2009-02-25 01:58:00,3277,"""When you are required to operate in a ""4-Stroke Only"" body of water""  Do these ""4-Stroke Only"" bodies of water actually exist?  Is there a single lake in Ontario that bans 2 strokes but allows 4 strokes?  What about other provinces or even the states?"
310536,2 tone z71,2009-02-25 02:03:00,1311,"yeah without question 4 Stroke Yamaha,I could tell ya about my last E tec or #s of friends that bought the hype of E tec and are/where very dissapointed,plugs within 40hrs complete powerheads in less than 150 hrs Max ,turning pitifull lil props to reach max Rpms,Great fuel economy thou,IMO todays injected 2 strokes are so choked up with emissions crap such as my 07 115 Etec they cant compete,theres also twin 200 HO Etecs on the work boat that have been semi flawless ,my Money is on 4 stroke from here out"
310537,Sinker,2009-02-25 02:04:00,8692," That will not happen in my lifetime.  And yes Mike, I've had both.  I would put my 2 stroke up against any 4 stroke 40 in a race......I'll win everytime.  I know its not about speed. Its about what you get for your money. Why pay more for less??? Doesn't make sense to me.  We're talking a 25 here......not a 250!  Sinker"
310538,holdfast,2009-02-25 02:04:00,1813," LOL Take it easy, but it makes for a good Rumour eh.  But then again some idiot wanted us to pay a Carbon Tax."
