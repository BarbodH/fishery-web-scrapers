311325,duxbware,2009-02-27 03:30:00,102,I was at Bass pro today and I was looking at a plastic bait kit. You know all different colors of grubs and worms. It got me thinking....Do the grubs dry up if they are taken out of the bag they came in and placed in a tackle box ?   DUXBWARE!!
311326,rbaquial,2009-02-27 03:31:00,968,"I think you may be confusing it with Berkley's Gulp stuff... that stuff, if its taken and left out of the bag for a long time - it'll eventually dry up and shrivel."
311335,duxbware,2009-02-27 03:44:00,102,I guess my question was a little confusing now that I read it myself. Question is..... if you take plastic grubs or worms out of its sealed zip locked package and place them in a tackle box do they dry up?
311336,rbaquial,2009-02-27 03:48:00,968,"Hmmm... Thats a rather interesting question (now its been rephrased)? Hmmm... I would assume they would be OK... provided they aren't scented or flavored? if anything.. if THEY ARE scented/flavored... you spent extra money for the scent/flavor for nothing? Especially to just leave it out in a tackle box, rather than its original packaging? But I don't know... can anyone help in providing an answer to this - I'm pretty interested myself....Thanks for asking this question Duxbware."
311355,JPD,2009-02-27 05:18:00,296,The plastics that are in the kits are fine like that. They will not dry up over time. The only baits you really want to keep sealed up are Gulp! baits. I have even stored Powerbait plastics in Plano containers for years on end and that stink never went away!!!  JP
311356,rbaquial,2009-02-27 05:21:00,968,Whom better to get an answer than from a Professional Fisherman himself... Mr. JP DeRose!  w00t!!
311357,OhioFisherman,2009-02-27 05:27:00,6623,"Same as JPD, never had any problems with regular baits stored in plano boxes. He is right on the Gulp Baits.  A side note though keep the same color baits together though some will bleed colors."
311360,BassAsin,2009-02-27 05:37:00,806,"good point, its alos good to play with, withe and red baits together for a night will leave red ""blood"" colour on the white baits and so on and so on, play with it a bit  Matt!"
311363,EC1,2009-02-27 06:19:00,930," Is it embarassing for you to buy HOT PINK / BUBBLEGUM coloured lures? LOL just kidding with you  But anyways, mix those colours to your heart's content! Maybe you'll invent a mixture of colours that beats all the colours that are on the market!"
311364,SNAGKING,2009-02-27 06:21:00,43,Never had trouble with plastics losing scent in my plano. Only complaint is it will be greasy and smelly after a while.
311480,Ramble,2009-02-27 16:21:00,713, White and Chartruse together....play with it a bit  -Dave
311658,duxbware,2009-02-27 21:52:00,102,Thanks guys. Never posted to much on this site before. Thanks for your help.  Todd.
311696,bbog,2009-02-27 23:07:00,665,I put all my crappie tubes in a plano but keep the larger plastics in their bags. Never had a problem with them drying out.
