311877,Cookslav,2009-02-28 14:51:00,1457,"  That vid was correct except for the direction of the stroke. You should never bring the knive inward...lotta hot shots on the food network stick to the old school ways and set a bad exsample. But truth be told, You'll straiten your edge regardless of the direction you run. The fundimental difference is you can't cut your self if your running the knife away from yourself, were there is an increased risk you'll catch yourself by bringing it in ward.  To each there own, both directions work...one is safe, one is not.  But yeah I'd throw that knife out, and get a new one unless your partial to it? Cause the only real way to sharpen it is to get a good stone or sharpening system which will cost more then the $10 you spent. Or you could have it sharpened at your local knife store but again...its gonna cost a few bucks. A steel is great for Maintaining your knife after, and before each use, but even that only prolongs your next actual sharpening. Cheers,"
311541,chickenhawk,2009-02-27 18:45:00,612,Well i got about 15 perch here to clean but my knife is way too dull.....i've never sharpened one like this before....how do i do it?  Hawk

311547,Evan Gallimore,2009-02-27 18:56:00,37,"I've seen you clean fish, you can't blame that on the knife, lol if it'a cheap knife your better just to get a new one, the metal of the cheaper knives it to soft and dosn't hold a good edge for long unless you sharpen it after every fish or 2  and dont forget Your still a rube.. j/k  Gallimore"

Hawk
311557,carp-starter,2009-02-27 19:05:00,253,"What you have there are called 'steel'.  Chicken, any steel will work. It does not matter what it looks like.  carp-starter "
311566,chickenhawk,2009-02-27 19:13:00,612,yes but how am i supposed to use it....is there a certain way to run the blade against the steel?
311579,Roy,2009-02-27 19:36:00,13728,A steel will NOT sharpen your blade. A steel is used mainly to keep an edge straight.
311581,chickenhawk,2009-02-27 19:38:00,612,lol i should just go buy a new knife.....this one sucks anyway....made by storm...i think it was like 10 bucks at the lodge
311583,douG,2009-02-27 19:40:00,2693,"http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/culinarytools/ht/honing.htm  What Roy said.  Using the steel is the second stage in sharpening a knife - it straightens and aligns the edge.  If the knife is dull, then you need to shape the edge by removing a small amount of the blade by using a sharpening stone, crock sticks or similar.  The trick to using any of these sharpening tools is the ability to maintain a constant angle between the blade and the stone, or blade and steel.  If you don't do this, your knife edge just gets rounder and duller the more you 'sharpen it'."
311584,johnnyb,2009-02-27 19:41:00,3413,Yeah..sounds like you should buy a new one...if you find the Rapala ones that come with the sharpener...they also include instructions so you don't have to give up on sharpening and buy another knife 
311652,GBW,2009-02-27 21:34:00,8460,Here ya go.  I use steel all the time and works very well for me...  http://www.videojug.com/film/sharpening-a-knife-with-a-steel
311731,richyb,2009-02-28 00:35:00,774,what kind of fishing guide cant use a steel to shapen a knife ?  JUST KIDDING. I use one every day.
311734,misfish,2009-02-28 00:41:00,29133,"A nice fine stone and oil will do the job for ya. Swish,slash,swish,slash.  Im thinking a vid is in order for this. I,ll get back to this thread later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Saturday afternoon."
311735,irishfield,2009-02-28 00:43:00,26272, One day doing it that way he's gonna cut his tallywacker off. Absolutely nuts steeling towards one's self !  Generally all I ever use to keep the knifes sharp in the house and cottage. Still have the one out of my fathers butcher shop...as well as the meat block.
311742,Burtess,2009-02-28 01:02:00,901, But thats the proper method..... you shouldn't cut anything off unless you're retarded lol.....  For touching up an edge a steel is fine... for sharpening I use a Spyderco Sharpmaker...  absolutely fantastic for putting a sticky sharp edge on pretty much anything....  Burt
311745,irishfield,2009-02-28 01:14:00,26272,I watched my father.. and myself for that matter.. cut thru enough fingers on the meat saw... no need to do it cleaning the edge up on a knife with a steel. Was always taught to steel away from yourself...like any knife use and I'll continue that way.
311750,tschirk,2009-02-28 01:34:00,261,in a fix use the rough bottom ring of a porcelain coffee mug. draw the edge of the blade forward & lightly across a section of the ring. 10 times on each side of the blade. Carefully hold knife at same angle for each pass.
311768,Greencoachdog,2009-02-28 02:27:00,8163,"A dull fillet knife is a sure sign of a sloppy/poor fisherman!!!  Your fillet knife should be maintained before, during, and after each fish cleaning/filleting!!!"
311799,Sinker,2009-02-28 03:29:00,8692," Well said GCD!!  My knives are all VERY sharp, and they stay that way. Knives for fish, ONLY cut fish. Knives for meat ONLY cut meat.  A sharp knife is safer than a dull knife.  I use an oil stone to sharpen, with 2 different grits, one on each side. If you maintain them, you should only have to use the stone a couple times per season. A steel is all I use the most. Sometimes in a pinch, a sink will work. A strap of leather also keeps a nice edge. There is a definite knack to sharpening, you don 't want to be in a rush.  I agree with the statement mentioned about a guide with a dull knife.......whats up with that?? If you were my guide, I'd show you a few things. A dull knife is about as useful as a dead battery........a guide thats cleaning my fish with a dull knife wouldn't touch my fish!!  Sinker"
311802,richyb,2009-02-28 03:36:00,774,another quick way to keep an edge if you dont have a stone or steel is the top of your vehicles window. Roll it down and use the top edge.
311810,Greencoachdog,2009-02-28 04:14:00,8163, If my guide had a dull fillet knife... I'd be wondering where the real fish were?... and why I got stuck with a sub-par novice when I'm paying guide prices!!!???  His tip would be the size of a Paramecium!
311811,douG,2009-02-28 04:16:00,2693,"I think that is a great idea, richyb.  The ground, rounded and true edge should work really well.  I think like most things, someday, I hope to get good at it."
311840,bigugli,2009-02-28 11:39:00,6138,"A steel, or carbides, are great tools for keeping your edges trued and sharp. Over time a blade does flatten out and lose the bevel. At that point you need to resort to a stone to bring back the bevel and a good edge. Not too difficult on a Rapala blade. A bit more work on blades  with a higher RC count like a Mora filet knife or a cutter's sloyd knife."
