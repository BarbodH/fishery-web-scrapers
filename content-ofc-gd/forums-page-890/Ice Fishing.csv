311766,irishfield,2009-02-28 02:20:00,26272,Grab a reg book and start reading. U can ice fish most places 'till the ice isn't safe and then you can use a boat for at least some species.
311804,Leecher,2009-02-28 03:53:00,7832,"Don't know where you're from but out here in QC, March 31st 2009 is the last day. If you're from Ontario, like irishfield said, download a copy of the regs from the MNR WEB site and find out when the season ends in your region.  Leechman"
311839,fishhunter,2009-02-28 11:32:00,604,I fish the ice till you cant go on it safely anymore. normaly for me way into the end of march on some of my lakes. then its time to get the boat out and start pushing the last of the ice out ofthe way.
311879,Fisherman,2009-02-28 14:58:00,7201,"When the ice is gone and you're floating...read the REGS! Oh, and huts don't have to be off the ice by March 15th in all places...read some more."
311886,Handlebarz,2009-02-28 15:33:00,3790,I think it was Feb 8th for me this year as the warm weather and lots of rain took my ice away here on the river and I dont care much for perch fishing so till next year it over.  As others said it depends on the regs check the area you are in or post the place you need to find out about I know you will get the correct answer.
