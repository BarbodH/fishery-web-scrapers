"
311962,irishfield,2009-02-28 21:49:00,26272,Great stuff Simon !!!  Good to see her ticking stuff off her list that she's never? done.  My mother (83) did similar... went for a ride on my brothers Harley Police special last summer and also went tubing behind the boat when at the lake with us 2 summers ago. Funny and sad all at the same time and why we should all give'r all we've got now while we still can..
311964,John,2009-02-28 21:56:00,2956,That's great Simon. Cherish those times that you can spend together. I know very well how much I missed my parents when they were in the UK and I was here.
311965,Joey,2009-02-28 21:56:00,9122,That's great Simon.  Good on yer mom for being adventurous  Joey

He was asking his grandson why he couldn't keep up  I guess my point is that it's amazing how we percieve the aging process.  Remember when a lot of us though 30 was old, the 40, etc....  We'll all get there soon enough and not think anything of it.  I agree with you both that that's where we get our inspiration, and that's why we don't think much of it once it's us!"
311975,Greencoachdog,2009-02-28 22:12:00,8163,That's great Simon!!!  Now take her out on a good Ling fishin' trip!
311983,Roy,2009-02-28 22:23:00,13728,You take care of her Simon. She sounds like a pearl for sure. We only have to look at you to know that your parents are probably nice folks.  Great thread!
312010,trapshooter,2009-02-28 23:24:00,1234,Too cool Simon.  Did you put her on some fish or what???
312024,limeyangler,2009-02-28 23:57:00,5204,"  Not yet Ben....maybe in a week or so....the baby is due to be induced on Tuesday if it doesn't arrive before that.......i'm kinda grounded fishing wise lol, but i might just be able to sneak to Thunder lake in the morning as i've worked out a direct route from our lawn across Lake Wabigoon...hopefully get my dad some trout for lunch/supper."
312055,brkygetr,2009-03-01 01:42:00,425,Wicked!!!!!   LOL!!! Were you drivin???...80ish???
