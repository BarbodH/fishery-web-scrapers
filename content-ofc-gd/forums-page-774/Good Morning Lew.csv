394662,Spiel,2009-10-20 08:37:00,9065,"Good morning Mike (and everyone else).  I've been up since 3am, couldn't sleep knowing my buddy is off to the Saugeen without me....."
394664,SlowPoke,2009-10-20 08:45:00,2984,Good morning Mike. I got up early to beat the rush at the gas pumps.
394666,lew,2009-10-20 08:56:00,12766,"Mornin boyz  I got up at 2 this morning, just can't see wasting my life sleeping"
394669,Greencoachdog,2009-10-20 09:13:00,8163, I was up at 3 this morning... sleep is so overrated eh Lew!
394670,Harrison,2009-10-20 09:27:00,2202,"Morning Lewski, glad to see your back in town, maybe a lunch is in order when you get a chance.  Cheers,  Phil"
394671,lew,2009-10-20 09:37:00,12766,"Any day is good for me Phil, just lemme know when."
394672,Beans,2009-10-20 09:40:00,3339,G'Mornin' Guys...I'm not usually up this early unless for a fishing trip but I have a 07:30 am appointment for a cystoscopy procedure (my 3rd) at P'boro Hospital today...  This scope (and everyone every three months) is to make sure the low-grade malignant bladder tumor they removed in July has not returned...  I'm hoping the procedure gets better with time as it is the most uncomfortable thing I have experienced...they only use a bit of freezing on the end of the scope...
394673,Roy,2009-10-20 09:45:00,13728,3am here. Have a great day everyone. Good luck to you Norm....I must say I don't envy you your day.
394674,Greencoachdog,2009-10-20 09:48:00,8163," They should have that thing ""wallowed"" out by now eh Beansy???  ... maybe you could practice at home with a piece of coaxial cable or something?  Good luck with the procedure Beans!... ask for ""general"" anesthisia instead of ""local""!"
394683,BITEME,2009-10-20 11:38:00,1968,Morning Big Bird
394689,bigugli,2009-10-20 11:57:00,6138,Who has time for sleep. Up at 5 walking my little beasties.  BLT at 6.
394724,irishfield,2009-10-20 13:06:00,26272,"Mike, it's what happens when you get older and have to get up at 3am to pee..... and can't remember the way back to the bedroom!"
394833,Beans,2009-10-20 19:42:00,3339, I asked for the 'general' but was told he only does that if he is operating...the whole procedure only lasts for about 5 minutes...( the guy before me only took 3 minutes)...  Anyhow it is done for another three months...it hurts to take a leak at present but that improves quickly...drinking lots of water...no blood in my pee this time...
