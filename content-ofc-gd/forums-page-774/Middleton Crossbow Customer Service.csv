Two weeks ago a good friend asked if he could borrow it, he was having a problem getting a part for his crossbow (not a Middleton) and since I knew I wouldn't be able to get out for a while and I knew he was in a jam, I reluctantly agreed.  Sunday evening I got a phone call; my crossbow was broken! The part that holds the bolt in the bow had snapped off. I talked to Derrick @ Middleton yesterday morning and he shipped me the part Canada Post Express yesterday, NO CHARGE! It turns out that when they say ""lifetime warranty"" they mean it!  If you are thinking about getting a crossbow, check out the Middleton 375, not only is it the fastest, hardest hitting crossbow available but they sure know what ""customer service"" is all about!  Thanks again Sam and Derrick!"
