394024,Crazyhook,2009-10-18 02:58:00,1154,This is just aweful... breaking the law and putting it on film and then the film gets put on the news... http://www.justnews.com/video/21212068/index.html ( FYI all sharks caught and kept must be caught with hook and line.. not   a gaff

If it's against the law to do what they did, they'll all be busted like the Sturgeon guy a month back. Hard to believe they're bragging about it on TV if it's illegal."
394194,Joey,2009-10-19 00:03:00,9122,That's just unbelievable Jamie!!!  How can they get away with that without anybody thinking its not right?  I hope they get caught and fined like they should be.  Joey

394229,Greencoachdog,2009-10-19 01:20:00,8163,Complete Bull!!!... they had to have hit it with a 12 gauge power point or just shot it... no way you're just going to gaff a 748 lb. Mako and land it!!!... get real!!!  Video is too chopped up to be believeable!!!... I guess an idiot might believe it!
