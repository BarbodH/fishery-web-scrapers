394980,aniceguy,2009-10-21 02:16:00,1094,"Im not going to anything that was replied, for obvious reasons  other then to comment, catch and release morality on steelhead is much less then 10% I can only assume how one would get home if the party they fished with had thier car seized by seneca nation for fishing without a liscence, would one have left thier friend in thier jail cell to await fine payment on Monday, or called the local Canadian consulate getting charged in a foreign country is a serious offense, in particular on native land which is governed by its own sets of intertwined rules.  How would someone feel if a local native on the reserve inpounded the gear car and more, simply asking for a 2k fine to be paid.....its endless the negative conotations to fishing, i only ask knowing this as as reasonable person how could one even allow a friend to be placed in that situation.........with friends like that who needs ....well the rest is obvious, the refernece to bandana's is simple, the natives who live on seneca drive ATV's carry 12 guage and some with handguns doing what is within thier legal rights patrol Thier land pointing a gun at one and asking for a liscence to be on his/her land is thier right....that fact they wear bandana's and face masks is just common knowlege nothing more...  Actually talking to that fact of fishing illegally in a foreign country or for that fact in our own, if it disuades one single person from fishing without a liscence, goes and buys one contirbutes to a fishery then it did good in the thread....and the fishery.  I have fished with HIM he is courtious and protective of his fish, will on a dime stop fishing to teach someone not as experienced on how to release a fish handle a fish and more...his expolits and postings have turned many on to the sport, another good thing as more that participate in chasing chromers the more some guys can use that as leverage to push the agenda of hot fast chromers stuffing every nook of rivers in ontario find fault in that"
394982,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-21 02:18:00,0,a float fishermans quarrel eh? are you guys gonna fence with noodle rods or something?
394984,BillM,2009-10-21 02:19:00,17367,"Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and you are certainly entitled to yours.  I fish with Mike and a lot of other guys who have fished that river for a long long time, before it was ever the in thing to do.  Could I see the impact on a river that is completely self sustaining with no type of additional stocking?  For sure.  But for a river that get's something like 90,000 stocked fish per year like Wallico mentioned?  It just doesn't add up even with the mortality rates you quoted."
394989,River Rat,2009-10-21 02:35:00,161," Well, thanks for being the first person to say I am entitled to my opinion. How do you think that river became the in thing to do ? really think about that and be honest with yourself.  I could be off on the mortallity rate but it's a number I have seen in many articles on multiple species. If you consider that not all anglers understand where to land a fish, how fast to play them in etc...that rate seems about right to me but I guess the experts say it's too high.....ANYWAY, I was there the weekend after...those fish were beat, hard. period. That post had a HUGE impact on that pod of fish.  Egos man....it's all about egos  RR"

394996,aniceguy,2009-10-21 02:45:00,1094," ok as a representive for king pin an advocate of rod builders and more I guess the question Im asking if with your knowledge of the system above and below the reserve how could you let a friend fish without a liscence knowing the potential conflicts that could have arose.  Why didnt you take him up or down on NY land?  If your knowledge of the river is limited or non existant beyond the reserve and the patch patching why risk it, go left or right at the gas station there is piles of rivers to fish both ways where you wont risk getting arrested for fishing illegally I guess thats my question Im just trying to understand how such a high profile guy in the steelhead community would do something like that...  Sorta like Henry and Italo in the old days, if you dont want to answer I respect your right to not on it have a great night"

395058,aniceguy,2009-10-21 12:16:00,1094,"There is a discernable difference between the pressure that can be put on a large US trib as opposed to a small river such as some of the east ones, showing a pic of fish at the twin pipes is a big difference then showing them of the catt  let’s not split hairs on that because it’s obvious.  Trust me while this is a great site, it can’t even come close to the pressure some of the US sites put on it.  Any seasoned angler can look up flow data and know if that creek will fish huge any that doesn’t and wants to explore it has to drive up 1 road and see cars parked everywhere, for the most part its US plates  I brought up the specifics of bringing an angler to fish with no license for the obvious image it portrays. There is no malice with it. Have a good day this thread is gone beyond its usefulness thanks"

Any recommendations as to where to fish? Gowanda or Reserve??  Any help would be great guys and gals.  JFish"
394773,solopaddler,2009-10-20 16:33:00,8605,"Seneca One Stop right in Irving for the license, open 24hrs. As far as where, walk the river and fish it. If you can read water you'll do okay."
394780,JFish,2009-10-20 16:55:00,29,Hi Solo.  Thanks for the info.  I'm not looking for any fishing spots just access points for parking close to the river where I won't get ticketed.  I tried to find parking on google maps but it didn't help much.  I have never been there before.  JFish
394800,blaque,2009-10-20 17:42:00,2419,"Like solo said..........one stop is about the main hub for a res. license.  Having said that........fishing the reservation isnt the advantage it used to be. Used to give you a better shot at finding some open water..........paying for that extra res license was a way to buy a little elbow room......those times are long gone. There are days i find more open water off the res. than on.  If your looking for some room, some fish, and some scenery.........wait till the fish push way up and trek down into the valley. Its georgeous fishing down there in the snow, but bring your extra lung and leave the felt bottoms at home if the snows falling......a repel rope would come in handy as well. Its all worth it though."
394805,River Rat,2009-10-20 17:58:00,161,"There are 5 or 6 places that you can get licenses in the area. I know this because I visited all of them last year trying to find a license for a buddy with me but they were ALL sold out...all of them.  This was the Saturday after a HUGE post was put on here (OFC) showing all the holes and runs in pics and videos....with comentary and fish numbers talking about a huge pod of ""suicidal dropbacks"".....the post was put up on the Thursday, by saturday all 5 stores were sold out of licenses.....it was a zoo like I haven't seen since opener out east. We fished for a couple hours (my buddy took his chances) and after hooking a few beat up droppies that had obviously been caught already, we decided to leave (for the 3.5 hour drive home) rather than add to the pressure these poor fish were under.  Carefull with your questions and answers in the public discussion forum guys....1000's are watching this and other sites. The damage caused is not reversable.....and this river is damaged now IMO.  Seneca had licences last weekend....hope you drive a 4x4.  Cheers  RR"

Well, I havne't decided now if I'm even going to fish the Rez.  Might just get a state lic. and take our chances upstream.   I have gotten mixed feelings from people about fishing the Rez. vs. upstream.  Zoar valley area does look like a great place to be fishing even if your not catching much, though I would like to catch .  Most responses that I have got are PM's which would keep any info off the public board.  I haven't got any secret spots nor do I expect any.  Yes, I have 4x4.  JFish"

394825,msp,2009-10-20 19:02:00,1336, The damage was done years ago. Although adding fuel to the fire doesnt help matters much. People just dont know how to keep a secret anymore. I think that some  people have learned their lesson. Some have not. Oh well.....to bad so sad. Good luck Jfish !!

394853,wallacio,2009-10-20 20:53:00,475," There is no doubt that detailed reports with recognizable backgrounds will draw additional pressure to a particular location however I'm not following the logic of declaring the Catt a ""damaged"" river due to the pressure it sees.  It is stocked annually with over 90,000 fish (though it does have upwards of 25% wild fish)...as long as the NYDEC keeps up the stocking and people practise selective harvest (which most do on the Catt, in fact the vast majority of anglers practise C&R based on my observations anyway), there will be lots of fish to go around and as already mentioned, it's easy to find less pressured water if you stay away from the ""tourist traps""."

394877,solopaddler,2009-10-20 21:50:00,8605, You were recently banned from Float Fishing.net for similar outbursts. I blocked you from PM'ing me on OFC last spring because of your threats and Bull.  As you stated to me on Float Fishing.net you are the problem and you are not welcome here.  Take your own advice and get lost.
394888,aniceguy,2009-10-20 22:35:00,1094," River rat was banned from Float fishing.net  wonder why??  Having anyone fish the reserve without a liscence is irresponsible and puts us anglers wishing to fish the reserve in a potentially tough spot, having seen some of the local's with the bandana's and shot guns running amuck I wouldnt want to have one decide to spot check me because someone recently was arrested for fishing the reserve without a liscence especially a fellow canadian. Never mind a post about drop backs on a river that if you reconize the water you ve been there already the fact you fished with a ""dude"" without a liscence puts us all at risk.  I have been in the same situation many times there and had someone who couldnt purchase a liscense for what ever the reason the seneca sells out of them, but the city hall which is open 6 days a week always has them in stock  In the end I did the responsible thing and fished NY water legally I would never put myself my companion, or any other angler in a position that liscence checks increased and kids on atv's with bandana's and shot guns can now train it on me and say"" show me your liscence""  90,000 fish can sustain a bit of pressure and that river has sooooo much water where you can fish pools and not see a person but my family cant replace me with a 12 guage hole in my chest because some kid decided to random check me....guess what any resident of the reservation can do just that  I know this will lead to some convoluded war or words also but it had to be said....it was a good thread too....  Completely irresponsible to accompany someone fishing illegally thats no different then a poacher or worse"

I took myself off that board because of guys just like you jumping all over any little thing I posted, just like now.....call JC and ask him. I was at his place on Saturday laughing about it. It was 100% my decision to leave.  Louis, what the heck are you doing in this post...seems like solo can handle himself, no need for you to gang up on me is there ? if a guy drives 3.5 hours and can't get a licene and decides to fish anyway, what does that have to do with me ?  ""the fact you fished with a ""dude"" without a liscence puts us all at risk"".....good god man, could you try any harder to find something bad to say about me ? LOL  by the way, I don't have any issues with ""the local's with the bandana's and shot guns running amuck ""......nice stereotype bud. I'm only 1/8th native Canadian but dam proud of it. Save your racial profilling banter for the local Mississauga KKK meetings ""dude""  Anyway,... anyone who has fished the catt in the last 5 years knows exactly what I'm talking about. and who I'm talking about simply doesn't matter.....it's best to keep pics that identify the exact location a current run off public sites. Unless anyone can tell me what ""good"" it does for the fishery  ? I'm all ears. Louis, you keep saying you are working to save our fishery....what did you write in this thread that would help you get to that goal ?  I remember back a few years ago when someone did the same kind of post about skein fishing in a certain harbor that a guy took him to for the first time.....that place is now destroyed, there  were 30 guys slit fish eveywhere last three years.....the land owner had enough and shut it down. access is by boat only now. Same place, guy posted a great day winter steelhead fishing with pics .....blammo, next weekend 100 holes and blood and guts everywhere.  Hey wallaco, mortallity rate is around 10% with the best C&R practices. When 20 guys hit and average of 10 fish per day, stats say 20 will die. When 80 guys hit an average of 6 fish each per day.....the number of dead fish more than doubles. I would say the traffic is at least 4 times what it was prior to the internet glory posts....at least IMO that's what I have seen.  just think about it is all I ask, and lighten up there Mike and Louis.
