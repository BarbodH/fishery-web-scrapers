394127,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-18 17:42:00,0,i think there's a charter out of batchewana area.
394130,redneck666,2009-10-18 17:55:00,563,"well, i seen redwood charters one day in the phone book but i dont know where they are or if their still around."
394131,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-18 18:00:00,0,"i'd recommend a pair of waders, and a day out of the river with a guide.  that would open up all sorts of year round fishing opportunity for you."
394268,redneck666,2009-10-19 03:17:00,563,"well... do you feel like guiding me? haha. just kiddin, but have you heard of redwood charters?"
394329,anders,2009-10-19 14:21:00,1168,"I have been with redwood before...(I won the trip)  they were real good...cought lots of chinnies, and a pike...we were fishing the garden though...they did givbe me the option of what i wanted to go for."
394337,troutologist,2009-10-19 14:30:00,951,"John Giuliani guides on the river for steelhead, atlantics, walleye and pacific salmon. He's in the phonebook. About the best guy for salmonids in the st marys.  A few other guys come up from the states during various salmon runs, Brad Patzke (sp?) is one who has good reviews.   Chris McMillian guides also walleye in the river.  I believe I directed you here before, bottom of the page"
