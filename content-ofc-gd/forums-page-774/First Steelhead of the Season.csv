394152,chandru,2009-10-18 20:16:00,63,wow nice one! on a pink worm eh? i find using a fly rod for worms works really well it really lets the worm fall naturally. good catch!

394341,MJL,2009-10-19 14:40:00,2427,Well done Tibbs.  Congrats on a fine catch
394569,StoneFly,2009-10-20 00:39:00,574,"Tibbs, one thing I was wondering about....that water you were fishing seems like flat glass with very little current,...not the typical Steelhead water I would be used to....so Im wondering is there faster water near by?  an extremely deep hole ?  or was it sortof a fluke with cruising steelhead going to their next pool to rest?  Im not saying anything deragotory in the least, just curious...cheers"
394575,tibbs,2009-10-20 00:49:00,650,"Yep, that was the water i was fishing. It must have been around 6-7' deep and was one of the few pools that i couldn't see bottom. I had to use a small float to get it moving since the current was so slow."
394576,splashhopper,2009-10-20 00:55:00,2931,"nice fish,,, i like the small pink trout worms.... but that one almost looks like a Senko 5"" ?"
394579,tibbs,2009-10-20 01:02:00,650," Thanks.  I was using a Riverwood pinkworm. They are a lot thicker then the berkley ones but, it's the same length. (3"")"
