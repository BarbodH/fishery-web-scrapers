Truth is i dont know what to believe anymore, i just wanted to share that i was there this past week. It was how i expected it to feel. In a word.....eerie.    To stand there where this atrocious event happened and just feel that day rush back into me as i stood so close and imagined what this may have looked like around me had i been there that day....i just kinda sat there and soaked in my surroundings and what  i had only seen on television or my computer before this day. 8 years later and it is still fenced in and surrounded by cranes. I cant imagine what it must be like to walk past this everyday on your way to work.  "

Seems like a regular construction site now. If you never knew what happened you would think it's just an ordinary spot.
