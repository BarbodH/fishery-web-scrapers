394743,tilly,2009-10-20 14:07:00,32,Heading up to a friends cottage this weekend and I'm just wondering if I'll be able to find some pickerel on the Severn between Sparrow and Lake Couchiching?
394747,NAW,2009-10-20 14:16:00,4022,I've fished that stretch looking for them before.  No luck for me..  That was in the spring.  I've heard from a few people that they are there though.  Good luck.. Let us know if you get anything..
394748,basskicker09,2009-10-20 14:21:00,144,i had a teacher that has a cottage up there and thats all he fished for and seemed to do pretty well
394952,Rob,2009-10-21 01:33:00,467,Find where there is fast flowing water(be careful) and troll where there are narrows. Also fish at the bottom of narrows with minnows near drop offs and you should do alright. Evenings and early mornings are best.  Good Luck  Rob C
