A couple questions,  1) Does it blow out real easy or is it pretty stable? 2) What kind of access do I have? 3) If anyone has any general access points (I'm not looking for your fishin holes, I'd much rather find my own) it would be a great help...pm me if you like.  I hate asking because the ""do your own legwork"" response is a good one, but fact is I have an hour and a half drive just to get out there and with my limited student gas budget I would really rather not drive around for 3 hours trying to find an access point  Thanks guys  Kemper"

394876,Musky or Specks,2009-10-20 21:47:00,2710,The Notty beat me up for a while too but I concentrated on learning it and it was well worth it. Always has fish. Maitland depends a lot on water levels. Caledonia is an excellent place to start on the Grand.
