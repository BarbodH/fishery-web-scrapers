These Ministries can shut down the developement and heavy fines can and probably will be leveled against the developer. If Buffer zones were ignored the adjacent property owner may be in position to form a lawsuit. Your colalition should really consult with a lawyer if violations your describing are occuring."
394371,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-19 16:24:00,0,this subject reminded me of a song!  what would you do if G.E. Smith tried to move in next door to you?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv89ZH6XfVE
394380,troutologist,2009-10-19 17:04:00,951,"The fact you claim that a wetland was bulldozed and filled is suspcious. There would need to be site visits and inventories. Not to mentioned the red tape that goes along with the new Species at Risk Legislation. This usually precludes the development of wetlands.  There will need to be very publicly available documentation that the MNR, MOE and local conservation authority (if there is one_ has checked this out and provided the appropriate permits. These are all public documents.  Ask for these if you suspect wrong doing. Though it does happen I would be very shocked if a developer (in a controversial case nonetheless) ignored the permits."
394390,Lake Ranger,2009-10-19 17:34:00,70,"THANK YOU!! This is what I need to hear! My claims are absolutely true, as I called the Ministries to see if there was any permit issued, or a study conducted. Negative on both accounts. The representative in our area has advised that he personally should have been contacted prior to the construction and dozing through the wetlands. A couple of biologists did come to the site after the marsh was filled in, but failed to report any sightings of SAR on the day they came. I feel that had they had time and were actually notified to inspect the property prior to any development, things would be different. What recourse do I have other than finding one of these animals myself? I have seen Least Bitterns and Blanding Turtles in this marsh, but have no proof at this time. I'll make a point of taking my camera for the future. Thank you once again!"
394436,troutologist,2009-10-19 19:22:00,951,"MNR has a sightings database of SAR. Usually if SAR are known to inhabit watercourses connected and within a certain distance of the area in question a full scale assessment is required.  It seems as though a permit was issued if stipulations were discussed re buffer zone. Wherever this permit was from, there should have been contact with the township or planning board and the MNR/MOE/CA in the area."
394449,canadadude,2009-10-19 19:41:00,769,"I know it's late but the S.A.R card should have been played at the planning stage of the development, if evidence of a S.A.R would have been given at this stage the developement would have been stopped in it's tracks. Studies would have had to be conducted and no development would continue untill a viable alternative to protect such species was in place. It may to late at this particular time in the development."
394450,fishermccann,2009-10-19 19:42:00,655,Sorry but I have to  agree.
394470,Lake Ranger,2009-10-19 20:24:00,70,"Thanks to all who have some substantial and sound advice. All our letters of concern for the S.A.R. directed to the Municipality seemed to be of little concern at first. We wer pratically laughed at. We finally hired a planner who knows political lingo and jargon to speak on our behalf, who happens to work very closely with the Ministries. During our meetings with City Council, it was determined that the studies by appropriate Ministries were to be conducted PRIOR to any development to determine the natural values of the land and S.A.R. I also had letters and direction from a local author from the West Nipissing Naturalist Club on how to present our arguements concerning the S.A.R.  With all our opposition and facts and research and everything we presented to council to prove that this area was in fact the WRONG place for such a development, we managed to have restrictions incorporated into the zoning amendment and began to feel somewhat satisfied, as we figured the Ministries would discover that this was indeed a marsh that needed protection. So, with this, plus all the other restrictions put in place for the special zoning of this property, we decided collectively as a group to not appeal Council's decision to pass the application. Since the day it was approved, there has been NO permits applied for or granted by any of the Ministries that were to be contacted. I personally have been in correspondence with the representatives of the area and it seems that the developers and the city were able to somehow re-word the amendments or overlook or sidestep or turn a blind eye to what is actually been happening. So. Now what? I am now taking the advice of a number of members of this forum and seeking legal advice. I am also submitting our facts and photographs and documentation, including the zoning restrictions to the media. I am also giving the planning department time to reply to my letters addressing the fact that the violations have occurred, and if I get no reply, we will hire a lawyer to sue the developers and the City. We trusted the City to do their job to keep this in check. We've been lied to, and the developer was supposed to get a survey to establish a buffer zone BEFORE dozing down the trees. Not AFTER. After asking a rep at the city why this happened, they told me that the developer was waiting until they could AFFORD a suryvey. OOPS! Caught'cha! Wait for it, watch for it, this is going to be on CBC soon enough. This is not a NIMBY thing. Maybe in the beginning it all touched us emotionally, as we knew this place would never be the same with this type of development. There's no way I can say I wasnt' upset or angry. Basically, we were stunned that this development would even be a consideration, given the type of land, the size of the lot and the size of the lake. However, I am genuinely concerned, for the wildife, the fish, the forest, the marsh, you name it.  We've tryed to play the game right, of course made some mistakes along the way, but we're learning and once I (we) stop this development, we'll know the appropriate procedures on how to prevent the next one."

394060,Lake Ranger,2009-10-18 13:33:00,70,"Hi, I'm new to this site, but thought there might be someone out there who's had some experience with what I'm dealing with. I own 220 acres of land in a very remote and rural community in West Nipissing, near the French River area. There has been an ongoing dispute in our neighbourhood about a trailer park development on our small lake. Sadly, the developers got their plan passed, however, with restrictions. The intention is to develop an RV park on 25 acres of land with only 300 feet of lake frontage on a very small lake. One of the by-law restrictions put in place by the City required the developers to establish a buffer zone of 65 feet of natural forest vegetation on each side of their property lines as a visual and sound barrier for adjacent properties that was to REMAIN forested and not removed. As soon as the developers received the approvals from the City, they brought in bulldozer, dozed through a large wetland, destroying the habitat of many animals and birds and continued to doze down the trees in the 'buffer zones'. They dozed right up to adjacent properties, knocking down and destroying all trees, vegetation, anything in their path. Originally, we did not appeal the City's decision to allow the development, since we believed the restrictions would be honoured. As well, another restriction that was ignored was the fact that the Ministries were to be informed of the development prior to any work being done so they could study the property and assess the natural values of the land and marsh. This never happened. Our complaints resulted in an inspector from the City coming to the property only to determine there were no violations. Of course, they would have no clue as to where the property lines were, nor would they know about the marsh that was now filled in. We were shocked to learn of this result and once again called the city to inform them of the violations. Now the city has said that the developers will have to get a survey done to establish the 65 feet buffer zone. Wasn't that the whole idea in the first place? To 'establish' and maintain the buffer zone that was to remain forested? It will take another 50 years for a forest to return to the damaged areas, if at all!  The City refused to admit they've made a mistake and will not acknowledge our concerns. The developers have broken a their contract, violated by-laws, destroyed the forest and the marsh and without the support of the Municipality we do not know what course to take to have this development stopped and their commercial zoning pulled. Is there anybody out there who has insight as to what we can do to stop this development for the sake of the forest, the wildife, the land and the lake before it's too late? Thanks to all or anyone who can help. Here's a more recent website which will be updated soon describing all the violations, including photographs of the destroyed buffer zones. http://www.marshallsland.com "

So, is this your lake or is it on crown land?  5.   THought of hiring some tree huggers?  6.   Sounds like the developers went through all the right channels. Sucks doesn't it?  7.

394072,Lake Ranger,2009-10-18 14:18:00,70,"Hi, I guess I use the term ""our lake"", as it is where we live. and we know the lake better than anyone sitting at a desk at City Council. No, it is not contained on my acerage, but I do own land on both sides of the lake. Privately owned properties back onto one side of the lake and most of the other side is crown land. Our concern is the lake is landlocked, and excessvie boat traffic and fishing will definately have a negative impact on the lake and the fish. There is no stocking of fish in this lake. The shore where the developers plan on having a boat launch is a breeding and feeding area for pike. The lake is mostly 'marsh' and actually is a river, not a lake. There are approximately 12 families that own property and water frontage, and of those families, only 4 or 5 have a small fishing motor boat.  The soil is only a couple of feet deep and then solid bedrock. The water table on the land is high. The concerns for the environment and the impact this development will have on a small, narrow, shallow body of water seem to be of no concern to anyone who doesn't actually live there. I really need some solid advice on how to get this issue noticed, for the sake of this lake, and other small lakes in our beautiful province."
394078,ch312,2009-10-18 14:43:00,1590,"its quite sad, but $$$ comes before nature and the concerns of local residents. the developer likely planned to take everything down to the property lines to make it easier to build on these buffer zones in the future. when they go to get permits to build where these buffer zones were the city will likely approve as there is nothing there now anyways. they will likely make more money by trashing these buffer zones now even with stiff fines.  say goodbye to your peaceful lake..  :(  :angry:"
394105,Billy Bob,2009-10-18 16:38:00,5865,IF you want to control the whole lake you need to own all the land that surrounds the lake.......I don't like others telling me what I can and cannot do on my property.
394109,Lake Ranger,2009-10-18 16:55:00,70,"Hi CH312, thank you for your comment about the trailer park development issue. What you mentioned makes complete sense to me now, and I guess it's time to take this to the media again. I guess it's the stubborness or the passion in me, but I'm not ready to give up. It's a few of us against the government and the developers and yes, the almighty dollar, but we pay taxes on that land too, and have a right to fight. I really appreciate your comment, it does sound like you actually care about things like this. A few other comments were to me a bit harsh, but this is my issue and I have to deal with it. I hope that I can continue to fight it, with the support of the residents, property owners and frequent campers to the lake who also enjoy the peace and serenity of this location. The other residents and myself have allowed and welcomed respectful and seasonal campers who also know and visit the lake to enjoy the peace and serentiy and privacy of our lands, but now, due to an increased population of strangers to the area, we wil all have to post No Trespassing signs and Private Property signs down the lake and along our property lines for insurance purposes. It is very sad that it has come to this. Certain members of the West Nipissing Municipality are definately not getting my vote. What the heck are there by-laws for anyway? Thanks again, and have a great day, Lake Ranger"

I would like to also thank Rick for his suggestions and all who agree. I would like to comment on the following post. I agree that a new member is quite bold to look for support, however, I'm actually looking for advice on how to handle the situation properly so that the developers do respect the restrictions put in place and do not continue to violate them. I don't believe this is a NIMBY situation at all. I believe that someone is not obeying or respecting the rules that were put in place to protect the land, the lake, the wildlife and the surrounding residents and propeties of this rural neighbourhood.  Before this one gets too far out of hand and locked... are your facts actually factual and correct? YES, INDEED. We have proof with photos and surveys of the immediate adjacent properties. The hair raises a tad on my back when I see a brand new member graveling for support. I understand. I have been searching for a sight that has a forum where people who hunt and fish have respect for the system and why there are rules to protect wildlife and fish and their habitat. I already see error in your stated land mass vs the ""save the lake"" websites numbers. Please specify and I will clarify if there has been an error. Do you have pictures outlining property lines to physically show they have gone against the agreed municipal guidelines. YES! We have photographs, surveys, we have found the surveyor stakes at the property lines, and have obtained copies of the zoning by-law restrictions for this particular development. If you say they indeed needed MOE studies etc before proceeding very few would fire up a dozer. That's what blows our minds.

The old ...we have our paradise, now that we've cut down the trees to build our place, and how dare anyone else come and do the same syndrome I'm from a town close to Wawa. I purchased this property 20 years ago, because of the rural way of life in the area. Most of the properties in this area are approximately 100 acres as it was homesteaded centuries ago. Sadly, new comers bought a 100 acre lot, severed their property in thirds and sold the parcels. One parcel was sold to a family looking forward to living in a quiet rural community. The other was sold shortly thereafter to the developer who plans on shoving 35+ families in RV's and campers on an area of land less than 25 acres, if the buffer zones are respected. (Which of course are now bulldozed down).  The third parcel was lastly purchased by an existing land owner on the lake after this dispute errupted to prevent it from also being destroyed and developed.  I appreciate your scepticism, but we are truly concerned and will continue to fight this until we find a resolution. If a developer decides to break one or two or three by-laws all while in the initial stages of the development, what will we be up against once (and if) their facility is up and running? A whole new set of problems and Bull, that's for sure."

Look for a reporter who tends to lean towards conservation. Shake some trees, ruffle some feathers, but do NOT ever use hyperbole or emotion to try and win your argument. Use facts and the law. Just because you were there first doesn't mean you get to keep the place the way it was forever. But, just because someone has money to toss around doesn't mean they don't have to follow the same rules the rest of us do (unless they are politicians, of course..lol) Compliance is the best you can hope for.. it just is no longer possible to stop development. All municipalities were required to comply with Smart Growth plans set out a few years ago."

394179,cram,2009-10-18 23:38:00,1733,"I can't believe the attitude of some of the people on this site.  The guy said they did NOT oppose the plans when they were set up with a buffer zone.  They did not oppose new families (or whoever) enjoying the lake.  He says they opposed the development now that they bulldozed the existing buffer zones (good point that they could put in new ones...nice sidestep by them) and knocked down wetland that was supposed to go under an impact assessment first.  What in the world is wrong with that?  As for what to do --  I'd look to use the media (the only thing that will matter to the city, vs. development dollars).   Just be sure you do so in a credible way....if you come off as a tree hugger, you won't get far.  If you're a local taxpayer who is a good citizen on the lake and a the story is about a developer  who is sidestepping rules and the city doesn't care because of the dollars involved.....that's a different story that may get some momentum behind it.  Also talk to the appropriate ministry officials about the environmental impact assessments - ask for copies of what was done.  I don't know specifics of the process but assume they are less motivated by local development than the city might be.  There are also lawyers who specialize in this stuff -- there was one who stopped a logging truck route  development in the town where our cottage is."

394213,Lake Ranger,2009-10-19 00:39:00,70,"Hi, thanks for all your input. I'm getting alot of great ideas, and yes, I know the website is outdated and comes across as treehuggers looking for sympathy.  It was posted long before any of the violations actually happened, long before the plan was approved. The reason the community did NOT appeal the decision was because of our opposition to the original proposal. With all the residents showing up at the meetings, describing the actual topology of the land, the lake, etc, the possible impact to the marsh, habitat, forest, etc, we figured that the restrictions put in place BY THE MUNICIPALITY would be honoured and therefore chose not to appeal. There's been corruption from the get go. I wish I had a video tape of all the City Council meetings where some of the members couldn't wait to go home and watch the hockey game rather than discuss the possible impacts this development could have on this lake. I think there was only one maybe two members who actually listened to us and understood why we were so against this proposal in the first place. Good advice to update it and start the fight over where we are now. Cheers! Great Forum, by the way, glad I joined!  Our more recent site.. http://www.marshallsland.com"
