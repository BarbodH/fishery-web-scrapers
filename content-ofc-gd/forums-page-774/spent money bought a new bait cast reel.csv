394808,skinny,2009-10-20 18:15:00,442,Well I bought me a new reel I hope it works well for me . it fit nice in my hand and felt good it's a Quantum ct101Hpt   Catalyst LH  now just need to load it up and get to the backyard practice. need to finish up a bunch of school stuff (anyone want to build a ladder logic diagram) then i can play
394843,BUSTER,2009-10-20 20:32:00,1336,Load it up with some 50lb power pro and start casting !! v  nice reel
394851,skinny,2009-10-20 20:49:00,442,ok took a break from my school project and mid term study and spooled up some 15lb line I had. (had to play) tossed it a bunch of times with a casting plug and it's wayyyyyyyyy better than the old unit I had/have. want to get the feel for it then I will get some braid for it. but that will be a whole new learning curve.I have noticed my casts seem to go high up (over wires in back yard before getting in corn field) not straight out i have also noticed that I'm real bad at the cast going to my left this is mainly side arm stuff
