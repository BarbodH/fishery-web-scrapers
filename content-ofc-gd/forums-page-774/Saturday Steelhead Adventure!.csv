394784,ccmtcanada,2009-10-20 17:01:00,7971,"Well, the start of steelhead season for me started out on a great note!  I got in touch with Solopaddler and as luck had it, he was headed out last Saturday with a few others to go after these amazing fish!  I was up at 230am Saturday morning...out the door by 3 and pulled into his driveway around 430.  We hopped in his car and headed to meet up with fellow OFNers BillM and Wallacio.  Shortly after the sun came up, we were drifting the river...things were a little quiet to start out...but a few small ones came out early.   The river wasn't prime...it actually got muddier as the day went but we all managed to catch some nice fish.  We all headed off to river number two hoping to find some better conditions.  As it turned out, it was the right move...conditions were much better and more fish were caught.  I dont have pics from Wallacio or BillM, so I'll be only showing a few here...post em if you got em guys!  A few nice ones from Solopaddler....     And I managed a few nice sized ones as well...     After some ribbing by some board members (Sinker...he specifically pointed you out here), about the classic Solo pose...he has decided that the new look for this fall is this....  First, let me refresh your memory....here's the classic pose...     And the same two fish in the new pose...      Hmmm...not too sure about that one Solo....LOL.  As always, I had a great time fishing with Solopaddler and Bill...and it was great to meet you Wallacio...hope we can all do it again sometime!"
394787,GBW,2009-10-20 17:07:00,8460,nice report and pic's Cliff.  I was going to guess the new pose was going to look more like a Stanley Cup pose... http://fotosa.ru/stock_photo/Zefa%20RF/p_2418288.jpg
394789,okumasheffield,2009-10-20 17:14:00,318,Let the season begin!
394790,perchslayer666,2009-10-20 17:15:00,280,That new fish pose is hilarious. Looks like Solo is about to breastfeed the bow.
394796,highdrifter,2009-10-20 17:34:00,2534,"Nice chunkers dudes!!  That water looks absolutely prime...  Solo, what stick were you using??  cheers HD"
394797,capt bruce,2009-10-20 17:36:00,820,Not sure about the new pose looks good and steels do have smalleish (is that a word) teeth but with no lips ???? Looks like a good day spent with good people  = fun fun fun ..
394809,corvette1,2009-10-20 18:31:00,1765,awesome day of steel congrats
394816,BillM,2009-10-20 18:43:00,17367,"Cliff, always a pleasure man!!!  To bad I dropped a nice fish before I could get a pic of the damn thing!  lol"
394830,Leecher,2009-10-20 19:28:00,7832,Great report and pics Cliff Looks like you boys spent quality time on the river banks Thanks for sharing Leechman
394848,wallacio,2009-10-20 20:44:00,475,"Great to finally meet you Cliff.   Not a bad day despite the conditions.    Sorry, I didn't bother with any pics that day....as my wife says, how many pictures of fish do you need??? LOL"
394850,BillM,2009-10-20 20:47:00,17367, I don't think your camera had enough zoom anyhow
394864,Greencoachdog,2009-10-20 21:13:00,8163,"Great report and pics Cliff!!!  Do you ever keep any of the smaller fish for the table?.. or are they tainted with pollutants?    Solo... you really should discover the ""vertical"" hold, it would serve you well!"
394878,solopaddler,2009-10-20 21:52:00,8605,"Sinker, if you have any further suggestions for future poses, please let me know"
394880,JohnF,2009-10-20 22:06:00,3494,"My first thought was that the new pose should be called the ""Kicked in the nads"" pose.  Methinks the old one is more becoming - and the fish look bigger.  JF"
394903,Greencoachdog,2009-10-20 23:19:00,8163, Fish look the biggest in the vertical hold... why do you think all the TV show guys do it!??
394904,JohnF,2009-10-20 23:21:00,3494," But none of them look like they've just been ""sacked"".  JF"
394909,Greencoachdog,2009-10-20 23:27:00,8163,"  Did you misplace an ""A"" for a ""U"" in the word ""sacked""... but we weren't talking about Solo's fish, were we?"
