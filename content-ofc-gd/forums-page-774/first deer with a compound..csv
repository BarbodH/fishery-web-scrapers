394266,oxcowboy,2009-10-19 03:11:00,544,"I have always hunted with a crossbow, but decided i wanted to try using a compound this year and got my first doe of the season on saturday evening.  i got her coming in to a soy bean field about 5 o'clock.  i have to say it was quite a rush to take one that way.  one down and five to go(we can harvest up to six)  best of luck to all the hunters and maybe the next time i can show off some antlers.     jason"
394282,Skud,2009-10-19 04:28:00,739,Your son looks quite proud of his Pops. It's a great feeling knowing that you kept yourself together long enough to make a good shot. Very rewarding. Good job
394285,Terry,2009-10-19 09:41:00,14456,nice going
394317,Jay T,2009-10-19 13:17:00,282,"Congrats on your first with a compound bow, that is a nice doe. This weekend brown is going down, I haven't been able to get out much. Good luck with the rest of the season."

394425,Dusky,2009-10-19 18:55:00,310,Nice deer!
394426,Daplumma,2009-10-19 18:56:00,1961,Good stuff Jason.That first bow kill will not be one you will forget.Congrats! Joe
394620,oxcowboy,2009-10-20 02:45:00,544,"thanks guys, i was pretty excited.  nothing like fresh deer steaks, should have her back and wrapped up ready for the freezer by thursday, one of my neibhors has a walk in cooler that i always take them to.  jason"
394703,Dara,2009-10-20 12:32:00,3052,"Nice deal, but why did you bring it home with the guts still in it?"
394706,Fish Farmer,2009-10-20 12:40:00,2234,My thought to.  Nice first just the same. Congrats
394842,oxcowboy,2009-10-20 20:29:00,544,"i understand what your saying, but she was shot about 300 yards off my yard.  i just jumped her up on the back of the quad and brought her over to the garage and got the tractor and boom to raise her up and put the gut pile in a big tub, my parents own about 5 dogs and the organs and such are quite a treat for them.  if i was way off i would have left them, but i have goats near the house and dont want any left overs that might attract coyotes any closer to my goat herd than they already are. hope this makes sense.  jason"
394854,misfish,2009-10-20 20:54:00,29133,Now yer just rubbing it in. Sweet deal.
394860,Dara,2009-10-20 21:04:00,3052,"  perfect sense, TY  and congrats and thanks for posting again...now go get a buck"
394930,richyb,2009-10-21 00:19:00,774,Theres no feeling as good as smoking a deer with a compound. Nice deer !
394931,Rustic-Fisher,2009-10-21 00:23:00,826,Well done  :D RF
394938,Daplumma,2009-10-21 00:46:00,1961,Its funny but I knew the answer before you explained it.I sometimes load mine into the tractor bucket and gut it at the butcher shop just up the road.A gutpile near the house just invites dogs and other stuff.Much cleaner gut job when you hang it and clean it up properly before putting it in the walk in to age. Joe
394954,oxcowboy,2009-10-21 01:39:00,544,"damn joe,  we must be brother's from different mothers, we think way too much alike. deer hunting, goat herder's, nascar junkies and fishing fanatics and buddy's up the road that can cut up deer anytime.  guys  youh ave an open invitation, any OFC member that wants to come down{or up} can hunt my farm any time they want (200 acres).  its in adams county which some of you deer nuts will recognize as deer heaven. amish deer. bout 7 miles from the farm."
394963,Carp,2009-10-21 01:50:00,1488,WOW !!!  Definitely a dream buck.  Congrats on the compound doe.  I use a crossbow as well and have been thinking of trying the compound. We shall see......
394968,Mattones,2009-10-21 01:58:00,587,Awesome doe man!! Congrads!  I am waiting on my first deer could of had a doe on Sunday morning!
