It took about 1.5 hours to find them, but when I did, they were hitting.  They were suspended in open water, just off a steep drop-off that went form 10-15' deep fairly quickly. Heavy football jigs, deep jerkbaits, slowrolled spinnerbaits, and tailspins all failed to produce fish, but a wacky-jigged 4"" senko started producing. The hits were very subtle, making me wonder how many fish I missed before I figured out the ""feel"". 52 degrees and about 15' of visibility.  I had about 7 fish in the next hour, then I had to leave.  These 2 were typical: scrappy 15-16"" fish that pulled like they were twice this size.     This was the biggest - and my best smallie of the year: 20.5 and deep. Gotta love those colours! "
