394066,mercforever,2009-10-18 13:54:00,67,"went to lake st john to slay some hugh smallies,first two hours spent taken the ice out of the guides,6 hrs fishing,notta bite,didnt even see one,not even a perch or sunfish,expected to see millions of dead ones down by the factory after not seeing one for six hours,nothing,a guess they justshut down.talked to guy fishing with minnows ,nothing.surface temp 44 to 48.is this typical for these temps ? anybody experience the same demise????????"
394075,Cudz,2009-10-18 14:21:00,2652,Did the same thing this time last year and came home with a huge skunk as well.  Can't explain.
394084,Greencoachdog,2009-10-18 15:01:00,8163,"At those temps, I would suggest looking for  suspended fish over deep water with your sonar. If that lake is ""turning over"" they will be scattered and suspended."
394095,Roy,2009-10-18 16:09:00,13728,"I suspect that GCD is correct. The fall turnover doesn't last very long before temps stabilize. I think that during these short periods, your best bet is to hit a river system."
394108,irishfield,2009-10-18 16:44:00,26272,  ..or the local Pub!
394118,pike slayer,2009-10-18 17:21:00,1177,or go hunting

394203,Rizzo,2009-10-19 00:24:00,4754, ..which in that area would be the Atherley Arms
394270,Cudz,2009-10-19 03:28:00,2652,Is that still open? Go through Atherly and turn left at the Atherly Arms.  lol
394284,Marc Thorpe,2009-10-19 08:20:00,621,Could it be slight NE winds and very High pressure
394287,spinnerbaitking,2009-10-19 10:31:00,1622,"On the River yesterday 08:30 til 3:45 never saw a smallie, but ended up with 2 Musky myself 24.5"" & 28.5"" plus 1 follow & my buddy got 1 - 23.5"" Richard"
394291,mbac31,2009-10-19 11:00:00,904,You had to go deep. The wind and pressure played a role as well yesterday. Try Jigging spoons around the main lake island next time. Walleye and Bass will not be up near the plant. However try out along the deep weedline that goes from the plant towards the airport. Tough fishing but I managed to boat a few.
394474,mercforever,2009-10-19 20:39:00,67,"is this the end or just the start??do the bass eventually go shallow again?that was brutal fishing saturday,hate to put the  tracker away so early..."
394476,ColdH20guy,2009-10-19 20:42:00,312,we had the same bad luck on Saturday on Sparrow Lake for our classic tourney..12 guys allowed 5 per team...8 fish brought in..brutal! we were moving all over the lake trying different things...all we caught was cold!
