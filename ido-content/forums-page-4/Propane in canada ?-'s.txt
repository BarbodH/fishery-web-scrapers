We’ve crossed in the summer with 2 – 30 pound tanks for summer cabin use and they never gave them second glance or asked about them. Be aware that in my experience the Canadians are super anal about the tank expiration dates and won’t fill anything that’s out of proof. Around here they don’t even give the proof stamp a glance, but up there they look at every tank, every time, every place that I’ve had propane filled. Grouse

No limit on propane. Make sure your tanks are valid.

Ditto on the valve expiration date on your P tanks. They wont fill expired ones Good rule of thumb – if you can justify the quantity for the duration of your stay, you’ll be fine. It would be hard to justify two 100lbs tanks in the middle of July.. just an example that would raise some eyebrows
