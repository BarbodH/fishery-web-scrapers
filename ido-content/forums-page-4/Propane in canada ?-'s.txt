Anyone hve any info as far as how much propane a guy can bring into canada?

We’ve crossed in the summer with 2 – 30 pound tanks for summer cabin use and they never gave them second glance or asked about them. 

No limit on propane. Make sure your tanks are valid. 

I’M canadian and I confirm the info… I tried to sneak an old 10 pounder … got caught and got reimbursed. They always check.

Ditto on the valve expiration date on your P tanks. They wont fill expired ones
