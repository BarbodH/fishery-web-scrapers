Anybody ever fish Lake Despair just northwest of Rainy? Never been there and trying to figure out what to take for gear.
Any help would be appreciated.

I’ve fished it every year for the past 15 years during mid-late sept. Generally the numbers come from jigs, but we catch our bigger fish with lead core or deep diving raps. Lindys and spinner will put some fish in the boat too, but generally we do best with jigs.

Lake Despair! I haven’t thought about that lake in a long time.

I fished the smallmouth tournament ran by Bill and Nelly Goodin from Lake Despair lodge 10 plus years ago. Very good smallmouth lake, lots of action on topwater baits. I would bring some along for an early morning or late evening bite to change things up from walleye fishing. Any topwater bait worked.
Very fun lake system to fish. Have fun

Thanks guys. We were going to head up Saturday. Relative that invited me decided not to go now. I got my hopes up for nothing.
