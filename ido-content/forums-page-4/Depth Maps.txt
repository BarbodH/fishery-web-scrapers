Hey guys, 

Just a thought, but Navionics might have it on their App if you buy the Canada version.

Yeah, it has a few, and that’s what I did last year. It had Clearwater West on there, but it was extremely inaccurate, and when you zoomed in on the lakes, White Otter disappears. Just wasn’t sure if there was anything else out there. Ideally going there with a autochart lakemaster chip would be the best. But haven’t been able to make it up there in the summer yet. 

This is the best site you’ll find for Ontario lakes… no contours but great detail…
