Made it up to Nipigon for some October trophy fishing. Not a lot of fish but QUALITY!! Finally broke the 30# mark. 48inch 31.5 pounds. And it’s still swimming!!! And got to do it with my dad in the boat! He got a nice 42 inches too. In his 70s he doesn’t have many trips left in him. So glad we got to do it. Big fish were on off shore reefs and sunken islands. Shore structure and weeds had fish but small. If you think your to old or to busy to do a Canada fishing trip stop thinking and Do It! Oh and… It’s still swimming!

Awesome fish! Congratulations. Would you be willing to share anymore info. (depths, baits, etc)? I know it’s huge water, so it’s a tough nut to crack!

Shady if you don’t want to be able to sleep tonight go over to Walleye Central. A guy named Moosebunk just did a BIG write up with photos on Nipigon.It was a fun read. Look back around a week, you should find it. Shady, I just saw it on the top of the Canada page.

Thanks Dutchboy. I landed a 41″ pike this year and kind of got the bug. A 48″ is a whole different class of fish!!

Thanks Dutchboy, neat read. Nipigon looks like an intriguing place, but not one for the faint-hearted!

No, but as long as you have a decent size boat and reliable motor you should be OK. It’s no different then fishing the shield lakes of Northern Minnesota or LOTW, if you don’t know where you are slow down! I know James has stayed at Pasha a couple of times up there. I don’t know where that is in relationship to where Moosebunk was fishing. Won’t take many more stories like that one to get me headed that way! Big Pike get into your system when you stick a big one. My best is only 42″ so there is definately room for improvement.

Time of year dictates location. I always do well in summer and fall off shore and spring neer shore and in river mouths. Most economical stay is Pasha best is on the lake in one of the large boats that will tow your boat but very expensive.You can always get fish on spoons but most of my large fish come on natural color minnow baits. (Smelt) Very good Walleye, Lake and Brook trout fishing also. IMG_20161018_214714.jpg IMG_20150701_183200209_HDR.jpg IMG_20160623_123519351.jpg IMG_20161009_232730.jpg

The best is to stay on the islands nest to the fishing grounds. If you go to the MNR building in the town of Nipigon they have a map on the wall with camps on the islands marked. We go for Specs starting at the end of May through July first, than Lakers for two weeks up to the derby, Pike are from the smelt die off until the fourth of July. Bigger but fewer Lakers in August. I only bird hunt there in the fall but I am sure there are hogs around.
