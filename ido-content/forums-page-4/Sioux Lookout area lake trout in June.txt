I am head to Frog Rapids Camp on minitaki lake on June 2nd. I am looking for some info on lake trout fishing. I have been to this camp many times and do very well walleye/pike fishing but this year we want to take a day or two and chase some lakers. This body of water has many connecting lakes so im looking for higher percentage lakes and water temp vs depth. Thank you in advance for the info!

Check out Lyons Bay. We usually do good right inside the opening from the big lake.
