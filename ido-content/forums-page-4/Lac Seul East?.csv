The fish were scattered from in 4 to 25 FOW. Spinners and rigs worked well in deeper water, with a jig with plastic or minnow in the shallows. We had plenty of eaters for shore lunch and some nice 18 to 26 fish to CPR."

We just got back and fished Spruce River Island to Pine Island on 7/17 – 7/22 staying at Mahkwa Lodge. We encountered great fishing weather, very rarely did water temps get over 71* and most of the time were in the upper 60’s. Fishing was best in depths of 16′ to 24′ or so. Fish were caught on jig and minnow combos. We did run Kalins on jigs to bulk up the package and tipped with a minnow, which caught bigger fish, but we were getting out fished by our trip partners who were simply using a jig and minnow. Biggest fish were a pair of 28″ and 28.25″ an hour apart the last day on an east wind. Almost any structure which had wind on it we were able to find fish and put them in the boat. We did break out three ways and ran minnow plugs on the worst day, which featured no wind and was pretty blue sky-ish. We did manage some fish that way as well. Mark"
