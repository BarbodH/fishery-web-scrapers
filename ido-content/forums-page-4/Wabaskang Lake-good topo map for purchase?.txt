I’m trying to help a fellow IDO’er (dbrode) out for his trip to Wabaskang coming up. I once bought a large waterproof map online for this lake, but can no longer find the map OR the website I bought it from. Anybody got a good link to share for a map of this lake available for purchase? If so, post it here or message  @dbrode. Thanks!
