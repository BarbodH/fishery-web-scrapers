 Any reports available? Water temps,what on and how deep.

bob58:

 Fished 6-23/25-2017, bad weather first two days( rain & thunder) wind the third day. Fishing was not bad considering the weather and water temp. of 62 degrees.
The fish were scattered from in 4 to 25 FOW.
Spinners and rigs worked well in deeper water, with a jig with plastic or minnow in the shallows.
We had plenty of eaters for shore lunch and some nice 18 to 26 fish to CPR.

Bob, how far east were you??? Further than Chamberlain Narrows???
