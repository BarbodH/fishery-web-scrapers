It was a glorious Friday this June 3rd 2016. I was surrounded by good friends and family when i set the hook in to this back breaking lard filled toad. It took a short 41 years, 5 months and 19 days to land a trophy 30″ walleye (jigging no less). This one stretched the tape to 31 and 1/4.

tape pic… whooa!!!!

Forgot to mention – Ma-goose walleye came as a courtesy of none other than the trophy walleye factory, Onaman Lake. That dang water body never ceases to amaze!!!

Father and son celebrate

Very cool

Nice fish, congrats. I’ll bet the long wait time to catch that big one was worth it.

Holy WOW! What a BEAST!

Onaman Lake in NW Ontario

Congrats on the hog!!! Sweet pics too.

Awesome fish, hope to join you some day!

Congrats what a beast!  

Great Lake. We fished there as a group of 6 last year for a week. Our largest was 30 inches and we had 45 walleye over 25 inches with 6 – 28 inches or over.
