We are heading up to Sabaskong Bay, LOTWs in two weeks. We have been up in June several years and have done well. At what water temp do they move off the humps in the fall? What types of structure should we be looking at?

Theyâ€™ll still be on the humps in September, no problem. We fish the humps in mid October in Sabaskong.
