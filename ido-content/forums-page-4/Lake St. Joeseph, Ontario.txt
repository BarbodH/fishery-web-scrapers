We had the opportunity to fish Lake St Joe one day this week for some exceptional Walleye fishing. Since a non-resident tag is required to fish it we were lucky enough to secure tags with one of 4 camps on the 80 mile long lake. A guide was also in order considering the danger navigating a mine field of shallow underwater rocks and also the distance we traveled over open water.

Iâ€™ve been there 3 different times, all for 4-5 day family trips at the old post lodge. I 100% agree this is an awesome lake to fish. Great walleye numbers, and also lots of 35-44 inch pike too. I would tend to think this lake really stands out in terms of numbers and quality (with the exception of not a ton of pig walleye) for a Canadian lake that is not a fly in.

Very cool and looks like a lot of fun! Congrats!

Can you imagine that being a benchmark at ten years old? Great report and pics!
