The view from the living room Tomahawk Resort, LOTW. 

That looks pretty nice and no thinking!     

Looks relaxing. 

Cool dutchy! You spelled therapy wrong though.  

Just for you professor.

I like theropy. It puts the He in Trophy.  

Tomahawk is a nice place. Are you fishing muskies up there? Say ‘hi’ to Kevin and Scott for me!
