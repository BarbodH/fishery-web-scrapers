A friend of mine purchased a lot on Berry Lake in Ontario (near Sioux Narrows). Anyone fished there?

Yes I have a couple times, on the north end of the lake. My parents have a cabin between Berry and Dry Berry lake. Its has been a few years since I have been up there. A lot of structure! Walleyes, big northerns and big smallies. 

Years and years ago I did. Both Berry and Dryberry. Huge pike in the latter. We were always there before the regular season opened…bear hunting. We looked for some lake trout action when we weren’t hunting and found enough open water a couple years to troll with the canoe. We did manage a couple trout on one trip, Berry if I remember right. 

I have a college buddy who has a place up there. only been up there once but its a pretty cool lake. Fishing was good and the scenery is even better. Just love how quiet it up there. 

Color me jealous! If I had access to that location, I’d be up there every chance I got. Do you have boat access to both lakes? Ever been up in the winter?

What is the difference in the two lakes and what is the winter fishing like?

My uncle has a cabin up on berry and i go up there and fish both lakes about once a year and it is really good fishing 

Completely different lakes.
