Guys,

If you are headed to Clearwater west Lodge you have a unique experience ahead. The ministry website has specific information on the particular body of water you will be fishing. Most are not catch and release and zone 5 covers Clearwater. I’ve fished this area 13 yrs and its a hidden gem. Sorry, white otter lake is closed until 6/14/17. But plenty of other lakes to fish.

Thanks Mark, In my deep dive of the ministry website I can’t find to much on Clearwater West. Maybe I’m looking in the wrong place? 

Clearwater Lake not part of the Quetico Park..so its “not a barbless hook” lake.

I assumed you found this site:
