Do any of you know any guides for lake trout and brook trout for lake Nipigon. Looking for any info. Limited results online. Thanks

Call Chad at Pasha Lake Cabins. Both he and his guides spend a lot of time guiding out on Nipigon.

Thanks James,

I plan to be up to Pasha / Nipigon at the end of September chasing giant pike and lakers myself. It is a special place indeed!

Here is a guide I have personally used and would recommend. When we went with him we camped on the upper Nipigon River and it was a blast. We even camped less than a mile where the world record Brook trout was caught 100 years ago (Rabbit Rapids). Not sure if Barry still does the camping though. He has been fishing the Nipigon River a long time and really knows the river too. He only specializes in Nipigon River Brook Trout. Not sure he does Lake Trout in the big lake. Personally, if I was going to fish Brook trout up there I would fish them in the river vs. the Lake Nipigon. But thatâ€™s just me. You can also fish for Coasters in lake Superior as well.
