Less then 3 weeks before we go. Anybody have any info they would be willing to share? Pike, Walleye, Muskie are on the menu for this trip. Trolling for Muskie & Pike will be the main presentation along with a bit of casting I’m sure. Maps offer a bunch of promising looking area’s for Muskie & Pike, I haven’t a clue where to start searching for Walleye there.  

Sent you an email.

Got it, thanks.
