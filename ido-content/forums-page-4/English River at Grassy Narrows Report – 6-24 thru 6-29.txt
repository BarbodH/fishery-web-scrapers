Year 14 on this system and each trip is different than the others. This year we had 3 of us in my boat that have been going here for years and 3 in another boat that were rookies here (and in Canada)

Did you fish Dumpty Lake? I may have this spelled wrong.

The water was about 3ft too low to get into Dumpy, most of our big fish came from Maynard Falls 

Fished that area a lot years ago. Now fish mostly Rainy lake. In fact leaving Friday for a week. New adventure going to fish the Canadian side. Then back again mid August

Good luck for both trips, I will be on Rainy (on the MN side) for the first week of October. This will be the 5th yr there. While fish count wont compare to the English River but Rainy in early October is still a great trip

Sounds like a good trip. Iâ€™d be bored out of my mind catching that many Walleyes. 

Ya, this may sound really stupid, but it was actually a little slower compared to the 2 previous years (880+ last year and 923 2 years ago with the same guys in the boat)
