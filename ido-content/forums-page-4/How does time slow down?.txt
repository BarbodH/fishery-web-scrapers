Heading north to Savant Lake area the 9th. As usual, I arrived in Canada earlier than expected. This morning, my mind and spirit are sipping coffee on the dock of a sweet walleye lake; patiently awaiting the arrival of the rest of me along with my gear.\
(My wife finds this “here/not here” thing really annoying.)

How was the trip?

Get a bigger motor. The faster you go, the slower time goes. 

It was awesome! Like a week trapped in what I imagine heaven must be like.
