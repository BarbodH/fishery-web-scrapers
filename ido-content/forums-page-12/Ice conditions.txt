A bunch of us are heading up by Ear Falls, Ontario at the end of the May. Was wondering if anyone could tell me if the ice is out or close to being out. Any reports would be great. Thanks, Woody

Nothing is open right now up that far unless you are going to a river system.
Where are you going?
My resort is on lower manitou lake, about 60 air miles south of dryden and I am looking at a may 5-6 ice out.

We are about 40 miles west of Ear Falls. So we are north of you aways. You getting any rain up there. That does some damage to the ice. Thank you for the update. Keep me up to date. Thanks Woody

Outfitter…May 5-6th would be a week or more ahead of last year right? I will be just north of Minaki on May 24th and if I recall from last year the ice went out on the lake we go to on the 14th or 15th.

Keepcasting,

As of today May 12 the ice is not close to being out on Red Lake. Big Trout is solid Ice. Otter tail has about 600/800 yards open from the River inlet in the lake. We fly into Trout on Thursday may 21st. It should be an interesting weekend thereafter. Hdahl

Good Luck hdahl,

Saw last week that ice was going out on Red Lake at Bow Narrows Camp on May 6. Dan and Brenda and their crew were going to be at camp on the 12th. It’s about 10 days earlier than last year.
