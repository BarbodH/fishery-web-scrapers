Thought I would see what people are up too this year. Can be open water coming later or on the ice now? Just curious whats the popular trend this year amoung the people reading this forum and Canada? What lakes/outfitters/time of year? etc etc. Are most of you already booked in to go somewhere or waiting to make reservations yet this year? Feel free to share, just wondering where everyone is heading this year. Will this be your first time to this lake your going too or been there before? Hope everyone that comes this year enjoys they’re trip and what Canada has to offer. If you have any questions about Canada, does not even have to reguard the outfit I’m with, feel free to ask and I’ll gladly give some answers about any Canadian issues or lakes or my 2 cents on a topic.

Two trips planned- both are low budget affairs. Quetico park for two weeks of Canoing and walleye fishing at the end of May. And I am taking my bro and his kid up to Lake Nipigon, I was not planning on this one but they just lost there mother/wife and I thought it would be good to have something to look forward to this summer. We will be laker fishing along with trophy pike hunting and walleye. We camp for this one….

 Are you driving up to this one? I used to fish up there every year. For me going to make another trip to Muskie Bay Resort on Crow sometime in March and will fish LOW for crappie at the same time. Then the English River Aug. The trip to the English will be some where in 20th or better times up. I try to hit Crow at least onece or twice a winter.

LOW Sioux Narrows – Lake of the Woods Houseboats/Laughing Waters Campgrounds.. Our family has been going up the week of the 4th for almost 20 years. Great walleye fishing and boat rides. Hope the gas price stays below $2/gallon this summer. Pete

 We stay with Brian King at King’s landing, I am planning on going the last week in June but that is dependent on my Bro getting off of work. Been going there since ’99 though I had to skip last year due to the finacial climate and gas prices, I’ve been toying with the idea of staying on Queensland out on the lake. Over the years of exploring I have found numerous abandoned cabins out on the lake but Brian is very friendly and he is centerally located to all the best fishing in that bay plus the permits for camping along with Brians parking fee its just cheaper and easier to stay with him. Not to mention that wherever you go to fish on that lake it is a distance to travel so gas is a factor also

Oh by the way, welcome to IDO. Do you ever visit the Thunder Bay fishing sight? I lurk over there trolling for any info I can get on Nipigon. Its tough getting info on the lake because of its size and its limited access. To me that is good and bad- but way more good than bad  I see your resort is on the east side of Nipigon, Kings landing is on the west side, it is really the only good access on that side. Brian is a member of the Gull River Indian Reservation. http://www.thunderbayfishing.com/

Cool… it is neat to hear about the other side, being so close to the east side, we forget about the west side. I will check out the TB site you mentioned. I am fortunate enough to be good friends with a 3rd generation commercial fishing guy that is on Nipigon. He has some very intimate knowledge of the lake. I dare say he has the most knowledgeable of it’s deeps and contours of anyone on the planet. He is a great resource and a BIG speck guy. I run guided trips to Wabinosh in June. Have you fished there? That is a pretty special area with some phenomenal fishing…

Wabinosh Bay or Wabinosh Lake. I have been to both. The one time I ventured into Wabinosh Bay I witnessed the boat we were following crash into a rock at 45mph, almost was deadly, the guy in the passenger seat flew into the front pedastal and busted his shoulder and busted his face up. In the end I had to use my first responder skills to put the passenger in the boat back together enough to get him down to Thunder Bay. Needless to say it kinda threw our boat off for the rest of the day and we went back to camp early to check on our injured friend. Would like to head up there again. Believe it or not this happened on a blue bird day and Nipigon was like glass that day the rock that the guy hit was actually sticking out of the water by atlkeast 18″. This made it very tough to see with no waves to break up the rock contour- The guy leading us actually stopped us 5 minutes earlier to make us aware of that very rock! Please tell me about the bay if you have been there!
