Anyone know how many rods per license you can use (troll) when fishing on Lac Seul or Ontario in general? Just one like MN, or can you use more at one time?

One is it.

In Ontario you are allowed two rods unless they changed it this year.

Chrossa – You can only fish with one line during the openwater, it is two lines on the hardwater. It has been that way for a very long time, as long as I can remember.

looks like one rod per person, based on the online regs that I found today… Unless I’m missing some sort of special lac seul allowance or something…

You are right on, there are no special exceptions for Lac Seul
