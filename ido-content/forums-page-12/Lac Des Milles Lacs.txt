 Pine Point Resort. 

I have fished Lac Des Mille Lacs 5 times in the last 7 years. A group of us go up the 2nd or 3rd week of June each year. We stayed at Pine Point last year but have stayed at the Lac Des Mille Lodge (NW side of the lake) in previous trips.

Our group has fished Lac D every year since 1962, we have been at Pine Point since 1965. Great place to stay and to fish. We go up for the opener and stay for two weeks.      

My wife’s uncle (Bill Hipenbecker) & his wife Kris are 1/2 owners of Pine Point. It’s sad too. Have been for several years running now but my nearest view of the lake has been brought to you by Google Earth. Guess that’s what small children do to ya. The stories of colossal pike and ridiculus dimensioned walleye finding the bottom of the Beckman consume several hours of annual holiday gatherings. Nothing like getting the hair on the back of your neck to stand on edge. This ole man river pool 9 blue blood will wet a line or two at this fabulous destination – just as soon as possible.
