last thursday and friday were the best days fishing crappies I’ve had since red lake was hopping!Goose and I decided to make a trek north of the border for a crappie expedition.I am sworn to secrecy. you know the deal.I just wanted to share a great outing on a great lake with great friends and awesome weather. these fish, I don’t know, we must have caught fifty fish in two days, releasing the biggest ones and keeping 28 that went 12-14 inches, came up on anything red.Goose went with the red glow buckshot tipped with power grubs, while I used some of them, mostly I stayed with the red glow angel eye and a whole minnow.it seemed, if they were going to bite, it didn’t matter what we were using. they hit it.we fished anywhere from 28 feet to 45 feet of water. the fish in the 45 feet of water really had issues when they came up, so we didn’t stay there long. I’m taking my son there next week for his first canadian experience. I can hardly wait!
