What is the biggest question you have about fishing MONSTER Canadian pike just after ice out?


Are you using smaller profile baits early or typical Muskie size baits while targeting these pike?

Was that fish caught on Teapot lake??



Yeah, when do we leave??? 

w have had very good luck with whit twister tails in the 5 inch range texas riged with a light sinker! cast it into the timber on steper banks on shield laks and just let it fall slow! big pike cant pass this presintation up! thewy will bite it on the drop! the slower the better! just as long as its fast enouph the get the twister twitching! first ice out on the lower manitou year after year has put some very nice fish inthe boat fishing this pattern!
