We broke camp yesterday and the fishing was pretty good right off the bat. The first group in unpacked yesterday about noon and headed out fishing after lunch and were back around 5 pm for dinner. The brought in a few keepers to eat and released a a few more. The biggest was about 8lbs, with most in the 3-6lbs range. They are first timmers so it was nice to see them get off on the right foot. It’s nice to get back on the water after a long winter. I will try to update out fishing reports when I get a chance.

is the main lake open?

The entire system is open all the way to the top. I don’t know what the water temps are, but I will ask one of the guests and report back to you.

30 lakers a day… sounds blissful! What kind of size range do you see on the lakers this time of year?

The trout are running in the 3-6lbs range. The biggest caught was just over 10lbs. It’s been a good start to the softwater season.
