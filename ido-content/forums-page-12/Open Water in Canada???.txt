I’m looking to head up to northern Ontario in a month and with this late ice out was just wondering how far north the lakes are open at this point? Anybody flying in with trips postponed in the next couploe of weeks? Just curious

Shout at Chad – Pasha Lake here on IDO. He’s located in NW Ontario right on Pasha Lake and should be able to give you the latest update.

id guess in a month they will be. the some lakes right by the border are such as mudrow, horse and i think basswood is, etc are already open as of earlier this week. but then again northern ontario is along ways from the border.

I’m headed about 500 miles north of international falls just to give you an idea of what I’m looking for.

Here’s a reply from Chad at Pasha Lake. Its about 325 miles or so north and east of Duluth. Hope this gives you a sence of what you are looking at… 

Some of the small lakes are starting to open up right along the border, the midsized ones north of the border and just south of dryden should be open within the next week. Lac suel and some of the flyin lakes farther north should be open between the 12th-14th and the most northern outposts should be around the 17th or so, so it will be close for those of you going way up north.
