Had a great time and good fishing on LOTW the first week in June. Weather was cool and they are having a real late spring. Caught lots of Northern, walleye, bass, musky, and a few lake trout. We do this trip every year and I look forward to it. Not just the great fishing but the wildlife,and the beauty of the lakes and shorlines. We stay at Helliar’s Resort in Nestor Falls. Great people! A Canadian fishing trip is great way to spend a week !!!

Hey Big Fish Dude! I had a note saying your were going to be gone last week…so I had all of your aerials tested while you were away! Nice fish, great pictures and more memories for the golden years in the rocker. Is it true what Brian says…you always have a Canadian accent when you come back from your tips?
