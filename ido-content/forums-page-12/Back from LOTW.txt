Had a great time and good fishing on LOTW the first week in June. Weather was cool and they are having a real late spring. Caught lots of Northern, walleye, bass, musky, and a few lake trout. We do this trip every year and I look forward to it. Not just the great fishing but the wildlife,and the beauty of the lakes and shorlines. We stay at Helliarâ€™s Resort in Nestor Falls. Great people! A Canadian fishing trip is great way to spend a week !!!




Hey Big Fish Dude!

That is correct, eh!
