Does anyone have any info on Savant Lake Ontairo? I have fished Gullrock for many many years but liked the idea of the lake trout. Wildwood lodge has many very nice lake trout pictures but many of them look like very old pictures. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks guys.

If your not set on fishing Savant, try Gateway North Outfitter. @ http://www.gatewaynorthoutfitters.net. I used to work in Canada as a bush pilot for many years and my family is still up there running fly in out post camps. My brother started Gateway North a couple of years ago and split from the family business. He is a very avid fisherman and has fished the area for over twenty years.
