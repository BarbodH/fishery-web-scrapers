Just thought I would let everyone know that the ice is really forming goodon Lake of the Woods and surrounding lakes and will soon be able to fish comfortably on the ice. There is reports of people already north of us fishing alot. I havenâ€™t been on the little smaller lakes in the area but I am sure I could get out fishing if I was brave.

A couple on lake Wissota on sunday!
