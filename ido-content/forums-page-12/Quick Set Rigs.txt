 Can Quick Set Rigs be uset in Ontario?The QS rig in question uses two treble hooks on a steel leader dressed with beads and a spinner.  It is fished with live suckers or dead cicos for bait.

The quick strike rigs we use in the spring for trout are a set of trebles on a steel leader, with the end one crimped down and the second one floats on the leader depending on the size of the cisco.Yours having a bunch of beads and a spinner, I don’t know? It kinda sounds like a spinner rig for walleyes (bigger version) with a couple of trebles on the end, which I don’t think is legal.The best thing to do would be to search “ontario MNR fishing regulations” you should be able to find what you need there.
