Can Quick Set Rigs be uset in Ontario?The QS rig in question uses two treble hooks on a steel leader dressed with beads and a spinner.  It is fished with live suckers or dead cicos for bait.

The quick strike rigs we use in the spring for trout are a set of trebles on a steel leader, with the end one crimped down and the second one floats on the leader depending on the size of the cisco.Yours having a bunch of beads and a spinner, I don’t know? It kinda sounds like a spinner rig for walleyes (bigger version) with a couple of trebles on the end, which I don’t think is legal.The best thing to do would be to search “ontario MNR fishing regulations” you should be able to find what you need there. Good Luck with your search.

 Thanks for the info. Your rig is similar except to be legal in MN a small bead is added above the crimped treble and a very small spinner(#00) is added above the sliding treble.
