I saw a post about laker fishing that one of the guys responed to, but it had our old link. Here is the New link http://www.campmanitoufishing.com

The pic of that 63# laker from Superior is impressive. I’d like to see that one myself or with something in the photo to give some perspective on what I’m sure is one incredible fish!

I can’t even imagine catching a laker that big, The biggest ones reported on Lower Manitou since I have had the camp are in the 20-23lbs. range.

How long have you had the camp? Did the lakes in your area produce bigger lakers in the past?

I have had the camp for 8 years now and from talking to the longtime guests it is producing just as good now as it did in the past, with the tight limits and slots every species seems to be doing very good. The biggest thing keeping our lake good, is the limited access, there is only 1 landing to 55 miles of water and the landing is down 20 miles of gravel off the 502 hwy, north of Fort Frances, ont.

Sent you a PM.
