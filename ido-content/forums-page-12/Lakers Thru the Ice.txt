I am seriously considering a trip to Canada to chase some lakers thru the ice this winter and was hoping to get pointed in the right direction. I know that Lake of the Woods is a serious destination and I remember Scott Steil reported a trip last year from there. What I’m looking for: – Drive to location from TC – Lodging – Guide service (if it is necessary) – 3 to 4 nights (possibly bring the lady and another couple, or jsut a guys trip. Not sure yet…) I should be pretty well setup for laker fishing but if I book a trip I may invest in some more fishing gear because it won’t be my last laker trip.

We always go to Muskie Bay Resort while up there. They are very well set up, cabins are great or they have a motel right there on-site. Also if interested check out the Thorne Bro’s Ice Outing. That is an all inclusive trip with some very good people to show you around. Muskie Bay Resort

This post might be to late, but my brother operates a fishing camp north of Emo. He has a number of outposts around that area with lots of trout. He spends all his free time chasing them and offers his expertise guiding if you so desire. Get ahold of Lucas Adams at http://www.gatewaynorthoutfitters.net. Just a note, I was up over the holidays and if you go, be sure and have your deep snow kits on the sleds. Lots of snow and tons of slush. Real hard going and very hard on the sleds. Take plenty of Isopropyl Alcohol for the sleds
