I can’t wait! I lucked out and was asked to fill in for a last minute cancellation in a party of 6 who have been going up there for the past 12 years. I’m hoping to return with a sore arm!

AJ: I get to go for my second trip out of Silver Water Wheel in the SW side of the lake north of Dryden a week from Sunday. We didn’t go for numbers, but went for size. Still caught enough for shore lunch all days and 4 – 28″ fish. Usually July is the best big fish month for this resort. We were the first, ending a 10 day drought of fish over 28″ last season, to get a 28″. Then followed it up with 3 more over the four days we fished. I went to break my 27″ PR and saw five fish between 26 and 26 3/4″, but not a sniff of even a 27″. Great trip!!! Here is one of the 26 3/4″ with the BFishiN shirt and all of the jigs Koonce set me up with at my cost, of course!!! Mark

Wow! Those are some nice fish! We had a great time up there! On the second full day, the boat I was in smacked a rock and took the skeg off. Prop shaft was bent and oil was leaking. We were 24 miles out, so the rest of the day was spent towing it back. I really felt bad for the guy — it was a brand new boat and this was his first fishing trip with it. It probably only had 12 hours on it. But, the fishing there is incredible! I couldn’t believe the bite. We had good weather and the bite was going strong!

If you think YOU felt bad as a rider, how do you think the guy in the guide boat felt????
