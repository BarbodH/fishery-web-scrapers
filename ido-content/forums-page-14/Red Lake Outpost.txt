We are flying out of Red Lake in mid-August. Itâ€™s been 5 years since we fished there and I have trouble recalling the appropriate leadhead jigs. Need help.

When I am fishing in that area I use a lot of both 3/8th and 1/2 oz jigs. My first choice is always a 3/8th oz and only use the 1/2 when I am in current. If you can keep your back trolling speed slow enough to use the 3/8th oz that would be my choice. 

Scenic, thanks for your reply.

Hillbiehle:

We used 1/4 to 3/8 oz in 15 to 18 feet of water, take along a drift sock for getting your speed down.
