Hey guys, Iâ€™m looking for some info on what works well on LOTW around Kenora for the girlfriends family. They are leaving this Friday(about three weeks later than normal) and be up there for a week. When I go up, its during the first week in June and we are farther south in the Nestor Falls area. Since its a month later, would the fishing conditions farther north near Kenora be similar to what we have in early June at Nestor Falls? Any tips you can give or are willing to share would be appreciated. Thanks a lot guys
