Talked to the better half tonight and she told me they had a pretty good day of fishing. They are fishing in the Kenora area on LOTW. She said that they were out for 5-6 hours and boated a lot of fish, some nice sized walleye and some 4-5 pound northern. The majorty of the fish were caught on Lucky-O spinners trolling in 15-20 feet of water. Sounds like its plenty cold up there right now but they’re having a good time. I’ll give what updates I can as I hear from her.

OK, your wife is up in Canada, without you? Not to pry, but that sounds pretty cool. I wish my wife had that much interest in fishing!! You are a lucky guy.

TUESDAY UPDATE Just got off the phone with her tonight and the fishing was slower this afternoon, but this morning was HOT!!! Only her dad, brother, and grandpa went out this morning, but they boated several fish including a 29.5″ 7 lb walleye.
