Talked to the better half tonight and she told me they had a pretty good day of fishing. They are fishing in the Kenora area on LOTW. She said that they were out for 5-6 hours and boated a lot of fish, some nice sized walleye and some 4-5 pound northern. The majorty of the fish were caught on Lucky-O spinners trolling in 15-20 feet of water. Sounds like its plenty cold up there right now but they’re having a good time. I’ll give what updates I can as I hear from her.

OK, your wife is up in Canada, without you? Not to pry, but that sounds pretty cool. I wish my wife had that much interest in fishing!! You are a lucky guy.

Ditto!

TUESDAY UPDATE
