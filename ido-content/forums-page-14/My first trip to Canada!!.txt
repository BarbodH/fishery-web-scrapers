Myself and 2 friends just got back from a week of camping on an island in Canada, about 2 1/12 hours from Ignace, Ont. It was my first time fishing in Canada and it was a trip of a life time. We set up camp on Sat Aug 3rd in the afternoon and left Fri. Aug. 10 in the afternoon. I have never caught so many fish before. No monsters but some very nice sized ones. My biggest walleye was 18″, pike was 33″, and smallmouth was 18″. We saw a bear swimming from the island we were camping on to the next one on Thurs., just glad he didn’t come visiting while we were there!!!Here’s a few pics. of the trip. The first one is of the island we stayed on.

The next one is my 18″ walleye!! 

This is my smallmouth.

My biggest pike.

And finally the sunrise on Friday morning.
