As a brand new member of IDA I thought I would share my first post with all of you regarding Smallmouth Bass fishing on Lake Simcoe in southern Ontario. Located about one hour from Toronto Lake Simcoe has what is now probably the best Smallmouth bass fishing next to Lake Erie. It’s quite common to catch 4 and 5lb fish on a regular basis with 6lbs not being uncommon. This time of year jerk baits such as the xrap in white and tubes in any natural colour work well., but for killer action 3/4 oz white spinnerbaits burned under the surface are just killer. If you need more info let me know via a pm and I’d be happy to fill you in.

Thanks for the tip and welcome! Can’t make it up there this year but I’m going to add it to my lakes to fish list!

Anytime anyone wants any info on fishing in Canada particularly Ontario feel free to ask. I fish tournaments all summer long and enjoy fishing for all species walleye especially. So if you need info on hot lakes or spots to fish just drop a line!
