Above: 35.5″ Northern Pike caught by Where’s Waldo.

Uh, I’ve never been to Canada fishing. Are there multiple “Where’s Waldo” users on this board? Anyway, nice fish.

Looks like the Where’s Waldo I know…nice fish guys. To the other Where’s Waldo, are you Where’s Waldo or Where’s Waldo?…with a question mark?

I’m the one with the question mark. I’m better looking too.  I’m just kidding. I havn’t seen any posts from what must be the “original” Where’s Waldo. He’s got a great screen name, doesn’t he? 

Looks like we could have a copyright infringement going on!!!!  Bill wish you could have been there to see Dylan eat. He had to take restroom breaks during meals just to make room for multiple plates of food.

waldo, I warned Dylan about your cooking  wish I could have went this time with you.
