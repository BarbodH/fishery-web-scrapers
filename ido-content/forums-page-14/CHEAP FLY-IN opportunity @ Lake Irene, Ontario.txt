I just got an email from a buddy that there was a late cancellation on a Lake Irene Fly-In trip in Ontario Canada for June 8-12. There would be a huge savings to anyone willing to go. Here is the information.I’m just posting to see if this fits into anyones schedule and would be able to go on a trip of a lifetime at a discounted cost. Any questions call the resort below.

5 days on a fly-in , I would guess about $1495.00 per person, minimum of 4. big g
