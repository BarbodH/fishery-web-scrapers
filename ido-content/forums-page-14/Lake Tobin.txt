I am going to Lake Tobin October 26th thru the 31st. We could use some tips. 1st time for me and my pal Jeff.

take good high quality set of insulated rain gair

I am heading up in 2 weeks…I will post a report when i get back! 

My Dad and I went last year the first week of Oct and the best advice is for numbers hit the “lake” portion and for size hit the “river” section in Nippawin. On the lake portion we fished breakline and rock piles in 25′-35′ of water pulling bouncers and spinners with great success. Good luck!! If you fish the “lake” make sure to keep an eye out for deadhead logs floating since they will ruin a vacation in a hurry.



Of my many trips to Tobin I have learned to pack everything including the kitchen sink as clothing goes.First trip in early Oct: 85+ and sunny every day.Second trip in early Oct: 6 inches of snow the second day. High for the week 42Third trip in early Oct: 65-70 and rain.Fourth trip in early Oct: 40-50 and partly sunny.

Where are you staying and are you fishing the lake OR the river.

My bait shop owner is going up Thursday for a week remind me to get some tip or I can put u in contact with him 

Jeff has made the reservations, so i dont know for sure. We are preparing to fish the river.
