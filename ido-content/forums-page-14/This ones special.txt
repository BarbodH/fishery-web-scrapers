Leaving tomorrow night for our annual Canada trip, Separation lake on the English river is our destination. This year my son graduated from High School, as a graduation present we are keeping our group size small so we can focus more on angling. Though we are excited,its also bitter sweet as this year my dad isnt going to join us. Getting in and out of the boat is just too difficult at his age. I hope to have some great stories to tell next week.

Please tell when you get back. Have a great time! Sorry about your dad. I know how you feel. My grandpa taught how to fish and showed me the passion. He ust cant get in and out of the boat anymore…………………everytime I wet a line on soft or hard water I have a hard time not to remember the “Good Old days” of learning hoe to cuss, spit snuss and fish! Good Luck!

I am heading to Horwood lake in eastern Canada tomorrow (Friday) with my brother Kind of special to me. First time I am going with just my brother. Dad is not going, not because he is unable to get in and out of the boat – Just because he is a pain in the butt. I love him but the older he gets the bigger pain he seems to become. I am really looking forward to time with my brother. I hope you enjoy the time with your son.
