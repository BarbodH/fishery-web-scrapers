Leaving tomorrow night for our annual Canada trip, Separation lake on the English river is our destination. This year my son graduated from High School, as a graduation present we are keeping our group size small so we can focus more on angling.

Please tell when you get back. Have a great time! Sorry about your dad. I know how you feel. My grandpa taught how to fish and showed me the passion. He ust cant get in and out of the boat anymore…………………everytime I wet a line on soft or hard water I have a hard time not to remember the “Good Old days” of learning hoe to cuss, spit snuss and fish!

Good luck up there and please give us a report when you return. Heading up there in a few weeks or sooner myself.

I am heading to Horwood lake in eastern Canada tomorrow (Friday) with my brother
