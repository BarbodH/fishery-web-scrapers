Hi, 

Pal,

I’ve gone out of Morison numerous times, but mostly fished out around the McPherson Island area. I havent fished in that area for several years. But what I can say is that the walleyes should be up on the reefs when you get there, so dont hold back on the live bait and jig setup. Or a lindy setup for that matter. Try all positions of the reef, up, down, upwind, downwind, top, bottom. They should be there somewhere. Live bait can be a bit tough to get up that way, and check the current laws on bringing bait into Canada. I think you can only bring crawlers in commercial bedding across the border.

I would use a 2oz bottom bouncer 6 ft Leach/ crawler harness hammered gold or silver #4 spinner. Make sure you have a rod holder your arm will get plenty sore holding on to that rig all day long.

Thanks for all the tips. I am staying at Buena Vista Resort, and if I remember correctly, they supply minnows to other resorts up there. I will look in to bring up some worms. Looks like I need to visit sportsmans warehouse for some other stuff… 

 


We have a cabin on Hanson Bay, which is about three bays over from BV. If you’re not using a guide, talk to Richard who’ll let you know some fantastic spots. BV is a very, very good fish producer for their guests. 

Hi Fisherman J, 

Pal,We rented a houseboat out of Morson a couple years ago too fishing muskies. I brought my wallet too and left the nice guys at the Morson Marina 4K for a brand spank’n new lower unit.  Oh, be very careful and watch for rock piles.  You will definitely enjoy your trip.

Fisherman J is right about the hammered gold and hammered silver. However, you couldn’t get me out there without orange blades in the arsenal!

Many thanks to all for the advice and help. We mainly were jigging, but we also did a little bottom bouncing with spinners.
