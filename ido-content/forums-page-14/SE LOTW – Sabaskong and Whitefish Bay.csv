1218295,Osprey,2007-07-03 16:05:00,29,"I’m headed up to Nestor Falls/Souix Narrows area in a couple weeks. I plan to fish for whatever I can catch; smallies, northern, muskie, walleye, Lake Trout. Any help/insight on fishing-areas/structure/presentation is greatly appreciated. FYI…I practice catch and release though I may keep a meal of walleye or northern. Thank you in advance for any insight."

As for this year our trip included personal bests for 3 of 4 in my group…42″ Muskie (14 y.o. son), 38″ Northern (75 y.o. f-in-law) and 41″ Northern (mine)."
