I am looking for some feedback on the NW Angle durring the end of June. Our group is considering trying the Angle to combine the begining of muskie season and catch some walleyes. I have been there once before, but strickly for muskies in october. What is the walleye fishing like in June in that area? With decent conditions can a person get pretty consistant action, size? Any feedback on previous trips is appreciated. Thanks!

Muskie opener is a great time to be there! New weed growth will have walleyes and muskies, and sun-soaked rocks will have smallies and muskies. You could probably throw a 1/2 ounce spinnerbait and catch all three in either type of location. If youâ€™re lookin for a place to stay, I highly recommend Bay Store: http://www.baystorecamp.com Muskie opener is a really popular time to visit the Angle, so book ASAP. 

John has some great, valid pionts.
