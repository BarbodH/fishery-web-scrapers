I’ve got a question too. Do you need a passport if you walk over the bridge from International Falls to F.F.just to pick up a Canadian fishing lic.? Will be going to Kabatogama, Rainy area and would like to be covered just in case I cross the border on the water while fishing.

Remember this as well – if you cross on water…you need to follow all of the same rules as on land such as no minnows, leeches, or crawlers in dirt. Also – alcohol is prohibited from even being possessed on the water – unless you are in direct travel to a residence. Zero tolerance with heavy fines. And the biggee – make sure everybody in the boat has ID and a Remote Area Border Crossing Permit (RABC)(available at the customs office or via mail – requires a background check….recent DWI convicts need not apply). Without a RABC permit, you can not enter Canada without going through a port of entry (customs) and you must check back into the U.S. via either US Customs, or a phone call to them. Tim

Had an interesting conversation with US Fish and Wildlife as we re-entered the US. The ‘new” guys that went up with us fileted the northern pikes the “other ” way. (2 ways to filet a pike and not have a y-bone) Well, we ended up with some, and he had a loooong discussion with my dad and me about how that is wrong. Long story short, thank goodness I had the 7 y/o son with me, or I would have had a ticket. Moral of the story… filet and pack your own D##m fish.
