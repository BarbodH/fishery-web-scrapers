After seeing the other report and getting all excited I thought I should ad my report from ealier this year. I’m also planning on going again August 10-17th. This trip is something I’ve been doing for 25 years. I guess I’m getting old. We camp on Crown land, have excellent fishing, good times and has never cost me more then $400 leaving from my door for the week. Beer is extra. Where we go you can’t use live bait so most walleye are caught with jigs and tails. The northerns we pick up on spoons and buck tails. The deepest spot on this lake is 29′ deep. Average fish is 18″ with the largest caught at 27.5″ The biggest Northern or Jack went 38″ but several caught from 34-36. I’ve attached some pics….p.s. I’m packing to go again in 9 days.

Nice report Doug.That campsite cannot get much closer to “shoreview” IMO! Nice!

The trip is about 100+ miles north of the town of Pickle Lake. It’s all gravel road.

Looks like a great place. I wish I could go with you. Wait I did just go with you this year and you are going again without me  that’s not nice you know.
