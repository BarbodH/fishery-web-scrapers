1218302,walleye_wisdom,2007-08-20 19:55:00,1160,Above: 35.5″ Northern Pike caught by Where’s Waldo. This report is from Nothern Ontario. Weather was less than desireable with high winds all but a couple days and a major cold front really shutting of the fish. Fishing was still really good with many Pike going over 30in with the largest going 35.5″. Largest Walleye measured 27.5″ A special thanks goes out to Where’s Waldo for all the planning and coordination of the trip! 35″ Northern 27.5″ Walleye

601727,jighead-two,2007-08-20 21:31:00,642,"Looks like the Where’s Waldo I know…nice fish guys. To the other Where’s Waldo, are you Where’s Waldo or Where’s Waldo?…with a question mark?"
601738,wheres_waldo,2007-08-20 22:07:00,478,"I’m the one with the question mark. I’m better looking too.  I’m just kidding. I havn’t seen any posts from what must be the “original” Where’s Waldo. He’s got a great screen name, doesn’t he?"
