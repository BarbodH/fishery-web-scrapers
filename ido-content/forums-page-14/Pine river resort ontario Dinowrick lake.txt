Had a trip at this resort and reporting that while fishing was good services wasnt. We had to wait 3 mornings for boats to be ready even though we explained we would leave at sunrise every day. They were of the mind set that the fish bite better at 9 am so why go earlier and wake us up. We also had difficulties with help needed we wrecked on the way to the lodge large moose and motor home we needed a lift back to town 19 miles after we paid them for the cabin they hid didnt need to help anybody that had paid. Sad we had good fishing but they made it known that our problems werent any interest to them but yet we were there paying Guest. A trip back wont happen and I suggest caution dealing with them you are asked to pay up front for the week never had that before either should have been a red flag.

~Steve DeMarrs 2007 Glad the fishing was good at least! I’m not sticking up for that resort…as I’ve never heard of them before…but I do know it’s hard to be everything to everyone. Good luck at your next resort!
