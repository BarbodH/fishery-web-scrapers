My group will be crossing into Canada at International Falls and then heading over to Ignace. We have never traveled highway 622 from Atikokan north. We will be towing a Lund Mr Pike 16. Wondering if anybody could give me some feedback on the condition of this highway? Thanks, R.

Take your time and you\’ll get there in one piece! I\’m not sure why they have all those bump on the road signs? They could save their money and put bumps ahead all the way to Pickle Lake. Have fun and let us know how you did.

I traveled that road one time and now cross at pigeon falls north of duluth. a more senic route, less hassel at the crossing, then you have the best road in canada [17], to ignace. travel time and mileage is the same. good luck fishing.
