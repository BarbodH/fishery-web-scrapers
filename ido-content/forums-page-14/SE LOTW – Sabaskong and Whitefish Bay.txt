I’m headed up to Nestor Falls/Souix Narrows area in a couple weeks. I plan to fish for whatever I can catch; smallies, northern, muskie, walleye, Lake Trout. Any help/insight on fishing-areas/structure/presentation is greatly appreciated. FYI…I practice catch and release though I may keep a meal of walleye or northern. 

Can’t really help you out for this time of the year, but was wondering where you are staying at? The group I go with always stays at Helliars Resort right next to the falls at Nestor Falls.

i think you stay at helliar’s just because green’s is a stones throw away. 



Helliars, cabin 32 this year.
