anyone been up there lately, how has the fishing been? I’ll be heading up at the end of august in search of walleyes, and pike. Staying at pine point resort.Might try for some smallmouths too, last time we caught a couple of 18″ers

I was up there July 9 through the 14th. The temp was in the fifties and it rained everyday. We caught a few walleyes, the largest being 22 inches. A few small northern also. We stayed at Cushing Lake Resort. It was the first time up there for me so I don’t know much about the end you are staying at.
