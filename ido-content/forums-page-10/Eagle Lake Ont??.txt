anybody heard or fished eagle lately my dad and brother are heading up on the 19th of june for there first trip to Canada just lokking for a few tips for walleyes so they can spend time catching!!! 

This is what Steve Herbeck had to say about Eagle Lake as of Saturday 6/12:

I was up there a few years ago in the Fall on the West Arm (Way up in the NW end of the lake) at Stanleyâ€™s Resort, best tip is getting tips from your Resort staff. They want you Happy and Satisfied and should have the latest info.
