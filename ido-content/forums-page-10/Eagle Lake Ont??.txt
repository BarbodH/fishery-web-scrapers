This is what Steve Herbeck had to say about Eagle Lake as of Saturday 6/12: “Steve Herbeck Pro Staff Join Date: May 2008Posts: 281 fishing report 6/12 ——————————————————————————–generally a bit cooler weather in the 60’s-low 70’s this week has dropped water temps a bit into the 61-63 degree range. timely rains have brought water levels up to normal and no fire bans at this time.fishing last week was very good for all species on eagle for quality walleyes,bass and trout with pike mostly under slot and slot though some 30-38″ fish reported with one by brittney going 41″and the 4wd and fly-in lakes are smok’n for both numbers and quality fish right now.walleyes are still using weeds in bays and on flats at 4-14′ and are showing up on more humps and bars every day at 12-24′.jigs with minnows/leeches,spinner rigging both long lining and bottom bouncers or 3 ways with minnows,leeches,crawlers,powerbait,and trolling crankbaits have been best on the flats/weeds and jigs and or lindy rigs and large minnows and crawlers working on the humps.a few mayflys around but no real heavy major hatches at least on n and w eagle,look for another post soon on how to beat the hatch tactics.pike were starting to show up better in the weeds as the week progessed on minnow baits,spinnerbaits,and swim baits.obviously the bigger fish are or have been suspended or deeper.i would try a wire or heavy floro leadered lindy rig with 6-7″ suckers off main lake reefs or trolling bigger minnowbaits down 16-22′ as an alternative big pike tactic to casting right now if they are not showing up consistantly shallow for you. alot depends on the section or type of lake,water color and forage base.bass are done spawning for the most part with alot of fish using reed/rock and or wood combos near spawnig areas.topwater, x-raps,tubes,seikos wacky style,gulp mag leeches,and a plain hook and a minnow accounted for the most fish.trout have dropped to 65-70′ on spoons and minnow baits.there were some outstanding catches this past week, dan duran boated a 31 1/2″ walleye that was built like a fall fish at 11.5# released and he and his daughter had over 500 walleyes for the week fishing with guides many in over the slot.dave foster and his sons boated numerous pike to 38″,had a 300 fish day on a fly-in,a 100 fish+ fish day on a 4wd trip,and had 40-60 walleye days on eagle,the maka group concentrated on bass for the week except for a couple partial days for walleyes and reported catches totaling over 600 bass with many 17-20″+,said it was the best smallmouth fishing for quality they have ever experieced fishing with danny. the miler group fishing with guides also had an outstanding trip boating lakers to 18-20#,lots of pike 2 that went 44 and 44 1/2″,several bass days that were 150+,and lost count on walleyes 17 to 27-28″.some of thier group are fortunate to fish all over the world and said it was some of the best. the crans concentrated on pike and it was not as good consistantly for bigger fish as some of thier past trips but boated numerous fish 30-38″ with a 44″ on the last 2 days when things picked up and boated lots of big walleyes casting for pike with bigger lures throughout the week.the atweels,wrights,and van griessen groups all caught quality walleyes to 25- 28″ and pike to 38″ with some bass thrown in so all in all it was a good week with some super people in camp,everyone catching fish,lots of fun jaw jack’n and socializing and everyone talking of coming back at the same time next year. several groups are rebooking for end of aug and sept cause they can’t wait till then.with the way the season/water temps is shaping up it could be a great sept and oct bite.we still got a couple openings july 3-10 several openings scattered through end of july first of aug and sept/oct.give us a call for availablity and talk fishing!!”take care and good luck to all,herbieaml__________________Andy Myers LodgeSteve HerbeckWeb Site: http://www.andymyerslodge.com

I was up there a few years ago in the Fall on the West Arm (Way up in the NW end of the lake) at Stanley’s Resort, best tip is getting tips from your Resort staff. They want you Happy and Satisfied and should have the latest info. Call the Resort a week before you leave so you can stock up on Jigs/Lures that are currently hot before you leave and have to buy some overpriced stuff up there. If it is in the Budget, hire a guide for a day or half-day. Well worth it to make a trip successful. We did and had plenty to eat and all brought a limit home. We used their portage boat on Crab Claw Lake and all got a limit of Lake Trout too. They told us what to use and where to go and we used a couple portable fish finders. Have a Great time and post report and pics when you return.
