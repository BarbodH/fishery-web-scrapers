I will be passing through Sault Ste. Marie in mid-September heading to Pasha Lake Cabins and since this area is near my mid-way point, I would like to find a good place to find some pike for a few hours after a good nights rest. We will need to fish from shore, since we will be renting a boat at our final destination. (Near Beardmore) Thanks for any help.
