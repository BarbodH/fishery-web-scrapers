I was just out on Lower Manitou Lake today and there is about 3″ of slushy snow and standing water everywhere, some places its 2″ of water some 7-8″. I saw 2 small holes in the ice where water was running down, in a day or two they will be 2-3′ in diameter. I am guessing the lake will pop in 4-5 days and it will be great ice fishing with ATV’s for another 2 weeks, but then the shorelines will start to break away and we will be done. I know it’s early, but at this rate I am guessing April 22-25 range.

Hello, 

Just a guess but I think he is referring to enough weight (snow,slush,water) will run thru the holes and cracks and the ice will then spring upwards and float again. Just a guess tho.



Red Lab,

Its getting close to popping here too Outfitter. There are a ton of snmall air holes popping up letting the water drain. I am thinking we may have an early ice out for sure.

Given the latest weather and forecast for this week it would seem that Ice Out will be much earlier this year than last year. Last year it seemed like it was the 2nd week of May. Do you still think it is April 22?

With the conditions they way they are right now, I will have to update my ice out prediction to around April 8-10 range.The weather forecasted for this area the next five days is high in the middle 60’s with rain wed.,thur., fri.It’s going to go fast – so get your boats ready.

Wow. That is a lot earlier than last year! Right? Hope the fishing is a good as last year (Smallies). We go May 19-25 (Same as last year) and I would think that they would be up shallow in pre-spawn still. I love pre-spawn with Pop-R’s shallow.

Hey Ron,

I think it was both the advertising and location. Didn’t hear much about it prior. Also it was pretty far out, especially for Fort Worth and the mid cities. It was NE of Dallas. It was great for me because I live there but otherwise out of the way. I went to the show to see Jeremy and your friend is right, there was not much traffic. I could see where it would of been his worst show. I am pretty sure everyone felt that way. I am glad they are going to try it again though. Maybe move it to downtown Dallas or in the mid-cities in Arlington.

Ron,

Outfitter,

Thanks Ron,
