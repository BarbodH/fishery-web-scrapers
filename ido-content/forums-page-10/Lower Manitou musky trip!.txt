Here are a few more pics from the trip! we ended the trip boating 6 musky had the hooks in a couple others that slipped away! guess sometimes you learn to keep hooks sharp the hard way! second pic is of a manitou walleye! another group in camp got a 32inch and a couple mid 20 ” walleyes while we were there along with a 18 pound trout and a number of others over 10 pounds! We got a good pic of chad trying to retrieve his lure after a bad cast!  Good thing nate was hiding on shore under a tree during the bad storm (Nate is a little scared of thunder storms!)(that was nate in first pic) so he didnt get a pic of me climbing a tree to get my lucky bait back cant wait to get back up there!
