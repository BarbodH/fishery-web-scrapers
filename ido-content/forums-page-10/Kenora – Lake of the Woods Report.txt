Fished out of Kenora on Lake of the Woods from June 29 to July 1. June 29 was amazing weather…65 degrees and calm, a boater’s dream on the big lake. The walleye bite was also a dream….over 100 boated by the 4 of us. We hit 4 different reef/island points throughout the day. The bite was strongest from 15-26 f.o.w. We had a great shore-lunch and released 10 fish over 22″. Fished mainly with bottom-bouncers and spinners – minnow (live or dead) or crawler (no difference in bite). Very easy to view fish on the Lowrance and target them…if you did not see fish, do not fish in the area.
