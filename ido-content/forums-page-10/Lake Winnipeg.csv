1218436,18fisher,2011-03-13 16:16:00,412,Just got back from a week in Winnipeg. Man was it COLD and WINDY! Fishing was slow but we did manage some HOG walleyes. Total I bet 4 guys only caught 40-50 fish all week. When the big ones did come in they slammed the baits! A lot of big fish hit the “live target” and blade baits. We also stopped at LOTW for a day and picked up a quick limit for the ride home.
