is the ice off the main lake? or just the stretch?

The Ice has been off the whole system for 2 weeks now. We have had alot of warm weather and alot of wind for the past month and just about everywhere has had a record ice out.

We stayed May 23 and May 24 at Cabin five at Camp Manitou and the 25th througth the 29th at their Outpost Cabin. This was the best trip I’ve had yet to the Manitou in more than 25 years. The fish catching was non-stop. The smallies were on their beds, the northerns were crusing the shallows and the weather was perfect. Without targeting them, the muskies were continually playing with us. The water Temps when we were there were 62 to 65 in the bays, with some of the small off shoot lakes much warmer. Caught 43 straight bass out of one waterfall, one bay had over 70 northern, average at 100 fish a day. I told my son not to expect this every year. He told me “that’s what you said last year!”.

Thanks for the update. Can’t wait to get back up.

Any hot baits for the skies! Ill be there friday! oh I need to stop by and get the old mans generator from you! is it at the outpost yet or what! let me know and we will try and stop by on the way in! will pick it up sunday on my way out if that works for you!

I believe the generator you’re talking about is still on the front porch of the outpost cabin.
