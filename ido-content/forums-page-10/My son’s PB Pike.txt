We just hooked up with this pig last week in Ontario and thought I’d share. 42.5″ and estimated 25 lbs. CPR’dThanks for looking.Doug




What a beauty! Thanks for sharing the pic’s.

Very nice pike. I would have no problum saying that was 25+. I got a 41 a couple years back in ely mn that went 23lbs and it wasn’t as fat as yours. Congrats on the PB.
