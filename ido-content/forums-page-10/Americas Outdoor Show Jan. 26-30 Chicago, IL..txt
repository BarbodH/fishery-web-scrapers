Just wanted to let everyone that reads this board from the Chicagoland area know that there is going to be a big outdoors show coming in and the dates are Jan. 26-30. It’s called the Americas Outdoor show and it will be at the Donald E. Stevens Convention Center. It replaces the old Ohare/Rosemount Show and it looks to be alot better than in was in the past 5 years.

Thanks for the info Matt…I have been going to this show annually since it was in the Amphitheater (downtown Chicago) in the 1950s as a kid. They almost killed it the past few years with non outdoor persons trying to market it.I am coming back after skipping last year for the first time in about 54 years. I hope it will be worth the 300 mile trip down… I’ll try to stop and say hi~!
