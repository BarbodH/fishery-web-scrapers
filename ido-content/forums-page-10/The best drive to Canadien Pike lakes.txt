From what I’ve seen in the summer and heard through reliable sources about the potential through the ice… Nipigon is at the top of my list. Or more accurately, some of the bays off the main lake Nippi. 25+ lb fish are a reality. Now the question is… where to start looking on that gigantic body of water?!

Been there done that James. A little back drop into what I am looking for: My wife and I are celebrating our 20th next summer by driving out to Vancouver. I would like to take a few days of that trip and head into Canada, hire a guide and fish for pigs. Nipigon would be an excellent ice fishing choice, if you would like some pointers on were to try for them I could help you out. Set your sights a little higher for size, I would guess there are more than a handfull of 30+ fish swimming in those waters with virtually no winter pressure….

Second that on the Nipigon suggestion… This pig was landed in May ’10 near McIntyre Bay.
