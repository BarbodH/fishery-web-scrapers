I am heading to this lake the first week of August and am wonering if anyone out there has fished the lake. Wondeirng what to expect…what baits worked best for your etc…or, is this going to be one of those trips that it really won’t matter what we throw into the water, we will catch all we want? Thanks for any information you can supply.

I fished Nungesser for 8years.Great lake plenty of fish w a chance at a really big one now and then(29-30).We now fish Lac Seul (bigger water).The old jig and minnow or leach works great also spinners are good fish finders.Do not be reluctant to go way up the lake as the crowd thins out and the fishing stays hot!

You made a good choice. I owned a fly in only cabin in this area we used to camp and fish Nungesser every year started fishing it in the 80’s Tons of eyes use a jig and minnow its a big lake with alot of rocks to hit. The biggest northern was 31 lbs and around fifty inches it has great pike fishing in the bays and the cabbage you can have days every cast you have a walleye on and have 100 fish per day on eyes off points and off the reefs. It’s a big lake to travel without a guide but outstanding fishing. One lure to bring is the big doctor spoon in silver and silver and blue for the pike. Only one treble hook for easy release with a Doctor spoon. It’s a true trophy Lake enjoy. Aug, is a great time for a real trophy pike. Fish pencil reeds

Thanks for the reply. I am looking forward to the trip and hope it is still as good as you have described.

Interesting – I’m switching from Lac Seul to Nungesser. I just wanted to try something different. Sounds like it should be fun. Thanks for the input.
