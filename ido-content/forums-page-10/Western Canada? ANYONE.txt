So who is from the wild wild west? Anyone?

Welcome  to IDA Fil.

Well, IDA is a drugstore out west here, and if this is a drug store I came to the right place

I’m from Manitoba

Manitoba isnt much different than Alberta, right on boss! good to know, where in Manitoba? I have considered moving out there, more central. Gorgeous country!

I live north of winnipeg near Lake Winnipeg and run a fly-In fishing lodge on Gods lake in the summer.

Well, We should get to know eachother my friend 

We have great laker fishing at Gods and lots of my guests use fly fishing equipment especially for our brook trout.

good to know. do you have a website???
