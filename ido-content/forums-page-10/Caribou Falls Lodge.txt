Anyone been up to this resort? I’m heading up there next weekend for some eye and smallmouth action. What can we expect and how do you catch em up there?

No never been there. Good Luck and don’t forget to post on it when you return. 

Is that on the Winnipeg River system above white dog?

yes, i believe so. attached a lake map.i’m guessing the water will be stained and similar to LOW.


We fish that system out of KCR. We have been there since 1982 or 83. We are at the bottom of the river but we do fish as far north as Haley’s bay. Lots of great walleye, northern, and smallmouth fishing when we are there in June. I know that in the middle of September the fishing is still good, just deeper. We spend most of the time in Swan or Scott but that may be too far south for you. We see alot of Tetu boats but not many from Caribou falls. 

For canadian walleyes, I have found a simple Jig, outfitted with a twister tail, in white or orange, works best  For big pike, 5 of diamonds daredevils  have fun
