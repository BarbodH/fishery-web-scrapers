Just got back from a week in Winnipeg. Man was it COLD and WINDY! Fishing was slow but we did manage some HOG walleyes. Total I bet 4 guys only caught 40-50 fish all week. When the big ones did come in they slammed the baits!

Any 32″ ??? How many over 30″ ??? Looks like one to put on the list  

2 over 30″ biggest was 31″
