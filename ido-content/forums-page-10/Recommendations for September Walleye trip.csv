1218284,bigesox,2010-01-12 16:06:00,309,I’m looking for recommendations for a September Walleye trip into Ontario. Of course I’d like big fish and lots of them. Some members of the group want to do a drive-to trip and use camp boats. I’d be interested in all recommendations though. We’d be entering Canada at INTL Falls as our 1st choice. Thanks Everyone!!
290215,Calvin Svihel,2010-01-12 16:11:00,3862,"I would recommed Tetu Island Lodge . 5 star resort that you can drive to. They will pick you up and shuttle you to the island where the resort is on. My wife and I went here for our honeymoon, you don’t have to do a think but catch fish…thats it…I would go back in a heartbeat.  Lots of fish caught."
266128,molitor,2010-01-12 16:45:00,79,"I’ve been going to Lac Seul Lake in in Ear Falls, Ontario since I was a tike. Gold Pines Resort really has some great housing to offer. Plus the owners are really good people. The best part is I’d fish off the front dock where the gas pumps are and I could limit out on 17 3/4 inch eyes if I wanted too. The lake is one you will NEVER forget.. Truly a beautiful lake."
273528,David Leonidas,2010-01-12 17:09:00,29,"I’d recommend Winoga Lodge in Sioux Lookout, ON. Owner Dick Mansfield is a great guy and will put you on the hot spots, be it walleye, lake trout or northerns…even eelpout just for laughs. We generally take our own boats up there, but Winoga Lodge provides boats if you want to rent. Dick can also take you on a guided trip to Lac Suel. My family has been using Winoga Lodge since 1996. Can’t say enough good things about the place. Have never considered any other resort – great facilities. Winoga also has a couple of outposts that I’ve never been to, but I hear the fishing there is even better. http://www.winoga.com"

831580,Robin Holden,2010-01-13 01:29:00,54,"Do some research and find something that fits your needs, then call them and talk to them in person to get a feel of the place. There are a million camps on a thousand lakes so the options are pretty much limitless. Figure out whether you want american plan, all-inclusive, fish species, boat rental, sand beach, fly-in etc. Also maybe look into Sunset country which is kind of a host website for a large area that will do some of the searching for you."
836982,bigesox,2010-01-27 16:26:00,309,"OK, thanks for the input so far guys. We’ve narrowed it down to Gullrock or Lac Seul. One guy is concerned about crowding on Gullrock and thinks Lac Seul will have a more wilderness feel. I don’t care if it’s bumper boats if the fishing is better that’s where I want to go. Comments??? Thanks!"
839984,joe-winter,2010-02-05 15:38:00,1165,"i have not fished Lac Suel in the Fall but have in the late June/early July period 1-2 times a year for 6 years and it is awesome. We go to the east/northeast side of LS hae gone a number of lodging routes including houseboats, hotel, cabin stays. Talking with people who run some of the resorts they have made a couple of comments about fall fishing in the NE section can be incredible at that time. The NE section of lac suel has 3 river systems feeding it and is a significant spawning area and eyes start returning there come fall. maybe something to consider. Lac Suel Outposts runs up in that section as well as Andersons lodge has outposts up there. Catching will be no problem and can bring your own boat if you want. With the economy down this past year was the quietest (pressure) I have seen in my 6 years of going. FYI – we had the best day of my 6 years this past year too. SOme days you need to find them and some days it doesn’t matter where you are. My personal worst day in 6 years was a 25 fish day. My best day was 120+ fish. COnsider 40-60 the average for a 10 hour day fishing. (assuming some walleye fishing know-how)."

860742,kgeary,2010-04-05 04:50:00,9,"I would suggest Nungesser lakeIt’s accesable by private portage30,000 acres,no crowds.like doing a fly-in without the expense of flying.Anyone who has fished Nungesser will tell you it is a phenomonal walleye lake."
903368,2iceman,2010-10-10 01:05:00,98,"Another suggestion maybe for next year is Bonny Bay on Lake Wabigoon in Dryden Ontario. Great fishing, great hospitality and great lodging. Len & Nancy the owners make you feel like your family. The PWT went to this lake 2 years and there is a lake map chip of the lake."
