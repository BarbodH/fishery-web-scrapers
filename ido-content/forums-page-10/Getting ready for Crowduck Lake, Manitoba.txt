Packing has begun, GPS, Camera, Batteries, Rods, Reels, Tackle, Clothes, etc. Hitting the road with group of 12 at 4am Friday, Returning late evening Friday Aug 20. http://www.crowducklakecamp.com http://www.crowducklakecamp.ca http://www.stsretreats.org Note: I am in a few of the photo’s on their website and took a few of them too! Report with Pic’s when I return. PS: My 1st trip on June ’07 had over 100 – 21″ Walleye’s in 5-hours and quit counting. This is a C&R Only for Walleye’s, but plenty of similar sized Eye’s on their portage lakes to eat.

Yup, bout the only one I knocked off on that list is a smally caught in Quetico quite a few years ago (man I’m getting old). If I ever catch a +30″ walleye I’m gonna lick it like my dog does before I release it, then I’m gonna find a nice bottle of Grand Marnier and sip a little and have some cold frostys to wash it down- perferably New Castle.
