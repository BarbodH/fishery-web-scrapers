  Packing has begun, GPS, Camera, Batteries, Rods, Reels, Tackle, Clothes, etc.

Photo’s and Report coming upon my return.

That would be one impressive trifecta.



Yup, bout the only one I knocked off on that list is a smally caught in Quetico quite a few years ago (man I’m getting old). If I ever catch a +30″ walleye I’m gonna lick it like my dog does before I release it, then I’m gonna find a nice bottle of Grand Marnier and sip a little and have some cold frostys to wash it down- perferably New Castle.
