Out for a swim or being chased? 

It was nice of them to keep pushing him to away from shore. 

My thoughts exactly  I thought they were gonna drown the thing. Thatâ€™s something my 13 yr old son would have done. Beautiful deer but IDIOTS!! Deer could barely stand when it got out

Husker I agree totally. You could see that deer getting overly excited when the boat got real close. I can see following , at a distance, and filming , but pushing it AWAY from shore was beyond stupid!!!
