I can’t be the only one??? My buddy Ken and I are headed into the north end off of 11/17. First thing I noticed is the money saved. No remote border cross permit required and the camping is $5 or so a day cheaper per man. Anybody fish Quetico from the north side? We are going to canoe to Sturgeon Narrows from the center of the park south. It will be all virgin water for us! The plan is to find Lakers this year

Make sure to check the regs on what you can use for bait. A friend of mine no longer there since they banned all live bait and any artificial baits containing fish parts or foods. SO he said they could not use gulp or powerbait either. They said the fishing was great but got sick of that rule. I have not personally checked out the rules so please take the time to do so in case they were full of bs Mwal

Been there MANY times – I am sure I will be back this year, hopefully big lake Agnes and Lousia Falls. No to live bait, but you can use gulp etc. That went into affect last year. Also barbless hooks. So far I have not noticed much difference with the hooks, but I do miss sitting with live leeches and a bobber still fishing for walleyes. Gulp seems to work great while jig fishing though.

Not going in to Quetico this year, but I always wanted to enter from the North Side. iacanoeguy…did you ever fish Louisa? My wife and I stayed there for a few days and had the entire lake to ourself.

Live bait is nothing but a big pain in the @$$ets. We use the 5″ K-grub along with cranks for trolling when in search mode and hammer fish. We have been hitting the Falls Chain and into Kawnipi for the last 10 years and now it is time to try something new in the park….
