1218427,andy-johnson,2010-09-07 00:37:00,77,I was able to make the annual Lac Seul fishing trip this year after missing it last year with the birth of my daughter. The weather started out great the first part of the week but then got windy and rainy by the end of the week. We had good fishing again this year. Walleye action was consistent despite the changes in weather. Lots of nice walleyes this year with a good number of fish over 20″. Nothing over 27″ this year but a decent number of fish in the 25-26.5″ range. The pike fishing was decent at times but not as good for bigger fish then in years past. The weed growth was down in many areas this year which I think contributed to not as many big pike being shallow. We also got onto a bonus school of 15-18″ smallies one morning which was a nice surprise. Most walleyes were caught jigging but some came on spinners and cranks. Here are some pics.
