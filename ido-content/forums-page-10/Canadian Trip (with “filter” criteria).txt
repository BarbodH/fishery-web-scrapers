Okay, here we go. Went to the Northwest Sportshow in Minneapolis on Saturday and got a lot of information, but who better to ask than people that have been to some of these places or others that weren’t represented at the show? What I’m looking for:-4 guys making the trip-drive-in access-remote to semi-remote (we don’t want to battle crowds of people … I can do that on Mille Lacs!)-Under $1,000 total (including groceries, gas for trip, etc.) per person-we’ll make our own food, clean our own fish, etc. -want to be within a few hours of the MN/Canada border-mostly walleye action and lots of it!!! So there you have it – let me know if you’ve got any good recommendations for me! Thank you very much for any help you can lend.

This one fits  I was there about 10 years ago, he has since built new log cabins  If you go to Dominion Lake, you’ll be the only cabin and boats on the water I know of for sure. Discovery big G

You can try Jim and Julie’s Wabaskang Camp. It’s about 4-5 hours across the border. Great fishing, primarily walleyes and pike. Bonus fish of smallmouth.

Lake Despair Lodge is only one hour or so after crossing either IFalls or Baudette. Very nice people to.

I go here every year and it’s great people, good fishing, and to me it’s really cheap. Never spent more than $700.http://www.wabaskangcamp.com/

We go here (http://www.abramlake.ca/) every year and it’s 10 miles from the Lac Suel or you can fish Abram and Minnitaki Lakes where the fishing is just as good. We usually camp for a week and total cost for each person is around $350!!! Cannot wait to get there!!!

Sundog,We rented a houseboat on LOW about 5 years ago. They took us out to an awesome island (sandy beach) that we used as our base camp. They came and moved us midweek. The houseboat had all the luxeries of a nice cabin (TV, VCR, Microwave, stove, fridge, freezer, shower, etc) but we weren’t around anyone else. We had 5 – 6 guys for most of the week. Our cost ended up around the 500.00 per person range. We went later in the year so we got a discounted rate. I’ve been to Canada on several occasions and will not be camping up there anymore. Between the bugs and frequent storms – no way will I camp up there again.

Hi – Sounds like you have some sound purchasing ideas, but I noticed you didn’t mention service. You can go to many places in Canada and experience good fishing. You can also go many places in Canada and experience mediocre to very poor service. What makes fishing in Canada special is not only the fishing, but the experience that goes with it. That experience is only enhanced by top notch service and lodge owners that are willing to work diligently at meeting your needs, both outspoken needs and intuitive needs. No matter where you go, I recommend you contact the lodge and get a sound feeling for the type of service you will receive. If I can be of more assistance in helping you find a lodge, please contact me at 866 333 5943. I’m here 24/7.

 Truer words have never been spoken. Customer service is a HUGE factor in any purchase or decision I make. I’ll definitely call and talk to anybody prior to making final calls. I’m narrowing the field and then will get more in-depth from there, which will include direct contact with folks … yourself included! Please do shoot me an email with more information – I would be happy to review it and speak with you about things. Send me a PM, please! Thanks.

My vote would go to house boating on Rainy. Awesome scenery, excellent fishing for multi-species, not too far away….and the Canadian side offers plenty of solitude. Tim

I don’t know what amentities, you are looking for, but what is important to me, when I go fishing in a remote area is… 1. Good boats that float2. Motors that start and run great.3. plenty of gas4. a good set of oars/good net5. spare parts (props , plugs)6. a warm dry bed7. cooking facility/good propane fridge/or lots of ice8. shower, clean latrine9. good bait (if provided)10. camp wood When I go, I could care less about a TV or radio for that matter. I go to get away from all that. Good luck where ever you go, the really important stuff to me, is listed above, because it all makes for a great trip fishing for the desired species. Alot of people say the fishing is phenominal wherever you go in Canada. I can tell you, there is alot of variation, in Quantity and Quality of fishing in Canada. I have been on enough lakes, to know there is a difference. Most outfitters will give you references to call. Call a few big G

Been going to Bow Narrows Camp at Red Lake , Ont for 10 years now. They have everything you are looking for, but they clean and package your fish.

If you’re still looking, I wouldn’t look any further than the Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul. First rate service, fully guided and they have a great outpost program if you want to cook, clean etc. Google the name to find the website and then call Mike & Missy for details. 11 years andcounting… we have NEVER been disappointed.

In case you’re still looking- we’re now 12 years in a row and never been disappointed. This year’s group of 10 (4 guys, 4 ladies, 2 kids) caught 72 walleyes over 24″ including 12 over 27″- ALL CPR’d. The Silver Water Wheel Lodge ROCKS!!!
