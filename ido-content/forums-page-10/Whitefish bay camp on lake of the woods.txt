I know it is a year away, but a group of us are heading up to Whitefish bay camp on Lake O Woods, 2nd weekend in August 2011 where we have never been, targeting walleyes, worried might be hard to find. Does anyone have any tips, colors, rigging, bait, and locations to help in the hunt. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much.

Most posts ive read talk alot about gold gold and more gold. Good luck.

Thank you Russ

fathead minnows or shiners are going to be the best bait for walleyes early in the year during the day

Look for sand, if macrophytes are present this will make those areas even better. Over the past 6-8 years the rusty crayfish population has exploded to the point I think they have become a considerable food source for northern, walleye and (of course) smallies. Whitefish Bay is deep in areas and quite clear, low light conditions will be your best bet for walleye. When the walleyes are stubborn try throwing spinnerbaits, jerk baits and large (5″) tubes for pike or grubs and tubes for smallies. Smallies will be on the deeper rock reefs and larger pike will be on the deeper weedy reefs or hanging with schools of whitefish and cisco.

I fished WFB a bit this past summer. I use to fish it quite a bit but it is tough w/ the clear water. I did some deepwater trolling for big eyes but only managed a 38″ pike. I also did some bouncing at a couple hotspots from the past and managed a few nice eyes around 20″. My biggest Canadian eye came from WFB. Dark, windy & stormy days you can find the eyes up on the reefs snapping. If its too nice you might have to head few miles north and hit Yellow girl or Long bay areas. Good luck!! Dennis

if you want to change it up a bit, bring a few dipseys and troll for Lakers. We had fun with them last summer. No giants but I have heard there are some.
