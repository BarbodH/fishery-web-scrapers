Were heading up to Lac Seul in late september. Ive never fished the lake and primarily fish the Miss. River. Im not looking for locations but more presentations that will be most productive this time of year? Trolling cranks? Were taking a house boat has anyone ever rented one on this lake? Also what is a good electronics chip for this lake? Thanks in advance for the help.

The Navi chip works very good on Lac Suel Deep jigging on the reefs will give you all the success you can handle. If you don’t see fish on your electronics, move to the next reef. Gulp is good!!!! Dog

What dates? I will be up on Sept 26 through Oct 2. Fishing at Chamberlain Narrows. Jigs and minnows have always been best for us in the fall. Find a neck down area, or the first island after a long stright shot and jig. Sometimes you need enough confidence in your spot to stay and wait for the fish. They are moving alot this time of year so sometimes staying put helps them find you. I learned this the hard way and have the gas bills to show for it. PM me if I can help. Great lake!

I have fished Lac Suel in Late September. We did not catch the numbers of fish but caught quality. We found fish really deep or on the slop of fast breaking sand structure. The deep fish were in 40 + ft The sand structures topped out at 10 to 12 feet and dropped int 40 to 75 + deep in about 3 or 4 boat lengths. We got most of the fish jigging with 5 inch white power baits. The fish were regurgitating ciscoes. Be prepared for rapid weather changes. We fished for 4 days the 25th to the 29th 1st day shorts tank top next 2 snowmobile suit and extreme wind. Hi temp38. Last day back to shorts tank top and 70. When you fish deep make sure to set the hook hard but reel in at a snails pace or you will be killing all fish you bring in due to rapid change of depth. I enjoyed the trip. If we would of went a couple weeks later perhaps some fish would start to go shallow chasing the ciscoe and whitefish as they prepare to spawn. Mwal

I have been to Lac Seul a couple times in September. Every thing so far is right on. I have found on the occasional slow day. Fish a lindy type rig straight down 2-3 foot snell red hook and small glow bead. Keep the weight 6 inches above the rocks. This year I want to target very large walleyes. Has anyone trolled large stick baits at night with good results? Best of luck Rodney Bondele

Been there (Ear Falls) 3 times in Sept. and each time has been a jig and minnow bite with plastics a close 2nd. The lodge owner Gary put us on hot spots every day and yours will or should do the same. If he doesn’t know,  call around to other lodges near the areas you will be fishing and ask them what is trippin’ their trigger and what depth. Our best color was flourecent green and chartreuse jigs. Pwr Bait/Gulp minnows worked good too. Most fishing was done in less then 30 ft. Again, if you don’t mark fish move on. Good luck, Jigmup If you head to Ear Falls area:Evergreen lodgeGary & Patty Beardsley(807) 222-35861-888-LAC-SEUL (522-7385) Four Seasons Sport Shop Ear FallsSummer: (807) 222-2200 Winter: (807) 222-3030 Mike & Pam Havenor

Were going the 17th through the 25th. Were going to have two house boats. I didnt plan the trip so Im not sure where were leaving from. Im also looking for big walleyes vs numbers. Even the big girls are deep?

Goota agree with Jigmup…Evergreen Lodge is a great place to fish out of..Gary and Patty are the best. Jiggin with a gulp minnow has produce many walleyes in the 26 to 30 inch range for us over the past 15 summers on that end of the lake. Trolling stick baits will get yo plenty of big walleyss….and lots of pike…all sizes. I have never needed to fish at night in Ontario..but to each their own. The Navionics Chip 2009 works very well for keeping your lower unit safe. Lac Seul can fluctuate 6 to 8 feet from spring to fall…so keep your day trails saved if you choose to venture out at night.

Huntfish, I have been going to Lac Suel for 6 years. I have not gone that late in the year though. But I will try to answer your other questions. The 2 houseboat operations that I am aware of are on the SE side of the lake in the town of Hudson, ON. They are Lac Seul Floating Lodges and Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges. They are literally 20 feet from each other on the same shoreline of Lost Lake (part of Lac Seul). I have been on one before and it was an absolute blast. I look at a lot of websites about Lac Suel and these are the only 2 houseboat operations on Lac Seul that I know of. I do not know of any on the west side of the lake (Ear Falls area). The majority of houseboaters from these operations go up the east to northeast side. Well known areas are Sen Bay, Taylor Island area, Bear Narrows Area, Chamberlain Narrows area, etc. I am assuming that this is the area that you will be fishing. As others have shared I would be willing to bet the jig and minnow will be #1 presentation, gulp/plastics too. But working bottom bouncers and raps will be worth your time as well. I fish in the June and July months mostly and the day bite is all we get. It actually seems they do not bite as well real early or late in the day but that could be different in the fall. Bait fish in Lac Suel is mainly perch, cisco, and whitefish for those big fish. i would target deep reefs (Rainy style) and dying weed lines (Fall Mille Lacs style).
