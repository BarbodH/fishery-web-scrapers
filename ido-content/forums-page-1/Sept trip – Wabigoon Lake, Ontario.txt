This might be a shot-in-the-dark as there’s a LOT of lakes up there. But I was invited to tag along with a few guys up to Wabigoon Lake in Ontario, roughly about an hour south of Lac Seul. Looks like a great Walleye destination along with some big pike, muskie and smallmouth as well. I was able to find a fairly dated thread in the Canadian forum regarding fishing it in July but we’re going up the day after Labor Day.

I don’t have any personal experience with the lake but, a friend of mine has been going there to a resort for 20 years or so in mid summer. About 5 years ago he bought a permanent cabin there. Told me it took a couple years to figure it out and now does well on walleyes, bass, and crappies. His son does well on muskies.

I have been there a couple times mostly summer months. Fished out of Polar Star. They had a great harbor W covered docks and power.
