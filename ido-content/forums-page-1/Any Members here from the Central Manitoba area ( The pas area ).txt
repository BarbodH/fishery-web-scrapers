Just curious if there are any members here that live in or around Central Manitoba. The Pas area to be specific. I’m just curious of what the winter has been like in that area. I would like to know how much snow and ice there is currently. We are in the early stage of planning our Spring trip to that area and are thinking of going up a week or two earlier this year. Knowing the current conditions may help us decide if that is a good idea or not. 

What – No one here from that area. I guess given the population in that area, not much of a surprise. 

You could try post here – there’s a guy who’s pretty active from The Pas.

I spoke with Gerry Angell from Denare Beach almost a month ago. At that time they were dealing with heavy snow, and it sounded like ice fishing basically wasn’t happening because the snow and slush was too thick to get around effectively. I’d imagine The Pas is usually similar since it’s relatively close.
