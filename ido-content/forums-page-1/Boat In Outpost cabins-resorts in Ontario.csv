We would like a boat in outpost cabin or resort. This would be for 2024. We are looking for recommendations from anyone who has done a boat in outpost in the past. I have found a handful online but we would rather get first hand experience recommendations. Thanks for the help! Scott"

I typically stay at a drive to camp on Eagle Lake so I’ve seen the island change quite a bit over the years but only from the water. Good fishing nearby though. I’ve heard a lot of good reviews for Obabikon Bay Camp on LOTW but never stayed there. It’s on my list."

2180871,tsamp,2023-02-10 20:09:00,386, I like Root Bay best. Lots of walleye and northern. Close to outlet dam where you can catch eater walleye on every cast.

Have the lake to your self with plenty of fish to catch: walleyes, SM bass, lake trout and some large pike. You do use their boats and have to bring you own electronics but it was a fun week learning the lake and where the fish are."

Not quite as outpost (off the beaten path) as others may be, as it’s just 40 minutes from the border crossing to the landing, and 7 mile boat ride. Great fishing and very little boat traffic for being so close to Fort Frances/I Falls. Plus Tom is a great host."
2181499,snelson223,2023-02-13 21:01:00,421,Reel Em Inn lodge on Lake of Woods. Its almost an hour boat ride from Morson On. Not very often you see other boats. There is always places to fish even if it’s windy. The staff and food is amazing. We have been going there for 7 years and it’s a trip I don’t want to miss. It’s very hard to get in there cause most people book for the following year when they leave.
