As of April 1 the pre-entry test will no longer be required for fully vaccinated travelers. https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2022/03/government-of-canada-will-remove-pre-entry-test-requirement-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-on-april-1.html

Thatâ€™s great news. One less hoop to have to jump through. Hopefully between now and Early June several other hoops are removed as well.

That is great news. Will the US reciprocate?

Do we still need the ArrivCan app?

Yes. Check out the link stjoeguy posted, everything you need to know is there. Thanks for posting that.

The us does not have any testing for coming into the us via foot or vehicle
