I’ve heard some requirements have gone away this year. How about live bait? Still cannot bring any across the border into Ontario?

Still can not bring any live bait across the border. I asked if he thought crawlers would ever be allowed again, he said no.

That’s ridiculous… Did they let you through?

Yeah, he let us through. Fishing was fantastic!

Thanks guys. We’ll order our crawlers in Fort Frances then. 

I got an email from Ontario about AIS best practices. They say 5-30 days of drying. There’s no way that 6-8 weeks is doable, unless it’s your first trip of the year. But Border Control seems to be able to make it hard for US citizens if they want.
