Read an article in Outdoor News that US anglers can no longer bring in any live,preserved or frozen bait. They listed frozen minnows, crawlers, worms, crayfish etc. They said transfer of invasive species, disease. Also congestion in lines at border and the kicker Americans can afford to buy Canadian bait due to exchange rate. Mwal

Yeah its kinda dumb you cannot bring in crawlers anymore. I mean most of the crawlers you buy here are actually imported FROM Canada for crying out loud.

Really dumb. We had a whole system of salting minnows for the months/weeks leading up to our trips. Will have to spend a lot more on bait now.

I could be wrong but after looking at the 2022 Ontario Recreation Fishing Summary, it does not prohibit brining night crawlers in. It mentions nothing about them from what I read. It did say that no live or dead leeches/minnows are allowed. Would love to hear from someone who has crossed the border or talked to a lodge to clarify that before I bother picking a whole bunch of them for my trip up to Lac Seul near the end of June.

This has been discussed several times on W.C. since the border reopened late last summer. People posted they had to turn around and return to the USA to dispose of their night crawlers then get back in line to go back into Ontario.

Yes, last year while in line at the border that first morning, I watched a guy get sent back to dispose of crawlers. The truck pulled to the side and waited while he hiked it back on foot. Oof. I imagine they’re trying to keep these guys out: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/terrestrialanimals/jumping-worm/index.html For our Lac Suel trip in late June we are just planning to order some from Dutchie’s. Have to stop there to get eggs, milk, and beer anyhow, so no biggie.
