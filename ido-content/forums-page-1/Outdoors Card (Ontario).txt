If a person purchases their Outdoors Card and fishing license online but the card does not arrive on time… is it legal to just have the printed receipt with you as a non-resident? I could not find this called out on their website. I think the odds of being checked where we are going is about 1 in a trillion… but still prefer to be legitimate just-in-case. thanks in advance

when i bought my license online and printed it had both the license and the outdoor card info on it. as long as you have proof you purchased it you will be fine.

Agreed with the above. Last year we printed out the attached file in the confirmation email we got and used that as our outdoor card and fishing license. The outdoor card (good for 3yrs) was mailed to us some time later last year. We keep the outdoor cards in our safe and use them (like this past week) to buy our fishing licenses. We leave on Saturday and will have our outdoor cards that were mailed to us last year, plus the printout of our online fishing licenses purchased.
