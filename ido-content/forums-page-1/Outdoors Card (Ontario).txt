If a person purchases their Outdoors Card and fishing license online but the card does not arrive on time… is it legal to just have the printed receipt with you as a non-resident?
I could not find this called out on their website.
I think the odds of being checked where we are going is about 1 in a trillion… but still prefer to be legitimate just-in-case.

when i bought my license online and printed it had both the license and the outdoor card info on it. as long as you have proof you purchased it you will be fine. 

Agreed with the above.
