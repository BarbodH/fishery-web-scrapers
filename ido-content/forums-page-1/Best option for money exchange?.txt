 We will be heading to Sioux Lookout in july.
What is the best option for money exchange?

I wouldn’t bother exchanging unless you need to pay your outfitter in cash. Most places you stop will accept US dollars, maybe not at the best exchange rate, but they’ll take it. Using your credit card probably gives you the best exchange rate.

 agreed we just use credit cards vs get Canadian dollars. The card company converts it automatically to us dollars.

Order it through your own bank.
