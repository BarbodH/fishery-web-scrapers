Fishing Lac Seul for first time last week of June.

You can not go wrong fishing a jig and a minnow. Go with as light a jig as you can. Lac Seul is one of the easiest lakes to catch walleyes that I have fished. Will be up there 1st week of June. Great place to catch a lot of fish. Plus the lake has not been fished hard the last 2 years with the border closed.

I remember talking to a Lac Seul outfitter at a sport show. I booked the trip and then asked what color jig works best. They said it doesn’t matter. After a week of fishing, they were right, color didn’t matter.

#5 and #7 Jigging raps are killer too, especially if wanting to conserve bait. And the fish him them hard. Very fun.

I will be there that same week – where are you staying? We will be at Scout Lake, so a bit more south by Farewell/McKenzie Bay than Ear Falls but still that end of the lake.
