1437971,Paul Heise,2014-07-06 14:49:00,723,Anybody been up there in the past couple weeks? Have a Family trip planned starting next Saturday! Hows the water temps? Just wondering what type of structure and/or depths the walleyes are hanging around? Might be a little early water temp wise for them to be on mid-lake structure? Fished it for opener and had limited success with the frigid water temps and floating ice chunks! Might go after some Lakers as well. Guessing they will be hanging around the mid-lake sunken islands?
