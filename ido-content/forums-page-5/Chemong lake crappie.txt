Just wonder if other people would consider Chemong lake in Ontario a basin lake. I have had trouble finding the crappie in this lake in the winter. Wondering if I should take a different approach. Thanks!

I don’t know the answer to your question but here’s the map for anyone else wondering where this is. 

Thanks Dave👍🏻
