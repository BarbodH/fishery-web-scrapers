I’m guessing that it has to do with the H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza that has been found in certain areas. It is kind of surprising about the ban because it has been found in Canada already. Has to do with migratory birds like ducks and geese. The closest infected area to Wisconsin is a turkey flock in Pope County, Minnesota. Poultry growers have a legitimate worry with this bird flu because it calls for the complete destruction of the infected flock. In some instances that could break a company. Our annual growers meeting has been postponed because of this outbreak so close us. If someone had been exposed to this flu virus and came to the meeting, it is so infectious it could be transferred to the entire company.

IT is legit I live near the Rainy-Baudette border and there is a sign at customs as well as in the groc stores. Customs officers will ask if you have poultry products during the inspection as well.

Please remember not to bring poultry or eggs. We’ve all ready had several guests have their food confiscated at the border. In Canada we say don’t feed the Bears. I say don’t feed the border guards!
