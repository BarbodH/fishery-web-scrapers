As I stated in other posts I will be fishing the English river and barrel lake on te 1rst week in June. I need to ask will Gapen bottom Walkers perform as good as bottom bouncers at not getting snagged up on the rocks? Also what size would you recommend? Thanks for any info I’m getting revved up to go.

I recommend jigs, all around what is called the mouth of Barrel and the top side of the Press Lake Falls. Just don’t get to close to the falls though. 

Thanks for the info
