Curious what people are thinking for ice out. I got an email from a guest in the 507 area code saying they were ice free last weekend. Lake Nipigon, and Pasha, are roughly 500 miles from him. Safe bet will be ice free the first week in May? What’s everyone seeing?

Chad:

Mark you were probably in my back yard if you were by the dells dam…only about 4 miles away from me…wish I knew you were in the area I would of stopped and said Hi.. Not much ice left here..I put my ice fishing stuff away about 3 weeks ago..
