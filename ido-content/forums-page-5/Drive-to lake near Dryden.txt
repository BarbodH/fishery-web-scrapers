We’re taking our annual one week trip to LacSeul in May, but adding a few days to try a lake or two near Dryden. Looking for nearby lakes to drive to, launch, fish for the day, and try different ones on the next two days. Any suggestions for good pike or smallie lakes for one day trips? Not looking for walleye lakes, as that is our primary target at LacSeul.

 Williams Lake 

Driving up hwy 502 you have several lakes along the road that have always had my interest. Godson being one of them, I second Wabigoon or Dinorwic as well. The end of the lake near Dryden also has some crappies along with good smallie action. I also know Andy Meyers lodge on Eagle offers a 4×4 adventure to some nearby lakes for fantastic smallie fishing. I agree it would be best to call locally to resort or stop in at Canadian Tire and ask some of the salesmen too.

I’m told Wabigoon is good. walleyes,pike and good Muskie. I just keep driving on by. Sure would like to know if it is as good as I’ve heard.

Took a look at Williams Lake. couple things that didn’t work out. they were reluctant to rent for less than a week, and told us that due to low spring water levels, would not be able to boat onto lac Seul. Looked like a nice camp though, and an interesting lake.

I would have to say wabigoon if your looking for something close to Dryden it’s not far at all, or just drive down highway 502 you will find some lakes,or cedar narrows rd it’s a logging rd off the 502 you will find lots of little lakes trout northern bass walleye etc..
