My family and I went on our annual fishing vacation in paradise – northwest Ontario around Nestor Falls/Sioux Narrows. The camp is called Jim’s Caviar Camp and it is located on Caviar Lake. Caviar feeds into Dogpaw Lake which, in turn, feeds into Whitefish Bay of Lake of the Woods. We have been making our annual trip for around 40 years, so we pretty much know where the fish are – although we learn things every year, which makes the fishing new and fun!
