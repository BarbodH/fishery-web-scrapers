Feels good to be back on the IDO Forums! It’s been many many years.. Throwing out a hello, and to share a great day my brother, his gf and myself experienced on a lake that boasts great structure, a lake that typically guys set tents up for perch on… Chasing pike! These fish don’t get BIG but their is an abundance if you pay attention to the structure and contours by looking at lake maps as we did. The flags flew ALL day. 20 landed, 20 lost and 10 missed. Ran through our 5 bags of bait! Thanks image28.jpeg image29.jpeg image30.jpeg image26.jpeg image27.jpeg
