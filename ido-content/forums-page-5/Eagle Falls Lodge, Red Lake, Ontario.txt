Well I figured it would be nice for me to put out a recommendation of Travis and Carrie owners of Eagle Falls Lodge in Red Lake Ontario Canada. I have been to this lodge for the last two years and found it to be such a great experience. This drive to fishing destination is very inexpensive for what is available. 550 miles from Minneapolis and the drive is not very challenging. Arrive Saturday and picked up on their 44ft barge as they call it, and after a 40 minute boat ride you arrive at the lodge.

Did you bring your own boat?

The first year we just used the camp boats, which was just fine. They have 16ft lund boats with 15 and 20hp honda motors. My dad and I didn’t really have a good tow vehicle to make the journey anyways. Last year we brought my dad’s boat just for the sheer comfort aspect. Not to mention we just threw the snap cover on at night and did have to pull any gear out of the boat. They even had power at the dock for charging up the trolling motor batteries. There always seems to be 1 or 2 groups that bring their own boats.
