Any good recommendations for camping on the Canadian side of rainy lake? Would like to have access to power to recharge. Only will be targeting walleye if that helps.

We stayed at Pither Point in Fort Francis on sand bay it was a nice place with full power , I hope the spelling is right ,it’s right off the main road going out of town [north or east] what ever it is. it’s Hwy 11 the kings hiway

Well thats not very good but if you zoom in and go over to the right it’s on the point.right off the river and the bay.

Check out Labelle’s on Northwest Bay.
Dale Labelle is a very good camp operator.

We go to Cascades Camp and we always have ha d great luck for walleye (651-439-5430 winter number) (summer number 807-274-9030)

I would agree with Labelle’s.I spend most of the summer fishing the North arm,Labelle’s is close the good fishing and Dale knows the lake really well.
