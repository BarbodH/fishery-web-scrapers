Any good recommendations for camping on the Canadian side of rainy lake? Would like to have access to power to recharge. Only will be targeting walleye if that helps. Best areas to go? Any other advice? Thanks all

Check out Labelle’s on Northwest Bay. Dale Labelle is a very good camp operator.  http://labellescamp.com/

I would agree with Labelle’s.I spend most of the summer fishing the North arm,Labelle’s is close the good fishing and Dale knows the lake really well. BB2
