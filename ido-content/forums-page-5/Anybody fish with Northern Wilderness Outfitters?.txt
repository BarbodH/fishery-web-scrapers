Thanks

I did a fly in with them last year. Good plane, it went up, it came down twice without incident.  Water was incredibly high when we went but they did everything possible to get us out on time. Cabin was very good. We had a great time.

Peter –

First post, but I have done 2 trips up past birch lake on Carillon Lake, which the cabin burnt down recently. My pops and his best friend hit Tesup Lake (~50 air miles from Ft. Francis, still in the Rainy Lake watershed) every year now and I am going with them this year for my bachelor party. NWO is good people and my dad and his friend rave about how well they treat them. The food package is not only convenient, but a pretty good deal too. Cabin and amenities were good. Boats ran fine. They like 14-16’ers w/6hp Yammies, so you aren’t getting anywhere fast. 

You will love Tesup.
