I’m looking for a group of 2-3 people who would like to accompany with me and a buddy to northern Ontario. We will be leaving on the 22nd of August and returning to the states on the 30th. This is a trip I’ve made 28 times and haven’t been for 3 years and itching to go. We travel over 150 miles on good gravel one way, haul all of our supplies with us, 150 miles to closet store. I will give you all the details if you’re interested. Costs from Iowa about $500per person which includes gas to and from, boat gas, food for the week and camping permits. It’s nice to do this trip with another vehicle and boat because of the distance from civilization. You will need a truck, boat, tent and maybe a few other items. Looking for a group that’s willing to get along and have fun. Send me a private message.
