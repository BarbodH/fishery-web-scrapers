What a year in 2015 â€“ record breaking fish, new waters and even better adventures. A torn bicep and resulting surgery did little to hold us back in offering our guests the best year yet of fishing and hunting in NW Ontario. Man I am looking for to 2016! Happy New Year everyone and please stay tuned as this season and all its wonderfulness unfolds!
