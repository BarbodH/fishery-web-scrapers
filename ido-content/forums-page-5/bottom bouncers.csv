1537929,Joe Zalewski,2015-04-25 18:32:00,9,As I stated in other posts I will be fishing the English river and barrel lake on te 1rst week in June. I need to ask will Gapen bottom Walkers perform as good as bottom bouncers at not getting snagged up on the rocks? Also what size would you recommend? Thanks for any info I’m getting revved up to go.
