 We are planning a trip to Lac Seul and wonder when the lake will be ice free.

Just sent a text to my in-laws in Dryden. They have had rain the past 2 days along with heavy winds. They live on Lake Wabigoon and that is reported ice free for the past 5 days. Lac Seul should be ice free after the weather the recent couple of days. Best I could come up with!

Two of us are heading out on Sunday, a few days ahead of the rest of our group. Staying near Mahkwa the normal week, but still white ice as of yesterday, according to our camp owner. Not looking good for sunday or monday, but should be ok by weekâ€™s end (we hope!). lac Seul is open in the Ear Falls area, per a camp owner there. May spend our first few days there, instead, like we did last year.
