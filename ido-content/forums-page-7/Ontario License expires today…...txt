The 2012 Ontario fishing license expires today at midnight, so if you are planning on heading to Ontario for any fishing in 2013, here is the simple online license application.

I am not sure about the 2013 licenses but I remember in 2012 when you purchased your non-resident license online they never mailed you the actual license. You had to print up the copy after it was purchased. It wasn’t really clear you had to do this and there wasn’t even a place to sign. For 2013 maybe it is more clear now. Also, remember your Ontario Outdoors card is required along with your license.
