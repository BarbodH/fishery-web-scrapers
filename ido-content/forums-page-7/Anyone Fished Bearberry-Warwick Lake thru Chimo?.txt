We’re going up there this summer and I’m just wondering if anyone has any experience with the lake. We’ve done plenty of fly-ins, and a few other lakes through Chimo Lodge, so I’m mainly just looking for fishing reports/experiences/stories. It looks like a really big deep lake, are there any lakers in there? How are the portage lakes? Thanks guys!
