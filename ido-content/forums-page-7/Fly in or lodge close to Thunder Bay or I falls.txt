Starting to research a trip to Canada in June 2014. Prefer not to drive way north into the country. 6 guys minimum. Don’t want to haul boats or food. Walleye, smallies and pike would be nice. Looking at fishing 4 days or 5 days max. We are not looking to do it on the cheap. Comfortable accommodations, nice boats with depth finders (gps?) and great food are a must. fly in or lodge. Any recommendations would be appreciated. I can PM my physical address for brochures or email to [email protected]Thank you

Vic Davis at Northern Wilderness Outfitters out of Fort Frances will not let you down. Awesome family business! I’m pretty sure they have a website to check to see if it’s something you’re looking for.
