1218528,dgilgen,2013-06-04 13:00:00,82,"Heading up for our annual Canadian fishing trip June 14th.  We normally camp at Abram Lake Park but bit the bullet this year and we will be staying in a cabin at Northern Sunrise, just outside the Rice River Sanctuary. Anybody ever stay here before? Looking for some inside info, if possible? Also, is there a good place online to find the latest fishing reports and current water temps for the Abram Lake and Lake Minnitaki area? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks IDOers!"
