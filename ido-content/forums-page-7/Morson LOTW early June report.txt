Had a great weekend of fishing! Caught walleyes trolling spinners/bouncers with minnows and crawlers or jigging. About any point on the windward side of the Sunset channel and up north of the channel held fish. Also fished up buy Firebag and Rubber island. Left lots of fish behind/threw back a lot of nice eaters. Biggest was only about 22″, but lots that size down to 15.” Most of our fish came in 17 feet, but also caught them in about 10 feet Sunday morning. 

Those Rapala rigs were probnably from the “Scatter Rap” Challenge taking place 6/5 – 6/10.

Shows on their web banner it’s 6/17 – 21. Wonder if they’re pre-fishing or if the event is done earlier and then posted?
