On a trip this summer a guy from our group was stopped and he had to turn around for the same reason.

 As is typical of the Canadians and thier attitude toward Americans, it is very difficult to find an authoritative CANADIAN source of information that clearly lays out the rules on this. I did some research on this a couple of years back after we found out that a member of one of our regular Canadian trips had a DUI. While technically this “no entry” law has been on the books for a long time, the Canadians had no real way of checking until about 5 years ago. What I found indicated that the “limit” is 10 years AFTER completion of your sentence (including fines, jail time, community service, suspension, etc) as outlind in this article: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g153339-c49436/Canada:Dwi.Or.Dui.Driving.Convictions.html# Here’s another article that cites a Canadian source: http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/travel/102215924.html I found lots of US sites stating that after 10 years, you’re fine to enter with no special permission, but trying to find the equivilent information on a CANADIAN government site such that it can be relied on and pointed to as the rule in this matter is damn near impossible. There’s a Canadian consulate office in Minneapolis. My suggestion would be to email them and clearly lay out your situation and ask if you are now permitted to enter Canada with no waivers or other special permissions. Hopefully they will reply and then you’ll have them on the record. Or if you’re feeling confident that you’re beyond the entry ban period, you could go for it and hope there are no issues. Everything depends on how much of an iron-clad source you need to feel comfortable. Grouse

My understanding is they go back 10 years, but I’d contact the Canadian dept of tourism and get it first hand. Al

You might want to check out this website. It is not an official Canadian Government website but rather an Canadian Immigration website. They say that that you have been deemed rehabilitated after 10 years if you have only had one incident on your record. I would have to think you are good to go with all that time since the DUI. With that said, I would still double check with a government office to see if that is correct. You could check with the consulate like suggested above. It would not be fun to be stopped and turned around at the border. I think you are good to go though. DUI Canada

 Any idea how recent his DUI was or if he has multiple DUI’s? It also says it may take a longer time to be rehabilitated if you have had more than one DUI.

SteveO: On a recommendation from who/where I don’t remember, make sure you have a passport and good picture id, then I was told if you can have the info regarding your incident that that was better than to attempt go through the payment or filing of the rehab info… I wasn’t able to get all of my info from two, one in 81 and 83, but I had it available in a folder, didn’t drive, looked the officer in the eye, answered questions politely and got in both times… Didn’t mean that they might not have sent me back, but… Mark

I have deer hunted the past two seasons in Canada and I will say this, do everything you can to have all your questions answered and documented. Both years we saw guys who paid good money to go on deer hunts who thought they took care of everything turned away at the border.

I do not understand the DUI laws entering Canada, have been going for the last 15 years and my buddy has had two DUI and never an issue with him getting in. I am sure the last one is at least 10 years ago. We go through pembina into manitoba. Does it matter what province you enter?

DWI’s are considered a felony in Ontario so it’s much more serious of a crime than in the US. There’s some info at this site http://www.nwota.com/node/49 and includes a phone number for the Fort Frances and Thunder Bay CBSA offices. Call them and get the real info based on your situation. There’s also info on the Fort Frances office here: http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/contact/listing/offices/office301-e.html Many people get are lucky to get across each year but a lot get caught and are sent back ruining their trip and their buddies too. BTW if you try to get across by lying get ready for this –>  because they are searching very thoroughly.

i went to canada this fall on a caribou hunt and i got a DUI just over 5 years ago, the guy that arganized th hunt has been to canada on hunting trips just about every year for the past 20 and this is what i was told. if you have had a dui within 5 years you are not getting in if it is over 5 years have some info on you incase they need any of the information (most likely wont he has seen only once where info was needed, dates and punishment), in your case you should get waved right through without even a question about it. if you did happen to get a DUI within the 5 years you can fly in get picked up by your buddies and ride back with them to the USA they do not check for DUI info when flying in. in my case i was asked several question like when i got my DUI and if i had ever been arrested for anything else. then was okayed to cross into canada. this is what i was told was going to happen and what has happened to everybody i know that has crossed with a DUI. good luck fishing

I’m kinda thinking that getting a DUI almost a qtr century ago probably isn’t going to matter. I have a passport and feel better now

I live on the border and have crossed hundreds of times for business, work and recreational reasons. As much as anything, it depends on the customs person who checks you in, and quite possibly their mood on a given day. Certain officials might check or ask about certain things or follow different procedures. Or they might notice something on the computer screen as they enter your passport or license plate number they want to ask about. And it’s no different coming back into the US. As much as you want it to be objective, much of a crossing interview can be subjective.

There has been a lot of talk on this subject lately on walleyecentral.com. The Canadian government apparently is looking into relaxing thier position on this issue.

As a general rule of thumb for any laws/regulations in Canada, you need to be legal in the jurisdiction where you come from. Of course, don’t take this as gospel, because some exceptions will apply. (e.g. You can’t hunt under the age of 16 in Ontario regardless if it’s legal in your home state.) As an example, if you are required to have a DL in the state of MN to operate a water craft, you’ll need it in Canada. Also – there has been a lot of questions about the boaters safety rules in Canada. It is important for you to know that the rules DO NOT apply to people in Canada for less than 45 days. However, as stated above, you will need to be legal as if you were fishing in your own jurisdiction. Lastly – the rumors you are hearing about border crossings are absolutely correct. Canada has significantly relaxed the crossing rules. People with DUI’s less than 5 years old, can now enter Canada on a Temporary Visitor Pass. You still may be required to go through the application process for “rehabilitation” and pay the $200 fee after your trip, but now the CBSA (Canadian Boarder Service Agency) has much more discretion to allow you entry. Ok – one more thing. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE DUI OR FELONY YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED ENTRY REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG AGO IT HAPPENED . Some people may get through from time to time without being checked, but if you get stopped, you will be denied access if you have multiple offenses. Call me anytime with questions – 715 817 4161 or 866 333 5943 Chad

Lots of good discussion here. I’m also happy to answer any questions on this topic, as it’s a specific issue I have worked on. One thing for certain, if someone wants to make an application, it’s best to start very early. Wish folks the best as the ice melts!
