If you had to limit yourself to one Plano tackle box (11″ x 7.25″ x 2.75″ – Deep StowAway Utility Box), and you wanted to put the top producing walleye lures in it, what would you absolutely have to have?

I do this one every year. It’s also my set up for a canoe when I can’t bring the world. Jigs and minnow if possible. If not, moxies and Pulse-Rs. RapalasShad rap, black and white #8, bring 2Shad rap, blue and white #8Minnow raps, black and white, perch patterns, blue if room available. both sizesDeep husky jerks – brown and black 2 hook(x2), if later in season bring the 3 treble version in addition.Shallow husky jerks for pike/walleye – Blue and silver size 13 or next size smaller Tail dancer – shad pattern adn/or blue and white. Live bait rigs or components to make rigs. Pretty easy to take some line off the spool and tie one up. If it’s a pike trip I will add spoons, one or two bucktails, glidin’ rap, leaders, more shallow husky jerks, deep tail dancers. What I don’t bring – Xraps, for some reason just can’t seem to catch walleye on them. God I miss Canada  The next trip can’t come soon enough. Just realized this post was from Chad. I would bring those orange/yellow fireball jigs. Rumor has it they kill the walleye in his area.

English river, Jigs,Jigs, and more Jigs. Your going to lose alot in the rocks, but man is it fun bangin them on the head with a jig. We use frozen suckers,shiners,plastics, gulp. They all produce. Can not really pinpoint color.

What’s the water color? Is it that deep gold ore or the clearer waters, they can vary and do make a difference.

That question is very easy… 1. White Zoom flukes; both baby and regular size.2. White 4″ twister tails.3. H2O 1/8 oz to 1/4 oz jig heads. Have caught countless Canadian Pickeral with these combinations. I wouldn’t bother with live bait rigs or any crankbait type lures.

Jointed rapala #7 Fl. Orange red with some 1 1/2oz BBs that I would duct tape to outside of box  and lots of Berkeley gulp minnow grub in fl. Orange. And whatever 1/4oz jigheads in fl. Orange or green or yellow I can find cheaply. Blue Original rapalas or husky jerks would need to be in there as well.

KWP – Man o Man… below is just a sample of my go to… Probably a little overkill for most, but I am fishing from May to November so I need to keep mine with seasonal transitions in mind .

Come on Chad…this could be your new marketing campaign. All you need to catch fish at Pasha are a couple of jigs. To be quite honest..the last time I was at Pasha for a strictly fishing trip I hauled up my entire arsenal, and only used 2 jigs for the week. Oh…and I caught a ton of walleye. What have you been doing all winter Chad?

Not much unfortunately… although I am at the point where I am ready to be back on the water… like, yesterday! Look forward to fishing with you this year… it’s been awhile since you blessed us with your presence!
