If you had to limit yourself to one Plano tackle box (11″ x 7.25″ x 2.75″ – Deep StowAway Utility Box), and you wanted to put the top producing walleye lures in it, what would you absolutely have to have? 

Don’t for get to specify colors 

I do this one every year. It’s also my set up for a canoe when I can’t bring the world. 

English river, Jigs,Jigs, and more Jigs. Your going to lose alot in the rocks, but man is it fun bangin them on the head with a jig. 

What’s the water color? Is it that deep gold ore or the clearer waters, they can vary and do make a difference.

That question is very easy…

Jointed rapala #7 Fl. Orange red with some 1 1/2oz BBs that I would duct tape to outside of box  and lots of Berkeley gulp minnow grub in fl. Orange. And whatever 1/4oz jigheads in fl. Orange or green or yellow I can find cheaply. Blue Original rapalas or husky jerks would need to be in there as well.



KWP –

Don’t forget my tools –

1 jig tied to the rod, 1 jig in the box….gotta save room for beverages!! 

Oh you guy you… you silly man… just because you kill big bears doesn’t mean you get to be a smarta$$ about fishing 

Come on Chad…this could be your new marketing campaign. All you need to catch fish at Pasha are a couple of jigs. 

Not much unfortunately… although I am at the point where I am ready to be back on the water… like, yesterday! Look forward to fishing with you this year… it’s been awhile since you blessed us with your presence!
