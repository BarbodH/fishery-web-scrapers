The Greenback run on the red has been great this year…fish 26″-32″ have are being caught on a regular basis. Still time to fish out of Selkirk or Pine falls areas, most big ones are caught on a jig and salted minnow but some are having success trolling cranks like shad raps or something similar.

Nice Fish! I love that pronounced green on their backs. I have to get up there one of these days.

Welcome to IDO Topwater…I have heard the bite this fall has been great for a long time. Will this bite last right up to freeze up?

Those greenbacks are amazing looking fish. I’ve never made an open water trip for them but have added that trip to the bucket list.

Love the greenbacks. I need to hit the fall run one of these years. I’ll be seeing you greenies in early Jan and late March.

Yeah…the bite will be great right till she freezes over,and once it does I’m sure the first ice bite will be fantastic. Right now the current is lite so it should be a nice quick freeze-up.
