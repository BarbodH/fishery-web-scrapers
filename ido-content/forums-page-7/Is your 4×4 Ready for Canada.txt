With end of the ice fishing season looming in the close future, it’s a great time to start putting together a must do list for this year’s trip to Canada. That list should involve getting your vehicle prepped. Get the proper paperwork  – registration, license, up-to-date insurance and emergency contact info Tools – Tire plug kit, utility knife, auto fuses, tape, tire pressure gauge, extra flash lights (with batteries), ratchet straps ( you can never have too many ), air compressor, 4 way tire iron ( I personally use a cordless impact wrench ), light bulbs, mat to lay on, bug spray, TP, rags, basic tools, heavy duty tow strap, spare key Check – your tires, including your spare tire.  Important Note : Take the time to lower the spare tire to insure the storage cable is working properly – especially you Chevy/GMC owners out there. 90% of them fail and you can’t get the tire down… speaking from personal experience Replace your air filter Trailers – get an extra set of bearings for your trailer… it’s a must! Check lights and uneven tire wear. Check your spare tire and I recommend you bring two spares I have a whole packing list I sent out to my guests… if you’re interested in getting a copy, PM or email me [email protected] Good luck!

 I recommend adding an extra hub and some grease to that list as well. That is similar to my Rainy River checklist… thats written down… in my head.
