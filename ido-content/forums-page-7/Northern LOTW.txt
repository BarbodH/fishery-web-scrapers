Any one been in the Northern region of LOTW since ice out? We are headed up there in 10 days and couldn’t come fast enough. We are hoping to be able to cast the shallows and shoreline for everything. We are optimistic that the late spring will make the fishing epic.

Made a short trip just across the border this last weekend. Not on LOTW but found walleyes eager to hit plastics. Used mostly Bfishin moxies, paddletails, and a few pulse-r’s in many colors. A plastics bit is always fun to be on! Finding water above 50 degrees was key, and a little current was a plus. The warmer the water the faster the fish will chase a bait! We had to fish the wind blown, white capped, shorelines. The calm sides had 0 fish around them. Cast up basicly on shore and start with more of a slow drag out with maybe a up jig or 2 at random. Good luck and have fun!

Good to know, I am well stocked up with those. Did you run into any northerns?

Plenty! Lots around 20-27, Even ended up with a few in the mid 30’s and one at 39. Using the same technique.

Awesome, we are hoping to get a good mix of walleyes, smallies and northerns while casting. We are thinking of checking out Pow bay, bear bay and/or yellow girl bay to see what kind of action is going on in the shallow bays.
