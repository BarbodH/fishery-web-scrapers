Our group of 5 just reurned friday from 5 days at Gawleys Little Beaver Lodge on Lac Seul and we had a great week of fishing even though it took some work to find them. Most of the usual spots we could not get a bite going on even the big sand banks didn’t produce a fish, although the wind wasn’t blowing in there either. We found quite a few fish from 14″ to 24″ in 32′ of water in Mackenzie bay a couple days and 1 day the wind was blowing about 15mph and we anchored and pitched jigs ontop of the shallow reefs and banged em up all the way up to 26″another great year can’t wait to go again next YEAR. 

a great fishing destination..any bigs 1’s or pictures ?? did you try pine point ?

Thanks for the post…Great memories on that lake.

Thanks for the report, and reminder of what a great fishery that is, any time of the year …only 9 more months and counting till we go back in May.

Some nice catches there.

It seems every year when we go to canada nothing is the same as far as a pattern. We usually start out in the good spots from the year before and they aren’t as hot as we remember so we find new places and usually different depths till we find a pattern. I guess thats called fishing. Where do you go on Rainy? I have always wondered about a trip there. 

The bays I typically work are Rice, Moran’s, Swell, and Grassy Portage. Occasionally I’ll meander over to Commisioner’s or head up to Crowrock and Redgut.
