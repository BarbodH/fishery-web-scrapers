Our group of 5 just reurned friday from 5 days at Gawleys Little Beaver Lodge on Lac Seul and we had a great week of fishing even though it took some work to find them. Most of the usual spots we could not get a bite going on even the big sand banks didn’t produce a fish, although the wind wasn’t blowing in there either. We found quite a few fish from 14″ to 24″ in 32′ of water in Mackenzie bay a couple days and 1 day the wind was blowing about 15mph and we anchored and pitched jigs ontop of the shallow reefs and banged em up all the way up to 26″another great year can’t wait to go again next YEAR.

Some nice catches there. I was on Rainy that same week. Since none of the usual haunts were producing we did a lot of exploring. Caught a few here and there while dragging bottom in the middle of the bays. Going back for another 10 days in a couple weeks. Hopefully the water temps have dropped and the fish are moving again.

It seems every year when we go to canada nothing is the same as far as a pattern. We usually start out in the good spots from the year before and they aren’t as hot as we remember so we find new places and usually different depths till we find a pattern. I guess thats called fishing. Where do you go on Rainy? I have always wondered about a trip there.

The bays I typically work are Rice, Moran’s, Swell, and Grassy Portage. Occasionally I’ll meander over to Commisioner’s or head up to Crowrock and Redgut. If those aren’t producing and we have time, we also hike a bit farther north to Big Sawbill lake and pull a lot of Perch and big Pikes.
