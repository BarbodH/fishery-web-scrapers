Got home from lake Michigan, had about a two week gap to get a bunch of work done at work and at home, on top of getting rigged up for my first trip to Canada! Worked a 4 day 73 hour work week and did a training burn with the fire dept and also the National Night Out on top of all of that, then left the next morning. I went up with the girlfriend and her family for their annual trip to Canada. We stayed at Open Bay Lodge on Lac Des Mille Lac. The experience was about everything I imagined Canada to be. Caught a lot of fish, ate a lot of fish, scenery was breathtaking, just like fishing in the BWCAW and had some excellent shore lunches.

Thanks for the report. We used to go to Open Bay Lodge a couple times a year. Brings back a lot of good memories. Sounds like your group had a good time also.
