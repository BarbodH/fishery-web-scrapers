Got word the ice is off our favorite spot! Headed to the Northwest Bay of Rainy! And another favorite little lake! Leaving in just over 24 hrs.  Forecast looks better than it did a week ago so we are going for it! Anybody else headed up?

Hey Paul —

Hoping to spend some time up that way in June too… Hoping to spend some time up in red gut…

We’re a little further north, so our ice went completely off Saturday. Would imagine that most lakes on our parallel and just north of us are ice off as well.
