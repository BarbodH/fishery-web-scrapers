About any point on the windward side of the Sunset channel and up north of the channel held fish. Also fished up buy Firebag and Rubber island. Left lots of fish behind/threw back a lot of nice eaters. Biggest was only about 22″, but lots that size down to 15.” Most of our fish came in 17 feet, but also caught them in about 10 feet Sunday morning. Also caught a lot of smallies and few northerns in the same areas. Mostly caught the smallies on crankbaits and ringworms. Saw a bunch of Rapala vehicles at customs in Baudette. Maybe they’re on their way pre-fishing? Back up Thursday night."
