So what does it mean to enter the War Room at PLC? Well, let’s explain it like this. 

chad happy to see how well you are doing. Ken’s brother Mike shore acres. 

WOW.. there is a blast from the past! I miss my Mille Lacs days greatly, and I’m very thankful for them. It was the spring board that inspired me to pull the trigger on Canada. Tell Kenny and Kay I say hi and hope you guys come up to visit soon
