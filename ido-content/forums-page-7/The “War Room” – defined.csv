It’s the local where lake maps are scrutinized, hot spots are revealed, travel itineraries are created and (for a small under the table fee) you might even get a waypoint. But take caution! If you enter the War Room, you may never come out the same. Because a person leaving the war room, leaves with one mission and one mission only.  To access and exploit one of the most prolific watersheds known to North America. Getting there? Well, that can be tough, for once you exit the War Room , you’ll be asked to go where there are no boat landings or paved roads. If you’re lucky enough to find the lake, you’ll note immediately there isn’t a sole for miles. In fact, the closest above water life form may be a moose sauntering through the weedy shallows, out for his morning breakfast. Be sure to grab your camera, for the pristine shorelines are as they were created millions of years ago, absent of any cabins or boat houses. But under the water, right beneath your boat, there is a ravenous and dark underworld that would evoke fear into Freddy Kruger himself.  It’s full of scavengers and beasts that are constantly on the prowl with one thing on their mind… FOOD! A brave sole may stick his toe in the water for a second, but to gamble any longer could result in swift amputation. For a genetic blueprint of survival has been passed along for millions of years in these creatures of a finned nature. They survive as opportunists and on relentless feeding. So be warned! The War Room is the gateway; the key to unlocking the success formula in the dangerous, fish infested waters that surround PLC. But if you’re invited into this special place, prepare yourself, for many have come and been ultra successful. And, although physically they may be gone, mentally they’ll be here forever! A la, Hotel California! Until next time…"
