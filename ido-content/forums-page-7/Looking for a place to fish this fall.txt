I have been fishing LOW for the past 8 years and was thinking of changing up a bit and trying another lake. Looking for a great pike lake for a fall fishing trip. Thinking about Rainy – any ideas and places to stay would be appreciated.

For me low is my second love in the fall. I can’t imagine going anywhere else. Good luck on your search.

Mille Lacs in the fall is hard to beat for Pike. Pretty good size with the opportunity to stick a monster Muskie also.

I hit upper red,lotw and rainy river for my fall trip. Can’t go wrong. Rainy is awesome too. The thunderbird is great to stay at. Their restaurant is very good. Also check out the border bar they have crazy huge burgers and awesome pizza. I know every year there are some monster walleyes and pike caught there in the fall.
