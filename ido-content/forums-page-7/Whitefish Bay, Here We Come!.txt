Heading up for 3 days of lake trout fishing tomorrow. We stay on Sabaskong Bay and run up to Whitefish to hopefully pound the lakers. We might try fishing walleyes on Miles Bay, but sometimes it’s hard to leave Whitefish when the trout fishing is so good.

Good luck…hope you just hammer them!Dont think i could sleep the night before either due too all the excitment!   

Sounds like a good time and Good Luck!
