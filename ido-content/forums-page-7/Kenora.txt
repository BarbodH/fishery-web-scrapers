I am going on my yearly house boat trip out of Kenora the first week in June and I am a little nervous we are going to need our ice augers.. Anyone know how much ice there is in Kenora and the northern lotw region?

June is still a long ways off with some really long days of sun. Just got this from Sportsman’s up on LOTW:

Awesome. I’m super pumped, this late spring should make the fishing epic the first week in June.
