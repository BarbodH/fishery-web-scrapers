I am going on my yearly house boat trip out of Kenora the first week in June and I am a little nervous we are going to need our ice augers.. Anyone know how much ice there is in Kenora and the northern lotw region?

June is still a long ways off with some really long days of sun. Just got this from Sportsman’s up on LOTW: Sportsman’s Lodge Rainy River Location:The Rainy River, Four Mile Bay, Zippel Bay and Lighthouse Gap are completely wide open and the lake keeps opening more and more each day. We expect to have plenty of great spots open for walleye opener this weekend!

Awesome. I’m super pumped, this late spring should make the fishing epic the first week in June.
