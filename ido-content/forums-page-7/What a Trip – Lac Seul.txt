Well, There is walleye fishing, and than there is Lac Seul. Mark, Jerry, Sean his nephew, Nate, dad, and I just got back from a week in Ontario. We stayed at Mahkwa Lodge which is located in the mid to SE portion of the lake. The first time I went to Mahkwa was with Brent and my dad back in 2004 or 2005. Those first few trips we had to actually load all our stuff into our boats and boat to camp. Over the years things have gradually changed. In fact, this year for the first time the road to camp was actually graded and it was a smooth trip in. This is was a very pleasant surprise because the road used to be so rough that it would add about an hour to the trip. In terms of volume, this was the best fishing trip I have ever been on. We fished for five days and boated 832 walleyes between two boats and six guys. The fish up there must have plenty of forage because they were very fat, very healthy, and very strong. It literally was like catching fall fish, as many of them spit out smelt or shiners as they came to the boat. We tried a little trolling and a little bit of pulling blades to switch it up, but 95 % of our fishing was jig fishing. We fished both minnows and crawlers, but it really didn’t seem to matter. We caught fish in every class up to 27 inch. This was a great trip and I hope to go back again in the near future. You have to literally be there and live it to comprehend how unreal the bite really is. We didn’t run into a trophy but a ton of quality fish. 832 fish/5 days = 166.4 fish a day 166.4 fish/9 hours a day =18.48 fish and hour The highlight of the trip came when Sean hooked his three big fish. Sean has not spent a whole lot of time walleye fishing so this was a new experience for him. He was able to land a 25.5 incher, a 26, and a 27 (with a 36 inch bonus pike). The smile on his face was priceless. Until next time – tight lines
