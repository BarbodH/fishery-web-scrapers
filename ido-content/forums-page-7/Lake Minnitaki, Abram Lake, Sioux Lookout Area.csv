Heading up this July. Trying to plan a location and get a booking in the near future. Looking to get away from the NW section of Lac Suel for some different scenery."
939016,Bob Schultz,2011-02-18 21:02:00,730,"We stay at Northumbrian Resort on Abrams Lake. We always go around the 10th of June. Walleye fishing is excellent with good numbers. Generally the large fish during our trip is right around 27 inches. We don’t get after the bass or pike much, but always catch some while targeting the walleye. We have caught pike to 38 inches. I believe there is also a decent trout fishery, but we haven’t every really tried for them. For the most part we fish the chute right where Minnitaki dumps into Abrams and then up into Minnitaki. If you are looking for solitude where you will be off by yourself this isn’t the place as there are quite a few resorts."
939065,silverstreak,2011-02-18 23:12:00,250,Stayed on minnitaki 3 times and always had good fishing. twice in late june and once in mid july. going again mid june can’t wait
