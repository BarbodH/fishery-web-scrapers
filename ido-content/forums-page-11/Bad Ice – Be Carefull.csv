The ice has taken a turn for the worse the past week or so and it is very week especially west shorelines facing east. A buddy mines neighbor went through the ice 3 days ago on his 4 wheeler on a lake in front of his house. Last year they were fishing on it April 14. Also, the lake is 1 hr. north of I. Falls. If you do go, make sure you watch for holes. I guess on their lake there are holes everywhere anywhere from 1ft. to 6ft. across. If it were me I would stay off the ice until next year. Be Safe."
