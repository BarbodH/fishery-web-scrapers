I just got back last week and I’m have heard that they will let you in no problem, it’s getting back in where they make it hard. I do know someone that did not have one and they gave him a warning until next time.

technically you need a passport, and seeing how those border agents can be, i wouldn’t risk it. you can always pay the extra money and have it rushed.

Yeah, the thing is it’s a last minute trip leaving Tuesday. I don’t think I can get it rushed to me by Tuesday!

A birth certificate will help. You have too have the proof of being a US citizen.

I have heard the twin cities has a same day passport service now. Don’t know where or how to find it, maybe an online search would find it, or someone else on here knows.

I called Int.National Falls U.S. customs last week. My grandson (16) unexpectadly is going with me next Monday, no passport. We applied the week before but didn’t rush it. Anyway the officer I talked to said there was no way they would keep a citizen from entering as long as we had the birth certificate. He said we might get chewed a bit but that was it. Also having the application reciept would help. d.j.

Found this on the net.This should helpDowntown Minneapolis office WASHINGTON -– U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced today that, after advocating strongly for a passport office in Minnesota, the U.S. State Department has opened its first domestic passport issuance facility in Minneapolis. The Minneapolis Passport Agency is located at 212 South Third Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. It is designed to provide in-person passport services to American citizens throughout the North Central border region. The office will be able to serve U.S. citizens who have urgent or emergency travel needs, with the capability to issue passport books and passport cards on-site to qualified applicants. “This new office means that Minnesotans will finally have convenient access to passport services,” said Klobuchar. “This access is especially important because of our border with Canada and the substantial international travel that goes through the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport.” Klobuchar added: “The constituent service staff in my Minnesota office has been very busy helping people with passport issues, because a high demand for passports has caused processing delays. Even with this new office, I want Minnesotans to know that they can continue to contact my state office if they need help.” Previously, Minnesotans who needed passports immediately had to fly to the passport office in Chicago for expedited service. Regular passport applications will continue to be processed through passport centers in Seattle and Charleston, NC.
