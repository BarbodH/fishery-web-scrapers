Hello – I have been invited to a trip to Lake of the Woods and it is last minute but I don’t have a passport. Is there ANYWAYS of crossing into Canada without a passport? THanks.

I just got back last week and I’m have heard that they will let you in no problem, it’s getting back in where they make it hard. I do know someone that did not have one and they gave him a warning until next time.

technically you need a passport, and seeing how those border agents can be, i wouldn’t risk it. you can always pay the extra money and have it rushed.

Yeah, the thing is it’s a last minute trip leaving Tuesday. I don’t think I can get it rushed to me by Tuesday!

A birth certificate will help. You have too have the proof of being a US citizen.

Call the US border/customs… Get your answer/options right for the source.

I have heard the twin cities has a same day passport service now. Don’t know where or how to find it, maybe an online search would find it, or someone else on here knows.

I called Int.National Falls U.S. customs last week. My grandson (16) unexpectadly is going with me next Monday, no passport. We applied the week before but didn’t rush it. Anyway the officer I talked to said there was no way they would keep a citizen from entering as long as we had the birth certificate. He said we might get chewed a bit but that was it. Also having the application reciept would help. d.j.
