Canada’s Lake Wabigoon Fishing Report. Well it’s been said that it was cold over the New Year Holiday; however I think that is an understatement!!!! I had the privilege of heading up North to visit family, friends, and sneak away for a little fishing…I will apologize up front for no pictures, at -15 to -20 below nothing works except for the important things…Auger, flasher, and Otter fish house. Lake Wabigoon has over 50000 acres to fish and 100’s of islands to navigate around. Having the relatives living on the lake allows me a chance to eliminate water and head to an area that fish have been caught recently. During this cold weather not even the locals don’t go out fishing, so I basically had this entire lake to myself. I would compare this lake to Rainy Lake, so taking some of Chris Granruds tips with me; I decided to fish it the same way. Find a reef and drill a few holes to look for fish on the flasher. Well it didn’t take long. This lake is full of small saugers and walleyes in the 8-10 in range, whitefish, and perch are also the main food source. Setting up on the edge of the reef proved to be the best during the midday fishing (18-20 fow), as the afternoon/evening bite approached we moved up onto the top edge of the reef (13-15 fow). Aggressively jigging 1/8 oz lighting spoons tipped with a minnow head seemed to draw these surprisingly aggressive fish into the area. Even with the cold front passing through these fish were very aggressive. We also did set up a few set lines that did catch a few fish as well, however the majority of the fish did come on the jigging spoons. Each afternoon we caught about 10 walleyes with a few saugers mixed in as well. For the conditions and never fishing this lake before I thought that was a successful evening. Lake Wabigoon is located near Dryden Ont. it’s about a 2 hour drive north of International Falls, MN. This lake is also the lake that the former PWT held a few tourneys on. This is a fantastic fishery. It has Muskie, Pike, Walleye, and Smallmouth. Wabigoon Lake doesn’t have a ton of resorts on the lake so really you’re getting a true wilderness experience while fishing. I know I will be back up later this spring to try my luck again and hopefully we have a little bit more balmy weather. Sunset Country, Ontario Canada

I was wondering where the heck you were. When you say set lines do you mean flaging tape and a willow branch  Sounds like fun

 No they have upgraded to rods and reels now….No longer are they using the willow branches and red tape….I even got my father in law to use a flasher aka “cheaters” to the locals ….huge improvement.
