We are having trouble with our present fri-fri camp.our younger guys want sat-sat camp,Does anyone have aq good recomendation? We presently go to lac seul but are open to other top notch water.THANKS for your help. Tom



If walleyes are your game I would recommend Pasha Lake Cabins. We were up there this summer and the walleye fishing is fantastic and I would recommend them in a heartbeat. If you go, be sure to fish Lake Onaman. 

Thanks James!we are a walleye group but a little smallmouth action would be good.

Hi Tom. Its Chad from Pasha. If you would like, I can call you to discuss some options. If we are a good fit for you great. If not I should be able to point you in the right direction. I am a little limited on communication so if you could email me [emailÂ protected] I can call you
