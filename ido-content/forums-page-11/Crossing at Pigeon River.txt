I went on my annual trip to Canada last week through Pigeon River. All I can say is WOW. I think we were at the window for less than 15 seconds. I went to hand the lady our passports and she didn’t even take them. She asked a couple of the standard questions but didn’t even give time to answer. No questions about bringing bait in or Potatoes. Right on through we went. I would assume they check my license plate and see the same truck has crossed the same week for the last five years. Maybe the length of stay is longer if it your first time across. Last year, they had three lanes open and we were backed up almost to the US building and took close to an hour to get through. This year, they had one lane open and we were fourth in line…kind of nice. When we got to the resort they told us Ontario is trying to make it easier to cross the border. I guess tourism took a huge hit last year? 

The outdoor card is good for three years, and yes you can now call and get your licsense or do it via internet. We had a pleasent crossing also. I did learn if you take your kid over bring a permission slip from your significant other or they could hassle you, my guy was nice and just warned me with a peice of paper explaining the rule. One new trick I learned is if they have a vistors center after you cross they sell licenses there also…..
