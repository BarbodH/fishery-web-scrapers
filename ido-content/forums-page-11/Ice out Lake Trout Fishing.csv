If you have thought about an ice out trip before, but have never done it â€“ now is the time. We are going to be ice free for approx. 5 weeks before walleye season open up here. That means great spring trout and shallow water pike fishing. Here are a few of the Lake Trout Lakes in my area that will be going out well ahead of there normal ice out dates. Lower Manitou LakePipestone LakeCrow LakeTrout Lake (N. of Rainy)Dogfly Lake Plus many more."
