1218383,gundez-71,2009-07-15 17:52:00,675,Our group is looking to change things around a bit for our annual Canada fishing trip. Looking for a resort that can handle 12 people. We bring our boats and want housekeeping cabins with showers. Also lots of walleyes are needed and no daily travel to outpost lakes. We want to park it and fish. Any suggestions. Thank you Gundy
790750,basser,2009-07-15 18:21:00,113,There is a Lake Despair Lodge that a group of us have been going to for 5 years and had great walleye action and smallmouth also some nice northern. 3 lakes chained together and Rainy just 5 miles down road. Good luck

There’s lot of islands and channels to hide by if the weather is bad and the walleye fishing has been excellent this year. I’d check out Buena Vista and Mylies. I think the resort traffic is down, so they may be willing to deal for a party your size."

Some of the people in the group go up 2-3 times a year. We’ve stayed at Procyk’s and Golden Hook the last two years and are going to Procyk’s this time. We have been able to catch lots of walleyes for eating but haven’t spent much time northern fishing. We had three big ones hit walleyes last year but only got to see them before they let go."
790828,buckeye,2009-07-16 00:02:00,103,"Press Lake Camp. Take a look at this web site. The cabins are good, price is right, fishing is good. Only 7 cabins on 7000 acres of water with the English river splitting the lake into two parts. There’s access to a couple other lakes depending on water level and size of boat. web site:[email protected]"

This last weekend was their annual bass tournament. Sounds like it went well.Bill went thru 5 E-Tec motors last year, finally told them he had enough, and now has a Merc. on his bass boat."
790993,basser,2009-07-16 16:57:00,113,"Bill & Nell are doing fine. I guess they’ve had enough cold weather lately,Bill’s garden got hit by the cold ,had to replant.The lake is still high. But they’ve been at it for 12 years running Despair and still enjoy it."
