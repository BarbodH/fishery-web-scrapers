Had an unexpected break in the action on the work front, so booked a last minute trip at Ghost River lodge, taking my youngest son for his first Canadian trip. Going to be there July 21 to 28. Typically go to lac Seul, but with the late planning, and good rates for father/son packages, decided to give it a whirl. Wondering if anyone can provide some feedback ton quality of summer fishing on the main lake and/or the portage lakes. Owners and Staff seem top-notch from other comments I’ve read, but can’t find much on the summer fishing quality.
