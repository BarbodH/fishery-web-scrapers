Heading to Newfoundland on a bear hunt next June. Brook trout and Atlantic salmon fishing is the “backup plan” for when we have downtime or after shooting a bear. Any advice for fishing Newfoundland, or any specific flies I should tie that are proven winners? Brookies will probably be the main quarry. I think we might be a little early for the atlantics. Mike

Lac Seul houseboat two weeks after that… I’d take advice on that, too! (Man, I’m going have to do some serious sucking up to the wife to avoid the evil eye on this one… What was I thinking when I schedule this so close together??  )

I did a Google search on “Recommended Brook trout flies for Newfoundland” and had several good hits. Unless there’s a definite hatch going on, it sounds like you will be throwing streamers….Woolly Buggers, Black Nose Dace, Zonkers, etc. Now the Atlantics….the traditional flies are wet flies that are pieces of art. Maybe you could e-mail ahead of time and see if the folks where you are staying might have some suggestions. I’m tying stuff for a trip to Alaska. Every time I ctrank out another dozen flies I wonder which one is going to be the fly that hooks the big one I’m still jealous! Rootski

 I wouldn’t worry about it too much, they don’t stay mad forever. They will just bring it up in conversation for the rest of your life.

 Sounds good, thanks for the effort!! If you happen to come across any other good info, feel free to PM me. I have done a bunch of internet searches, but have not started tying yet. I don’t figure I will tie too many atlantic salmon specific flies… I think our timing for atlantics might be off, and sometimes guys fish a whole week and only catch a few — that is often considered a good week. Maybe there will be some grilse in the stream. I’m not sure if we are in an area for arctic char, we might not be far enough up the northern tip for that. We are headed to the Gros Morne Park area on the Western coast. There are sea-run brookies, though, and sounds like the river brookies are huge… 5 lbs common. “One behind every rock” from what I hear… (or maybe that is just what I am hoping for)  Either way, should be a great adventure. Potential for shooting 2 black bears as well, with Newfoundland being home to some of the largest black bears in the world. Awesome! Mike

  Actually, she just brought up the idea of taking the whole family up to a “family friendly” resort type of place. I’m thinking Mille Lacs end of June or something like that. Somewhere that I wouldn’t feel too guilty fishing a bit since the kids/wife will have something else to do if they don’t want to fish. Might as well take 3 weeks vacation next June instead of just 2, right?  Plus it was her idea… Sweeeeet!!!! Speaking of…. Anyone have any recommendations for resorts we could try? N WI or N MN preferably.  Mike

Just thought I’d bump this one to the top as this trip is approaching in this summer. I’m starting to gather more information and gear, so if you have any info for me, I’d appreciate it.  Mike
