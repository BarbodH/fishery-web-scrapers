Heading to Newfoundland on a bear hunt next June. Brook trout and Atlantic salmon fishing is the “backup plan” for when we have downtime or after shooting a bear.

I’d highly recommend you take me along 

Lac Seul houseboat two weeks after that… I’d take advice on that, too!

sounds like you need to find two more weeks of fishing in between! 

 



My dad was born & raised in St.Mary’s point Newfoundland,I had the opportunity of spending some time out there with him before he passed away,it was the last trip we had together,quite memorable,had a ball,going back next year.Enjoy your trip,let us know how it goes. 

I did a Google search on “Recommended Brook trout flies for Newfoundland” and had several good hits. Unless there’s a definite hatch going on, it sounds like you will be throwing streamers….Woolly Buggers, Black Nose Dace, Zonkers, etc. Now the Atlantics….the traditional flies are wet flies that are pieces of art. Maybe you could e-mail ahead of time and see if the folks where you are staying might have some suggestions.





 

Just thought I’d bump this one to the top as this trip is approaching in this summer. I’m starting to gather more information and gear, so if you have any info for me, I’d appreciate it.
