Saw a report on Kare 11 last night that a father, son, & grandfather from Minnesota were fishing about 150 miles into Ontario this past week and the resort got hit by a f-2 tornado. They huddled together in the bathroom as the tornado ripped the cabin loose and threw it. They had some some cuts that needed stitches and bruises, but were much more fortunate than the 3 people from Oaklahoma in the next cabin that lost their lives.   

 Such a shame to hear of these things,thoughts and prayers go out to all.

The Resort was the Fishermans Cove.The families of those lost are in our prayers.
