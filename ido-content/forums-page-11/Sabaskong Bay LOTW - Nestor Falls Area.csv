1218398,bmcavoya,2010-02-07 18:24:00,21,"thinking about fishing in the nestor falls area of LOTW this year in mid March instead of the Baudette area. Curious if anyone has ever ice fished this area? Heard their can be a nice crappie, perch, and walleye bite. Any info on this would be nice but I would like to know about lake travel… plow roads? do I need a wheeler or is a truck good enough? Any help would be awesome! Thanks."

Right now the crappies have been tough but the jumbo perch and walleye have been good. The lake travel is bumpy with a sled as we had alot of wind making drifts. Pike fishing is usually quite good too. I have not been out on the road in a week or so but plan on going sometime this week.
840792,bmcavoya,2010-02-08 21:15:00,21,We are still looking for a place to stay for two nights. We got 6 people. We would be fine with either a housekeeping cabin or a motel. What options exist?

840932,Robin Holden,2010-02-09 03:40:00,54,There are a few camps open in the winter but most are on Crow with access to Lake of the woods. Nestor Falls also has a local hotel that may help you out. I am kinda bias to a certain camp in the winter but any place you stay will be suitable and they all offer housekeeping I believe.
