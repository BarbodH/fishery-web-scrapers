Taken from the Canadian Outdoor Card website…. The temporary Outdoors Card and paper licence are effective immediately. Your plastic Outdoors Card will be mailed to you by year end, and is valid for three calendar years (including the year of purchase). Non-Canadian resident hunters can also fish under the authority of their Outdoor Card (hunting version) with the appropriate fishing licence tag. You can also get more information on the Outdoors Card by calling the Outdoors Card Centre at 1-800-387-7011. This toll-free number works from all of North America, from Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). big G

I dont get the purpose of this card. Why didn’t they just raise licsense fees to equal the cost of the card. Seems like a tax but they made a whole new set of paper work to handle it….

Not sure… I believe it was Ontario’s way of getting more cash… I buy my fishing license in Manitoba, which does not have the Outdoor requirement… if I wanted to fish Ontario… I would need a license & it costs me $9 for the Outdoor Card… which is good for 3 years. Everything I have heard and read is, because Ontario is going to an ELS system (Electronic) like we have in MN. Basically, with the card, you will have Hunting accredation and also be able to buy your license for your trip on-line. big G

This may big true G, but it is alot more difficult than that to carry a firearm and hunt in Ontario. Looking at my card it looks like a credit card so I suppose it is easier to track what services you are using. If that is there intent. It would be intersting to know exactly what there intent is for this card. If they are going electronic it would be just as easy to track through a license IMO
