thinking about fishing in the nestor falls area of LOTW this year in mid March instead of the Baudette area. Curious if anyone has ever ice fished this area?

Awesome walleye and worldclass crappies.Lake travel hasnt been to good for a vehicle but I havent seen it in a month.Sunset Cove used to plow a road but I’m not sure if they still do.You could try to get a hold of them.Good Luck

Gordie(807-484-2103) always has a road plowed out of his place on Sabaskong Bay Road to the most popular crappies holes. Right now the crappies have been tough but the jumbo perch and walleye have been good. The lake travel is bumpy with a sled as we had alot of wind making drifts. Pike fishing is usually quite good too. I have not been out on the road in a week or so but plan on going sometime this week.

We are still looking for a place to stay for two nights. We got 6 people. We would be fine with either a housekeeping cabin or a motel. What options exist?

If you are not set in stone on location, we might be able to help you out depending dates. We have trout and walleye if you want to try something different. Click on the banner below and email me at [email protected] if you have any questions.

There are a few camps open in the winter but most are on Crow with access to Lake of the woods. Nestor Falls also has a local hotel that may help you out. I am kinda bias to a certain camp in the winter but any place you stay will be suitable and they all offer housekeeping I believe.
