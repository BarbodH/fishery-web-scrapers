Alot of memebers have posted where they fish in the summer, I was just wondering where you guys take your winter trips? 

I do most of my winter fishing on Lake Simcoe, here in Ontario. I like searching out the big whitefish of the lake as well as the Lake Trout. 



I am planning a snowmobile / ice fishing extravaganza 2nd weekend in January at Uncle Jeds cabin north of Minocqua. Have done very well for the big gils and big bass the last few trips up. Way to many lakes to choose from in that area of Wisconsin and very little time. 

In response to you Jeremy, simcoe is also known for jumbo perch.

Sparky

I usually fish Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba Canada. Sometimes the Red river in Dec.
