Alot of memebers have posted where they fish in the summer, I was just wondering where you guys take your winter trips? What is the main focus of species in the winter? Does it differ from the main species in the summer, if so why? Do you like the adventure of snowmobiling out to the camp/resort then snowmobiling to your fishing holes or do you like to drive your truck to the cabin and have the camp transport you out to your fishing destination and back for the day? I prefer bass/walleyes in the summer, but lakers in the winter.

I do most of my winter fishing on Lake Simcoe, here in Ontario. I like searching out the big whitefish of the lake as well as the Lake Trout. This I bought a couple of used snow machines so I am really looking forward to getting out thereâ€¦. sparky

I am planning a snowmobile / ice fishing extravaganza 2nd weekend in January at Uncle Jeds cabin north of Minocqua. Have done very well for the big gils and big bass the last few trips up. Way to many lakes to choose from in that area of Wisconsin and very little time.
