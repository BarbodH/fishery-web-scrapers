Anyone here fish the Clearwater-Pipestone chain in S.W. Ontario?

I have been up there twice, and we had mediocre luck. There are miles of fishable waters, and we didn’t have much help. By the end of the second trip we were boating a number of nice fish with some in the 4-5 lb. range. I would recommend you connect with a good resort up there that can give you some updated info. on the bite. Best of luck! We stayed at True North resort if you are still searching for a place to stay. Accomodations were nice, but they didn’t really provide a ton of fishing info.

Awesome multi species lake. Walleye, Muskie, Smallies, Lakers, and Pike. If you are looking for a place to stay I would suggest Hideaway Lodge, Doug and Cathy are excellent host and they have an outpost availble if you want more seclusion. Alot of water to fish, so if your looking to learn this area , “Fast” then good luck cause that probably ain’t gonna happen but you will enjoy your time on the Pipe and learn a little something everytime you go back.

Thanks for all the ideas, etc., If anyone is looking for an open seat and will be in the area, reply and maybe we can meet up.

Had a great time on the Clearwater-Pipestone chain in Canada last week.
