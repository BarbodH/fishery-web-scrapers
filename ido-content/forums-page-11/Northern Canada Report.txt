Well I just got back from Canada fishing with three of my buddies. This was my second trip up there this year. (My wife is getting soft) The border crossing went smoothly both ways with no problems. The FISHING was excellent! We caught several 24-28 inch eye’s and 34-39 1/2 northerns. 150 or more fish daily and I’m underestimating. No live bait was needed or used. A couple of things among many that stood out on this trip was my friend Phil catching 10 big Northerns in an hour that were all over 10lbs, and watching them explode through the cabbage grass to get the spinner. The other was a walleye caught by Brian that went around 22 inches that still had 2 inches of tail sticking out of it’s mouth but still wanted another meal. The weather was beautiful all week. The only thing missing was the Northern lights. Can’t wait till next year. Oh by the way, I prefished for the CVWC tournament on the Mississippi on Wednesday and caught one short sauger. Did I say I can’t wait till next year!!!






Thanks for the report, looks like you guys had a great time.
