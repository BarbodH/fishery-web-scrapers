If anyone has an Ice out trip booked, you might want to see if you can move up your dates with the ice looking like it will be a record ice out. If you have thought about an ice out trip before, but have never done it â€“ now is the time. We are going to be ice free for approx. 5 weeks before walleye season open up here. That means great spring trout and shallow water pike fishing.
