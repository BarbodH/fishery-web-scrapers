This article is province specific and does not make any mention of border crossings. Reads like lodges will be allowed to open. Interesting because I read the other day they voted to extend the provincial state of emergency through end of June. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-19-coronavirus-ontario-june-4-health-data-1.5598027 Now, I’m reluctant to share because people couldn’t resist taking the last border thread political. Please do your best to just take it for what it is.

I believe guiding and lodges are either just started or shortly will be opening up for canadians. Haven’t heard anything about the border.

one more canadian article. little fuzzy on what today’s news means. ex what’s a cottage vs resort. also there may be more local rules below the provincial ones. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/renting-a-cottage-during-covid-19-pandemic-1.5597485

Canada people only. Gonna be alot of suffering resorts up there this year. Many shuttered ones next year. Furthermore who would give running a resort a go when they can shut your business down for as long as they want. Many consequences to come from Covid
