I am looking for information regarding crossing the Canadian boarder via boat and fishing Canadian waters. From what I’m seeing you need a valid fishing license for that providence and a valid US passport. I have not found an “official” statement or website stating that. Any input on finding this information?

You will need a remote border pass to cross over. Look it up…..

You also need the “outdoors card” in order to get your fishing license. The passport can be substituted if your driver’s license is “real id.” and be sure to check regulations for live bait, alcohol, and fish possession.

This is no longer necessary. To the best of my knowledge on reading info and talking to a couple RL guides all you need is Canadian fishing license and passport.
While you’re fishing Canada you cannot anchor, go to shore, tie up to another boat, have alcohol on board, or live bait (leeches, minnows)
I’m sure there are other regs but these are the most asked about or checked by Canadian CO.

Interesting, makes it way easier if you live on this side of border water. Kinda surprised the Canadian government gave up the RBC control

Here you go. 

Thank you Cameron! That is exactly what I was looking for!

Anytime.
