1910761,Tedd Johnson,2020-01-29 08:47:00,52,Hi I am planning on a Canadian trip for a week at the beginning of August. This will be our first time there and would like to know where you would recommend that has good fishing (mainly walleye and possibly lake trout) but also has a swimming beach for my wife and daughters. They dont care to fish but want to go and I would want them to have a great time too. Thanks Tedd

They don’t have a beach, but they have a great set of docks and lake toys(tubes, water trampoline, kayaks, paddle-boats, etc.). If you absolutely need a beach, then this won’t be the place though. Ian is the guy who runs the place, and he’s the nicest, most helpful lodge owner I’ve run into. Spent a ton of time with my wife and I our first time up there to make sure we caught fish(and we did)."

There are others like Sandy Point Lodge and Winoga Lodge in the area as well, but I have not tried them."

I have a buddy whose cabin is on Rainy just over the border… He isn’t getting there either… “Guest Update – COVID-19 As we are all aware, there is a lot of uncertainty resulting from the spread of COVID-19, the US- Canadian Borders are now closed to all non-essential travel, for the foreseeable future. We are continuing to monitor this evolving situation and its impact on your fishing vacation at Mahkwa Lodge this spring/summer. At this point, we do not know, when we will be allowed to open and operate the facilities. As such, we are reaching out to you, in the hope to attain your understanding relating to the potential deferment of your booking. In the event that the borders are still closed in May – September, we will be contacting each guest, by phone or E-mail two weeks prior to their established arrival date to determine if they would prefer to re-book during the same time period the following year or later in the season. Guest deposits, as noted in the confirmation letters are non-refundable after January 12th, 2020. If your trip is cancelled, due to border closures, your deposit can be used to re-book a trip, either later this year or in 2021. Please stay safe, we will all get through this together.” Guess we’ll see how this all goes… Mark"
