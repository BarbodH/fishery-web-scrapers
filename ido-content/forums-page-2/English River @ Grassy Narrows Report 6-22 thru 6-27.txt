Year #16 for us up there and this year was another year of low water (3yrs in a row now). We got to the launch about noon on 6/22 after an all night drive and picking up our bait order at Sunset Baits, then waiting for the grocery and the Beer store to open in Kenora. Had the boats unloaded at the cabins and we headed out fishing by 2pm or so

Great report. I have a friend that was up there a couple weeks ago. Haven’t talked to him yet, so i can’t tell you how they did.
