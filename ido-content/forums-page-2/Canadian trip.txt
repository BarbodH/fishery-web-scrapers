Hi I am planning on a Canadian trip for a week at the beginning of August. This will be our first time there and would like to know where you would recommend that has good fishing (mainly walleye and possibly lake trout) but also has a swimming beach for my wife and daughters. They dont care to fish but want to go and I would want them to have a great time too. 

Five Lakes Lodge is an awesome drive-to lodge in NW Ontario. Not sure where you’ll be driving from, but it’s about 4-5 hours from I-falls. 

I’d recommend Abrams Lake Lodge in Sioux Lookout. It has everything you mentioned including a sandy beach. Camp (tent or RV) or Cabin and very reasonable. There are others like Sandy Point Lodge and Winoga Lodge in the area as well, but I have not tried them.

Check out Browns on Clearwater West….from what I can tell, it might be the best beach in that area.

My brother forwarded this email to me yesterday. I have a buddy whose cabin is on Rainy just over the border… He isn’t getting there either…
