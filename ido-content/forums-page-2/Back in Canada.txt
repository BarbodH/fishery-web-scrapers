Back in the second greatest nation in the world. Crossing was easy with all the paperwork done ahead of time. Fishing was great. We live in the greatest nation in the world USA! 

Great job Dan.

Thatâ€™s fantastic! Love seeing the pics and hearing about the good times. Crossing my fingers, will be there in 9 days!

Are those brook trout in the top photos? Real nice color.

Great to here the trip went well and no crossing issues. We are heading to Canada tomorrow for 11 days. All party members received our negative test results and have all documents ready.
