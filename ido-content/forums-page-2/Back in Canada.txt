Back in the second greatest nation in the world. Crossing was easy with all the paperwork done ahead of time. Fishing was great. We live in the greatest nation in the world USA! 20210823_130950-scaled.jpg 20210821_163420-scaled.jpg IMG_20210828_204257.jpg 20210821_150506-scaled.jpg

Great to here the trip went well and no crossing issues. We are heading to Canada tomorrow for 11 days. All party members received our negative test results and have all documents ready.
