According to a Fort Francis radio station border crossing are down 96% compared to the same time last year.

LOL Mainly the only people going across are those who work on one side or the other. One of my buddies did manage to get to his cabin on the Canadian side but had to stay for 14 days. Apparently he wasnâ€™t even supposed to get in a boat and fish during that time.
