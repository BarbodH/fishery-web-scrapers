I will be coming up to the camp narrows area the second week of September. I was up there in June last year and we struggled to find many walleyes. we hit it right in the middle of a big bug hatch and the walleyes we did find were all buried in the weeds. I am wondering if someone could maybe recommend a guide for a half day to shorten our learning curve we only have 2.5 days to fish. thank you for any help
