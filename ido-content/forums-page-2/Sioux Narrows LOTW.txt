I just got back from a trip out of Sioux Narrows. It truly is a gift to us humans to see that beautiful area. We camp 22 miles by water out in LOW. This year the electric bear fence paid off because we had momma and her 3 little ones visiting our camp and as long as it was on, they stayed out. Fishing was great! Around 1000 walleyes for 3 boats and quite a few big ones too. 30.75″ being the biggest.

Awesome, great stuff!! We’re heading out to LOTW Sioux Narrows this weekend. Lodging near Index island. I have the entire week but 3 of the guys only have 2 days and I really hope to put them on fish. Any tips would be much appreciated! Are the smallies in the shallows still or have they moved out to along deeper water? How about the northerns where are they? Are the ‘eyes on jig-n-minnow still or switch to a night crawler harness? Thanks!!

Walleyes are in the process of switching to crawlers. We caught a lot of fish, actually most of our biggest fish were caught on leeches last week, but crawlers were certainly putting out numbers. We dont use jigs at all. We troll using rigs with bottom bouncers. Mainly targeting depths in 27 to 34 feet, but did catch fish as shallow as 14 feet the first evening, but that was much cooler, windy and overcast. Fish were deeper after that. Didnt target pike or bass, but did catch those as well.

One of our boats ran out of leeches and started using I believe it was trigger x leeches and they did equally well for walleyes on them. Each boat had a pound of leeches (Swenson’s bait right by the access in Sioux Narrows) and a half flat of crawlers. Slim pickings for remaining bait at the end of the week.
