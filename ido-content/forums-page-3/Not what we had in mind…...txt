Sometimes a late season muskie trip does NOT turn out the way you hope for, but with some perseverance Ryan Klein and I were able to have a little bit of success this weekend. With the help from a few others of course.

Wow nice fish!! Sounds like a lot of work, but nice fish!!

Did you have any trouble with other boats crowding in on your spot?

No, just a couple loons wondering where the heck the summer went.

Cool…..

Hard core on your part and some nice fish to show for your effort. Commendable

They might not be the best trips but sure are the most memorable  

not sure hard earned does it justice. strong work boyz! and awesome reward!

That’s Hard Core! 

Great story! Thanks for sharing.

Oh – to be young again.

Well those ARE some impressive muskies!  So I’m sure you’re ready to head back up there again in a couple weeks when the big fish bite really turns on…  

I’ve been going back and forth on if i’m going back yet or not. I think i’ll let the weather decide for me. I can guarantee the best bite is happening right NOW.

I sure am hoping that we don’t have to deal with that kind of adventure again. It’s a cool story but I don’t need two of them!
