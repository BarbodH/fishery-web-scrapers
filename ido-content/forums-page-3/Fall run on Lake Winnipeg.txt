I’ve made that run before. 1/4 oz jig or smaller will work, depending on current location, tipped w/minnow works just fine. Bigger eye’s are usually just outside the mouth/lakeside, you will see plenty of boats anchored up. If you want number’s work the river. Boat launch will be a zoo so plan to get up early if you don’t want to wait in line for an hour plus. Good luck and repot back.

Been quite a few years since I have been up there and starting to get the itch to go again. First time a friend took me out who lives in Winnipeg. Barely got the boat on plane before he shut it down and said we fish here. I was like what the heck I am from the US we need to make a much longer run to get to good fishing  Have fun you can catch the fish of a lifetime up there that time of year. Friend caught a 35″ walleye, wow!
