Elk Island Lodge 

Here is a picture of a Godâ€™s River Brook trout I caught a few yrs back. The whole reason I went to Elk Island Lodge was to fish the river for giant Brook Trout. Next time, my preference would be to spend the entire time fishing the river. I think Greg Dick said the Brook Trout lodge record was 9+ lbs.

Yeah the brookies are sure beautiful eh ?
