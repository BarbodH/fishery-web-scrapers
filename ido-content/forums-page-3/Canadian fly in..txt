My family wants to do a fly in for a 60th birthday near the end of July next year. Primarily will be walleye fishing. As a rule is it that much better fishing vs say driving to Lac Seul or another Canadian lake? Any suggestions?
Thanks Bob. 

Lac Seul seems like it can be the best of both worlds, but also bigger water(and more fishermen). A lot of the fly in options offer smaller more wind-protected lakes where numbers of walleye will be fantastic. 

How many people ? I know several, but depends on group size. I have done the drive to’s and the fly-ins. I will only do fly-ins now. 

Thanks Phil. We are looking between 4-8 people. Thanks 

Call northwest flying….near nestor falls so it’s an easy drive from the metro area. They have a handful of fly in lakes that can accommodate your group. Good outfit if you want to do a fly in.

x2 what phil said.
