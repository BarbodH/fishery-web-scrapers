Has anyone gone here before? Looking for a place to take my 2 boys and they have good father/son packages. Or any other good lodges/fly-ins that are easy to bring kids where they’ll catch a ton in Canada you’ve had experience at?

Wilderness air and see if you can get into lake Tessup.

Good numbers of fish? Looks like a reasonably priced adventure as well.

Yes. There is one cabin on a lake 4 miles long and a 1/2 mile wide. You will be in that only cabin.

Took my 12 year old there about 10 years ago in July, and enjoyed it a lot. Tina and hubby are great hosts. There are several lakes you can fish, and plenty of eyes to be caught. We had a tough time finding smallies though. I fish Lac Seul every year and prefer it for trips with the buddies , but can’t beat the father/kids pricing at Ghost River.
