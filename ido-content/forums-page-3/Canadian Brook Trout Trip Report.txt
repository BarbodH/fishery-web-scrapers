The world record Brook trout is 14.5 lbs. and was caught in the Nipigon River, Ontario in 1915 by Dr. JW Cook on a minnow. It’s no secret Canada is home to the biggest and baddest Brook Trout in the world. Bar none.

Awesome fish, great report. Thanks for sharing!

Unbelievable. Super jealous. Those fall males are incredible. 

Stunning. Awesome!! Congrats Kendall.

The most revered fish on my list…… Wild brookies. Awesome! 

My biggest fish for the trip at 23″. The big males would likely be in full color by mid September. There were a couple more of these nice males I wish I had landed. Not easy to keep these guys hooked in heavy current. I guess that’s why they call it fishing.

Awesome to say the least !

I should mention there were some walleye spots where we kept a few for shore lunch. Nice average size around 19″ or so. Fishwise, we only ate walleyes.

Here are a few more pictures…
