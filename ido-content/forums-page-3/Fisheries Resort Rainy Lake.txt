Has anyone been to this resort? I am looking for a new place to go for a trip in June. I have heard pretty good things about the fishing and the lodge but have only spoke to one person with first hand knowledge. Any info would be greatly appreciated!

Never heard of it. Is this over on Redgut bay or somewhere else on the east side?
