I’m in the final packing stages for our Canadian Brook Trout Trip we have planned for next week.

Good luck Kendall! Can’t wait to see your trip report.

That looks like great time. I see a lot of gold/orange in the box lower left….that’s what I’d be packing as it seems that everything in the trout/char family loves that color combo. Good luck on that 24″quest and travel safe!

Good luck Ken. Sounds like a fun trip. 

Good luck!  

Good luck Kendall!

It seems smallmouth sized baits are about right, however, I didn’t see a tiny torpedo in the mix. Might be worth throwing a couple in. It would be great to see some blow ups on one of those.

Good luck guys. Be careful up there. 

Sounds like a heck of a trip. Good luck Ken.

Good Luck!

Fish those spoons and drop them at the drop off to trigger fish

going to God’s River?

Good luck Kendall! And when you’re going through the rapids… Just send it!

Good luck. Get lots of pics. Hope your quest is successful. Be careful.
