I’m in the final packing stages for our Canadian Brook Trout Trip we have planned for next week. Target species is huge Canadian Brook Trout. My goal is to break the 24″ mark which is bigger than the ones in my avatar. The river we selected for this trip is a remote road less area of Northern Canada accessible by plane only to a remote Native village. The river is huge by Midwest standards and can be run with 16′ boats and smaller outboards. Also, Native guides are a must to navigate the rapids. This trip I even upsized my fly rod to an 8 wt. which will be needed for large Lemming and Mouse fly patterns we will use. Spoons will be 1/2 to 3/4 oz five of diamonds and K.O. Wobblers. Inline spinners will be no. 15 (3/4 oz.) Panther Martins. It’s been my experience for Super Tanker Brook Trout is size matters and GO BIG? If we get Internet Connection in the Native village we are staying at I will report back. IMG_2518.jpg IMG_2519-1.jpg IMG_2519.jpg IMG_2520.jpg IMG_2503.jpg IMG_2504.jpg

That looks like great time. I see a lot of gold/orange in the box lower left….that’s what I’d be packing as it seems that everything in the trout/char family loves that color combo. Good luck on that 24″quest and travel safe!

It seems smallmouth sized baits are about right, however, I didn’t see a tiny torpedo in the mix. Might be worth throwing a couple in. It would be great to see some blow ups on one of those.
