Headed up in a week. Anyone been there recently?

Wesley:

We will be at Whitewing, a little south of Ear Falls.

We will be at Whitewing, a little south of Ear Falls. We usually run down to McKenzie if the weather will allow. But there are some good spots closer to camp as well. 

Wesley:

Thanks for the info, gives us some good starting points.

Heading up on Monday. Any reports from this area? Bait, presentation, secret spots;), etc? 

Monday: Got into camp around 3:30pm, went out for a quick couple hours of fishing on a reef close to camp, and almost got blown off the lake. Still managed to bring in a couple of unders that first night though.
