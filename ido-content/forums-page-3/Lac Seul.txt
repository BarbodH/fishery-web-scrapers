Going north of the border for the first time. Heading to Lac Seul to do some walleye fishing in June. Any suggestions on how to fish the northwest area? Colors? Depths? Jigs/bottom bouncers? Minnows/crawlers?

What section? Been going there for 20 years. I fish the middle section off the lake. Its 150 miles from end to end . 

We will be staying at Cherob Resort near Ear Falls in the northwest area.
