Has anyone heard of a new requirement for the Crawlers to be rinsed off to completely remove all dirt before being bedded on paper to bring into Canada?
Thank you

Not sure, I’m looking to just pick up a flat in Fort Frances on my way over the border so I don’t have to worry about it. I think there are a few bait shops that you can order from and they’ll have em ready to go. 

 We took 10 dozen in packed in Bess paper bedding,no problem at the border.

That is not a new law concerning the dirt. It has been in place for many years.
