I’m always interested in the behind-the-scenes aspect of running a Canadian fishing lodge, especially a fly-in with all the logistics involved. This is a cool story from Aikens Lake Wilderness Lodge on how they host a group of family & friends each year for a special volunteer week to prepare the lodge for the upcoming season. http://www.aikenslake.com/news/it-takes-a-village May-2017-149.jpg May-2017-184.jpg May-2017-183.jpg molly-week-1.jpg

Friends dad retired from the military and bought a resort by Fergus Falls. I think had it 3 or 4 years and said he never worked so hard in his life.

One of good friends had a resort for 10 years. He said he had 2 great days the day he bought and the day he sold it. Way more work than he anticipated. He hardly fished or hunted while owning. No time

A funny, and interesting, quote. I’ve heard the same thing said about boats – especially I think larger/fancier boats that run on a combination of gas and money …
