Fished the week on the English River below Lac Suel. Weather was crazy and the fishing even more so. Big fish week. We had walleyes of (1) 30.5″, (4) 28″, (1) 27 1/2″, (1) 27″, a dozen 26″, and oodles of 25″. (4) northerns over 39″ with 42″ being the biggest.

Some more.

That looks like an amazing trip. Was that a drive to location?

Steve, what an amazing fishing trip. I just can’t stop looking at those pictures. Do you go there just in the fall, or in the spring too?

Great fish but not so sure I’m jealous. I shivered just looking  They’re definitely well deserved!

Yes it is a drive to. The camp is right in Ear Falls. The roads are excellent and the drive time from Des Moines is about 14 hours. We go both spring and fall. Fall is my favorite. We pretty much have the camp to ourselves (a few moose hunters).
