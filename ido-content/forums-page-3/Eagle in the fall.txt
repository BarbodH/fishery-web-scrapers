Anybody fish the Vermilion Bay area of Eagle Lake in Ontario in Sept.? Is it a good area for Pike and Muskie?

I like them waay better in the fall compared to the warm summer. They taste a lot like baby seals with a slight loon taste  

Itâ€™s been a number of years since I was up at Eagle lake but would think not much has changed since then. We were there for a week in August at a resort more in the central part of the lake but my understanding was that structure and habitat was similar on that lake from end to end. Hundreds of bays and islands, rock and weeds. I would think Vermilion bay would be as good for pike and muskie as anywhere else out there.
