X2, We’re there for two weeks starting with the opener. Might be a nail-biter.

My dad heads to Pakwash for opener ever year. With 2.5 more weeks to go, it will be close. Next week it will be in the 70’s up there, so I wouldn’t be too worried yet.

So we heard from our host today at Mahkoon,just down the shore from Mahkwa lodge on Lac Seul, and there’s still lots of ice left on portions of the main lake. Good news is that our bay is open. Being that we use Mahkwa’s launch and that we catch lots of eyes from our dock, looks like we’ll be leaving Friday as planned, even if we’re limited to our bay for a couple days. The warm, sunny forecast for the week should put a bigger dent into the ice before we get there.
