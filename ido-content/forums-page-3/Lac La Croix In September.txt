We are going up to Lac La Croix for the first time the 2nd week in September so just looking for some tips to get us going in the right direction. Walleye will be the primary target so what typically works up there that time of year? Trolling cranks? Pitching jigs? Live bait or plastic? Are we fine staying in the Canadian waters or should we plan on fishing US water as well (some of the guys would need a MN license then)? Is it worth the trip to portage down to Loon Lake? I would appreciate any advice you care to offer. Thanks.
