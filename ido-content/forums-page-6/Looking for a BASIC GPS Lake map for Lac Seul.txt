Hi, am heading back to Lac Seul this summer. Must not be too smart because the last time I was there I got lost on the water. Am looking for an easy-to-use handheld GPS (and map) that shows me basic lake information (where am I on the lake, etc). Thanks,

Not sure where you live but the recent updateable version of Navionics-North edition has lac seul and many other bigger waters mapped in 10ft contours in Canada. And if you live in the North region its great for many of the lakes in the states! If nothing else, at least a simple gps that lays trails will get you back to camp!

navionics has the chip that will cover Lac Seul. not sure on a handheld gps though. where to you go out of on lac seul?

The east end of the lake at Lac Seul Outposts…. Thanks for your reply.

Thanks for your reply… I live in Wisconsin. 10′ contours should be fine for us. I just want to be able to see where the heck I am on that lake (it is a BIG lake). Every island and point looks the same.

HI garyman –

no need to bring anything then. just walk to the end of the dock and fish. done.

Have a smart phone? Navionics has an app for less than $16 that covers North America and shows Lac Suel with contours at 10′, 20′, 40′, 60′, etc. So basically 20′ contours except it starts at 10.

Thanks for replying… A boat with a nice motor is part of the package plan.



Garyman, when is your trip? I’m booked into LSL’s Sunlight Lake outpost camp the week of 8/3 – 8/10. Maybe we can compare notes. I posted a similar question in the Toys forum. I downloaded the Navionics app with Canada maps onto my Galaxy S3 smartphone and was hoping to verify that it will work in that area of LS. As I understand from the rep from Navionics, to work on a smartphone, the phone needs to be able to communicate with a cell tower. It’s not like a “real” GPS that talks directly to the satellites.
