Does anyone know the projected ice out in the Dryden area lakes?

This year? Judging by what’s happening down here, I would project sometime in July. But that’s only if you want to gamble on the early season spring bite… 

My inlaws live in Dryden and they were still ice fishing Wabigoon this past weekend. Ice is starting to break away from shore and this rain will help.
