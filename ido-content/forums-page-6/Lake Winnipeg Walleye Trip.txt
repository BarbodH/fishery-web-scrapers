During the week of March 23rd through the 28th, I had the opportunity to head north to Lake Winnipeg to target some Big Walleyes. This was not one of the more difficult decisions I have made to say the least. 

Congrats on a great trip and a fish of a lifetime 

Awesome job Mike! I’m sure Vandy is proud of ya!!! 

awesome fish mike,ok im jealous! 

Nice fish 

Good job figuring them out and congrats on your big girl Mike! 

Winnipeg is a very special place for trophy walleyes. It amazes me the amount of large fish a person can catch thru the ice. Congrats on landing a beast of a fish. 27 fish over 24 inches will make memories for all! 

What a Hawg Mike, that’s all I can say! 

Thanks alot guys! It was a great trip and learning expierence.

I am wanting to go do this soon and wondering if you did this with or without a guide. Where did you guys stay at? If you dont mind sharing.

We stayed at southbeach. And no we did not hire a guide but from what I have heard there are quite a few guides available up there. Good luck

Thank you for the info.
