We came home for a week then were back up for the week of Aug. 3-10th The water temps continue to drop. When we left it was just under 68 but fish were still biting they’ve just moved a bit deeper, we caught them mostly 24-38′ with the last couple days 34′ was key. Friday was wind and cool and bouncing was a bit slow so we E-anchored ate lunch and jigged up 15 nice eyes w/4 over 21″ including 25 & 26″ ers! They fought just like huge smallies, out of 36′, but we brought them up slow and we able to let em go! We had equal success on leeches or crawlers. I talked to some of our neighbors… the water temp 4 weeks ago was 78, fishing has been hit or miss. Another said the fishing is toughest he’s seen in 25 yrs. Well this is the strangest weather I’ve seen in 25 yrs, too, but luckily the tougher fishing on LOTW is still great!!"
