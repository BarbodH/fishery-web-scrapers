Most fish were taken on gold jig and crawler, 30 1/2 was caught bottom bouncing. We were staying up by Sioux Narrows and fishing out past “Yellow Girl”."

It had a 15 1/2″ girth. We won’t get a replica mount, but we’ll blow up into a nice 8×10 and frame for him. It was the first fish of the vacation for him, it was going to be hard to top that one."
