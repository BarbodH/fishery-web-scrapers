Any body have any reports and lake winnipeg? How much ice? Snow depth? If the east or west side of the lake has a better bite and so on. I will be heading up Sunday to Thursday and will report back on how we do. Thanks for any info you give and I hope to have some good info to share/pics when we get back for the people who are heading up there the last weekend! 

Just got back. We had tough weather and fishing last week. 2 days were in the 30’s and the other days single digits and windy. Wednesday it was -16F when we were pulling out of the driveway. Said the heck with it and went back in and watched TV for a while. My 74 year old Dad did get a 31.5″L x 19.25″G. AWESOME fish! Had a 20″ extension and powerhead was on the snow every hole. You need to keep moving. If it gets warm you will need tracks to get around.

Thanks for the heads up sounds like the weather is going to be on the cold side for us too.

I am hearing better reports out of the east and mornings are better than afternoons. I will be up with a group Sat-Wed out of the casino.

I havent heard much as far as reports go, but im heading up sunday~thursday! Good luck to everyone heading up.Mike

Hope you land some real pigs Mike!

For the guys heading up the same time as my group if you would like to send me your phone # by PM I will share what’s working for us and location if you are willing to do the same. Good luck everyone and let’s put some piggys on the ice. 

Thanks Ben,Work this week is just crawling by theres no doubt about that. But the good news is that I have my blade baits ready, rods rigged up, and the marcum is ready to start showing me so big red marks!
