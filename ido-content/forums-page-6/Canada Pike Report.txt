I figured I would provide this report because I got into the best big pike fishing in my life last week up in NW Ontario on the English River system, and there are many on here that make trips to Canada every year. 

Heck of job on those pike and paying attention to details. I would much rather cast a crank or jig vs. rigging anyday as well.

  very nice!

Thanks, we stayed at Halley’s Camps. Great place and people.

Pike are very sensitive to temperature 45 to ~ 58 degrees F has always been the pattern for me for any pike > 30”. After that if a lake is deep they shoot out and suspend for deep water baitfish. At least that’s been my experience?Cheers and nice fish.
