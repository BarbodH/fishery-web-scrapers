Pounded the snot out of the BIG Nipigon pike this past Sunday. We were using B Fish’s 4″ white Moxi on a jig. 

details?

All the pike I’ve caught this year have come on BfishN (WHITE) moxi or paddletail. I don’t know why but… White + BfishN = pike. I’m having a blast catching 2-6 pounders down here on pool 2. Bet that was a great fight catching those monster pike on jig and plastic! Nice fish!

A Moxi triple!
