After 14 years of going to Nipigon my wife and I had the pleasure of taking our dog Ava on a trip up to this Canadien Gem. I zeroed in on a great Pike bite, and as my IDO handle suggest this puts me in a great place. We found a river inlet that was full of big pike. One moment I watched two huge pike cruising down the river as my lure nearly snagged the first inadvertently one they scatered down into the weeds. I quickly re casted to one of the brutes and sure enough fish on! Only to watch as the other “larger” fish swim up next to the hooked fellow as I am fighting it at the boat. 42″ later I released the small guy to try for the bigger one. My wife’s new PB is 43″ on pike and 27″ on walleye. What a trip!








Nice report  

No, but a little birdy whispered something in my ear about some fall spec fishing that is simply unbelievable. Location, Location, Location 

Nice Fish, my PB is 42.5 so I am hoping to get up to Canada someday and break that. – QB
