Dont forget, you can buy or renew your outdoors card and fishing license online now https://www.on.wildlifelicense.com/custlkup.php?lang=1 For you hunting folk out there you can renew online but cant be a first time purchaser. PM me and I can help get you the hunting outdoor card if you need it. We’re almost there folks. Don’t know about you but I’m getting amped.

Thanks for the info and link. What kind of winter did you have? Is Nipigon gonna be full again like last year with the abundance of run off and rain! I sure hope so
