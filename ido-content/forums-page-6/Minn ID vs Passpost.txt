From today’s Strib. Should make crossing into Canada a little easier.

Now you said this applies to re-entry to the USA. If you still need a passport to enter Canada, would you not already have your passport and not need a enhanced license?

…I was wondering the same thing. Maybe this will also work on getting INTO said countries???



I went thru at fort frances and back last year for a Canada fishing license and all I had was WI drivers license and birth certificate, made it just fine. maybe it was my lucky day. gonna try it again at the end of march when I go back to rainy, can’t wait although I think I can get my license online now that i’m in the computer.

A passport is not required to enter Canada. It is only required to enter the US.

Even if you have a license in the US?

Yes US entry is passport or passport I’d card about half price but allows only canada and Mexico.
