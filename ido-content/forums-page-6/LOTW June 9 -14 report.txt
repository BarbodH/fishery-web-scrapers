Sorry a little slow but work happens… after vacation  read Fisheman J’s report we had similar sucess but we happened to find some really nice walleyes, we caught on one day a 28 1/2″, 28″, 27″, 25″, several 23″- 18″ mainly on jigs with BfishN paddle tails, trigger X minnows, and good ole fashioned twister tails (yellow, a personal favorite)  with some meat attached, the boys also caught lots of smallies, most of our walleyes came from 10′- 19′ and the wind was our friend…necked down areas between islands or points, with the smallies being still shallow, we had a real treat the last day there when we came across this bobcat out for a swim 









Wow!! I can’t believe that cat is swimming.

Great report, and how cool is that seeing that Cat swim by?

We figured it was a once in a lifetime thing, he had swam at least a 1/2 mile already when we spotted him and still had a couple hundred yard to go… not too bad of a swimmer
