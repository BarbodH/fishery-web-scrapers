27 1/4 inches 6 lbs 4 oz – Maureen (wife)30 1/2 inches 9 lbs 4 oz – Grandpa and a 24 1/2, no picture.26 inches – RichAll personal bestsAll above fish were CPR’d, a lot of fish between 13 and 19 1/2″ were eaten. Most fish were taken on gold jig and crawler, 30 1/2 was caught bottom bouncing. We were staying up by Sioux Narrows and fishing out past “Yellow Girl”.  




Very nice. Any eye over 30″s is a fish to remember. 

Grandpa must be happy!

Very happy, I didn’t know if he was going to recover from that one. At 83, it took all of his energy to reel it in. I think I was just as happy for him. It had a 15 1/2″ girth. We won’t get a replica mount, but we’ll blow up into a nice 8×10 and frame for him. It was the first fish of the vacation for him, it was going to be hard to top that one.

Very nice fish! Headed up there next week! Where did you guys stay? Sent you a pm

Great colors on them fish, always love to see the different color variations on eyes from different bodies of water. -QB
