Just received an official call from Quetico Park Management. Quetico Provincial Park will delay its opening until May 23, 2014 due to the ice cover on the lakes. If you already have a Quetico trip planned before that date and want to do a Boundary Waters trip instead, let me know and I can help you choose a route.
