Leaving on Sunday morning to go on my annual fly-in trip with my Dad and 2 brothers! Cannot wait!!!! We are going back to the same Outfitter and lake I posted about last year. Hopefully we can break the 30 inch mark this year. I will post a reaport when I get back on the 29th   

Good luck on the 30â€³!! 

Here is a little teaser of the fish we were catching up there last year.
