Spent two weeks in July fishing Whitefish bay on LOTW. Lots of Walleyes both weeks. They ranged from 16 to 24 inches. Plenty of fat 20 inch fish. The Walleyes we found were in shallow water around weed beds. Most in 6 to 8 FOW. We used BE fishin plastics both weeks. The lake trout were in 55 to 65 feet the first week of July. When we returned on the third week they were hanging off deep rock piles at 100 to 110 FOW. Bouncing white jigs around them drove them nuts. What a battle when you hooked up. They would belch air and dive right back when you unhooked them. They were nice fish 28 to 34 inches. Big northern off deep rock piles the first week. Non the second week. Lots of fat smallmouth every day while we were Fishing for eyes. The Bonus was a bunch of large clean perch found off a point in Yellowgirl bay. Awesome eating. We fished Snake bay, Whitefish bay, Yellowgirl and Sunset channel. Put lots of miles on my boat and can tell you we are going back soon.
