I am just a few hours south of the Canadian/Minnesota border and would like to drive up to a resort on a lake that is quiet with good fishing.

Here’s two we like: Finlayson Resort by Atikokan. Walleye, smallie and pike in Finlayson. Other good lakes close. Marmian is a great smallie lake. Terry at resort will help you with spots. Negative, boat has to be trailered every night. Cabins are good and reasonably priced. Rustic.Press lake camp north of Ignace. Walleye, pike and smallies. Electric right on docks and cabins are good and reasonably priced. Rustic. Negative – road in to camp is 16 miles of logging road that takes us an hour to navigate pulling my Mr. Pike. Give them a look and good luck!

Check out Gawleys little beaver lodge on lac seul $50 a night per person. Awesome cabins, free ice, top notch owners, small camp only 3 cabins and oh yes its Lac Seul!!!! pm me if you want to know more 


I know LOTW isn’t what you think of when you say quiet but Reel Em Inn Lodge is an incredible place to stay. 26 mile by boat out of Morson, Canada. You stay on an island in little traverse bay and rarely run into any other boats. It may seem like an expensive trip but all you do is eat, sleep, and fish, seriously. They cook all meals, clean all fish, and provide bait and 6 gallons of gas a day if you take your own boat. HIGHLY recommend!!!
