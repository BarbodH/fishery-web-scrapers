Our annual Canada fly in trip with my Dad and 2 brothers was the best we have ever had this past week. From the drive up, to getting in, fishing all week, and getting home, everything went smooth. The weather was great in the low 80’s with mostly sun all week. We only had 1 morning with rain and wind.

Nice, I am so jealous. Ontario? 

those are some nice looking fish, they have shoulders.

No doubt, lots of BIG fish. Looks somewhat untypical of your avg. fly-in where numbers are the name of the game. Congrats on a great outing, glad to see you unlocked the pattern and had a fun trip!

  sounds like a Great trip all right 

Joel,

Looks like a great trip. Congrats! Can you tell us the name of the lake/outfitter?

Wilderness Air out of Vermilion Bay Ontario 

Great job figuring out the pattern and nice write up for the rest of us! Good to see hard work paying off.

WOW! 



Awesome report Ben!  Glad the spinners turned on the fish for you guys. I think you need to update your profile pic to this one!


I’ve flown in ~ 10 times. The walleyes usually maxed out at 27″ with lots of (15 to 24)”. Those walleyes are bigger than the average fly in eyes I’ve run across. Usually it’s the pike that have the size up north and the eyes have the numbers. This is OK for me since I like pan sized walleyes for dinner, however I wouldn’t mind latching on to a couple 10-12 pounders.
