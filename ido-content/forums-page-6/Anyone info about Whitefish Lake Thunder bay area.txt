Friends are planning a trip to Whitefish Lake this summer and I am having trouble finding any info on this lake. The particular lake is located in Ontario Canada north west of Thunder Bay. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

I have been to Whitefish lake many times and know it well. Send me a PM and I will fill you in.

Go to thunder Bay Fishing.com for lots of information on Whitefish lake I have asked numerous times for info from them and have always been given great info

I am also looking for info on Icefishing Whitefish this coming Feb â€“ March 2014. PM me for any info you can share!
