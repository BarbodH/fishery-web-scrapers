My Dad, Brother Al, Brother Chris, and I just returned on Saturday from our Annual Fly-in Trip. We spent 5 days chasing BIG walleye and were not disappointed. We went to this lake last year and figured out the pattern for this time of year. Here is the link to last year’s report. http://www.idofishing.com/forum/showflat.php/Number/1155047/fpart/1/annual-flyin-trip-report-722-728 To say we were jacked up with anticipation for this year’s trip was an understatement. We were hoping they were in the same general area, but you never know until you start fishing to see if they are there or not. We got to the cabin on the lake on Sunday night July 21st and started fishing. The plan was to have the 2 boats split up and go to two locations we had previously found. My brother Al in my boat, and my Dad and brother Chris in the second boat. We took off and got to our spots and started fishing. Within minutes I got the 1st fish and was a nice 27 inch walleye. I could not believe it. My brother Al got an eater size and then it slowed down and were not seeing fish on the locator. I tried to call my Dad on the walkie to see if they were getting anything over at their spot. It wasn’t working so we headed on over. When I pulled up my Dad said why did you now answer on the walkie? I said I never got your calls. Then he said we are hammering them over here and have caught at least 10 already. That was what I wanted to hear. The walleye were in the same spot as last year and they were here in large #’s. Over the course of 2 hours we boated at least 30 walleye and I boated a 29 ¾ inch beast. We were on cloud 9 knowing we still had 5 full days of fishing left. To make a long story short, we pounded our 2 spots for 5 days straight and were rewarded with many BIG walleye. It was very special to me because when I was fishing with my Dad on the trip I got my biggest and he landed it and he caught his biggest and I was able to land it for him. My favorite story of the trip though was when I was fishing with by brother Al. We were pulling spinners with crawlers on this flat and we came up on the break and I had 4 big arcs on my Lowrance HDS5. I told him to get ready because they are right under our boat. Seconds later Al set the hook and the rod just bent over and drag started peeling off his reel. I told him he had on a big ones as the big one I got the day before did the same thing. Then I felt a bite on my line and I set the hook. I felt a nice fish on the line as well and it was fighting hard. I looked at my brother Al and said we have a double on big fish. I could move my fish at least so I knew it wasn’t as big as his so I started to put pressure on it and pulled in a 24 inch walleye and was scrambling to get it off and throw it back in the water. Just about the time I did that, I wheeled around grabbed the net, and put by brothers fish in the net. It was absolutely crazy! His ended up being 30 ¼ inches. All in all we landed many big fish. My biggest was a personal best of 31 inches with 16.5 inch girth, my brother Al 30 ¼ inches with 15.5 inch girth, my dad with a thick 29 incher, and my brother Chris with his personal best of a 29 incher. Both myself and my brother Al are getting replica’s made.
