My Dad, Brother Al, Brother Chris, and I just returned on Saturday from our Annual Fly-in Trip. We spent 5 days chasing BIG walleye and were not disappointed.

Looks like an awesome trip. Great job guys

   

Looks and sounds like you had an awesome and very special trip with your dad and brothers . I am sure those memories will last you all a lifetime .
