Can I have beer in the cooler for my shore lunch ?

Nope….

Check the regs closely. I don’t think you can have alcohol in your boat at any time except when you are transporting to your lodging destination. 

Thanks , don’t need any trouble .

 Nope….

Ditto on avoiding Canada. With all the rules, I will spend my vacation money state side. No check points at the Mn state line. 

There are checkpoints, just not for beer  will they make beer an AIS too? 

It’s all good spend a week up in Canada work five days then spend a week at Everets ! Life is good 

Sorry, but I had to laugh out loud when reading this post and responses….    you guys need to get off the beaten path up there…    

You can transport beer accross the border, but there is a limit of 1 24 pack per person or you can buy it at the duty free store as you cross the border. None in the boat on the lake.

           

My personal philosophy is to act responsible and not give a CO a reason to cite me for stupidity. Its great to have a beer or two for shore lunch and I personally have never had a problem with it. You can’t beat the fishing and remoteness of Canada. If that means I have to forego a beer until I get back to my cabin.. so be it. Fishing and the experience far outweigh the need to have a beer while in a boat.
