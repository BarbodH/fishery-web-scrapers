Check the regs closely. I don’t think you can have alcohol in your boat at any time except when you are transporting to your lodging destination. My dad used to fish Canada in the late 60s and early 70s. He would tell stories about the border guards commenting on literally a boatload of beer, “are you sure you boys have enough?”. That’s a far cry from now when you can’t have any with you. Maybe the old man was right when he talks about the good old days?

Ditto on avoiding Canada. With all the rules, I will spend my vacation money state side. No check points at the Mn state line. Nut

You can transport beer accross the border, but there is a limit of 1 24 pack per person or you can buy it at the duty free store as you cross the border. None in the boat on the lake.

My personal philosophy is to act responsible and not give a CO a reason to cite me for stupidity. Its great to have a beer or two for shore lunch and I personally have never had a problem with it. You can’t beat the fishing and remoteness of Canada. If that means I have to forego a beer until I get back to my cabin.. so be it. Fishing and the experience far outweigh the need to have a beer while in a boat. Below are a few reasons I think about when it comes to fishing in Ontario…
