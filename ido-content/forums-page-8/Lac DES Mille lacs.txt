Who make s a chip that has this body of water? Lowrance HDS 5Thx

Navionics premium for Canada. Not sure if the most recent versions are high definition or not. I believe they are HD now. For Lowrance you have to go into the set ups menus to tell it to reference the correct part of the chip. Have not done it for a while. I am using in an LMS-522 and quite sure the HDS-5 requires the same or similar.

Awesome. Big body of water

Steve- Have you fished it before? Where are you staying? I have been going once or twice a summer for the last 10 years or so. An extended family get together. Fairly popular for Wisconsin anglers. Not likely the place for a trophy waldo, but the action can be very good and the average size decent. More like a giant river system with the amount of islands and cover for protection. Somewhat like Rainy Lake. Some pretty good sized Pike and Smallies as a bonus. Send me a PM and I can get you some more info.

Pm sentThanks booche. Where ya from?
