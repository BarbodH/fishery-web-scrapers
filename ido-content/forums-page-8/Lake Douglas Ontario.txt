Going on my first fly in this June.  If anyone has been to lake Douglas or the surrounding lakes before feel free to share favorite jigs and lures for walleye and pike. Already starting to stock up on floating rapalas. I’ll also be checking with our outfitter, they should be able to give me some advice.

Anyone ever take their vexilar with on a fly in? That’s all I have at the momoent for a fishfinder and I’m wondering if it will do the job. No plans to buy the high speed transducer, just roll with the iceducer.
