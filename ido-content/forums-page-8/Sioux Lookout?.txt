 I will be heading up to lac Seul next week. Any info on the walleye bite and to what dept and colors?

I was up in Sioux Narrows on LOTW last weekend. I donâ€™t know if patterns can carry over but I was doing very well on a gold jig(18 walleyes in 1 hour). We were finding our fish in 30-40 FOW. Good Luck

Gold and pink for colors.

I am not going this year for the first time in 8 years but normally WalleyeCentral.com will have quite a bit of up to date Lac Seul info. My best guess from usually fishing the last week of June to 2nd week of July is that the Later the iceout the sooner fish move to main lake humps and points. Crawlers will be coming into there own up there in the next couple of week. For me nothing beats a Chartuese Sunburst 3/16 ounce H2O Precision Jig from BFISHN tackle with a half crawler around the 1st of July on Lac Seul. Also when a good wind is blowing in shallow rocks/reef, casting cranks and plastics work great. PM me if you have any specific Sioux Lookout area of Lac Seul questions.
