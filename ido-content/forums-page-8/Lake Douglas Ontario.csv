If anyone has been to lake Douglas or the surrounding lakes before feel free to share favorite jigs and lures for walleye and pike. Already starting to stock up on floating rapalas. I’ll also be checking with our outfitter, they should be able to give me some advice.  Matt"

1065130,patk,2012-05-03 03:53:00,1997,"Bueller here A couple years ago we took a small boat up to the Pasha lake area. Since we had the small boat that also meant we didn’t have all the toys aka electronics. I took my FL-8 along with just the ice ducer. Thankfully it was earlier in the year and it didn’t take us long to find the preferred depth. We caught a ton of fish and likely would have done so without the Vex. However it would have taken longer and eliminated dead water on a lake that was new to us. While that worked there was a drawback. Our search pattern was to troll with cranks until locating an active fish or two, then switch to vertical jigging. To get a read on the vex I had to hold the transducer in the water with one hand and my rod in the other. Not the greatest and did I mention it was earlier in the season?(cold hand). Absolutely would bring my flasher again but with one small change. I bought a open water transducer this winter. Now I need to find the suction cup mount that’s a little hard to find. Try google and a shop in the north metro should come up that sells electronics. They should be able to help you out."
