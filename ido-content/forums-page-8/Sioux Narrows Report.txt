Fished on Saturday and Sunday out of Totem Lodge. Saturday started overcast a little rain but ended warm and sunny. Caught our walleye in the morning in 30 FOW. I was using an orange jig. I caught 8 walleye in a few hours. After shore lunch we casted for notherns. Biggest and my PB was a 33 incher on a orange cyclops. My wife caught 4 walleyes while casting for northerns on a yellow 5 of diamonds.

Did you head out to Yellow Girl or Lobstick Bay? Normally I head up Long Bay and sometimes beyond Yellow Girl out by Crescent and other close by islands.

We mostly stayed in Long Bay. But with all the bays and islands we could have been.

OK, thanks.

We were up Tues til Saturday the 9th. We fished Lobstick 2 days with lots of action bass, pike & walleye. found them in 10′ or less. Did snag an unmarked Native net, NICE!. Fished down dead broke area and found the fish scattered but most in 30’+. Did get my best Canadian eye at 31.5″ out of 50′! Caught most eyes b.bouncing w/ gulp crawler. Otherwise we were casting gulp or shad raps. We had great weather, my buds up at our cabin this week, fishing slowed and weather was horrible!! Another group coming in tomorrow, hope they have better weather, can’t wait to get back up! DL
