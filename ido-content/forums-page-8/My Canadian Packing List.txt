You taking a uhaul truck? Lol how many days are you staying up there? And what are you fishin for? Good luck and make sure to take some pictures

Sounds like you are going “Into the Wild….”

only thing i saw missing was teflon foldable sleeping bags. they can save you from hypothermia.

Chad owns and operates a fishing lodge.Some of the lakes he fishes, good list to have on hand as its pretty desolate in spots. Hoping to get up there again next year.
