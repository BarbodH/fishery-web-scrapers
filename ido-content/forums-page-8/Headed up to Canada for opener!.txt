Leaving tomorrow morning! I can’t wait! This will be a new lake and a first fishing the opener. Trout, walleyes, pike, and muskie look out!

Where you heading? I am heading to the Dryden area next weekend. I cannot wait either. 

We’ll be about an hour and 45 mins north of there on Cliff Lake

I will be about 19 hours NW of Cliff Lake in Manitoba next month…   Good luck everyone !!!  (like you need luck in Canada) 

Good fishing have fun!!! Be in MB next month
