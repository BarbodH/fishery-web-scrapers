To help speed things up for your outfitter, I highly recommend you purchase your Ontario Fishing (and Hunting) License online.

Just bought mine last night. The website is very simple and easy to use.

 The outdoor card was received in twenty day, so order early.

Bought mine in January, system works well, now just to get Manitoba to get on board with online license…

you can do it by mail.. just takes 3 weeks minimum. I found that out this AM and we leave in 19 days so   

That will be tight G, they took about a 2 weeks for us and they did not send us an actual license but we did get a new renewed outdoor card. We figured that the MNR could figure it out through the card if we got checked but it is still confusing as to why we didnt get an actual piece of paper for our fishing license

Yes – I agree. 

Does anyone know if I can still print my license and a question for Chad – Is Lake Nipigon water level up or down? I know everything from Atikokan to Thunder Bay is over full. Kakabeka Falls had spray coming over the top of it!
