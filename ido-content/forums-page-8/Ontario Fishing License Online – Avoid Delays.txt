To help speed things up for your outfitter, I highly recommend you purchase your Ontario Fishing (and Hunting) License online. Here is the link https://www1.on.wildlifelicense.com/start.php Remember, you also need the Outdoor Card. For existing license holders, you can also renew at the same web site. Call with questions 866 333 5943 or email [email protected]

Just bought mine last night. The website is very simple and easy to use.

That will be tight G, they took about a 2 weeks for us and they did not send us an actual license but we did get a new renewed outdoor card. We figured that the MNR could figure it out through the card if we got checked but it is still confusing as to why we didnt get an actual piece of paper for our fishing license

Yes – I agree. I recommend everyone prints off a copy from the internet page, as well as, have a copy of the receipt showing the license and Outdoor Card have been paid. Since this is a new program, common sense would lead me to believe the CO’s will be more flexible when it comes to being checked.

Does anyone know if I can still print my license and a question for Chad – Is Lake Nipigon water level up or down? I know everything from Atikokan to Thunder Bay is over full. Kakabeka Falls had spray coming over the top of it!
