For those of you heading to Canada fishing this year Navionics has recently updated a bunch of lakes, if you have a map chip that qualifies for the Freshest Data check it out. Also Navionics has a dedicated Canadian map chip.

ijust picked up the latest CAN. chip. i have a Gen 1 HDS. do i need to do anything to that unit? I am current on all updates.
