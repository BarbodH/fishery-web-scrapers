Trying a new lake this year!! Any pointers for this lake? We are going up for the Canadian opener(May 19)

Don’t know much about Cliff Lake, but I would assume it would be pretty close to all the other lakes in the neighborhood. I fished Perrault Lake at Rainbow Point Resort, right on 105 just north of Cliff Lake, for a number of years. The fishing is OK, but not lights out. With the early spring, walleyes will be a little harder to locate, as they will be spawned out & back out in the lakes. We seemed to catch more big pike than big walleyes up there. Hope you have a good trip. 

Message me…been there a couple times…very fun multispecies lake…

Butch Furtman does a show on Cliff Lake very year. Here is a link to his website. There is a video available on Cliff Lake. It is by the way a beautiful lake—a least what you can see from the road.



Yeah I watched the video! It looked like a fun lake so we figured we would give it a shot for something different! I have never fished for lake trout or muskie but my father in law has so were excited.
