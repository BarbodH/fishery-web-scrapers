Has anybody fished on dogtooth near Kenora? I hear its a big fish lake and not a numbers lake? what is the most productive method of catching fish on it in August? thanks

I fished it once about 10+ years ago and didnt do very well but that was after a huge rain and storms went threw. It is known for big fish but I think the best time from what I have heard is in the fall for them. The lake also has a ton of logs laying in it in places and can be hard to fish. It is also connected to another lake that we couldnt get to because the water was high and we couldnt get the boat under the bridge/tresel to get to it. I believe they have removed it though. Seemed like most people were headed to that place when we were there. It possibly could be good fishing at the right time but there are better places to fish in Canada. I think this lake is probably to accessable and right off of the road and probably fished hard back in the day. They do have a real nice camp ground there though.

My photo album paints a much different picture. I think it speaks volumes when you dont take pictures of 27″ fish anymore. Its not a lake for everyone. Ive talked to people who hated the lake. I cant tell you that you are going to catch a ton of trophies. But if you figure the lake out….well……you will be leaving the lake saying……only 358 days left til I get to come back.
