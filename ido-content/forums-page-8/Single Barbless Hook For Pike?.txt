Any lure recommendations for trophy pike with a single barbless hook? I have single bladed spinnerbaits and buzzbaits. Have considered swapping out the hooks on spoons. I’m considering large jig heads with reapers. Any suggestions?

Can’t you just bend the barbs closed on the lures you have now??

Yes, that’s what I’m doing with all my single hook lures. Treble hook count as one hook (I forgot, so I don’t need to swap out a treble for a single hook). Anyhow I’m trying to come up with other productive lures that have one hook (which I’ll pinch the barbs down) besids spoons and spinnerbaits. I’ve thought of the old sluggos, but never used the big size and unsure if they are very producutive. Also considering trying jig/pig combos as well.

For what it is worth…

Some of the old timers I used to go to Canada with are still using Dare Devils and such with good luck, black and white or red and white…old standards 

   


Usually, when they say “single hook,” that means ONE POINT, and doen’t cover trebles. Manitoba requires a single, barbless hook. A pinched barb meets the standard. I fly-fish and don’t think I’ve ever lost a toothy critter because on barbless hooks, and it makes release a lot simpler.

There are some problems actually with how I could possibly down rig the lakers with a single hook that could be attached and used in my spoons. Though that might work well and have no problems with how the bigger giant hookers would be able to keep up.
