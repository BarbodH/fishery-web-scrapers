Leaving for a week to Ontario on Sunday at 5 am! I’ll toss up a report when we get back! We’ll be staying at Mahkwa and fishing the belly of beast for five straight days.

got 2 b cooler there 

Fished mahkwa last week of May this year…. belly of the beast? We booked for the opener next year. A buddy just got back from a week at Lost Island Lodge, and they killed eyes in 20 to 25 fow; ran to Bear narrows every day. what are your favorite areas near Mahkwa for a July trip?

We worked areas all over. The mid lake humps and points closest to deep water really kicked out the most fish. Our best areas were the pine point area, the Aldous Bay area, and out near Dominion Island.
