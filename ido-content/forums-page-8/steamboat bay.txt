Hey, fellow IDOers I’m heading up to Gawleys little beaver lodge on Lac Seul here in early august. Just wondering if anybody is having any luck in steamboat bay, or Mckenzie bay now? I am sure the sandbanks are giving up a few eh? God bless canada!!

Steamboat hadn’t really turned on as of last week although there were some in there. I suspect this week is a different story. McKenzie was good – didn’t try the Sandbanks though (no need to battle crowds). KT
