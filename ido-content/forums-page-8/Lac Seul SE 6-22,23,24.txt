 We launched out of Deception Bay and for the most part fished Sen Bay. We spent some time in Archer with no results. Our best fish were 24 to 26 inches with a lot in the slot.Our party used various methods with good success. Pitching jigs on wind swept points, vertical jigging with a minnow tipped jig , lindy rigging and bottom bouncer. Our biggest fish came on a lindy rig with a spinner and a bottom bouncer with a spinner or slow death rig. The lindy rigs were baited with a crawler or minnow. The bottom bouncer were baited with ½ of a crawler.  Out best fishing was in 28 to 32 feet of water.<BTW> The may fly hatch was still on. 

Pictures? 

 We use a very slow retrieve and the fish don’t seem to have any recovery problem. I will give the pictures a try.
