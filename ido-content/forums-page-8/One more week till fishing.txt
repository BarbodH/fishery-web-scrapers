Next Thursday we will head up to Totem Lodge on Lake of the woods. We have been there before and I am very excited since this is my main vacation of the year. I got the rods and reels and tackle (Pink and orange and gold jigs) ready last night. The next week will drag. Even though we will be fishing 3 days I will only be fishing two since we are taking my 15 month old we are splitting the duties of watching him. Is there anything fun to do in the Sioux Narrows area with a toddler?

 Trolling? An extra body in the boat means an extra line (or is it 2 in Canada?)

I’m sure my wife would love that. Might as well teach him early though.

I would be careful with the “extra” rod. In Minnesota the child has to be able to hold the rod and be able to reel the fish in to have an extra rod. I’m not trying to be a Debbie Downer, but just seen a few posts on here where it has been discussed. I also ran into this problem when my daughter was about 4 years old. We both had suckers floating under bobbers. The CO came up on us and asked my daughter to reel her line in. She did it like a champ and he was on his way. Good luck on your trip and I hope the week doesn’t drag by to slow for you.

Just pack plenty of snacks and older cheap toys so if they go overboard no big deal! Make a few short trips in a day rather than all day excursions. And keep the life jacket on at ALL TIMES! He may scream but when he gets older it will become second nature and he won’t fight you about putting it on. My boy(3 1/2) and now my daughter(9 months) have booth been in the boat since about 6 months old. Good luck and have fun.

We’ve been going for about 10 years now to Sioux Narrows and don’t recall anything but souvenir shops, there is a ice cream shop next to a miniature golf place right in town. Otherwise there’s Kenora?

Also, can you let us know how you do? I head up for June 23 – July 7, so any help would be appreciated.
