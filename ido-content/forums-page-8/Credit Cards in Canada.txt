Its a good idea to call your CC company and let them know you’re traveling to Canada. We’ve had several guests have their cards shut down for suspicious looking transactions when in fact they are just using their card out of country. As you can imagine, it can be a big surprise when you go to purchase gas and your card is rejected. 

Good advice. Happened to me about 4 years ago… now I call a week ahead of time and good to go  Luckily there was 4 of us as I only have a Cabelas VISA… my brother in law got some of my points on that trip…  

I know, it’s a bunch of bs. I’ve had mine locked just going to SD. I also hate having to enter my zip every time I want gas.

Can’t you simply phone your CC company and alert them? Or is there no phone service that far up nort?



i had mine blocked in madison once thats only 4 hours from where live. it is annoying but if it were stolen it would’nt be annoying anymore!



On my trip to canada this spring credit card was stopped for Candadian purchases. One phone call and no problems after that. Next time I will call ahead to let them know. Lot of friends have had credit cards stolen and the crooks run up the debt incredibly fast. Have no problem with credit card company being careful.
