Anyone ever been to O’Sullivan lake near Nakina, Ontario? Headed there in July and would love to hear what to expect/prepare for. Thanks!

James and I were there, not last winter, but the winter prior. Expect big walleyes and great laker action. Big water, find those underwater humps and you’ll find fish!

Thanks Chad! Appreciate the info!
