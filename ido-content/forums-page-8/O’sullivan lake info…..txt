Anyone ever been to O’Sullivan lake near Nakina, Ontario? Headed there in July and would love to hear what to expect/prepare for. Thanks!

James and I were there, not last winter, but the winter prior. Expect big walleyes and great laker action. Big water, find those underwater humps and you’ll find fish!
