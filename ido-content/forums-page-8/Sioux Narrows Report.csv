Caught our walleye in the morning in 30 FOW. I was using an orange jig. I caught 8 walleye in a few hours. After shore lunch we casted for notherns. Biggest and my PB was a 33 incher on a orange cyclops. My wife caught 4 walleyes while casting for northerns on a yellow 5 of diamonds. Sunday we got to our spot, just got our minnows in and a severe storm rolled in. We got out of there and headed back under strong winds and heavy rain. Went back out an hour later. I tied an gold jig on (after advice from other idoers) Hit a large shelf in 30-40 FOW. In one hours I had 18 walleyes. Out fished every one 3-1. Did some nothern fishing in the afternoon and got a 20 inch walleye on a spoon. Great trip minus some of the weather."

1075521,tgruenke,2012-06-12 17:39:00,587,We mostly stayed in Long Bay. But with all the bays and islands we could have been.

Did snag an unmarked Native net, NICE!. Fished down dead broke area and found the fish scattered but most in 30’+. Did get my best Canadian eye at 31.5″ out of 50′! Caught most eyes b.bouncing w/ gulp crawler. Otherwise we were casting gulp or shad raps. We had great weather, my buds up at our cabin this week, fishing slowed and weather was horrible!! Another group coming in tomorrow, hope they have better weather, can’t wait to get back up! DL"
