I fished Perrault Lake at Rainbow Point Resort, right on 105 just north of Cliff Lake, for a number of years. The fishing is OK, but not lights out. With the early spring, walleyes will be a little harder to locate, as they will be spawned out & back out in the lakes. We seemed to catch more big pike than big walleyes up there. Hope you have a good trip."

1060343,John Peterson,2012-04-19 05:41:00,331,Butch Furtman does a show on Cliff Lake very year. Here is a link to his website. There is a video available on Cliff Lake. It is by the way a beautiful lake—a least what you can see from the road. http://butchfurtman.com/pages/videos.php

1060435,Paul Heise,2012-04-19 15:09:00,723,Yeah I watched the video! It looked like a fun lake so we figured we would give it a shot for something different! I have never fished for lake trout or muskie but my father in law has so were excited.
