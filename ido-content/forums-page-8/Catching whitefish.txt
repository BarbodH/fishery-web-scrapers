I am going to be at Eagle Lake, Ontario, the second week in August, this year. One day i would like to devote to catching whitefish. Two years ago I was there in June and everyone said that they are easier to catch later into the summer months. August, I hope, is one of those months. Any information on the how, when, and what, to use, to catch this fish,will be appreciated.

It would be best to speak with a local. Whitefish can be 100′ deep or just under the surface. Anything and I mean anything….from a fly rod to a crank bait will catch them. Some time on the water with sonar and you should be able to find them. Low light periods look for them feeding on the surface.

Small spoons work well. I like to use white jigs and a minnow. I fish fairly aggressive snapping it to get them going. When you find a school it takes a bit to turn them on but when it happens it is crazy. Good luck they spawn in August sept so they could be fired up. They will be grouped up

find some moving water… jigging just like for a walleye
