Seemed about 4 ft. low from the looks of the banks and land vegetation. It was our second May trip to mahkwa, and levels were also low last time. Didn’t hinder the navigation if you knew where you were going and paid attention, but definitely had to slow down in a few areas as we wandered to familiar honey holes. The walleye fishing was excellent, but smallies were scarce, although we didn’t target them a bunch. Water temps in the range of 52 to 59 thourout the week, whcih we were told by staff was about 3 weeks ahead of a normal season. Ice was out in April."
