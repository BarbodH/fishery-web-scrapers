 Needed water level and fishing conditions in the Sioux Lookout area.

Just got back from a week at Mahkwa Lodge on Saturday. Was told that water levels are a bit lower than what is normal for this time of year. Seemed about 4 ft. low from the looks of the banks and land vegetation. It was our second May trip to mahkwa, and levels were also low last time. Didn’t hinder the navigation if you knew where you were going and paid attention, but definitely had to slow down in a few areas as we wandered to familiar honey holes. The walleye fishing was excellent, but smallies were scarce, although we didn’t target them a bunch. Water temps in the range of 52 to 59 thourout the week, whcih we were told by staff was about 3 weeks ahead of a normal season. Ice was out in April.

Fish spawned out a month early, water is just a little low compared to normal and quite warm. If you have July spots, now’s the time to pound em. Search points with good structure, they were producing the best.
