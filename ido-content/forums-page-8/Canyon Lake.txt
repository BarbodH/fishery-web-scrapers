First time up to Canyon Lake , any info on this lake would be great .thanks Thomas

Thomas – I don’t have any specific info on Canyon, but if it’s like your bread and butter, typical Canadian Shield Lake, you can expect lots of action and NO other boat traffic. Currently, we are finding bigger walleyes near weeds in 5 – 10fow. It seems the smaller fish are staying deep. If it’s a “tea” stained lake, stick to the bright colors like firetiger, and fluorescents in pink, green, yellow & orange. If it’s a clear lake, try the neutral colors first. Also, look for those feeder creeks and flow. You should see bait fish up there, especially if weeds are emerging or present on the surface. Where ever you find bait fish, the game fish won’t be too far behind. Good luck there and don’t forget to post your pics with success techniques and lures when you get back!

Thank you very much for the info . This should be a fun trip .
