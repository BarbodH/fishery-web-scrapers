Has anyone ever fished Neawagank Lake north of Pickle with Pickle Lake Outfitters?

back as a young teenager me and my dad would drive to pickle lake every summer and fly out we fished this lake a couple times! Walleye fishing was always out of this world! I remember we would take 20 dozen crawlers and run out the first or second full day of fishing! But by that time you were so sick of catching walleye it was time for something else anyway! good luck to ya!
