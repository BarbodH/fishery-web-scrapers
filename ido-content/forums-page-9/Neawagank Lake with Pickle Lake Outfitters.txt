Has anyone ever fished Neawagank Lake north of Pickle with Pickle Lake Outfitters?

back as a young teenager me and my dad would drive to pickle lake every summer and fly out we fished this lake a couple times! Walleye fishing was always out of this world! I remember we would take 20 dozen crawlers and run out the first or second full day of fishing! But by that time you were so sick of catching walleye it was time for something else anyway!

Thanks for your reply TheguN Have been going fishing for over 35 yrs to your wonderful country on fly-ins and drive in trips Have gone the last 10 yrs out of Armstrong and Pickle Lake Have always had a great time and caught lots of fish,some years more than others.
