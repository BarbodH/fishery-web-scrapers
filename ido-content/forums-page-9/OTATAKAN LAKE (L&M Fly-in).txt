Hello All,My buddy and I are heading to Otatakan Lake with L&M Fly-in out of Dryden Ontario. Our trip is July 17-25. I am looking for any extra information or tips! Even if you have information from your last Canada trip that was at a different location, please share it all with me. I am looking for information on rod, reel, line, tackle, jigs,bait, plastics, food for the trip, packing, etc. Basically, anything you want to share with me will be helpful. By the way, we will mainly be targeting walleyes but do plan to northern fish a bit as well. Thanks guys!

I’ll been going to Lake of the woods for the last 12 years, simply can’t beat a bottom bouncer with a crawler harness or original rapala in tow! 

Thanks for the response. How big of bottom bouncer do you use…i know it can depend on wind and how many are in the boat with you, but I am planning on bringing 1/2, 1, and 1.5 oz along. Did you use single hook or double hook spinner setups? What time of year do you usually go?
