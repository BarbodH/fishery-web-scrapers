Returned last weekend from the NW side of Lac Seul. The bite was a little slow. We still managed to catch a healthy amount of fish..~60 walleyes being our best day. 95% of fish caught on jig/minnow with basically a deadstick approach in 7-12′ of water. They wanted it SLOW!! Weather was cold and often wet, but we still had a great time. Largest Pike was a skinny 35″, largest walleye was 25″…No real hogs landed. Stayed at Timberlane Lodge and polished off a few Molsons with the owner on our last night..nice folks. Did I mention I bagged my lower unit Pasha Lake in 2 mos. Chad won’t mind if I bag one of his lower units Justin

Yep – we got the same weather last week. Your description of the bite is bang on. Well – you won’t be the first to introduce my prop to Canadian Shield granite, and I am sure you won’t be the last. Let’s plan a trip to Onaman this time around! I have a fall spot I want to check out.

thanks for the report, we are headed up to gawleys little beaver lodge on lac seul over the 4th hope the action picks up by then. How and where did you smoke your lower unit? if you don’t mind me asking. I am just curious if you had the chip and this wasn’t on there or what. Also did you make it to mckenzie?

 The last island in the back of McKenzie bay…a mere hour from the resort at full speed. A have a Navionics chip and it was not listed. Owner of resort had no idea the rock was there. My boat is deep and draws a lot of water…I would imagine most of the boats skim right over it. The water is low right now as well. Good Luck
