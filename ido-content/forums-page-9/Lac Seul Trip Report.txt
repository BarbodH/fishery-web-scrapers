Returned last weekend from the NW side of Lac Seul. The bite was a little slow. We still managed to catch a healthy amount of fish..~60 walleyes being our best day. 95% of fish caught on jig/minnow with basically a deadstick approach in 7-12′ of water. They wanted it SLOW!! Weather was cold and often wet, but we still had a great time. Largest Pike was a skinny 35″, largest walleye was 25″…No real hogs landed. Stayed at Timberlane Lodge and polished off a few Molsons with the owner on our last night..nice folks. Did I mention I bagged my lower unit  

Yep – we got the same weather last week. Your description of the bite is bang on. 



thanks for the report, we are headed up to gawleys little beaver lodge on lac seul over the 4th hope the action picks up by then. How and where did you smoke your lower unit? if you don’t mind me asking. I am just curious if you had the chip and this wasn’t on there or what. Also did you make it to mckenzie?



wow sorry to hear that. thats 1 good reason to have a kicker.when u say back of mckenzie I am guessing the last island on the way up turkey creek? with the water low is there a beach now at big sand banks?
