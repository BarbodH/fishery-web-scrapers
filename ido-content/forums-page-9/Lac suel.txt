Been up there 3 or 4 imes but I have a question 4 the those that know the body of water better than i do. I have the option to go the first week of July or toward the end of July. When is the best time to hit it up there. Would one time be better than the other.

we went over the 4th this year and the other boat in our group caught a lot of nice walleyes pulling cranks in 5 to 15 feet. In my boat we tryed to force the jigging patterns that have been succesfull in years past and had spotty success. We booked for mid july next year at gawleys little beaver lodge near ear falls. Which part of the lake are you going to?

Many of you probably think it is strange to be talking about Canada in July now, but I really don’t ice fish. Therefore, it is my therapy during the winter to map out and plan my big open water trips during the downtime.Another big question for you Lac Suel and Mahkwa vets. If we end up going the third week of July – would it even be worth working Bray Bay/Bray lake and Vaughn lake? Correct me if i am wrong, but I assume our time would be better spent in the bigger open water basins working wind blown points, islands, and reefs/bumps. Areas like Pauli Light, pine pt, Angilcan mission, Dominion Islands, etc.I will basically be guiding 5 of my closest friends for a week. If you know the Mahkwa area well and are willing to share some info. or go to spots for mid to late July, please pm me. Happy Fishing
