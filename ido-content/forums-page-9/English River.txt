Got back last week from the English River, great time as always lots of nubmers with some size mixed in. Big walleye of the trip a 30 incher, and biggest pike was about 43 inches.

Where did you stay? Its been a while since I have fished that system, but it sure is a good one.  

That is sure a fun river system to fish! I need to get back up there soon!

My mom and dad are heading up on Thursday morrning. Maybe next year Canada will stop hating me and let me back
