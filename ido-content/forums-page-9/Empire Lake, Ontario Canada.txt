I am heading to Empire lake in oct. for a Moose hunt/fishing trip. Mostly going to moose hunt but we will be staying in a cabin on empire lake. We are the only cabin on the lake. Wondering if anyone has fished this lake or been to the area. Iâ€™m going to try and limit my fishing tackel to jigs/plastics as we are going to have a lot of gear for hunting. Four guy trip. 2 bulls/ 2 calfs is what we have for tags. Any moose hunting tips would be great. I have never been to canada so this is going to be a two birds with one stone trip for me. Any advise would be great.  Thanks Wallster ><((((>
