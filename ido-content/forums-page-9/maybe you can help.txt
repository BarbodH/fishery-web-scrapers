hey guys i leave for canada in just under 2 weeks and as i do more research i am finding out that its not that easy to get in ….. i have 2 beer drinking charges on my record one a under age poss and the other a drinking in a public parking lot both are minor charges down here but do you think they will cause me problem at the border

Call the Canada boarder patrol directly. I would hate to show up and they turn you back!

i cross the border quite routinely with clients duck hunting and with friends fishing.

your possession is not a problem at all. not sure on the other charge. may want to call as Stuwest suggested btu i think you will be just fine. If you had 2 DUI’s and you are not a celebrity than you will not get in if they check you.

I don’t think you will have any problems. Neither of your previous infractions are considered “criminal” in nature either here or Canada, where DUI’s are considered felonies in Canada which is where you run into problems. A phone call as stated would clear it up though, enjoy your trip.

Make the callIt’s cheaper than the gas if you get turned back

well i made the call and after 3 hours of being transferd around from person to person they finaly gave me phone numbers to the canadian embessy’s in the usa …… only problem with that is you can only talk to them with questions through email which has a expected answer date of 2 -3 weeks  any other ideas of a easier way to find out my answers

Call Kevin Begin (Superintendent at Fort Francis) (807) -274-5281

thanks chad for the extra numbers.i hvent been able to get ahold of either of them but i left them messages so hopefully ill hear back tommorrow

Sounds good. If you still run into problems, call me

hey guys just wanted to thank you again for your help…….i made it into canada with no problems and had a blast up there we caught over 100 pike and close to 100 walleye 

Sounds like an awesome trip! Congrats
