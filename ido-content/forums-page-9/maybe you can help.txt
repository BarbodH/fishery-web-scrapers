Call the Canada boarder patrol directly. I would hate to show up and they turn you back!

i cross the border quite routinely with clients duck hunting and with friends fishing. GO TO A CANADIAN CONSULATE AND GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT NOW. Their attitude toward alcohol offenses is quite different than ours, but if you work with them, you can get it straightened out.

your possession is not a problem at all. not sure on the other charge. may want to call as Stuwest suggested btu i think you will be just fine. If you had 2 DUI’s and you are not a celebrity than you will not get in if they check you.

I don’t think you will have any problems. Neither of your previous infractions are considered “criminal” in nature either here or Canada, where DUI’s are considered felonies in Canada which is where you run into problems. A phone call as stated would clear it up though, enjoy your trip.

bigmocs If you get a chance, you can do to the Pasha Lake forum and click on the discussion I posted on border crossings. Also, I published an article in Bear Hunting Magazine on the topic. You can access that article at http://www.bear-hunting.com/issue.cfm Or better yet, call me and I can answer some of the more common questions. 866 333 5943 ask for Chad Good Luck.

well i made the call and after 3 hours of being transferd around from person to person they finaly gave me phone numbers to the canadian embessy’s in the usa …… only problem with that is you can only talk to them with questions through email which has a expected answer date of 2 -3 weeks  any other ideas of a easier way to find out my answers
