Tying a new camp this year. We will be fishing Wabigoon and Dinorwic starting the second week of June. Looks like a lot of water. Any insight would be appreciated. We are group of 14 this year Ages 12-68. Mostly walleye-pike guys with a few interested in bass and lake trout. We are also considering a one day fly out. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help and looking forward to providing an update upon our return.

Here’s what I know. I have been fishing every June on Lake Abrams (Sioux Lookout, ON) since 1997. I always stay at Winoga Lodge. Dick Mansfield and his son, Troy can help you out with fishing Abrams, Minnetaki, Botsford or Lac Suel. Good, hard working people. Check them out at http://www.winoga.com. They also have a couple of fly-in fishing camps that I hear are terrific, but I’ve never been to them.

Owned a home on wabigoon for 5 years, lot’s of walleye, northern and smallies. Lot’s of reefs and as far as I know there still isn’t a chip for the lake. Trolled lures a lot with gold walleye diver the best. Used lindy rigs and casting jigs. Wasn’t into spinner rigs like I am now but I bet they would work very well. Personal best there was a 30″ walleye and a 44″ northern but they are on the skinny side, don’t think the walleye broke 8 lbs. very stained lake. It is actually a chain of 7 lakes and a couple are pretty clear. Pm me if you want more info. Who’s camp are you staying at?
