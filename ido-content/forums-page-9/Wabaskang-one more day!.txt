Grind through this last day of work, then start packing the truck…leaving tomorrow for Wabaskang again!   See you Saturday Tall Pines!Oh yeah…and please God, if anything awful has to happen, let it be on the way home; AFTER I’ve caught some fish! Amen.

Good luck. I took my family up there for a couple years. Stayed at Sleepy Dog Cabins. Great place to stay and a nice lake. Plus it was only about a mile down the road to an access to Lac Suel.
