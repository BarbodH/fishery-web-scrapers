A phenominal week of walleye fishing is what I expected, and Lac Seul didn’t dissapoint. At times, we were hauling in a fish a minute in our 3 man boat. (The 24’s and 25″ inchers slowed us down…) 

Glad you had a good trip ! That picture of the sun is outstanding. 

Awesome trip men!! Very cool pics!

Sounds like a blast!
