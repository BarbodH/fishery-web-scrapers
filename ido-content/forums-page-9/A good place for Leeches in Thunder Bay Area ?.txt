Six of us are leaving for Nakina on Tuesday morning and the place where we have gotten our leeches, seems to have closed. Any suggestions as to where we can get good quality and pricing for a pound or 2, without going much out of our way, will be much appreciated.

Hello –

what does a pound of leeches go for in Ontario? we normally use mostly crawlers but are going to get some leeches this year as well.
