I’m heading for Lac La Martre, NWT on June 26 – July 2 to fly-fish. Famous for big pike and Lakers (Grayling, too), and I get more and bigger ones on streamer flies than typical hardware casters. I’m looking for company, and would be glad to teach anyone how to do it, and how to tie the flies. There’s still room at the lodge.
