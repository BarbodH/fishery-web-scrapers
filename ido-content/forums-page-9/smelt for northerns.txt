I’m going to canada for the first time since I was a kid. My grandpa used to bring smelt in for catching large northerns. What is the best way to bring them in? Should I just freeze them, or I think he used to pack them in salt or do something to preserve them.

Can you even bring them in?DT

Welcome also!DT

Thanks for the info–I was told we could bring them as long as they were dead

Is that the same in all of Canada or just Ontario?

I know for a fact that you can not use them on LOTW!
