Going on a week long fly-in fishing trip in Aug. to Keeper Lake Ontario. Max depth is about 25′. I have no clue as what type of jigs/lures/colors in general work the best for walleye. What would you guys recomend as the best overall stuff to buy? It’s time to start stocking up. Thanks.

1/4 oz black jig

yellow jig or hammered gold little joe in the 10 foot weeds!

Orange jigs and tails  White tails work too  Have fun 

Jason,

I wouldn’t live by this rule….. for any lake
