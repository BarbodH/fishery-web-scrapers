Heading to Berry Lake ontario by sioux narrows in mid August for walleyes and have never been there. I understand the lake has not been surveyed, so no lake map/chip with depths or structures. Any information on locations to try, colors, bait, rigging would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

Try this chip Freedom Maps – “F41T South Ontario”. IT won’t have lake contours but should give you exterme detail of the area. I purchased mine at Marine General in Duluth. (218) 724-8833
