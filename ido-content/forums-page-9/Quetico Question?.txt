Anyone ever pack into Poohbah Lake, I am interested in the difficulty of canoeing the Maligne River as you enter it in spring. Also it looks a little marshy on the creek leading into the lake. Hopefully someone has entered this very remote section of Quetico and can share there expierence

Its been many years (over 20) that I’ve been to that lake. We found the portage going into the lake was rather dangerous and had a few fairly deep swamps we had to get through and opted out. Instead we dragged the canoes and gear up the Magline river to get to the lake. That took us a few hours or so to do, but we made it. Once we were there, the lake was awesome and not another group of people around. Not sure how the portages will be nowdays, but I would definitely get a newer map. finding the portage was a chore all its own. Good luck and have fun. The fishing was fantastic.

I remember an article on that lake in The Boundary Waters Journal magazine. I believe back issues and past article reprints are available on their web site.

I was there about 10 years ago. Both of the previous post are right on. I think with the dry year we have “been” having it might be and easier “drag” but if there is no water, then certain parts will be harder. I agree with finding the portage and then once you get there – very nice. Check out the Boundary Waters Journal site. Some of the trips I have done have been written about by my brother. Great magazine with lots of information. Also check bwca.com and hit the forum for other advice.

Get a tow across LaCoix and go up the Magline. Heard it is a great lake. For those interested in the park I would suggest looking at going in the Canadian side. You will get into the park quicker with fewer nasty portages.
