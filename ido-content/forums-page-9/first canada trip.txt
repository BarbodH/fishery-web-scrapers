You can catch walleye and smallys just about anywhere. My bang for the buck comes from a big green meanie covered in slime attacking my lure and maxing out my gear with power runs in 2′ of water. Go for the BIGPIKE  If you get  bored doing that you can always go play with those other two sub species
