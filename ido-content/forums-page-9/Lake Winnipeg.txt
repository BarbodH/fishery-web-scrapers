anyone coming to fish Lake Winnipeg please be careful, there was two trucks thru the ice yesterday in different areas, but popular spots. The wind has created a number of cracks and ridges. Hopefully the cold weather we are currently getting will help. There was another truck thru at Balsam Bay two weeks ago, and a number of vehicles that broke thru but were able to be pulled out by other vehicles over the past couple of weeks.

Damn! Canada is thawing out!
