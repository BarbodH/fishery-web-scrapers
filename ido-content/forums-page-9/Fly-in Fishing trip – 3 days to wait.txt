Sunday morning I leave for my annual fly-in Walleye trip to Vermilion Bay Ontario for 1 week. I have my B Fish N tackle Moxies, Draggin jigs, Precision H20 Jigs, JollyRoger Tackle spinner rigs, Rapala’s and various other tackle all packed and ready. Now I just need to get my clothes and food all organized and packed and I’ll be all set.

Best of luck!Its worth it just for the ride in the old Beaver. 



Float plane…?  

Whittsend,

Looks like it will be a blast. Fishing is on fire right now and the weather is perfect! Don’t forget your Outdoor Card!
