Sunday morning I leave for my annual fly-in Walleye trip to Vermilion Bay Ontario for 1 week. I have my B Fish N tackle Moxies, Draggin jigs, Precision H20 Jigs, JollyRoger Tackle spinner rigs, Rapala’s and various other tackle all packed and ready. Now I just need to get my clothes and food all organized and packed and I’ll be all set. The count down begins! Here are some photos of last years trip. Hopefully we will tie into some nice ones again

 Looks more like an Otter to me….  (I could be wrong, though)…  BTW, where was that plane / fly-out location? Looks familiar….. Best of luck, fish safe…

Whittsend, The outfitter is Wilderness Air Adventures out of Vermilion Bay. Bob and Kelsey run a top notch business. We have always had a great time with them.
