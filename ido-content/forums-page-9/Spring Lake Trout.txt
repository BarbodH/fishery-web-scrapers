Looking for suggestions on where to locate lake trout in shield lakes around the first week of June. Seems by then they are not in their early ice-out mode of cruising shorelines. We fish Clearwater West Lake near Atikokan which is deeper than heck, large cisco/smelt forage. Any suggestions on presentation also?

We slow troll frenzy flicker shads over deep water, water temps are still pretty cold relatively speaking in Quetico. We hammer them pretty good.

Welcome to the sight by the way 

Here’s one from last year, trout colored worked well last year, the year before gold / brown was the magic color so bring a few options


What size worked best?

It all depends on surface temps! If you have colder temps 50 degree or cooler you can still get them casting shorlines with spoons or stick baits! or troll over deep water but keeping your presentation in the top few feet of the water colume. if the temps get above 55 degree you will want to start and target them a bit deeper with jigs or troll with dipsy divers! 

We long line troll the 9′-11′ Flickers so i figure they are working in the 15′ range. Lakers will move 50′ or more up the water column if they see something they like. Alot of times we see the lake “boiling” on a bug hatch this time of year. Get your gear and fish when you see this action
