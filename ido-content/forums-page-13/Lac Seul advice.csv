1218322,benjisdad,2008-04-26 02:08:00,39,I have been going up to Mahkwa Lodge for the past 8 years or so. We always went fishing in Vaughn lake when we went up there. This year Vaughn won’t be open when we are going to be up there (early june). Where would someone go to catch some nice walleyes. I’m thinking Bray would be worth a shot but does anyone else have any spots they would suggest to hit up.thanks
