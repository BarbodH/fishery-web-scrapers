We just got back from our annual family trip to Sturgeon Lake in Ontario. The weather was very unstable , lots of rain during the week.. They have had lots of rain up there . so the lake is up about 3 ft. The bugs were the worst ever. The fishing was the best I have ever had there. Lots of big fish. 100s of Walleyes and the Lake Trout were very easy to catch. One day I had my 2 fish limit in 3 jigs in less than 5 minutes. Big fish award went to the wife with a 45 inch — 25 lb Northern. —– 51 more weeks and I will be there again !!
