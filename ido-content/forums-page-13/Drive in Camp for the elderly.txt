Everyone was so hopefull with my recent request for information concerning Lac Seul Outposts. There has been a change of plans. My parents have asked me and my wife to take them on a fishing trip. They are pretty frail, but capable. I need to be able to take my boat so the four of can fish together and I can assist helping them. The problem is my mother has become rather picky over the years. She used to take me as a kid all over Canada so I owe her a good trip. I would imagine her requirements are:Not alot people to contend withSomewhat of a clean cabin (we’ll do the cooking)No mechanical portages, etc (mobility reasons)Good fishing for walleyesAffordable I have been thinking of: Remote areas of Lac Suel,Remote areas of Lake of the Woods, Lake St. Joseph (?) Perhaps I should stick to the Lac Suel idea? I have never been to any of these areas, so I have no idea if the a cabin will be 50′ off a logging highway(long story) or in no man’s land (preferred). Any suggestions of a place would be great apprciated. PM me if necessary. Thank you for any assistance.
