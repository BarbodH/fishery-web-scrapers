Everyone was so hopefull with my recent request for information concerning Lac Seul Outposts. There has been a change of plans. My parents have asked me and my wife to take them on a fishing trip. They are pretty frail, but capable. I need to be able to take my boat so the four of can fish together and I can assist helping them.
