The fish werenâ€™t in the normal locations for the this time of year on the big lakes, but we found them near the mouths of feeder creeks and falls. Here are some pics. of the average size eyes we caught along with our biggest eye at 27 1/4, a couple of smallies and a 13 lb pike. Majority of fish were caught on leeches. Gulp alive did well if you were pitching but the fish were always a few inchers smaller compared to if you were using live bait. In-line spinners and buzz baits took the smallies and pike."
