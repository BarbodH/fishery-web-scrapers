A buddy of mine wants to go to Bluffy Lake in NW Ontario/sunset country. He was there as a kid and wants to go back. I’ve learned not to trust memories when selecting a place to go for a fishing trip. So, any comments on this lake’s fishing and the outfitters who serve this lake would be most appreciated.
