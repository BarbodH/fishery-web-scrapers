Is anyone familiar with Lac Seul Outposts? I picked up their brochure at the sports show and am a bit interested. We typicaly fly out of Red Lake and I have never been to Lac Suel. Can someone tell me if the Chamberlain Narrows are congested with other resorts, or is this area as remote as it appears? There is a large savings if you bring your own boat and they will guide you to and from the lodge. Would this be worth the savings or am I risking a new lower unit? Thanks for any advice.
