148124,Spiel,2008-01-05 10:16:00,9059,"January 04, 2008  GRCA issues flood safety bulletin grandriver.ca  With warm weather forecast over the weekend and continuing into next week, the Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA) has issued a Flood Safety Bulletin to watershed municipal flood coordinators.  Depending on the exact weather conditions received, the warm temperatures will begin to melt the snow pack, and cause river and stream levels to rise in response.  This could create typical January thaw conditions, which if combined with forecast rainfall, may lead to local flooding conditions.  At present, there is more snowpack in the northern portion of the Grand River watershed north of Guelph and Kitchener, than in the southern areas.  The GRCAâ€™s main reservoirs have 70 to 90 per cent of their flood storage capacity available to handle increased runoff. However, there could be flooding situations on smaller streams, in urban areas, and along the Nith River where there are no reservoirs.  There is also a potential for ice jamming due to the ice cover that exists along the southern reaches of the Grand River below Brantford, and these situations will be monitored.  Depending on the actual temperatures and rainfall received, GRCA will be monitoring the situation over the weekend, and issuing further updates or formal Flood Messages as they are warranted.  Parents are reminded that with kids still off school, the warmer temperatures may attract kids and pets to the river. Ice conditions on the river are definitely unstable, and river banks are icy and slippery, so the river should only be viewed from safe vantage points such as bridges and overlooks.
