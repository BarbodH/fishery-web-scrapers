After all, a goal stated in Polution Probe's position paper is ""self-sustaining"" species......  The forums do not appear to be located in cities where salmon enthusiasts and the attendent industry is located to easily go and voice their position.  Charter boat ass'ns and angling groups may want to have reps there with position papers of their own."
