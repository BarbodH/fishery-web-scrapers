Flows will be elevated throughout the Grand River system for two to three days as water from rain and melting snow works its way through the system.  Banks adjacent to rivers and creeks are very slippery at this time and when combined with cold, fast-moving water pose a serious hazard. Parents are encouraged to keep their children and pets away from watercourses and off frozen water bodies at this time.  GRCA staff will continue to monitor watershed conditions and will issue updates as required. For more information on river flows, see the River Data section of the GRCA web site.
