Earlier this month, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) announced the completion of a engineering plan for replacement of the existing bridge and dam, both of which are getting rather long in the tooth. The two structures, which are situated one over top of the other, date way back to 1928, putting them well beyond retirement age.  ""The undercarriage has deteriorated to the point where it can't be fixed,"" said Central Manitoulin Reeve Richard Stephens, adding that the one-lane nature of the vehicular span is behind the times, given the traffic that occurs on this highway.  While there's never, in Reeve Stephens' memory, been an accident at the site, ""there is a bit of a bottleneck there, and we've been promoting for a number of years that the bridge be widened.""  Doug Dixon, whose engineering firm completed the design study on behalf of the MTO, assured that the new bridge will ""be upgraded to meet or exceed the current standards for a road of that speed and volume,"" including the addition of a lane for two-way traffic.  It will also be resituated slightly to the south, allowing for the continued use of the existing span while work on its replacement proceeds. ""There will be no roadway closures,"" promised Sergiy Morozevych, project manager with the MTO.  That's a relief to the municipality, which didn't relish the increased traffic (and upkeep) on back roads should a detour have been required, said Reeve Stephens. And of course it is welcome news to residents and visitors of the area who might have experienced an inconvenience.  Once the new bridge is completed-likely in 2010, as the job won't commence until 2009-work will begin on the replacement dam, slated for the same spot as the current one. ""Construction is planned for two years,"" said Mr. Morozevych. ""In the first year the permanent bridge will be constructed south of the existing dam and bridge, and in the second year the dam will be replaced.""  By separating the two structures, the MTO anticipates a greater ease of maintenance, as well as considerable improvements in the functioning of the dam. ""Due to refinements made in the structure's design, the operation of the dam will help improve the water levels in both Lake Mindemoya and the Mindemoya River,"" indicated Mr. Morozevych. ""The new system will enable operators to make fine adjustments to levels during critical life-cycle stages of resident and migratory fish species.""  An environmental assessment has been completed for the project, with input from the Ministry of Natural Resources, said Mr. Morozevych, and mitigation measures have been identified ""to address any potential impacts"" on the fishery, which includes both resident warm-water species and migratory salmonids.  Once the design study is approved, the MTO will issue a public tender for a contractor to perform the work.  At present, the ministry is still inviting public input on the proposed bridge and dam replacement project. Copies of the design report are available for review at the Central Manitoulin municipal office and the Mindemoya and Providence Bay public libraries."
