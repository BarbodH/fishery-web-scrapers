Alexandre Goloubev, 27, pleaded guilty to the charges and was fined $1,000 for unlawfully buying fish and $500 for making a false statement to a conservation officer.  Court heard that on October 5, 2007, Goloubev was checked by a conservation officer while angling just west of Blind River. Goloubev told the officer he only had salmon in his possession. After being questioned about a large pool of blood on shore, he admitted he had bought a sturgeon from an angler who caught it earlier in the day. The sturgeon was cut in pieces, placed in a cooler and hidden under vegetation in the forest near their campsite.  Justice of the Peace Philip Stanghetta heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Blind River, on December 4, 2007.
