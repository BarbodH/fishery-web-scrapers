Often recognized as the Ice Fishing Capital of North America, the 725-square-kilometres of a frozen Lake Simcoe can often mean as many as 4,000 huts during a good old-fashioned winter.  All ice hut operators, hotels, B & B’s, resorts, tackle shops, restaurants, gas stations and other businesses that rely on revenues generated from anglers, are counting on this winter to help them have a successful 2008.  If we have cold weather, good ice and the fish co-operate then the recipe will be there for all to benefit.  So, as a new ice fishing season is upon us, let’s have a look at what’s in store for anglers with some of the new fishing regulations and then we’ll make some predictions for the top four winter species.  For those of you who have already picked up a copy of the new 2008 recreational fishing regulations summary, you will have noticed several changes.  First off is a new approach that the ministry has developed to manage the fisheries across Ontario.  Part of this involves reducing the number of fishing areas to just 20 Fishery Management Zones (FMZ) for the province. In York Region we fall under FMZ 16, however we also have the Special Designated Waters of Lake Simcoe which means it may have several regulations separate from the rest of FMZ 16.  Highlights of New Fishing regs for Lake Simcoe Ice Anglers  -  Walleye catch and possession limits are reduced to four walleye for Sport Licence holders and two for those with a Conservation Licence. Only one walleye can exceed 46 centimetres (18.1 inches).  - Crappie now have a limit of 30 with a Sport Licence and 10 with a Conservation Licence.  -  Sunfish now have a limit of 50 with a Sport Licence and 25 with a Conservation Licence.  -  Lake trout, whitefish and yellow perch limits and seasons will be the same as 2007. The only exception is that anglers holding a Conservation Licence can now keep one whitefish instead of two.  -  Winter walleye season remains closed on March 15.  -  Personal possession of baitfish – whether purchased from a baitfish dealer or caught by a licensed angler cannot exceed 120. No longer will anglers be able to obtain a receipt if they wish to retain more than 120.  - The 2008-2009 Fishing Summary is now available from local bait and tackle shops, Canadian Tire, Service Ontario/Government Information Centers and on the ministry’s website at ontario.ca/fishing  Now For the Fishing Prognostications  Yellow Perch: The most popular species in the lake seem to be targeted more and more every winter on Lake Simcoe. I am not sure if this because there’s an increase in the number of anglers who are discovering the joys of winter perch fishing, or if it is more that unstable ice conditions way out on the whitefish and lake trout grounds means the pressure has been diverted from those fish to perch. Ice is ready earlier close to shore and in the shallower somewhat protected areas of the lake. Limited ice fishing for perch has already been occurring for several weeks in December.  The issue this winter will not be so much a matter of anglers catching enough perch … but whether they will find the big Jumbo’s that the lake is famous for. I’m thinking we will see more big perch caught this year than last but we’ll still hear plenty of reports of anglers having to catch several perch before they find a few ‘big enough’ in that 8-11 inch category for a meal. Hopefully there will be more anglers that release those precious perch over 12 inches to perpetuate a trophy perch fishery on the lake.  Northern Pike: It seems there are fewer people fishing for pike in the winter then there were a couple of decades ago, but that sure isn’t because there are fewer pike out there. Perhaps they are more difficult to catch in the gin clear waters now that we have to deal with the filtering effects of zebra mussels. However they are still a very cacheable and fun fish to target under the ice. Perhaps with the Lake Simcoe Ice Fishing Contest incentive of $100,000 for a pike over 13.39 lbs, more people will focus on these toothy critters this year. I think pike fishing will be good for those fishing the right areas, with the right baits and tackle this winter, but you’ll have to stay tuned to a future column if you need more detailed advice.  Lake Trout: Anglers have been saying that it appears to be more difficult to find these prized fish during the last couple of winters but it’s hard to say if this is due primarily because of later and shorter seasons or less fish. If it’s a good winter and we can get out relatively early in January, then I think those who are willing to work hard searching for lakers will be rewarded. Still, we might hear more reports that the next species listed below dominates the deepwater haunts.  Whitefish: If the banner open water whitefish season of 2007 was any indication, then the winter of 2008 should be just excellent for whitefish. The caveat of course is that we need good ice and good travel conditions to where these fish reside out on Lake Simcoe.  During the winter of 2008 ice anglers have to be mindful not only to stay on top of their game, but also on top of the ice. Call local ice hut operators for the latest conditions close to where you want to access the lake, carry ice picks, test the ice frequently and if in doubt stay off. In a future Focus on Fishing column, we will devote an entire article to ice safety. Until then I’d like to wish all of you happy and safe 2008 with more days on the hard and soft water than ever before.
