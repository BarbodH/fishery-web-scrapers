The warning comes days after the Ministry of Natural Resources issued an advisory calling on anglers to stay safe on the ice during the winter fishing season which opened Tuesday.  ""The key to enjoying this popular winter activity is to play it safe,"" Natural Resources Minister Donna Cansfield said in a release.  ""If you are not sure about ice conditions, do not go out on the ice.""  Reports from around Lake Nipissing indicate ice thickness ranges between 20 centimetres and 35 cm, with the most favourable conditions found in Callander Bay and the South Shore. Several ice hut operators in those areas of the lake are already open for business, while some others who operate near the Manitou Islands have yet to set up for the season.  At least 20 cm of clear blue ice is required for snowmobiles and 30 cm or more is needed for most light vehicles. Double that amount is required if ice is white or opaque. Heavy snow on a frozen lake or river can insulate the ice below and slow down the freezing process.  The ministry advises anglers to notify others where they plan to fish and when they plan to return.  Anglers are also advised to wear and use appropriate clothing and equipment.  The ministry says anglers should be aware that ice does not freeze at a uniform thickness across most lakes and rivers and that thickness should be checked regularly with a spud bar or auger.  The ministry also warns that ice formed over flowing water, springs, pressure cracks, old ice holes or around the mouths of rivers and streams can be weaker than surrounding ice."
