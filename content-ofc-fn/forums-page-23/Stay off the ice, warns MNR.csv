In a release issued Thursday, the ministry said warmer weather and forecasted rain will lead to heavy water flow in the Sudbury area.  ""As a result, the ministry may need to lower the water level on Lake Panache as of Monday,"" the release stated. ""This would affect ice conditions on several lakes throughout the Lake Panache system, including Walker, Lang and Frood lakes.""  Depending on conditions, similar control measures may be required in other lake systems throughout the watershed.  Many of the smaller lakes throughout the district are reported to have less than six inches of good ice, while larger lakes are still open in areas where currents flow.  ""Until temperatures return to seasonal values, deteriorating ice conditions will be found on all lakes throughout the Sudbury District,"" the ministry said."
