By Miner and News Staff Friday January 11, 2008 Kenora Daily Miner   There will be new faces at the top for the 2008 edition of the summer’s biggest fishing tournament.  Tracy Laffin of Tunnel Island Management will chair the Kenora Bass International this year -- taking over from Sue Loewen, who chaired the tournament of the last two years -- with Ernie Friesen, who is employed as the sporting goods department manager for Canadian Tire in Kenora, as her vice-chairman. The board of directors of KBI had advertised the need for new leadership in order to continue holding KBI.  “The intent of the Kenora Bass International is to attract anglers, their families, tourists and people of our own great community to the event. We know from previous economic surveys that KBI has a 1.5 million-dollar impact on our local economy each year, which is why it was extremely important to our previous board of directors to ensure the future success of the event,” said director of finance Vanessa Nowe in a release.  Laffin’s work with Tunnel Island Management Company which provides marketing services for local Kenora businesses such as Super 8 Motel, Casey’s Grill Bar and the MS Kenora, is expected to bring a wealth of experience and knowledge on marketing KBI as the premiere bass fishing tournament of Northwestern Ontario.  Nowe said the board was also pleased other community members stepped forward into other roles on the board of directors. Angler services will be handled by Duncan McEwen of Sunset Strip Husky, while Lori Beaucage of DST consulting will help look after sponsorships. In total, 13 members will serve on the board, including nine who decided to return this year. The re-invigorated board is excited about 2008 being the best tournament yet and has announced Shaw Cable has committed to returning to broadcasting the final weigh-in as a live event.  The announcement follows their meeting Wednesday, where they focused on gathering their team for the competition, scheduled for Aug. 7-9. The event will continue at the Harbourfront. The board noted in its release the city has updated it on the impact of the downtown revitalization project.  “They have acknowledged the economic benefit that the tournament provides to our city and have made the necessary concessions to ensure that we are able to host the event in a suitable format for both the anglers and spectators. Despite the increased traffic on Bernier Drive they have indicated that they will do everything possible to ensure that we are able to host the Top Ten Angler Boat Parade which they acknowledge as the pinnacle point of the event,” stated Nowe."
