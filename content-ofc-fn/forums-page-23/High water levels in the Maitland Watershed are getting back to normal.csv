On Jan. 3, the MVCA conducted a routine snow survey, which averaged 35-40 centimetres of snow in the watershed with an inch and a half of water content. “Then we got into the rain and high temperatures,” Grummett said. “That has depleted the snow pack.” More than 45 millimetres of rain have fallen, in addition to the water from the melting snow-pack, making the low-lying areas of the watershed a dangerous place to be while the water runs high. However, Grummett said the water hit its high point last week and things should be settling down soon.  “The last of the rivers and headwaters peaked at Thursday at 8 in the morning,” he said. “Those water levels have been receding.” While the highest water levels have been recorded in North Huron, people should still practice caution, especially around low-lying areas in the watershed, where flooding was most likely to take place. However, there are some positive aspects to the warmer temperatures. One of the benefits of the thaw, Grummett said, was that much of the moisture was able to seep into the ground instead of running directly off into the river. This helps counter the effects left by a hot, dry summer. “We came into the fall with very dry ground conditions, Grummett said. “I think a lot of moisture has gone into the ground. We are now looking at saturated soil conditions. “It’s a good way of replenishing.” With the mercury poised to drop once again, winter is easing back into itself, though not with a devastating deep-freeze. In the meantime, water levels are receding in the watershed, accommodating the influx caused by the rain and the melting snow. “There won’t be any potential for additional flooding, but we have to pass through what we have in the system,” Grummett said. “I think we’re getting back into winter mode. The flood threat is definitely diminished.” Temperatures hovered around zero all this week, but are expected to start sinking Friday, according to weathernetwork.ca. By Sunday, it’s expected to be -10 C with light snow expected. In the meantime, Grummett and the MVCA will continue to monitor the watershed and advise the public to avoid watercourses."
