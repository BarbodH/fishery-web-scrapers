Needless to say - I love it! I hope that it is acceptable to share this here.   	I have just been voted in as State Chair for Ontario for the Carp Anglers Group (carpanglersgroup.com), and have a huge to-do list.   	Right off the bat, I was asked to create a Facebook Group page. This group page is set up and will include -  	Carp Anglers Group - Ontario Agenda. 	In no particular order: 	CAG member (and guests) Fish-In (2-3 a year). 	Promote CAG and its membership. 	Junior Fish-In and teaching days. 	Local meet ups. 	Meetings/contact with local press to promote carp fishing. 	Maintain contact with MNRF regarding multi line (2 rod) fishing for carp. 	Various prize giveaways. Please come an give us a visit: CAG - Ontario Group page Again, I completely understand that carp fishing and carp in general is not everyone's cup of tea.   		Thank you for reading this far! All the best, and tight lines."
