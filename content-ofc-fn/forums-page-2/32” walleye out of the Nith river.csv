When I finally landed it I was surprised that it was walleye and not just a walleye but the biggest I have ever seen. I got a measurement and it went 32” this is by far the biggest walleye I have ever caught. I caught it in 5-6 feet of water on a narrow stretch of the nith river. I have pictures but I’m reluctant to post them since I will admit the handling was not the best, but the fish was released safely. Has anyone had similar experiences or was this just a fluke?"
