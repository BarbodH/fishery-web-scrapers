1075107,riverwader,2021-07-25 13:57:00,10," Could use some advice.  My son and I have a chance to do a fly-in with Ivanhoe next week.  I've done numerous fly-ins but never with this outfitter.  Reviews are very good.  We have option to go to Pebonishewi Lake, or Bonar, Lincoln,  Shawmere, Lemoine, or Beattie.  Looking at Pebonishewi because it has bass, walleye and pike.  Others only walleye and pike.  If anyone has fished with Air Ivanhoe and can point us to a good lake from this group we'd really appreciate it. Thanks"
