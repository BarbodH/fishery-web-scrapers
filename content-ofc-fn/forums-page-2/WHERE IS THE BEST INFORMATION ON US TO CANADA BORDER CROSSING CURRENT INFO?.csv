1072389,hsfan50plus,2021-04-21 15:26:00,5,Sadly another site doesn't even allow these questions anymore than have gone CNN/MSNBC on a fishing? site.
1072394,Fisherman,2021-04-21 16:18:00,7201,Well it definitely won't be on a fishing website.
1072396,irishfield,2021-04-21 16:46:00,26272,Month long closure was just renewed yesterday to May 21st. Expect that every month until year end...

1072410,BassMan11,2021-04-21 19:10:00,583,To be fair.... this might be someone from down south looking to book a stay at one of our excellent lodges in Ontario. Sadly though I would say 2021 fishing season in Ontario probably won't be open to US anglers.... or even potentially ones from Ontario.....
1072412,hsfan50plus,2021-04-21 19:13:00,5,"Thanks Bassman, I ignored that reply, You would expect a fishing in Ontario site to have info as to whether you can come to fish there????"
1072413,Fisherman,2021-04-21 19:36:00,7201,"Seriously, the border is closed.  Can't be anymore basic than that."
1072427,Old Ironmaker,2021-04-22 01:12:00,8243,"The border crossings are closed to individuals crossing by vehicle or foot. You can fly in, boat in and I'm not sure about crossing in a commercial bus carrying people. So to say it's ""closed"" is not accurate.  Welcome to OFC hsfan50plus."
1072428,grimsbylander,2021-04-22 01:52:00,3016,"Fisherman isn't all that wrong here. If I was thinking of going to the US fishing again this spring (Chautauqua), I would not be relying on a US side fishing forum to tell me what to expect as a Canadian crossing the border. How the heck would they know?? Check out Canada Border Services Agency(CBSA) Here's the link...  CSBA The border wait times at the Queenston Lewiston bridge are between 10 minutes and 5 months LOL"
