1074003,misfish,2021-06-13 15:35:00,29116,Still love that tune. Oh and I am still waiting to get my first electric blade .
1074004,glen,2021-06-13 16:31:00,2637,So you can cut a fish though the guts and no mess eh.
1074005,glen,2021-06-13 16:32:00,2637,You donâ€™t need to make the first cut in the belly.
1074006,dave524,2021-06-13 16:35:00,4507,You donâ€™t need to make the first cut in the belly. I think it removes the rib cage as well so the fillets are boneless
1074027,mamona,2021-06-14 14:12:00,597,Nicely done aactually
1074050,floater,2021-06-15 12:12:00,220,Gonna try that with a 25 lb salmon. Looks good
1074057,misfish,2021-06-15 20:13:00,29116,"Gonna try that with a 25 lb salmon. Looks good Yup. It,s all going to go in the smoker anyways. Really though,how much meat do you really get offÂ  the ribs ? Shrinks away when you cook it ."
1074077,akaShag,2021-06-16 15:12:00,2070,"Gonna try that with a 25 lb salmon. Looks good Looks like a LOT of meat is lost.............. I bought a Rapala electric filleting knife, not enough power to clean even a small fish.Â  Then I tried an electric carving knife, but kept cutting through the backbone and screwing up the fillets.  So............. I have filleted many thousands of fish in my life, with good sharp filleting knives, and I am not going to change.Â  And YES I am a cantankerous old fart.Â  ðŸ˜‰ Doug"
