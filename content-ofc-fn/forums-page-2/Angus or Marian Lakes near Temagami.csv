1078008,tvine,2022-01-10 20:46:00,6,Hello all.  First post after reading the forum for a year or so.  Great info on the site and I am wondering if anyone can share thoughts about fishing at Angus Lake or Marian Lake up past North Bay. Looking to get some Spring fishing in this year. Thanks

The camp had boats on other lakes and all we had to do was carry our gear and a small motor & gas and we did well on those lakes. Sorry but I don't recall the name of the camp but it was just down hwy 11 from a tackle shop. Sorry, but that's about all I can offer."
