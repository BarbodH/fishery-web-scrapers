1068201,Old Ironmaker,2020-12-07 19:42:00,8243,"$10,000 sounds like a good hit to the pocket book of offenders, however 3 offenders and multiple offences. If the Justices would add a zero to many of the fines these so called outdoorsmen might think twice about shooting a calf across a road thinking it was a cow and letting it rot. I can't believe one of these guys will not have his Hunting Permit revolked if he takes a hunting course. How about a suspension of more than 1 year plus take every course hunting related there is.  Three southern Ontario men being fined a total of $10,000 for hunting violations. â€“ Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources News Roundup (mnrwatch.com)"
