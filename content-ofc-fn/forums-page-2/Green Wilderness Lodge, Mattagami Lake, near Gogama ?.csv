I have a deposit with them from last year and want to book a week for 2022. They do not return phone call or respond to emails, wondering if they are still in business? Any information is truly welcomed, if they are out of business I need to book elsewhere and the time is getting short. I would prefer to book in the Gagoma or Cochrane area."
1079935,matstefi,2022-04-26 17:09:00,3,My wife just contacted them via Facebook and they answered almost immediately. My dad and I are booked in this year and I tried to verify our booking via email and tried calling as well. Maybe you can try via Facebook as well to reach them. I was concerned about our upcoming trip when I saw your post. I also got no response when I tried calling and emailing. Hope this helps.

I was a bit surprised myself at the fact I couldn’t reach anyone via email or phone, but definitely relieved to hear confirmation of our booking. Dad is almost 80 and I’ve been wanting to take him on a fishing trip for some time. We’ll keep everyone posted."
