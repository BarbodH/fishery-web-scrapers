I am new to fishing as well :) I went to few places in May 2020 (after googling) including Lake Aquitaine, Streetsville Park, Humber Marsh etc but was not able to even get a bite. It could be that I used wrong bait (I tried spinners, spoons and poppers) or this is a wrong time to fish in these locations. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."

1077862,Antman,2021-12-29 16:40:00,7,You can go to the middle of Algonquin and still not get a bite . And see pic for the fish i have caught

If you are looking for City fishing from your location you may want to check out Bronte Creek or the Credit River. Be sure to check fishing regulations for these. If you are willing to travel a couple of hours check out the Kawartha’s, the lakes there are great, start with lake Scugog, then work your way to Pigeon Buckhorn and Rice. Not only are these lashes good for Walleyes and bass but also battling it out with monster muskies. Good luck."
