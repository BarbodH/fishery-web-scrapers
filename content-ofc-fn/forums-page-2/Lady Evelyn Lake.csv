1075103,Mat Boissonneault,2021-07-25 13:21:00,1,Has anyone been up to Lady Evelyn lake lately? Heading there in about a week and wondering on the fishing. I'm thinking of targeting the west (deeper) end of the lake considering the time of year. Thanks

I’m sure all the hot spots then, now have different names. There was the ‘mailbox’. Burnt stump. Cooks. Spike island. Deadman’s point. To name a few within 10 minutes of the island.  	it all depends on the weather. Don’t bother with a north wind. East is least. West is best.  	Some day I may go back"
