1079062,tvine,2022-03-09 16:37:00,6,Hello all. Looking forward to getting out in my kayak this season for some fishing. Relatively recent purchase and I tend to go out in the warm weather and summer months.  Have the urge and need to go in the Spring this year. Someone at my work told me you shouldn’t go in a kayak without a wet/dry suit unless the water is over 60 degrees.  Is there a specific temperature people use for safety in the event one capsizes? If it is 60 degrees when would lakes like Pigeon or Buckhorn hit that temperature? Thanks in advance.
