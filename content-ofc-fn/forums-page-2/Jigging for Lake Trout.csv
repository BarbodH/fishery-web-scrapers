I've heard many people say Ontario is a great place for Lake Trout fishing. So, my question is; what types of jigging lures do you guys use there? I have a YouTube Channel called ""Fougere Family Adventures"" and a Facebook group called ""Lake Trout Fishing BC."" My focus is to learn as much as I can and to also help others learn as well. Here's a link to a compilation video of some of the lake trout we caught this year. https://youtu.be/brMXA6_Gty8"
