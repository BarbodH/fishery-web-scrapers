Musky were feisty and hungry, still to be found in 3’ - 6’ FOW in the remaining/ remnants of the cabbage and coontail weeds. Only had one session with no musky follows or netted, but picked up some decent pike that afternoon as a consolation prize for breaking my right arm casting…. Lol. Still throwing bucktails. Walleye are still around on the humps, as too are the crappie and bass, just haven’t spent much time fishing them while bigger toothy critters want to play.  "
