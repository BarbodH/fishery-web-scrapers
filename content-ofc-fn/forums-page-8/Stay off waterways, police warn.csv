Portions of Lake Simcoe have begun to freeze, but there are still many areas of open water.  At this time, it is not a good idea to try ice fishing or snowmobiling because ice conditions are too unstable.  If you are doing any recreational activities near water, remember:  • Stay off the ice;  • Wear the appropriate clothing and ensure you wear a certified flotation device;  • Tell someone about your plans and specifically where you are going;  • Carry a cellular phone with you at all times;  • Be cautious of your footing around banks of rivers and streams and;  • Be aware of weather reports and the state of the ice."
