The move recognizes the significant economic threat these fish pose to the province's fisheries.  A legal brief from the Province has been filed with the United States Supreme Court supporting Michigan's motion for a preliminary injunction to close the locks in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The closure is one of a number of measures sought by Michigan to keep this invasive species from passing into Lake Michigan.  The commercial fishery in the Great Lakes is valued at about $200 million annually.  The U.S. Supreme Court will determine Ontario's participation in the proceedings.   QUOTES  “Invasive species don't respect international borders. The potential impact of Asian carp on Ontario's economy and ecosystems is a serious concern. We stand with our American colleagues in supporting all steps necessary to prevent their entry into the Great Lakes.”  - Donna Cansfield, Minister of Natural Resources   QUICK FACTS   LEARN MORE      For More Information  Stefanie Millon, Minister's Office, 416-314-2212  Media Desk, Communications Services Branch, 416-314-2106  ontario.ca/natural-resources-news  General EnquiriesNatural Resources Information Centre  1-800-667-1940 TTY 1-866-686-6072 (Hearing Impaired)"
