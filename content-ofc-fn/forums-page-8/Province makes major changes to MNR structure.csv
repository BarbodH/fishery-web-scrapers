423954,TJQ,2010-01-19 21:15:00,7805,"<h3 align=""center"">Province makes major changes to MNR structure O.F.A.H. will monitor the business of fish and wildlife delivery under new model</h3> The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.) is reserving judgment on the sweeping organizational changes unveiled by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) last weekâ€“at least for now.  The unprecedented realignment will see some new divisions created and others dismantled, a move that will impact the delivery of fish and wildlife policy and programming.  The Natural Resources Management Division, that housed the Fish and Wildlife Branch has been eliminated under the new organizational chart, which now divides fish and wildlife responsibilities between two new divisions, Policy (Biodiversity Branch) and Provincial Services (Fish and Wildlife Services Branch). Given the successful track record of O.F.A.H./MNR partnerships in such biodiversity-driven initiatives as the Invading Species Awareness Program and Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program, the move may spark new opportunities to work toward a common purpose.  ""It is regrettable that the one branch anglers and hunters most identified with has been splintered. Obviously, we are concerned about the marginalization of fish and wildlife, and by extension, fishing and hunting, through the division of the fish and wildlife program,"" said O.F.A.H. Executive Director, Mike Reader. ""That said, consolidating policy into one division should increase communication across the board, and that could be a positive change.  ""We are prepared, at least in the short term, to reserve judgment as the Ministry works to transition this new business model into actual delivery. As always, we are willing to work with the Ministry to support fish and wildlife conservation, and to ensure that outdoors enthusiasts, and anglers and hunters in particular, are not forgotten in this process.""  Quick Facts:     With over 100,000 members, subscribers and supporters, and 660 member clubs, the O.F.A.H. is the largest nonprofit, charitable, fishing, hunting and conservation-based organization in Ontario, and the voice of anglers and hunters.
