419967,Spiel,2010-01-08 10:30:00,9059,"Lower lake trout limits,sanctuary month for perch characterize new fish regs   January 6, 2010 Jim Moodie / http://www.manitoulin.ca   MANITOULIN-Effective this winter, ice fishers on Lake Manitou with a sport-fish licence will only be able to keep two lake trout per day instead of three, while those accustomed to still-fishing for perch in the spring will have to keep their lines out of the water during the April-late May spawning period.  The changes are part of a broader update to fisheries policy in Zone 10, an area extending from Wawa to Elk Lake in the north, and south as far as Manitoulin and the French River. Since the Island habitat is notably different from the rest of the zone, however, it has been recognized (along with the French River) as ""specially designated waters,"" within which some exceptions apply.  In this case, Manitoulin will be spared a size restriction for lake trout applied elsewhere in the zone, where anglers will only be able to keep one fish (of the two allowed per day) that's over 40 centimetres. Also, the Island season for lake trout will last a few weeks longer in the fall, as the closing date for the rest of Zone 10 is now Labour Day. As usual, the Island season will go from January 1 to September 30.  Lake trout are the second most frequent sport fish in Zone 10, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), but a recent five-year study ""found that lake trout populations are in poor health overall.""  The report, titled Status of Lake Trout Populations in Northeastern Ontario, determined that only 32 percent of lake trout lakes had a high abundance of the species, and of these, only 17 percent were fished at a sustainable level. The report further found that about half of the female lake trout were mature by the age of seven (and a length of 40 centimetres), and that ones older than 10 were scarce, likely due to being more vulnerable to summer angling, as egg production consumes much of their energy at that time.  Trout inhabiting Lake Manitou have been relatively plentiful and fast-growing, however, with the result that size limits have been waived for this area. As MNR biologist Wayne Selinger explained earlier this year, the big inland lake ""is 10,000 acres and far more productive"" than other lakes in the zone, in part due to its warmer temperatures and limestone base, which result in ""higher growing degree days.""  Likening Manitou to ""a lake trout factory,"" Mr. Selinger noted that the species matures more quickly than in the colder, granite-rimmed lakes that dominate Zone 10. Whereas the native salmonid, in most other areas, reaches 40 centimetres by age seven, on Manitou ""they're only two or three years old when they reach 40 centimetres, and are mature by age four.""  The other factor speeding growth is the level of dissolved solids (a key factor of productivity), and Lake Manitou has ""over double the amount of the next best lake in the zone,"" pointed out the biologist.  Given these conditions, Mr. Selinger made the case that ""Lake Manitou deserves special consideration,"" as is now reflected in the regulatory changes.  An exception has also been made for Manitoulin in regard to the perch fishery, although in this instance our area is the only one to implement a closed season for the species. Everywhere else in the zone, anglers can fish for perch year-round.  Perch is a popular target of Island anglers, but ""recent information suggests that exploitation is threatening the sustainability of the yellow perch fisheries on Manitoulin Island,"" reads a statement from the MNR. Closing the season between April 1 and the third Friday in May ""should reduce the harvest of larger spawning-size yellow perch and allow this component of the fishery to rebuild.""  The move is likely to be embraced locally, at least among those representing fishing interests, as the United Fish and Game Clubs of Manitoulin (UFGCM) has been advocating for this change for several years."
