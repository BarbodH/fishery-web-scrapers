408132,Spiel,2009-12-03 16:39:00,9065,"Muddy Mudcat unveiled at last   Novenber 18, 2009 MIKE SHEELER / www.dunnvillechronicle.com   Muddy the Mudcat has finally been revealed to the world.  Approximately 450 people turned out to see Muddy in all her glory on highway three just west of Dunnville.  The flow of spectators grew to the point where OPP were called to the scene to help direct foot and vehicle traffic.  Dave Welsh, an integral Mudcat Committee member who helped Muddy be possible, said a few words to the crowd.  ""This has been a long time coming. The idea came three and a half years ago.""  ""This is a wonderful way to attract tourism, and Dunnville needs tourism."" added Welsh.  The original design for Muddy was to have the site built in the downtown core, but that plan had to be changed.  According to Welsh Muddy will now bring people to the area and Dunnville's refurbished downtown will do the rest to attract people and business to the area.  The choice to use a Mudcat for representation was an easy one for Dunnville due to its rich history through Mudcat sports teams, the Mudcat festival and the Grand River filled with catfish.  The selection seemed only natural for some.  There were numerous sponsors and volunteer groups that aided in concept, construction and announcement of Muddy but none was more instrumental, according to Welsh, than the Kinsmen Club who offered their facilities to hold the Mudcat Committee meetings.  Aidan Long, the young boy who named the giant Mudcat, was present at the unveiling and was called before the crowd for a round of applause by Welsh.  ""What a fabulous turnout,"" said Don Edwards, speaking on behalf of MP Diane Finley, who couldn't attend.  Haldimand Mayor Marie Trainer expressed her thanks and congratulations in front of the large crowd.  ""I want to be the first to thank the committee, the ones that had the vision to make this possible,"" she said.  ""They went out and helped raise money, thank you all,"" she finished.  Mike Wakin, creator of Muddy spoke to the crowd next.  ""We did this to bring people to this community,"" he said.  ""Niagara, Grimsby, Hamilton. They don't have anything like this but Dunnville does,"" added a visibly emotional Wakin.  ""We have an area that is an hour drive from a million people.""  The hope is now that they will all come to see the great Muddy the Mudcat on the edge of the Grand River."
