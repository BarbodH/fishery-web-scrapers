The DNR Division of Law Enforcement reminds those who enjoy such activities that there is no such thing as safe ice, only safer ice.  “It is a cold and painful lesson that Mother Nature teaches us” said Col. Michael Crider, head of the DNR’s Law Enforcement Division. “Ice fishermen aren’t fair weather fisherman that’s for sure. Anyone unprepared or uninformed is likely have a date with disaster sometime during their ice fishing years.”  To avoid such a situation, Crider suggested following these simple safety rules to minimize the risks associated with ice fishing and other ice-related activities.
