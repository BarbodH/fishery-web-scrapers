On the Grand River last week, 11 Haldimand County firefighters trained in ice rescue techniques before performing their practical and written tests on Friday. Stations No. 1 Caledonia, No. 4 Cayuga, No. 9 Dunnville and No. 10 Byng, took part in the training program.  During the testing, mistakes were considered to be unacceptable.  ""If the performance is not up to our standards, they fail,"" said instructor Paul Tarsintano, bluntly. ""There's no if, ands or buts.""  Tarsintano has been teaching the ice rescue course for 11 years. He works part time at Advanced Rescue Techniques School of Canada, the rescue division of Equinox Adventures, and full time as a Toronto EMS paramedic and is part of the Marine Unit Ice Rescue.  Haldimand Fire Services Deputy Chief Rick Smith said the search and rescue training and testing allows the 11 firefighters to be certified to the ice rescue technician instructor level.  ""This is basically training the trainers. Later this month, and in February, we will have these trainers train other firefighters.""  The practical testing took place behind the arena, close to the dam. Smith called the open water, ""Perfect for training.""  ""The water there looks calm, but it's very deceiving and dangerous because the ice is thin and there's a current.""  Smith cautioned the No. 1 person that dies during an incident in the water, is the would-be rescuer. He also spoke of the dangers of cold water.  ""After one or two minutes in the water, a person is so cold, they start breathing rapidly, gasping, and begin to gulp water. After 10 minutes in the water, you begin to lose muscle function.""  ""Ice is never safe,"" Tarsintano warns. He advises people to use caution when on the river. ""Before going out, contact your municipality for regulations about the thickness of ice.""  Smith suggests also asking about safe ice conditions at local businesses that rent ice-fishing huts, such as Steve Hardcastle's Fish Master Ultimate Bait and Tackle in Dunnville.  Tarsitano said the first rule in ice rescue is ""Safety for all. Then we execute the rescue.""  Both men said they strongly advise people to wear flotation vests and carry ice picks, which are widely sold.  ""Not enough people do, but it's getting better,"" said Smith.  Jeremy Crysler, a fire fighter for Station 9, said the hardest part of the training was dealing with the cold.  ""The training is going very well, though. Working as a team makes getting in and out of the water a lot faster.""  Carl Forrest, of Station 1, also found the cold the hardest part, but said the rescue suits worn were very warm. Miles Tuthill, of Station 10, said constantly pulling ropes throughout the week during mock rescues was very tiring.  Trainees were tested in self-rescue, using floating rope and ice picks. They were also tested in 'patient' rescue with two firefighters alternating rescue duties of a volunteer patient. As well, they were tested on rescuing a patient with the aid of rapid deployment crafts and rescue stretchers.  Haldimand Fire Services uses rescue stretchers from local business International Stretcher System. The stretchers are used world wide for land and water rescues. Smith said Equinox also supplies different types of equipment for trainees to try out, so that fire departments know what is available.  Smith said Haldimand Council has made a significant commitment to the search and rescue training program. Stations 1 and 9 will be getting rapid deployment crafts this year, while Stations 4 and 10 will get them next year. At the bow and stern ends of such crafts are openings, which allow patients to be pulled up into the craft rather than hauled over the side.  Near the end of the practical testing, Tarsintano said the trainees were performing ""very well.""  Smith indicated they had a lot to learn and demonstrate.  ""They have to prove themselves."" He said, matter-of-factly.  Photos"
