Jessie Buchholz ice fishes on Chemong Lake. / Lance Anderson     CITY OF KAWARTHA LAKES: The Kawartha Lakes region is well-known as an excellent fishing resource, but the news that ice fishing has returned to the area for the first time since the 1920s hasn’t hooked everyone.  According to the Minsitry of Natural Resources (MNR) 2010 regulations, fishing seasons for northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch, sunfish and black crappie are now extended to year-round, including the winter months in Fisheries Management Zone 17, which includes the City of Kawartha Lakes.  Ministry spokesperson Jamie Prentice says the news is good for anglers - not only does it open the pike and panfish season in the winter, but offers a great way to get kids into the sport and boost the local economy in the winter.  “It’s very exciting that ice fishing in the Kawarthas has opened again after [being closed] for about 80 years,” he said. “And, as of this year, the muskie and bass season has been extended from Nov. 15 to Dec. 15, which should make those fishermen happy.”  He added that bass and muskie have made such a strong comeback in area lakes, the MNR was able to re-introduce ice fishing.  Mark McBride, owner of Mark’s Worm Warehouse, a bait and tackle shop in Bobcaygeon, said it will take time for ice fishing to catch on in the area. But, he said he and several people he’s talked to are concerned it will have a negative impact on walleye populations.  “We aren’t going to steal the people who fish Lake Simcoe, and people from Toronto will go to Rice Lake,” he said. “But, one of our biggest (fishing) draws here is walleye, that’s what people target. I don’t see why the Ministry would bring in ice fishing when the walleye [population] is already hurting.” “Not everyone is happy about opening ice fishing here.’  Mr. McBride said his concern, and that of many anglers in his area is that walleye, although the season remains closed in winter, are often caught in the same areas as perch and bluegill. He’s worried that walleye caught inadvertently (known as ‘incidental catches’) won’t survive if released, thereby putting more pressure on that fishery.  “If they are taken out of the water and the cold air hits their gills, that’s it,” he said. “They don’t often survive.”  When asked about that, Mr. Prentice said that any fish, handled minimally and released properly stands a very good chance of surviving. But, he cautioned that, although incidental catches of walleye while fishing for panfish can and do happen, “we are relying on the ethics of responsible anglers, which most of them are” to release the fish immediately. “And, know your species,” he said, adding the MNR will have a significant enforcement presence to ensure the rules are adhered to.  Mr. Prentice also noted that bluegill, in particular, compete for the same food sources as walleye, and that allowing an ice fishing season in the Kawarthas would permit more of those fish to be caught. “That reduces the bluegill population and alleviates some of the pressure on the walleye,” he said.  Both he and Mr. McBride noted that it may take awhile for ice fishing to catch on in the area, as many people have never tried the sport. But, they both emphasized that safety on the ice is a priority. In many areas, ice anglers ask local hut operators and bait shop owners for ice condition information.  Mr. McBride agreed there will be a “transition” period for local businesses to see if ice fishing draws anglers to the area. He said there are currents in the Kawartha waterways that “are still there”, and anyone going out on the ice must be cautious.  Mr. Prentice agreed, saying the best advice is to drill test holes to check ice thickness, avoid open water, wear flotation suits, carry ice picks and “put safety before that big catch.” Jack Alexander, director of operations for the Trent-Severn Waterway, said that while there are strong currents on Kawartha lakes, many locals have used the waterways for years for snowmobiling, so are already aware of how to be safe on ice. He did say that under no circumstances should people be fishing around the dams, especially with the freezing spray and water around them in winter.  Mr. Prentice said panfishing is an excellent way to introduce children to the sport, and ice fishing not only opens up another winter activity, but offers great fun.  “Many kids get their first introduction to fishing by getting panfish on the end of their line,” he said. “It can shape them as anglers of the future.”  Mr. Prentice said the Ministry is hoping to see ice anglers drawn to the area with the new season, and the possibility certainly exists for increased tourism and economic opportunities. As for Mr. McBride, while he said he wasn’t sure if local anglers would take to the ice, he’s stocked his shop with tackle and bait for them. “We’ve got it, yes,” he said.  The Ministry will also be a sponsor of a winter panfishing event, part of the Family Fishing Weekend in February. The Bridgenorth Winter Panfish Festival will be held on Saturday, Feb. 13 from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. at Chemong Lake at BEL Rotary Park in Ennismore. Fishing equipment is provided for adults and kids who would like to try ice fishing. The event is free but donations will be accepted for the United Way. Parking is available at Chemong School or Causeway Christian Assembly and there will be a shuttle to thesite.  For more information on the new fishing regulations, visit www.mnr.gov.on.ca."

The speak briefly about the concern of incidental catches of walleye but failed to mention the regulation changes for walleye that should benefit that species in this region.  i.e. The new harvestable slot limit.  I glad they speak about how the new season will benefit the local businesses and anglers.  ""Mr. Prentice said the Ministry is hoping to see ice anglers drawn to the area with the new season, and the possibility certainly exists for increased tourism and economic opportunities. As for Mr. McBride, while he said he wasn't sure if local anglers would take to the ice, he's stocked his shop with tackle and bait for them. ""We've got it, yes,"" he said.""  As the festival spokesperson, It's nice they recognized the Bridgenorth Winter Panfish Festival. The event is shaping up to look like a great day on the water. This event is focused on attracting new anglers to spend a day on the ice enjoying the new angling oppourtunity. No equipment required. Everything will be provided if needed. Plan on joining us on Feb. 13, 2010 during the Winter Free Family Fishing Weekend.  Check out the website for more information about the event.  http://www.clearvieworganizing.com/22.html"
