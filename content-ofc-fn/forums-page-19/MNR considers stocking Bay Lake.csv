On March 4, MNR expressed their intent to change fishing regulations in the lake. Rules currently state that no fishing can occur on Bay Lake between Dec 1 and the end of May. During the open months, fishers are required to release lake trout sized at 40-55 centimeters.  ""People have complained about the state of local fishing, specifically to lake trout in Bay Lake,"" said Erin McDonald, area biologist for the Bancroft MNR.  ""It is a general concern we have had for several years now.""  Changing regulations is no easy process though, and takes two years to complete.  ""Fishing regulations fall under the Federal Fisheries Act. So to change any regulations, you have to get public support, go through a lot of paper work and work your way up the chain through the province, and that takes a while.""  For now, MNR says they can still stock the lake with lake trout to at least improve some fishing there.  Upon completion of the North Hastings Community Fish Hatchery, it was decided that hatchery management would focus on lake trout rehabilitation in L'Amable Lake, instead of Bay Lake.  According to MNR's report, submitted at the Hatchery's annual general meeting, there were several factors that were not favourable for rehabilitation of a native lake trout population in Bay Lake.  ""We decided not to go with rehabilitation stocking using the locally adapted strain of lake trout that will be raised at the hatchery.""  Lake trout require deep, oxygen-rich water to breed and flourish. Bay Lake unfortunately has not enough oxygen, and is too shallow.

""Without good water quality and spawning habitat, it would be very difficult to try to re-establish a reproducing and self-sustaining lake trout population.""  According to McDonald, there were attempts to improve spawning conditions in Bay Lake in the 1980's, but were unsuccessful due to the large calcium deposits in the lake.  But stocking is still a possibility.  ""Given the state of the water quality and habitat, the best option for establishing a lake trout fishery is likely to move towards a put-grow-take stocking situation.""  McDonald says MNR has coordinated with the provincial fish hatchery system, and asked for any leftover lake trout from restocking initiatives, for diversion into Bay Lake.  ""For the most part, you have to ask two years ahead of time to let the fish grow. But since they have an excess of fish, we may actually be able to stock as early as this spring.""
