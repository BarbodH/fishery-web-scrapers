The authority says the flows in the Lower Nottawasaga River downstream of the Minesing Wetland are still at flood peak and are expected to remain high for the remainder of the week.  The flows in all other watercourses in our area are on the decline.  Slippery, unstable stream banks and cold water temperatures can lead to hazardous conditions close to any water body. Folks are urged to stay clear of the shorelines of lakes and rivers.  Municipalities within the watershed will continue to monitor watercourse conditions closely until flows subside. The NVCA continues to monitor, meanwhile, and will issue any related flood messages as conditions warrant.  The warning will be in effect through Wednesday, April 16."
