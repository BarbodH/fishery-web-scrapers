Moving from the previous 90 days to a full year’s limited warranty coverage on most of these items is a comfort for our customers and serves to further Yamaha’s reputation for quality,"" said John Rigsby, Yamaha Marine Group national sales manager.  ""Now our customers have the same length of warranty period on over-the-counter parts, accessories, instruments and gauges as they would if the parts, accessories, instruments or gauges were dealer or builder-installed prior to original registration of the boat and engine package.""  As with any limited warranty, certain exclusions and limitations apply and are clearly detailed in the Yamaha Outboard Genuine Parts and Accessories Limited Warranty statement.  ""The majority of our parts and accessories enjoy this longer limited warranty period, and our customer will enjoy the peace of mind that comes with it,"" said Rigsby.
