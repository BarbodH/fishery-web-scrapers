It describes the findings that have resulted from ongoing scientific monitoring and will be distributed to 170,000 homes throughout the watershed over the next two weeks.  Scientists at the conservation authority, in cooperation with the provincial environment and natural resources ministries, monitor a variety of watershed features, some with particular attention. These special features are known as ‘indicators’ because they are like an early warning, signaling changes in the ecosystem. They help scientists understand how the health of the environment is changing and point to possible causes such as human activity, weather and pollution. The report grades the watershed on the basis of these indicators.  “Each indicator provides meaningful information about one aspect of the health of the watershed, but results for one indicator alone can’t always be explained by the reasons we first suspect,” said LSRCA board chair and East Gwillimbury councillor Virginia Hackson. “It’s the combination of indicators that helps us understand the total picture of how our environment is changing.”  Six indicators were used for the lake, and eight for each tributary (or subwatershed). Lake indicators include phosphorus and oxygen concentrations, water clarity, and various forms of aquatic wildlife. Tributary indicators include phosphorus, stormwater runoff, and vegetation.  The report was completed by the LSRCA in accordance with standards endorsed by Environment Canada, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, and Conservation Ontario.  “This report card presents a great deal of information, and it’s written in common language that everyone can understand,” Hackson said. “We think it’s important that all residents share these results so we can all work together to achieve the balance that is needed in the watershed.”  View Report Card (PDF)  All media inquiries, contact:  D.
