Dean L. Torgersen, 49, of Duluth, has been fined $1,000 for the walleye over-limit and $250 for transporting fish unlawfully taken. The fish have been forfeited to the Crown. Torgersen's fishing rods, depth sounder and other fishing gear will be returned when he has paid the fine.  On February 19, 2008, a Ministry of Natural Resources Thunder Bay District Conservation Officer stopped two men on snowmobiles on the Sag Road near Saganagons Lake just outside of Quetico Provincial Park. When the men told the officer that they had been fishing, he asked to check their fish and discovered Torgersen had four walleye over 46 centimetres (cm) in length. Under the regulations in the area where he was fishing, Torgersen was allowed a daily catch limit of two walleye of which one could be greater than 46 cm.  Justice of the Peace John Guthrie heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Thunder Bay on April 2, 2008.
