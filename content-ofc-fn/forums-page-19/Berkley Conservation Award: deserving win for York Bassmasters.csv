York Bassmasters won the prestigious award for their efforts in the Bogart Creek Restoration project.  “The York Bassmasters deserve this recognition,” said Gayle Wood, LSRCA’s Chief Administrative Officer. “Their hard work, in and out of Bogart Creek, has helped restore a critical part of the East Holland River. They have made a wonderful contribution to the work of restoring Lake Simcoe.”  Presented annually, the Berkley Conservation Award recognizes work by the Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society (BASS) Federation groups that gives back to the community and restores native lands. The Berkley Conservation Institute made the award at the BASS Federation Nation banquet, held this year in Greenville, South Carolina.T  he York Bassmasters helped remove trash and old fencing materials, clear the area of several invasive plant species, plant trees, stabilize stream banks and repair a fish ladder.  Since Bogart Creek feeds the East Holland River, the Bogart Creek Restoration project is part of the larger East Holland River Clean Up.  The clean up is a multi-year, $17-million campaign to restore the most degraded and populated river in the Lake Simcoe watershed. Hundreds of erosion control, tree planting, manure storage and septic system upgrade projects will improve the water quality in the river and in the lake itself.  In partnership with the municipalities through which the East Holland flows, the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority and the Lake Simcoe Conservation Foundation launched the clean up campaign last fall."
