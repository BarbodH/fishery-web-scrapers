The cooling trend has slowed snow melt and allowed water courses in the upper half of the watershed to crest and start to recede. River levels are still cresting in the Grand River downstream of Brantford and along the Nith River downstream of Plattsville.  Flows in the Nith River through New Hamburg were higher than originally forecast. It is estimated the flows through New Hamburg reached 350 cubic meters per second (m3/s) at 2 a.m. this morning. This is a provisional estimate. Reservoirs discharges were increased this morning to maintain or increase available reservoir storage in preparation for the remaining snowmelt and rainfall in the weather forecast at this time. Reservoir regulation reduced flows along the main Grand River in excess of 50 per cent.  Revised warning for Nith River in Ayr Levels and flows through the Village of Ayr are expected to peak at 8 p.m. this evening. Flows are expected to reach 350 m3/s. Levels on the staff gauge in Ayr are expected to reach 3.1 metres. Flows in Cedar Creek through Ayr peaked at 7 a.m. this morning and are currently receding. Municipal officials and police have been asked to issue updated notices to property owners and residents as needed.  Nith River - Wolverton It’s expected flows in the Nith River through Wolverton will peak late this evening. While flooding is not expected in Wolverton secondary township roads may be flooded. Municipal flood co-ordinators responsible for Oxford county and Brant County are asked to monitor local roads and close roads as necessary.  Nith River – Paris The Nith River through Paris is expected to peak early Thursday morning. Public works staff are requested to monitor the dyke along the Nith River at the Mechanic Street foot bridge to Lions Park overnight Wednesday and into the Thursday morning.

Conditions are being monitored closely. Updated messages will be issued as necessary over the next 24 hours. Banks adjacent to rivers and creeks are very slippery at this time and when combined with cold, fast-moving water pose a serious hazard. Parents are encouraged to keep their children and pets away from watercourses and off frozen water bodies at this time.
