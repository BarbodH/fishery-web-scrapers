Construction is about 80% complete on the dock being built by Acton Contracting and is fully funded by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Small Craft Harbours Branch.  The cost of building is $40,000.  Maintenance is administered through the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines and the Rainbow Country Local Service Board (RCLSB).  The project took 10 years to successfully secure funding doe to the persistence of Marcel Rancourt, President of the Lang Lake Cottagers Association.  Over 180 cottagers use the public dock located close to the Lang Lake Resort owned by Konstantin and Liudmila Aizenberg.  Lang Lake is just one of eight interconnecting lakes accessible from the dock.  Constructed out of hemlock, the new dock will finally eliminate the hazards that plagued the old dock. The new dock is four feet wider than the previous one.  Brent St. Denis said, “One thing about it taking this long (10 years), it will last that much longer.”  He commended the dedication and persistence of those involved commenting that the cottagers, many who come from the United States and southern Ontario, will know that RCLSB cares about them.  Richard Foucault, Chairman of the RCLSB, sent out his sincere thanks to his board and everyone involved, and commented on how Acton Contracting is going out of their way to make sure that the dock is well reinforced for the long road.  They are also coming in under budget and on time.  Marcel Rancourt of the Lang Lake Cottagers Association said that the Ministry of Natural Resources didn’t take an active role in the project, which is why they relied heavily on Brent St. Denis’s office for support over the last 10 years.  The new dock was necessary as water was coming over the sides of the dock, people were having accidents and grass was growing in the middle of the old structure.  Rancourt expressed how grateful the Lang Lake Cottagers Association was to the RCLSB for their support"
