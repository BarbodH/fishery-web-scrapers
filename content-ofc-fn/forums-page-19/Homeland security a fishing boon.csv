An anti-terrorism crackdown on the lakes could be a boon for the Canadian fishing charter business, much of it in Southwestern Ontario.  Starting next month, when the 2008 fishing charter season opens, it's expected anti-terrorism patrols will reel in U.S. fishing boats that cross into Canada over the invisible border on the lakes and return to American waters.  The Homeland Security Department intends to enforce new border security rules that have largely focused on U.S. entry by land and air.  Americans paying to fish on the Great Lakes will have to bring either a passport or two other pieces of ID if they plan to harvest fish from the richer Canadian side.  Once back ashore in the U.S, they'll have to drive to a government reporting station and pose for pictures -- not with their catch, but for customs officers, using a videophone.  Officers will run spot checks from patrol boats and aircraft.  ""Our concerns are anything from terrorists and terrorist weapons to drugs and undocumented aliens,"" says Brett Surgeon of the Customs and Border Protection service.  One veteran Southwestern Ontario charter owner said the crackdown will help restore balance to fishing rules tipped in favour of American rods and reels.  ""If that is true, that would benefit us greatly,"" said Jim Fleming of Wyoming, who operates Drifter 2 and has been in the business for 27 years on lakes Erie and St. Clair.  ""This is a major, major issue,"" he said.  Fleming said the crackdown could mean Americans wanting to fish Canadian will find it more attractive to hire Canadian charters, rather than leave from the American side and risk security hassles.  It turns out Canada's half of Lake Erie is deeper and cooler than the U.S. side, and spawns the best fishing, making it desired for the U.S. business.  The U.S. industry says the new rules will sink it.  ""How does this secure our country?"" said Rick Ungar, a retired Ohio police chief, now a charter boat captain.  ""I'm not insensitive to law enforcement issues, but these are fishermen, for God's sake.""  Some operators haven't decided whether to continue fishing in Canadian waters.  Fleming, a staple at fishing trade shows and charter captain for fishing TV show stars, said the pleasure fishing industry has taken a hit because of the rising Canadian dollar, high fuel prices and the deteriorating U.S. economy.  He said his client base was once 40 per cent American, but that's dwindled to 10 per cent.  The changing economy has also hit local marinas, he said.  At trade shows, Fleming said the question he's asked most often is about potential hassles at the border.  Fleming also sits on the board of the Michigan-Ontario Muskee Club -- and the Canadian side of Lake St. Clair has 70 per cent of the prized fish.  He suspects muskee enthusiasts will come across by land first rather than risk Homeland Security.  Fleming said unlike government fishery patrols, few and far between, Homeland Security has ""lots and lots of money"" to patrol the water.  ""We heard last summer they were going to make their presence known this year.""  Ruth Tetrault, owner of the Cove Marina at Lighthouse Cove, where the Thames River meets Lake St. Clair, said the rules could be ""a little bit of a setback"" because anglers tend to be law-abiding.  ""One thing about a boater -- if you're a boater and fisherman, you're going to do it no matter what,"" she said.  Related Story"
