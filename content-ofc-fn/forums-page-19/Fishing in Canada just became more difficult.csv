That is the word from CBP authorities, who are stepping up homeland security on the Great Lakes boundary with Canada.  The invisible line is going to become seriously visible to government terrorist-watchers.  Just how much reporting you will have to do on each trip ""over the line"" depends on what you do ""over there"" and what kinds of planning you have done in terms of documentation.  And just be glad you are not a charter fishing guide; CBP has upped the reporting ante big time for charter fishing businesses, to the point that many skippers angrily vow to skip fishing in Canada altogether because of the additional hassle.  So far, about the only thing you can do without having to report is straight-course running. An example would be cutting a corner of the boundary, on a run from Port Clinton to Detroit. Other than that, be prepared.  As of the close of government business on Friday, a decision is pending from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, CBP's parent agency, about how seriously to classify sport fishing.  If sport fishing is ruled to be similar to simple navigation, there will be no need to report as an individual on returning from Canadian waters. But a vessel-return report by phone still will be needed.  All of which is critical to the fleet of western Lake Erie walleye and smallmouth bass fishermen. For decades they have prowled the Ontario-side islands and reefs in the western Lake Erie basin all but unfettered, and they have seen agency surveillance and checking increase only incrementally until the last year or so.  If fishermen are left off the reporting hook, as far as needing to report individually, all that must by done is to call in the return of the boat to a U.S. port.  In Ohio and Pennsylvania waters of Lake Erie, that can be done toll-free at 1-888-523-BOAT. In the Detroit area dial 313-393-3793 or 313-393-3949. In any case all vessel arrivals at U.S. ports must be called in.  Most of the extra burden from now on will revolve around the circumstances under which you must ""present yourself for inspection"" under federal immigration rules.  ""One of the big changes this year is that CBP has stopped taking oral declarations of citizenship,"" summed Chief Ron Smith, of the Detroit CBP field office. Many of the other rules being enforced this year have been in place since at least 2002, but the massive security reorganization of customs, immigration, and border protection under the DHS umbrella has taken till now to hit home here.  So, documented declaration of citizenship will be required any time you actually land or are ""grounded"" in Canada - that is, tie up at a dock or marina and have to pass through Canada Customs. That includes stopping for bait or a fishing license at Pelee Island or running across to a north-shore marina at such places as Wheatley, or Colchester, or Kingsville.  CPB is allowing a one-document option, most generally a valid U.S. passport for Americans, or a two-document option, generally a valid driver's license and birth certificate. You will need to keep such documents with you when crossing to Canada if there is any chance you will actually land there.  If you do land in Canada, on your return to port in the U.S. you have to present yourself for inspection. The easiest way to do that is to obtain in advance an I-68 certificate, or Canada Border Boat Landing Program.  If you land in Canada and have an I-68 certificate you can report yourself by phone when you report a vessel at the above-listed numbers. An I-68 must be obtained in person at a CBP office at a cost of $16; it is good for a year. You must bring along three passport-size photos [most mega-pharmacies offer them for about $8 in five minutes] and your citizenship documents [passport or birth certificate and driver's license]. You will have a fingerprint made of your right index finger.  The whole I-68 process takes about 15 minutes.  If you want to minimize hassle on the water, make an appointment with the regional CBP office and get an I-68 now. In Toledo, the CBP office is on the fifth floor of the Ohio Building, 420 Madison Ave., 419-259-6424. In Sandusky dial 419-625-0022, and in Cleveland 216-267-3600.  If you already hold a NEXUS card -a Trusted Traveler Card - it is as good as an I-68. But NEXUS cards are not being issued in Ohio or Pennsylvania now, CBP said.  If you do not have an I-68 certificate and you do land in Canada, on your return to a U.S. port you must report to CPB in person at one of their offices, or call in on a videophone called OARS, for Outlying Area Reporting Station, which can be used 24/7. Best have your citizenship papers with you too.  On western Lake Erie the OARS phones are located at Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island, Brand's Marina in Port Clinton, and Cedar Point Marina. The next nearest one among 12 on the lake is at East 55th Street in Cleveland, but CBP supposedly is working on adding more.  Lake Erie is a focal point because of its relatively small size, structure, and concentration of fishing, said Brett Sturgeon, a public affairs officers for the CBP field office in Chicago. That is especially so in the relatively narrow western basin, where much of the fishing and boating activity also is concentrated.  ""That's part of what we're up against,"" added Sturgeon. He explains the regulations are not bureaucratic harassment. ""I certainly hope people don't think it is.  ""By legitimate business entities [and recreational boats] reporting their arrival to CBP, it allows CBP to concentrate our resources on individuals and vessels who fail to report their arrival and/or are engaging in illicit activities.""  Sturgeon said, for example, CBP is in the process of establishing a greater air and marine presence on Lake Erie, including deploying more agents.  At Detroit, Chief Smith said he has been busy talking to boaters' groups about the new reporting requirements and acknowledges it will take some getting used to.  ""It may be a hassle, but not such a big hassle that you want to give up something you enjoy,"" Smith said.  Failure to report can result in civil penalties of $5,000 the first time and $10,000 thereafter, with the vessel in question subject to seizure. In addition the master of the wayward vessel upon conviction is liable for a fine of up to $2,000 plus a year in jail.  CBP asks for your eyes and ears on the water. Report any suspicious activities to 1-800-505-8381."
