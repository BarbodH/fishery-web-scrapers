Event coordinator Carolyn Chymko is eagerly anticipating a positive response to her application for a share of the $30 million Celebrate Ontario 2008 program.  She envisioned musical acts performing in a professionally-designed portable stage with permanent lighting and suitable electrical wiring.  ""This is huge. Everyone can benefit from a stage,"" she said thinking of the Dunnville fair and other community events.  Chymko applied for the maximum amount, $100,000, in the hopes of purchasing the stage and a novelty people mover - possibly shaped like a boat or barge. Decorated with a mudcat, the mover will travel the streets during the festival. It begins in three months.  Launched in December by the provincial government, the Celebrate Ontario program was established to enhance festivals and events to draw in more tourists.  Haldimand County volunteer coordinator Heather Flaherty said only events of more than three days qualify for funding. She notified organizers of the Jarvis Cornfest, Caledonia fair and Mudcat Festival about the grant.  ""Carolyn jumped on it,"" said Flaherty who received no responses from the other two events.  ""I'm keeping my fingers and toes crossed that we're getting it,"" said Chymko.  An announcement is expected in the week of March 24."
