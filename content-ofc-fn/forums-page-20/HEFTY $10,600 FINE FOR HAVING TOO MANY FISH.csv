The man was fined $6,000 for having 30 walleye over the legal limit and $4,600 for having 23 brook trout over the legal limit and forfeits the fish to the Crown.  During a police investigation in January 2006, an OPP officer discovered a lot of fish in the freezers at the manâ€™s residence. The officer seized the fish and turned it over to a Ministry of Natural Resources Thunder Bay District conservation officer. After investigating, the conservation officer laid charges against the man and the other occupant of the home. At a trial in November 2006, they were each fined $4,200, but both of the accused successfully appealed and got a new trial.  At the new trial on February 6, 2008, the man claimed that the fish belonged to a First Nation person, but was unable to produce that person for questioning at trial. The man was convicted. The Crown withdrew charges against the second person.  The case was heard in the Ontario Court of Justice in Thunder Bay.  The ministry reminds the public that fishing regulations are in place to ensure the sustainability of the fishery so that anglers may enjoy the resource in the future."
