Due to the extensive mid-winter thaw that central and southern Ontario experienced in January of 2008, water levels in Lake Simcoe are higher than those normally expected at this time of year. The current lake level is approximately 0.3 metres (1 foot) higher than normal.The coming spring thaw will add additional water to the lake as the snow pack melts.  Higher than normal lake water levels can increase potential for flooding in low-lying areas where ground levels are only slightly higher than normal lake levels. Flooding caused by ice jams, wave action and high winds may also increase as a result of these elevated lake levels.  Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates through the media if conditions change."
