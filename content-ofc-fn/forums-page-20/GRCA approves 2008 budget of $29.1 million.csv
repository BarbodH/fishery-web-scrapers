The budget was approved by the GRCA board at its annual meeting in Cambridge on Feb. 29  Although the budget is up about $5.7 million from last year, most of the increase is due to special one-time projects that are being covered with grants from the province, municipalities or other sources.  The cost to the 950,000 watershed residents for their share of the GRCA budget this year will be about $8.54 a person.  Expenditures  Budget expenditures can be broken down into three broad categories: special projects, the base (or operating) budget and conservation area operations.  Special projects: $5.4 million (18 per cent of expenditures)  Spending on special projects this year is up considerably from the $1.7 million budgeted in 2007. Some of the projects this year include:                .      Base budget: $18.1 million (62 per cent of expenditures)  The base budget, which covers ongoing operations and programs, totals $18.1 million, an increase of $1.6 million from the budgeted amount in 2007. That pays for the GRCA’s work to prevent flooding, improve water quality, protect water supplies, provide environmental education, provide environmental planning advice to municipalities and landowners, operate trails, and manage forests, wetlands and other sensitive environmental lands.  Included in this part of the budget is the cost of  installation of two new water quality gauges on the Grand River. About $140,000 will be spent on a gauge at Victoria Street in Kitchener, half of which is being paid by the Region of Waterloo. The GRCA is also spending $160,000 on a water quality station on the Grand at York in Haldimand County.  Conservation area operations: $5.6 million (19 per cent of expenditures)  The GRCA’s 12 conservation areas are financially self-sufficient and record more than one million paid visits a year. Operating costs are expected to rise $100,000 this year.  Revenues The GRCA has three principle sources of revenue:  Self-generated funds: $12.2 million (44 per cent of revenue)  Self-generated funds are expected to rise by about $780,000 (6.8 per cent) this year. The money comes from park admission fees, property rental, hydro-electricity sales, fees for services such as planning, school board payments for outdoor education programs, tree sales from the Burford Nursery, donations from the Grand River Conservation Foundation and other sources.  Municipal levy: $9 million (33 per cent of revenue)  This money comes from watershed residents as part of their municipal property taxes or charges on municipal water bills and amounts to about $8.54 a person. The total is up by about $540,000 from last year. The amount collected from each municipality is based on its property assessment, so can vary from one area to another, however the average increase is 6.99 per cent.  Government grants: $6.4 million (23 per cent of revenues) Almost all of this money comes from the provincial government, in two types of grants:         Further information: Dave Schultz, GRCA Coordinator of Communications Phone: (519) 621-2763, Ext. 2273 Fax: (519) 621-4844 E-mail: Dave Schultz"
