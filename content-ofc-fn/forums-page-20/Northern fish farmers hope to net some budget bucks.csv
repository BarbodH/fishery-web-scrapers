The Northern Ontario Aquaculture Association (NOAA) says federal finance minister Jim Flaherty's budget announcement demonstrates the importance the industry holds as an economic driver in rural Canada.  ""Not only are we producing a healthy product that is naturally rich in Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids,"" says NOAA executive director Karen Tracey, ""we are now poised to make even greater economic contributions to Ontario's economy.""  The association says in 2007, Northern Ontario-farmed rainbow trout generated $51 million in economic contributions.  Tracey expects the federal commitment signals a streamlining of the regulatory coordination between federal and provincial agencies governing aquaculture."

So Ottawa gives away our tax money to something that's detrimental to natural stocks and the Ontario Goverment doesn't want to make any selling prime land because it MIGHT hurt natural Lake Trout stocks. There's a flaw in there somewhere...
