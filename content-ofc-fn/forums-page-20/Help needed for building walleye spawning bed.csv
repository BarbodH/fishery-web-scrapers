169303,Spiel,2008-03-09 21:17:00,9059,"Help needed for building walleye spawning bed   March 5, 2008 / North Star, Parry Sound    Help needed for building walleye spawning bed, should you choose to get involved, the MCA (McKellar Conservation Association), in conjunction with MNR (Ministry of Natural Resources) and Transport Canada (Marine), will be creating another walleye spawning bed on a shoal on Lake Manitouwabing.  Thirty-three tons of washed river rock with approximate diameters of four to eight inches (10 to 16 cm.), - that’s two tandem truck loads - will be dumped on the road closest to the intended site on Jones Bay.  The rock will be hand loaded onto sleighs to be ferried via snowmobiles to a shoal, which has been cordoned off and that is 60 by 60 feet (18 by 18 metres). For safety's sake, buoyed metal rods supporting caution tapes, signage and blazing and reflective tape will be erected. The buoys are attached so that after the ice melts the rig can be retrieved from the lake. The rock will be hand placed on the ice in a 40-by-50-foot (12 -by -15-metre) rectangle where, during melt off, it will settle on top of the shoal awaiting the spring spawning activities. (An error had been made in a previous article as to the diameter of the rock and is now corrected.)  Come join us. In fact, also enjoy hot refreshments and barbecued sausage at our lunch break. Let us know of your intention to help us so that ample lunch supplies are made available.  Should you be able to spend part of the day with us, that is not a problem. Many hands make light work.  Here is a list to consider of what you might include with your helpful attitude and the willingness to ""walk the walk"": a life jacket or survival suit (should you intend on being on the ice); heavy work gloves plus an extra as they will get wet; spade type shovels and/or hard rake; and snow mobiles with sleds.  To get to the work site, take Burnetts Road off the Hurdville road between Centre Road and Hurdville, to a right on Stormy Point Road. Go approximately .5 kilometres until you once again turn right on Wendy’s Lane. At the end, approximately 1 kilometre, is the turnaround and the work site.
