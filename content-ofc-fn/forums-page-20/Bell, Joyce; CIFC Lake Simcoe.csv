He has been in every one of the tournaments.    Sutton’s Jeff Bell and Sudbury’s Mike Joyce landed three big whitefish on the second day of competion to win the Canadian Ice Fishing Championship last weekend.  Bell and Joyce, got a solid start on perch day to open the annual tournament, but it wasn’t enough to catch Don Meacham and Barry Lance, The Lunker Catchers, who held the lead going into day two with more than nine pounds weighed in for the maximum 15 perch.  The pair, both Georgina firefighters, were awarded the Roger Kett plaque.  Second place went to John Delicata of Innisfil and partner Vlado Crljen of Mississauga. They walked off with a cheque for $3,400 and the silver medal.  Crljen also took the Dan Perry Award for biggest lake trout, a 28-incher.  Past champ Norm Joyce won the John Reddings Award for biggest whitefish at 26 inches.  The team of Rhonda Hamilton and John Blazys of Jackson’s Point scored enough to win the mixed doubles medals.  Hamilton also walked off with the Jean Power trophy for top female.  The pair finished 10th, enough to get into the money pool.  David Hamilton and Mike Levesque of Sutton won the bronze medal for third, pocketing $2,380.  When all the measuring and weighing was done, Bell and Joyce ended up as top point getters, accepting their gold medals and a cheque for $6,800.  The duo came close last year, with a third place finish.  “We did (well) on the first day and caught 15 perch all of really good size,” Bell said. “We were landing the fish right from the start.”  The pair also got off to a quick start Sunday getting some action soon after casting their lines.  Bell pulled in two 25-inch whities, while Joyce hooked another one. Two other whitefish managed to throw the hook, Bell said.  Joyce is related to the past championship winners the Georgina Joyce clan.  “I taught him everything he knows,” his uncle Brian Joyce said grinning.  On rules night at the CIFC headquarters Kin Hall Friday, Sutton Home Hardware owner Dave Haynes was awarded the prestigious Bill Bond Memorial Trophy for his contributions to ice fishing.  The 70 two-person teams enjoyed spectacular weather Saturday and Sunday with bright sunshine and excellent ice conditions.  Competitors included Joe Montgomery, 85, the oldest taking part.  Mr. Montgomery from Niagara has attended all 14 championships.  Madsen said he was delighted with how smoothly this year’s championship went.
