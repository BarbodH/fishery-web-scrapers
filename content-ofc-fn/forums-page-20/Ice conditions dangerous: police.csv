Last weekend, the York Regional Police marine unit responded to four separate emergency calls to assist snowmobilers and their passengers because they did not heed warnings the ice on Lake Simcoe is no longer safe.  On three occasions, snowmobilers did not spot hazardous pressure cracks in the ice and crashed.  This resulted in four people suffering injuries.  In one of the incidents, an Innisfil man lost control.  The driver was not injured, however, the passenger was transported to hospital.  After investigation, the 23-year-old driver was charged with impaired driving and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm.  Sunday, a 34-year-old Innisfil woman was injured when her snowmobile struck a metre-high pressure crack near the mouth of Cook’s Bay, west of Roches Point.  The woman was snowmobiling south on the lake at an estimated 50 to 60 km/h when she struck the wall of ice and the machine rolled over. She suffered serious, but non-life-threatening injuries.  The crack runs east from the Innisfil shoreline and then south into Cook’s Bay for about two kilometres and was difficult to spot due to drifting snow, according to South Simcoe Police.  Another incident involved a man who was driving his pickup truck several miles off shore when it broke through the ice.  The owner managed to remove his vehicle safely and no injuries were reported.  Two Virginia men died when their snowmobiles crashed through the ice near Georgina Island on New Year’s Day and a Toronto angler fell through the ice and drowned in January.  York Regional Police issued a warning this week that lakes and streams are not frozen and are unsafe.  The ice is beginning to thaw, so you are warned to stay off it.  Ice fishing season ended March 15, but anglers are still going out on the lake to fish for perch.  The ice road to Georgina Island is rough.  Before venturing to the island, call the Chippewas of Georgina office at 705-437-1337 for conditions.  Police caution anyone who ventures onto Lake Simcoe, to follow these safety precautions:  • Know the condition of the ice before you go out and take into consideration the recent changes the weather may have had on the ice;  • Be suspicious of grey, dark or porous spots in the ice as these may be soft areas. Ice is generally strongest where it is hard and blue;  • Wear the appropriate survival clothing and flotation devices.  York Regional Police reminds the public snowmobiling and ice-fishing are inherently risky activities occurring in an uncontrolled and unpredictable natural setting.
