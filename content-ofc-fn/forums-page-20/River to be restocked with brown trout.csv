The Big River Group and the Upper Saugeen Habitat Restoration Association have asked council for support in their push to get permission from the Ministry of Natural Resources to restock the river with brown trout.  Mayor Kevin Eccles said that stretch of river has always been a popular fishing spot for brown trout, but numbers have declined in recent years.  Since 1998, the USHRA, in partnership with the MNR, has been involved in a brown trout population enhancement project in a small stretch of the river, but it wants to expand the project to include the river from Hanover to Durham."
