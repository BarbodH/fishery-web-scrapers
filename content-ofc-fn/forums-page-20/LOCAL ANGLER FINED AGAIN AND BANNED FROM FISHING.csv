MARIE — A repeat natural resource violator has been fined $800.00 for fishing violations.  A man from Heyden, was convicted of trespassing and failing to produce his fishing licence. He is banned from fishing in Ontario for two years and forfeits his fishing equipment. If he does not pay his fines within a year, the fishing ban may be extended.  Court was told that on June 5, 2007, a conservation officer received two complaints that people were trespassing on the CN railway bridge at the St. Marys rapids in Sault Ste. Marie.  The man did not have his fishing licence with him but claimed he had bought one. He failed to produce it even when an officer gave him time. This was his second conviction for not having a fishing licence and the second for trespassing in the same location. He hadn’t paid previous fines either.  The case was heard in the Ontario Provincial Court in Sault Ste. Marie on February 7, 2008.  Members of the public are reminded that trespassing on any of the railway bridges at the historic canal is both unsafe and illegal."
