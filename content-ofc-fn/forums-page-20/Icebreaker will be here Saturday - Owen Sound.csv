The coast guard ""will be conducting icebreaking operations through the shipping channel into Owen Sound in support of commercial shipping,"" according to a news release. ""Ice fishers, snowmobilers and other recreational users of the ice are strongly advised to remain well clear of the icebreaker's track. Spring ice conditions will result in hazardous and unstable conditions."" Coast guard officials could not say Thursday when the icebreaker will be pulling into the harbour because the timing depends on variables including conditions on its trip through Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River. For more information call the Coast Guard operations office at 1-800-265-0237."
