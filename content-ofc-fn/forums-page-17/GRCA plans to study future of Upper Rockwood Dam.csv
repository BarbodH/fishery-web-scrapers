The review, which is called a Class Environmental Assessment, will include opportunities for members of the public to comment on plans for the dam. The dam, which is about one metre high and it is located at the top of a two meter waterfall. The dam is one of two in the park and is adjacent to the ruins of the old Harris Mill. The dam was likely built in the 1860s around the same time as the mill.  The dam has two concrete abutments and three piers. Sets of logs (called stoplogs) are placed between the abutments and piers to block the flow of water in the Eramosa River. When the logs are in place, they create a pond that is about one metre deep and two hectares in area.     Upper Rockwood Dam with all the stoplogs in place.    The stoplogs have reached the end of their 25-year life span and replacements would cost about $10,000. The GRCA removed some of the logs in 2006. Since then, vegetation has grown up in the previously flooded area.  The environmental assessment will consider a range of alternatives that includes doing nothing, replacing the stoplogs and repairing the piers or removing the entire dam.  Part of the process will be to investigate the impact of the dam on water quality in the Eramosa River. The Eramosa is a coldwater river, however the presence of the dam creates a pond where the water warms up before moving downstream to the larger pond at the centre of the conservation area.  Those interested in providing written comments or receiving future notices concerning the study should contact Naomi Moore, project co-ordinator.
