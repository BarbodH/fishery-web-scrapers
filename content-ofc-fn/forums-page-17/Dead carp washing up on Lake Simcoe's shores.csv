According to Jane Sirois, the information officer for the MNR's Aurora District, there have been a smattering of reports from around the lake.  ""At this time of year that's not hugely unusual. The environmental conditions are right for a fish die-off,"" she said.  ""But we are keeping an eye on it.""  The ministry has a dedicated number -- 1-866-929-0994 -- for residents to report sightings of multiple dead fish.  Callers will be asked for information about the species, condition and number of fish, the location of the fish and recent weather or environmental conditions.  The line is open around the clock."
