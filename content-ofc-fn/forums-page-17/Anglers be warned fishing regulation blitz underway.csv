The area of the blitz extends from Hudson Bay and James Bay in the north to the French and Mattawa rivers in the south, and from the Ontario-Quebec border in the east to Lake Superior and the Manitouwadge Area in the west. The blitz runs from May 17 to June 14. The walleye fishery generally opens May 17 across the northeast  Anglers are reminded of the following licensing requirements:  - Residents of Canada must have a fishing licence tag attached to a valid Outdoors Card.  - Non-residents of Canada must have a fishing licence tag attached to a signed basic licence form.  - Outdoors Cards and non-resident licences are not transferable and they must be carried anytime you are fishing.  - Anglers must show their licence to a conservation officer if asked.  When transporting fish, anglers must ensure that fish length is readily measurable at all times for fish taken from waterbodies where size limits are in effect, unless the fish are:  - being prepared for immediate consumption;  - prepared at an overnight accommodation for storage;  - being transported on the water from a temporary overnight accommodation to a person's primary residence and that person is NOT engaged in sport fishing; or  - being transported overland  Conservation officers must also be able to determine the species and number of fish that are in the anglers’ possession.  For more information on fishing regulations, please continue to consult the 2008 -2009 Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary before heading out to fish. It is available at ServiceOntario/Government Information Centres outlets and from most licence issuers, as well as on the ministry’s website at: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html  Some patrols may be carried out jointly with the Ontario Provincial Police. The police may enforce other statutes, such as the Liquor Licence Act and Boating Restrictions Regulations. Conservation officers may also enforce Small Vessel Regulations.  To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) any time or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
