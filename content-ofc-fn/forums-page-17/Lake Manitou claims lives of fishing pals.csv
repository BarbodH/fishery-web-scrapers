The two Ohio men, Harpal Chohan, 48, of Columbus and Russ Morrison, 44, of Gahann were staying at the Wee Point Resort on Bidwell Road and had only just arrived Thursday. The pair left for a boat ride on Lake Manitou at around 5 pm and were not seen again.  Jim Hembruff, proprietor of Wee Point Resort said he and his family are greatly saddened by the event, explaining that one of the men had been coming to Wee Point for over 10 years. He said the lake was ""wild"" that day and noted that the vessel the men were traveling in was not very large.  ""There's an old saying that goes 'there's no two fishing trips alike,'"" Mr. Hembruff said as a warning of the unpredictability of Mother Nature. ""Conditions can change fast on the lake.""  The proprietor said the boat was seen from the resort property Thursday evening running in ""figure eights"" and obviously unmanned when the police were called.  Constable Al Boyd, community services officer with the OPP, said that upon police arrival-approximately 6:30 pm-the boat was found on shore with the motor still running.  That evening a search was initiated with officers on foot as well as the marine unit. The United Chiefs and Councils of Manitoulin Tribal Police also assisted in the search, launching their vessel on Lake Manitou as well. Constable Boyd explained that the emergency response team and the OPP helicopter from Sudbury were activated that evening. The search continued until sunset that night and resumed at daybreak Friday morning.  Both the North Shore Search and Rescue team and the Rescue Coordination Centre Trenton were notified and on standby.  When the search again resumed on Saturday morning, the dive unit located the bodies of the two men not far from the resort. Police investigation has shown that neither men were wearing a life jacket.  Mr. Hembruff could not say enough about the police efforts over the course of the three days.  ""They did everything they could do,"" he said.  Constable Boyd warned of the lake temperatures, both inland and in the North Channel and Lake Huron.  ""We haven't had warm temperatures considering the time of year and the water is still extremely cold,"" Constable Boyd said. ""Hypothermia should be a considering factor for those venturing out fishing or boating. People need to be aware. It doesn't take long until the core body temperature starts to go down.""  ""I can't stress the importance of life preservers enough, even in the middle of summer when the water is warm,"" the officer continued. ""They should be worn at all times.""  Tracy Braun of the Canadian Red Cross said the biggest mistake people make is believing they can put their life jackets on after there is a mishap.  ""You don't usually end up in the water by choice,"" she said. ""It's the same message as seatbelts. You wouldn't wait until an accident to put it on, would you? It's only going to prevent something if you have it on-not use it as a seat cushion.""  Ms. Braun noted that the highest rate for drowning victims is males between the ages of 14 and 45 as they are the ""hardest group to try and change their behaviour.""  ""Even good swimmers drown,"" she said. ""The best life jacket is the one you wear.""  Constable Boyd noted that this makes three drownings already this year-including 38-year-old Sergio Girimonte of Brampton drowned in Mudge Bay on April 26. Mr. Girimonte lost his footing while fishing for rainbow trout and slipped under the water. His body was recovered the following morning by the OPP underwater recovery unit.  ""Know the conditions of the water and always wear a life preserver,"" Constable Boyd stressed. ""Take extra precautions and always notify someone as to where you're going."""
