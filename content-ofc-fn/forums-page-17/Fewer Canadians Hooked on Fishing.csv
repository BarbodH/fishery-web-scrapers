Gas is at an all time high, boats are exspensive to buy.  Aluminum boats used to be the inexpensive way to get out on the water now your looking at almost 8-10 grand for new boat with a 25 horse power motor, add the gas to get you there and all of a sudden you are looking at 400-500 bucks for a weekend trip in bait, gas meals and maybe a decent place to sleep not to mention the monthly payment on your boat.  It seems like most people are stayng in and spending money on home thertres rather then the great outdoors.  so good for the fish but bad for the fishing resorts, bait shops small fishing towns that really need the tourism.  Add the canadian dollar at par with the us and there goes the value americans used to get when they came up here.  Good and bad news here, you decide for yourself which you think it is.  Cheers!"

Mom & Dad are breaking their backs to put food on the table..the priorities have changed.Less $$ to waste now. P3TA gives kids a ""guilt trip"" about fishing & hunting. General public thinks all the fish are unfit to eat from pollution...ad infinitum.."
