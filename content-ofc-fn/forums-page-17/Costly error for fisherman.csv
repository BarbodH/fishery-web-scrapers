Lyle Zilney, 34, of Combermere, left his ice fishing hut on Kamaniskeg Lake after March 31 in Fisheries Management Zone 15 and was fined $1,000 by the Ministry of Natural Resources.  On April 17, the Ontario Court of Justice, Bancroft, heard conservation officers from Bancroft District followed up on a complaint report to TIPS-MNR concerning an unlawful ice hut on Kamaniskeg Lake. Given the ice had recently broken up during a spring thaw, the officers were faced with recovering a floating ice hut. It posed a threat to the lake environment and was a safety hazard to boaters.Although the hut was successfully removed from the lake, the operation monopolized valuable staff time and equipment resources.  Justice of the Peace B. Moran heard the case in Ontario Court of Justice, Bancroft, on June 3. Zilney was subsequently fined."
