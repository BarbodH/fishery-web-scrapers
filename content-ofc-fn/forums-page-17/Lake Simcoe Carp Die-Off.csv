The situation in Lake Simcoe is similar to what occurred in Lake Scugog and the Kawartha lakes in the summer of 2007. Presently, dead carp are being reported across all shorelines in Lake Simcoe with varying amounts based on location.  The Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority is encouraging lakeshore residents to clean up their shorelines and place the dead carp in double garbage bags at your curb side for removal. Lake Simcoe municipalities have arranged for special provisions for the collection of dead carp placed curb side as well as disposal at your local waste transfer facility. Please contact your local municipality via phone or check the website for collection and disposal details.  Residents involved in the disposal of dead carp along their shorelines are encouraged to wear gloves and wash their hands with soap and water. Also, residents are encouraged to clean and disinfect any tools or containers used as part of the collection and disposal process.  To report fish die-offs, call the Ministry of Natural Resources hotline at 1-866-929-0994."
