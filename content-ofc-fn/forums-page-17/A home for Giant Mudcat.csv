On Monday, Haldimand County council members unanimously agreed to locating the giant mudcat statue in the park near Grandview Lodge. According to a report by leisure services manager Rick Lane, the project committee was in favour of this location because of issues with other sites including Wingfield Park.  First proposed in October 2006, the huge statue may finally have a place to call home. The giant mudcat will be 50 feet (15 metres) long and will rise 27 feet (eight metres) in the air. It will be set upon a support structure so it will appear to float six feet (two metres) off the ground. Lighting and rocks will simulate a river atmosphere.  The anticipated arrival of the big fish has changed county plans for the one-and-a-half-acre park at the corner of Highway 3 and Robinson Road. Naturalization will be set aside for a passive park with manicured grass, trees, fountain improvements, flower gardens and more decorative lights.  In Lane's report, he suggested locating the fish about 125 feet off the road. Trees will be moved to another part of the park to make room for the statue.  Coun. Lorne Boyko was elated that this location was selected because this is where the community initially thought it should go.  The Big Mudcat project committee and the Rotary Club of Dunnville have agreed to the terms of the lease agreement as prepared by county corporate services, said Lane.  As well as welcoming council's support, project committee chair Jack Hooghiem wanted to review details. ""At this stage, we have to see the agreement and discuss it with committee members,"" he said.  ""It will be standing a year from today if all goes well,"" he stated. Originally estimated at a $60,000 project with the statue and a parade float, the big mudcat will become a reality with the support of the Rotary Club, Kinsmen Club of Dunnville, Lioness Club of Dunnville, Lions Club of Dunnville and Optimist Club of Dunnville. Private donations and an anticipated Trillium grant will round out fundraising efforts.  At first, the committee wanted to mount the fish on the site of the old library at Wingfield Park. Several proposals popped up for the building with the last being restoration of the house. Council advised the Big Mudcat committee that no decision about the park would be made until the Dunnville Culture and Heritage Foundation business plan was received.  At that time, council suggested Centennial Park which was recently accepted by the Big Mudcat committee.  John McKay of the culture and heritage foundation said the group, which wants to preserve the 140-year-old Braund House and keep it in Wingfield Park, presented its business plan to county staff. At the June 16 council committee meeting, staff will table a report reviewing the plan.  To gather more support and promote their project, the Dunnville Culture and Heritage Foundation will have a booth at the Mudcat Festival's Community Lane in Central Park on June 7. The group will sell memberships and take pledges toward restoration of the Georgian home of tin smith William Braund.  McKay said a show of support from the community will give them a say in protecting this heritage building."
