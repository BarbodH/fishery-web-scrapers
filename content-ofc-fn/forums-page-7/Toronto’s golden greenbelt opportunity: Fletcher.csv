In fact, the city’s own river valleys connect to the ecological systems of the Greenbelt and in turn contribute to clean air, water and other environmental benefits.  On Monday, Toronto city council will vote on a proposal from the parks and environment committee to begin the process of designating the Don and Humber River valleys as part of Ontario’s Greenbelt.  This designation will provide permanent protection to the natural heritage features of these river valleys. It has the potential to make important connections between present and future generations of Torontonians and the ecological systems that help sustain us.  The designation of the Don and Humber River valleys is akin to fitting a large piece of the puzzle into place when it comes to our natural heritage infrastructure.  Running beside those commuter roadways that intersect our city are natural waterways that have existed for millennia. They are part of the watershed linking the headwaters of the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine to Lake Ontario right through our own backyard.  If you live in Scarborough you are lucky — the Rouge Valley is already part of the Greenbelt’s 1.8 million acres of agricultural, rural and environmentally sensitive lands permanently protected from urban development.  From the Bruce Trail to the Niagara Escarpment to the Oak Ridges Moraine, the Greenbelt provides important ecological, economic and social benefits — from locally grown food to recreational areas to natural habitats.  While our river valleys are an important part of that green connection, they have not, until now, been formally recognized as part of the Greenbelt.  This is a golden opportunity for Torontonians to provide stewardship of these lands for generations to come. While the city’s official plan and other policies already provide a high level of protection for the Don and Humber rivers, under the Greenbelt designation they would be protected by another layer of provincial legislation, ensuring that these lands are never used in ways that harm their ecological integrity.  The really good news is there is no cost to pursuing this plan and securing a greener future for Toronto. Through its support, city council will also send an important signal to the province and other GTA municipalities that our ties to the Greenbelt are real and significant.  Torontonians have always felt strongly about preserving our natural environments. We’ve cleaned up our rivers, protected ravines and brought in stricter sewer bylaws and other green initiatives.  Sunday is the fifth anniversary of the Greenbelt.  We could not find a better way to celebrate this anniversary than to help protect the health and ecological features of the Greenbelt by embracing it right in the heart of our city."
