426742,Spiel,2010-01-28 16:10:00,9065,"Ice-fishing derby to have estimated $30K in prizes   January 26, 2010 KEVIN McSHEFFREY / www.elliotlakestandard.ca   Those looking for some heavy-duty outdoor recreation could have their dreams come true at the Fourth Annual CTV Ice-Fishing Derby.  The ice-fishing derby will be held on Horne Lake, and it runs from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Feb. 27.  The entry fee is $100 per hole, and the prizes are enormous. The top prize for the longest fish is half of the amount they take in with the entry fee.  Last year, Edwin Chiblow of Blind River left the derby and his prize was $14,250. In the 2008 derby, an Elliot Lake woman, Cher Palin, won $13,750.  Last year, 290 people entered the event.  The first 250 people to register and pay the fee will be entered into an early bird draw for an Argo 8x8 Frontier 650.  Mark Hutchinson, of the Elliot Lake Masonic Lodge 698, says the prizes will be awarded at the Collins Hall beginning at 4 p.m. on Feb. 27.  He adds this year they are also going to have more door prizes instead of one big one. However, the door prizes are not small. They include a gasoline-powered ice auger, a portable ice hut and a camping package.  ""We're going to be spending the same amount of money as last year (on the door prizes).  ""The idea is to get more people to go home with prizes.""  He hopes to attract 300 ice anglers at this year's event.  Hutchinson says that even with the fishing derby prizes, there will be slightly fewer than last year, but they will be bigger. The derby prizes include a canoe, gasoline-powered ice auger, cordless tools sets and more.  He estimate that the total prize list is worth more than $30,000.  For those who want to munch out on the ice, the new Elliot Lake search and rescue team will host a barbecue lunch.  Hutchinson says the barbecue is a fundraiser for the Elliot Lake search and rescue team.  The activities starts off with a pre-registration event on Friday at the Mason's Lodge at 171 Spruce Avenue at 7 p.m. when the Ministry of Natural Resources will host a seminar on catch and release.  For those with a hardy appetite on Saturday, there will also be a breakfast at the Mason's Lodge from 8 to 10 a.m. The price is a donation, says Hutchinson.  There will also be a spaghetti supper at the Collins Hall following the derby. Tickets for the spaghetti supper are $10 and available at the door or in advance.  There will be a dance at the Collins Hall at 9 p.m. with the music Hotel California, an Eagles tribute band. Entry to the dance is $10.  Participants will be able to park along Highway 108, but this year people will also be able to park at the Centennial Arena.  The tickets to enter the derby are available at the Welcome Centre in the Lester B. Pearson Civic Centre and at the Elliot Lake Trading Post. The Welcome Centre accepts cash, debit cards or major credit cards while the Elliot Lake Trading Post accepts cash only.  Hutchinson recommends those taking part in the derby arrive at Horne Lake by 10 a.m.  The fishing derby is being held by the Elliot Lake Masonic Lodge and the City of Elliot Lake. Local businesses are also helping with the prizes.  Hutchinson says the money raised will go back into the community.  The event is also part of the Elliot Lake Winterfest 2010.
