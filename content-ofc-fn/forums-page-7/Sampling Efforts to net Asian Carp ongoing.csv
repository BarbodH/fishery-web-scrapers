The sampling efforts, initiated on February 17 will include using commercial fishing nets and electro fishing gear in an attempt to locate either silver or bighead Asian carp above the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Electric Fish Barrier System.  The sampling operation will also include the use of commercial fishermen and is scheduled to take place in the CAWS over the next 2-3 weeks.  Sampling crews will concentrate their efforts near warm water discharges created by various industrial operations along the waterway system.   These areas of warm water serve as a place of congregation for fish during the winter when water temperatures drop significantly.
