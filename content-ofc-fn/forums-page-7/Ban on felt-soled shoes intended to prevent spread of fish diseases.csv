The ban is meant to keep nasty fish diseases from creeping into waters on the waders of traveling fishermen.  A proposal to expand the ban from the Southeast region statewide will be considered by the state Board of Fisheries at its March meeting in Anchorage.  Whirling disease is just one communicable fish disease of concern. Didymo, an algae also called rock snot, mud snails and zebra mussels are others that can kill all the fish in a stream. The waters where fly fishermen tend to fish and wade have become a map of the spread of these problems.  They spread by hitchhiking on the bottom of shoes as fishermen tote them between fishing grounds. Felt-bottomed shoes are of particular concern because they tend to stay wet, providing a living habitat for the host to survive away from the infected stream.  Felt-soled waders provide good traction for standing on wet river stones.  The fly fishing industry has been moving away from felt soles on wading boots for several years, because felt is known to facilitate the transport of aquatic invasive species like didymo (rock snot), mud snails, and other nasty things that negatively impact trout fisheries. Simms, for example, has said it will stop manufacturing felt-soled boots after this year, and Trout Unlimited has also asked for tighter anti-felt regulations. Many manufacturers are suggesting that anglers steer clear of felt.  A bill introduced in the Vermont State legislature would actually prohibit the manufacture and sale of felt-soled wading boots."
