As part of implementing the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, the government is seeking public input on:  -- a proposed phosphorus reduction strategy that looks at setting targets and options for reducing loading from all sources around the lake;   -- a study on the feasibility of using water quality trading as a tool to reduce phosphorus: and  -- a discussion paper on regulating shoreline protection.  The documents are posted for comment on the Environmental Registry at www.ontario.ca/environmentalregistry.  The Ministry of the Environment is holding public information sessions in Newmarket on Feb. 17, Barrie on Feb. 22, Uxbridge on Feb. 25 and Ramara on March 3.  The Lake Simcoe Protection Plan's long-term goal is to reduce the phosphorus loading from 72 to 44 tonnes a year to improve water quality.  The Lake Simcoe Protection Plan came into effect in June 2009, following the passage of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008"
