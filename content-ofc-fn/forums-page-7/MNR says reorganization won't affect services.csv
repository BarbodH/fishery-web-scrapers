The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters issued a media release this week stating it is reserving judgment on ""unprecedented realignment"" of several divisions.  It said the Natural Resources Management Division, which houses the fish and wildlife branch, has been eliminated with fish and wildlife responsibilities divided between two new divisions, policy and provincial services.  Jolanta Kowalski, senior media relations officer at the MNR, said all offices remain open and will continue to provide the same range of services.  ""There will be no local impacts. There will no job cuts or relocations,"" Kowalski said in an e-mail. ""Some staff may report to a different manager or see the name of their branch or division change but their duties won't change.""  OFAH executive director Mike Reader said it is ""regrettable that the one branch anglers and hunters most identified with has been splintered. Obviously we are concerned about the marginalization of fish and wildlife, and by extension, fishing and hunting.""  Kowalski said the ministry still has an MNR Fish and Wildlife Services Branch, which includes functions such as Great Lakes management, fish culture and client services.  ""Wildlife and fisheries policy will be handled in the new policy division. This internal realignment will give us a stronger ability to develop and deliver policy, modernize our processes and better co-ordinate the services and operations we provide the public,"" she said."
