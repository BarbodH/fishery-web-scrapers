This weekend, the series's longest running and biggest event, the Canadian Ice Fishing Championship is going to be even bigger.  For its 16th year, the Championship will feature $25,000 in cash and $8,000 in prizes including $10,000 for the first-place team.  ""We're paying out record breaking amounts for perch,"" series organizer Rocky Madsen said.  The basic rules of the championship remain unchanged.  Teams of two are required to register for the two-day competition at the rules meeting tomorrow night at the Sutton Legion.  Saturday morning, all teams must provide their own transportation to a designated one-kilometre zone marked by pylons on the lake, where they can fish from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.  The first-day teams will be allowed one line to catch up to 15 perch for weigh in at the end of the day and on the second day, teams will be allowed two lines to catch trout, ling, pike, whitefish, walleye, or bowfin, which will be scored by on-ice controllers using a point system.  ""We've got it well oiled and running,"" Mr. Madsen said, adding more than 50 teams are already registered and, despite some financial hardships, he expects there could be as many as 30 more.  ""It has been a tough year because of the economy, but we had four times the number of tickets sold for the derby this year than last year; 120,"" Mr. Madsen said and expects many anglers to wait until the last night to register for the championship.  He attributes much of the championships success in tough times to its reputation.  ""The championship is an institution. If you're in it for the money and the recognition and you win this, it's a big feather in your cap,"" Mr. Madsen said.  Still, he took the event's potential even further by working with the province to make use of the $37,500 Celebrate '09 Grant to increase this year's payouts and advertising, especially on American fishing websites, such as Bigfatbass.com  That money will also help fund the all-new spring perch attack May 1.  Mr. Madsen hopes these changes will bring the series to the attention of a younger crowd and help maintain the sport.  ""We've got a lot of young bloods this year. We needed to get some young guys because once they're in, they'll stay,"" he said.  One final addition to this year's championship is the questionnaire being given to anglers to better ascertain the positive economic impact the series has on Georgina, which was estimated at $1 million, just last year.
