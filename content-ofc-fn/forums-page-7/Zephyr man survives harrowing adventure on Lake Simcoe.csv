At about 7 p.m., police got a call from a 69-year-old man who told them he had become lost and disoriented during a heavy winter storm.  William Harrison was fishing several miles northwest of Georgina Island when heavy snow began to fall reducing visibility on the lake, police said.  Mr. Harrison was trying to make his way back to land on his ATV when he became lost. He used a cellphone to call for help and remained in an exact location while he waited for police to arrive.  With the help of Mr. Harrisonâ€™s cellphone service provider, police were able to triangulate his location. He was found about six miles west of Georgina Island and escorted back to shore. Mr. Harrison was uninjured and made his way home.  This incident had a happy ending because Mr. Harrison was prepared, police said. He carried a fully charged cellphone, was dressed for the weather and followed police direction.  If you are going to be outdoors this season, remember to:  "
