And why not? The good people of the area thoroughly enjoy ice fishing – wetting a line in the middle of a frozen ice sheet on a brisk winter's day, sitting beside a pot-bellied stove with a thermos of tea boiling on top and that famous ice hole in the middle of the floor boards. One patiently sits by, ever watchful for that rod to jerk downward and hopeful it's a big one that grabbed the bait.  Well, now you can make it really worthwhile. The Timberfest committee has tagged two fish and if caught during the derby hours, Friday, Feb 12 at 6 p.m. to Sunday, Feb. 14 at 3 p.m., each fish is worth $500 – Go for both and win $1000.  In addition, even if you don't land a tagged fish, prizes of $100 each will be paid out for the largest pike, the largest trout and the largest pickerel. The derby will run on 3 different lakes: Kamaniskeg, Bark or Aylen. However, the tagged fish were only released into Kamaniskeg.  All other fish caught and reported at the weigh-in on Sunday by 3 p.m. at Erika's Bait Shop on Lakeshore Drive are eligible for other prizes – more than 30 and growing. It only costs $10 per person plus button to register and kids under 14 are free. Registration is held at either Palubiski's Variety on Opeongo Line or at Erika's Bait Shop.  So leave the boat at home, jump into the half-ton or car, drive to your favourite fishing spot, drop a line and see what happens. It could be your lucky day! The Farmer's Almanac claims the middle of February are great fishing days. Go for it!"
