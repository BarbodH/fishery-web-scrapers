Stan Howe photo    Three projects that will clean up the waterways at the edge of downtown Barrie mark the half-way point in the federal government’s Lake Simcoe Clean-Up Fund strategy.  Barrie MP Patrick Brown handed over $606,000 Thursday for three projects: Kidd’s Creek watercourse improvements in the Donald and Eccles street area and oil and grit separation devices in the Maple Avenue and Spirit Catcher parking lots.  “Kempenfelt Bay is the jewel at the heart of our city. The purity of its water is something we should not take lightly. Our federal government is not just making promises – we’re delivering real results for Lake Simcoe.”  The $30-million Lake Simcoe Clean-Up Fund is an important part of a $93-million national water strategy, he added. This week’s announcements projects bring the project total to 23, representing $15 million.  “It’s encouraging to notice that at the half-way point, we’ve had such noticeable and tangible improvements to Lake Simcoe, thanks to the partnership with municipalities and most notably, the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority.”  Barrie Coun. Alex Nuttall , a member of the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority board, said the initiative has helped win the conservation authority international recognition for environmental stewardship.  Last week, the authority won the International Riverfoundation’s prestigious Thiess International Riverprize, along with a $350,000 grant.  The conservation authority estimates the projects so far have reduce the amount of phosphorous entering the lake by 15 kg each year, restored 3.5 kilometres of urban and rural stream banks and planted more than 6,500 trees and shrubs."
