398285,Spiel,2009-11-01 10:36:00,9059,"Scugog sinks Port Perry Marina boat launch Township adamant that launch not part of waterfront redevelopment   Oct 22, 2009 Chris Hall / newsdurhamregion.com   PORT PERRY -- Scugog's ambitious plans for a new-look Port Perry waterfront does not include a marina boat launch, councillors told a shoreline business owner on Monday.  Appearing before Scugog's councillors, John Mackey pitched an appeal to Township officials, asking they reconsider their plan to remove the boat launch located beside his Water Street business.  As part of Scugog's massive waterfront redevelopment plan, the municipality is planning to rebuild and extend a lakefront boardwalk along the shores of Lake Scugog -- including a stretch of walkway past the Port Perry Marina and north past the Scugog Memorial Public Library.  During his Oct. 19 deputation, however, Mr. Mackey stressed the importance of a boat launch to his business.  ""A boat launch is critical to the operation of Port Perry Marina,"" said Mr. Mackey, who has leased the marina property from the Township for nearly a quarter century.  Talks between Mr. Mackey and the municipality on a lease extension, for as long as 20 years potentially, are currently underway.  If the Township was to eliminate the marina boat launch, said Mr. Mackey, the waterfront business would have to make some tough decisions regarding its bottom line and customer service.  He noted it would take additional time and/or staff resources to launch and retrieve boats if staff had to travel to the municipal boat launch to the north of the marina. Mr. Mackey also noted having a launch at the marina is handy for boat repairs, snowmobiles in need of fuel and for those renting vessels from Port Perry Marina.  Even Scugog has taken advantage of the marina boat launch in the past, said Mr. Mackey, pointing out the weed harvester hired by the Township made use of the private launch.  ""Surely ... (redevelopment planners) can blend a boat launch at Port Perry Marina in a way that fits into the waterfront development plan,"" said Mr. Mackey.  When asked how the loss of the launch might impact his business, Mr. Mackey said it's unlikely his business would suffer much, but that his operational costs could soar.  ""Eventually, yeah, the customers would have to absorb some of the cost,"" he said.  Mr. Mackey's plea, however, appeared to fall on deaf ears.  Scugog Mayor Marilyn Pearce asked staff if Mr. Mackey was made aware from the start of the waterfront project that his marina business could be impacted.  In response, Gene Chartier, Scugog's commissioner of planning and public works, noted that Mr. Mackey was told the Township may wish to eliminate the boat launch.  Mayor Pearce added that the municipality ""thought you understood"" the direction Scugog was taking when Mr. Mackey moved a portion of his business to the Hwy. 12 corridor.  ""As much as we all want to see your business continue ... there's a new vision for the downtown and it's less industrial,"" she said, adding that an auto parts store on the waterfront should also see the writing on the wall.  ""If we can't come to some sort of an agreement, we may have to look at how to manage a marina. Times have changed for the waterfront,"" said the mayor.  ""As we move forward 20 years and out, we may want a municipal marina that's more fitting for a downtown location,"" she continued. ""We thank you for all you do in the community but I think the vision is going to stay intact.""  A clearly disappointed Mr. Mackey acknowledged the redevelopment plan and noted he embraced the municipality's downtown vision.  When quizzed by Ward 3 Councillor Lynn Philip Hodgson if the Township would provide Mr. Mackey any compensation, Mayor Pearce shot back that exclusive negotiating rights to run the municipal marina ""is pretty good compensation"" and added that such agreements ""should be going out for"" everyone to bid on."
