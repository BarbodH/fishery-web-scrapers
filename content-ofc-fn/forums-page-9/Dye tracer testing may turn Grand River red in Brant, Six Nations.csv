The study is part of a Ministry of the Environment-funded program to assess the vulnerability of municipal drinking water supplies.  The undertaking is known as a ""dye tracer test"" – a common way to determine travel time in watercourses for the protection of the water supply intake.  The tests will involve injecting the dye at three locations over one to two days and the measurement of travel time and dye dilution at downstream locations. The test may appear to turn the watercourses red temporarily where the dye is placed. It will dilute quickly as it moves downstream, eventually becoming invisible. The dye tracer test is one component of a series of water supply source protection studies the GRCA is conducting with Six Nations in support of the Ontario Clean Water Act.
