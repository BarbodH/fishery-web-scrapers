But most environmentalists would agree that there is nothing funny about the degradation of one of this area’s most precious resources, or the resultant endangerment of certain fish and bird species.  The good news is that the river, and, in particular, a Downriver portion of it, appears to be on the rebound.  Recent research reveals that the Detroit River has experienced substantial improvement of environmental quality over the past 35 years that has resulted in dramatic improvements in the local fishery.  Scientists have documented the recovery of walleye from crisis levels in the 1970s and a return of lake sturgeon and lake whitefish to the river after several decades of absence.  American and Canadian research and monitoring under the Huron-Erie Corridor Initiative has shown that, in general, environmental pollution is no longer limiting the fishery and that lack of proper spawning habitat is now the factor most limiting fish productivity.  Scientists and managers are now able to restore habitat that was historically lost through building and dredging of shipping channels, and lost through waterfront developments.  BASF Corp., a worldwide chemical company with a plant in Wyandotte, recently constructed nearly an acre of habitat for walleye, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and lake sturgeon in the Trenton Channel near the company’s Riverview property.  In the spring, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Geological Survey fishery biologists collected walleye and lake sturgeon in spawning-ready condition at this new habitat site.  Biologists say the lake sturgeon, a remnant of the dinosaur age, is a key indicator of ecosystem health and is considered a keystone species by scientists and fishery managers. Monitoring will continue to track fishery use and reproductive success at this site in the future.  Last year, BASF completed an environmental remediation project at this property in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The project laid the foundation for the fish habitat restoration in the Trenton Channel of the Detroit River.  The Detroit River and Lake Erie are considered to be the walleye capital of the world. It is estimated that walleye fishing brings in more than $1 million each spring to the Downriver economy and walleye fishing tournaments on the Detroit River have offered more than $500,000 in prize money.  In one notable event, FLW Outdoors has held the Chevy Open bass tournament on the Detroit River and offered $1.5 million in prize money and resulted in bringing in between $4 million and $5 million to the Detroit metropolitan area.  “This fish habitat restoration is the culmination of over 35 years of pollution- prevention and -control programs that is helping to enhance and sustain our internationally recognized fishery,” U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-15th District) said.  “This is truly significant for our region because it supports the vital Michigan tourism economy, encourages further outdoor recreation, and helps our businesses attract and retain the next generation of employees by improving quality of life.”  J.D. Purvis, general manager of BASF’s Wyandotte site, said the company is proud of its long-term record of environmental protection, social responsibility and economic success.  “This fish habitat restoration project in the Trenton Channel of the Detroit River supports our commitment to protecting the environment and quality of life for the community, and to fostering economic vitality in the Downriver area,” Purvis said.  The Detroit River holds the distinction of being part of North America’s only International Wildlife Refuge and only international heritage river system."
