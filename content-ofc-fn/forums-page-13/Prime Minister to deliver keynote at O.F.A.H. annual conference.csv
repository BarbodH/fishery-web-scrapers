303828,TJQ,2009-02-09 16:53:00,7805,"The Ontario  Federation of Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.) is pleased to announce  that the Right Honourable Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada,  will deliver the keynote address at the 81st O.F.A.H. Annual  General Meeting and Fish & Wildlife Conference in Mississauga. ""We are delighted  that Prime Minister Harper has accepted an invitation to speak at our  annual conference,"" said O.F.A.H. Executive Director Mike Reader.  ""O.F.A.H. members represent a broad cross-section of the outdoor community.  We look forward to hearing from the Prime Minister on a number of key  issues of interest and concern to our delegates.""  The O.F.A.H.  Annual General Meeting and Fish & Wildlife Conference, will be held  March 19-21, 2009 at the Delta Meadowvale Resort in Mississauga, and  will draw hundreds of attendees. The agenda includes a variety of speakers  covering such timely issues as the provincial moose program review,  hydro power, and the youth demographics of angling and hunting. The  conference culminates in an awards banquet on the Saturday evening,  at which the Prime Minister will speak.   The Conservative  platform includes scrapping the long-gun registry and overhauling Canada's  justice system, putting more police on the streets and increased security  at the border. Harper believes, as do many O.F.A.H. members, that law-abiding  firearms owners are not a threat to national security, and that billons  of taxpayers' dollars have been wasted on the gun registry. The Federation  supports Mr. Harper's plan to scrap the registry and redirect the  money to addressing the illegal trade in firearms that is smuggling  guns into the country for the sole purpose of committing crimes.  This will be  the second time Mr. Harper has addressed Federation members. While leader  of the opposition in 2005, he delivered the keynote at the annual conference.   Stephen Harper was first elected Canada's 22nd Prime Minister in February,  2006. He was reelected for a second term in October, 2008.  The 81st  O.F.A.H. Annual General Meeting and Fish & Wildlife Conference is  open to the public. Delegates may register online at www.ofah.org/conference  or by calling 705-748-6324 ext 230.  With over 100,000  members, subscribers and supporters, and 655 member clubs, the O.F.A.H.  is the largest nonprofit, charitable, fishing, hunting and conservation-based  organization in Ontario, and the voice of anglers and hunters.
