The Beeton couple swept the CIFC in unprecedented fashion, winning the Georgina Cup and the $5,508 first prize, as well as the mixed doubles title and the individual top angler awards for the men (the Cliff Perry Award) and women (the Jean Power Memorial), plus the big fish honours.  The Adragnas figured they were out of the running, then struck the day two piscatorial bonanza five miles out from Bonnie Boats.  The couple, who fish together occasionally, weren’t even paired up for the CIFC, but Joe’s partner bowed out at the last minute and he was “stuck” with Darlene.  “I had to  give her a crash course,” he said laughing.  She didn’t need the instruction, hauling out the biggest whitefish of the day — a monster 31-incher — to claim the John Redding Trophy, while Joe pulled out a lunker 35-inch lake trout to win the Dan Perry Trophy.  Joe also won the Perry hardware in 2001, but he hadn’t fished the CIFC in three years before this past weekend.  The couple hauled in four whities, two lakers and a ling on day two.  The awards were handed out Sunday night at the Lionshead Resort in Jackson’s Point by CIFC organizer Rocky Madsen and Georgina Mayor Rob Grossi, who praised Madsen’s efforts and emphasized the importance of ice fishing to Georgina and Lake Simcoe.  Madsen said he was delighted with how smoothly the event went this year, with 60 two-person teams taking to the ice.  Georgina angler and CIFC alumni organizer Bill Hirstwood, with partner Ken Tamblyn from Stouffville, jumped into the lead Saturday with a limit of 15 perch weighing in at a hefty 11.02 pounds, well ahead of past champs Norm and Mike Burden, but day two in deep water saw two whities slip off the hook. The pair had to settle for fourth place overall.  David Hamilton and Mike Levesque claimed second place, while last year’s champs, Jeff Bell and Mike Joyce, fished their way to third spot.  Rules night Friday saw the prestigious Bill Bond Trophy awarded to long-time organizer Paul Nicholls for his outstanding contributions to the sport over the years. Past winner Ken Hackenbrook made the presentation.  The annual CIFC is the second in the new Georgina Fishing Series organized by Madsen. The Great Georgina Fishing Derby, a two-week lake-wide tourney, finished up Feb. 15. Mike Riendeau won the $500 first prize in the lake trout category, with CIFC founding member Mike Burrows finishing second. Ron Josephson claimed the cash in the whitefish category, while Tom Shearer was top dog for perch.  Next up is the Perch Attack March 8.
