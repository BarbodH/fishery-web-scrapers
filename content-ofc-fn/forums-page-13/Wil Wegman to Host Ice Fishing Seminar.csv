Wegman, who won the 2006 Perch Trap Attack on Simcoe was also a member of Team Canada at the World Ice Fishing Championships in 1991. He has been teaching ice fishing courses at Seneca College since 1987 and for many years has presented his popular ice fishing seminars from Sudbury to Toronto and from Hamilton to Ottawa.  Wegman is excited about his seminar at the International Centre. â€œ I’m especially happy that Lowrance Electronics rep Gerry Heels will accompany me and offer anglers some incredible insight into the Lowrance Units used for ice fishing. He will be sure to offer some great tips on how to maximize their performance during the winter. This will also be the first time we have had the opportunity to host one of the presentations in the special seminar rooms thanks to Show organizers Andy and Vita Pallottaâ€.  Wegman’s power point presentation will focus on ice fishing Lake Simcoe with particular emphasis on how to catch more yellow perch, northern pike, whitefish and lake trout during the winter. â€œLake Simcoe is a huge body of water and receives more fishing pressure than any other inland lake in the province. With all that hard water and all those other ice anglers, it can be a daunting lake to try and figure out. I hope ice anglers walk away from the evening having learned a thing or two to help them understand the lake and its fish a little more,â€ he said.  With that knowledge and the tips and tricks Wegman will reveal on how to catch those fish … ice anglers of all skill levels are sure to find the evening both entertaining and rewarding.  Draw Prizes will be offered courtesy of HT Enterprises, Rapala/Normark, Berkley/Pure Fishing and Lowrance. Gerry Heels, a Lowrance Electronics rep will be on hand to answer questions about their sonar units.   Cost of admission to the Master Angler Ice Fishing Seminar is $12.00 and includes entry to the Spring Fishing & Boat Show.  For more details on the Show www.springfishingandboatshow.com"
