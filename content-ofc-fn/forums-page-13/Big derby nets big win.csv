The Espanola Game & Fish Protective Association, commonly called the fish and game club, has come out on top at a zone level and is in the running for recognition at the provincial level.  The Ontario Association of Anglers and Hunters presents an award every year for the ‘best’ club in Ontario, and Espanola could claim the honour as its own next month.  Espanola Club President Leonard Houle proudly received the OFAH Zone D award, which honours the club that does the most for conservation each year, at the zone meeting held just over a week ago.  “The Espanola club, whose territory stretches from Batchewana Bay to Mattawa and Honey Harbour to Chapleau, has won the district award three times,” said Houle. “The victory puts the club in contention for the provincial version of the award.  “Espanola won that one about 15 years ago and I would love to see us win it once again. We won’t know until the provincial conference in March, but we are excited to be in contention.”  He added the club’s biggest projects in 2008 included a revamp of the shooting range, the Marble Eyes fishing derby in May and the First Annual Children’s Fishing Derby, which attracted enough kids and adults to be recognized as the largest kids ice fishing tournament in Ontario.  The Second Annual Children’s Fishing Derby is all set to go this Saturday at the Anishinabe Centre on Anderson Lake, according to chair Rosalind Raby.  “The volunteers have really come together well and everything is falling into place,” said Raby. “I’m just thrilled to hear about the district award, and especially the news that we hosted the largest children’s fishing derby in the province last year. That’s fantastic.  “We certainly hope to repeat this Saturday, February 14.”  Raby co-chaired the derby last year. This year, she is co-chairing once again with Jean Gauvin. Leland Morley also sits on the committee, but Raby emphasizes there are plenty of other helping hands.  Several club members are assisting in so many ways; parking, setup, cooking, you name it, we have someone to help. And, the volunteers from the larger community have also come forward, so the enthusiasm is definitely there to repeat our success of last year, but this time, not cleaning out the town of every hotdog and hamburger to be found,” chuckled Raby. “All kidding aside, we couldn’t do this without them.”  Local businesses are also helping out in a big way. Several of the food chains are donating the food items, while other businesses, big and small, donate to the prize board for the children.  “We can’t say enough about all the business support, it’s awesome.”  There are some nice prizes this year, including a grand prize, a ‘Friday Family Sleepover’ at the Espanola Mill House Bed & Breakfast, for up to six people, thanks to B&B owner, Jewel Hobbs.  Parking will be available along the road, but participants will be encouraged to only park on one side, as recommended by the volunteers, to ensure safety. Snowmobilers can bring their snow machines, but only to get on the ice, added Raby.  “We want people to be able to access the derby. For some, driving a vehicle is out of the question, but they can bring their machine down. The only thing we’re asking is that it be parked during the derby in order to ensure the safety of the youngsters. Trail wardens will also be on site.”  The parking lot near the main lodge will be barricaded with only volunteers and people accessing the lodge being allowed through. Volunteers will be wearing bright, orange safety vests and be equipped with walkie-talkies to assist the public.  Registration opens at 10:00 pm with the derby running from 11:00 am until 3:00 pm. Prizes will be distributed on site.  Hotdogs, hamburgers and drinks will be available. The children (16 and older is considered an adult) will receive a free hotdog or hamburger, drink and loot bag. For adults, hotdogs and drinks will sell for $1, hamburger for $2 with the money raised (after costs) going towards fish planting programs in the local area.  “I hope to literally see hundreds of families come out and take part in Ontario’s Family Fishing Weekend. You don’t need a licence to fish throughout the weekend, so why not come out, drop a line and maybe you will be the one catching that elusive ‘big one’, added Raby.
