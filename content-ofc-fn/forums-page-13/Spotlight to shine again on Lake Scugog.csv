Dubbed Give The Lake A Break, the open house is a partnership between Scugog and the Kawartha Conservation Authority. It will be held at the Scugog Community Centre on March 27 and 28.  The first day of the event will focus on youth education, with hopes that schools will take in the open house. There will also be a marketplace held throughout the day.  On the evening of March 27, there will be a 7 p.m. presentation by the Muskoka Wildlife Centre, which will feature a variety of live animals for youth to check out.  ""It's a great way to teach kids... about all the wildlife that exists in our community,"" said Scugog Mayor Marilyn Pearce.  It's expected that animals such as skunks and porcupines will be on hand.  The second day of the open house will see a marketplace set up once again, along with a variety of presentations related to Lake Scugog and its health.  Gene Chartier, Scugog's commissioner of planning and public works, is slated to speak on March 28 around noon where he will give an update on the Township's plans to rejuvenate Port Perry's waterfront.  The open house follows the Lake Scugog Summit hosted last spring by the Township, but is less formal and with fewer speakers, said the mayor.  ""It's a great chance to hear some good speakers and visit the marketplace,"" she said.  The Scugog Community Centre is located at 1655 Reach St."
