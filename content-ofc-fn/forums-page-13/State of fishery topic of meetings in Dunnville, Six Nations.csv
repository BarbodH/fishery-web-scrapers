Thursday, March 5 at the Dunnville District Hunters and Anglers Club House, 237 McLauglin Side Road, Dunnville (Originally scheduled for Feb. 16 but postponed due to flooding.) Wednesday, March 18 at the Six Nations Tourism Center, 2498 Chiefswood Rd., Ohsweken The meetings, which will run from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. will outline the work that has been done to implement the Grand River Fisheries Management Plan and give those attending an opportunity to talk about future directions for the fishery.  Over the past 10 years the Grand River system has enjoyed a rebirth as a great place for anglers. Much of the improvement has come about as a result of the implementation of the recommendations of the plan. It was released in 1998 by the GRCA and the Ministry of Natural Resources after extensive consultation with anglers, fishing groups and residents of the Grand River watershed.  The meeting will include these presentations:  - Overview of the Grand River Fisheries Management Plan - MNR projects in the Lower Grand - Volunteer projects in the Lower Grand - Water quality conditions - Management of the GRCA reservoir system  In addition to the presentations, there will be a variety of displays on fishery and environmental issues.  More information on the plan and the Grand River fishery is available in the Fisheries section of the GRCA website.  These meetings are part of a series of five to take information to the public and gather comments on the 10th anniversary of the fishery plan. Earlier meetings were held in Elora, Cambridge and Dunnville."
