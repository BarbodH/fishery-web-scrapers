The Ministry of Natural Resources issued a press release last week outlining the rules and regulations governing ice huts, most notably the fact that they must be removed by March 15.  Anglers are also being asked to ensure that their hut is registered with the Province by calling (905) 713-7400.  Once registered, a hut can be used anywhere in Ontario."
