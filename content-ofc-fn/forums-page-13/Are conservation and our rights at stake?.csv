February 19th, 2009 Alf Beck / Pembroke Daily Observer   How do federal and provincial economic stimulus packages seriously threaten aquatic life forms and our inherent Canadian birthright? Read on.  The federal government has now introduced its proposed amendments to the Navigable Waters  Protection Act (NWPA), camouflaged in a 551-page omnibus bill, Bill C-10, the “2009 Budget Implementation Act”.  The gist of these amendments is:  a) The current protection of the inherent Canadian birthright to free and unimpeded navigation on navigable waters would be literally abrogated and it would be up to the minister of transport exclusive prerogative to determine whether any proposed construction project at, in, under or over a water body “significantly interferes” with navigation. The definition of a “significant interference” is not identified.  Would any construction on Canada’s hundreds of smaller rivers, used chiefly by hunters, anglers and whitewater enthusiasts, be deemed a “significant interference”?  Unlikely.  John Baird, Minister of Transport, is quoted already in a prominent newspaper, saying that the requirement for a “federal” environmental assessment prior to a proposed project would be lifted, following a “provincial” environmental assessment and “do away with too much red tape”.  This would give just about every proponent wanting to dredge, fill-in, or install in-stream electrical generators in “navigable” waters the green light at Ontario’s already identified 500 sites, to alter and destroy fish spawning habitat and habitat of many other aquatic life forms.  Why would that be, given that there are still “provincial’ environmental assessments?  Read on.  The Ontario government is almost ready to introduce its “Green Energy Act”.  As George Smitherman already explained on CBC radio recently, he intends to introduce legislation which would preclude any delays caused by environmentalists and conservationists interventions or possible municipal authority denying required zoning changes in the approval process of “green energy’ proposals, which could include everything from wind turbines to “in-stream’ electrical generators.  It appears obvious how the “federal” 2009 Budget Implementation Act with its camouflaged NWPA amendments and Mr. Smitherman’s proposed legislation would dovetail well enough to facilitate a streamlined approval process for proposals which place aquatic life forms in peril and, at the same time, abrogate our Canadian inherent birthright to free and unimpeded navigation on what still are “navigable waters”.  It is feared, that Mr. Smitherman’s proposed legislation may stifle, if not override municipal authority to grant rezoning and issue building permits for “green energy” proposals. And all this could be included in Ontario’s “Green Energy Act” to satisfy Ontario’s obsession with “green energy”.  The worst part of all this is that it can occur with little or no public consultation; more or less in secrecy until bulldozers arrive at a site.  Do you really want to let things go that far without a chance for input?  Let’s not be misunderstood. Most of us favour alternate “green” energy sources and most of us would agree to improve impractical laws, making them more user friendly.  But not at any cost! Whatever the outcome, the public must be given the opportunity for input prior to approving environment-altering projects and abrogation of our inherent birthrights.  In case you are satisfied with being unable to water access your favourite hunting and fishing area because of industrial obstructions to your water access, and if you don’t care about impacts on fish and other water creatures habitat through transforming them into cement-ditches, then things are fine for you.  However, if you are not complacent and want your inherent navigation rights protected and fish spawning areas conserved … do something!  Express your concerns to our MP Cheryl Gallant and MPP John Yakabuski.  Their phone numbers and addresses are in your telephone directory.  It’s “five minutes before midnight” my friends."
