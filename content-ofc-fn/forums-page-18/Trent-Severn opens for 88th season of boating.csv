202874,Spiel,2008-05-17 14:13:00,9065,"Trent-Severn opens for 88th season of boating   May 16, 2008 Ernest Kuglin / Trenton Trentonian   Locks along the 386-kilometre Trent Severn Waterway opened for navigation Friday morning.  It’s the 88th opening of the waterway that stretches from the mouth of the Trent River in Trenton to Georgian Bay. The May long weekend is the traditional opening of the system.  With recent flooding and extremely high water levels of reservoir lakes in Haliburton and Kawartha regions, Trent Severn officials were initially concerned the traditional opening date would be delayed.  â€œBut mother nature has been extremely kind to us in the past several weeks,’’ said Mike Jamieson, assistant director of canal operations.  Trent Severn officials will be keeping a close eye on weather conditions of the long weekend and the coming weeks.  Jamieson said reservoir lakes are filled to capacity and do not have much storage capacity.  Flow rates have been reduced along the entire system and the Trent River section of the waterway.  â€œWe’re fine tuning the system and we are urging mariners to use caution because water levels are still high,’’ said Jamieson.  Due to high water levels and fast lows generated by a deep snow pack and heavy spring rains, maintenance crews have been unable to locate the position and placement of floating navigational aids across the entire system.  Jamieson said Parks Canada maintenance crews will be working throughout the weekend and the next several weeks to get channel markers and other navigational aids back in place.  Jamieson said areas above and below water control dams should be avoided due to strong currents. Navigational buoys, he said, may be out of position or partially submerged.  â€œWe asking mariners to report any hazards in the navigation channel or aids that are out of charted position to Parks Canada or to the Canadian Coast Guard Traffic Centre in Sarnia,’’ said Jamieson.  Otherwise the waterway is in good shape for the new boating season.  â€œIt’s taken a lot of work since the major flooding along the system to get the waterway in shape for the opening weekend,’’ said Jamieson.  â€œWe’re always very excited about the opening weekend. It’s a tradition in Central Ontario and there are a lot of businesses along the waterway that depend on the Trent Severn.’’  The Murray Canal, meanwhile, will remain closed until the end of June due to continuing reconstruction work on the Carrying Place swing bridge, on Loyalist Parkway, Hwy. 33. The canal, also operated by Parks Canada, connects Lake Ontario with the Bay of Quinte,  The 2008 boating season marks the 175th anniversary of the waterway. The first lock was constructed near the town of Bobcaygeon in 1833.  Special events will be held June 6-8. For more information on the celebrations go to www.tswborninbobcaygeon.org"
