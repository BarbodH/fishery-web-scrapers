A total of 845 of these specially developed trout were part of the first group of this strain of fish to be released through the North Hastings Community Fish Hatchery.  The project started in 2006 with small amount of eggs that were collected from Ashby Lake, then incubated and treated at the Haliburton Fish Hatchery until they could be released into the local waters. From there, the trout have grown up under extensive supervision and development at the Haliburton Highlands Fish Hatchery to get to the strength necessary for release.  This project will soon be moving to the North Hastings area, with the development of the North Hastings Community Fish Hatchery located on Hysert Road in the Township of Dungannon. According to Dennis LeFeuvre, President of the North Hastings Community Fish Hatchery, the hatchery is nearing completion.  “We are looking to have everything done by this summer,” said LeFeuvre, “We are just waiting to start pouring the concrete and getting the pump systems in right now.” According to LeFeuvre, due to this year’s harsh winter, the construction of the hatchery proved to be difficult, but he is looking forward to movement of the North Hastings Jewel Trout stock to the area.  Though this was a big day for all of those involved with this project, it was also a day of celebration for the community. For the many in attendance, this marked a new day for the waters of the North Hastings area.  Due to climate change and other environmental concerns that are restricting the amount of fish in the area’s lakes, projects like the Hatchery contribute to the strength of the community’s economy that relies in large part to attracting anglers from across the nation.  “This is not only good for the fisherman,” said LeFeuvre, “But it is also good for the local economy with more people being attracted to the lakes again.”  Mayor of Hastings Highlands and Warden of Hastings County Ron Emond said it was an important day for the North Hastings community. “We have all have been waiting for this release,” said Emond, “It is important for the future generations in the area.”  Jim Anderton, a resident of L’Amable Lake, was thrilled to see the lake being replenished with fish. Since his arrival at the lake in 1974, Anderton has seen a drop in the traffic around the area, in particular anglers, and sees this project as being a benefit to the area.  “Once you start stocking the lakes again, we will see more people on the lakes,” said Anderton.  Dave Flowers from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has already seen the benefit of hatchery projects in the Haliburton community. Flowers has worked closely with the North Hastings hatchery project in the raising of these fish in Haliburton. Flowers said that the North Hastings Fish Hatchery project is a perfect example of the community getting behind a beneficial project.  “When it’s the right thing to do, it’s the right thing to do,” said Flowers.  This was part of the motivation for Jack Jackson, a member of the Haliburton Highlands Outdoor Association’s Lake Trout Project. Jackson sees projects like this as something a community can get behind, and important to the health of the local waters in the area.  “I have grandchildren who like to fish,” said Jackson, “There could be huge disaster out there if we don’t do something.”  The benefit of future generations of anglers was been a focal point for the day, as the children in attendance were encouraged to take part in the ceremonies by dumping the fish into the water with the help of those involved in the project.  And this is just the beginning of the large replenishing project according to organizers of the hatchery. Currently, there are more fish in Haliburton getting ready move into their new homes in lakes in the North Hastings community.  Flowers said that MNR Biologist Erin MacDonald carefully selects the lakes, in order to insure that the waters are ready for the increase in fish population.  “We made the first big step today,” said an excited LeFeuvre who only had one word to describe this first release. “Great.”"
