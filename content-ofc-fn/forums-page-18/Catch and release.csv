The goal of this tournament is to educate young anglers about competitive sport fishing in a fun environment, surrounded by family and friends, while creating memories that will last a lifetime.  Tournament Director Guy Myre (of Sudbury Cycle & Marine) explains that each team  consists of one adult angler and two young anglers, 17 and under.  The event includes an official weigh-in, prizes, awards and BBQ to follow a hard dayâ€™s fishing. The winner of each regional tournament qualifies for the opportunity to participate in the National Championship.  The AYA Walleye Championship began in 1998 when tournament founder, Andrew Klopak decided he wanted to fish in a competitive style (catch and release) tournament on opening day with his son.  Seeing that there were no tournaments catering to adult and young anglers, he created his own. The success of this original Manitoba tournament has lead to expansion across North America.  The Sudbury AYA tournament takes place Sunday, May 25 in Massey (lower Spanish River), with the grand prize a Lund Boat Package.
