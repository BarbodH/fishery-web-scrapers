The system, which experienced severe flooding during the spring runoff, is scheduled to open to boaters May 16.  But the water level on Lake Simcoe is still 15 centimetres above where it should be this time of year, said Mike Jamieson, assistant director of canal operations.  The excess water pouring over dams and surging through valves in the locks is causing hazardous currents and submerging docking platforms below some locks, said Jamieson.  If water levels don't drop enough to slow currents, the system will have to be closed to boaters until navigation is safe, said Jamieson.  ""On Monday, we'll take a long, hard look at the system.""  System operators have been trying to reduce levels in Lake Simcoe since January, when record-high temperatures and the resulting thaw resulted in elevated water levels.  Normally, Lake Simcoe is drawn down in the fall to accommodate the spring runoff, but all that capacity was lost this year and there was major flooding, particularly when the Black River crested.  With rivers and lakes still high, further flooding remains a possibility, said Jamieson, adding a key factor is the amount of rainfall in the next few weeks.  Things looked good until this past weekend, when some parts of the watershed received 35 millimetres of rain, said Jamieson.  When currents are excessive, boats, especially in the hands of inexperienced operators, can be hard to control, said Jamieson.  There is the risk of damage from collisions with other boats or docking facilities, he said."
