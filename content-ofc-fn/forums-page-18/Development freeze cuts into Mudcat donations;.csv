Her pursuit has taken on a degree of urgency because so far only about $10,000 is on the books. Most cheques are for less than $1,000 and it will take between $35,000 and $40,000 to run the famous event from June 4 to June 8. Presented by Kerr Boom Pyrotechnics, Saturday's famous fireworks show will cost $10,000.  ""Without sponsorship, there's no festival,"" said Chymko. ""Everything is booked. Hopefully we don't run in the red.""  This year's donation drought is directly related to a development freeze due to unresolved land claims, she noted. When she contacted some development and contracting corporations which made generous donations in previous years, owners expressed their regrets.  ""It's not their fault. Their hands are tied,"" said Chymko.  They told her to thank Haldimand County and the natives.  Wal-Mart property owner Calloway REIT provided a donation last year and planned to do the same this year but could not, she told The Chronicle. There's no TSC store and little or no income for many in the construction business.  ""So it's a huge loss for the festival,"" said Chymko.  Determined to pay the bills, she will hold whatever fundraisers she can to compensate for the loss.  ""I'm counting on our community for their support,"" she continued. ""I'm anticipating over the five-day festival that 50,000 people will be coming to our town and county. We have to pull this off.""  While finding this situation a little bit scary, she hoped for the best. ""Dunnville always sticks together,"" Chymko said.  People can show their support at the June 1 festival kickoff party at Johnny Rotten's. For the $5 cover charge, they can party to the tunes of Steel Country and The Bareback Riders between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. Both bands will play at the Bavarian Gardens on June 7, the festival's Saturday.  Another key annual fundraiser, the Mudcat Celebrity Golf Tournament, will be held on June 14 with tee off at 9 a.m. at Freedom Oaks Golf Club. Proceeds will go toward fireworks.  As event coordinator and president of the Dunnville Chamber of Commerce she wanted to make the county aware that not just Caledonia is suffering. Her letter to council was discussed at the May 12 council meeting.  In it, she reported a significant drop in financial support. Both a local construction company and commercial builder gave $1,000 last year but could provide nothing for the 2008 festival. Smaller businesses have cut back their donations or were unable to contribute, she reported.  ""Our community is now suffering directly and Dunnville has not received any offsetting funding as have other areas in Haldimand,"" she said.  Chymko asked council to convey the chamber's concerns to appropriate provincial and federal agencies that might be able to provide financial support to the county and specifically to Dunnville.  It's quite apparent there's been a negative fall-out of land claims issues impacting Dunnville,"" said Coun. Lorne Boyko.  In Caledonia, business donations reduced significantly because of impacts related to land claim issues, he noted.  ""It's taken two years but it's hit Dunnville as well,"" he added.  On Monday night, he wrote a motion that was seconded by Coun. Don Ricker and supported unanimously by their colleagues. As a result, the Chamber's letter will be sent to Premier Dalton McGuinty, Ontario Aboriginal Affairs Minister Michael Bryant, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada Minister Chuck Strahl, Ontario chief negotiator Murray Coolican, federal negotiator Monique Dorin, and the Ministers of Municipal Affairs and Recreation and Tourism.  Anyone wishing to make a donation to the festival can drop by the Chamber office on Chestnut Street from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Friday or by mail at P.O Box 124, Dunnville ON, N1A 2X1."
