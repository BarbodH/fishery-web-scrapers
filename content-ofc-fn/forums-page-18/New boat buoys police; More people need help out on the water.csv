Barrie city police has a brand spanking new, 27-foot patrol boat that can be used in all kinds of weather and marine conditions.  It begins patrols this Victoria Day weekend and, with the existing police vessel, means a police boat can be on the water 10 hours a day, seven days a week.  Barrie police Chief Wayne Frechette said the new craft's main function is search and rescue, and in the worst weather if needed.  ""When we are really in demand is when it's not fit for man or beast (on the water),"" he said. ""But we have to go out.""  Frechette mentioned a day last summer when a sudden thunderstorm stranded boaters on the bay, and dumped windsurfers, kayakers and canoeists into it.  Officers had a difficult time getting to everyone who needed help because their boat, on long-term loan from the RCMP, is more like a pleasure craft than a rescue boat.  That won't be a problem with the new police boat. From Barrie Marina it should be able to respond to most calls in 15 minutes. Being able to reach speeds of 55-65 km/h won't hurt either.  The new boat also has a hoist for lifting stretchers, a heated cabin and side doors to better load and unload equipment.  Frechette noted that while the OPP has a boat, city police must be on the water, as well. The regulations changed a half-dozen years ago.  ""Waterways within a municipality's boundaries are the responsibility of the local police,"" he said. ""We inherited Kempenfelt Bay.""  City police also have an inflatable craft, and last summer used two personal watercraft donated by a local company, a deal police hope to have this summer too. These vessels allow officers to go ashore quickly, if needed.  Sgt. Dave Goodbrand said the new boat will have other uses besides search and rescue on the bay. Boats can be checked to ensure they have all the required safety equipment, including life-jackets, and that liquor laws are enforced.  ""It's no different on the water than on the roads,"" he said. ""All these steps have to be taken so that Kempenfelt Bay is safe.""  The new police vessel was custom made by Stanley Boats in Parry Sound, and cost $132,000 full-loaded with equipment such as radar, sonar, a global positioning system and radios. Adding taxes and a trailer brings the total to $150,000.  The money came from a police surplus, money saved on salaries when police officers - or their spouses - take maternity or paternity leave.  Frechette said normal maintenance on the boat can be done by police employees, in-house, and that the vessel easily has a life span of 20 years.  It has twin Honda 150-horsepower outboard engines, which Frechette says are easy to maintain or replace.  The boat will employ officers from the schools unit, who are away from those duties in June, July and August."
