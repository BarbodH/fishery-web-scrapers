Children of all ages are getting their fishing tackle ready for fun at The Varney Pond Fishing Derby this weekend.  Open to children 14 and under and hosted by the Durham Activity Centre.  This will take place on Varney Pond this Saturday and Sunday (May 17-18) from 8 am to 1 pm. There is a registration fee of $8 which will place each participant in the running for various prizes including a Nintendo Wii game on Saturday and an ipod on Sunday. Adults and older youth can participate if they are accompanying an angler under 14 but are not eligible for any prizes. Families should plan to bring their own rods and reels to try their luck with over 500 stocked rainbow trout ranging from 1 to 5 lbs.  The Varney Pond Fishing Derby is part of an exciting grassroots program to encourage youngsters to enjoy the benefits of recreational fishing.  It is sponsored by The Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority, CIBC, Durham Legion, Henderson Paddon & Associates Engineering, Hanover Rotary Club, Co-operators, Bass Pro Shop, McDonalds Restaurants, Durham Activity Centre, Fishing Forever, Kids Cops and Canadian Tire Fishing days, the West Grey Police Service, Canadian Tire, the Police Association of Ontario and many other local regional businesses.  According to Real Fishing's Bob Izumi, spokesperson for Fishing Forever, it makes sense that West Grey Police Officers are involved with such an event. ""Children look up to those in uniform and in turn the officers spend their entire career teaching and protecting children,"" states Izumi. ""The Varney Pond Derby is a perfect way for kids to learn that these dedicated men and women care about them as individuals."" Bob Izumi is continuing his late father Joe's tradition of using recreational fishing as a way to bring families closer and teach important life lessons to children."
