Randy Cada, 55, and Ray Morningstar, 53, both received a lake sturgeon fishing prohibition for the Mississagi River and within one kilometre of the mouth of the Mississagi River on the northshore of Lake Huron.  Gerry Jackpine, 62, received a lake sturgeon fishing prohibition for commercially fishing in the same waters.  Court heard that in June and July of 2005, the men sold lake sturgeon that were caught in the Mississagi River to a local fish market.  The Mississagi First Nation is the holder of an Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licence and is permitted to fish commercially on the northshore of Lake Huron, but not in the Mississagi River. The ministry was able to undertake the investigation with the help of the Mississagi First Nation, who wished to ensure the protection of the resource.  Justice of the Peace James Bubba heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Blind River, on April 28, 2008. The court expressed concerns over the fishing of lake sturgeon on the Mississagi River during sturgeon spawning season.
