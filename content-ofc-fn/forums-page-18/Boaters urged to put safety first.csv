Whether planning a day of fishing or a week of back-country canoeing, the Ontario Conservation Officers Association (OCOA) is reminding the public to put safety first.  North American Safe boating Awareness Week takes place from May 17 to 23 and the OCOA supports the efforts of the Canadian Safe Boating Council in promoting safe boating practices on Ontario waters.  Conservation officers spend a lot of time on the water, conducting checks on thousands of anglers every summer. They also enforce Small Vessel Regulations under the Canada Shipping Act, and play an important role in the safety of boaters.  “While our officers don’t focus primarily on boating safety enforcement, we do encounter many serious safety violations,” said OCOA president and conservation officer Dan VanExan, in a news release. “Many of these unsafe situations could be prevented by boaters taking the time to properly equip and safely operate their vessels.”  OCOA tips for safe boating:  Wear a life-jacket: - Life-jackets save lives, but they must be worn to work. - It is the law to have enough life-jackets or personal flotation devices on-board for each passenger. - Make sure personal flotation devices are in good condition and fit properly.  Don’t drink and boat: - It is illegal and dangerous to drink alcohol on a vessel unless a boat is equipped with sleeping, cooking, and washroom facilities and the boat is anchored. - Never operate a vessel after consuming alcohol.  Be prepared: - Be familiar with the operation of a boat and know its limitations for passengers and gear. - Check to ensure mandatory safety equipment is on-board and is in good condition. - Keep an eye on the weather. Know when it may not be safe to go out on the water and be aware of changing conditions.  “By following this important advice, boaters will be able to safely enjoy their time on the water this summer,” said VanExan in the release. “Our officers look forward to an accident-free summer.”  For more information about boating safety, visit the Canadian Safe Boating Council website at www.csbc.ca.
