OPP say the two, a 39-year old father and his 11-year old son, of Beachville, east of London, had been fishing when the canoe turned over. Fortunately, OPP say the pair were wearing personal floatation devices, and, with the assistance of other boaters in the area, were rescued and transported to Soldiers' Memorial Hospital in Orillia by paramedics for the treatment of non-life threatening injuries.  The water temperature was cold and without the assistance of the boaters, the outcome could have been tragic, police said.  Boaters are being reminded that water temperatures in a lake of any size is still extremely cold, and without a proper flotation suit, hypothermia can set in within minutes. All boaters are urged to exercise safety when out boating this long weekend."
