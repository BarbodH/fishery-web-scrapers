197382,Spiel,2008-05-06 12:02:00,9065,"Warning markers to be placed at eight GRCA dams  May 05, 2008 / GRCA   The Grand River Conservation Authority is installing warning markers upstream of eight of its dams on the Grand, Nith and Speed rivers to provide additional notice to canoeists and kayakers to stay away from the dams.  The eight GRCA dams are all “run of the river” or “low head” dams. The water upstream of the dams can be still and placid, but the area downstream can be dangerous. Strong currents at the base of the dam can capsize a canoe or kayak and trap the occupant underwater.  Installation is planned for these dates, although the scheduled is subject to change due to weather conditions:  Thursday, May 8 – Wellington Street Dam, Guelph – two buoys Monday, May 12 – Dunnville Dam, including Weirs 1, 2 and 3 – four buoys Tuesday, May 13 – Caledonia Dam – four buoys Tuesday, May 13 – Wilkes Dam, Brantford – three buoys Wednesday, May 14 – Parkhill Dam, Cambridge – four buoys Wednesday, May 14 – New Hamburg Dam – three buoys Thursday, May 15 – Bissell Dam, Elora – one buoy Thursday, May 15 – Drimmie Dam, Elora – boom  The buoys are marked with a bright red diamond, which is an international warning symbol for boaters. They are in addition to existing warning and portage signs. The number of buoys at each dam depends on the width of the river.  The boom at Drimmie Dam spans the river and consists of floats linked together with a chain.  In addition, the County of Brant has already installed buoys at the Penman’s Dam in Paris. The dam is owned by the county.  For more information on river flows, see the River Data of the GRCA web site."
