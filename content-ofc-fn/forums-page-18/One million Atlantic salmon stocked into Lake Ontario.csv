The release of a million fish is a key milestone, made possible through the support of the major sponsor, Australia's Banrock Station Wines, which has committed $1.25 million dollars to the project, their largest contribution to any conservation project outside Australia.  More than 30 partners and sponsors are taking part in the L.O.A.S.R.P. In addition to Banrock Station Wines, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, Liquor Control Board of Ontario, Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association, Fishing Forever Foundation, Fleming College, Trout Unlimited Canada, as well as conservation authorities, local community groups and private landowners are providing support to the program.  The L.O.A.S.R.P. is one of the largest freshwater conservation projects in North America.
