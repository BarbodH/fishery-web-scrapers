Anglers in and around the Timmins area need to brush up on new fishing regulations before their hooks hit the water this season.  The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has released the 2008-2009 recreational fishing regulations summary. There are changes to limits, slot sizes and seasons.  MNR regional biologist Greg Deyne said while not a lot has changed, the biggest difference is in the way the province is split up into new Fisheries Management Zones.  ""Last year, there were 36 fishing divisions,"" Deyne said. ""Now, there's only 20.""  Both Deyne and MNR information officer Ben Legouffe said the new boundaries will make it easier on both conservation officers and anglers.  ""The new way is more ecologically sound,"" Legouffe said. ""It's less complicated for the anglers and easier for us to manage different species of fish.""  ""Last year, there were 36 fishing  divisions. Now, there's only 20.""  MNR regional biologist Greg Deyne  With the new land boundaries, Legouffe said Timmins falls under Zone 8, while many would even travel south to Zone 10, which falls south of Highway 560. Zone 8 encompasses the area from Moosonee down to the Quebec border to New Liskeard, west past Gogama to Chapleau and up to Mattice.  In Zone 8, there are little changes to the fishing regulations for most species, but one that is seeing a difference is sturgeon.  Although not the most popular fish among anglers, Deyne said Zone 8 has the biggest population of sturgeon in the entire province. But that is not saying much.  ""For several reasons, sturgeons haven't been doing very well,"" he said.  Deyne added that female sturgeon only mature at age 20 and then only spawn every four to five years.  ""We've decided to take a more conservative approach.""  This year's sturgeon season will be starting two weeks later than last year, on July 1.  With the first long weekend upon us, anglers across the North are preparing for the beginning of walleye (commonly called pickerel) season, which begins today and runs to the end of the year.  Included with the summary package are exceptions. Deyne said it's important to read the exceptions avoid fishing in sanctuaries.  ""When species such as walleye spawn, they are very vulnerable and for that reason, we close the season down,"" Deyne said. ""Often the fish will stay in the concentrated area before and after the spawn, so the sanctuaries do not open at the same time as the regular season.  ""And it's illegal to fish in these areas.""  Legouffe said it has taken the MNR nearly two years to come up with the new zones. While all the rules are outlined in the summary, not all sanctuaries are marked with signage. Anglers unsure about a specific area should call the local ministry office.  ""The new summary has much better maps, with tables for each zone that are simple to follow,"" Deyne said.  Other changes expected to impact anglers in the Timmins area occur in Zone 10, and include changes to the brown trout, sturgeon and walleye (commonly referred to as pickerel) season, as well as to the limits to perch, rainbow trout and whitefish.  Anglers in Zone 8 are now limited to the number of perch, which used to have no limit.  Perch now have a a sportfishing limit of 50 and a conservation limit of 25.  Limits for sportfishing of whitefish have been lowered from 25 in both zones to 12.  More information on the new regulations and management zones can be found at the local ministry office or by logging onto www.mnr.gov.on.ca.  Hard copies of the regulations are available at most outfitting stores."
