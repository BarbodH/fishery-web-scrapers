1063666,JamesK,2020-06-26 19:13:00,1,"I was hoping I could get some advice for my upcoming fishing trip in August.  I am going to Lake Dalrymple(30mins from Orillia,Ontario) in August, and have a boat rented for the entire time. I really want to do some good fishing like I used to when my dad took me as a kid.  I'm hoping to catch bass, pike and whatever else I can. I never had access to a boat to be able to fish this way, and really not sure the best way to set up my rod for the trip.  So far I've been thinking to reline my pole with 8lb braided line. Someones also recommended I use a  fluorocarbon leader as well. But I'm not sure what #leader I should get in this case.  For bait I'm hoping they sell live bait where I am going. But I have purchased a few mepps spinners, 2 frogs; and trying to think of what else I should bring along. I'm really hoping for some suggestions if anyone has some advice? What's the best line I should use? What kind of spinners, lures etc would be best for getting pike and bass with access to a boat? If anyone can help I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you"
