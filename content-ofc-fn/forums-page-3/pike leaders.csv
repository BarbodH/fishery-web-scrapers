I have landed quite a few pike w/o getting bitten off very oftenÂ but I think my luck has run out----2 bitten off in the past week. This fishing is getting to be an expensive racket---taking my lucky 'killer'lures too.! I have seen some suggestions on here previously but cannot find that thread right now.My bud uses 15-20 # ""super abrasion resistant"" fluoro. What is you considered/expert opinionğŸ˜ƒ----- TIA"
