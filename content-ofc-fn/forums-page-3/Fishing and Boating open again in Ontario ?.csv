1061414,JMFJMF,2020-05-06 14:06:00,18," According to this notice posted last week on the provincial government site, fishing and boating are not unlawful any more, at least in city parks. (Sadly It does not specify what regulations apply outside of urban areas, and outside of parks, so we must assume it's still illegal there).  Parks Fact Sheet 	April 30, 2020 	The Use of City Parks during COVID-19 	Based on recommendations from Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives, the City has made changes to how City parks can be used. 	As the nice weather approaches, we want to leave parks open for residents. We know how important parks are for respite, serenity as well as an escape to nature and green space in our city. 	At this time, a park is not meant to be a destination: 	 You are encouraged to get fresh air and exercise, and to keep moving. 	 We are asking you not to bring a picnic to the park as it can lead to people congregating together. 	 While visiting a park, you must practise physical distancing. Under the City’s physical distancing bylaw, any two people who don't live together, who fail to keep two metres of distance between them in a park or public square, can receive a $1,000 ticket. 	 Under the Province's Emergency Order, a social gathering or organized public event of more than five people is prohibited, unless everyone gathered together live in the same household. This applies in parks. 	What remains “open” in a park? 	People can walk/run/bike in the following areas: 	 Park and ravine green spaces 	 Beaches 	 Trails 	 Boardwalks 	 Dogs can be walked on-leash People can also: 	 Fish (with a licence) 	 Boat, kayak, canoe 	All amenities in parks are closed 	The City can close a park, or any part of it, in the interests of public safety. The General Manager of Parks has temporarily closed parks amenities. In addition, the Province has issued an Emergency Order to close outdoor recreational amenities. While in a park, residents must not use park amenities or congregate in groups. 	Closed City park amenities include: 	Parks Fact Sheet 	 Playgrounds, play structures and equipment 	 Sports facilities and multi-use fields 	 Soccer fields 	 Basketball courts 	 Baseball diamonds 	 Tennis, platform tennis, table tennis and pickleball courts 	 Off-leash dog areas 	 Skateboard and BMX parks 	 Picnic areas and shelters 	 Fixed barbecues 	 Outdoor exercise equipment 	 Greenhouses, nurseries and conservatories 	 Zoos and farms 	 Golf courses and frisbee golf locations 	 Allotment and community gardens 	 Ice rinks (with or without ice) 	 Park washrooms/shelters 	 Marinas 	 Parking lots 	What about benches? 	The focus of enforcement has shifted away from issuing charges to individuals solely for the use of park benches as a place for temporary respite. The focus in relation to the use of park benches is on individuals who are not in compliance with the prohibitions on social and public gatherings, and who do not practise physical distancing while using park benches. 	Benches are not destinations where people should congregate. Benches are not sanitized. People may unknowingly spread the virus by sneezing or touching the bench when the next person comes along, sits down and touches it. 	Can I use a picnic table? 	You cannot use a picnic table at this time. Picnic tables are considered amenities under the provincial order. Much like benches, picnic tables are not sanitized and can also promote congregating. 	Can I have a barbecue? 	You cannot use a privately owned, portable barbecue or hibachi in a park. No portable barbecue can be used without a parks permit, which are not being issued right now.
