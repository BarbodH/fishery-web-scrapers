Not sure if they spell it that way on purpose, or whether they didn't know that the indigenous tribe is 'Arapaho', but whatever, I've finally got one. I prefer it to a tackle box, the only trouble is keeping certain lures, like large plugs, in cloth pockets without them hooking the fabric. Haven't foundÂ those plastic Plano lure boxes that are large enough for a lure but small enough to fit in a pocket. I'm finding that plastic pill jars are quite useful in that regard, so I'm saving them. Gradually replacing all the stuff I had in it, but it's nowhere near as heavy as the previous one yet. I got so used to the weight that when the new one arrived in a box I thought it was empty! "
