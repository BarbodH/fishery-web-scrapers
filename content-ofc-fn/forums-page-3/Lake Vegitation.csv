Are there any lakes in your area with similar issues? I have seen this many times with lakes south of the border, the reason for the loss of vegitation there is ""vegitation control spraying"" then the locals complain about the lake of fish and the toxicity of the water. Hopefully this is something that is a fluke and not a new normal in Ontario."
