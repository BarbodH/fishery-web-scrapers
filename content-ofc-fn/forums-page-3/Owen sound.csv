1065751,Ralph Zettler,2020-09-14 14:55:00,10,Been a long time since I fished Owen Sound Can anybody tell me how the fall fishing is and if there is decent fishing other than rainbow Years back my buddy picked up a 14lb walleye I realize it was probably a fluke but I'm curiousÂ  if anybody trolls or cast the shoreline for the off species Thanks in advance
