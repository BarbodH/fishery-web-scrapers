1057576,WHO,2020-03-19 21:46:00,6,"Hello: Brand new guy to this type of info gathering so hoping that someone may have some that they are willing to share with me. Doing a 10 day trip up to the Missinabie/Renabie area to fish primarily for walleye. We have fished Dog Lake on 2 trips (staying at rental cabins) and although we did OK (not great), the lake is large and sometimes the weather not so cooperative in Sept. We only have a 14ft. boat so hard to fish in larger chop. We plan to head up that way again this Sept. (2020) but would really like to find a somewhat smaller walleye lake to set up a 26ft. trailer on (Crown land). I've done some research using MNR Fish ON-line interactive map and found some lakes e.g. (Crooked, Ash, Bolkow, Rennie, Stephenson, lakes) that are listed as having walleye there but last observation date is blank so no idea how old that info is. if anyone has any info that they are wiling to share re: the Missanbie/Renabie area, I would certainly appreciate whatever it may be. Thanks!!!!"
