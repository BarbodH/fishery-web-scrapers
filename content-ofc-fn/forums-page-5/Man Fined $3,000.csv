690400,recordfish,2012-04-26 21:12:00,6,I'm pretty sure that unfortunately he will keep fishing anyway .
690620,icedude,2012-04-27 17:13:00,459,"I'm pretty sure that unfortunately he will keep fishing anyway .   I'm pretty sure you're right   Last time i had a cursory look at the MNR enforcement/Stewardship financial commitment in Ontario --looked like something in the order of a 57 percent decrease in provincial funding since the Mike Harris era   This character clearly ""doesn't give a crap""  Personally, would do a thorough examination of his income tax over the last seven years,vet his standing as a Canadian citizen and ask the folks closing the Kingston Pen to leave the doors open for an extra 6 months   just an opinion   Paul"
690678,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 19:56:00,3525,OK what would you all do in this situation assuming you were stupid enough to get yourself there? I'd be in Alaska or norway in a second!
691809,Stoty,2012-05-01 11:41:00,2910, Poirier said the man can face jail time if he chooses to violate fishing laws again.
692991,Headhunter,2012-05-04 15:46:00,5703,"What's to stop this guy from strolling into a CTC somewhere, filling out an application for a fishing liscense under another name and heading out to the lake? Does the MNR have more detailed info on us that could prevent this? Do they require other I.D. when they are writing someone up? (I have never been written up so I have no clue) HH"
721199,cja,2012-08-09 11:28:00,29,well i am sure he is back fishing right now
726069,pricedo,2012-08-30 09:26:00,6," The original game related charges were provincial offenses and though the fines are substantial are considered relatively minor in the grande scheme of things. Violation of a court order however is a Criminal Code of Canada offense and conviction registers a criminal record against the offender. A subsequent conviction would likely see our incorrigibly intransigent fisherman counting fly tracks on the ceiling of a rather small cell in a provincial jail. He is also ""personna non grata"" at the United States border unless he obtains a very expensive waiver from the US Department of Justice."

869394,Dave Bailey,2014-08-26 02:43:00,1641,"Another possible scenario: The government does not, as rumoured, do away with license-free fishing for seniors. He turns 65 and starts fishing again. CO asks for identification, he shows proof of age. How many COs are going to take the time and effort to check his name against a list of those banned for life?"
543068,TJQ,2011-01-24 17:08:00,7805,"Man Fined $3,000 And Banned From Fishing For Life      NEWS  January 19, 2011      A North York man has been fined $3,000 and banned from fishing for life for failing to obey a court order.  Viktor Liakh was convicted of failing to comply with an order prohibiting him from fishing in Ontario or having a fishing licence.  The court heard that on May 18, 2010, Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers from Aurora District were patrolling fishing areas in Toronto. The officers saw Liakh fishing and asked to see his fishing licence. Liakh produced a 2010 fishing licence, but further investigation revealed he was prohibited from fishing in Ontario and from possessing a fishing licence. The court had suspended his fishing licence because of previous fishing-related offences.  Justice of the Peace D. Keith Currie heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Toronto, on January 13, 2011.  For further information on fishing regulations, please consult the 2011 Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary, available at ServiceOntario/Government Information Centres, from licence issuers and at ontario.ca/fishing.  To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time or contact your local ministry's office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
543120,pylon,2011-01-24 19:06:00,68,i hope all his gear was seized too to incur such an infraction  he must be the worst poacher going
543129,Twocoda,2011-01-24 19:24:00,4130,can anyone imagine NOT being able to fish for the rest of their lives???? i wonder if there is rehab for this...
543197,waki5,2011-01-24 22:47:00,34,"is there a news article somewhere? i'd like to read some more on this. it would suck not able to fish in ontario again. but i tell you one thing, i'd be moving to another province"
543246,spinnerbaitking,2011-01-24 23:57:00,1622,  If there is rehab for this you can bet we'd be paying for it lol SBK
543306,timmeh,2011-01-25 01:49:00,609,Well he listen so well the first time so I'm sure he'll obey this order.

543565,siwash,2011-01-25 23:45:00,680,it wouldnt stop me..  i would get my name legally changed...
544504,waki5,2011-01-28 01:57:00,34,now thats a thought. just a name change. but i wonder. i think your record would follow you.
546446,wetnose,2011-02-01 20:46:00,3,"Will name change make a difference, do not think so"
547441,bigugli,2011-02-03 22:35:00,6138,A legal name change is hard to do with a record hanging over your head.

550017,Nemo,2011-02-10 20:34:00,727,"http://www.thestar.com/news/crime/article/927471--north-york-man-banned-from-fishing-for-life  Liem Vu Staff Reporter A 61-year-old North York man has been banned from fishing for life after violating a court order.  Conservation officers from the Ministry of Natural Resources say they spotted Viktor Liakh fishing at the Holland River in Bradford last May. After checking his licence, they discovered that Liakh was under a five-year fishing suspension that was handed down to him in January, 2010 for casting too many lines.  According to Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officer Doug Poirier, anglers are permitted to cast one line in open waters.  Liakh violated this four times between 2002 and 2009 by casting up to four lines.  The Ontario Court of Justice fined Liakh $3,000 and banned him from fishing.  Poirier said the man can face jail time if he chooses to violate fishing laws again."
551722,dracokaos,2011-02-15 12:31:00,116,  I wondering if his gear is for sale????
556046,Rick2,2011-02-27 20:13:00,15,Should have added jail time as well.
689114,silly,2012-04-22 00:02:00,5,Good
689122,Twocoda,2012-04-22 00:33:00,4130,i wonder if there is a legitimate reason he NEEDS to fish....maybe to feed his family?  i havent read the STAR article yet....just blindly posting  lol...i have read the article....its an old post....
689127,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-22 00:56:00,3761, Not that I would get my license taken away for life but if i did...ill just night fish  from then on...
689195,limeyangler,2012-04-22 09:14:00,5204,what happens if he's caught fishing again?
689201,Twocoda,2012-04-22 10:51:00,4130,he will get banned for two lifetimes...
689203,Gregoire,2012-04-22 11:34:00,1397,I think it's important to point out that this was his 5th violation. I like to think that all members respect the regs and would not need to worry about getting their license suspended yet alone banned from fishing for life.
689213,Twocoda,2012-04-22 12:07:00,4130,which raises the point of WHY? i see stories like this and wonder if there isnt serious underlying issues...maybe mental or financial that he feels he HAS to break the rules in order to survive...or maybe he is just an idiot with no regard for rules
689216,Fisherman,2012-04-22 12:12:00,7201,"Well that's easy, probably nothing other than monetary punishment like the last 4 times.   Line him up against the wall, safety off, fire."
689236,Gregoire,2012-04-22 13:54:00,1397,"Seeing as the angler was using multiple lines I would suggest that he was trying to catch a large amount of fish. If he he could prove that the fish he was catching were being used as food for his family I could see leniency, and no fine. Given the consequences and the fact that if he is caught again he will face jail time I would guess that he was profiting in some way. That is pure conjecture on my part."
