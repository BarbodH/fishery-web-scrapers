Most of the growth — approximately 70,000 people — is expected to occur in the Lake Simcoe watershed, he said. “The surface runoff (from) driveways can really have an impact on the lake,” Dunlop said. “Stormwater management is really and truly my biggest concern.” The key will be to “very closely” monitor the stormwater management plan, he added. “In future years, that's going to be one of the key things monitored to keep the lake clean,” Dunlop said. Simcoe North MP Bruce Stanton called the impending residential and commercial growth “the big elephant in the room.” “We've got to improve and expand our efforts to control that (increase in phosphorous) before it gets into the lake,” he said. The second annual progress report on the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan was released by Ontario's environment minister on Friday. The Lake Simcoe Protection Plan was released in June 2009. “We are seeing encouraging signs in Lake Simcoe that the efforts being made by the public, scientists, municipalities and our partners are beginning to pay off,” said Environment Minister Jim Bradley. “I am particularly heartened to see more native fish being caught as we ramp down on phosphorus pollution.” Phosphorus was identified as a problem for Lake Simcoe's health in the 1970s. Excess phosphorous causes more plant growth and when those plants die and decay, oxygen levels are sucked out of the water, depriving aquatic life. The Lake Simcoe Protection Plan has been successful in decreasing the spring total phosphorus concentrations, which will help reduce algae. The phosphorus reduction strategy addresses the entire watershed and guides actions over the next 35 years. Sources of phosphorus include sewage treatment plants, airborne sources, agricultural polders, private septic systems and runoff from rural and agricultural areas, and stormwater runoff from urban areas. The plan targets an annual phosphorous load of approximately 44 tonnes per year. This is 40% less than the current average load. The number of naturally reproduced lake trout and lake whitefish is growing.  The proportion caught by anglers rose from less than 20% in the mid-2000s to more than 40% in the winter of 2010, according to the report. Key highlights of the report include an increase to the lake's deep-water oxygen levels and the implementation of six subwatershed plans. The government has also created a new guide for municipalities on how to develop and implement stormwater management master plans to help reduce phosphorous loadings. Dunlop has received complaints about the plan's guidelines around development. “Some of the guidelines around development are just too strict,” he said. “The minimal distances from water sources, like ditches and that, for development are just too far.”"

Perhaps I am a little too wary, And although the report suggests were heading in the right direction I think the health of the lake will remain the same for many years to come just because of the rise in population in Barrie and surrounding areas. Hopefully the trend stays on the positive swing and not revert. Time will tell."
