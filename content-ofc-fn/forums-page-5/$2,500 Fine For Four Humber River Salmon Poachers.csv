658158,TJQ,2012-01-19 18:16:00,7805,"Four Toronto residents have been fined $2,500 for illegal salmon fishing on the Humber River in the City of Toronto.  Richard Muntyan, Ervin Paczok and Iles Glosczi pleaded guilty to charges under the Fisheries Act and the Ontario Fishery Regulations and were each fined a total of $500. Tibor Danyi also pleaded guilty to charges under the Fisheries Act and the Ontario Fishery Regulations and was fined a total of $1,000. In addition to the fines, their fishing equipment has been permanently forfeited.  The court heard that on the afternoon of October 8, 2011, Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers found the men fishing within 25 yards downstream of a dam on the Humber River, in an area that is closed to fishing. The men were also observed to repeatedly jerk large weighted hooks and fishing lures through the water in order to deliberately snag salmon.  Migratory fish, such as rainbow trout and salmon, are vulnerable to poaching when they congregate in the pools at the base of dams while moving upstream to spawn. Signs posted along the river remind anglers that no fishing is permitted within 25 yards downstream of the dam. Public complaints to enforcement officers have helped catch anglers who ignore the signs.  Justice of the Peace Alice Napier heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice in Toronto, on January 12, 2012.  For further information on fishing regulations, please consult the 2012 Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary, available at ServiceOntario/Government Information Centres, licence issuers and at ontario.ca/fishing.  To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."

700617,Christopheraaron,2012-05-28 23:53:00,3525,GREAT! I do find it annoying when you aren't allowed to fish within a certain distance of something and they don't post where the sanctuary starts and ends.
