521256,Roy,2010-11-18 19:29:00,13728,"http://www.thestar.c...auga-mayor?bn=1  Cudos to the CO:  A Chicago-area man posing as an angler from Mississauga has been fined $5,000 for fishing illegally in northwestern Ontario this past summer.  Apparently, not knowing the identity of Mayor Hazel McCallion – an avid angler herself – proved his undoing.  Tim Neidenbach, a Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officer, approached the man on Lack Seul, near Ear Falls on Aug. 20, and asked the man for his fishing licence.  The man handed over an Ontario resident's Outdoors Card and fishing tag. He said he lived in Mississauga and cited that city as his hometown on the licence.  When the astute officer called his bluff, asking him to identify the mayor of Mississauga, he couldn't answer.  It proved to him that the man was not from Mississauga. He didn't even know the mayor was an avid angler.  The man proved to be from Illinois and had been fishing illegally in Ontario waters since 1993.  Justice of the Peace Robert McNally heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Kenora, on Nov. 9.  Wojciech Rzepka was fined $3,300 for three counts of possessing a bogus fishing licence. He was also fined $850 for fishing without a licence and $850 for making a false statement.  ""I think he plans to pay the fine because he wants to come back up here to fish,"" Neidenbach told the Canadian Press."

721115,Christopheraaron,2012-08-08 22:01:00,3525,"It's good that he got caught, however i'm sure many people don't know the mayor of their town and highly doubt that they would know if they liked to fish or not."
721328,whiskywizard,2012-08-09 18:12:00,305," For many towns, you're right. For Mississauga, Hazel has been mayor for 33 years and is quite famous for it."
721669,beaser,2012-08-10 22:01:00,19,Not many people in Ontario that don't know of Hazel. The lady is a legend!
