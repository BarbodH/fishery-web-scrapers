690569,recordfish,2012-04-27 14:40:00,6," Hi everyone,  it seems to me that there is a little bit of a confusion about the different carp species. The bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) is the one we are talking about here. This species feeds on microscopic organisms called plankton and besides that it can cause serious problem in the ecosystem it is almost impossible to catch, because of it's feeding habit. It filters the food out of the water, don't actually pick up the bait only by chance. The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) looks completely different and behaves completely different.     It eats macroscopic plants (weed) and it can be properly caught pretty muck with the same method as the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). However it is really fun to catch (can grow up to 100lb) it can be just as much of a problem for the ecosystem as any other introduced species.      "

710005,basserone,2012-06-28 13:47:00,7,"I just read an article about that is week and it is not true.  The U.S. fish and wildlife confirmed that there has been no evidence that the Asian carp has breached the beerier, http://www.freep.com/article/20110719/NEWS05/107190387/Asian-carp-Battle-lines-drawn-Chicago-ship-canal.  Now although the article states that it is not fool proof, and the carp could get past the beerier with the aid of humans. I did however find this article on the human error factor http://www.arenacindependent.com/detail/94207.html.  Last week in Windsor a fish farm in the U.S. was caught transporting frozen Asian Carp to a restaurant in Toronto, not against the law apparently, however when the custom authorities put them in water they came to life.  This could have been a bad situation. Interesting I just tried to access the article from the CTV website and it is no longer available, hummmm?  Just a closing thought why, if the problem is that serious and has raised such a concern, is the U.S. government allowing these fish farms in the first place, shut them down and fine them huge dollars."

720977,cja,2012-08-08 11:04:00,29,I can't believe that they can not due some harm to the great lakes
534676,Gary2242,2011-01-04 19:45:00,9,I have written every politician and biologist in the area and nobody seems to care or wants to listen to ideas that someone else thought of.  Close to the north end of the Mississippi there are the biggest Salt mines in the US. All they need to do is dump a truckload of  rock salt into the river every week or two at the electrical barrier and that will greatly decrease the chances of the carp getting through the barrier and will compensate if there is a power shortage. The salt will push them all down river a few miles. By the time the salt gets a few miles down stream it will dissipate and not affect native fish species. A dump truck of rock salt delivered is about $60. This is a cheap way of dealing with the problem until they block the waterway. Salting the river to push them way down stream will also help prevent birds of prey from catching a carp and then dropping it above the electrical barrier.  I also think they should dump a few million Muskie in there. That will clean out the populations as well.  Gary www.musky.ca

633664,Loadman,2011-10-24 14:35:00,63,are they like the grass carp?
633678,MCTFisher9120,2011-10-24 15:08:00,3761, Couldn't be more true lol. They will make it. Even common Carp I have never seen in the small lakes I fish out in Leeds & The Thousand Islands I well saw this summer. In the same spot's I was bassin I came across a school of 5 or 10 huge carp...I have been fishing there the last 10 years and never saw one and on the trip that was one sighting during a 30day trip. I'm sure these Asian Carp are here just a matter of seeing how nature battles back against them.

673082,rmarentette,2012-03-04 22:39:00,124,"The Ministry of Natural Resources is investigating another large border discovery of Asian carp, an invasive species commercial fishermen have said could be catastrophic if they spread into the Great Lakes.  A ministry conservation officer was contacted Tuesday night by the Canada Border Services Agency at the Ambassador Bridge about a truckload of fish coming from the United States that had 14,000 pounds of Asian carp, ministry spokesman John Cooper said late Wednesday afternoon.  The investigation continues and no charges have been laid, he said.  In January there were two seizures of live Asian carp that together totaled more than 9,000 pounds at the Ambassador Bridge. While trucks can transport live fish, it is illegal to possess live Asian carp in Ontario.  Asian carp includes bighead carp, which can reach more than 100 pounds, silver carp, grass carp and black carp.  The Ontario Commercial Fisheries Association said it could be catastrophic if Asian carp get into the Great Lakes.  The U.S. government is trying to keep Asian carp from getting past an electric barrier in a Chicago canal system and into Lake Michigan. The concern with live Asian carp in Ontario is they could be released. If a truck carrying live fish crashed near a bridge and there were live Asian carp they might be able to get into a stream and then into the Great Lakes.     http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2012/02/29/asian-carp-seized-at-windsor-detroit-border/"
673235,hammercarp,2012-03-05 15:24:00,964," The MNR and our border guards are doing what they should be doing and I, like everybody else is happy they are there to do it. We do not need those fish here. But the odds of something happening like you describe are very , very small. The real threat is from anglers in the states using asian carp fry as bait and dumping them out into  waters that connect to the Great Lakes at the end of the day. Also there is the possibility of a malicious nut doing it deliberately. Just think about how tempting that would be for some ARA lunatic. Destroying commercial and sport fishing in the Great Lakes by simply allowing life to spread. And the fact that this was started by farm raising fish. Now there's an ARA crazy's dream come true. The more media coverage this gets the more likely that this will happen. There is also the fact that life does spread and we are almost powerless to stop it."
