Just got them by mail... They look deadly. Anyone got tips for that particular lure, I would love to see them. I expect things will be a little different this time!  Suggestions?  For anyone who hasn't seen it, have a peek and post your thoughts. I will report back here with my results.  http://www.kamooki.ca  From the videos, they do cool things when fishing bottom structure. Will see if it works in the hands of an amateur."

They're working on a couple more sizes for this lure, one a little smaller and one a little bigger. Can't wait to throw them for bass! Great write-up by the way!"
