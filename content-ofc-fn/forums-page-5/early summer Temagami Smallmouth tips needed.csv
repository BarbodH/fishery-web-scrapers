1024576,monocacybassman,2018-03-16 02:00:00,1,"I'm heading to rib lake Ontario, the last week in june 2018 for a couple days of smallmouth fishing and relaxation. I'm looking for a bit of information on the area. what type of baitfish are in Rib lake or common to the temagami area. i looking to match the hatch and need to know what colors to throw. I plan on jigging with a bico and 3""-5"" z-man trd trailer canadian crawl color and some walk the dog baits. any other hard or soft bait  that have produced? Here in Maryland I only fish for smallies in rivers so i may have to adjust my techniques for lake fishing. I only ever throw black or white buzz baits and small brown crankbaits which almost always produce a good day of fishing on the rivers here. any thoughts, tips and information is much appreciated ."
