I'm sure we'll have no trouble puttin' together shore lunch - I'm specifically interested in 411 on CPR fish - BIG 'eyes, Giant 'eyes...and goliath gators.... I'm also interested in trying to piece together a whitefish bite...and smallies!  We've got 7 days, so we're gonna cover a lot of water.  I'll be bringin' all the outfits - bottom bouncers, boards & counters, all the casting outfits, etc etc.  Presentations, I've got covered... I'm wondering more about patterns.  Thought I'd throw it out there and see if I get any great tidbits - cheers!!"
