706308,Spiel,2012-06-16 12:27:00,9059,I believe you are correct Lorne but it does eventually flow to the Welland.
706312,Ralph Field,2012-06-16 12:40:00,1018,It seems a shame to me that we always learn about the harm that some chemicals cause only after using them for many years. Should we not test these chemicals before we allow there use in our country.

706478,dave524,2012-06-17 03:19:00,4507,Chippewa Creek and the Welland River are the same body of water. The original name was Chippewa Creek and later changed to Welland River but oldtimers still refer to it by the old name.
706768,pics,2012-06-18 07:32:00,1268,The fish around wellandport have much higher levels of pollutants than the lake has. Further study is needed but its proving to be nearly impossible just to get someone to admit responsibility. A class action may be the only way...
