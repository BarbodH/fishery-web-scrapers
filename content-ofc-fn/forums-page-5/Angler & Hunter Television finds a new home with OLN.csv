743993,TJQ,2012-11-14 17:40:00,7805,"  New broadcast partner carries award-winning show into 20th season   The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH), producers of the award winning Angler & Hunter Television (AHTV) program, is thrilled to announce that after several weeks of negotiations, an agreement has been reached with OLN (Outdoor Life Network), a division of Rogers Media, to begin airing AHTV in January 2013.  “The OFAH was taken aback when Shaw Media/Global Television informed us that the network was dropping all hunting programming by the end of the year, including AHTV. We were given the option to proceed with a fishing only show, but that was never a realistic alternative as it would compromise our integrity.” said OFAH Executive Director Angelo Lombardo. “We are pleased that OLN understands the time-honoured traditions of hunting and fishing, and recognizes that AHTV not only delivers a fast-paced, high-energy program, but also a lesson in the conservation of our natural resources.”  AHTV has secured a Sunday morning, 8:00 a.m. timeslot for 52 weeks with OLN. The 20th season will premiere Sunday, January 6. This is an unprecedented step in a new direction for the program’s production, and one that will bring in a larger, more diversified audience. AHTV will also be available on CHEX TV, CKWS TV and WILD TV.  “OLN offers its viewers a one-stop destination for adrenaline pumping action and adventure entertainment, featuring some of the most popular programs on television today,” said AHTV Host Mike Miller. “It is an ideal fit for AHTV and we look forward to a long and beneficial relationship with our new broadcasting partner.”  OFAH has a long-standing partnership with Rogers, having purchased Ontario OUT OF DOORS magazine from the media giant in 2008.  With over 100,000 members, supporters and subscribers, and 675 member clubs, the OFAH is the largest non-profit conservation based organization in Ontario.
