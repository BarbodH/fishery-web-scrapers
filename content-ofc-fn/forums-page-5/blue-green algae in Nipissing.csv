The North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit is working with the municipality and Ministry of the Environment to advise residents.  “The operator of Callander’s water treatment plant has activated all of the appropriate steps for the safety of the municipal water supply,” the health unit said in a media release.  Blue-green algae are primitive microscopic bacteria that live in fresh water. They are usually hard to see, but during hot weather, they can rapidly grow to form a large bloom.  The Microcystin-LR (bacteria toxin) concentration is above the acceptable standard for drinking water, the health unit said, and advises residents and visitors near the Yacht Club to avoid swimming in the area and make sure pets stay away from the area.  Residents with private water systems should avoid using the water near the North Bay Yacht Club for drinking, cooking or bathing. The health unit notes that boiling the water or using home water treatment devices will not destroy the toxins.  Toxins can irritate the skin and, if ingested, cause diarrhea and vomiting. At high enough levels, the toxins may cause liver and nervous system damage.  On the web: www.healthunit.biz"
