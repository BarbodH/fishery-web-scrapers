Our group will not be returning to Air Cochrane until their facilities are at least respectable for rustic outposts. If you do go, don't let the pilot leave you until you've got your boats running, check to see if there is gas enough for your visit, check to see if there is enough firewood (it was in the 30's several nights when we were there in mid June), bring a ton of duct tape to patch holes in walls and windows (mosquitos) and pay for digital sat phone....unfortunately they'll charge you for the service but not the call if you need something. .
