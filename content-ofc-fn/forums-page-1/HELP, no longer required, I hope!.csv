1083748,Barry Willis,2023-02-10 21:27:00,179,"Holy Frik I think I finally got it. Thanks very much for the help guys. It was too easy for me to figure out. I'm always afraid of clicking on something I know nothing about and buggering up the computer. There have been many phone calls to my wife at work, I screwed up the computer, what do I do now Haha."
