1082307,JoePa,2022-09-29 23:05:00,179,I got an e-mail from a fishing lodge in western Ontario the other day - it said that all the Covid restrictions will be lifted as of October 1st in Ontario and things will get back to normal - that is really good news - can start planning on my fishing trips again - didn't use my Tracker boat for 2 years - hope I can get it started after sitting so long - I did add Sta Bilt to the gas when I put it to rest 2 years ago - that virus sure screwed things up
