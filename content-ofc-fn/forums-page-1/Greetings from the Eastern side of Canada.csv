Thought I’d share a bit some fishing some not just kinda staying in touch So the fishing took place here locally it’s called Horse Race (43.3787156, -65.6137912) the current moves pretty quick here and you try to get there on slack and basically troll a wire u with 3 rows of flashers and 3 wooden plugs you can sort of see one in my hand and on the deck anyway add a hunk of lead 60 feet of cord and a piece of bungee cord as a strike indicator and your good to go this is all home made gear. This is a once a year deal to put fish in the freezer for the winter I go out with a guy I’ve know since I was a kid he is a commercial fishermen and is getting geared up for the lobster season in between deer season of course. Work is great i have a great crew I work with nothing to complain about.  Got married in 2020 in the midst of the vid. So without further ado I will add some pictures and call it a day lots of work to do at the bee yard this weekend to get ready for the coming dark season. capeislandapiaries.com cheers to all my friends if I’m back that way I will be reaching out to go fishing……Beware  cheers and love peter(bite me)                      "
