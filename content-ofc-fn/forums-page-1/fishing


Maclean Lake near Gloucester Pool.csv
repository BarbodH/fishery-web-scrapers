1086011,possum,2023-07-08 02:15:00,2,My brother claimed that the MNR poisoned Maclean Lake to kill all the mosquitoes and that as a result the Lake was now devoid of fish.  I grew up fishing there and want to know if this information is correct?
1086013,Terry,2023-07-08 09:06:00,14456,I have not heard that but it directly flows into  Gloucester pool so if it did it would have affected the pool too
1086014,misfish,2023-07-08 16:21:00,29133,I have looked on the MNR site and there is nothing about a die off or spraying. That small lake is very pressured in the winter months. I have fished it many many times. Full of snot rockets and some very nice bass. Fun place to fish.

1086180,glen,2023-07-29 02:20:00,2641,It doesn’t make sense to poison a lake to kill mosquitoes unless they had some west Nile or something.  I guess with the mnr anything is possible.  Should be lots of dead fish floating around.
