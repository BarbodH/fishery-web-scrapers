The letters and the sign are cut and etched with a laser from 1/2 marine plywood I like this medium. First year made the the backing from tongue  and groove hemlock we lost some letters due to the hemlock flexing and letters being in the line of fire. The disc went to hell. That year I used a spray clear coat uv stabilized all that good stuff this season stay with the hemlock and tried spar varnish new disc and letters 2 coats disc and letters. For the 2023 season will be going with 3/4 marine for the backing and half inch for disc and letters the disc is 24” the question i need answered is what exterior stabilized clear can I use to solve the issue . Keep in mind highly coastal environment lots of fog lots of damp. the pictures will do the talking end of season and beginning  HELP PLEASE!!  cheers peter

1082766,aplumma,2022-11-05 22:57:00,6893,If you seal the letters and disc before you hang them you will be able to get a better seal. A marine grade varnish will be the best sealant you can find. This should say UV stabilizer on it to keep sun damage to a minimum. You also should consider making the letters larger and cut them from plywood to keep them from breaking along the grain of the wood. If you have the funds using teak or Acacia  wood. Final thought is making it from trex or hockey board synthetics will last longer. Art

I will be prepping the poo out of the surface sanding and sealing and finishing. Spar varnish still stands above most multiple coats and sandings. Thank you both I will update on the results over the winter. I knew the answer was here!!! cheers Peter
