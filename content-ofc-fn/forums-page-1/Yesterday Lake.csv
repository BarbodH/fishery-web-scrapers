1079392,Phil S C,2022-03-24 12:46:00,11,Our group of 5 is flying into Yesterday Lake with Cochrane Air on the first Saturday in June 2022. Anybody have any helpful hints such as the hot bait or locations to fish on this lake. We've been to numerous other lakes in the region but this will be our first trip to Yesterday.
