Folks moved up there early 90s and, even though pike were present at the time, still had a fishable musky population then. Starting in the 2000s musky was in a steady decline, started getting into more tigers than pure strain. 2010s lake pike population started to decline as well. Now it’s mostly bass. If you tie into a ski it’s a rare occurrence.  Not to say it’s zero, but chances are low."
