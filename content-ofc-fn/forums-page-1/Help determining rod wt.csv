1081350,dave524,2022-07-28 21:27:00,4507,"Old enough to remember before the weight classification we used letters for fly line sizes.  Size A would be a thick heavy line and H was a light line. A 6 weight double taper would be called like a  HEH and a weight forward suitable for bass bugs would be like a GAF , probably close to an 8 wt. today, any letters like that on it ?  edit: quick search found this "
1081433,Craig Ward,2022-08-02 09:39:00,4,63647L are the only numbers on it.
1081435,dave524,2022-08-02 12:04:00,4507,"63647L are the only numbers on it. any letters like HCH or HDH ? those are the line designation if it was built pre 1960 or so could be a 4 or 5 wt looking at this as long as the "" Popular "" model was made in only 1 line class https://www.traditionalfisherman.com/viewtopic.php?t=5685"
1081436,Craig Ward,2022-08-02 12:21:00,4,"Nope, those are the only numbers. I've been casting it with a vintage Battenkill 5/6 reel, and it seems to cast very nice, but I'm a rank beginner. I cast better with it than I do with my carbon fiber rod, but I do get the occasional wind knot forming. How do I stop that?"

Timing, wait for the tug when you backcast before bringing it forward.  The vintage Battenkill is a very appropriate matchup if it is the rod in the link I posted, they mentioned in that link it is a slow or moderate action which is easier to cast with than the fast action carbon rods"
