Have been to Lake Charlton several times, fishing was ok got about 60+ decent bass for the week. Plenty of weather systems coming through which wreaked havoc with the fishing. Lake Carlton Camp is always a great place to stay. Rustic but everything you need and great hosts. Even my wife got into some decent fish. Usual story on the last day found a 12 fish from 13 cast rock pile I had never seen 20 minutes before I had to get off the water to catch the ferry home.Â ðŸ˜¬       "
