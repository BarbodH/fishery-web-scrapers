Unfortunately in my neck of the woods the ice is too thin and no open water. I thought about taking the Argo out but if it breaks through and won't climb back up on it I'd really be in trouble. I noticed a couple posts in regards to the 300 Mitchell. I'm curious if any one had a 300 Dam Quick. I used to go through at least one closed face reel a month. They looked nice but just didn't last. The guy at the hard ware store in Wiarton kept asking why don't you buy a 330 Quick. This was in the mid to late sixties.  I finally told him I couldn't afford one as my only income in my pre teens was selling dew worms at 25 cents a dozen. He talked me into putting $5:00 bucks down and continue paying for it when I could. It was $35:00. I finally got it and what an awesome reel. I used it pretty much every day for years and only had to replace the bail spring twice and I still have it. The only thing I didn't like was the loud clicking as I cranked it. I started keeping it in that position though as there were a couple times when I got a hit and went to set the hook my fingers slipped off the handle and it would wind backwards thus letting the line become slack. I then bought a 300 Mitchell off a friend for $5:00 brand new in the box. How could I not? I'd heard so much about them and seen a lot of other anglers using them. It may sound stupid but at the time I could not get use to it after using the Quick for so long as the bail spun the opposite direction than the Quick. But I still have it and I did eventually get use to it. I wouldn't be afraid to tie into any size fish with the 300 Quick. The Mitchell is no where near as robust or heavy duty. Happy Days."

1080411,Garry2Rs,2022-05-28 23:56:00,1425,I also had a Quick. They were from Germany and had a much better design internally than their contemporaries. Worm gear vs planetary gears.  The one probably was the spools warped.
1080424,Barry Willis,2022-05-29 17:16:00,177,"Howdy Garry, very nice to get your message. I still have my 330 Quick. I used it almost every day for years and the only thing I had to do was replace the bail spring and right from around the same time I bought a 110 ultra light, it is an awesome little reel. Quick went out of business but years later they were reintroduced but I can't remember where they were manufactured. At that time the 330 became 330I and so on. They were also a good reel but not as good as the original. Tight lines. - Barry."
1081144,SirCranksalot,2022-07-13 13:20:00,3291,The 300 is the only one I had. It broke but I bought 2 more at a garage sale a few years back. Finally got around to using one last winter.  I like their simplicity---easy to maintain--but  big advantage  was that I had 4 spools to fit the same reel!
