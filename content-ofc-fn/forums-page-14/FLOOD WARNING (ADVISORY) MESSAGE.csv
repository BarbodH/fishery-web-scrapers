Rainfall and above freezing temperatures over the course of the day are expected to consolidate the snow pack across the watershed. Overnight temperatures are expected to fall back below freezing. Warmer weather and rainfall are predicted for Saturday, December 26. It is expected that this rainfall would result in some snow melting, and localized runoff. Ice conditions on the river and lakes are uncertain, and stream banks are slippery. Parents are reminded to keep children away from watercourses.  Grand River @ West Montrose  Heavy frazil ice has formed in the Grand River through the Village of West Montrose, causing elevated river levels. Emergency officials have contacted adjacent residents. The ice jam appears to have stabilized and river levels are holding steady at the present time.  GRCA staff will be monitoring conditions over the Christmas period and will issue additional warnings as necessary.  For more information on river flows, see the River Data of the GRCA web site.
