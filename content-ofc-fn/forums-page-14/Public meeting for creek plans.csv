The creeks are within the watershed of Spencer Creek, which flows through Flamborough and Dundas before emptying into Cootes Paradise at the west end of the harbour.  Draft plans to restore and protect the health of the creeks and their ecosystems will be presented at an open house from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. tomorrow at Rock Chapel United Church, 451 Rock Chapel Rd.  Individuals, businesses and community associations are invited to share their thoughts, concerns and knowledge of the local landscape.  Removing the harbour from an international list of Great Lakes pollution hot spots by 2015 still requires sewage treatment plant upgrades and better stewardship of streams feeding the harbour.  The three creeks begin above the escarpment in Flamborough and include 41-metre Tews Falls."
