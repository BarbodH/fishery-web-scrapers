To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience, anglers should:  - Advise others where they plan to fish and when they plan to return  - Wear appropriate clothing, such as a floater suit  - Carry appropriate equipment, like a set of ice picks  - Register ice huts where required, except tent-style huts with a base area of less than seven square metres  - Check ice thickness regularly with a spud bar or auger as they move further out on the ice.  QUOTES  â€œIce fishing is a popular winter activity for thousands, but people need to play it safe and stay off the ice unless they’re sure about ice conditions,â€ said Natural Resources Minister Donna Cansfield.  â€œAnglers should also be familiar with the regulations about registering ice huts.â€  QUICK FACTS  - Ice does not freeze at a uniform thickness across most lakes and rivers, particularly at the start of the winter season when near-shore ice is often much thicker and safer than ice further out. - Ice that forms over flowing water, springs, pressure cracks, old ice holes or around the mouths of rivers and streams can be weaker than surrounding ice.  - The strongest ice is clear blue in colour.  White or opaque ice is much weaker, and ice with a honeycombed look should be avoided.  - Added precautions must be taken when travelling on frozen lakes or rivers.  Snowmobiles require at least 20 centimetres of clear blue ice and most light vehicles require 30 centimetres or more.  Double these amounts if the ice is white or opaque.  - A layer of heavy snow on a frozen lake or river can insulate the ice below and slow down freezing.
