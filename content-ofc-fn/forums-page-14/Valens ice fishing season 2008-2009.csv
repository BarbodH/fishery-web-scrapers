Although the bluegill sunfish and black crappie numbers are considered to be recovering, it is important to maintain the fish population and to help prevent an over harvest. Therefore the park will only be open to ice fishing on selected days as well as impose a voluntary limit. Ice fishing will reopen beginning on December 21 and 28, 2008.  Hamilton Conservation Authority staff  feel that with voluntary limits on the ice fishing activities in winter 2008-09, the current bluegill sunfish and black crappie populations will not be negatively affected. These limits are being placed on the lake to help ensure the sustainability of bluegill sunfish and black crappie.  2008-09 Ice Fishing Limits:  For this season, ice fishing will ONLY be open:  - Sunday, December 21 and 28, 2008 - Sunday, January 18 and 25, 2009 - Sunday, February 1 and 8, 2009 - Sunday, March 1 and 8, 2009  The IceFest Ice Fishing Derby will be returning to Valens. It is set for Sunday February 15, 2009.  Great prizes and activities for the whole weekend.  More details will be posted on www.conservationhamilton.ca when available.  A voluntary limit has been set at 15 bluegill sunfish and black crappie total per day. The HCA asks all anglers to practice Catch and Release to help maintain a healthy fish population.  The ice fishing huts will be available for rent as well as maggots for bait and a small amount of tackle  The vitality of the fishery is a very important aspect of the lake. Without a sustainable fishery both summer and winter fishing activities would not be possible. HCA staff will continue their bi-annual summer assessments at Valens to record population trends as well as assess the health of the fishery.  The HCA would like to thank all of our customers in advance for co-operating with our suggested restrictions. Your assistance will be a great benefit.  As a reminder Valens' lake will remain closed to fishing from April 1st until the 4th Saturday in June 2009. Summer 2009 fishing opportunities will remain open as usual.
