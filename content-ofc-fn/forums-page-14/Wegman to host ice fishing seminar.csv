Mr. Wegman, who writes the Focus on Fishing column, was the 2006 Perch Trap Attack winner and a member of Team Canada during the 1991 World Ice Fishing Championship.  He has taught ice fishing courses at Seneca College since 1987 and also presented his seminars from Sudbury to Toronto and Hamilton to Ottawa.  â€œThis will be the first time we have had the opportunity to host one of them here, thanks to the town and The Georgina Advocate,â€ he said. â€œThe Jackson’s Point venue will be perfect with many avid ice anglers living within a half hour drive.â€  His presentation focuses on ice fishing in Lake Simcoe with emphasis on how to catch more yellow perch, northern pike, whitefish and lake trout.  â€œLake Simcoe is a huge body of water and receives more fishing pressure than any other inland lake in the province,â€ he said.  Draw Prizes will be offered courtesy of HT Enterprises, Rapala/Normark, Berkley/Pure Fishing and Lowrance. Gerry Heels, a Lowrance Electronics rep will be on hand to answer questions about their sonar units and how to maximize their performance during the winter.  Admission is free, but you are asked to bring along a non-perishable food item for the Georgina Food Bank."
