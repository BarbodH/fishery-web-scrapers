So far activity has focused one to three miles off Catawba Island State Park, northeast of Port Clinton, and near Green Island off the west side of South Bass Island.  As always, anglers are warned to beware of treacherous conditions because of isolated areas of poor ice.  The Ohio Division of Wildlife recommends checking with local ice fishing guides and bait shops before heading out on any given day because conditions can change with little notice. Winds can open or widen cracks in ice sheets and current below can eat away at the thickness of ice, causing thin sections that may not seem so from the surface.  At mid week ice did not appear fishable off Crane Creek near Davis-Besse, according to Travis Hartman, a biologist at the state's Lake Erie station at Sandusky. He said that an airboat party reported taking fish west of A-Can this week, but it broke through in some areas. A list of licensed ice guides is available at the Sandusky station by calling 419-625-8062, or visit on-line at ohiodnr.com.  Rick Ferguson has opened Al Szuch Live Bait on Corduroy Road for the ice season, and reports anglers off Catawba taking walleye on Do-Jiggers and Swedish Pimples, dressed with minnows. He said that airboats tried working off Cooley Canal earlier this week but found the ice unstable with too many breakthroughs.  Dick Knitz has taken over operation of the former Zunk's Bait on State Rt. 2, having moved the operation next door from the Zunk shop. For now Dick's Bait will be open weekends. Call 419-972-4002.  Big-water ice fishing action for yellow perch, panfish and walleye also is under way at Mitchell's Bay on the Ontario side of Lake St. Clair, according to the folks at Bass Haven there.
