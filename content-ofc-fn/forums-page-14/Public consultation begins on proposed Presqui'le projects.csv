281495,Spiel,2008-12-19 12:23:00,9065,"Public consultation begins on proposed Presqui'le projects   JOYCE CASSIN / northumberlandtoday.com   Restoring vegetation at Presqu'ile Provincial Park is the plan behind the recent announcement by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). There are two proposed projects at Presqu'ile Provincial Park that include deer and cormorant management plus vegetation restoration on the islands of the park.  Aimed at protecting woodland habitat, Ontario Parks managed double-crested cormorants on High Bluff and Gull Islands at Presqu'ile Provincial Park from 2003 to 2007, with results showing cormorant management was effective in decreasing the damage to woodland habitat and allowing the trees and shrubs to begin to recover.  In 2008 no management occurred and cormorant numbers increased.  According to the MNR, this habitat is important for several rare species of birds, including black-crowned night heron and great egret, as well as monarch butterflies. Habitat for these species is under threat throughout the Great Lakes, according to a statement from the MNR.  A letter to citizens states Ontario Parks has scientifically assessed the results of the previous cormorant management and based on these findings, Ontario Parks has determined that rmorant management is needed on these islands to maintain the woodland habitat.  Ontario Parks is looking at an ecosystem-based implementation plan for the Presqu'ile Islands because the ""ecological integrity of the woodlands has been affected by both deer and cormorants,"" the letter states. Active restoration will enhance the recovery of ecological integrity to these areas, it states in the letter.  Members of the public will have the opportunity to comment under the Class Environmental Assessment for Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves (Class EA). The cormorant management activities of the proposal will be evaluated as a Category C project under the Class EA, which requires the preparation of an Environmental Study Report (ESR), while the deer management and vegetation restoration aspects of the proposal will be evaluated as Category B projects.  The public will be invited to comment on the draft implementation plan and the proposed management activities when the plan is released, after which Ontario Parks will address comments and release the final plan for inspection.  A separate implementation plan for wildlife and vegetation management on the mainland at Presqu'ile will also be prepared. There will also be an opportunity to review and comment on the mainland plan and its proposed activities.  Initial comments regarding this project for the Presqu'ile islands must be received in writing within the 30-day comment period, which expires on Dec. 29.  Comments may be sent to Corina Brdar, Zone Ecologist, Ministry of Natural Resources, Ontario Parks, Southeast Zone, 51 Heakes Lane, Kingston, ON., K7M 9B1 or by fax: 613-536-7228 / Email: [emailÂ protected].  The scientific review of cormorant management can be obtained from the Ontario Parks website via www.ontarioparks.com.  Documents supporting this project will also be available on the Ontario Parks website.  An information notice on this project was posted on the Environmental Registry at the following Web address: www.ene.gov.on.ca.  For more information or to request further notice please contact Ms. Brdar at 613-545- 4034."
