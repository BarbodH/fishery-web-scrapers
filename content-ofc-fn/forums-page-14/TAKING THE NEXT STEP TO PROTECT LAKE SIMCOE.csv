The draft protection plan represents the next step in protecting Lake Simcoe and follows the passage of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act on December 10, 2008. Building on Ontario’s watershed-protection approach in the Clean Water Act, the new act requires the province to establish a protection plan for the lake and surrounding areas. The draft Lake Simcoe Protection Plan is the most comprehensive watershed-based legislated plan in Canada. The draft plan is based on advice from the Lake Simcoe science and stakeholder advisory committees and from the people who live and work around Lake Simcoe.  The draft plan proposes voluntary and mandatory measures to restore and protect the ecological health of Lake Simcoe and its watershed starting with the most critical areas:  - Improving water quality by curbing the amount of phosphorus entering the lake and reducing the lake’s current excessive phosphorus levels to 44 tonnes a year  - Protecting and rehabilitating fish habitat, wetlands, woodlands and the vegetation that buffer the lake, rivers and streams  - Managing the potential impacts of climate change and invasive species.  Going forward the plan would not be applied to existing developments or development proposals that have already obtained significant development approvals.  The Ontario government has also committed $20 million over four years to help protect Lake Simcoe through research, monitoring and on-farm stewardship activities.  QUOTES  “The approach we are taking is intended to ensure the long-term health of the lake and its watershed ecosystem,” said Environment Minister John Gerretsen. “We need everyone from around the lake to participate in this process and make this plan work so that future generations can continue to enjoy this wonderful resource,” he added.  QUICK FACTS  Human activities have been affecting the Lake Simcoe ecosystem for more than 200 years. Lake Simcoe’s watershed crosses 23 municipal boundaries including Barrie, parts of York and Durham regions, Kawartha Lakes and Simcoe County.  Thirty-five rivers flow into Lake Simcoe including the Holland River, Black River, Beaver River, Pefferlaw River and Uxbridge Brook.   LEARN MORE Learn more about protecting Lake Simcoe.
