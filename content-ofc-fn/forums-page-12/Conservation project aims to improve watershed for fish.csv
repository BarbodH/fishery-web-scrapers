It was a female clearing away sediment to lay her eggs.  When the eggs were laid, he said, male trout were quick to fertilize them. It was nature at work and Penman was amazed.  This natural act impressed upon the Conservation Halton (CH) chair the value of a $260,000, two-year project to help restore and rehabilitate part of Bronte Creek, meandering through Burlington’s Lowville Park, with the goal of making the watershed healthier for trout to thrive.  Last Monday morning, the project — a partnership between CH, Trout Unlimited Canada (TU) and the City of Burlington — was officially unveiled with an emphasis placed on how important an indicator trout are to the health and vibrancy of the creek.  Trout love cold, clean water and that starts with clear groundwater that feeds into creeks and streams. If the trout population is low — particularly brook trout — that is an indication something is amiss and needs fixing.  In Bronte Creek, small dams are popping up and causing water to pool and heat up.  Jack Imhof, a University of Guelph biologist and representing TU, said a healthy creek should have around 60-80 lbs. of trout per acre and he estimates Bronte Creek has around 15-20 lbs.  “Watersheds are the natural infrastructure in Canada,” he told the crowd at CH’s head office on Britannia Road earlier this week. “Bronte Creek is running a fever. It’s basically ill and in need of help.”  Citing concerns about creek bank erosion and warming water, among other issues, TU — a three-decade-old volunteer, not-for-profit conservation organization — is working with the city and other groups to improve the sustainability of a portion of Bronte Creek.  TU, with a mission to ensure viability of cold-water streams and creeks, has chapters located throughout Canada including 17 in Ontario. The Ted Knott Chapter has adopted the Bronte Creek watershed as its home watershed and meets regularly out of Conservation Halton’s offices.  TU has access to an historic air photo which indicates Bronte Creek, through portions of Lowville Park, has widened substantially over long periods, degrading overall environmental health.  The funding is shared by the Ontario Trillium Foundation ($126,000) and the city ($100,000) with TU providing the rest.  Said Councillor John Taylor, whose ward includes Lowville Park: “The City of Burlington is awakening to environmental consciousness.”  Through discussions with city staff, TU has said it is interested in renewal work, first on public lands and later expanding to initiatives on private property.  At this point, TU is envisioning environmental improvements in Lowville Park would be implemented in 2009-10 and then focus on work on private property from 2011-13.  Riparian areas or zones — land areas next to streams/creeks identified by the presence of unique vegetation requiring large amounts of water — would be targeted for improvement.  The restoration of these areas will help support fish habitat by providing shade, cover, food and nutrients, as well as help to maintain water quality and moderate flows and temperatures that are critical for healthy fish habitat and overall watershed health, stated a staff report.  The work is intended to start as soon as possible, Imhof said in an interview.  For example, what could happen is specific rocks would be placed along the creek banks to help narrow them to make them cooler, as a means to kick-start a naturalization of the creek beds.  Workshops will be held to inform landowners of the project.  Penman said after the press conference the participation of private landowners as creek stewards is key.  Through other ecologically-friendly works completed, more than 70 property owners have already been recognized for protecting the natural environment along the Bronte Creek watershed, according to a CH news release."
