328806,Spiel,2009-04-11 09:27:00,9059,"Boating forecast 'cautiously optimistic' LEISURE: Economy hurting, but gas prices are low and water levels up   April 10, 2009 DAN MCCAFFERY / www.theobserver.ca   As summer grows close, many people in Bluewaterland will be turning their attention to boating.  And although some marina operators and local boaters are anticipating a slower than normal boating season, largely the result of the economic recession, it's not all doom and gloom.  ""Despite the economic tsunami -- and that's basically what we're in -- there are a number of fundamental reasons why I'm cautiously optimistic,"" said Dave Brown, who is involved in the operations of four marinas in Sarnia, Point Edward and Port Huron.  Brown pointed out the price of fuel has dropped dramatically this year. So much so, in fact, that a boater who had to spend about $500 to make a trip to a place like Bayfield, can now do it for approximately $300, he said.  Brown, who is the managing partner and operator of Bridgeview Marina in Point Edward and Sarnia Bay Marina, said a strong U. S. dollar will help those facilities this summer.  And higher water levels will also aid those marinas, as well as the two he's involved with as the director of marina operations for Acheson Ventures in Port Huron.  ""Water levels are going to be 10 to 12 inches higher this year, and that provides a comfort zone for boaters. People won't have to worry about hitting anything by the shore.""  Still, Brown knows tough economic times mean he can't just sit back and wait for boaters to come to him. ""It's important in the economic environment that we're in to be really aggressive,"" he said. ""We're not just sitting here waiting for the phones to ring. We're making presentations to boat clubs in the states. I'm involved in all four marinas in Port Huron and Sarnia and we're promoting the entire region as a premier boating destination. If we can get them here, they're going to be faced with an incredible welcoming mat.""  Some marina operators and local boaters are anticipating a slower than normal boating season because many people are wary of spending money on non-essentials.  ""The biggest concern I have is the loss of jobs and the ability for people to have discretionary income to go boating,"" said Chester Kolascz, owner of Port Sanilac Marina, north of Port Huron on the Michigan side of Lake Huron.  He said forecasting a boat season is ""very unpredictable."" But he added slow sales of new and used boats are somewhat troubling.  At the Belle River Marina in Marine City, across the St. Clair River from Sombra, longtime owner Walter Dunn said his expectations are not high. ""We'll have to take it as it comes, but I'm not expecting anything real great,"" he said."
