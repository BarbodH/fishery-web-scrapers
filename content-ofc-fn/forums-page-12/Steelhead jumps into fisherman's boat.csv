But that really happened Sunday, according to Jim Toteff of Kalama.  Toteff reported that his friend J.R. Taylor of Longview, Taylor’s son-in-law Matt Holde and 7-year-old grandson Braden were fishing on Kress Lake.  “A lot of fish were jumping,” Toteff said. “One fish jumped about three times and the third time it landed in the boat.”  The surprised fishermen returned the 10-pound steelhead into the lake, but eventually reeled in eight trout.  “Forever, Braden will remember the day fishing with his Grandpa,” Toteff said.  The Department of Fish and Wildlife has planted 200 surplus winter steelhead in Kress, along with 4,500 catchable-sized rainbow trout since April 24, so angling should still be good, even if you have to actually hook the fish to catch them."
