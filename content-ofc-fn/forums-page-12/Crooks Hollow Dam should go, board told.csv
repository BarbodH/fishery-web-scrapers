325316,Spiel,2009-04-02 12:41:00,9065,"Crooks Hollow Dam should go, board told   Apr 2, 2009 / The Hamilton Spectator   GREENSVILLE Hamilton Conservation Authority officials are urging the authority's board to stick with its decision to remove most of the crumbling Crooks Hollow Dam on Spencer Creek.  Prompted by opposition that grew after an environmental assessment was conducted, Flamborough Councillor Robert Pasuta convinced other board members last month to ask staff for an updated report.  Kathy Menyes, director of watershed planning and engineering, says in the report e-mailed to board members Monday that repairing the 96-year-old dam and removing sediment behind it would cost at least $400,000 more than removing the concrete structure.  Menyes notes the plan is supported by Trout Unlimited, the Royal Botanical Gardens and the Ministry of Natural Resources.  The report will be considered at a 7 p.m. meeting today at the authority's headquarters, 838 Mineral Springs Rd., in Ancaster."
