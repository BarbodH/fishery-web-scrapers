328812,Spiel,2009-04-11 10:11:00,9065,"Dye tracer testing near Fergus may turn Grand River red   April 07, 2009 / www.grandriver.ca   Over the next few weeks, officials from the Township of Centre Wellington’s Public Works Department, in partnership with the Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA), will place a safe, environmentally-friendly, ""fluorescing"" dye into the Grand River between the Shand Dam and Fergus, temporarily giving the river a red tint. The study is part of a Ministry of the Environment funded program to assess the vulnerability of municipal drinking water supplies.  The undertaking is known as a ""dye tracer test"" – a common way to determine the travel time in watercourses to protect drinking water supply intakes. During the test, the dye will be injected into the river at several locations and the travel time and dye dilution will be measured at downstream locations. The test may appear to turn the watercourses red temporarily where the dye is placed. It will dilute quickly as it moves downstream, eventually becoming invisible.  The dye tracer testing is one component of a series of municipal drinking water supply source protection studies the Township and GRCA are completing in support of the Province’s Clean Water Act.
