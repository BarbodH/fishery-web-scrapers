321243,TJQ,2009-03-24 15:26:00,7803,"O.F.A.H. Applauds Prime Minister's Comments Keynote Speech at O.F.A.H. Conference strongly supports  Outdoor Community  The Ontario Federation of  Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.), the largest non-profit conservation based  organization in Ontario, was delighted to welcome the Right Honourable Stephen  Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, to the O.F.A.H. 81st Annual General Meeting  and Fish & Wildlife Conference in Mississauga on Saturday March 21, 2009.  ""The outdoor community across Canada contributes billions each year to  the national economy, which helps to create jobs, supports local economies and  funds conservation programs for fish and wildlife,"" said O.F.A.H. Executive  Director, Mike Reader. ""A strong partnership between the outdoor community and  the federal government is critical for the development and delivery of core  programs in support of these activities. It was clear in his speech to almost  600 conference and youth delegates, that the Prime Minister has a real  understanding of the contributions that wildlife federations across the country  make to the restoration, conservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife  species. We also appreciated the Prime Minister's continued support for  scrapping the badly flawed long gun registry and his government's attempts to  deal with the root causes of crime which has nothing to do with legal, licensed,  law-abiding hunters, farmers and recreational sport shooters.""  Mr.  Reader also noted that the vast majority of public opinion polls over the last  four years, including the most recent one taken by City Pulse News in Toronto,  have demonstrated that the general public favors elimination of the long gun  registry and recognizes that it has done nothing to enhance public safety.  The hundreds of delegates attending the Conference, some from as far  away as Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia, enjoyed a diverse program  featuring workshops and presentations on timely issues like the provincial moose  review; hydro-electric power, species restoration and the future of hunting and  fishing, highlighted by the Prime Minister's appearance.  With over  100,000 members and supporters and 655 member clubs across the province, the  O.F.A.H., through partnerships with wildlife federations and outdoor  organizations across Canada, and communications vehicles like Ontario OUT OF  DOORS magazine and Angler & Hunter Television, is the voice of  anglers and hunters in Ontario."
