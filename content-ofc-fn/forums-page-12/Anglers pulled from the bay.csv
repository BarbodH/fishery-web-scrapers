Barrie city police said the men went out in their 16-foot bass boat at about 4:30 p.m.  One lost his balance and went overboard. While trying to get back into the boat, a large wave hit the vessel and it took on water.  The boat capsized and both men went into the drink.  The police marine unit located the two and plucked them safely from the seven-degree-Celsius water. The boat was towed to a local marina.  Police are reminding boaters the water is still cold, conditions can be rough at this time of year and that life jackets save lives."
