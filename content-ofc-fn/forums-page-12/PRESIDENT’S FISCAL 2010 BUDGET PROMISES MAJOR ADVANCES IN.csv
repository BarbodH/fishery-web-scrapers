342080,Spiel,2009-05-16 12:29:00,9065," PRESIDENT’S FISCAL 2010 BUDGET PROMISES MAJOR ADVANCES IN GREAT LAKES RESTORATION   Congress Urged to Fund President Obama’s “Great Lakes Restoration Initiative”    For Immediate Release May 14, 2009 / www.glfc.org   ANN ARBOR, MI—The Great Lakes Fishery Commission today joined conservation groups, government agencies, industry, and non-governmental organizations in praising President Barack Obama’s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a major proposal to better address some of the Great Lakes basin’s most pressing needs. The initiative, included in the president’s fiscal 2010 budget, will direct badly needed funds toward areas such as invasive species, habitat restoration, water quality improvement, and native species recovery. The funds, if appropriated by Congress, would support many restoration proposals put forward by the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration initiative and are designed to be the “down payment” in achieving measurable improvements in the Great Lakes ecosystem.  “Thousands of citizens and governmental officials participated in the development of a comprehensive recovery plan for the Great Lakes,” said David Ullrich, Executive Director of the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Cities Initiative, and U.S. Section Chair of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We are gratified that President Obama is truly interested in fulfilling his promise to protect and restore the Great Lakes, a national treasure that provides millions of the basin’s citizens with income, recreation, drinking water, and aesthetic beauty.”  Ullrich continued: “President Obama’s proposal will direct funds toward carefully considered recommendations to address such problems as invasive species, non-point source pollution, native species restoration, and toxic contamination. The president’s proposal—which consists of $475 million for Great Lakes recovery—will allow us to tackle some of the most pressing problems the region faces.”  Ullrich continued: “Investments in the Great Lakes make sense economically and environmentally. Studies have shown that every dollar invested in recovery will result in at least two dollars in economic return. Moreover, the ecological benefits of restoration are immeasurable. The president’s budget acknowledges that Great Lakes restoration is a crucial component of the effort to protect and improve the nation’s natural resources. Ecological recovery means economic recovery and such actions greatly improve the quality of life in the region.”  The president’s proposal requires approval by Congress. Ullrich concluded: “The Great Lakes Fishery Commission is extremely pleased with the president’s proposal and looks forward to working with other agencies and private organizations in fulfilling the many high-priority recommendations developed through the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration’s planning process. The commission hopes Congress will act swiftly on the president’s proposal so that the revitalized process of restoring the Great Lakes can begin immediately.”    Contact: Dr. Marc Gaden 734-417-8012"
