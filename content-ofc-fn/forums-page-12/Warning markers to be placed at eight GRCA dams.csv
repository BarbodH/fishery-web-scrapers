339918,Spiel,2009-05-10 13:42:00,9059,"Warning markers to be placed at eight GRCA dams   May 06, 2009 / www.grandriver.ca   The Grand River Conservation Authority is installing warning markers upstream of dams on the Grand, Nith and Speed rivers to provide additional notice to canoeists and kayakers to stay away from the dams.  Installation is planned for these dates, although the scheduled is subject to change due to weather conditions:  The buoys are marked with a bright red diamond, which is an international warning symbol for boaters. They are in addition to existing warning and portage signs. The number of buoys at each dam depends on the width of the river.  The boom at Drimmie Dam spans the river and consists of floats linked together with a chain.  These dams are ""run of the river"" or ""low head"" dams. The water upstream of the dams can be still and placid, but the area downstream can be dangerous. Strong currents at the base of the dam can capsize a canoe or kayak and trap the occupant underwater.  Buoys or booms have already been put in place at other GRCA dams: Rockwood, Conestogo, Woolwich, Shand and Guelph.  For more information on river flows, see the River Data of the GRCA web site.
