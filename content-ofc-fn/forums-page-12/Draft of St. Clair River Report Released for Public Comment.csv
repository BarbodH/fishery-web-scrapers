The report answers important questions posed by the International Joint Commission (IJC) regarding the St. Clair River system:  The Study Board will be providing in-depth briefings and receiving comments at 14 public meetings throughout the upper Great Lakes basin in May and June. The schedule for these public meeting can be found on the Study’s Web site. Written comments can also be provided via the Study’s Web site.  After incorporating public comments and the results of additional research, the Study Board will finalize the report for transmission to the IJC in the fall of 2009.  Funded equally by the U.S. and Canadian governments, the Study is being conducted by the bi-national, independent International Upper Great Lakes Study Board at the request of the IJC under the authority of the Boundary Waters Treaty. This draft report is the first output of the Study. This study will continue to examine whether the regulation plan for outflows from Lake Superior through the compensating works and power dams on the St. Marys River at Sault Ste. Marie might be improved to take into consideration changing interests and changing climate. The final report of the Study is expected early in 2012."
