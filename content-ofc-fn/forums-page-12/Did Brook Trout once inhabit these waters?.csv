March 6, 2009 BOB LIDDYCOAT / ww.dunnvillechronicle.com    It may not be the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot but the search is on to find proof of a creature, now the mere subject of fishing lore, which once swam in Mill Creek just west of Cayuga.  Habitat Haldimand is looking for anyone who has documented evidence the increasingly rare Brook Trout did indeed once occupy the cold water tributary that feeds the Grand River.  In the 1960s the stream was dammed up to create an interpretive centre known as Taquanyah. That created a shallow warm lake, which is not a favourable environment for Brook Trout.  Eventually, Taquanyah was all but abandoned until members of Habitat Haldimand decided to reverse the neglect and restore the natural and environmental educational opportunities that exist there.  Wade Dowling, chair of Habitat Haldimand, told the Chronicle they began a partnership with the Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA) back in 1999 to reopen the centre.  ""Since then, a lot of work has been done at the Taquanyah Centre. We began by cleaning up the trails and planting trees and opening it for use as a nature centre to students,"" he said. ""All students from various school boards and Six Nations are welcome.""  But Bill Christmas, president of the Ted Knott Chapter of Trout Unlimited Canada, saw a new opportunity.  ""When I moved to the area about six years ago I noticed the possibility that Mill Creek would be a good trout stream. When they dammed the stream back in the 1960s it was one of the classic errors they often made 30 or 40 years ago,"" Christmas told the Chronicle.  He explained that, by doing so, they created a wetland but also destroyed the ecosystem that was already in place. ""They liked to dam up streams and make interpretive centres back then,"" he said. ""But by the time I came along, Habitat Haldimand was already in the process of taking out the dam. I discovered Mill Creek is a natural cold stream and thought it might be perfect for Brook Trout.""  No Trout are present now but about four years ago he worked along with Habitat Haldimand and many volunteers to reestablish the natural channel and get the stream flowing again eliminating the shallow lake which had been created.  Now they want to introduce Brook Trout into the stream as it has potential to be a perfect habitat for them in terms of constant cool temperatures and natural gravel bottom for spawning.  But the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) will not allow that to happen unless a complete environmental assessment is done to prove there is a great potential for success.  However, the Ministry will speed up the process if documented proof can be presented that Trout flourished there previously. Such evidence could eliminate the need for a lengthy and expensive study.  ""There are stories of people catching Brook Trout (or Speckled Trout) before the dam was built but nothing that can be considered documented proof has surfaced so far,"" said Christmas. ""There are lots of stories of people who say dad, or granddad caught trout there but we haven't been able to document it at the libraries or museums or newspapers. People like Mike Pettigrew at Caledonia Bait and Tackle tell us they've heard the stories.""  Now Habitat Haldimand is trying to get the word out to residents or former anglers in the area to come forward with anything they might consider proof that Brook Trout once flourished in the stream.  Christmas is convinced the stream will be perfect. ""Mill Creek is spring-fed so keeps a constant cool temperature, at around eight or nine degrees Celsius, and it flows all year round and there are natural spawning habitats already there,"" he explained. ""The MNR and GRCA were surprised by the amount of water coming from the stream,"" he added.  ""Brook Trout are like the canary in a coal mine. If you have them, you know you have a healthy stream because they require clean, cold water, oxygen and no pollution. They are the first to die off when anything goes wrong,"" he said. ""They die off when the water becomes stagnant and warm and you get carp and other bottom-feeders instead.""  ""And, said Christmas, ""They proliferate quickly, stay in the area, are easy to catch and put up a good fight. Fishermen love them. Of course, it will be a catch and release area.""  Christmas explained the Brook Trout are a self-producing species. ""You don't have to stock them anymore. They thrive at a very low cost. All you need is a little common sense and a lot of volunteer labour. By comparison, hatchery fish have a 90 per cent mortality rate so you have to stock every year. But if you take fish, like Brook Trout, from a wild environment, they reproduce on their own.""  The work done by Habitat Haldimand has also created a buffer zone from contaminants. They built fences along the stream to keep cattle out and stabilized the banks to prevent erosion. And four years ago they dug out the channel to allow the cold stream to flow along its natural course.  Wildlife existing in the shallow lake was moved into the Grand River so nothing was destroyed. Habitat Haldimand has planted more than 1,000 trees that will also provide shade to the stream.  ""The neighbours have been fantastic. They were on board right away and helped with the work, fencing and bank stabilization,"" said Dowling. ""They were into it right away. They knew what we were talking about.""  Christmas agreed. ""I have been doing this kind of work for many years and these are the best landowners I've ever encountered,"" he said.  In fact, among other projects, he has worked on 22 streams across the northern part of Lake Ontario in re-introducing Atlantic Salmon to the area. ""They've been gone for over 100 years but the program has been a huge success,"" he said. Some of those projects were very large and expensive.  At Mill Creek, volunteers have been doing the work, ""So it isn't expensive at all,"" Christmas noted.  ""For example,"" Christmas said, ""The 4H Club is now involved. They're really dedicated to helping with the stream.""  The Caledonia Hunters and Anglers and students from Niagara College have also been involved. ""We've got an amazing network of young, local, educated people who are helping. The younger generation has latched on to this and are trying to undo the damage we've done to Mother Nature over the years,"" offered Christmas.  ""Right now, we've got all the stuff in place to get trout into the stream. And I think you will see Steelhead and Rainbow Trout migrating to the stream as well,"" he speculated.  The Ministry will have final say if stocking of the stream goes ahead. But Christmas and Dowling are certain that documented proof of Brook Trout once populating the stream will go a long way to speeding up the approval process. ""Without proof we will be looking at least another year before getting permission to move ahead,"" said Christmas. ""With proof we could be stocking the stream by September.""  Christmas added, ""Our (the TUC) mission statement is to preserve and protect clearwater streams in Canada and if there ever was an example of it, it would be to take this stream, which had been destroyed 40 years ago, and wind back the environmental clock.""  Anyone who can provide proof that Brook Trout (Speckled Trout) once swam in the waters of Mill Creek can contact Bill Christmas at 905-765-2720."
