382134,Spiel,2009-09-11 12:15:00,9065,"Tribes retrieve lost nets from Lake Superior   Sept. 7, 2009 / www.great-lakes.org   Houghton, MI â€“ Tribal wardens Dan North and Jim Stone successfully retrieved about 3,000' of gill net aboard the enforcement vessel Mizhakwad in June. They were removed from Lake Superior in the Houghton area. The nets, of unknown origin, appeared to have been in the lake for a period of years, according to GLIFWC Enforcement Chief Fred Maulson. Most nets were ""extremely deteriorated,"" the contents rotten, and no identification tags were found.  An angler reported the nets and provided GPS coordinates for their locations. Once at the GPS location, wardens deployed a large metal drag with multiple hooks, pulling the drag across the lake bottom in grids around their marker. Once a net was hooked, the net-lifter was used to pull up the drag and the net.  Following up on another complaint about possible ""ghost"" nets, GLIFWC wardens along with staff from the Michigan DNR, searched for nets in the Marquette area this summer as well. The complaint had also included GPS coordinates. Searchers completed a grid check and patrolled the area, but no nets were found."
