James Hammond was fined $200 for fishing without a licence, $1,000 for making a false statement and $500 for displaying a void (altered) licence.  The court heard that on June 6, 2009 a conservation officer checked three men fishing from a boat on Jackâ€™s Lake near Apsley. When asked to produce fishing licences, only one man had his licence. The other men stated they had fishing licences but were not carrying them. When warned of the seriousness of making false statements, one of the men admitted he did not have a licence and was issued a ticket. Hammond insisted he had a licence and was given time to provide a copy of it to the officer.  The officer subsequently received a copy which showed it had been purchased on June 2, four days prior to being checked. Investigation revealed the licence had actually been purchased on June 12 and altered.  Justice of the Peace Peter Hiscox heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Peterborough, on August 13, 2009.
