The goal is to reduce the number of fish dying after swimming into the plant’s water intake pipe. It will be a 610-metre long mesh net with half-inch openings.  Residents may have seen divers working on the project outside the plant in recent weeks.  “Work began on that in mid-July and it’s almost completed now,” said Pickering A senior vice-president Mark Elliott. The netting itself will be added in October once the other parts are in place.  Boaters will be warned by 19 lighted buoys about the netting, which is located 77 metres out from the intake.  “They’re asked to say stay well clear of that,” said Mr. Elliott. OPG plans to issue reminders about the net each spring when boating season kicks off."
