366082,Spiel,2009-07-25 14:41:00,9059,"Pflueger Arbor Combo Walks Away With Best Of Award At 2009 ICAST Showcase   July 20, 2009 / www.great-lakes.org   Designed to handle today's superlines, the Pflueger Arbor Combo has won the ICAST show Best Combo Award.  With the introduction of the new Pflueger Arbor spinning reel, it became apparent the reel needed a special rod to benefit from the reel's oversized spool. Not just any spinning rod would do. The result is a perfectly matched and balanced rod and reel combination that takes advantage of the reel's design and purpose.  ""We designed this rod n' reel combo to fish the new generation superlines,"" said Andrew Wheeler, Pflueger Product Manager. ""Whether an angler decides to throw the fluorocarbon or braided lines the Arbor's larger design is the perfect. The rod was custom built to take full advantage of the many benefits of the Pflueger Arbor.""  The Arbor reel is highlighted with an oversized, large arbor spool, which winds the line on to the reel in larger loops. With 7 stainless steel ball bearings, the reel is smooth on the retrieve. Made with a hybrid aluminum construction the reel is lightweight. An oversized carbon fiber washer manages the sealed drag system. Additional features include a graphite rotor, Sure-Click bail and solid aluminum bail wire.  For the rod, Pflueger started with a one-piece IM-8 graphite blank for its lightweight and enhanced sensitivity. To complement the line coming off the reel's oversized spool, the Large Arbor Guide Concept system was developed. This includes a larger stripper guide that is reversed. This reduces line buildup before the front guide during casting.  The remaining guides are also oversized to keep the line moving freely and are made from durable stainless steel. The cork handle split grip design provides a comfortable command of the combo and the graphite reel seat holds the Arbor reel securely to the rod.  Two models are available; the Arbor 7430 reel is matched with the 6'6"" Arbor medium-light action rod. The Arbor 7440 reel comes on the 7'0"" Arbor medium action rod. MSRP for the Pflueger Arbor Combo is $99.95."
