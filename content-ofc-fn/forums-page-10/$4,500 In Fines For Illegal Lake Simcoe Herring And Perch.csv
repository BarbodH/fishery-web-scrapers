Nicola Pertosa and Saverio Zupo, both of Stouffville, and Angela Zupo, of Goodwood, were each fined $750 for taking herring during a closed season and $250 for having too many perch. They were also fined $500 for making a false statement to a conservation officer.  On January 25, 2009, during a patrol of ice fishing activities on Lake Simcoe, Aurora District conservation officers checked the group who were fishing with conservation licences. The group claimed to have their legal limit of 75 perch, plus a lake trout. The officers discovered a total of 100 perch, as well as nine herring â€“ a species that is closed to fishing on Lake Simcoe.  Justice of the Peace Ronald Prestage heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Newmarket, on July 10, 2009.
