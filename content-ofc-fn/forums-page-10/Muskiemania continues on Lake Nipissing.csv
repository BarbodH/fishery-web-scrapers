Photo: http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1718351  Muskiemania continues on Lake Nipissing Posted By NUGGET STAFF Posted 3 hours ago   Mark Stewart, right, and Stephen Beale were fishing on Lake Nipissing Saturday when Stewart landed a 55-inch muskie weighing about 45 pounds just south of Chaput Island. He hooked it on eight-pound test line and a spinner bait at about 9:20 a.m. and they landed it at 10 a.m. After taking a few pictures, they released the fish for someone else to catch."

377149,Roy,2009-08-27 17:02:00,13728,"6'7""  nice fish."
377156,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-27 17:16:00,1022,He must of had a heck of alot of line on that spool since he didn't get spooled.
377160,bluesky1713,2009-08-27 17:22:00,107,This is the second monster muskie caught by a non-muskie angler out of Nipissing in the last month or so.  Would have been funny to watch him try to get the fish into that net.
377166,NAW,2009-08-27 17:38:00,4022,"Set the hook at 9:20, and didn't land it untill 10:00.  That's a long fight!"
377169,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-27 17:47:00,1022, That's a long fight!  What suprises me is that the fish had the strength for that long. Goes to show their healthy up there I guess.
377175,BillM,2009-08-27 18:16:00,17365,After 40 mins I bet that fish is belly up somewhere...
377185,NAW,2009-08-27 18:35:00,4022,  That's what I was thinkin!  But what do I know??  I've only cought one Ski before..
377187,bigfish1965,2009-08-27 18:41:00,3382," Yup...especially after that nice hold... But, caught on 8 pound test...chances of survival are not that good. Not much you can do though when you are tossing spinner baits for smallies and a monster musky grabs on."
377204,kickingfrog,2009-08-27 20:13:00,8332," That's a long fight!  That's nothin'. Read Bly's post, 4.5 hours... standing!!!"
377205,kickingfrog,2009-08-27 20:16:00,8332,"But, caught on 8 pound test...chances of survival are not that good. Not much you can do though when you are tossing spinner baits for smallies and a monster musky grabs on.   No win situation. If he keeps it, he gets ripped. He lets it go... well... maybe it survives."
377208,bigfish1965,2009-08-27 20:37:00,3382,"Rock, meet hard place....no doubt, kickingfrog. Unfortunate, but it does happen."
377218,richyb,2009-08-27 21:00:00,774,Chances are the fight wasnt a very stressful one since he couldnt have put on much pressure using 8lb . Likely more of just a big ski swimming all lazy and a guy with 8lb mono just holding onto the rod and letting the ski do its thing.  Sweet fish !
377228,splashhopper,2009-08-27 21:29:00,2931, That's a long fight!   He only had 8lb test on....... likely fought it like us trout guys do... vs the muskie dudes and their rope !
377245,BillM,2009-08-27 22:16:00,17365,"Let's hope she is still swimming.  It would be interesting to see how long it took them to revive her..  Good thing about 8lb test, she didn't have to do much work to either snap the line or make the drag scream."
