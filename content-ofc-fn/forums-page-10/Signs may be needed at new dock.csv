Councillor Ernie Cybulski reported to his fellow councillors that people are fishing from the dock while swimmers are in the water. Councillor Carl Kuehl then brought up the issue of people diving into the shallow water from the dock and wondered if signs, indicating “no diving” and “no fishing,” should be mounted at the site.  Councillor Kathy Marion said there were “No Fishing” signs at the single-lane Tramore bridge, but they have had no effect.  “At times you can hardly get across the bridge with people fishing,” she said.  Cybulski’s comment that bicyclists have also been spotted on the dock prompted Kuehl to jokingly respond, “No diving, no fishing, no bicycles, no people, no boats.”  Cybulski said there is already a “Use at your own risk” sign in place, and Marion said most fishers would not “fire a fish hook into the water where swimmers are.”  Kuehl said he would check to see what signage Madawaska Valley has at its Barry’s Bay boat launch.  In other council news, Councillor Cybulski said some ratepayers have difficulty getting to the municipal office during office hours to pay their tax bills; he wondered if a mail slot could be installed.  CAO/Clerk Lorna Hudder told council many ratepayers pay their taxes online, at banks or by mail. Kuehl wondered where it could be placed, since the building holds more than the municipal offices. Security was another issue, as was the cost to install a slot.  Councillor Isabel O’Reilly announced that the late Father Archie Afelskie left $5,000 to the Killaloe Public Library in his will. Cybulski suggested a plaque be put up acknowledging the generous donation; the proposal will be brought up at the September meeting of the library board.  Pat MacMunn attended last week’s council meeting to determine what decision had been made about waste management. She said she missed the public discussion (held on Aug. 8) and had heard several rumours. Councillors Debbie Peplinskie and Cybulski assured her that nothing would be decided until all the information gleaned from questionnaires was compiled and presented to the public at a meeting in October.  “By then we will have an overview of what the people want,” said Cybulski.  MacMunn said one of the rumours going around was the provincial government had decreed the waste site null and void. Cybulski assured her this was not the case.  “We have three years left at the Killaloe site – that’s why we need a long-term plan,” said Cybulski. “We don’t want to get into an emergency situation.”  Also attending last week’s council meeting was Darren Knowles. He said he’d purchased cable assets of Vic Communications from the bank, but is now unable to get into the building on Water Street because the locks have been changed. This means he can’t solve customer complaints. Peplinskie said the municipality had just received correspondence from its solicitor, but council had not had time to study it. Since the next regular meeting is Sept. 1, Knowles agreed to return at that time for council’s decision on the matter."
