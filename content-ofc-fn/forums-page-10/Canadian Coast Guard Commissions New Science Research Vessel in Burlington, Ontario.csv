The ceremony was held at the Canadian Centre of Inland Waters, where it will be based to support researchers from Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada gathering information about the biological, chemical and physical properties of Canada’s Great Lakes.  “As stewards of some of the greatest freshwater resources in the world, we are committed to understanding and protecting the Great Lakes.” said Minister Shea. “Having this state-of-the-art research vessel dedicated to our Great Lakes will greatly enhance our scientific understanding of issues affecting Canada’s inland waters.”  “The Coast Guard has a longstanding history in Burlington, and throughout the region,” said MP Young. “Our Government is proud to have the Kelso serve in making a new contribution to the community and to Canadian science. We are confident the vessel will help our Coast Guard continue to perform at the high level of service that all have come to expect.”  The vessel, classified as a Near Shore Fisheries Research Vessel, has been in service since June 2009, and will assume the duties of the soon-to-be-retired CCGS Shark. CCGS Kelso is named after the late Dr. John Kelso, a Canadian scientist for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, who dedicated his life to advancing freshwater science.  Also attending was the Deputy Commissioner, Capt. René Grenier of the Canadian Coast Guard. The vessel was dedicated by Dr. Kelso’s widow, Mrs. Donna Kelso."
