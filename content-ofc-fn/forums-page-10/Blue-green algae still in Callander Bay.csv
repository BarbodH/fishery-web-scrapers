Use an alternate source of water for these purposes.  · NOTE: Boiling the water or using home water treatment devices will NOT destroy the toxins.  The Municipality of Callander is cooperating fully with the Ministry of the Environment and the Health Unit and the operator of Callander’s water treatment plant continues to take appropriate steps to keep the municipal water supply safe.  There is always the risk that toxins could be produced by the blue-green algae, although it may not show the presence of toxins. These toxins may stay in the water for up to three weeks after the algae bloom has disappeared.  More information about Blue-Green Algae can be found at www.healthunit.biz in the HOT TOPICS box. The Health Unit will provide further information as it becomes available.   ******    FACTS ON BLUE-GREEN ALGAE  What is it?  Blue-green algae, known as ‘pond scum’, are primitive microscopic bacteria that live in fresh water. They are usually hard to see, but during hot weather, they can rapidly grow to form a large mass, called a bloom.  Why is an algae bloom a problem?  Toxins can irritate the skin and, if ingested, cause diarrhea and vomiting. At high enough levels, the toxins may cause liver and nervous system damage.  Where is it found?  Blue-green algae thrive in warm, shallow, undisturbed water that receives a lot of sunlight and is rich in phosphorus and nitrogen. Animal and human waste and fertilizers contain phosphorus and nitrogen.  What causes it?  Blue-green algae blooms are most often the result of agricultural runoff, lawn fertilizers and improperly located septic systems. These cause increased amounts phosphorus and nitrogen to enter lakes and streams that provide nutrients.  What to do:  If you see what you think is an algae bloom, take the precautions below and call the Ministry of Environment Spills Action Centre at 1-800-268-6060. · Avoid using the water for drinking, bathing, or showering. · Do not allow children, pets, or livestock to swim in the water or drink the water. · If skin contact does occur, wash with soap and water or rinse thoroughly with clean water to remove algae. · Do not boil the water because boiling it may release more toxins into the water. · Don’t cook with the water because food may absorb toxins from the water during cooking. · Do not treat the water with a disinfectant like bleach. This may break open algae cells and release toxins into the water. · Be cautious about eating fish caught in water where blue-green algae blooms occur. Do not eat the liver, kidneys, or other organs of fish caught in the water. · Do not rely on water jug filtration systems, as they do not protect against the toxins.   Related Story"
