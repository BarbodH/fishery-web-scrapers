The Family Fish Co. Ltd., which owns a Lake Erie commercial fishing licence, has been fined $1150. The captain of the commercial fishing vessel Mummery Bros., John Lablance, 38, of Wallaceburg, has been fined $2300. The seized gill nets are forfeited to the Crown.  On July 25, 2007, conservation officers were inspecting commercial fishing vessels in the Erieau harbour, on Lake Erie when they discovered 19 illegally undersized gill nets on the Mummery Bros. The legal minimum size of 57 millimetres (2¼ inches) is used to selectively harvest yellow perch of marketable size which have spawned at least once. Minimum mesh size and quotas help maintain healthy yellow perch stocks on Lake Erie.  Justice of the Peace Calvin Hurst heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Chatham, on January 31, 2008.  The Ministry of Natural Resources monitors the commercial and sport fishing industry to protect Lake Erie’s fishery resources which are managed through an international partnership with the U.S. Great Lakes states.  To report a natural resource violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
