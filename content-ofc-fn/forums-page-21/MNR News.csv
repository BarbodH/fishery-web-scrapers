160926,Spiel,2008-02-15 23:50:00,9065,"A Leamington, Ont., commercial fishing company and a gillnet tug captain have been fined $3,450 in the Ontario Court of Justice at Chatham for using illegal nets, according to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.  The Family Fish Co., Ltd., which owns the license, was fined $1,150. The captain of the vessel Mummery Bros., John Lablance, 38, of Wallaceburg, Ont., was fined $2,300. The OMNR seized the nets.  The case stems from an inspection by provincial conservation officers last July 25, during which they discovered 19 illegally undersized gill nets on the Mummery Bros. tug.  The legal minimum size of gillnets, which resemble huge volleyball nets and which kill virtually all fish they ensnare, is set at 2 1/4 inches to select for commercially marketable yellow perch. Smaller, illegal-sized mesh would catch smaller fish.  The OMNR maintains two toll-free tip-lines to report violations, 1-877-TIPS-MNR and 1-800-222-TIPS."
