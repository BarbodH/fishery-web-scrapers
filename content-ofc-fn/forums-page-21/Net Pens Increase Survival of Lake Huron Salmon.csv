The pens are generally stationed in harbors and allow the young salmon to acclimate to their new environment. Growth of net pen salmon is enhanced with artificial feed. Pen-acclimated salmon are less vulnerable to predators due to this head start in growth, and their tendency to move into deep water more quickly than wild or conventionally stocked salmon.  A recent study compared recreational angler return rates of tags (CWTs) from salmon stocked traditionally to those held in net pens. Net pens in the AuSable River resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in salmon returns, while net pens at Harbor Beach resulted in a much smaller increase due to high temperatures. Pens on the AuSable also appeared to help salmon to imprint. Salmon reared in AuSable River net pens were 6.4 times more likely to return to that river than conventionally stocked fish."
