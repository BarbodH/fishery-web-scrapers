BRP is kicking off its year-long 100th anniversary celebrations of the Evinrude brand at the Miami International Boat Show. This iconic brand that created the boating industry as we know it today has survived through a century of triumphs and challenges, and BRP continues that leadership into the future. In attendance were the grandchildren of the inventor of the first commercialized outboard engines: Tom and Sally Evinrude, children of Ralph Evinrude who, with his father Ole, lead the evolution of the 100-year old brand. Among the guests were an important group of dealers, boat builders, and distributors who support BRP’s efforts in expanding Evinrude engines’ product offering worldwide.  ""By letting people throw away the oars, Evinrude outboard engines have introduced scores of people to the joys of boating and turned these people into lifelong boating enthusiasts,"" said Roch Lambert, vice president and general manager of the outboard engine division at BRP. ""Indeed, in its proud history, Evinrude has sold more engines worldwide than any other outboard manufacturer. People know that buying an Evinrude means buying a trusted brand name that delivers everything they want in an outboard engine,"" he added.  Still Reinventing Boating Today  For 100 years, the Evinrude name has been synonymous with boating innovation. From the earliest innovations to today’s Evinrude E-TEC technology, Evinrude engines have been helping people spend more time enjoying their boating experience. This history of innovation continues today.  Today’s Evinrude E-TEC engines deliver an unmatched boating experience, with more power, better fuel efficiency and less maintenance than any other engine. All this means more of what boaters want most: spending more time on the water to create lasting memories.  Evinrude E-TEC is also the most environmentally friendly outboard motor in the world, receiving such accolades as the EPA Clean Air Technology Excellence Award and authorization to be used on Lake Constance, the pristine waters bordering Switzerland, Austria and Germany. With Evinrude, boaters know their engine will maintain the condition of the waters they love.  A Bright Future  BRP revived and strengthened the Evinrude brand with the introduction of the Evinrude E-TEC outboard engine. Combining 100 years of experience with Evinrude, 50 years of Ski-Doo® snowmobiles, 40 years of Sea-Doo® personal watercraft, and nearly 90 years of Rotax® engines, no other powersports company can demonstrate such commitment to this industry nor match BRP’s portfolio of innovative, trend-setting and market-shaping products.  ""That commitment to industry leadership is today stronger than ever. A few weeks ago, we launched the 50th anniversary celebrations of Ski-Doo snowmobiles and introduced a Ski-Doo snowmobile powered by a Rotax engine to which we adapted the E-TEC technology. This certainly attests our commitment to this technology as well as to our quest for meaningful innovations and more eco-friendly products,"" said José Boisjoli, president and CEO, BRP.  ""As we celebrate Evinrude 100th and Ski-Doo 50th anniversaries, we need to remind ourselves where we come from as a company and to remember that we have a duty of perpetuating this great heritage of ours. In the last year, we announced major investments in three new centers of excellence focused on developing advanced technologies and on bringing design and innovation to another level. This is our commitment to our customers and to powersports enthusiasts,"" concluded Boisjoli.  Bombardier Recreational Products, a privately-held company, is a world leader in the design, development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of motorized recreational vehicles. Its portfolio of brands and products includes: Ski-Doo® and Lynx™ snowmobiles; Sea-Doo® watercraft and sport boats; Evinrude® and Johnson® outboard engines; Can-Am™ all-terrain vehicles and roadsters, and Rotax® engines and karts; and direct injection technologies such as E-TEC®."
