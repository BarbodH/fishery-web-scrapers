161062,Spiel,2008-02-16 15:47:00,9059,"News Release  Government Takes Action to Ensure Clean Water for Canadians: Phosphates in Detergents to be Heavily Restricted   Montreal, Quebec, February 15, 2008 -The Honourable John Baird, Minister of the Environment and the Honourable Michael M. Fortier, Minister of Public Works and Government Services, today announced action on restricting the level of phosphates in laundry and dishwasher detergent.  This will have a positive impact on reducing the growth of blue-green algae in our rivers, lakes and streams.  ""Last summer, Canadians in many parts of the country saw an increase in the growth of blue-green algae, restricting their ability to enjoy many summer holiday locations,"" said Minister Baird.  ""It's time to act.  Our Government is taking action and will be limiting phosphates in laundry and dishwasher detergents.  Along with our plans to ban the dumping of raw sewage and improve sewage treatment across Canada, today's action should have a positive effect on the environment.""  The Government is proposing to amend regulations in order to reduce the amount of phosphates added to laundry detergents and, for the first time in Canadian history, limit the amount found in dishwasher detergents and general purpose cleaners.  By 2010, the Government will set a limit of 0.5% by weight for laundry and dishwasher detergents and, where analysis indicates, in general purpose cleaners.  ""Canadians have spoken and this Government has listened.  Today, we are taking real action to protect our rivers, lakes and streams from blue-green algae,"" said Minister Fortier. ""I know this has been an important issue in the province of Quebec and today's action is another step towards improving our waterways for the enjoyment of all.""  Phosphates are used in certain detergents and cleaning products to soften water, reduce spotting and rusting, hold dirt, and increase performance. However, too many phosphates in our water can lead to an over production of blue-green algae.  Though blue-green algae are naturally-occurring, in large quantities they can emit a harmful level of toxins. This can lead to poor water quality and force the closure of beaches in warm temperatures.  ""I also want to acknowledge the work of provinces like Quebec and Manitoba in regulating phosphates,"" said Minister Baird.  ""I know that Premiers Charest and Doer, along with Ministers Beauchamp and Melnick are facing serious blue-green algae challenges in their respective provinces, and I believe today's action by the federal government demonstrates that when we work together, we can achieve great things.""  The action the Government is taking today by proposing these regulations complement the proposed tough new national standards that will be set for sewage dumping and sewage treatment. These actions are key to improving water quality and protecting the health of Canadians.
