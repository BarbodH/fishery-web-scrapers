The cichlids were in an unmanned rocket that blasted off from a launch pad in northern Sweden yesterday.  Professor Reinhard Hilbig, who was in charge of the fish-in-space project, says the thumbnail-sized fish were filmed as they swam around weightlessly in small aquariums during the 10-minute space flight.  The German team will now study the video to see if some of the fish swam in circles because that is what fish do when they experience motion sickness.  Hilbig says the scientists hope the experiment can help shed light on why some people experience motion sickness while others do not, because the mechanisms involved are similar for both fish and humans.  Hilbig said the fish landed safely and appeared to be in good condition."
