A new Ohio state record blue catfish, Ictalurus furcatus, may have been caught along the Ohio River in southwest Ohio according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Wildlife.  Chris Rolph of Clermont County caught the fish weighing 96 pounds in the Ohio River near downtown Cincinnati on June 11. Rolph’s catch is 54.5 inches in length with a 36-inch girth. The fish was caught using frozen skipjack herring. Skipjack herring, Alosa chyrsochloris, a native forage fish found in the Ohio River, is a very popular bait fish used by catfish anglers. It took the lucky angler and a friend about 30 minutes to get the fish into their boat. The fish was then weighed at the Bethel Feed & Farm Supply.  Mr. Rolph’s catch will be certified as the new state record blue catfish pending review by the Outdoor Writers of Ohio State Record Fish Committee. It will replace the first ever state record blue catfish certified in 2008 of 57 pounds 3.2 ounces.  Ohio Division of Wildlife fisheries biologist Doug Maloney, at Wildlife District Five, identified Rolph’s catch as a blue catfish. The blue catfish is the largest growing catfish in the Ohio River sometimes weighing in excess of 100 pounds.
