342106,Spiel,2009-05-16 13:06:00,9065," Great Lakes Alert Fish and wildlife conservation needs to be part of discussion     May 15, 2009 /  For Immediate Release   Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontarioâ€”how important are these lakes, their bays, wetlands and tributaries to the fishing and hunting heritage, culture and recreational activities of Ontario?  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.) is urging conservationists to let the provincial government know how these resources should be managed, by responding to Healthy Great Lakes, Strong Ontario, a discussion paper that is currently posted on the environmental registry website (E.B.R. Registry Number 010-6105).  Three provincial ministries, Natural Resources, Environment, and Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, have developed a joint discussion paper that outlines the goals and key strategies for managing the Great Lakes into the future. Outdoors enthusiasts are encouraged to read the paper and submit their comments to the E.B.R., as their views are needed in order to ensure that fish and wildlife conservation are appropriately considered and financed, both provincially, and in the context of the Canada-Ontario Agreement Respecting the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem (C.O.A.).  Negotiations for the renewal of the C.O.A. will take place later this year. The partnership between the two senior levels of government, as reflected in the C.O.A., typically includes matching funding on initiatives to protect, restore and sustain the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem.  ""The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunter has submitted its response to the discussion paper, and will continue to work with all levels of government to ensure that appropriate actions and funding are attached to fish and wildlife initiatives in the next C.O.A.,"" says O.F.A.H. Provincial Manager, Fish and Wildlife Services, Terry Quinney. ""We urge our members to read both the provincial discussion paper on the E.B.R., and our response to it which is posted on our website, and to let the province know your thoughts.""  To view the provincial discussion paper, visit www.ebr.gov.on.ca and search #010-6105. To view the O.F.A.H. response, visit www.ofah.org and check under ""Latest Additions."" O.F.A.H. members are asked to send a copy of their comments to the O.F.A.H. as well, to the attention of Terry Quinney.  With over 100,000 members, subscribers and supporters, and 660 member clubs, the O.F.A.H. is the largest nonprofit, charitable, fishing, hunting and conservation-based organization in Ontario, and the voice of anglers and hunters.
