This project will collect genetic information about the sturgeon stocks in Batchawana Bay, which will contribute to the management of this unique species.  Gill nets will be used to capture sturgeon in relatively shallow areas of the bay and will remain in the water overnight. The nets will be identified with orange buoys at both ends labelled ""OMNR"". Boaters should avoid travelling between these buoys due to the nets in the bay.  Field staff will collect biological information such as length and weight, remove a small section of fin ray for later genetic analysis, and ""live release"" all sturgeon captured.
