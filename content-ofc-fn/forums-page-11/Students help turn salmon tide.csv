The Lake Avenue elementary students raised the fish they released as part of the Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program in which 100 schools in Ontario have participated so far since it started in 2006.  The fish released yesterday started off as a tray full of eggs delivered to the classrooms in February. They hatched in a fish tank that is maintained by the students, who make sure the fish are fed and their water temperature remains cool.  It has been nearly 110 years since Lake Ontario's Atlantic salmon were wiped out of area streams, but with the release of 1.3 million of them, they are making a comeback.  Besides Bronte Creek, organizers have also stocked Duffins Creek, Cobourg Brook and the Credit River, all tributaries of Lake Ontario.  The fish were released yesterday at Lowville Park in north Burlington.

Conservation authorities along the shores of Lake Ontario are also participating. Yesterday's release also involved sponsorship by Pioneer Petroleum and the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters."
