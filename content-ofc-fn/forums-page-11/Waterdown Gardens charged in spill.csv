The ministry announced today it has charged Waterdown Garden Supplies Ltd. with violating the Ontario Water Resources Act and the Environmental Protection Act in connection with a spill from a lagoon on Oct. 5, 2008.  That spill -- allegedly caused by a hole in a berm around a wastewater lagoon -- may have sent dirty water into Barlow Creek, prompting warnings to the Grand River Conservation Authority, Six Nations, area health units and water treatment plants. The ministry had ordered the company to conduct an engineering study on the berm's stability.  The Highway 5 company is accused of discharging, causing or permitting the discharge of material into Barlow Creek that may have impaired the quality of the waterway contrary to Section 30 (1) of the Ontario Water Resources Act. It is also accused of discharging, causing or permitting the discharge of a contaminant into the natural environment that caused or was likely to cause an adverse effect contrary to the Section 14 (1) of the Environmental Protection Act.  The company, owned by Bill (legal name Wim) Van Ravenswaay, 53, of Smithville, is scheduled to appear before court in Hamilton Aug. 5.  On April 8 this year, the ministry was alerted to wastewater escaping another berm, a spill the ministry says Waterdown Gardens failed to report as required. It says the company has also failed to submit a report on a study of that berm breach. Both alleged violations were referred to the investigation branch.  Waterdown Garden Supplies Ltd. was fined $50,000 for 10 environmental violations in April 2008."
