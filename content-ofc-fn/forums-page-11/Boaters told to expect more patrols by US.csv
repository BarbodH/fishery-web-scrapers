About 50 boaters from the Leamington and Kingsville area were told those efforts will be greatly enhanced this year on the U.S. side.  The boaters attended a session at the Leamington Marina May 16 with three members of the U.S. customs and border patrol service from Cleveland and an official from the Canadian Border Services Agency.  They were answering queries on the regulations for boaters to enter the United States and return to Canada.  Chief Jim Mortimer, based out of Cleveland, said the number one document that anyone should have when entering the US is a passport or other approved document, a rule that comes into effect on all U.S. border crossings on June 1.  The Cleveland border service is responsible for about 300 miles of coastline along the Great Lakes.  Canadian boaters were also urged to obtain other documentation, such as Form I 68 or Nexus cards to ease entry into U.S. ports.  Mortimer said that boaters that do cross the boundary in the lake without the intent of landing could be stopped and searched but that is not viewed as a major problem by US customs.  “We’re all in this together,” he said of the efforts to thwart terrorism and smuggling.  He urged boaters to report anything they see and consider as suspicious activity on the lake.  One boater said he certainly would not use his marine radio to make that call because it could be overheard. Mortimer agreed a cell phone or landline was more appropriate.  Canadian boaters with the appropriate documents were told they can call US customs ahead of the intended visit by boat, anywhere between a mimum of four hours and a maximum of 48 hours."
