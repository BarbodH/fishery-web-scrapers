Two men in their 70s were fishing when their boat capsized at about 11 a.m. between Point Pelee and Pelee Island, Staff Sgt. Mike Beatty of the Essex OPP said Friday.  The OPP dive team is coming to the scene from Orillia, he said.  The OPP marine unit and the Canadian Coast Guard along with a search and rescue plane and helicopter converged on the scene.  A woman from Tilbury, who didn't want to give her name, was fishing on the lake in the same area about 20 km off the shores of Leamington Friday.  ""We could see the boat overturned and a guy on top waving,"" she said Friday afternoon.  The woman said two men were fishing in an 18-foot aluminum boat and had set out Friday at about 8:30 a.m. She didn't see what happened to the boat but said she saw two rescuers dropped into the water.  The Canadian Coast Guard vessel called the Thunder Cape arrived and brought one man to shore.  The Tilbury woman said both men were wearing life jackets. She said there was a north wind and the lake was a little choppy Friday morning.  The Windsor Star will update the story as information becomes available.  © Copyright © The Windsor Star"
