Use an alternate source of water for these purposes. NOTE- Boiling the water or using home water treatment devices will NOT destroy the toxins.  ∙ Avoid swimming and other water sport activities that could increase the risk of algae material and toxins contacting your skin or being swallowed.  ∙ Avoid using water from Wasi Lake for pets and livestock.  Fact Sheets with more information about Blue-Green Algae can be found at www.healthunit.biz on the front page in the Hot Topics Box.
