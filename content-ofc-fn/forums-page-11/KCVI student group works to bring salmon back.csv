Often forgotten are the numerous animals that are threatened by extinction or have already become extinct because of negative human influence.  From polar bears to gorillas to Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario, to countless other species around the world, animals are disappearing at alarming rates. In future, these animals will merely be seen in textbooks and will never be appreciated in their natural habitats.  One such species could have been the Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario. However, due to the determination and commitment of many individuals and organizations, this native species is returning to areas where it has not been seen in a century.  Atlantic salmon were once an abundant native species, providing settlers and natives with food and economic self-sufficiency. Due to habitat loss and overfishing, however, the Atlantic salmon have been extirpated since European settlement began.  For the past 20 years, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has studied reintroducing this native species. Through partnerships formed with various concerned groups, the rehabilitation of salmon is becoming a reality.  Since discovering the rehabilitation program Bring Back the Salmon, the Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute Environment Club and several concerned senior students have been actively involved in restoring Atlantic salmon populations in Lake Ontario, in partnership with the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. Since January, the group has spawned 70 surviving fish eggs and raised the fry. During the past months, the group has evaluated the growth and development of the fish, and they are anticipating that the young fry will be released by late May or early June in nearby Cobourg Creek.  This is the first year of the Environment Clubâ€™s participation in the rehabilitation program, and we all share great enthusiasm and optimism for the success of the project. It is our aspiration that this program will become a tradition at KCVI and will be successful in the future.  In conjunction with increasing Atlantic salmon populations, rehabilitating salmon habitats is a key focus. Along with the release of the fish in the springtime, the KCVI Environment Club will organize a cleanup in the area of Cobourg Creek. This will ensure that the water temperature remains low for optimum growing conditions and that our efforts to restore the Atlantic salmon are maintained.  We hope that many more groups and individuals in the Kingston area share our enthusiasm for reintroducing a species that has suffered from our misuse of the land. Even though the ministry and the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters have successfully brought many Atlantic salmon back into Lake Ontario, many more challenges remain in restoring polluted streams. Nevertheless, optimism and hope for a full recovery are on the horizon through outreach and education as many more people learn about the Bring Back the Salmon program."
