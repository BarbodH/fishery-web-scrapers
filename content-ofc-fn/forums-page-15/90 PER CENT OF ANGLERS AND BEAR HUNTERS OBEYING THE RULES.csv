The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ontario Provincial Police carried out the blitz on August 22, 2008.  Eight Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers from Kenora and Fort Frances and the ministry's canine handler from Dryden checked 295 non-resident and 67 resident anglers and hunters. The officers checked for fish, baitfish and bear violations. They inspected over 20 harvested bears which were being transported by hunters returning from Kenora, Dryden and Red Lake districts.  Conservation officers laid nine charges and issued 20 warnings, including:  - Six charges and 13 warnings for improper packaging of fish - Three charges and four warnings for having more fish than the possession limit - Two warnings for wasting bear meat - One warning for not having a fishing licence.  Four Kenora Ontario Provincial Police officers checked 321 motor vehicles and 17 commercial motor vehicles. They issued five seat belt warnings and took a truck out of service because the truck's load was not secure and the driver had no insurance.
