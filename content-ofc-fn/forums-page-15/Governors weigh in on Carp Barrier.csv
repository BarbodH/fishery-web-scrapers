The letter was prompted by a recent article written by investigative journalist Dan Egan in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel over the delay and reluctance of the US Coast Guard and US Army Corps of Engineers (Chicago office) to turn on Barrier IIA:  The Second letter is from the Chairman of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to the editors of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel also weighing  in on the urgency needed to complete and operate the barrier at maximum force.   October 31, 2008  Secretary Robert M. Gates U.S. Department of Defense Washington, D.C. 20301-1400 Secretary Michael Chertoff U.S. Department of Homeland Security Washington, D.C. 20528   Dear Secretary Gates and Secretary Chertoff:   As you know, the Great Lakes are at risk from the grave threat posed by Asian carp and other harmful aquatic invasive species. Without the completion and operation of an effective barrier system in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, the Asian carp may soon enter the Lakes through the Illinois and Chicago River systems. These carp potentially threaten public safety and the ecological integrity of the world’s largest freshwater system.  The Great Lakes Governors, Mayors, Members of Congress and many others have worked tirelessly to secure Federal support for the barrier, and each of the Great Lakes States have made financial contributions to support the barrier when construction was delayed due to Federal funding shortfalls. Nearly one year has passed since Congress enacted the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, which provided the necessaryauthorization and appropriations to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for completion of the barrier. Yet despite these enormous efforts, the Great Lakes still remain vulnerable as the U.S. Coast Guard performs additional tests and delays continue to prevent the full operation of the new barrier system. While we recognize there are safety concerns related to the barrier, these concerns must be more quickly assessed and resolved.  We therefore ask you to provide us with a detailed work plan and timeline to complete barrier construction and testing, and  then to begin operation at full capacity as soon as possible. More than 35 million Americans depend on the Great Lakes, and our region’s commercial and sport fishing industries contribute significantly to our regional economy. Our region, and our nation, cannot afford continued delay.  Sincerely, Jim Doyle / Governor of Wisconsin  Chair, Council of Great Lakes Governors    **********************************************     And From Dr. Michael Hansen, Chairman of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission:   Dear Mr. Kaiser,  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has exhibited true leadership during the past several years in dealing with the major invasive species problem posed by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, an artificial connection between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins.  However, Journal-Sentinel reporter Dan Egan’s article (November 10) reflects growing disappointment and frustration among many over the excessive amount of time taken to fully activate the new high-powered electrical barrier on the canal.  As designed, the new barrier is much stronger than the experimental barrier, and such strength is needed to block the migration of fish like the Asian carp.  Unfortunately, it has been proposed that the barrier be operated at only a fraction of its potential.  Those of us who have supported the project have always expected the corps to operate the barrier at full strength.  Carp are voracious feeders and could destroy the Great Lakes’ fragile food web if they were permitted to enter.  As they have demonstrated on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers, the carp also pack a powerful punch by flying out of the water when startled and inflicting serious harm on people and property. This barrier is needed now to protect the Great Lakes’ environment and to protect millions of people who boat and water ski on the lakes from these “flying” fish.  We have only one chance to get this right.  For what are we waiting?   Dr. Michael Hansen, Chairman Great Lakes Fishery Commission and Professor, University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point "
