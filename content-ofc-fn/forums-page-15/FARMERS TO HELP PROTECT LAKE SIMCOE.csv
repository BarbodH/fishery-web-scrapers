Through the Lake Simcoe Farm Stewardship Initiative, a total of $500,000 is available this year for projects that improve water quality by contributing to lower phosphorus levels in the lake. Projects include:  - Restricting livestock access to watercourses  - Establishing plant buffers along lake and tributary shorelines  - Improving on-farm storage and handling of petroleum products, pesticides and fertilizers  - Modifying tillage practices to reduce soil erosion and runoff.  This initiative is part of the province’s commitment of $20 million in funding over four years to protect Lake Simcoe, announced in June 2008.  QUOTES  “This funding will help farmers enhance their efforts in a very productive agricultural area of the province,” said Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Leona Dombrowsky.  “Farmers are already doing good work to reduce the amount of phosphorus going into Lake Simcoe and its tributaries,” said Environment Minister John Gerretsen. “This funding will help them do even more.”  QUICK FACTS  - Agricultural production in the Lake Simcoe watershed generated close to $300 million in gross farm receipts in 2006.  - More than 350,000 people live in the Lake Simcoe watershed.
