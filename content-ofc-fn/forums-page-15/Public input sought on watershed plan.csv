273542,Spiel,2008-11-30 13:17:00,9059,"Public input sought on watershed plan   November 28th, 2008 / Burlington Post   Conservation Halton (CH) wants to hear from residents about what they think is important to preserve and protect in the local watershed.  The environmental organization recently released a draft of its 2009-13 strategic plan, Towards a Healthy Watershed.  The plan will set the organization’s priorities for the next five years to protect, restore and manage the natural resources in its watershed.  The public is invited to attend a public open house to comment on and learn more about the draft strategic plan on Tuesday (Dec. 2).  It will take place at the CH administration office, 2596 Britannia Rd. W., just west of Guelph Line, from 6:30-9 p. m., with a presentation at 7 p. m.  A copy of the draft plan is available online atwww.conservationhalton.on.ca/stratplan .  By participating in the development of the strategic plan, residents will be helping make decisions to protect the water, trees, green space and wildlife in their community.  From ensuring the protection of life and property from natural hazards to studying the resilience of the local environment and the potential impacts of climate change, the plan covers a lot of ground.  It has a number of objectives, grouped into five themes: environment, parks, education, community and governance.  Hassaan Basit, director of communications at CH, said conservation authorities work together with residents, municipalities, businesses, politicians and the agriculture communities to manage the natural resources in their watersheds.  “Our new strategic plan reflects the importance of these relationships,” he said. “It identifies priorities for vital programs such as drinking water protection, flood protection, invasive species and forestry. There is also a dedication to provide a growing population with access to green space for healthy lifestyles and recreation, preserve natural heritage and deliver outdoor education programs to inspire the next generation.”  Those who can’t attend the open house can still comment on the draft strategic plan by completing a survey on the web-site or by sending comments, in writing, by Monday, Dec. 22 to: Strategic Plan, Conservation Halton, 2596 Britannia Rd. W., RR 2, Milton, L9T 2X6.  Those planning to attend the open house are asked to call 905-336-1158, ext. 0, in advance or e-mail [email protected] ."
