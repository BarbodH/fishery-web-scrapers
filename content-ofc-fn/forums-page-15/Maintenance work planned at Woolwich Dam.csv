The work will start Oct. 7 and last about a week. To allow the work to take place, the reservoir will be drawn down early to its winter holding level. Normally it reaches the winter level in mid-November.  In addition, the trails around the Woolwich Dam will be closed on Oct. 6, about one week earlier than normal.  The Woolwich Dam is an earthen embankment about 12 metres high (40 feet). It was built on the Canagagigue Creek in 1974 to provide flood protection for Elmira and to store water for release to the creek during the summer.  It is normal for earthen embankment dams to settle over time, but the amount has been greater than usual. GRCA staff have noted some minor slumping in the road along the top of the dam near the concrete gate structure. As well, a guard rail along the road has started to lean toward the reservoir.  Part of the asphalt road and about one metre of soil will be removed from the top of the dam. Staff will examine the embankment, looking for areas of loose or uncompacted soil. When they have found them, they will put new soil in place, compact it to the proper standards and then restore the area.  The reservoir will remain at its winter holding level after the work is done.   ---------------------------------------------    Further information: Dave Schultz, GRCA Manager of Communications Phone: (519) 621-2763, Ext. 2273 Fax: (519) 621-4844 E-mail: Dave Schultz"
