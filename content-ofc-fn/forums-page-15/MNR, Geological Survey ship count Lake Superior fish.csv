The MNR and U.S. Geological Survey have been busy this week as they try to measure the herring stocks on this side of Lake Superior.  It's a species that is not only difficult to count, but difficult to catch as well, as they manage to avoid being caught in nets during the daytime.  U.S. geologist Dan Yule said his crew does their best work at night, using a combination of sonar equipment and trawling nets.  The ciscoes feed on plankton, and help the food chain by becoming food themselves for larger fish in Lake Superior."
