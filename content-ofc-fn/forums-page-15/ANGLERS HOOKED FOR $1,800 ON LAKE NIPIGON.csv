The following anglers were convicted of angling with more than one barbless hook:  - Jeffery James Michalski, 40, of Duluth, Minnesota, was fined $250 - Jodi Rae Elstad, 41, of Duluth, Minnesota, was fined $250 - Daniel Dean Williams, 58, and Darlene Kay Williams, 58, both from Cadillac, Michigan, were each fined $200  The following anglers were convicted of angling with a barbed hook:  - Louis Paul Miskovich, 55, of Duluth, Minnesota, was fined $250 - Gregory W. May, 51, of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, was fined $250 - Leslie G. Krystolovich, 53, of Brampton, Ontario, was fined $200 - James W. Krystolovich, 46, of Mississauga, Ontario, was fined $200  The men were charged after Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers conducted an enforcement blitz on Lake Nipigon from June 19 to 21, 2008.  Justice of the Peace John Guthrie heard the cases in the Ontario Court of Justice, Nipigon, on August 25, 2008.  Anglers are reminded that Lake Nipigon is a world class trout and pike fishery. Special size and limit restrictions require anglers to release many fish in order to comply with the regulations, which have been in place since 1997. The use of barbless hooks allows fish to be released easily and quickly. The less a fish is handled and the less it is damaged by hooks, the more likely it is to survive and be available for future harvest.  To report a natural resource violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time or contact your ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
