Since mid-summer, adult Atlantic salmon introduced into Lake Ontarioâ€™s tributaries as part of the Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program have been returning to the Credit River. The ministry has worked with the Credit River Anglers Association to ensure the adult salmon are transported to high-quality spawning habitat. Spawning activity was confirmed in early November.  Atlantic salmon have also been returning to Cobourg Creek and Duffins Creek, the two other streams targeted for restoration.  Full Story & Video"

I hope that this time its a success,and that they get a really good return,and if people practice C&R for a few years it will help,as they do spawn more than once,the M.N.R has to educate fishermen,and let people know that that they are not like the chinook salmon,that die after spawning and that they are not just put & take salmon !!!!  cheers"
