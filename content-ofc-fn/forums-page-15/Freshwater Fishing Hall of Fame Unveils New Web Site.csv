The Hall is the international  headquarters for education, recognition and promotion of fresh water sportfishing. While The Hall maintains a museum for the preservation  and display of historical artifacts of fresh water sportfishing, they also have a program for the recognition of persons, organizations and  institutions who have made significant and lasting contributions to the sport and heritage of fresh water fishing. Many know The Hall for their  program for qualifying, compiling and publishing all fresh water sportfishing records but they also maintain a library that disseminates  information and acts as the clearing house for historical and contemporary publications for the fresh water sportfishing industry.  When you visit The Hall’s new web site you will find the history of the institution and how it evolved into the renowned facility it is today.   There are links to articles by anglers that have been inducted into The Hall of Fame as well as the ability to download current editions of The  Splash for members. The Splash is the quarterly newsletter of The Hall.  Those wishing to become members of The Hall to take advantage of  the benefits offered need only click the Become a Member link on the left of the home page to discover the rewards a membership offers.  The new web site can be found at www.freshwater-fishing.org. It’s worth a visit."

The only drawback, is for folks expecting to see a lot of Canadian related items. There is a bit and a few folks that have been enshrined, but by and large this is a drawback from a patriotic fellow like myself.  Thank-you for posting this. I have bookmarked the site and look forward to visiting Hayward again. It is incidentally about 40 minutes away from Park Falls, which is where St. Croix fishing rods are made.  outdoorguy61"
