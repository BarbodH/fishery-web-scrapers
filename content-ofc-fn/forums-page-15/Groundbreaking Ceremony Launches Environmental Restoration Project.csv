261470,Spiel,2008-10-25 13:56:00,9059,"Groundbreaking Ceremony Launches Environmental Restoration Project in Newmarket Creek adjacent to Southlake Regional Health Centre to be restored   October 1st, 2008 / www.lsrca.on.ca   NEWMARKET – Representatives from the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority (LSRCA), Southlake Regional Health Centre, the Lake Simcoe Conservation Foundation, the Town of Newmarket and the Regional Municipality of York gathered at the Southlake Regional Health Centre campus on Friday September 26th to break ground on the Eastern Creek Naturalization Project.  The Eastern Creek Naturalization Project will restore and naturalize a 185-metre long section of Newmarket's Eastern Creek, adjacent to Southlake Regional Health Centre. The project will help improve water quality, reduce erosion, create more habitat for fish and other wildlife, and create a more natural setting for hospital patients, visitors and local residents to enjoy.  “The environmental concern at this location is that there are no buffers between the hard urban surfaces and the creek to filter-out contaminants from urban run-off,” said Virginia Hackson, Chair of the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority and Councillor for the Town of East Gwillimbury. “Working together, we will remedy this problem to ensure the long-term health of our environment.”  The project will take an estimated four to six weeks to complete and will cost an estimated $225,000. After the creek restoration is complete, the project funding partners and local residents will be invited to plant trees and shrubs on the project site. An area of 1,900 square metres will be planted.  “The Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority has shown consistent leadership by helping private landowners and municipalities take-on environmental stewardship projects,” said John Taylor, Regional Councillor for the Town of Newmarket. “This project demonstrates what can be accomplished when organizations partner to make real progress towards a healthier environment.”  The project received funding contribution from Southlake Regional Health Centre. Southlake has continually demonstrated its commitment to local environmental issues and is the recipient of the 2008 Sunoco Earth Day Award. Southlake also received special recognition from the Office of Energy Efficiency of Natural Resources for their energy and water saving efforts.  “As Southlake Regional Health Centre grows, it is vital that we take into account the state of our local environment and help protect and restore it wherever possible,” said Daniel Carriere, President and CEO of Southlake Regional Health Centre. “Any organization, no matter what size, can partner with the conservation authority to ensure the environmental health of the property they do business on.”  The project also received funding contribution from the Lake Simcoe Conservation Foundation, the charitable arm of the LSRCA that represents residents of the Lake Simcoe watershed with a concern for the health of their local environment and Lake Simcoe.  “This project would not be possible without the generous contributions of our donors and partner organizations,” said Kimberley MacKenzie, Executive director of the Lake Simcoe Conservation Foundation. “This transformation in the heart of Newmarket will demonstrate to the community what can be achieved when donations are made to help nature heal.”  The Eastern Creek Naturalization Project is made possible by a partnership between the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, Southlake Regional Health Centre, the Lake Simcoe Conservation Foundation, the Regional Municipality of York, through the Lake Simcoe Water Quality Improvement Program, the Town of Newmarket, the Government of Canada, through Environment Canada, York Environmental Stewardship, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, York Bassmasters, and the Bogart Creek Restoration Committee.  The Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority has worked with private landowners and municipalities to complete over 950 protection and restoration projects under the Lake Simcoe Water Quality Improvement Program since 1989."
