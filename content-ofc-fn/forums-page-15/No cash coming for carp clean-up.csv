Brock Township has struck out on its request for government funding to cover the cost of the summer's carp clean-up.  Back in July, council passed a motion calling for the provincial Ministry of the Environment and Fisheries and Oceans Canada to reimburse municipal costs for the carp clean-up.  While the Region footed the bill for the curbside pick-up of the dead fish, Township staff had to comb public areas -- such as beaches and lakeside parks -- to dispose of the fish. According to works director Judy Avery, the Township spent nearly $11,000 to keep municipal property clean.  “There should be some compensation to municipalities,” said Mayor Larry O’Connor in July, adding that more than 12 tonnes of the dead fish were collected in Brock Township alone.  At last week's meeting -- the first since summer recess -- council received correspondence saying there would not be funding forthcoming.  ""Unfortunately, (the) Ministry of Natural Resources does not have funds available to consider your request to offset the costs of carp disposal incurred by your and other affected municipalities,"" reads the letter from Minister of Natural Resources Donna Cansfield. ""Fish die-offs remain a regrettable, but naturally occurring, event on our watersheds."""
