1043613,Phil S C,2019-04-25 20:30:00,11,"Purchased a new Haswing Cayman 55lb thrust with 48"" shaft bow mount wireless trolling motor on ebay about 2 months ago with wireless controller, corded foot control and quick release mounting plate for less than $600 US. Finally installed it on my 16 1/2 ft Crestliner today. So far with just land testing it I'm extremely impressed and satisfied with it. Motor quickly responded to the wireless controller from about  40 to 50 feet away and the installation was quite painless. I'll fill you all in on my final critique when I open water test it in the next couple of weeks.  "
