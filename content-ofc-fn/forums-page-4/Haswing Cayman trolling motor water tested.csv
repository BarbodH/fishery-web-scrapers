As mentioned in my previous report I purchased a 12v, 48"" shaft, bow mount with cordless remote, wired foot control and quick release pad for under $600 US on ebay (now about $650 or so). Though it doesn't  have all the bells and whistles of some of the well known name brands such as anchor or auto-tracking my motor performed admirably. Just not having to be physically attached to my trolling motor left me free to set rods and fight fish. It's quiet, quick to respond, easy to deploy and easy to install. I just couldn't justify spending 2 grand on a well known brand  trolling motor and install it on a boat I paid $3000 for. Good fishing to all, I'm leaving for a fly-in on June 7th."
