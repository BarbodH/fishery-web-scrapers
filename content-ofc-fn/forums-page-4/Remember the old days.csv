The idea of keeping people away from a great day fishing, a father or mother with they're kids, grandfather bringing home another story, someone taking a pic of they're first rock bass etc, well its sorta depressing, bring back the old days when a beat up glass rod can of back yard dug up worms created hours of peace and entertainment loose the fences and let's create some good fishing for the next generation.
