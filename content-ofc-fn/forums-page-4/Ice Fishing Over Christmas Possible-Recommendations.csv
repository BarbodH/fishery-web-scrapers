I've only been (ice fishing) once before and have no equipment so I'm looking for a package type deal. The idea is to bring my laptop and get some work done here and there through the day. I'm unsure as to with average weather in mind whether there's driving distance opportunities. It's also just me. I'd need power, although I do have a generator I recently bought that I could bring. I'd need to know what the chances of wifi as well as some of the work is internet related. I did some looking on line and one thing I noticed is that package generally speaking are for groups. Anyway, input appreciated.Species isn't critical. Perch and pickerel would be nice though. - John"
