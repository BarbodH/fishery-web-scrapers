1040525,steeler,2019-02-16 03:17:00,3,Hello my fishing friends - We are planning to fish the Big Rideau Lake for pike in late May of 2019. I wondered if anyone could offer advice on finding these toothy critters this time of year? We’ve fished the Gananaque Water System for nearly 10 years and want to try something new.
