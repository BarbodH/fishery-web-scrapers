I have been mostly chasing panfish and have started to go after some bigger fish now that i'm a teen. We had a family trip to Florida and were thinking spiny lobsters but my 6th sense kicked in ( common sense ) and we went scalloping. Check out my video, sorry about the 320p quality but needed room on the sd card for regular vacation stuff.....oh please leave a thumbs up and subscribe and for a special treat click on the videos in the description if you like looking at girls in bikinis that look and scallop better then me, that's how I learned. have a nice day  "
