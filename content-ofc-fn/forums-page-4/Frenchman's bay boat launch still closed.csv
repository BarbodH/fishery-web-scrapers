It was the last affordable access to Lake Ontario in all of the GTA for all of us who did not amass or inherit wealth. It was also a nice, somewhat still looking wild and natural place where I (and many others I would encounter there) would be able to go to and decompress, escape the pervasive urban stress we have to endure. All of this was closed for 2 years. During this time the place was completely devastated, urbanized and made to look like an ordinary downtown place, and all access to the boat launch was closed.Â  I would like to fight this and am asking for help from those of you who care also. Please suggest ideas on what we could do. Your help would be much appreciated."
