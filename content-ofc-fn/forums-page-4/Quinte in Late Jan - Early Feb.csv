I have been doing some general research on the area and know some spots that I want to try, near Belleville.   But I am just wondering if it's worth the drive down that time of year.  It's my understanding that the walleye are NOT in there all year, at by that time, they may have already moved further out the bay. Certainly not asking for anyone's honey hole.  Just wondering your thoughts on where the walleye this time year. Depths, lures, etc..  Any help would be greatly appreciated! "
