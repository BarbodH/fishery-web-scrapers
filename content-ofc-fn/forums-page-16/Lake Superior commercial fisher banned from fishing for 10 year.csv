Daniel Sameluk, 34, pleaded guilty to two over-quota charges and was fined $4,000.  Jarvis Sameluk, 64, was convicted in court of two over-quota charges and was fined $4,000.  He also received a ban from any involvement in the commercial fishing industry for the next 10 years.  The commercial fishing ban was imposed as a result of a range of convictions over more than 25 years.  Commercial fishing licence holders are responsible for taking the appropriate steps to ensure that they do not exceed their quota. The over quota fish seized by the ministry were sold for more than $3,800 which was redirected to the Special Purpose Account for funding fish and wildlife work across the province.  Justice of the Peace John Guthrie heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Thunder Bay, on November 29-30, 2006, and March 10-12, 2007.  On June 24, 2008, the Justice of the Peace John Guthrie rejected the abuse of process application and convicted Jarvis Sameluk on both counts.
