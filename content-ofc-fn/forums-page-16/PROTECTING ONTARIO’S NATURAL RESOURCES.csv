These enhancements are being supported by a $2.5 million provincial investment.  The new officers will focus on lakes Ontario and Erie, as well as other priority areas within the province.  Ontario's conservation officers patrol an area of more than one million square kilometres, protecting fish and wildlife, ensuring that anglers and hunters follow the rules, helping to safeguard species at risk, and more.
