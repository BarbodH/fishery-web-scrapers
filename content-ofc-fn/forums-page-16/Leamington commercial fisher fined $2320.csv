Emilio Mauricio, 48, of Leamington, captain of the commercial fishing vessel ""MI-MARK"", pleaded guilty and was fined $2,320 for four fishing violations. These included failing to submit an accurate and complete daily catch report to the Ministry of Natural Resources, fishing outside of his permitted fishing grounds and allowing approximately 200 lbs. of yellow perch to spoil and become unsuitable for human consumption.  Court was told that on August 21, 2007, conservation officers investigated an alleged incident of inaccurate information being reported on a daily catch report involving the commercial fishing vessel ""MI-MARK"" while it was fishing out of the port of Erieau, on Lake Erie.  Further investigation also determined that the fishing vessel was fishing in Chatham-Kent waters and not Elgin County waters as reported by the captain, and that fish were permitted to spoil.  Justice of the Peace Babcock heard the federal charges in the Ontario Court of Justice in Chatham on July 17, 2008 and Justice of the Peace Hurst heard the provincial charges in the Ontario Court of Justice in Chatham on August 13, 2008.
