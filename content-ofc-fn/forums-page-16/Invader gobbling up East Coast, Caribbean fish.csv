239644,Spiel,2008-08-14 12:12:00,9059,"Invader gobbling up East Coast, Caribbean fish Lionfish spread could become 'most devastating marine invasion in history'   Wed., Aug. 13, 2008 / ap.org       Doug Kesling / NOAA via AP - These lionfish were seen swimming at a depth of about 130 feet roughly 55 miles off the coast of North Carolina in July 2006.     SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - A maroon-striped marauder with venomous spikes is rapidly multiplying in the Caribbean's warm waters and even off the East Coast — swallowing native species, stinging divers and generally wreaking havoc on an ecologically delicate region.  The red lionfish, a tropical native of the Indian and Pacific oceans that probably escaped from a Florida fish tank, is showing up everywhere — from the coasts of Cuba and Hispaniola to Little Cayman's pristine Bloody Bay Wall, one of the region's prime destinations for divers.  Wherever it appears, the adaptable predator corners fish and crustaceans up to half its size with its billowy fins and sucks them down in one violent gulp.  Research teams observed one lionfish eating 20 small fish in less than 30 minutes.  ""This may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history,"" said Mark Hixon, an Oregon State University marine ecology expert who compared lionfish to a plague of locusts. ""There is probably no way to stop the invasion completely.""  A white creature with maroon stripes, the red lionfish has the face of an alien and the ribbony look of something that survived a paper shredder — with poisonous spikes along its spine to ward off enemies.  Scale of invasion is unique  The invasion is similar to that of other aquarium escapees such as walking catfish and caulerpa, a fast-growing form of algae known as ""killer seaweed"" for its ability to crowd out native plants. The catfish are now common in South Florida, where they threaten smaller fish in wetlands and fish farms.  In Africa, the Nile Perch rendered more than 200 fish species extinct when it was introduced into Lake Victoria. The World Conservation Union calls it one of the 100 worst alien species invasions.  ""Those kinds of things happen repeatedly in fresh water,"" Hixon said. ""But we've not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before.""  The lionfish so far has been concentrated in the Bahamas, where marine biologists are seeing it in every habitat: in shallow and deep reefs, off piers and beaches, and perhaps most worrisome, in mangrove thickets that are vital habitats for baby fish.  Some spots in the Bahamian archipelago between New Providence and the Berry Islands are reporting a tenfold increase in lionfish just during the last year.    Mark Albins / Oregon State University via AP - A lionfish swims off Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas in July 2007.    Northern Caribbean islands have sounded the alarm, encouraging fishermen to capture lionfish and divers to report them for eradication.  The invasion would be ""devastating"" to fisheries and recreational diving if it reached Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to Eugenio Pineiro-Soler of the Caribbean Fishery Management Council.  ""I think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish, and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish,"" said Bruce Purdy, a veteran dive operator who has helped the marine conservation group REEF with expeditions tracking the invasion."

The pain is greatest approximately 1 to 1.5 hour after the injury and usually lasts 6 to 12 hours. Some people have pain or tingling sensations around the wound for several days or weeks. On rare occasions when the venom spreads to other parts of the body, people may experience headaches, cramping, nausea, paralysis, seizures and chills.  The most common treatment for a lionfish sting is to:   Remove the spine (if it broke off in the skin). Place the wound in hot (45oC) water for 30-90 minutes or until the pain is gone. Give a tetanus shot and possibly antibiotics"
