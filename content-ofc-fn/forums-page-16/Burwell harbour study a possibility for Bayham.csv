At Thursday’s council meeting, Mayor Lynn Acre told council she had been asked by Elgin-Middlesex-London MP Joe Preston to come up with ideas for infrastructure projects in the municipality. When polling councillors, Deputy Mayor Cliff Evanitski suggested a hydrological study of the mouth of the Big Otter Creek could find answers to many long-unanswered questions.  It is known the Big Otter is the largest source of sediment on the north shore of Lake Erie. But, when dredging has taken place in the past, the harbour has filled in as the result of storms, not sedimentation from the creek.  Past suggestions have included punching holes in the rock pier to allow the natural flow along the shoreline and narrowing the channel.  â€œUntil we have someone look at it, we can sit and talk about it until we’re blue in the face,â€ Evanitski said, adding the study results would help with future planning.  Coun. Wayne Casier agreed, saying if the harbour were more user-friendly, people would come."
