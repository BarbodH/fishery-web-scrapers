The new teams will work out of Thunder Bay, North Bay and Bancroft. Three canine teams are already working out of Dryden, Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury.  The teams provide valuable support in tracking violators from poaching or crime scenes, and locating concealed fish and wildlife, firearms and other evidence of crimes. They also play a key role in search and rescue efforts, and take part in education and community outreach activities.  “These new canine teams will expand and strengthen the ability of our conservation officers to inspect, enforce, educate and collaborate with other agencies,” said Natural Resources Minister Donna Cansfield. “Since 1990, canine teams have helped Ontario’s conservation officers protect our natural resources and keep our great outdoors safe.”  Canine teams are made up of one conservation officer handler and a highly trained dog. Each team must complete a 16-week training course at the ministry canine training centre in Sudbury, and attend refresher training sessions throughout their time of service. Canines accompany their handlers every day to work and ride with them in boats, snow machines, helicopters and all-terrain vehicles.  In addition to working with conservation officers, the Ministry of Natural Resources’ canine teams also provide assistance to the Ontario Provincial Police, municipal police services and other natural resources agencies."
