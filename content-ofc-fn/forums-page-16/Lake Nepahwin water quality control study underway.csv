The water body, which is one of the deeper lakes in the area, is home to populations of cold water fish, such as lake trout and splake, as well as smallmouth bass, northern pike, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed and white sucker. The lake is approximately 127 hectares in size with a shoreline length of 11.8 kilometres, according to a report by K. Smart Associates of Sudbury entitled Lake Nepahwin Stormwater Quality Control, published July 28. There are 1,822 permanent residents and three seasonal occupants along its shores.  The City of Greater Sudbury has completed a Municipal Class Environmental Assessment for the lake and its drainage area.  The object is to protect water quality and reduce potential flooding of private property by controlling storm-water runoff, said Ronald Norton, drainage engineer with the City of Greater Sudbury. He was commenting after a public meeting at Countryside Arena Wednesday evening for landowners and residents located in the watershed of the lake, from Walford Road, to the Lo-Ellen Park area, to Harrison Drive off Long Lake Road.  The problem identified is that there are six major storm sewers that drain into the lake, located along the north, west and southern shorelines. As storm-water enters the sewer system through catch basins and ditch inlets, pollutants, garbage and sediment end up in the lake. In 2007, over 300 truckloads of sediment was removed from the lake by the city.  Snowmelt and rainfall in the urban area of the Lake Nepahwin Watershed wash many urban pollutants into the lake, including suspended solids, heavy metals, petroleum residues, floatables like coffee cups and plastic water bottles, salts, fertilizers and pesticides from lawns and gardens, pet waste and wildlife droppings, such as geese.  The storm sewers carrying pollutants into the lake at the various locations around the lake are quite large, 30 inches to 78 inches, said Norton.  “People whose properties are next to the outlets really notice what is washed into the lake. Their remarks about pop cans, coffee cups, and oil slicks coming out of the outlets and into the lake are the most common comments we received at the public sessions we have held,” said Norton.  After receiving more public comments by the end of the month, staff will prepare a report to city council next month on what options are available to filter out contaminants flowing into the lake, as well as a public education program, said Norton.
