On a sweltering July day an army of workers was visible hauling cedar rails, toting large rocks and wading through a once sluggish creek.  This was the scene that greeted Ontario's minister of natural resources, Donna Cansfield. Surrounded by members of the Lake Manitou Area Association, the Manitoulin Streams group, the Stewardship Rangers and local landowners, she made her way to the banks of Norton's Creek. The minister received a firsthand glimpse into the ongoing efforts to rehabilitate the historical cold water Brook Trout stream.  Seija Deschenes, Manitoulin Streams co-ordinator, was on hand to make sure the itinerary flowed smoothly. ""Manitoulin Streams wants to rehabilitate the upper creek to help benefit the productivity of native brook trout and to increase the available spawning habitat for the wild Lake Nipigon strain brook trout that have been stocked by the MNR into Lake Manitou,"" she explained. ""It is our intent to improve bank stability by installing fencing that will inhibit cattle access to the river.""  The minister was also accompanied by MNR representative Bob Florean.  ""In 2007 College Bor≈Ωal students conducted stream surveys on behalf of Manitoulin Streams,"" he said. ""This stream (Norton's Creek) is the most impacted because of cattle erosion over the past 50 years. Just picture the damage caused by a 500-pound steer stepping into the stream for a drink.""  He showed the minister where volunteers were busy building cedar rail fencing approximately 75 feet back from the creek. ""Cedar is a sustainable harvest,"" he noted. ""It's cost-effective to use local cedar and, of course, it will last for a hundred years.""  Mr. Florean also introduced the minister to the local Stewardship Rangers and Ontario Rangers from Killarney. The group of 17-year-olds was immersed in carrying boulders, creating pool and riffle areas and placing woody material along the shoreline for cover.  ""Fifty years ago this stream was only two metres wide,"" Mr. Florean added. ""It kept eroding and falling in. But with the help of the rangers, it has been cleaned up quite a bit. They even found a gravel pit nearby to use to improve brook trout habitat.""  Assiginack Reeve Leslie Fields also joined the tour of the site. She reaffirmed her township's commitment to the Manitoulin Streams project.  ""Our generation made some mistakes so we are trying to bring it back,"" she said. ""We know we have a responsibility to return things to as natural a state as possible. When the cattle were first placed on this land, there may have been 10 head or so. But as time went on, the herd grew to a hundred so they changed the natural course of things. It's up to us to take action for future generations.""  For Minister Cansfield, the visit to Manitoulin confirmed that the MNR's funding is producing positive results. She praised the volunteers and the rangers for working together to improve water quality and fish habitat.  ""They genuinely care about the land and want to make it better than they found it,"" she observed. ""The MNR has contributed $60,000 to the stewardship and ranger programs in the Manitoulin area. The more the MNR can do to support this work the better.""  In her view, the unique resources of Manitoulin are worthy of preservation. ""Preservation of the trout and the coldwater streams is a priority with the MNR,"" she said. ""It is important to do a good restoration job because it will bring in a lot of tourist dollars for the local economy.""  During her visit the Expositor asked her about the potential of a wild turkey release on the Island in the future. She stressed that an environmental assessment process is underway to determine the feasibility of such a project.  ""They have experienced extraordinary success elsewhere in southern Ontario,"" she said. ""If wild turkeys were to be released on Manitoulin, it would be necessary to keep it controlled. Hunters would have to be educated and well versed in the turkey shoot. The assessment study is going to show us if it is appropriate for this area. We know there are successful pheasant hunts here so it is not dissimilar to that.""  Her visit to Manitoulin reinforced the necessity of not only protecting the vulnerable coldwater streams, but the Great Lakes as well. She noted that increases in rain and snowfall this past autumn and winter have helped somewhat.  ""As we continue to monitor water levels, the provincial government is also participating in the International Joint Commission's five-year study to better understand the cause of low water levels in the Upper Great Lakes,"" she said."
