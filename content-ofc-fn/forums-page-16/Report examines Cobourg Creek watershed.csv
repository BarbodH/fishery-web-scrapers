About 25 of those people came out to the Ganaraska Region Conservation Authority's (GRCA) public meeting in Baltimore on Wednesday to see what scientists and engineers had found out about the water and lands where their homes, farms and businesses are located. The region covers the area south of Rice Lake which includes Hamilton Township, Cobourg and part of Alnwick-Haldimand Township. The creeks include Baltimore, Brook Road and Midtown: there are four branches that converge and empty into Lake Ontario.  ""We need to marry the science and community needs,"" GRCA water resource manager Mark Peacock said.  A background report for the plan looks at features ranging from its geology, created by glacial activity, to the fisheries and human habitation.  ""Water is the engine that drives everything,"" he said.  How the water moves through the watershed, and that impact, is key, and ""Cobourg Creek is one of the gems in Ontario.""  Both the water quality and quantity are good and it is ""one of the best fishery resources in Ontario,"" Mr. Peacock said.  The Cobourg Creek watershed covers 123 square kilometres and includes the historic Lake Iroquois Shore Line when the waterline was much higher and is evident along County Roads 28 and 45, says GRCA stewardship technician Pam Lancaster. There are four tributaries, 32 private water structures and two dams: Pratt's at Elgin and Ontario streets in Cobourg and Ball's in Baltimore, she said.  There are 37 fish species identified in Cobourg Creek, although most people only know about trout and salmon.  Within 50 metres of the creek system, eight per cent of the lands are developed and 18 per cent is used for agriculture, Ms. Lancaster said.  The plan to be developed is likely to include goals to preserve the quantity and quality of ground and surface water, enlarge the forested area, protect fish habitat and preserve the area's cultural heritage, she said.  The public was then asked to share at least three concerns/priorities they had as input into shaping the watershed's future.  Input and direction will also come from a community advisory committee for which members are being sought.  For more information call 905- 885-8173 ext 247 or e-mail [emailÂ protected]"
