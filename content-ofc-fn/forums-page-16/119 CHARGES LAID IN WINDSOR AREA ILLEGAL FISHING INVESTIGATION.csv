239950,Spiel,2008-08-15 12:03:00,9059,"119 CHARGES LAID IN WINDSOR AREA ILLEGAL FISHING INVESTIGATION   Ministry of Natural Resources NEWS August 14, 2008    A 16-month investigation into illegal fishing has resulted in 119 charges against three Windsor-area people and a Windsor business.  On May 15, 2008, Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers executed search warrants on residences in the Town of Lasalle and a commercial establishment in the City of Windsor. Conservation officers seized two vehicles, one boat, fish processing equipment, fishing gear and a quantity of fish.  The 119 charges have now been laid against two individuals from Lasalle, one individual from Woodslee and a commercial establishment in Windsor. The charges include catching overlimits of fish, buying and selling fish illegally, transporting illegally caught fish, and illegally possessing a gill net and hook line.  Conservation officers allege that the offences took place between April 2007 and May 2008 when large quantities of fish were taken from the Detroit River and the part of Lake Erie adjacent to Essex County.  In order to harvest and sell fish in Ontario, a commercial fishing licence is required from the Ministry of Natural Resources. Fish retail outlets can only purchase fish for the purpose of resale from fish processing plants or holders of commercial fishing licences. It is also illegal for anyone to purchase or sell any angler-caught fish.  To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours.
