Plans to halt the collection of the dead fish were in place Wednesday (July 16) when the Citizen went to press, but were changed a day later.  ""We had a number of residents call in and request that we continue pick-up,"" said Joanne Paquette, communications officer for the Durham works department. The fish have been washing up on Lake Simcoe and other downstream water bodies for weeks now. Tests have still not shown the exact cause of the die-off. Brock Mayor Larry O'Connor also questioned why the Region had planned to stop collection.  ""Pick-up will continue until the end of the month and then will be adjusted accordingly. Our residents they can expect pick-up to continue to service their needs,"" he said in an e-mail.  Collection will come Monday, Wednesday and Friday of next week (July 21, 23, 25) as well as Monday, July 28 and Wednesday, July 30."
