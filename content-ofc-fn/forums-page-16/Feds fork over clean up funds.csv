York-Simcoe MP Peter Van Loan made the cheque presentation to representatives from the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, Ministry of Natural Resources, York Environmental Stewardship and Friends of the Maskinonge.  The money is almost two thirds of the $77,000 total cost and is also supported by the towns of Georgina and East Gwillimbury and York Region.  ""The Maskinonge is an important part of Lake Simcoe's watershed,"" said Virginia Hackson, chairperson of the conservation authority, expressing her thanks.  ""Community concern about the Maskinonge River's health has been increasing,"" Mr. Van Loan said. ""Today's announcement is a first step on working to reverse the decline of a river under environmental stress.""  The conservation authority will also be receiving $17,150 to reduce phosphorus and soil erosion by planting riparian areas along the East Holland River and $13,000 to the Roches Point Eco Park project.  These projects are part of the federal government's $30 million program over five years to preserve and protect Lake Simcoe."
