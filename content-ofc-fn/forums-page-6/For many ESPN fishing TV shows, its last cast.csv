485736,Spiel,2010-07-16 11:20:00,9065,"For many ESPN fishing TV shows, its last cast   July 12, 20210 / www.great-lakes.org  ESPN's recent announcement that it will dump nearly all of its outdoor shows by the end of the year is disappointing news for boating.  There'd been rumblings for a few weeks that things weren't quite right with the ESPN2 outdoor blocks, but news on May 21 that the ESPN network would dump all its outdoor programming at the end of this year was nonetheless a shock to the entire outdoors industry.  And with the news comes logical speculation over the future of BASS, which the network owns. It'll be weeks or months until the full ramifications of the news materialize, but clearly, the unstable world of outdoor media was dealt another serious blow today.  ESPN's ""Outdoor Block"" was a long and storied cornerstone of outdoor programming. It grew from the first broadcast of The Fishin' Hole in 1980 to encompass a wide array of fresh- and saltwater fishing, as well as hunting varietals.  The Fishin' Hole, although now off the air, is still the second-longest running show ever aired on ESPN networks, bested only by SportsCenter. ESPN offered outdoor programming for 30 years as it grew from genre pioneer to powerhouse. It brought an integrity and worldwide reach to the genre that had never been there before.  The network giant even formed a separate ESPN Outdoors division to focus on the market and in 2005, aggressively branched into competitive bass programming with shows like Loudmouth Bass, BassCenter, Bass Tech and same-day coverage of Bassmaster Majors. Although those shows went by the wayside after a short run, ESPN did continue with BASS-centric programming like Day on the Lake.  But as the network proceeds with a core mission to focus on live and event-based broadcasting, such programming is out the window. The weekend block will now be filled by other properties, such as English Premier League soccer, NASCAR and SportsCenter, which are all either live or event-based programs.  Thus the only show in the current outdoor block that will continue to air on ESPN2 is The Bassmasters, which focuses on Elite Series events, as well as Bassmaster Classic programming.  The ESPN-owned Saltwater Series will not air on ESPN2.  The news does revive rumors that ESPN is actively engaged in an effort to sell BASS. Earlier this spring, there was significant talk about a potential sale of BASS to the Outdoor Channel. No confirmed news surfaced, but highly placed industry officials firmly believed that talks between the two companies did take place.  If ESPN is divesting itself of outdoor programming that would seem to indicate that its interest in BASS lies only within a potential to broadcast BASS events. BASS's membership program, print media, or youth, conservation and grassroots programs would not seem to fit into that equation.  And sale chatter did noticeably intensify with many industry sources noting that BASS and the Outdoor Channel are deep in talks, but that BASS's print business is something the Outdoor Channel might not be willing to invest in. A BASS official addressed the rumors of a potential BASS sale by saying: ""There's nothing there to announce right now. As with any business, the potential for a sale exists. It's a coveted property. People are looking into it. But again, there's nothing to announce there.""  ESPN's decision to dump its outdoor programming parallels decisions being made across media as a whole.  The trend today is toward niche production and delivery – channels, magazines and digital properties narrowly tailored to fit a specific fan or enthusiast base.  Just as cornerstone outdoor periodicals find it more and more difficult to profit through appeal to a wide reader base of different types of hunters and anglers, it appears ESPN struggles to capture and hold a profitable chunk of outdoor-viewer households – even after the network's programming shifted to a heavy focus on saltwater fishing at the expense of freshwater.  Cable television now is rife with niche channels dedicated to the outdoors, including Sportsman Channel, Outdoor Channel, World Fishing Network (WFN) and Pursuit. As well, the Versus Network carries a heavy load of outdoor programming, including carriage of FLW Outdoors programming.  Sportsman channel president Willy Burkhardt, formerly of ESPN, today told BassFan: ""This announcement isn't much of a surprise as it's been evident for quite some time that outdoor-related programming really doesn't fit comfortably with the strategy and brand position of ESPN. Serving the information and entertainment needs of the American sportsmen is about celebrating a lifestyle and a way of life rather than covering an event or competition.""  Burkhardt added: ""At Sportsman Channel, we believe passionately in the sportsman lifestyle and our programming strategy and brand position reflect this. It makes sense to us that sportsmen have been gravitating to channels and brands that reflect a commitment to the lifestyle rather than a broader sports-entertainment orientation. It's our authenticity and commitment to the genre that has helped us to grow rapidly over the last several years and we hope that this trajectory will continue as we seek better and deeper ways to serve the community.""  The strength of ESPN's outdoor programming, however, will heavily impact those who produce shows for the other networks, and will further escalate the already desperate struggle for underwriting.  Supporting manufacturers regularly buy into shows on various networks to ensure their message reaches the widest audience possible. But as the former ESPN shows find new homes on existing networks, supporting sponsors will surely eliminate duplication.  How many shows on a single network will a Mercury, Evinrude or Yamaha sponsor? RealTree, Pure Fishing, Rapala, Skeeter, Triton, Ranger and other corporate giants will no doubt re-examine their show portfolios this fall and many shows already on the edge will be left without category sponsors and hence lose their profitability.  It all signals an intensification of the shakeout as cable networks, fishing leagues, pros, magazines and digital properties all battle for their chunk of a shrinking revenue stream. And as that stream shrinks, the do-all-for-everybody media properties struggle the most."
485787,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-16 16:07:00,932,I'm fine with having to order WFN to watch fishing shows . . . I don't think I ever tuned into ESPN for one.  It will be interesting to see what happens to BASS though . . . I suspect it will be sold.

A group of 3 private (ie. not tied to any corporation) individuals bought bass from ESPN in the fall of 2010.  This is the best thing that ever could have happened to BASS, because ESPN was killing it.  Meet the New Owners of Bass"
