437827,Spiel,2010-02-27 17:22:00,9065,"Attention All Nottawasaga Steelheader Members,   Partners and Friends:   Massive Quarry proposed for Shelburne Threatens Farmland and 2 Key Watersheds - The Nottawasaga and Grand Rivers   ***Please note that the point regarding the status of Lake Sturgeon has been corrected. Lake Sturgeon have been changed to a status of ""Threatened"" from a previous status of ""Species of Concern"". This is one place above the ""Endangered"" status.   For a listing of all species at risk, go to: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/Species/2ColumnSubPage/276722.html#glossary   Perhaps if you are not aware, its time you become aware and in case you are not involved, well in fact you should get involved!! I attended a recent meeting of NDACT (Northern Dufferin Agricultural Community Task Force) and community on Saturday, January 16th in Honeywood, just outside of Shelburne. A major event, that very well could play out, may result in irreparable damage to both the Nottawasaga and Grand River watersheds not to mention the consumption of thousands of acres of prime agricultural land. The fall-out effects, years and decades afterwards are enormous and may put into place situations we may never recover from. The location in question is in the North Dufferin, Sheburne area. The situation is that the Highland Companies, a large funded organization from the US has purchased a large piece (in fact a very large piece of prime land-7000-8000 acres loaded with highly prized aggregate for export and sale to the market globally). They have done so by offering several thousand dollars more than the going rate. The objective is to extract this aggregate from a massive quarry that will dwarf any previous quarry...approximately 2400 acres. The potential worth (per acre) of this aggregate is in the several millions of dollars. Multiply that by 2400 acres and you get the picture of the dollar draw to this group.  This land in question could soak up potentially important Canadian and Ontario based agriculture. Well...if you wish to be even more dependent on the amount of vegetables you buy from other countries that this company will be exporting to, I guess you don't have a problem. If you are concerned and you feel the ripple effect downstream and I do mean downstream both ecologically and as well as economically, then you better put your gears in motion and get involved in supporting the effort to halt this proposal. The Highland Companies group on their website uses terms like ""responsible"" and saying its ""their home"".  At the meeting Saturday, the NDACT and the community stated flat-out that they (Highland Companies) are NOT welcomed and have bought themselves in. They are from Boston and are supported by huge US hedge funds. Once they have exhausted the treasures they seek, they will go elsewhere leaving a huge hole in the ground.  There is absolutely no way they can determine accurately ""for sure"" the ecological destruction that could occur from this high level of activity to the watersheds (Nottawasaga and Grand Rivers) that get their important water from  this area. I am sure they can try to compensate farmers for loss of income. But they cannot compensate for loss of critical ecology immediately and downstream.  It is bad enough that we have already seen changes in angling quality of many species in the Nottawasaga River watershed including walleye, rainbow trout and even sturgeon that have gone past the point of being designated in the Species at Risk of Ontario grouping of ""Special Concern"" to that of ""Threatened"". The risks of the legacy this quarry project could leave, are far more ominous than we could even start to understand and appreciate.  Why?  Because the effects may not play out for years to come. The wake could be felt for generations to come. They use the term ""responsible"". They couldn't even begin to understand that term because they are firstly responsible to their shareholders or investors. Their key principles, managers and executive do not reside here. So how could they really care as members of the community.  Another important point to note is that this area is associated with the designation of critical and sensitive World Biosphere status. Perhaps even more ominous is the fact that government, at all levels, will see this as a real cash opportunity and since it involves international, the stakes are high. The community and NDACT, (after understanding the Site 41 fiasco and those that have suffered from it and continue to do so), have stated that they do not trust the government since the key government officials job as always is to find ways to make things like this happen and to""clear the way"".  They again have no conscience because they will not be held responsible or accountable for their decisions now for the outcome tomorrow.  It is almost certain with the stakes this high, as we speak, that this group is putting all their ducks in a row and making sure by lobby or whatever power they have, that government will be their partner.    NDACT needs your support both as a member and a financial supporter. Our road with them will require some deep pockets and associations with influential people.   I ask you to do three (3) things:  1. After reading this, please pass this on to as many people you can, friends, relatives and people of influence (print it out for those who don't read email).  2. Go to the NDACT Website and become a member.  It's only $30.00. http://www.ndact.com/NDACT/Welcome.html  3. Contact your local MP and MPP.  Tell them you are strongly opposed and ask them for their support.   Thank you Gary Christie President, Nottawasaga Steelheaders Visit our website at www.nottawasaga.org"

437908,irishfield,2010-02-27 23:01:00,26272,"If they want support they need to find a better writer! The way it's compiled above sounds like someone scorned, that they got out bid on a piece of land.. nothing else."
