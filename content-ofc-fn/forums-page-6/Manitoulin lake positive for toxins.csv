Samples taken by the Ministry of the Environment from the north end of Ice Lake contained a number of species of cyanobacteria -- blue-green algae -- which can produce toxins.  Further testing is underway. Ice Lake has had blue-green algae blooms in the past, the most recent being 2007, the health unit said in a release.  ""Visible algal blooms may produce toxins; therefore, using or drinking the water should be avoided,"" said Dan Burns, a public health inspector with the health unit.  The highest concentrations of toxins are usually found in blooms and scum on the shoreline. These dense accumulations pose the greatest potential risks to people and pets.  ""People do not usually drink water contaminated with bluegreen algal blooms because of its unsightly pea soup appearance and foul smell,"" said Burns.  Toxins can irritate the skin and, if ingested, can cause diarrhea and vomiting. At high enough levels, toxins may cause liver and nervous system damage.  The health unit advises people using lakes and rivers to be on the lookout for algal blooms.  If blooms are visible:  * Avoid using the water for drinking, bathing, or showering and do not allow children, pets, or livestock to drink or swim in the water.  * Lakeshore residents with shallow drinking water intake pipes that might pump in bluegreen algae should be cautious.  * Residents should not boil the water because boiling the water may release more toxins into the water.  * Residents should avoid cooking with the water because food may absorb toxins from the water during cooking.  * Residents should exercise caution with respect to eating fish caught in water where blue-green algal blooms occur. Residents should not eat the liver, kidneys and other organs of fish caught in the water.  * Do not treat the water with a disinfectant like bleach. This may break open algae cells and release toxins into the water.  * Residents should not rely on water jug filtration systems as they do not protect against the toxins."
