463506,TJQ,2010-05-06 13:20:00,7805,"Atlantic salmon are coming home to Bronte Creek Area youth part of significant Lake Ontario environmental restoration effort  Today, an exciting environmental and educational initiative is happening on the Bronte Creek, thanks to the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.), Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Pioneer Petroleums and many other partners. Classroom hatchery-raised Atlantic salmon will be released on Bronte Creek at 11:00 a.m. at Lowville Park, in the Village of Lowville.  ""More than a century after Atlantic salmon were declared locally extinct from the waters of Lake Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and our partners are pleased to be here on the banks of Bronte Creek with 180 elementary school students, as we take part in this historic effort to bring back the salmon,"" said Mike Reader, O.F.A.H. Executive Director.  Since its launch in 2006, the Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program (Bring Back the Salmon) has stocked almost two million Atlantic salmon in Duffins Creek, Cobourg Brook and the Credit River, tributaries of Lake Ontario. Thousands of volunteer hours have been dedicated to assisting in this ambitious effort that includes research and monitoring, habitat improvement, and education and outreach. McMaster University's Let's Talk Science graduate students have mentored several classroom hatcheries in the Hamilton area and will be on hand to help the students release their fish into the creek.  Pioneer Petroleums is committed to supporting the Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program by hosting environmental education field trips. Participating classes and outdoor education centres are able to take outdoor excursions to learn more about Atlantic salmon habitat and to release their classroom-raised Atlantic salmon in targeted tributaries.  ""Pioneer believes that it is our corporate responsibility to support local environmental action,"" said Tim Hogarth, CEO, Pioneer Petroleums. ""We are proud to be a part of the Bring Back the Salmon program that engages young people in making a positive difference to the waterways in their community.""  Stocking the Bronte Creek with classroom hatchery-raised Atlantic salmon is part of an internationally acclaimed endeavor that was spearheaded by the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, with support from over 40 conservation partners, including the Banrock Station Wetland Foundation Canada, LCBO Natural Heritage Fund, Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association, Fish For Ever Foundation, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Helping with the Bronte Creek event are McMaster University Let's Talk Science graduate student volunteers, Community Stream Steward Program, Trout Unlimited Canada, Oakville and District Rod and Gun Club and Conservation Halton.
