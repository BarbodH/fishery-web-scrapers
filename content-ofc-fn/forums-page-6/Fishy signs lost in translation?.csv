Tuesday August 16/2011   Environment Hamilton members have taken to posting signs warning of contaminated fish near the Hamilton International Airport over the weekend out of frustration that the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority hasn’t done enough to protect the public.  “The most pressing public health issue as a result from this is the fact that for more than a quarter of the population shouldn’t eat virtually any fish that you would catch along this stretch of the waterway,” said Joe Minor, executive board member of Environment Hamilton.  Minor posted four signs Friday and was out posting as many as 20 more Monday, warning people against eating any fish and leaving a number at EH to call.  “There hasn’t been any real public education campaign about this,” says Minor.  The federal government has known about PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) contamination at Lake Niapenco and along the Welland River watershed since 2009. Environment Canada scientists were studying organic toxin accumulation in Hamilton Harbour and the Humber River in Toronto, and picked Lake Niapenco as a control site.
