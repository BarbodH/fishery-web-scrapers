Southern Georgian Bay OPP have been investigating a series of break and enters to ice huts - as well as some fishing tackle that was discovered - dating back to February 22. “As a result of the investigation most of the owners of the found fishing tackle have been located and six youths from the Penetanguishene area have been dealt with using the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act,” stated Const. David Hobson, adding anyone who is missing any ice fishing tackle from their ice hut on Penetanguishene Bay this winter should go to the Southern Georgian Bay Detachment to view the recovered tackle."
