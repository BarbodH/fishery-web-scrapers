This Saturday, the Hamilton Harbour Fishing Derby will give families a great excuse to enjoy the waterfront.  In addition to the fishing derby from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., the third annual Happy Dayz in Hamilton Festival will follow. Plus, harbour cruises will be available at a reduced rate of $6.  A number of private fishing boats will also take people onto the water for the derby.  Prime spots will be stocked with fish and the catch-and-release fishing derby will offer several prizes, including longest fish in each category and most fish caught.  Only live fish will be measured.  Prizes will be awarded at 1:30 p.m. at 47 Discovery Dr., at the foot of James Street North. All participants under 12 will receive a prize for attending.  Check-in stations for the derby will be located at Pier 8 (Williams Coffee Pub and the north side of Discovery Centre); Bayfront Park (boat launch ramp); the fishway (on the Waterfront Trail); and at LaSalle Park (boat ramp).  Werner Plessl, executive director of the Hamilton Waterfront Trust, said the fun day offers a great opportunity for youth to learn how to fish ""and they can walk away with their own fishing rod."" About 1,000 fishing poles will be given away to those who need them.  Last year the event attracted between 5,000 and 6,000 people.  Plessl said Saturday's events also celebrate the efforts by various government levels to improve the water quality.  ""The water is clear.""
