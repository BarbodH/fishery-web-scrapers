Mary Muter says the latest forecasts by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers indicates water levels could drop below chart datum by October.  ""At the end of May, Michigan-Huron levels were about five inches above chart datum, which is the reference point used on navigational charts to measure the depth of water throughout the lakes,"" Muter says.  ""We could be setting record low levels by this fall.  ""What's unusual about the latest graphs for Michigan-Huron-Georgian Bay is that the normal down-up-down line has been replaced by almost a flat line.  ""Anyone who has looked at the water level graphs over the years notices a familiar pattern. Water levels start off low in the winter, go up steadily in the spring and then start dropping off gradually from July until the end of the year.  ""But this typical rise hasn't happened and the Corps is predicting only a very slight rise in June and July, followed by the usual late-season decline.""  She says Michigan-Huron water levels in May were 10 inches below those of last year and the Corps report indicates they were 14 inches below the long-term average.  ""All the other Great Lakes were also below the long-term average, but none as much as Michigan-Huron.  ""I've have never seen water levels flat line like they have been doing since January,"" she added.  ""Lakes Michigan and Huron are suffering a double whammy. There is no control of the outflow from Michigan, Huron and Georgian Bay, while the outflow from Lake Superior (into Michigan- Huron) has been reduced because Superior's levels are down.  ""Without any control of the outflow and the reduced supply from Lake Superior -plus the dry winter with little runoff -we are getting hit from all sides.  Muter says water levels have been hovering around chart datum for about 10 years.  ""The International Upper Great Lakes Study Board likes to compare this past decade to the 1930s and says it has happened before; it's no big deal.  ""The reality is,"" Muter says, ""that in the 1930s they dredged, deepening the St. Clair River channel -Detroit River channel by five feet. They knew that they were lowering lake levels. During that decade there was a severe drought in the Great Lakes area.  ""Those were two compounding factors that caused the 1930s low water levels.  ""But, we have not had anything like that!  ""We've had some dry years in late 1990s and 2001. But we recently had two years of above average precipitation and cooler temperatures. But we've not had droughts, or the channels officially dredged five feet deeper.  ""Yet, we have been hovering around chart datum for 10 years. And now it looks like we are in very serious trouble.""  ""The reality is we could be facing the perfect storm by the end of the summer.  ""Researchers from McMaster University recorded a temperature of 22 to 24 degrees in Georgian Bay a month ago. ""Normally, around the long weekend in May the temperature is 10 to 12 degrees.""  Muter says the combination of low water levels and high temperatures will have an impact on enclosed bays.  ""We are going to have much more algae than in previous years and that will affect water quality, fish life and recreational activites.  Boaters will also be affected if water levels drop below chart datum,"" she said.  ""The Canadian Coast Guard establishes channel depth at 176 meters. At that depth,"" she points out, ""there is a minimum of two meters depth for navigation in small craft channels along the east and north coast of Georgian Bay.  ""In the past decade we have had several years where channel depth has been below chart datum. When that happens the Coast Guard puts white markers in the the channels indicating low water.  ""It's scary for boaters because they don't know how deep the water is. They have to go slow and tilt up their boat's motor. Large sail boats can't navigate the small craft channel because a lot of them have a two meter keel. That affects the local economy big time.""  Georgian Bay Forever, a Canadian environmental group, has been urging the International Joint Commission to act to stop the loss of water from Lakes Michigan and Huron.  The IJC held a series of public meetings earlier this year to hear comments on the December 2009 report of the International Upper Great Lakes Study Board.  Muter noted the Study Board report acknowledged the outflow of Lake Huron into the St. Clair River had increased compared to 1962, lowering the levels of Lakes Michigan, Huron and Georgian Bay by about five inches. But the Board called the loss of water too insignificant to justify any action to prevent further loss.""  The International Join Commission (of which Canada is a member) is reportedly still deliberating.  "" We are supposed to have some sense of where they are going early in July.""  However, she adds, the appointment of the new U.S. chair by President Obama is being held up by the Senate. "
