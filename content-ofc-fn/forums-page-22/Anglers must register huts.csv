Registration is free and helps prevent anglers from abandoning their huts.  Abandoned huts can end up in the water when the ice thaws.  Huts must be registered in fisheries management zone 16, which includes the special designated waters of Lake Simcoe.  To register your ice hut in Ministry of Natural Resources Aurora district’s portion of Lake Simcoe (from Keswick north to Gamebridge), call the Aurora office at 905-713-7400. To register your hut anywhere else on the lake, contact the Midhurst district office at 705-725-7500.  Anglers must remove ice huts from all the waters in fisheries management zone 16, including Lake Simcoe by March 15.  This is the same date lake trout, whitefish and walleye season closes.  The ministry advises anglers to place huts on six-inch high wooden blocks to make it easier to remove them at the end of the season.  Ice hut owners must keep the area around their huts clear of garbage.  For better visibility, registration numbers on ice huts need to be at least two-and-a-half  inches high.  Anglers do not need to register tent-style huts that are made of cloth or synthetic material, if they are less than two square metres in dimension when erected.  For ice hut registration in other districts, refer to the 2008-2009 Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary available from licence issuers, Service Ontario centres, or on the ministry’s website at www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/pubmenu.html#fish"
