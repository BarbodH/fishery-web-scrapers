155759,Spiel,2008-01-30 18:23:00,9059,"Island municipalities favour common 'invasive species' bylaw With enforcement component  by Tom Sasvari / January 30, 2008 manitoulin.ca    ""We are asking for support, not only for an education and promotion program concerning invasive species, but for municipalities to consider bylaws to help ensure that the reckless few don't ruin it for all,"" said Bob Florean, a Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) spokesperson and representative of the Manitoulin Area Stewardship Council (MASC). Mr. Florean spoke at an MMA meeting last week about the Manitoulin and Area Invasive Species Awareness Program.  Mr. Florean said the stewardship council includes 13 members from various organizations around Manitoulin, including MASC, MMA, Manitoulin Tourism Association (MTA), aquaculture, agriculture, fish and game, and lake cottage associations.  ""We have undertaken a number of initiatives,"" said Mr. Florean. ""One initiative the council feels is urgent is to work with the community to prevent the further spread of invasive species harmful to our ecosystems. In the past three years, zebra mussels (and quagga mussels) have taken over Lake Mindemoya, Bass Lake, and been found in Kagawong.""  The spiny water flea is now established in Lake Huron and in many inland lakes on the Island and the North Shore, said Mr. Florean. They compete with juvenile fish for food, and their arrival coincides with a 30 percent decline of native zooplankton found in invaded lakes.  Rusty crayfish have been found in the North Channel and an unknown number of inland lakes, continued Mr. Florean. They can harm local fish populations by eating fish eggs and larvae, and have a voracious appetite for aquatic plants, impacting nursery and spawning habitat for fish.  As well, round gobies have recently been established in large numbers in Lake Huron and the North Channel, and Eurasion watermilfoil has been found in waters near Espanola, Mr. Florean told those at the meeting.  Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is a new fish virus in Lake Huron, continued Mr. Florean. It affects most game fish and many minnow species, kills fish, and can have a devastating impact on the local socio-economic situation.  ""Recent studies have shown that in terms of costs dealing with invasive species, $160 million dollars per year is spent in the US to counteract the negative impacts of invasive species on their ecosystems and infrastructure,"" said Mr. Florean.  ""We have some invasive species that are here and are established, and many others that are poised but can still be kept out,"" said Mr. Florean. The damage caused by invasive species ""will hurt everyone's pocketbooks and the enjoyment of the Island.""  There are over 185 new aquatic species in the Great Lakes basin alone, and many insects and plants are also invasive species in Ontario, meeting participants were told. Mr. Florean pointed to the emerald ash borer and garlic mustard as examples, noting that invasive species are spread through ships, recreational boats, vehicles, ATVs, float aircraft, and the movement of firewood, plants and soil.  The objectives of the invasive species awareness partnership include making the public understand the hazards of key invasive plants, invertebrates and fish. The characteristics for each invasive species present different challenges in preventing their spread.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) is helping to deliver the program provincially under a memorandum of understanding on invasive species. ""The key is to promote public awareness, and to track and monitor the spread of invasive species,"" said Mr. Florean. ""A lot of these invasive species on the waterways come in off ships and through the seaways. And each zebra mussel will hatch 1,000 eggs, and they filter everything out of the food chain.""  However, the problem with invasive species is not just related to the water. ""Other invasive species will come on through vehicles and ATVs and float aircraft. It is as simple as someone bringing brush, which has ash borer, from southern Ontario here,"" said Mr. Florean. ""This is how it starts.""  ""The local fishery is valued at $30 million and maybe even more,"" added Mr. Florean. ""So Manitoulin and area is dependent on social economic and natural resources, such as our lakes and forests.""  ""This is an issue that we all had better be paying attention to,"" continued Mr. Florean. ""We need to educate people on how to prevent the spread of invasive species. And, to do this, it is integral to pull in the entire community.""  The stewardship council is working with the MTA and the OFAH on this issue, meeting participants were told. This past summer the group was able to hire an invasive species liaison, who provided education on the effects and causes of invasive species, and who ""monitored about 30 different lakes in the Manitoulin area,"" Mr. Florean explained.  On December 19 the stewardship council voted in favour of putting up invasive species billboards at the two entrances to Manitoulin. ""The OFAH is looking at having a continuous video played on the Chi-Cheemaun educating passengers on the serious effects of invasive species and how important it is not to bring them to the Island,"" noted Mr. Florean. He pointed out that the MTA provided a work centre for the invasive species liaison person, and the OFAH helps source funding, guidance, technical and logistical expertise.  ""We need the support and help from municipalities,"" said Mr. Florean. ""The public needs to be made more aware of the cause and serious effects that are caused by invasive species.""  He said the stewardship council is suggesting municipalities could do this by including an invasive species fact sheet with their tax bills to local residents. As well, ""municipalities could provide free use of sites where billboards and signs could be installed on invasive species awareness, as well as help install the signs, and distribute the information-it would help out greatly.""  The Manitoulin area is socio-economically dependant on its many and varied natural resource values, Mr. Florean told meeting participants. These natural values are a major factor for attracting people to live and recreate here. Each new invasive species that establishes itself here can erode existing natural values and negatively impact the local economy.  ""It is more effective and economical to prevent the establishment of invasive species then it is to eliminate them once established,"" said Mr. Florean.  The stewardship council is helping to facilitate and fund this awareness initiative, including the setup of invasive species awareness billboards on two main highway approaches to Manitoulin, and place invasive species signs at all area public boat launches.  ""This initiative requires the help of the entire community in order for it to work effectively,"" continued Mr. Florean. ""The public can help by becoming more aware of the issue, be more careful of their actions and advising those others that are not, and report any invasive species actions that have a potential to negatively impact the area.""  ""As municipalities, you could also consider wording a bylaw to help ensure that the reckless few don't ruin it for all of us, and partnering with us on this initiative,"" added Mr. Florean, noting that the stewardship council could provide examples of bylaws from other areas.  ""It would probably be a good idea to have a bylaw all the municipalities can agree on, so we have the same legislation on the Island,"" said Central Manitoulin Reeve Richard Stephens.  Along with Manitoulin, ""this is an initiative I'm hoping will expand toward the Sudbury area,"" said Mr. Florean.  Ken Noland, also a member of the stewardship council, said if the municipalities passed a bylaw, it would be short-listed and detail precisely what enforcement will take place if someone doesn't take the action necessary to prevent an invasive species being brought onto the Island. If found guilty, the offenders would be charged and could end up in court.  By having the municipalities pass these bylaws, it would allow the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the MNR to enforce these laws, meeting participants heard.  ""So when the OPP and MNR are on their normal patrols in the summer, they could charge someone for being in contravention of the bylaws?"" asked Ms. Fields.  This may be possible, said Mr. Florean. He pointed out, ""A lot of the impacts of invasive species have already been felt, but we need to try and hold off more of these species being brought to the Island.""  ""We (MMA municipalities) certainly need to do something and take action on this issue,"" said Mr. Stephens.  People heard that the MNR would be willing to help put together a recommended bylaw concerning invasive species that could be used by all municipalities.  ""We would like to have the signs and bylaws in place before the main tourism travel season begins this year,"" said Mr. Florean. ""And it is imperative the stewardship council know we have that municipal support and will help install signs,"" he said, noting the MNR has 50 signs prepared for local boat launches.  Mr. Stephens indicated he was prepared to put forward a motion indicating the MMA municipalities' support for the signs and passing a bylaw on invasive species.  As well, ""most of our municipal tax bills will be going out in the next month or so, and it would help if we could include a one-page letter of precaution and educating people on invasive species prevention,"" said Ms. Fields.  Mr. Florean pointed out the MNR could produce something everyone could agree on to send to their local residents.  The MMA passed a motion supporting the invasive species public education initiative and indicating it would be interested in creating an Island-wide bylaw."
