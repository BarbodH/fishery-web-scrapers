The proposed total budget is $4.19 million, down from $4.5 million in 2007. Programs paid for by local taxes include some administration, environmental planning, flood control structures and community relations.  Directors accepted a consultant's report that recommended a six per cent increase in salaries, including some pay equity. The total impact of wages on the budget amounts to about $75,000 phased in over two years.  To offset the wage increases directors agreed to cut some discretionary spending.  ""Reasonable compensation for staff comes first,"" said general manager Jim Coffey.  The board rejected suggestions by some directors to reduce staff or cut programs to save money.  Brockton representative Dan Gieruszak wants a review of how successful the authority is at offering its programs.  ""Our strategic plan is 15 years old so we don't know if we are answering the requirements of the many municipalities that we serve to make sure we are spending our resources appropriately,"" he said. Minto representative Don Ross asked directors to consider raising planning fees and drawing on reserves to decrease the levy on municipalities.  Chair Doug Freiburger said he thought the budget should be easy for municipalities to approve, once they consider what they are getting for their money.  ""What do we hear about today? Climate change, environmental footprint, things that everybody is speaking to. That's our business . . . we help take care of water, land and air. That's what the population today wants . . . I think if any (directors) would talk to their ratepayers, they would applaud them in their choice to accept this budget.""  Freiburger, who represents Saugeen Shores on the board, was re-elected as chair for the third consecutive year. Ron Hewitt of Kincardine was acclaimed first vice-chair and Dan Gieruszack was voted in as second vice-chair.  Anne Eadie of Huron Kinloss was selected as this year's past-president, something that is done when the incumbent chair is re-elected and there is no past president on the board."
