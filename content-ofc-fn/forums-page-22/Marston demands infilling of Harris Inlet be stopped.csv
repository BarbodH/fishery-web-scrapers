In a letter sent to Mr. Valeri, Mr. Marston asks that the recently appointed interim CEO place a moratorium on the infilling of Harris Inlet and conduct public meetings on the work, environmentalists say is being conducted in the sensitive ecological area.  The Jan. 18 letter also questions whether the HPA has conducted proper ""due diligence"" before working in the area such as securing Department of Fisheries and Oceans permits. He also requests the HPA ""convene an open and public opportunity for these serious questions to be addressed.""  Even though he has not had a response yet, Mr. Marston is confident the HPA board will take his request seriously.  ""I'm optimistic that Tony Valeri will take a long hard look at this issue,"" he said.  During the last of a series of town hall meetings Mr. Marston recently, Jim Howlett, a Beach Strip resident, who has devoted much of his time documenting the ecosytem of the waterfront and beach area, showed a number of photos of a thriving environmental landscape within Hamilton's industrial area along the waterfront.  Mr. Howlett focused on Harris Inlet, the largest inlet in Hamilton Harbour, located in the eastern area near the Windermere basin. Local residents and environmentalists are concerned the port authority, which acquired the property from Stelco in 2006, for its Pier 22 construction, is infilling the water without obtaining property permits from the federal government.  ""The HPA doesn't think public input is necessary,"" said Mr. Howlett. ""All I've asked them to do is pause so we have a better understanding of what is happening.""  The inlet, named after the Elliot Harris farm around 1875 that was once located in the area, has been continuously fed by a creek since 1836, said Mr. Howlett.  Hidden from view, he said, is a wealth of wildlife, and fauna living and surviving and have endured the effects of industrial pollution. He has seen beaver, large snapping turtles, muskrat and long-nose gar living within the environment.  Mr. Howlett and Mr. Marston both encouraged the public to call their councillors, area politicians and the HPA and voice their opposition to the infilling.  ""Write a letter to Mr. Valeri, send emails to the (Department of Fisheries and Oceans), organize a campaign that asks them not to issue a permit until there is public comment,"" said Mr. Howlett.""  Mr. Marston told about 10 people who showed up for his environment town hall meeting at Orchard Park Secondary School if people are skeptical of the effects of people power, look no further than how the community made a difference as it rallied together to convince the Ontario Liberals to continue offering the Victoria Order of Nurses as home care providers. Environmentalists were also instrumental in mitigating the effects of the Red Hill Creek Parkway construction, turning what could have been a six-lane monstrosity, into a four-lane parkway, with improvements made to protect the area's environment."
