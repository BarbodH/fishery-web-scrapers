153814,Spiel,2008-01-24 10:36:00,9065,"Wildlife federation head charged with overfishing  Wednesday, January 23 2008 thecanadianpress.com   MONTREALâ€“The president of Quebec's wildlife federation, who vowed to make fishermen more responsible, has quit before his arraignment on charges he allegedly exceeded the catch limit when reeling in speckled trout.  Alain Gagnon is also charged with obstructing a provincial wildlife officer in the performance of his duties in the July 2007 incident.  Gagnon allegedly tossed the fish back into the water when confronted by wildlife officials. There is a 20-fish limit when catching speckled trout.  ""After 20 years of involvement at the heart of the federation, Mr. Gagnon has quit his post, saying he is doing it in the best interests of the organization he has led as a volunteer for three years,"" federation spokeswoman Genevieve Clavet said in a statement today.  There is no mention of Gagnon's charges in the statement and Clavet said there would be no further comment.  The Federation quebecoise de la faune said it would elect a new president when it meets in April.  Gagnon, 53, was re-elected president in April 2007 and said one of his priorities was to encourage fishermen to be responsible.  Documents filed at the provincial courthouse in Roberval, where Gagnon is to be arraigned tomorrow, say he was sport fishing on Lac Pimitshikamau, which is part of the Rat River, when he was allegedly found in possession of the quantity of fish.  Both charges against Gagnon carry a maximum fine of $100,000, the documents say.  Chantal Drapeau, a spokeswoman for the provincial Natural Resources and Wildlife Department, confirmed Gagnon had been given a summons to appear in court on the charges but was reluctant to comment further because the matter is before the courts.  ""You'll understand that Mr. Gagnon has not yet been arraigned at the courthouse so we won't be giving any more information in this case,"" she said. ""We will be following the administrative inquiry.""  If Gagnon is found guilty, Drapeau said the fine could vary depending on how many extra fish were caught.  Pierre Barnoti, executive director of the Montreal branch of the SPCA, said he was surprised by the news about Gagnon.  ""Mr. Gagnon, being in the position that he's in, is called to respect an even higher standard than the common person because of what he represents,"" Barnoti said before the resignation was announced.  ""I don't want to pronounce myself because he hasn't been found guilty but if he is found guilty it would be a terrible thing for a person of such responsibility to be so irresponsible."""
