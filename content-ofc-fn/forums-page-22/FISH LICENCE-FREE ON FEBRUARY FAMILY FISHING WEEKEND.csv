Anyone fishing licence-free must follow the conservation licence limits set out in the 2008-2009 Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary.  Information on these limits will be available at each participating site. Anglers should also check the summary for regulations on season closures and gear and bait restrictions, which must be observed.  “I want to thank all of our partners for continuing to support family fishing weekends,” said Cansfield.  “The Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association, the Canadian National Sportfishing Foundation, the Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters Association, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada have all contributed to the success of the weekends, and their continued involvement is appreciated.”  More information about the Ontario Family Fishing Weekend, including how an organization can host an event, is available at www.familyfishingweekend.com."
