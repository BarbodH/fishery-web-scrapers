Last year’s derby had 72 anglers, both young and not-so-young, competing for prizes and enjoying the outdoors while fishing any inland lake in and around the McKellar area.  Last year each junior angler walked away with at least one prize.  This year’s derby will follow the same format as our first ice fishing derby. For adult anglers, prizes will be awarded to the three heaviest fish caught in each of the classes: pike, whitefish/cisco, and crappie. For junior anglers 14 years of age and younger, prizes will be awarded for the heaviest in each of the classes: pike, crappie and perch. There will be door prizes, including one aimed specifically for women. Weigh-ins will be held at the McKellar Community Centre between 6 and 7 p.m. followed by a meal.  The registration cost includes the meal. Those wishing to participate by attending the meal only – as some had last year – and to share in the family fun with the anglers, can purchase the meal at the door, although we encourage you to purchase it earlier as seating is limited. Dinner starts at 7 p.m. and consists of freshly made coleslaw, dinner rolls with butter, oven roasted turkey, cranberry sauce, mixed variety vegetables, mashed potatoes, baked beans, dessert, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The prize ceremony will be hosted by MCA member Mike Corson and will begin immediately after the meal.  To register, please send a cheque payable to MCA (McKellar Conservation Association) for $25 per adult, $10 dollars per child and $10 per person for the meal only. Here is the address: 5 Maplewood Dr., RR#1, C-12, Parry Sound, Ont. P2A 2W7. Should you choose to register in person, you may do so at Steve and Ann Bradley’s home at Manitouwabing Taxidermy, 6 Catherine St., McKellar"
