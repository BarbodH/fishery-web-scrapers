156641,Spiel,2008-02-02 15:00:00,9059,"Complete list of Lake Ontario fishery projects to be funded courtesy of $12 million Love Canal lawsuit settlement  David Figura / January 30, 2008 syracuse.com   Pete Grannis, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, last week announced $12 million in grants to help pay for 43 grants for projects intended to improve the Lake Ontario fishery and research about it.  The money comes courtesy of a Love Canal-related lawsuit settlement worked out in 2006 with Occidental Chemical Corp. The settlement addresses damages to the Lake Ontario fishing caused by the discharge of dangerous chemicals from Occidental's predecessor, Hooker Chemical, into the lake from its main plant in Niagara and from other sites and facilities.  The grant money will cover projects that will enhance fish habitat and research, promote angler outreach and improve public access to the lake and its tributaries. A summary of the all the projects follows:  . FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System  1. Improvements to the NYSDEC Salmon River Fish Hatchery (Fish Population Management/Enhancement Project proposed by the Oswego County, Orleans County and Niagara County Legislatures, Lake Ontario SportfishingStakeholders Coalition, Lake Ontario Fisheries Coalition, Eastern Lake Ontario Trout and Salmon Association, and numerous other groups/individuals). LakeOntario is the most heavily fished fresh water in New York State. The 1996 Angler Survey estimated that 3 million angler days of effort were expended on Lake Ontario and its major tributaries, with an additional 200,000 angler days of effort on the Lower Niagara River. Both of these very heavily fished waters are very dependant on stocking of trout and salmon to satisfy angler desires. Major fisheries for brown and rainbow trout, as well as Chinook and coho salmon would not exist if the Department did not stock large numbers of the these fish. In fact, over 3 million are stocked annually, most of which are raised at the Department's Salmon River Fish Hatchery.  The Salmon River Hatchery provides the integral support needed for these world class fisheries, yet struggles with water temperatures that are less than ideal. During the summer, rearing water temperatures are substantially warmer than desirable, bringing about frequent disease outbreaks. During winter, hatchery water temperatures are always colder than desired, resulting in slower growth and additional disease issues. The hatchery uses well water in an attempt to buffer the effects of the less than optimal temperature regime of it's river water source, however chronic shortages of well water fall short of solving the described problems. The Department has tried to find additional ground water for several years by drilling various wells with limited success.  This project consists of the hiring of an expert consulting firm to evaluate the overall water supply and hatchery practices at the Salmon River Hatchery. The consultant is expected to make recommendations on ways to improve trout and salmon culture at the hatchery by changing the way existing water supplies are used, as well as review options for finding new groundwater, or possibly recommending changes in hatchery practices such as recirculating the current available water supply. While it is impossible to plan for all the permutations of recommendations that may come out of the consultant study, the set aside fund for this project was agreed to by the review committee as an amount that would be in the ballpark for possible hatchery renovations.  The estimated cost for the consultant study is $200,000.This project also sets aside $2 million to implement the recommendations of the consultant.  2. Purchase Automated Fish Marking Trailer (Fish Population Management/ Enhancement Project proposed by the Oswego County, Orleans County and Niagara County Legislatures, Lake Ontario Sportfishing Stakeholders Coalition, Lake Ontario Fisheries Coalition, Eastern Lake Ontario Trout and Salmon Association, and numerous other groups/individuals). The Lake Ontario System is jointly managed by the Department and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. Both FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System agencies agree that the most important management consideration for the continued success of Lake Ontario salmonid fisheries is maintaining a balanced predator/prey relationship. This primarily involves balancing a cyclically abundant alewife (prey) population with a predator population comprised mainly of trout and salmon. The Department has been intensively stocking Lake Ontario with these species since 1970 and it now supports a world class fishery. However, recent surveys indicate that significant production of wild fish, especially Chinook salmon, is now occurring. Annual evaluation programs assess the success of trout and salmon year classes or cohorts, and include programs such as creel surveys, netting assessments, and public contacts. The Department also monitors alewife abundance through netting and hydroacoustic assessments.  In recent years, the predator/prey balance has become increasingly precarious due to declining alewife abundance. The ability to control or influence predator populations is imperative for maintaining the predator prey balance. While management can influence this balance by adjusting stocking numbers, we have no control over how many fish are ecruited to the population from the wild. Hence, one of the most significant pieces of information that is lacking in the management of the Lake Ontario fishery at this time is the contribution of wild fish (especially Chinook salmon) to the fishery. The only feasible and accurate method of determining the relative contributions of stocked and wild fish to the fishery is to mark all stocked fish and monitor the proportions of stocked and wild fish in our annual assessment programs.  In addition to looking at the Chinook salmon population, this equipment can be used to study other desirable Lake Ontario stocked species of sport fish such as steelhead, lake trout and brown trout. These studies could evaluate survival rates of stocked fish as survival can vary greatly from year to year depending on timing, water temperatures, stocking sites, stocking numbers at a given site, stocking method, etc..  This project is for the purchase of an automated fish marking trailer that has the ability to mark very large number of Lake Ontario stocked fish in an efficient and effective manner. Various attempts to hand mark stocked fish have been made in the past with little success due to the high stocking numbers, disease problems, and physical handling stressors on the fish. The ""Autofish""marking trailer developed by Northwest Marine Technology has the ability to clip and tag 60,000 fish per day with little or no effect on the health of the fish. This technology is currently used extensively in the Pacific Northwest and will allow the Department to annually mark 1.6 million Chinooks, 500,000 steelhead, and 500,000 lake trout that are stocked into the lake. While the initial goal of the marking program involves determining the contribution of wild Chinook salmon in the Lake Ontario population, further studies are planned involving other fish species such as lake trout and steelhead. The need for this equipment for the Lake Ontario system is likely to exceed its expected life span of 20 plus years.  The Autofish trailer costs approximately $1.3 million dollars and comes with a four year on-site warranty. This project will also purchase enough tags for three years and provide FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario Systemfunds to make some minor modifications to Salmon River Hatchery to accommodate the trailer ($200,000). Estimated Cost - $1,500,000  3. Lindsey and Stony Creeks Angler Parking Areas, Jefferson Co. (Public Fishing Access project proposed by NYSDEC and the Public at the Watertown Public Meeting). Two, five car angler parking areas will be built on these Lake Ontario Tributaries. Lindsey's will be on Co. Rt. 87 or the Sandy Creek - Ellisburg Road. Stony's will be built on the Danley Road or Co. Rt 152. A footpath to the stream will also be brushed out at this location. Estimated cost - $20,000 ($10,000 each site)  4. Lower Niagara River Access Trails in Artpark, Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP), Niagara Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the NYS OPRHP, Mike Johannes and the Niagara County Fisheries Development Board). Modifications/improvements to two existing trails and creation of an additional trail including signage, placement of crushed stone, repairs or replacement of stairs and rails to enhance access and safety. Stabilization of banks bove and adjacent to the trails and the creation of gabion fishing platforms at appropriate sites resistant to water level changes. Estimated cost - $150,000  5. Salmon River stream bank stabilization/trail project (Habitat Restoration and Public Fishing Access project proposed by Paul Moore and NYSDEC). The Salmon River, located in Oswego County, is the largest cold-water tributary to Lake Ontario and home to the Salmon River Hatchery. The lower 18 mile stretch assessable to lake-run trout and salmon is also the most intensively fished water body in the state with annual effort in excess of one half million angler hours and accounts for approximately 2/3 of the tributary fishing effort for trout and salmon on the New York side of Lake Ontario. The river suffers from inherently unstable bank material combined with sediment transport problems. The river has historically been relatively unstable but the problem was exacerbated with the implementation of year round base flows mandated in the 1996 FERC licensing of the hydroelectric project on the river. Prior to the license, generation occurred in a peaking mode which resulted in alternating periods of very low flow (dam/turbine leakage plus tributary input) and 2,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) during times of peak demand for electricity.  The lower, but continuous base flows resulted in reducing the river's ability to transport the sediment (bed load) to the extent that it did with the daily flushing flows of 2,000 cfs. The result has been a general aggrading (build up) of materials in the channel which results in filling in pools, widening of the channel, increased braiding of the channel and increased bank erosion during times of high flows. Intense angler traffic FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System further contributes to the bank stability/erosion problems.  This project will attempt to address these problems by identifying key problem areas and constructing in-stream improvement structures designed to facilitate sediment transport while creating diverse fish habitat (i.e., pools, runs, etc.). The trail system will be designed to take angler traffic off of the more susceptible banks and encourage access at less vulnerable points along the river. Completion of this project will improve trout and salmon habitat and make angling along the Salmon River safer and more pleasant for participants. Estimated cost - $500,000  6. Village of Lewiston Boat Launch, Niagara Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the Village of Lewiston and Jeff Draper). Repair/improve existing boat launch, including replacement of temporary aluminum docks and repair of damaged concrete pads on the launch. In addition, the Fish Cleaning Station will be expanded to accommodate increased use, and improvements will include heating, an upgrade of the grinder motor and ventilation improvements. The bathrooms will also be upgraded. Estimated cost - $75,000   7. Golden's Marina Renovation, Jefferson Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by NYSDEC and the Public at the Watertown Public Meeting). A modern boat launch will be constructed on the Isthmus to Point Peninsula on Co. Rt. 57 in the Town of Lyme. The old marina has already been dredged but a real property survey and construction design need to be undertaken before modernization of this boat launch site can be accomplished. Estimated cost - $300,000  8. Boat Launch/Ice-fishing Access on Sandy Pond, Oswego Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by American Bass Anglers, Inc., Katie Malinowski, Michael Cusano and others). Build a boat launch that will also provide ice-fishing access to Sandy Pond. Region 7 staff will seek out a landowner willing to sell property to enable the siting of this project. Estimated cost - $500,000 (construction cost only, implementation of this project depends on the funding of land acquisition through the Environmental Protection Fund)  9. Chaumont Bay Boat Launch Sites and Ice-fishing Access, Jefferson Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed at the Watertown Meeting). Region 6 Fisheries and Real Property staff will continue to look for potential boat launch and ice fishing access sites in the Chaumont Bay area including Guffin's Bay and Three-mile Bay.  Region 6 staff will seek out a landowner willing to sell property to enable the siting of this project. Estimated cost - $500,000 (construction cost only, implementation of this project depends on the funding of land acquisition through the Environmental Protection Fund)  10. Sandy Creek Fishing Access Site, Monroe Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by NYSDEC). This 50 car and trailer launch site has a heavily used, paved parking lot in need of re-sealing. Re-sealing now will save added repair costs in the future. Estimated cost - $25,000  11. OPRHP Niagara River Trails; Schoelkopf/ Whirlpool/ Devil's Hole, Niagara Co., (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the NYS Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation). Modifications/improvements to aforementioned trails including signage, placement of crushed stone on trails, repairs or replacement of stairs and rails to enhance access and increase safety. Stabilization of banks above and adjacent to the trails and the creation of gabion fishing platform at appropriate locations resistant to current and water level changes. Estimated cost - $150,000.  12. Fisheries Promotion Assistance, (Angler Outreach and/or Education project, proposed by Niagara County Fisheries Development Board, NY Sea Grant, NYSDEC as well as publicly proposed at several of the public meetings). Sportfishing is very important to the local communities along the Niagara River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. Approximately 40 % of anglers who fish these waters are residents of other states, and approximately 40% of the New York residents live in counties other than the seven that border the Lake Ontario system. DEC estimated the at-location expenditures by anglers along the Lake Ontario System in 1996 at over $100 million. Many anglers need information about where to fish, where to find available boat launches, campgrounds, etc.. The Department developed some very popular fishing brochures in the early 1980's as part of the ""I Love NY"" promotion campaign.  At present, some of the Lake Ontario area Counties are promoting fishing opportunities within their own County, but no one is developing information for the Great Lakes Region as a whole. This project is to assist ongoing DEC and other's fishing promotion activities. Specifically this project will provide funds for the printing or re-printing of fisheries promotion brochures, such as the ""I Love NY Great Lakes Fishing Brochure"". DEC staff in Regions 6 thru 9 and various County fisheries promotion staff are expected to work jointly to develop fisheries promotion brochures and other literature directed toward angling tourists who plan to visit the area from other New York Counties, other states, or International locations. This project will cover the cost of printing and some distribution of this information at sportfishing shows, fairs, and other public events. $100,000 is being reserved from this fund to cover printing costs. Staff time to develop the literature is expected to be covered under existing DEC and county programs. Estimated Cost - $100,000  13. Enhance Fish Island Access Site at Dexter, Jefferson Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the Village of Dexter and the Public at the Watertown Public eeting). This project includes floating docks, improvements to the existing boat ramp and installing lighting. Estimated cost - $45,000  14. Maxwell Creek Fishing Access Site, Wayne Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by NYSDEC). Paving this 40 car gravel/dirt parking lot would be well received by the angling public and minimize the need for re-grading/surfacing. Estimated cost - $50,000  15. Port Bay (East) Fishing Access Site, Wayne Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by NYSDEC). Development of a small, five car lot to allow access to the North end East side of Port Bay. The Department already owns the land. Estimated cost - $2,000  16. Northern Pike Spawning Marsh Rehabilitation (Habitat Restoration Projects proposed by Chippewa Bay Fish and Game Club, St. Lawrence Valley Sportsman's Club, Thomas Jolliff, Dr. John Farrell, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry). Water level regulation on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River has resulted in a compression of annual and long-term water level fluctuation, effectively eliminating extreme high and low water levels. These extremes are important in maintaining wetland plant diversity, and their elimination results in the proliferation and dominance of Typha (cattails) in historic northern pike spawning marshes.  Typha is not suitable for spawning, and can also block northern pike access to areas of suitable spawning habitat. Regulation has also resulted, on average, in lower water levels during fall and winter, and in spring when northern pike spawning activity peaks. Low spring water levels decrease the amount of flooded vegetation necessary for pike spawning, which forces pike to search out dead vegetation from the previous year. Lower fall and winter water levels often result in wave and ice scouring and removal of this vegetation in shallow, marsh areas, forcing pike to spawn at greater depths (10 to 15 feet) where vegetation remains. These deeper areas warm much later, resulting in pike spawning 4 to 6 weeks later than normal. Colder water at these depths prolongs egg incubation and delays hatching, and food for newly hatched pike fry is less abundant in this colder, deeper water. These conditions have resulted in greatly diminished northern pike reproduction, resulting in fewer adult pike to sustain quality sport fisheries. NYSDEC netting surveys in the Thousand Islands region have documented a decline in northern pike populations over the past 15 years, coincident with an increase in angler complaints regarding the quality of northern pike fishing. It is hoped that this and other projects focusing on improving northern pike spawning habitat will result in improved sport fisheries. This project will be implemented collaboratively with the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, with matching dollars from the Fish Enhancement, Mitigation, and Research Fund (New York Power Authority re-licensing settlement with USFWS; ""FEMRF"" Fund).  This experimental program will be tested at NYSDEC's French Creek Wildlife Management Area, and will utilize an amphibious excavator to cut channels in Typha mats to restore fish access to isolated areas of suitable spawning habitat. This excavator is being urchased/operated through collaboration between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's FEMRF Fund. Ditching may also create areas that maintain suitable spawning vegetation, thereby roviding additional pike spawning habitat.  Pre-and post project evaluations will be conducted to determine if northern pike (and other fish species, including muskellunge, another important sportfish) successfullyspawn in these ""re-connected"" areas. The initial cost of this project is approximately $100,000, with additional matching funds from the FEMRF Fund. In the event that the project is deemed successful, consideration will be given for use of OCCNRD funds to purchase another amphibious excavator to be used exclusively on Lake Ontario/St. Lawrence River marshes, at a cost of approximately $100,000 in matching funds. Estimated cost - $200,000  17. Village of Wilson Boat Launch, Niagara Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by Gary House and the Town of Wilson). Repair/Improve existing boat launch, including replacement of temporary aluminum dock(s), replacement of damaged concrete pads and walls, improvements to gravel parking lot. Estimated cost - $30,000   18. Boat Launch at Mud Bay, Jefferson Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by Larry Rogers). To be constructed on existing state land located on Bates Road in the Town of Lyme. Due to the shallow water conditions at this site only a small boat(cartop) beach launch will be constructed. Access road and parking for 10 cars and trailers. Estimated cost - $100,000  19. Hatchery Improvements at Cape Vincent Fisheries Station (Fish Population Management/Enhancement Project proposed by the Lake Ontario Fisheries Coalition, Warren Johnson, Mitch Franz, Village of Cape Vincent). Prior to acquisition from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, the NYSDEC Cape Vincent Fisheries Station (Station) served as a federal fish hatchery. Walleye fisheries in eastern Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River have grown in popularity, resulting in increased public demand for a walleye stocking program, in addition to requests for northern pike and muskellunge stocking programs. Currently there are 13, one-acre earthen ponds that could be used for raising warm and coolwater fish (i.e. walleye, muskellunge, northern pike) for stocking into Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. It is anticipated that these stocking programs could result in measurable improvements to sportfisheries. In recent years the Village of Cape Vincent and the Lake Ontario Fisheries Coalition have provided funding, manpower, and excavation equipment to begin repairing infrastructure at the Station.  Necessary improvements to the property include new underground piping to the ponds, and the construction and outfitting (raceways, pumps, generator, etc.) of a hatchery building. The hatchery building would also likely play a role in proposal 27 (Deepwater Cisco Reintroduction in Lake Ontario, below) to rear native deepwater coregonids for reintroduction into Lake Ontario. Proposed funding for this project includes infrastructure costs ($830,000), as well as 6 years of funding for a hatchery manager (Salary Grade-15 plus fringe/indirect costs, $570,000) (total OCCNRD funds $1.4 million).  A hatchery manager position is necessary, as NYSDEC currently utilizes the Station as a base for the Research Vessel Seth Green and the Lake Ontario Fisheries Unit (i.e. there are no staff available or trained to oversee hatchery operations). Additional, potential cost sharing on this project includes NYSDEC (evaluation of stocking success and hatchery administration - $25,000 annually), the Lake Ontario Fisheries Coalition ($50,000), and the Village of Cape Vincent ($200,000 personnel/heavy equipment). Estimated cost - $1,400,000  20. OPRHP Fort Niagara Boat Launch, Niagara Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the Niagara County Fisheries Development Board). Repair/Improve existing boat launch, including replacement/repair of wooden fishing docks(s), repairs to concrete pad, placement of large stone along shore to replace existing concrete slabs. Parking lot will be resurfaced and the upstream pier will be modifed to accomodate ""universal"" access for shore and boat use. Estimated cost - $50,000  21. Slater Creek Fishing Access Site, Monroe Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by NYSDEC). This existing 80 car urban accessible fishing site is in need of repair and re-paving.Estimated cost - $75,000  22. Lake Ontario Watershed Display at the Niagara Falls Aquarium, Niagara Co. (Angler Outreach and/or Education Project proposed by the Niagara Falls Aquarium). Niagara Falls Aquarium-Lake Ontario Educational Display and Outreach (Niagara County). Located in downtown Niagara Falls, the Aquarium of Niagara Falls, New York (http://www.aquariumofniagara.org/) provided entertainment and educational programs to over 170,000 visitors in 2006 showing that this facility presents excellent outreach opportunities. Input from public meetings showed considerable interest in expanding outreach efforts for the Lake Ontario/Niagara River sportfishery and associated fish community issues.  The requested grant would be split into two phases; one that could be instituted immediately while the second, larger phase would occur in association with anticipated major building renovations (approximately 2010).  Phase I will include angler education efforts, including sportfishing and aquatic seminars and clinics, as well as renovations and repairs for an existing 10,000 gallon tank dedicated specifically to Lake Ontario fish and the development of interactive graphic displays and maps. Fish species resident to the Niagara River and Lake Ontario will be acquired for the aquarium display. Emphasis will be placed on the economic, social and ecological issues related to the sportfishery and how invasive species, industrial development and water quality can influence these trends. Historic changes in the recreational and commercial fisheries will also be included. Phase II will include the construction of a Lake Ontario sportfishing section associated with the expansion of the existing aquarium facility with the transfer of phase I displays into a section of the aquarium specifically dedicated to the aforementioned issues. Estimated cost - $300,000 (phase I & II)  23. Repair Cranberry Creek Marsh Water Control Structure (Habitat Restoration Project proposed by Dr. John Farrell, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Thomas Jolliff). Water level regulation on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River has resulted in a compression of annual and long-term water level fluctuation, effectively eliminating extreme high and low water levels. These extremes are important in maintaining wetland plan diversity, and their elimination results in the proliferation and dominance of Typha (cattails) in historic northern pike spawning marshes. Typha is not suitable for spawning, and can also block northern pike access to areas of suitable spawning habitat. Regulation has also resulted, on average, in lower water levels during fall and winter, and in spring when northern pike spawning activity peaks. Low spring water levels decrease the amount of flooded vegetation necessary for pike spawning, which forces pike to search out dead vegetation from the previous year. Lower fall and winter water levels often result in wave and ice scouring and removal of this vegetation in shallow, marsh areas, forcing pike to spawn at greater depths (10 to 15 feet) where vegetation remains.  These deeper areas warm much later, resulting in pike spawning 4 to 6 weeks later than normal. Colder water at these depths prolongs egg incubation and delays hatching, and food for newly hatched pike fry is less abundant in this colder, deeper water. These conditions have resulted in greatly diminished northern pike reproduction, resulting in fewer adult pike to sustain quality sporfisheries. NYSDEC netting surveys in the Thousand Islands region have documented a decline in northern pike populations over the past 15 years, coincident with an increase angler complaints regarding the quality of northern pike fishing. It is hoped that this and other projects focusing on improving northern pike spawning habitat will result in improved sportfisheries for northern pike.  A water control structure was included in the NYS Department of Transportation's (DOT) construction of the Route 12 bridge over Cranberry Creek (tributary to the St. Lawrence River east of Alexandria Bay). This structure allows water levels in the marsh to be managed independently from the St. Lawrence River, providing the opportunity to restore a more natural water level regime. Water levels in Cranberry Creek Marsh have been periodically regulated by the Bureau of Fisheries to enhance northern pike spawning habitat, however, this required collecting pike below the structure and manually transferring fish above the structure, and in recent years wooden stop-logs have broken, resulting in an inability to control water levels in the marsh. Repair of the structure will include dredging of sediments immediately upstream, replacement of existing wooden stop-logs with aluminum, and the installation of a fish ladder to allow passage for spawning pike upstream and into the marsh. There is a potential for cost sharing with DOT (manpower and equipment), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Fish Enhancement, Mitigation and Research Fund. Estimated cost - $50,000  24. Upgrade Hatchery Pond Complex at Lisbon, NY (also known as ""Ogdensburg Hatchery"" - Fish Population Management/Enhancement, proposed by St. Lawrence alley Sportsman's Club, St. Lawrence County Fisheries Advisory Board, John Gardver, Richard Hollis, Larry Vielhauer) -- Construction and operation of the New York Power Authority's F.D.R. Power Project in Massena, New York, resulted in the loss of historic walleye spawning areas, and walleye populations in the Ogdensburg to Massena area declined. NYSDEC formerly operated a smallmouth bass hatchery at Lisbon (near Ogdensburg), which is now owned by the NYS Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Since the mid-1980s, the St. Lawrence Valley Sportsman's Club has made improvements to the property and reared walleye fry and fingerlings for stocking into the St. Lawrence River. This project entails the construction and clay-lining of two additional 1 acre ponds to increase existing walleye production. It is anticipated that increased walleye stocking from these repaired ponds will result in increased walleye fishing quality in the local waters of the St. Lawrence River. Matching funds for this program are provided by in kind services of the St. Lawrence Valley Sportsman's Club. Estimated cost - $100,000  25. Irondequoit Creek Streambank Stabilization, Monroe Co. (Habitat Restoration Project proposed by Monroe County and NYSDEC). Irondequoit Creek supports a locally important trout and salmon fishery with lake-run fish from Lake Ontario (primarily brown, steelhead and Chinook slamon). In addition, trout are raised at the Powder Mills Park Hatchery for stocking into the creek. Irondequiot Creek generated over 6,000 and 9,000 angler trips in 2005/06 and 2006/07, respectively. Storm flow events in the creek have caused significant stream bank erosion, resulting in siltation of the streambed, loss of trout habitat, and impaired angler access to the creek. Silt reduction will improve the chances for natural reproduction of lake run trout and salmon, and the placement of large rock along the stream bank will improve habitat for juvenile and adult fish. This project proposes regrading eroded banks at five sites within Powder Mills Park, regrading banks to a 1:2 slope, and the placement of medium/heavy stone over geo-textile fabric The first year cost estimate for work in Monroe County's Powder Mill Park is $82,500. Future phases would include further work in Powder Mill Park with an estimated cost of $89,500 and bank stabilization work in the County's Ellison Park with an estimated cost of $78,500 bringing the total projected cost to $250,500 Estimated cost - $250,500  26. Deepwater Cisco Reintroduction in Lake Ontario (Fish Population Management/Enhancement Project proposed by the U.S. Geological Survey, Robert O'Gorman). Lake Ontario's popular trout and salmon fisheries rely on massive quantities of bait fish, or ""forage"". The deepwater zone of Lake Ontario was historically inhabited by five species of deepwater ciscoes (coregonids -- members of the whitefish family) that served as forage. Ciscoes were largely extinct in the Lake by the 1950s, and the current forage base is now dominated by exotic alewife, and to a lesser extent rainbow smelt. Alewife populations are subject to large oscillations in abundance, thus trout and salmon fisheries that rely largely on alewife forage can be tenuous. Reintroduction of deepwater ciscoes into Lake Ontario would diversify the forage base, providing more stability in the food web and sportfisheries. This program entails collection of fertilized eggs from Upper Great Lakes deepwater ciscoes, and transferal to and rearing at a hatchery facility for stocking into Lake Ontario. Currently there is no capacity in existing NYSDEC or federal hatcheries to rear deepwater ciscoes. It is likely that fertilized eggs would need to be collected from the Upper Great Lakes each year for a period of 5 to 10 years. The successful implementation of this project would be contingent upon the capital improvements FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System Page 21 and the hiring of a hatchery manager at the Cape Vincent Fisheries Station that are proposed under project 20 (""Hatchery Improvements at Cape Vincent Fisheries Station"" above). Ciscoes spawn in winter and therefore would not interfere with the coolwater fish production at the facility proposed under project 20. Funding would be used to cover the costs of collecting and transporting fertilized cisco eggs from the Upper Great Lakes to the Cape Vincent Fishery Station. Potential sources of matching funds for this program include the Great Lakes Fishery Commission and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. Estimated Cost - $50,000  27. Public Access Improvements, Village of Morristown, St. Lawrence Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by Ron Wright, Morristown Chamber of Commerce). During fall/low water conditions, the existing public boat launch in the Village of Morristown (St. Lawrence River in St. Lawrence County) is currently too short to launch boats safely. Extending the exisiting launch ramp will greatly improve angler access to the St. Lawrence River during low water periods. Also, docking at the boat launch is currently inadequate to protect docked boats from damage, requiring installation of staving. While public access signage exists along state route 37 at the west entrance to the village, signage is required at the east entrance to the village. Estimated Cost - $50,000  28. Sodus Bay boat launch, Wayne Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by Fredric Blom). While there is an approximate 40 car-trailer Town launch at Sodus Bay, a second ramp would alleviate congestion during certain time periods. Currently, there is no State-owned land that would be suitable to build a launch, and acquiring property there is likely to be costly. Estimated Cost - $500,000 (construction cost only, implementation of this project depends on the funding of land acquisition through the Environmental Protection Fund)  29. Pen Rearing Program Assistance (Fish Population Management/Enhancement Project proposed by Michelle Osman and the Niagara County Fisheries Development Board). Salmonid pen rearing projects currently exist at nine locations along Lake Ontario and the Lower Niagara River. All projects have been funded and operated by volunteer angler organizations with fish and technical support provided by NYSDEC-Bureau of Fisheries. Pre-smolt Chinook salmon and steelhead trout from NYSDEC Salmon River Hatchery are stocked into the pens where they are held and fed a regimented diet until smolting occurs or conditions at the pen locations necessitate their release. The intent of the pen programs is to imprint the smolts to these rearing locations, thereby increasing the number that return to these sites as adults. Evaluations of adult returns of Chinook salmon indicated enhanced survival under some rearing conditions FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System Page 22 while the single evaluation of steelhead pen rearing (Oswego River) showed a seven-fold increase in survival of pen-reared fish The following materials/activities are beneficial to the rearing process and occasionally need repairs or replacement: frames, netting, floatation, pumps and piping for water circulation, scap nets, net brushes, weigh scales, signs, promotional materials, supplemental piping for stocking to pens, power washers, miscellaneous supplies, pen towing services, water quality monitoring equipment, rental fees for equipment space. Estimated Cost - $20,000  30. Salmon River Hatchery Aquaria/ Interpretive Displays, Oswego Co. (Angler Outreach and/or Education project proposed by NYSDEC). The Salmon River Hatchery continues to be the focal point of the Lake Ontario fishery and the Salmon River Corridor, as well as being the largest hatchery in the NYS Hatchery System. The Salmon River Hatchery produces the majority of all the salmonids stocked into New York's Great Lakes waters. Each year 100,000 plus visitors come to the hatchery. At least 70% of those visitors are anglers. The remaining visitors consist of people who may not fish but have a great interest in the Lake Ontario ecosystem, the Salmon River Corridor, or want to be informed about fish culture and the hatchery system. During the fall egg take for Pacific salmon on weekdays the hatchery averages at least 500 school children visiting the hatchery which gives tremendous opportunity to promote sportfishing and stewardship of the resource. The guest registries signed at the hatchery show that visitations include out of state and international visitors. The facility is also host to many meetings, seminars, lectures, and workshops relating to fishing each year. Youth fishing programs are ongoing at the hatchery. Science and environmental clubs along with University and college level students schedule in depth tours routinely. Each year the hatchery hosts an open house in celebration of National Hunting & Fishing Day, a Congressionally recognized event on the fourth Saturday of September each year, that attracts up to three thousand people in one day. The event is specifically designed to get youth and families involved with hands on experiences of fishing and fish culture. There is probably no other facility along Lake Ontario that reaches as many people and has the capacity to educate the public regarding sport fishing in the Great Lakes. This project would renovate the existing displays at the Salmon River Hatchery and would include: a new aquaria system in the lobby, new interpretive displays, the placement of an underwater camera to view migrating and spawning salmonids, and the development of a trail along Beaver Dam Brook. The design and construction of a living stream aquaria system for the lobby of the hatchery would highlight the species raised at the hatchery and represent the Salmon River Watershed from the headwaters to where it enters Lake Ontario. The present aquaria system was built in 1980 no longer properly functions. Present aquaria need to be replaced and a better and simpler plumbing system installed. The new aquarium display would be a large self contained system that would replace the existing 5 aquarias (totaling 2,000 gallons). The new system would be designed at waist level for viewing into the aquariums and would spatially open up the lobby . While significant investment has been made in upgrading static style displays throughout the hatchery in the last 10 years,educational opportunities would increase with the design and construction of interactive displays placed appropriately in the lobby and viewing areas of the start tank room and spawn house. Strategically located interactive displays describing hatchery functions would include computer and touch screen displays that would simulate daily fish culture activities at the hatchery, fish life stages at the hatchery and in the wild, fisheries management objectives such as determining stocking levels, forage base availability, the role of natural reproduction, sea lamprey control, the impact of exotic species and fish diseases as it relates to the Lake Ontario System and the role the Salmon River plays in the overall Lake Ontario fishery. The present design of the fish ladder allows only for limited fish viewing. Small children cannot see anything in the ladder because the existing wall and fence are too high. They climb on the wall and fence to see into the ladder which creates a personal injury hazard. This part of the project offers a better way for everyone to see migrating fish in the ladder. A portable underwater camera and monitor has been used previously to demonstrate the effectiveness of showing fish this way with great popularity. The placement of a permanent underwater camera in the fish ladder with two monitor viewing stations would enable the public to see migrating fish and enhance their hatchery visitation experience Presently visitors reach the viewing deck at the end of the ladder where it meets Beaver Dam Brook and then leave the deck and try to walk upstream along the edge of the stream to view naturally spawning salmon and trout. This has caused erosion problems due to the large number of hatchery visitors looking to observe spawning trout and salmon. The erosion problems create a safety hazard due to the slippery conditions on the bank. A trail system as described below would provide a safe venue for observations and facilitate staff giving tours to groups visiting the hatchery with a minimization of the erosion and safety concerns that arise from high traffic areas. Project can be cost shared with money from the Salmon River Fund. Estimated Cost - $100,000  31. Walleye Spawning Habitat Enhancement Fund (Habitat Restoration Projects proposed by Mike Seymour, John Gardner, Mitch Franz, Lake Ontario Fisheries Coalition, Warren Johnson, NYSDEC). Walleye are an increasingly popular sportfish that spawn primarily over clean rubble/cobble/gravel in fast moving water. Construction and operation of the New York Power Authority's F.D.R. Power Project in Massena, New York, resulted in the loss of historic walleye spawning areas along the St. Lawrence River, and walleye populations in the Ogdensburg to Massena area declined. Walleye spawning habitats in Lake Ontario tributaries have also been impaired by dam construction, as well as sediment impaction or the FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System Page 24 removal of rock substrates. A number of tributaries have been suggested as candidates for walleye spawning habitat enhancement, including the Oswego River, Little Sandy Creek, Stoney Creek, Mill Creek, Black River, Fox Creek, Mud Creek, Barrett's Creek, Oswegatchie River, Tibbett's Creek, and Little Sucker Brook. Walleye spawning habitat enhancement through the placement of washed stone in suitable, fast water sites is generally very successful, provided that an existing population of spawners is present. Prior to approval for funding, Regional DEC Fisheries staff will assess candidate waters to determine presence of spawning walleye, adequacy of existing habitat, and current level of reproductive success. It is anticipated that increased natural reproduction of walleye will result in increased walleye fishing quality in the local waters of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. Matching funds for this program on St. Lawrence River tributaries may be available through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Fish Enhancement, Mitigation and Research Fund. Estimated Cost - $200,000.  32. OPRHP Four Mile Creek State Park, Niagara Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the NYS OPRHP). This project invloves the construction of a new fishing access site with a gravel parking lot, as well as signage and a trail system along the creek at Four Mile Creek State Park. Estimated Cost - $75,000  33. Multifrequency Acoustic Analysis for Estimating Alewife Abundance in Lake Ontario. (Fish Population Management/Enhancement Project proposed by Lars Rudstam- Cornell University). Alewife is a critical link in the off-shore food web of Lake Ontario, providing the most important food source for all major predators such as Chinook and coho salmon, lake, brown, and rainbow trout. Balancing the predator/prey ratio in Lake Ontario is one of the most critical components to sustain a very successful sport fishery. Acoustics uses sophisticated sonar signals to measure abundance of fish species in the open lake, and has been used for many years to estimate alewife abundance in Lake Ontario and the other four Great Lakes. Unfortunately, Lake Ontario is more complicated than the other lakes because of the larger mix of forage species and the larger contribution from mysids (freshwater shrimp). The most common Great Lakes acoustic frequency (120 kHz) proves satisfactory at assessing forage fish size targets when there is a significant difference in size of the various species present. This project will enhance forage fish assessment by purchasing a 38kHz acoustic unit which would be used in conjunction with other sonar frequencies to help separate the various small forage fish species and mysids in Lake Ontario. The project would also cover cost of acoustic data analysis and developing a standard methodology. The project would be cost shared by Cornell University where several FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System Page 25 acoustic units and analytical software are in use.. Estimated Cost- $55,000  34. Olcott Pier Access Improvement, Niagara Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the Niagara County Fisheries Development Board). Improve trail access including resurfacing of trail (blacktop and gravel), fencing, safety rails, lighting and signage. Estimated Cost - $100,000  35. Improvements to Cape Vincent Aquaria/Interpretive Displays, Jefferson Co. (Angler Outreach and/or Education project proposed by NYSDEC). NYSDEC operates an aquarium/visitors center at its' Cape Vincent Fisheries Station, and up to 5,000 individuals visit the facility each year. The aquarium hosts a number of warmwater and coolwater sportfish native to local waters, along with displays produced on-site that describe issues relating to Lake Ontario/St. Lawrence River fisheries management. In addition, youth angler education programs are linked with visits by school groups, cub scouts, girls scouts, etc.. Funds will be used to fabricate interpretive displays to educate the public on the fisheries and ecology of the Lake Ontario/St. Lawrence River system, and to improve aquarium displays of local warmwater/coolwater fish species. This project will leave visitors with a greater understanding of and appreciation for NYSDEC's Lake Ontario/St. Lawrence River fisheries. Estimated Cost - $40,000  36. Additional ice-fishing access on Sodus and Blind Sodus Bays, Wayne Co. (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by Bob and Kathi O'Gorman). Ice fishing is very popular on these two bays. The Sodus Bay site only has capacity for eight cars. Available land may be the limiting factor in achieving this goal. An estimated cost of $25,000 per site for a total of $50,000 excluding acquisition costs. Estimated Cost - $50,000  37. Locate Areas Where Lake Trout Spawn in the Lower Niagara River (Fish Population Management/Enhancement Project, proposed by Robert O'Gorman Supervisor of the U.S. Geological Survey - Lake Ontario Biological Station, Oswego, NY). Captures of naturally produced juvenile lake trout are greatest in the vicinity of the Niagara River and large numbers of mature lake trout are known to run the lower river in fall. This suggests that natural reproduction is taking place in the mouth and upstream in the lower Niagara River. To locate the areas where lake trout are spawning successfully, we suggest funding a telemetry study of lake FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System Page 26 trout in the lower Niagara River. Mature lake trout congregate in the lower river prior to spawning and could be easily captured by angling for implantation of telemetry tags. Identifying limited areas where lake trout are successfully spawning would insure that this critical habitat is protected and enable us to study the strain composition and behavior of the apparently successful spawning population. This project will fund the purchase of telemetry tags and tracking equipment and partnering with scientists from USGS, OMNR, and USFWS or universities to conduct the study. This work would support efforts of the Lake's managing agencies to re-establish a self-sustaining lake trout population. Estimated Cost - $50,000  38. Port Bay (North/Wayne Co.) (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by Bob and Kathi O'Gorman). The area just west of the inlet is a very popular fishing access site which includes a launch. During periods of inclement weather, especially during the winter, access to the site becomes restricted. This project suggests improvements to the access road to allow for year round access, and is currently being evaluated to see if it would be possible. Estimated Cost - $500,000  39. Sea Lamprey Control Barrier Fund (Fish Population Management/Enhancement Project proposed by NYSDEC). Sea lampreys are a parasitic fish that attaches to other fish (host) and feeds off of the host's body fluids, often resulting in the death of the host fish. Historically, sea lampreys contributed to the decline of important sportfish, including lake trout. An intensive, binational sea lamprey control program was launched with the creation of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC) in 1956. The GLFC uses an integrated pest management approach to controlling sea lampreys, including chemical treatments in spawning/nursery tributaries, a sterile male release program, and low-head barrier dams to block lamprey spawning migrations on known spawning tributatries that are difficult or prohibitively costly to treat with chemicals. Surveys on Lake Ontario tributaries have recently discovered new spawning populations of sea lampreys, and all indices of sea lamprey attacks on sportfish (primarily trout and salmon in Lake Ontario) indicate that sea lamprey abundance and attacks are increasing. Failure to control sea lamprey populations in this system will result in reduced sportfishng quality. This fund would serve as a match with those from the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to construct low-head barriers when deemed necessary on Lake Ontario tributaries. Estimated Cost - $60,000  40. Experimental Techniques to Enhance Submergent Vegetation Growth and Efficacy of Artificial Spawning Habitat (Habitat Restoration/Enhancement Project proposed by Dr. John Farrell, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry). Water level regulation on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River has resulted in a compression of annual and long-term water level fluctuation, effectively eliminating extreme high and low water levels. These extremes are important in maintaining wetland plan diversity, and their elimination results in the proliferation and dominance of Typha (cattails) in historic northern pike spawning marshes. Typha is not suitable for spawning, and can also block northern pike access to areas of suitable spawning habitat. Regulation has also resulted, on average, in lower water levels during fall and winter, and in spring when northern pike spawning activity peaks. Low spring water levels decrease the amount of flooded vegetation necessary for pike spawning, which forces pike to search out dead vegetation from the previous year. Lower fall and winter water levels often result in wave and ice scouring and removal of this vegetation in shallow, marsh areas, forcing pike to spawn at greater depths (10-15 feet) where vegetation remains. These deeper areas warm much later, resulting in pike spawning 4 to 6 weeks later than normal. Colder water at these depths prolongs egg incubation and delays hatching, and food for newly hatched pike fry is less abundant in this colder, deeper water. These conditions have resulted in greatly diminished northern pike reproduction, resulting in fewer adult pike to sustain quality sporfisheries. NYSDEC netting surveys in the Thousand Islands region have documented a decline in northern pike populations over the past 15 years, coincident with an increase in angler complaints regarding the quality of northern pike fishing. It is hoped that this and other projects focusing on improving northern pike spawning habitat will result in improved sportfisheries for northern pike. This collaborative project (matching dollars with New York Power Authority Fish Enhancement, Mitigation and Research Fund (FEMRF) focuses in two approaches to increasing northern pike spawning success. The first approach involves enhancing growth of vegetation through the placement of structures designed to reduce wave energy (i.e. breakwaters), which may also include transplantation or seeding of desired vegetation into a study site. The second approach involves placement of synthetic spawning substrates (i.e. similar to artificial turf) in shallow marsh habitats with little or no existing vegetation. In both cases, northern pike spawning activity will be monitored, and numbers of young northern pike produced will be quantified. The total estimated cost for this project is approximately $100,000, with $45,000 coming from the OCC NRD Fund. Estimated Cost - $45,000  41. Reconfigure the Waterport Dam tail races on the Oak Orchard River, Orleans Co. (Habitat Restoration Project proposed by Ron Bierstine). Oak Orchard is the third most fished Tributary to Lake Ontario. Every year fish are lost to the fishery due to stranding in the overflow channel of the unregulated dam at Waterport after high water FINAL Sportfishery Restoration & Spending Plan for the Lake Ontario System Page 28 events. During high water, fish enter the overflow channel only to become stranded and exposed to unethical fishing, high temperatures and low dissolved oxygen levels. In 2006, an estimated 300 Chinook were trapped and died in the channel after the water level dropped. Brookfield Power, the owners of the dam, met with Department staff to discuss the issue. Brookfield Power hired a consultant to examine various options to exclude fish from entering the overflow channel during high water events. Completion of this project will make additional adult Chinook salmon available for anglers by eliminating the mortality that occurs following high water events. In addition, the project will eliminate a significant public concern over large numbers of dead fish creating an aesthetic andpublic relations issue. Estimated Cost - $50,000  42. Construct walkways on any existing piers or breakwalls (Public Fishing Access Project proposed by the Eastern Lake Ontario Salmon and Trout Association). The project would improve and/or provide fishing access to existing piers or breakwalls, as well as provide parking for these facilities. This establishes a fund to be used for these types of projects across the Lake Ontario system. As projects are identified for implementation, detailed spending plans will be developed as needed. Estimated Cost - $500,000"
