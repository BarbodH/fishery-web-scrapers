South Simcoe Police were called to Big Bay Point in Innisfil at about 12:30 p.m. to help a man who broke through thin ice while operating his snowmobile.  Fortunately, the 40-year-old Sharon man was able to swim to firmer ice and pull himself out of the water and roll to safety.  He then walked to a nearby cottage for assistance.  He was wet and cold when police arrived but did not require medical attention.  Police are issuing a warning to all persons including ice fisherman, to stay off the ice on Lake Simcoe since it is still unsafe."
