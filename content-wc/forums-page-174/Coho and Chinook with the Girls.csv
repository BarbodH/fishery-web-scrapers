Does it get any better than this? Cali and Sierra are both starting to enjoy trying to reel in their own fish. Cali beats me to the rod on a release off the down rigger this day and both times she was reeling in fish they ended up being our only two Chinook hooked up. She's got the lucky touch. Unfortunately I lost one by the boat and had to rescue Cali from the 20 pound salmon as it was doing a number on her knuckles. This is the mayhem on board our boat.... Fishing Doc with my three lovely girls. Up in Port Hardy fishing with Gibbs Delta flashers and spoons. Usually I do pretty well with green and white spoons with some of Mikes herring or anchovy scent stripe on the back of the spoon. We were fishing on the downriggers at about 30 to 50 feet down in 60 to 120 feet of water. Trolling speed about 2 to 2.8 mph. Hope you enjoy. I see more and more guys from Alberta out there. Must be all of Serengetti's amazing pics. Only thing is they don't fish within range of most Alberta style boats. But there is still great fishing within 5 to 10 miles.
