I understand that Brace is connected to Meta and Ara which offer different water. Anyone have experience with Brace in that time period? Looking at Walleyes primarily. Also wondering when the best times are for the jumbo Perch. Any info will be appreciated. Made a huge error this last year, I don't want a repeat. Worst Canadian trip ever this year. I have searched the forum for info but for this time period, info is sparse."
