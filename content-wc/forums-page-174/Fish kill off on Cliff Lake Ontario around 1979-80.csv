5833001,Skywagon,2017-10-29 05:44:00,1106,"The mercury problem from the Dryden wood mill that flowed out of the Wabigoon system into Clay lake is still there. There are local news blurps on a somewhat regular basis about the mercury problem and demands from the natives to clean it up, because of the health issues it has caused the Grassy Narrows Band. The Government does studies on the problem, but mercury is something that just does not go away, cleaning up the whole system could really never realistically happen, about the only thing they do is recommend not eating the fish."

5830513,Poochie,2017-10-26 12:38:00,8,"Woman overheard my story about getting skunked on Cliff Lake at a Milwaukee outdoor fishing show and said there was a chemical spill on the lake around 1979 and a fish die off. I believe it, fished all my life and hit that lake hard for 3 days solid without even a trace of a fish. Not even a ripple in the water at sunrise anywhere on the lake. The lake seemed barren. It WAS barren.But it is a huge lake and what would a chemical spill be? A truck going through the ice? I even contacted Canadian Wildlife and they said their 1983 or so muskie records seemed normal but a lake could recover in a few years , right?****est thing to this day."
5830585,Obabikon,2017-10-26 14:41:00,2370,"First... no, a lake could not recover in a few years. Especially the musky fishing. It would take 15 at least. Secondly... if there was a spill that some random lady knew about, it would be documented. I tried to do some research on it, and this is the type of information you should be able to find (and quickly). Zip. There's a chance during that time period acid rain affected it, or there's also a chance you just hit a crappy 3 days. Cliff has fished very well for muskies... especially numbers for many years."
5830785,BornToFish,2017-10-26 19:47:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been fishing in the vicinity of Cliff Lake for about sixteen years. The story of a chemical spill and subsequent die-off of fish is absolutely new to me. If there was such a fish die-off, I'm sure that one of my many friends from the area would have mentioned it along the way. I would be very suspicious of such a story.I know several anglers that fish Cliff Lake on a fairly regular basis. These anglers gave me the impression of it being a difficult lake for new-comers to do very well on - sort of a feast or famine type of lake. I think these anglers paid their dues and now are enjoying the fruits of their investments. They very much enjoy their time spent on the lake.I do recall there was another lake in the vicinity of Vermillion Bay that had a chemical exposure decades ago. I believe there was (and maybe still is?) an advisory about consuming fish from that lake. This might be the situation that your contact was alluding to.Kindest regards...."
5830793,Remi,2017-10-26 19:52:00,41,"We fished Cliff Lake for walleyes, the first week of August in 2016. 20 trips to Canada, first time fishing Cliff. Fishing it was very different, in techniques, a guide on second day really helped us learn. Not enough action for my kids, but they loved swimming there. I did catch my biggest walleye ever at 27 inches. Musky guys in camp all seemed to get some action for the week, but all of them had years of experience. I've never tried musky."
5831873,Aspencreek,2017-10-27 20:09:00,2911,Am I imagining things or wasn't there a VERY regular member on this site several years ago who ran a camp on Cliff for a year? Seems she and her husband ran the camp then had it taken back by the previous owner......never have heard a word of a spill like that.
5832025,Bill Krejca,2017-10-28 05:54:00,6107,"A very nice lady, and a partner, as I remember, ran a camp there, but had some type of disagreement,and closed it down. I remember chatting with her at a sports show somewhere. She was an outdoors woman, even shared on WC some of the fishing she experienced. Last I heard, she moved out west? somewhere, and started a new life for herself. Wish I could remember her name, very pleasant to communicate with. Bill"
5832097,Obabikon,2017-10-28 07:30:00,2370,Rose and John stepped aside. Their partner and his family now run it.
5832137,Limeyangler,2017-10-28 08:25:00,563,"Cliff Lake is difficult if you don't know it, but like BTF mentions, those anglers that do know it do very well. Also like BTF mentions above , the chemical spill is probably Clay Lake....not Cliff Lake."
5832473,Poochie,2017-10-28 16:03:00,8,"I think you might be right about Clay Lake. We drove up from Dryden to Clay Lake...little did we know that the Wabigoon River flows into Clay Lake...it was very murky and I voiced my concern to the proprietor about the pulp mill in Dryden and probable pollution in Clay Lake coming from the river. We fished a couple of hours on Clay but decided to leave that same day. So we headed further up north and thats when we hit Cliff Lake. When we got there, there were no other people staying at the lodge on Cliff and in fact, we saw no other people at all. Well, like I mention in the original post, nada, nothing, no signs of fish. I fished deep for lake trout, shallow for walleye, everywhere for northern. Didn't even get a followup or anything. The following year, the lady at the sports show overheard me and mentioned the chemical spill. I am thinking they meant Clay Lake and not Cliff Lake since I was talking about both. Anyway, I want to come back to the area (away from f****** Dryden) in 2018 so does anyone have a recommendation for a decent lake in the area? I am not sure I want to try Cliff Lake again with my experience from 1980."
