Be sure to check the weather and wind forecast before heading all the way to Grassy and the entrance to the Seine River. If the wind is kicking up it can be a long ride back to the Swell Bay entrance. Red Gut and Swell have some musky as well. I've never fished for them on Rainy so I can't help with locations, but there are lots of reefs, rip rap and weeds linked to reefs to try. We've caught some big pike on Rainy. Personally I like Taylors Cove over Coppens. Taylors is located right across the Bear Passage from Coppens. If there are any other questions you might have I'd be happy to answer what I can."
