It's the time of the year when I reflect back over the past fishing season and think about things that went well and maybe not so well. One of the things that I have been thinking about pertains to my use of bottom bouncers. Bottom bouncing was a featured element of my walleye game for many years. Spinner rigs behind bottom bouncers were, and still are, fish catching machines.However, bottom bouncing slowly fell by the wayside for me. I use to fish a lake where I found that I didn't need to use bottom bouncers to catch fish. I found that walleyes in that lake mostly related to off-shore structure much of the open water season. I had enough waypoints that I normally could go to my ""spots on the spot"" and catch fish jigging. There simply was no need to use bottom bouncers. Why cover water when I often knew where the walleyes were?I switched lakes this year. I found that I was somewhat ""starting over"" in terms of learning the lake and the habits of its walleyes. I quickly learned that a fair number of walleyes in this particular lake relate to shorelines and weed-lines throughout much of the open water season. Additionally, I was learning new pieces of off-shore structure (e.g. rock humps). I found that I was wondering ""where are the walleyes today?"" and ""how can I find them faster?"". I realized that I needed to cover water to locate fish.I dusted off the bottom bouncers this spring and put them to use throughout the season. In contrast to previous experiences with bottom bouncers, I was not relying on them to catch fish. I used spinner rigs behind bottom bouncers as a search tool to show me the location of walleyes. Once found, I put the bottom bouncers away and relied upon other techniques to stay on top off the fish and work them over. For example, I back-trolled spinner rigs behind bottom bouncers along a very long stretch of wind-blown shorelines to locate a school of active walleyes. I then anchored near this school of fish in order to pitch jigs and cast crank baits.I primarily used bottom bouncers (often with spinner rigs) in the past as a means to catch fish. Now, I find that I am using bottom bouncers as a tool to locate fish. Once located, I use other means to catch fish.Using bottom bouncers primarily as a search tool is new for me. How do you use bottom bouncers?Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Trolling weed shoreline, large rock point, or sand, even mid lake structure large enough to troll. Typically in a week we are 75% jigging, 25% bottom bounce trolling. My personal experience is larger average size on trolling bottom bounce with spinner rigs with crawlers. What depth we catch in bottom bounce, then jig fish spots we start at same depth. Years ago did more trolling with 2 people in the boat. Now our Canada trip has me, wife, kids all fishing together, makes trolling more difficult with 4 people. This year we went to Eagle Lake, our first time ever fishing it. Very different pulling up from 70 feet to reef in 24 feet. Tried trolling it didn't work, maybe we gave up too early on spinner rigs. Ended up jig and minnows the rest of the week, jig and moving around a reef, then buzz over to the next reef. Fun, but I missed trolling bottom bouncing, but always try, learn and adjust each day."

5839226,MN_Moose,2017-11-02 05:54:00,964,I use bottom bouncers for drifting macs smile blades. Pretty much live bait rigging. Occasionally use slow death crawler. Heavier weight of bottom bouncer keeps bait in the zone in those rocky Canadian waters. I learned a lot reading Phil Rolfe posts. I think they all disappeared now.
