It's a short drive from Eastern PA for me and is a cheap/easy way to get a ""fix"". It's got classic shield scenery with rock walls, islands, bays, etc. There is endless structure to fish, or endless weedbeds to explore. Walleye fishing is tough, but they are in there. Pike are small compared to Ontario, but the bass fishing is excellent. Plus, good crappie and perch. Here is a video I took while fishing for smallies this past weekend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok-f5El1jUQ&t=2s"

Didn't have many walleye back than,in the 1990's, but they had a stocking program going on. But I heard they are coming back. Good for small and large mouth bass, perch, etc."
