This was filmed the last day of our week long trip, so we had the benefit of 2 guide trips and learning spots all week. This was our first time fishing Eagle Lake, very fun and very different from the small, stained walleye lakes we normally fish.https://youtu.be/UZTeP_PuWjY 12 walleyes and 1 crawfish in 15 minutes. Raw Uncut Boat Footage from our trip Cedar Point Lodge fishing mid-day on 8/4/2017. From the Camp, the Fishing here was a good 30+ minute boat ride to the Nash Bay area of Eagle Lake, we enjoyed the boat rides and the fishing."
