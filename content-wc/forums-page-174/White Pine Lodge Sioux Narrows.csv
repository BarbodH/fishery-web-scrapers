5842266,Lazy Fisherman,2017-11-03 14:27:00,276,"I think White Pine Lodge is south of Sioux Narrows about 6 or 7 miles. White Birch is the resort in town, which is closed."
5842962,Thompmd,2017-11-04 05:52:00,320,"Thanks Guys,I just verified but the one I was looking for is White Pine.We are looking for a nice housekeeping place that can be on the mainland or an island a few miles out. My wife likes to get out and shop/eat 1-2x a week so we would likely go to Sioux Narrows or Kenora."
5843274,camp chef,2017-11-04 08:22:00,915,"Look at Big North Lodge on the Winnipeg River. It is about 30 minutes north of Kenora, Very nice place ,people and water. We are returning this coming spring after fishing elsewhere for 5 years."
5846530,LOW1,2017-11-06 09:34:00,2828,I think that either Tomahawk or Crawfords would work nicely for you.
5846930,Thompmd,2017-11-06 12:32:00,320,What about Indianhead Lodge?
5852210,srk-low,2017-11-10 06:00:00,78,Unfortunately White Pine was foreclosed on last month. In addition Red Indian has closed. Over the last ten to fifteen years I have observed the decline in vacationers in the Sioux Narrows area. The only bright side is the remaining lodges should see some increase in business.
5852242,Thompmd,2017-11-10 06:09:00,320,"Thanks for the update, I booked at Indianhead for a week in the middle of June. Our first trip to Sioux Narrows."
