5848402,Fishingframes,2017-11-07 12:20:00,5,You gave me an idea to dress one up for Halloween next year lol. I fish many of tribs in southern Ontario - north shores of Lake Ontario and south shores of Georgian Bay. I won't be too specific with names - but 90pct of the tribs hold decent populations of fish this time of year.

Lake O fish are huge, but I find the Huron fish are scrappier. I'd love to fish a Superior Steelhead. Maybe when I'm retired and the arthritis isn't so bad - I'll get that motivation or the lotto. Which ever comes first. Lol. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
