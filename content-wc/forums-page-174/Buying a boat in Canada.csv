5858586,1simplemann,2017-11-15 06:22:00,88,I'm looking for a used boat. I have found several that I'm interested in. One is in Canada. Is there anything that need to be aware of? I am concerned there will be hidden fees when I cross the border when I cross back into the states. Customs issues?
5859154,Pooch,2017-11-15 11:40:00,4618,Contact customs yourself before buying. That way you'll know for sure what you're getting involved in. You'll probably come home with no plates so that could be an issue. Title transfer? Don't know. Ask the folks who do know.Here in Illinois if you buy something used you have to pay a sales tax on it before it can be licensed or permitted. Includes boats. Buying a boat from out of state this past summer was just short of a hassle getting it registered in Illinois. Ended up driving to the state capital and home of the DNR to get it registered. PITA but was easier than trying to do it online or through an unhelpful Illinois dealer. (I don't blame them!)Pooch
5859634,btyreprich,2017-11-15 15:54:00,1067,"I’m saving up to buy a boat in Canada. The dealer in Ontario I spoke to says he sells quite a few boats to people in the US due to the favorable exchange rates. As past of their service, the dealer takes the boat through customs and then hooks up the boat to the customers car once they are both in the US. Dealer needs to have all paperwork stamped properly as I don’t believe much of any tax is charged on boats leaving their country.Now in IL, the lady at the local Secretary of State office suggested its in my best interest to show up,with the title and purchase receipt - just on the trailer - to make sure I pay the fair amount on the trailer. She says she does not care about the boat or motor -just the trailer.I’m not suggesting the Canadian dealer write up a bunch of phony purchase receipts to avoid taxes. I will insist that the purchase of the boat and trailer be on two separate receipts.Just my thoughts on this process.If I’m mistaken, please correct me guys."

5859906,btyreprich,2017-11-16 03:46:00,1067,"Looking at a Canadian made boat - one of those all welded hull types popular in the Pacific Northwest. With the favorable exchange rate and little to no tax, I'm thinking that buying in Canada makes sense."
5860018,1simplemann,2017-11-16 06:55:00,88,"I did a search. There are actually quite a few tips. Apparently I'm not importing, I'm just returning a boat to the US so there isn't much issue. There are a few forms to fill out. Fill them out earlier to speed up the process. Also don't bring more than $10 K. Wire the rest in. Border guys get suspicious of amount's more than 10k. Also tell them your purpose is to LOOK at a boat, not buy. Raises flags somehow. Anymore tips?"
5860050,Andre (wallyandre),2017-11-16 07:07:00,2274,"My friend sold his boat to a US resident and it was very easy.It was from province of Quebec to upstate NY.Buer had a cash check or something similar from his bank. My friend call the bank to verify and it was clear.1- invoice for the boat, motors and all the equipment2- invoice for the trailer. Be sure the trailer got a sticker that certify that the trailer meets the US requirements; 99% of the time those trailer are ok because they are sold in the US.No tx or duties to pay at the US border; the only taxes to be paid are in the state where the boat will be register.For the trailer see the requirements (very easy): https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/det...r-into-the-u.s.To get some kind of registration for the trailer you need to go to a DMV office (at least in Quebec) to get a what we call a transit registration; that transit is good for 30 days and the cost is $20 Can.If you are buying new from a dealer get a US address near the border where you cross so the dealer can say that the boat was deliver to that address so you won't have to pay any taxes to the dealer.I'm very surprise that it's not something more popular when you got a 30% savings only on the exhange."
5860146,btyreprich,2017-11-16 08:17:00,1067,"The loan office at the bank I use said the loan to buy the boat Must be in the form of a cashier's check and payable to the marine dealer. As such, I'll not have to worry about crossing the border with more than $10K. It's scary carrying around that amount of cash. on a separate but somewhat related issue on cash: We adopted two children from Siberia just after 9/11 and traveled with a LOT of cash to pay for the legal fees and agency fees in that country. Wife and I wore money belts and the only time we took the belts off were when we were in the shower. Like I said - scary to carry around that amount of cash."
