5381754,Baseline,2017-03-07 19:23:00,3207,"About 10 years ago we stayed at a roadside campground located off Hwy 502 just before the right turn that takes you to Dryden. We fished Godsend, Dore and western Wabagoon. Godsend had lots of walleyes, but they were in the 13 to 15 inch range. The part of the lake on the westside of 502 is shallow and very rocky so be careful. To access the part of the lake on the east side of 502 requires a trip through the culvert. We went through it in a 18 foot Lund Alaskan, but any larger boats might not be able to do it. That side of the lake is deeper and wasn't as good for walleyes, but the pike were nice size and fun to catch. Dore is an excellent lake to fish, but the road going to it was made in **** and a 4X4 us essential. Part of the ramp is a large rock outcropping and very steep and not suitable for boats larger than the Alaskan. We hit Wabagoon on a windy rainy day. We caught walleyes, but it was rock and roll all day and hard to fish it properly. We also went south to Corby Lake. The access road was muddy and required a 4X4. Ramp is level, but very unimproved. Fishing was great for walleyes with lots of 17 to 24 inch fish. I heard that they improved the road a few years ago."
5381874,medic583,2017-03-07 19:57:00,23,"If you're looking for access to our local lakes, check out Fishonline from the MNR. It gives types of fish, access points and more. Beware though, some landings and trails in can get overgrown in short time (or as mentioned, may require quad or 4x4 to access).http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/"
5382762,emma17,2017-03-08 09:31:00,436,"Baseline and Medic583, Thank you very much for your posts, they very informative. I've always daydreamed of stopping along 502 to explore some of those lakes. Of course, I do that wherever I see a lake. Thanks again."
5384090,martinbns,2017-03-08 17:24:00,1520,"Five Lakes Lodge in Red Lake can do that, great folks."
5384418,medic583,2017-03-08 21:07:00,23,"NP, those little lakes are a LOT of fun and the web site has been an amazing resource as i venture out after work weekly. My buddy and I met a couple 2 yrs ago back on one of the trails while we were hand bombing my 14' down a hill and into one of the lakes who told us that in the past 20 years of coming up here to their camp they had tried over 100 little lakes. Loved the idea and in the past two years of learning how to fish I've now hit about 15 and are just getting started My next goal in my little skiff is all those little lakes from Dryden to Kenora...soo many to try and soo many adventures ahead."
5386610,Baseline,2017-03-10 06:43:00,3207,"Take a look at the Cedar Narrows and Weller Lake Roads which run to the west off of 502. They are located approximately 10 to 20 miles up 502 from Hwy 11. Weller will take you back to Cuttle Lake which connects to Obakoba and Mainville; and, Weller. Both have good ramps. There are another 5 lakes that have access, but take some effort to get a boat into. Cedar Narrows has lots of lakes with ramps. Pickwick, Straw, Essox, and Muskeg are a few with ramps. Essox give access to the Manitou. Lots of lake the are easily accessible with a smaller boat. Hauled a canoe into some others. I've spent 35 years fishing many of the lakes located in this area. It takes some effort to drive to and access some of the lakes, but well worth it. They just extended the Cedar Narrows Road so more lakes are now accessible. We usually stay at Timberwolf Lodge using cabins or their campground."
5852082,jackpotjohnny48,2017-11-10 01:27:00,153,"This is a great thread. I will be fishing Pipestone Lake in the Emo, Ontario area for a week in 2018. But I am planning on bringing a canoe, and staying 3 extra days, specifically for the purpose of trying out some of the little lakes.I did this a few years ago in the Nestor Falls area, as well as near Kenora, and I had a blast. May have to check out some of the stuff off of 502 next year, near Cedar Narrows Road.Thanks for sharing, guys!""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
5852378,tv4fish,2017-11-10 06:59:00,2694,"This old thread reminded me of our very first trip to Canada (Yup - way back in 1985)We also wanted to try different lakes. Our first stop was at the little store/gas station just north of the junction of Hwy 11 and 502. We stopped in there and asked the elderly woman which lake(s) we should try to fish for BIG walleyes. Her first response was ""You should have been here 50 years ago""!!!!!!!!!!!She did give us directions to a ""remote"" lake - so off we went. We did not have a SUV pulling my boat at the time - we had one of my buddy's new station wagon! The access road to this lake was literally a ""2 rut"" road and my buddy was pretty nervous about his new station wagon (I was driving). We even had to negotiate a vehicle coming out of the access - that was FUN! When we got there - there was NO way we could launch my boat at the access - way too rough.Anyway - ""long story short"" at the end of our week we ended up fishing Lac Seul (yeah - NOT a small lake) and that is where we have been going since..........."
5852674,srj,2017-11-10 09:01:00,971,"Years ago when my boat was a 16' with a 60, I fished quite a number of bush lakes. Some were great some were busts but it was always exciting to hit uncharted water. We learned early on it was best to leave your boat at camp and check out lake roads/trails first. Trying to turn around with a trailer on a bush trail can be an ugly experience. Having a roller trailer helps launching as there are few ramps, mostly flat rocks or gravel/sand areas. We actually never found a lake with a true ramp. Logging roads often run to or near lakes...stay aware if active logging is going on, those truckers roll! Bring a spare prop and at least one spare tire. We hardly ever saw another person except on logging roads. It was a total blast having a lake to explore being the only boat on the lake, good fishing or bad. Google Earth and other maps will get you started. Good luck"
5299346,Larry S,2017-01-29 13:47:00,665,"Went to Gold Arrow Camp around 2003 They have boats on Many lakes in their area you can drive to We fished a different lake every day ,had a blast ,caught walleye, smallmouth, pike, trout and large perch . Very reasonable for the cost"
5299426,prov1800,2017-01-29 14:25:00,5010,Just read your post and would like to remind you that in may there is no muskie season as its closed till third Saturday of june.but yes there is muskie close by in lac sue and big vermilion.
5299434,andersaki,2017-01-29 14:30:00,1426,"My brother and I did that probably 15 years ago. We stayed at a lodge near Ignace. They kept 14' boats with 9.9 motors cached at different lakes. We had good fishing, but frankly with three teenagers along it got to be alot of work getting everyone up, fed breakfast, lunches made and then drive up to an hour to that days lake. Then after arriving and schlepping all the gear to the boats before we could fish. Reverse that procedure at the end of the day plus cleaning fish. At the end of the week we had fished a different lake every day and had a good experience, but it probably would have been a lot easier for our crew to fish one lake with a cabin at the other end of the dock. andersaki"
5299642,Walleye will,2017-01-29 17:20:00,218,Does anyone know where the boat launches are on 502?
5300834,Aspencreek,2017-01-30 08:18:00,2911,"There is one just as you start north on 502, and a couple other ""undeveloped"" along the way. By that I mean no pier, little parking, etc."
5301154,Walleye will,2017-01-30 10:54:00,218,Have you had any experience with these lakes? Will
5301754,JayM5209,2017-01-30 17:08:00,1050,x 2. Check out their web site. Have been going there for 39 years (plus other lodges/camps in addition). Excellent camp and hosts. Sounds very much like what you're looking for.
5301874,Aspencreek,2017-01-30 17:56:00,2911,"No, always headed to Lac Seul, thought that it might be interesting to take a week after I retire to explore some of the smaller lakes in a canoe. But by that time I won't be able to carry my gear and canoe and it may be too much work. But driving by, they sure look interesting."
5302010,Baseline,2017-01-30 18:47:00,3207,"I have the perfect trip for you. Base at Timberwolf Lodge which is located on HWY 502 running between Fort Francis and Dryden. The resort is on Winkle Lake which has lake trout, pike and SMB. The next day you can drive about 10 miles south to Rainy Lake and launch your boat into Crow Rock Inlet which gets you into Red Gut and Baseline Bays which are good walleye areas. Good crappie fishing here in June. About 5 miles south of the resort is the Weller Lake Road that lead to Weller and Cuttle Lakes. I personally don't care for Weller because it is rocky and not a good fish producer. Cuttle is my choice. In addition to Cuttle you have access to 2 other lakes Obakoba and Mainville and 17 miles of walleye and pike waters. 2 miles north of the resort is the Cedar Narrows Road which will give you access to 20 more lakes depending on how aggressive you are and the work you are willing to do to get into some of them. Lakes with easy access and good ramps are Pickwick (walleye), Muskeg (mainly pike) Essox (smb, pike, lake trout, occasional muskie). Essox is the gateway lake to the Manitou (lake trout, pike, smb, muskie) and Straw (walleye, big smb). I've been fishing this area for 35 years and we have been on most of the accessible lakes at one time or another. The resort is off the grid and has plywood floors and propane lights, but it is set in a beautiful setting. The cabins are clean and have everything you need. Not sure about battery charging. They were planning on putting in a new generator to provide this so check on that. Otherwise you need your own generator. The owners are great people and have a good knowledge of the area lakes."
5381618,Shadow4904,2017-03-07 18:25:00,2,"Hi, if you haven't found a place yet, check us out at happycampontario. We have many lakes in the area that get no fishing pressure, and you are only limited by your sense of adventure and energy. While we have boat cached, there are endless lakes and rivers nearby to explore. We can set you up with a boat or canoe and we have all the amenities as home for a very reasonable cost. Hope to hear from you, take care."
563177,Guest,2007-02-04 16:58:00,0,"One of these years I'm thinking of staying in Dryden or Ear Falls a week and launching at a different lake each day. This way I could try some smaller out of the way lakes. I am looking for feedback for this idea. Has anybody done this? What suggestions do people have? Good idea or bad idea? What lakes would people suggest? Any advice from locals? How does one know if smaller lakes have landings? I am not looking for peoples secret spots, I catch and release any walleye over 18 inches, just looking for advice and wisdom."
563179,prov1900,2007-02-04 17:42:00,544,"Never done it myself, but always wanted to. Going to Minnitaki in May. Supposed to be a muskie lake within striking distance, so I think I will get it done this time. If you are on a good system with lots of variety though, stay on it, learn it, and change up what species you are going after on the same lake. I think switching a lot during a vacation, i.e., more than once, would be a mistake, although wind/weather/hot bite may dictate your choice. Then again, who am I to say. Spend your vacation the way you want. No regrets...ever."
563183,Trailerguy,2007-02-04 21:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I fish a number of smaller lakes in the Perrault Falls area, as well as Wabby. The small lakes offer calmer water, and a more varied landscape. But they have disadvantages as well. Landings are few, lots require entrance thru creeks or portages, and a lot more physical work to get there. You learn quickly what you really need to carry along and what isn't. Lakes vary from mulit-species to minnow lakes. Pike and perch will go a lot farther up stream over obsticales to populate a lake than Walleye. Lake trout require deep water, small mouth for the most part are recent transplants, introduced by some well meaning fisherman. There are some resorts that fish these small lakes exclusivly, not all lodges are located on a fishery like Lac Suel. If you want recomendations to some of these outfitters, e-mail me. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
563186,Greg @ ABL,2007-02-04 22:58:00,23,"I'm not posting this as a sales call, but that is one of the things I do with guests at my lodge. Many people really enjoy fishing those out of the way lakes. You get different structure, and a varied experience on each lake. If you have any questions about the smaller bush lakes, give me a shout. I am not in the Perrault Falls area, but can give you a good idea of what to expect. All the best, Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944"
563192,Guest,2007-02-05 08:51:00,0,We do the same thing but in a different area(LOTW). The only advice I can give is to take to your camp owner before you choose and tell them what type of boat/tow vehicle you have. Some of the lakes are down logging roads and some are more like trails than roads and could scratch a truck/boat. We do it every year amd love it.
563199,Sutsgold,2007-02-05 12:15:00,219,"Like you, I too would love to do something like that. We stay near dryden and have fished from minnitaki to ear falls, but have never hit the small lakes. Would love any info anyone could provide. Preferably a walleye lake, but musky would be fun too. Has anyone ever fished Godsend lake on 502? Always looks intriguing on the way up."
563210,Guest,2007-02-05 19:41:00,0,Why don't you try to go to a lake system where you could access other small lakes. This is what I do when I go to Canada but it seems you want to use your own boat.
563211,Guest,2007-02-05 20:41:00,0,"if you're gonna go to lakes that have launches, i'd say you are better off to stay on lac seul. it's like a hundred lakes all strung together. i have only fished a remote once, several miles down an overgrown logging road in eastern ontario. lots of walleye and pike, but all small. my brother in law did a walk in up around lac seul and swears he'd never do it again. only about a quarter mile in there. blew out a knee trying to walk on top of that bog or whatever that forest floor is. it's a young man's game. not for me at my age. i've been fishing lac seul for years and have probably fished 2-3% of it, and i'm the adventurous type. i'll run 15-20 miles. my son and i try to explore a new area/island chain every year."
