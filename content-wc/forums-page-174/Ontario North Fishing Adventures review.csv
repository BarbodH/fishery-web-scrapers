Right off the bat i rate matt and his crazy,fun dad 100% for guiding,which we didnt pay for.....these guys take pride to put their customers on the fish!They truly want you to have an incredible fishing experience.....oh,and we did! I think jay and i caught 40+ walleye in 20-30 minutes!Thick,fighting fish as well.....i will never forget it....we were on our own for a day,and even though we did well,it was nothing compared to the numbers we caught while being guided by the yukes......and they were fun to fish with,i was amazed by their down to earth,fun attitude My highlight of the trip was an unplanned shore lunch....which our party did not expect at all,but Ontario North Fishing Adventures wants your experience to be remembered.....ill never forget it.....anyone that loves a shore lunch can totally appreciate it...but we didnt expect it at all!picture this.....a fire,a grill,bacon wrapped walleye chunks smothered in dianna sauce....beers in hands,great conversation and a view to die for!the birth of a perfect memory! The cabin is immaculate!clean with space to move.The cabin has 3 comfortable rooms,a stand up shower and an average flushable toilet.....but its surrounded with pine and it is quite nice did i mention satellite tv?lol we had it on a music station 90% of the time,but i never missed the latest ""hells kitchen"" episode!lmao.....did i just type that? give these guys a try,they are real deal!they want you to succeed!i think bottom line thats why they do it...."
