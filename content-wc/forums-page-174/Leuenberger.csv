Boats were fine, not the best i've used at a lodge, but again the flight distance is quite a bit further.Fishing on Kag can be outstanding. Big body of water. Walleye, Pike, Lakers and Whitefish. We had some nasty weather when we were there and the fish were still moving into their summer locations. However, when we fished the incoming water the fishing was spectacular.On our way we dropped off/picked up a father/son at Kellow Lake. I took some photo's of that camp. It's probably typical of most of their camps. Fairly basic, but not run down. Looked pretty decent to me anyway. Kellow had 16' Lunds with what looked like 9.9HP's. Probably should have 14'ers, but a lot of the camps probably do. You can see the photo's here.http://fishingoutposts.com/?listing=...on-kellow-lakeGood luck with your search!"

5854714,515,2017-11-11 14:31:00,254,Drop by this site I have I think I have ten reports from Leuenberger trips posted there if you search them out and feel free to ask any questions.http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...rip-reports-1/
5860762,wantabigone,2017-11-16 16:23:00,39,"I have fished Kag as well and we were fortunate to have had perfect weather except for 1 day. The fishing was great once you located them which was not too difficult. We even caught a 14 pound trout in 12 feet of water fishing for walleye 10 feet from shore in a bay. That was a nice treat. My buddy saw what he swears was a 50+ inch pike, unfortunately it was not interested in anything he offered. The lake is huge and offers a wide variety of fish and structure. As was mentioned in a previous post the boats were decent. The main lidge is full service which was a bit of a treat for us as we normally do outposts. As soon as we pulled up a lodge employee would fill the gas tank up so all we had to do was jump back into the boat and go. The link for Muskrat lake was made my myself. If interested in more details of either lake PM me."
