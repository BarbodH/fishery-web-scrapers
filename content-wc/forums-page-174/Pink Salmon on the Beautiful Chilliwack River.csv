The water levels have stayed so low and changed up a lot of the fishing spots. Well I don't profess to be a river fisherman by any means. But in the next few years I hope to put in some time and with the help of some fishing buddies I might be catching more than just snags and skunks at the river. Join us on a beautiful day on the picturesque Chilliwack river in this video. I long line released a few and the fish I actually brought in looks like the fish either missed the jig or I was just full on snagged into her. We never intentionally snag them just sometimes seems to happen especially with the twitching jigs.Sent from my SM-G900W8 using Tapatalk
