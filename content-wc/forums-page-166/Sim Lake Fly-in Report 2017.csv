Hope you enjoy, I know our crew had another awesome northern Ontario fishing trip and are counting down the days till this year. Just putting link to report here as i'm having had time or actually more frustrated posting pics on all the different sites so this is easiest for me. https://www.canadafishingguide.net/f...e-2017-report/ Mike"

6065217,515,2018-03-16 08:27:00,254,Actually enough open water to keep you fishing and still sheltered enough to never be blown off lake. I'll be calling ya shortly about the moose hunt once things slow down a bit work wise.
