6092177,lassh,2018-03-28 08:57:00,553,"I had a lot of strikes on the 8Â” Sebile Soft magic swimbait in Canada but the hookup rate was dismal. The strikes were mostly from good sized pike. The baits uses a 9/0 swimbait hook. I tried pulling the hook up to expose it more but still had issues with getting the pike hooked. I was using good heavy pike rod, it would just rip out of their mouths without hooking. I don't have the same issue with other hollow bodied swimbaits such as money minnows or shadilicious, however those baits get destroyed rather quickly and weight limitations prevent bringing a bunch of those baits along. The Sebile baits are more durable and have a jointed structure so don't lose action because there is no tail to bite off. Do others who have used this bait have the same issue? Any ideas for improving the hook rate. My hook up rate was less than 25% on these last year. I know if I used swimbaits with exposed hooks or trebles the hookups would improve but those get fouled too much pulling through weeds etc."

I would suggest giving it a couple seconds pause (after the strike) prior to setting the hook, as that is the suggested method with any soft swim bait. Other than that, set the hook with your rod parallel to the water and straight ""away"" from the running fish if that makes sense. They do look good in the water!"

With their flatter heads and less defined lips than say a Bass I think the hook rarely gets fully exposed/engaged. So when you set the hook it just scratches the upper surface of the pikes mouth. When I use 6 in swinbaits I do a standard exposed hook and dont have the same hook up problems.I think you were on the right thought process when you said you shifted the hook to be more exposed. BTW...I bought two packages of Sebiles to try this year. YEs they look fantastic.My two cents...B-"
6092705,rsiminski,2018-03-28 13:00:00,53,I used the sabile soft magic swimmers extensively last June fishing Cree Lake in Saskatchewan and it was one of my top producing baits. I never had any issues with missing the pike. Don't give up on them they are an incredible soft plastic to use.
6092865,MikeG1,2018-03-28 14:58:00,433,Add a stinger hook to catch those short strikers. I make my own in various sizes and use them with a lot of baits. PM me if you want info.
