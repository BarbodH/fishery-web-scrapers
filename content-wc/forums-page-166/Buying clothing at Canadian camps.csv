6067329,Fisherman Ted,2018-03-17 10:07:00,461,"A guide shirt is a fishing shirt worn by well guides. You see guides in the keys wearing them all the time. Long sleeved, button down. Wick away moisture (so not cotton). Vented in the back when it gets hot. They are great on hot days as you can roll down the sleeves to keep the sun off yet you have the vent to keep you cool. I give them to all my guides (hence the name). -FT"
6067513,Pooch,2018-03-17 12:29:00,4618,"Thank you.My wife has bought me a couple of those over the years, but I've never worn them. Didn't know they had a name. I'm more of a faded worn out work shirt type. They seemed a little to pretentious for my on the ""down low"" personal being. They seem too nice to wear fishin'. Since she got them for me , I suppose I should at least take them next trip..........Learn something new (to me) everyday.Pooch"
6068505,Huntindave,2018-03-18 08:47:00,2194,"I too am in the group that is willing to pay for quality. I look at the stitching, the buttons or zipper and general fit. Why spend my money on something that I won't wear again? Including a clothing item to the customer is a two way street. Obviously, nothing is free. I can either, pay my bill and get a ""free"" tee shirt or I can leave home knowing and planning for buying a clothing item as part of my trip expense. Six of one and half dozen of the other."
6069841,Mojo-NC,2018-03-19 06:48:00,1929,"My favorite items are baseball caps with the lodge logo and dry-fit type material long sleeve t-shirts. I like the guide shirts, but I already have a bunch of them, and they can be quite expensive for the good ones. I agree that there is a huge difference in the quality of the guide shirts between manufacturers. If you don't believe me, just buy a BPS World Wide Sportsman version and a Columbia. See which one you wear after even a single washing."
6070065,johnboat,2018-03-19 08:01:00,2014,"I always pick up at least a cap and Hoodie every year. I would be embarrassed to tell how many shirts I have. Tshirts, hoodies, denim shirts, (long sleeve and short sleeve), guide shirts, (long sleeve and short sleeve), caps, (with and without a bill light) stocking caps, jackets, ( fleece, spring jackets, and winter weight), coffee cups, soup bowls ( hand painted), fishaflauge ...........My only complaint is sometimes the zipper is on the wrong side...........and no its not women's in a XXXL-Tall. Lol"
6070081,bigwalleye1,2018-03-19 08:07:00,2632,"A hoodie with the camp name/logo, and T-shirts in sizes for real people, like something starting with an X followed by numbers. The camp we go to has TONS of little kid shirts, but I rarely see a child in camp in the summer."
6070169,MrSimon,2018-03-19 08:43:00,922,"I'm a BIG fan of getting a free T-shirt when you show up to camp ... even if I know the price is included, it's still awesome. For the store ... you can't ever go wrong with nice quality T-shirts at reasonable prices. If the shirt looks cool and is less than $20, I'll buy it."
6070273,kona77,2018-03-19 09:46:00,236,"Agree that a nice T-shirt at a decent price (<$20) is one of the things I will consider. Our outfitter (Clarks Resorts) always supplies something with our trips (baseball caps, coffee tumbler, fishing towel etc).. Not big ticket items but it is always nice to get the little extra's from any business you deal with today.."
6070321,Ricky Spanish,2018-03-19 10:05:00,1298,"I buy a new hoodie, fleece, hat, and/or jacket every year. The lodge has really upped its clothing quality under the new-ish ownership, and I think the prices are fair. Probably the only thing I think I paid too much for was an RTIC 30oz tumbler I ""needed"" last year. It was dipped in this cool pattern and etched with the lodge's name. It does keep coffee hot for a hours, but for $60, it better do more than just look cool to me."
6070553,Mojo-NC,2018-03-19 11:17:00,1929,"The RTIC coffee tumblers are awesome. If anything, they keep coffee too hot for too long. However, at $60 all I can say is ouch. I bought a case of their tumblers last year at Christmas and gave them away as gifts. I think the price was around $10 each. Then again, it's all supply and demand. If I have the hot lure of the year and nobody else in my group has one, the price of my extra one goes up exponentially. Of course, I always tell the guys that every lure in my box is ""my last one"". Yet, somehow I still end up passing my extra along to one of the other guys, especially if he has been struggling."
6066017,Aspencreek,2018-03-16 14:13:00,2911,"Is that in CA currency? With a good exchange rate, that's a deal. With so many on-line wholesaler's doing logo'ed clothing you maybe should do some price checking on your costs. I was having my companies logo'ed items done locally when I came upon an on-line guy and he cut my cost over 30% with better stuff."
6066033,Obabikon,2018-03-16 14:17:00,2370,That's in US funds. I try to make apparel affordable. It bugs me to have to charge a ton for some things.
6066129,packpro,2018-03-16 15:43:00,695,Still have a T-shirt from one of my first trips. Just noticed it is getting frayed around the collar. It is 18 years old. Back then the shirts were very heavy cotton with a real nice stitched camp logo. Almost everyone in camp had one. The camp is not selling T-shirts anymore. Instead they are selling the UV shirts with the camp logo. You might see one in camp all week and that guy is wearing cologne. They have the same shirts for sell that they brought in 5 years ago.
6066361,yoopertrout,2018-03-16 19:27:00,1172,"I like a hat or a t-shirt. My pet peeve, though is cheap brands of t-shirts. I can't stand Gildan. Maybe it's just the way I'm built, but they are too short. I've had other brands that, after you wash them a few times, they are basically two feet tall, three feet wide, and in the shape of a parallelogram. I like the Comfort Colors Brand."
6066385,Bill Krejca,2018-03-16 19:34:00,6107,"Reminds me of a sort of funny story. Way back in the early 1970's, I was going to Mirond Lake in Sask. The nearest buying town was Flin Flon, Manitoba. I stopped there in a store, maybe it was called Co-Op, or something like that. At the time, the U.S. did not allow any China imports of clothing, and, as I remember, China seemed to just be in the process of establishing a clothing foothold in this hemisphere. Anyway, I came across this very heavy weight cotton green and black plaid shirt for a ridiculous price, around maybe $2.50, or so (remember, this was around 45 years ago). I though it would be kinda cool to have a Chinese shirt (how situations change, eh?) I purchased an extra large, figuring it was bound to fit over other clothes - I having maybe a 34 waist (at the time). I really didn't try it on for fit. When I later put it on, I found that apparently the current Chinese fit for extra large was more like what in the U.S. would be a medium, and that arms were not very long over there. Although I was able to wear it, the ends of the sleeves were about half way between my elbow and my wrist. Any way, I did wear the shirt for some time after, always got a lot of funny looks from folks who didn't know the story. Got both funny looks and never ending snickers from friends? who did know the story. Like the country song by Lorrie Morgan, ""Guess You Had To Be There""! Fishing was sure good at Mirond Lake. Bill"
6066665,adempsey2.0,2018-03-16 23:00:00,612,"If I were outfitter, I'd just include the cost of swag into the rates and give everyone a ""free"" hat or shirt or whatever. Free advertising at zero cost. I might even eat the cost if it's a t-shirt or hat. I have gotten free hats/shirts from some outfitters.I'll buy a hat, shirt or hoodie/fleece as a souvenir, but not if it's way over priced."
6066865,wallydave,2018-03-17 05:25:00,2151,"I will usually buy a hat, t-shirt , sweatshirt or oxford shirt depending on the price and if I really like what they offer, sure a good experience at the lodge, not just the fishing, but the whole stay will help in the process! Now that my wife is going with me, I add to the budget for some extra shopping!"
6067041,Fisherman Ted,2018-03-17 07:04:00,461,"I spend a ton of time thinking about stuff to go in the tackle/gift shop each year. Too much time I think. You have like 16 weeks to turn it around. Buy too much or too expensive and it sucks up your cash flow. Not enough and your shelves are bare for your August guests. At the end of the day its probably a wash in terms of how much revenue it actually brings in.I try to always have items people might need in their trip they forgot. Sunglasses, croakies, hats, gloves, socks (a big seller believe it or not). Then of course are hats and T-shirts. Hundreds of those we give away or sell at cost (or close to cost). Marketing 101. Plus when you give one away at dinner in front of all the guests for catching a lunker boy that gets people excited.But after that then what? Those fish hoodies wholesale for like $100 each. Ouch. You want enough of those in different sizes it gets pricey quick. Sweat-shirts are nice. Guide shirts for sure. After people grab a hat or whatever I always like to have a few high-end clothing items. If I am going to pay for a guide shirt I want a NICE shirt. Something that will last. So, I always stock the shelves with a couple of items that yes, are expensive but are quality. You can get a guide shirt from a local wholesaler up here for like maybe $30. But they are garbage. I will get the high-end ones. You get what you pay for. You can scrimp on a hat. But a jacket for example do you really want to buy something cheap? No way. Its free advertising yes but I want you to actually enjoy your purchase.-FT"
6067233,Pooch,2018-03-17 09:23:00,4618,"Ted,What is a guide shirt?Having some ""real"" sized (for Americans) sweatshirts in stock is nice. I've bought a number of them over the years. Most have been high quality, tall or long, heavy weight shirts that I still have and use. There's nothing good about a shirt of any kind that ends about my belt line or sleeves between my elbows and wrist after one washing. I don't mind paying a little extra for the convenience of not having to drive to town (if that option exists) to replace a torn or lost sweatshirt. Especially if it is quality.If gear sold in camp doesn't have a bunch of logos or dates that limit appeal then it could be held over for future seasons. Don't let them fade in the sunlight while on display. The more subtle the camp logo the more classy the shirt is. If it's obnoxious then it won't get worn once back home. Probably end up in the rag pile. My favorite ""branded"" shirt is a black T-shirt with logo also embroidered in black on the left chest area. Nothing on the back or anywhere else. I wear it for casual dress.Just my random thoughts.Pooch"
6067313,andreindy,2018-03-17 09:58:00,308,"To me, unless a basic need is urgent (as in, freezing to death from poor packing choices), I will only buy camp clothing products that appear to be ""quality"" and I understand that I will need to pay for said quality. T-shirts I might bend that rule because they are a short term purchase by nature. But sweatshirts, shirts, hoodies, fleece....I want something well made and that feels comfortable wearing. I also tend to be maybe too practical sometimes (according to my wife) and I like a good deal of my purchases to meet a need or purpose. Now, if we were back in the days where a $10 pizza was a major expenditure, I might think differently, but so were my priorities. Back then, Canada was just a place that had a beaver on its nickel."
6065633,FishinSasquatch,2018-03-16 12:09:00,8,Discussing with a few camp owners about there clothing sales and have a few questions. What kind of clothing would most people buy for souvenirs? What kind of clothing would you want to buy for weather? The reason I ask is because the camp owners have some items that have sat for a few seasons and they want to avoid getting stuff that wont sell.
6065673,Sportdog,2018-03-16 12:18:00,6735,"Bang for your buck issue. I wouldn't spend the outrageous price they charge. Maybe I'm just cheap. The reason things like that don't sell is they are charging too much. Don't know about the cost to produce these items so maybe the profit margin isn't really that much. Anyway, just my opinion which is worth what you pay for it."
6065681,Juls,2018-03-16 12:18:00,13414,"I always buy a new hoodie from Meta Lake Lodge every year...and, if they have a long sleeved UV performance shirt, I get that too. I'm not a T-shirt wearing kind of gal, so I pass on those. I prefer zip-up hoodies, but no one ever seems to have those."
6065777,jimirjr,2018-03-16 13:03:00,1149,"I ALWAYS purchase a shirt, cap or item of interest from camps that I visit.. Its a MEMORY type purchase of the place.. It's cool to wear in Your HOME TOWN, where NO ONE recognizes it. Then They always ask questions.."
6065873,emma17,2018-03-16 13:21:00,436,"I'm a comfort guy. The material must not be stiff and the length must work as I'm taller. I'm not typically looking to buy something to wear while at the camp, but for when I get home."
6065921,Aspencreek,2018-03-16 13:38:00,2911,"The clothing and labeled items they are selling should NOT be a big profit center but rather a marketing tool for them. They should make a little but not the usual 100% markup. Like Sportdog said ""bang for the buck"" and if it is a real good deal your visitor feels obligated to purchase an item and then you have turned your customer into a walking billboard for your camp. The camp I go to has a really nice logo (that helps) and I buy a hat and sweatshirt every trip. The price is very reasonable, and is it me or are CA made sweatshirts made with LONGER sleeves, which is also a good thing.Note the trendy stuff, long sleeve dri-fit, short sleeve dri-fit, sweatshirts, hoodies, ball caps (camo or not). I would avoid the smaller sizes, go heavy on L, XL, and XXL (you can go bigger, but if you buy it to small it will never be worn). Neutral colors, base colors, avoid the Fun colors, remember who the customers are.I was in that business for a year, both fun and frustrating!"
6065929,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-16 13:50:00,8293,"Tell your owners to try this. Upon check-in hand the person paying the bill a coupon for a free hat or piece of lodge clothing. That is great marketing as mentioned, also the rest of the group will go buy something because the lodge owners are nice people. I don't think EVERY single thing a lodge owner does needs to be a profit center for them."
6065953,Obabikon,2018-03-16 13:54:00,2370,"One of the coolest stories of our camp was that two of our yearly guests met in Mexico. One of them was wearing his Obabikon shirt while on a family trip south of the border. They always had different weeks at the resort, so had never met on the island. Both of them called me to relay the story, and my response was... you went to Mexico in the off season without sending me so much as an invite? We all still get a good laugh about it. I agree that apparel prices are pretty expensive. We're still managing to charge $15 for t-shirt, but a hooded sweatshirt is $50... and that is almost no profit for the resort. Performance dryfit shirts are $40, and that price probably has to go up this year."
6065969,mjayn,2018-03-16 13:56:00,1188,"Most trips I am in the lodge twice. Registering and squaring up. Never considered buying anything unless an unexpected need came up, which it hasn't yet. 1000 pictures should cover the memories."
6066001,Aspencreek,2018-03-16 14:03:00,2911,"Actually when I made a couple late in the season trips a few years ago, the camp owner would bring the bill and 6 hats the night before we pulled out (there were 6 of us). Different styles and colors and we would draw cards for first choice. Great way to build loyalty, a fine thank you, and still have and wear them today. It's all about marketing and making this a marketing cost, If you are going to put your logo or camp name on an article of clothing and want people to voluntarily purchase it, it better be a good deal, because every time they wear it they are advertising for you."
