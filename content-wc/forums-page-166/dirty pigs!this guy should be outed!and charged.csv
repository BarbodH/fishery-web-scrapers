6101218,last chance,2018-04-01 07:01:00,3262,MAN!! thats just wrong. hitting one of those big tanks at 40 or 50 mph even in a boat could very easily kill someone. burn the people that left that crap on the ice.
6101258,Mooner,2018-04-01 07:12:00,273,They left fingerprints and DNA everywhere...should be able to find them. Put 'em in the cage with Sgt. Voight!
6101778,Daddybigfins,2018-04-01 10:13:00,484,I-O! Just makes you sick to see that lack of appreciation and respect for the environment in general and the resource that we as fisherman love and consider sacred.
6101826,mr yukon,2018-04-01 10:25:00,23,Aren't they the same people that enjoy the resource? So next year they want to fish for contaminated food! And have unclean facilities Only in north america
6102274,tandm,2018-04-01 13:18:00,679,"And that""s why I always carry a garbage bag when I go fishing,soft or hard water. Frustrating that a few of our fellow sportsmen paint this picture of the rest of us, but I try to do my best to clean up after them, like my mother did for me when I was a child. Trash left in the outdoors reflects on all of us."
6103554,gregk9,2018-04-01 23:45:00,625,Filthy pigs! Hire a haz mat team to clean it up and make the slobs pay for it!
