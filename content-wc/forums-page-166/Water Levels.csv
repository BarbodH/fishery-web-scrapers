Did they get a lot of rain last fall, a lot of snow this winter? The past few years the water level has been down a foot or two."

I too am wondering what the water level will be this season in that lake.The water level in spring 2017 was about the same as that in autumn 2016. That is, there was little new water in the system from the winter of 2016/2017. The water level last season started out unusually low and went down from there.The lodge owner has said to me that snow melt in the spring helps the water level in the lake somewhat. The real difference maker is getting good springtime rain that continues on a regular basis throughout the open water timeframe. There was relatively little rain last season in the vicinity of the lake that I regularly fish.I believe that lodge owners share the disappointment felt by their guests when they get a week of rain during their vacation. But I suspect that the same lodge owners are silently glad as that rain hopefully keeps the water level in the lake high enough to avoid problems at the dock and with navigational hazards.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

That explains the colors on the graphs.In the center top of the main page, click on ""Historical Graphs Page"". That will give you 5-year graphs."
