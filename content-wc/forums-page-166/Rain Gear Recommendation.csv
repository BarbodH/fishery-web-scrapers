6075345,Aspencreek,2018-03-21 08:29:00,2911,"Yes, Bibs for sure. The guys that say you don't need bibs have never had them. You do not need insulated. Simply layer underneath, and remove as the day heats up. I am wearing mine when I leave the dock even if it is sunny and 80, just to make sure I have them, plus zipping across the water at first light can be ""refreshing"", then simply remove when you get to the first spot. Make sure they are large enough to layer underneath, this is FUNCTION over fashion. Where many people will fail is footwear. What good does it do to have a great rainsuit if your feet are wet. I fish in tennis shoes, et al. But when it starts to rain, I have a pair of rubber boots from the local farm store that simply pull over the tennis shoes. They look like crap, but my feet are dry, and they pack small."
6098138,Hunts1,2018-03-30 19:10:00,123,"I use a goretex jacket and pants most of the time. The maker/brand isn't real important but fit and function is. My Patagonia goretex jacket is 15 years old and still breathes and repels. If it is really wet I have rubber pants. If you sit in goretex in the rain your *** is going to get wet, doesn't matter how much you pay for it."
6098850,prov1800,2018-03-31 07:50:00,5010,I will agree that both the cabelas and bass pro rain gear is top notch.i have some older and newer outfits.have found that the material gets dirty and that's when you might get some leakage in spots.ive always washed mine with a special cleaner and find when I do this they work perfect again.i really like the bass pro qualifier set.its a much lighter and not so stiff feeling as the guidewear and 100 mile bass pro.also might mention I have fright togs to and they also keep you dry but find you sweat in them as you do in rubber.
6099218,papadave,2018-03-31 09:54:00,151,I've been wrestling with this for years and spent a fortune chasing it. My biggest issue was always that there was no fly that doesn't leak when my crotch forms its own swimming pool. So I got a really awesome set of commercial fishing Healy Hanson bibs and zipperless pull over jacket. Unfortunately when I get cold I have to pee a bunch of times and I was trapped in my rainsuit. It took so long to get everything off and then back on I would still get soaked. This resolution may not be for everyone but it has worked pretty good for me. I got a lightweight roll up motorcycle rainsuit where the zipper starts on the side of the waist and goes up across the chest so it doesn't leak into the crotch. It also has Velcro cuffed sleeves and legs which helps with the wicking. For those times when it is a cold rain I also got the cheapest lightest Frogg Toggs. I can quickly throw them over top of the motorcycle suit. The two suits together take up very little room when folded up and are easy to get in and out of. They also dry quickly when hung up overnight.
6108618,zeebee,2018-04-04 03:16:00,1144,Musky fishing late last Oct. ****tiest weather possible. Back at dock I was dry all week. Others varied from soaked to moderately wet. I have a 4 layer River Salt Patagonia. 4 layer is the key in extreme conditions...hard to find and the set I have has been discontinued.If I had to replace today I would go with Simms ProDry. Hate being wet. Fly fisherman seem to be catered to better than other fisherpeople when it comes to wet weather wear...likely $$
6108826,Redy2fish,2018-04-04 06:36:00,272,"Last weekend I was at D&R sports in Kalamazoo and seen they had a line of rain grear called Compass 360, it actually looked like a well built coat/ bibs, the style they had was there D300 Mossy Oak Elements AguraAny one have this or have a review"
6065505,btyreprich,2018-03-16 10:52:00,1067,Cabelas Alaskan Guidewear rain suit for me. Bibs with a longer rain parka. Fairly heavy suit that has kept me dry and warm. The plastic covering is quite thick so it also stops the wind.
6067409,Aspencreek,2018-03-17 10:44:00,2911,"I had a gander H2O series bibs and coat (longer, covering the rear end model) for years until I loaned it to my business partner when he went to CA. His wife thought it would be a good idea to launder and dry it in the machine before returning it. It now leaks like a sieve. Going to order the uninsulated Frabil set of bibs and coat before this trip. You cannot spend to much for a set of rainwear that works. You can try and ""get by"" but sitting in a boat in a constant rain, getting wetter and colder in places you didn't know could get that wet with every minute is miserable."
6067497,camp chef,2018-03-17 12:19:00,915,"I have been using the Same Cabelas Guidewear for 15 years.Snow and rain on the Wolf river this time of year and Spring trip in Canada. Still works great. If I get wet with this gear on ,it is time for a toddy and a game of cribbage."
6067721,MikeG1,2018-03-17 16:04:00,433,"I have had the Cabelas Alaskan for years now and love it. I strongly recommend some type of rubber type as opposed to Frog Togg or even Goretex. My cousin is CEO of a fabric company and informed me that Goretex will leak from pressure. Goretex breathes through very small pores in the fabric. These pores are smaller than water, thus water cannot enter the fabric. However, under pressure, water is forced through the pores. Pressure can be from sitting or leaning against the fabric. The pressure forces the water through the pore. This happened to my co-angler last year. He had an expense Goretex suit. Several days it rained and water collected on the seat he was sitting. Over time, it resulted in him having a wet butt. He saw my rubber suit and ordered one for our trip this year. If you want to stay totally dry in all,conditions, get rubber. To support this, watch TV. The guys on the tuna show and the crab show wear rubber, nothing else."
6067841,Wall-i-Lama,2018-03-17 17:30:00,1524,"My brother got the rubber (actually PVC) gear from cabelas. I think they are now called Dutch harbor. He is a big fan of the crab show. He wore them once last summer and then borrowed my spare set. He sweat his arse off in the PVC! He laughed it off and said, if he ever gets a job on a crab boat, he'll be good to go! LOLUnless you are fishin very cold weather, need the extra warmth and durability, I wouldn't recommend the PVC especially if you are fishing in summer."
6068681,Aspencreek,2018-03-18 10:36:00,2911,"X2, my first couple of years were with similar heavy PVC, and even during cooler days in the rain I was wetter on the inside because of my own sweat, those things do not breath at all no matter how many slots they put in them. To keep the pressure off the gore tex Simply keep a towel under yourself and the boat seat, yes it gets wet too but it will reduce to pressure and also keeps you from sitting in a puddle."
6072601,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-03-20 08:55:00,240,"I bought a new set of Cabela's Advance Guidewear last Christmas when it went on sale. Incredibly expensive at about $800 for the bibs and jacket, but I was due for a new set, and had a lot of Cabela's points and gift certificates, so was able to justify it that way.I have owned two sets of guidewear prior to this, and I find that after 5 or 6 years of heavy use, the gore tex breaks down, even if you launder and dry it according to manufacturer's specs, using the special soap you can get at Cabelas. As many of you have said, there is nothing worse than being in a cold, soaking May/June rain with inadequate rain gear. That is one mistake I will never make. I always take a late May/early June trip, and good guidewear is irreplaceable."
6074777,LoDo,2018-03-20 22:24:00,721,"IMO, it all depends on when and where you are going? Are you going to a lake where you are fighting big water, wind and a small boat? Eh hem... Lac Seul? If so, get some heavy duty gear. That lake in a camp boats will kick your *** if you plan to take boat rides to McKenzie and beyond. Now if you are in small lakes and all you are fighting is rain & temps then you should be able to dummy down your gear to something light weight. Again, all depends on where and when you go."
6074817,muskyman73,2018-03-21 00:08:00,401,"the bass pro 100 mph jacket and bibs, it just plain works and has the built up knees and just works great. Best suit I have ever had and I use it alot."
6075025,jkaup,2018-03-21 06:07:00,56,"Great tips folks!!! Thanks a bunch. We always make a trip to Cabela's about a month before our trip so I still have a bit of time to shop. Bib's for sure to prevent water from running down...well, you know where!!"
6061625,jkaup,2018-03-14 20:37:00,56,I've gone through 2 sets of frog togs on the 5 fly in trips I've been on. I need something more durable. Any recommendations? I bought the frog togs for the light weight aspect but they get torn and frayed easily.

6061921,martinbns,2018-03-15 05:39:00,1520,"I have the Cabelas Guidewear Angler series. It's a bit lighter weight than the extreme, I was worried about using the extreme stuff on warm days. Mine works great."
6062089,maddogg,2018-03-15 07:04:00,178,Try to get a good suit with bib pants.
6062281,valley366,2018-03-15 08:14:00,193,I have been wearing a Bass Pro 100MPH jacket for probably 10 years now. Keeps me dry.I have several sets of pants. One lightweight goretex from Cabelas. Can't say I have been overly impressed with them but they were the economical version that I picked up on a sale rack. I have Gander TechH20 or whatever they called them pants nd they have kept me dry.Ordered some Frabil stuff the other day. In fact should be here today. It was a flash sale and the prices were good enough that I took a swing on a couple of jackets and pair of pants for my kid. They are still marked down but not as good as sale as last week. https://www.wingsupply.com/storm-gea...m_campaign=3-7
6062353,stumcfar,2018-03-15 08:46:00,451,"Just received a Scheel's Outfitter Extreme Parka and Bibs. Haven't used them yet, but putting them on and looking them over, it looks to be a great set. Runs a little less than $250 American for the set."
6062753,Mojo-NC,2018-03-15 11:01:00,1929,"I use the BPS Pro Qualifier Gore-Tex parka and pants and they work well. Bibs provide better protection but are more difficult to get on and off, especially in the boat when you get caught unexpectedly in rain. Many suits (including this one) also have an optional zip-in liner for the jacket, which helps make them more versatile suits for both cold and warmer weather. If you splurge on quality rain gear and take good care of it, you will get many years of use out of it. I think the Pro Qualifier was just on sale during the spring fishing sale for $50 off per piece, so you'd be looking at somewhere in the $300 - $400 range for the set."
6064697,Pooch,2018-03-16 05:08:00,4618,"Whatever you get, get bibs. Otherwise your butt/lower back are going to be wet. Water will wick or even blow up under your top and that is cold and uncomfortable.My favorite rain suit is Cabelas, but they are not bibs so they never get worn anymore. Currently using one of BP's rain suits and it has been good for six years now.Big secret is taking good care of them and laundering them as needed. Follow directions on laundering and retreat the Goretex periodically. I use very little, if any laundry detergent when washing. The soap will never completely go away and that messes up the Goretex ability to shed water. The soap acts as a wetting agent when your gear gets rained on.Pooch"
6065089,gordy28,2018-03-16 07:37:00,437,I have the Bass Pro Qualifier bibs and jacket - love it When I knew I wanted it I just started to ask for BPS gift cards for everything and watch the flyer Cheers Gordy
6065465,Wall-i-Lama,2018-03-16 10:30:00,1524,"Whatever brand you get, I'd simply recommend Gore Tex. I've tried and returned dry plus and other products that claim to be waterproof."
