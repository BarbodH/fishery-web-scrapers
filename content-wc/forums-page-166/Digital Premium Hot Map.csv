By the way, I to had a lot of info on Gull Rock but my Lowrance locked up on me (known bug) and I had to do a hard reset of the unit and lost all of my good spots....should have known better and had a backup but I didn't. Just wanted to pass this on to you so you don't loose your info also. make a backup copy of your spots somehow. Good fishing and again thanks for your response, Jim"
