6086761,tparker,2018-03-26 07:29:00,100,We love our walleye tacos. Always bring up some fresh cilantro to sprinkle on top. Served with fresh made slaw and taco flavored doritos.
6087297,packpro,2018-03-26 10:04:00,695,"For you taco guys. Some like them with slaw and others like a dollop of guacamole. Here is a 5 minute recipe for guac that can be made while the fish is cooking. Completely flexible on quantity of ingredients put them in to your taste.2-3 avocados. Slice the circumference from top to bottom. separate the halves. Hold in your hand. Slam the edge of the knife(not the tip) into the pit. Twist and remove the pit. Scoop out the flesh. Tip on buying the avocado. if you are going to use it right away, you want one that slightly indents when you push your thumb into it. For use later in the week. get one that is rock hard. Lime - squeeze the lime in the bowl with the avocado. Mash the avocado/lime into a bowl with the back of a fork until creamy with a some chunks in there.Red or sweet onion. I use 1/2 of a sweet onion diced-fine for three avocados. I would use less if it was a red onion. slightly stronger flavor but it is preferred by some Stir. Chopped Cilantro- About a handful. (to taste)Jalapeno pepper fine diced. We do not add the seeds, but you can for a hotter version. Garlic Salt- taste before you add. Start with three pinches. Give it a good stir- taste. A little goes a long way. Add to taste. Cumin- optional. Gives it a smokey flavor. Our group prefers no cumin. So quick and easy to make. You'll never have store bought again. The secret is getting the avocados perfectly ripe. Iit is a two day window,"
6088985,Live to jig,2018-03-26 19:18:00,159,"I do the exact same recipe except I use tomato in stead of the avocados, one heck of a pico de gallo"
6068313,prov1900,2018-03-18 06:10:00,544,"Same here. If I didn't go, the guys would be eating leftover bait, and the walleye fillets would look like swiss cheese."
6070241,kona77,2018-03-19 09:36:00,236,"I commented earlier but one of our 'go-to"" fish recipes is to take walleye or northern fillets and wrap them in aluminum foil. We place some onions and slices of butter in the foil along with various marinades you can buy at Wal-mart or your local grocery store. We have tried several different marinades over the years but the Lawry brands (Caribeen Jerk, Herb-Garlic, Hawaiian) are some of our favorites.Just close the top of the foil and throw them on the grille. The fish will bake in the marinade juices and when the fish flakes they are ready to take off the grille.. Very easy to make and you can take bread and soak up the remaining juices for a marinade sandwich.. YUMMY!!"
6070665,stjoeguy,2018-03-19 11:54:00,979,"Sounds good, Bill. I think we've found us a new potatoes and onions cook!!"
6070897,123chadder,2018-03-19 14:09:00,429,"add sliced tomato...it makes the dish....i dont think a marinade is needed,fresh garlic,butter and/or olive oil,onion,green pepper,tomato,parsley.....dill is awesome to add,especially fresh,if i have parm ill sprinkle some on....it always turns out great....but the tomato really kicks it up,i always put a bit of sugar on the tomato to cut the acidity"
6072809,wmd,2018-03-20 10:00:00,388,Aww crap........ shoulda kept my mouth closed [ or fingers still] wmd
6076209,brett13,2018-03-21 13:44:00,51,"we do our big meal of the day over the noon hour (12-3) we keep it pretty easy. we fry fish 3 days, surf and turf one day, brats one day, burgers one day and frozen pizzas one day. At night when we return from fishing we usually do sandwiches, and some sort of soup/stew"
6078969,123chadder,2018-03-22 14:44:00,429,anyone ever do fish tacos?
6079017,Ricky Spanish,2018-03-22 15:15:00,1298,"I do. I always bring a bag of coleslaw mix, tortillas, and different hot sauces. I use hot sauce to wet the fillets before dredging in breading. Fry them up, toss onto a tortilla, top with coleslaw mix, more hot sauce, and what ever else trips your trigger. It's a nice change to the usual shore lunch menu."
6080353,kona77,2018-03-23 10:21:00,236,"We always have one evening meal with fish taco's. Will bring up some shredded cabbage, various sweet peppers, onions, shredded cheese and use the various marinades I mentioned in an earlier post that we use to make ""fish in foil"". Will also have some jalapeno peppers for anyone wanting a hotter taco. We just use regular fried fish from our fish cooker and place all the fixin's in a 8"" soft tortilla wrap. Always a nice change of pace from a regular fish fry."
6081465,Live to jig,2018-03-23 19:03:00,159,All this talk of Walleye Tacos is killing me!!! These were last year pics A couple of cabins come together for taco night...they only have to bring their own cooked fish..lots of worm dirt on those fingers!!
6043913,MrPlumber,2018-03-06 13:43:00,80,"I just have to chuckle as I think about what we take camping and fishing. In the spring they get detailed full breakfast, hot dogs and burgers for lunch, steak and spuds for dinner. By fall time we are having oatmeal, sandwiches , and burgers and chips.Also nothing wrong with a frozen pizza in the oven or dutch oven.Easy and fast is good for me. Oh and do not forget to pack a few adult beverages for the campfire."
6044033,Aspencreek,2018-03-06 14:27:00,2911,"Oh now that is just sad, you know if you offer to bring along the adult beverages I'd bet he would share, or at least give you a taste and the recipe so you could do your own. That is unless you could be one of those contestants on ""Worst Cooks in America""."

6031537,Mojo-NC,2018-02-28 11:50:00,1929,"Wow, some of you guys eat really well! I'm envious. We all fly up so we can't prepare anything in advance. We pick up groceries in International Falls before we cross the border. We put together a grocery list that is based on the menu that we all agreed upon before we leave. We have mostly standard stuff with steaks one night, a fish fry one night, burgers one night, etc. Our only unique meal is on Wednesday. We all keep a northern pike or two earlier in the week and use it for a fish boil that was introduced to us by our friends from Michigan. We boil some red potatoes with onions, and add the fish chunks about 10 minutes before serving. We serve it all with drawn butter. It is pretty simple but so good - we call it the poor man's lobster."
6031929,KSjim,2018-02-28 15:10:00,88,"We also boil fish, usually walleye, and serve with melted butter. We throw a crab boil bag in the pot. Serve it as surf and turf one night with steak and serve it with fried blackened walleye one night as well. If we happen to have any leftover we have been known to make a walleye omelet with it the next morning."
6035673,neldog257,2018-03-02 13:58:00,16,"A very simple appetizer our group really enjoys is what we call poor man's lobster. Chunk walleye back-straps, drop chunks into boiling water for approximately 2 mins., use colander spoon to remove chunks, and immediately drop fish chunks into water with ice. Once fish has cooled, drain water and enjoy with a little lemon or cocktail sauce. It is very important to keep the water at full boil while cooking the fish and after a few minutes to immediately drop chunks into ice water....need to shock the boiled fish. Firms them up nicely."
6035689,btyreprich,2018-03-02 14:01:00,1067,Do you salt the water for the poor man's lobster?
6035705,Mojo-NC,2018-03-02 14:15:00,1929,"Yes, we add 1/4 cup of salt per gallon of water for the fish boil/poor man's lobster."

6035777,123chadder,2018-03-02 14:53:00,429,try poaching the cubed pike/walleye in sprite or 7up.....so much better!
6035785,123chadder,2018-03-02 14:55:00,429,a lot of places dont have electricity for crockpots......but an oven and covered casserole dish works just as good
6035865,packpro,2018-03-02 15:58:00,695,"Our goals for dinner are; Good food, in the least amount of time, Quick clean up. With that in mind. Most of the cooking is done on the BBQ. Steaks, Pork chops, quick chicken, Pulled Pork, Flank steak, Baked Potatoes, Lasagna, pan of enchiladas, pan of cheezy potatoes, garlic bread. We also have a brats, sausage, and burger night. Everything can be cooked in 15-20 minutes on the grill. Most of it is premade, frozen, and reheated to serving temperature. Steaks Seasoned with garlic, sea salt, little bit of rosemary, and finished with a butter pat. Grilled to orderPorkchops seasoned with garlic salt, paprika, dry mustard, poultry seasoning, black pepper. BBQ sauce for those who choose it.Pulled pork. Premade and vaccuum packed reheated.- really easyQuick chicken. 4 Costco $5.00 chickens. Cut in pieces and vacuumed sealed. Place in a aluminum roasting pan, pour in a can of chicken broth cover with foil and steam to heat. Keeps the already cooked chicken moist. This is the easiest and cheapest meal. Everyone loves it. Feeds 8 guys for $20 Flank steak- seasoned with ginger paste and soy. 5 minutes each side done. Or we season it with garlic and black pepper. Grill onion and char a few green/red peppers. 10 minute fajitas with homemade guacamole.Guacamole- advocados-onion, lime, cilantro, garlic salt and jalepeno to taste. Quick and easy steak tacosThe lasagna, enchilada, and pulled pork, cheesy potatoes are made in advance, frozen and vacuum sealed. We use aluminum catering pan to reheat. Burgers are premade with onion celery and garlic salt. Brats grilled and floating in beer and onion bath. Sausage served with pepper, onions, and melted mozzarella. We try to use simple food and dress it up a bit. It would be easy to a have a sophisticated menu, but our group will not sacrifice fishing time, or we are just plain tired at dinner time. The shore lunch is the featured meal so dinner is not extreme. Your vacuum sealer and Sams/Costco are your friend."
6043841,Mr Ranger,2018-03-06 13:10:00,272,I can attest to this as we are always in the cabin next to theirs. All four of us sit by his garbage can looking for scraps
6028497,Live to jig,2018-02-26 21:43:00,159,"I just finished ours for this year, I prep some and make some there. I have to say cooking is the 2nd best thing for me after fishing!! I haven't had any complaints yet....."
6028801,Pooch,2018-02-27 06:11:00,4618,"Holy crap, you guys eat better than we do on trips! We eat well, but nothing like many of your groups do!!One big meal a day at 1PM. Fish every other day. Odd days are burgers or something we made at home and brought along frozen then warmed up. We try to throw in a couple warm breakfasts during the trip. Cold cuts, grilled cheese or popcorn at bedtime or after the evening fishing.Everyone brings junk food to share and boat snacks. Home made cookies are always a hit. We never seem to go hungry.Couple guys bring a little hard liquor for sipping before lights out. Not much beer drinkin' for this group anymore. Outgrew that many years ago. We go to fish.Interesting to read what others are doing about food.Pooch"
6029425,mjayn,2018-02-27 11:02:00,1188,"This is what we do. A few guys can't cook, a few guys can, so out of 8 guys we usually bring 4-6 meals and eat fish a couple of nights. We are not into having big time consuming meals, a shore lunch once or twice during the week otherwise its pretty much fish dawn until dusk. With some sleep in days or mid day naps(if the fish bite early). If sleep wasn't an issue we would all fish dawn to dusk, but with those long canada days in summer, you have to sleep sometime, but you don't have to eat."

Kids have asked for a couple of adjustments but not much.Lunch is usually sandwiches in the boat or a on shore some place to let the kids explore. Eventually will get back to shore lunch when they can contribute to the tasks. Only meal that has a set date is Spaghetti.

Someone cleans fish, someone starts grill, someone unpacks and restocks the shore lunch kit. We always rotate who is on dishes.Did have one guy went with that chose not to do dishes or pitch in much. We chose not to invite him again."
6030337,Live to jig,2018-02-27 20:38:00,159,"I keep my meal prep to 1/2 hour or less, usually my brother is cleaning the catch while prep the meal, I have the Prime Rib precooked and just slice and throw on the grill, and soon after a big dinner back on the lake for the night bite till almost dark. we are always the last boat in. The Bisc doughnuts are just canned bisc. Poke a hole in the middle deep fry up and drop in a bag of cinn sugar. My favorite is Orange Walleye, my version of Orange chicken over rice....**** good!"

6030793,prov1900,2018-02-28 06:54:00,544,There have been some great ideas thrown in this thread. I will be definitely be making some changes to the old tired menu!
6031337,wmd,2018-02-28 10:33:00,388,"We keep our trip in the fall pretty basic. Breakfast is eggs, bacon or sausage, toast and we have pancakes once or twice. We have shore lunch 4-5 days, weather permitting, otherwise sandwiches. Evening meals are always done on a grill so we have burgers, pork tenderloin, chicken, steak and usually potatoes and onions sliced and cooked in aluminum foil on the grill. All meals are eaten on paper plates and plastic utensils as we decided long ago we go up to fish not do dishes, clean up is easy and takes very little time. Its not for everybody but to works for us. wmd"
6026273,pale ryder,2018-02-25 18:26:00,1937,My favorite is to have each member of the group cook 1 or 2 meals. They bring everything to make them. I view it as a competition.
6026609,dschiebel,2018-02-26 01:50:00,85,"We are limited to about 70lbs per person on our fly in. After the beer usually have about 6 lbs per person left. Whisky 2 pounds, that leaves 4 lbs. We eat fish all the time . One meal 2 hotdogs per person., but we never run out of beer."
6026921,Aspencreek,2018-02-26 07:10:00,2911,"Our group usually consists of 6 guys, I do all the cooking and purchasing. We will do 2 -3 fish fries at night in the turkey frier during the week, the rest of the meals are spaghetti, grilled chicken, grilled steaks, grilled pork chops, and smoked pork shoulder (predone and bagged). We have a good lunch during the day, usually brats, burgers or chicken breasts on a propane grill that packs into the boat. Takes about 2 minutes to set up and lunch is done in 15 minutes, but fishing from shore and of course the visits to mother nature makes the stop about an hour. Dinner is at 6-7pm and if someone wants to go out after.......go ahead. As you can see most of the cooking is done outside so the dish factor/cooking smell is decreased and we can all enjoy the late afternoon, early evening with a cold one. I noticed a very early comment about him being on vacation. We have had a couple of those guys come along, all they were interested in doing was drinking beer. Did no other chores (dishes, meal prep, pick up or take out garbage, clean fish, etc.) My question to them was simple, why did you come along with us to do that? You could have gone to a hotel close to home, told your wife you were going to Canada, and spent half as much and still drank all the Miller you could. Those guys don't come along or are invited anymore, everybody with the exception of my 92 yr old uncle have a job to do. His job is to keep the rest of us in line and tell great war stories."
6026945,maddogg,2018-02-26 07:30:00,178,Trips to Canada are to short and to few to be hungover every day. I can drink at home.

We also have had guys come along that were there to enjoy themselves while not doing anything to further everyone else's experience. Good friends at the time, but for the life of me I can't seem to remember their names Things that will not get you invited back in no particular order: 1. Complain about cost 2. Complain about menu 3. Complain about fishing 4. Talk too much about work 5. Not lift a finger"

When the group was bigger we did turkeys, ham, all the fixins...was very good but felt we spent more time cooking, eating and cleaning up then we did fishing. We dont have set times for dinner or breakfast anymore. Do what ya want basically but our group is like 4 guys now so thats easy to do."
6027121,camp chef,2018-02-26 08:54:00,915,"Unlike most groups we(4 this year) have fish grilled once or twice during the week. Our meals include, Venison burgers twice,venison hot dogs,Italian sausage and peppers over pasta, BBQ chicken halves slow cooked and basted with sauce at least 6 times, venison tenderloins and grilled Jumbo shrimp, Aged New York strips,Pork loin and Kraut,Philly cheese steak brats, deli meat sandwiches for day trips in the boat. I do all the cooking and cleanup chores are shared by the others. We now do everything on good quality paper plates to minimize dishes."
6027169,Aspencreek,2018-02-26 09:16:00,2911,I love your list.
6027865,adempsey2.0,2018-02-26 15:41:00,612,"As much as I like to experiment with food and recipes, I find if your group becomes more than 4 you can usually forget about doing that as there is always someone who doesn't like something. Which is completely fine and, in my experience, they will usually just opt out of that dinner and eat a burger or dog instead. However, I just can't get myself to make something that everyone doesn't want to eat. So, I stick to things everyone will enjoy. That usually means as much on the BBQ as possible - burgers, steaks, sausages and then usually a pasta with meat sauce or a baked pasta dish, or fajitas/taco's if everyone is OK with it.Otherwise, I would consider bringing butter chicken, paella, cabbage rolls, moroccan chicken, green curry, pad thai......Campchef, I'd like to hear more about those Philly cheese steak brats!"
6027881,camp chef,2018-02-26 15:51:00,915,"It is a new flavor this spring.Made by my local butcher. provolone cheese,onions and green pepper in the casing with brat seasoning and pork,beef mix. I haven't tried them yet...His other flavors are all excellent."
6025057,prov1900,2018-02-25 09:09:00,544,"Reading the Canada routine thread and the shorelunch sides thread (both awesome reads btw), it got me thinking about our menu. I'm the one in the group that is in charge of the menu for the week and do most of the cooking, but I am always looking for new ideas. We generally have one night that is a dedicated fish fry, but ""try"" to eat fish every night. We will keep about one or two small walleyes to be used as an appetizer. Blackened, grilled, and fried is usually the three ways we make them. We have gone to Canada for lots of years now and it used to be all about eating fish all week long and making sure we took home our limits. Now I can't even remember the last time I took home any fish because Canada is something so much more to me than the harvest. CPR has been the mainstay. So outside of fish, we have made the following dinners over the years - Prime Rib Shrimp Chili Tater Tot Casserole Burgers/brats/dogs (every trip and usually first night) Ham Wings (every trip unless there is a ban on chicken) Steaks Jambalaya Gumbo ETC Does anyone do anything different? I'm always looking for good hearty meals, but the older I get, I'm always thinking about something healthier. We have added some sort of veggie dish/lettuce salad to each dinner to break it up a little. We used to do hot breakfasts daily, but those have been eliminated by 50%. Lunches are always in the boat consisting of sandwiches/etc."
6025249,kona77,2018-02-25 10:56:00,236,"We always plan for two different meals on our 7-day trips. I always pre-make some larger meatballs (cut them in half) and freeze them with the spaghetti sauce (gallon bags). Use these as large ice packs for the drive up. Our 2nd last night is always steak night and I will make egg noodles with gravy as a substitute for potatoes. Will also bring up garlic bread for spaghetti night. We mix the fish up by having fish taco's one night (shredded cabbage, cheese, jalapeno's, red peppers. diced tomatoes and different salad dressings for toppings). One other night we will take the thicker parts of the fillets and wrap in bacon and make them on the grille.. Best scallops imitation I can think of..They are delicious!! We have fried fish other nights and always have a big shore lunch later on our last day.Always have a big breakfast and will alternate between eggs, sausage, ham, bacon and pancakes. One of the guys in the group makes his own maple syrup (tapped trees yesterday) and that is a treat. Will scramble the eggs ahead of time and freeze in quart bags (12-18 eggs a bag) and they also make good ice packs for the drive up. Leftovers from a spiral ham is what I use for the ham. Lunch and sandwiches is a mix of brats, home made venison sausage and polish sausage. Will also take a container of peanut butter and home made berry jams. Will also bring up a few packages of misc. cookies (our deserts) and some pretzels/potato chips. Will make brownies and one other bar type desert to cap off steak/spaghetti nights. We eat like kings and nothing beats sitting on the dock at night catching walleye's and sipping 15-18 year old scotch."

Probably one of my favorite things to do, fishing wise. I like your idea of the frozen scrambled eggs. Do you boil them in the bag? Or thaw? Either way that would save on space in the coolers."
6025353,kona77,2018-02-25 11:29:00,236,ProvoWe let the eggs thaw out in fridge the day before we use. Just throw in the frying pan with whatever we are making with them. Easy breakfastHere are some pictures from last year. Outfitter supplies minnows so all that smell by the dock really draws in the walleye's at night. Had a couple of full moon nights last year. We also pack a small Bose speaker and hook up our Ipod's for some great music at night..(Pink Floyd under a full moon with walleye or scotch in hand is hard to beat)

6025481,BreezyPoint,2018-02-25 12:25:00,1581,"We like to have a big meal every day at mid day. To make our eating easier, we prepare a few meals in advance, freeze them and just have to thaw out and heat up. Some of the items we do this with are:Hickory smoked pork tenderloinHickory smoked bbq chicken thighsWe have a couple of walleye dinnersOne day we have some really nice steaksTo fill things out we just do simple things like burgers and brats We cook most of our food on the camp grill unless it is pre-prepared.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6025489,turkeyriver,2018-02-25 12:30:00,80,"My BIL does most of the cooking outside of the fish. Last year he found these seasoned pork roasts, can't remember the brand, that are vacuum sealed. He froze one and let it thaw out for aday before cooking it on the grill one day. Nice change of pace for breakfast and the leftovers make great boat sandwiches."
6025697,btyreprich,2018-02-25 14:00:00,1067,"Here are a few items I always buy for the trip: Pork chops - wrap in bacon and after the grill marks are on the chops, place in aluminum foil so they don't dry out. Stuffing, corn, and a salad. Pork tenderloin that has been seasoned with Montreal Steak Seasoning and then wrapped in bacon. Italian bread to do in olive oil, salad or corn on the cob. Flank steak to make fajitas. Lots of Mexican rice on the side. Chips and salsa too. Last year I bought two Costco chickens from the rotisserie display and when I got home I cut each bird in half and froze them. Easy to reheat, delicious, and quite affordable. Serve with bread and corn on the cob. Spaghetti with meat balls, garlic bread, and tomatoes with soft / Buffalo mozzarella cheese. Pour olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette over the cheese. There is an Italian grocery store in our area that sells whole beef tenderloin / fillet mignon on sale at $6.99 a lb. season with Montreal Seasoning and wrap in bacon. Favorite meal of the week. Burgers / brats / corn on th cob. Local farmer has well white sweet corn which is very sweet. We like to eat well on the trip and if I shop the sales a good month or more before we leave I can take advantage of some great prices in like 8 sales papers. Our group likes shore lunch on the lake and we have fish at least 4 times. I know people say that takes too much time away from fishing and that can be true. However all 4 people help out in preparing the site & cooking so its not too bad."
6025793,DaBirdman,2018-02-25 14:26:00,164,"Our 7-day/night stay we (5 families) do these meals/dinners: Night 1: tacos (easy, pre-made taco meat) Night 2: BBQ ribs on the grill Night 3: fish Night 4: burgers & brats Night 5: fish Night 6: ribeyes Night 7: leftovers Our first night meal is quick & easy because of checking in, un-packing, some fishing, etc. Once settled in for the remainder of the week we break out the grill food. We also do a couple big family breakfasts where one morning it'll be eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, cakes. Another morning eggbake. All other breakfasts & lunches are on our own since we all do our own family things during the day (mostly)."
6026057,Baseline,2018-02-25 16:27:00,3207,"These meals can be made in advance and easily prepared by warming up. Spagetti sauce and meatballs - Boil up pasta. Open a Salad Complete bag or two Dinner ready in 20 minutes. Lasagna - Warm up for 30 mins This is a good meal for arrival day when you get into camp late. Chili Dogs. Boil hot dogs, can of Hormel, chopped onions and condiments, chips and buns."
