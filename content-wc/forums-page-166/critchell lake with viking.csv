I strongly recommend them. Red Lake has a few different hotel options. The Super 8 is the newest option so I usually stay there plus they have a Tim Hortons in the parking lot which is easy in the am. I preorder bait from TJ Kwik stop. If you have any other specific questions feel free to PM me.Thanks,B-"
