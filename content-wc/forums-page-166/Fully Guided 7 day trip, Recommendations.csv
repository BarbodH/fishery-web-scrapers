6083761,martinbns,2018-03-24 22:59:00,1520,Thompson is more like 900 km north of Winnipeg.
6084217,Obabikon,2018-03-25 08:11:00,2370,No problem at all. Ice is certainly going to be late this year. I'm going to guess our area will be out around May 9th. Which is VERY close to late records.
6084953,MidWestFishman,2018-03-25 13:26:00,44,"I have stayed as a single fisherman at lodge 88 on Esnagi Lake a few years ago. I wasn't charged extra, and had a guide. As I recall his name was Bob and he was a great guide. Outstanding facilities and meals and the fishing was very, very good. It was well below your price range and is worth a look. It was a great value"

6082785,bthomas3333,2018-03-24 11:31:00,465,Hey - That is a tough price point esp if you are planning to fish alone. I have looked for the exact same thing and the best I could do was closer to $4000 without an uncharge for being alone. One place that does fit the bill is Dunlop's Fly-in Lodge. It is under $3000 / Fly in / Guided / and he has a cabin for guys fishing alone. The issue is he flies out of Thompson MB. That is around 500km north of Winnipeg. So you either need to add a day to drive up / back or fly up which adds about $500 or so and then you are over your 3k target. If you find a good options please post back where you decided to go.
