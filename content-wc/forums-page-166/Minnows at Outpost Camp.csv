I believe the last I read in the last regulation ""encyclopedic booklet"" was that the use of offal (waste parts of fish) for bait was legal. I'd want to look again before use. They do really, really work, used to use them all the time in Sask. Pooch - At least you didn't call me Geezer Bill, uncle is good!! Bill"

6096465,BigRedSmokey,2018-03-30 07:38:00,13,"After reading thru all the posts on WC about salted minnows I've narrowed down to getting salted minnows from www.magicproducts.com or www.minnesotabaitandtackle.com. From what I've read and researched, MBT is a little less expensive, but they are smaller and some have had issues with them being too mushy. I'm leaning towards magic products. Has anyone used both that could weigh in? If buying from magic products, would you get shiners or fatheads? What size? Thanks!"

In the video clip I watched, he caught several nice walleyes without losing the chunk of rind. If a guy bought some cheap off-brand bacon with plenty of fat, you might think you would have enough bait for a week. But I guess I'm skeptical. Anybody ever try this? You could spend $5-10 bucks for a few pounds of off-brand bacon, and save a ton of money on bait."
6038177,Pooch,2018-03-04 08:28:00,4618,"Listen to Uncle Bill!Sandwich sized ziplocks. Ten minnows in each bag. Never frozen, just kept in the cooler. Take whatever number of bags with you each time you leave the dock, but still keep them in a cooler in the boat.Easier to count if challenged at the border.(You noticed that I didn't say grandpa Bill, didn't you Bill?)Pooch"
6040161,Aspencreek,2018-03-05 06:42:00,2911,"I also purchased some of the Magicproduct minnows a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised. They are easy to get on the hook and don't get mushy. Come in a resealable package, but I do keep them in a cooler after opening. I'm sure they are more expensive than salting/Borax etc. but I've tried to do it myself, but with the whole process and mess I still screwed it up somehow so they all went bad anyway. So it's magicproducts and crawlers and leeches. I use a small cooler for crawler storage and a 1/2 gallon milk jug for the leeches, just change the water regularly, keep them in a cooler and they will go all week."
6041969,jkaup,2018-03-05 18:58:00,56,I didn't read all the posts so sorry if this was mentioned. I bought a bait tamer floating mesh bag. It really works great at keeping them alive. You probably want to sink it or keep it in the shade later in the season. All this is assuming you arrived with some live minnows. You loose some each day but we just use those first or salt and sometimes freeze them.
6042113,tandm,2018-03-05 19:55:00,679,"I take salted minnows and live nightcrawlers. I try to take freshly salted minnows, but as long as I keep them cool, they work as well as live. I put two dozen in a sandwich bag to dry them and wipe the salt off before putting them in the boat. that eliminates spilled salt in the boat. As for the nightcrawlers, I have started putting a day's worth in ice water, as per an earlier thread here on WC. End result, other than fish blood and slime, no mess in the boat."
6042745,The tank,2018-03-06 06:44:00,340,when we took minnows on a fly in we made sure we got them from a place that filled the bag with oxygen and put the bag in something so they don't get warm. once we landed we put minnows in 2- 5 gallon buckets with battery operated tiny bubble pumps. change water every day and never had many dead ones. worked for us. the tiny bubble pumps are like $8 a piece.
6043681,prov1800,2018-03-06 11:53:00,5010,I don't understand why anybody would spend good money on a fly out and then cheap out on bait for your trip of a lifetime.beyond me.theres always room for minnows.most important part of the trip.sure you can catch them on artificial up on a fly out lake but you get weather and systems up there to.then there's nothing like a fresh lively minnow.if you run out the next best thing to use is walleye gullet .no salting involved.take the gullets out of the fish you eat.one gullet will last you all day.they do not come off.keep a few in the freezer.they do dry up if left out of the water.except maybe to losing them to pike a couple a day will be entry a redebly available.totally legal.
6043721,tandm,2018-03-06 12:15:00,679,"Walleye gullets are considered part of a game fish. Using all or part of a gamefish for bail is totally illegal in Canada. Can you get away with it? Maybe , but a trip of a lifetime could go south real quick when the conservation officers surprise you. I was even checked one time when they came over the trees and dropped in beside my boat. Just because you are on a remote lake doesn't mean you are not accessible."
6043769,CI_Guy,2018-03-06 12:45:00,2118,"The laws may have changed, but I asked a CO about walleye gullets probably 30 years ago and was told it was illegal to use them because they were part of a game fish. Since then I've had a few outfitters say it was illegal when they would give their condensed version of the rules."

You can freeze them and as long as there kept moist they last.whatever you do don't let them dry out on your hook or you'll be sorry.lol."
6046497,leachmin&worm,2018-03-07 16:05:00,32,"Just an FYI. In the last couple off years I've been using A Frabill Aerater on outposts and drive ups for live minnows. It works fantastic. I couldn't believe it myself but I have kept the same dozen minnows alive with the aerater for a week. The trick is to throw in a frozen bottle of water every shift you go out on the water and for over night.The pair of ""D"" Duracell batteries run for 4 solid days, then just replace and keep going. I load up the container with minnows and have very few go belly up on me by days end. Keeping them cold is the trick. Warm water kills. Haven't used frozen or artificial since. Hope this helps."

6035449,BornToFish,2018-03-02 11:31:00,1224,"Greetings,This post is in response to Andreindy. I mentioned that I took salted fatheads to one particular lake. The water was fairly clear (i.e. not stained). The salted fatheads worked fairly well for us, but not as well as live minnows. The forage base in that particular lake was various species of small and dark minnows, in marked contrast to a typical shiner minnow.I took these same salted fatheads to a lake with moderately stained water. The forage base in this particular lake was dominated by emerald shiners and spot-tails (they look like an emerald shiner). Selling a salted fathead was a tough push - they didn't work all that well. We quickly switched to leeches and crawlers and did very well.In the next season, I switched to salted emerald shiners (2-3 inches in length) and they worked great! In fact, the bigger the better! I surmised that the walleyes were accustomed to looking for a particular kind of minnow and were uncertain what they should do with a strange looking minnow.In response to the post by Andreindy, see if you can find out what kind of minnows make up the forage base in the lake that you will be fishing and try to match the hatch. As I mentioned, I would get fairly big minnows and salt them. Conduct a search for the thread by FishOil under the Canada forum. There are several good recipes in this thread.If you can't find out about the lake, I suggest taking some of each (fatheads and emerald shiners) and see what works best so that you know for future trips.

Took 1/2 flat of crawlers in because we were a little nervous that they would actually keep the minnows in stock. No problem. The bite was so crazy that we each took a wet rag and dumped 10 or 20 at a time wrapped up on the seat next to us. Didn't matter that they died. Even stinky dead ones, as long as they would stay on the hook worked fine. Clark's stock the cabin with bottled water, and deliver ice, as much as you want, when they deliver minnows. The generator for our cabin went on the fritz, called base on Sat. phone and had a new one in a couple of hours. We will be going out with them again this year/"

6036793,kona77,2018-03-03 07:39:00,236,"Our group has also been using the Clarks for the last 6 years and the free minnows are a nice bonus to their services. When we get on a real hot bite we just switch over to plastics to save the time of re-baiting minnows.We always end our days by fishing right off the docks and will throw out some of the dead minnows (our version of chumming).. Really cool to see the walleyes come up to the surface to take the minnows..Can them catch them on floating rapala's or using our lightest jigs tipped with more dead minnows. Prior to hooking up with the Clarks we would always take a flat of crawlers to Canada and use them as our ""searching"" bait. Would then switch to plastics when we found active fish. Have seen a lot of positive comments about salted minnows and their use/care. Certainly a great option at an affordable price. We still take a few dozen crawlers just to cover water with our bottom bouncers and worm harness set-up's"
6037873,Bill Krejca,2018-03-04 06:24:00,6107,"Ha! The rest of the story is that I had done the frozen route a number of times over the years before finally realizing that freezing does cause mush upon thawing, I guess I'm a slow learner!! Now when I count the minnows, I place them in small bags and write the number in the bag, on the bag, using a marker. Bill"
6033473,prov1800,2018-03-01 14:00:00,5010,Not sure where you booked or if you have or not.if not check out Clarke's outposts and resort.great flyins and they bring fresh minnows in by plane every two days.most baits will work on the flyouts but there's nothing like fresh lively bait to kick it up another notch.especially later in summer when fish go deeper there's nothing better than live.and it's free in the package.cant get any better than that.bring all your electronics ad each outpost has a quiete running generator.use your Capps and charge up batteries.
6033545,Pooch,2018-03-01 14:19:00,4618,"Frozen solid minnows are junk. Salt them or buy them salted, but not frozen. Keep them in the fridge. Freezing destroys the muscle structure of the minnow and they turn to mush when thawed. The moisture in the minnow expands when frozen turning muscle and organs into a paste like consistency.Sometimes the very salty minnows have enough salt in and on them that they actually do not freeze solid. These don't work out too bad, but it is a moving target and not worth the risk on a remote trip.On a remote trip, crawlers or leeches are the best bet. Crawlers are far cheaper than leeches, but keeping them cool all the time can be a challenge. Leeches also have to be kept cool to cold. Salted minnows are also nearly as good as and sometimes better than live.Keeping good live bait healthy is a ""science"" in itself. It takes some TLC, but is worth the effort.Have a good trip.Pooch"
6033641,neldog257,2018-03-01 14:59:00,16,"Our group has been using salted minnows for 20 plus years with great success. After salting the live minnows with canning salt and draining the liquid, we then put the minnows (Minus all liquid)l into a doubled up paper bag with fresh canning salt. Don't be shy about using a lot of salt. Keep the bag in the refrigerator and grab what you need each day. Minnows stay firm and easily last 6-7 days. No freezing, just keep cool. (refrigerator or ice in boat cooler) Our group uses zip lock bags to hold the salted minnows while out fishing , but at the end of the day the unused minnows are taken out of the zip locks and put back into the paper bag."

It seems that some folks were having their salted minnows either confiscated or folks were turned around in order to dump them on the US side. Prior to that, the only regulation was limiting salted minnows to 10 dozen per person. Not sure if salted minnows are still allowed going in to Canada. Anyone thinking about bringing them over the border may want to check into that aspect. PjShorthorn"
6034225,valley366,2018-03-01 18:01:00,193,I have heard of people buying minnows just before crossing the border and salting them.

That is a problem.I have been asked each year what type of minnows I have and how long they have been frozen. I have brought shiners and fat heads without issue.

Most of these were dead by the time we arrived at the outpost. We used these during the first few days of the trip. They still worked great as long as we kept them cold.

The walleyes readily accepted these salted fatheads. I caught a lot of walleyes with these minnows.I tried these same salted fatheads on another lake that has shiner and spot-tail minnows as its forage base. It was a tough sell to peddle a salted fathead to walleyes in this lake as they were accustomed to long and shiny shiner minnows. I since switched to salted emerald shiners and they work great!I've found that frozen minnows work very well on the lakes that I am now fishing.

6033401,KSjim,2018-03-01 13:33:00,88,"On our fly-ins depending on the outfitter and location of the lake we have used live, salted and frozen minnows. We prefer live and have taken in as many as 40 dozen. As soon as we arrive at the outpost we make it a priority to transfer them to a couple 5 gallon Lindy Bait Tamers to keep them in. The dead ones we put in a bag with some salt and put them in the freezer. If you put a rock in the bait tamers and sink them at least six feet under the surface the minnows seem to do fine. Salted minnows are a very close second. In most cases we have found they work as well as live and are much easier to manage. Actually, as our group is getting older, we are considering using salted even when live is an option. Last year the outfitter we used only supplied frozen. To keep things simple we decided to use him to get our minnows from. Never again for our group! As soon as they began to thaw we had very little luck keeping them on the hook. Maybe we got a bad batch. The outfitter told us he gets very few complaints on them. But the experience we had really soured our group on frozen."
