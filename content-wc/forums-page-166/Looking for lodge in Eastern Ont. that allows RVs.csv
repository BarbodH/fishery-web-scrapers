3287306,MrSimon,2014-11-05 14:22:00,922,"I'm looking for a lodge/campground on a nice lake in Eastern Ontario that has RV spots. Some of our criteria:Scenic lake without too many houses or lodges - we like lots of islands, bays, etc.Basic hookups for an RVBoat rentals would be niceMust be at lease decent fishing for walleye, pike, smallies .... or largemouth, crappie, etc - we aren't picky as long as something is bitingWithin four or five hours of the Thousand Islands Bridge"
3287634,fishron,2014-11-05 17:54:00,317,"Years ago I fished a resort that went by the name of Laurentian View. Indeed across the Ottawa river, in Quebec, were the Laurentian Mountains. Today it's called Spotswood landing, after the gentleman Lorne Spotswood who I met many years ago. Although its not a lake, being on the Ottawa river, its a very nice RV campground with great fishing potential. Some of the fishing area is very much river and other areas are very much lake. Lorne has a vast experience with the area. Take a look at his site or give him a call."

3297666,mickr,2014-11-10 12:14:00,74,"been to both locations several times morning mist is more remote, the walleye fishing in particular is much better and it is within your 5 hour limit from the bridge."
3301114,haybay larry,2014-11-12 05:37:00,136,"The Bay Of Quinte is a world renowned spot for Walleye, Bass, Pike, crappies. If you want to venture out to Lake Ontario-Trout, salmon, as well.Go to the Quinte Fishing web site and check out the lodges etc. It is about 1 1/2 hours from the thousand islands border crossing @ interstate 81.Walleye that get to 15-18 lbs. in the Fall lots of smaller ones year round. As my name suggests some of the resorts are in Hay Bay, about 10 miles long with average depth of about 10'. Many, many, walleye."
6094761,MrSimon,2018-03-29 11:51:00,922,"Wanted to bring this back around, but increase the distance a bit. Where would be a good place to go in a motorhome that offers a peaceful and scenic location to spend a week. Let's say all of Ontario and Quebec are fair game. Same requirements as above .... solid fishing and basic amenities."
