The key is to tie up both sides of the back of the boat, and get the transom above water so it isn't just pouring in. That said, if it is facing away from the waves, you would need 3""+ of rain without bailing to sink a decent sized boat."
6105306,JesPet,2018-04-02 13:21:00,1,"if the weather is real bad you may wanna take it out. many larger lakes will 'fill up' areas with strong winds, (water level can rise as much as a foot) and if the dock is anchored you will likely pull the cleats off the dock or boat. worse the boat could end up on the dock and get a nasty rash. pointing the boat into the wind is always a good idea"
6108138,muskyman73,2018-04-03 18:46:00,401,"I have my auto bilge on and that is for a reason. But then again, after what happened last year..........my god our dock got tore off the island like a band aid. When mother nature does what she feels like, it doesn't matter what you do."
6108162,Obabikon,2018-04-03 18:49:00,2370,"Remember the year that the retaining wall got blasted apart? And the year we wouldn't let you leave until late? And the dock getting ripped off... come to think of it, might have to stop inviting you guys back! hahaha!"
6108226,mudpusher,2018-04-03 19:23:00,248,a few years ago we had a leaf get stuck under the float of an auto bilge pump. kept trying to pump with no water. burnt the pump up and melted the wires. almost lost the boat.
6109450,Bakefish,2018-04-04 10:02:00,1077,"For that reason, sunflower seeds are not allowed in my boat."
6109490,Doublelung76,2018-04-04 10:13:00,42,"exactly,I'm always cleaning out my bilge of sunflower seeds from my teenage son,why don't teens just chew skoal like we did back in the day!hahaha"
6109498,BornToFish,2018-04-04 10:14:00,1224,"Greetings,The post by Bakefish about not allowing sun-flower seeds is a good one. Walking down to the dock with a bag of sunflower seeds is a sure-fire way to get many lodge owners nervous.I know of a similar situation involving a short piece of monofilament fishing line burning out an automatic bilge pump. Along these lines (pardon the pun), I am aware of several lodge owners that periodically disassemble the bilge pumps in their boats throughout the season to remove pieces of fishing line that get wrapped around the impellor. The fishing line eventually collects on the impellor shaft which binds the pump, resulting in a trashed bilge pump.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6096289,turkeyriver,2018-03-30 06:51:00,80,"Last year on our fly-in we had a lot of storms and wind overnight. Our outfitter always tells us to pull the boats completely out of the water overnight. The ramps at outposts aren't always the easiest to pull boats up on. My ? is this. If a boat is tied up to the dock , bow facing the lake, how likely is it to be a problem? How hard would it have to rain to sink a boat? What if the boat is tied sideways? I know stern toward the lake could be bad! What do most of you do? Don't say just watch the weather, it seems like storms come up awfully quick the further north you go. We pulled boats up on the slippery log ramps in the dark with a storm bearing down once and it wasn't fun."
6096401,Mojo-NC,2018-03-30 07:30:00,1929,"We helped our camp pull all of the boats out of the water one day a few years ago before a storm packing gale force winds arrived. We took the day off of fishing and drove up to Red Lake for the day. Otherwise for ""normal"" storms, we leave them in the water and bail them out the next morning."
6096457,Bakefish,2018-03-30 07:38:00,1077,"I was awoken one night in Canada at about 3 a.m. by someone pounding on our cabin door. I ran to the door, not knowing what in the heck was going on. Fortunately for me our neighbor had been woken by the storm that was raging at the time. He yelled over the howling wind that my boat had come loose from the dock and had blown up on the rocks. Talk about a wake up call. I hastily got some clothes on and ran out onto the rain slicked dock. The bow of my boat was actually inches from the rocks as the skeg had stuck in the sand and was holding it in place. It was a ***** turning the boat around so I could again point it into the wind before retying it to the dock. The wind had to be over 50 mph and the rain, while not real heavy, was punishing with a 50 mph wind behind it. The bay was protected from the heaviest of the waves, but it wrapped around the point giving the dock its full force. I finally got boat tied up, this time correctly, and made my way back to the cabin. Quite an experience."
6096593,stumcfar,2018-03-30 08:09:00,451,"We were on a fly in trip a few years ago and a thunderstorm rolled in in the evening. It thundered and lightninged like a bugger all night and rained like I have never seen before most of the entire night. When we got up in the morning, the water was nearly to the top on all three of our camp boats and the gas tanks were floating around as far as they could go, still hooked to the motors. Needless to say, there was a lot of bailing and then some driving around with the plugs out to drain them. One gas tank must have gotten water in it, because the next day we had to tow one boat in. We used a new tank and all was fine. Found out the boats won't sink, but darned close!"
6096697,Pooch,2018-03-30 08:35:00,4618,"I always try to have the front of my boat pointed towards the lake when tied to a dock. Not always the direction I want because of the way the docks are oriented, but as close as I can get.Two bilge pumps on my boat. One full auto and the other manually activated. If a storm wakes you in the night, get your butt out of bed and check your boats.Couple years ago we were in a Canadian camp and one of the worst storms blew in late evening. Many boats were full (and I mean full) of water with everything floating or sunken in the boat. Mooring ropes were holding some of them up or they would have been even deeper in the water. Lightning hit camp and knocked out several TM chargers. It was ugly. One guy had a fiberglass boat and it was all but under water. Other boats were torn loose from their tie ups and bouncing around hitting others boats. Bunch of unhappy campers that night and the next morning.Pooch"
6096977,BornToFish,2018-03-30 10:20:00,1224,"Greetings,I can relate to the misadventures reported on this thread. Many years ago, a fellow came to fish at a nearby fishing lodge with a new Chevy pickup and a relatively new Ranger boat that he kept on the dock. A severe storm came up during one of the nights. He found his boat parked on the rocks the next morning. He called his insurance agent to report his mis-fortune.They put the boat on his trailer as best that he could and left for home. He hit a moose on his way home and totaled out his truck.My response to the question in the original post comes down to the following question: do I feel lucky? It takes some effort for two guys to pull or motor a boat up onto a log crib each night. A storm might wreck/sink a boat tied up at a dock. It might damage the dock as well. The first thing that the outfitter will say is as follows: did you pull the boat up onto the crib? It will be a short discussion when you answer ""no"" and you might end up writing a big check to the outfitter.So, go ahead and leave your boat on the dock if you feel lucky. If you don't feel so lucky, be sure to tie the boat off on the log crib. Waves might fill the transom of the boat and add enough weight to cause the boat to slide down the crib and into the lake.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6097137,turkeyriver,2018-03-30 11:35:00,80,"A little Clint Eastwood flashback BTF!! If the log cribs are set up right and the water level is good, its no big deal to pull them up and pull the plug. It is nice not to have to bail. But sometimes it takes all hands to virtually lift them up. That's when its tempting to leave them at the dock. We had a situation where it was impossible for 2 guys to get them on the crib. I accidentally kicked the plug loose getting out of the boat once but caught it after 5 minutes. Will always double check that now. Hate to think if it would have been dark and I had gone to bed!"
6097337,Bill Krejca,2018-03-30 13:19:00,6107,"Having been at camps which has wooden ladders to pull rental boats upon,I have not found it super difficult to pull a boat up the ladder. The plug (if it has one) doesn't need to be pulled until morning if water is in it. A sponge or tin can also works. Folks should tie the boats also, just pulling out of water is not surefire. Bill"
6097906,drlee,2018-03-30 17:02:00,409,"In MN a few years ago, my friends Lund Tyee was docked for the night. Lots of rain. Went down to the dock in the a.m. and his boat was fine, since it had the auto bilge. Not so much for the smaller tiller boat next to his, since the Lund's bilge outlet was a foot or two above the other boat. It sure was full of water. Geez. Talked to my son last night and we were laughing about this experience. He had talked to a friend of his who has a buddy that owns a Lake Michigan, 21' fishing boat. They had pulled the boat out of the water during a substantial rain storm. As they drove through town, the auto bilge kicked in. The cab driver, whose window was open, did not think it was funny when his vehicle was almost flooded completely. Double Geez."
6097954,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-30 17:36:00,8293,Pulling your plug would help with that. In Minnesota it's illegal to pull a boat down the road with the plug in.
