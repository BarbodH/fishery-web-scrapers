6082377,Fisher-man,2018-03-24 09:16:00,422,"My brothers and my son and I went there every year for quite a few years. But, I live in Colorado and got tired of the two day journey there and back. And, the property had deteriorated over the years. Broken screen doors, unswept cabins and porches, uneven, unstable dock, messy fish cleaning house, crappy rental boats, etc, etc. But the fishing was great. One of my brothers went back last fall and said the camp was much improved, and he went through 4 dozen minnows in a morning, most on caught and released fish, average 18""-20"" --right in the slot. He said they had new boats with 60hp tillers, depth finders, etc.But, he has been pressing us to go back, so I'm not sure I trust his report. We have had really spotty luck on Lake of the Woods the last 4-5 years, and we are all tired of making the trip and the expense for pretty chancy fishing. We ran in to bad weather 2 years, and the mayfly hatch another. Not knowing LOW as well as we do Lac Seul it was pretty frustrating. So, anyone go to Mahkwa last year? I heard new dock, new cabins, all the older cabins repaired and spruced up, etc, etc. Thanks."
6082721,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-24 10:50:00,8293,If you can't trust your brother who you going to trust? Would flying into Duluth or International Falls Mn make the trips easier?
6082769,pjshorthorn,2018-03-24 11:11:00,5654,Send Pooch a PM . He has been there many years and probably has the best intel on the current condition of the camp. PjShorthorn
6083785,Pooch,2018-03-25 03:21:00,4618,"Your brother is accurate.Camp has improved since I started fishing out of there in 2008. A few newer cabins have been added. Existing cabins are in better condition than ten years ago. Cabins are very basic. (remember, it's a fishing camp!) They have thinned out the trees on the house keeping side and around the service center. That helped get more breeze through the cabin area, which helped a bunch with bugs and hot summer nights. Being located in the timber, keeping brush cut back around the cabins is a never ending battle for the camp owners.Most of the docks are less than three years old. There is power available for battery charging on the docks, but bring a long HD extension cord.Great boat launching ramp is only a few years old. They added a dock next to the ramp making it easier to load in the wind.Water supply is much better than ten years ago. Good pressure most all of the time and drinking water is safe.Service center is manned from about six AM to late evening. Fuel and minnow prices are fair and about the same as out on the highway. There is WIFI at the service center, but it can be spotty at times.Camp boats? I think they are rebuilt Lund Alaskans or something similar. Yamaha fifties if I remember correctly. I think you might have to rent depth finders so consider just bringing your own? Check with the camp on that one.Fish cleaning house was rebuilt within the last year or so. I think they added another cleaning house where the public phone used to be. I haven't used it so can't say for sure.There seems to be younger folks now running the camp and they hustle. Everyone we've met have been good folks and helpful.I tell everyone that it is a fishing camp. We go there to fish. Like all camps we only ask that everything works. And it does as well as any other camp we stay at each season.Mahkwa is on a nice part of the lake, but it's LS so still a lot of open water to traverse.We bring our own boats and stay on the housekeeping side. I'm not familiar with the American plan side.On the Mahkwa trip my group meets up with another group of friends from MN and we book cabins next to each other each year which makes this trip usually my favorite of the year.I have another friend who takes a large mixed group from his church up earlier in the summer. I think they number twenty or so? Big bunch to manage, but they return every year.Anything else?Pooch"
6087257,JDP,2018-03-26 09:56:00,1457,"What Pooch said X2.I have been going to Mahkwa Lodge since 2005.Have fished in May, June, July and September concentrating on Walleyes.We stay in Housekeeping Cabins as Pooch does."
6090185,Fisher-man,2018-03-27 10:18:00,422,"Thanks a bunch. I love my brother, but he is not above deception to get us back there! He actually sent me pictures and confirmed a lot of what you said. He loves Lac Seul. So do the rest of us. And we never minded the ""fishing camp"" feel of Mahkwa. We are there to fish, so as long at the cabin was warm and dry we were fine. But it had really deteriorated when Roger and Evelyn (?) were in charge. So, we will be going in September. I will post a report when we get back. Again, thanks for the intel."
6090313,Pooch,2018-03-27 11:31:00,4618,Our groups will be there the end of August. Best trip of the year for me.Have a great trip. Taking your BIL with you?!?Pooch
