5732313,wmd,2017-08-22 11:38:00,388,"I would like to try Jigging Raps in Canada in a couple of weeks, but because of the cost I would use a tieable titanium leader to prevent northern bite offs . My question is will the Jigging Rap catch on the leader like it tends too with braid. I will be using Knot 2 Kinky tieable leaders. Thanks wmd"

I have considered but didn't order due to numerous reviews complaining about the difficulty in tying a knot. I am wondering if the lower # rating is sufficient for Northern bite-offs while allowing easier knot tying. Also, are you using a small barrel swivel to attach to your main line? Thanks"

5738801,wmd,2017-08-26 09:40:00,388,It is 18lb .012 diameter single strand titanium. I use a barrel swivel and use up to 20lb fiouro leader material and get bit off often. My son tried jigging raps a couple of years ago in Canada with flouro leader material a got bit off too often at $6-7 a pop. wmd

If I have a flouro leader on my Power Pro and the Northern is hooked badly I just snip the leader and let it swim away with the jig. Different I suppose if the lure was more expensive."

Nothing snags so fast as a jigging rap that makes contact with the bottom, especially if your line angle ever widens towards 45 degrees.That, to me, is the biggest concern with jigging spoons, especially jigging raps. Good luck and look forward to hearing how you did with these lures!"
