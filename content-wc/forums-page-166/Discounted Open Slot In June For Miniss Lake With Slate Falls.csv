Our plan was to have two in a boat and then we secured another boat for the odd guy, which we planned to rotate. After the first day we fished three to the boat (16 ft. Lund) and it worked out fine except for my son who had to train himself to look behind before throwing his jig. We really had a lot of fun since we had a new guy with us experiencing Canada for the first time. My advice- go for it! FISH ON! Hooks"
6094009,Bstar,2018-03-29 07:55:00,564,I would not hesitate to go three in a boat at Miniss. The boats are 16' Alumarines with 15 HP Honda's on them. They have flat bottoms in them and they are nice and wide for stability. Miniss is a large lake but it is broken up by hundreds of islands so you can always find some calmer water to fish if the wind kicks up. Feel free to PM me if you want any info on the lake or camp as well as what you might need to take on your first fly-in. I'm sure Mike Borger will help you out with some expert intel on the lake.

6109210,emma17,2018-04-04 08:24:00,436,"Thanks for the replies and advice regarding three in the Boat. As an update, I've asked my graduating son his thoughts and he looked at me as if I had lost my marbles for even asking such a ridiculous question. So we've got the issues of desire to go and three in a boat resolved. The next obstacle to overcome that I'm sure many have to deal with, is scheduling. Graduating son is currently interviewing for jobs. Second son is seeking summer internship. Of course neither knows whether they will be allowed the time off. This may have to be a delayed gift."
6109298,Mike Borger,2018-04-04 09:06:00,1554,"Good stuff! If you decide to go you'll never regret it. If I can help you in ANY way at all call me direct anytime at 905-818-9211.Regarding this specific week up for grabs, I'm shocked that no one has grabbed this deal yet! What's the matter with all you people???!!! LOL!"
6089737,Mike Borger,2018-03-27 07:46:00,1554,Mexico Schmexico. Book Miniss and get me off the hook LOL!
6089761,Bstar,2018-03-27 07:53:00,564,Lmao! Tell that to my wife!
6089977,Fishoil,2018-03-27 09:08:00,1277,If I wasn't fishing another lake just a few miles from Miniss the week before I'd have a hard time not putting a group together for this. I've heard nothing but good about this lake and the outfitter.
6090305,yoopertrout,2018-03-27 11:24:00,1172,You had me pretty excited for a minute there!
6090737,DaBirdman,2018-03-27 15:46:00,164,"Holy smokes! If we weren't doing 3 vacations this year I'd be all over this! We go to Armit with HBL in August. Miniss is one of their lakes & it was #1+++ on my want list. Alas, I was outnumbered & we're headed to Armit. I WILL go to Miniss one of these years though!!!"
6090825,emma17,2018-03-27 16:22:00,436,"A fly-in for my two sons and I has been on my mind for a long time. My oldest graduates college this May. I've never done a fly-in so I have a rookie question/issue I wrestle with. With both boys in college I don't see them much, I want us to fish together so we can hang out. How do you handle three guys on a camp boat? (I am aware there is a four person minimum)."
6090969,Fishoil,2018-03-27 17:41:00,1277,I fish Ontario with my 2 daughters every year. It's a little more crowded than I'd prefer but not really a problem. If fishing with 3 in a boat is what it takes to spend time with my 2 kids I'll take it every time and be happy about it. After your oldest graduates and gets a job/career you may never again have the opportunity. Grab it while you can!!
6091297,Mike Borger,2018-03-27 19:32:00,1554,"It's such a great idea! Fishing 3 in a boat isn't horrible, especially if it's your boys."
6091441,123chadder,2018-03-27 20:11:00,429,we often jig 3 to a boat and its fun....but im not a fan of 3 when trolling at all
6091825,55walleyes,2018-03-28 04:18:00,131,Fished 3 in a boat at Slate Falls Hooker Lake outpost and had plenty of room in the boat. We were pretty much just jigging for walleye. It was last trip my father was able to take and first trip for my daughter. I have been too may times to count and that trip was better than any that I fished 2 in the boat.
6087913,Mike Borger,2018-03-26 12:36:00,1554,"My group and I was slated to fish Slate Falls's Miniss east camp June 13 to 20, but I just had to cancel because of a scheduling conflict.I'm already fishing their Root Bay camp June 4-11 and was going to do both trips back to back, but I can't do it now. (life sucks I know ) Verne was mildly annoyed with me, but sympathetic and suggested that if someone can fill my slot he'll make it worth their while. -25% off his regular rate.-Free accommodations in his bunkhouse the night before you fly.-A free sat phone to use.-Free bait for your group. I've been to this camp before in September and had an amazing trip. You can see my write up on that trip here: https://www.canadafishingguide.net/the-magic-of-miniss/Trip is for a minimum of 4 people, max of 8. This is a prime week, on a heck of a good lake!http://slatefallsoutposts.com/cabins...s/miniss-lake/Call Verne direct if interested at 1-541-382-1310If you have any questions for me about Miniss you can call me at 1-905-818-9211Cheers, Mike"

6088753,Mike Borger,2018-03-26 18:10:00,1554,Thanks for pointing that out LOL!
6088761,Mike Borger,2018-03-26 18:11:00,1554,At 75% off I think a lot of people would be interested.

6089113,yoopertrout,2018-03-26 20:30:00,1172,"That's for sure. I've got some back trouble that make me not want to take a boating vacation this summer, but for 75% off, I'd have toughed it out. Still, 25% off is a good deal."
6089505,Bstar,2018-03-27 06:05:00,564,That's a great deal. Our group went there last August and I can tell you it's every bit as impressive as Mike's video. I can only imagine what the fishing is like in June. If I wasn't going to Mexico next week and to Melchett in Sept I would probably entertain booking this trip. That being said we are booked to go back in 2019.
