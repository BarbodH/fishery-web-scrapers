When I got married and had 2 girls we still went to Canada each year. When my daughters got married and had grand kids I took them and my whole extended family of 8 to Canada. The memories of my daughters catching there first Walleyes cant be erased. My youngest caught a 42 inch Northern that was over 20 lbs. The only words to come out of her mouth were Holy $hit about 4 times. I saw my grandson and grand daughter catch there first walleye. This is the only time that any of them fish the entire year and the memories shared with them will never fade. It is a time for family to be together and have fun.

My issue is (and always has been)... what a resort charges in, is not an ethical or even a financial issue. They aren't hosing people over because they charge in one currency. They're not automatically more expensive or cheaper because of what currency they charge in. There are resorts who do not handle exchange rates ethically. However, like I mentioned, that is a different issue altogether. It also has nothing to do with what they charge in. In fact, resorts that charge in Canadian can give bad exchange rates too.

For the simple reason I know I will get the best exchange rate at the time, and I don't have to worry about carrying that much cash.

Who cares if they post the price in CAD or USD. Doesn't matter as long as it is easy and cheap to convert your currency. I think what chaps some people is when a lodge is posted as 2400USD. Then an American calls and the price is 2400 USD. If a Canadian calls the price is 2400CAD. In effect they are giving a discount to locals (as local as someone can be given how huge the country is. I would guess I am closer to Yellowknife than someone in Toronto, but whatever.) This is similar to when I used to work in Hawaii for 6 months at a time. I used to golf every weekend as my family was 4000 miles away and I needed to kill time. Problem was the nicer courses were like $250 a round. Then one day I learned locals paid $50 to play that same $250 course. So, next time out I spoke with the manager and described my situation and they booked tee times for the next few months and labeled me a local so I could pay the $50 rate. Problem solved. I would say the lodges that do this are opening themselves up to Americans asking for a 20-25% discount given the current exchange. Maybe they just prefer Canadians as customers who knows but if I knew this was going on I would ask for a discount. In Hawaii the reason for the 'locals' rate is because they knew locals would play multiple times a month/year whereas non-residents would play once a year. I am not sure this is the case with fishing trips. B-"

It seemed kind of odd, but I never questioned it because they need to make money too. They provide a service to me that I am very willing to pay!"
6092665,stumcfar,2018-03-28 12:31:00,451,"I remember one of our very first trips to Canada 25+ years ago. I had set up the trip, told everyone how much. We all exchanged and headed up with Canadian money. At the end of the trip we went in to pay and the guy looks at our Canadian money and says ""I don't want that stuff, prices are in American"". Of course we never had that much American with. He wouldn't take a credit card, finally said he would take the Canadian but wanted an exchange rate nearly twice what it was. He finally settled on taking a personal check from one of the guys. That was in the day before you could easily check everything out on the internet. It was my mistake for not doing a better job of checking and being naive on how camps charged. I was upset at the time but I learned my lesson. We haven't missed a year, not all at that same place, but it sure didn't tick us off from coming back!"
6092713,Fisherman Ted,2018-03-28 13:00:00,461,"[QUOTE=Flyinfisher1;6091817] We don't even call if prices are in USD, but when the exchange rate was par we still booked with outfitters charging in CDN, no double standards.[/QUOTE] That line of thinking could not be more myopic. You could be missing out on killer deals and incredible resorts. But you don't call because of the currency? Are you kidding me? So by the same logic if two resorts that offer the same amenities and fishing charge 70% more in Canadian funds versus USD you would pick the one that charges in Canadian? Sometimes I just shake my head...... -FT"

6090849,Obabikon,2018-03-27 16:29:00,2370,"Not sure what you mean by ""extra charge"". If you mean exchange rate, that isn't an extra charge. That's simply what the value of the trip is. If you're speaking of someone charging ""extra"" or giving an inaccurate exchange rate... that is a different issue all around. I happily charge any Canadian guests the exact value of their trip. My prices (along with many other resort owners) are posted in US dollars, simply because 99.9% of my guests are US citizens. That way they know the actual cost of their trip before hand. For the record, I also am willing to accept Gold or Silver at spot prices for payment of a trip. I don't care what currency you use... value is established by the market. $1,000 US $1,290 CANADIAN .743 ounces of Gold 60.2 ounces of Silver All four of those are the same right now. Economics and foreign exchange rates are a great topic. Now, it sounds more like you think as a Canadian, you should get a discounted price. Many resorts do that. I'm sure you can find some. You can also go to a resort that just charges in Canadian... then they are charging all their guests in the same currency, and the same price."

There are very good outfitters that charge in US funds and very good outfitters that charge in Canadian funds. Do you want the outfitters that charge US funds to raise their prices 20% and then charge Canadian funds?

Take the better deal. Has nothing to do with what funds they use. If one was charging $1500 US and the other was charging $2000 Canadian... just take the better deal.I have several direct competitors that offer similar services in Canadian dollars... some are more expensive, some are less expensive. Their prices are set according to the currency they charge in, so no one is taking Canadian for US at par... that doesn't make sense. If you want them to switch currencies, that is easy to figure out. Now... if they give a BS exchange rate, and charge an extra fee for people who pay in Canadian... that is an entirely different issue.I have absolutely no clue how some resorts/outfitters charge the amount that they charge. I know a resort who is very similar to mine, on Lake of the Woods... has more than 50% higher rates than I do (both of us charge in US funds). They have plenty of guests."
