I originally was planning a trip to GSL back in Nov. I couldn't get an opening that worked at Trout Rock. Then about a week ago I got a call about a 3 day opening at Trout Rock that backs up to another trip I had booked. I phoned my buddies and had no luck. If I don't find a boat partner I am going to lose this chance to fish arguably some of the best pike water in NA. The price is 2445USD. The trip is 3 days. I'd really like to fish this piece of water but I cant afford to pay double for the 3 days. Anyways anyone up for a a quick trip and a bunch of big pike prime time? Please message me here if interested and we can schedule some time to talk.http://www.enodah.com is the website for Trout Rock. Brett"

If you want to do a web search check out ""Trout Rock and In-Fisherman"" or Search ""best pike water in North America"". There are several articles from third parties also talking about their pike fishing.Brett"
