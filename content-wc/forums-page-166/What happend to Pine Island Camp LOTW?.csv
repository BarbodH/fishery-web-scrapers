1195307,PineIsland,2010-04-30 17:56:00,2,"Pine Island Camp is no longer in full operation. There are no boat rentals and no American Plan offered. As it is right now, a few cabins are being rented seasonally and can be rented weekly. If you have any questions, you can email [email protected] . We are the current operators."
4501329,Steve hill,2016-01-31 08:15:00,1,Does any one know how to contact the owners of the camp and the current status. Is it fo sale or rent?
4502017,Obabikon,2016-01-31 12:46:00,2370,"I believe Bill Thurmer is the owner still. I've never seen a listing, but I've heard they're asking a lot for it. I have no contact info for him."
6109754,Guest,2018-04-04 11:59:00,0,"just found this thread, and then found a video of Pine Island from 2013. My dad and i stayed a pine island a couple of times in the early 90's, the last year George Wenk owned it. We were sorry to see him sell. Here is the video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrbFAmO2EdY"
1137918,Guest,2009-09-23 18:42:00,0,"I used to go fishing with my father, family and friends in the 1980s there. Saw that it was sold a couple of times but now can't seem to find any information on them. The website is no longer working. Does anyone know if this place is still in business? If so can you give me their website. If not, what happend to it? Is it privately owned and are all the cabins still on the island? Thanks for any information. Wingmann17"
1137925,BB3,2009-09-23 19:01:00,48,"All the cabins are there,but I haven't seen any activity all summer. I heard it was sold but don't know for sure. You could try Mylie's place on mainland or Obabikon out on an Island."
1137930,rockpt,2009-09-23 19:14:00,589,"Shut down last year. Haven't seen any activity when I've run by there. Other island camps in area are Obabikon Bay Resort, Grassy Narrows Lodge, Tamarack Lodge and New Moon Lodge."
1137951,champ8,2009-09-23 20:19:00,40,"I stayed there a couple of years ago. it wasn't fancy but very adequate and the couple running the place did a really nice job. Later that fall I received a letter in the mail from the owner trying to sell timeshares on the property. I wasn't interested in the timeshare option. When I went by there this past July I didn't see anyone out, although it looked like there may have been some activity on the island."
1138011,birddogger,2009-09-24 08:00:00,43,Where was pine island camp located?
1138060,rockpt,2009-09-24 10:02:00,589,Just north of Little Raspberry.
1138240,Obabikon,2009-09-25 07:00:00,2370,"Pine Island Camp has NOT been sold.... it is still for sale. They decided not to run it this year, with dwindeling business. They did try to rent all their cabins though... you paid $XXXX and got one cabin the entire year. They have sold off most of their docks and boats... it also doesn't sound like they'll be operating next year."
1138241,Obabikon,2009-09-25 07:02:00,2370,"Also Wing... George Wenk (old owner) is a part time guide for me. His wife, daughter and he live in hanson bay during the summer."
1138242,Guest,2009-09-25 07:06:00,0,"Does anyone know if the Pine Island camp was the same camp owned by the ""Fowlers"" back in the 70s?"
1138370,Guest,2009-09-25 16:48:00,0,Thanks for all the information everyone. Sorry to hear the place is no longer running. Had a lot of great times and memories there. George and Janet ran a really nice place. Wingmann17
