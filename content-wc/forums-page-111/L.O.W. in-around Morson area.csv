6355020,Hook_settr,2019-09-02 05:37:00,127,"Fished the last week of August our of Miley's Place. The winds were strong and relentless everyday except Friday out of the south and west. Heavy rain one day with some thunder but otherwise the precip was very manageable. On to the fishing... Walleyes-we caught quite a few numbers wise but they were mostly all on the small size. We managed one 26"" fish, one 19"" fish and enough 17"" fish to make our limit of 8. We fished Miles Bay mostly but did fish Sabaskong bay one day due to the winds. It was tough to find active fish of any size in Sabaskong and consequently nearly all of the fish we caught were out of Miles Bay. We found them in anywhere from 16 fow to 28 fow in bays with muddy bottoms. We did find some off a wind swept point in 30-33 fow. Gold spinners or Lindy Lil' Guys outfished jigs for us. We used both nightcrawlers and minnows without noticing any appreciable difference. Pike-very hard to come by. Caught one 24"" fish walleye fishing and casted for them for an hour or two each day with only one strike. Finally went up into Obabikon and was able to scratch out a dozen on silver minnows and spinner baits. No size to them. The musky fishermen we talked to also said that they were hardly seeing any pike. Smallmouth-only casted the rubble along shorelines once or twice and picked up two but no size. We picked up a couple more fishing walleyes and probably should have been fishing reefs but we weren't interested in catching them using those methods. Musky-didn't fish for them but my buddy had roughly a 40"" fish come up and check out the chrome spatula he was cleaning after shore lunch one day. Apparently a chrome spatula with a brillo pad trailer was the ticket to move musky that week. LOL Crappie/Perch-did not target these species specifically but were happy that we stumbled across a few of size to take home while we were walleye fishing. Got one nice 14"" crappie on a Lil' Guy while walleye fishing. After talking with a couple locals at the dock Friday night they said they had similar walleye fishing for the week. Sounds like they are in transition. Not my best week up there but I would go back tomorrow if I had the opportunity. It doesn't always have to be about the fishing. Tight lines! Hook_settr"
6356906,LyleK,2019-09-09 09:45:00,248,Any recent updates from this area? Thanks
6356988,Obabikon,2019-09-09 16:31:00,2370,"Walleye have moved to the fall spots. Mud channels in 18-20' of water. Crappie have not really gotten going. Still catching some on sunken trees, and an occasional one in the elbow. Northern pike have been normal. Not a ton of small ones in Obabikon lake, but the big ones are pretty aggressive in the main lake. Musky are on all structures, but are starting to move to the secondary rocks 6' deep or so."
6357124,LyleK,2019-09-10 07:25:00,248,Thank you !
6357886,Guest,2019-09-12 10:54:00,0,Any idea on the water temps up that way? Thanks
6341024,fishingMN4eyes,2019-07-15 12:05:00,108,"Got back late last night after fishing Thursday thru Sunday morning. Tough fishing and, at times, conditions but managed to bring home one fish short of full walleye limits for four guys with 16 perch as well. Would have been full limits (and even more perch) but we opted for a second meal of fish Saturday night.Marked and caught most of our fish in 22-25' I would say, but caught fish as shallow as 15' a couple times. Thursday and Friday were pretty windy and couldn't really find a consistent bite. Wind was pretty much nonexistent Saturday so we made a longer run West and found better numbers and size. Picked up a 21"", 21.5"", and 22.5"" all off the same spot Saturday afternoon, that was the extent of the size we found. Had to weed through a lot of small fish for the unders. We tried leeches, minnows, and crawlers and didn't think any of them outfished the rest. Had pretty good luck with crawlers, slow death, and smile blades when we caught the most fish on Saturday."
6341106,Hook_settr,2019-07-15 16:42:00,127,Thanks for the update! Glad you were able to find enough to bring home nearly a limit and still have a couple meals of fish while you were there.
6350986,Hook_settr,2019-08-18 06:24:00,127,"We are headed up to Mylie's next weekend and plan to primarily fish the Miles Bay and Obabikon areas but we are also considering exploring the Sabaskong area some this year. Would anyone care to offer any updates on fishing conditions? We typically target walleye but will also go after pike and smallmouth. I'm not expecting anyone to offer up any hot spots but depth, presentation, structure type, bait etc. would be much appreciated. Has the algae bloom happened yet? Many thanks! Hook_settr"
6351012,Obabikon,2019-08-18 07:42:00,2370,"The bloom is very thick in our area right now. Most of the guides are heading west and southwest to find cleaner water. Miles Bay is green too, but it is big enough that wind is the key. So, if we get a wind out of the west, don't fish the east side of Miles. It will all have blown to that side. Walleye are on rock points and humps in 18-24 feet of water. We've just been using jigs and minnows. Have a great trip! Justin is a heck of a host!"
6351106,Hook_settr,2019-08-18 14:56:00,127,"Thanks for the info Jared. I knew we were going to be flirting with the bloom when I booked that week but from what I have read, it's not a deal breaker. Although, hearing that your guides are making sure they avoid it is a little concerning. Yep, Justin always takes good care of us when we are there. I hope your season is going well! Thanks again, Hook_settr"
6351114,Obabikon,2019-08-18 15:50:00,2370,"The guides avoid it more for preference than they do because they dont' catch fish in it. Thick green stuff just isn't as pretty to look at. Musky fishermen do go look for clearer water. That's the nice thing about having such an expansive lake. You can always go for a 10-15 minute boat ride, and find completely new water."
6351122,BreezyPoint,2019-08-18 16:14:00,1581,"The bloom does nothing to affect fishing. Although I might add that follows are hard to detect follows with a big bloom. The wind moves the bloom around a lot. If you don't like it, fish on the side away from the bloom.Frank"
6352206,walleyeguy3,2019-08-22 14:09:00,42,"How was the trip last week? Hope you did well. What can/should we expect in 2 weeks? Is the crappie bite starting yet, or that still a few weeks out yet? Are the big perch still roaming around? Where have they come from? We used to catch a few here and there, but now it seems like they are everywhere."
6352692,FishinFreaks,2019-08-24 07:49:00,386,Up just east of Morson now. We're on the west side of Blueberry. Fishing is slow. We went out west of town yesterday and all the way out to Tods Island. No keeper walleye for us. Moved one musky. Talked to a couple guys that boated 2 muskies yesterday. Said it was slow overall as well. We've been jigging for walleyes. Might try spinners today.
6352770,fishingMN4eyes,2019-08-24 17:43:00,108,"Bummer. Just a little further west of Tods is the only area we found decent size in early July. Hopefully it gets better, we will be up there September 7-9 hopefully."
6338376,1700SS,2019-07-07 08:34:00,104,"I have stayed with Miike and Ann at Red Wing Lodge for over 20 years. It is a drive to. If I was going to boat in I would have to go out and stay at Jared's, Obabikon Lodge."
6338448,Obabikon,2019-07-07 13:54:00,2370,"It all depends on the type of trip you're looking for. There's a lot of great resorts in the area. If you're looking American plan, house keeping, just walleye, guides available, island camp or mainland.... The awesome thing is there are great resorts out of morson that will fit everyone's needs/budget."
6338562,muskyman73,2019-07-08 01:42:00,401,"We just got back from fishing at Amasons Obabikon. We fished the Miles Bay area, and fished the wind blown shorelines and found that the most turbulent shorelines produced the best. We threw red rattle traps 1/2 oz - 3/4 oz, fishing the shorelines. We caught walleye all week long doing this. A few on crankbaits too. Access to nearby deep water produced the best, as did the chunck rock and boulder shorelines. Everything we caught was coughing up crawdads. Casting the baits out, pumping during the retrieve, letting it fall and varying your retrieve worked best. And throwing it on braid was a must, it was easier to detect bites."
6338586,Bergy,2019-07-08 06:47:00,83,"We are looking for a drive to housekeeping camp. We would bring our own boat and fish on our own. Looking for clean cabins, with full bath and kitchen. Protected docks and close to spots to fish for Walleye."
6338654,BreezyPoint,2019-07-08 10:01:00,1581,Red Wing Lodge. Great docks and fishing close to camp. We are there right now and the walleye fishing has been really good and I am not a great walleye guy.Frank
6338656,walleyeguy3,2019-07-08 10:10:00,42,Miley's and Buena Vista are nice places as well. Very easy drive to fish camps. We have stayed at Buena Vista a number of times in different cabins and all the cabins that we rented have been clean and comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for one second.
6338790,Baseline,2019-07-08 16:28:00,3207,Red Wing Lodge and Resort @ Morson. Smaller resort with great owners.
6338872,Obabikon,2019-07-08 20:28:00,2370,"I don't think you can go wrong with any of the three main ones. Mylies, Red Wing, and Buena Vista all have their own positives."
6339082,walleyeguy3,2019-07-09 14:22:00,42,"Hey Obabikon, fair warning. We're heading your way tomorrow after work. Can't wait to put a line in the water and get after some walleye."
6339406,Obabikon,2019-07-10 12:46:00,2370,See you soon.
6332276,walleyeguy3,2019-06-18 14:27:00,42,"Anyone fishing in the Morson area? Hopefully I'm not overlooking a thread, if I am my apologies for starting a new one looking for updates. What's working and where?"
6332662,Obabikon,2019-06-19 14:39:00,2370,"Fishing has been pretty solid. 15-25 feet deep off of points and reefs. We only use jigs and minnows, so I don't know what all is working. I also have a handful of weedbeds that have been holding walleye too, but most have not."
6332952,walleyeguy3,2019-06-20 12:33:00,42,It's going to be a long 2 weeks until we get to go up there and try our luck. Gets the juices flowing just following along with some of the reports that get shared on this site. I always enjoy the guys who aren't afraid to share some of their success stories.
6335294,1700SS,2019-06-27 17:28:00,104,"Jared, With the warmer temps, anything new? Are they on the humps yet? Thanks in advance."
6335484,Obabikon,2019-06-28 08:26:00,2370,"Still on the sides of the humps. Points have been better fishing the past few days. Had the dreaded mayfly hatch, but seems to have stabilized. 15-25 feet.... not much shallow."
6337878,fishingMN4eyes,2019-07-05 09:59:00,108,Shameless bump since I may have some interest in walleyeguy3's trip alsoAny new reports?
6338220,Obabikon,2019-07-06 15:25:00,2370,"Walleye bite seems to be slow until 10AM everyday right now. Once 10 or 10:30 rolls around though, they are pretty steady on the humps and the sides of humps."
6338254,1700SS,2019-07-06 18:59:00,104,"I just returned home today. Walleye fishing was excellent. I found most on the softer bottom close to hard bottom.Anywhere from 14-23 feet of water. I fished mainly shoreline points but seen many boats on humps. Yesterday my 18 year old had 108 on the counter for 3 of us. All on jigs and plastics. Could not find many crappies or perch though. Bass were going strong early in the week casting shorelines but seemed to disappear as the week went on. Caught 46"" muskie casting for bass. Seen a few others, but never really tried for them."
6338274,bbheli,2019-07-06 20:54:00,1387,"Fished out of grassy narrows, got back a week ago. Caught lots of fish but mainly small walleye and a few nice perch. Did best of the west shoreline of miles bay in 14-18' FOW and second best spot was a hole that went from 33' to 18' but if we did not maintain constant bottom contact no bite. Could not get much action on plastics most caught on minnows. Lots of pike action in the weeds but no size. Saw a few 27"" + Walleye brought in by the guides."
6338366,Bergy,2019-07-07 08:25:00,83,Could you guys tell me the best place to stay in this area? We would want a drive to place that is not too far from the decent fishing spots. Also a place you can stay out of the wind for fishing and protected dock at the camp.
