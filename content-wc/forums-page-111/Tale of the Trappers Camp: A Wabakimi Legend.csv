I'm certainly not much of a writer, but Mike worked hard with me as I wrote this, teaching me what was required. I had a story to tell and Mike gave me the platform to tell it. Thank you, thank you my friend!

I hope you are visiting the cabin this year Thanks AndrewYup, I just got back from Wabakimi, did a slow drift with my son and a soft prayer for Sarah CrookhamQuote: Originally Posted by AMPHIB206I'd love to see an updated pic of the 12 footer, as well as their 4ft live well and even the outhouse or trap shack. Great story.Lol, that live well was the first to go. I looked at where it was and you would not even guess that a well was thereQuote: Originally Posted by wbgbesoxVery interesting articleThanksQuote: Originally Posted by TexFlyGreat read PikeSlayer!

We had my dad's memorial service at the shore lunch spot across from the entrance to the West End. Magical place."
6333528,Lake Of The Woods,2019-06-22 14:24:00,124,"A great story that feeds that romantic side of the wilderness. After reading it I felt compelled to contact a good friend of mine in Thunder Bay who works as a Hydrometric Survey Technologist in the Water Survey Division of Environment Canada. He said he does not personally know Joel Crookham but has heard his name mentioned over the years. He gave me some information on Joel that pertains to a business he ran in Armstrong, Ontario and is going to investigate further then contact me with what he finds. Once he gets back to me I will post what the findings are. As well, I have included a picture of a trappers cabin I stubbled across some 25+ years ago in a remote area north of Kenora. I lived in the area and would fish the lake two or three times a year always taking the time to check up on the cabin. Not sure how long it had been there before I discovered it but it seems in decent shape without any signs of collapse or significant rot. There are White Cedar trees growing in the area and if the cabin was built using these trees that may explain it not decaying due to the natural thujaplicins preservatives. The windows are all boarded over and the door has an old rusty lock on it,... but the thing that is really noticeable when you first see it is the many bear claw markings on all for sides of the exterior. The trap line trail is still identifiable,... or at least it was the last time I was there which was some 8+ years ago. Anyways, I'm sure there are many more of these cabins with interesting stories attached to them. I plan on going back up that way next summer and will be sure to take pictures of what still remains."
6334194,Pikeslayer8,2019-06-24 15:53:00,1460,I'm guessin the business of Joel's is the tree planting business he ran outta Armstrong. I can't wait to see the pics of that old camp and I'm sure it has a cool story to tell. Thanks Lake
