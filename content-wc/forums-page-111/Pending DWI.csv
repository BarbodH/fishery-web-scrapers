6355526,pjshorthorn,2019-09-03 16:16:00,5654,Good to hear Brad. Looking forward to hearing about your trip. PjShorthorn
6347922,rockape,2019-08-07 12:54:00,215,He can swim across the Rainy River. It isn't that far. Pick him up somewhere in Fort Frances.
6348304,Ikedcr,2019-08-08 18:15:00,4,"My story is about 7 years old. One of our group had the exact same situation. He drove his own vehicle to International Falls, if he could not cross he would drive home. Found a place to park it several days. Hopped into my truck with 4 guys total. It was the typical questions, it appeared that all IDs were scanned in. No issues, we all sailed into Canada. Sadly he has not gone back since because he was convicted after the trip."
6348358,ManitowishWaters,2019-08-08 21:06:00,39,I sure would try. All DUI's after Dec 31st 2018 will result in a lifetime ban.
6348366,HodakaD,2019-08-08 21:45:00,106,Do you have a link for that?
6348440,LoDo,2019-08-09 08:05:00,721,Do you have more info on this 'lifetime ban'?
6348746,ManitowishWaters,2019-08-10 09:06:00,39,"From an attorney site, but you can find all kinds of info on Bill C-46 http://bordercrossing.ca/update-new-dui-border-crossing-restrictions-not-retroactive/"
6348754,ManitowishWaters,2019-08-10 09:14:00,39,"Basically the new law does not allow boarder agents to deem people rehabilitated for DUI's committed after Dec 18th 2018. I looked into this heavily for this years trip as my cousin had a dui from 18 years ago. After 3 calls to the boarder and talking with two agents and the head of immigration at Fort Frances they all said no worries on the old conviction, but with the new law anything after Dec 18 is going to be impossible to get around unless rules change."
6348866,Shellback,2019-08-10 17:08:00,8083,"I have to wonder if American professional athletes, movie stars etc are required to be held to these same rules? If an American baseball team is playing in Toronto, and a player has a DUI, do they send him home? I kinda doubt it."
6351604,sptrix,2019-08-20 13:03:00,175,"Here's what you need to know from someone who has experience. * If he has not been convicted he can get in. * Once convicted, he will need to apply for a TRP (Temporary Residency Permit). There are two ways to go about it...I'm only going to spend time on the way that gives him the best chance to get in. Hire an attorney in Canada who specializes in getting people with DUI's into Canada. Do a google search and you'll figure it out. * Getting a TRP is a pain in the butt, but it's the only way you are guaranteed entrance into Canada if you are convicted of a DUI. It's also not inexpensive. * The process can take months to get approval. I've applied in November and not gotten a response until June. I've been approved 3 times, and never denied. * When you get to the border and they run your passport, they will know that you are inadmissable into Canada and will tell you as much. You acknowledge your awareness but let them know you've been approved for a TRP, at which point you go into the customs station, present your paperwork and get what they need you to have (the permit) to go on your way. * Repeat the process for the following year. * Do this for at least 5 years and then try to apply for a longer TRP or successive TRPs. After a few more years apply for rehabilitation, which allows you to enter the country in the future without a TRP. If you're looking for an attorney, I'd recommend Mitch Jessiman. Good luck."
6351764,LoDo,2019-08-20 21:30:00,721,"We leave tomorrow. Winnipeg customs will be interesting. He was charged ~30 days ago, however his day in court isnt until Sept. Hopefully tomorrow goes without a hitch. Thanks for the info!"
6347182,Baseline,2019-08-05 06:15:00,3207,"My question is ..... ""has your friend had to surrender his license"". In Minnesota you have to surrender your license within 30 days after being charged with a DWI. This surrender is prior to the final court sentencing. My thought is that if he surrendered his license the suspension will be on record and when you hand over the passports or other ID the charge will show up. If you decide to include this guy I would have a plan B just in case he is refused entry. One thing for sure is if this guy is convicted it will be a long time before he hooks another Canadian fish."
6347210,bigcreekdad,2019-08-05 07:17:00,74,"Lousy situation. I'd have him drive separately. If he makes it across he can leave his car somewhere across the border. If he does drive separately, I'd probably put at least one other guy in his car when crossing just to not draw attention to a solo driver. Good luck. While it's easy to say he was inconsiderate, I don't think that's really appropriate without knowing the situation. You can get nailed in my area with 3 beers over the course of a 2 hour dinner."
6347216,LoDo,2019-08-05 07:26:00,721,"He's trying to fly into Winnipeg, meet with us, drive to Red Lake. I guess he'll find out at customs in Winnipeg. The real question is if convicted how long until he'll be able to re enter? I haven't spent too much time on this, but a poster stated 5-10 yrs. I think he's right."
6347280,Baseline,2019-08-05 09:54:00,3207,One of our crew got nailed for a DWI coming back from a retirement party about 10 years ago. He inquired and was told by Canadian Immigration that he had to complete his original sentence and be 10 years past clearing probation. He received the standard 30 days in jail which was stayed for 2 weekends in jail and 3 years probation. So your buddy is at least 10 years plus any probation time your state imposes. He should be aware that it is a lot tougher to clear customs at an airport than crossing with a bunch of fisherman headed north for a fishing trip.
6347294,Guest,2019-08-05 10:09:00,0,"Dong Says, He is not convicted of anything so no problem. I have never had to show my license nor have I ever been asked about any DUI convictions. Don't worry about it and dont have him at the wheel during the crossing and you will have nothing to worry about ."
6347402,Baseline,2019-08-05 15:37:00,3207,Don't believe this post. You can't enter Canada without an ID.
6347422,eyecatcher1,2019-08-05 16:21:00,323,I wouldn't let him drive or bring his own vehicle because when they run your plate a lot of things show up. Three years ago they knew that I had a new truck and a few years before that they knew that I was going to a different resort. One year they asked me what I did for a living since I had so much time to come fishing in Canada.
6347616,Guest,2019-08-06 09:43:00,0,"Baseline: Dong says use a passport instead of drivers license. DWI not tied to passport. Dong says, ""if guy no driving, no need to show license"" Dong say, ""be confidence and guy no hollar"""
6347640,The tank,2019-08-06 11:02:00,340,Dong dont know jack! Dwi is tied to passport and so is everything else you've done wrong in your life. Dwi may never show up on your mvr (DL) but will always show up on your FBI records. When they run your passport that gives them access to your FBI records.
6347698,Baseline,2019-08-06 15:01:00,3207,The guy can try getting in anyway he wants to. It's a risk. He might get in or might not. He should have plan B in case he's headed home after being denied entry. I had two work clients in Vancouver and Calgary and would fly to both cities at least 6 times a year. Airport customs are 10 times more thorough than the Fisherman line at the popular border crossings. All entries have very up to date information.
6347024,LoDo,2019-08-04 10:10:00,721,"Gents, Anyone with experience in this department? I've seen tons of links on this site with border crossings and DWI, but what about a DWI that is pending? Our group of 8 might be one short to an unfortunate event last week. DWI was the charge. Court date is Sept. 7 day trip is in two weeks. In other words its pending. Does this guy have a fight chance?"
6347036,That Minnesota guy,2019-08-04 11:49:00,8293,My opinion he hasn't been convicted so any questions pertaining to guilt would be a honest no.
6347044,eyecatcher1,2019-08-04 12:14:00,323,"I have been crossing the border for a long time and have never been asked about anything pertaining to criminal offenses. If they run his license they may catch it, but since he hasn't been to court yet I would doubt that they can find it yet."
6347048,Crede,2019-08-04 13:22:00,134,"Disclaimer: No way of being certain until he is attempting to cross the border.The experiences of 2 people I know. Both were pulled over and refused to blow into the machine. In Ohio that is an automatic DUI charge.#1 - 2 years ago. Charged in June. Trial not until after September. Had an Ontario trip planned for early September. His attorney said to not worry about it and go. Said that US government was far behind entering into data base that they did not currently enter charges. Only convictions. I have no idea if that is true but he got on an airplane in Ohio, flew to Toronto and on to Thunder Bay. Flew back a week later. No one questioned him either direction. (Later pled down to much lesser charge.)#2 - Charged in May. Got same advice as above from different attorney. Called Canadian Customs in Sault Ste Marie. They gave him the “no promises, depends on the moment” talk but then admitted that they currently only see convictions. He crossed at Sault Ste. Marie as a passenger in the vehicle behind mine in mid-June. It was literally 30 seconds from the time they pulled up until they were passed through. (Still awaiting beginning of court process)."
6347050,lionfan19,2019-08-04 13:56:00,41,"I have no idea about this persons ability to cross the border but I will say this. Way to let everyone else in your party down. You knew you had a trip like this planned why are you engaging in high risk behavior that has the potential to screw up not only your vacation but every else in the the group. Very selfish at the very least. I have a person I have gone on several such trips with and he got into some legal trouble about ten years ago. He still brings up the subject of being included in any trips I plan to Ontario and I always say ""your inadmissible to Canada"". He tries to convince me otherwise saying that was a long time ago but to this day he has not contacted anyone in Canada about being deemed criminally rehabilitated. Very sorry to hear that someone has screwed around with your fishing trip but I guess fishing in Canada is not the priority I think it is."
6347066,pjshorthorn,2019-08-04 14:52:00,5654,Me thinks you should save your judgemental approach for your beloved Lions as they deserve it moreso than a forum member asking an honest question.......in order to make a good assessment on how it may affect a vacation for a friend and others. Geeezzzzz...... PjShorthorn
6347068,The tank,2019-08-04 15:19:00,340,I agree with PjShorthorn. Hard to tell if it would show up yet. They swipe your passport but I dont know if they are all processed. I was arrested in 2010 for dui and was found not guilty in court. 2011 I was pulled around and detained for 45 minutes. He run my passport a couple of times to make sure it came back as a non conviction. I talked with him on how did this show up. He told me that they are hooked up with our FBI records. Mine never showed up on my DL so I just wonder how they knew. He said every ticket you get no matter guilty or not is on your FBI record. He showed me a print out and every speeding ticket I've gotten was on there and I was put on court supervision for all of them. So does the FBI have it in there data base yet???
6347082,LoDo,2019-08-04 16:21:00,721,"The only part of the trip that sucks is our friends status is now questionable and we may have to roll with three in one of the boats. Outside those two items, we're going."
6347094,lionfan19,2019-08-04 17:07:00,41,"I am sorry if it came out badly PjShorthorn, it just pains me to think about the uncertainty that these guys are going through right now. Its hard enough to get a crew together to go on a trip north of the border and when I hear that something like this has happened so close to the time they are leaving it really frustrates me. I will just say fishing north of the border is very special to me and I really feel bad when I read something like this."
6347122,Guest,2019-08-04 19:09:00,0,"I hear rumor that it may become even more troublesome. I was talking with a Canadian Customs and immigration officer and I was told if someone is charged with a DUI / DWI after December 31 2019, it will be a life time ban to enter Canada. If you have a DUI prior to Dec 31, the 5 and 10 year rules are still in effect. 5 years after your DUI ""punishment"" you can fill out a TRP at the border or thru a consulate to have permission to enter. After 10 years you are deemed rehabilitated. It's certainly going to suck once again after the progress the Canadians made a few years back."
