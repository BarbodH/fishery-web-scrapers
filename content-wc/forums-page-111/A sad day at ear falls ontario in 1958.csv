Before my dad built the homestead cabin on scout lake he bought a lakefront lot on blue lake near vermillion bay. I think it was in 1943 or 1944. He built a cabin there. I was 9 months old. Beautiful spring fed lake but the fishing was just so so. Water was very cold. Almost too cold to swim. Water was so clear you could see down 20 feet. He had friends that we visited often, Gordon and Tina Rutherford in vermillion bay. He made the move to scout lake and built the cabin there while my mom and 6 kids held down the fort at blue lake. Our neighbors at blue lake were the idencranzes, wolds, and doctor Carunthers."
