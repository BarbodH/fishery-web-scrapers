Hoping for tips or spots that work if there are any. Also any help on the apparent whitefish would be nice as well. Normally fish the Sudbury region which I assume will be similar up there but any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

So, you had to fish the edges. Trolling was most effective. I don't think the lake down near Horwood Outposts is nearly as deep and has typical Walleye structure.A couple of spots:47.977738, -82.29374147.977806, -82.33342347.936950, -82.313306The south end by the falls (47.867585, -82.295731) should be good too. Never went down that far. If you look at Google maps you will see 5 boats sitting there.Whitefish, well, if you figure it out let me know. The only time I have caught Whitefish in the summer was during the Mayfly hatch.Watch out for the floating logs every morning/night!! It's crazy! I believe it is a flooded reservoir and also used to used to transport timber. So, there were a lot of very large logs [and some with metal spikes] floating whenever the water got calm. Never seen anything like it before or since."

This time of year trolling is definitely the way to go I prefer pulling cranks, but if the fish are finicky I will switch to Worm harnesses or fish structure with jigging raps and jigs/minnows. I made a video last week on one of our outings if you'd like to check it out. Gives some quick tips on whats been producing there lately!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zvPVvgzH30&t=17s"
6346898,LostMarble,2019-08-03 16:09:00,4,"Awesome thanks for the input! I enjoyed the video. I don’t think I’ll be getting planer boards but I’m planning on bringing my dipsy diver. I also am going to try to figure out whitefish as well.How’s the lake when it comes to storms? Does it whip up? I know it’s not a huge open body of water, more long legs. Many shoals and rocks to watch out for?"
6347136,Tayzak15,2019-08-04 20:31:00,48,"Its not too bad in hardiman bay, most hazards can be seen above the waterline. As for storms you're usually fine in that part of the lake. However a strong southwest wind can really stir it up and create some 3-4 footers."
6356112,LostMarble,2019-09-05 17:59:00,4,"Thanks for the input. It’s been a couple weeks since we’ve been back and we are already planning next year. We had a blast! The outpost was a great place to stay. There are rules but they aren’t anything difficult to follow. We had a ton of tiny walleye to start but managed one 23” eye (my son took the picture, cut off the tail...) and a bunch of 16”-19” later on in the week. Found a great shallow bay with lots of pike. Also caught one absolutely enormous perch (my dad)! Looking forward to next year but if anyone ever has any info they would like to share on summer whitefish I would be all ears. Thanks again!"
6356190,fishron,2019-09-06 06:25:00,317,"Thanks for the report. Sounds like you had a great trip. Never fished Horwood but other lakes in that area have produced whitefish while jigging common areas with walleye. On a recent June trip to Quebec we caught them on jigs fishing windy points along with walleye. In a few weeks we will be fishing a lake that has a deep water population of whitefish in southern Ontario that has never produced a lure caught whitefish in over thirty years of trips. Maybe a different species. In my experience, they fight well but die quickly if not released soon after caught."
