6353202,unchained,2019-08-26 12:26:00,208,"you guys who fish walleye at home go on trips to fish walleye? I went to a lake in northern saskatchewan a week ago and fished for lakers and pike the whole time. There were walleye in the lake but we have plenty walleye to catch at my home lake (Bay of Quinte) so we focused on the other two. When we got there, it was day 1 of a serious coldfront so our hopes were not high. We only had 5 hrs and after 3 hrs I was on a serious skunk. The other guy I was paired with from our group of 8, who never fishes and had to learn how to cast a spinning rod, had 7 in that time. I got my first one in the 4th hr and had around 10 when the day was done. We fished only pike and caught about 20 between us. Our biggest was 39"" with half a dozen over 30"". The guide was despondent at how poor we had done lol so I guess everything is relative. For 4 days I never had a day where I personally caught less than 10 fish. Best day would have been the last with half a dozen lakers and 20 pike. The guides however said this was the worst week of the year. Guess everything's relative. Biggest for the week in our group was a 44"" pike and a 10 lb laker. No giants however best for this year that lodge has had a 52 lb laker and a 48"" pike. Best ever is a 54"" pike and a 72 lb laker. Pretty wild to think of a 72 lb laker."
6353426,prov1900,2019-08-27 06:58:00,544,"That is a giant laker, indeed. 54"" pike? That is impressive."
6354762,mixedbag,2019-08-31 21:14:00,76,"Try taking off your walleye hat and slipping on a musky cap...that will humble you and you will learn to take a fishless stretch in stride. It will also either break you or make you a better fisherperson.With musky you cant let up on focus and eventually focus and tenacity become 2nd nature.... well learned, well earned."
6355318,Poochie,2019-09-03 08:34:00,8,"I thought it was very, very rare to get skunked but it happened to me on Cliff lake back in 1980 after 3 days of hitting it hard. I just got back from Lac Vieux Desert in upper Wisconsin yesterday. We fished it 2 days, 10 hours each day. One 30 inch northern and bunch of 15 inchers and one 1lb bass. Thats close to getting skunked but like others have said..that's why they call it fishing and not catching. But gotta say, the scenery, bald eagles flying around, the feeling that maybe, just maybe this is the lucky cast...what can I say, we had a blast anyway."
6351502,Camoclad,2019-08-20 07:46:00,628,"Sometimes I get so relaxed I forget to fish! As a wise man on this site told me recently, it isn't always about the catching! Too much scenery, fellowship, and exploring to do if the fish are not biting. Going O-fer is part of the deal, it is still better than golf! Ha!"
6352360,tyeegs,2019-08-23 07:08:00,177,Almost skunked in East Bay on Red Lake in early August but then caught a rock bass which I fed to an Eagle. Turned my day around.
6352368,The tank,2019-08-23 07:32:00,340,"I have once. I had 3 walleyes to the boat all 3 was over 20"" but I didnt get any of the 3 in the boat. The very next day it was after 3pm before I finally got fish in the boat. I was starting to wonder what I was doing."
6352418,AsianAngler,2019-08-23 09:25:00,67,"We went fishing for the first time since buying a cabin on Lake of the Woods during July. We fished shallow, deep, and everything in between. We would catch one or two fish and then nothing. Finally, thinking that maybe it was because we didn't know the lake that well, my husband went out with a guide for a day. Our neighbor (long time resident), says this guy is one of the best in the area. My husband said that it was the same with the guide. The guide said that other guides had told him it had been slow lately, but he said it was one of the worst days fishing he ever had. Instead of being in their usual summer spots grouped up, the fish were scattered and in many different depths. Locals think it has something to do with the rusty crayfish population explosion in the lake. We did catch a couple of crayfish hanging onto our baits. Honestly, we hope it was just a fluke... Saw maybe one or two people come in with 2 or more decent sized fish. Reports on other parts of the lake earlier in the season said that people were catching lots of big walleyes, so we know that they are still there.... somewhere."
6352560,martinbns,2019-08-23 17:10:00,1520,"I live in Canada and it happens occasionally. That's why they call it fishing not catching. A buddy of mine bought a 2013 Tyee this year, it took him three trips out to catch anything and his wife 5 little trips."
6352600,Lmbkiller,2019-08-23 20:43:00,639,"Rustys have been thick on low since the late 90s, nothing new there. Many of the big lakes in Ontario and Manitoba have some kind of invasives. It will only get worse"
6352714,Sportdog,2019-08-24 10:18:00,6735,"This year was a rough one in Canada for us. Fished all the spots where I had success in the past and could only manage one eye per spot. Tried deep, shallow, weeds, points, inside turns, humps, flats, etc etc. Finally found fish in a most unlikely spot the last day. Lot of expense for such poor fishing. I can do that at home. Lol!!!"
6352724,WallyWarrior,2019-08-24 11:59:00,2488,We had good fishing but much slower than the past. Weather was crazy bad though. Water temp dropped 10 degrees the two days before we got there. No one got blanked but def slower. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6353042,Sportdog,2019-08-25 22:44:00,6735,"Surface water temp was by far the warmest I’ve experienced there. Funny thing is that we FINALLY had a great day it was on a huge rocky/weedy flat in 4-5 foot of water......To show you how scattered they were, I caught one Walleye in 60 foot of water messing around showing my wife how to use a baitcaster/BB rig on a bare single hook spinner.....crazy!!!"
6353054,jfaisten,2019-08-26 04:46:00,1060,"After spending a week in Canada and a lot of money, you can take 4 or 5 (can't remember exactly) walleyes back home. I fished Venice Louisiana for redfish and trout and brought back 2/3 of a cooler full of fillets. Grilled them all that summer. To each his own of course."
6350918,reconssd,2019-08-17 16:15:00,147,"We just got back from Gullrock lake. I had something happen to me on that lake that I didn't think was possible in Canada. Last Saturday, the skunk was in the back of the boat for the entire day. In 22 years of going to Canada, I've never not caught a fish on a single day. Other than the torture from my fishing buddies, and having to fish the next day with a Snoopy rod and reel, it was a great time. The fish gods did have mercy and allowed me to catch the largest northern of the trip - 40. So with all this being said, who else has been skunked on a Canadian lake?"
6350936,ILScott,2019-08-17 18:06:00,139,Had a member in our group this year that has been going to Canada since 70's or 80's and he also got skunked.
6350972,jfaisten,2019-08-18 04:18:00,1060,"I took 3 trips to Canada, 2 were horrible fishing and the last one the bugs were so bad we had to leave. My buddies and I have fished all over the US in both salt and fresh water. The trips to Canada were to very well regarded lakes -- I can understand the bugs, it happens if you're unlucky. But the fish not biting in two different lakes a couple years apart defies the odds."
6350978,tv4fish,2019-08-18 05:36:00,2694,UMMMM - Did you remember to put a hook on the end of your line??????? Sorry - But you probably KNEW this was going to be asked.
6351002,Bill Krejca,2019-08-18 07:16:00,6107,"Just a thought re: skunked - As we continue to ""mature"", some of us guys develop a scent on our hands (and elsewhere) which can be repulsive to fish. For that reason, if they are not jumping in the boat for me, I try a little scent on my baits - not necessarily to ""attract"" the fish, but rather to not repel them. I believe this can be a partial explanation why kids and ladies sometime out fish the guy ""expert"" in the back of the boat. Jis sayin' BIll"
6351124,KSjim,2019-08-18 16:19:00,88,"Started fishing yearly in Canada in 1992, would have had the same response until 2016. My son and I was on a fly-in lake in Manitoba (Aikens) mid June. Cold front conditions made it tough but hey we are in Canada. Not only did we have a hook in the water ( mostly jig and minnow), we fished hard all day. At 5:30 pm we had caught 4 walleye for the day, all by my son. We were supposed to head back in at 6:00. At 5:50 I caught a very skinny, 36"" Northern. Wow, what a relief for both of us! Way too close to being skunked in Canada!!"
6351140,sagecreek,2019-08-18 18:15:00,24,"i feel your pain. this june I was on gullrock, the lake I lived on and fished constantly, for almost 30 years, and I had an outing that lasted 4 hours before I gave up and went back to camp, never got a BITE.that being said, I sit here having just come home from a trip to gullrock and I caught fish after fish on the drop offs in 24 to 30 feet of water. Gullrock is the lake to go to but this year has been weird and all the locals are wondering what is happening."
6351172,46Harley,2019-08-18 22:12:00,149,It's happened to me more than a couple of times. You do this long enough and you will get your turn.
6351202,vteye3,2019-08-19 07:09:00,496,"Experienced anglers especially on remote waters figure every day is going to be a day ofcatching rather than fishing. I think modern electronics helps. I agree BK scent can be key: bug spray, soap/detergent used at camp. I am guessing you did not have electronics? I have been skunked on my home pike, bass waters before."
6351466,prov1900,2019-08-20 06:41:00,544,It's happened to me (#metoo) I think sometimes I get so keyed up I forget to relax and fish.
