6355364,russelltea,2019-09-03 10:21:00,1,Years ago (1980's) we used to island camp around Falcon Island on LOTW. We would then break camp if necessary and search out a new location. Is this still allowed at all and specifically for U.S. citizens?
6355372,The tank,2019-09-03 10:26:00,340,Not sure where that is but I've seen campers on islands in little traverse and milesbay.
6355564,Bill Krejca,2019-09-03 17:56:00,6107,"Rules have changed a bit since the 1980's. you now need a day permit, limits are reduced for campers, some areas are off limits. As i have not camped LOW for some time, they may have changed more. I suggest you get hold of DNR folks and get the latest on what is legal. Waking up in a tent on an island and opening the flap in the cool morning is one of the finest of life's experiences, have fun!! Bill"
6355580,Huntindave,2019-09-03 19:14:00,2194,"?? can you expand on this? When I purchase my Ontario fishing license, I've never been asked if I am camping."
6355660,Bill Krejca,2019-09-04 06:37:00,6107,"Dave - as I said, the rules may have changed since my last camping experience. I think I remember if camping the limit was the same as a conservation licence. Since my last camping was in the 1990's, it may be that I just remembered wrong, been apt to do that. For a period of time, it seemed that every year or so the camping rules were changed, which is why I strongly recommend checking with someone who is clear on what is OK this year. I only mentioned this so that you can be aware, after conversing with the right folks, I'd hate for your trip to be messed up, happened to me long ago. Luckily, officer was understanding enough to allow getting back to civilization to obtain proper permits, I wouldn't count on this, so just suggesting you understand present rules and what is required. Bill"
6355676,Baseline,2019-09-04 07:11:00,3207,"Check the MNR regs. There are ""red zones"" where camping is permitted for Ontarior Citizens only. The Red Zones is basically the southern part of northwestern Ontario from the Minnesota / Lake Superior border north to Hwy 17. There are other ""red zones"" splatters around the northwestern part of the Province. US citizens camping in areas where camping is allowed must purchase camping permits for each person @ $12 per night and are restricted to conservation fish limits.PS I guess they currently call the restricted areas ""green zones"""
