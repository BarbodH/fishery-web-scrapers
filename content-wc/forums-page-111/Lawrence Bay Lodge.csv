6356038,Guest,2019-09-05 13:04:00,0,"I have gone there for the last 13 years. The pike and trout fishing are great, but there are few walleye to be caught. The lodge, hosts guides and food are great. An added plus is that you can drive from Saskatoon to Southend for the float plane ride to the lodge. Bob"

In general can you tell us if it a hundred pike day but middle size? Or more like a few trophies? Is it more numbers or trophies? How do you fish the trout? I'd just like a sense of the type of fishing you could expect for $4000. Thanks, Brett"

We have caught 12 pike bigger than 50 inches over the past 13 years. Our biggest were 52 inches (2). We use Dixie divers and spoons for trout. Bob"
