6357462,eyecatcher1,2019-09-11 07:28:00,323,"Years ago I launched in Hudson, but for the past 20 years or so I launch at Deception. It's a little closer to where I usually fish, I think."
6357464,prov1800,2019-09-11 07:34:00,5010,Both will meet up.It depends on wind.sometimes coming out if deception can be wild.lol.either way it's lac suel and great fishing.
6357168,prov1800,2019-09-10 08:24:00,5010,Well spent the last 2 days of my guiding season on Lac Suel.Had a couple of old guests that always come this time of the year.We fished Cedar Lake on Friday which was also a excellent day of fishing and then Sat/Sun Lac Suel out of the public launch in Scout Bay.Fishing was fantastic as usuall on that walleye factory.Lake doesn't disappoint to often.Weather was decent so no complaints there except for Sunday mornings ride out at 0c.That was a cool one.Fishing seemed best both days in around 22 ft catching all sizes and a number of smallmouth bass and whitefish as well.Got checked out by the OPP for the first time in 2 years and had 2 very friendly officers.Lake was very queite and didn't see many boats out.
6357322,eyecatcher1,2019-09-10 17:56:00,323,I'm heading to the Sioux Lookout part of Lac Seul Saturday.
6357324,prov1800,2019-09-10 18:07:00,5010,Good luck.thexwest end is very good as I am sure the east end to.are you staying on the lake or launching daily.
6357326,eyecatcher1,2019-09-10 18:18:00,323,"I've been staying on Abram Lake for 27 years now. 2 or 3 times a year. On the good days I fish Lac Seul and if the weather is bad I stay close to the cabin and fish Abram, Minnitaki or Pelican Lakes. There's good fishing there, just not as good as Lac Seul."
6357342,prov1800,2019-09-10 18:44:00,5010,I fish there a number of times and find minitaki pretty good.my wife wife works in Sioux and stays on abram lake which is also very good just not many fisherman give it a chance.i personally can do very well as well as pelican.have a great week.
6357344,eyecatcher1,2019-09-10 18:53:00,323,I've had good fishing in all three of those lakes too. When the wind is blowing I stay there rather than run up 30 miles on Lac Seul.
6357352,prov1800,2019-09-10 19:08:00,5010,Launch in Hudson.better closer to good fishing.
6357364,JDP,2019-09-10 19:33:00,1457,Nice report John. Thanks for your information over the season!
6357370,prov1800,2019-09-10 19:54:00,5010,"heres a couple of more pics from weekend on Lac Suel,Notice my sonar depth in the one picture.Thats was the best depth.No need to go deep.Usually all small fish deep."
