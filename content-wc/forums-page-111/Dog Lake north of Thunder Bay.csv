I'm good for any type of fish but love fishing for northern most.One more thing if not Dog Lake , any other close by that would rent a cabin?Thanks!"

6341800,Rebel8,2019-07-17 14:56:00,49,"Try Lac Des Mille Lacs 1.5 hrs (65 mi) west of Thunder Bay. Been going there for 15 years 56,000 acres but all islands and bays no real big open water areas. Fishable somewhere every day. The lake has walleyes and notherns no Musky some smallies. I prefer fishing the far west end and stay at Lac Des Mille Lodge lacdesmille.com it is more remote than the other camps and a little more rustic. I have also stayed at Thunderbird resort. The other notable camps on the lake are Cushing lake resort, Open Bay Lodge, and the biggest being Pine Point resort (probably the most modern but I would say Open bay is a close 2nd in that department if it matters). Pine Point and Open bay are both located in the middle of the lake. Personally I feel the west end has much less pressure. I was there the week of June 8th and we killed the walleyes and northern. Some days we fished within a mile of the resort, other days we traveled for the fun of it and caught all over. Feel free to PM me if you want any more info on the lake or resorts."
