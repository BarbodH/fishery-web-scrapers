I would like to setup a Nipigon River trip for him either this fall, or early spring next year to get into some nice brook trout. Does anyone have any info on what time of year would work best to try the Nipigon, and also some recommendations for places to stay? I'd be bringing a boat and just looking for inexpensive lodging somewhere close to where I would have public access to the river. Thanks - Justin"

The Lodge has great accommodations, the keeper Ray is a really super guy, will insure you have a great time and have everything you need . He fixed me up with Gord Ellis, a master fishing and hunting guide who also has a weekly radio show and is editor of a hunting/fishing mag out of Thunder Bay. From what others have said, his other guides are pretty awesome too, just don't know their names. 807-886-2603. The Nipigon is a very fast and quite risky body of water if you've never been on it before. I don't recommend it but maybe I'm just a Wussy"
