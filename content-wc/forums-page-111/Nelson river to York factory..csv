6357824,KSjim,2019-09-12 09:01:00,88,Wow! If you have any history buff in you at all that would be a great trip. When we fished at Nueltin Lake we got to visit the remains of the Hudson Bay Trading Post at Windy River. We planned on just taking a few minutes to walk around it but we ended up staying over an hour.
