6355694,Slim03,2019-09-04 08:17:00,159,We are staying at Lost Island Lodge.
6355726,eyecatcher1,2019-09-04 10:09:00,323,"I'll be at Red Pine Lodge, so maybe I'll see you on the water. I'm in a red Ranger. Good luck!"
6355744,Slim03,2019-09-04 11:36:00,159,I will be in a blue tyee.
6355764,eyecatcher1,2019-09-04 13:26:00,323,"I'll look for you when I'm on Lac Seul then, which will be most days. I also always wear a Detroit Red Wings hat. Just in case you see more than one red Ranger. LOL!"
6356244,ameoba,2019-09-06 09:25:00,105,"As others stated - the big challenges are a) Finding a place to stay (lots of stuff closed) b) Finding live bait We were up there (Winnipeg River) in the middle of October last year and got a foot of snow one day. The fishing can be amazing, and it can be terrible. The weather is the same way. Just be prepared for an adventure, roll with the punches, and you will have some amazing memories!"
6356324,Guest,2019-09-06 13:14:00,0,"I tend to jig a 3/8oz lead with 5"" twister tipped with 1/2 or 1/3 of a frozen minnow. The fish can be everywhere in the fall- still holding on to their 25' rock structure but also in the 14' range and even in the 5-6' range. Without the minnow, my catch rate was terrible."
6356440,Fishwitit,2019-09-07 01:11:00,46,Fall is the best time for big fish. People think post spawn is. But there is nothing like when water temps drop and the lake starts to turn over the big fish really go on a feeding frenzy.
6355030,BornToFish,2019-09-02 06:16:00,1224,"Greetings,I fished a lake years ago that regularly established a thermocline. This lake would turn over anytime from mid-September to early October. I noticed that the ten days or so prior to turnover were often magical in terms of big pike and muskies. In the years that my timing was ""right"", I would find them in the shallows (in bays receiving wind) during the afternoons. By shallows, I mean the inner weed edges - five fow or so. I would throw big profile stick baits and move them SLOWLY, with frequent pauses. My top pike and muskies were caught with this pattern.If you are before the ten day window, the pike and muskies will likely be in their traditional summer haunts - humps and deep edges. If you are there after turnover, they might be just about anywhere.September has long been my favorite month for walleye fishing. I focus on the off-shore rock humps. Each year seemed to be different in terms of preferred depth, but most often would find them in around 30 fow on the sides of the humps. The walleye's preferred depth in the water column often widens in autumn as the temperature gradient from top to bottom is minimal. That is, 24 feet down is about the same as 32 feet down in the water column.One thing about fishing in September is the concept of ""SLOW"" is a key to success. By slow, I mean boat control and presentation. The fish often will not chase.As others mentioned, the weather can be the very best of the best, or the very worst or the worse, and you can have both in the same day. Bugs are pretty much gone, along with other boat traffic.Have a great trip!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6355064,Bakefish,2019-09-02 08:27:00,1077,"I can tell you that my duck hunting clothes are definitely adequate for fishing. Most of my duck hunting is/was done on Lake Michigan where the men are separated from the boys. I wear these same clothes while ice fishing. I wear merino wool base as well as insulated goretex as well as heavy pack boots. Full coverage face mask is part of the deal. I'm 68 years old with rheumatoid arthritis and just not as angry with the fish as I once was. As I've noticed while duck hunting, you just don't see as many geezers out there once the weather gets to the extremes. Don't assume that I'm ill prepared and not smart enough to use ""my experience over the years"" to successfully fish in extreme weather. Another thing...big difference from early 60's to late 60's, and I'm guessing it's not going to get any better. If you pass that barrier without ill effects, then good on you. Kick their butt."
6355350,SteveZ,2019-09-03 09:23:00,271,"We go every year somewhere from mid September to the 1st week in October. Last year we went in October. We had 9"" of snow overnight on one day. Low's in the high 20's to low 30's. We had a couple of days it didn't get above 45. The fishing was crazy good and there was no other boats to be seen. We leave on the 13th of September and will fish from the 14th to the 20th. Fishing should be great again this year."
6355362,eyecatcher1,2019-09-03 10:06:00,323,We'll be there September 14-21. I haven't done a fall trip for 4 years now so I'm really looking forward to it.
6355406,SteveZ,2019-09-03 11:48:00,271,Where are you headed?
6355408,eyecatcher1,2019-09-03 11:52:00,323,"Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout. The resort is on Abram Lake, but we mostly fish Lac Seul. If the weather is bad we'll stay close and fish Abram, Minnitaki or Pelican. Where are you heading?"
6355410,SteveZ,2019-09-03 11:56:00,271,We will be fishing the English River below Lac Suel at Ear Falls. The fall run has the walleyes stacked up at the dam. Some of the best fishing I have ever experienced.
6355434,eyecatcher1,2019-09-03 12:57:00,323,"I've never been there, always the east part of Lac Seul. I don't think that there are any bad spots on Lac Seul though. Fishing has been great for me for the past 27 years!"
6355650,Slim03,2019-09-04 05:58:00,159,Headed upto the east side of Lac Seul on the 15th. Never been up there this late and looking forward to it.
6355680,eyecatcher1,2019-09-04 07:34:00,323,You'll love it! Where are you staying Slim03?
6354868,mms3rd,2019-09-01 11:05:00,148,"Hey, I've finished northern Minnesota in late fall but never Canada....latest trip was mid-August. Hoping to go up sometime during last two weeks in September or first week in October. Looking to be couple hundred miles into Ontario. One issue might be finding camps that are open. But wondering about the bite....walleyes, bass, northerns. Do you fish deep? Shallow? Slow down presentations? I assume the chance of cold, sleet, etc. is much greater. Any pointers? Suggestions on camps (for 1 guy most likely). PM on resorts if you want. Thanks"
6354882,Walleye2242,2019-09-01 12:09:00,263,"For me lat fall in Canada is my favorite. Beautiful colors, no bugs and not alot of people. The weather can get you at times. pack for everything. The fishing is good. I have had the most luck with slow jig presentations. Maybe drift troll over areas to find them and then post up and slow jig. I also have had alot of luck with floating jig rig with a minnow. Found the best depth was 18 to 24 feet or so. That was just has worked well for me. I am sure things can be different on any lake in certain areas. I was on Gullrock and like to go the 3rd week of sept."
6354884,eyecatcher1,2019-09-01 12:16:00,323,My wife and I used to go to NW Ontario every year for our anniversary trip. Mid to late September. We've had 80* days and once snow. Usually somewhere in between though. We usually target walleyes and pike and the fishing is always great. We were talking today about heading up there in a few weeks.
6354898,Bill Krejca,2019-09-01 13:55:00,6107,"Conditions pretty much as stated above. It can get on the cold side. Most camps seem to close the end of Sep, perhaps those who are open for hunting could accommodate you. Re: presentations - deep and slow. It is the most beautiful time of the year up there, have furn and give us a report when you get back. Bill"
6354918,mixedbag,2019-09-01 15:32:00,76,"Come August I default to trolling cranks as my go to. Have various options that will go from 5' to 40' running clean (ie no weights). Start off at a new week of fishing at 20' and adjust as required. Once you get dialed in, that depth should hold until a major weather shift. The one fallback rig I carry is a slow death set up when the eyes are dicks and will only take a slower more subtle presentation.The above approach has served me reliably for the past 15 years of early thru to late fall fishing. Mid October is musky time but, if I want to stack odds for eater walleye, I'll rationalize jigging a blade bait at times to 50' around midlake reefs."
6354938,Bakefish,2019-09-01 17:07:00,1077,"I'm heading up in two weeks. Always look forward to my fall trips. Last year was another story altogether. Went up the first week of October and was greeted by snow. No biggie, I've got great duck hunting clothes that work just fine for fishing. After several days of snow and/or freezing weather I'd had it. Ended up leaving a day early. Fishing was brutal, and catching was even more brutal. We did boat a 50"" musky on our last day, but the weather got the best of us. Just getting too old for that. 3 years ago it was in the 70's in late September, so you never know."
6354976,mms3rd,2019-09-01 19:53:00,148,"Glad you all knew I meant ""fished"" and not ""finished."" Though as a native Minnesotan, I've come close to being finished. Canada has spoiled me."
6354980,NARDA 1,2019-09-01 19:59:00,636,Sent you a PM.
6355016,mixedbag,2019-09-02 04:56:00,76,"If you are gonna fish Oct ""duck hunting"" clothes aint gonna cut it as your go to cold weather wear. In your case, the weather didn't get the ""best of you"" â€¦...the lack of proper clothes did you in.Ive experienced temps from mid 70's to below freeze. My cold weather wear is ice fishing suitable and Im good into prime Musky Nov time. You need merino wool base and insulated gore tex. Full face mask, goggles for shootin the lake and thick well made mitts. Think deer stand in Dec.If you have the right clothes and gear, the fishing can be outstanding right before ice up. Moreover, keepin the beer cold is rarely an issue.Dont know how old you are but Im into my '60's and Im not getting ""too old for that""...instead, using my experience over the years to deal with it"
6355026,orchard frank,2019-09-02 05:49:00,1900,"Some of our trips to LIL were the last 2 weeks of Sept. As mentioned, weather can be quite variable. Fishing can be unbelievable. Find the right reef, and the big smallies are stacked and biting. Walleyes and pike are all over the place, might be shallow or deep, but hungry. Current areas draw the walleyes, pike follow. If it was windy, we tended to find a likely spot and anchor, let the roaming fish come to us."
