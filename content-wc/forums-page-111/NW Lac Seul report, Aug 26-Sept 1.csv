We have fished this same week for several years and this was the worst weather week we have had. Windy every day but half of our last day, and rain more days than not. Water temp in the mid 60's F, which is lower by 5 degrees or so than is normal for us. We do normally like to spend most of our time in McKenzie Bay, but because of the wind were not able to venture very far into the Bay, or even get there a couple days. We did find fish at some of our usual spots, but it seemed like most spots were holding fewer fish than we are used to, and only 1 boat got into numbers of fish on 1 spot for part of 1 day. Also, it seemed like we caught a fish or 2 in almost any spot we stopped. We caught more pike than usual and even caught a few lake perch this trip. The pike were mostly smaller, and we do usually catch 1-3 pike around 40"" incidentally every year. Had a few smallmouth mixed in, but this is always very hit or miss for our group. Also caught a sauger this year, and I don't think we have caught more than 4 or 5 of those in 15 or so trips. We caught fish from 3-25' and didn't really fish deeper (or shallower). Almost exclusively jig fished, but did catch a couple fish on cranks (mostly just because I like to pull crankbaits) and I don't think our group caught a fish with a spinner rig. Used both minnows and crawlers, but as usual didn't see a big difference between the two. I personally don't think jig color matters much, but I do like to fish with bright colors in darker waters like Lac Seul. Biggest walleye was 27 1/2"" but we really missed the numbers of 23-26"" fish this trip. Good number of 20-22"" and way more fish smaller than 16"" than usual. We don't keep count year to year, but it seems like we're usually above 50 fish per boat per day with some much better days thrown in, but this year we struggled with numbers, with only 30-50 per day per boat this year. We again stayed with Doug and Gayle at Gawley's Little Beaver, and as usual they are great hosts. Exceptionally clean cabins and fish house, free ice, free launching/docking, and electricity at the dock. Although their home was lost in a fire last winter, they are taking reservations for next year. Our group is extremely glad they have decided to retain ownership and remain open. I wish them much better luck than they have had in the last few years and am already looking forward to seeing them and fishing Lac Seul again next summer!"

6357402,TRapperJones,2019-09-10 21:27:00,36,We were up there the 24th to 30th and found the same thing...caught several saugers...seems like the better fishing from what I have heard is on the south and eastern sides of the lake this year
6357416,MikeinMN,2019-09-10 23:19:00,190,"I forgot to mention that we crossed the border in International Falls without incident or delay both ways. We then took 71 instead of 502/594 because it was raining very hard and we were not sure about construction zones and lack of pavement in the heavy rain. I think the 71 route added about 30-45 minutes to the drive. Hard to say though as there was some construction we had to stop for on 71 and also on 17. Also of note, one of our boats was stopped by the OPP in McKenzie Bay. First time being checked on Lac Seul for our group. The officer was polite and it was a quick stop. He commended the guys on wearing life jackets and said there were several drownings on Lac Seul this year. Our group was not aware of that. He also asked if there were any submerged rocks he should be careful of. Not sure if he was joking or not about the submerged rocks. Was kind of surprised the OPP were out this time of year with not very much boat traffic out there, and also surprised there was no MNR officer in the boat."
