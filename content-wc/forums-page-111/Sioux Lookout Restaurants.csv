6355328,Guest,2019-09-03 08:50:00,0,The best restaurants are owned/started by Don Fraiser. Don is one of the best cooks in Canada and has opened many restaurants. Incredible attention to detail as is evidenced by how he takes care of himself
6355340,prov1800,2019-09-03 08:59:00,5010,For something different maybe give moosehorn lodge a call.They have some great dining going on there.If you called ahead let them know they would fit you in.
6355352,David Anderson,2019-09-03 09:42:00,2073,"Great thread. We arrived in Sioux Lookout on the evening of Monday May 20th, Victoria Day. The only place that was open was the New Kowloon restaurant, limited refreshments but the food and service was good. I didn't think the Canadians took their British heritage that serious with everyone else closed but then again it's a day off!"
6352650,bellbuoy,2019-08-24 03:23:00,490,"If arriving on a Sunday your choices are pretty limited, Wellington Centre is the only place open."
6353030,Beagle_Nut,2019-08-25 20:33:00,52,"We'll probably go mid-week some time so Sunday shouldn't be an issue. I was concerned that many places might close down come September due to the end of the main tourist season, something we ran into when we stayed near Sioux Narrows / Nestor Falls."
6353302,Windy City,2019-08-26 17:32:00,58,"I will be flying up to Sioux Lookout for a weeks worth of Musky fishing (Sept. 9-15) and it will be my first time there, or in Canada. Are you guys exchanging US for Canadian currency for use there? Is there somewhere in SL convenient to do so? Using CC most of the time? Any other tips or pointers? Thanks"
6353320,Fishwitit,2019-08-26 18:23:00,46,"Wellington has new owners in the past few months its went way down hill. Dicks has good food but service is sub par. No complaints about forest. Foxy at Andersonâ€™s, is high end good quality food, with good service but you pay for it. Menu is also limited."
6353342,Guest,2019-08-26 20:02:00,0,No brainier Strip Joint it is! Bring plenty of US dollars! Guessing they love that
6353430,eyecatcher1,2019-08-27 07:01:00,323,"If you can use a credit card you'll get a better exchange rate if your CC company figures the exchange rate. Some resorts don't take a CC, but I think that every other business around town does. If you're going to use cash exchange it at your bank in the states."
6353480,bigwalleye1,2019-08-27 09:36:00,2632,I'm guessing you get 32% more booty for the American buck....
6353482,CI_Guy,2019-08-27 09:37:00,2118,The resorts I stay at have all accepted CC so I use the card for everything I can. The exchange rate is better than at any bank I've used. I tip in US money and don't carry any Canadian money.

Actually, when we've planned to go to one, we've ended up at another because your first choice may be closed (happens often). I have not tried the Wellington yet but I have heard good things although the parking looks like a challenge with a big pickup like mine.Hope this helps, best of luck and have a great time up there!LM"
6353662,Windy City,2019-08-27 19:40:00,58,"Didn't want to high jack, but thanks all that answered."
6352250,Beagle_Nut,2019-08-22 16:48:00,52,"Anybody have a recommendation for one of the restaurants in Sioux Lookout? Wife and I will be staying in the area for the first time 9/8-18 and usually take one day to 'go to town' for shopping and a meal out. Not looking for anything fancy, some place I can get a beer would be nice. Thanks"
6352338,eyecatcher1,2019-08-23 06:25:00,323,"I've been to the Wellington and it was good, but the owner of the resort where I stay says the Forest Bar and Grill is the best in the area. I'll give it a try next time."
6352346,bigwalleye1,2019-08-23 06:41:00,2632,"Choices are sort of limited in the area. The menu looked good at Foxy's at the Anderson resort complex, but the prices made me buy my own fillet and shrimp in the states and do a surf and turf at the lodge where we stay."
6352348,eyecatcher1,2019-08-23 06:49:00,323,"Foxy's is very good, but you're right very expensive. A friend went to Dick's Grillhouse or whatever it's called now and said that it was good, but very expensive too. Knobby's was the best up there, but that burned a few years ago."
6352352,jimirjr,2019-08-23 07:00:00,1149,Forest Inn is OK.... Kinda limited Menu but nice atmosphere and nice staff.. Check it out on Google Maps.. As well as the other choices in S.L.
6352440,Bstar,2019-08-23 09:52:00,564,We ate at the Forest Inn a couple of years ago. It was just alright average fare. We were there on a Saturday and the lounge was closed?
6352474,wmd,2019-08-23 10:47:00,388,"We have eaten at Forest Inn and Dick's both are OK, nothing fancy. We seem to have settled on Dick's. wmd"
6352502,rockape,2019-08-23 12:27:00,215,"I've eaten at just about every place in Sioux Lookout. I actually ate at the Forest Inn for the first time this year. I'd say it is the best in town, but not incredible. I eat at the Wellington at least once a year. Pretty good food, but no alcohol. 5th Avenue. Is it still open? Bottom of the list for sure. I think Dick & Nellies was closed this year. Drove by it a couple of times and it was empty and dark."
6352556,eyecatcher1,2019-08-23 16:11:00,323,Is 5th Avenue still a strip bar in the evenings? I used to go up there for opening day and the younger guys in the group discovered that there was a strip bar in the back in the evenings. I did have breakfast there once on a bad weather day and it wasn't bad.
6352606,Sniper1980,2019-08-23 21:02:00,33,Yea those big native girls still strut their stuff out there.
