Main target was crappies, we did very well on them, although we got more smaller ones this year than in the past ,rather interesting, largest was 15"", 12-1/2"" were very common. Fish were deep, as usual for this time of year, and very slow to bite, special finesse was required in order to get them, if you moved almost at all (think ice fishing slow), the fish would not chase. We did well on walleyes, a number were in the 20's, perhaps a little better than in the past. We did hit, for that lake, several bonanzas, ""honey holes"", if you will, where walleye were taken rapid fire. We target the crappies, so walleye are considered a bonus, numerous other lakes maybe can be considered as more advantageous for purely walleye fishing if you discount the crappie. Of our 3 boats, two of ours used strictly artificials for the week, which is normal, and is all that is required. Had a light dusting of snow upon arrival, some sleet during the week, and a mild snow storm on Friday, enough to make the road going home early Sat. morning a bit slippery on a curve or two. Barely saw the sun all week, similar to last year, water was perhaps several inches higher, has precipitation every day. Leaf coloring seemed to be a little behind, also normally many more leaves usually hit the ground during our stay. Saw one partial sunset during the week, and no sunrises -did I mention that it was COLD all week? Caught the same crappie on the same bait twice within 10 minutes, so much for ""intelligence"" and learning, huh! One small muskie was caught, plus only a few pike, but we had several bite-offs, a few smaller small mouth were caught. This lake has some of the pure fattest fish in it, seems to indicate a very fertile water system. All in all, it was a great week, spent with good friends and relatives, fishing was superb, can't ask for much more than that!!"

6356942,kettyspanky,2019-09-09 13:04:00,271,Good to hear the crappie fishing was good. This lake is on my list of places to get to in the near future. Any perch? Very nice report.
6357252,Bill Krejca,2019-09-10 12:51:00,6107,"Nitro - stop over if you get a chance. Re: perch - we never targeted them, do end up with a few while fishing crappie. Bill"
6357476,prov1800,2019-09-11 07:52:00,5010,Plenty of perch.have to filter through them as you will catch all sizes.lots in the weed beds as well as deeper with the walleyes.i don't really target them either but do once in a while and can usually get into them.drop shot has seemed to be best with a weedles hook tied in.weed edges with deeper weeds have been best.like the weed contour in Hatfield bay has been good as a example.same on both West and East side weeds edges in time square. Did real well a week ago where the private cabins are on the east shoreline.back in the bay there.right as weed edge starts and the bay on West side were power line goes onto cedar lake lodge island.can go on and on but you will get the picture.tons of places like that.
