6353414,lotsoffish1,2019-08-27 06:38:00,49,Good job fishing . Some of guys on here have to be critical.
6353584,Limeyangler,2019-08-27 14:08:00,563,"I was thinking the same thing. I was the guy from here fishing with them on one of the days, yes, fishing was slow but considering how slow the fishing was and how horrible the weather was I dont think there was more than 1 minute all day where someone in the boat was not laughing. We can all pound fish, have 100+ fish days, but I would not trade up yesterday in the boat with this delightful family for anything. New languages were learnt, Super Grover and Poop jigs reigned, ""can we go back to Camp"" was heard many, many times, the sound of ripping rainwear still rings in my ears (dont ask, what happens in the boat stays in the boat), and toilet humor never gets old...lol. Video to follow."
6353656,TRapperJones,2019-08-27 19:20:00,36,Today was nothing but rain and lots of wind...I had 2 son's 15 years and 11 years old so didn't want to chance the trip to steamboat narrows with the bad waves. Ended with 3 walleyes and 1 pike. I marked 3 fish all day and caught all 3.
6353982,TRapperJones,2019-08-28 18:57:00,36,Today got 12 walleyes and 6 pike in 10 feet of water in a bay. Made a special day as my 11 year old son got his first pike and walleye ever in one hour of each other. Was able to coach him thru both...easily the best value of the trip.

6355752,fishingMN4eyes,2019-09-04 11:54:00,108,"Haven't had a chance to post since we got back Saturday. Not that there is much to report. We were up 8/26-8/30 dealing with high winds and rain basically every day. Never really found a consistent bite or depth range. Managed a three person limit with only two overs and had one meal of fish while we were there, that's about it. Bottom bouncers with Smile Blades, floaters, and crawlers probably produced the best mostly because that was the only presentation heavy enough to keep on bottom consistently. Caught a few on jig/minnow, jigging rap, and trolling crankbaits. We didn't even bother going out on Wednesday morning, we just went out after lunch to troll because we didn't feel like fighting the wind. Caught a couple for the box that way and my dad snagged a nice 26"" trolling. Made the mistake of trying to run to McKenzie on Thursday. Not only was it a rough ride down, our partner boat took out his prop and skeg on the first spot we stopped at so we barely fished while he stopped on shore to put a replacement prop on and then we chugged back to camp. Friday was the nicest/lowest wind day of the week and it was still pretty slow fishing(and windier than I thought it would be based on the forecast), it was after noon before I put a fish in the boat. I hope the weather has stabilized for anyone who is up there now. It was a tough fishing and weather week for our group."
6355790,TRapperJones,2019-09-04 15:22:00,36,Ditto...same for us...except Wednesday and Thursday I found a quiet bay close to the falls and found walleyes sitting on a shallow point 10 to 12 feet deep...caught em on jign minnow and jigging raps...also found pod of jumbo perch in same spot about 6 to 8 feet deep
6352736,Limeyangler,2019-08-24 12:42:00,563,"Hi all, Got up to William's bay again yesterday, it is the South central part of lac Seul. Fishing started slow on the humps but picked up, got into them on all the spots I tried. 24' to 30' for the bigger ones, weed edges in 10' to 15' on windswept shorelines for the smaller ones. Tried casting for pike, not really my thing, not a bite, but caught a few 25"" to 30"" pike on structure while fishing walleye. Large minnows with an 1/8 oz brown jig worked best although I caught them on a variety of colours. Tried out a jigging rap with success but minnows were King. Fishing picked up when a slight chop started late morning.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/vpF9gelBgdA"

6352810,TRapperJones,2019-08-24 20:42:00,36,Our pictures
6353032,TRapperJones,2019-08-25 21:05:00,36,Pics from today on nw lac seul south of steamboat narrows. 26 walleyes and 2 decent pike. Fish were in 17 to 30 foot of water...was getting really windy towards 1 pm so moved closer to camp to avoid bigger waves or could have gotten alot more
6353034,TRapperJones,2019-08-25 21:06:00,36,My 25 inch walleye today
6353322,Fishwitit,2019-08-26 18:25:00,46,Those are poor numbers for lac seul. You can catch that many five minutes from the deception bay landing.
6353330,Sniper1980,2019-08-26 19:17:00,33,Yes. We drive up and fish mostly within 300 yards of the deception landing for a week st8 and just POUND THEM
6353348,TRapperJones,2019-08-26 21:02:00,36,Well with hard winds and rain it isn't exactly easy going
6353350,TRapperJones,2019-08-26 21:04:00,36,Had a fellow walleye Central guy fishing with me today
