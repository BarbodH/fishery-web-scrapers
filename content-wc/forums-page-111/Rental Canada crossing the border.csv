6356732,reconssd,2019-09-08 08:15:00,147,"We always rent vehicles for Canada. Have never had a question about insurance. Once we had a question about the rental and had to show the paperwork. In my opinion, Renting is the way to go."
6356760,btyreprich,2019-09-08 12:45:00,1067,"I couldn't agree more. Drive in a newer car / truck with less that 36,000 miles on it. Never have to worry about mechanical issues other than a flat tire. Enterprise has nice trucks! I'm at the point in my life where we buy good used cars for the family and keep until ""the wheels fall off"". Just kidding - I make sure the family cars are safe - but with our cars all getting close to 135,000 miles - I'm just concerned about using these on a vacation trip. Renting a car or pick up truck in our case is a whole lot cheaper than buying a newer used SUV."
6355560,mms3rd,2019-09-03 17:15:00,148,"If this has been covered in the past, sorry.I'm not even drinking.That should be rental car.Any issues taking a US rental car across the border and back? Only thing I found was that Canada required a Canadian proof of insurance card which is free.Another quick question....issues with checking a rod carrier for airline flight?Thanks"
6355592,The tank,2019-09-03 20:09:00,340,We rented a big SUV from our local ford dealer on year and it had dealer plates on it they never said anything.
6355596,martinbns,2019-09-03 20:52:00,1520,I have gone the other way with a rental and no issues either way.
6355602,btyreprich,2019-09-03 21:15:00,1067,My buddy and I now rent full size pickup trucks from Enterprise for our annual fishing trip to Lac Seul. Both of our personal SUVs are just getting too high of miles to even consider using them. We have NEVER been asked about the rental trucks. Just have the rental agreement in the vehicle with you. We told Enterprise where we were going and all they said was have a good time. Of course we also notified our insurance agents and they said the same thing. Don't worry - enjoy your trip. (LOVE those full size pickups for cabin room / features / ability to haul all of our gear in the bed.)
6355608,elway12,2019-09-03 22:16:00,335,I have never been asked about rental car insurance going to Canada. We rent out of MSP airport and drive thru Pigeon River into Canada and never have been asked in 6 trips over the span of 12 years.We always fly Southwest Airlines and our rod tube of 80 inches is within their 91 in guidelines. No issues.
6355684,Mojo-NC,2019-09-04 07:37:00,1929,"We always rent a vehicle and we have been asked about it. I can't remember if they ever asked to actually see our rental agreement or not, but bottom line is they don't really care. It's just one of the questions they ask so they can listen to your accent when you speak to see if it matches where you live."
6355740,mms3rd,2019-09-04 11:04:00,148,"Any experience with this? Especially any additional cost. I'll be on Southwest. (long, cylinder type)"

Fishing rod containers may measure up to three inches in diameter and 91 inches in length.B-"
6355958,elway12,2019-09-05 07:50:00,335,"We have checked a ""bazooka"" brand rod tube everytime we have went to Canada with no issues. In and out of Phoenix, AZ and MSP on Southwest. It's bigger than 3in diameter but they have never said anything or charged us."
6355966,Mojo-NC,2019-09-05 08:18:00,1929,They will also allow you to tape several of the rod tubes together and only count them as one checked bag. I think they limit it to three max. We fly Delta. We use the Bazuka rod carriers extended long enough to fit several 7' rods.
