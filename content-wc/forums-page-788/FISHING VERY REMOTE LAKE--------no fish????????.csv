543321,Trailerguy,2004-09-15 14:31:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Young fry of the year, of all types are frequently referred to as minnows by a lot of people. But some species of bait fish never attain large size. I've never seen a Dace minnow that was more than a few inches long, as an example. These small species often times spawn over a longer period of time, unlike walleyes or pike that spawn only for a couple of weeks in the spring. As far as minnow lakes, you would have to supose that a minnow wishing to spawn could swim upstream farther than a larger fish, in a smaller of a stream of water. When I was a kid we had a windmill and a cowtank. Dad used to tolerate us kids ""stocking"" the tank with whatever small fish we caught. Until one time we came home with a bunch of bluegill fry. The little buggers swam up the waterstream, and down the pipe.They managed the plug the pump cylinder, needless to say he was not happy with us."

543210,Guest,2004-09-08 09:28:00,0,A fishing buddy of mine has been trying to get to a remote lake north of Lake Superior in Ontario . This lake is about 2 miles from lakes we are fishing that are loaded with lake trout and big pike. We are always looking for the next lake to try. You fellas and gals who fish remote lakes where you have to portage etc. know the work involved in going 2 miles thru the bush where there isn't any trail. He finally got to the lake--said there were many places where water was coming into the lake but couldn't find any river where it was running out. Lake is about a mile long and 3/4 miles wide. He saw minnows buy the hundreds but after fishing for 5 hours never caught a fish and he is a good fisherman. We are wondering what the deal is here. The small ones have to grow don't they. He said the lines on the fish were long ways not around like a perch. Any thoughts on what he found. He carried in a very small canoe with a 1.2 HP motor. thanks for any thoughts len in michigan
543232,Guest,2004-09-09 10:09:00,0,I've done a lot of this type of fishing over the years up in NW Ontario. Do you know how deep the lake was?
543235,Guest,2004-09-09 11:03:00,0,Good to hear from you Aaron.. Looks like not many are into this type of exploring and fishing most want a lodge etc. He said the lake was 20-30 feet deep to his best estimation. Have you fished north of the village of Pickle Lake up towards the Pipestone River??? Hope to h ear more from you. len in mich.
543237,Guest,2004-09-09 12:04:00,0,Barney was there the week before and fished her out...it happens a lot.
543242,Guest,2004-09-09 14:38:00,0,Barney is a drive in eat at the lodge fish with a guide type of a guy--no way Barney makes it back to this lake. I know he can catchem but he is to long in the tooth to make this trip.
543243,Guest,2004-09-09 15:14:00,0,Barney was flown in on his private Helicopter. He took his 30' Lund with him and he fished the Lake for two days. He now only fishs remote Lakes because he wants to save the easy spots for those less talented fisherman. The only bait he uses is cut up old Goodyear tires that he shapes into minnow like images. He is the best ...the very best.
543244,Guest,2004-09-09 15:22:00,0,HELLO CHARLIE BLUE My mistake I didn't realize Barney was a man of that means he must be with the GOP sporting that kind of green. My best to him. Our only hope in the future is to try to get to a new lake before he finds it. Barney you da man.
543272,Trailerguy,2004-09-12 19:05:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Minnow lakes are often at the top (farthest) end of a chain of lakes. Walleyes will swim upstream to the 1st blockage to spawn and then go back down stream. Pike will go over some blockages over time, such as beaver dams. Perch will go farther, up to a point. Minnows and suckers go the farthest, I've seen lake suckers go 15' up a rock wall in less than 1"" of flowing water before falling back down, and the lake above is full of minnows but no suckers ever get in. I've always figured lake trout got in to deep lakes back in glacial times, and died out of shallow lakes that are too warm. But I've never seen a lake in NWO that didn't have minnows in it at least."
543319,Guest,2004-09-15 13:52:00,0,Hello Trailerguy Thanks for the information very interesting thoughts. Are minnows just small fish that will grow into bigger fish or are some minnows just small fish that stay at a given size????
