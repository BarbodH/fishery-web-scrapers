Yeah, I know its only two years, but, I have done a ton of walleye fishing in WI, so has my group, many of which have gone to all parts of Canada fishing. All of us agree that Lac Seul is the best walleye lake in the world. As mentioned, fishing can be slow on Lac Seul, however, a slow day on Lac Seul is still 90% better than most lakes. Last year we slaughtered them. This year with the rain and cold weather all season, we had a hard time catching them. But, yes there is always a but, we did manage to get our limit every day, have great fish frys and make fond memories. We worked for them this year, but the hard work paid off. Lac Seul - good $hit."
543189,Guest,2004-09-06 19:47:00,0,News alert.... Lake is almost empty Already started restoration process Lake will be ready for fishing in 2010

543228,tly,2004-09-08 21:45:00,1900,"The lake is healthy (at least we do not glow in the dark) and in the 20+ years I have been going there we have always been satisfied. Ever since the 'conservation license' it has been an economic boon, we have always been catch/release except for shore lunches. The license rewards us for that. Am not sure where the nonsense about 1 fish and other negative stuff originates but our group will continue to go there. The *****ing is not reality. Set criteria, have a one on one comparison according to the criteria and then decide. TLY"
543302,Guest,2004-09-14 15:22:00,0,"We were at Lac Seul for four days over Labor day. The first day of the trip was one of my worst days fishing on Lac Seul. We were fishing to fast. We did much better the rest of the trip. Fish were pretty deep, 25' to 45'. The fish were also biting very lite compared to normal, we ended up using stingers when we were jigging and did the best on a bead with two hooks to get the tail biters. My boat ended up with seven 26"" eyes, four 27"", six, 28"", and one 30.5"". I've been fishing the lake twice per year for around five years, I dont know of a better drive to walleye lake. If there is a better one I'd like to hear about it."

543145,Guest,2004-09-02 13:29:00,0,"I'm not trying to be funny. On the lake I normally go to, we have our good years and others not as good. I don't think I have heard anything negative about Lac Seul. Would anybody share?"
543146,Guest,2004-09-02 13:39:00,0,"I believe that day in day out Lac Seul is one of the top Walleye fisherys in Canada. I have made several trips there in the last ten years and have never had a bad fishing week. Some not as good as others but never bad. There are lakes where we have caught more fish but most of them what I would call short fish (15"" and under). Lac Seul has a healthy population of good size Walleye (20"" to 25"") and in some years we catch many fish 25"" and bigger."
543152,Guest,2004-09-02 19:47:00,0,"I'VE FISHED QUITE A FEW SPOTS IN CANADA AND THE STATES AND LAC SEUL REMAINS AT THE TOP OF MY LIST. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CATCH ALOT OF,FISH THEY HAVE TO BE THERE.LAC SEUL HAS A GREAT POPULATION OF FISH.I ALSO THINK SOME ANGLERS GET TO SET IN THEIR WAYS,SOMETIMES SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS ALL IT TAKES TO FIND ACTIVE FISH AND MAKE THEM BITE. I FISHED THERE THIS SPRING IN 34 DEGREE TEMPS, STRONG NORTH WINDS AND DRIVING RAIN/HAIL AND WE KILLED THE WALLEYES IN 6 FT. OF WATER ON A WIND BLOWN POINT.(I KNOW THATS NO BIG SECRET BUT WE WERE THE ONLY BOAT THERE)ALL I KNOW IS WE'VE ALWAYS CAUGHT FISH THERE BE IT ON LIVE BAIT,CRANKS, SPINNERS OR PLASTICS. WHATEVER IT TAKES.REMEMBER TO CPR,THOSE BIG ONES TASTE LIKE CRAP ANYWAY."
543154,Guest,2004-09-02 20:23:00,0,They all lie.... Stay home and save your money. LS is beinig drained to repair the dam and to add additional structure to ensure the zebra mussel has suitable habitat to thrive.LS has a water clairity issue and it is thought the introduction of the zebra mussel will improve the overall system. Great carp lake!! Try it in 2015

543157,Guest,2004-09-03 06:33:00,0,Is there a size/slot limit on Lac Seul?
543158,Guest,2004-09-03 06:48:00,0,"Hump, You cant keep anything between 9"" and 36"" and your possesion limit is 1 fish for a week. You should go someplace else...it just isnt any fun or good on lac Seul."
543164,Guest,2004-09-03 13:12:00,0,Whit said it best! And Yes Hump the slot is 18-21 inches. You should CPR (catch photo release) everything over 18 though. Unless you like a high mercury content in your blood!
543167,Guest,2004-09-03 20:33:00,0,"Them fish ain't walleyes! What's wrong with all of you? Them are northern carparus which are a nuisance, hence the DNR work to improve the potential fishery. Heard snakehead fish might have worked their way into the system??? Might just be a rumor???"
543179,Guest,2004-09-06 06:51:00,0,There sure is a slot size..well sort of. If you can catch a catch and release fisherman. Photograph him and throw him up on the bank to feed the bears
