543273,Ruddiger,2004-09-12 19:27:00,649,"Hi, it is that time of year again where I begin planning my trips for the 2005 season and I need some help in selecting a lake and a lodge to stay at. I would like to drive from Ohio to western Ontario to fish one of these two lakes. My preference is to fish for muskies and pike, with some time being spent on walleyes and smallies. I am looking for a housekeeping cottage for two men. Since I bring my own boat quality and protected docking is also a MUST! The time of year is flexible depending on the species. Obviously if I was to go in early June my focus would be only for Pike, otherwise I was planning on something around mid July or august. I would like to do at least two weeks at a time and possibly book a couple of trips of this length over the summer. Having said all of that here are my questions: 1) Which of these two lakes do you reccomend for this type of fishing? Is one better than the other for size, action, or plain overall fishing in general. 2) Where do you recommend staying on the lake in order to access the best action during certain times of year? 3) Is there a peak season on these bodies of water when the fishing is best, and is there a time I absolutely need to avoid going there? 4) Where do you reccomend staying? I am very picky about where I dock my boat (years of therapy have not helped) and don't want to have my vacation ruined by constantly having to worry about the condition of my boat while it is in the dock. Where do you think I will find the best docking service? 5) Do either of these lakes have the potential for targeting pike EARLY in the season (with say a fly rod and waders)? I was thinking around the first week of June. As I said my main focus is for muskies and pike if I go later in the summer, and only pike if I go early in June. If you can think of any other lakes that I should consider other than Eagle and LOTW please let me know. Thanks in advance for your help and insights!"

543279,Guest,2004-09-13 13:10:00,0,If you want to catch lots of Big Fish go to Lac Barne. This is a trophy lake only. The Bullheads are gigantic!!!!
543284,fishmaster,2004-09-13 14:51:00,209,Eagle Lake is the choice. Check out www.vermilionbaylodge.com Nice housekeeping cabins run by a family that will take care of you.
543288,Guest,2004-09-14 04:48:00,0,"If I had my choice of lakes I would go to LOTW. Check out ""myliesplace.com"". go to weekly summaries, ""July 31-August 7"". Looks like a good place to consider. Let me know what you think."
543292,Guest,2004-09-14 07:21:00,0,"LOTW without question, multiple variety of fish and chance for a big fish in all species each time out. Black Island Resort is the best camp in the Morson area and is in the middle of the best walleye, muske and smallmouth fishing in the area and many tme do not have to boat more than a couple of minutes to catch them. Give them a call at 807-275-7482 (summer) 563-686-4245 (winter). The owners names are Barb & Mike Sergio. They will be happy to talk with you and provide you with any information you need. The facilities are first class as is the food and hospitality. I have been fishing from Black Island since 1978 and would go no where else."

We've tried a few over the last 10 years and have been to only one that last several years. If you want safe docking, they have it. If you want two weeks without breaking the bank, they got it. If you want the best fishing in the best area on Lake of the Woods. They are in the middle of it. Check out their website for muskie and nrothern action. I follow it closely when I can't be up there. More big northerns and muskies than ever before. We're talking about the resort that had guests catch 8 fish 50 inches or better in one week alone. Floating docks with 20 foot slips. A big section of docks set up as a harbor to break the wind. I've never been to a resort that does so much every year to improve on an already great place. Don't forget the best rates in Morson (and in CANADIAN FUNDS.) Been there 3 times this year. Wish I could get a place there all season long. Maybe someday.
