Put it in a tupperware container and store in the cooler."
542638,Guest,2004-08-16 07:10:00,0,Got a recipe for those butter tarts? Always get them while in Canada but forgot them this year! Thanks
542643,Guest,2004-08-16 10:15:00,0,I see many of you like to fry your walleyes in butter which is my favorite way. What I have found is that if you clarify your butter you can cook at a much higher temprature without burning the butter. Walleyes right out of the lake and fried to golden brown. Don't get any better.
542654,orchard frank,2004-08-16 21:17:00,1900,"After 30 yrs of Canadian trips, I honestly believe that a good shore lunch not only produces some of the best memories, it also helps the fishing. Getting out of the boat, relaxing, and THINKING about how your going to fish the rest of the day is tops. A little doze never hurt anyone either. Here's my secret... a couple of those folding chairs instead of using rocks, my wife and I even take a roll-up table, it all stashes in the bottom of the boat easily. I like the looks that we get as people motor by on Lac Seul, lots of thumbs up. If you see a scene like that 8/31--9/7, stop by for a bite, it will be our 16th trip in the last 12 yrs. Good Luck"
542662,Guest,2004-08-17 07:32:00,0,For you people that like to prepare your fillets the night before to save time. If your talking about Ontario when you put those fillets in the boat you are breaking the law! Better read the regulation.
542669,Guest,2004-08-17 09:55:00,0,"Foil broil is quick and easy and can be put together the night before. We semi-cook bacon strips, butter a square of aluminum foil, and layer onion, bacon, tomato, green pepper, add two pats of butter to the top with lemon juice and favorite seasonings, and wrap up foil real tight. Toss into the cooler and at lunch toss into the fire/embers and turn once. Outstanding and easy clean up. Make sure you keep no fish from morning fishing or you will be illegal. Haagy"
542676,Guest,2004-08-17 12:22:00,0,"I second the tin foil method for sliced potatoes, carrots, onions and mushrooms except I use an aluminum bake pan covered with foil. Much easier to use and you don't have to worry about juices falling out. Be sure to coat the pan with no-stick spray or butter. For The Fish use another bake pan sprayed with no stick spray. Layer the fillets in the pan, top with mayonaise (spread over the fish) sprinkle onions and parmesan cheese on top and season with Dill weed. cover and bake for 20 minutes on coals. Put the potatoes on before the fish (about 15 minutes) and also have a can or two of pork and beans along. We use paper plates and plastic utensils. If you haven't eaten fish like this before you are in for a treat. Also works well on the grill at home so the family can experience the shore lunch cusine minus the ambiance."
543285,Guest,2004-09-13 15:02:00,0,"Captain Waylie's Wild Rice Casserole. The ultimate side dish for any fishing trip. This recipe makes enough for four for three days and should be prepared the day before your trip. Soak 3 cups of wild rice in a large bowl of water till it starts to open' this can be done the night before. In a medium roasting pan bring to a boil at least twice and rinse with cold water between boiling to get all the swampwater out. Cut 1 1/2 lbs of bacon in small pieces ""about 1/2 "" wide and fry crispy Cut about 5 celery stalks into small pieces, about 3/8 of an inch and cut half an onion into small pieces and fry in a bit of bacon grease. Add the bacon,celery,onions, two cans of mushrooms""pieces and stems,one can of beef broth or consumme,one can of cream of mushroom soup and mix well. Sprinkle some soya sauce and mix again. Put in a 350 degree oven for half an hour uncovered until the top is browned... Pack in air tight containers and refridgerate. May be rewarmed in a large frying pan with a little butter and water stirring constantly. Or a large pot or saucepan. Goes great with fresh wallys and just about anything else...Enjoy"

Pepper 1  Bottle tobasco sauce 6  Morons 2  A**holes 1  Bottle Scotch INSTRUCTIONS 1. Get two of the morons to gather firewood and build a fire, two morons to peel and chop onions and the last two morons to cut up potatoes. 2. Get one moron to clean, filet and cut fish into chunks. (no bones!) 3. Cut up salt pork and fry in large soup pot till almost cooked. 4. Add onions and fry until soft. 5. Fill pot halfway with water, add chicken cubes and salt, bring to a boil. 6. Remove half a small pot of boiling water, add chowder mix, stir until lumps are gone and save. 7. Add fish and bring back to a boil for five minutes. 8. Add canned potatoes and corn and bring back to a boil. 9. Add chowder mix and pepper stir until it thickens. 10. Add condensed milk, butter and lots of tobasco sauce. 11. Serve when butter is melted. 12. Get the two a**holes to the dishes while the rest drink scotch and tell jokes. You can use real potatoes if you don't have canned potatoes, they take longer so add them after the water and cook for 20 minutes. If you're not good enough to catch fish add more corn!!"

I enjoy putting on the spread.Every group should have someone that likes to cook.I only get to Canada once a year so I want the trip perfect!I'm 36 in my younger day's we alway's worried about having enough beer, now we worry about what food did we bring. Don't get me wrongthe beer still tastes great and we never have to bring any home.But I now feel like FOOD makes the trip."
516410,Hank,2002-01-18 09:53:00,9,"Had to add to this, as thinking about those Canadian shore lunches just makes getting through the winter so much easier. Walleye fillets from the night before are put into a zip lock bag. To the bag add buttermilk pancake mix that is a little thin... We take the boxed type that you just add water to. Let fillets soak in this mix all night in fridge and put on ice in cooler. In another zip lock is ""Shore Lunch"" fish coating mix. When ready for lunch all you have to do is remove fillets from batter, shake in ""Shore Lunch"" bag and cook. Two empty zip locks are all the trash you have except the bean cans. Canned pears and peaches make a nice change too. As for mountain pies---Drained canned venision crushed onto bread with provolone cheese, onion, drained canned tomatoes and if you want a little horse radish mustard and then cook. Pre cooking the onions makes this even better."

I've been fishing of 50+ years now and the trips I remember best are the ones where we took the time to pull up on a beach or rock somewhere, fry a few fish, bake a potato in the coals of the fire, have a cold one, kick back and wonder why I do not do this more often. You know Gods in his heaven and all is well with the world (at least for a few minutes).dean"

516417,RANGER,2002-01-18 19:38:00,4341,"VERN,Go back to the Civil War. They had muzzleloaders at that time where you had to load your gun by pouring a powder charge down the barrel, followed by a piece of cloth and a round ball bullet. Then you had to pour powder into a small ""charger"" called a frizzin to be the primer for the charge in the barrel and ignite it with a flint and a striker plate to cause a spark --Blackpowder weapon. If the powder in the frizzen was wet - the gun didn't fire and, most probably, you were dead. SO, if you keep the powder DRY, in the frizzin, the gun would fire! End of story - someone else could die instead of YOU. That's the point! :-) Hope this helps!The other question? Beer on the lake? No comment!!!"

516400,Guest,2002-01-17 14:06:00,0,"Have you ever heard of a Shootin' The Bacon sandwich?Take about a 1-2 lb. slab of bacon, drive stick through it, and let it ""cook"" over the fire (not too close)...but make sure you have something to catch the grease drippings. Cut up some onions, green peppers, cucumbers, and maybe some hot peppers. Once the bacon is adequately cooked, slice it up into thin slices, or not so thin depending on your preference. Put that on a half piece of bread and load that sandwich up with peppers, onions...etc. and pour a little of the grease drippings over that. Oh...what a sandwich. It's not the lowest fat eating in the world, but what about a shore lunch is? These are also good late night after a successful evening on the lake and a few cold brews.I'm in the process of completing a web site dedicated to Canadian fishing trips and am posting some recipes on that. If nobody minds, I may lift a few from this board and post the best ones. I'll post a message here once the site goes live, within the next few days."
516401,Peanut,2002-01-17 15:11:00,929,"Oh ya, some other twists on the Bush/Mountain/Hobo pie deal:1. in addition to canned pie filling or fruit, try using the Laura Secord puddin' cup in the middle (well, not the cup - you know what I mean). One of our guys did that for the he11 of it - chocolate creme bush pie!! It worked great. Ranger, give this a whirl this summer with your favourite flavour.2.

You could also prep some fillets the evening before and really make quick time of it. Also, our group is 6 this year and we plan on sending one boat to shore to get things ready and then call the rest of us in on the radio. If all else fails - you can always have some sushi right in the boat.Steve"
516406,Guest,2002-01-18 05:53:00,0,I can't believe no one has tried a can of stewed tomatoes. I always have a can of these along. Try it sometime.
516407,ski,2002-01-18 06:01:00,17,This is an easy way to prepare a shore lunch without lugging around a lot of heavy eqipment and is a good change of pace:Potatoes - Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with no-stick spray and add the following:sliced potatoes sliced onionssliced green pepperssliced carrotsmushroomsbacon bits (left over from breakfast)put some pats of butter on top of this and season with Lawry's all season salt.Crimp the foil so none of the juices can leak out and place in a cooler that will go in the boat with you.Fish - bring along heavy duty foil and right before you are ready to eat fillet the fish and layer them on the foil (don't forget to spray)and add onions peppers mushrooms and butter pats - season and a squirt or two of lemon. Seal the foil.Get the campfire going. When the wood has burned down to coals put the potatoes on the grate first as they will take longer than the fish. I also put a can of beans on the grate at the same time. After about 20-25 minutes add the fish and cook for about 12-15 minutes more. Then enjoy!!!Things to put in the cooler along with the pre-prepared potatoes in foil:1. Plastic plates and forks2. squeeze lemon3. a stick or two of butter4. Lawry's seasoning salt and lemon pepper5. pre cut onion slices peppers and mushrooms in a plastic bag for the fish.6. can opener7. pancake turner to slide the fish and potatoes out of the foil.8. big spoon to stir the beans.9. heavy duty aluminum foilAll of this fits in a small cooler and you don't have to lug around the heavy stuff. The plates burn up when done. The only other thing to bring is the BEER!!!

516391,Peanut,2002-01-17 08:48:00,929,"Lots of good ideas so far, here's a couple more:If you want to stay with canned stuff for convenience and minimal advance prep. work, we've always taken a few cans of Alpha-Getti or Zoodles or something - out guys say it goes well with fish, and heats up fast, even right in the can. Another side that worked well - cook some perogies the night before, and pack 'em cold. At lunch, reheat them in the pan or deep fryer - a good change of pace from fried potatoes.If your shore lunch includes dessert, how about bush pies??? All you need are a bush pie maker (about the size of a wiener stick), some sliced bread, and some canned fruit or pie filling.

516392,RANGER,2002-01-17 09:53:00,4341,"Okay, here we go! (as I drool and slobber thinking about it on a cold Winter day)Standard issue:Fillets from fish we caught that morning.Whole potatoes that we have a Popel-like hand slicer for, including that dippy rubber glove that you wear so as not to include finger tips in the mix. Potatoes are sliced like slightly thick potato chips.Canned beansWe have various premixed breadings that we throw the potatoes and fillets into to coat for frying.

Now for the adders:Sliced zuchini in a bag of breadingWhole canned (or jarred) mushrooms in a bag of breadingOnion rings ready to fryPre-prepared breaded mozzerella sticksOreida Tater TotsEgg plant ready to frySometimes we'll take preps for ""Mountain Pies"", which ""Peanut"" calls ""Bush Pies"" - same thing.

I could go on and on but I can't take it anymore!!! I'm drooling all over myself!!!!!!!!All this stuff is prepared ahead of time and kept in the fridge at the cabin and, then, in the cooler on the boat. Once we hit shore some of us fillet while the others build the fire, unload, etc. All the hardware for the shore lunch is kept together in a heavy duty hamper so you only have one container to remove from the boat. Setup is fast and easy as is takedown. I guess we could do it in an hour BUT we shorelunch in the middle of the heat of the day when we have been fishing for 4 or 6 hours and the bite has backed off so we take an hour and a half or two to lunch, swim, go for a walk, dive off the rocks...........................I think you get the idea!"
516393,VMS,2002-01-17 10:28:00,1103,"Tried this one the other night with the fish:Instead of using oil to fry, and some sort of batter, Try this one:1. Take a couple of sticks of butter, melt in a pan.2. Fillets can be left whole or halfed. Place in pan. season with Lawry's seasoning, some garlic, and some salt and pepper.3. cook until bottom is turning white, then flip. season the other side and finish cooking until desired flakeyness is reached. For items to go with the meal,I usually will take along chopped salad, and dressing. Mix the dressing and salad at shore.Boiled potatoes work as well. Boil them at camp, then ziplock them when they are almost done (fork should go in a little hard). When you are filleting the fish, boil the potatoes, then start the fish and vegie (corn, beans, whatever)Ready to go in a short time, and not much to clean up. Butter usually is absorbed by the fish, potatoes all get eaten. About all you have left are whatever pans you used. pack away and move on.sounds pretty similar to what has been done above...Is it June yet?"

Pull them out and, with the husk pulled back but still attached and all the hair removed, we spread some butter on the ear, add some salt and pepper (or Essence spice) to taste. Pull the husk back up and wrap each one in tin foil. You don't need a lot of foil since you will keep the husks on while cooking.Throw these bad boys in the coals of your shore lunch wood fire and turn them every few minutes. It only takes about 15-20 minutes to cook them this way and they are great hand food with the fish and beans.If you are in an area that will not permit open fires, boil them in a kettle of lake water. Kinda defeats the purpose of gear reduction and does not taste as good, but it is a change and still plenty good.We also bring Pillsbury dough tubes to the lunch. We cut the dough into strips and fry them in a shallow pan. Some of the guys sprinkle cinnamon sugar on them for dessert.AquaMan~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It all begins and ends at the water's edge..."

I've gotten away from a thick batter and opted just to throw the fillets into a plastic bag of Shore Lunch mix.While all of this is going on I've got bacon frying on a one burner stove, and raw onion sliced about a 1/4"" thick.On a hard roll I put a fillet, slice of bacon, a slice of raw onion, and a dab of tarter sauce. It's a very tasty fish sandwich, served with the fries, raw vegetables (also pre vacum packed) and dip and for dessert each person gets one of my wife's home-made Butter Tarts.I've done this quite a few times for groups of around ten and I will have them back on the water fishing within an hour.

I've gotten away from a thick batter and opted just to throw the fillets into a plastic bag of Shore Lunch mix.While all of this is going on I've got bacon frying on a one burner stove, and raw onion sliced about a 1/4"" thick.On a hard roll I put a fillet, slice of bacon, a slice of raw onion, and a dab of tarter sauce. It's a very tasty fish sandwich, served with the fries, raw vegetables (also pre vacum packed) and dip and for dessert each person gets one of my wife's home-made Butter Tarts.I've done this quite a few times for groups of around ten and I will have them back on the water fishing within an hour. I do everything from the fish cleaning to the clean-up. The key is pre packing some food items with a vacum packer, and my propane cooker. I know a black iron skillet over a grated fire is ""romantic"" and all, but I'd never go with out my cooker.Give it a try! I've never had any complaints."

516388,Matches,2002-01-16 20:46:00,236,"Vern, I am not sure about a side dish, but the canned potato's have got to go. I agree with Gene. We use a one burner deep fryer running off of a 5lb tank of propane. We do have to let the oil cool before putting it back in the container. (it can be reused for that trip) I keep a funnel in my box. We cut up potato's for deep fried french fries and make those first. Then the fish. We have also made onion rings. (I know, a lot of grease for the old stomach). My only reccomendation for side dish would be get some good flat bread and a good side salad type dish from a deli. Wrapp the salad up in the flat bread. The flat bread makes a good walleye sandwich too!"
