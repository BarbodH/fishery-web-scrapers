I think the week we were up there the fish won. monday it was rainy and windy, tuesday it was windy. wedsday and thursday it was accepable. friday it was windy and saturday it was windy and rainy. we did eat fish and brought some home so I cant complain after all it is september. I cant say the fishing was really great though. my wife did catch a a 38 1/2 inch northern and some nice walleyes.. Its always nice to get away. next year we plan on going in june and september again just because its nice to go up there. though coming back to the states on a sunday we could see the customs agents lined up looking for something to inspect. opened up the boat and went through everything in the truck. they were nice though. I cant imagine they would do this kind of job on a saturdy morning though. the line would stretch out of the town of fort francis!"
