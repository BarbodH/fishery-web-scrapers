Thanks."
543114,Guest,2004-08-31 21:48:00,0,Hi. we stayed at sioux lookout a number of years ago. there is a portage on a rail setup into lac saul from there. about 10 bucks round trip. we did not do it probably should have though. the east end is where the walleyes are I have heard.
543116,Guest,2004-09-01 07:51:00,0,"I'VE FISHED THE CHAMBERLAIN NARROWS AREA (LAC SEUL OUTPOSTS)THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND HAVE FOUND THE FISHING TO BE NOTHING SHORT OF FANTASTIC. EVEN WITH THE FUNKY WEATHER WE HAD THIS SPRING WE WERE STILL ABLE TO CATCH SIZE AND QUANTITY (30"" WALLEYES AND 100 FISH PER BOAT, 2 GUYS). WE ARE HEADING UP IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS 9/13- 9/19 AND I,LL POST A REPORT WHEN WE RETURN, BUT I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE A EXCELLENT REPORT (GETTIN' TO BE BIG FISH TIME). IF YOU CAN GET IN I WOULD RECOMMEND GIVING IT A TRY. CPR"
543118,Guest,2004-09-01 11:20:00,0,"fishing is great on the east end of the lake,, have heard about a toga party 10/01/2004 in chamberlain narrows, the details are interesting, if you are up that way on the 1st,, bring your toga ????"
543303,Guest,2004-09-14 17:00:00,0,The 2 houseboat places in Hudson are both excellent. We are partial to Sioux Lookout floating lodges and used them for the past 14 years. These are great folks who run a first-class operation.
543335,Guest,2004-09-15 18:46:00,0,"I always hear about Chamberlain Narrows on Lac Seul. I have heard it is right above Sioux Lookout. Is there a map on the web that shows actually where it is? Is it just one particular spot, or is it a name for a larger area. I was thinking about a boat in at Lac Seul outposts at Chamberlain Narrows for next year. Looks nice, but is it worth the $300 more than Fisherman's Cove or Evergreen?"
543357,Guest,2004-09-16 15:01:00,0,"I HAVE BEEN FISHING THE EAST SIDE OF LACSEUL SINCE 1964, THROUGH THIS YEAR 2004 AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO...THE LAST THREE YEARS, THE WATER LEVEL HAS BEEN CRAZY...TWO FOOT ABOVE THE WATER LINE TO 6-7 FEET BELOW THE WATER LINE. I LIKE IT WHEN THE WATER IS HIGH. YOU MENTIONED THREE SISTERS ISLANDS, THEY ARE USUALLY UNDER WATER AND YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN INTO THEM. I FISHED NORTH OF CHAMBERLAIN NARROWS 5 OR 6 TIMES, ALL THE WAY UP TO WHERE THE ROOT RIVER COMES INTO LACSEUL....ALL THE WAY SOUTH TO DEVILS ELBOW..NEEDLESS TO SAY, OVER SOME 40 YEARS OF FISHING THERE, I HAVE SEEN SOME BAD YEARS AS WELL AS GOOD YEARS. RE: HOUSE BOATS, CALL LACSEUL FLOATING LODGES, THEY ARE ALSO OUT OF HUDSON...807-582-3284 ASK FOR IRENE OR DAVE, TELL THEM GERRY FROM LOCKPORT, IL TOLD YOU TO CALL THEM......THEIR HOUSE BOATS ARE GREAT, ANYWHERE FROM 55 TO 75 FEET, WITH SCREENED FRONT ENDS.....IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT PART OF THE LAKE, THEY HAVE GUIDES THAT WILL PLACE YOU.....TRY TO GET THEM ON THE INTERNET...WWW.LACSEULFLOATINGLODGES.COM YOU WILL NEVER FISH THE WEST SIDE OF LACSEUL AGAIN!!!!!!"
