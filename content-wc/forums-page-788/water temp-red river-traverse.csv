543223,Guest,2004-09-08 13:21:00,0,"Red was 62 deg on Sunday, not sure about Traverse haven't made it to Pine Falls yet. I have heard a few reports of greenbacks and seen a few pictures. The flow is up and there seems to be a lot of bait(shiners) in the Red. Looks like the fall fishing might be good..."
543231,Guest,2004-09-09 09:12:00,0,"Wait until the reports are...""there is non-stop action"". I know of many gents from the USA who left very disappointed the past few years. If you don't know the river and lake well, then you may not catch fish. If you look at the tournament results, people are catching! If you're not catching, you're in the wrong spot! The trick is to figure out that secret spot!!!"

With the cool year we have had Im hoping the end of September will be good. The water temp should be about right but the days will not be at their shortest, which I heard is another trigger to make those walleyes go on their feeding frenzy."

Reports are filtering in from a wide range or of sources of some good catches of Greenbacks. No monsters being bragged about openly...not yet anyway. I have a hunch a few more are being caught then is getting let out of the bag...if ya know what I mean. Lots of Buzz and hush-hush. In a word...""Encouraging"".
