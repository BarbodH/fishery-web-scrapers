He is a very caring man always giving to other's less forchent then him, to buying food for the food bank or helping friend that can't afford to fix there car, he will fix it for nothing. He is always tell us that ""treat other people as you would like to be treated"" and now I teach my children the same. He is my fishing partner, my hunting partner and he's my best friend. I love him! I need to know if there's any foundation or any origination that can help a dream come true for my dad. We have always talked about taking a trip to one of those fly-in fishing trips to catch the big fish. My dad has been fighting cancer for about 1 year, after cemo and radiation, it look like he beat it for now, but the last month or so he been having had time walking and its been getting harder. He went to the cancer Dr. and after a m.r.i they told him the cancer is in the spine, and said there's not much they can do. My dad has been working on and off the last year, lets just say it hasn't been great year money wise. It's been so bad they had to go bank rubt. I would like to help make my dad's dream come true. Thank you Mike (son) Please e-mail me @ [email protected] :("
