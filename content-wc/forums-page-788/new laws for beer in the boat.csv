543348,Bryan,2004-09-16 07:14:00,244,">no booze, but i heard that crack, smack and weed are ok. not >sure, but that's what i heard. You are correct. Everyone knows that booze and drugs don't mix. The new law also states that all crack pipes must be tethered to the kill switch on the motor so as to shut off when you pass out and fall out of the boat. I applied for a permit to set up a fleet of floating crack houses (converted house boats)that would be servicing the lakes but was rejected as the government said they wish to control the use of drugs on the water and would be seting up their own fleet much like the present liquor store system."

543353,Guest,2004-09-16 10:11:00,0,"I do have to say that we were stopped twice by DNR on Minaki this year right at the bridge. We had beer visible on the boat both times. It was in my hand and I was driving, but I was not drunk and I was polite. He checked our livewell and license the first meeting. We had two smaller walleye one time, and no walleyes the other and he said have a nice day. Not even a warning or a mention about beer. He did not seem to care about it. Other guys from my cabin were also stopped with beer and had no problems. There was a boat that had too many Walleyes and the DNR followed them and went into their cabin at Fisherman's Cove. They got nailed for over limit walleye and for the beer. I was using the phone by the Fisherman's Cove store, and the DNR guy had a different demeanor than he did with us. He joked with us about the weather and said have a nice day. He was not in a happy mood with these guys. Moral of the story...beer is okay...over limit VERY BAD!"
543356,JohnAB,2004-09-16 14:12:00,49,"It was my first time to Ontario fishing this year. We were on Sen Bay fishing from shore and I noticed all the boats coming in with open beer etc. Being from Alberta I was amazed at this as out here one would be written up in a blink of an eye. I commented to the boy how lax enforcement must be in Ontario. As some kids were loading beer into their boat and drinking a few to boot, a CO came walking up. Imagine my surprise when he didn't even blink an eye. He came over to where I was I asked him about the enforcement of beer in the boat. He stated that the CO's cannot enforce the law regarding liquor in boats but will take action if a person is obviously drunk. He stated that they have to have a OPP officer with them and then the OPP officer would charge for open liquor etc in the boat. He also stated that it may be in the works this winter to have the law or policy changed to allow the CO's to enforce the open liquor rule as well. So next year be careful."
543361,JimH,2004-09-16 18:16:00,320,Note? You don't need no stinkin note. Just let him taste it :)
543372,Walleye_Slayer,2004-09-17 19:20:00,134,"dnr can only enforce fishing regs they need provincial police for the beer. that's why on lac suel you usually see both in the same boat consider yourselves lucky if you got by. i like to drink with the best of them but on the northwest end of lac suel with the big water and big waves, i never think twice about having beer on the water and it's one of the lakes i wear my life jacket on. do as you please i am not picking on anyone just my 2 cents have a good day A Bad Day Fishing is Better than the Best Day at Work Best Reguards Walleye_Slayer"
