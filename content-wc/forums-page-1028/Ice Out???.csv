511922,Go_Fish,2001-04-09 10:17:00,28,Does anyone have any ideas as to when the ice will be out in the Red Lake or Ear Falls area? Some have said that it will be a late spring because of the La Nina phenomenon. Any comments?Go_Fish
511923,Frank from TBay,2001-04-09 10:25:00,312,It is going to be late this year. We are still hard at Ice fishing. Heading out on Friday for the latest fish I have had in years. Going 60 miles north of Thunder Bay. Still lots of snow for a snowmachine. I'll bet ice out in the first week of May. The post spawn Walleye are going to get pounded.
511924,szopster,2001-04-09 17:11:00,48,The average ice out for the Red Lake is around May 4th. At least this is what some locals have told me. I have been flying out of Red Lake for the opening week for 20+ straight years. Always for the third Saturday in May. Have only encountered ice on Red Lake twice at fly out time.
