511925,Hammerhead Herb,2001-04-09 10:20:00,259,Does anyone have any info about how much snow fall this area has had. I fish the Gammon River flowage in the park; upstream from Carroll Lake. Last year the waterlevels were about normal; however the year before was real low. What is it looking like for this year
