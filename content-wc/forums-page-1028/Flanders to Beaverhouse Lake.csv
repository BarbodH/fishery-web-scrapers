511909,Guest,2001-04-09 15:20:00,0,The Flanders road is 27 miles west of Atikokan. There are a number of resorts in the area. Type in Flanders in your search engine (Google)and you will get some hits.I have fished the area about 15 years ago. Age has a way of making things seem closer. Have a good trip............Frank
