511305,Homer,2001-03-11 08:33:00,1127,"I was planning on asking the outfitter, but was worried about putting him in a position of asking him to do something ""illegal"". Calling the conservation officer directly is an excellent suggestion that hadn't dawned on me. Thanks."
511306,rainy,2001-04-10 13:04:00,21,lee g if you want the canada regulations i will be happy to send them to you email me for more info
511307,Mal,2001-04-11 02:25:00,55,What about bringing wax worms across the border into Canada?? I have read the regulations and they say nothing about the wax worms or larvae? Did I miss this when reading the regulations??
511308,Guest,2001-04-11 05:52:00,0,"As a camp owner in Ontario, I want you to know that it is NOT the camp owners who ""are behind"" the regilation. A group made up of Ontario bait dealers has pushed hard for the leech ban. As a camp owner, we now need to purchse a sell a license to sell the bait even if we purchase it from an Ontario dealer. Yes, it was possible for us to go to Int. Falls to buy leeches for us to resell but adding the cost of that trip to the cost of the leeches would make them very expensive for our guests. If one of you paid $25.00 for a pound it was probably in Canadian $ and remember the exchange rate is currently running about 55%. The leech ban has been in effect for the past two years. Only rule change we are aware of is in NW Ontarion many of the lake with Muskies now has a 54 inch minimum length. And don't be afraid to ask information from your outfitter. We go out of our way to be sure our guests are legal crossing the boarder, on the water, and crossing back."
511309,tillerguy,2001-04-11 06:01:00,32,One thing you should be aware of is that all provinces are different. Check the regs for which province you are going to.There is no blanket regs for Canada.
511295,Lee G.,2001-03-04 15:18:00,9,Can someone please tell me if leeches are allowed to be transported into Canada this year? I have been fishing Lake of the Woods for 8 years and I heard that the resort owners are trying to make it illegal to bring in leeches.
511296,acp,2001-03-04 16:03:00,156,"It's been illegal to import leeches into Ontario for the past two or three years. Don't know of any changes for 2001. You can check at:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/Don't know if they have the 2001 regs posted yet, if not they should be there shortly.Later....Al"
511297,Lee G.,2001-03-04 16:40:00,9,"I know that the border officers asked me if I had 'live bait' and I said that I had leeches. They did not tell me that I couldn't bring them in, so I presume that it was ok. Last year when I crossed I was informed that this year (2001)there would be a law preventing anyone from bringing them in, except, resort owners bringing them in for resale in their resorts or liscensed bait retailers bringing them in to sell them to resort owners. In talking to some Canadian residents, I have heard that the resort owners are the ones behind the new law (if there is one).The resort owners are either buying their leeches from Mn or going there themselves to get them. Then sell them at very high prices so they make more money. I have not heard of any environmental impact to cause the law so it could very well be true that they are behind it."
511298,Frank from TBay,2001-03-04 17:06:00,312,I buy leeches (last year) for about $25 Canadian a pound. Trapping is a hard dirty business and those boys earn every dollar. Trappers also have to pay a fee every year to the province for their trapping rights. I am pleased to see the laws that limit importation of any live bait. This allows the local trappers to make a reasonable living and also keeps me in good bait. It is against the law for US anglers to bring in leeches to Ontario. Good fishing: Frank
511299,Lee G.,2001-03-04 17:17:00,9,"Thanks for the info. But as I understand, the leeches for the most part are sold to Canada sellers from MN distributers. If this is true the MN people are still making their money when the people going to Canada buy the leeches from them in MN. They certainly have a better selection in MN. It's very hard to get jumbo leeches in Canada. I think that what may happen is that the fishermen will do more fishing with artificials and stop buying the live bait. If that happens it may hurt the people that go out to collect them. I hope that doesn't happen, but if the price per dozen is around $4/doz (US) and the leechs are small up there I think the sales will deminish. We'll see. Again, thanks for the information."
511300,Guest,2001-03-05 12:51:00,0,"I just reviewed the 2001 Ontario Laws last week and they specifically say that no live bait including leeches, minnows or cayfish may be brought in. Night Crawlers in non soil bedding (newspaper mulch) are OK."
511301,KnottyBuoy,2001-03-06 06:23:00,110,We have been given a sales receipt when we buy our leeches north of the border and were told we had to have it in our possession if were stopped and checked.....otherwise we would be subject to a fine. Been this way for at least 2 years now.......

It was illegal to take leeches into Canada last year,i.e. all live bait as a matter of fact. Worms are ok (go fiqure..Live) but must be in worm bedding only."
511303,Homer,2001-03-10 06:56:00,1127,"I'm going to be heading into Quetico this summer, starting from Ely, MN. Is there any way that I can bring leeches in with me? I don't believe that I'll be passing many bait shops once I get into Canada.One option, although it seems loony, is to buy leeches in Windsor, ON (which is close to my home) before I leave and take them up with me. I don't know if there are restrictions about taking leeches from Canada into the U.S. - and then back into Canada again."
511304,Frank from TBay,2001-03-11 08:20:00,312,Ask a conservation officer what to do. They are helpfull with these types of things. Get his name and detachment when he gives you an answer and the date you spoke to him. When you are in the field it can clear things up very quickly if there is a problem. It must be a common problem in this area as thousands of people head into this area every year. Your outfitter may be able to help as well. Good luck: Frank
