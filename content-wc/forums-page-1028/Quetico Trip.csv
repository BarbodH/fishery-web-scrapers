511690,Guest,2001-03-26 04:16:00,0,"Make sure you take a couple of three inch ""torpedos"" with you. Use them early morning and late evening. You can't beat the top water action."
511691,Guest,2001-03-31 05:13:00,0,"After many years in the BWCA and Quet. Park, I would not think of going without a hand full of Maribou jigs at about 1/4 oz. or so. Some plain jigs with twister tails too. Lots of snags so bring plenty."
511692,Guest,2001-04-01 07:29:00,0,I agree with the jigs and topwaters. Make sure to take a few hot-n-tots also.
511693,fishinwi,2001-04-02 15:18:00,3,Thanks for the info... I also found some good info. at canoecountry.com dave

I have had good luck with small jigs dressed with Berkely Power Grubs, as well as tube worms. The tubes take a special jig. Use a variety of colors. We've found this type of combination quite productive. Ditto re: the snags/rocks. Take time to check out the nice sand beaches on the way."
511695,JohnWR,2001-04-07 04:02:00,5,"Over the years in BWCA, we have had a lot of luck with beetle spins in pumpkin, and with 3-4"" floating rapalas. We were told to try making minnow imitators from 3/8"" dowel rod, screw eyes, split rings, & treble hooks at a presentation we attended before our first trip. These have worked as well or better than any lure but the beetle spins!"
