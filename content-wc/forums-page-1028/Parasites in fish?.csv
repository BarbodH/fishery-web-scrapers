511898,Guest,2001-04-07 03:02:00,0,"I was wondering how ""worms"" develop in fish? Seems to affect perch a lot(according to different lodge/resort owners I have spoken to) but I can't remember anyone ever saying walleyes are affected, maybe that would drive away business? Any fisheries biologists with insight? Thanks for the info !!! Mickey"
511899,Guest,2001-04-07 04:48:00,0,"Yes, perch are affected by small parasites which do not seem to get into walleye. Don't think this is a resort business thing just reality. There can be parasites in many fish and many are unseen.. Best policy..be sure fish are cooked done but not overdone to make them dry. That eliminates any problem..seen or unseen."

511901,Guest,2001-04-07 14:41:00,0,"Mickey,Almost all fish have parasites of one form or another. Perch are notorious for having "" worms "". They are often infested with both external and internal parasites. External parasites usually manifest themselves on the perch during the warm-water periods of summer because of the parts of the lake they inhabit. Roundworms are a common internal parasite found in the perch's body cavity, they are infected with these by the food they ingest.Almost all walleye, on the other hand, are infested with tapeworms. The tapeworm's cysts are found in the muscles of the fish, so make sure you cook your fillets to well done. Cooking kills these cysts and just adds a little protein to the meat (what you don't know, doesn't hurt you!). These cysts are microscopic, so they cannot be seen by the naked eye. When sushi was all the rage a few years back, many people returning from fly-in fishing trips came down with tapeworms. They were looking for alternate ways to prepare their fish meals, unaware that these fish from pristine waters, contained cysts of the tapeworm.Well, that's the lesson for today, hope this answers some of your questions.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
511902,Guest,2001-04-09 14:22:00,0,"Parasites in water related species is a underrated health risk, water being what it is parasites virtually swim to their hosts! This contact, foot pads, and ingestion are the main methods of infestation. Beware of ""sweet smelling"" walleyes. Easy method of checking your body of water for them in fish is to let the fish sit overnight till they reach a tempature of 70's the lack of oxy brings them out, they come out and suffocate in the water use about an inch of it.If worms are present you will notice the ""different"" smell of these fish. Marinas with illegal sanitation practices in the metro areas prevalent.Also Livestock near waterStill edible but...."
511903,Guest,2001-04-11 17:06:00,0,"Parasites for got to mention that the worms are unmistakeable spaghetti like in length and diameter about that color too, in us they have been known to reach 18 feet or 6 yards, feel blotted, pot belly, and gurgling sensations in parts of bowel are sympthoms.Herbal remedy of the name and method ""clear"" developed by veternary I believe is most effective treatment for them and their cousins some of which impossible to find in your body.Dry feet is a good idea, but it is believed they can enter your body through your eyes underwater.Set that fryer at 300'!!!"
511904,Guest,2001-04-12 07:01:00,0,If someone tells you that Walleye don't get parasites like theperch do they are full of CRAP. Walleye do get parasites!
511905,Guest,2001-04-12 17:57:00,0,"Parasitic worms are passed on to people through contaminated food and water. Tapeworms are contracted from eating contaiminated pork, beef,and fish that contain the microscopic cysts of these tapeworms. Pork is notorious for carring a variety of worms, including the deadly trichina worm, which is a roundworm. Some roundworms are contracted from eating vegetables that have not been cleaned thoroughly, these came from the manure that contained the eggs of worms, that was used as a fertilizer on gardens. Some worms enter the body by boring into the sole of the foot, such as the hookworm. The hookworm, however, is not found in the Northern Hemisphere, since their eggs cannot survive the cold conditions. You could go on and on, but this are some of the ways that the more commonly known worms may be passed on to humans.Symptoms vary from worm to worm, but the most common are fatigue, insatiable hunger (as in tapeworms, remember your eating for two), and susceptabiity to other diseases, since these worms leave your body in a weakened state. Some worms may be purged from the body by drugs designed to kill the them, others may indeed kill the person.The best prevention measures, so that a person does not contract parasitic worms, are strict sanitation standards, cook all meat until it is well done (this kills the cysts), and education of the public on the danger of these worms and how they are contracted.Remember to keep your eyes open and use a meat thermometer.S.v.m"
