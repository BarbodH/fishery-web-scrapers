511927,Walli,2001-04-09 12:56:00,63,Yes there are lake trout in Rainy and if you need a three bedroom cabin to rent email me at [email protected]
511928,HLLGuide,2001-04-09 14:04:00,10,"I fished Rainy for 17 years and I've never caught a laker or heard of one caught. Bad Vermillion on the east side of the Seine has trout, I've fished this lake in the winter but never in the summer. Rainy is deep enough and I agree it would be a great trout lake!Guide"
511929,Guest,2001-04-09 17:57:00,0,"I live on Rainy, I've fished it in the summer and in the winter and I have never heard or seen one caught. I believe in my 23 years that if one had been caught I would have heard about it. Good luck trout fishing."

511931,Walli,2001-04-10 12:30:00,63,When I said there are lake trout on Rainy that was a long time ago -grew up in Fort Frances I haven't heard anything lately either.Interested to hear!
511932,rainy,2001-04-10 13:23:00,21,"there is no lake trout in rainy lake to my knowledge but there are lakes such as vain otakamon, and bad vermillion that contribute to rainy lake and can be portaged to lower manitou and esox upper manitou dog fly can be acssed as well by road there is also pipestone lake of the woods ect. ect. ect.contact northwesern ontario tourism for more info."
511933,Guest,2001-04-12 19:22:00,0,"There have been comfirmed reports of a few Lakers caught in commercial nets years ago. I have not heard of any fish caught in a long time. The reports I have heard, have come out of Ash Bay in the North Arm. Any fish reports that have said ""the lakers are biting in rainy Lake on the canadian side"" is absolutely pulling your leg.Jeff"
