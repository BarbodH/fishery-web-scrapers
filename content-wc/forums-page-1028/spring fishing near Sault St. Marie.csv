511121,Guest,2001-02-17 18:13:00,0,My son and I are looking for a place to go this spring in either June or July. We are looking for a place to either fly in or drive to within four to five hours of Sault St. Marie.
511122,Buckeye,2001-02-17 21:02:00,592,Here's a good lake with nice accomodations about 3.5 hrs from the Soo...........http://www.duenorth.net/prairiebeecamps/

I have been tossing around the idea of taking them to Witch Bay or Stanleys on Eagle Lake but the drive will be trying to say the least. Have you been to Prarie Bee ? What kind of numbers would a fairly well experienced fisherman expect on an average day ? Kids like catching !! Thanks, Steve"
511124,Guest,2001-02-18 05:14:00,0,"Thank you for the info we have been to Esnagi Lodge about 50 miles north of Hawk Junction about 6 times, we have enjoyed it there and done real well on numbers of fish (50 to 100 per day) but not to many larger ones ,just thought we would like to try something different,maybe a lake that has smallmouth too.

511125,Tyee,2001-02-19 16:26:00,60,"Rog,Here is a new camp that opened last year, with all new logcabins. I've got reservations for twice this year (in earlyJune for a ""father-son"" trip with another buddy and our son(s),and then again in mid-August with a group of other buddies).Check out their website....the camp is all new, and I talked withanother fisherman that went up twice last summer, and had goodfishing and a great time....is only accouple hours from Sault Ste. Marie.It is called Camp Kuha and it's website is www.campkuha.com; andis very reasonable ($700 US for the week - Housekeeping).Regards,Tyee"
511126,Guest,2001-02-20 02:15:00,0,"Tyee, I went to the website, this is an awesome setting. Did I understand their pricing correctly.......it's an extra $200-300 for a boat ?lobo"
511127,whitey,2001-02-21 08:05:00,36,look at Hawk-air or Air-Dale out of Wawa. Numerous fly in lakes to choose from and not real expensive
511128,Guest,2001-02-22 08:22:00,0,Dog lake is 4 hours from the soo and the best lake that I have ever fished. if you would like some more information I would be more than happy to give it to you by e-mail.
511129,Wayne,2001-04-07 00:52:00,43,The Spanish River is only 2 1/2 hours east of the Sault. It is a Walleye spawning river with some excellent spring fishing. Check out the Blue Heron Resort at:http://www.blueheronresort.on.caIt is a drive-in resort and the only one on the river below the dam at Espanola. Great fishing and great accommodations.
