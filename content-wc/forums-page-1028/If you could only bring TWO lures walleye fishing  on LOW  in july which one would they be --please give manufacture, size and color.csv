511849,Guest,2001-04-05 07:05:00,0,"1 to 2 oz bottom bouncer and crawler harness perch colored from ReelBait. that is all we fished last year and caught a bunch of walleyes. One tip though, the ReelBait spinners are 4 feet long, cut them down to 2' to 2'6"" and you will snag up less on the rocks"

511852,Guest,2001-04-05 13:36:00,0,1. Don't leave home without some 1 ounce bottom bouncers and a number 6 or 8 hook tipped with a leech I kicked some buttlast summer on that combo. 2. Near sundown tie on a number 9 shad and start cranking for suspended walleyes over deep water and sunken islandsand HOLD ON! Don't get me wrong you can still crank durringthe day but I like the evening bite. Good luck...
511853,Guest,2001-04-05 15:30:00,0,What rod would you use for bottom bumping
511854,Guest,2001-04-05 17:00:00,0,"I second the bottom bouncer, but as light as the conditions allow you to get the crawler to bottom. I like hammered brass and bright orange. Fished the Nestor Falls area and all we use for 'eyes."
511855,Guest,2001-04-06 16:46:00,0,"Lure #1:Spinner (hamered gold), 2 beads for, 2 beads aft with a #6 hook tipped with leech, minnow or preferably 1/2 crawler). You build your own with 8lb low diameter lineLure #2Little Cleo, 1/2 oz in bronze and maroon on a 4' tip with swivels at each end. Drift, troll, cast it goes where you want it to. BUT- it can be great milfoil harvester at very low speed retreival. You will know when you are too slow"
