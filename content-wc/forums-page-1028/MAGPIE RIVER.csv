511912,Guest,2001-04-08 18:59:00,0,"never been that early in the year but later on all the guys were doing well on diving baits. Shad raps, thunderstick jr's, rat l traps, reef runners etc. Never have seen or heard of any large fish there but there are tons of small-mid size fish. We marked larger fish but that could have been clusters of bait fish etc.whatever you use you will want barbless hooks - the action is fast.lobo"
511913,Guest,2001-04-09 09:15:00,0,haven't fished it the last couple of years but reports I hear is that the pike fishing is constant. One right after another but no size to any of them (this was 7/2000). Lures used were spoons and jigs fishing all points and log jams. Was alot of fun when we were there.
