Health issues make that extreme of seclusion a bit too risky. Advise is welcome on new NW Ontario locations that offer privacy (both on and off lake), yet maintains access to a car and other amenities that are more important to dad. I know there are tons of options. I'm hoping some of you can help weed through them so we can find a drive in where one can still enjoy their own camp fire, feel like you're alone, and provides fishing similar to what we've been spoiled with on our fly trips. Many Thanks"

I hate to see people stop doing what they enjoy.I don't have any definite solutions, but I am guessing that you might be able to find a private party to rent you a cabin on one of the better drive in lakes.Good luck,Fritz"
509202,Fred_G,2000-07-26 04:45:00,908,Hi Bob! You might check out The Old Post & Village on Lake St. Joseph. It is the last drive to in NW Ontario. The accomadations are wonderful and the fishing is the best I've experienced. Walleye Insider rates the lake as one of their top ten for walleye. John Grace and his family are really great hosts and will do everything to make your stay enjoyable. Check out their website at www.oldpost.com. LOL Fred

509204,GregK,2000-07-27 17:56:00,113,"Bob: I received your email but cannot mail back to you. I think the problem is that you may not be registered with WC or there is something wrong with your registration. In any case, if you will mail directly to me at [email protected] I'll send you some stuff on a really great lake and lodge."
