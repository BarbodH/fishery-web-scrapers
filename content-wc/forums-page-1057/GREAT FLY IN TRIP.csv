508525,Guest,2000-07-29 11:19:00,0,I have been going to a camp just south of souix lookout ontario. Pickerel Arm Camp. They have 7 different flyout post depending on what you want to catch. They have two of there own planes. They have a place for you to stay the night before flyout and you can fly out as early as 4:30 am to ensure the early bite for that day. They offer over nights and weekly rates. Solar powered cabins with sink and shower in the cabin. They can fly out bait and food request via 2 way radio if needed.

508526,Steve,2000-07-29 23:57:00,259,Coming from MN you can at least narrow your search to those outfitters that fly out of the Pickle Lake or Red Lake areas. My as well drive till you run out of road - especially if you are close to the border.steve
508523,Guest,2000-07-31 11:38:00,0,"Sounds great. I tried to find them on the net and I searched for their address. Came up with nothing. Have you got an address for me, please? Thanks, Irv Johnson [email protected]"
508527,Guest,2000-08-01 09:58:00,0,"Wife and I just got back from our third annual trip with Ignace Outposts.(IgnaceOutposts.com)100 fish days are easy, several 3 to 5 pounders each day. No 'big' eyes this trip, but have takensome beauties out in past years. She got a 46.5 pike and I took a 36 incher on 4lb test and a jig. Great people and very professional. Prices are reasonable. Where you get tired of jigging; troll cranks, then spoons, whatever. You'll catch fish all day. They have several lakes to choose from."
508514,WALLEYE DADDY,2000-06-15 07:28:00,59,PLANNING ON A FLY IN TRIP TO NORTHERN ONTARIO NEXT YEAR. I HAVE BEEN TO ALL THE SPORT SHOWS AND GATHERED ALL THE BROCHURES AND INFO I COULD. IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PLACES TO GO. I AM PRIMARILY FISHING WALLEYE AND AM PLANNING ON NEXT JUNE FOR THE TRIP. I DO LIVE IN MINNESOTA AND I CAN DRIVE TO THERE POST OVER THE BORDER. I AM LOOKING FOR A GOOD PRICE AND A GREAT FISHING EXPERIENCE. DOES ANYONE OUT THERE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCES.
508515,Snagmaster,2000-06-15 15:46:00,10,vikingoutpost.com---------and that's my final answer!
508516,Mick,2000-06-15 19:20:00,26,Go to Bill Rivers' website www.anglingadventures.com. He does an excellent job of presenting several fly-in lodges and outpost accomodations. I have been to Makokibotan Lodge and would highly recommend their facility. Others that that I have been told are well liked are Pine Portage/Kaby Lodges and Nagagami Lodge.FISH-ON!!!
508517,Guest,2000-06-16 04:40:00,0,"I have fished Canada with Mick for a few years now and what he says is true. He is also an outstanding walleye man so take what he says seriously. Basically any Canadian lake North of White River will have good walleye action, the further North you go the better it gets. Thats not to say that you can't catch a walleye closer to the US border but fishing pressure decreases as your drive increases. Best of luck, and Bill Rivers is an excellent source."
508518,Dave,2000-06-17 12:23:00,258,"Just got back from flyin trip with Kashabowie Outposts, Atikokan. They are a first class operation and I would highly recommend them. email me if you want more info."
508519,Mal,2000-06-17 20:34:00,55,Check out esnagami.com Just got back from there (7 years in a row now). Check it out!
508520,Guest,2000-06-20 10:32:00,0,"I've been to Kashabowie in year's past, and they were OK. But the best I've found is Ogoki Frontiers, out of Armstrong, which is north of Thunder Bay. By far the best of several outpost operations I've experienced, always upgrading thier operations and equipment. Great boats, depth finders, cabins, etc. And some great walleye fishing. Many places will tell you thier walleyes average 3 lb or so, but very few live up to that. This is one place that does!"
508521,Guest,2000-06-20 15:21:00,0,"It's a crap shoot, just about any fly-in outpost camp in Northern Ontario has great fishing some a little better than others, but that depends on the fisherman.Look for a good reputation, check with sources that have been there and book it. A word of caution as a resident of Northern Ontario I have met and talk to many people that have paid for fly-ins to lakes that have road acsses."
508522,Guest,2000-06-22 14:18:00,0,"Try way north camp in NW ontario. Four remote lakes to fish. Consistant big walleyes, trophy northerns and tons of lake trout. Fly in 150 miles north of red lake. Reasonable prices, good service, american or housekeeping plan. been there 4 times and can't say enough about it. e-mial me if you want more info. good luck"
508524,Jim,2000-06-25 07:50:00,238,"I fished Nagagami with Liddle's Fly In Adventures two years ago. Fishing was decent in August for both Walleye and Northerns. Price was reasonable. I also fished Buffalo Island out of Hornepayne with Oliver's Fly In Camps. This small lake produced over 435 walleye for 3 of us in a week and 45 or more northerns along with some jumbo perch. The employees fly to Buffalo Island for a day or two when it is not booked. There is also a portage lake. Last year I went to Papa John's Place in Temagami. Fishing was bad. Caught 2 walleye all week. Over 150 smallmouth, but all but a few were dinks. No northerns all week. This year I am going to Ogascanan Lodge in Quebec. Not a fly in but will report what the fishing is like when I get back."
