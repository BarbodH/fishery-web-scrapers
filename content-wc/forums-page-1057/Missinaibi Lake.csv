509328,Guest,2000-07-31 09:44:00,0,We are heading to Missinaibi Lake north of Chapleau in 2 weeks and would like to here from anyone who has been up there lately. We have been there 3 other times but it was about 20 years ago. Any information is greatly appreciated!!Good Fishing!!!

The weather was bad but all in all was the worst fishing any place I have ever been. The guys in Miss were catching plenty of small walleyes and pike but last I knew were looking for larger fish in another connecting lake that allegedly has lakers and large pike.There are plenty of fish there, marked them all day long, just forgot the dynamite.Would be interested to hear how you do on size and numbers when you get back.Steve"
