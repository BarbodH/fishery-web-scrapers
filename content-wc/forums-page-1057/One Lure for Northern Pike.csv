Lost alot of good fish due to the lousy hook. I took about six to the bench grinder, though, and now I have some sticky sharp silver minnows. We will see how the pike like them in N. Ont. in two weeks!Hint: To increase your odds of hooking up with this lure...pry the hook open about 1/4"". This will open the gap between the lure and hook point and increase the odds of connecting."
509244,Guest,2000-07-25 13:26:00,0,"Thanks for the hint! I just got a new shipment of them in a couple weeks ago and they were all very sharp! Maybe they are getting better.....I will be heading up to N.Ontario on this Saturday and I am planning on using this as my primary lure. Normally an excellant lure to take along.Good luck in 2 weeks, I will let you know how my trip goes:-)Jeff"
509245,Guest,2000-07-26 11:38:00,0,Johson silver minnow 1 and 1/8 oz tipped with a 3 inch berkly power grub and a walleye gulet. Also try a cranes crank bait in 7 or 8 inches. Good luck
509247,Guest,2000-07-27 00:13:00,0,"ONE WORD FOR YEA, ""DAREDEVIL"", I CAUGHT AND RELEASED ONE OF THE LARGEST PIKE ON A 3"" DAREDEVIL CALLED THE 5 OF DIAMONDS WITH A RED ROOSTER-TAIL ON IT, THE BLADE IS YELLOW WITH 5-RED DIAMONDS ON THE BLADE,WORKED FOR ME"
509246,Guest,2000-07-27 03:17:00,0,"Here's another endorsement for the Johnson Silver Minnow. As a teaser, add a white or yellow Uncle Josh Bass Strip and use an irregular retrieve. Works in weeds, wood and structure breaks. Killer!!!!! (second option: 3/4oz. to 1 oz. bucktail jig with a little pork or plastic dressing...works great in deeper water.)"
509233,Randy,2000-07-24 14:28:00,53,"If you had to take one lure into NW Canada around Mid-June to fish for Mid-Large Sized Northern Pike which lure would you take? Please specify brand, size and color if possible. I'm updating my Canada tackle box."
509234,chrism,2000-07-24 18:05:00,429,"#1 - 9"" suick (or lindy) plug in sucker pattern...#2 - a very large silver spoon#3 - on calmer days, a big blaze orange floating plug with no lipPlease if anyone can access the lindy plugs drop me an e-mail!"
509236,miksup,2000-07-24 18:56:00,297,"I've been fishing the northern half of Rainy Lake for 30 years all over Ash Bay and up to Devil's Cascades. I use several baits now, like Bill Lewis Ratl-traps and such but if I had to choose only one I would go with Daredevils, black and white or green and white in 3 inch long blades. I've been using catch and release for over 15 years and all I want is action, as much as I can get. I've caught fish up to 15 pounds with one at 41 inches and 20 pounds with these babies. You can't argue with success and there's a reason that Daredevils are the single largest selling artificial lure of all time. Mike."
509237,Guest,2000-07-24 19:22:00,0,"Amen to the daredevils and the suick !! If your arms get tired of throwing the lumber and you want excitement on top - try the mr twister prop baits in fire tiger or bullfrog bucktails.It's a goofy looking bait that only came out to play when we tried to catch something on everything in our tackle boxes. I never made it through my box because this outfished everything and everybody. Weeedless, fast, and fairly light for a big bait.I need more lures like another hole in the head but needless to say I will be picking up a few more of these."
509235,Guest,2000-07-24 20:19:00,0,"Ditto for the Daredevils! 1 1/2 oz sizeanother spoon that I like is a Red Eye Wiggler 1 oz, in red/white or chartruse/yellow for clear water and the bronze for stained water.Do use Rattle Traps in the 1 oz size Like the fire tiger color."
509238,RANGER,2000-07-25 04:58:00,4341,Daredevils!! No-brainer for me!!RANGER
509239,Guest,2000-07-25 06:02:00,0,Mepps #5 with a red and white blade or Chartruese/floresent orange/black blade.
509240,Guest,2000-07-25 07:53:00,0,"Without a doubt it would be the Eppinger Red Eye Wiggler in firetiger, 1oz. You can burn it over weeds, or you can slow roll it along a deep weed edge. The only modification is switch the factory hook with a 4/0 VMC cone cut treble (more hookups!)...best day on the water...16 for 20 in about 2.5 hours.Other than that...I have had good luck with Ghost Minnow safety pin style spinners. 1/2oz white and green."
509241,Guest,2000-07-25 08:08:00,0,3/4oz. Johnsons Silver Minnow! Am I the only one having luck with this lure:-)?Jeff
509242,Guest,2000-07-25 10:07:00,0,"Dont forget the TOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in my neck of the woods thats all they want, Icatch them and Im not even fishing for them."
