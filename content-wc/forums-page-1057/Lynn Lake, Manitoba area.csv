509272,Guest,2000-07-25 14:32:00,0,Yes I just had the best trip ever up there at Wolverine Lodge. That is where I would go and I am going there as many times as I can afford. The owner of the Lodge has controll of American fisherman and has been managing the lake for 10yr or so. It's a no kill lake for Pike and a slot on walleye. We caught 100 to 150 3 to 5lbs walleye everyday!! We caught 1 40in pike 2 39in and many over 36in and I wasn't even fishing for them. I was told there are alot of good lakes in the area but because of the managing of this lake it's the BEST!!!!
509273,Guest,2000-07-26 11:43:00,0,Thanks for the info!...Was wondering if i can drive to that lake? Is there camping areas there? Any help would be a big help as we`re leaving sunday morning. Thanks! Steelrider
509274,Guest,2000-07-26 14:42:00,0,The lake is named Vanderkerchove (I hope this is correctly spelled). Other than Wolverine Lodge there are only a few (3 or 4) private cabins on this lake. The lake is 25-30 miles NW of Lynn Lake and there are a couple of other lakes and at least 1 campground on the road from Lynn Lake. I do not know if there is public assess on Vanderkerchove other than through Wolverine. If you can figure out how to get on the lake the fishing is well worth the hundreds of miles of real bad road it takes to get there. Trailering a boat up there is going to result in a lot of road rash and wear and tear to your trailer.
509275,Guest,2000-07-26 15:16:00,0,"Wolverine Lodge has 2 or 3 camp sites for 25 U.S. money, that includes boat launch fee. If you camp else where you would have to pay 10 to lauch your boat, you also have to get a lodge stamp to fish the lake. I think Berg Lake has camping and Zed Lake does for sure. It would be worth the extra money to camp right on the Lake, because the roads are prety rough. It's well worth it though. GOOD LUCK"
509276,Guest,2000-07-27 07:45:00,0,"Thanks for the info guys! We will probably hire a guide to show us the lake, so hope there won`t be a problem getting the stamp from the lodge. It`s gonna be a long trip but i feel like a little kid again because of the anticipation of being on a lake that far from where we usually fish up there. We use to go to Reed lake further south, well since 1984, but we`re getting a little bored with the same old lake. We`re looking forward to lockin` horns with some big gators too! Thanks again! Steelrider"
509277,Guest,2000-07-27 14:40:00,0,"Does anyone know how to get information on ""Wolverine Lodge""? Do they have a website? Interested in rates, accomodations, fishing regs etc. Thanks for the help!! Marty"
