509228,Guest,2000-07-25 09:41:00,0,"From looking at other web sites it seems that if you are not a resident of Canada you do not need to meet the Canadian requirements, but your boat must have the equipment required in the country/state where the boat is registered.You should check the Canadian Coast Guard web site to confirm this before your trip up."
509229,Guest,2000-07-26 10:08:00,0,"Make sure you contact the Canadian Coast Guard or th O.P.P. as there have been many changes to the regs and increased fines (surprise)since last year and the O.P.P. are taking on the look of ""police state"" instead of trying to help or warn people more and more, they just love American Money.Be sure and safe. Best Regards, Big Al."

On Wednesday the OPP (actually OPW, I think) came over to check our boat, they were looking for: life preservers, fire extinguisher, boat registration, licenses, horn/whistle, alcohol (which we had 5 cans and showed them, but they were OK with it as long as it wasn't OPENED in the boat) and the fish in the livewell. They were courteous and professional but they were thorough.RANGER"

I think that when they charge someone it is for good reason. The officers are writing a lot of speeding tickets these days, especially at night. The reason.............. over 100 moose and vehicle collisions on the north shore of Lake Superior. Good fishing: Frank"

SO REMEMBER SAFTEY FIRST!!"
