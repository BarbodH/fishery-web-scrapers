509289,Guest,2000-07-28 08:37:00,0,"Just came back from 2 weeks in Canada. Take plenty of orange jigheads in 1/8 & 1/4 oz. Jigheads and a minnow is all you need for walleye.Pike will almost bite on anything. I used 1 1/2 oz. Johnson Silver Spoon also a 7"" Rapala in perch color, worked good over the tops of weed beds. Pop-Rs are all you need for smallies. Cast close to the rocks and fish out about 10 feet, any farther out and you'll get bit off by a pike unless you use a invisileader by South Bend. Good Luck Bo"

Smallmouth were all over a nightcrawler (hook and splitshot rig). Pike will hit on anything (spinnerbaits, rat-l-traps). Remember when all else fails, livebait puts fish in the boat."
