509157,bill brown,2000-07-18 20:45:00,20,Anyone fish this lake...looking for any info. available. Have fished nearby for years. Thanks in advance.
509158,Guest,2000-07-18 21:34:00,0,"Amisk is cree indian for ""beaver"" therefore most of the locals refer to it as the latter. I haven't fished there yet this year but the Sturgeon Weir river is usually the hot spot( sometimes all year). HIRE A GUIDE, this lake is full of shallow reefs, many motors have fell victim to them. Minnows uasually work fine in theses norhtern lakes. If in the area Jan Lake is another good lake for wally's ( also a reefy lake too)."
509159,Kurt,2000-07-29 07:08:00,47,A co-worker of mine recently went to Amisk. when the weather was good enough to get out they did very well. Mostly on a river that was about 20 miles from their camp. He goes there every summer for about a week. Send an e-mail to [email protected] if you want to get more details.
