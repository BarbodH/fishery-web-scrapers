509104,Jesse-WI,2000-07-17 19:33:00,534,"Yes, it is. A 20+mile section on the Ft Francis side. We ran into it coming back on the 8th of July. The road was muddy but okay in general. The large number of constructions waits however were a pain. We ignored advice and did not take rt 17 through Sioux Narrows. That direction is suppose to be mostly new road and only about 20 miles farther."
509105,Guest,2000-07-17 20:01:00,0,"Jeff,If you do a search or look further down, there is a post that 502 is under construction. But no problems were reported.But this year, we took 11 out of Fort Francis to 71 to 17 and back to Vermilion Bay. It took about 15 minutes more and was more miles, but it is a lot better for driving, especially if you are doing it in the dark. I found it less stressful, especially in an older vehicle.If you go thru Vermilion Bay, consider it.Fritz"
509106,Karl,2000-07-17 21:19:00,63,"Just got back on Saturday. It added about 25 minutes to travel time. Loose, wet gravel, 25-30 miles an hour, and several waits for single lane traffic. On the positive side, several miles were already done - beautiful new, wide blacktop. Should be great for next year's trip."
509107,Guest,2000-07-18 18:08:00,0,WE WERE UP 502 GOING NORTH ON SAT MORN 7/8/00 ABOUT 5AM WITH NO TRAFFIC STOPS THUR CONSTRUCTION AREA(15 MILES). ON WAY HOME 7/15/00 WENT THRU CONSTRUCTION ABOUT 6:30 AM WITH ONLY MINOR DELAY. I GUESS IT DEPENDS WHEN YOU GO THRU THE CONSTRUCTION ZONE.THEY MUST HAVE PAVED ONE SIDE AFTER I GOT THRU.
509108,Guest,2000-07-20 09:33:00,0,Took that route last week going in and coming back. I have got to warn everyone how bad it is. I was driving a Chev pickup and didn't have any mudflaps on the back wheels. That road is gravel for miles. When I got home and cleaned up the boat and trailer I found to my horror that the rocks kicked up by the truck beat the ##### out of my trailer. The paint was knocked off many areas of it and the fenders which are plastic are gouged badly. I will have to repaint some of the trailer areas. I wasn't driving very fast as you really can't since there are so many construction spots that slow everyone down. So if you are going to drive that road get some mudflaps for your vehicle.
509109,Eyesore,2000-07-21 14:00:00,455,"Anyone know when 502 will be done? By that, I mean fully paved."
509110,Karl,2000-07-23 19:33:00,63,"At the current rate of 30 kilometers, maybe in five years. But they did a great job on highway 72 (70 kilometers) in one season.In a way, I was hoping they wouldn't fix it at all. Used to fish in northern Wisconsin, until they built an interstate highway all the way to Minocqua. All of a sudden, everyone with a jet ski was able to zoom up there every weekend. Prices on everything doubled. The interstate was the end of fishing."
