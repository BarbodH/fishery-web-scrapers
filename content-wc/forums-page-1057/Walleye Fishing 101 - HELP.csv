I have been reading this board alot here lately.(Great Posts) I read alot about jigging w/minnows, nightcrawlers ,leeches - crawler harness,spinner harness, 3 way rigs, bottom bouncers. I have a basic idea here, but is the an internet site with diagrams on how these rigs are setup. I will have a guide, but the more I know before I go, the better.Thanks for the help in advance.Good Fishing"

508601,Guest,2000-07-29 11:44:00,0,"I have just returned from Canada and have gone for many years. The best luck I have had with catching walleye is jigging. 1/8 to 1/4 oz. I use the 1/4 oz. on windy days and deeper water, but I prefer the lighter jig for a slower fall. Orange jig heads seem to work best. Tip the jig head with a minnow. Run the hook through the mouth and out the gill then hook the minnow in the meat of the back. This keeps the minnow alive longer not going through any vital organs. I have caught up to 4 walleye with the same minnow. If the walleye are not active you can let the jig hit the bottom and then slowly drag it across the bottom and if they are active the jigging method of letting it hit bottom and then jigging it up a foot or two will work. This method has produce many walleye for me and surprisinly two 15 lb. Northern pike. Good luck fishing and I hope this will help. It is also a good idea to take plenty of these jig heads with you they catch rocks too."

White, chartreuse, and brown/orange (crawdad) tails w/ pink, orange or shiny metallic jig heads should be all you need and then some.If you can't boat at least 50 fish a day without working too hard try a differant lake. A guy can't drive that far if the fish don't jump in the boat !!steve"
508603,Guest,2000-07-30 07:54:00,0,I agree with Steve out of 15 trips never put anything on my line other then a jig or lure same go's for my Dad 25 trips. Jigging or trolling has always worked as far as I could tell we were out fished vary rarely by live bait and that was more due to knolage of the lake.
