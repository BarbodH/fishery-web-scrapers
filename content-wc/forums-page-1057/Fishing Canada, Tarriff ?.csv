I would like to know the following: 1) How much gas can I take into Onterio? 2) How much alcohol can be taken in tarriff free? 3) I will be pulling my boat and would like to know if they will need anything from me to enter the country, things like proof of insurance, registration or anything else. Even if you do not know all of the answers, if you could let me know where I could find the information I would certainly appreciate it. Sincerely, Bow"

Considering the exchange rate, the price of booze up there can be cheaper than in the states.No problems taking your boat, and as far as gas, I've heard so many different things in here, I would hate to steer you wrong. Do a search for canadian customs, it should help. Good Luck with the fishing!"
