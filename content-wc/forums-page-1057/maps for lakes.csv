509343,Steve,2000-07-31 18:16:00,259,Does anyone have any info or adress of places i could send to ....to find if a lake has been mapped? I would like to get a map of Horwood lake in NE Ontario..it was dammed years ago (for whatever reason?) so I'm hoping it may have been mapped. Dont have a clue as to which dept. to ask. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again
