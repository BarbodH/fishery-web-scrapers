509300,Guest,2000-07-28 21:52:00,0,Next year at Lake tobin in saskatchewan there is a good chance it is going to be all catch and release.
509301,Pikeman,2000-07-30 19:30:00,93,"Hi there,I don't think it is going to be all catch and release. From what i hear it is going to be something more like:A: Extend the slot limit by 10 CM (4 inches)B: No walleye over 55 CM (21 inches)The premiers cup has already gone to rule B.I think these regs. are long overdue.Pikeman"
509302,Dave,2000-07-31 18:10:00,258,"I agree, Pikeman. The sign by the boat launch says the new slot for walleye will be 55-80cm for 2001. This is OK, but what about all the fish that never have a chance to get to 55cm? Biologically speaking, a minimum size limit somewhere around 60-65cm would make more sense (i.e. no walleye under 60 can be kept). This would give them a chance to spawn a few times before they can be taken from the system. Anyway, I have no problem throwing fish back if it means I'll be catching them in the same system 15 years down the road. Cheers, Dave"
