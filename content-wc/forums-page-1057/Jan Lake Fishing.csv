509248,Guest,2000-07-24 15:08:00,0,I will be going to Jan Lake the first week of August and would like information about fishing and conditions of the lake. Is this the best lake around the Flin Flon area for walleye and northern pike?
509249,chrism,2000-07-24 19:47:00,429,"Are you talking Jan lake Saskatchewan?If so, there are a lot better fishing lakes in the area of Flin flon - Cranberry lakes, Athapap., and that general area. I've fished Jan before and it was notorious for small pike and spotty walleye, but in all fairness, that was a while ago. May I ask why you chose Jan lake?Regardless, have a good time and bring the bug juice!"
509250,Guest,2000-07-25 07:25:00,0,I've been fishing Reed Lake in Manitoba and would like to find a new lake to fish. Have camper and boat and would like to try my luck in a new lake. A three hundred mile radius of Reed Lake is fine by me. Any suggestions? How are the lakes by Lynn Lake?
509251,chrism,2000-07-25 16:49:00,429,"The lakes up near LL are good I hear - never been there myself. However, I just got back from a week trip to Cedar lake, North of Grand Rapids, Man. Fishing was awesome, landed numerous northerns over 35"" and a dozen walleye over 26"", and caught a lot of fish...don't know how many for sure, but we ran out of our 10 dozen crawlers even though we were cutting them into thirds...and we only fished a fraction of the lake!It is real big water, so if the wind kicks you' re in for a ride (I think it is about 11 miles across)... There are a few lodges North of Grand rapids that are drive to- they do rent boats but bring your own if you have. That's my best recommendation for the places I've been at this time of the year."
509252,Guest,2000-07-26 16:53:00,0,"I live in Flin Flon, Manitoba and if there is not any good fishing at Jan Lake why do dozens of people from F.F drive 1 hour all the way to Jan just to catch and release 100 Walleye a day. The fishing is there is fantastic fo walleye(1-3 pound range). I suspect any who cannot catch them there does not know how to fish. Also Jan is a very reefy lake so hire a guide. Jan Lake Lodge is a very nice place to stay(4 star lodge)."
