508762,Guest,2000-06-26 17:00:00,0,I am headed to Ontario this Friday. What is the law concerning fish in the live well? Thanks
508763,jimbo,2000-06-26 17:11:00,223,DEAD DEAD DEAD----If inyour boat dead-I was checked and passed-SET THE HOOK
508764,KnottyBuoy,2000-06-27 05:39:00,110,I was aware of that regulation for no live fish in the boat for Lac Seul area.........did not know it was for the entire Providence........can that be true?.....
508765,Guest,2000-06-29 20:35:00,0,"I believe that it differs by areas. Ask your resort operator about the law on the lakes you are going to fish. They don't want you getting arrested. The resort where we stayed had a list of the most common violations for the area, things that we needed to avoid. They also had a checklist of required equipment which was sent to us before the trip."
508766,Guest,2000-07-29 11:06:00,0,"I just returned from Minnitaki lake just south of Souix Lookout, Ontario. On that lake all fish on board you boat must be dead except for bait fish. One fellow on the lake was stopped by MNR and had one live walley on the baot and was fined $78.00 canadian. It varies by region and lakes but it is my understanding most areas are using and inforcing the dead fish rule. I hope you have a great time fishing. Pam"
508767,Frank from TBay,2000-07-30 14:56:00,312,"Check your regs for the lake you are going to. Some lakes have a no stringer or livewell rule for certain species. It is not a rule across the entire NW area of the province. When in doubt talk to the MNR. Do not take chances, do your homework. As the saying goes ""If you fail to plan, you plan to fail"". Good fishing: Frank"
508768,Guest,2000-07-30 16:27:00,0,"I have fished Quetico Park for the past 13 years & I have been checked a few times by the Canadian Ranger who was making sure we had our proper papers with us ,and with the exception of one time being kidded about a 19"" walleye not being enough for our group to eat, so maybe we should give it to him for lunch ,we have never been informed that having live fish on a stringer is illegal. What is the reason for not allowing fish to be kept alive in the ""LIVEWELL""?"
508769,Frank from TBay,2000-07-30 18:05:00,312,"The live fish rule was brought into play because people were culling fish as they caught larger ones. The released fish were dying. On a lot of lakes here in Ontario if you catch it, you release it right away, or kill it and add it to your daily limit. Lake Nipigon with its large trout was one of the first lakes to enact this rule. A guy would catch a 15lber drag it around for a couple of hours, catch a 20lber and on and on. Good fishing: Frank"
508770,Guest,2000-07-31 19:20:00,0,"Thanks for the information although, we have to buy our license & pay our camping fee to the Canadian warden when we enter Quetico Park and never has that issue been mentioned. Maybe the ""no live fish in your possession"" rule doesn't apply in this area. However the way you describe what was happening before I can understand why they enforce the rule. Sure hope the dead fish in the livewell don't spoil before you get them cleaned !! Marty"
