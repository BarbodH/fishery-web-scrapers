509186,Buckeye,2000-07-20 14:52:00,592,"We will be going from Toledo to Wawa Ontario in a couple of weeks. We're taking Rt 23 from Toledo to Flint, then I-75 north to the Soo, then Hwy 17 north to Wawa. Does anyone know of any major construction areas on this route that should be avoided?Thanks!"
509187,Guest,2000-07-23 14:06:00,0,"I just got back from a fly-in out of Wawa and the drive up was ok but the drive back was buggered up by construction back ups. The main problems occured on I-75. I have learned that the north bound will be open all the way to the Soo Friday and Saturday to minimise the interruption for people heading up north for the weekend. The problem is that the south bound I-75 is down to one lane at three points south of West Branch Friday and Saturday. This makes sense as what goes up must come down and they are trying to minimise travel delays, the up bound lanes are open Friday and Saturday but the down bound lanes will continue to be worked during these times and you can expect delays. If I knew of any alternate routes I would have taken them as the delay added about one and a half hours to my travel time. Steven B."

509189,Guest,2000-07-26 19:25:00,0,"Hi Buckeye,the fishing was good. The cabin had a dock that sat on a rock ledge which enabled us to catch walleye in the evening which really impressed me. We also caught some nice walleye off some boulder piles in the morning which averaged around 3 pounds and some 10 plus pound pike which were great fun. Have a great trip.Steven."
