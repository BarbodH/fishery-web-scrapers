509192,Guest,2000-07-22 06:12:00,0,"Ron, I hate seeing no responses, so I thought I would chime in here with a possibility to check into.Depending on where you live and what your family needs are, a place that I have dreamed of going for a couple of years is Le Reserve Beauchene.The resort owns tens of thousands of acres and has a lakes all over it that can be accessed by car or 4X4.Species available are northern, smallies, walleyes, lake and brook trout.I haven't been there (YET!), but a couple of people that I have talked to said it was a fabulous place. No fly-ins, but doesn't sound like you need one.They do have a website, www.beauchene.com.Just wanted to pass this on."
509193,Guest,2000-07-22 08:02:00,0,"I have not been to this lodge either, but Lake Kaby is a fly in with both basic accomodations as well as luxury accomodations. I think it's north of Wawa / Thunder Bay area. Had some friends who went there about 5 years ago and did well. They said accomodations and hospitality were great.You might find info at this web site:#####://www.northernexperience.com/northern.htmThe real name of the lake is about 20 letters long, but it's abbreviated to ""Kaby."""
509194,Guest,2000-07-22 09:46:00,0,I have heard that Kesagami lodge is a fly in lodge with AMAZING pike and walleye fishing(hundred or more walleye a day)...Canadian sport fishing and the Real fishing shows have both endorsed this lodge for excellent fishing and accomodations. Just research around the internet if you are interested...you should find lots of info...tight lines...
509195,Guest,2000-07-22 14:35:00,0,"I fished Lindbergh's Reindeer Lake Lodge last July and had the greatest fishing trip ever. Our group of four caught many pike over 40"" and three over 45. We couldn't have had greater treatment. It's a top flight lodge. If you go ask for George or Tommy as your guide."
509196,Guest,2000-07-25 14:56:00,0,My vote go's to Wolverine Lodge. Reindeer Lake has good fishing also but and a windy day could keep you grounded I know I've seen the 4 to 6ft sweels. If you go to Wolverine Lee would be my first choice for a guide and Doug my second. But if your a fair fisherman you don't need a guide the'll tell you right were to go. The lake has 4x4 white signs to help you get around and bouys marking the shallow reefs.
