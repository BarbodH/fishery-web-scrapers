1222857,CMesserschmidt,2010-07-27 14:36:00,1006,I just put in my buddy's Navionics Canada chip in my Lowarance H20 and Minnitaki and most of the other lakes in this area all have info. It isn't 1 foot contours or anything but good enough depths and hazard areas for me.He couldn't figure out how to get the chip to work on his so I figured it out on mine. We are heading up there next Thursday so we are getting everything in order before we go...
1224716,fire105,2010-08-03 09:36:00,40,Make sure you check the date on the chip. I had an 06 chip and the lake was shown. So if you buy it from ebay or any other store check the date.
1224722,CI_Guy,2010-08-03 10:38:00,2118,We were up there earlier this summer. Minitaki is on the Navionics chip but is so inacurate that it is almost useless. Pelican and Abrams were much more acurate. There were many places on Minitaki that showed 20' to 45' of water and there were rocks above the surface of the water. There were also spots that the map showed shallow water and it was 30' deep. We wanted it for hazard areas and to look for potential fishing spots but it was almost useless on Minitaki.
1224995,CMesserschmidt,2010-08-04 07:59:00,1006,Thanks for that update! I guess we will have to pay extra attention on the taki....
