1207976,walleyeduran,2010-06-07 21:18:00,286,"Well I just returned form Gull Rock lake two days ago and got a chance to read BLUEBERRY HEAD's post. Sorry when I posted before that I was not logged in, I was on my brother's lap top and am not used to regestering when I make a post. (I had a hard time getting back on the puter after 3 of us boated 250 walleyes in 5 hours.) I would like to bring up BLUEBERRY HEAD's remarks about my name (Duran). ""I am suppose to go back to Arizona, or wait a minute, they don't like my kind there, better go to Mexico""!!!!! I would like BLUEBERRY HEAD to know that I am a Norwegian from N.W. WI that works in the woods for a living and am very willing to invite him up to the great north woods for an all paid vacation. If you are willing to take me up on this incrediable invite to the vacation land of WI, you must also agree that you will make arrangements for your ride back South. Once again, if you are going to make crap posts, register and quite hiding behind the key board. P.S. Now and a again, everyone has to grow up and become a MAN!!!!!"
1207977,Bigfish10702,2010-06-07 21:23:00,60,"I was planning on bringing a flat of crawlers along, but I might have to spend that money on some plastic. I did Ok with the live ones but gulp sure sonds like less hassle. I did try jigging some Gulp grubs on the Indian Lake Chain last fall, but did not have any luck with them."
1207988,jkwildhunting,2010-06-07 21:53:00,361,We bring live crawlers with us also but hardly get touched. When are you heading up? BTW..you have a PM
1208035,Tonyo,2010-06-08 06:42:00,212,"A quick response to Gullrock Fishing and Bait. We just got back and our group of 12, with 4 boats, used 115 dozen minnows and a flat of 500 crawlers. My opinion is we go to catch fish. The walleyes preferred the minnows but we did decent on crawlers when we would run out of minnows. As for the Gulp products, we have all tried them with very limited success on Gullrock. If the bite was incredible, they would work ok but nothing like live bait. I go once a year and am there to have a great time fishing. If that means I spend a few extra bucks for live bait, oh well. My suggestion is use the minnows and have a awesome experience. It is an unbelievable fishery. Take advantage of that and have a good week. TonyO."
1208105,jkwildhunting,2010-06-08 10:18:00,361,"it has its time and place and another thing is how much confidence you have in it. I have ALOT of confidence in gulp and will use it and can prove to you it works EXCELLENT.Last september we pulled into gull rock. Camp owner goes its been a wierd year and the fishing is SLOW they were having ""summer"" in september and we knew a group that had been there for a few days and they were fishing all the known spots on the lake they came in that morning happy as could be cause they caught 8 walleyes. We got ready unloaded and were fishing by 3-4 and had caught over 30 walleyes in the same area on gulp in just a few hours."
1208210,Guest,2010-06-08 15:17:00,0,"The fairy seems to have a dislike of the Gullrock area. He also goes by another name, something like dumpster or something that rhymes with this. It's even more interesting knowing what his job is and what his community would think of him telling these fabricated stories. He used to come up with a friend, relative and neighbor but developed a sour taste and apparently hasn't come back. He even had his wife posting on the subject some time back. To each their own. Glad to hear you had a WONDERFUL trip to the north land. We will be heading up later but sure am looking forward to being there."
1208267,walleyeduran,2010-06-08 17:48:00,286,"Bingo, I know exactly the person you are talking about, I know the problems he had, I know where he lives and I know what he does for a living. Hopefully he will not fall off of his wall and start registering and posting useful info. Duran"
1208298,johnboat,2010-06-08 19:07:00,2014,"Thanks LarryM for the note you had left us! Always nice to hedge your bet a little. For me it was 3/8 chartruse short shank red hook with a vertical presentation all week. The bite was usually good but was a light bite at first then they were more aggressive as the week went on. The northerns at Fishermans Point were going nuts after the walleyes. My boy netted a 39 1/2 incher with my walleye in his mouth ( quite a rush, photo, then ker-plunk back in the lake) and I bet our group had another dozen or so episodes but none hung on long enough to get their picture taken. Nice to meet you Tackleman!! See you again next year! Keep'er On The Bottom!! John B.O.A.T."
1208364,Rock Hound,2010-06-08 22:12:00,51,"I have enjoyed reading the posts on bait. I have had luck with everything. Our group used to only use leeches (when you could bring them across the border). The majority of our group still uses leeches (now we buy them in Canada), but many now bring night crawlers, and a couple of guys use crawlers only. Once in a while I take minnows in my boat. I personally am a big fan of the Gulp Alive, and sometimes it does out fish live bait, but sometimes you can't get much. I always take some in the boat. One stretch last year I caught 12 walleyes in about 4 minutes on one Gulp minnow/jig before either of the other two guys got even one in the boat on live bait - that entire afternoon I killed them on Gulp - later that evening, live bait was the ticket - who knows????? The amazing thing about the posts is that I read very little about leeches, and those that I do read don't seem to be very high on them. Our group has always done really well with leeches on Gullrock . . . it didn't matter if the water was cold, or if it was really hot. The vast majority of trips we have been on, I don't ever remember boats around us using minnows catching more fish than us - and usually not doing as well as us (I realize we pay more attention to our group than others, but we often have people ask ""what are you guys using?""). I do fish with some pretty experienced fishermen, and leeches are something we use a lot of throughout the year (and crawlers) - so they are obviously a confidence bait for most of us. I agree with many of the posts that confidence baits are the ones to stick with - but a lot of times I do think leeches are part of reason for the success. My brother's father-in-law and his group is usually there a week before us, and they have great success on minnows, and my brother says they cannot believe we use totally leeches. To each their own - it is a great fishery. Fish don't just jump in the boat, but if you get a good pattern going, I do think you could have success with whatever you like to use - some bites are tougher than others, especially if there is no wind or if the wind changes directions every day. We seem to mix things up for a different experience throughout the week or even throughout the day. Often at evening we troll crankbaits (I don't read too many posts of that either), and usually have luck with that too. I am sure they work all day long, but for whatever reason, we don't use them in the morning or during the day. Does anyone else have a lot of luck with leeches at Gullrock? How about cranks? Also, we have had great luck during mayfly hatches with jigs and half of a night crawler. What are other people's secrets during a mayfly hatch? 3 days until we leave . . . I can't think of anything else! . . except the ""must do"" list I have at work before we leave on Friday - It will get done. It is nice to read these posts - I like fishing with new people to learn new things, and if I can't do that, at least I can read your ideas. Thanks to everyone for sharing - and if you read this long rambling post until the end, congratulations on your stamina for putting up with my random thoughts!"
1225960,jkwildhunting,2010-08-08 10:00:00,361,"Love the internet cops...Believe me....I know the rules on gull rock anything over 18"" goes back and i like that rule do you know how many times i have released a walleye over 25"" in iowa or Mn and people around me get mad because of it.I just meant to say have stories/pictures of walleyes over 25"" not to many of them being caught rite now on the lake so will work for them get away from the crowds and get em!"
1208759,Rock Hound,2010-06-09 21:52:00,51,"I agree about the wind. Wind is a walleye fisherman's friend. A wet boat ride and sea legs are well worth it! A couple of days with the same wind on Gullrock makes the entire trip. Wind from the West, fish bite the best!"
1208844,Guest,2010-06-10 07:07:00,0,"I agree with wind and walleyes, but one of the reasons we have grown to love Gull Rock is the bite going on in the lee-ward side of islands when the wind is kicking up. Good electronics have helped us produce some of our best bites in calm water while watching everyone else battling the elements out in open water. Don't assume those sitting out of the wind are not catching any fish. Gull Rock is an awesome lake in this respect. Big water is kicked up, we simply graph the lee-ward structure (usually off the deep water) and after checking a few spots, we usually run across one where the graph is loaded up."
1208999,jkwildhunting,2010-06-10 15:37:00,361,"Not saying you cant catch fish on the calm sides but i think you will have better luck gettin a ""big"" fish out on the rough side of the islands....and another thing is we have hooked alot of huge northerns on the windy side the northerns seem to go on the prowl when that wind kicks up"
1210087,Blue Fin,2010-06-14 16:02:00,47,"Hello all! Our group just got back from Gull Rock on Sat and we had a pretty good trip. We had really nice weather, which doesn't always mean you have the best fishing and I think that was the case for us. The fish seemed to be a little more scattered due to the earlier spring. No matter where we went, we caught fish. Walleyes were anywhere from 6 to 25 feet...points and islands....rocks and weeds. But we never really had one of those days when it was nonstop action. We did have some afternoons that were really good, but the mornings were typically slow for our group. We used a lot of minnows and leeches and had good luck with both of them. We brought up a bunch of gulp last year and the live bait outfished it 4 to 1. So this year we didn't use it much if at all. But I honestly think that you need to mix it up. You throw minnows all day long and eventually the fish will want to see something different.Funny that cranks were mentioned, because we came across alot of suspended fish and talked about trying it, but never did. Next year we will for sure. And we had more northerns attack hooked walleyes than ever before. The pike were really horny for some reason but the walleye bite was mostly a light one. One guy in our group caught a 42"" and 43"" pike (19 and 20 lbs). And another caught a 30.25"" walleye. And it was just a pig. I am guessing that it was around 11.5 to 12 lbs.On the flip side of that, there are also a lot of hungry fish out there. We caught a bunch of walleyes that were 20 to 24 inches and just looked and felt thin. I am not 100% sure why but have any others noticed that?Colors - something with some green in it was pretty hot last week. Pink was good. Had very little luck on Chart/Orange."
1225753,fish bookie,2010-08-07 11:57:00,53,anyone out there who has been on the rock lately be there in 3 weeks to do some fishing for wallys and pike any big ones being cought this year thanks fish bookie
1225754,fish bookie,2010-08-07 12:04:00,53,any one up fishing on the rock
1225849,Guest,2010-08-07 20:26:00,0,Got back about a week ago and would have to say that on this trip we caught the most fish ever. Got low on worms with about three days to go so started breaking them in half to last longer and caught even more fish with a half and caught three to four on each half. Had two days where you almost got tired of catching them. Great weather (especially compared to last year's rain) and can't wait to get back up there. Best wishes on your stay and hope you have a safe trip to and from.
1225867,jkwildhunting,2010-08-07 21:38:00,361,"Headed up this coming friday for the week. I am already loosing sleep Cant wait to get up there.Reports are saying lots and lots of fish just not many big ones. Will put the work on them and hopefully come home with a couple over 25"""
1225870,Moondog,2010-08-07 21:47:00,362,"I wish you good fishing but please don't ""come home"" with fish over 25 inches. These are almost always females that are probably 15-20 years old and NONE of the fish camps on Gull Rock allow harvesting of such valuable breeding stock. Eat some small ones. Man, this is scary. Remember the old adage about biting the hand that feeds you???"
1225912,bryhardt,2010-08-08 07:30:00,11,"I do believe (correct me if I'm wrong), but the ""Gull Rock Policy"" is any Walleye that is over 18"" goes back. I haven't been up there in 15 years, but it sure sounds like the fishing has greatly improved since the last decade and a half. Surely policies like this is what has been increasing the fish population. This is one of the reasons I am really looking forward to going back next week!"
1208601,jkwildhunting,2010-06-09 13:30:00,361,"I use leeches actually last year i only had a bag of the ""Jumbo 5inch"" leeches and only had a few left at the end of the week. They produced fish for me it was lil slower then the gulp crawlers but i have my eye on a new color. I prefer the ""jumbo"" leeches over the small 3"" ones i just think they look better behind spinners and bigger bait= bigger fish -Just went to the local sporting good store and found out they do carry the 5"" Jumbo leech in red sparkle....CANT WAIT It is new for 2010 its Black/Red Flake i think maybe the red may trigger fish a lil more but with that water maybe it wont make a difference at all but i will have a bag or two with me this year!Back home (Iowa) we troll cranks....ALOT. I have tried pulling crank baits around caught a few fish including some small northerns but nothing great!This year I may try 3 wayin we did this alot on Pool 4. 3 way with a stick bait behind maybe a large stick bait will trigger some bigger eyes!Another tip i kind of laugh at people when i see it. We had a few windy days last year on gull rock it was rough but by no means ""dangerous"" it was def rain gear weather as it was cool and lots of water gettin splashed in the boat but most of all the boats we seen were on the back sides of islands and out of the wind. Maybe everyone elses goal is to not catch alot of fish and just have ""fun"" but man we must of been the idiots that week but we were rockin and rollin on the windy sides of points and islands and it payed off as we were catching some really nice fish not many below 20"""
1206739,tackleman,2010-06-03 18:21:00,444,"After a 2 week layoff from the fishing, I headed over to 5 lakes lodge for minnows this morning and met John BOAT and TonyO. they said they were getting fish at the boot, fishermans point and the gullrock.I went to the flats by the clay banks and in 15 minutes had 4 in the live well (for tomorrows dinner) and had thrown back 4. Later in the day I went to the boot, got 2, then round island, got 1, then Iowa point, got 1. they all seemed to be in 20 -25 feet of water.hope this information helps"
1206798,Moondog,2010-06-03 21:47:00,362,Ditto on the fishing but where is Iowa Point???? Not familiar with that name???
1206799,Guest,2010-06-03 21:51:00,0,"Iowa point is directly across from the boot. Can be good fishing but last time i was up there, there were boats galore working the point."
1207392,Rock Hound,2010-06-05 21:30:00,51,"Thanks for the information Larry! - We'll be there in 6 days . . . sounds like fish could be anywhere next weekend. Maybe we'll find fish close to camp this year. No year is ever like the other, we always find at least one new spot each year. Sounds like the fish will be deaper than last. Thanks for the tips!"
1207493,jkwildhunting,2010-06-06 09:30:00,361,"Cant wait we are going lil later this year in August due to time conflicts but will find the fish!Last year we went in September everyone was struggling to catch fish it seemed like but we kept pulling 25+"" fish out!We strictly pull bottom bouncers/Spinners with GULP! Target bout 1-1.5mph and use about any gulp we want from crawlers to minnows to leeches They have all produced. Dont be fooled either alot of our bigger fish have came on orange or yellow colored nightcrawlers!We fish the point next to the boot as if you were going up lake to fisherman point is that Iowa point? Usuually no one ever there and we have absolutly get into em there!"
1207512,Bigfish10702,2010-06-06 10:41:00,60,"13 days to go here, can i get some info on the locations of named points? I have the map from the Goldenhook site, but I am not sure where some of the points named in threads are."
1207695,Tonyo,2010-06-07 05:32:00,212,"What a great week. It was sure nice to put a face with the name Tackleman. As for LarryM, thanks for the info. We had great luck all over the lake. My advice for those of you there or heading out, try summer locations for your bigger fish. We fished some of the flats and reefs with great success. Largest Walleye for the week was a 27"" and largest Northern was 41 1/2"". Lots of numbers and lots of quality 20""+ walleye. To all going, have a great week and the count down for next year begins today. TonyO ps. water temp when leaving was around 60. water level I would consider normal."
1207768,2746,2010-06-07 09:25:00,3206,"Glad to hear you had a good week Tony. The fish had begun moving toward summer locations when we were there in May so not surprised at what you found. We had not found the fish on the flats when we were there but knew it wouldn't be long. We were, in fact, going to try them again on Friday (5/28) but experienced some heavy rain and wind so decided to start home early. Each year we try to add some new locations to our experience but that's hard to do as the fishing is so good in our old spots we hate to leave and explore. This year, due to some strong winds a couple of days, we did work the south side more and that was a good learning experience."
1207851,Bigfish10702,2010-06-07 14:50:00,60,JK Have you had better luck with the gulp on the BB than with live bait? or is it about equal?Formerly Bigfish9
1207871,jkwildhunting,2010-06-07 16:37:00,361,"depends who you ask but in my point of view i think it fishes just as well if not better then live baitI just like the fact when im pulling spinners on BB i can catch 6-8 fish on a crawler instead of maybe 2 fish on a real crawler you dont have to get your hands in the crawler bedding and no reachin in the minnow bucket.Last year on our fly in lake i pulled a 27"" eye outta the water on the first day we only had few hours of daylight to fish that day 2 days later i got my PB a 30"" on gulp crawler I am one of the few that like/believe gulp can/will out fish livebait i have no point in switching back to livebait till my theory proves me wrong.Also nicer when lodges charge arm and a leg for a scoop of minnows i can use a bucket of 4"" gulp minnows instead of buying gosh who nows how many dozen minnows in a week!Have also had excellent luck on using the the gulp grubs on jigs if im jiggin i just put on a gulp grub no bait or other gulp lures just the grub and start stickin em that way!August cant come soon enough"
1205893,Blue Fin,2010-06-01 11:50:00,47,"Thanks for the info. We will be up there in a couple of days and the group's anticipation is at an all time high. We have been going to Canada to fish the past 10 years, but last year was our first here. Hopefully the big females are out and about this year."
1206213,Rock Hound,2010-06-02 07:35:00,51,"Larry,What was the water temp. when you were there, and what were the depths you found fish?"
1206241,Blue Fin,2010-06-02 09:05:00,47,"Also Larry, do you guys buy any leeches on your way up (Vermillion Bay) or do you stick to minnows or plastics? We are having a tough time, as a group, deciding what to get for bait. Last year we got a lot of leeches and they were not really hitting on them. I am also kicking around the idea of bringing up some crawlers. Thoughts?And we typically like to drift and jig. Any size or color hotter then others? Thanks"
1206252,2746,2010-06-02 09:35:00,3206,"We picked up leeches on our way up (week 21-28) and did not use them. Minnows were clearly the best bait. In our experience, however, leeches work better as the season progreses. You might get a 1/2 # at 4 seasons and give them a try. We always like to be able to change if the bite dictates. If they don't work you won't have wasted much. I've not bothered with nightcrawlers for a few years now but mostly because it's a hassel to haul them up. By the way, I sent you a pm earlier you might want to read befor you leave."
1206280,2746,2010-06-02 11:19:00,3206,"We were finding fish from 8 - 25 feet. That makes it a bit more of a challenge and means you need to keep trying something different when the bite slows. The shallow fish almost always came with the wind and were likely following bait fish into the shallows. By the time you get there they may be more consistant.(one evening we were catching slot fish in 8' off the channel to Keg with a strong SW wind and the next morning eaters in 25' off of burnt) Based on what we experienced we would start a new location or point in 15' and, if we found nothing, would start moving both ways from that depth until we located fish or determined to move on.Good luck hunting!"
1206649,Blue Fin,2010-06-03 13:12:00,47,Thanks Larry. I replied to your PM that you sent but I am not sure if I did it correctly. Hopefully you got it...when we get back from our trip I will be sure to give updates.
1206658,2746,2010-06-03 13:44:00,3206,I got it. Have a good trip!
1206662,2746,2010-06-03 13:53:00,3206,"P.S.I missed your question about color and size of jig. When we drift or slow troll we usually use a 3/8 or 1/2 oz weight with a 36"" plain snell with a colored hook and 1-2 red beads. We jig when we are anchored or stationary and then a 1/4 oz will do. I like pink but the orange/chart were working well for some of the others. Not sure I see a big preference for any certain color on this lake."
1206664,Blue Fin,2010-06-03 13:57:00,47,Pink it is...at least until all of my buddies are nailing them on the other colors Thanks again.

1204174,Blue Fin,2010-05-26 11:52:00,47,Last year was the first for our group on Gull Rock. We considered the trip very successful but most of the other fisherman claimed it was a slow week compared to past years. Well I hope that they are right. We will be up there on June 5th. Last year the water temps were pretty cold. I am wondering how the warmer water temps this year will effect the walleyes. Any advice. Thanks.

We were catching 20""+ walleyes off the dock last year. Can't wait. You're right...last year was very cold and wet. But it was one of the best years we ever had up there fishing. Good luck!"
1205353,Guest,2010-05-30 08:31:00,0,How's the blueberry hunting going at Wrights? Always enjoyed going up there for a fishing trip and ending up hunting blueberrys due to all the ski boats and watercraft in the area. But they are good in pancakes!
1205406,Guest,2010-05-30 14:12:00,0,If you don't have the guts to register on this site quite posting junk. I will give you my personal e-mail if you think this is a joke. Apparently you must have been one of the few individuals that was such a jerk that they got asked not to return to Wright's camp. Duran P.S. Waiting for you CHICKEN LITTLE !!!!!
1205427,luv2fishcanada,2010-05-30 16:11:00,41,"Blueberry posted the same crap last year. This will be my 26th year heading to Gullrock. Whether your staying at Golden Hook, Wrights, South Shore, or any other camp on this lake is fantastic. Thanks for all the good info this site offers. Heading to Gullrock on the 4th. can't wait."
1205457,Guest,2010-05-30 19:17:00,0,"You are correct, Gull Rock is a great lake, just some resorts cater to fisherman and some to other sorts of vacationers to each their own. Duran, go back to Arizona! Oh that's right, they harass your kind down there don't they! Go back to Mexico, leave the blueberries for us to eat! Golden Hook and South Shore are the way a fishing camp should be ran. But we all know, Lac Seul is a better overall lake, just wish they had more blueberries."
1205601,2746,2010-05-31 11:18:00,3206,"Just got back and fishing was very good. The walleys did begin moving out into the lake earlier this year but that did not affect the quality of fishing.....just the locations they were found in. The channel into Keg was still good, Burnt Island produced lots of eaters, the boot held fish from the toe all the way up the shaft and fisherman's point was very good, especially with a SW wind. We also spent one day around the many islands on the south portion fo the lake when the wind was up and out of the South and caught fish off of most points we tried. We were also catching walley off the dock at Five Lakes and folks at South Shore reported doing the same thing. There were clearly fewer boats on the lake this year (economy?) and that made fishing some of the more popular spots a little easier."
