I have gathered alot of information about Cedar Lake using the search function. Thought I would make my first post and maybe get a litle more information about the lake. We have fished Canada before (LOTW) so we are not totally green. When fishing for walleye's we prefer to jig. Any ideas anyone has about where to go or best colors on Cedar would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance........Hawghead"

For walleye's I've just used a one hook one bead snell with a full crawler trolled slow. You'll catch fish there. This is my third year in a row heading up there. Good Luck,"

1224129,hawghead101,2010-07-31 22:31:00,4,"Leaving the 11th, staying 2 nights at the Comfort Inn by Cablea's in Owatonna (dang the bad luck). Heading to Dryden on the 13th, then to camp on the 14th. This should break up the trip for us, so we will be good and rested in time to fish."
1225919,Kevin R,2010-08-08 07:48:00,305,I was in Cedar a couple days ago fishing was slow for walleye but did get some never had a hit from Pike or Musky we fished the south east end of the lake & time SQ area. Water was very dark with an alge bloom.
