1222265,labsrus,2010-07-25 18:27:00,557,"Had an interesting thing happen to our group ovr 4th of July weekend. We have been fishing the same lake for many years and our place was turned into fractional ownership last year. That was bad, good part is my friend was able to purchase a cottage on the same lake and we make several trips each year. While fishing a weedline in front of the new place, the owner came out and told us we could not fish his water. He even told us he was going to call the OPP and reprot us. We were a good 15 yards off shore trolling back and forth. Of course we were catching a few fish. What is the ruling for this type of thing. I am going back at the end of the week. I was thinking of asking him where his waer ends and the publics starts if he tries to chase me away again."
1222273,v-bay gord,2010-07-25 18:44:00,3168,There is no such thing as owning the water rights. Tell him to kiss your butt cheek..........
1222311,HighTech,2010-07-25 20:30:00,75,"VBay is correct in 99.9% of the cases. It is extremely rare but I am aware of one case where the land owner does own the water rights and the land under the water. The odds of you ever seening that in Ontario is almost impossible. Fish all you want along any shore on any lake. The case I referr to resulted from land flodding as the result of a dam, not a normal dam but a ""special"" dam. If you were fishing on the property Im describing, the owner could care less. Fish on enjoy the shore lines."
1222345,Skywagon,2010-07-26 05:54:00,1106,"To answer the question, yes more than likely it is owned by the Crown, with few exceptions. Ok, here is what always gets me: people drive 800 miles (or what ever) to experience nature, the beauty of Canada, get away from people, neighbours and town life, then a few have to fish in someone's back yard. Most of the people that have a house on the lake are proud of their surroundings and are happy to share the lake with others, but are not thrilled with others fishing in front of their house, kind of a personal space issue. Voices travel on water, imagine having people trolling in front of your house, talking loudly to be heard over the outboard noise, some can be heard swearing. Then there are those that have a need to cast lures around your boat dock, and at times even hitting your boat, that is always special. Hey guys, this is not Chicago, or the crowded lakes of Minnesota or Wisconsin, there are thousands of acres of water out there with out a house in site, enjoy the peace of it all, watch a loon, or maybe a moose swimming in the water, you came too far to waste your time looking at another house."
1222356,stinkycat,2010-07-26 06:17:00,2018,"In MN all the waters are public as far as I know. Thats the way it should be. Glad to hear our neighbors to the north have similar laws and regs. Not trying to stir the pot but, what gets me is when land owners think they own the water. Just the opposite of Skywagon. By putting out docks, boat lifts and anchored water toys they alter fishing habitat and in some cases severely damage the lake shore. They are also parking all these items on public property. They do not have the option to ""share"" the water, it is public. Now I am sure I am going to get blasted by someone but I also feel that when I am in front of a lake cabin/home that I will behave and not swear or talk real loud but I would behave the same in downtown Chicago or up on a remote lake. Bad behavior is bad behavior no matter where you are at. I would agree that with thousands of acres of water, I would try and stay away from developed lake shore but if I found my targeted species in front of a cabin/home I would not hesitate to fish that water responsibly. >02"
1222377,rebs,2010-07-26 07:08:00,7587,"I don't know if there is a fishing etiquette that covers such an issue, Good behavior and a friendly personality can go along way as far as getting along with people. As far as water rights to fish, there was an instance here on the upper river where a home owner came out yelling and screaming for two fishermen in a boat to get away from his shore line, they were catching small-mouth bass. The way I heard it they just kept on fishing and ignord the home owner until the home owner came out with a shotgun and threatened to shoot them. The fishermen called the sheriff on their cell phone and a marine unit was on the scene rather quickly. The sheriff witnessed the home owner with the shot gun in his hands waving it in the direction of the boat. One of the deputies went ashore and took the shotgun which was loaded, then took statements from both the home owner and the fishermen. Then they confiscated the shotgun and arrested the home owner for criminal intent to do bodily injury with a weapon.In the home owners statement he didn't want others to fish in front of his home and catch his fish. There was not anything in the news paper about the out come of this arrest, so perhaps the charges were dropped or perhaps it just didn't make the court news.My feelings would have been that no fish is worth getting shot over, so I would have just moved on to another spot. I don't know if these guys were casting along his dock or how close they were to the shore."
1222381,dewyg,2010-07-26 07:16:00,1006,"Same thing happend to me last year, the landowner started throwing rocks at my boat. I called the police they informed him that he did not own the water!!! I was fifty yards from shore"
1222393,cast_and_blast,2010-07-26 07:58:00,1098,"I used to fish bass tournaments (local, smaller scale) in MN and WI. We had an incident where during a mid-summer tournament we were fishing docks. This involves casting close to and under docks with bass tube jigs (all weights and hooks are inside the tube). We did have a homeowner screaming obscenities at us from inside her house - this was before we even got to her dock to fish. We bypassed her dock and finished the tournament (we were ~ 1 hour from weigh-in). On my partner's insistence we went back to the area and, sure enough, the obscenities started flying at us again. We pulled away from shore, called the local sherriff and provided them with a GPS location and a description of the house (obviously couldn't see any house numbers or fire numbers from the water). Took about 15 minutes and the sherriff showed up. He came out the end of the dock, waved us in and took our statement. She was tagged for harrassment of us while we were legally fishing on public water. Sherriff indicated that this was not the first incident involving this particular homeowner. Good luck! Scott"

1224389,tv4fish,2010-08-02 08:12:00,2694,"38bill and Blackmac: Not going to beat a dead horse here, BUT As both of your posts state, the key to this issue is ""legal access"". My scenario is where I own the property around this non-meandered lake. You would not have ""legal access"" to my lake, therefore the bed and water is private."
1224556,Blackmacs,2010-08-02 18:16:00,2121,The bed is private but the water is not. That still belongs to the state. https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=103G.005 If the lake is big enough to land a float plane there is nothing you can do about it.
1224614,Obabikon,2010-08-02 21:55:00,2370,"Legality is one thing and etiquette is another. It's perfectly legal to pull up to another boat and fish 2 feet away from him. Nothing wrong with that. But, it's rude.... It's perfectly legal for you to fish this guy's docks, island, and in front of his cabins. But, it's rude.... You have tons of open shore line to fish. Most people want to get away from traffic... and people staying at the place want to look at a peaceful lake... not stare at a boat casting right in front of them. I'm not being critical of you fishing it, I'm just stating that you should consider other people's feelings too. That does not excuse the owner for acting that way. He doesn't have legal rights to do that. But, he could have handled it a little better and just asked you guys to leave them alone. I have had people put their boats BETWEEN my docks and crappie fish. While I had paying guests on the dock doing the same. Sure... it's legal, but is it polite? No."
1225044,81Saluki,2010-08-04 10:45:00,97,"We have a cabin several miles northwest of Vermilion Bay and occasionally have people fishing along our shoreline for muskie and off-shore for walleye. We're remote … the nearest other property is almost a mile away.The legalities of where our property begins/ends at the water doesn't concern us. The main things we DON'T like are [1] people who create big waves when zooming by or pulling in to fish (shoreline erosion issues) and [2] those who swear a lot (we can *clearly* hear people talking from 100 yards off-shore when the cabin windows are open!).While we treasure the peace & quiet of owning our little piece of paradise, we also enjoy engaging conversation with people fishing around our place. We welcome anyone/everyone around our property and have no problem with people tossing their jigs around the dock and boathouse as long as they are courteous, conscientious, and respectful to our property.During our trip last week, we had nice conversations with 4 different boats as they were fishing along our shoreline and we were working in the yard. Yet also had 2 occasions where we heard some very foul-mouthed people on the water … not nice to hear. :-("
1222469,v-bay gord,2010-07-26 12:20:00,3168,"From a landowners perspective I have witnessed behaviour on the water which made me wish I could use a shotgun and get away with it. An example would be relieving yourself over the side of the boat within sight of cabins on the shore, or near someones water line. Granted the ""offending member"" was tiny but the act was stupid. I can also see where someone might enjoy visiting the bass under their dock and might get somewhat upset at having them yanked out and flipped into a live well. I agree with Skywagon, you've travelled hundreds of miles, you can easily avoid the irritation by fishing the majority of shorelines which are uninhabited."
1222472,dutchboy,2010-07-26 12:38:00,5717,"My solution would be this. If you were to buy 40 acres in the woods nobody would be fishing in front of you.Everybody knows the laws, everybody knows people fish around docks. Everybody knows these things before they buy the cabin.Real similar to the guy that buys a hobby farm next to the hog raising operation then is down to the county trying to get them shut down because of the smell.I SEE BOTH SIDES HERE, BUT I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE."
1222473,bob oh,2010-07-26 12:45:00,3936,"I live on the lake in Ohio and have no problem if you want to fish in front of my place. Why anyone who think the fish in front of their home belongs to them baffles me. Thankfully other homeowners don't feel they own the roadway in front of their homes... My rights stop at the water line (there are disagreements about what water line -- low, average, high etc...) I can't stop you from swimming in front of the place as long as you don't set up on the shore. I do get upset with jet skiers getting too close to the bank but not much I can do about that unless they get too close to swimmers and then the sheriff or CG might have something to say to them. There are big battles over water access, the more landowners act like jerks the more chance there is that some court is going to ""rein in"" their rights.I agree with Dutchboy."
1222493,cast_and_blast,2010-07-26 13:48:00,1098,"Well, on well fished lakes (like around the Twin Cities metro in MN) the bass are around and under the docks on sunny, summer days. Look no further than Lake Minnetonka. Many, many multi-million dollar homes on the lake and virtually everyone has huge, fancy dock systems with covers for their cruisers. This lake is pounded every week by tournaments and one of the major patterns is fishing docks. I've done it several times and have never had anyone get ticked - they are well aware that they have their private property parked in public water. Given, I do my best to be courteous and don't bang my tubes off their boat(s), hook their canopy, etc. If they are on or near the dock I'll say ""hi"" but will skip fishing there - I have had folks tell me to try under their dock when I'm talking to them. So - some folks get wound up about it, others don't. If it does bother someone to excess, maybe they should look into ownership on a private lake. There are a few million tax payers in MN - they have the right to full access to public waters. Thankfully, walleye rarely hang out under docks. Scott"
1222553,labsrus,2010-07-26 16:19:00,557,"I guess that I need to clarify what happened. I have been fishing this lake and staying in the cabins since 1976. I fished this weedline in front of the property each and every time I go. I never fished the docks. I was at least 15 yards from the end of any dock that they have in the water. Three years ago the latest owner of the land and cabins turned it into a fractional ownership place. They tore all the old cabins down and replaced them with a few really nice log homes. They also used to have close to 35 campers that were set up along the shore. These campers are all gone now. In the end we have seen less fishing pressure on the lake and the fishing has improved. I agree that I really do not need to be harassed while fishing, I get enough of that at work. It is a large lake and the fish are all over."
1222725,tv4fish,2010-07-27 08:10:00,2694,"Just a FYI: Not ALL waters are public in Minnesota - some smaller lakes are actually privately owned. When the original Federal Government Survey (PLS) was made (way back in the 1800's) - If a lake appeared to be smaller than 50 acres, it was not ""meandered"", and therefor not separated from private ownership. To put it simply - yes - in Minnesota, you can own not only the bed of a lake, but also the water."
1222795,Stu,2010-07-27 11:31:00,472,My family owns a house on the Lake of the Ozarks. Fishermen are always fishing around and under our dock. I welcome them and have never had a cross word w/ anyone. I enjoy sharing tips and an occasional beer w/ them. Sorry to hear about your experience. If that happened to me I would make it a point to fish in front of their cabin every chance I got. But then again...I'm petty and immature
1222807,Mark R,2010-07-27 11:59:00,1538,"I guess it depends upon how much hassel you want to put up with. If fishing is good somewhere where this guy isn't why not go there and save your blood pressure. On the other hand if you want to give the guy a stroke go back to ""his water"" twice a day."
1222843,Blackmacs,2010-07-27 14:14:00,2121,The lake bed may be private but never the water. If a person can get legal acces to any lake in Minnesota they can legally be there. Just don't set foot on the shore or lake bottom in some cases. http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/waters/...nd_answers.pdf
1223902,38bill,2010-07-30 19:46:00,331,"I live within 100 yards of a non-meandered lake that is connected to Clearwater lake. I have no idea why it is non-meandered as you can boat into it from Clearwater lake and it has public road easement reaching it but it is. In Minnesota you can stand in the water to fish or hunt even if it is private property underneath.""A person who has legally gained access to a water body may use its entire surface for recreation, such as boating, swimming, or fishing. Using the underlying bed of the lake or river, if access was gained legally, is called ""incidental use""; the use of the bed or bottom is incidental to the water body's primary use."""
1222418,BGunn,2010-07-26 09:15:00,880,"We were fishing Saratoga Lake (Eastern NY state) once and this LUNATIC started throwing cherry bombs at a friends boat that was closer to shore than ours.He was screaming and yelling at the guys in the boat ""You guys are waking my sick daughter"" (Read the first sentence again about throwing cherry bombs ) .Those guys got sick of the weirdo, and proceeded farther north on the lake.My cousin and I were slowly cruising north also, and about 10 min. later I hear a noise close by. I turn around and here's the nut-case right behind our boat in a pontoon boat. He pulls along side of us and completely looses it .He starts screaming and yelling at us to the point he's red in the face, and spitting as he's talking. I was honestly afraid he was going to pull out a 12 gage shotgun at any second.He says ""I got your boat numbers, and I'm calling ""Sheriff Hillary"" (funny how you remember things like that and forget where you just set your car keys ) and I'll have you arrested, and thrown in jail.There was no talking to the guy, he was nuts (we were never closer than 100 yards from ""His"" water) so I told him ""Do what you have to do"".This was in the days before cell phones, or ""Sheriff Hillary"" would have gotten 2 calls that day.I was never so relieved than when he left us, before the shooting started !!"
