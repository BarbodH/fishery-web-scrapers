1224098,SNOPRO,2010-07-31 18:56:00,108,We fish GullRock in late Aug and use mainly crawlers on Lindy rigs. Jig & minnows work equally as well some days. Give them what they want!!!!!!!!
1224106,Guest,2010-07-31 19:44:00,0,"I agree, crawlers will probably be the best option. Have been going in early to mid September, to many different lakes for over 10 years, and most years crawlers out produce minnows, some years by a lot. That being said I still always bring minnows. Minnows do catch fish but in my experience not as many as crawlers."

We go to an outpost north of Sioux Lookout every year between late August and mid September and use mostly minnows. We always take crawlers and someone will put one on at some point, but all it takes is one person in the whole group to catch one on a minnow before that crawler and the crawler tends to get changed pretty quick. The other thing to keep in mind is that in over 10 years at this lake no one has ever caught a smallie either. We catch all walleyes and northern with about 1 perch in the group each year."

I have fished for 18 years in NW Ontario and use soft plastic almost exclusively (sometimes they really go for a Rat-L-Trap) I use 1/4 ounce orange painted jig heads with a Kalin's Blue pearl salt and pepper 3"" grub. I have had so many 100 plus fish days I can't count them and I never have to worry about keeping bait alive or fresh."
