The check was for $49.00. Is this crazy or what . Was just wondering if anybody else has had this problem. Thanks"

1226008,TIGHTLINER,2010-08-08 14:52:00,223,We were in that same area in the middle of may opening week.. We sent our gst papers in and they say it takes about 8 weeks to get it back and just about to the day it did come back. We were suppose to get back around $77.00 / our figureing / but only got back $63.00. I had no problem cashing it however it took them over 20 min to get the routing numbers right. I am not sure why they are asking for that amount of money to cash the check. Best thing to do and we will do it next year is take the check back to canadathe following year and cash it there and then split up the money.
