1225616,ament,2010-08-06 17:44:00,4,We have been fishing Lac Seul for the last 14 yrs. in the middle of July and have always had great fishing until recently. We spend most of our time in the Bay of Islands. The last three years the walleye fishing has been pretty spotty and the cabbage weed patches have been undeveloped to non-existent. Not sure what the problem is but we are thinking of pushing our annual trip back to the middle of August. Any thoughts?
1225694,wallydave,2010-08-07 06:50:00,2151,"Check with your camp/ldge/resort owner for where the fish are biting. I have fished the Ear Falls area in different conditions, high/ low water, early/ late ice-outs, cool ant hot weather. Andrea has always been able to put us on the fish. Unless you want to try a different section or time of year check around with guys in the fish house or your host. Checking hea is a good start. Good luck!"
1225721,JDP,2010-08-07 09:07:00,1457,"There are plenty of other spots to fish in the vicinity of the Bay of Islands. I would NOT move your week of vacation. Rather, I would recommend trying other spots McKenzie Bay, South Inlet, South Bay, Manitoba Point, Windigo Point and Stony Point to name a few."
1225818,ament,2010-08-07 17:40:00,4,"Yeah, I understand about looking at different places and over the years we've visited MacKenzie and other areas. Our problem is we use a rental boat from the lodge (nice 17ft Lund with a 50hp) but not a big boat for Lac Seul, and I guess we've gotten tired of getting caught with the wind up and having to duck behind an island for half a day or just gutting it out and getting pounded on the way back in. Maybe we're just getting too old. Fishing areas aside, I'm still trying to understand whats happened to the cabbage weed - that's why I thought that going later in the year might help."

We had our best fishing EVER in the 8 years of going to Lac Seul! Found the fish on the reefs or around small islands using jigs or spinners with minnows in 8-20 feet of water. McKenzie reefs and Bay of Islands had a better bite than the Main Basin area for us. Caught 27 1/2"" & 28"" walleye in Bay of Islands! Can't wait to go back again next year........Only had one day of bad wind so stayed close to resort that day and fished northern and caught a 32"", 33"" and 34"" northerns in Scout Bay.....did find some weed beds next to small islands in Bay of Islands......just can't beat Lac Seul......booked the same week next year!
