1224618,Guest,2010-08-02 22:48:00,0,Hello! We are up here at Red Lake and wondering if anyone could give me any pointers as to a few spots to fish on the WEST end of the lake?!? Any help on this lake would be great! Fishing has been really slowww for us and we would like to put some food on our plates! Thanks for any advice or tips!

From what I have read, you should be fishing 20 feet or so of water with a live bait rig. Check with your camp host, and I think you will find fish. Please keep me updated, as I have always wanted to fish up north this time of year."
1224678,AllenW,2010-08-03 07:16:00,11482,"Maybe tell us what your trying?Don't fish Red in Aug, always late Sept, but I'd think any of the points, weed lines with deep water, places where a creek comes into the lake.There's a bay up on the west side if I remember right, that has one and we've picked northers and trout out of it, by running the boats as far up the rapids as possible and as you drift back cast hard baits upstream and reel them back in.Minnows and bright colored jigs, we'd hit them in 30-35fow but I'm thinking they may be shallower now, maybe try deep and zig zag to wards shallow 6-12 fow maybe.We use whatever weight jig it takes to keep contact with the bottom, bounce the jigs off the bottom, dropping it down ever so often to make sure your just off the bottom.You drag most jigs up there and you'll lose a ton of them.Vary you presentation, maybe have each person in the boat use something a little different until you find what works.There are lots of fish in that lake, don't give up.I think if I went again and was you, I'd pick a different month though..imhoAl"
1224921,Guest,2010-08-03 22:36:00,0,I was looking specifically for spots on Red Lake...We are fishing the Classic this fall and would like a few spots of anyone knows of any!?
1225071,Golden Eagle,2010-08-04 12:39:00,2642,Probably best to send hot spots by PM.
1225435,Mondo,2010-08-05 19:56:00,61,Could someone PM me some spots on Red? We haven't really caught much this week with any size so anything would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
1225652,Limeyangler,2010-08-06 20:50:00,563,Like someone else said...livebait rig....try a 1 ounce bottom bouncer with a 6 or seven foot flouro leader and a big...big sucker minnow...large regular minnows also work.Find mid water structure...that tops out at 30-20 feet.....I fished the tourney a couple of years...did not do that well...but we caught our over slots and tons of smaller fish too.
