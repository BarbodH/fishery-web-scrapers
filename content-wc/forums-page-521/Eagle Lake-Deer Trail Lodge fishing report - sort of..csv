Background: Novice bass fisherman, never fished for Walleye, Pike, Musky. Went for a vacation to Canada with the fishing being a ""side line"". Wanted a laid back fishing trip where we could catch some fish and hang out with wife and three 15 year old sons. Left Chicago area Friday and drove to IF to spend the night. Made the crossing on Saturday morning (after a 1 1/2 hour wait in line). Drove up HWY 502 with out a problem (road was great) and arrived at Deer Trail Lodge. Boys were so excited to be there they went fishing as soon as I got the tackle out. Caught 3 pike from the dock in about 10 minutes!The camp was good. The cabin was clean and spacious. I can't say enough about Ruth and Rich. They really help us get settled in. Rich took us out in the morning to so us around the lake and give us some instruction. Caught fish. In the afternoon we had strong thunderstorms so that evening the fishing was tough. For the next 2 nights we had strong thunderstorms with lighting, thunder and hail so that put a damper on the fish. When I went out alone on Monday and didn't catch much Rich took me out again in the morning and help me find some fish and more instruction.In total we caught 80 fish for the week. Walleye were sparse, pike plentiful and even got 3 musky. I was hoping for more volume but I think that has to do with skill. For example I was shown 2 spots that he considered hot. I fished them with NO fish caught. I was speaking to a professional guide the same day about those spots and he must have been following me around. He and his guests managed to pull 25-30 fish out of each of those spots. I think jigging with minnows is harder that I thought.Overall, I would say it was a good trip (beats work). The Deer Trail Lodge was great. Everything worked well with no problems. Cabins were good. Nothing fancy but more than serviceable. As I said Ruth and Rich were fantastic. Would definitely go back. I wish the fishing could have been a little better. We gave up on catching walleye and only fished for pike. We caught most of the fish trolling which is kind of boring. Would have like done a little more casting but the family really like the trolling because it was easy and produced fish. I think the low fish production had to do with skill and does NOT indicate the fishery. Others at the camp were producing fish.I would be very interested in comments. What do you guys think?Ed"
1226230,dave10,2010-08-09 09:36:00,342,"Ed - I think your experience was pretty typical for anyone on their first trip to Canada. I have fished Eagle and Lac Seul with my two sons, and I know that our first year (on Eagle) was a lot like yours. There is more finesse to vertical jigging than you might think, which is what most people do when targeting walleyes on Eagle. The fish move up and go deeper, and sometimes just suspend off the bottom and won't feed, depending on the weather, time of year, water temp, etc. We are certainly not pros, but we've learned a lot over eight years. The frustrating thing is that you hear about all the great fishing in Canada, and then they don't ""jump in the boat"" as you might expect. It is absolutely worth it to hire a guide for a day or two on every trip, so you can learn the patterns and techniques that are working at that time. All I can tell you is to keep trying - we have enjoyed all of our trips, and I really cherish the time with my sons, particularly now that they are moving out and moving on with their lives. Dave"

There has been a pretty good shallow water bite going on in the 10-16 foot range lately. Trolling with #7 or #9 Rapala Tail Dancers have been working well. That being said, you could have missed out if you were off slightly on your depth, speed or lures used......that is where some experience comes in. I have also found that a Lindy rig with a minnow has been outproducing the jigging....not sure why but you need to go with what the fish want. All in all, your trip seemed to be a good experience. I would say that catching 3 muskie on Eagle is an accomplishment you could take some pride in. Best of luck fishing with your family in the future."
