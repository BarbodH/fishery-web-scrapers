1225487,Obabikon,2010-08-06 05:21:00,2370,That's not the average practice on Lake of the Woods.
1225545,2746,2010-08-06 10:47:00,3206,Sort of like not tipping a waitress because she owns the resturant.
1225562,AllenW,2010-08-06 12:21:00,11482,"Lets see...I have to tip to get good service???Tipping has gotten out of hand, a waiter/waitress/whatever many times expects a tip for just doing their job, nope tips are for a job well done. imhoEasy anwser is, take into consideration the job he does guiding and if you think it deseves a little extra, offer him a tip.He doesn't want it, he'll tell you, but if he refuses, buy him a beer or something.Al"
1225665,Stu,2010-08-06 23:10:00,472,Good point Allen. I have seen tip jars at drive-thru windows.
1225704,Obabikon,2010-08-07 07:24:00,2370,"Allen I agree that bad service does not warrant tipping. However, good service does."
1225707,Lazy Fisherman,2010-08-07 07:31:00,276,"Allen, have to agree with you that tipping can get out of hand. At the grocery store I was asked if I would like to tip the person bagging the groceries. Yes, you heard that correctly - I was asked. No, they did not carry them to my car. Only put them in a bag."
1225792,octanehi5,2010-08-07 15:58:00,1104,"If someone has to asks you for a tip,I have a good answer, and it works everytime anytime. You want a good tip ,Get out of this Bussness.I have been in resturants with great service and leave as much as 20% tip, have had bad sevice and left 0. Good service gets good tips"
1226155,AllenW,2010-08-09 06:11:00,11482,"Agreeded, but not in the drive up window or a grocery kid who just puts your groceries in a bag.Like I said, it's gotten out of hand though, everybody seems to have a case of ""gimmie, gimmie""While I tend to tip a bit to much when I do (according to the wife) I tend to tip nothing when deserved, we waited 25 minuites after we got seated before our waitress showed up, and then after she took our order another 30 minuites to get our drinks, not only did I not tip, but we got up and walked out.Tips are earned, not entitlements.Al"
1226163,@Lunker,2010-08-09 06:31:00,835,"Wow, lots of thoughts here. Generally, I don't tip the owner of a business for whatever service is being provided, regardless of the type of service.On the other hand, if you were hiring a guide back home (the owner of his own business), would you tip him for good service? I would. So what's the difference (he asked while scratching his head)? After wondering, I asked the owner of a business (a friend in the food business) if it would have been appropriate to tip the chef / owner of another restaurant who prepared a ""kitchen table"" (off the menu) meal for 6 of us one evening. My friend knew where I was coming from and suggested that ""just something to show your appreciation, like a bottle of wine"" might be appropriate. And like others, the amount I tip is always based on the quality of service, not automatic. However, if I have an issue, I try to take into consideration the source of it. If I'm in a restaurant and the server is friendly and efficient, but the food is slow in coming, I figure that's on the cook / chef, and not the server's fault. So I don't penalize them."
1224795,IaDave,2010-08-03 15:22:00,476,What if the guide is also the camp owner- tip of no tip?
1224799,celticbass1,2010-08-03 15:28:00,67,My vote is for no tip.
1224815,Hawker,2010-08-03 16:18:00,3967,"I guess I'd have to ask why specifically it would make a difference if he was the camp owner or a contracted camp guide?? Is he (the camp owner acting as guide) just taking you out as a new guest to show you areas where you are likely to catch fish, or is he indeed acting as your personal guide for the day? To me, if he is ""YOUR"" guide for the day, helping you to find and catch fish, teaching you etc, then for that day, he has taken off his ""owners"" shirt and replaced it with his ""guide"" shirt and if he did you a good job, deserves a tip just like any other guide providing the same service! But,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, that's just my opinion!"
1224831,octanehi5,2010-08-03 17:18:00,1104,"You did not state if you were hiring him to guide you for a fee, If he has charged you so much a day to take you out then its your call, on how well you felt about the sevice he gave you ,If you catch more fish than you ever have in your life that warrants a good tip. he has shown you some great spots. If he just goes out with you and does not get a fee you should tip him for his time. or invite him to dinner with you. Remember there are no strangers in life just friends that we have not met yet"
1224933,Stu,2010-08-04 00:00:00,472,"As a general rule, you don't need to tip the owner. If your guide is an employee of the lodge, then the fee goes to the camp owner, therefore a tip is proper. If the owner is the guide, then 100% of the fee goes directly into his pocket which covers the fact that he is giving up the work he would normally do at the camp."
1224955,v-bay gord,2010-08-04 06:00:00,3168,".........and I had an uncle who never expected a Christmas present, but he was always happy to get one. Maybe he was even happier to see me the next time I came around?"
1225064,Obabikon,2010-08-04 12:20:00,2370,"I don't know about places you're going to, but most resorts do not make a profit on guides. I'm one of the higher guide rates and I break even when a guide is taken. If you feel a tip is warranted, then tip. Owners appreciate it too, and if you do tip them... they'll typically return the favor with better service. Heck I've been known to take a group a case of beer every now and then. Just because what comes around goes around. There's a belief that lodge owners make a huge profit... which isn't always true. Sometimes they're just trying to make ends meet."
1225069,2746,2010-08-04 12:36:00,3206,"Tipping is something you do when the service is good and you want to show your appreciation. I wouldn't think it would have anything to do with who the guide is.....lodge owner, pro. guide or someone you found on the street corner."
1225073,rangerdug,2010-08-04 12:53:00,4,"When you get good service (not just good fishing), you reward your provider. If he's the owner, tell him you'll be back and sign up for next year. Then tell him/her you're going to brag him up on Walleye Central!!"
1225471,Stu,2010-08-05 23:35:00,472,"Obabikon, I have only used a guide once. He got paid a weekly salary no matter what he was doing. He told me that the lodge owner split the fee w/ him (I think it was $200). I figured the owner took half because he lost the use of an employee for a full day and still had to pay him his salary. Of course we tipped him."
