I hear this was due to high water. Any brothers out there have any reports on weed bed, are the nonexistent like last year or are they going to be easy to find. Leaving 2nd week in September agian."

Water was at a ""normal"" level compared with years past. Northern were plentiful, especially if you weren't interested in them."
