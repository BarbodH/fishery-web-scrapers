1225239,Big Mike,2010-08-04 23:36:00,35,"If I have time next trip I will do some more trolling out there and pay careful attention to my depth finder for any irregularities that exist out there. I will tell you one thing....if located it will be as valuable as the Holy Grail to me in terms of walleye fishing because a spot out there in the middle that hasn't been fished as hard as Devil's, Doe, and Birch would be unbelievable!!! Dave...is my buddy from Oskaloosa coming up Saturday? Hope to see him working the weedbeds with me!"
1225246,Peffley'sCamp,2010-08-05 03:57:00,37,"Mike,Yes, Keith is coming in this week with his wife and will be joined by his son and grandson the following week. Then Keith and his wife will stay one more week after that. When you coming up again?"
1225318,jsmyers,2010-08-05 10:46:00,198,"Is there a rock/navigation hazard just a bit off one of the points across from Big Rock (Big Nose)?I could have swore that I remember seeing some jugs tied there every time I passed by when I was a kid, but this map doesn't show it. It has been about 15 years, am I remembering wrong?Take a look at the image to see where I am talking about."
1225337,Big Mike,2010-08-05 12:00:00,35,"Yes there is a marker buoy on the south point...there isnt a major hazard on the north one as long as you arent riding right close to shore. Dave, I will be up Sat for a week with the wife/kids and then home a week then back Aug 21 with a bunch of guys...Tell Keith I will see him out there!"
1226229,Andy Buff,2010-08-09 09:33:00,10,"JS,My brother in law and I fished from that marker to the south a couple of years a ago and slaughtered em. Caught tons of 16-19"" class fish. No monsters, but it was a fun afternoon.I'll be there in 2 weeks and might try that point again. We've also had luck fishing the point off of Pat's Bay.Can't wait...265 hours, 26 minutes to lift off..."
1225052,jsmyers,2010-08-04 11:26:00,198,"I've got two maps from Ontario of Wabaskang. You can get them both from anglersatlas.com for free.One of them shows over 50' of water in a location that the other shows 9 ""rocks"" which elsewhere on the map appear to be navigation hazards.I've attached two little screenshots of the area of concern. This is in the middle of the NW arm of the big lake, about a mile and a half SW of Peffley's.Can somebody tell me which map has the mistake, or if I am misinterpreting the legend."
1225055,Big Mike,2010-08-04 11:40:00,35,I have hunted for that reef for many years and have not located it. I have trolled for hours out there for suspended walleyes in the summer just thinking I might get lucky enough to find something different about the bottom but unsuccessful. The bottom stays pretty much a flat 40 feet with nothing special to hold fish. I think its an error on the map but I could be wrong...I have never seen anyone fishing out there either its kind of no man's land with little to no structure. Mike
1225058,jsmyers,2010-08-04 11:46:00,198,"On the land topo map, the plus sign ""+"" refers to a ""rock/roche"" according to the legend.I assume that meant an underwater or slightly protruding rock that presents a navigation hazard. Is this your understanding too?Many of the other +'s that I see on the map are places I remember seeing milk jugs tied to over the years.While I haven't done much fishing in the ""big lake,"" I know I went by there at least once (one year we hiked to Wine Lake from the back of that arm), but I don't remember the area at all."
1225067,jsmyers,2010-08-04 12:29:00,198,I now see my typo in the thread title. I don't think I can change it. Maybe a moderator can?
1225100,hound dog,2010-08-04 15:07:00,4,"The thumb nails are very difficult to read on my computer. If read correctly the light thumbnail is on the main lake (fish the northeast shore back to mud lake) excellent fishing rocks and weed lines. The navigation mark is deep and flat. I've never seen a rock. The dark thumb nail appears to be the southwest section of Mean lake??? Check your maps and see if the area north of what's shown includes a portage, river and entrance to Wine Lake. The reef is hard to find but does hold fish.Good luck!"
1225101,hound dog,2010-08-04 15:10:00,4,Switch the comments around. The light area is Mean and the Dark the northwest arm of the mainlake.
1225114,Peffley'sCamp,2010-08-04 15:43:00,37,"Like Big Mike, I have never found this ""reef"" if it does exist on the big lake, but even if it does it certainly is not a navigation hazard. Off smaller islands and points there are a couple of hazards in play in low water, but there are no navigational hazards anywhere in the middle of the big lake."

Just open your response, and when the window comes up there should be a button on the bottom right that says, ""Edit"". Just click on that and go from there...it's pretty self explanatory.I'm not seeing a typo in your previous post's title though? Other than you forgot the question mark, but that's no big deal, and everyone knows what you meant. We all make typos, and don't expect anyone to be perfect here. Don't worry about grammar police here...we delete pesky-nit-picky posts that point out typos and grammar mistakes. Juls"
1225122,jsmyers,2010-08-04 16:07:00,198,"I know how to edit a post. The title of the thread starts with the word I invented:""strang""I didn't see how to edit the title of it.Seems to be some kind of error in the MNR topo map. Both Dave and Mike know the lake as well as anybody. I wonder how such a serious error got missed?For hound dog, I'll try to upload a better image later. The pictures show the NW arm of the big lake. One of them has north a bit off center from straight up. Neither show Mean lake, but the one without the contours does show a tiny bit of the corner of Mean Lake."
1225165,jsmyers,2010-08-04 18:39:00,198,"Though I think the original question has been answered, This picture should more clearly describe what we're discussing.I've circled the phantom ""rocks"" near the middle of the image.Click on the thumbnail below to open a larger picture."
