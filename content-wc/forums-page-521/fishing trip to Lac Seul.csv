1225014,Skiuseme,2010-08-04 08:47:00,5,"I fished with Andersons the week of the 19. Had a great time. We fished the northern eastern end of the lake quiet a bit for walleye's Did well off of Walski's Island and 10-10. As for Privacy, yes, we saw other boats while fishing but, they were not on top of us like here on the Mississippi. The most we saw at anyone time was 4 boats and they were spread out over a 2 mile radius from our boat. This was not a daily thing either. there was a day that we only saw 1 boat while driving to our spot. This is a very large lake and has a few areas that are pretty open that you can see boats but, they can be over a 1/2 mile away from you. I guess it depends on your idea of privacy. If you want to see no other boats in a week, your not going to find that on Lac Seul or any other lake that a major outfitter is set on. Your going to have a great time. Jody, Jackie, and Dick run a first class operation. Their hospitality is great and their equipment is great. PM me if you want me to go any further."
1225019,fishingMN4eyes,2010-08-04 09:01:00,109,"Yeah, I understand the whole privacy deal. You don't wanna go up there and be surrounded by boats, but it isn't an overwhelming issue up there. Yeah, you are going to see other boats, but it isn't like they will be on top of you or anything. There is so much fishable water up there it isn't even funny."
1225372,fishingMN4eyes,2010-08-05 14:15:00,109,Just bumping the thread. We leave on Monday and I am hoping to get some more reports before we go
1223112,tight line,2010-07-28 11:37:00,37,I am in the process of planning a fly-in fishing trip to Canada.We are interested catching walleye and pike.I am considering Anderson's outpost camps on Lac Seul.Would the last week in May or the first week in June be a good time of the year to go? I am looking for a relaxing trip with some privacy. Any information on the quality of the fishing and the numbers of other anglers in the area would be appreciated.
1223133,IaDave,2010-07-28 13:07:00,476,I looked into them a few years back- Never did go but some of the reponses I got is that the fishing is great but not the privacy you except on a fly-in. They mentioned houseboats around and quite a few other boats either private or from the camp up there. Hopefully someone will respond that has been there.
1223186,Guest,2010-07-28 16:19:00,0,I was at this camp in early June. 800+ walleye in 4 days with 4 guys. The Anderson flyin camps are within a few miles. I'd recommend this place.
1224286,BenBeattie,2010-08-01 19:13:00,232,"Late May and early June offer some of the years best walleye fishing on the east end of Lac Seul. Pack for both cold and warm weather, you never know what you're going to get up here at that time of year."
1224376,orchard frank,2010-08-02 07:38:00,1900,"Agree that the time period can offer great fishing, but can also be some miserable conditions. Snow, sleet, some cold rain and wind can put a real damper on the trip. Can't predict the weather, maybe I was just unlucky, but both of the early trips I took to LS were pretty rough. Ended up doing a lot of trolling because of the wind/rain/sleet on many days. I had great fishing no matter what month I went there. August ended up our favorite. Have a good one."
1224382,tight line,2010-08-02 07:59:00,37,Thanks for the information fellas.I did look into Lac Seul Outfitters but we are considering Anderson's for the privicy.From what I understand a jig and minnow is the bait of choice but will it be possible to catch walleyes trolling or casting crankbaits at this time of the year?
1224649,Iowa Hawkeye,2010-08-03 05:42:00,90,"I believe Andersons fly you into areas that you can boat in also, so not real private, but great fishing"
1224707,davenathe,2010-08-03 08:47:00,113,"if going to lac seul, plenty of good drive in locations, why spend the money. We go to Mahkwa which is drive in a see maybe 3-4 boats on a daily basis, no fishing pressure and catching 50+ eyes a day is easy if any good at fishing."
1224709,fishingMN4eyes,2010-08-03 09:00:00,109,"Are you talking about Lac Seul ""Outposts""(you said outfitters, just checking) out of Chamberlain Narrows? If so, that's where we have been going for a number of years now. You can catch walleye trolling depending on where you go. We have only had luck in certain spots though.We are heading up to Chamberlain Narrows from 8/10-8/14. Any info out of that area of the lake? Thanks in advance!"
1224887,Guest,2010-08-03 20:05:00,0,"I fished LS with Anderson's this past weekend and we did well on the North Shore (as we call it) just south of the first Anderson's outpost as you head north. The guided Anderson's lodge boats are not supposed to go north of there into the area of the outposts. You can't keep the houseboats and other camps from going north but they generally fish south of the outposts as it is long way to travel up there and there is plenty of good fishing to the south of there. As for the walleye bite with cranks and trolling, I would be sceptical as the fish seemed to be in deeper water on humps and points where vertical jigging was the more efficient way to target the schools. The bite was very light with short biters in some spots so finesse presentations were much better but that may have been the day in question. For me, the cast and hop technique that works so well in May/June was not working at all whereas dead sticking was more successful."
