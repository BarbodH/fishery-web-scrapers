1224768,thordoggydog,2010-08-03 14:11:00,51,I ordered a suction cup and extra high speed transducer for my 332c. I should be able to get a full day out of it and I have the ability to charge it every night plus I will bring a spare battery.
1224781,adempsey,2010-08-03 14:36:00,963,"Don't forget the Vaseline for the suction cup. Not sure if there is something better, but that helped me until I switched to a portable clamp. Personally, I go with the 1""x2"" and C-clamp instead."
1224790,Guest,2010-08-03 15:01:00,0,I use a Fish Easy 2 with 8 D batteries. I fished 9 days on one set of batteries. The suction cup works fine but it does have a string to tie it off so it won't get in the prop if it comes off.
1224856,SinOrSwim,2010-08-03 18:30:00,1528,"I have a humminbird 595c which is combo sonar and gps. I love it except I have a horrible time with battery life. Ihad an old ""wide one"" humminbird that had the hard case and used 2 x 6v lantern batteries. I installed the new unit in that case and would literally turn it off after fishing an area for awhile to save battery life. I am switching it over to the softside portable case this year with the gel cell 12 volt battery to see if I can get more usage out of it. I also have a small solar trickle charger I plan on trying as well. Overall it's still heavier than I'm sure our outfitter would like but I have to say having the GPS up there is really really nice. From making sure I'm back at an exact spot to navigating between some sunken rock piles outside our cabin are worth the pain of the battery issue."
1224963,schandm,2010-08-04 06:15:00,18,"I use an Eagle 320 and the batteries last from 5 to 7 days, depending on the hours on the water. I made my transducer mount from a piece of 1/2"" conduit and an aluminum clamp from Tite Loc. Just drilled holes in conduit and mounted transducer , then attached conduit to clamp with a coated wire clamp which allows adjustment for different transom heights. Stays on boat at all speeds and allows high speed running use of fishfinder."
1225266,Bitinlight,2010-08-05 06:40:00,95,Pacman--Does your Fish Easy 2 show good fish detail? I heard you catch alot of nice fish with this unit.
1225295,stevensinks,2010-08-05 08:08:00,330,I have a Fisheasy that I got new on sale for $40. It takes 8 D's and I have used it every day on a 2 week trip on one set.
1224186,adempsey,2010-08-01 09:35:00,963,"I purchased a Humminbird 565 portable a couple seasons ago. Overall, I'd say it was an ok unit. It's the only portable I have used with the exception of my flasher for ice fishing. However, I have had battery/power problems since the beginning that I have not been able to completely resolve. It bothers me even more that people report there sonar operating for a week without charging. I am lucky if I can run mine for 12 hours without getting low power warnings. I don't think I'd recommend this for a fly-in. I'd probably purchase something else."
1224231,Crede,2010-08-01 14:54:00,134,My brother has a 565 purchased thru Cabelas as a portable system with the Cabelas battery. It has been on 2 weeklong fly ins. The battery lasted the entire week each time. Used approx. 4-5 hours per day.
1224241,octanehi5,2010-08-01 15:42:00,1104,"If you use the d-s or dbl.aa s they will not make it at 8hrs a day for 7 days,not enough amps ,I made my our portable before they came out,I took a eagle cuda 168 got the suction cup transducer, small motor cycle batt. (acid based) charged at home , not many places have 12 volt charging sys. in the great north. I have never run out of juice up north, and we are fishing finadicks,only stopping to eat and rest, I say we fish 8-12 hrs a day using the depthfinder,even the dry 12 volts batts from cabelas or elswere will not hold up to that kind of use,5hrs a day maybe. The lead batts are heavy but worth there weight in gold up there, and they last about 4yrs at $40-$50 a pop,You could spend that much in a week on reg batts. I guess thats my 3 cents worth anyway good fishing"
1224384,Guest,2010-08-02 08:02:00,0,"I have used the Eagle Fish-Easy for many years. It uses 8 D-cell batteries. We fish 8 full days, and fresh alkaline batteries usually last all week, and well into the fall fishing season here at home. I always take a spare set, but have never needed to change unless someone leaves it on all night. I know they're not supposed to last that long, but they do for us."
1224487,Guest,2010-08-02 13:52:00,0,"I have the Eagle Fishmark 320, This also provides water temp. I have had it bout 7 years and it seems to work good. Batteries have always lasted all week, one year we forgot it on all night and they still lasted all week"
1224564,polaris-pete,2010-08-02 18:51:00,343,"Before going to our trip to Pasha Lake I posted this exact same question. Lots of different answers. I researched them and bought a Humminbird PiranahaMax 150. It worked superbly up on our trip. It came in a hefty ballistic nylon carrying bag and a 7 amp battery and charger. It showed everything in detail and lasted 3 days from dawn to dark on a single charge. It got banged around in the boat, rained on, and never missed a beat. It cost me $119/ with free shipping on Ebay Brand New.I just got an ice tranducer for it for the ice fishing season. Eagles are good to, but like buying anything, everyone has their favorite. I also have a Humminbird Matrix 17 on my boat and its had alot of use and after 6 years has never given me any trouble at all. Good luck on your choice and have a good trip."
1224574,bryhardt,2010-08-02 19:28:00,11,"Good to hear you had success with the 150. I picked up the 160 portable for the trip in less than two weeks. It's my first depth finder, so looking forward to trying it out. I think I will take the advice of an earlier post about using a board and c-clamp to mount it rather than rely on the suction cup."
1224578,nlar,2010-08-02 19:46:00,3,"Cuda 350s, just got back from Canada two weeks ago and this is worth every penny. I finally charged it after four days while I was there, don't know if it needed it or not. The GPS worked awesome as did the depth finder. I would get the 12 volt ice fishing type battery VS. the AA type as you will save a bunch on the cost of the batteries. The suction cup holds well, I had it on the boat for six days, including rapids, wide open and strong current and it never came off, I would buy another in a heartbeat!"
1224610,polaris-pete,2010-08-02 21:45:00,343,"The suction cup was used on 4 different aluminum boats, some with paint and some bare.The cup stayed firm wherever you placed it. It never moved on any of the boats and to be honest, it was pretty hard to removed from the boat after fishing each day. We fished different lakes each day in different boats and like I said earlier this is a great unit for the money.Myself after using mine for 7 days, would not worry about the cup coming loose but before you go try it on a couple different boats to be sure."
1224732,octanehi5,2010-08-03 11:25:00,1104,"I have used the suction cups for yrs , yes they can come off but you need to tie the transducer to the boat just in case it does,so you do not cut it off with the motor,the board mounted way will work also. Good Luck fishing"
1223851,thordoggydog,2010-07-30 15:57:00,51,I am headed to uchi lake lodge on a fly in late august. What do you use for a depthfinder at the fly in lakes with camp boats? I have a lowrance 332c rigged for ice fishing. Thinking of using it with some sort of clamp on bracket for the transducer...
1223874,fourize,2010-07-30 17:52:00,287,"Here's the unit I use when I go to Canada. The only change I make is eliminating the suction cup...boats are steel and it will not stick to the paint...and attatch the transducer to a 1""x2"" wooden slat w/bolt and nut, cut the slat to length and attatch it with a c-clamp.http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...356&hasJS=true"
1223899,djarz929,2010-07-30 19:39:00,40,I have been looking at that Cuda 300 for fly-ins. My old Humminbird Piranha bit the dust. How long is the run time on a charge? Most times we don't have the pleasure of electricity to recharge.
1223986,Hawkfan,2010-07-31 07:25:00,237,"I bought an Eagle Fishmark 320 portable unit and took on our flyin last year. It worked great and had no problem with the suction cup transducer on the aluminum boat. It runs on D cell batteries and I don't think I changed them the whole 5 days we were there. Granted we weren't out from sun up to sun down, but battery life was good. This year's trip kicks off 3 weeks from today!"
1223990,octanehi5,2010-07-31 07:46:00,1104,"I have been useing a eagle cuda 168 for 8yrs, I made my own box for it bought a motorcycle battery (acid),and have the suction cup transducer, need to tye the transducer to the boat so if it comes off you will not cut it with the prop, bin there done that The battery will last a good 4 yrs they are around $40-50,We use it everyday and all day, the d- cell batts will not last a week. It is one of the first thing we load into the float plane, I also have the cuda 300, with takes the same plug in transducer as the 128, 168,300, if you want to buy one go on ebay they have them all the time, and parts for them are still avalable. so if you buy one and it has the regular transducer you can buy just the suction cup for it. very good bang for your buck"
1224023,Crede,2010-07-31 10:01:00,134,I also have the Cabelas Eagle Cuda 300 Portable. Have not had a problem with the suction cup sticking to an aluminum boat. The Cabelas battery that comes with the package has lasted for the full week each time. We don't always have the depthfinder on - probably an average of 4 to 5 hours per day. With the battery weighs between 8 and 9 lbs.
1224046,dosxx,2010-07-31 11:54:00,60,"We have used an Eagle ""Fish Easy"" portable that runs off 8 D batteries. Good fresh batteries last us all week unless we forget to turn it off a night, and it is often on up to 8 hours a day. I also have a Hummibird portable that runs off 8 AA-- it is a back up so I can't vouch for how long it lasts."
1224050,jaym,2010-07-31 12:22:00,89,"I use the Eagle Cuda 300 as well. Mine uses 8 AA batteries, 2 sometimes 3 sets will get me thru the week. It's a great basic unit."
1224118,Glenman12,2010-07-31 21:20:00,762,We use the Fishmark 320 and have been for at least the last 5 years or so...our unit takes one 12V battery..we bought a back up but have never had to use it yet..so we rotate them from year to year..this was the first year though that the suction cup transducer was perfectly placed and the reading didnt flash at high speeds....we now that that there is a spot in Cedar Lake that is 51ft deep
1224169,nitrodude,2010-08-01 07:48:00,60,"I take an old Lowrance X-85 left over from a boat sale years back. That and the portable kit with 8 ""D""-cell batteries each year runs all week. I also take a portable transom transducer mount with the TD puck and temp probe mounted on it. It all fits in the luggage and travels fine, keeping us off the rocks and on the fish for about 10 yrs. now. (I used a cheap Humminbird Wide Eye prior.) I also carry a handheld Lowrance H2Oc GPS with the Canada - Lake of the Woods premium Navionics chip (2008) for our navigation needs. For years before that, I used a Global Map 100 GPS and always made it back to camp."
