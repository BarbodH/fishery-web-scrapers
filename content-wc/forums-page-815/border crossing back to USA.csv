I know that is always on the list of things to have with you, but we've been going since 1987 and have never been asked for anything, even a driver's license, when headed in either direction. Anyone have any current info or experience on returning to the U.S.? Are they stickier than they've been in the past?"

A 60 year old white haired, balding man pulling a boat doesn't fit the profile they are looking for. But, I'm still taking my passport along."

Usually it goes smoothly, but almost every time I have had a ""Barney Fife"" -type customs agent, it was on the U.S. side when coming back into the states."
539457,Western Walleye Editor,2004-05-12 08:42:00,465,When we came back a couple of months ago they asked for proof of citizenship. A DL does not meet that test. I had my passport and the kids birth certificates but my wife had neither. The lady let it go but said in the near future they MAY require proof of citizenship. This was at the Sweatgrass crossing into Montana. Honsie

I recall a thread where a child may need a state identification card with photo as well as a certifed copy of birth certificate. If you are traveling with children and both parents are not on the trip, you should have written authorization for the child to travel with you. You might also consider written authorization for seeking needed health care on the child's behalf."

539594,Guest,2004-05-17 11:20:00,0,You may want to have the letter from your spouse to take your children stamped by a notary public. It may make things go smoother.
539604,Western Walleye Editor,2004-05-17 15:30:00,465,Ha... Thanks T-Mac... Now I know and I will cross at Scobey! haha. Maybe it was some woman thing since my wife couldn't see me winking at her?!?!

When coming back into the states they have 1 guy in the booth on the computer and 2 guys outside, 1 ask questions the other look in the truck giving it a fast go over. Guess this is standard procedure for this year. Other than that went fast but going into Canada one of our trucks got the pull over and almost were not let in cause they did not have birth cert. but then they let them in and told them next time to have them with them."
