He is attempting to establish a new Lac Seul Record for ""Big Walleye"". This would add one more record to the many he holds. If you see him on the lake he will be happy to sign autographs or you can have your picture taken with him."

539943,Guest,2004-05-25 20:48:00,0,I have heard of this Barney. He is supposed to be the second best fisherman on Lac Seul that week. There is a Grand Master in his party that Barney is very envious of but Barneys talent is far short of the Grand Master.
