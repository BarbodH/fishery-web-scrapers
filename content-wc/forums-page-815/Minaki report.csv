539816,Guest,2004-05-22 06:43:00,0,"Just got back from the walleye opener last night. Fished the Winnipeg above the Whitedog Dam at KCR. They received 14 inches of snow on Wednesday and when we pulled in Saturday everything was still white. Didn't effect the walleye bite though. About half the males were still milking, all the females we caught were spawned out. Caught a fat 28 1/2 incher (CPR) on Thursday morning. High pressure follwed the storm Thursday night and the eyes really shut down. Big northerns are still hanging out near spawning areas. If your searching for big gators, the big Husky Jerks kicked but last week. I saw nine fish between 35-42 inches in a shallow bay in about 7 hours of fishing. Caught a bunch of hammer handles and also a nice 37 1/2 on Friday (CPR). Walleyes were really scattered and we caught them from depths of 5 to 52 feet. Fishing rocks and boulders mostly. Lots of eaters in the current, seems the big females are adjacent to well known areas, shallower and out of the current from traditional spots. Good luck!"

539819,Guest,2004-05-22 10:07:00,0,"Main lake temps were in the 40's. Anywhere from 43-48 degrees, depending on depth over the main basin and lake size. Found some 8 foot mucky bays that were up to 56-58 degrees. Female eyes that we caught were spawned out, some males milking. Perch were loaded with eggs. Fish would bite, but fights were poor with the water so cold."

539721,Guest,2004-05-20 06:24:00,0,"We will be heading up to Minaki end of next week and I am looking for any updates. Water temp, water level, walleye location. Any help would be appreciated. We will be staying at Paradise Cove. I cannot wait I love this place thanks again"
539748,Guest,2004-05-20 15:05:00,0,"Got a call from my dad this afternoon, he opened our camp up last week. He said the fishing was slow at best right now. I wouldn't put a whole lot of faith in that report as I doubt he has really been trying to hard to catch fish. He did say the 14 inches of snow they got last Tuesday was a pain in the ####."
539760,Reels,2004-05-20 16:46:00,2876,"Aaron, Did he mention the water levels? <{{}}><"
539762,KSauers,2004-05-20 17:13:00,385,"What camp do you own,if you don't mind my asking?"
539764,Le pickerel,2004-05-20 19:27:00,18,"Water levels are low, much the same as they were last year. That was last week before the snow had completely gone away. May by a few inches higher this weekend. Can't say about the current though. Le pic"
539769,Burr,2004-05-20 20:34:00,8612,"Unfortunately I did not get invited along to Minaki for last weekends customer fishing trip to Minaki. But report from my boss was they were catching pre-spawn walleyes. They also stayed at Paradise Cove. Many 21-24 inchers, largest was 26, all fishing was done within a mile or two of Paradise Cove. Under the Bridge, and toward the ####. Catch rates were 40-60 per boat per day. The bite was very good. And yes, 14 inches of snow. Pretty much all melted last Saturday when they were fishing though."
539790,Guest,2004-05-21 07:25:00,0,Reels.....he said the water level was maybe a foot higher than last spring and rising just a little every day. I guess that means it's still low. I hear they are letting some more flow from LOTW so maybe it will come up some more.
539791,Guest,2004-05-21 07:26:00,0,ksaurs.............we own a couple cabins on Harbor Island...not a commercial fishing camp.
