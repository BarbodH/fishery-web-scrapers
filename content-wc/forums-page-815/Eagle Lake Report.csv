We fished mainly Osborn and Wilson Bays... and caght fish anywhere from 4-20 feet but really couldn't find a consistent number of good sized keepers at any single location. We bounced from point to point and would get one here and there. Caught roughly 2-3 Walleyes/ person/ hour. Mostly slot fish or 12-14"". We also had a lot of 8-10"" walleyes sucking on the tails of the minnows which should bode well for the next few years. We are speculating the 14-18"" year class was not that good for Eagle Lake??? The highlights of the trip: caught 42"" and 36"" muskies on jig/ minnow with 6 pound test. It is amazing how thick they were across the back. Take care all!"

Sounds like you were on the main (east) part of the lake. I'm heading up to the west arm next week. I was there two years ago, and about all we did was backtrolling with jigs, or lindy rigs with minnows. We did OK with walleye and northerns, but I want to try casting and some artificials this year. I'm bringing up a lot of the new Berkley Gulp to try out."

For the walleyes, I typically use jigs & minnows because that is the type of fishing I enjoy the most. If I need to cover more water, the bottom does not have a lot of snags and jigs aren't producing, then I go to spinners and minnows/ leeches. For me, mult-colored jigs have always seemed to produce better than solid colors. Green/chart., Green/orange, etc.. Also jigs with eyes painted have seemed to produce better. Good luck, hopefully the fronts will stop moving through and the conditions will stabilize for you."

LOT of walleye in the slot and just above this year. Clearwater yielded us lake trout as well as Eagle lake our big one being 16 pounds. Jigs work the best for us with spinners coming in 2nd and then jerk baits, water being cold the jerk baits not working as good early. Good luck on your trip got a couple of whitefish again this year, biggest northern was 32""."
