539860,Guest,2004-05-23 22:20:00,0,"The Lake trout will be in fairly shallow water still(20-40), water temps are still very low.Smallies will be still pre spawn so shallow rock piles or shorelines.The back part of Snake bay should have some fish going their(shallower water).Good Luck.

539879,skrut,2004-05-24 13:43:00,52,Go to www.justfishontario.com and click on fishing reports. Scroll down to Whitefish Bay camp. Bob and Peg have a fishing report out there and you can also contact them directly.
