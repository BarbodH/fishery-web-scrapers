539940,AL,2004-05-25 18:10:00,89,"Just returned from our annual opening week fly in trip and wanted to post the results. We went to The Ogoki Reservoir this year out of Armstrong. We flew in Friday the 14th and fished through Sunday the 23rd. The weather was hit and miss. We had sunny days, rainy days and snowy days. Generally in the 40's to 50's during the day and below freezing at night. The reservoir was still 50% ice when we arrived although the main river systems that hold a majority of the fish this time of year were open. The first 4 days the Walleye's were on. We caught them at will on just about everything we threw in the water. We were 90% jig fishing with plastic bodies ranging from 3"" to 5"". As usual the orange, white and yellows produced. Once again this year the top tail was the ""Captain America"" power grub by Berkley. It is a blue/ red body with a white tail. The Techno-Glow grubs from Lindy's were extremely hot until we ran out. Used 1/4 ounce and 3/8 ounce jigs. The second half of our week the fishing slowed down dramatically. The Walleye's hit mostly during the morning and evening hours. The mid-day fishing, which earllier in the week was hot, dropped of drastically. The biggest Walleye of the week was 7.5lbs with several 5lb-6lb fish caught. Nothing huge but none the less fun. Pike fishing was so-so. I saw something I have only read about in the past. We saw HUGE female pike in the shallows weeds with 5 or so males following around her mocking every move. It is impossible to guess the size of these females but they were by far bigger than I've ever caught. My first sighting I thought was a small Sturgeon. Pretty cool to witness. The Pike hit mostly top water with an occasional jig hit. The largest of the week was 39"" (small compared to other posts I've seen). We saw atotal of 6 bears, 1 inland Carabou and no Moose this year. We did see a bay full of Sand Cranes which was a first."
