We plan to shop at the new Safeway in Dryden, anyway, for potatoes, might as well pick up onions, too. Just curious. Anybody know the real scoop? Thanks. Heading up June 3rd from Wis. We usually have pretty smooth border crossings about 9AM Fridays."

539926,Trailerguy,2004-05-25 13:43:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]I went through at Fort Francis on the 19th and was asked about both potatoes and onions. So I guess it just luck of the draw.
