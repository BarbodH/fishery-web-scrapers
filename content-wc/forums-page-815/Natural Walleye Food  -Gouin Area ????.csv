We have fished many years at Lake Stramond, off Clova Road in Quebec. This lake is very near a larger lake, O'Sullivan. We catch many ""eyes"", and in all cases of those that we keep, the stomachs appear to be empty. Thus, my question on what they naturally feed upon. I assume small fish and minnows comprise a large part of their diet. To my knowledge, crayfish are non existant in this area. What have others found to be the main stay of eyes in this area? Are leeches naturally occurring? I typically fish in early June and have not seen leeches. Also, any information on Stramond and O'Sullivan would be appreciated. Any and all information and experiences are appreciated. Great site, keep up the good work."

I fished O'Sullivan for a few years and it is a great lake.I stopped going because I/we just hated the former owner Ted Barkwill> I have no Idea about the current owner but the lake was great for walleye and pike(I never fished for the lake trout but witnessed some big ones caught,over 20 lbs).I have been fishing a lake up clova road past O'Sullivan for 14 years now and love it(Huge Walleye,between 4 of us we have boated 30 Walleye over 10 pounds one of which was 14lbs and one over 15 yes 15 lbs).I have never fished the Gouin because I will not fish a lake that has houseboats and Indians Gill netting it.I have talked with people who have fished it and they all said the same thing ""We caught Walleye, but they are all small"".If you would like you can e-mail me and I will tell you about the lake I fish or about my experiences at O'Sullivan.

Contrary to your comment winkdink, the Gouin has a very respectable reputation for BIGGER fish - both Pike & Walleye. The reservoir is an absolute fish factory and for sure there are large schools of year class fish that will give the appearance of smaller in size catches. Then again 100+ fish days of 18 - 20"" fish are quite common. The truth is that fisherman who get away from shoreline and sand bar fishing will discover huge walleye suspended off of mid-lake shoals. I really don't understand your aversion to houseboats plying a reservoir of over 3100 sq. km. If there are 30 houseboats in total on the Gouin that would be it, in fact they are a great way to spend a vacation week, allowing the exploration of many different bays. As a point of interest the locals do run gill nets for personal consumption and are very tuned in to the value of the fishery. They do not place their nets in popular fishing areas and they certainly don't detract from the fish population. In my 20 years of fishing the Gouin extensively I have yet to come across a net while fishing."

Echouani is 15 miles long and about 4 miles wide at some points. The Owner has exclusive rights to the lake and about 20 portage lakes.We spend days seeing one or two boats, some days we see none at all. As far as my aversion to houseboats, when someone takes a dump where does the human fecal matter go? Right into the drink.I have caught literally over 100 8 lb.walleyes,at least a dozen over 10 lbs. My dad got one over 14 lbs and my brother got one better than 15 pounds.We hardly ever catch Walleye under 2 lbs. Sincerely, vince W. in New Jersey"
