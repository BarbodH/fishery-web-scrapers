539694,Guest,2004-05-19 13:47:00,0,"Hey...honest. It is no problem. I am working on getting a new ""handle"". Don't worry about. I have to figure out some name that I can register and I am having a few set backs doing that. I really need to fix this anyway. No offense here."
539695,Walleyefisher,2004-05-19 13:48:00,159,"I'm just glad I was here to help name ""T-Mac Wannabe"". Too funny. I think we should look at some other alternatives, I have a couple other suggestions. Let see if we can come up with a collaborative effort to assist our fellow angler. Alt. T-MacD T-Mac Part Deux Imitation T-Mac T-Mac jr"
539696,Guest,2004-05-19 13:49:00,0,"Sounds good T-Mac, I'll always be T-Mac Wannabe - sounds good. Take care. Let's talk fishing!"
539699,Guest,2004-05-19 14:12:00,0,"Walleyefisher, Thanks for the monicker! Works for me. You mentioned you would be on Lac Seul May 28th? I will be there June 28th. I believe June 28th was when Canadian Club will be there too. We should change this subject to LacSeul report... Anyway, the report that I got off the Evergreen lodge site for Lac Seul is:http://www.justfishontario.com/disc26_toc.htm I will give you all a report from Eagle Lake(and maybe Lac Seul if I can convince the in-laws to travel...) next week when I return."
539701,Guest,2004-05-19 14:12:00,0,"After knowing T-Mac Wannabe for over 10 years now, I have several alternative 'new' names for him, but cannot post here because the board moderators would certainly shut this link down. It's the first week of fishing in Canada and all we can talk about on this forum is how 'hurt' some of the users are because their 'friend's name' is now being used by someone else who simply asked for a fishing report at Eagle? I think you guys all should get back to work."
539707,Walleyefisher,2004-05-19 15:29:00,159,"Hurt? Seriously? Nah. I have to admit that if you don't want people to post with your ""monicker"", you might want to pick one that can be registered."
539744,Guest,2004-05-20 13:40:00,0,"I agree. I did, now. :) I should have years ago. First, I had to get an acceptable e-mail address. WC doesn't like hotmail addresses. Done."
539855,fishmaster,2004-05-23 17:19:00,209,"Well here is a fishing report for Eagle lake since that being the question being asked. Was up for the opener and the weather was not the best. Water temps started out the week at 42 and we finished on Friday with temps at 48 in the main lake and as high as 52 in some bays. Fishing was good but not as good as years past due to cold weather and cold water temps. Walleye were plenty in the slot size again this year biggest Lake trout from Eagle for us was 16 pounds this year, northern fishing was up and down due to cold fronts and cold weather and water. biggest northern was 32 inches. biggest walleye 24"" perch fishing was slowest ever for us again cause of cold water, fish were not in the shallows in big numbers yet. another week or so maybe the weather will warm up helping the fishing. seeing other reports on fishing in Canada is the same, slow due to cold water and cold weather. Water levels were good no problem getting around like last year. Also when crossing the border one of our trucks almost did not get across when they did not have birth cert. with them but then they let them through and told them next time you might want to have them. Other than that coming back into states 1 guy at the booth on computer and 2 guys outside 1 ask questions while other looks fast through the truck, standard procedure this year. Good luck to all whoare headed up."
539674,Walleyefisher,2004-05-19 09:26:00,159,T-Mac wanna be. The original T-Mac has been posting on here for years. Cut the guy a break and change your nick.
539676,Guest,2004-05-19 09:32:00,0,"Simply trying to avoid confusion. It isn't anything other than that. I get asked quite a few questions on the boards and try to answer them as best I can. Hopefully you can. :) I always figured if anybody wanted to mess with the name I was using, it would be really easy. Oh well...it was entertaining for me for many years. :)"
539679,2746,2004-05-19 11:00:00,3206,"T-Mac wanna be (don't know what else to call you) If you frequent walleye central you already know the number of posts made by T-Mac, nearly all of which are answeres to questions the rest of us have about boats, motors etc. He is as useful a member of Walley Central as we have and it would be a shame to do anything to harm that. It would be a greater loss to many of us who use walleye Central Than it will to T-Mac. Is there some way you could help us all out by adjusting or changing your handle, at least when posting here? I know many of us would really appreciate it! Thanks for at least considering it."
539680,Guest,2004-05-19 11:07:00,0,We will be fishing Lac Seul on the 28th also. What area of the lake do you fish? Have you heard any reports from opening weekend??
539681,Walleyefisher,2004-05-19 11:37:00,159,I too will be on Lac Seul on May 28th. We should have a Walleyecentral get together.
539683,Guest,2004-05-19 11:55:00,0,"It just isn't that important for me but if it means that much to you, I will try to remember in the future... you do realize the internet is a very broad technology and that T-Mac is used by many people in many forums, do we need to reserve this name anywhere else? Walleyefisher and Larrym, don't know who you are, don't care. I use this site on a regular basis as well and have people who know me by T-Mac (see the first response by Paully). I may have even posted here before the other T-Mac! If your correspondence with the other T-Mac is so important, maybe you should also consider e-mailing him directly. On to fishing.. Canadian Club, we will be arriving at Lac Seul the same day. We stay at Gold Pines in Ear Falls and prefer to travel toward the center of the lake (McKenzie Bay, High Banks and beyond). We stay at Gold Pines mainly because it is very family and kid friendly. CC have you been to Lac Seul before?"
539685,2746,2004-05-19 12:50:00,3206,Thanks for responding.....I can see where the request might be offensive. It's also being discussed on the Boat & Motor and General Discussion boards (if your interested in looking) and it appears Walleye Central may be able to do something to fix the confusion.
539686,Guest,2004-05-19 12:56:00,0,"Larrym - I'm not offended at all, like I said- all I wanted was a fishing report. The good thing is at least this controversy (term used lightly) is keeping my post at the top of the board! With no responses??? Actually, it looks like I won't get a report before I leave... I will provide a fishing report for Eagle when I return. Take care all... Paully, I'll see you in Duluth next week some day!"
539687,Todd_NE,2004-05-19 12:58:00,1330,"You simply are deflecting. Who cares how broad a technology the Internet is (like broad means anything). I didn't realize he asked for ESPN, BASS, and other board name rights. The original T-Mac is a class act and tried to handle it nicely. Maybe it will work out for the better, but you could have handled this better too. Reputation is the most important thing any of us have and Terry has definitely earned a good one here. I like the fact you acknowledge you've rarely posted her BUT the guy 99.9% of us know and respond to or ask questions of should CHANGE his handle. Todd"
539691,Guest,2004-05-19 13:27:00,0,"Todd, How could I have handled this better? I agreed to use a different name even though there are people who I correspond with who know me by that name - and responded sooner than anyone else to my message. Please read the messages and proof your messages before you send them out. The original T-Mac indicated that he uses this name on Walleye Central among others... implying that this is his name many places. I have the same situation, I use T-Mac on other sites. Also I didn't say I ""rarely post her"" actually I try to ""post her"" as often as she will let me! T-Mac can have his name on this site, it's not that big of a deal to me but if you want to criticize, at least get the facts correct. Officially... T-Mac Wannabe"
539617,Guest,2004-05-18 08:01:00,0,I'm heading to Eagle Lake this weekend and was wondering if anyone had a fishing report for the first few days of the season?
539629,Guest,2004-05-18 14:30:00,0,ttp
539630,Guest,2004-05-18 14:59:00,0,"Wise man say, ""Why drive all of the way to Eagle and struggle to catch fish? Just drive another 1.5 hours to Lac Seul?"""
539631,Guest,2004-05-18 15:07:00,0,"Soon we will my friend... only 37 more days until we are there! Unfortunately, the in-laws are old and stuck in their ways.... I'm heading to Eagle and will try to convince them to drive north to the promise land. At least for Lac Seul you can get a &*^% fishing report!"
539633,Guest,2004-05-18 15:31:00,0,"This post is not by me, folks. I don't know this person. :) -T-Mac... (the boat dealer from Montana who has been posting here since before the turn of the century)."
539651,68 starcraft,2004-05-19 02:59:00,32,"I think you should take a day and go north to Lac Suel and see what real canadian fishing is all about. Fished Eagle last year, water level was low and it warmed to fast and really slowed down the walleye fishing, best bet was trolling with boards. Not to mention we never caught a Laker all week. Hopefully conditions will be better for you this year, If the water temp is in the 50's you should have a great week, dont overlook the shallows if water is cold it will hold alot of walleye and Lakers. I'll be At Lac Suel May 28th (10 more days)"
539655,sleepin late again,2004-05-19 03:42:00,9,"Hey Green Star War Figher, I think the water was low because all the fish were gone, in Vermillion Lake! It was warm because Hammerhead Slayer was buzzin the shoreline and his spinnerbait was so fast....it heated up the water? Makes cents to me....and better cents...not going to Vermillion Bay"
539666,Guest,2004-05-19 07:26:00,0,"68 Starcraft, you are correct when it comes to Eagle. It is a good fishing lake until the 1-2 week of June, then it's just like fishing MN. Unfortunately, this is the 1 fishing trip/ year that I'm not in control - it is the in-laws trip, I just love to fish. I'll be at Lac Seul soon... maybe this weekend if I can convince them."
539669,Guest,2004-05-19 08:29:00,0,"Any chance you could use a different handle? I have been using ""T-Mac"" as my ""handle"" for about 6 years in Walleye Central, and everywhere else. I can't register it because of the hyphon in it and my e-mail being a ""hotmail"" (unacceptable, I guess) address....... I tried to, but WC software won't accept. Thanks in advance. (the original) ""T-Mac""."
539673,Guest,2004-05-19 09:09:00,0,"I have used this as well over the years. I may not be as ""regular"" a poster on Walleye Central as you but I'm not sure what the big deal is.... I don't intend to give the T-Mac designation a bad name... I just want to fish. You could always change yours to Montana T-Mac if you are concerned or change your designation to something that can be registered if you want a more specific designation to you?"
