Hoping some of you can give me some advice for opening weekend walleye. I will try to give some info without writing a book. We do pretty good in summer on this lake but the opener has been tough with o walleyes caught in some years. The ice went of 11 days ago. So the water is still very cold. The water is high this year. Last year we tried shallow to deep in countless areas with no luck. The shallow spots that we did try only produced pike and bass, so we had to move so we wouldn't hook any more sm bass. The weather has been warm this week but yesterday it clouded over and got cold tonite, forecast is sunny with warming temps for today and the rest of the weekend. Any ideas as where they might be hiding? The only thing I can think of is to give it a try at night and maybe those pike and bass will be replaced with walleye. I know its hard without me describing details about the lake but just some ideas would be great. Will check in here over the weekend. Thanks."
