539876,cast_and_blast,2004-05-24 12:35:00,1098,I'll be interested to read any responses as I'll be there in Mid July and again the beginning of September. Scott
539891,Guest,2004-05-24 15:36:00,0,"I try to go there every other year in early june. My in-laws have been going there for about 20 years now. The fishing, in my opinion, is as good as it gets. From Coppens you have access to Redgut, Swell, And Seine bays. The cabins are nothing fancy, but the owners are great. The guy who runs it, Ed, is very helpful with the lay of the lake, not so much fishing, but where the danger spots are. Anyway, by far my favorite lake and my favorite part of that lake to fish is in that area. Wish I could help you out more with the fishing patterns, but I have never been up there in July."
539915,Guest,2004-05-25 09:34:00,0,"Thanks for the comments. We took a guided trip to Eastern Rainy from Kabetogamma last year, and had a much better luck there than Kab. This year we were looking to stay on the Canadian side of Rainy and check it out. I was amazed by all the boat traffic on the US side. We were flown over multiple times by a float plane. I assumed it was the MNR making sure we were on the right side of the line. Any general comments about the north eastern (Canadian) side of Rainy? Thanks Go_Fish"
539917,Guest,2004-05-25 10:39:00,0,"Get yourself the canadian hydrographic map of the area (actually you'll need 2 as one contains Redgut and the other has Bears Pass area and Swell and Seine. Have fished the area in mid-July twice and found lots of eye's on the reefs and island tips. Look from 15'-25' to start. As you first go into redgut from bears pass there is a structure of 3 reefs close together that has produced in July (most likely boats there) Also a short ride north is moose island, work around the west and north sides of it. We always used either lindy with leech/crawler or pulling harness's with crawler. Many spots in Swell also, try the islands on the south side and work the point areas. You will also find smallies in the same areas, only a little shallower. Water this year to date is really cold, heard only upper 40's right now. I will be on Kab for 5 days this weekend and fishign has been very tough so far. I havnt stayed at coppens, but camped at the fisheries and taylors cove. Heard that Coppens is a nice place and reasonable. Xplorer"
