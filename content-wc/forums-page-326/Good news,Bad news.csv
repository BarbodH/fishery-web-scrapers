I cherish those moments and can see why you're sad that they're not coming this year. But to have a new ""little one"" around will be awesome. I'll have to get caught up with you in August. See you at Gawleys!"

See you at Gawleys!Bill, congrats on the new grandson. In just a few quick years you will have another fishing buddy. Like Fishin Fun, I didn't do much fishing with my kids while they were growing up, but now have a grandson who is really ""hooked"". He started going with us 5 years ago when he was 10 and will be making his 4th and 5th trips to Lac Seul this summer. The stories we can tell about our experiences over the past 5 years are endless and priceless. Hope to hook up with both you guys in the 1st week in August."
2867825,btmbncr,2014-06-04 19:48:00,492,The good news is our youngest daughter is going to give us a new grandson.The bad news is she and hubby won't be going to Lac Seul with us on our trip.She'll be too far along. I do have a friend that is going to come up for two weeks.He has never walleye fished in Canada before.He'll be with us the last week of July and the first week of August.Bill

2867945,Clairebear,2014-06-04 20:11:00,938,Welcome aboard Grandad. Just welcomed my first G Daughter 8 months ago and can't wait till I can hold her tiny hand and take her fishing. Cheers
2868377,btmbncr,2014-06-04 22:04:00,492,"My first grand daughter,Payton,will be one year old on June 8th.She is the joy of our life.I'm ""Grandpa Whiskers"" she has been fascinated with my beard for a long time. Wally Dave,no Snoopy pole for our grandson.I have a new Quantum Bait Casting reel with a Flipping switch and an IM-7 6'6"" bait casting rod with his name,to be decided yet,on it. When a grandchild is born into the BTMBNCR clan a .22 lr bolt action rifle with a Leupold scope on it,20 gauge semi auto shotgun and a bottombouncer rod set up is purchased by the Patriarch of the family,me.Male or female child. I did this for both of my step daughters after I married their mother.Both girls are hunting and fishing maniacs.Their spouses are both hunters and fisherman and they share this with their spouses.Bill"
2868393,BreezyPoint,2014-06-04 22:07:00,1581,I like that you will be giving them good tackle! My son was using spinning rods at age three and bait casting at four. Eliminates the frustration that cheap tackle causes. They are way more capable than we give them credit for.Frank
2868409,btmbncr,2014-06-04 22:27:00,492,"FrankAmenI have a Plueger President spinning reel on a Fenwick rod with 6 lb test for each Grandchild. My father bought me ""good"" gear from early on.I only wish I would have hung on to the Browning A 5 he bought me for my 12 th birthday.My Plueger Supreme bait casting reel and my Mitchell 300 wore out a long time ago.Bill"
