2872729,Medds1,2014-06-06 09:59:00,18,"The camp is open and the water is high, the highest it has been in many years. As with trips up north the bugs are plentiful and the fish are to. We just got camp opened up and are waiting for our first crew to arrive shortly. There is one slight change for the season, the camp was sold and as the new owners we are not looking to make any big changes. The camp life here appears to be just the way you guys liked it, we are just hoping to improve on a few things and get input from this years attendees as to where to go for next seasons improvements. I am sure that your trip will be just as enjoyable as the ones before it, granted mother nature works with us and gives us some good weather! We look forward to seeing everyone this seasonThank You"
2873609,Guest,2014-06-06 16:08:00,0,The bugs will drive you crazy at times but the fishing is worth it. take repellent I will be there June 20th. It is great
573982,beagle22b07,2008-05-16 13:45:00,34,I may have an opportunity to fish here the first week of August this year. I did a search of the site and couldn't get any hits. Has anyone that may have fished here have any comments? How's the fishing? Accomodations? Are there other outfitters on the lake? It's a drive-in camp and I'm just looking for information as to how good of a trip it might be. Thanks Larry
573994,Guest,2008-05-16 22:17:00,0,I fished there my first trip to Canada about 8 or 9 years ago. There were different owners then. Its a small camp with only 4 cabins.I think.The cabins were fine.Most were set up for four people and one bigger one that could handle eight. The only access is through this camp so the only people you`ll see will be the other guests in camp.The lake is relatively small with lots of water moving through.Its a place where you should use the camp boats because there is lots of fishing down river over the portage.There are boats and motors waiting just carry a gas can.Their website shows and explains the system very well.When I was their we brought our own boats so we couldn`t go downstream.A couple of our guys went with the former campowner downstream and had better fishing than in the upper part of the river.I went back a couple years later with my wife and had better luck fishing than the first time there.Northerns seemed more abundant than walleyes. All in all its a nice place. I still go to canada fishing in that area and wouldnt mind going there again. But I like using my own boat and theres other places that fit my budget a little better.
574029,beagle22b07,2008-05-19 10:44:00,34,"gea tee Just wondering why taking your own boat would restrict you from going to one of the portage sites? You don't have to take the boat over the portage, right? I'm like you though, I like to fish out of my own boat. I have all the electronics, accessories, etc. Why not go in style. Larry"
574052,Guest,2008-05-19 19:34:00,0,The portages are over rapids or around waterfalls.The distances arent that far but you wouldnt want to drag or carry a boat that far.For sure not boatable.
574053,Guest,2008-05-19 19:41:00,0,No you can use camp boats that are tied up below the falls.But if you took your own boat you would end up renting a boat anyway. The best fishing is over the portages. I don`t know if the new owners even offer a lower price for bringing your own boat so might as well leave it home.
574369,beagle22b07,2008-05-28 10:56:00,34,"gea tee Thanks for the info. I hooked up with some local guys from Pittsburgh and we're set for the 1st week of August. I haven't decided if the boat is an option yet since I'll be going with a new group of guys. If anyone else has any feedback, please post. Thanks Larry"
2201337,Medds1,2013-11-04 07:09:00,18,Has anybody been fishing this water in the past few years? I am just a bit of research for the up coming season.
2214730,clutch6886,2013-11-11 12:13:00,1,"Medds1, I've been to Sturgeon River Outfitters 17 times in the past 19 years. It is a beautiful spot and quite amazing how much water you can traverse for such a small camp. It suits both the lazy and active fisherman. We are generally lazy fishermen and can catch about 150 walleyes per person in a week with going out a total of 13 times for about 3 hours of fishing each time (between 3 and 4 fish per hour per person). We almost always go up at the end of July and early August, not the best time to go for catching the most numbers, but is the best for our schedules. The weather tends to vary quite a bit during our visit and can greatly affect our numbers too. The owner is serious about increasing the number of walleyes in the river system and therefore has strict rules on the amount of fish you can keep. I'd recommend reading the fishing section on the website http://www.sturgeonriveroutfitters.com/fishing.html If you have further questions, feel free to message me. I do have pictures of the map of the river and lake system if you'd like it. Personally, I love the camp and would recommend any fisherman/family to spend a week there."
2215706,Medds1,2013-11-12 04:27:00,18,"clutch6886,I am always interested in hearing others stories of their trips up North. I have been going to Canada for the last 27 years and one of the first things I realized then was that, it is your vacation and how you choose to spend it is your choice. I have seen guys that get up and are ready to hit the water hours before it is light and then there is myself who is just happy to sleep till 9 and go hammer the fish at 11. However you choose to spend your vacation is totally up to you. This camp looks and sounds like a great adventure and should have some great fishing. I am looking forward to giving it a try."
