2868937,strength22,2014-06-05 07:24:00,49,Looking to go in august..probably 1st or 2nd week. Never been in august. Usually go early June and late September. How is the walleye fishing in august in northern Ontario. Usually fish Gullrock. Thanks.
2869897,Carnhzkr,2014-06-05 11:31:00,964,August is a great time for Canadian Walleye fishing for a lot of reasons. The walleye are much more predictable during the warm months. They tend to congregate and can often be found off mid-lake humps and ridges. Depending on the lake they'll probably be deeper than you're used to fishing in June - maybe 20 - 30 feet. A good bet on Gullrock would be off the edge of that big reef that's up by the Three Sisters.Some people have a crazy idea that walleye are hard to catch in August. I think August is a great time to go.

2870329,strength22,2014-06-05 13:37:00,49,Thank you for the reply's. I figured they would be in deeper water. Even in September I catch a lot in the 20-25 ft range. June is a different story..6ft-20ft it seems..all over the place. Is it pretty hot in august though? Bugs bad?
2870417,Carnhzkr,2014-06-05 13:55:00,964,"Sure, it can be hot, and it sucks being on the water on a sunny 85 degree day with no breeze, but there can be bad weather in June too. Overall, weather is more stable in August than June but you're always rolling the dice when it comes to weather. The only way to avoid the bugs is to go in late September (one of my favorite times), but June is probably the worst month for mosquitos. There will be bugs, but likely not as bad in August as in June."
2870425,Fishin Fun,2014-06-05 13:56:00,218,"I've fished Gullrock the first week in August the past couple of years. Found the fish in 15-30ft of water. Never had an issue catching numbers of walleyes, but last year had problems catching larger walleyes. Caught a lot of 17-18in, but only a handful above that size. Still.. I love to fish Gullrock and that lake has always been good to me."
2870593,strength22,2014-06-05 14:48:00,49,Yeah September is by far my favorite time of the year to be up there. love the weather then and the fall colors. I am a college coach so it is hard to get away in Sept.
