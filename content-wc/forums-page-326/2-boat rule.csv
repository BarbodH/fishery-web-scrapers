2871865,DocDug,2014-06-05 21:37:00,9,We'll be fishing North of Minaki last week of June 2014. Found out that my cell phone provider has an international call option that I can take for one month. Coverage is good for all the lakes around Minaki. Trying to get things set up with others in the party so we will have one cell phone in each of four boats. Cost is no longer prohibitive and don't need to worry about line of sight as with walkie-talkie. Can also call any number in Minaki in the case of an emergency.
2872049,Guest,2014-06-06 04:29:00,0,We always leave a note in the cabin on the table as to where we will be fishing each day. That way if by chance there is a issue at least they know where to start looking and eliminates a lot of water.
2872081,Pooch,2014-06-06 05:02:00,4619,"Ditto the note in cabin. Wife and I try to always leave a note on the table as to where we are going to fish that day. Both lakes we like to fish are large, smallest is 90,000 acres and the other is Lac Seul. Both lakes can sting you if you're caught in a storm or have boat problems.The two boat rule is great, but just letting someone know where to look if you don't come back that night is priceless for those waiting in the cabin for you to come in.In fifty plus trips, our groups have always been very lucky in that everyone has always made it back in without us having to go looking for them. Some late and others running on fumes. Hope our good luck streak continues for another fifty.Pooch"

2653049,oldfart,2014-04-08 11:38:00,21,"After reading the comments in the ""Survivorman"" post, thought I might add something for comment/suggestion. When on fly-in trips, we always try to follow the ""2-boat"" rule-that is, when out of sight of the cabin, 2 boats fishing relatively close to each other in case of motor or other trouble. Hate to be 10 miles down the lake with no motor and 1 paddle to make it back!!!!! Tried walkie-talkies once, but only worked if in sight of each other anyway. If the 2-boat rule is not possible, we have strict checkin times with someone coming to look for us at a given time. Any thoughts?????"
2653153,tv4fish,2014-04-08 11:55:00,2694,"Walkie-talkie radios will work - but you need to get ""better"" ones that have a decent range. We have used them before on Lac Seul (that way - if one boat is ""into"" the fish, you can let the other boat know -- And then - you will have company) .....They also come in very handy for traveling on the road trip."
2653353,Lovetofish,2014-04-08 12:46:00,458,If I was up there alone with just my son and one boat I'd have a spare motor and prop along.
2653569,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-08 13:34:00,1460,"Nice thread Oldfart! That's exactly how we roll. It is only prudent safety wise to go out on the lake with a partner boat. Many a time there have been motor problems and even a time or two when someone runs outta gas and needs a tow back to camp. We've also done the walkie talkie thing a few times as well and there have been times when they do come in handy, but there are big drawbacks such as the other boat forgetting to turn their's on. Nope, I'm not much interested in sitting on the shore somewhere with a disabled boat hunting blueberries and whining at my kid."
2653929,packpro,2014-04-08 15:06:00,695,"We do the same. One boat needs to be in sight of another boat. Always check in before making a move. Just need to get close enough for a wave. If moving out of sight. We give details of location. Then next boat that moves checks in before making a move. In seventeen years we have had about 8 or 9 tow ins. It is amazing with 4 stroke, 25 HP motors. You leave in good weather in the morning. Run all day. You're possibly six miles from camp. Weather kicks up 2-3 footers into the wind, you can use 3x the gas it took to get out to the spot. Different day- no weather, same trip, and you come back with more than 1/2 tank. We also pick an mid lake/river apex point to meet at the end of the day. Our location has many tentacles off the main body of water. Back in the days before GPS that meeting place saved me many times as I was new to fishing in Canada. It is amazing how the shore line, and islands all look the same. My group gave me a very very large map after the second year as I was frequently ...ahem ""misdirected"". When I asked, ""why so big, this isn't practical in the boat at all"" They responded. That it is not for direction, it is to be used as a blanket when we can't find you"". ...LOL After seventeen years I get it now, but I was severely directionally challenged back in the day. Lots of stories involving me running full speed into dead end bays only to whip around and try the next bay over with the same result. I figure my group has hours of stories on me. I own it. Bought a Garmin 176- 14 years ago. Man I love technology. Who knows what island I would be living on right now."
2654521,jimmie,2014-04-08 17:31:00,123,Don't foget the whistle that you are required to carry on Canadian waters. That's what it for to save you when in trouble. If you are more than 5 miles across the lake it may not be heard. I've made a prctice if I'm out form the landing any great distance or in an unfamiliar area to watch for boats leaving and be quick to follow just in case. Most any angler will give you a helping hand when you need it. If not then a looooooong paddle its likely to be.
2654713,3M TA3,2014-04-08 18:22:00,2846,"Often, only one boat in my party, and sometimes it's just me. I suppose my emergency kit is a little bit more elaborate and I usually plan on self rescue. Most important, I let folks know where I'm going and when I expect to return."
2654921,Baxman1958,2014-04-08 19:11:00,14,"Great story PackPro!Speaking for myself, my five brothers and I all went through the same learning curve. The great thing is when you go back, you quickly remember landmarks; and the feeling of Deja vu.You feel like you are home..........."
2656441,MrSimon,2014-04-09 07:56:00,922,"I've been fishing with the same guys for decades ..... so we kind of just know where the other boat is or what they are doing/going. There are lots of times the boats aren't within sight of each other ..... behind an island or around a point ...... but we always check in before making a big move to a different part of the lake. There have been plenty of times where we get separated for a couple of hours, but we always find each other without too much trouble. If a boat doesn't show up as they normally would, its time to go find them."
2662641,Aaron-IN,2014-04-10 09:54:00,500,"This isn't just an issue on a fly in, but just about anywhere. My father always likes to get up to our place right after the ice comes off and he can get to the island. A few years ago he made the not so wise choice to go out one evening to cast some isolated bays on the Winnipeg River North of Minaki. He was probably the first person to open camp that year on that system. Not to mention he was by himself that spring for a few weeks, he got stranded with boat issues and it took him two full days to paddle back to the island. He did learn his lesson though"
