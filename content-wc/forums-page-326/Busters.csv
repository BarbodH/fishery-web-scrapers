That means you are relegated to baked goods from the Bakery (very good I must say, but not the ""stick to the ribs"" feeling of a good egg spread) or picking some grab and go food up at Bobbys. The fort structure is supposedly doing something, but it is not obvious where their cafe is. This will be rough on V Bay as people will probably opt to stay in Dryden if they can't get a good breakfast. Local take is that Busters is run by a bunch of rich people that don't care about serving the community. Busters' personnel take is that they can't afford to offer breakfast at a loss. I can't imagine they lose money over the weekend on breakfast. What other options have you found, besides just staying in Dryden?"

2860513,SinOrSwim,2014-06-03 06:43:00,1528,There is a solution. All the people that are upset could open their own cafe and compete with them. Breakfast doesn't have competition it sounds like? Agreed it stinks for the people who have been eating there but I would agree if they were making money they would continue to provide the service.
