We are hoping so because we've been told (we aren't super experienced walleye fishermen) that, if the spawn is on-going, the larger females will be hard to catch. Is that true? Any techniques to work around that? Thanks!"
2865577,LoDo,2014-06-04 09:16:00,721,"My guess is the spawn is over. I fished roughly the same parallel just west of where you'll be May 21 to 29 and the spawn was full on. The fishing was as tough as I've experienced in a long time. Find shallow water, 4-15' jig and a minnow. You should be fine. Too be honest, your timing should be perfect!"
2866409,yoopertrout,2014-06-04 11:43:00,1172,Thanks! I'm getting stoked. This will be our first fly-in ever. Sorry to hear that your fishing wasn't so great. I hope the rest of the summer is good to you.

My guess these small eyes are not mature enough to spawn so that is why they bit so well. I did catch one 8lb 30"" female right at dark but that was it for females. Very slow fishing! Caught about 5 males over 19 inches and they were milking like crazy. Our group of 4 guys caught 70 walleye and 45 pike for the week. We could have easily caught more pike than walleye if we were concentrating on Pike.I would bet you will be in prime time for walleye. Good luck! PS. Most walleye were caught on jigs with grubs tipped with salted minnows."

2867465,camp chef,2014-06-04 17:50:00,915,On Rainy Lake the last week of May the big girls were all spawned out and recovering in 30 to 40 feet of water.Hungry as could be. All you had to do was find them. I would guess they are starting to move to the shallows this week. At least at that latitude.
