2867305,Sportdog,2014-06-04 16:58:00,6735,"So what do you guys take for a day of fishing walleye and pike? Here's a thought for me and would like opinions. Walleye. 1/8 & 1/4 oz jigs in orange, chartreuse, and pink. Couple packs of plastic grubs and gulp minnow. 3-4 crawler harness rigs. 3-4 minnow baits. 6' spinning jigging rod w/fire line. 6 1/2' med spinning outfit for casting hard baits. Pike. Bucktails, big spinner baits, couple surface baits, couple plastic swim baits. 7' med-heavy baitcaster. Still too much or am I good? Thanks guys."
2867521,KC Walleye,2014-06-04 18:15:00,274,"That doesn't sound like enough to me! Haha. Just kidding, but I have a tackle and rod and reel obsession. You should be good for 1 day. Hopefully you find what they are looking for that day! Good luck!"
2867593,codyhcahoon,2014-06-04 18:26:00,112,I have the same obsession right now for between me and my buddies stuff in the boat there are about 15 3700 Plano boxes and there will be about 14 rods in the boat for a three day trip this weekend. Never know what or how they will want it always seems like it changes about the time I get there
2867609,port1042,2014-06-04 18:40:00,509,"That's close to enough but what if you pick up a nice perch and need to stay on them? Then the smallies go on a feeding frenzy. What do you do then? I got back from my spring trip a week ago. Loaded the camp boat on Saturday, fished all week and emptied the boat on Friday night. I found one tackle box in the front compartment I had completely forgotten I took with me. I sure needed that stuff!"
2868425,btmbncr,2014-06-04 22:33:00,492,"SportdogI take everything,5 crankbait boxes,6 or 7 Plano 3700 spinner/leader boxes,bottom bouncers and a pile of jigs and plastics.I have the storage room on my boat so why not. I can't count the number of times that it wasn't a live bait bite but cranks slaughtered them or vice versa.Or the crank bite slowed down and we sat over them and vertical jigged up additional fish.Bill"
2868801,BornToFish,2014-06-05 06:33:00,1224,"The lake that I fish in NW Ontario is always showing a species of fish. Something is always biting. It can change from day to day or within a given day. I've learned over the years that I need to respond to changes within the lake and by the fish species. My wife and I fish for each species of fish sometime during the day. We might be fishing for walleyes in the early morning, casting for muskies should we pass by a good musky spot and then fishing for perch twenty minutes later. I keep the following rods in the boat at all times: Ultralight power spinning rod for perch, Light power spinning rod for walleyes and bass, Medium Heavy or Heavy power casting rod for pike and a Medium Heavy Musky power casting rod for muskies. I often have other rods in the boat as well. My wife has her own equipment. We have plenty of tackle in the boat for the above species of fish. Realistically, we probably use about 10-20% of the tackle we take on our trips. The remainder stays in the cabin or truck as back-up gear for plans ""B"", ""C"", ""D"" should plan ""A"" not deliver for us. Fishing gear gets swapped between the boat and the truck/cabin as conditions warrant. I encourage you to have enough gear in your boat at all times to be flexible with each of the principle species of fish in your lake. I don't know as though I can have too much tackle in my boat, so long as it is all safely and securely stowed away. Good fishing and tight lines!"
2871265,CMesserschmidt,2014-06-05 19:41:00,1006,"I bring 2 packs of fire tiger stand up jigs. Never needed anything else. BoOOOOm! Ok so that what I bring in the boat, but do bring up the tackle box."
2871305,Fishin Fun,2014-06-05 19:49:00,218,"I have every jig ever made I think. My tackle box weighs more than my 11 year old I swear. Still have room for crankbaits, lindy rigs, and panfish tackle. Every year before I go to Canada I say I'm going to thin it out, but end up going to Cabelas and buying something new. I have a problem, but I can't admit it. Beyond help."
2871345,headcheese,2014-06-05 19:54:00,456,"if you have room in the boat, bring it!!"
2871617,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-05 20:38:00,84,It's just what us fisherman do!
