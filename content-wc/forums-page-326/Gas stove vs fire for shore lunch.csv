2866257,castnblast,2014-06-04 11:13:00,111,The stove is fast but I prefer a fire. I find the trick is to burn the right size wood (a little smaller than the size of your wrist) One guy cuts fish - another starts the fire.. Get a burn going and let the fire settle so it's an even heat not flaring and you are good to go.
2867905,ohiojmj,2014-06-04 20:05:00,1262,"Frying pans, stoves, grates, oil, etc. in boat shows the dedication to a shore lunch. We've never considered a shore lunch because of the gear required in boat and time spent away from fishing, although enjoying the outdoors is part of the mission. Packing a 12"" cold cut sub sandwich and a few cold beers is our approach to lunch on the lake. Sometimes, we just go back to camp for a big mid-day meal. Most times, we leave camp a crack of dawn, come back for a few hours in afternoon, head out til dinner time or stay out til dark, head back for evening fry, cleaning fish in morning of course."

2858001,MrSimon,2014-06-02 12:38:00,922,"We've done it both ways. Fire is fun and feels more rugged .... but it takes a lot of time and effort, and its tricky to get just right. Gas is quick and easy - cooks evenly .... but you have to lug stuff in your boats. Now, we just head back to camp in the middle of the day for a big meal and some relax time. Go back out in the afternoon and fish till dusk. Come back, light a fire and sit around for a couple hours snacking and hanging out."
2858217,btyreprich,2014-06-02 13:15:00,1067,Could not agree more with Live to Jig about an open fire. I use old grates from gas grills people toss out. The grates that hold the ceramic stones are perfect for shore lunch kits. They really hold up well to excessive heat.
2861521,labsrus,2014-06-03 10:23:00,557,"If our group is staying near the cabin or camp we will meet back at camp for the midday meal Then we would use the camp stove and gas to cook the fish If we are running far from camp we will all take part in meeting at a predetermined time at a place up the lake or river I enjoy both methods, wood fire or gas stove. There is something unique about a wood fire that keeps me wanting more. Some flyin place we have gone required a long boat ride to get to the good spots. So when we need to run a ways a shore lunch with the fire hits the spot."
2862241,KurtG,2014-06-03 12:33:00,259,"I've had many enjoyable shore lunches cooked over an open fire and just as many bologna sandwiches due to lack of fire (wet wood, terrible wind, whatever) would never consider has as it takes away the ambiance of a shore lunch. If I were really set on a fish lunch, I might consider a gas cooker of some type but it just would not be the same."
2862281,Sportfisher,2014-06-03 12:43:00,47,"Elkman: I don't think you will get 2-12"" pans on a 2 burner stove. I do a lot of cooking over a 2 or 3 burner stove and I always had trouble getting 2 larger pans on the stove, and getting them to heat evenly. Our group does not use the stoves for shore lunch. We cook over a fire. It is good to walk around and collect firewood. I carry a ""trenching tool"" and a hatchet and saw to get the firewood. We always dig a small hole for the fire, and when we are done, we soak it with water and cover it up. Works well for our group (6-8). YMMV"

Seal the two holes in the lid of the pressure cooker with high temp silicone and when your done with shore lunch and the oil is cooled down lock the lid on the pressure cooker, throw it in the boat and your oils either ready for tomorrow with no mess in the boat or ready to dispose of back in camp. These two things and a small rubbermaid (shorelunch) box with the essentials inside take up very little room in the boat and make for great shore lunch every day."
2864969,elkman99,2014-06-04 06:50:00,180,"Thanks for the feedback. I was wondering about the dimensions on most stoves no being big enough. Have you or anyone else used the 20"" skillets with the really long handles? are they made decent or are they just cheapo chinese cookware?"
2864985,Sportfisher,2014-06-04 06:54:00,47,"I haven't used those ""giant"" skillets. I doubt you will get one to work on a gas stove. Also remember, it takes a lot of heat to warm one of the cast iron ones up."
2865857,elkman99,2014-06-04 10:07:00,180,"I was thinking those might be good for the open fire. We use cast iron now, and love it, but it is heavy. can't imagine how heavy a cast iron giant skillet would be lol. I think these are made out of a moderate guage steel."

Cooking over an open fire is not a simple thing to do. Temp control is key. Same as cleaning a fish. Watch one of us do it that don't fish a lot and then watch one of the guides do it, and you know who the pro is very quickly. LOL"
2842801,bigwalleye1,2014-05-28 19:17:00,2632,"I'm on the ""gas"" side of this discussion. I took an old propane turkey fryer burner and modified it so the legs remove to pack. Fits in my cook box and I power it with a 10 lb LP cylindat fits under the floor in my boat. I can do lunch for 4 in under an hour, and no diddling around with wood or putting out a fire. I get all kinds of heat and can do my spuds and onions in a chicken fryer, put the lid on, start my dutch oven going, and fry all the fish, and with that cast iron, we all still get hot spuds."

Part of the Canadian fishing experience is to have a relaxing shore lunch with fresh fish breaded in flour and cooked in lard over a wood fire. Canada fishing for us is a time to kick back, relax and leave worries at home. If shore lunch takes a bit of time to do then so be it. There is no time clock with us."
2854513,packpro,2014-06-01 11:44:00,695,For us the fish is the star not the fire. Question for all you traditionalist. Are you using any electronics on your boat? Do you have a motor on the back or do you just row out to your favorite spots?
2854553,SinOrSwim,2014-06-01 11:56:00,1528,"I have to say I thought the same thing. Get out of our air conditioned trucks, go fishing in our nice comfortable swivel seats, watch the $1500 electronics, mark your spots with GPS. To each their own. We have done it over fire and with propane. We have had good results but I agree the trip is about relaxing. Not standing next to a raging hot fire in 90 degree weather is better imo. But, if you are good at it and enjoy it go for it. We ruined many O Filets whether that be oil too hot or too cool. Sort of like the first few pancakes. The first few never turn out great. Well, I don't have to clean more pancakes to cook em. I'll take the gas with a thermometer in the oil anyday."

2841249,SinOrSwim,2014-05-28 11:06:00,1528,We take a cooker from camp with us. Do not take our own and have bee doing this for years. Camp we are at now has small ones with small tanks. Works great. Gets temp up quickly and can keep temp in the wind. We also take one of those long turkey frier thermometers so we know what the oil is doing at all times. You can do the old match trick etc but this way we also know how much fish to load etc. Takes any guess work out of the equation. We take some garbage bags with us to put things in so the cookers dont' get the boats all dirty too.

I much prefer a wood fire. Part of it is the tradition of lunch cooked over a fire, and I honestly think it tastes better that way too. Can't explain how or why, but it does. Also, propane stoves are slower and cumbersome to lug around. Cooking over fire definitely takes some getting used to with heat control and keeping the pans level. Also, about shore breakfast…. I did that once for a group and it was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had. Tons of bacon, scramble eggs, deep fried potatoes and beans. It was a huge hit."

Even when it has been raining, I never have too hard of a time getting a fire started. I save paper towels from breakfast with bacon grease on them to get the fire roaring! We also have a small landscaping shear in our lunch box to cut off a few dead pine branches for the fire. Those orange pine branches really burn fast and hot. We put the kids in charge of collecting firewood while the adults clean fish and cut up potatoes or lemons."

More ""stuff"" to pack and it cooks slow. I think fish are better if they can cook quickly. Not as much oil is absorbed. A little crispier, too.Just our thoughts. Take care.Pooch"
507994,GregK,2000-05-22 12:55:00,113,"My wife and I have discussed this one for years. It all depends on how you feel that day. If the bush is wet and it's a cold blustery day, the wood fire is just the best ever from an esthetics standpoint.On the other hand, if getting back out on the water with a minimal amount or messing around, the stove is hands down the winner. Single burner is kind of a pain because you cannot heat coffee or beans at the same time. The stove removes all the chasing around for fire wood etc. Prep time is easily reduced by half. Most importantly there is much less chance of setting the woods ablaze. Whichever you choose please be careful with fire."

I have a two burner Coleman propane stove and a $5 folding sterno stove. The Sterno stove gets hot enough to heat up a pot of beans and the Coleman can fry fish and potatoes. By the time we're done eating, everything has cooled off enough to pack back into the boat. As for taking up too much room, I have a plastic tote that holds the stove, fry pans, paper plates, etc. It doesn't take up any more room than a cooler."

507998,Guest,2000-05-23 20:04:00,0,"I do shore lunch for 20+ guys on LOTW every year for 3 days. We have a system that works for us but it's not a traditional shore lunch by some standards, but it is quick & easy.Here's the drill: when we arive at the place we'r having lunch, I pull my propane fish cooker out of my boat and set it up, fill it with oil (1.5 Gal. US)and start heating it up. As that's happining a few guy's start cleaning fish and a few others start cutting up onions and tomatoes and buttering a few loaves of bread slices. As soon as the oil gets up to temp I start breading the fresh fish & frying them, I also do a few loads of sliced onions. As soon as we have a few loads of fish cooked the guys can start eating. We make fish sandwiches with tomato, onion, mayo & tartar sauce, pickles, and any other stuff you can think of to put on them. Some like them plain & some like them loaded but everyone makes there own sandwich so they get what they want.Like I said its not a traditional shore lunch but everybody keeps comming back year after year, and nobody has ever suggested we change it. Its just another way of eating fish. Oh, to get back to the origanal question, we use a propane cooker. To use wood, we'd sometimes have to carry it with us and some years no open fires are allowed."
507999,Guest,2000-05-24 05:33:00,0,"I have a propane cooker too, but I leave it at home. You must have a pretty good sized boat to be hauling that around, plus propane tank, plus cookware, etc. We just use the lodge's 16 ft. Lunds and a cooler and a plastic container for the stove, pots, plates, etc. plus two fishermen with all their tackle and gear, makes for a pretty full boat."
508000,Guest,2000-05-24 09:50:00,0,Nothing but nothing is better than a wood fire for the experience of a shore lunch. The cooking is only part of the experience. The whole idea in my eyes when in the bush is to slow down and relax a little. We bring dry wood from camp if it's really wet. Gas grills are convenient and quick but with me it seems something is missing. Good fishing Frank

I've been contemplating buying an older coleman stove just for shorelunch. Are the 2 burner stoves large enough for 2 12"" skillets? I'd also like to hear your guy's opinions on open fire (when allowed) and propane stoves. We plan on having a shore breakfast this year too, and thought that propane might be the way to go."
