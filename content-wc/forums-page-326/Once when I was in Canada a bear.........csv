2835537,Skyraptor,2014-05-27 02:33:00,291,Many years ago when I was a youngster we were staying at Manotak Lodge and behind the main lodge and owners home were small cabins that were used by the guides to stay while guiding clients. One guide Herman came back after a day of guiding and noticed his cabin door was ripped off the hinges and the door was open. He looked in a window and a bear was inside looking in cupboards for food. He went to the camp owner and borrowed a gun and when he came back the bear was in the bedroom and he shot it and the bear died. After that he always told the tale of how he shot a bear in his bed. Sad part is that some years later Herman's boat was found running in circles on Perrault Lake. He had been drinking and fell out of his boat and drowned!

2823473,Wawajake,2014-05-22 07:14:00,413,"a bear........had decided that the lake portage we were camped at was theirs. Many years ago as teenagers, my buddy and I went for a weekend trip with a car topper 10 ft aluminum boat , a 4 hp motor and tenting gear , and went 7 miles up Dunlop Lake (North of Elliot Lake Ontario) to a portage spot where Ten Mile Lake emptied into Dunlop. We arrive late afternoon and wanted to get in some fishing on Ten Mile lake before nightfall so we quickly set up the tent on the shores of Dunlop Lake on a previous grassy camp spot and then made the two trips carrying the boat and motor and tackle the 400 yard portage up to Ten Mile lake. That evening, as late May darkness was enveloping us, we carried the boat over our heads back down the trail to our tent. A hundred feet from our tent my buddy up front abruptly stops .as a bear crosses his path ten feet ahead. We freeze as the bear heads to our camp site. After awhile we realize it is not going to be leaving and we are not sure if cubs are around too. After as much noise as possible failed to scare it away, we decide to go off trail and plow thru the bush the rest of the way to Dunlop Lake and sit it out in the safety of the boat anchored 30 yards from shore. We only had the one obligatory paddle because the motor and fishing tackle were still up at Ten Mile Lake for the second trip back, so our choices were few and cold. A sleepless night ensued in the boat while the bear figured out our aluminum coleman cooler and investigated our tent. We listened to it's movements for hours and were prepared if any splashing out to us was to occur. By next morning it was confirmed gone by our rock throwing . So we retrieved our stuff and spent the rest of the weekend camped on an island, with leftover bread and margarine to fry our walleye fillets with. The following weekend the media reported a young couple was chased out of their ripped into tent the very same spot that we had camped. So I guess our night in the boat was the right choice !"

I was able to get some archives of the ""I Witness Video"" show (the first 5 episodes but it wasn't on any of those shows. The show only lasted a couple seasons ('93-'94) I think. Some of the archive sites want you to pay to join but I'm not doing that. I'm pretty sure the year was 1990. I'm sure he won't mind if I use his name, it's Tom Walter or ""Walt"" to his friends. If anyone out there can find it is worth watching."

Walt was backed into the water and the terrain was much rougher than this video. Also Walt filmed it with a large camcorder that uses full size VHS tapes used back then, not the small hand held vid cams used these days. I hope someone can find it as it is even more intense than this video. Thanks for sharing and searching for it."
2828089,BornToFish,2014-05-23 15:02:00,1224,"My brother and I hunted caribou in the NW Territories in autumn 2005. We stayed at a camp above tree line in the arctic. We stayed in a tent with wooden walls, which was next to the cook tent. One morning, we heard some firecracker type noises while we were still in our bunks. I quickly dressed and went outside my tent to investigate what was going on. I made it around my tent and was between my tent and the cook tent. The guides yelled for me to get back in my tent as a barren ground grizzly was coming out of the cook tent. I ran around to the opposite side of my tent, where the door was located. I reached the door as the bear passed me by. The bear was no more than four feet from me! Fortunately, the bear kept going in a straight line. The guides killed the bear a short while later, as the saying there is a ""fed bear is a dead bear"". Their MNR came into camp to investigate the matter, statements were taken and everybody cleared of any wrongdoing. We were pretty sure that the only thing that caused the bear to leave the cook tent was it biting into a gallon jar of Mexican salsa. The salsa was sprayed on opposite walls of the cook tent."
2832313,jaym,2014-05-25 18:17:00,89,"Once when I was in Canada a bear was sitting dead center on Highway 599 on our side of a crest of a hill as we were headed north. We drove right up to it and stopped, it finally stood up and walked slowly to the side of the road and sat down again. It acted like it just wasn't with it and we noticed a sign denoting a garbage dump. It was a large healthy looking bear and we couldn't figure out what it got into that messed him up. It was lucky no one coming over the hill heading south didn't run him over."

Now over the next few days there are many bear sitings at the camp. We came home one day and they are on the porch, Having had enough of bear during this trip we took a ride to the caretaker island to tell him we need to kill this bear.Outfitters and bears do not get along,they cause alot of damage. Bottom line we came back and the bear was on the porch,we waited for him to leave so we could get the rifle in camp.he went about 40 yrs away far enough for us to get the rifle. One well placed shot The bear was dead, We gave it to the local indians. It was not our intent to kill a bear but the kids did not listen. I can say they never left fish on the table to this date."

We watched him swim about 100 yards, then climb up an embankment, and take off running. Now the cow moose and her twin calf's that came after us on woman lake is another story. She thought we were getting to close her babies, and she came after us. We had to take evasive maneuvers quickly because she was on us fast. We were about 20 yards off shore casting a weed line and she didn't like us in her space."

Both bears wouldn't leave the camp, we were shooting fireworks at them n banging pans but they would just go into the woods and lurk back out. The resort owner shot both bears that week (gotta protect your camp). I got one shot on video but you know how those cameras were 20 years ago. I really dislike Canada's gun laws that i can't bring one across for my personal protection, staying at a very remote area. I did buy a machete and 8"" survival knife. Not goin down without a fight.EDIT: I believe the bears were in camp because they closed the dump which was 8 miles away."

We came around a point and the momma bear and her 3 cubs were on a small island connected to the shore by a shallow ledge. She saw us and took off. The 3 cubs all went up one tree. They were bawling and pretty much not liking us at all. We watched for a few minutes and then pulled back a little. We heard momma yell from the woods and the cubs scurried down the tree and took off. Was pretty cool.

On occasion we would have to wait for a bear to move because it was block the path from the dock to our cabin. During this trip the game wardens had to come in and trap a nuisance bear. That was pretty cool to watch.

2818897,SinOrSwim,2014-05-21 06:32:00,1528,"Came onto our screened in porch at our cabin and took a bag of garbage that contained mostly cans.Started out staying in a little motel in Kenora. I was just out of college and was working nights. I was up about 5am before everyone else so I went out to the truck to get some stuff. I only had a pair of shorts on. No shirt, no shoes. Heard somone moving around the other side of the building. I had been awake for awhile and was bored so I walked across the parking lot around the corner to say Hi and ask where they were headed. I came around the corner of the hotel and looked up. YEP. THere was a black bear standing on its back feet getting garbage out of a dumpster. It looked at me, I looked at it. I RAN SO FAST across the parking lot back to our room yelling BBBBBEEEEEAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRR. Flew intot he room and slammed the door scaring the crap out of the other guys who were asleep. LOL Then, at our cabin we had one come into the screened in porch. All of us were out on the porch after that listening and shining lights. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Then, you hear the crumpling of aluminum cans in the woods. Then, you see the glow of his green eyes. LOL So, we all go back in and sit around the table. We cleaned everything up and closed up the screened in porch. The bear broke through the bottom of the aluminum screen door making a huge bang!!!!!!! 6 grown men FLEW up from the table and all (for some reason) ran into the same bedroom and all huddled together. hahahhahahah We were all like..........what do we do what do we do. We go back out and there were chairs that when people got up flew completely across the cabin. The rest of that trip it didn't matter how drunk we were. If someone woke up at 2am and whispered, I have to pee you would slowly hear another say......yeah me too........then another........yep........and another. Next thing you know we are all out on the deck peeing off the deck with flashlights shining into the woods."

We both about had a heart attack, he went 30 ft up the closet tree, I went for a flashlight and my brother, we put the light on him and all of a sudden he came down that tree sending bark flying everywhere and believe it or not crapping all the way down. No one in camp wanted to believe that story, but the crap all over the base of the tree proved it! 29 more days !!!"

She had gone in to use the facility and when she looked outside, saw the pickpocket heading off with her purse. She panicked when she saw all of the cash they had brought along for the trip heading toward wooded cover, so without thinking she flew open the door, clapped her hands and yelled ""hey, hey, hey"" or something to that affect. Startled, the bear dropped the booty and scurried off.That's a true story, and one that's been retold countless times during family gatherings. You don't mess with a Nebraska farm wife."
2819497,Draco1206,2014-05-21 08:49:00,175,"...stalked and nearly killed my best friend, and it's all on video. The year was 1990 and it was my first Canadian fly-in fishing trip. Some of you older guys may have seen it on National Geographic, Real T.V., or if you're from Michigan you may have seen it on Fred Trost's Michigan Outdoors or his Practical Sportsman show. The story starts with my brother and I exploring a small feeder creek and after getting out of the boat to explore a marshy area we spotted a large moose. We went back and told the rest of the guys what we had seen and my friend wanted to go there that evening to see if he could film the moose. We all had those huge camcorders back then that took a full VHS tape (remember those? what a pain). Anyway his brother dropped him off that evening at about 8pm where we told him we saw the moose with intentions of picking him up in an hour. Now you have to picture this area, it was a large marsh with several beaver huts and the woods were full of beaver slashings and blow downs, very wild. My friend is a true outdoorsman/hunter/angler and had been going on these trips for years before I started going with him and always wanted to get some good film of a moose in it's natural habitat and not just along the roadside. So he hikes his way back into the marsh and starts to set up his video equipment when he hears some branches breaking up the hill behind him. His first thought was that it was a beaver dragging some branches down to the pond but when he turned around to look he saw a large bear at the top of the hill looking down at him. His next thought was ""cool I'm going to get some video of a bear and the guys will never believe this"". Unfortunately the bear had a different thought like ""that looks like it might be good to eat, I better go see what it is."" Well the bear just keeps getting closer and slowly stalking it's way towards him all the while he's filming. Soon he realizes the bear is getting too close and he starts yelling at the bear, but it pays no attention to him, so he starts backing away from the bear. He continues to scream at the bear while trying to climb over/under blowdowns and deadfalls being very careful not to fall because he believes if he falls the bear will attack. Several times while yelling ""go away bear"" the bear turns sideways and looks at him sideways and even stands up to look down at him. After what probably was a minute or so but felt like forever my friend was backed up against the water with no place to go but in the water with the bear only a few feet in front of him. Now remember this is just after ice out and my friend is wearing a one piece camo hunting suit with a pair of heavy Sorel boots. But in the water he must go, so he starts backing into the water until he is up to his neck with no where else to go and at one point on the video you can hear him say with his voice cracking "" I'm going to drown"". At this point it looks like the bear has stopped his stalk at the shoreline, but suddenly lunges into the water after my friend. This of course freaked out my friend and his video cam got wet and shut off. The bear apparently decided it didn't like it's prey wet so it went back to shore and disappeared or at least that's what he thought. After a minute or so he couldn't stand the cold water any longer and headed for shore and to try and get back to where his brother was supposed to pick him up. Unfortunately for him the bear hadn't gone very far and once my friend reached the shore the bear started his stalk again. Now once again picture ice out, soaking wet hunting suit and boots full of water, he could barely move let alone climb over blowdowns to escape the bear. When finally he was backed up against a blowdown he couldn't get over he knew he was in serious trouble (as if he weren't in enough trouble before). He knew that he had to go down to his knees to get under the blowdown and he knew the bear would come after him then, so as quickly as he could he got out his small jackknife (that he had received from his workplace for 10 years of service) and he ducked under the blowdown. Well Mother Nature is true to her reputation and the bear attacked. My friend popped up fast from the other side of the blowdown ready to strike the bear with his trusty penknife and screaming at the top of his lungs with the bear merely inches from his face it just stopped and walked away. Now there is so much more to this story as the video and he became pretty famous and he made lots of money, we had the Real T.V. show from California come to Michigan to set up a studio in his brothers house and we all were interviewed and they made a show about it, but this is already very lengthy so I'll finish by saying that we didn't catch many fish that trip but it is one we'll never, ever forget."
2819745,"6'3""",2014-05-21 09:57:00,47,"I saw that video on Fred Trosts show. One time our group was coming back to camp and a yearling ran across the trail right in front of us. I slammed on the brakes,jumped out of the truck and rushed at the bear while hollering at it. Little fella climbed the first tree he came to. Some of the gang thought I was nuts but you see I have two outdoor passions. I have bear hounds and have hunted them for 20 or so years so I'm not afraid of them but do respect them. Been close to hundreds of em and never had one come at me. Of course you can guess my other passion."
