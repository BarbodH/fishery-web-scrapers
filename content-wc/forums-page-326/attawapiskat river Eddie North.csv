2864281,Walleye Wanderer,2014-06-03 21:30:00,101,"#@%*&, I had to sit this year out myself...my bud's are up at Eddie's right now and I am miserable! WW"
2866065,pikeandtina,2014-06-04 10:39:00,145,"I feel your pain, WW! John"
2866449,yoopertrout,2014-06-04 11:52:00,1172,"I've looked at Eddie North's site, and it looks cool. I got the impression that it was mainly northern pike fishing. It is good walleye fishing too?"
2866601,new hips,2014-06-04 12:23:00,498,"it's a river system.........when you find them you can load up quickly. Usually you get one while fishing for Northern, then you can work them over with jigs and plastics."
2866809,Mike Borger,2014-06-04 14:03:00,1554,Tons of walleye and some big ones too.
2866929,deputy dog,2014-06-04 15:11:00,305,"Last year I got 30"", 28 1/2"", and 27 1/2""....all pb. So yes big walleyes!!!"
2867385,yoopertrout,2014-06-04 17:32:00,1172,Thanks. I'd like to go there someday. It looks incredible.
