Every year we catch lots of walleye, but, I always wonder about getting a guide for at least part of a day to see if we are missing out on anything.Sometimes we wind up making the trip to Miles Bay. It doesn't take many of those trips to pay for a guide. Tried a couple years before but our hosts only had a couple guides they recommended and they were either booked or out of town. Anyone have any recommendations? Ideas on prices? Will be there July !7-26. Would like to use my boat. PM me if you don't want to publish names. Thanks everyone. Slushfish"
