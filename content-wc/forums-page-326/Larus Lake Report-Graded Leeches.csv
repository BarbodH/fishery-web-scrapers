Never had to break out the rain gear, not even once. Fishing was a little more challenging because of the high water/cold water temps., but we found excellent numbers of walleyes in the feeder creeks, inlet river, and in the shallow bays, where the 'eyes were gorging on hatching insects. I got about 20 walleyes between 23-28 inches, which is great (for me) on any trip. So I was very, very happy with everything. I was a little put off by the small size of the leeches we ordered (by the pound). Is there a bait shop in Fort Francis, Emo, or Nestor Falls that sells graded leeches (medium, large, jumbo) by the pound? Would be willing to pay the extra premium to avoid the thumbnail sized leeches, which were basically useless. Thanks for any info. you can share!"

We started with Glenn & Sharon, and then went with Dave and Michelle.....always looked forward to the next trip. We could always count on live bait taking many 20-28 inch walleyes, and numerous large pike. We took many pounds of leeches, flats of crawlers and flew in up to 75 dozen minnows from the baitshop in Nestor Falls. We seldom had any bait left, and could cast Shad Raps toward shore and get many fish in a row... Later, I heard of groups trying to use artificial baits, and not getting as many large walleyes....always wondered if things had changed that much---(so few fish taken out of a large system). Would like to hear more about the details on where and what you use.... I know the accomodations are a lot nicer now.....;-) Great memories."
2870113,RCDuck,2014-06-05 13:01:00,18,"Larus is still an excellent fishery, but I don't think there is any question that the average size walleye is not what it was back in the 80's. I've made about 9 trips there, 7 being from 1984-1994 and 2 the last two years. It's hard to believe that having only two cabins on the lake, that you could put much of a dent on a fishery, but it seems that it did before they went to a catch-and-release policy. I may have a foggy memory, but it seems like I remember on those early trips (as a teenager), it was an everyday occurrence to pull stringers full of 4-6 pound fish out of the lake. The last few times I've been, we probably caught 1 a day per person in that size range... with the majority in the 14-18' range. Regarding the leaches... we take mostly minnows, but I did take about 5 lbs of leaches last year purchased from the Anglers pro-shop in Nestor, and I don't recall thinking they were too small. I'm not a leach expert, but is it easier to get bigger leaches later in the season, or are they not a seasonal thing.... we definitely have better luck on the minnows than leaches early in the year. We also have used some Gulp the last couple years... they can catch fish, but not at the rate the live minnows do.All in all, it's still an awesome place to go... from going there as a kid with my Dad and Grandpa, to taking my own kids there the last couple of years.... definitely a lot of memories made at Larus. Here's a pretty decent Northern my daughter caught from shore last year during shore lunch on a bare walleye jig:KateNorthern.jpgUnfortunately, we aren't going this year... I've been trying to get my wife to go the last couple of years, and an outhouse is apparently a deal-breaker... so, in order to get her to go, we're going to Hawk Lake this year... should be lots of fun, but I'll be back to Larus again."
