2872505,tv4fish,2014-06-06 08:11:00,2694,"IMO - completely uncalled for comment. (You get kudos for apologizing, which was only right to do)."
2872633,tooski,2014-06-06 09:07:00,393,"I have no interest in your opinion. I maintain if held out of the water over one minute it may not survive. Some website confirmations- An exhausted fish my swim away only to die a few minutes later, out of sight and out of mind. The longer you keep a fish out of water, the more strength it needs to re-oxygenate its blood when released. You can't go without oxygen for a minute or longer and neither can a fish! Limit the time you keep a fish out of water to a minute or less to insure its safety. Don't place your fingers in the gills of your fish Don't keep a fish out of water too long - it needs water for its oxygen supply. (from the DNR) Most fish can be secured by placing your wetted hand firmly at the back of the head, just behind or on top of (not under) the gill covers. Once you start talking in minutes instead of seconds, the fish can already be in trouble. There are a ton of variables that make it impossible to give a precise timeframe, but just get it back ASAP. With cameras that take 5-12 pictures per second on burst mode, and bump boards that give you a 1/4"" measurement in literally a couple seconds, there really isn't an excuse for the fish to be out of the water for more than 30 seconds. (From Manitoba DNR)"
2872985,JDP,2014-06-06 11:16:00,1457,++++++++++++++++++++++++ FWIW I agree with you completely!
2873089,MrSimon,2014-06-06 12:11:00,922,"Oh good grief ...... It was a short fight - netted quickly - cold water - 90 seconds out of water - swam away strong. That fish is happy and healthy! And besides ... instead of jumping down a guy's throat .... lets thank him for taking the time to take and post a fun video of a big walleye. I love watching videos like this. If we keep criticizing folks, they'll never post videos."
2873145,tooski,2014-06-06 12:44:00,393,"Save your grief for something important Simon... You have no idea if it swam away strong or if it's healthy. I certainly doubt it was very happy. I did not jump down his throat, I stated it was not personal, only that we as fisherman may need to re-think our views on fish videos. Glad you enjoy the fish video. There are a few thousand on Youtube.. I showed evidence from the Ontario and Manitoba DNR that fish should not be out of the water longer than one minute, at the outside. Please show any material stating otherwise. Golly."
2873177,BreezyPoint,2014-06-06 13:03:00,1581,"First of all, it was a nice video and great catch. Way too many boats for me though.Secondly, I think Tooski does raise an important point worth discussing and we should be knowledgeable on the topic. This is no reflection on the poster.I had a DNR biologist tell me that having a Muskie out of the water for a minute or more substantially raises the level of delayed mortality. He advised unhooking the fish in the net (in the water), keeping it there until the camera and camera operator were ready and then quickly lift the fish and take the photo followed by immediate release. He also told me to try holding my breath for a minute and a half. Many people would go unconscious by then. I couldn't make 1.5 minutes.This particular biologist had master's degrees in fisheries biology and cellular physiology and had studied the metabolism and oxygen requirements of muskies. Until he told me this I was totally unaware and very casual in my handling of fish to be released. The major point is that we should all endeavor to plan our handling of fish to be released and minimize time out of the water if we wish to minimize delayed mortality. After all what is the point of releasing a fish if we don't want to maximize its survival opportunity?Frank"
2873825,Curryale,2014-06-06 17:49:00,50,I enjoyed the video. Great fish. What did it weigh?
2874489,kzoofisher,2014-06-07 06:42:00,5144,"Nice video and great fish. Survival rates are better in cold water and after a short fight, still good to always be aware of stressing the fish. For those interested in improving the survival rate of released fish I'd recommend the Guide size Measurenet. The bag has a tape built into it so you don't even have to lift the fish out of the water to measure it, great for lakes with slots. It's rubber coated except for the ruler strip and so far I have had very little trouble with tangles, though I have not used it for pike. The bag is also deep enough that most fish can be handled in the water until you are ready for a picture. I've noticed fish roll less at boat side than they do in the bottom of the boat anyway and that helps with tangles, too. In some cases I have taken the pic in the net to show length. A drawback is that the maximum handle extension is about 45"", short for trolling but fine for jigging and casting cranks. Measures fish up to 40"". Widely available but these guys have a nice descriptive website.http://www.redsflyfishing.com/Measur...easure-net.htm"
2874697,keek,2014-06-07 09:19:00,1003,Great video! I thought your fish care was fine.
2875017,Jaskonie,2014-06-07 11:52:00,80,"Thanks for posting, I thought your timing was great. We had a young inexperienced father son with us one year. They caught a big 38""pike, after taking a few pics of the fish they put it back in the water held its tail and waited for her to swim away. Needless to say she bellied up later that day not far from the spot she was caught. That fish had fought a long time and just being out of the water 1 min or so was the icing on the cake! Its part of the sport, its gonna happen, if you don't want to be part of it you should find another hobby."
2870433,Knoxabilly,2014-06-05 13:58:00,225,"First cast of the day- all captured on my buddies gopro- pretty amazing stuff. I had never caught large fish here until this year, I caught a 28 here, this 30"" in video and probably 5 others that were 24-27""! Cool stuff, can't wait to go back! It's one of those moments that wold seem like a fish story if I didn't have this video evidence.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfh3Lrr585o"
2870465,Fishin Fun,2014-06-05 14:06:00,218,Wow that's a nice fish. Hard to beat that. Heck of a way to start off your season though. Congrats!
2870473,Jwendt15,2014-06-05 14:08:00,72,"Nice! How did you mount the go pro? I have never been able to get a good, steady shot while fishing. That was a great video. Heading there this weekend, can't wait."
2870705,Knoxabilly,2014-06-05 15:24:00,225,"He had a chest mount, it goes around both your shoulders and buckles. Camera is mounted in front of your chest- works slick. I want one!"
2870897,tooski,2014-06-05 16:27:00,393,"So you had the fish out of water for a minute and a half to photo and weigh it... To each his own I guess. I suppose you think it will be fine upon release? Maybe... Not a personal attack, I just think fishermen as a whole could re-think their position on fish shows. Get your video/pix and put it back in or better yet don't bother if it's not going on the plate."
2871057,Redline,2014-06-05 18:13:00,73,Really? That wasn't that bad.
2871569,bassnblast,2014-06-05 20:26:00,56,Not that bad at all. Great fish and cool video -- congrats!
2871737,tooski,2014-06-05 21:10:00,393,I have been scolded privately... It was pointed out that the water was likely very cold and thus easier on the fish. Probably true. My apologies...
2872289,MrSimon,2014-06-06 06:33:00,922,"Awesome fish and fun video. Thanks for sharing. But good grief, that's a lot of boats."
2872321,SinOrSwim,2014-06-06 06:39:00,1528,A minute and a half is long? lol I guess any fish I have ever taken a picture of has potentially died. The good news is I haven't taken very many the last few years. Nothing big enough to warrant a picture. Nice fish and cool video!!!
