2801257,grapestomper,2014-05-16 07:42:00,41,49I act much younger though.
2801305,KSjim,2014-05-16 07:52:00,88,58. First trip to Canada when I was 41. Have not missed a year since.
2801401,Mike Kansas,2014-05-16 08:19:00,1463,I will be 69 in July. First trip to Canada was in 1955. Headed for Lac Seul twice this year and to Wisconsin in July with my wife and Grandson. Mike Kansas
2801457,Guest,2014-05-16 08:29:00,0,"60 , have been going 29 straight years . If you didn't know how old you are , how old would you be ?"
2801465,Golden Eagle,2014-05-16 08:30:00,2642,"We've had several youngsters in our cabin for walleye openers in past years, but they are finding other things to do. This May the youngest is 59 and he's a whole lot younger than the rest of us. I missed out on early fishing trips to Ontario with my parents due to playing baseball. Made my first trip to North Channel in 1959 at age 25. Was hooked deeply and returned for a 7 weeks stay June 1960."
2801473,MrSimon,2014-05-16 08:31:00,922,"I'm 36 and I completely agree with you. Outside of my group of buddies, I don't personally know ANYONE under the age of 55 that takes fishing trips , let alone to Canada. And if I didn't plan our trips, I don't think my buddies would go. I've also noticed that I don't see kids and teenagers fishing for trout in the local streams like I used to. Its a shame."
2801561,Flip Silverlake,2014-05-16 08:42:00,645,"I'm 64 been fishing the same area of Lake Of The Woods since 1962. Now have my own place and spend the summers. With this cold and damp weather we've been having I'm not sure about this year due to arthritis, not even sure I could hold a fishing rod."
2801569,Gregking,2014-05-16 08:46:00,2658,"43 I believe. I fish with my dad 80, brothers 61 and 57, nephews 39,37,36 friends 44-25. Most of my friends are all younger than me From 25-40 so maybe that's why I think I'm younger than I am. Lol"
2801593,IaDave,2014-05-16 08:50:00,476,59- hip & knee joints 69-brain 39. That's a big problem sometimes.
