2859193,Walleye Wanderer,2014-06-02 18:10:00,101,"Hey RapShad, I travel approx. 16 hrs in the car with a flat (500) each year using a styrofoam cooler I picked up from the worm wholesaler. It is very similar to the Frabill Habitat V which I am sure would work for the long trip. I agree with others about the ""crawler can"" or the Plano ""Worm Lodge"" and I have one of each for the boat. They work great and keep the worms cool and contained and even if they get soaked in a downpour they don't end up in the bottom of the boat. They are easy to open and close and can be tossed to your boat mate without any fear of them opening or sinking should you have bad aim! Cheers WW"
2859993,jstoudt,2014-06-02 21:22:00,9,"Forget about the Styrofoam cooler and buy a small cooler with built in cooler pads. I also put a small flexible cooler pad in the bottom if used for more than one day. Works great, just empty the crawlers back into a crawler farm Styrofoam box each night then back into the small cooler during the day. Use crawler bedding in each and feed the crawlers every couple of days and they will grow and stay healthy for months. Good luck."
2860745,baitman,2014-06-03 07:33:00,4,"Word to the wize on the ice water. It works great and force feeds the worms so they get big and firm but there must always be ice in the water once it warms they over feed and get mushy, you must keep ice in at all times."
2861753,Guest,2014-06-03 11:11:00,0,Try the keep cool live bait box available at cabelas or hagens best thing going
2864233,Walleye Wanderer,2014-06-03 21:19:00,101,Great tip
2864265,adempsey,2014-06-03 21:27:00,963,"Those Keep Kool containers look good, but I bet you could easily make your own using one of the hard sided plastic coolers. Just stick a smaller container inside of it or glue one in."
2865961,cuamb,2014-06-04 10:17:00,203,"Thanks, I will give it a try."
2866273,JayM5209,2014-06-04 11:15:00,1050,"Just an F.Y.I. Our group of six just returned from our annual trip and all six of us had decided to quit buying the styrofoam/rubber band boxes for in the boat. Turns out three of the guys brought Frabil Crawler Cans and three of us brought Plano Worm and Leech Lodges. The guys with the Frabil Cans were pleased with them. The three of us with the Plano Lodges spent a lot of time in the boats using words we don't normally utter in polite company. Whoever manufactures those things for Plano is off about 1/2"" on their tolerances! They often (read usually) are impossible to close and, if you get it closed, to open. Absolute junk."
2869129,adempsey,2014-06-05 08:01:00,963,"Out of curiosity, did you soak the cabin in water before adding the worms?"
2871417,JayM5209,2014-06-05 20:05:00,1050,"We didn't use a Cabin, just the Cans. We keep the flat of crawlers in a cooler with an ice pack changed daily. Sorry I can't help with your question."
2846897,cuamb,2014-05-29 20:25:00,203,We use an old metal cooler for keeping the crawlers fresh at camp. Make sure we change the ice pack every day. I also use the crawler cabin in the boat but the locks get plugged easy. I found 2 of the old style with the green metal frame at a thrift sale last year. They are awesome.
2850785,MikeinMN,2014-05-31 00:05:00,190,"If you are asking about keeping 1 fishing day of crawlers in the boat try any 1/2 gallon or so container with a good lid full of icewater. No dirt, no bedding, just crawlers, ice, and some water. Keeps the boat and hands clean, and the worms do great for a day or so. Keep most of the worms at the cabin in bedding and take a days worth in icewater."
2853441,cuamb,2014-06-01 06:06:00,203,Do you put the crawlers right in the ice water? I agree with the mess you get with the bedding all over the boat. This would solve that.
2853513,octanehi5,2014-06-01 06:29:00,1104,"Some outfitters have worm pits in the shady areas near the cabins, Most worms in numbers are shipped in styrofoam, with a ice pac, to keep them lively, change the ice pacs dayly, wrap them in news paper to absorb the condensation so worms do not drown.A small soft sided cooler will keep worms cold as well as a few Beers"
2853817,jimirjr,2014-06-01 08:01:00,1149,"I went to Our local Supermarket pharmacy and asked for a ""medical drug shipping container""... These are usually made of styrofoam and are approx. 12""x 14""x 12"" with a cover.. fill with bedding, worms, and place into a larger cooler with ice... Fresh crawlers all week..."
2855577,MikeinMN,2014-06-01 19:14:00,190,"cuamb, I do put the crawlers right in the icewater, no dirt or bedding of any kind, just worms and icewater. My brother in law showed me this way and I was skeptical the worms would get waterlogged but they stay in great shape for at least a day. I never tried to keep them like this any longer than one day so I don't really know what they could tolerate."
2857697,btmbncr,2014-06-02 11:14:00,492,I tried a small plastic cooler for crawlers 2 years ago.It kept the crawlers too wet.I went back to a Frabill Crawler Cabin.It has worked best for me over the years.Bill
2858729,10lbeye,2014-06-02 15:35:00,61,"ADempsey is on the $$. I have both the small crawler cabin (which I love) and I also recently bought the new cylindrical yellow container. Have not used it yet, but a potential problem as i see it is that you have to freeze a small malleable freezer pack just right just to fit it in the bottom screw off portion. The crawler cabin will hold a small solid blue ice pack and about 5 doz crawlers no problem. I also have a larger Frabill bait box that will hold half a flat of worms. I finally got smart and keep them in the camp fridge all week. No need to constantly change out ice packs on the porch. It's the 1st thing that goes in the fridge when we unpack, even before the meat,eggs, etc, and even the beer. My wife would not approve of mixing bait and food in the same fridge, but my grizzled gang doesn't seem to mind! Priorities, priorities......"
2858785,Carnhzkr,2014-06-02 15:49:00,964,"A word of caution about putting your whole container of worms in the fridge. I did this one time and the fridge must have been set a little too cold, or maybe I had the worm container in the coldest spot of the fridge. In any event, I froze about half of my supply. Since that incident, I've kept mine outside the fridge in a cheapie Styrofoam cooler and change the ice frequently."
2859033,BAMBAM,2014-06-02 17:32:00,154,JKWILDHINTING: I agree with you 100%. This is the best worm cooler I have ever used. I buy twice as many small freezer packs as I need so that I can exchange out every day with a new set of frozen packs. this box cleans out easy and never makes a mess. BAM
2843049,RapShad,2014-05-28 20:08:00,76,"Hey guys, my dad and I are heading up on annual trip to Sioux Lookout in a few weeks and we face the same thing every year. Whether to revive the nasty styrofoam crawler holders or buy new ones. We both hate the classic design that holds two sides together with an elastic band. It always falls apart and dirt gets all over the boat or worms escape, die and stink up the boat. Just wondering if anyone knows a good design or if we should continue with old design."
2843073,jkwildhunting,2014-05-28 20:14:00,361,This is my new favorite crawler tote....Its big but it's worth every penny.I use ice packs actually they are small bags found at wally world for under a dollar. I put 6 of them in there and most times unless it is extremly hot those last all day long at end day i put ice in freezer and crawlers go in the fridge. A small lunch pale will work good to but I like the keep kool container alot better as you can have ice packs on outside.
2843449,adempsey,2014-05-28 22:02:00,963,"The Frabill Crawler Can looks good to me. Frabill also makes the Crawler Cabin might be a good alternative. I still use the ""elastic"" two cover holder and I've used a small lunch cooler as well."
2844089,Sportfisher,2014-05-29 07:23:00,47,"I use the crawler cabin. Works well. I have now gotten the other boats in our group to use crawler cabins. I put a chunk of ice in in the morning with the crawlers and go out for the day. When I get back in the evening, I put any leftovers back in the Styrofoam box (from Vados, Canada Pack) in the fridge. At the end of the week, I wash it out with a hose, and put it in the truck. It is dry by the time I get back home. Been using the same cabin for the last four years, and it is leaving on trip 5 in 16 days!"
2844249,tv4fish,2014-05-29 07:47:00,2694,"Hi Rapshad We use a small beverage cooler for when we have the crawlers in the boat - you know - one with a hinged lid that allows you to close the cover. We keep the styrofoam one (the one that we get the crawlers in) back in the fridge in the cabin. We never take ALL of the crawlers in the boat, we take enough to make sure they will last the day. We also use the re-freezable ice packs in the small cooler. We put a layer of newspaper on top of the crawlers and then an ice pack on top of that. It works pretty well to keep the ""mess"" down.(You guys have a safe trip and we will see you on the 21st)."
2844321,Hot Runr Guy,2014-05-29 08:00:00,16061,"we use the Frabill crawler can (above), and found a small tupperware-type container that we fill with water and freeze overnight, and put the ice block in the bottom half to keep 'em cool all day long. HRG"
2844449,KurtG,2014-05-29 08:25:00,259,I use a little hard side cooler from Walmart http://tinyurl.com/mbu2m8j The lid has an internal hinge so the top does not come off. I put a ice pack http://tinyurl.com/lrm3h5j in the bottom and cover with a sponge then a deep layer of shredded damp sponge. Rinse the crawlers and put into the cooler (I dont like the messy worm dirt all over the boat). Usually take 6 -8 dozen the ice block keeps it cool all day and the crawlers frisky.
2844489,Pezman38,2014-05-29 08:31:00,3196,"+1 Got tired of stepping on the Styrofoam versions, I also add a blue ice pack in a ziplock to keep them cool."
2844825,adempsey,2014-05-29 10:04:00,963,"Just a side note, the hard sided lunch coolers (which I also use) I purchased at a thrift store for $2. I now have more than I need, lol. I actually see them there quite often."
2846617,Bad Santa,2014-05-29 19:03:00,100,"We use 2 crawler cabins for primary transport, and the can for daily use. fill top with crawlers, and bottom with ice. good for the whole day."
