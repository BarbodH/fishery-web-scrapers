These measures include changes to recreational fishing regulations and tocommercial fishing licence conditions for 2002. When the walleye season openson May 4 there will be a maximum size limit of 19 inches for recreationalfishing, and anglers will be allowed one trophy walleye over 25 inches.Anglers with sportfishing licences will have a limit of four walleye and theconservation limit of two fish will be maintained. Recreational fishing seasondates remain the same. ""This angling regulation change reflects the valuable input that wereceived this past winter from groups such as the Citizens Against the WalleyeMoratorium, the Town of Greater Napanee and the Ontario Federation of Anglersand Hunters,"" said Natural Resources Minister John Snobelen. ""This is a localsolution to a regional issue, and it's our hope that these measures will helpensure stronger walleye populations in the Bay of Quinte now and in thefuture."" The Ministry of Natural Resources is also helping to implement a localadvisory council to assist with long-term planning for the fisheries in thearea as recommended by members of the public. The members of the advisorycouncil will be determined this spring following consultation with localstakeholders. The province's decision was made following significant publicconsultation meetings attended by approximately 300 Quinte-area residents,municipal leaders, anglers, and tourism operators in February 2002. Inaddition, the ministry also received comments from an Environmental Bill ofRights registry posting, correspondence, and discussions with stakeholders.The government took all public input into account in making its decision andremains committed to consulting with local residents on any future measures toprotect the Bay of Quinte's walleye population. The Ministry of Natural Resources continues to seek dialogue with theMohawks of the Bay of Quinte."

Indeed, one could hardly be blamed for categorizing this latest MNR solution to the BOQ walleye crisis as ""complete stupidity"".Establishing new harvest regulations for the recreational fisher addresses less than 30 % of the annual BOQ walleye harvest by fish numbers, and about 10 % of the annual biomass harvest. 70 % of the annual BOQ walleye harvest (about 90% of the annual biomass harvest) attributable to Aboriginal fishing (both legal and illegal) has been left unaddressed! Dah!I contacted Ontario politicians (all persuasions) months ago in this regard and none have dared to respond. It would appear that ""gutlessness"" exists in epidemic proportions."
