518620,Guest,2002-03-27 15:21:00,0,"I used to live in Kentucky until 1981. Caught my first W in June, 81. My former boss in KY who is now 76 has come up to fish Canada 17 years in a row and he's going to make it 18 this year. He tells me that when he's 96 he'll retire from fishing. He never caught a fish until that first trip when he was 59 years old. I do feel lucky to live so close. I've given up many opportunities to move up professionally and in $$$$$, but I wouldn't want to think what fun I would have missed over the years. TGG"
518625,bellbuoy,2002-03-28 04:37:00,490,"I'm 46 and have been 24 times, not bad since I live in Indianapolis. 19 of those we had to drive thru IL (Chicago traffic & tolls were the pits -- now take I-74 to I-39), WI, & MN, I'm glad 53 is four lanes between Eau Claire & Superior now. Now, if we can only get it that way all the way International Falls...... Bellbuoy"
518626,Guest,2002-03-28 07:48:00,0,Construction to 4-lane 53 from Virginia to I-Falls starts this year. They will be doing Virginia to Cook first. The whole distance should be complete by 2008. TGG
518627,Guest,2002-03-28 10:00:00,0,I am 32 years old and have been fishing in Canada ever since I was 7. In 24 years I've made 49 trips. My next trip is planned for June 2002 and it will be #50! Long live Hatterharry!
518621,Guest,2002-03-28 12:03:00,0,Have you ever ice fished on Lac Seul? I've had some great summer trips there but really like to try ice fishing it.
518628,ohdaddy,2002-04-05 17:18:00,21,"Wow, never thought about making 100 trips to fish Canada. Oustanding. I have been going since 1972, that would be 30 trips including this years may trip to Sioux Lookout, Ontario. Fished on 4 lakes in 9 different camps. The greatest part are all the memories. Fishing in Canada is special. So many people only get the chance once or twice, some never at all. We should all feel very fortunate to have fished in what I like to refer to as ""heaven"". Just my 2 cents......Brian"
518612,Dave,2002-03-26 08:43:00,258,There was an article in our local paper about an 85 year old fisherman who will be taking his 98th & 99th fishing trip to Canada this year. He hopes to go one more time next spring for #100. To me that is amazing. His first trip was in 1947. Can anybody top that?
518613,eyewitness,2002-03-26 09:12:00,680,I'm only 41. been to Ontario roughly 35 times already to about 6-8 different places. It's an addiction. No doubt I will see 100 trips by age 55 or sooner. Making more money now than I have in the past and once the daughter is done with school next year watch out Ontario! Of course I live in Minnesota.....
518614,Mean Mike,2002-03-26 14:12:00,115,20 trips so far. Now I got something to shoot for.
518615,Randy,2002-03-26 14:23:00,53,Been going to Canada since 1956. When my Dad was alive we went twice a year. He passed away in 1965 and since then I have gone at least twice a year and the last twenty years we have gone three times a bunch. Dont have a exact count but would estimate my 100th trip is not to far away. I figure at age 57 I have another 60 or so trips in me.
518616,Guest,2002-03-26 15:01:00,0,"I live in northern MN and over the last 20 years I've made 6 to 8 3 to 7 day trips per soft water season. So that would be between 120 and 160. I now make 2 to 3 ice fishing trips of 2 to 4 days. I'll be 50 this year and hopefully can keep it going for at least 20 to 30 more years so I would be up around 300 when the big net in the sky swoops down. The last I counted I've fished at least 50 different lakes. I fish Rainy, LOW and Lac Suel most often. TGG"
518617,Dave,2002-03-26 15:21:00,258,"Great Guide- That is great that you are that close,I would probably try to do the same if I lived up there. The guy in the article lives in central Iowa and he must of went once or twice a year since 1947. Can you imagine what it was like back then. He said his first trip to Northern Minn. was in 1929 when he was 14. They went somewhere not far from Fargo on gravel roads. It cost $3.00 a day for a cabin and a wooden boat and oars for the motor."
518618,Randy,2002-03-26 15:22:00,53,"Dear ""The Great Guide""....I take my hat off to you. I cant imagine how much fishing fun you have had hauling them hogs out of that soft water. I dont ice fish tried it once and it didnt trip my bail. May you always have a full miinnow bucket and may your fillets always be fresh......YOU THE MAN!!!!"
518619,Thumper,2002-03-26 16:00:00,133,"I'll give you something to shoot for Great Guide....My Dads 91 this year and still goes. Not as active as he was at 80 but still a force on the water. His saying....""You have to keep moving, If you stop thats when life catches up with you"""
518622,Bucks Rogers,2002-03-26 19:28:00,43,"I live in Sault Ste. Marie so I have an advantage. Been fishing in Canada since 1974. Make 6 to 8 trips every summer and 6 to 8 trips every winter to inland lakes. Also fish the Canadian side of St Marys River many times in the summer. Went quite a few years where I didn't even buy a Michigan license, only fished in Canada. Quess I'm blessed."
518623,Guest,2002-03-27 12:26:00,0,"never counted before...let me think i'm 37 so that would make 32 trips in 37 years, counting the ones my parents took me on."
