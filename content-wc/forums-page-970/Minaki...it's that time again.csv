518964,Guest,2002-04-04 18:10:00,0,"I live in Wisconsin on a Lake, Last year ice out was March 23. This year we still have ice on the pond, and I would predict it to be off on April 11-13. Canada is normally a month after that. So I think Rainy and Nuker are pretty close on their estimates. Mike S."

518966,Guest,2002-04-05 11:22:00,0,"I'm no expert and this is just what I think after many a year chasing walleye. It depends on what kind of weather follows the ice. If it stays cold then the water warms up slowly and the W's spawn gets messed up. That results in the fish being in all sorts of patterns, post spawn shutdown, active fish in the shallows and fish all over the lake moving to summer haunts. These conditions can last for weeks. If the fish are scattered, they get hard to track down. If is is warm then the fish resume thier normal patterns, but are delayed a week or two. TGG"
