518898,RoyC,2002-04-04 09:46:00,274,"Oh boy, now we have a guest user that wants to cloud these issues with facts! I did a little web browsing and found several web sites about this also. The best one is http://www.wohlmut.com/beer/morebeer.htmlIt discusses the % weight vs. volume issue between the U.S. and Canada and has a table of alcohol contents by weight and volume for various U.S. and Canadian beers. All of the standard beers (Bud, Pabst, LaBatt's 50, Molson Ale) are right around 4% by weight, 5% by volume. I admit that there are some Canadian beers that are significantly strong, but there are stronger U.S. ""beers"" also, but we call them Malt Liquors.My web research also confirmed (to me at least) that listing alcohol content on beer was made illegal in a 1935 federal law to prevent ""Strength Wars"". States (Michigan?) with laws requiring alcohol content labeling are excluded. This law was repealed in 1992, but most beer companies appear to still follow it. Oddly enough, the 1935 law required that alcohol content must be shown on all other alcoholic beverages. Go figure.Anyway, if you anyone can show me any resources indicating that Canadian beer is generally stronger than U.S. beer (don't be comparing our 3.2 stuff to your ""malt liquors""!), I would be happy to buy them a beer or two (after a good day of fishing)!My favorite beer is Blue (Pabst in the U.S. and Labatt's when in Canada)!"

My favourite beer is American Budweiser. Don't know why but it seems to taste best to me. Can't wait to go back to the states to have me some...Kroe"

I like all kinds, but my favourite are Blue, Two Rivers (brewed in Winnipeg), Labatt genuine draft, Rickards Red (molson), Molson Dry, Moosehead, Kokanee, Alexander Keiths, and a bunch of others. The only thing I don't really like is guinness, havn't aquired a taste for it yet.Being a guide in the summer, I've learned to like any and all beer my american guests offer me."

Anyway, because they don't sell a lot of those beers in the states how does Labatt Genuine Draft compare to Blue or Crystal because I like draft beer. I know that the American version of Labatt Blue Lite is not the same beer you buy in Canada, and I did not know that the Canadian version of Bud was different."
518893,bigfish1965,2002-04-03 23:16:00,3210,"Actually, I find Miller Genuine Draft to be a very good American beer. But for choice, I like Sleemans, Keiths, and the occasional Labbats Ice Beer.If you are ever in Niagara Falls, they have a micro brewery that made the very first ice beer and make some other oustanding ales, lagers and bochs."
518894,RoyC,2002-04-04 06:04:00,274,"Red: I don't think that the whole world has responded to this thread yet ;-)As for the news article about the drunken American soldier, I saw an early similar case on the web (perhaps it was the same one), but it was at that trial where there was ""expert"" testimony that the alcohol content only appears different due to the different ways that it is measured in the two countries.As for Michigan displaying 5% by volume on their beer cans, did that can come from Canada? I have never seen an alcohol content on a U.S. beer can (unless it is 3.2 beer).And as for the observation of the guy drinking the U.S. 12 pack vs. the Canadian 12 pack, I suppose that there are certain beers within either country that are stronger than others, but I still doubt that beers in Canada are generally stronger than in the U.S. I would guess that in many cases, if you think a particular beer is stronger, you will act like it when you drink it ;-)And please don't feel that I am an American that is being defensive about the alcohol content of U.S. beer. As I mentioned before, I like watered down beer in terms of taste, and that also applies to alcohol. I get more than enough buzz from any beer."

If I can't tell after a couple of each, then I'm in trouble.Generally though, the flavour isn't as pronounced as in Blue, but not quite as smooth as budweiser."

518881,Guest,2002-04-03 15:01:00,0,"Thumper, I heard that before and I tried triple X last spring while in Canada and I was not impressed by the taste or its strength. If I want a good tasting beer I'll have a Guinness and if I want a strong beer I'll take a Dogfishhead. I think Molson XXX is very over-rated, but thats only my opinion."
518883,Red Ruffandsore,2002-04-03 15:27:00,81,"RoyC - I don't think that you are right and everyone else in the world is wrong. ""Normal"" U.S. beer is 2.5% to 4% and ""normal"" Canadian is 4% to 5%. The Canadian rating refers to ""being at least that percentage"". God help you with the 8.2% beers (that's about a 3:1 ratio)If American beer and Canadian beer is virtually the same as you imply, why is it that I have witnessed many an American brought down by a twelve pack of Canadian beer, yet regularily drink 12 American beers with much less of an effect.As for taste and aroma, any of the major brands have NONE. Micro breweries are far superior. But the absolute best beer in the world is a well done homebrew. I do not brew high test beer. I aim for 4%, but the flavour in my German pilsner makes any storebought beer taste like tapwater. I brew at a local brew-your-own and once you brew your own it hurts to drink mainstream beer. I also buy from a microbrewery by the name of Robinson's. Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red"
518884,srj,2002-04-03 15:45:00,971,"RoyC, sometime try Labatts Maximum Ice. But don't try too many. Or too fast. It sorta acts like canned liquor. But it does taste good."
518885,River_eye,2002-04-03 16:49:00,1486,I've tried American Budweiser and it doesn't compare to the Canadian Budweiser. It's like it was meant to be brewed in Canada.Please tell me which American beers are 5% alcohol. I'd like to know. Why don't they have it printed on the can?
518882,Guest,2002-04-03 17:11:00,0,"Reuters) - A U.S. soldier fined in Canada for resisting arrest and insulting the police blamed high-alcohol Canadian beer for his disorderly conduct, a police spokesman says.Army cook Jason Dalgai from Flagstaff Arizona pleaded guilty to causing a disturbance and assaulting a police officer and was fined C$375, said Kingston, Ontario, police spokesman Mike Weaver.The 24-year-old soldier told the court on Tuesday that he was not used to Canadian beer, which has higher alcohol content than American beer. He struggled with officers and was arrested only after local police brought their Canine Unit in to help.``It's like a deterrent. If talking doesn't help, sometimes a barking dog on the end of a leash can bring someone to their senses,'' Weaver said Wednesday.Most American beers contain between three and five percent alcohol content while Canadian beers contain as much as seven percent alcohol.He He He....Talk the Talk but not walking the walk"

Never been much for the micro brews and have tried many - guess I have no taste.Anyhow, I am looking at a Budweiser can right now and it says 5% alc/vol - I know that the Anheuser Busch products are labeled this way in Michigan can't speak for other brands or states.lobo"
518868,RoyC,2002-04-02 13:03:00,274,"After the flood of response on the ""How much beer do you bring to Canada"", I want to start an even hotter topic. In my opinion (and these are definitely opinions) there is no more difference between U.S. and Canadian beers than there is between different U.S. beers or different Canadian beers! Therefore, I definitely bring all of the U.S. beer that I legally can, and only buy the high-priced Canadian stuff if I have to. The notion that Canadian beer is stronger than U.S. beer is another myth!Let the battle begin . . ."
518869,Guest,2002-04-02 13:31:00,0,"I find that the very best beers are microbrews from all over the world not just North America. Dogfish Head (made in Deleware) is excellent and if you want a brew with a kick try Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Ale (or just about any barley wine). Another great beer to try is Guinness Draught in a bottle, it is one of the smoothest, richest beers I have ever had (it's worht the price). Canada has some great beers as does the U.S. but if you want a quality brew stay away from the commons (Bud, Miller, Coors etc...) and try some micro brews.Drink what you drink becasue you enjoy the taste not because it's American or Canadian."
518870,Peanut,2002-04-02 13:31:00,929,"If you mean strong as in strong-tasting, I don't know, you may be right (although I'd still bet Canadian micro-brew brands are stronger flavored than most US beer). If you mean strong as in alcohol content, then sorry, but very little to battle over. The higher percentage of alcohol content in most Canadian beer is beyond dispute. Some US beer meet the ""normal"" Canadian levels of 4% or 5%, but I know of none that get up into the 7%-8% range that our local high-test reaches. Other than ""near-beer"", Canada has no brands in the 2-3.5% range, where so many cheaper US brands lie.Not a knock on either one - I drink Cdn. made Coors Light myself (4%). And, it's your money, so buy what you like, not what has the most alcohol in it (unless this is what you're looking for). derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"

518873,Thumper,2002-04-02 15:37:00,133,"You're right Roy. A lot of the mass produced beers are a thin,watery, underhopped brew and they taste the same.It is that way because most of the masses like it that way.

It does everything from ingredients to brewing to country drinking habits. http://www.protzonbeer.com/If you're visiting ontario and can get to an LCBO store they are getting big time into world brews.

518877,RoyC,2002-04-03 06:23:00,274,"I was curious on what reaction I would get when discussing the ""quality"" of beer rather than ""quantity"" as in the previous beer topic on ""how much beer do you bring to Canada"". In my opinion, arguing about taste is a pure waste of time since it is purely a personal preference. I tend to like beer that most people think ""tastes like water"", but then, I like water also.But the alcohol content issue is a different matter. I have heard numerous people claim that Canadian beer is stronger (higher alcohol content) then U.S. beer, even for the same brands. I have drank considerable quantities of various brands of beer in both countries, and honestly cannot tell the difference. One of the reasons for this myth is that alcohol content is commonly expressed as percent by volume in Canada and percent by weight in the U.S. Since alcohol is considerably lighter than water, the same content in Canada results in a higher number than in the U.S. Another reason for this myth is that there are places in the U.S., particularly Minnesota, that allow the sale of ""weak"" beer (3.2% alcohol) at certain times and places (typically Sundays and at groceries) when ""normal"" beer cannot be sold. This myth is even further compounded by the fact that in the U.S., it is illegal to list the alcohol content on the label for ""normal"" beer. So unless you are drinking 3.2 beer, you cannot be certain as to the alcohol content. As with many laws, I am not sure why this one exists, but I heard that it was created in order to prevent beer brewers from competing with each other on alcohol content. The law doesn't apply to other alcoholic beverages, which is why you see Malt Liquor in the U.S.: it is just beer that is not called beer and thus can have the alcohol content listed on the label.If I were younger, I would challenge you naysayers to a beer drinking contest where I drink Canadian beer and you drink U.S. beer (and I wouldn't really care who won anyway.)Anyway, something to argue about the next time you go fishing in Canada. And one indisputable fact is that U.S. beer is cheaper than Canadian!"
