I have spent a lot of time on the web lately and one thing I have learned that the more specific you are, the better quality results. If you are going up through International Falls and plan to fish that area. Then search northwestern ontario fishing (lodges, resorts, reports etc.) Lot better stuff comes up in that area. Takes all that stuff over at Toronto area out of it."
