We have caught Pike, Walleye( Pickeral to the locals LOL), Smallies, Crappie, Largemouth, and Muskie. We stay at Sunset Pointe on Moon River Bay. We have fished from the falls out to Georgian Bay and always discover new areas to fish. I know it will be hard to believe but my oldest brother who is from Colorado caught a 78 lb Muskie back in 95. We have pics showing this monster. Unfortunatly it was caught 2 weeks before the season opened so back she went. I know where Ken Obrian`s whopper was caught too. If it is your fist time there don`t get lost and watch out for rocks. I hit a new one every year the first few years. Fishing can be slow at times but the scenery makes up for it.Good luck and post how you do."

I got here from a link at that site, but I did not find a return link..........You will be packing your bags in the morning. Dave"
