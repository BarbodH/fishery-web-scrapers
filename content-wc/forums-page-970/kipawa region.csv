You have to watch out for large hiddenrocks on some of the lakes. If you let me know whatpart of the lakes you will be staying at I may be ableto help you more, are you taking your own boat, or areyou going to rent one?"

Fish mostly for walleye, but have landed some big pike also...though those are not as abundant as walleye and lake trout. Caught a lake trout last year while fishing for walleye...great fight and action will ensure that I fish for them more this year. We stay near the center of the lake, so I'm not as familiar with the Kipawa area or the Laniel areas of the lake. If you're going around the center of the lake, let me know and I'll share some key locations with you."
