518950,Guest,2002-04-04 08:23:00,0,"Kahty go to www.fivelakeslodge.com me and my wife fish there and she out fishes me alot. My meaning there is fish are easy to catch, the place is outstanding there are 5 lakes you can fish right from the dock all varying in size and you do not need a guide the owner goes out of his way to put you on fish."
518951,eyewitness,2002-04-04 10:14:00,680,"Just do a look up on Lac Seul. There are a lot of places to go some better, some worse. All good fishing. My sis and brother in-law went to Lost Island and said the guide they had was great. Sis got a 10 lber and many other big walleyes to boot."
518952,Jigger1,2002-04-04 11:38:00,234,"Kathy,My standard recommendation is Silver Water Wheel Lodge on LacSeul. Great guides, great fishing and a shore lunch that is out of this world! They have ultra clean cabins and a fantastic staff. The only problem is finding a spot in 2002. Check them out on the web at www.sww-lodge.com and then give Mike a call.Jigger1"
518954,RCKC,2002-04-05 09:21:00,14,"I'm heading up from KC on the 30th of May. Paradise Cove in Minaki is a great place to go. Cheap, easy drive-in camp, and great fishing. Where are you from in KC. Oh yey, it's a 15 hour drive from Kansas City"
518953,NateW,2002-04-05 10:43:00,96,"We go to Scout Lake Resort, which is connected to Lac Seul. It's nice being on a smaller lake connect to the big lake because there are some nasty windy days when Lac Seul is really rough. At least hre you can fish the smaller lake. Plus, if it's going to be an all-girls slumber party you might as well go to a camp run by a woman!www.fishlacseul.com/Great fishing...just ask to talk to Liz, she'll take care of you.Good Luck!"
518955,Guest,2002-04-06 16:09:00,0,"Not sure where you're traveling from Girls? But, I have a trip planned for June to a fishing honey hole north of Ignace, Ontario. I am traveling from Sioux Falls,SD and it is about 12 hours from here or 8 hours from Minn/St.Paul. I passed up on a resort that I might regret later, but here is a link to a resort that I recommmend. There are many people that I work with that have gone to this place in the last 5 years. http://www.whitepinelodge.ca/If you're traveling from the Chicago area, here is another great looking resort. It has everything that you're asking for:http://www.northshorelodgeontario.com/This outfit even buses you in!Later, Kevin"
518956,Guest,2002-04-06 20:08:00,0,"We are from Omaha and go to a lodge just north of Lac Suel. It is very remote and lots of peace & quiet. We found this lodge at the All Canada show in Omaha several years ago and have been returning ever since. The couple that own it are very nice and have a great bunch of college kids that guide during the summer and are wildlife biology student in the winter so they know alot neat stuff about the fish and plants and birds up there. It is a boat-in lodge on a big lake but not as big as Lac Suel, and they are the only ones there which makes it nice to be all alone on the lake. Food is great at the lodge or you can cook in the cabins yourself (we always do the food plan with guides) Not sure they would have any openings this year because they so many guests like us that come back each year but you can give them a try. www.southbaylodge.com Roger & Kay Osborne 1-877-934-7449 Oh, the fishing is great there too! We have caught giant fish every time we go there. Good Luck, JA"
518944,Guest,2002-04-07 08:55:00,0,"Not to further clutter this string but..... I worked/lived in Sioux Lookout for 16 years (main launching pad for Lac Seul) and have heard of few lakes/areas that compare for fishing. I would have to recommend Andersons' Lodge as one of the best run spots to stay. They offer guided trips up Lac Seul for the day in nice boats, shore lunch the whole gambit. The main lodge is located off the main highway into Sioux Lookout. Sioux Lookout is a 21 hour drive from Toronto so there will be some driving involved to get there. Lac Seul is best in May-June and again in Sept but you can catch all the fish you want throughout the summer. Buddies and myself pick mid-July as best chance for great weather and catch whacks of fish throughout the day. For a little more remoteness, check out Bamaji Lake, I believe this is run by Knobby's Flyin Camps (also out of Sioux Lookout). Again, well run and great fishing but will be a little more costly due to requirement to fly in. If you stay in Sioux Lookout, make sure you get a guide to take you lake trout fishing on Big Vermilion Lake and if you have time also try musky/huge smallmouth bass fishing in the Musky-Hooch Lake system. These lakes are all catch and release so offer some great action. Won't ramble any more, don't have phone numbers for these operators but if you go to Sioux Lookout-Hudson Tourism Association website, I'm sure everything will be there. Message back if you would like more info about Sioux Lookout area. Also worked in Chapleau area (much closer drive)for 3 years but fishing does not compare to further north."

What is wrong with us going to the lake you go to?? Unless you are afraid some girls might catch the Big Fish."

518937,Guest,2002-04-03 22:09:00,0,"Happy Landing is an excellent resort on an excellent area of Pipestone Lake. The guides have great access to many types of structure and species of fish to keep your interest. You may want to look at a place that has a resort on a lake but can also have a float plane take you to a days destination in case fishing on that particular body of water seems to be difficult. The nice thing about this Pipestone chain of lakes is there are also many short, managable portages to have access to other excellent fisheries.Fishin' Mortician 6 feet under!"

I won't reccomend it to you unless it's the type of place you're looking for."
518945,eyewitness,2002-04-03 23:16:00,680,"Absolutely nothing. I handle rejection well. Really. Or as said on SNL ""I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and dog gonnit, people like me."" :) Anyway, most lakes in Canada can be a little intimidating unless they are smaller flyin type lakes. I would seriously consider Lake Vermilion in Minnesota though. It is probably as much of an adventure as your looking for. Otherwise try Lost Island Lodge on Lac Suel. They have guides and nice boats and cabins. Lac Seul is the crown jewel of walleye fishing in Ontario. By the way, I can slumber with the best of them!"
518942,Big Tim,2002-04-04 04:47:00,63,"I just knew this string was going to head in this direction. If you do not mind cooking for yourselves, Try Lac Seul Lodge. Lac Seul is THE lake for Walleye. It is big, But if you gals are using a guide it should be fine. L.S.Lodge is clean, friendly & their new boats are sooooo nice."
518947,CanEye,2002-04-04 05:50:00,11,http://virtualnorth.com/holinshead/Holinshead Lake north of Thunder Bay is a great place. Only resort on the lake and access is limited to Resort guests. One of the best drive in lakes I have ever fished.
518943,Guest,2002-04-04 06:08:00,0,"More like the whole rod went over the side.......his post reminds me of the girls who did this ice fishing trip this year for a ""girl thing"" and every single male on the lake knew about it and ""offered to help"". At 2:00 in the morning guys were still showing up ""offering to help"" All the girls wanted to do was icefish and they had to put up with many ""trolling passes"" in the hopes of a bite or nibble."
518948,Guest,2002-04-04 06:49:00,0,"Wow...I want to thank all of you for your guidance in helping us find the right place. We have looked at the map of Ontario and it appears that lac Seul is a large lake but according to several of you the fishing is first class. If someone could suggest a Lodge on lac Seul that we can cook at and hire Guides to find the fish for us we would be very apprecitive. It would be great if you could also help us with cost estimates,best time to go and fishing equipment suggestions. Thanks a bunch guys. We are just four nurses looking for a good time fishing. Thanks again...Kathy and Girls."
518928,Guest,2002-04-03 14:43:00,0,Me and my three girlfriends want to go to Canada and try our lady luck at catching Walleyes. We would appreciate it if a few of you guys that know where to catch fish at would give us some direction. We would like to stay someplace in Ontario that is clean and a place that we dont have to travel to far in a boat to catch some fish. We are thinking that we should go some place that has Guides who could make our trip a fishing adventure to remember. We have some experience fihing and running a boat but we dont want to get ourselves in the deepest darkest part of Canada and get lost. Hope some of you can help.

About 30 miles outside of Peterboro, it is inexpensive, not too remote and has other great stuff to do if the fish or weather is not cooperating. A tip...rent one of the waterfront Motel units...very nice."

518938,eyewitness,2002-04-03 20:15:00,680,"When are you going to make this journey? There are plenty of places in Northern Mn. in the first part of summer that are just as beautiful, have excellent fishing (you want a guide anyway), and will allow you the luxury of staying in a nice place. May I suggest Lake Vermillion? It's on the edge of the boundary waters, but larger boats are permitted. It is very scenic as well. The walleye bite is great, and there are huge muskies and pike as well. There are many very nice resorts as well as a new hotel casino right on the lake which has everything. Time of year is key though in relation to where you should stay whether in Canada or Minn. If you need a good guide with a nice boat who will travel to where ever you want to go. I'm your man. Heck, if your sociable and fun, I might just work for cost of travel just to get out. I go to Lac Suel in Canada quite a bit and have some serious honey holes for walleyes there. In fact how about two good looking single professional guys with nice boats that will travel. What more would you want out of a guide service? All kidding aside, I'd probably consider it cause I go anyhow. Drop me an email and I can send more details if you want. I even clean and cook fish for free!"
