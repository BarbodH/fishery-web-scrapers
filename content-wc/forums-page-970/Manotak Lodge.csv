519026,russb,2002-04-07 17:02:00,4,We are going to Manotak Lodge on Perrault Lake this coming September (2nd week of the month) and am wondering if anyone can tell me how the fishing is there? What baits work the best? Locations or landmarks that would be a good place to try?Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.
