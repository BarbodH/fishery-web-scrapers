518259,PJM,2002-03-17 20:50:00,3516,pfg1 Where is the outpost camp you are staying at on the lake?
518261,Guest,2002-03-18 06:23:00,0,Lac is a good producer and you will catch lots of fish. Bugs can be a problem in some wet years so you should be prepared. On many of the productive lakes in NW Ontario many peoplw will stay on small fish and beat up on them...my advice..If you are on small fish take some and then move on and don't be afraid to try deeper water.
518262,Wenty,2002-03-18 07:13:00,15,"LDML is a good sized body of water, so if you tell me where you and your son are staying, I'll be able to help you out. But I've got the same questions as PJM, ""where is the outpost camp on LDML""?"
518263,tracker,2002-03-18 07:15:00,91,He is probably staying at the outpost in Baril Bay. The only other one is on Fisherman's Island.
518265,PJM,2002-03-18 07:18:00,3516,THUMPER You seem to know alot about this lake and I do fish it one week a year in July. The question I have is when you say deeper how deep do you mean. At that time of the year it seem like we are getting most of our fish in 17 to 23 feet. I fish Bolton on that reef that is in the middle of the bay and there is a small island by it and the depths on that are all over the place from 7 to 40 feet. I do know that when you pull deep diving cranks over it that are some very large Northerns on it. Any other suggestion on the lake for bigger fish

518266,Guest,2002-04-08 10:32:00,0,"Thunderbird resort is actually on cushing lake which is attached to lac des mille lacs. I go out of pine point resort which is centrally located on the lake and a few miles down the road from the thunderbird. Altough I have never been up there by boat, it is a long haul to where I fish, and the map shows it to be a shallower area (12-14""ave) Sorry this not more help, the thunderbird has a website that shows where you'll on the lake. PJM: Last year you gave me the fishing report before I went up in august last year, much appreciated, eventhough I've been going for 15yrs every little bit helps to get on the fish sooner. If your in bolten and the fish are a little shallower try the shoreline to your right as you enter bolton bay, just past the sandy beach area (don't fish the corner)start just past it and work that to the small Island we do ok there for nice ones>(2-3lbs)If I can be any help my E-mail is [email protected]"
