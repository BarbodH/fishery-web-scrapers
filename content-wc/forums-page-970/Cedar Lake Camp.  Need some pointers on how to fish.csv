Generally small Rapala's, ect. that imitate crawfish will catch small mouth in clear water, which Cedar Lake is, and variuos weedless jigs in weed beds. It's hard to beat trolling a chartrous spinner and a minnow to locate walleye, then jigs and minnows. There are a million ways to catch them, what are you most comfortable with? On the right day even a bare lead jig and minnow will fill the boat with eye's. The mouth of the crick coming out of Cliff Lake can be a hotspot, for one place."
