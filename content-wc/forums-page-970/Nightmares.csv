518984,Guest,2002-04-05 14:06:00,0,"Just wondering how many other fisherman have dreams in which they go to Canada on a Fly-In trip only to be extremely disappointed when they find out the lake they are dropped off on has a bunch of cottages and is crowded with other people already fishing. I have this dream at least three or four times per year, most frequently as summer approaches. Must be because I dread the thought of development sometime reaching that far north. I'm from Michigan and have seen how development has ruined a lot of good lakes. Let me know if I'm wierd or something or if this happens to other people."
518985,Guest,2002-04-06 07:57:00,0,We don't fly in we drive up from cen. Mich. 600-1200 miles worth enjoy the scenery every time. We take quads and put a canoe on the quad and go as far as we can go then put the canoe into river lake systems --fish those and then pack the inflatible with the Tanaka 1.2 HP thru the bush to other lakes. Have been up as many times as 8 per season usually 4 times. From the point where we put the canoe in we have NEVER seen another person NEVER.The fishing is more than fantastic pike trout eyes not all on the same lakes of course.And the lakes where the inflatible goes show no sign --wood cutting camps etc of others having been there--I doubt there are many where noone has been but these lakes havnen't seen much pressure.len
