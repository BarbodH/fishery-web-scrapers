518402,Guest,2002-03-21 16:15:00,0,What lodge are you staying at on Pipestone Lake?
518403,Guest,2002-03-24 13:16:00,0,if your looking for lake trout use one ounce white jigs with berkley white neons 3 inch grubs. Mark them on your locator and try to stay directly above them (this takes serious boat control) then just drop them to the bottom and start reeling up. They usually hit on the way up. You will catch them like crazy when everyone else trolling around you will catch nothing
518404,Guest,2002-03-27 20:30:00,0,Do you enjoy catching muskies in 150 feet of water where you can see 20+ feet down and see a grey ghost following deeply behind a slow twitched jerkbait on a sunny day? Then let's go fishing here!!!
