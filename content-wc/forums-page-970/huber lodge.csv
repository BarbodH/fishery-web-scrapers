518710,Guest,2002-03-30 21:24:00,0,"I was there for a couple years. The lodge was great. The food, service was fantastic. The portage lake for smallies was awesome. We didn't do well on lake dinorwic, but ok on Wabigoon. I would give it a try."
518712,Babamel,2002-04-01 07:13:00,0,"I have been fishing on Dinorwic for about 10 yrs. Never been to Hubers, it is too high dollar for me. I have been going to Brown Bay Camp on Dinorwic. It changed hands a few years ago and has really improved. They don't have all the services (no restraunt, rent boats but not motors)of Hubers. The people running the camp are wonderful."

518713,Guest,2002-04-01 18:26:00,0,i have been fishing that area for 11 years now . i go to merkels camp and for the most part always had a good trip . the cost is cheaper for the amount spent .fish the same lakes as you do at hubers . by the way they are only a mile apart .

Last year went a day earlier stayed at the New Holiday Inn in Dryden, Fished Wabigoon and did very well just trolling cranks around Islands. When rest of the party arrived went to Hubers for Dinner. Food was very good, Waitress was cute,(remember, this was the front end of the trip!) and resort looked clean and boats were sharp, with new Honda kickers, money may be higher, but you get what you pay for as they say."
518714,Guest,2002-04-02 08:18:00,0,What can you tell me about the bass fishing in these lakes? Would you recommend for a bass oriented trip?
518716,Guest,2002-04-02 18:04:00,0,Our group went to Hubers 2 years ago. The cabins were ok .and the service was good. Boats and motors there were nice. Fishing was ok seemed to catch alot of small ones. The guide we used from the lodge was no good. Overall it was ok but not planning a return trip soon.
