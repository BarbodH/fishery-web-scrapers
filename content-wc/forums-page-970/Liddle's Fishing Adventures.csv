518991,Harry,2002-04-06 07:22:00,100,Has anybody been to this place? It's north of nakina and the name of the lodge is Miminiska and they also have a lodge on Makokibatan lake.Just wondering the quality of fishing and lodging? Thanks
518992,Guest,2002-04-06 11:38:00,0,Went two times a couple of years ago. Lodging and meals and staff were fantastic the 1st time. The second time the meals were so so but staff and lodging were first rate. The fishing is good to excellent depending on how far you want to run. The problem is the size of the lake and it runs east to west with a strong wind you got some big rollers.
518993,Guest,2002-04-06 20:00:00,0,"Going back to Makokibatan this year for the 5th time since 1993. The Liddle family run a good operation and we have always done well (would not go back otherwise). Have found everything to be excellent including facilities, meals, personnel, equipment, and fishing. Steve Liddle is on-site and makes sure things are right. Regarding lake size, it can be both a blessing and a curse. The size obviously helps sustain a good fishery. However, it can make it difficult for someone on their first visit to locate active fish early in the trip (even with all of the maps/advice that Steve gives you before you start out). Get a guide your first full day there. They do a great job, and having someone in the boat getting you started in an area which has been ""hot"" is priceless when the ""fishing clock"" is ticking. We still get a guide for one of our boats the first full day. That way we don't spend 2 days in August fishing our pattern which was hot when we were there in May last year. Also spend a day fishing for speckled trout in the Albany River. The Liddle family took over Mininiska last year. We have not been there but are considering it for 2003. If you go there, post how you do. E-mail me if you have further questions :[email protected]"
518994,Guest,2002-04-08 04:56:00,0,"Been to Makok twice and both times my group did very well. My experience is that the lake (a widening of the albany river approx 18mi long by 2 mi wide) is an excellent fishery but the albany upstream of makok is a phenomenal fishery. the problem is the sheer size of makok relative to it's east / west configuration and the lack of wind breaks (islands, coves, etc). If you are in any way affraid of wind and big rollers do not head out too far from the lodge or the outpost. My first year there (1999) we saw 6 footers on one occasion. My second year there (2000) we saw steady 6's with the occasional 7 on two different occasions. They were very bad storms that actually did severe damage to the dock and a few of the boats. If the wind is blowing when you wake up and you've got 2's and 3's on the water when you head out you will head in in 4's and 5's without question. Not trying to scare you, the biggest complaint I hear from people about Makok is that they get two or three days of wind and choose to stay in, saying that they couldn't fish. The walleye fishing is excellent but the pike fishing is phenomenal. Good luck, by the way never been to Miminiska..sorry"
