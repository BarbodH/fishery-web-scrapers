1438249,copper44,2012-05-21 08:38:00,8,"Just wondering if anyone has done the trek from the Soo to Chapleau and take HWY 556 past Ranger Lake. I will be pulling a 14 foot boat and wondering how bumpy it is and if its worth it to take the long way around, either 17 to 101 or 17 to 129.Thanks!"

1438479,TIGHTLINER,2012-05-21 15:43:00,223,I took it several years ago and it was not rough but is very slow going because of all the turns i would take 129 might be longer but good road ...
1438491,GOBIG,2012-05-21 16:05:00,126,"I take 129, slightly longer, but i go faster once i am past all the curves. Enjoy"
1438544,copper44,2012-05-21 17:46:00,8,"Alright guys thanks, I figured 129 would be the best bet. I have gone to wawa before and going up along the coast of superior is nice, but it's a long enough trip already!"
1438571,copper44,2012-05-21 18:51:00,8,"One more thing which store in the Soo, ontario side is best to get groceries at?"
1438750,steelroamer,2012-05-22 07:23:00,7,"Born and raised in the Soo. The Ranger lake road can be a nice drive but it is Gravel and this time of year there is a lot of traffic on it and the washboard can get really bad, I would take 129 and if you have some time to kill there is good fishing in Aubrey lake.... just saying. Not sure what your into for groceries but there is a store on Great northen rd called Rome's it is a big independent grocer but the best part is it has a spectacular Cigar shop in it called Holy Smoke it has everything from 2 dollar cigar to 300 dollar cigars and everything to go with it. I don't know about you but I love a nice big Cigar when I'm on the lake. have fun and take your time, 129 has a lot of tight turns and your gonna see Moose for sure"
1440322,jaggersr,2012-05-24 20:40:00,44,"I have been driving both Ranger lake road and 129 several times a year for the past 25 years. Pulling a boat I would choose 129. Ranger lake can be a wash board and a dust bowl at times. 17 east to Thessalon is not much of a drive but its easy on your vehical and trailer. 129 is a decent road and there are plenty of wldlife to see exspecially if the black flies have the moose moving, be careful. I have had a couple close calls I'd care to forget. Tunnel lake and Aubry falls are your only gas stops between Thessalon and Chapleau. A hike to the falls at Aubrey is a nice break in the drive as well. Will be in the area a week from tommorow for 9 days."
