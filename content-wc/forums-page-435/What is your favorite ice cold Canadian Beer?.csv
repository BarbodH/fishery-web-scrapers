1440051,Tin Cann,2012-05-24 12:06:00,6,Last time I looked Coors Light was top seller at Beer Store. Not sure who's drinking it but would be my last choice .
1440139,wallydave,2012-05-24 14:05:00,2151,"Last year we had a few beers with the locals at the AdventureInn in Fort Frances, just to get the dust of the long trail out of our throats!!?? Any way, I had a first guy on his first trip North, so we started with Blue, a good Canadian beer, after a few beers and some sroties, the locals, drinking Bud Light, asked why we were so ""Blue""? It's Canadian, our reply, they went on to say that all beer in Canada is Canadian. So we let them buy us a couple rounds of BL. After a couple they all started to taste the same, but I have wondered, if this was true, or just the ""beer talking"" ??!! Any comments!?"
1440181,Campcountry,2012-05-24 15:03:00,164,The American brands sold in Canada are pretty much all brewed in Canada and they may taste a bit different than the same brand sold south of the border - at least they do to me. Pretty hard to tell by the third cold one though!
1440321,lassh,2012-05-24 20:37:00,553,Alexander Keiths IPA
1440355,Mark Komo,2012-05-24 22:04:00,867,"The kind I buy at the duty free shot on my way to smoke some walleyes in canada. Molson Canadian of course, with side of duty free Crown Royal Reserve. HA!"
1440538,Thumpr50,2012-05-25 09:46:00,139,Nothing like an ice cold Blue!!!
1440545,LOW1,2012-05-25 09:57:00,2828,After thorough research I have yet to find a beer that I did not like while in Canada.
1439089,680 AMERICAN DREAM,2012-05-22 15:50:00,203,It's been quite a few years since I've been there. But I really liked a beer called Old Vienna or O.V. But I am a fan of all the canadian beers and whiskey! You guy's are very lucky.
1439239,Campcountry,2012-05-22 21:13:00,164,"Sleeman's Cream Ale, Sleeman's Original Draught, Sleeman's Honey Brown Lager. All good - take your pick. Forget the Molson's Canadian and Labatt's (arse burner) Blue. Treat yourself to some Sleeman's!"
1439282,hawg,2012-05-23 05:09:00,2008,"Thanks PJM, been a long time since I've seen it."
1439323,1-shot,2012-05-23 06:40:00,35,I never tried Kokanee. Do they sell it at the duty free in the sault?
1439417,Dodger31,2012-05-23 08:24:00,18,ICE COLD ANYTHING! Except Pabst. Kokanee is good stuff. Old Vienna has an edge to it Sounds like I need to get a hold of some Sleeman's. Can't remember seeing it in Rainy River.
1439466,crazyfisher,2012-05-23 10:16:00,25,Carling Light hands down!!!! Oh and it's cheap!
1439524,Blue Fin,2012-05-23 12:48:00,47,"Had Sleeman's last year for the first time and loved it. Had Kokanee for the first time in 2005 and loved it. Had Blue for the first trip up to Canada in 1999 and I loved it. Come to think of it, I've never had any beer up there that I didn't like. I wonder why that is???"
1439601,T Mac,2012-05-23 15:49:00,10084,Tooo many to list (I get to Canada alot) ... LOL But I really like Kokanee Gold probably the best of all.
1439693,green&orange,2012-05-23 19:29:00,28,"Yes, they do. At least that is where I have always bought it. Try it - I don't think you will be disappointed."
1439709,fishincrazy,2012-05-23 19:50:00,1282,So where I go we need to take in cans do either sleemans or kokane come in cans?I usually go with Blue but do like an ice cold Black Label every now and again.FC
1438579,RickOnt,2012-05-21 19:01:00,217,I am Canadian But if I get a Vote it would beFirst choice Molson DryRunner up Molson Canadian.Rick
1438589,Moosebunk,2012-05-21 19:35:00,211,Ahhhh I'll go with whoever said Moosehead.Although a Corona with a lime is hard to beat some days.
1438801,Lovetofish,2012-05-22 08:30:00,458,An ice cold Labbat's Maximum Ice please.
1438895,stevensinks,2012-05-22 10:48:00,330,A few years ago we got some Labbat Wild cat that I really liked. I havent been able to find it the past few years. Anyone know if they still make it?
1438907,621Dreamer,2012-05-22 10:58:00,40,Sleemans Honey Brown Ale! It's great by itself or better yet with a series #2 Partagas cigar.
1438911,IaDave,2012-05-22 11:00:00,476,That beer will get you in trouble- it is good though
1438914,Ralfeee,2012-05-22 11:06:00,33,All of the Sleemans. Tried the sampler pack last year and it was a big hit.
1438916,Lovetofish,2012-05-22 11:11:00,458,That beer will get you in trouble- it is good though I know.
1438951,Freytown,2012-05-22 12:07:00,770,My favorite was Molson Golden Ale. Don't know why they stop selling it.They do sell Molson Golden Beer now but it lost the flavor of the ale.
1439080,PJM,2012-05-22 15:25:00,3516,Hawg The beer is Labatt Crystal and it is not a light beer ia just a little sweeter then Labatt Blue.
1437998,hawg,2012-05-20 16:05:00,2008,"Molson used to make a beer called Crystal, it was very light by Canadian standards, probably to taste like American beer for all the tourists. Do they still make it?"
1438004,NARDA 1,2012-05-20 16:14:00,636,"That's the great thing about rye, no hangover. We were allways up and ready for breakfast at 7 and then out on the lake. Now, go back several years and you never would have seen us before 10am."
1438092,Ranger319,2012-05-20 20:13:00,166,Does the Beer Store carry Kokanee Gold? Big fan of Kakanee but never heard of the Gold.
1438155,rsiminski,2012-05-21 06:08:00,53,Blue and 50!!!
1438253,copper44,2012-05-21 08:41:00,8,"Ranger I have never seen it, I had it on draft skiing at Whistler. It was very good! Slightly darker and heavier then Kokanee original."
1438272,ScottL,2012-05-21 09:20:00,733,"Sleemans Clear is my first choice and Kokanee is 1st runner up. If you want to see my credentials, just find a picture of me and look at my belly."

1437794,F250,2012-05-20 05:08:00,75,First choice is Labatt 50. Second choice is Blue. The 50's are difficult to find in western Canada. I live just one mile south of the border where there is a Duty Free store. Cases of Canadian beer run about $18.00 per case.
1437822,acplumber,2012-05-20 06:44:00,80,"O.V. by Molson is a great beer, its on sale at the beer store and I think it will be all summer long"

1437896,Bigstorm,2012-05-20 10:01:00,799,"my vote is for Labatt Blue after lunch, Blue light for breakfast"
1437902,packpro,2012-05-20 10:13:00,695,"Anything from Nelson Brewing Company. Small Micro Brewery in Nelson, BC. Handcrafted, great taste, light and dark offering."

1437954,wallydave,2012-05-20 12:32:00,2151,My favorite Canadian beer is the first one with the first fresh walleye!

1437985,copper44,2012-05-20 15:12:00,8,Kokanee is by far the best. And Kokanee Gold is quite good as well. I really wish they sold it in Michigan.
1437707,1shooter,2012-05-19 17:53:00,1493,Kokanee
1437711,BrianinVA,2012-05-19 17:56:00,160,Unibroue Fin du Monde Unibroue Trois Pistoles Red Racer IPA I'm guessing you might have a hard time locating these brews in NW Ontario though (someone please tell me I'm wrong). Next trip I'll probably reimport some of the Unibroue as they are that good. When I'm not being a beer snob and can only locate macro brews I drink Blue.
1437713,drlee,2012-05-19 18:06:00,409,One Word: Blue!
1437718,NARDA 1,2012-05-19 18:41:00,636,"Last year I never had a beer while in Canada. Rye Whisky for me! ""Special Old"" is the brand. Our fridge in the cabin is allways full of Kokanee though."
1437720,Mike Kansas,2012-05-19 18:44:00,1463,I like the brands the other guys on the trip pay for.
1437721,RapShad,2012-05-19 18:44:00,76,"Sorry your info is wrong, Molson is the oldest brewery in North America and it is also Canada's second oldest company (who woulda thought?)I do enjoy your choice of Moosehead though! IMO can't go wrong with Labatt's Blue, Molson, or Moosehead. I'm gonna have to try Kokanee this year"
1437722,wallydave,2012-05-19 18:48:00,2151,Yea I like Kokanee or Blue. It depends on the temps warmer days a cold Kokanee is pretty smooth if its a little cooler Blue gets my vote.
1437724,v-bay gord,2012-05-19 18:54:00,3168,"Apparently you may be correct, although being owned by Coors has tarnished it's Canadian reputation in my mind........but that's the global economy, I suppose....."
1437725,v-bay gord,2012-05-19 18:55:00,3168,Narda....your fridge is full of Kokane (cocaine)?
1437754,Moondog,2012-05-19 20:35:00,362,My favorite beer is the one that I am having right now watching sunset on Gullrock!!!

1437645,camp chef,2012-05-19 12:24:00,915,Kokanee
1437647,RapShad,2012-05-19 12:26:00,76,Can't go wrong with LaBatt's Blue or Molson. Do not buy the Labatt Blue Light/Lime unless you enjoy Labatt's flavored water. Molson is Canada's oldest brewery and in my opinion very good.
1437664,v-bay gord,2012-05-19 14:26:00,3168,"Sorry, but Moosehead beer is brewed by the oldest independent brewer in Canada....since 1867.......at least that is what they advertise. The best beer is the one you leave in the cooler with ice for when you get back from walking portage trails and fishing all day. The second best beer is a cold ""free one"" that someone gives you. The third best is a Labatt's 50 drank at the Bayview Hotel in Vermilion Bay during the afternoon with a bunch of fishing buddies. Cheers!"
1437669,Opti-Mist,2012-05-19 14:56:00,1402,"I don't know, my cousin brought some back from Thunder Bay last fall and it was kind of sorry. I'd rather go with the 50."
1437670,trapper_john,2012-05-19 15:07:00,83,when we are up there I usually drink an import. PBR.
1437671,5 of Diamonds,2012-05-19 15:14:00,151,Molson M or Molson Canadian
1437693,JCsGoneFishin,2012-05-19 17:07:00,34,"Oh Kokanee, oh Kokanee You are the beer for me (sung to the tune of O Xmas Tree) This can be heard many times over our week up north."
1437694,joeman79,2012-05-19 17:14:00,417,Kokanee and Kieth Alexanders IPA. Delicious
1437702,JayM5209,2012-05-19 17:47:00,1050,"A six pack has been known to go stale in my refrigerator, but at the end of the day in the Shield country, an ice cold Shiner Boch or Pacifico before going to the fish house really smooths things out.Ooooops! I thought the question was, ""What beer do you prefer when in Canada . . . . ?"" Nothing like a fisherman from one country visiting another and bringing along six packs from two other foreign countries (Texas and Mexico)."
