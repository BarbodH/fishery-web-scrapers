Water temps have alot to do with it as well as water levels. 64* is the optimum temp for walleyes to feed, Higher temps will put them deeper and closer to this temp of 64 will make them feed shallower. Once the water does warm up the walleyes are alway a little harder to find. I have been fishing in northern Quebec for more then 25 yrs, thats my take on it. My best choice to fish is the third week in June the bite is always on"
