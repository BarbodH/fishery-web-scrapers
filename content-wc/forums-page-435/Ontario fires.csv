1440639,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-25 13:06:00,235,Our outfitter was able to route us to a different lake that happened to be available. We are schedule to go back the lake we wanted last year and this year will be in a brand new cabin. They were able to build a new outpost on the same lake in a matter of weeks last fall. Our outfitter said it takes 26 flights of gear and men to build one of those.

1439942,SinOrSwim,2012-05-24 08:35:00,1528,That stinks. Hope you can get in. We were on North Gull while this video was being taken on South Gull. We have stayed at both North and South for years. We actually were flying out of North the same day this video was being taken on the 27th. Some of the video toward the middle and end is absolutely amazing.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZbNBXrq6qk
1439996,copper44,2012-05-24 10:17:00,8,So does this mean no shore lunches near the Chapleau area? I leave Saturday morning and was looking forward to having shore lunches.
1440123,Mohleye,2012-05-24 13:47:00,368,"You can check on the fire ban status in your area....there is quite a bit of rain in the NW Ontario forecast, and Red Lake got about 1"" of rain yesterday according to the Canadian weather website. You can still have shore lunch if there's a fire ban, just need to use a propane stove."

I'm positive this information is either incorrect or needs a whole lot of explanation. Where can I get this information. The link provided in post 2 doesn't say anything about no one let in anywhere. Please help with a source. Thankshttp://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fir...maps/TIM09.pdf Restricted Timmins area.
