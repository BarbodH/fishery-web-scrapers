1440230,Glenman12,2012-05-24 17:06:00,762,our group that goes up had this conversation a few weeks ago..I said its illegal..cant wait to see the answer..
1440236,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-24 17:28:00,1460,"Oh they're legal as long as you have no more than 4 hooks. On a typical quick strike rig with 5 wires, either snip a wire or run a dummy. I'm taking one with me for my trip, 1st week of June. If the walleye are in transitional pattern, I plan on trolling around some mid lake humps and reefs."
1440376,Guest,2012-05-24 23:53:00,0,Please post you results on the a-rig on how they worked for you and how you used them!

1441465,BrianinVA,2012-05-28 07:18:00,160,"""An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the regulations.... A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure."" Link Just make sure the fifth spot has a dummy lure on it or leave it blank and you should be good to go. My father and I have a sort of tradition when we go up north to individually buy the most ridiculous, gimmicky lure we can find. The key is to buy a lure that there is no chance a store up in NW Ontario would sell so when the lure gets hot you have the only one. This year I'm bringing an Alabama rig. My one concern is that they are designed for bass, not toothy gritters like pike. I'm sure handling a large pike with three other hooks flying around will be lots of fun."
1441479,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-28 07:39:00,1460,"My biggest concern BrianinVa, is casting this thing through a school of 40""+ school of northerns and have 4 monster pike on at the same time. Can you imagine a 4 pike synchronized tail dance across the water. Lol, I can only dream about such a scenario. Ya think the net man might be nervous."
