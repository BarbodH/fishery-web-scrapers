1439953,WalleyeRip,2012-05-24 09:02:00,44,Sorry for the Pike question on the walleye board but will be up June 1st and always catch a lot of walleyes but like to change up things during the week when we get tired of hammering the eyes. Wondered what everyone's choice is for early season pike baits/lures. Thanks Rip
1439961,bergsh,2012-05-24 09:17:00,183,Small baits in the spring and big baits in the fall.

Get 5 of diamonds or a red and white daredevil and cast and reel. If they are there, you will catch lots of them. Warm bays with emerging weeds work the best for me."

1440076,onetimedave,2012-05-24 12:40:00,502,Try Johnson Silver Minnows with a twister tail and hold on!!!!!!!!
1440094,bergsh,2012-05-24 13:07:00,183,I used to love using silver minnows. They made a perch colored one - since discontinued. We would go up and literally catch so many pike on them that the back half of the bait would have the paint all scratched off. I found a site that had some remaining stock and I bought all 20 of them that hey had. Sure wish they would bring that back. A side note - we used to use that uncle josh pork rind stuff as tails.
1440191,NEpiker,2012-05-24 15:24:00,9,There is no question. It is the Doctor Spoon in the 1 and 3/8 size and gold/chrome is best. Happy fishing.NEPIKER
1440242,Bill Krejca,2012-05-24 17:42:00,6107,"I tie a spinnerbait which consists of a brown head and 8-10 badger saddle hackle tied around the shoulder, brown thread. I use an elongated overhead spinner, beetle spin style, with a no. 5 gold blade. It wiggles like crazy, and it is something the pike just haven't seen before. Works great in shallow/weeded water!

1440987,Rivratz,2012-05-26 13:11:00,105,"You are supposed to ask about Pike/Musky/Bass/Perch etc. on the Canada Eh Forum you silly loon!!! That's the other targeted fish besides Walleye. Oh yeah... A nice furry buck tail with some flash spinning around, usually grabs the attention of a hungry Pike or Musky. Plus all of the other lures mentioned on this thread. Just make sure your line test is at least 17 lbs and your steel leader is at least 30 lb test and 9 inches long."
1441051,Guest,2012-05-26 18:28:00,0,May want to throw #5 mepps bucktail. I love the gold blade w/ brown tail or the silver blade black tail or the silver blade white tail. Or any of them!
