I was curious as to the effect the early spring would have on fishing but the effect on the black fly population was more concerning. In over 40 years of Canadian fly-ins and well over 60 trips I have never had to wear a head net. I wore one twice this year. Brutal. Anyhow on to the fishing. We did not portage into Morin which was a bit disappointing but timing and weather discouraged that trip. Frankly we didn't need to find better fishing,at least in the evening. The day time fishing was slow even though we had a front and cloudy days for Tuesday and Wed. The evening bite more than made up for it. I was in the second group into Richter last year and the late fishing on Anjigaming was just as good, which is to say excellent. Bright colored floating Raps were the killers. Tried jigging with a variety of offerings but Rapalas were what the eyes were after this trip. I asked Martin about the slow daytime fishing and he said it is a trend for the first three weeks on Anji that the daytime feedbags are off. Really wasn't an issue since we read and played cards most afternoons. It is a very nice newer cabin with a smaller toolshed/storage cabin right next to it. Hot and cold water to the sink, crude but effective outside shower (hot and cold), solar with generator back-up, very good fridge, new 8hp 4 stroke Mercs, large dock, and a nice firepit which could not be used because of the fireban for most of the Ivanhoe area. As in most cases in recent years the outfitters were very accommodating. Martin and Jennifer returned all calls and answered all questions I had promptly. They use Hawk Air for their fly-ins. Scheduled to leave at 4PM and left at 4:15. Pick-up was set for 10:15 Thursday morning and they landed at 10:30. To me that is way better than the norm. Really sweet Otter turbine that gets off the water NOW. I know there was a thread on this and I don't wish to re-hash it but----I offered a $50 tip to the pilots and was sternly rejected. Last year with Nakina Air my offer to tip the pilot was also turned down. At any rate, first class service and fishing from Parks. Feel free to e-mail me if you like. [email protected]"
1440789,unclepaully,2012-05-25 21:00:00,112,Sounds like you had a good trip. I really took a hard look at Parks before I decided on going to Abamasagi through O'sullivan this year. Parks really offers an affordable price for a fly-in. Thanks for the report.
1440831,Mike Borger,2012-05-26 04:36:00,1554,Overall it sounds like a good trip Joe. The blackflies sound terrible though. Hopefully they won't be as bad north of Nakina next week. I'm bringing my 5 year old on along...
1441362,phishfearme,2012-05-27 18:52:00,1242,"joe - every trip is different!! i was curious about the floating rapala size that you used - did it make a difference? on one of our trips the eyes would totally ignore a 13cm trolled/cast by my buddy but were hammering a 7cm that i was using. we switched and (regretably) it was not my fishing prowess, it was the size that mattered. and - as for the blackflies - blackflies refuse to bite me out of pure respect!! phish"
1441375,tooski,2012-05-27 19:30:00,393,"Dr. Phish, I have documentation that black flies prefer normal humans over Squealer fans. Something about the taste of iron City repels them. I would try it but I prefer the black fly bites. The walleye definitely preferred the larger Raps and also in the brightest colors. By a large margin I would say. The water temp off the dock was 69 degrees and out in the center of the lake it averaged about 63 degrees. Definitely not the usual May temps. Also had my first lynx encounter. He (she?) was casually loping off the dock one morning as I walked obliviously down the path from the cabin. Definitely did not upset her as she casually moved off into the brush."
