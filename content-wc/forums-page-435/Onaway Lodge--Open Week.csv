If you want to put together a last-minute Lac Seul trip, here it is...all gift wrapped for you! Search Onaway on this forum and you'll see the camp gets very, very high marks. Then give Cathy & Blair a call."

1439915,IA Nate,2012-05-24 08:03:00,12,"Onaway was our third camp in Canada, second on Lac Seul. I doubt we'll ever change camps again. The Cabins are great--I think they build a new one every year, the boats, fish cleaning house, boat house, everything is top notch."
1439945,SinOrSwim,2012-05-24 08:42:00,1528,"This is the only drive in camp we have been to as the rest have all been fly-ins but I don't know how you can get much nicer. Cabins brand new, commercial appliances to cook on, the boats had really comfortable pedestal seats, they went about 23 to 26 mph according to my GPS, the fish cleaning house is top notch, ice maker, the whole works. And, coming from camps where we were using 9 to 15 horse outboards, 25 mph was awesome!"
