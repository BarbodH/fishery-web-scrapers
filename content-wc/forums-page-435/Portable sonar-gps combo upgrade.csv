1439622,rnnonmt,2012-05-23 16:51:00,992,Well for us guys that don't fish but a couple trips a year I have to say that my HD unit helps me identify things that I would normally struggle with. Is it a fish on the screen or some structure? The downscan image coupled with standard imaging makes me think I'm better off. My two cents. This split screen really helps a rookie sonar interpreter like myself!
1440849,KHedquist,2012-05-26 06:09:00,4367,"Just an FYI Navionics makes Canada Chip, you can go to the lake list to see if your lake is listed. http://store-mirror.navionics.com/charts/PREM-C6"
1437839,MorganMan,2012-05-20 07:23:00,341,"I am thinking of upgrading to a new fish finder this season and would like one with both, sonar and gps. I need to have something that is portable for our Canada trips. I am told you can make most any unit portable?? I have looked a little online and looked at old posts, but this seems to be something that evolves constantly like most electronics. I expect to pay between $500 and $750 (or more if warranted). Power is not too big of an issue as SinOrSwim has put together a nice portable solar pad he uses right next to his unit to keep it powered all day in the boat. Has anyone got an opinion of the newer options like down scan or side scan, is it worth it? What does it do for you? So many bells and whistles these days and I don't know what is worth having and what is not. These are all questions I will be asking at Cabelas or wherever I go, but it's nice to have some insight into what others think or experience they may have had with these options."
1437856,Seanik,2012-05-20 08:07:00,218,"Hi MorganMan I was in the same situation as you, looking to upgrade my present portable fishfinder to a combo unit. After much research and a phone call to a Lowrance tech I recently purchased a Lowrance Elite-4 combo. The Elite-4 is a color unit, uses a more battery than the Mark-4 but these old eyes appreciate the color contrast. I plan to convert the Elite unit to portable by mounting it on a old small flat top tackle box, I got a suction cup from an old unit I have and i purchased a 12V-8amp battery that is the same size as 8 d-cell batteries. The Elite unit has a slot for navronics SD chips which is a plus. Humminbird also has great units with similar features but the determining factor for me on this unit was the price. I found the Elite unit on eBay, new in the box, at a buy it now price of 230.00 with free shipping. These units at Cabelas are priced at 299.00. The black & White unit, Mark-4 are priced at 199.00. While on the phone with the Lowrance tech, he did state that Lowrance or Eagle will probably come out with this unit in a portable version. I will buy the Navronics Canada chip for depths and contours of the lakes I usually fish each year, Nagagami and possibly Heathcote, this will take some research and advice from WC posters. Seanik"
1438018,SinOrSwim,2012-05-20 17:08:00,1528,"If you get the Navionics chip see if they can test it in the store for you. Bass Pro was able to do this and I ended up with the Midwest Chip instead of the Canada chip because it had the big/main Ontario lakes in addition to the midwest states. Two birds one stone. Plus, the Canada chip didn't have the fly in lake we go to anyway."
1438110,Wall1,2012-05-20 20:57:00,17,Hummingbird does have several units that are portable and have the combo GPS/Sonar. Model #385c- new modeli am looking for the same reason as you for our flyin and will most likley go with the #385. look at cabelas site and read the reviews 5 of of 5 stars and a lot of good info- battery life - ease of use etc.works for me good luck
1438188,worthsr,2012-05-21 07:17:00,52,I was also in the same situation a year ago. I bought the Hunninbird 597 Ci HD combo unit. Then I picked up a portable case conversion kit on Amazon ($100) that's made for the Humminbird 500 series and it worked perfectly. I also made a long power cord that so that I could use the boats battery for power when needed. Adding the map chip for Canada is a must. The sonar works well and the GPS is really reliable. It doesn't have the side or down imaging but this setup is a very nice addition to the rental boat.
1438211,rnnonmt,2012-05-21 07:41:00,992,Ditto on the Hbird 597 CI HD. I got the DI version and bought the Hbird portable pack as well. Good portable unit and not too bad on battery usage. I could easily go all day on the 12 volt 8 amp battery.
1438309,Larry Mac,2012-05-21 10:24:00,530,"Hi Wall1, I also have and used the 385C (w/o GPS) on our Canadian Flyins. I am very happy with the units performance. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1438359,dan cardinal,2012-05-21 11:55:00,64,"The Humminbird 385ci Portable is a fantastic combo unit. The color display offers great detail. I found it to be everything I needed in a locator/GPS in Canada...also very user friendly. If this is a unit you are mainly just using for Canada trips, this should be all the power, and bells and whistles you need...for under $500. If you can depend on an alternate power source, that is great. I hook up to the starting battery if available. Depends on where you are... sometimes you don't have access to this. If you need to depend on portable batteries, I would recommend taking two batteries...keeping one on charge...and switch batteries every day."
1439244,MorganMan,2012-05-22 21:18:00,341,"Thanks fellas, this gives me a good place to begin my search. Anyone with experience with the imaging on new units please chime in. I'm not sure it's something I would need/use?"
1439576,dan cardinal,2012-05-23 14:53:00,64,"Here's the question I got to ask...is the 5 or 7 series with HD going to put you on fish that the 3 series will not? Obviously HD is going to display things differently, but structure is structure, baitfish are baitfish, and walleye are walleye. My Humminbird 385ci did a remarkable job of defining contours, schools of baitfish and walleye. Plus the GPS capabilities assisted me in traveling the big waters with confidence and peace of mind. I don't think HD would have offered me anymore advantage. I would rather take the savings and buy a new jiggin' rod."
