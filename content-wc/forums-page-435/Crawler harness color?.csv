1440760,Sportdog,2012-05-25 19:22:00,6735,Wow Pooch! That looks better than store bought! Those blades look more like a work of art rather than something to catch a walleye. Very nice.
1438127,Guest,2012-05-21 03:41:00,0,What is your favorite crawler harness color in Canada? I will be fishing a lake that has a light stain and fire tiger has worked good but I am wondering if I should try any other colors?
1438282,octanehi5,2012-05-21 09:37:00,1104,"perch color, silver, white and orange,"
1438301,Mike Kansas,2012-05-21 10:11:00,1463,Gold has always been a winner. If I could only have one that would be it.
1438315,Ranger319,2012-05-21 10:37:00,166,"Gold is almost always a good color. I found one a few years ago that is lime green, pink, and Chartreuse. I don't know what its called but it reminds me of Bubbalicious bubby gum so I call it bubbalicious. It has been a big producer for me. Lime green...you catch more pike using this color but it seems like most of our big walleyes come on something with a lot of lime green color to it.I have pretty much come to the conclusion that on Lac Seul as long as you have on gold, silver, perch, green, orange, purple, lime green, chartreuse, white, pink, blue, yellow, black, or red...you will catch walleyes"
1438350,pike50plus,2012-05-21 11:39:00,584,"I like chartreuse or ogange in murky water, silver and gold(depending on light conditions) in dark stained and natuire presentaion in clear."
1438706,doubleheader,2012-05-22 05:56:00,2652,"The best advice I can give you is to try bring an assortment of size 3 and 4 Colorado blades and keep switching colors. My top favorites are gold, silver, firetiger, red, pink, and chartreuse."
1439242,Campcountry,2012-05-22 21:15:00,164,Red and white (red devil) blade is all you need.
1439396,trapper_john,2012-05-23 08:05:00,83,Has anyone had success with a copper blade?
1440381,jimmie,2012-05-25 02:54:00,123,The answers are all here for you from others. The water clarity or staining will usually dictate which color to use. It could be different from one body of ater to the next. Lac Seul is a stained lake. Others are clearer and would call for a lighter color. Also the more shallow look to the sky for help. It has been my expperience that the brighter the sky the lighter color the darker the sky the darker the harness. Good luck and let us all know how you do this summer. Jim
1440408,Pooch,2012-05-25 06:00:00,4619,"Ditto what Jimmie said.Also trapper_john, we use copper blades on occasion. Three years ago it was the best ""color"". Last winter I painted up a bunch of blades using copper blades as a base.Attached photo are some of them.Every year there is a different color that works better than last years. We carry a ton of different sizes, colors and patterns with us.Don't ever get hung up on one color.Pooch"
