I really want to focus a lot of my time fishing for lake trout as I have heard this lake has some lunkers. My question is, how deep do you think the trout will be this time of year and how do you recommend fishing for them. I have a good amount of spinners and spoons for 3 way trolling and also a few rapala deep tail dancers that run at about 30' down. Any recommendations from the pros would be greatly appreciated! thanks!"
