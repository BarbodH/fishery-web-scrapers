1439163,Guest,2012-05-22 19:04:00,0,I have stopped in for lunch at what I have been told is a WWII POW camp North of Devil's Elbow in Biggie Bay on the West shore. It is a long sandy beach and the camp consists of a couple of old ramshackle wood frame cabins in the woods with a clearing and trails etc. Very similar to RapShad's description above. Interesting that there were no fences to keep the POWs from escaping. They could take their cnces with the bears and wolves in the woods. I was told that the POWs were charged with clearing trees and stumps from the waters of Lac Seul after the flooding in the 1930s. Not sure how accurate this is.

The second camp looks a lot harder to get to,with a lot more shallow water to navigate."

I'm curious as to its location in relation to some of the more known areas such as Steamboat Bay, McKenzie Bay, Bay of Islands, South Bay, etc. Thanks for any responses."

As a lad around 1950, with my parents on LOW, I paddled around in a dugout canoe which the prisoners had made. We found it partially covered with sand in the large bay just south of Last Point. One of the camps was a mile or so west of there, in Alfred Inlet. As was stated, the forest has a way of reclaiming the earth, very little is left of that camp, other than a slight depression in the tree line. Bill Krejca."

Anybody been there? Anything there to see?"
1438594,RapShad,2012-05-21 19:43:00,76,I've seen several never have stopped by to actually look at the memorials but for the most part they are on small islands or on major thorough fairs on Lac Seul. I know there is one on the southern side of Manitou Rapids and one as you enter Grassy Bay.
1438699,bigwalleye1,2012-05-22 05:43:00,2632,"Not speaking about the Memorial Cairns, I'm talking about the POW camps on the West end of the lake."
1438758,RapShad,2012-05-22 07:34:00,76,"Sorry, mind fart. I have seen where the camps are but never stopped, we might have to do that some time. Maybe in 32 days!"
1438776,wallydave,2012-05-22 07:55:00,2151,"Big walleye, your post brings to mind some questions! Which part of LS are you talking about? And what is the back story to the POW camps? Not to far from my boyhood home in cen. Il. There was a POW camp near by, nothing left but a few buildings and fences. Thanks!"
1438788,RapShad,2012-05-22 08:12:00,76,"I do know a little bit about the POW camps on Lac Seul one is just north of Devil's Elbow in the NW section. Right now the entrance just looks like a small clearing on the shore and there is a clearing in the woods. It's very inconspicuous so if you don't know exactly where it's at you will drive right past it. The cool thing about the camp is that it didn't have walls or fences to keep the prisoners in. If they wanted to escape, good luck! Nothing but water and forest between the camp and Sioux Lookout. Also I know that after WWII many of the prisoners from Germany decided to stay in the area, mainly because they didn't want to return to a war torn Germany, but also because the Canadians were very respectful and the POWs loved the area. Kinda like hitting the lottery as far as POW camps go."

1438840,Ranger319,2012-05-22 09:33:00,166,We drive by Devils Elbow 3-4 times during our week up on Lac Seul. Can you find this from say Google Earth? This sort of thing really intrigues me and I would like to at least drive by it. Really cool info you guys are sharing!
1438870,tv4fish,2012-05-22 10:13:00,2694,"A few years ago - my 2 buddies and I asked about the old P.O.W. camps in the Sioux Lookout area. We were told (and I even think it was marked on our Lac Seul map) about one that is on the way up to Grassy Bay. We stopped in the area where it was marked and sure enough, we found remnants of a couple of old log cabins and it was obvious that the area had been cleared. We even found an old bottle of Vasoline Hair Tonic. If this wasn't an old P.O.W. camp - it definitely was an old logging camp of some sort."
1439124,bigwalleye1,2012-05-22 17:38:00,2632,"My maps are up north, but I recall there being 2 camps, one in the Grassy Bay area and one by Devils Elbow, north and west from there. I'll check the maps this weekend and see if I can get some GPS coordinates posted. Heard much the same info as posted by RapShad re: lightly guarded, no fences, and they only shipped back those that wanted to go, the others were free to stay, and I'm told a great many did. Here's a link to some more general info about why the prisoners were there, how they got there, what they did there.http://www.snnf.ca/municipal-governm...ar-pow-camps/# Still searching for more info re: the Lac Seul locations"
