Ours group may be a little different than most our main focus is on the smallmouth and my main presentation is topwater. I've been fishing years. With the improvement on braid @ super lines, my question is how does Suffix 832 work with topwater baits. All help is appreciated."

I have used it for surface presentations but notice topwater baits like poppers and spooks are little more ""sluggish"" with 832 loaded on the reel."
1441231,adempsey,2012-05-27 10:18:00,963,I thought I had read that one of the manufacturers produced a floating superline for topwater. Just can't recall it atm though.

Speaking of poppers - Try the Rapala Skitter Pop in firetiger for smallies."
