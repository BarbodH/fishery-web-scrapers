But last year I noticed that we caught a lot more of these skinny's. Does anyone have an explanation on this? Should we be concerned on the fishery moving forward? Or is this normal for the time of year we typically fish (early June)? We haven't seen this in years past, so I am a little worried."
1439984,Jigger1,2012-05-24 09:56:00,234,"Blu Fin Â– any particular fishery? On Lac Seul last year we noticed the complete opposite. Fat, sassy and healthy was the norm. At least where we were fishing they eye's were in outstanding shape all the way up and down the length scale."
1439985,Blue Fin,2012-05-24 09:59:00,47,"Well I am not sure I should say cuz I don't want to give the Lake(s) a bad rap. However, I am wondering if anyone has any experience with this."
1440014,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-24 11:01:00,298,We fished Lac Seul twice last year - the end of June and again the middle of August. We found the eyes to be the same as Jigger described.
1440042,hoosiercanadian,2012-05-24 11:59:00,104,"I think logically it means there was'nt enough for those particular fish to eat, too much competition from other fish. Is there smallmouth in the same lake ? I have heard that smallmouth will eventually overtake the walleye , and ruin a lake. i used to fish Nymn lake close to Atikokan, good smallmouth lake , but used to have walleyes in it, no more. Anyway, it is not a good sign, you want to see chunky walleye not skinny ones."
1440145,Blue Fin,2012-05-24 14:14:00,47,No smallies in there. Thanks for the reply.
1440244,Bill Krejca,2012-05-24 17:48:00,6107,"Other than a lack of forage, recently spawned out females may tend to look underfed. Also, occasionally a fish will be caught which obviously escaped from a gill net or had a run-in with a big pike, and is scraped up and not feeding as well as it should. Bill"
