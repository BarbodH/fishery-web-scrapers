Our group of 5 is going to the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin on Lake St. Joseph the last week in June. The cabin accommodates 10 people so we have plenty of room. We've fished the lake for many years now, so I can tell you the walleye and northern fishing is great. I fished some other lakes in Ontario last year with a different group of guys, also. While the rest of that second group thought the fishing was good on the other lakes, I just kept silently comparing it to Lake St. Joseph. (And there really is no comparison - the fishing on St. Joseph is GREAT) Our group ranges from 47 to 65 (actually one 47, and the rest of us in our 60's). We fish 7 days so we don't really push too hard. It's a drive-to, boat-in cabin in the middle of a prime fishing area so there are no long boat trips to fish each day. Join us if you'd like to try St. Joe without the hassle of organizing your own group. If you or a buddy would like more information, just send me a message and I'll get back to you."

1431986,Guest,2012-05-07 13:09:00,0,St. Joe Guy.......Can you shoot me an email to cmbiehle at yahoo dot com ? I tried sending you a pm but it's not going through. Thanks.
1432671,fishnutbob,2012-05-08 16:34:00,633,Ive fished it great fishing beautiful WATCH the rocks. A tip take a beef heart and slice it like a leech works great on a jig.
1432862,stjoeguy,2012-05-09 05:46:00,979,"Bob, I googled ""beef heart fishing"" and found your post with pictures on numerous other fishing forums. There are some nice walleyes in the pictures. It looks like you had a good time on St. Joe. Rocks, eh? Yeah, my Lowrance tracks are full of markers for rocks: fish symbols for fishing sites and skull & crossbones for hidden rocks to avoid. Last year I was going over a stretch of lake with a half dozen tracks crossing it successfully in the past, when suddenly the Lowrance showed a 3' depth. I, mistakenly, slowed down to see if I had read it correctly. I cleared it, but the boat behind me slowed just in time to clunk into them. All of the other times over that track, I could've been 10' off on either side and never noticed those rocks before. They now have a skull & crossbones to remind me that they're there. We're down to 44 days to go! I really treasure that week in Canada and look forward to it every year. It looks like we'll have to add beef heart to the shopping list."
1432923,fishnutbob,2012-05-09 07:21:00,633,Good Luck and have fun its a awesome lake. As you say it has some nasty rocks and it changes with water levels. Its just like a fly in lake but you can take your nice boat and fish in comfort we took a 1890 Warrior on our trip. The beef heart does work and stays on the jig. Look for the blue walleyes when you go we caught a few real cool color. I wish I was going enjoy!!!
1441524,stjoeguy,2012-05-28 09:34:00,979,"Our group of 5 is down to 25 days to go!! We still have room for a few guys at the Winoga Lodge outpost if anyone would like to join us 6/23-6/30. We're down to fine-tuning the menu and getting ready for one more run to Cabelas. I look forward to this trip every year. Time drags until the last 30 days and then, as you're trying to get everything ready, the days just fly by. Anyhow, if you'd like a chance to fish this great lake, consider joining our group. Contact me for more information. I also heard that the week ahead of us, 6/16-6/23, is now completely open due to a health problem cancellation. If that week works for you, get in touch with Troy at Winoga Lodge: http://www.winoga.com/"
