I'm talking about if you are not drunk and get busted with a couple beers. Pretty sure this is the case but if you did get popped for a couple beers in the boat and pay the $200 fine that would not bar you being able to come into Canada again like a DUI would, correct?"
1442116,Cash,2012-05-29 12:48:00,73,How bad was it?
1442119,joeman79,2012-05-29 12:53:00,417,No but the guys on a fly in 2 weeks before we were there got popped and ended up costing them about 100 bucks a beer. They had like 10-11 beers and said fine was about a grand. To many to say they were for a shore lunch eh!
1442142,Freytown,2012-05-29 13:27:00,770,NO BEER? WHAT AREA OR PROVINCE? We drink beer in Quebec...everybody does. Am I breaking any laws?
1442152,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-29 13:48:00,638,"Serve's them right ,You think they could have waited till they got back to camp but then again some people can't live without the stuff,like my Nephew that has 3 DUI's(should have more)that will NEVER see Canada.I could see 1 for shore lunch,but if I was to get caught $100 fine would mean I would have to buy about 25doz. less minnows."
1442153,Cash,2012-05-29 13:49:00,73,No beer allowed in NW Ontario. Don't know about Quebec.
1442157,SoulFulCry,2012-05-29 13:55:00,158,not allowed any booze of any kind in a motorized vehicle period in any province those that drink in a boat n drive just well its wrong period.
1442161,wallydave,2012-05-29 14:07:00,2151,About ten years ago a member of out group got caught with 3 bottles.His fine was close to 300 bucks. We were not aware of the law at the time. I.got stopped I had two on board but because we were from the same camp we just poured them out and got lectured. I think they tried to catch somebody from each camp. Needless to say the guy that got busted has never gone back! Now that we take kids along we don't miss the beer in the boat anyway!
1442169,Aaron-IN,2012-05-29 14:15:00,500,"I was stopped a couple of years ago with six beers in a cooler, the OPP asked if I'd been drinking, I said no and that was that, he didn't take them, pour them out or anything. I know some will find this hard to believe but sometimes I think Americans get some slack by the OPP that residents wouldn't normally get."
1442660,BrianinVA,2012-05-30 10:17:00,160,"We got ticketed about 10 years ago for open container by the OPP. We had maybe ten unopened cans in the boat between two of us and were each on our second beverage of the day. We were each fined ~$130 but I don't recall if that was before or after the favorable exchange rate. I'd wager the confiscated beverages were consumed by those officers later that day.Ignorance of the law is not a valid excuse but we honestly didn't know you couldn't consume in the boat or else we wouldn't have done so (we thought you just couldn't be intoxicated which we had no plans of becoming). In any case, lesson learned and we now only consume when we are back at camp for the evening."
1442703,IMSPIKE,2012-05-30 11:37:00,12,"We have been fishing this area for about the last 8 years and get ""safety checked"" about every other year. Way more than any other locals that we have fished up north. They always have lots of cases of beer in the back of their boats for doing ""safety checks"". If your fishing this area i wouldn't risk boozing in the boat."
