It is our second trip to this body of water and we are staying at their boat-in outpost half way up the 25 mile system. Last time we went the first week of August and mostly drifted jigs with Gulp Minnows and did pretty well for a new place. My question is: How would you prepare differently with the early ice out and making the trip 8 weeks earlier this year?I added spinner rigs with quick change bottom bouncers, slip bobbers, drop shots, tube jigs and we are getting a flat of crawlers. With the help of this board I think I am much better prepared but want to make sure the experts can add their $.02 before we leave. Focusing on Smallies and Walleye is there anything I am missing....? If anyone has fished this body of water and wants to PM GPS cords. it would be great!Thanks in advance for any advice..."
1441536,Jiggin_Rob,2012-05-28 09:48:00,26,I like shad raps and thundersticks for the flats and rocks..My .02
1441936,bushead11,2012-05-29 08:05:00,151,I have some thundersticks in the box already... I also added some perch Mimic Minnows and a few blade dancers. Not sure if I need to add some Wally Divers or other cranks. I guess my concern is that the bite will be more minnow/baitfish friendly because of the early ice out and we are putting more focus on fishing crawlers3-4 different ways ... Anyone have thoughts on this?

1441984,Ogoki,2012-05-29 09:24:00,291,"When conditions get real tough, I have used a slip bobber with a live leech . Say for example I am marking fish at 11 ft in 12 ft of water . I set the bobber( with a rubber band or knot) at 11ft . Cast it a short distance from your boat and wait . When the bobber goes down , let it go out of sight and wait a few seconds longer . Set the hook . If you set the hook yo quick you will pull it out of their mouth . I have not had to use this trick too often , but when they just DON'T want to bite it can mean the difference between eating walleye and not . I use this set up with a vert small , live minnow too . Seems like I can catch more with a small minnow than a larger one in June . I believe the small minnow is more natural ,that time of the year . My wife always said it seems I have more fun fishing when the conditions are tough . I guess I like a challenge . Another trick is a minnow on a floating jig head with a slip sinker . The sinker goes to the bottom and the floating jig does what it is suppose to it rises off the bottom . I was in a place where the fish were suspended about 5 ft off the bottom . I ran the line thru the hole in the sinker and tied on a swivel . I then attached a line about 6 to 7 ft and tied the floating jig on . The reason for longer line is that if you are back trolling the line floats up at an angle so that way you are keeping the bat in front of the fish . I have fished in 20 to 30 ft of water this way ."
