I'm no expert but throught I would share what I learned on the trip in the hoped it helps somone else. We had about 4 unique coldfronts and it rained or hailed everyday.Fishing was good considering the weather. We caught good numbers of both Walleye and Northern, very few bass but we were not targeting them. We had 6 northerns that were between 34 and 36.5 inches during the trip. We caught many others in the 27-32 inch range so the slot most be working on the Northern. All the large fish were caught in about 13 to 20ft of water. Most fish were caught on Jig and Worms or Minnow.Walleyes plenty of fish in the 18.25 in year class and many that were shorter. We saw only 3 walleyes break the 18.25 inch mark they were 20's with the largest being 23 inches. Fish were very scattered we had them as shallow as 8ft of water on crank baits and as deep as 28ft. Some of the best depths were 14-16 and 22-24ft. Most fish came off of Jig with worms and Minnows.Jigs and lures that workedJigs in the 1/4 to 3/8oz hot colors seemed to be bright yellow and green, with pink bring up the 3rd spot.Crankbaits that worked: Fat rap Gold, Fat rap Firetiger ,Jointed Husky jerk in Hot Tiger. Cranksbaits that didn't work to be honest we tried a number of lures Shad raps Xrap 's Husky jerks, nothing worked well. I the shape of the Fat rap was effective I used some Bandit 200's that worked as well but the fat rap was producing more fish.Best of Luck"

1441130,NathanH,2012-05-27 06:42:00,697,Bill I' t was my first trip but I'm pretty sure Rainy lakes water levels are controled by Hydro power houses so its pretty stable. And I did not see any signs on shore or islands that would indicate they had low water levels. That being said They had a lot of water in the area and as we drove out I was seeing standing water in the ditches and my experance back home would tell me that natural lakes should have seen an increase in water levels
1441642,Skidoo600homxz,2012-05-28 14:08:00,37,Our water levels here are pretty much normal right now. Sounds like you had a pretty awesome time.
1441643,fishnutbob,2012-05-28 14:10:00,633,Nice thats a good area to fish even if the weather isnt good.
