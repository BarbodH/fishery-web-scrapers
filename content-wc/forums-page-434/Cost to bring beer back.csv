1441774,Jahloaf,2012-05-28 18:37:00,74,"I know all about the cost of bringing more then the allowed amount of alcohol into Canada, what does it cost to bring more then the approved free amount of beer back from Canada to the states? Its very hard to find my favorite Canadian beer here in Iowa so I'd like to bring back more then the 1 case that I'm allowed free so has anybody paid the extortion fee to bring back more then whats free and if so what did it cost ya."
1441779,NARDA 1,2012-05-28 18:45:00,636,While I'm not sure about the duty on beer I know that the duty on a bottle of Rye Whiskey is only $2.85. I would think the beer would be about the same. You could probably call the boarder or duty free shop to find out for sure.

When I take my wife, it is nothing for her to bring back fifteen bottles of wine, four to six cases of spicy clamato mix (bloody mary drink) with the alcohol already in the bottle and never get charged a dime. Haven't brought beer back so don't know if that makes a difference. I guess I figured for what it cost up there that I can't believe they'd charge more to bring it back. That's been my experience."
1442127,joeman79,2012-05-29 13:06:00,417,We were asked if we were bringing back any alcohol at the border a couple years ago coming back into the USA and told them we had 6 1/2 gallons of rye and they said that was to much but they let us go on. Then they checked they searched the next truck in our group and found 4 Crappy Cuban cigars in a tote I bought at Big Bear and forgot to throw out. So the guys called me and I had to come back to the border and go into the office and fill out a bunch of paperwork and watched as they destroyed the crappy things and probably got put on the potential smugglers list. LOL. But I am interested also of the amount you are legally allowed to take back.

1442228,hogridnfool,2012-05-29 15:41:00,349,"http://crossingmadeeasy.com/what-you-can-bring-back.htmHad friends that tried to bring back more than the allowed 1 case of beer per person. They were told to take it back into Canada and try to sell it to somebody coming in or leave it at US customs. They went back and spent 1/2 hour trying to sell it to no avail, so they came back, dropped it off and told the Jackwagon US guard to PARTY ON!"
1442297,joeman79,2012-05-29 17:24:00,417,Probably the same young smug guy that found my 4 little crappy Cuban cigars and thought he had just nailed one of the 10 most wanted.
1442474,octanehi5,2012-05-30 06:23:00,1104,"Its realy up to the temperment of the man or woman at the border, If they had sex the night before your suff is all in. if not they do not have much for a sence of humer.The cubin cigars are not that good to have them taken away. I bring back what is aloud, per person"
1442549,tv4fish,2012-05-30 07:51:00,2694,TOO funny BUT --- it could be true!!
1442801,IaDave,2012-05-30 15:40:00,476,I will be coming back by myself and I have a few requests from friends to bring them back some Canadian Beer they cannot buy here. Looking at 4-6 cases and they are willing to pay the duty. Is that allowed?
