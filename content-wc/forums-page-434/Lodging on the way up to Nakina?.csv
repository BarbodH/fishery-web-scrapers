1440952,Weby13,2012-05-26 11:08:00,57,I will be heading up to Eddie Norths in August with my family. We usually cross in International Falls to fish Lac Seul so I am not familiar with directions up to Nakina. We leave from Chicago on a Friday morning and I would like to spend Friday night in a hotel/motel somewhere on the Canadian side on the way up to Nakina. Mapquest and google maps both say to take 90 west from chicago then go up thru Eau Clare Wi (rt 53) to Duluth Mn and the cross at Pigeaon River. I have a couple younger boys so it would be nice to break up the drive Friday night and continue Saturday morning. Can anyone please help me with a town? Hotel-motel I should spend the night in and directions to Nakina? Thank You!!!

It's 614 miles from Chicago to Grand Portage and another 236 from Grand Portage to Nakina, ON. We drive from Cedar Rapids, IA and helps break up the long trip. I'd suggest going up through Duluth then 61 along Superior vs going up through International Falls. Geraldton, ON has a really nice grocery store for any fresh break/fruit/vegies. Nate"

Second, we always used to stay in Geraldton so we wouldn't have a very long drive to Nakina in the morning for the fly-out. But typically we'd have a long, long day of driving (from Wisconsin) to get to Geraldton, and would pull in late that night -- sometimes midnight or later. Then it can be a short night if you have an early flight out the next morning, especially since it's about another hour north to Nakina from Geraldton. I would look at it from this angle: What time do you want to stop driving for the day, and how long of a drive do you want to have before your flight? There's plenty of little towns along the way where you and your family can stay. Good luck!- Steve"
1441638,Weby13,2012-05-28 13:54:00,57,I would like to have under a 3 hour drive the next day. It would be nice to stop driving around 7p.m. Im just not familiar with that part of Ontario so Im not sure how long of a drive it would be from any town I stop friday night the rest of the way to Nakina the next day.
