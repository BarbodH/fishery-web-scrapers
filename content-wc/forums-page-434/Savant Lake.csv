1352496,Mike Borger,2011-09-24 10:45:00,1554,Sounds like a great trip. How many outfitters operate on Savant? Are any of them drive to? Just wondering. Doing a quick google search there's really not a lot of info out there.
1352524,Bearfangary,2011-09-24 12:43:00,22,"To my understanding Wildewood has 6 cabins on the south arm and is the only currently operating camp on the lake. There are supposed to be a fly-in lodge and outposts at the northern end of the lake, but one of the staff told me that there have been some issues and it may or may not be operating on a regular basis.During our week there I never saw any boats except those from Wildewood. While you can't take your own boat to Wildewood, there are not the weight and gear restrictions you have with a fly-in. The vehicle that takes you in does have plenty of storage room. We took a mess of beer, food in multiple coolers and all our gear and rods and there was room to spare.We would have preferred to take our own boats, but the ones they have are not to bad as long as a big blow doesn't happen. But the wind we had would have tested a 20' boat also.They do have some deals on the rates, while we were there a group of 4 paid for 3. IF I can help out in any way let me know. For us it was unique and interesting and a great fishery. - BFG"
1352946,camp chef,2011-09-26 08:33:00,915,Glad to here your trip was a success Gary.I can't wait to see the pictures.Skippy and Twelver both said it was tons of fun.
1353009,Pooch,2011-09-26 11:27:00,4619,"We have been fishing lake Savant for years. Most years make two or more trips. This is what I've learned about the area over the years. Hope it's still accurate and helpful to you guys.There are three small camps on the lake and one outpost cabin. Which is not much pressure on a 90,000 acre lake.Camps are Wildewood, Cliff and Roma's and Cat Track. The outpost I believe belongs to Cliff and Roma.Wildewood is on the south arm while Cliff & Roma and Cat Track or located in the middle section. Cliff's (?) outpost is just north of the middle of the lake.Wildewood is probably the nicer camp, but it's a long run to fish from the middle of the lake north. Cliff & Roma's and Cat Track are in a bay on the west side of the large open water portion of the lake and next to each other (different members of the same family own both camps) and in a really great location for fishing most of the lake.Wildewood provides transportation in and out on a Haggland tracked vehicle. The other camps are Fly-In. Just a short flight in. Maybe ten minutes or so from any of the three nearby float plane bases.Over the years I've met and visited with all the camp owners and all are top shelf people. Cliff is definitely the king of the lake as he has been there so long and is a great guy anytime you see him on the water. He catches lake trout almost at will ""like there's nothing to it"".Wildewood has a web site, but I don't ever see any advertising for Cliff & Roma's or Cat Track. Like most camps it's word of mouth from past guests that keeps any camp viable.Hope this helps.Pooch"
1353013,Pooch,2011-09-26 11:38:00,4619,"Even though Lake Savant isn't that far off the road it is in protected area with no access to the lake except through a camp. Area south of the lake was logged a couple years ago and all logging roads were destroyed that could have been used to possibly access the lake.All of us who love this lake should be thankful to Richard Kungle and others for keeping this area closed and road access denied.There is one First Nation cabin located on the south end of the lake, but seldom used.There are several dilapidated trappers cabins on the lake shores, but you almost need to know where there are to find them. There was also a Hudson Bay trading post directly west of Pine Island at one time. This area has a rich history.Lots more, but that would be TMI.Pooch"
1353022,Mike Borger,2011-09-26 12:14:00,1554,"Thanks Pooch, that's the info I was looking for.Cheers"
1354425,SteveJ715,2011-10-01 19:46:00,59,"Thanks for sharing all the great info on what looks like an awesome lake. Quick question: Is this primarily a walleye lake, or do people go there primarily for lakers with walleye on the side? I got my first taste of lake trout fishing this year, and had some success thanks to some tips from members here on WC. But I think my Dad and I both would lean toward a lake that's predominantly a walleye lake with pike and lakers as attractive alternatives if the walleyes aren't biting or for a change of pace.- Steve"
1354457,Pooch,2011-10-02 05:51:00,4619,"For me it's a good walleye lake, for others it's a good Pike lake and for still others it's a good lake Trout lake. It is an all around good fishery. Two of our group just returned last week and brought home some whitefish to smoke.Lake Savant will make you hunt fish, but when you find them they are nice fish. Because the entire lake is ""structure"" the fish are always scattered and have so many options. Wind direction on Savant is even more critical than most lakes. Many times over the years we have seen groups new to the lake or of limited experience struggle to find fish consistently. An area that held many fish yesterday may be sterile today. Fishing memories on Savant is an error. Many days you have to start from scratch.The lake is large, but not huge which lets it get quite rough at times. There are days when the open water areas are un-fishable. This usually happens late morning into the afternoon as the air begins to heat up especially during the summer and into fall.Savant really isn't a ""numbers"" fishery, but the average size of walleye more than makes up for that. Yea, there are one hundred fish days, but most of the time it's well below that. If you think in ""pounds of fish"" per day then that's a totally different story!Pooch"
1442622,Bob_Loblaw,2012-05-30 09:27:00,109,"6 weeks til my group returns to Savant! I'll second a lot of what Pooch says - it's a great multispecies lake, and there are times that you have to pay attention to the wind and think a little to find fish. That said, in my limited experience (three trips out of Cliff and Romas), we've been able to get into big schools of walleyes each time. Not every day was a 100-walleye day, but there were several of those and the least I ever caught was 55-60 in a day. You just have to be willing to move around 'til you find the larger groups of active fish. One very cool thing about Savant is that if you want numbers/eaters for walleyes, you can fish a number of different points with shallow shelves that drop off sharply. If you want to go after trophy walleyes, there's deep water structure. Or, as my group accidentally discovered, you can go fish lakers out in the main basin and catch BIG walleyes on 1.5oz jigs tipped with whole sucker minnows! The pike fishing is fantastic as well; tons of 30+"" fish and we've had at least one over 38"" each trip. The main lake can get very rough - too rough for the small boats at Cliff and Roma's - when the wind is up, but there are so many different bays that you can find sheltered water no matter what angle the wind is coming from. There will be six of us going up this year the week of July 9. Can't wait! Pooch - let me know if you'll be up there about that time, maybe we can finally connect in person and share some stories."
1284273,Bob_Loblaw,2011-03-19 17:00:00,109,Counting the days til July when I head up to Savant again. Anyone else fishing there this year?
1284313,elway12,2011-03-19 18:50:00,335,"We are heading up on the 9th of July! How about you? We stay at Wildewood. Hoping to catch another big laker. I have caught a 14 & 17 pounders, but would like to bring in a 20+. Also would like to get a big northern my dad caught one pushing 40 inches at one of the small portage lakes off Savant last year. So many hope and dreams..."
1284360,Bob_Loblaw,2011-03-19 20:42:00,109,"Hey Elway, I haven't booked my trip yet, but it will likely be about the same time you're up there. I stay at Cliff and Roma's place, which their son Trevor is running now. I'd be happy to point out some good spots for big pike to you. I got a 44"" last year and the guy I was fishing with pulled in a fat 38"". The year before that I had one up to the boat that would have pushed 48"" or better but he shook the hook! If it turns out we'll be up there at the same time, maybe we can chase lakers together. The biggest I've boated is 8 lbs, but I hooked one last year hat was strong enough to break the baitcasting reel I was using!"
1284473,elway12,2011-03-20 09:34:00,335,Bob check your PM.
1284673,IA Bear,2011-03-20 18:29:00,21,I will be headed to Savant in Sept. We will be staying at Cliff and Romas. I can't wait.
1286570,Bearfangary,2011-03-24 20:30:00,22,We'll be heading to Savant for the first time 3rd week in September. Staying at Wildewood. I hear the fishing can be great and the lakers very big. I'm excited. - BFG
1286845,elway12,2011-03-25 11:20:00,335,Bearfangary - Being there in Sept. the lakers will be shallow and so fun to catch. You will have a great ime. The owners of Wildewood run a solid camp and have great hosts too.
1343428,Bearfangary,2011-08-24 17:11:00,22,"First trip to Savant, staying at Wildewood. Should arrive in camp September 15th. We've been told we're the only group fishing in camp. Word is big lakers, but we also fish walleyes. Looking for any hot tip on what I should take aside from jigs and minnow spinners. We might be too early for the lakers up shallow, so what show I do? I'm thinking dipseys running shallow or diving baits. Any tips on presentaions are appreciated. - BFG"
1343469,Pooch,2011-08-24 19:33:00,4619,"Bearfangary,Two of our regular group will be in camp same time as you also at Wildewood. They know the lake and I've no doubt they would share any info they have. We have only been up that late one other time, but didn't target laker's. Look to Rick and Tom.You are gonna love the lake!Pooch"
1352181,Bearfangary,2011-09-23 06:32:00,22,"We just returned from a good trip to Wildewood on Savant Lake. First time for all 6 of us to this lake and lodge. As you'd expect the weather played a big role and we were blown off once from strong north winds, and it rained all or part of 3 days. The lakers were staging to move shallow, but we didn't do real well. Our biggest was 29"", but the neighbors got a 38"" and 41"" dandy. The Walleyes were deep (30 - 45 FOW), and we caught quite a few in the 20 - 25"" range. We only kept Walleyes under the slot and took no lakers home. Biggest northern caught was 37"" but we didn't target them too much. We did catch a mess of eelpout and sure didn't keep them.The camp itself was very well run. Our cabins were rustic but worked perfect for out needs. The owners were gone for most of our stay, but the staff (Maria, Mike and John) did a great job and were very helpful in sharing tips and helping out when needed. The boats provided were 16' with 15hp Hondas and they were baited, bailed and filled with gas every morning. Getting to and from the camp required a hour-long ride on an all terain vehicle (bumpy but fun). I would recommend this destination for anyone looking for an interesting adventure with the possibility of some trophy fish. I'll post an album with pictures from this trip. - BFG"
