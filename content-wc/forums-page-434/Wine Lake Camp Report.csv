1442093,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-29 12:13:00,725,"Well folks, I spent about a half hour writing this post, thought I posted it and it never showed up. I'm sure it couldn't be user error since i am well known in our family as the computer whiz (that's whiz as in taking a leak). Here goes attempt number 2: Left Valpo about 10p the night of May 17 and had a wonderful night that included a drive through Chicago (always a motivator to hit the pedal on the right) driving past beautiful Wolf Lake wondering why we would pass such quality water and drive another 800 miles or so (yuk yuk). Passed through Wisconsin finally stopping for breakfast in Duluth (have another cup there? You betcha). Had a comical stop at the Super 1 for grocs. (eight guys, one list, lots of bleary-eyed ideas) After getting out of there for about $450 and another couple of hundred at the Last Beer Store in Cook we crossed the border right after noon. No trouble except we had too much liquor in one of the vehicles and had to pay duty. We cross at the scenic I-Falls and get our first whiff of Canadian air in Fort Frances, which is adequate to gag a maggot. On to V-Bay where Bobby was too nice and Gail at the Pine Grove Motel once again couldn't get it together to buy supplies for her advertised continental breakfast. We didn't expect it anyways, she has never gotten it together yet! Supper and breakfast at Busters which I am guessing is under new management since the menu is different from last year and the prices are significantly higher. The food though, especially the breakfast was very tasty and let me recommend the western omelet. They were the only place we spent money at par, but for their prices had it built in. In the morning we arrived at the landing at 9a only to find we were the last group in. We usually are in the third week, so Ann forgot to mention that we could come in earlier on the first week. Now we know. Water was low on the Cedar River and we had to shallow drive for a few hundred feet, but we arrived, set up the Moose Cabin and were on the water by 1:30 or 2. I drew one of the rookies, David, on the first day and he and I headed for a walleye hole. After nary a bite, I suggested that we troll through an adjacent bay since I once caught a large pike there and off we went. Within a couple hundred feet I had some weeds on old faithful (perch x-rap, #12) and I pulled her up to get off the weeds.) Suddenly I heard a whoosh behind me and I asked David, ""Is that a fish?"" ""I think so,"" he replied. I turned around to see a large pike leaping out of the water. She made three or four good runs, one under the boat that had the reel singing. Eventually I netted it and we measured it at 42"". I kept saying stuff like ""Man, that's a big fish,"" as we coaxed her to swim away after a few minutes. ""I'm surprised it didn't fight more,"" chirped the rookie. ""Are you kidding?"" I asked. ""She jumped out of the water and made three or four runs before you brought it in! That's a big fish!"" ""How big are they usually?"" he asked. ""Hang on and we'll catch a few of the normal pike."" We then caught a couple 22-24 inchers and he realized how big his first one was with an ""OOHH, I get it."" The rest of the week he was known as the Pike Master. The walleye bite was great. Those mamas were done spawning and were hungry! We packed out 32 for our party of eight and almost everyone was right at the 18"" mark. We caught so many between 18-22"" that no one could count them all. We had over a two dozen between 22-24"". There were about a dozen fish caught between 24-25. There were 5 fish caught between 25-26, with two right on the 26 mark. I thought the best of the week would be bigger but there was a tie at 26 1/4 for the biggest walleye. (I was one of them) The trout were already down around twenty feet so we did not do as well as we hoped with them, but about 15 caught, the largest at 31"" caught by Don. We only caught two small enough to eat at 22"" and the rest were 25-29"". The smallies are only available at one location and Bob was the first one there to catch our largest of the week at 17 1/4"". Most of the ones we caught were 14-15"". As usual, they were scrappy little buggers. We had a variety of weather. Saturday afternoon was rainy and windy with three foot waves on the water. Monday was cloudy but warm. It got to 80 degrees and sunny Tuesday. Wednesday was cloudy with some rain and Thursday also had some rain. it turned cold on Friday and ended up nice as we left on Saturday. Eight guys is a little tight in the Moose cabin but we had a great time. Great food, great people, great camp, great brewskis, great fishing, great camp attendants (Thanks, Jordan and Cindy), Herb and Ann were awesome as always. In a nut shell, it was great! Now, Norm and I wait 106 days until we depart for Cedar Lake!"
1442104,UKBDM,2012-05-29 12:30:00,178,Great report! Sounds like my pesky brethren from Wabby in the red boats didn't spoil your week! How far down was Wine and Wabby? Walleye in deep water yet?
1442133,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-29 13:19:00,725,"The water is down some, probably about a foot or so below ""normal"" whatever that is. No red boats, probably because the portage is a little more difficult than usual. We caught most of our walleye in 6-10 feet, although they were as deep as 16'."
1442154,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-29 13:52:00,1460,"Hey Hooks, I'm pleased you had the good sense to call the rookie ""Pike Master"". Bet he had mad skills baiting his hook. The Pike Master Baiter. Glad that you had another stellar trip and had a good time at your lake."
1442186,wallydave,2012-05-29 14:42:00,2151,I was wondering when the bait proficiency comment would arise!! Come on man!!
1442214,TinCann,2012-05-29 15:19:00,8,Were you able to get into Ghost or Mud ?
1442338,ILScott,2012-05-29 18:54:00,139,I heard if you bring your wadders you will be fine to get back into mud and ghost. Not a fun trip if you are older I heard unless you have your swim suit.
1442370,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-29 19:59:00,725,"We had guys in our group go to both. mud was particularly rough and though they caught fish, probably not worth the trouble. in both cases someone had to get out and pull the boat through the mud. Ghost was easier, but still a little early for fishing."
