1435940,Walleyeski,2012-05-15 19:40:00,40,Heading to Lake St. Joe's (Winoga Lodge Camp) the first week of June. Wondering what water levels are there?
1435976,stjoeguy,2012-05-15 20:27:00,979,"Here is the site to check water levels:http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html Click on Lake St. Joseph in the left column. The yellow area represents the level 50% of the time. You can also look at the Key Site 2 year graph to compare with last year. There are also historical graphs that go back for 5 year periods. Bottom line is that the water looks very low at this time, so let's hope for more rain soon. Possibly Dick or Troy have already made a run to the cabin, so they might have some first-hand knowledge. You're going to my favorite place (as you see by my name). Good luck, catch a lot of fish, but we're coming up the last week of June, so leave a few for us! Post a note when you get back and let us know how you did."
1436429,Walleyeski,2012-05-16 17:02:00,40,"Thanks for the info St.JoeGuy, this will be my third trip there. Hopefully Troy has some time to reply."
1436569,TroyMansfield,2012-05-16 21:10:00,92,"well I havnt been out to our camp on St Joe yet, that is actaully the plan for tomorrow, leaving here at 10 am to get out there and open the camp up spend the night and haul the first group in on friday, I should have good idea what the water levels are doing after the weekend,"
1437493,TroyMansfield,2012-05-18 21:10:00,92,"well the water levels are the lowest we have seen so far, we had to literally idle through 3 spots on the way across lake st joe. which is pretty rare for my dad to do when ripping th barge, so you know its low. the rear end of our dock is touching dry ground. so se is down a fair bit, but with this rain we are expose to get and them slowing the flow the water will start rising.... good luck fishing and good luck for your bottom ends"
1437632,stjoeguy,2012-05-19 11:19:00,979,"Thanks, Troy. Lowest ever was what I was afraid of after following the level on the LWCB site. I hope it rains for the next 35 days (nights only, of course, so everyone can fish during the day). It would be nice to cover a few rocks."
1437710,Walleyeski,2012-05-19 17:56:00,40,"Thanks Troy for the update, we'll see you in two weeks."
1437755,TroyMansfield,2012-05-19 20:37:00,92,"one thing about low water on St Joe is you get to see rocks where you never knew there were rocks before, it was an educational boat ride for sure, I too hope for some good nights of solid rain, we could use it. Ill be seeing you shortly"
1441494,TroyMansfield,2012-05-28 08:25:00,92,"lake will be coming up, we have been getting some serious rain here in the last week, it will intersting how much it raises"
1441785,Walleyeski,2012-05-28 18:55:00,40,"Troy, sorry to hear about your run in with the wardens, thanks for the update on the rain at Lake St. Joe. See you on Saturday Night."
