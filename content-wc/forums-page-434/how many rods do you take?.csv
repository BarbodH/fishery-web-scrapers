1441170,nemusky,2012-05-27 08:19:00,60,"Oh boy this is a scary question! Let see... Normally 4 heavy casting musky rods, all with 80lb braid. 1 MH Spinning rod for pike fishing with mono. 1 MH Casting for casting for bass and walleye trolling (2 separate reels, fluorocarbon and braid respectively). 2 UL rods, one for jigging and on for casting. Thats 8 rods and at least 9 reels! Keep in mind they majority of them stay at the cabin until I head out fishing for that particular species."

1442630,Bob_Loblaw,2012-05-30 09:34:00,109,"I'm of the ""two is one and one is none"" school, so I take two spinning combos for jigging walleyes, and two casting combos for pike/lakers. Last trip up that turned out to be a good move, as one of each broke while up there!"
1435415,nd89sc88,2012-05-14 20:14:00,92,"I always bring three spinning rods. One to jig, one to rig, and one to cast light lures for bass (i.e. topwaters or small jerkbaits). I also bring three baitcasting rods. One heavy rod/reel for muskies, one somewhat lighter for northerns, and one bass style that I usually use for trolling crankbaits for walleyes. Bill"
1435425,Larry Mac,2012-05-14 20:30:00,530,"Hi Keek, For my casting/trolling rod I bring an Abu Garcia Ambassaduer Reel (Original Sweden Made, 12 years old) on a 6'6"" Medium Heavy XMLTi (Cork Handle Original) Rod. I use it for both casting and trolling for walleye and Northern. It may not be the best of the best but works very well for me LOL. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1435434,UKBDM,2012-05-14 20:39:00,178,I am bringing 15 this year for me and two kids at a drive in camp in Ontario.2- heavy casting w/Abu 6600 reels for trolling for big pike1 MH casting w/ Abu 5500 for casting smaller bucktails4- ML spinning for jigs2- M casting for trolling harnesses2 - M casting for trolling cranks w/ mini boards2- UL w/slip bobbers for perch2- M spinning for dock rods and whatever the kids want to throw.Usually not more than 10 in the boat at any given time.
1435436,djarz929,2012-05-14 20:40:00,40,"Never hurts to bring a few extras in case of the inevitable ""breakage"". Accidents do happen. I use a baitcaster for throwing pike & musky lures, also for trolling. Have a couple of spinning outfits for lite casting and jigging."
1435532,octanehi5,2012-05-15 06:45:00,1104,"I run alot of trips on a fly in I bring 5 rods and a reel for each of them ,just in case someone breaks one. the type is up to what kind of fishing you are doing. I*f the bite is on and something happens to the rod you are using its nice to have another already to fish with. as far as quality I bring my best, Its usually the best fishing of your life. so why not"
1435535,keek,2012-05-15 06:50:00,1003,Larry- I'm curious if you are using mono or braid on this set-up. Thanks
1435547,nd89sc88,2012-05-15 07:06:00,92,"Keek: Not to speak for Larry, but I always run braid for my baitcasters. I run 80 on my musky rig, 50 on my pike rod, and 25 on my bass rod. I love the strength and no stretch aspect of these braids (I use PowerPro). They cast really well, too. And when I do backlash these (only when my fishing partner picks it up, of course), I think picking out the nest is easier with braid over mono. Bill"
1440786,jimmie,2012-05-25 20:40:00,123,"4,127! Not really it just looks that way by the time I get there. Whatever your pleasure for bass,musky, pike and walleyes migt be always have a spare versatile rod of medium weight in case one becomes non-functional. That way you will still be able to catch most anything. You should bring two level wind reels for the same reason in case you need a backup. I use two light weight rods for eyes two for pike and musky and two medium for casting for bass and two spares and I am usually by myself! Ah the things we fisherpeople must have. A gar cry from the cane poles I used 60 yeras ago learning to fish from my dad. Thanks Dad. I have mostly Ugly Syiks. I chose them for the price, durability and function. Yes they are decent walleye rods. Not G. Loomis but still effective enough to have a great numbers day none-the-less. Good luck on your trip and enjoy and let us all know how it went."
1440803,Pooch,2012-05-25 21:41:00,4619,"Wife and I bring nine rods in one tube. I take in the boat two bait casters and a ML spinning for jigs. Wife brings one bait caster and one spinning. Leave in the cabin an extra bait caster and spinning in case of breakage. Also, leave in cabin two bait casters with counters for lake trout fishing.No one has ever mentioned it, but we always pack our rods ""end for end"" in the tube. Meaning we bundle them together so that there are butt ends protruding out the furthest on each end. That way if a rod tube gets stood up on end (which I won't let happen) there are no fragile rod tips supporting the weight of all the rods in the tube.Another rod packing trick I've learned is this. When inserting the rods into the tube I wrap my (clean!) undies or T-shirts around them. Saves room when packing a duffel and really protects the rods and guides. It also keeps them from rattling inside the Suburban when traveling.Pooch"
1440806,Terwalleye,2012-05-25 21:47:00,166,"Thats easy. All of them. Drive in pulling a trailer. Heck our group brings the darn kitchen sink along. I bought it it all and do 80% of my fishing for the year in Canada (1 week ) Bring 3 or 4 out in the boat. If one takes a then when we are back at camp for lunch or dinner break, I just swap one out and still get to chill with a cold one."
1435081,Ranger319,2012-05-14 08:42:00,166,"Take my own boat so no storage, weight restrictionsI take 12 casting/baitcasting setups and 5 spinning rod/reels and 2 extra spinning reels.A few mostly stay in the cabin or the truck. I always bring an extra lindy rig/trolling setup as well as an extra jigging rod/reel. I can fish 2-3 times a week every week of the year and have nothing break, get to Lac Suel and will have a rod snap, a bail break or a rod kicked overboard like it came off of Sabastian Janikowski's left foot.I would rather complain about trying to get rods out of the locker than have one snap and not have a replacement. Since we mostly troll and jig, I like to have a backup."
1435101,Knoxabilly,2012-05-14 09:24:00,225,"My ultra light for jigging, 2 more spinning combos, one for slip bobber set up and the other set up for lindy rigs, and 1-2 baitcasters for northerns and casting walleye divers. So 4-5 I guess"
1435109,JDMN,2012-05-14 09:38:00,34,"Usually take 6 but use 4 on a daily basis. 1 jigging rod w/ spinning reel, 1 slip bobber rod and spinning reel, 1 heavy pike baitcasting rod/reel for larger cranks/spoons/swimbaits, 1 medium heavy baitcasting rod with a low profile reel for casting medium sized cranks. 1 extra spinning rig and 1 extra casting set up just in case something breaks."
1435115,Stehle1,2012-05-14 09:43:00,22,"I usually take up 5 rods with the primary presentation as bottom bouncing. So I have two baitcaster bouncer rods, 1-7ft. and 1-6.5 both are Med. with fast tip. I bring two jig/rig spinning rods, 1-7ft. and 1 6.5 ft. both are Med. with fast tip. The last rod is a pure crankbait medium heavy with fast tip, 6'9"". All in all, I have three baitcast rods with two of these having baitcast reels with flipping switches (bottom bouncing) and two spinning rigs. The benefit of two bouncer rods is that I can rig the ""backup"" bouncer rod with a spoon for a quick throwback to catch the pesky pike that just bit off my spinner rig."

1435165,Guest,2012-05-14 11:59:00,0,I take 2 ultra light rods. jig for walleye or very slow/drift/ troll. Dont cast for pike. caught a 43 inch pike on my ultra light 1 year. good enough for me. If i break 1 i will drive into red lake and get me another.
1435302,ripnlipstaknnames,2012-05-14 17:07:00,27,"i usually bring a bunch, like 10 to 12, although there are always about 3 or so that see about 95% of the action"
1435380,Fishin Fun,2012-05-14 19:29:00,218,"Basically 3. 2 for wallye and 1 for notherns. I would take more, but there's usually 3 guys in the boat and we all want to bring a lot of rods."
1435391,keek,2012-05-14 19:43:00,1003,I see a bunch of you guys are bring a casting set-up. Are you talking about a bait-caster rod/reel or just a spinning rod you use to cast spoons and other lures?
1435005,erieangler,2012-05-14 06:53:00,57,"Just wondering as I load my rod tube, how many rod n reel set ups does the average person have w/ them in canada.

1435054,jambi,2012-05-14 08:11:00,504,"Two of us do a flyout take 9 rods. We carry three a piece in boat so leaves us three spares. Might be over kill but last year I did break two tips. Several years ago my dad slipped off his seat and hit the floor, crushed 4 rods too. It was my fault though for making a sharp turn... Also we dont use tubes we just zip tie three rods together, less bulky on the plane and in the truck."
1435061,tv4fish,2012-05-14 08:16:00,2694,We each take 3 --- 2 light ones for walleyes (in case one breaks) and a heavy duty casting set-up for northerns/muskies.
1435062,wallydave,2012-05-14 08:17:00,2151,I mostly go the drive in route so I take plenty of gear. Usually 2 rods for pike a couple light rigs and a couple ultra life's for walleye.The year we flew in it was what ever would fit in the rod tube. Its the tackle box that is a concern for a fly in. I have a smaller outfit for fly ins a big Multics drawer box for drive ins.
1435063,Larry Mac,2012-05-14 08:18:00,530,"Hi Erieangler, I will usually take 4 rods. I take two for jigging, one for casting and one bobber rod. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1435079,camp chef,2012-05-14 08:39:00,915,My partner and I share all our equipment. We bring 6 rods all of which are med or medium light with a fast or xfast action. reels are 1500 to 4000 spinning reels. Any and all of them have been used for jigging or casting or trolling if need be.We usually set up one apiece for Walleye and one for pike and the other two sit in the locker all week.
