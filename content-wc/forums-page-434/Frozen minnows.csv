1442960,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-30 21:35:00,235,"Use fatheads over shiners. For us, a pound per guy for a four day trip is about right. However, we only fish hard for about 6-7 hours per day, and many times we only use plastics when they're really biting."
1442267,Ranger319,2012-05-29 16:39:00,166,"Going to get some minnows, either fathead or shiners, to freeze and take up to Canada this year. Have never fished with minnows before so I have no idea on how many one might go through in a week. I would assume its similar to fishing with a crawler in that most of the time its one fish=1 bait. Does one go through more minnows than crawlers?How many frozen minnows do you guys/gals bring?"
1442325,Skywagon,2012-05-29 18:22:00,1106,"I have fished with salted, but never frozen. On good days I have used up to 3 dozen live minnows, some days half that amount would be enough and we won't talk about the other days. The one day last week we had mostly small minnows and probably averaged 1 fish for every two minnows at the best, but were fishing shallow in the weeds (weeds and rocks eat minnows). Just be sure to have a backup alternative."
1442452,phishfearme,2012-05-30 05:42:00,1242,"zero - i have found that their stomachs break open due to freezing/thawing and they look/act terrible. and even the salted ones look/act like stiff boards on a jig or hook. contrary to numerous others on this board, i find these a waste of time. 3"" twister jigs and nightcrawlers cut in half on a hook is all you'll need - and these are much cheaper and less hastle. phish"
1442496,Bigstorm,2012-05-30 07:03:00,799,"I just salted (then froze) 20doz for my trip, leaving on 6/16. Salt them before freezing, if you freeze plain minnows they will turn to mush when they thaw out. The salt preserves them. They may get a little leathery but they will last longer on the hook then. I can honestly say that we do just as well on the salted minnows as we do with live (we use both up there)Do a search on here for salted minnows to find various ways to do it"
1442628,drlee,2012-05-30 09:33:00,409,"I just ordered 80 doz. salt minnows from a bait shop in Fond du Lac, WI. 6 guys will fish for a week in mid June; I will keep the remainder of the minnows in my basement until I return to Canada for two weeks late July/early August...that trip will be 2 guys for the two weeks. I will have a pretty decent number of minnows left most years. We pay about $1 a dozen. We do use some nightcrawlers, some artificials, and rarely, some live minnows. If we stayed exclusively with salt minnows, we still would not be likely to run out. I leave the leftovers with the camp at the end of our two week stay. It has been very rare that salt minnows don't fish as well as live ones. On my one week trip, we would have to drive 100 miles round trip to replenish our live minnow supply. On the two week trip, I can buy live minnows in camp and will occasionally experiment. Usually, if the bite slows down on my salt minnows, its because nightcrawlers have suddenly become the food of choice for the walleyes...so, I keep some around and often use them with great success. Obviously, they are cheap and easy to keep."
1442659,Jig Man,2012-05-30 10:16:00,95,"My experience is there is no need to freeze salted minnows just refrigerate. The freezing ads moisture and thawing is what makes them mushy. The minnows will last a month in the fridge. SALTED MINNOWS. In a 5 gal bucket add pickling salt, garlic powder and just enough water to make a thick slurry. Add 3-4Â” minnows or fatheads to slurry, let set 3-4 hours. The minnows will ingest and absorb the salt preserving them. Drain off excess water. Place 3-5 dozen in ziplock bags and refrigerate, do not freeze."
1442689,Fishoil,2012-05-30 11:09:00,1277,"I just salted/preserved 15 pounds last night. I mix 2 cups of pickling/canning salt with 1 cup of Borax in a 1 gallon ziplock bag. Then I add about a pound of live minnows and shake it until they are well coated. After refrigerating overnight I rinse them off and put them in a bucket or clean bag and keep cold until using. This method works great, I even have some left over from last September that I will be taking along next week and they still look good. drlee, I'm leaving for one of your favorite places on Friday - Pashkokogan."
1442855,drlee,2012-05-30 17:14:00,409,"fishoil, PLEASE leave a few walleyes in the lake for me. A couple of things: Would you post a fishing report when you return? I am really interested in the water levels, traveling through the narrows into East Pash. We will be at Austin's June 16-23. I am pretty pumped because both of my sons and my oldest grandson are going, along with 2 very good friends. Also, do you have an estimate of how many minnows are in a pound? The place I get them thinks in terms of pounds and I think in terms of dozens...I would like to start speaking their language. Even a ball park figure would be fine, if you are willing. Most importantly: Have a safe, successful fishing trip and enjoy the company of your fishing buddies. My eldest gave me the greatest compliment ever a couple of years ago. He said, ""Dad, do you know who my favorite fishing partner is?"" I said, ""No, who?"" He smiled and said, ""you are."""
1442860,camp chef,2012-05-30 17:28:00,915,There' is probably 90 to 100 lg shiner in a pound.
