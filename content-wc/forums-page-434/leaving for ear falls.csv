Last year was really tough for the shallow jig and minnow bite for our group. We showed up after the hatch and the eyes had just gorged themselves on those flys. We caught plenty casting cranks, but not the numbers of males of past years. So thanks for the heads up that they aren't out yet, and hopefully won't hatch between now and Saturday !"
1440483,eye1a,2012-05-25 08:31:00,9,Leaving for Ear Falls when the wife gets home in about a hour........finally :-). Sounds like some cooler wet weather for awhile. Hopefull it doesnt effect the river walleye bite to much. Drive safe everyone and good fishing..........Dan

1440555,stumcfar,2012-05-25 10:22:00,451,"Leaving this afternoon. The weather doesn't sound great, but it will be what it is! Second year that my son is going with and he is pumped. (I am too!)"
1440560,wallydave,2012-05-25 10:27:00,2151,A little water wont hurt the fish! Might keep the bugs and fires away!!

1440772,bus33,2012-05-25 19:49:00,289,"Just got back this morning from the opener on Lac Seul. We stay just outside of Ear Falls. Fishing was really good considering the warm spring. Walleyes were non-stop with many just under 18, a few slots and a few trophies. All in all it was a great week. Good Luck."
1441063,bushead11,2012-05-26 19:27:00,151,Buss- any insight as to the black flies or mayflies...?
1441234,Skywagon,2012-05-27 10:42:00,1106,"I had been waiting for someone to ask about the black flies, the answer is they have been brutal in spots. Did some soaking for trout off the lake bank a week and a half ago and came home with over 50 bites on my face and head, plus a couple that even made it into my clothes. Not so bad around home, but they have been giving my wife fits when she is walking in the bush. Still too early for mayflies, generally that is another 2-3 weeks off."
1442332,bus33,2012-05-29 18:31:00,289,No mayflies and a few black flies.....not too bad though.
