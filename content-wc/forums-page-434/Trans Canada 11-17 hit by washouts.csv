Looks like I might need to figure an alternate route.http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...EventRoadInfo5
1442752,lawson2343,2012-05-30 13:13:00,459,"I previously posted what was told to me, but as I look at a map I'm pretty sure they are talking about the junction of 11 with 102 right in Thunder Bay. So I'm thinking I'm pretty safe heading west of Thunder Bay for Ignace. Sorry for any possible misinformation."
1442774,waterwick,2012-05-30 14:29:00,32,In Thunder Bay where hwy 102 meets 11-17 all is good. This intersection is a main street. If you turned right you would head towards downtown and Lake Superior on Red River Rd. Left you are going west out 102. This is also called Dawson Rd for us longtimers. When you come up from the states just stay on the main hwy 61 (the name will change but the roads the same) straight through to 102 and you'll be fine.
