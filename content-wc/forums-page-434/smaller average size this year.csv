Only 350 days til next year lol.. don't get me wrong cause I'm not complaining but our average eyes were in the 15"" range this year( small for the lake we fish). In years past, it was tough to find em less than 18"". Wondering if anyone else has seen this on the waters they fished. I see it as a positive for the future and it boads well for recent year classes"
