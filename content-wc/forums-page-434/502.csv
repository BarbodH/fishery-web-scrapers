1440537,BennieS,2012-05-25 09:45:00,108,Wondering if 502 made it through the winter in good shape. It's our first trip to Ontario and we're trying to make a decision on whether to take 71 or 502 as we head for Gold Arrow Camp in Perrault Falls. After reading previous threads it seems like a guy needs to check after the winter season.Thanks in advance for any advice.

1440573,bergsh,2012-05-25 10:44:00,183,Was just up there 2 weeks ago. Road is in great shape. Still the occasional boat bouncing bump that they never seem to get fixed. Also on my way up that road tomorrow morning. Good Luck.
1442218,dogrodder,2012-05-29 15:29:00,400,Just drove it yesterday and it's in great shape. Already counting the days till my next visit! Watch for Moose if you are driving up after or near dark. I saw six of them on the highway on my way up.
1442423,BennieS,2012-05-29 21:46:00,108,Many thanks to all for the info as well as the moose warnings. Leave in 2 days and will take 502.
