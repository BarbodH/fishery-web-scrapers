1442467,octanehi5,2012-05-30 06:10:00,1104,"The weather up north changes alot,Water temps dictate how good the bite is 64 is the optimum walleye feeding temp, If its 70 out all day and high forties at night , All you will need is a nice walleye chop on the water and it will be on. Never cancel a fishing trip to go to work"
1442784,pegasis0066,2012-05-30 15:04:00,64,I see that - 100% different now. I should have known not to pay attention to that long-range forecast.
1442265,10point,2012-05-29 16:36:00,102,I'm going to Ontario that week also with a similar forecast. If you click on more each day it will tell how many hours they think it will rain and most of my days were just a couple of hours. I think those long range forecast may just be on historical weather.
1442276,Aaron-IN,2012-05-29 16:51:00,500,"After years and years of watching forecasts then realizing the forecasts were never accurate i don't even bother anymore. About five years ago I was watching the accuweather forecast for Kenora and they showed pretty much the same forecast as what you have. No joke, it didn't rain a single drop the whole week I was there."
1442281,pegasis0066,2012-05-29 16:58:00,64,Thanks - didn't notice that. Game one - still going as planned
1442282,Skywagon,2012-05-29 16:58:00,1106,"We talked to two Americans at the cafe at noon today, they said a couple of groups had left their resort on Dinorwic early because of the weather and poor fishing. I can't imagine going that far and giving up after 4 days. Yes, it has been raining a lot."
1442322,adempsey,2012-05-29 18:10:00,963,"Great weather! I worry about the wind, not the rain. Besides, weather forecasts beyond one day are basically guesswork IMO."
1442331,bigwalleye1,2012-05-29 18:29:00,2632,"...kinda sounds like a recipe for disaster. That said, can we all watch???"
1442340,Mike Borger,2012-05-29 18:55:00,1554,I'm a weather guy and as has been mentioned already the long range forecasts are wildly inaccurate.I'd say three days is the most I'd consider looking at. Beyond that it's largely guesswork (although educated guesswork LOL!).Don't sweat it. Go on your trip and have fun.
1442352,Terwalleye,2012-05-29 19:26:00,166,All I can say is that the weatherman seems like he is wrong as much as he is right. I would argue that if that forcast was full of Sun symbols that you would have just as much chance for rain. Last two years we were up; we saw a low of 40 degrees and a high of 85 plus degrees. Forecast was for 70 degrees everyday. Average them all together and it was 70 degrees. Just another average week weather wise.
1442388,Pooch,2012-05-29 20:24:00,4619,"I know this is dumb, but I think that forecast in Celsius. Right? Not as bad as it looks. Not exactly T-shirt weather though. We always think in ""layers"" when north of the border, even in the summer months. Not uncommon to have frost on the boat seats even in August.Pooch"
1442465,10point,2012-05-30 06:07:00,102,The forecast has changed.
1442194,pegasis0066,2012-05-29 14:52:00,64,Would you try to reschedule?http://www.accuweather.com/en/ca/fol...t/54907?day=11
1442195,camp chef,2012-05-29 14:56:00,915,**** no....sounds like perfect walleye weather to me
1442199,Ranger319,2012-05-29 15:03:00,166,"X100 I would have killed to have that weather the last few years I've gone up. I spend more time in my rain gear either because of the rain or to keep warm. I am due for good weather this trip!!One thing I can say is I have always caught fish while having my rainsuit on. That normally translates into nasty weather. Nothing like a good wind and some rain to really get the big girls strapping on the feed bag. But remember, ALWAYS be on the lookout for lightning. No fish is worth it!"
1442200,Jball,2012-05-29 15:04:00,23,im headed north of red lake in 10 days.. same time. Its way too early to look at weather reports now. I would wait until your 5 days out max.
1442205,tv4fish,2012-05-29 15:07:00,2694,THIS is for the poor guys that are up there NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!1http://www.accuweather.com/en/ca/sio...forecast/49590
1442208,RapShad,2012-05-29 15:09:00,76,"Apparently SNOW flurries this morning in Sioux Lookout, rain doesn't sound too bad after that"
1442210,pegasis0066,2012-05-29 15:14:00,64,We don't fish for walleye - pike only. And this is a pike only lake so not even an option this year.And it's just the wife and I - she not a big fan of rain.
1442225,camp chef,2012-05-29 15:38:00,915,Well then you are asking the wrong people about changing the date.Ask your wife..
1442232,pegasis0066,2012-05-29 15:43:00,64,I did but might overrule her
1442263,Rivratz,2012-05-29 16:36:00,105,"The perfect walleye weather is partly cloudy, a westerly breeze, 60 to 75 temps. At least the forecast is improving later this week! Pretty near impossible to change plans at the last moment. But if you could, I would! Over the years I've been up fishing in May, June, July, Aug, & Sept. I have found mid June to early July the best for weather and fishing. Late Aug. to early Sept. came in 2nd."
