1442067,DougBlack,2012-05-29 11:43:00,29,"None for Walleye although will pick them up casting for pike many times. Number 5 Mepps with bucktail, either silver or gold spinner. Wont go up to Canada without at least 6-10 of those. They are Money."
1442178,Guest,2012-05-29 14:26:00,0,"I use #3 copper with plain hook first, but might use a #3 gold with plain hook if that's not working well. My fishing partner sticks with a #4 copper with plain hook all the time. It doesn't take long at Minaki for a dressed-hook mepps to become plain.... In addition, it generally doesn't seem to make much of a difference for pike, smallies or even walleye anyway IMO. But just before the sun is rising/setting or on an extremely overcast day, we'll sometimes put a 3"" yellow [not chartreuse] twister tail on one of the hooks."
1442184,JETSTER,2012-05-29 14:32:00,448,I use mepps 5 without hair only cause with hair there a dollar more!!!!silver in sun and copper or gold in overcast for walleye.....Pike ya gotta go with funky colors like a black fury with orange!!!!
1442188,wallydave,2012-05-29 14:45:00,2151,Ive had good luck with red and white and black and yellow #4s for pike. Never had a walleye yet but that could change in three weeks!!
