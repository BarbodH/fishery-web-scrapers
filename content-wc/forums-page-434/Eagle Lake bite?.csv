We do need the rain desperately as the lake is low. Fishing has not been consistant for me....my usual spring spots are either hot or cold. Walleyes deep and shallow....it's a real mixed bag. To me it seems slower than normal, but I've read other reports that were ""glowing"", so I suppose I'm losing my mojo!! I think the weather starts to stabilize tomorrow so fishing will be good for you next week. Scott's group hasn't had a bad week fishing Eagle yet.......and if they can catch fish, anyone can"
