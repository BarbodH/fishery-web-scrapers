The low water made us hunt for different spots than we normally fish but once we found the Eyes the bite was good. Most fish came on white twister tails with good action on jig/minnow. Morning fish were in 10 to 15 foot water while in the afternoon they moved up into the sun warmed water. Edges of flats were good producers and rock ledges produced well. Seemed like almost every drop off that had the WIND INTO IT was holding fish willing to bite as long as we were patient. Some big fish came off of the drops in the afternoon deep jigging (10 to 15') Slow but worthwhile. Lots of slot fish...biggest fish 29""."

531892,Guest,2003-06-02 19:00:00,0,Dont stay at a Lodge. We stay at a friends house and we fish the Southeast part of the lake. When we went to the watering hole and talked to other fisherman it seemed they all had decent fishing and a few bent props.
531893,Guest,2003-06-03 08:33:00,0,"Our group returned from Lac Seul last Sunday. We fished for six days and caught plenty of nice slot Walleye. One of the guys in our group caught a 30"" and a 31"" Walleye (we wont be inviting him back Ha Ha). The majority of our fish came on jig/minnow but we did catch a few trolling Rapalas in Perch and Firetiger on flats with 8 to 12' of water. Seemed like any structure with a little wind on it was producing. We also caught some Smallmouth and as always a lot of Snake Pikes. The lake is really low and we bumped a lot of rocks ......GO SLOW. We fished the Aldous Bay area of the Lake and back to west of Aldous."
