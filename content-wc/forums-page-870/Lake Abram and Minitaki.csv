531817,Lips,2003-06-05 10:50:00,8,Any certain time of day that those muskies prefer to eat? Lures to use? I might give it a try one day. Thanks for the info.
531818,Guest,2003-06-06 20:44:00,0,"KARL, What is your most productive part of the lake for smallie fishing, and what is the name of the fishing guide you recommend and estimated fee? Thank bubba"
531807,BWLCwalleyeguy,2003-06-01 18:23:00,26,"Does anyone know where I can a map for either of these lakes? I will be heading up for this area for the first time in a couple weeks and was wondering if anyone had any advice not only for walleyes, but also muskie and smallmouth. How has the fishing been in these areas? Thanks for any help guys!"
531808,Guest,2003-06-02 19:40:00,0,"I can help you with minnitaki for walleye and some bass advice. June 16th redpinebay opens to keep fish. Redpine is excellent for walleye(just look for the boats). The cutout area and the narrows are good areas on the pickeral arm. The islands on pickeral arm usually hold some smallies. Talked to the lodge owners this week, said smallies were visible around islands,walleyes caught in southwestbay, redpine, and cutout. Lot of info on previous ahbrams chute. I'll be up 6-14. Hope this helps."
531809,scar,2003-06-03 07:05:00,196,"walleye guy, if you are after muskies this chain is not for you but eyes and smallies are the ticket.like bubba said, and i'm assuming you are going up after june 16,red pine bay for big fish and lots of them. the other two sanctuaries also open on the 16th and are excellent. our place is two m inutes from rice creek and is very good. fish the left side just as you get in and continue around the first major point and fish that flat also.the english river is undescrible it is so good but the fish are smaller(14- 17'')use jigs here.all other spots we backtroll with norhland rainbow spinners(single hook, 1/2 a crawler and 3/8 egg slip sinker. we target 6 - 10 '. once we really find them we will stop the motor and jig the spot before moving on looking for more.we have found good smallie action at the mine shaft area and in lyons bay.don"
531810,Guest,2003-06-03 16:11:00,0,"scar, I have fished lyons bay, but did not know of a mine shaft. How far back in the bay?"
531811,Karl,2003-06-03 19:01:00,63,"Mine Shaft Narrows is about 20 minutes due east of Lyons Bay. It separates East Bay from Northeast Bay. Been there many times - it ain't worth it. For that matter, either is Lyons Bay. There are a gazillion locations that are far more productive."
531812,Karl,2003-06-03 19:09:00,63,"If this is your first time - spend a couple extra dollars for a guide - at least for one day. I know of the best if you're interested. This will be my eleventh year and 29th (30th & 31st) week on Minnitaki (Pickerel Arm Camps).I improved 10,000 percent after hiring a guide, and still continue to hire him at least twice a year, because it just gets better and better every year."
531813,Guest,2003-06-03 19:36:00,0,"Karl, I have been to the minnitaki 5 times. I love to catch smallies. The camp we are at does not promote guide service. I have pretty good luck in the evenings around the islands where you stay. I appreciate any info that you are willing to share."
531814,Guest,2003-06-03 19:40:00,0,"Karl, I failed to mention that when I fished lyons bay which was in late june I did not catch many smallies. Ive heard its good for lakers, but I have never tried the trout deal."
531815,Guest,2003-06-04 09:56:00,0,"Heading to Minnitaki June 21-28. When I get tired of catching all those walleyes I was thinking about pulling the boat out for a day of musky fishing. What is my best bet if I don't want to drive too far from the launch on Abrams? Also, I've been told there are nice lakers in Minnitaki - so tell me how to catch one. Also, what are the best tactics on nearby lakes if I want to try there for lakers."
531816,Karl,2003-06-04 17:02:00,63,"You can catch lakers easily while it's snowing. If it's not snowing, you're in for a boring day. Kidding aside, lake trout are catchable right after ice-out in May and just before ice in late September. In between those dates they are suspended at 80ft in water near 100ft. Good luck!For muskies you can't beat Little Vermilion in the back bay where in flows into Big Vermilion. The boat launch is excellent and parking is safe. There is a small fee to enter Ojibway Provincial Park, but it's worth it.For smallmouth, repeat the prior sentence replacing ""muskie"" with ""smallmouth""."
