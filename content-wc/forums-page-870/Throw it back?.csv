531857,Guest,2003-06-05 09:40:00,0,"Yeah, me too. A few years ago LOTW went to a limit of 2/day for non-residents with a regular license. I thought it went back up to 4/day but the outfitter told me last year it was still at 2/day. I'm aware of the 4/limit rule. Anyone know what the walleye limits are on LOTW for non-residents? I've been following the 2/day rule."

531847,Guest,2003-06-02 12:30:00,0,"I only stated what the argument is, I didn't say I agreed with it. But, the regs are usually strictly interpretted and applied without much wiggle room. I haven't read the actual reg prohibiting fishing with gamefish, but I'd be surprised if it includes an intent element. It probably prohibits the taking of any fish using a gamefish for bait and doesn't say anything about intent."
531848,Guest,2003-06-02 12:52:00,0,"No different than not intentionaly catching a Musky but catching one anyway. You put it back...no foul. The mere fact that you were NOT ""fishing"" with a gamefish makes the arguement a rather mute point. This is just my opinion of coarse."
531849,phishfearme,2003-06-03 05:05:00,1242,"by this argument, the second you catch a walleye, you are illegally fishing with a game fish. i can't see any MNR officer taking any action here - unless he starts ticketing everone who catches a walleye. phish"
531850,Guest,2003-06-03 08:26:00,0,"No, the violation occurs when you ""take"" a fish that you caught with a gamefish. In other words when you keep the pike instead of throwing it back. I agree it's all highly technical and unlikely that any tickets would be issued. In fact, I seem to remember a story a few years ago in Minnesota about a guy who caught a monster pike or muskie this way and it got reported in the press. I don't recall reading anything about him being ticketed."
531851,Guest,2003-06-03 16:29:00,0,"Just a word of caution regarding replica's --- make sure the artist is good. Last year my daughter caught a 20LB + northern on Lac Suel, which after pictures we released. I had a replica made for her for Xmas and it in no way resembled the fish she caught. The colors were off and the replica mount the guy ordered was to fat. Ironically, this individual had previously done some nice Walleye replicas for us."
531854,phishfearme,2003-06-04 04:11:00,1242,not exactly correct - it is illegal to USE gamefish or any part of a game fish as a bait or lure dressing. so catching a walleye is tanamount to violating this law. phish
531852,Guest,2003-06-05 06:50:00,0,"Congrats! Your starting her off right. I am sorry to hear that you had a bad experience, did you say anything to the taxidermist?Go_Fish"
531853,Guest,2003-06-05 08:32:00,0,Normally I would have but the guy's son committed suicide a few months before and it just didn't seem right to complain about something like a fish. My hunch is his wife never gave him the picture I left because his other work has been good.
531855,winchester70,2003-06-05 08:54:00,0,"You are assuming that he is talking about Ontario.Alberta law states that only the skin,fins,eyes and dead eggs of game fish may be used as bait.Funny how different provinces have different outlooks regarding laws eg;we can go diving and use a speargun,you can't,you can hunt with a crossbow,we can't,our walleye limit is three fish over 17 in.I could be wrong but isn't yours three under? The list goes on and on,sure does make you what to scratch head!!"
531856,phishfearme,2003-06-05 09:13:00,1242,yah - this is an ontario (and i think quebec) law. the limit in most of western ontario is 4 with a regular license and 2 with a conservation license with slot limits in many regions. we ask the outfitter to specifically show us what the regulations are for the lake were fishing - and sometimes he's confused. - phish
531837,5Paulie4,2003-06-02 03:30:00,34,"It happens enough to pose this question. You're trolling or casting when a smallish walleye grabs your lure. As you reel him towards your boat, one of those monster Canadian northerns emerges from the deep and grabs your fish. Off he swims with your walleye and your lure in his face. It's you're lucky day, however, because he gets himself hooked well enough so that you end up boating the pike. You place the big fish in your cooler and start dreaming of how great the trophy will look mounted in your den. Later that day, a DNR officer pulls up, sees your huge pike and asks how you caught him. Will the truth set you free or will the truth place you firmly in a pile of deep doo-doo? And in the name of ethical sportsmanship, should you have thrown the fish back?Thunderstick"
531838,Guest,2003-06-02 04:21:00,0,Its an illegal fish. It's up to you how you handle the questions. It's a perfect mount though with the small walleye in his chops and your lure there as well.
531839,Guest,2003-06-02 07:38:00,0,"Photo, measure, release and get a fiberglass mount."
531840,czy42strokes,2003-06-02 07:42:00,419,"With the quality of replica mounts I don't understand why a sportsman would want to keep a Trophy fish, I am in the photo, measure length, girth and release camp."
531841,Guest,2003-06-02 10:26:00,0,"You put it on the wall to impress yourself. You put it back in the water carefully so that it can contribute to the gene pool so your grandkids can be impressed with what they catch. Your call as to what is more important to you. Catch and release on all trophies is the way to keep fishing improving. ""Its not what we accomplish, but how we accomplish it that your remembered for.IA Walley"
531843,Guest,2003-06-02 10:42:00,0,"I have to agree with the Catch and Release/Replica Mount crowd but am curious about what makes it illegal? If they're both legal size fish, where's the infraction?"
531844,Guest,2003-06-02 10:50:00,0,"The argument is that the pike was caught using a gamefish, i.e., the walleye, and it's illegal to use a gamefish as bait."
531845,Smitty,2003-06-02 11:17:00,1934,"Technically, the walleye was your bait (which is illegal)."
531842,Go_Fish,2003-06-02 11:27:00,28,I can't understand why you would keep the fish.....don't replicas look as good as skin mounts? Especially when you can say to your kids that the big one is still out there for them to catch.Go_Fish
531846,Guest,2003-06-02 11:55:00,0,"I'm sure someone will put me in my place here (won't be the first time), but I call BS on the illegal issue. You weren't fishing with a gamefish. You didn't hook the walleye to your hook with the intention of fishing for a pike. Had you been using the walleye for bait you would have been in violation. This is really no different than catching a musky prior to the opener when your fishing for pike....no harm no foul. There isn't an MNR officer in Ontario that would right you a ticket for such an occurance."
