We slayed them up there. I was able to land 301 for the week, but no real big ones. Mostly walleye and pike with an occasional whitefish and perch. Already made reservations for next year. Where do you fish at when you're there? Fishing was really good at the Oba with the exception of Thursday. Watched a guy catch a 9+ lb walleye from the mouth of the Oba. Real nice fish. Have you had any luck in Boot Bay? I know they take a lot of big northern outta there but I haven't had much luck at that spot yet. Let me know"
531830,ketchanenny,2003-06-02 17:54:00,3,"Was at Pine Portage from Tuesday through Friday of last week, flying out on Saturday morning. This was my 9th time on Kaby and I have to say it was by far the best trip of all. Fishing was tops, every morning we fished the mouth of the OBA for a couple of hours to get our shore lunch. One day, I alone caught 30 walleye's in the 2 hours. I did not see the 9+, but I did hear about it later that night. Did the rest of our fishing in Alligator Alley and Schist Bay. Used to fish Boot Bay when we stayed at Kaby Lodge. The Boot was my hot spot but we did not try it this year as the fishing was so good in the upper part of the lake. We also made our reservations for next year. Flying into Pine on May 24th for four days.:7"
531831,jzstiff,2003-06-03 07:36:00,188,"Where ia Alligator Alley located? Never even heard of it. I spent much of my time down around Everson's as the fishing is pretty good around there and also a lot of time around Whitefish Bay (caught a 5 lb walleye there last year) as well as around Algamik Island. Yes sir, this had to be one of the best years for fishing in a while. I've made my reservations as well for the week long trip again."
531832,Fred,2003-06-04 07:51:00,32,Have you ever gone later in the year? We go at the end of July and haven't done very well in the Alligator ally/Shist bay part of the lake. When fishing the middle of the lake we have done well for walleye in Davy's bay and around Elmers Island. For pike around 20# island.

531834,jzstiff,2003-06-04 09:32:00,188,"Never gone later in the year, but one of my friends (he's gone for the past 32 years) has gone in the past. I like the second week of the season for a couple of reasons (can't wait that long to get up there, hopefully miss the bugs, get there about the time the spawn is done, tho that didn't happen this year as ice-out was May 12th and most of the males we caught and released were still milking). We also like to bring our own salted shiners and fatheads and this helps to keep costs down quite a bit. If you go later in the year, the fish won't even look at salted minnows. I would like to try it later in the year some time, but everyone I know goes early. I only like to use Everson's, because I like to cook my own fish and it's cheaper that way. Plus, when I cook, I can determine what time the meals are so I get to fish when I want. In relation to the map, where is Alligator Alley? Never been to Elmer Island either. I'll have to check it out. I finally brought my GPS this year and was able to mark some great spots for use in years to come."
531835,Fred,2003-06-04 10:04:00,32,If you click on the dots you get a map that has the island and bay names. It shows Alligator ally also.
531836,jzstiff,2003-06-05 19:59:00,188,"Thanks Fred, I finally figured it out and saved it to my computer. If you ever get the chance, try trolling around Whitefish Bay. Have pulled a couple of really nice walleye out of there."
