531920,Guest,2003-06-03 08:41:00,0,I have a friend who is thinking of going to Everson's with a group and asked if I knew anything about the lodge and lake. I don't so I told him I would ask on this message board. Any comments?? Thanks

531922,jzstiff,2003-06-05 20:01:00,188,I have gone to Everson's the past three years. I'm a pretty good friend of Rich and can provide any info you might need. E-mail me at [email protected] and I'll be more than happy to answer any questions I can.
