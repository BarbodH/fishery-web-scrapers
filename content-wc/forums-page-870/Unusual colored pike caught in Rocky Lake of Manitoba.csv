531975,Newby,2003-06-06 14:41:00,148,Could be a tigermusky. A cross between a pike and musky. They stock them in lakes around my house. I have not caught one so I couldnt tell you what they look like. Just a thought.
531963,Guest,2003-06-04 16:56:00,0,"Just returned from a very enjoyable fishing trip in northern Manitoba. My fishing partner caught a very unusual colored pike while fishing in Rocky Lake. It had solid colored sides and not the usual chain pattern sides. We thought it might have been a small musky, but we did not see the normal musky tiger stripes, either. It was about a 2 lbs pike which he released after we photographed it. We are mystified by the colors. Have any of you caught such a fish? p.s., If I can figure out how to post the picture, I will do so."

531966,Guest,2003-06-05 09:19:00,0,"The pike had a pale blue side with light pink above the belly...reminded me of a rainbow trout color.p.s., still trying to figure out how to post the picture."
531967,Guest,2003-06-05 09:29:00,0,"Rocky Lake is clear (not stained) water. If you give me your email address, I will send you a digital picture of the pike."
531968,bigfish1965,2003-06-05 10:05:00,3210,email me at [email protected] . I'm sure its a Silver ( sometimes called Blue) Pike. I can host it so others can see it.
531969,Guest,2003-06-05 10:49:00,0,The pictures have been sent. Thanks for hosting...WA Angler
531970,Thumper,2003-06-05 11:17:00,133,"Did you count the number of pores on the ""chin"" of the fish? That seems to be the most reliable method of dividing pike from musky. If it had fewer than 6 pores on each side of the jaw, then it was probably a Northern.I bet some of the guys on the Musky Central side of the board would be interested in the pic when BigFish posts the URL.- RT"
531971,bigfish1965,2003-06-05 11:32:00,3210,"Here's the URL's for the pictures. Probably a Silver Pike, though it has a few characteristics of a musky, I'm voting for pike.http://home.cogeco.ca/~robanion/imag...20View%202.jpghttp://home.cogeco.ca/~robanion/imag...ual%20Pike.jpg"
531972,rpieske,2003-06-05 15:50:00,1276,My vote is for the silver pike also. Look at the base where the tail fins begin.
