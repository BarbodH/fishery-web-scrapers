532017,fishnut,2003-06-06 06:50:00,46,I'm leaving for Objibway Camp at Chamberlain Narrows in a couple of days and as I know the levels are as much as 8 ft low I'm wondering if anyone has tried to get into Scaler Lake. How about China and India? I suspect these are not accessable. Wapesi should be Ok. Any current condition info as well as places to fish would be appreciated. Both Pike & W.E.Thanks in advance.Fishnut <'((((<
532018,eyewitness,2003-06-06 10:07:00,680,I thought I read that the channel into Scaler is only a few inches deep in spots. Although if a guy can get back to China or India the fish will be concentrated big time. Wish I was there. Wapezi might be a close call getting through the timbers coming into the main channel. With the water that low I'd try that deep hole at the turn in the channel too. Please post a report when you return. I'm heading up in July and would like the skivy on the conditions and how the bite was.

532022,Guest,2003-06-06 12:09:00,0,"was up that way last week and the fishing was good by 3 sisters reefs water temp was 53-56, and the water is very low, you cannot get thru the rags, need to go thru devils elbow. went pass chamberlain narrows, did not try scaler the water has to be to low, when we got to the landings(deception bay and hudson) could not believe what the lake looked like. the good news is not many people around and lots of fish, 10- 20 ft was good for eyes with wind blowing into a pt or island area.anie from the beer store in dryden"

532023,Guest,2003-06-06 16:02:00,0,Look out for a big sand bar cutting across the lake just North of Tom's landing. I hit it at wot. There is a rock reef past that just North by the last point before you turn left to go to Wapesi on the right side of the lake as if you are going to Birch narrows.
