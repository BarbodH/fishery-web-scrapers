531778,Rich B,2003-05-31 19:30:00,1081,"Aaron,I've fished the lake a number of times in the fall, and once in earlyJune a few years back - you'll like the lake.All things being equal, try the shoreline/flats areas in 6'-10' withworm harnesses, or jig and worm. There are several areas that are ""stump fields"" that hold nice walleye - one is right beside theRed Pine Camp, just down the lake from your camp.You'll want to bring in worms, and minnows. The walleye in this lake are on the bottom - a good sandy point area to check out is ""American Point"". First thing in the morning and then again at mid evening, start in 5' of water and back troll out on the sides of the point with a jig and crawler or minnow. Talk with the guys at your camp - you may want to go up the main river and fish some of the back bays off the river just before you get to the dam. You'll see these bays on your way in to the camp (it's a nice ride in). As well, there's another ""feeder"" river that has a falls. Is a little bit of a run, but in the Spring time it's got good fishing around the base of the falls and down from them.Lady Lake Evelyn also has nice smallmouth bass as well as large northerns. This lake has a number of great shore lunch areas - enjoy your week !Be sure to post how you do up at this camp, and how your fishing was. Rich B"

531780,Guest,2003-06-06 18:59:00,0,Does anyone how how to boat in to the lake? I would like to take my 14' and camp on crown land.
531781,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-06-06 19:33:00,618,Not hard to get your boat on lady evelyn. You launch on the river at the platform where the outfitters pick up their guests. Go up and across the river to the dam. Tie off to the dock and walk up the hill. There is a guy with a truck and trailer that willpull you up and launch you in the lake. I don't know what he charges.
