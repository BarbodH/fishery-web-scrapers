531761,Ivy,2003-06-03 09:02:00,556,I'm truly sorry to hear about your loss. 60 is way to early to lose someone ( if there is a good time ? )We are facing the loss of our Father as he is fighting Lung Cancer. We have a Fly-out trip planned for the Fall and it looks rather doubtfull if he will make it.I am sure you have a lot of great memories with your brother. Remember the good times you had and hold onto them. Pass on those memories by creating your own with your kids. Enjoy life and all the things it has to offer.Ivy
531762,Guest,2003-06-03 12:50:00,0,"Hoosiercanadian: Sorry to hear of your loss. You know, that day will come for all of us , some of us way too soon. I'm leaving for a walleye trip to Quebec on Saturday, with 7 of my best buddies in the whole world. Sadly, a few have said that this will be their last trip as a group due to $$$ considerations. I can't beleieve what I'm hearing....Money????? I'm not rich by any means, but the $500-$600 for a week in paradise is trivial. Whenever we get together, the stories and laughs and adventures we've had are worth more to me than all the $$ in the world. Even some of my co-workers sigh and tell me how they'd like to go on a trip like this....I always say DO IT! Don't dream about it, what are ya waitng for? The time will come for me when I can no longer make the trek to Canada in pursuit of the mighty walleye....but not as long as I'm physically able to go! Hoosier, hook up with someone new and continue the traditions that you and your brother enjoyed....by chance, your brother didn't have a son or daughter that would like to experience what gave their Dad so much joy? I'll raise a toast to you and your brother as I sit by the campfire next week."
531763,Guest,2003-06-03 16:30:00,0,I was really sorry to hear about your brother. I never had a brother myself but often wish I did. I'm heading to Sturgeon Lake July 3rd. Judy at White Sands said to tell you Hi. Maybe you can give me some pointers before I go.
531764,BuckeyeWilly,2003-06-03 17:14:00,41,"Hoosier, thanks for sharing your heart and putting things in perspective. It made me think of all my Canadian trips through the years. Two of my fishing partners are no longer with us. One of those was my dad who passed away in 94. This year I will be going with my son and your post made me realize how special this trip should be. Thank You."
531765,Guest,2003-06-04 22:04:00,0,"Thanks again to all you guys, it would make me feel good if someone read these posts and called up a loved one and said LETS GO, if that happened that would be great. I really owe my love for Canada to my Dad who passed away in 86. My parents started taking us kids to Canada when i was only 6 months old. Every summer usually around late july it was time to load up the car and head north. Man as a kid it was the best vacation , I couldn't wait, stopping at rest parks along the way, getting out the coleman stove, eating my Mom's deviled eggs, fresh garden tomatoes, sometimes we would bring up sugar corn and have it with fresh walleye, you couldn't beat it. We've fished all over Ontario, even took a few trips to Jan Lake Saskatchewan, the fishing there was incredible! Once i got married and had kids i started going up twice a year when possible, once with my kids and once with my brother, i'm 49 now and have taken around 80 trips to Canada, and will continue to go until i take my last breath. I still get as excited about going as when i was 12, and in my passing, i've picked out a beautiful rapids in northwestern Manitoba full of fat big walleyes, that they can sprinkle my ashes in and float downstream. Yes I admit to being obcessed with fishing up north, but when i'm there i'm truly alive , and all you guys keep taking your family and friends and make new memories!"
531766,Guest,2003-06-04 22:17:00,0,"IndianKentuck, good to hear you are heading up to White Sands, they are very nice people there. Like i said before you will have a tough time catching walleye in Sturgeon, i'm not sure the locals can catch them in there, but it is a very good lake trout lake, and also good northern. There are many good walleye lakes up in the bush, up logging roads, but you will not be able to get you boat into them. You will have to have Gary at camp put a 14 foot boat in for you. They are very reasonable and will take care of you. I'll bring a map down and mark all the good lakes for you."
531767,Northern Manitoban,2003-06-04 23:41:00,195,"hoosiercanadian,sorry to hear your loss.I hope you make it up to Northern Manitoba this summer as the fishing right now has been better then it has in years.Water levels are low.Fishing is the biggest high.Good luck! NM"
531768,Guest,2003-06-05 10:30:00,0,"Deepest sorrow on the loss of your brother. I've lost some good friends who were in their 40's in the past year or two and the funerals make real good reality checks for us to re-examine the things that are really important in life, and work, while necessary, is nowhere near the top of the list. Go fishing and remember the wonderful times you had together. From a fellow hoosier, my condolences.""Life is not a dress rehersal."" Not sure where I heard that, but it sure rings true."
531751,Guest,2003-05-30 22:34:00,0,"Don't want to bum anyone out, just needed to get a few things off my chest. Today was one of the most difficult days in my life , as I buried my oldest brother today. He was only 60 and should have had many more years of fishing left, but about 9 years ago started to lose the use of his arms, then eventually his legs, then he was bedridden, but had an crisp mind till the end. He loved fishing in Canada, and was as obcessed with it as I am, i'ts all we talked about when we got together. We both have stacks of maps of lakes all over Ontario, and Manitoba. The last few trips we were able to take were in the Savant Lake area, and camping trips on the English river, we also caught many nice smallmouth on Nymn Lake close to Atikokan. I will treasure those memories forever! His dream was to have his own cabin on a lake, and go up and spend the summer, he didn't get a chance to achieve that in this life, I can only hope he's up there now trolling for walleye in his lund , or casting into a nice rapids. I can only say he was the bravest man I will ever know, and I am going to miss him . We all need to be a little selfish in this life, don't put off that trip any longer, call up your brother, or pack up your kids load up the truck, hook up the boat, and GO, as often as you can afford. A Canadian map was tucked under his folded hands , and I put a card of Bear Paw nightcrawler harneses in the drawer of his casket. We played a cd that had loons calling , and the funeral home engraved a walleye chasing a minnow shaped plug, on the underside of the lid. So don't ever feel guilty about enjoying that next trip to Canada, because life is short and precious. I miss you bro, catch a good one for me!"
531752,winchester70,2003-05-31 00:07:00,0,"Hey buddy,I know what you are going through.My daughter passed away at age six,she loved to go out in the boat and fish.I can still hear her "" Lets go faster daddy,lets go faster""My friend,that was 23 years ago.God I miss her!I'm sure that your brother is in heaven right now helping Jennifer put a worm on her hook.Take care,keep your chin up and God bless."
531753,Guest,2003-05-31 04:49:00,0,"Sad for you, and as the song say ""I can only imagine"" your brothers new home...better than even the great white north.A good message for all of about ready to head north with family"
531754,5 Stroke,2003-05-31 08:11:00,0,"Hoosiercanadian. I'd like to express my deepest sympathies. Terrible loss. I found myself staring at the casket of a very close friend a couple of weeks ago. He had 78 great years,I knew him for 10 of those years, during which we shared our passion of fishing, especially trolling for steelhead/salmon on Lake Michigan. The sobs were uncontrollable as they lowered his casket. Could we have spent more time together? The answer is always yes. I'll never forget his face when he would proudly announce ""FISH ON!"" and I would look behind the boat to see an 8 lb steelie jumping as he lunged for the rod. That moment helped to once again realize how very important my friends and loved ones are to me, and how valuable our time together is. Up until that moment I was on the fence about an opportunity to fish Minnitaki with my best friend. (I immerse myself in my work too much at times-but we had an impending mad rush for our main customer which has since largely resolved itself.) So...soon as I got home from the funeral I called my buddy to give him the thumbs up. LAKE MINNITAKI HERE WE COME. JUNE 7-13,2003"
531755,Rich B,2003-05-31 19:37:00,1081,"Thanks for posting, despite your grief on losing your brother.All too often, many of us get too wrapped up in our work or ourselves, and lose sight of what is really important.It's been said (and I believe it's true) that most folks late intheir lives don't put much value on the homes, vehicles, boats, etcthey've owned, but rather on the ""relationships"" they have withtheir loved ones.A good friend told me the other day - ""there's no rewind button onour lives"" - so true.Faith, Family, Friends & Fishing !Rich B"
531756,Guest,2003-06-01 05:29:00,0,"hoosiercanadian, my condolences to you and your family for your loss. You have many wonderful memories of the fishing trips you and your brother took that can never be taken away. My best fishing buddy is my Dad. My Dad turns 73 this Oct.10th. I love my Dad. We have been going to Canada on our father/son fishing trip, for the last 7 years. It's the BEST thing we have ever done. We started out going for 1 week in June now we go for 2 weeks in the fall. Sept.20th thru Oct.4th this year. 4 months away and we're getting tackle and gear ready. I think it's a little too early to start packing the truck! We have made many great memories over the last 7 years and I pray that we are able to make many more in the years ahead. Like you said, life is too short so just GO on that fishing trip. You'll be glad you did. We're glad we did!!!"
531757,bigfish1965,2003-06-01 06:22:00,3210,"My deepest sympathies to you and your family. It was the words of my favourite fishing partner and the man with patience of a saint, the one who taught me to fish, my grandfather, who said, "" No one has ever been on their death bed and said they wished they spent more time at work."" It was in that vein that I coined the signature that I've always had here....."
531758,Guest,2003-06-02 20:39:00,0,"Amen to that one bigfish! Gofish, you are very lucky to still have your Dad around to fish with, keep taking those trips. And thanks to all for the kind words, this site is great, and helps keep me sane, in an insane world."
531759,Guest,2003-06-03 07:15:00,0,"Hoosier, thanks for an appropriate and timely reminder about the important things in life. I am sorry for your loss. I printed this out and sent it to my mrother who is 10 years older than me. I have been going to Lac Suel for 15 years and he and I have never went north together. We always talk about it but I go with the same group always. I think I am going to start going twice a year. In factI leave Friday with my normal group and again 6/28 with a friend from Illinois I hardly get to see but every 3 or 4 years. Next summer I hope big brother and I head north. It was kind of you to post your letter. God Bless your family."
531760,Peanut,2003-06-03 08:32:00,929,"I am very sorry for your loss...I don't know what more I can say.Also, thanks for sharing - as you can see, many here, myself included, have been reminded of life's true priorities - I think your brother is proud that he was the author of something good, even in his passing. All the best to you and your family,derrek."
