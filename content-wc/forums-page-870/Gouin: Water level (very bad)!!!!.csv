531741,McQ,2003-06-06 06:46:00,615,If you have difficulty accepting my report then give them a call yourself (819) 974-8851 ask for Adrian.
531742,Guest,2003-06-06 07:24:00,0,"McQ, I did not intend to question your reports. I have been following them closely. I was simply wondering if ""most likely"" meant he was closed now for the year or if he was going to wait til the 15th as someone had reported before. I could not call them after I read your report because I am work. Again I appreciate your reports and meant no harm. It doesn't really matter though as our trip has been called off. Thanks anyways.Josh"

531731,McQ,2003-06-02 07:10:00,615,"While waiting to get the updates on the Gouin conditions I forgot to mention maps that are available for the Gouin - both east and west. You can order online at http://www.trak.qc.ca and most of the tackle shops in Quebec will have them. These charts show all the original lake beds that were flooded over and will emphasize the hazardous spots that require caution.The Gouin charts are under the pull down menu ""Center of Quebec""."
531732,Guest,2003-06-02 09:53:00,0,Just hope that people will respect their quotas and will not empty the holes where their must be a concentration of fishs.N
531733,McQ,2003-06-02 09:59:00,615,UPDATE:I just spoke with the operators of L'Oasis de Gouin who are situated on Baie de Chapman. They are in full operation with all their houseboats in the water. The report includes this information for those who wanted to bring their own boats - the ramp is not accessible so be prepared to use a camp boat. Access to the island lodge will take a few more minutes to accomodate the extra distance to be trucked in (about 10 minutes). Lac Brochu is easily accessed - Baie de Chapman requires a truck ride to access.The fishing is concentrated and very good - don't overfish it.
531734,McQ,2003-06-02 15:20:00,615,The operator of the Walleye Club on Baie de Sud just called - he is in full operation - this bay is one of the safest on the Gouin and he has fishable water to the north and south. The fishing report indicates the big fish are on - 9# walleye yesterday and a 22# pike. This place has a new road from Parent or you can fly-in. You can get your own boat in to this place.
531735,nemio,2003-06-02 20:14:00,96,Thank you McQ for the update. I was probably in one of the worst place on the Gouin. With your infos I will book a trip on the end of June.
531736,McQ,2003-06-04 05:46:00,615,"This report is from the operator of Achimac, located in the most eastern (north / south) bay of the Gouin about 3 miles from the dam. They started-up operations on May 31 - water levels are up 4' from their low point. Boat launch is OK for client boats and the walleye are biting. He still needs to launch one of the houseboats but all the cottages are fully occupied through June - some space is available in July and you can make your pick of dates in August.I'm hoping that other operators will make further reports - the situation is improving but check with your outfitter regularly."
531737,McQ,2003-06-04 08:23:00,615,"I just spoke with Normand Ouellette, presdent of the outfitters assn. for the Gouin. He operates Air Mont Laurier and has an outfit on Lac du Male. Baie Adolphe is the the only area of the Gouin that is experiencing low water preventing operation. Some of the operators have had to modify their outfits but are in operation. The water levels are increasing about 1 1/2 feet a week through natural drainage - more rain will speed up the process.The low water has presented increased navigational hazards on Lac du Male but the fishing has been spectacular, they are having to place limits on the daily catch and insist on C&R. Knowing this area as I do I'm not surprised."
531738,McQ,2003-06-05 13:56:00,615,"Today's report isn't good for those of you who have reservations with L""Apelle de Hibou - I was told by the operator that they most likely will not resume operations this year. They will take the opportunity to improve their operation and will be back next year with a much improved facility.From my own perspective - this outfit is one of two the furthest from the dam - about 40 miles - the water levels aren't rising quick enough for them to get much benefit from the June, early July rush so will work on their cabins to improve an already fine set-up.The other operator in the same area ""Martin"" still is to make a decision."
531739,Guest,2003-06-05 20:24:00,0,"the information that MCQ posted tonight is correct- Hibou and martins are the two most affected be the low water and have had to cutback operations- I am in touch with an outfitter on the Gouin every other day. the water is back to about 12ft below normal and still rising , but very slowly, 6-10 inch a day- the camps on the bays of sarana, mattawa and plumenton are all open and doing very well. it is abit more difficult to get around some spots, but everyone is coping quite well. anyone with resevations at camps other than the two mentioned will have very few problems. all the surrounding lakes like o-sullivan , herbert, panama are ok and seem to be at normal depth.if i hear of any changes i will pass them along 30 MORE DAYS TILL LAK HERBERT- CANT WAIT!!!"
531740,Guest,2003-06-06 05:57:00,0,"Has ""Hibou"" closed for sure or are they still going to give it til the 15th? I don't know what I'll do if they close, I'm already too worked up for the trip. Thanks for the updates."
531721,Guest,2003-05-30 13:20:00,0,"For those who are going to the Gouin, better call your outfitter and ask them, how's the water on their part of the reservoir. I had to come back without being able to fish. The level is 22 ft. below normal, some outfitters are shutting down the business for the season others are OK depending where they are located on the reservoir. La Pointe aux dor√©es seem ok and a few others.I don't what going to be the impact on the fish? Anybody can answer to that?"
531722,McQ,2003-05-30 14:35:00,615,This is much worse than the original reports we were getting. What is going to happen is the fish will be stacked up in all the original lakes and will be sitting ducks - hope the fisherman don't get too nutsy and overfish this situation.
531723,Guest,2003-05-30 14:42:00,0,Sorry to here of that nemio.What part of gouin did you go to?Have you heard about conditions at Martin or L'appel Du Hibou?
531724,McQ,2003-05-30 15:03:00,615,"I just called L'Hibou they have cancelled all reservations up to the 15th of June - Martin has the same pronlem - they need an increase in the water level of about 2' to get the operation running. They will be in touch with me regularly - so I will post as the situation improves.Lac de Male is navigatable but you have to be real cautious. There is no access to Sarana or Mattawa. Baie de Sud is OK. I'll have more info on the outfitters east of this report sometime tomorrow. They are on radio phones so communication is spotty.It's raining there now and if it continues a few days, conditions will improve rapidly."
531725,Vitreum,2003-05-30 15:24:00,221,you guys can have some of this ****ed rain we're having down here in maryland. today was the first nice dry day we've had for a month.
531726,Vitreum,2003-05-30 15:28:00,221,guess i shouldn't complain after 2-3 years of drought.
531727,McQ,2003-05-30 16:06:00,615,"It's been raining here in Ottawa on & off for the last 10 days, today is the first sunshine we've seen in almost 2 weeks - the Gouin is 270 miles north and they only have had 2 days of rain."
531728,Guest,2003-05-30 20:24:00,0,"I hope it rains up there every day.Those of us who have reservations with outfitters on gouin will have to play it by ear.As bad as i feel for myself and other fishermen its the outfitters that have it bad. These guys and gals make their living off from this industry and they are at the mercy of the weather and the ""#####"" operators."
531729,Peekay,2003-05-30 21:01:00,7,"Bill, would appreciate the updates on the eastern side when you get the info, Oasis de Gouin in particular if you hear anything.....saves the outfitters from fielding phone calls from us when I'm sure they've got more than enuff on their plates.PK"
531730,nemio,2003-05-30 21:42:00,96,"You better call, from what I heard l'Oasis du Gouin got a lot of problems."
