531924,Guest,2003-06-04 10:38:00,0,I have friends up there this week. I will post an update after they get back. How soon are you leaving? Which camp are you staying at?
531926,Guest,2003-06-04 13:35:00,0,I was up at Little Vermiilion Lake on opening weekend. It's about 20 minutes north of Red Lake by Float plane. The water was 3-4 ft down. The owner told us they had plenty of snow but when the warm weather came it was 70 degrees. Meaning that most of the snow evaporated before it even got in the lakes. Normally the Big pike are in the backs of bays and the mouths of rivers at that time. This year they were already out to the points and on the sharper drop offs.Hope this helps.Adam

The water was down perhaps a couple of feet but you could still get a boat thru to hidden lake with a bit of paddling. The walleye bite was outstanding, especially the first few days as it rained constantly. It was my third trip up and I never caught as many large fish as consistently did this year. We had a number of days where the average fish was about 23"". Other days we caught huge numbers of 13 to 17"" fish. Larest eye of the trip was a 31 1/2"" beauty the last day. Most of the fish were deeper than we expected, 13' to 20'. Tons of pike also, and they were extremely aggressive, though not many big fish. The largest we got was 22lb, only a hand full were over 15lbs.Can't wait until next year.Good LuckGaryB"
