531937,IaDave,2003-06-03 14:26:00,476,How did you do opening week after we saw you at McDougall Falls? When you saw us anchored in the river that day the walleyes were stacked right in that spot. A lot of eaters but nothing huge. It was a good chance to try some different things. Thanks for the great tip on Alcona Bay. We went there the next day and had a blast.
531938,Guest,2003-06-04 09:47:00,0,"Hey IaDave...good meeting you up in Canada. Isn't it nice this board allows things like that to happen.We didn't do squat at McDougall, just a few small ones. Tried drifting along the northwest bank and picked up a few. The falls wasn't what I expected. However, it was a great trip to the falls. We seen a mother moose and baby swimming one of the narrows on the way up. It was really neat. The baby was going under and the mother went back into the water, got behind the baby and brought it back to the top. Something you don't see everyday.Glad you did good at Alcona Bay. Never did make it over there. Be sure and tell me more about it. I'll leave my email at the end of this message. We got into slotters and above right on Abrams about a half mile from the campground. Again, thanks for a tip from a fellow fisherman. Had a blast.Just returned home from an outpost in Lac Seul yesterday. We were there for five days starting last Wednesday, week ago. The lake is full of walleyes. My biggest was a 28"" 8 # beauty. Caught some big northern up to 15#. My fishing buddy and I probably boat upward to 100 fish a day. Large majority below the slot, but when you found them concentrated you could get some nice fish. Seems the little ones would get the bait before a bigger one had a chance. Kinda like crappie fishing here in the Ozarks.Again, good talking and meeting you. My email is: [email protected]Later...eyesnatcher"
