531888,Birdhunter_007,2003-06-05 14:53:00,2,Just came back yesterday from Pickle Lake area. They have only had 2 rainstorms so far this spring. Fire danger is quite high. There was a fire north of us couple days ago. Water levels are 3-4 ft low. Drive slow in the boat and watch for rocks. Fishing was fantastic but a warm spring up there moved the walleyes out of the rivers where they spawned and back into the lakes. We caught lots in 2-12 ft of water. Good Luck.
