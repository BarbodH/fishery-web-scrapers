Our fly-out isn't until August and I can't wait.And to be perfectly honest, I could give a hoot about the Canadian goverment. As most Canadians probably don't care about mine. We have a business relationship. Ivy pays his hard earned American money to a hard working Canadian Outfitter, he fly's us into a remote cabin and we catch the Walleye. We are both happy. Ivy pays his hard earned American money for some outstanding Canadian beer. We are both happy.So I can only conclude that if Canadians and Americans would only drink and fish, the world would be a better place.Ivy"

532014,Ivy,2003-06-06 07:14:00,556,Skeeters are terrorists and I think the Goverment should do something about them. Ha! Maybe I should have a Labatt's at lunch!Ivy

532016,Guest,2003-06-06 14:15:00,0,"Ivy,Fish 100% of the time....are you serious. I've been on many trips with you and the time you spend in and out of the cooler makes up for at least 50%. You drink to the weather, drink to the Indian women and even drink to the big fish I catch. I agree let's forget about politics and work and just go fishing. August can't get here soon enough.Keep the Blue on ice!BigFish"
