Can anyone recommend a good store in the area, preferable south/southwest side of town or out towards Upsala? Also, in another thread, someone mentioned pre-ordering bait. Is this generally advisable? Lastly, about how many leeches do you get in a pound?"
547052,Snowball,2005-04-16 14:07:00,28,"Some good Tackle stores in Thunder Bay: (1) D & R Sporting Goods 485 Memorial Ave. 345-3323 (2) Canadian Tire Assoc Stores 1221 Arthur St. W 475-4234 (office hardware&sports) 939 Fort William Rd. 623-1999 (all depts.) There is such a demand for bait on the Season Opening (everyone is out fishing at the same time) that the smart Fishermen order their bait in order to assure it is available). The rest of the season there is NO problem with bait. In the U.S., leeches are commonly sold by the pound, while in Canada, leeches are usually sold by the dozen. One pound will generally contain 10 to 12 dozen average-sized leeches.http://www.fishontario.com/articles/jumbo-leeches/ Hope this helps you out. Good Fishing and have a safe trip. Regards, Snowball"
