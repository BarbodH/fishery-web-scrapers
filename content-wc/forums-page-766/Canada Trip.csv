I would like to go somewhere that has a two or three bedroom cabin with boats furnished that can provide us some great walleye fishing. Smallies wouldn't hurt either. Not into northern fishing but I can be flexible. Not looking for expensive as is everyone but not afraid to spend a little to get a nice place. It is our 40th anyhow. Please send your suggestions to my email address as I don't get enough time to come back here that often and August is not that far away. Email [email protected] Thanks, Smokeydean"
