Mattice Lake Outfitters are simply the best outfitter I have ever used or heard of others using. The accomodations are excellent, as is the service. I have not stayed at Guerin, but I would imagine the fishing there is similar to Pringle and/or Vick where I have stayed 5 years. The eyes will run from 14"" to 23"". Average size for us has been right around 19""-20"" each year. Pike fishing is quite different from Vick to Pringle. Vick has alot of fish in the 22""-34"" range. Fewer pike but bigger on Pringle. We have caught several 40"" plus fish there, with plenty of 35""-39"" thrown in. Jig and twister or jig and half a Gulp crawler have worked well. Bright colors usually the best, however if the mayflies are hatching a more neutral color works better (grayish, greenish, brownish, etc.) Don and Annette are great people and what they tell you about the fishing is factual. You will have a great trip. Let us know how you did. This year I am staying on the Ogoki Reservoir the last week of June. MLO will be outfitter once again. I have not fished here previously, but am anticipating bigger 'eyes and pike."

Any colors significantly better than others? Presentations, i.e. trolling, jigging, rigging, etc. that you had success with? Which areas of the reservoir did you fish? Can you catch fish close to camp? Thanks, are you going with MLO again this year?"
