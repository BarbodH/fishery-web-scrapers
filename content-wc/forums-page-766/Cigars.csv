546908,Hammerhead Herb,2005-04-09 14:19:00,259,JR Cigars is a good company. I also use Thompson Cigar Company www.thompsoncigar.com and Finck Cigar Company www.finckcigarcompany.com out of Texas. All of those are fine companies and I have ordered from them for our Canadian trips.
547112,Thumper,2005-04-18 17:05:00,133,"I appreciate all of the cost saving ideas, guys. I'll probably try some of these for our state-side fishing trips this summer. I think that the Canadian trip needs to have some Cuban cigars, though. Our last trip up there, 2 years ago, we got some really good Cuban cigars that were Cuban tobacco but rolled in Canada. They were pretty inexpensive, maybe $10US for a 5-pack. They were about the Corona size and came in a silver-foil type box. I sure wish I could remember their name - they were great! - Rick"
547122,Guest,2005-04-19 05:45:00,0,I think those are called Swisher Sweets. They are great in cherry or vanilla. Hard to find though.
547126,FIB,2005-04-19 06:57:00,23,"I think the silver boxed Cubans are called ""REAS"". They come in 5 packs and two different sizes. Pretty good unique flavor, and inexpensive."
546671,Thumper,2005-03-29 19:15:00,133,"Hi, guys. I've got a fly-in booked where we leave 6am Saturday morning. So, we need our outfitter to pick us up the essentials we can't bring with us from the US. Things like beer, potatoes and CIGARS. I have no idea what kind of cigars to ask our outfitter for. I'd like mild and inexpensive. Suggestions?"
546672,Guest,2005-03-29 19:39:00,0,"Good luck finding cheap cigars in Canada. if you want cheap, bring them from the states."
546675,Guest,2005-03-29 20:01:00,0,Swisher Sweets?????
546682,Guest,2005-03-29 21:54:00,0,"To give you an idea of tobacco prices, a carton of cigarettes was pushing $80 last year... good thing I don't smoke. Agate"
546684,Bryan Baker,2005-03-30 04:52:00,6,"the convenience store by us carries about 50 different kinds. he has some $80 cohibas in there but also some $5 to $7 good upmans etc. tell your purchase to buy you some cuban, be sure to say cuban as canada has a few of their own, cigar for price range. they have 5 pack boxes where i am at for about $20 that are good stogies."
546687,Trailerguy,2005-03-30 06:19:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Bring some Grenaders from Walgreen's, they are Cuban seed, and reasonably priced."
546719,hawkeye,2005-03-31 18:02:00,112,"I'am almost sure you can take in fifty per person and thats what I declare with no problems. I like the ""Gaint"" Swisher Sweets and Dutch Master Presdents."
546723,Thumper,2005-03-31 21:46:00,133,"Thanks, Bryan. Those Upmann's sound affordable. I think being in Canada and all, I'll be going with something Cuban. I mean, that's the ""forbidden fruit"", right? ...and anything's better when it's forbidden! :-) - Rick"
546739,Guest,2005-04-01 17:36:00,0,"You are allowed either a carton of cigarettes, or 50 cigars per person without paying duty. Duty over 50 is not that much. The potatoes are not allowed but you can bring a weeks worth of cigars easily."
546748,Guest,2005-04-02 10:12:00,0,"My suggestion would be go to www.jrcigars.com and buy some of their 5-pack cigars. This way you can try several brands. My favorite is the El Rey del Mundo rectangulares ($10.50 FOR 5 AND $2.00 shipping). Check it out. I have had guys buy the cubans in Canada and they have not been impressed, but maybe where they were purchased the folks didn't keep them in the correct humidity. The Cubans are gona run ya about $8 bucks a pop, so with JR you can get a very good quality cigar from $2.50 and up."
