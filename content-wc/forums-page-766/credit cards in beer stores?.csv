547103,phishfearme,2005-04-18 14:40:00,1242,"anybody know if you can use credit cards in the beer stores in canada? - thanks, phish"
547104,Guest,2005-04-18 14:49:00,0,Yes you can. We always have and never had a problem. Agate
547106,Guest,2005-04-18 15:30:00,0,We've always used credit cards. Eveything I buy in canada is on credit cards. I feel you get an honest rate.. The conversion tables you see at the counter is not as accurate. good luck..
547107,Guest,2005-04-18 15:32:00,0,"I can only speak for the specific ""BEER STORE"" I go to but I have not been able to use a credit card in the ""BEER STORE"" in Kenora Ontario for as long as I can remember...and I go there every June. Unless something has changed they don't take credit cards there."
547108,Guest,2005-04-18 16:02:00,0,"The ""Beer Store"" in Dryden also does not accept credit cards, which would lead me to say that all ""Beer Stores"" are similar to Kenora and Dryden. On the other hand the LCBO, which also sells beer, does accept credit cards. The LCBO is run by the government....the beer store is operated (I believe) by the brewers. Vermilion Bay has a great LCBO with a walk-in cold room for beer. If you can find it, Red Cap Ale is bottled in the old style stubby bottles....pretty good beer too."
547110,Guest,2005-04-18 16:19:00,0,"That might be a good clarification. I have always gone to the LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario), and not the beer store. Agate"
547113,Guest,2005-04-18 17:17:00,0,The Beer Store just started accepting M/C and Visa this year chainwide... click here...http://www.thebeerstore.ca/storesandproducts/index.html see the banner? they now accept them. Gerritt.
547130,phishfearme,2005-04-19 07:47:00,1242,"here in lies the value of this board - i always thought that the LCBO and the Beer Stores were really the same thing. does anybody know if the prices are the same between the two?? thanks, phish"
547135,Guest,2005-04-19 10:42:00,0,"The diiference between the two. LCBO sells hard liquor and wine,maybe with a few different types of beer. Beer Store is strictly BEER!!!!!!"
547138,phishfearme,2005-04-19 11:13:00,1242,yah but are they both run by the government (so the prices should be the same) or like in a previous post - are the beer stores run by the beer companies? - phish
