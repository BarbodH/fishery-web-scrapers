Our group of 8 is coming up to Northwest Ontario the last week of May...the giddiness is already upon us and the Bass Pro has taken our money, (how many jigs does one man truly need?) We'll be northwest of Sioux Lookout, Fawcett Lake area...any ice out reports would be appreciated...we barely made it last year. Thanks, Rob"
