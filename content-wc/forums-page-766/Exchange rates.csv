547033,Gary_IA,2005-04-15 09:12:00,144,"Its been a while since I've been to Canada. The last time there, I paid in US currency. Any Canadian change and bills I had, I exchanged at the information centre at Fort Frances before crossing back into the US. I suppose you could do it at a Canadian Bank but the amount of Canadian money in my pocket was less than $20. As I recall the information centre rate is better than exchanging it at businesses in International Falls."
547035,Trailerguy,2005-04-15 11:24:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]When resorts advertise their rates in American funds, and you pay with Canadian funds, you will receive whatever exchange rate the resort chooses to give you, just like any other business. Most banks are trading dollars daily, they have the most current rates."
547050,Guest,2005-04-16 12:07:00,0,"Like Trailerguy said, a lot of the Visa cards will charge 3%, but I checked on my Cabelas Visa and they told me that it depends on where the card is from - what bank serves it. The good news was that the Cabelas Visa card rep. I talked to said they were only charging 1%, PLUS you get Cabelas points!!!! Regards, Jim"

After reading your postings, we found out that our credit card company does charge a 3% fee now for foreign exchanges including Canada starting this year! So, we decided not to use our credit card while in Canada! After hearing about the credit card charges we called the lodge we were staying at, Happy Day Lodge, www.happydaylodge.com and spoke with them about what exchange they would be giving to us. They explained that they call the bank in Chapleau every Friday and they set their exchange rate at the bank rate. They suggested to exchange some money at a local bank at the Sault Ste. Marie to get us to the lodge. They seem to understand the stories of unreal exchange rates that some camps and businesses charge. Definately check your camps brochures, web page or call them directly for information on exchange rates. Thanks for your information on the credit card changes, it will save us some money toward our high gas expenses!"

If anyone one has first hand knowledge on the subject bzsed onwhat is currently happening, please respond because I am sure there would be many people interested as the fishing season draws near. The conversation went something like this: It is not going to do me any good to use my credit card to pay for things in Canada because I am not going to get a break on the best exchange rate. I might as well pay cash and get what they are going to give me at the place of business that I am at. In the past, didn't people get the exchange rate of the day according to the international market? Thanks, Skrut"
546844,Trailerguy,2005-04-06 14:50:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]They probably were talking about the new fee charged by credit card companys. My Visa card basicly started charging a 3% fee on ""Foreign"" transactions and whole bunch of rules on when the they actually exchanged the money. Just another get rich scheme on their part. The best way to get the current exchange rate of the hour is visit a Canadian Bank. I use the Royal Bank of Canada which has an office in Fort Francis, the rate today is $1.20"
546860,Guest,2005-04-06 23:55:00,0,Hi. I agree. a bank will give you the best rate. the places of business will give you their rate. I remember when I was a kid and my folks would buy something the business would always make it a point to get that dime- theirs was worth a dime more than ours then. a couple years later when the tables were turned and ours was a dime more you never heard it from them about givng that extra dime back.
546863,Guest,2005-04-07 10:56:00,0,The Banks are just another business and can charge whatever they want. I found that you get a better rate from the liquor store because they're run by the Government and have to give you the current rate.
546865,Guest,2005-04-07 11:44:00,0,"I agree that the new charge on credit cards is another way for them to create income. Having said that, you do get the current exchange rate and,depending on how much your spending, the 3%($3/$100) is still cheaper than you'll experience if the cashier at the store is calculating it and more convienent than trying to exchange money at the bank or liqour store. Also better than getting back home with a pocket full of Canadian money like I always seem to do! (think I've got a jar half full in my closet right now)"
546868,Guest,2005-04-07 13:16:00,0,"The best advice given to me when I started going to Canada was to just call your lodge and see what they are offering as exchange. Some places will be within 3-4%, others may gouge you and be 10% different. If your lodge is giving within 1-3%, then paying with cash or check would be about the same as paying the service fee to your credit card company. Might as well give it to the lodge owners than Visa, right? I collect the points on my CC though and don't mind a couple percent on those big purchases that will create a lot of points. Banks on both sides of the border will buy and sell currencies for different amounts. You'd lose money over and over if you spent a day buying CDN money at a Canadian Bank and then getting back in line to convert it back to American funds. They charge a fee to handle it too. If your lodge is off by more than 5%, I'd say bring them Canadian with you or use your credit card."
546869,Guest,2005-04-07 13:21:00,0,"Also be careful if you use a Visa Check card from your checking account. Everytime you use it, it will be considered a transaction and you'll often be charged for each transaction depending on your type of account. I paid insane bank fees the first time I went on a trip and took out smaller amounts from the ATM several times. I paid the ATM fee for the machine and then the same to my bank for using an out of system."
546871,Guest,2005-04-07 13:48:00,0,Another good reason to stop at the liquor control. :) Works for me.
546872,Guest,2005-04-07 14:34:00,0,"I stop at the travel and visitor bureau across the border and exchange US for Canadian and exchange back before we leave. Everything we purchase in Canada including the motel (not the camp) is in Canadian dollars. The rate is posted daily. Sorry I don't remember the office hours for sure but I believe they close at 7:00. I don't like credit card bills when I get home, it's too depressing."
546876,Guest,2005-04-07 20:11:00,0,"That travel booth gives usually 3-5% less than the banks, you are still best to use credit card rather than worry about getting a poor exchange and messing with the Canadian change. I don't know many resorts that take Canadian funds either."
