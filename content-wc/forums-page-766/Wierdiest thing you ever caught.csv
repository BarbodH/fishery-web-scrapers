My wife caught a bicycle seat from Burt Lake trolling cranks near bottom. I was with a guy who caught one of those old galvanized minnow buckets, man did that put up a fight-Rifle river."
546991,Guest,2005-04-12 21:50:00,0,"I was guideing on day fly in lake It was hotter than #*#! but it was good fishing, we had caught all the fish we wanted so we headed back to where the plane was going to pick us up,a little early. We were sitting in the boat reflecting how good the fish was and the guys son casted up close to shore for a northern well he hooked into a full six pack of LaBatts Blue about that time the float plane came over the tree line, what a way to end a good day. Poor kid his dad wouldn't give him a beer.The pilot got one when we got back to camp."
546995,chaim52,2005-04-13 08:54:00,8,"When I was a teenager, I was fishing in at a farm pond in Iowa. I was fishing with a rapala with two sets of treble hooks. I got snagged a few feet from shore. I jerked on the line and the lure went straight for my face. I had all three hooks inbedded into my face. I walked back to my truck to look in the mirror. There was no way I was able to remove the hooks myself. So I bite the line and drove 15 miles back to town with the rapala stuck to my face. As I walked into the house, my mom (who's a nurse by the way) starts freaking out. My dad, which is an anethist, took my to the hospital and gave me a shot of anathetic in the cheek. Luckily my dad was able to remove the hooks with very little pain and no scaring."

547003,Guest,2005-04-13 17:58:00,0,"My brother's 7 year old son and I were fishing with my brother on the Spokane River at night for trout. The kid hooked something and started reeling it in. When it got a couple feet away I flashed the light on it and it was a large bat that had caught the line in it's teeth. It scared his son good because it was so close and the kid ran away into the night shrieking. We had a good laugh later about it later, he was about 12 at the time."
547004,OHIOPILOT,2005-04-13 20:41:00,19,"now that I live here in texas I get to see snakes alot on the water, while casting a rubber crawfish near shore, I thought I had a snag , but it turned out it was a Water Maccosin, it grabbed it in its mouth, luckily it wasn't hooked and it eventually spit it out after about 30 seconds of spinning and thrashing around. Cant wait to move from this snake infested, murky water, redneck Skeeter boat bass fishin dump of a state!!!!"

547019,Guest,2005-04-14 17:11:00,0,"Ohiopilot, I understand your feelings. My son and family recently moved to Midland Texas, no water Moccisons there....actually no water...but loads of rattlesnakes. We even attended a rattlesnake roundup where they had caught hundreds of them. Occasionally find them on the baseball field before little league and once in their yard. Ugh! Glad to get back to Iowa."
547037,Knutsy,2005-04-15 13:28:00,9,In the Ord River I snagged my own flannel shirt. No one in the boat realized it had fallen out of the boat a few minutes before.
547087,Guest,2005-04-18 00:15:00,0,I caught a nice custom made graphite rod with a Mitchell ultralight reel while trolling for walleye. A few of the parts in the reel were toast but the rod was in good shape. While night fishing with my brother he caught a snapping turtle that must have been close to 30 lbs. Made for an interesting release.
546969,Guest,2005-04-12 07:22:00,0,"About 20 years ago I had my then girlfriend, now wife, musky fishing near the Chip Flowage. First evening out I muffed a cast and put a 10"" Eddie Bait into the seat of her pants. As the bait hit her backside it slamed the seat of the boat with a loud bang and she let out a scream thinking she had been shot. Hook caused no lasting damage, but I'm never allowed to forget the evening, got 2 musky though."
546970,Guest,2005-04-12 07:41:00,0,"About every other year, one of us in the group (8 of us) catches a clam. The hook goes over them, they close, feels like your reeling in a 8 oz bottom bouncer. When you start catching clams, it's probably time to speed up your presentation."
546971,Mahumba,2005-04-12 08:00:00,345,"Tried jigging lake trout in 100 feet of water. I hooked into something heavy. It was like lifting a log. You know when you can't quite reel it in but you can lift it and reel in the slack. This went on for quite some time. After gaining much ground on what ever it was, I looked into the gin clear water. It looked to me to be the top of a tree. I tried another lift and the drag peeled out and the thing went about 30 feet back down. I had an expensive spoon on so I tried lifting it again. I was finally getting it to the surface when my buddy was looking over the side when he whispered, ""Oh my God"" I said, ""What?"" He said......... I see a Hand!!!! Just kidding but that would flip me out pretty bad! Ha Ha! Roger Mayer"
546973,Guest,2005-04-12 08:33:00,0,"This isn't wierd, but it's a pretty good story. A few years ago I filled in for my brother-in-law on his annual Canadian fly-in because at the last minute he couldn't get away from work. I'd never been to the lake, so he showed me a few spots on a map that had been good in the past. Because I was an outsider, I just kinda tagged along with the group the first day-and-a-half....and we didn't catch many fish. At lunch the second day I suggested we try one of the spots my brother-in-law had told me about. It was a fairly small rocky point near deep water that the other guys had forgotten about. We started nailing walleyes almost immediately. Suddenly I was a hero and I started feeling like a full-fledged member of the group. As I silently thanked my brother-in-law for tipping me off to this spot, I snagged something that felt like a stick but turned out to be a rod and reel. My boat partner recognized it as the rod my brother-in-law had lost the year before. It cleaned up amazingly well, so I put fresh line on it and returned it to him. Needless to say, he was surprised and pleased."
546975,Guest,2005-04-12 09:54:00,0,"Two years ago while casting crankbaits on Lac Seul I caught my wife in the back of the head with a Rapala. She put up a real good fight and she taught me some words that I didnt even hear during my 20 year career in the Navy. Needless to say the rest of the day was a little tense after we got the hooks out of her. In fact life has been a little tense every day since the ""Hook Up"". We dont do much casting anymore just jigging."
546980,Ivy,2005-04-12 14:27:00,556,Old poles with dead fish on them. And well there was this one thing...but the penicillin took care of it right away. Ivy
546985,Guest,2005-04-12 16:07:00,0,"A filleted walleye. Snagged it in the lip, too. Everything was there but the meat. Both sides ...skin still attached. It was about a 24 incher.....but, no fight at all.. LOL!"

546987,Guest,2005-04-12 17:36:00,0,My father took me to Canada when I was about 10. It was our first trip and we didn't have much money and could only afford a guide for a day. I snagged and old baitcasting rod and reel combo off the bottom of the lake. The guide took a look at the rig and offered to make a trade. An extra day of guiding if I gave him the rod and reel. I guess it was one time the kid (me) finally was able to pay his own way. We had a second day of great fishing. Wingman

546951,Guest,2005-04-11 15:26:00,0,Not counting fish what is the wierdiest thing you ever caught while fishing? My wife caught a metal smokers pipe a few years ago. Unfortunatly it wasnt still burning when she caught it.

546954,Guest,2005-04-11 18:52:00,0,As a kid I hooked what my cousin called a waterdog. It is a salamander that still has its gills. It was the weirdest thing for a kid. I was trying to take the hook out and it would grab me.
546958,Pooch,2005-04-11 21:01:00,4619,"Every year we catch several ""magnetic"" rocks. (Really!) Have also caugth old stringers, metal amd nylon. Old lures (several times). Other peoples jigs and broken line are common. Other stuff that I no longer can recall. Pooch"
546959,Guest,2005-04-11 21:04:00,0,"i once caught a metal stringer with three, 5# walleyes on it. It was the chain/loop type stringer and the last loop was missing and i caught it in the last chain link . Fish were still alive so released them.. It was near Minaki"
546960,OHIOPILOT,2005-04-11 21:05:00,19,"believe it or not, about 20 years or so ago while fishing with my dad, we were trolling for walleyes and had a pretty good stringer of walleyes...well as Im sure a few of you have done the stringer was dragging pretty close to the prop and it was cut off. Didn't relize it until we went to put another fish on it. well after trolling the same points for a few more hours I hooked onto something and sure enough, I caught the stringer with all the fish still on it."
546961,ankorklankor,2005-04-11 21:08:00,273,"I caught a umbrella, the large kind that golfers use. Kind of a boring catch, their not big scrappers."
546963,Guest,2005-04-11 21:56:00,0,one morning a day after a tourney I went to a local lake. The first fish I broke off my worm. I hadn't retied. Went home ate lunch and went back. First time I felt a tap i set the hook and came back with the hook i lost earlier.
546965,balsl6,2005-04-11 22:17:00,426,"Was fishing with my two boys 4&8 at the time, the youngest said he lost a fish and his jig. Thought he just got snagged, 10 minutes later I caught a 5lb walleye with my sons jig in his mouth. I did give him the credit of catching it."
546966,Guest,2005-04-11 22:27:00,0,I caught an otter while icefishing.I cut the line at the top of my quick strike rig to release it back into the hole.The hooks were barbless so he probaly worked it out I hope.
