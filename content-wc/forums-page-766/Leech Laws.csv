Ontario had readied legislation to prohibit the importation of leeches (by bait vendors) into Ontario. It has been illegal for recreational fishermen to bring live leeches into Ontario for some time now. It was anticipated that the legislation would have already been passed and the prohibition of importation of leeches into Ontario was scheduled to take effect 1 Jan 2005. However, the passage of the legislation was delayed. Passage is now anticipated for June 05 or even later."

547032,Guest,2005-04-15 07:02:00,0,I'm aware of two sources in Ear Falls: http://www.deminnows.ca/index.htm and Four Seasons Sport Shop. For the past two years Four Seasons (four[email protected])has had leeches for our post Labor Day trip.

I have never heard of salting leeches, but I have of minnows. As a kid, we would torture leeches sometimes by pouring salt on them. They ended up a bloody mess (of course this was a lot of salt!). _ wasn't always a nice kid! I would recommend freezing them if you want to take some dead leeches across, but let me know if you have had success with salted leeches."
