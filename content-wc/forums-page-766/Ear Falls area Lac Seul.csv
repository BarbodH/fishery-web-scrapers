Pick the windy side and work a point. The fish will be there. If you can read a map and feel adventurous, you will find the places that Gary or one of the other guys will mark on your map. You will catch fish."

547015,Guest,2005-04-14 15:34:00,0,"Hey Orange Crush Guy; Are you bringing GPS with you to Gawley's this June. I'll have some coordinates ready for you, if you are bringing the technology with you. You'll have to learn how to put the minnow on your hook by yourself......"
546858,Orange Crush Guy,2005-04-06 21:55:00,13,"I have been fishing Lac Seul for the past 7 years on the end by Vaughn Lake and now we are going to try the Ear Falls end in mid June. It there a big difference in the the way I need to fish up there? We like using crawlers with a harness, and sometimes crank baits on the sand. What should I expect up there in this area..Any help would be great! Thanks"
546864,Guest,2005-04-07 11:05:00,0,"In mid June in the Ear Falls area, I usually use a jig and a minnow. The water is usually pretty cold yet and the fish are close to where they have just been spawning. Some people use a jig and a leech but mid June is a little early for crawlers but you can give them a try. They aren't quite up to chasing spinners or raps yet at that time of year. These are just my experiences and I'm sure there are other people that have different thoughts."
546873,lunker99,2005-04-07 14:50:00,236,"Have done fine with crawlers in early june in the ear falls area so they should be fine when you're up there. We usually either jig or fish slip bobbers, though so I can't tell you much about the other methods that time of year."
546874,Guest,2005-04-07 15:18:00,0,"We fish just north of there the first week in June. assuming a normal spring the fish will have moved out of the spawning areas and started gathering on rocky points, humps etc. and shallow flats not far from where they spawned. Jigs and Minnows or leeches have been better for us than crawlers. Slip bobbers are good and we sometimes troll VERY SLOWLY a plain hook with a minnow on a 3-5' snell (no spinner).A bead above the hook can sometimes help. Spinner rigs don't work as well for us that time of year as it seems to take a very slow presentation. Once the fish are found we often do pretty well dropping the snell I spoke of to the bottom and let it lay...not a lot different than a slip bobber. Excellent fishing that time of year!"
546917,Orange Crush Guy,2005-04-10 10:01:00,13,Thanks for all the replys...I guess I might have to learn to fish a jig and minnow! Thanks once again!!

546940,Guest,2005-04-11 08:16:00,0,We have fished both areas and the Vaughn area has less traffic and I believe the fishing is a little better than at Ear Falls. You will catch plenty of fish in the Ear Falls area but the quality of fish is not as good and the spots are more competitve with other fisherman. I would think that jig/minnow would be your choice the time of year you are going.
546944,Guest,2005-04-11 12:36:00,0,"Orange Crush Guy. Not to worry. The Ear Falls area is awesome for walleye. Try near the railway bridge. We were catching 24-27 inchers there last year. It's about a 3 mile run from your lodge (or about 5 gallons of gas in your Merc) There is a santuary that opens on June 15th at the Wenasaga River that drains into Lac Suel. They will be stacked like cord wood. Lots of fun with catch and release there. Sawmill Bay is a pleasant road trip with some nice scenery, great fishing. Just remember: This is CANADA, not Mille Lacs. Presentation and color are less important. It makes chumps like most of us, feel like a pro.........gotta run my tip up just went down the hole...."
546948,Mike Kansas,2005-04-11 14:36:00,1463,"Orange Crush Guy, We fished out of Ear Falls at Evergreen Lodge last year and caught lots of nice Walleye. In fact my Dear Wife caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye that she has told me about every day since."
546955,Guest,2005-04-11 18:55:00,0,I am going to be staying at Evergreen in August. In the past I have only fished the middle part of the lake. How far do you have to go to find fish? Are the shorelunch spots as nice up by Ear Falls as they are in McKenzie Bay? Got any secret spots you want to share?? I won't tell anyone.
