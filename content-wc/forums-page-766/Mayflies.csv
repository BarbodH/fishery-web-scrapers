546972,Mahumba,2005-04-12 08:07:00,345,Ya know.......Thinking of the name of that float plagued me all freakin' night! Had it on the tip of my tongue a few times only to lose it in the black pit of my mind. From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU!!!! I can rest easy now! Ha Ha! Roger Mayer
546978,Guest,2005-04-12 10:38:00,0,The fly method does sound like fun but not always possible depending on the skill level of the fisherman. The first response to your question is probably the most useable by most people. I've found that a piece of nightcrawler on a jig or a spinner is very effective. If live bait is not an option than by all means us some sort of small plastic presentation. It works. We never give up on eyes.
546984,Guest,2005-04-12 16:02:00,0,"I meant ""A-just A Bubble"", which is made by Rainbow Plastics and I think very similar to a rainbow float except it is assymetric and tips up when you get a hit. Used for small jigs and the like when panfishing. Thanks for the laugh though, made my day. Need to watch my spelling."
546997,Guest,2005-04-13 12:41:00,0,"We had some last year late summer which is an odd time. It was a cool & wet year. Didn't seem to bother too much though. We fished a little deeper, and caught bigger fish! The use of a popper around the docks at night sounds fun. I'll have to keep this in mind."
546906,north_alabama,2005-04-09 11:40:00,172,"What's the conventional wisdom on catching walleyes if the mayflies are hatching? I'll be up on Lac Des Mille Lacs for the first time last of June/beginning of July. From what I'm able to gather, there is a reasonable chance we'll hit a mayfly hatch at that time of year. Anyone know something that might work, or is it best to give up on 'em and chase pike and lake trout?"
546934,jigman 2003,2005-04-11 06:38:00,981,"I ran into a mayfly hatch one late June on a fly-in lake. We caught fish, but fewer than we were used to while using ""traditional"" jig and twister baits. I switched to half of a ""razor worm"" (which is a very thin plastic worm) and a small jig head after two days fishing. The fish were much more cooperative with this bait. I don't take live bait, but I imagine half a crawler would have done the trick too. Don't give up on them until you give it a shot. That same year, I started twitching small rapalas on the surface in late evenings as the walleyes were chasing larva to the surface. Lot of fun to catch 'eyes on a ""topwater"" stick bait. Good luck"
546936,Trailerguy,2005-04-11 07:08:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Mayfly hatchs are a convieniant excuse, used by many folks that give up easily. Mayfly hatchs don't shut walleye fishing down. Move to another spot, away from the hatch, fish rocky points instead of weed beds,fish the windy shore line,ect. If you aren't catching them move again. I've even stood on my dock and caught incoming walleyes with a minnow and bobber, when the mayfies were swarming the trees around me. Mayflys are a food supply, but all the walleyes aren't laying on the bottum with there bellys full. You just have to work harder and not give up."
546937,Mahumba,2005-04-11 07:25:00,345,Float and Fly. Pounded on walleyes near the surface feeding on the emerging may fly nymphs. Real easy technique to use and really works great. Roger Mayer
546938,Guest,2005-04-11 07:30:00,0,Try your Fly Rod in the evening when the surface activity is good. I have caught many Walleyes doing this and it is a blast.
546943,Guest,2005-04-11 10:46:00,0,Now I'll need to find a myfly nymph fly. I presume they're fairly easy to get? (I'm not a fly fisherman--yet). What type of float do you use?
546945,Mahumba,2005-04-11 14:09:00,345,The float shoud be fixed. The float is just used as weight so you can cast out the light fly. There's a water float that is made for this but the name escapes me..... Leave about 5-6 feeet from the fly to the float. Roger Mayer
546946,Guest,2005-04-11 14:23:00,0,Just a fly rod with a bluegill popper on it.....surface action on Walleye....better than cold beer and hot women.
546949,Guest,2005-04-11 14:59:00,0,"""Just a Bubble""?"
546956,manitobawalleye,2005-04-11 20:17:00,885,beleive the float is called rainbow casting floats
