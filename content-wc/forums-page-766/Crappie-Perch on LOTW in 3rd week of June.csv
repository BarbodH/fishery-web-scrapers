546708,Guest,2005-03-31 09:28:00,0,All: We are making our 2nd trip this year in the Sabaskong Bay part of LOTW and would like some general info on how/where(deep) to catch some panfish to bring home to eat. Thanks in advance.
546711,Guest,2005-03-31 10:55:00,0,Forget it - Go fish walleyes. They start on the reefs around the 3rd week of June and bite hard. If you want crappies come in September or October. You can fish perch with the kids off our dock and catch all you want.

What resort are you heading out from???"

Use your electronics, if they are there, you'll see them. We make a fall trip mostly just for crappies and always have a ball."
