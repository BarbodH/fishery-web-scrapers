I am so glad the Canadian >Immigration Minister has announced that if Canadians need >passports to the US YOU WILL NEED PASSPORTS TO CANADA.get used >to it. Just a suggestion/theory to my American friends who frequent this Board - most of the Anti-American comments like those from ""Moosehead"" you see here are written by Americans - probably Minnesota resort owners in who's interest it is for you to think Canadians don't like U.S. Fisherman in Canada. Since all most of these resort owners have to offer you is an expensive boat ride, if you want to catch fish then I suggest you visit Canada or at least consider it - the fishing is simply way better. While Canada and Canadians may disagree on occassion with some decisions of your Government, why should this also mean we don't like ""average"" Americans. Besides, politics and fishing don't mix! For those Americans who come up to Canada regularly, tell me, do you really feel that you are treated badly or not liked just because your American when you're up here? I would say the majority of you would tell me you are treated the way you should be treated - as friends and neighbours. Think about this the next time you see one of these posts calling you names - the truth is the vast majority of us like you up here eh!"
547090,Guest,2005-04-18 08:49:00,0,I live in Michigan and travel to Ontario 4-7 times per year for fishing. Have made many friends from up there. I count it a great blessing to fish those remote waters. When some of those new friends travel south and go thru Mich. they can stay at my home overnight and if we are not home we put the key under the mat and they can make themselves at home. Our friiends to the north are truly that. Great friends to me and my wife and friends to OUR COUNTRY. lenray
547097,Frankm,2005-04-18 11:26:00,154,I have been going to Canada for 10 years straight. We have always been treated nice at all the places we stop. Even the Police are friendly. We pulled into a gas station at 2:00 a.m. to switch drivers and fill our coffee. The gas station was closed. The police officer pulled in asked us what we were doing and then talked fishing with us for 15-20 minutes. We also have been going to the same place and the owner is like family. He makes a point of coming over one night during the week and having a few blues and talking fishing and hunting with us. It would take alot more than having to spend a few bucks on a passport or a delay at the border to keep me in the states.
546866,bigfish1965,2005-04-07 12:35:00,3210,Jake is quite right. There are several places in the prairies where you can just walk across without any check at all. There is just too much land to watch. You guys pay way too much for Passports. Mine was 50 bucks or so.
546880,Guest,2005-04-08 06:10:00,0,"Well, there is a model out there for securing large borders effectively, the Soviet Union. Somebody joked about carrying papers state-to-state. We might be joking about the way our grandchildren live. Totalitarian governments always use ""security"" as their excuse. I hope our system of checks-and-balances wins out over the security fanaticism. It's one thing to steal a bunch of money out of my paycheck. Messing with my fishing is an entirely different matter!"
546886,Guest,2005-04-08 09:05:00,0,"Bigfish, where did you get your passport for 50$. I'd like to go ahead and purchase one now. We are heading up in Sept."

546894,Guest,2005-04-08 15:48:00,0,We have as outfitters been informed that only Canadians will need passport to enter the US. Let's not overreact at this point. It's always good to have a passport but not necessay for US citizens.
546897,rebelrn2001,2005-04-08 19:58:00,1563,"I would think with 64 meg, they'd be able to get more than 'basic' information about me on the chip."

546900,JimH,2005-04-08 20:48:00,320,I think it's an outrage. Everyone should boycott traveling to Canada and stay here in the States.................. as I gladly hand customs my passport and enter Canada as the lone fisherman from the States;-)
546928,Guest,2005-04-10 22:05:00,0,you americans are so arrogant. I am so glad the Canadian Immigration Minister has announced that if Canadians need passports to the US YOU WILL NEED PASSPORTS TO CANADA.get used to it.

546835,Guest,2005-04-06 12:56:00,0,You can get passports online now to....I just renewed mine. Simple process...and the $50 won't keep me from going to Canada any time soon.

546845,Gary_IA,2005-04-06 14:51:00,144,I heard a report on public radio that it won't be too long before passports will be issued with RFID Radio Frequency Identification. Apparently it will contain a 64 meg chip that will store your basic information. There is some concern that your information can be scanned by people other than the approriate authority if that person(s)had a scanner of their own and was within 4 inches of the passport. Should we be concerned about this and get our passport before the Rfid becomes a part of the passport?
546846,Larry S,2005-04-06 14:54:00,666,"USA TODAY had a story about passports U.S. citizens will be required to show a passport to re-enter the USA from Canada,Mexico,Panama, Bermuda,and the Carribean by 2008.The change will be phased in over the next 3 years.Canadians will also need passports to enter the US You can get your passport at your local post office,check each station to find out if they have the passport service,many post offices also will take pictures needed for the passport Larry S"
546847,Guest,2005-04-06 14:58:00,0,"Thanks for the reply, if a passport lasts for ten years i guess thats not to bad of a price. But with a wife and four kids it does add up. Will it stop me from going to canada? don't know yet. Will have to see what else might change at the border. If this is to secure the borders from the bad guys, why wait 2 years to start this? Sure hope we don't one day have to have PAPERS to travel from state to state. (Joke) Thanks Larry"
546848,Guest,2005-04-06 15:02:00,0,"I recently got a passport with recent rumors of ""Homeland Security.The fee has gone up to $95 from $65 March7 . This does not include the $18 to get a ""certified birth certificate""Nice Huh!"
546849,Guest,2005-04-06 15:54:00,0,"Just got done applying for my passport. Paid $67 to U.S. Department of State and $45 to Postmaster. Applied for mine at Ft Dodge, Iowa postoffice. Filled out a form, had to have a certified birth and my driver's license. Total time took about 20 minutes including getting my mug shot. Lady was very nice."
546850,Guest,2005-04-06 16:38:00,0,Larry I tryed the places (states) you mentioned. Cause I thought it was too expensive to go to Canada. Well a buddy took me to Canada thats when I found out spending a little more to actually catch fish is alot better then spending money to take a boat ride. Put me down for going back to Canada.
546862,Guest,2005-04-07 08:35:00,0,"It makes for good optics to placate the US public however it totally ignores the fact that Canada and the USA has roughly 1500 miles of unfenced undefended borders. Any terrorist or criminal only needs to pick a spot in the miles an miles of forest in Ontario or Manitoba or Saskatchewan or in the mountains of Alberta and British Columbia and walk across. Even I living on the border here need only drive down the road at night with my canoe 3 miles and then cross the St Mary's river where it is only 30 yards wide and I would be in the USA . So unless the USA is going to build a wall, like the Israelis have had to, and the wall be 1500 miles long , the passport paranoia is just good optics. I guess its similar to the Canadian paranoia we had to register all guns, when lets be real criminals will work around that problem very easy. jake"
546791,Guest,2005-04-05 14:37:00,0,"I seen on the news, that you will need a passport to cross from canada to the U.S. Not sure when this will take effect. This will apply to both canada and americans. How long is a passport good for? Thanks Larry"
546792,Greg @ ABL,2005-04-05 15:15:00,23,"I checked the web site for US Customs, and there is nothing that mentions US Citizens need a passport. The official information: Documentary Requirements for Entry To The United States Travel from within the Western Hemisphere (North, Central or South America) U.S. citizens: Are exempt from passport requirements. However, it is highly recommended that a U.S. Citizen be prepared to present documentation such as valid or expired U.S. passport, U.S. birth certificate, or Naturalization certificate to avoid delays. ExceptionÂ—travel from Cuba, valid U.S. passport is required Basically, passports are suggested but not required. Agate"

Although no date has been set, it is likely that US citizens will soon require a passport to enter Canada.

546829,Guest,2005-04-06 10:31:00,0,"I certainly understand why both Canada and U.S. would do this....probably a smart decision. That said, it creates another hassel/hurdle and that, along with rising gas prices, will affect my decision to go. It makes South Dakota, Minnesota and southern lakes look more inviting. Will likely explore more waters in my home state as well."
546831,Guest,2005-04-06 11:42:00,0,I will be less likely to take my sons to Ontario if a passport is required. We love fishing in Ontario but the added expense and hassle of getting passports for young boys means we will probably go elsewhere. Just my opinion.
546832,Guest,2005-04-06 11:52:00,0,"Git-er-done! Passports are going to be part of you and your kids future. They are reduced price for children and its not that hard to get done. You should just get your birth certificates together for your whole family, get the application from your county office, get your passsport pictures and git-er-done. In a couple years you won't be able to re-enter the US from anywhere w/out one. Beat the rush."
