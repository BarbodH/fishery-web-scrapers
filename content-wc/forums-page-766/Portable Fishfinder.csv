547036,Greg Walters,2005-04-15 12:27:00,176,"Pikefisherman, I can't help you with the Garmin Â– it's not my brand. The PiranhaMax 20 is very compact for a portable and runs off AA sized batteries which are available just about everywhere. With a 240 vertical by 160 horizontal pixel count; the display is pretty good for so small a unit. The dual beam sonar is nice for covering more area in deeper water too. The Matrix 20 has a larger display (240 x 240 LCD) and the portable case is larger too. It's designed to work with two 6-volt lantern type batteries. It's only a single beam sonar unit. You may also want to look at the FishFinder units as these are single beam versions of the Matrix units but generally don't use all the accessories that the Matrix units do. Let me know if you have any questions. Greg Walters at Humminbird [email protected]"
547040,Guest,2005-04-15 17:16:00,0,you didn't mention it but you can't beat the fishmark 480 for the money.
547045,Guest,2005-04-16 06:12:00,0,Thanks for the reply. The matrix is particularly interesting because of the GPS capabilities. I have a Garmin VistaC. Can you explain how the GPS feature works with the matrix? Thanks
547132,Greg Walters,2005-04-19 09:54:00,176,"Pikefisherman, Sure, the Matrix will use your Garmin VistaC as a GPS antenna. All it gets from the Garmin is the GPS positioning data (no maps, tracks, waypoints or routes) and will show a trackplot and waypoints that are saved in the Matrix unit on a background grid. E-mail me and I can send you back a pdf file that explains how to connect it up and what settings you will need for it to work. Greg Walters at Humminbird [email protected]"
547146,Guest,2005-04-19 22:59:00,0,480 is great! here's the 320 in action. http://www.fishingthunderbay.com/laketrout2005.htm Does it look correct on how the fish is going down? Should'nt the line be the other way? Doesn't make sense to me.
