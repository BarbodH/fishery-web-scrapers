528743,Guest,2003-03-19 07:17:00,0,"This board is getting to be to much. The postings have less to do with fishing then usual, nothing much constructive said, and the bashing is unreal. What used to be a highend forum is now a trash bin.It's amazing to me. But that is obvious that many sensible people have gone elsewhere. That is where I am going as well."
528737,Thumper,2003-03-19 08:22:00,133,"Yup, Dick. They took it Hook, Line and Sinker! :DPersonally, being such a man's man, when I finish my beer, I eat the bottle. It gives me the mineral most diets ignore - silicon. And helps keep me regular! ;)"

528745,Guest,2003-03-24 17:40:00,0,Hey Dick!Ha..Ha. Another funny post by a joker. The reason people tore you apart is because some people actually do what you suggested. I see bottles washed up on shore and garbage covering the rock shoals that I fish. A message to the people who dispose of their garbage in my lakes: Don't let me catch you or I'll kick your *#$!!@#$#@* and sink YOU to the bottom.

It's obvious that we all have cabin fever, but having so many lured into this guys sense of humor is unbelievable. He must be a fantastic angler; look at all the fish he has hooked."
528738,Guest,2003-03-25 14:13:00,0,"Very excellent trolling presentation going on, here, Dick. Excellent bait and many biters.:)"
528747,Guest,2003-03-25 21:53:00,0,Better be carefull or i will have Sharron Jean come down and open up a can of whoop ### on you.
528730,Guest,2003-03-17 13:45:00,0,"Very good Zinger_79. I was just having a little cabin fever and decided to mess with some of you guys. Of course I don't sink the bottles in the lake . Nor, do I throw them up on the shore. Usually I save them all up and throw them at road signs all the way from Kenora to the border!"
528731,fishmaster,2003-03-17 14:56:00,209,"Boy this Dick guy must be a #####, Why the ##### would you want to do something so STUPID?????Besides I thought it was against the law to drink in a boat in Canada.Maybe someone can give this CLOWN some insight.I think it was said well by some of the above!!!enough said"
528732,Vitreum,2003-03-17 15:09:00,221,"hey dick with them, i read somewhere that we have 25 or 30 feet of intestines. take a jar of vaseline along and shove them where the sun don't shine. that way, when you get back to shore you can get your deposit back."
528733,Alan D,2003-03-17 19:45:00,36,Why don't the MODS just lock this idiot out.Alan D
528735,Guest,2003-03-17 23:05:00,0,Dick is a jerk but the people that think he is actually serious are even more messed up. Can't you figure it out that Dik inhim is bored and looking for some controversy to get you guys off?I actually think Dik Inhim is funny cause I know he's not real!!!!
528736,Guest,2003-03-18 06:18:00,0,"Eye' Eye' Captain! I thought this site was about fishing and having fun. Many of you come here come to gain valuable information on the sport you love, fishing, which I respect. I just posted to add a little humor to the board. The question, How to dispose of your empty bottles, and if is it is better to sink them or throw them up on the shore is absurd. I am amazed that many of you took it so seriously that you viciously attacked the poster. Some of you guys took it in the context it was written and had fun with it, others need to lighten up a bit. If you don't like the question or the humor don't post a message, just go on to the postings that interest you."
528739,Guest,2003-03-18 06:55:00,0,"A few days ago someone make a joke post about eating a 12 lb. walleye and everybody had fun and suggested receipes for bald eagle, sturgeon, etc. You make a joke about littering and some people want you skinned alive. It seems that its ok to eat endangered wildlife so long as you don't leave your paper plates laying around afterward. I laughed so hard at some of the replies I nearly peed my pants. Good one!"
528740,Reels,2003-03-18 17:26:00,2876,Float them as jet ski bouys.<{{}}><

528719,Guest,2003-03-17 09:14:00,0,"What is the best way to dispose of your empty beer bottles out in the boat? Is it better to fill them with water and sink the them? Or, throw them up in the weeds on the shore?"
528720,Guest,2003-03-17 09:28:00,0,MORON
528721,Guest,2003-03-17 09:32:00,0,Never throw them anywhere near shore! Always sink'em because ya never know when the fish cops are watching! Also by sinking them you are adding possible structure to fish next time.
528722,Guest,2003-03-17 10:01:00,0,SMASH THEM AGAINST YOUR BRAINLESS SKULL THEN EAT THE GLASS........YOU COME BY YOUR NAME WELL DICK !!!! i know your just joking cause nobody can be this dumb right ?

528723,Guest,2003-03-17 11:07:00,0,"Joking about what? You just can't leave those bottles rolling around on the floor of the boat, thats dangerous. Also, I don't want to get a ticket for drinking on the water."
528724,River_eye,2003-03-17 11:20:00,1486,Your fishing boat belongs on the bottom of the lake with you in it.
528727,zinger_79,2003-03-17 12:51:00,76,"Read the guy's name folks. A couple of times if necessary. It is too bad though, that he has to use this forum for his own ""entertainment"". Sick pup."
