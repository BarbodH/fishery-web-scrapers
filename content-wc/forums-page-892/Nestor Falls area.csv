528600,Guest,2003-03-13 12:35:00,0,"The area around Hay Island is generally pretty good, and there are other areas in Sabaskong Bay. When are you going?"
528601,Guest,2003-03-14 18:05:00,0,"I would stay around Hay also, you are 12 miles out already and nestor is really in a long big bay and most people run at least 12 miles out a day to get away from the fishing presure. The places you can stay are Split Rock Lodge, Hanson's King Island Lodge and Duck Bay, the nicest out of them is Hanson's hands down but the other are OK."

Troll over it with original Rapalas or smaller shad raps. It used to be a great place to catch walleye and northern. Never caught anything real big, but always caught plenty to eat. Try towards evening, that always seemed best."

528604,bubbalou,2003-03-24 12:00:00,29,I fish Nestor Falls area every fall for Crappies and can't believe how good it can be. Last year was off but still got enough to eat and a pair of 1lb 10oz for the wall. Took my dad and a couple of friends up last fall and they couldn't believe how fat the crappies were. I don't seem to get the 16-17 inch fish but man we seldom boat anything less then a 1 pound fish. Every year except for last year we are doing catch and relase by the third day. We fish them when we go up in late summer but it's a lot more work then.
