528563,Ivy,2003-03-14 07:39:00,556,"Pooch,Get this for bad logic. Every year around Christmas I get all out of sorts cause we spend to much darn money. So I told the Mrs. that I think we need to enjoy Christmas in a small town in Mexico so the kids can see what other children of the world have and DON'T have at Christmas time.Ivy"
528564,Pooch,2003-03-14 17:01:00,4619,"Hey Ivy,I like your thinking. Years ago I decided that if I were king I'd limit the commercial side of Christmas to once every five years. My wife disagrees but that isn't unusual!Several years ago we spent Christmas in ""Zia"" Mexico. Very quaint and simple. Did you know that they don't have walleye down there either....Pooch"
528565,Guest,2003-03-22 06:03:00,0,Pooch Will I see you in Red Lake this year? Going up on June 20 to Chimo to the same lake. wish I was going today.
528566,Pooch,2003-03-22 07:55:00,4619,Shoot me your email. My old confuser died and I lost all addresses.Peg and I will be in Washington DC instead of Red Lake this summer when your fishing. I'll be back to Red Lake and the Savant area end of July first of August for a couple of back to back trips with my regular buddies.Maybe we need to connect on a trip sometime.Pooch
528553,2 DOGS,2003-03-12 08:06:00,361,"Was wondering what the effects of the increased fuel costs will have on resort owners and especially fly-in operations where fuel is such a huge part of their business? Will this drive some out of business? Will they be able to honor their commitment to anglers? Will they have to charge more? Many of these operators were charging in U.S. $ planning on the favorable exchange rate, now that is going down, will they be able to provide the same services? Food for thought."
528554,Vitreum,2003-03-12 11:00:00,221,"actually 2 dogs, our gas here in maryland has started to drop a little. it's running around $1.65 for regular unleaded. last year when i drove out to northwest ontario, i never paid less than $1.50 per gallon. what's the price doing in canada? you guys are loaded with oil and gas and are our biggest supplier. i know it's highly taxed, but it shouldn't be going up that much. my son and i used about 5 gallons of gas per day in our lodge boat. 30 gallons per week at $.15 is about $4.50 for the week. i hardly think that will break the lodge owners."
528555,Pooch,2003-03-12 14:41:00,4619,"Two or three years ago many Fly In camps raised thier prices due to increased fuel costs. That same summer fuel prices dropped but the price of the trip stayed the same. Not sure if I liked that, but these folks may have had the price locked in and had to live with it.Everyone needs to make a profit to stay in business. If margins are slim then I would think that a bump may have to happen. Whether we like it or not. No one likes to tell thier customers that a price increase is neccesary.Pooch"
528557,fishinguy74,2003-03-12 16:03:00,1,"Hello,I own and operate a fly-in lodge in Manitoba. We were very lucky this year to contract with the bank to sell them our U.S. dollars at a very good rate. Lodge owners need to plan ahead this way, and expect gas prices to change every year. These small changes can add up when you're not prepared. If anyone tries to up your price, then I'd be very worried about their financial position.We're a bit more concerned about the slow bookings that our competitors and ourselves are noticing this year. We're hoping it's war and economy related and that things will rebound before the start of our season. Oh well, we'll just spend more on advertising."
528556,2 DOGS,2003-03-12 16:23:00,361,"I guess I should clarify that I am not a citizen of Canada. I spend 3 months of the summer there and was just wondering what the effects would be on some of the people I know up there. I had heard gas had gone up about 10 cents a liter. That comes out to $.37 a gallon increase. Maybe someone from up north could clue us in. I know here in Colorado we have seen some real good price hikes, especially for diesel."
528558,Vitreum,2003-03-12 16:40:00,221,"bookings, now that is what i would think is the real threat to the average camp's bottom line. we are well into our 3rd year of slowdown in the economy down here in the states. the market is a mess, things are slow and the average family had to pay enough extra this winter for heat to pay for their canada trip."
528559,jale6666,2003-03-12 17:50:00,14,"i live in ottawa, ontario and gas is 84.9 cents per litre this morning"
528560,Pooch,2003-03-13 08:12:00,4619,$1.80 to $1.99 a gallon in central Illinois.Over Christmas it was $3.80 a gallon in Eluthera (outer island of the Bahamas). Makes our's look like a bargan.Pooch
528561,Ivy,2003-03-13 15:03:00,556,"Pooch,Bahamas over Christmas? How did Santa find you?Ivy"
528562,Pooch,2003-03-13 21:14:00,4619,He gave up on me a long time ago....Did you know that there are no Walleye in the Bahamas.......
