Have two trips planned in May, but with all that is happening, non US support, high fuel prices, terrorist alert,etc., thinking if I should cancel. Does anyone know what level Orange means at the border? Should we bring additional info, etc?Thanks for the help."

Residency can be shown by a drivers license but that does not show your citizenship. There have been lots of posts on WC about crossing the boarder. Answer the questions, be polite, and be patient. This applies going both ways.Bob"

The wait time was not significant (5-10 minutes) and the border guards asked the same questions they always ask. I breezed in, picked up several cases of true Blue, and was back on U.S. soil within a half-hour.A political disagreement between our countries will not affect the day-to-day operations of crossing the border....as it shouldn't."

That means passenger cars will be low priority and could mean huge lineups for both cars and trucks but cars even more so . So watch for code alert and consider your border location options. Fort Erie and Detroit will be ridiculous trying to get back into USA . The Sault may not be as bad but USA side is building new customs building and so one less lane at all times for customs as of last week. Not too bad now with half hour waits but who knows if red alert then all bets off. lets hope your boys finish this war quick, but even then terrorists already in may strike retalitory for months or years after.jake"
