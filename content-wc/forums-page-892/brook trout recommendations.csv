Any lakes rivers or streams would be considered. Love fishing trout in streams! thanks."

You have to fish catch and release, but a lot of 2-5 pound fish. Also, other rivers and lakes around Nipigon are famous for their brookies."

Is fishing good in its tributaries?Also, what times of the year are good? I am avaible to fish in august, but in the future, I would plan a trip for the peak fishing seasons."
