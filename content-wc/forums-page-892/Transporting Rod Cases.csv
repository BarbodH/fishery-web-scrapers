528859,Guest,2003-03-21 12:01:00,0,Anyone have suggestions on how to quickly and easily secure a rod case to a luggage rack on top of an SUV? I usually tie mine down with twine but it is cumbersome and takes time. It's too long to fit inside.

528861,Guest,2003-03-21 13:48:00,0,I've tried bungees but the rod case wants to roll around. I was thinking more in terms of clamps. I've seen plumber trucks with PVU tubes clamped on the top of the truck but I don't know where to get them or how to make it and attach it to the luggage rack.
528862,Guest,2003-03-24 02:07:00,0,"We found a good way to do it with screw type hose clamps and a broom stick or hoe handle. Get hose clamps large enough to fit around the rod case and stick the broom stick under the luggage rack cross member, the clamp has to be large enough to also fit around the stick so that when you tighten it, it pulls up on the broomstick and pulls down on the rod case with the crossmember sandwiched between them. When you want to remove the casses you only have to loosen the clamps enough to slide out the broomstick and then the cases lift off the rack and the clamps slide off the cases and go into the vehicle with the broomsticks. We use two clamps and one broomstick for each case, have never had them come loose or even move."
528863,Guest,2003-03-24 05:51:00,0,Nice idea! Not too hard to take off if you have a screwdriver or nut driver when you stop for the night or at your destination. It should also prevent spur of the moment temptation to dishonest people-who don't have the tools-when you stop for a coffee break.
528864,Guest,2003-03-24 11:19:00,0,Great idea. Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks
