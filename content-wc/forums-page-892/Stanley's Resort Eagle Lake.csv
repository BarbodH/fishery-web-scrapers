528825,Guest,2003-03-19 06:56:00,0,I think it is a nice place and the owners certainly are fine people.I used to see that at sport shows and their display materials indicated the place was nice and kept up. I went by the place while fishing Eagle and it lays in the West Arm and it is in good lake trout water. Certainly worth consideration.

It is absolutely first class from my view: clean, well maintained and very nice and modern facilities. Most of my fishing on Eagle is for Muskie and that end of the lake is noted for big fish. There are also a couple laker holes on that end of the lake and the water tends to be clearer than much of the rest of the lake. We often find ourselves running up that way to fish and there is lots of good walleye structure that way but we spend little time fishing them so that information is best coming from someone else.Paul"

You can get the same quality of fishing on the West arm of Eagle for less if you are willing to fix your own meals and take care of yourselves a bit. Check out Kimberley's Eagle West Resort before you make your decision. He's in the process of updating cabins, docks etc. and pretty much leaves you alone to enjoy your week. I've been going there for 10 years. Just depends on the level of creature comfort you are looking for. I like to be left alone to fish and don't like 10 boats from the same camp coming in on me. Stanley folks tend to do that sometimes. So I take my own boat and stay out of the crowds. There is also another lodge located at the entrance of the West Arm, Sportsman's?? Cannot remember for sure. Always enough fish action on the Arm and I don't go out there much. Check 'em all out...it is a great fishery. Clear water...sometimes a unique approach is required.Good luck and maybe I'll catch you on the water..."
