528866,Hammerhead Herb,2003-03-22 13:21:00,259,"Couple of Questions:1. I assume that Canada has veterans organizations similar to the American Legion or the VFW; is that correct?2. Do they have local posts that sell adult beverages?3. Are US American Legion members welcome at these posts?4. Does Dryden, Ear Falls or Red Lake have such posts?Thanx for the info"
