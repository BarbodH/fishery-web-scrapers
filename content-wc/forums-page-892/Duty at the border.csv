My question is, how much duty do you pay on the excess? I would like to bring a couple of cases of the cheap stuff in before I get my premium stock. Any info?"

There were 4 of us in 2 cars and I forgot to transfer 2 cases to the other guys car so I had to declare 2 cases extra. The duty was 14.05 canadian for 2 cases extra. The exchange rate was $1.25 CAN = $1.00 US. I gave them $12 US ($15 CAN) and got 95 Cents CAN change. So it was a little less than $6 per case.I just checked the exchange rate and it is $1.49 CAN = $1.00 US so my calculator says that would be $4.69 US per case.Scott"

The more expensive the beer in the US, the lower the duty. Last trip north our group paid about $9.00/case CDN for each extra case of Bud. We paid about $15/case US for the beer.If you take extra cases, just declare them and take your receipt in to the customs office and they'll calculate the duty.Personally I wouldn't mess with it for the difference in price except that the Canadian Beer Stores are usually closed when we get there."
528878,Boots,2003-03-23 20:08:00,19,A few years ago we took in extra beer and thought we would come ahead by paying the duty but it upset the young female border inspectors and they searched us and said we sell beer in Canada. We will not take in extra beer anymore. Just buy a couple cases in Canada and dont go through the trouble.
