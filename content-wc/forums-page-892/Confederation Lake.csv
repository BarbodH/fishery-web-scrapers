528619,Guest,2003-03-15 10:00:00,0,"I think the owner really knows his fishery which I think is mostly lakers. I would think it would be pretty good from my conversations with him, but I have never been there. In a remote location. Sorry don't have more information."
528620,Guest,2003-03-17 19:01:00,0,"I know you want an unbiased opinion of my lake so won't blow my own horn here just to set straight prior post....we are know for big pike, and lake trout fishing. We have walleye in our portage lakes that I am very protective of....i.e. conservation fishing only on the portage lakes = eat a few for shorelunch. All trophy fish are released (27.5"" Pike, 22"" Lake Trout, and 18"" Walleye). My web site has info from last season fishing, available dates for 2003, and the photo gallery has cabins, and fish photos from last season. If you would like referrences email me and I will send back few guest names and numbers/emails. www.southbaylodge.com [email protected] Roger Osborne - owner."
528621,Guest,2003-03-18 06:45:00,0,Roger....is the the Conferderation Lake that's up by Ouchi Lake? I remember a very long portage between the two that went through an old mining town (Little long Lac Gold Mine).
528622,Guest,2003-03-18 19:39:00,0,"Aaron, we are close to Uchi lake. There is a trail 6 miles long between us. The Uchi Gold Mine site is about half way on the trail. The Uchi Mine was one of the richest gold mines in all of Canada. It shut down during WWII. There are several abandoned gold mines in the area surrounding our lake and lots old stuff/buildings/etc. The trails up there are endless for exploring the old mine sites. The South Bay Mine shut down in late 70's (copper mine) the whole area has alot of history. Fishing started on Confederation in 1949, Parson's Airways flew guests into the location of our lodge and remained a fly in until the 70's when the mine started and closed all within a 6 yr period. We still have geologist digging around the rocks during the summer looking for gold! According to the old timers the fishing today is better than it was 40 years ago! Alot to be said for catch and release. Roger"
528623,Guest,2003-03-19 07:19:00,0,Nice commercial Roger. Give it a break.
528624,Guest,2003-03-20 13:04:00,0,"Roger, thanks for the reply. I made that hike between those two lakes about 18 years ago with my father. I even snatched a sign that reads ""Little Long Lac Gold Mine""...Oops....probably shouldn't admit that :)Never fished Confederation Lake but the walleye and Pike fishing in Uchi was awesome."
