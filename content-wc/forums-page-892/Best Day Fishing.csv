It's not the day we caught the most fish together, it's just the simple things like that that are the most memorable."
528779,Guest,2003-03-18 12:34:00,0,"I had two days last year that tied for first place. One was taking my 8 year old grandson out to a local lake where he caught sunfish, perch, bass, and bullheads all day. He told me it was the best day of his life.Second was up in Canada last year. Caught and released my first 10 lb. walleye that day, along with a bunch of others, won the group fishing contest for the week, and boat with most fish caught and released. Was celebrating the day, when the resort owner came in and said my wife wanted me to call her. Her reason for calling was to let me know that I was going to receive a 45 weeks salary payment when I retired the next month!"
528780,Ivy,2003-03-18 12:37:00,556,"My Dad and I took a Fly-Out in late September a few years ago. We were the only people in a brand new 8 person cabin in Northern Onterio. We had the lake to ourselves.The day that I remember started off chilly but warmed right up. We hit the Eyes and caught a nice limit that day. Later that night I cooked up a couple steaks. I had also brought up a bottle of 1994 Dominus. When I first opened the Wine I hid a small glass in the cupboard. As the night went on, we ate a great meal and we drank the wine, splitting the bottle drop for drop. The combination of the food, wine and the cool air were unforgetable. When we emptied the bottle there was the expected feeling that we wanted more wine and the disappointement that there wasn't any left. After we did the dishes, I walked over to the cupboard and retrieved the small glass I had set aside. My Dad couldn't believe it. We negotiated for hours on every last sip. A day I will never forget.Ivy"
528781,Mike KS,2003-03-18 14:27:00,18,My best day in Canada is going to happen the first day Im there this year. My son lost a leg this winter in a construction accident and Im looking forward to him joining me and catching a few eyes and having time with him that for a brief moment I thought might never happen again.
528782,Guest,2003-03-18 22:15:00,0,"IvyI remember a day maybe 10 years ago when the 2 of us waided a small stream in Northeast Iowa and caght many Smallmouth, Largemouth, Crappie and trout. We each had a pole, minnow bucket and a few extra hooks. Thankfully you brought some left over pizza and chocalate bars to help us make it thru the long walk. That was quite the stringer of fish - and made for a greatfish fry that night at the campsite.Life is goodBigfish"

528785,Guest,2003-03-20 16:57:00,0,"I went to Canada for the first time last year and I don't get out to fish as much as I would like, but I had a blast. The first day I was fishing with my best friend and his dad, who have been going to Canada on a regular basis for the last twenty years, they started catching a few walleyes and I was still fishless. The next thing I know they is that they both had a bait and they told me to reel in. As I started to reel in, I felt a little snag and then great deal of pressure on my pole. I thought it was a snag at first and after while of fighting I realized it was fish. I was shocked to see my first fish I caught in Canada was an 8.5 pound walleye. I caught many more fish that week and I am glad to say I let to big one go back, so I can catch him this year."
528786,gofish,2003-03-22 07:01:00,24,"The ""Best"" day lasts for 2 weeks every September, when my Dad and I go up to Lost Lake Lodge. But the day I will always remember the most was 6 years ago when my Dad reeled in a 42 inch northern. The biggest fish he has ever caught - and released. I'll never forget that HUGE smile on his face when he brought that fish into the boat. Priceless!Only 6 more months!"
