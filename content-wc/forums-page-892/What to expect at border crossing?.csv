528848,Guest,2003-03-19 18:41:00,0,I'll be crossing the border on the 26th of March to do a little ice fishing trip for a few days. What can I expect with the hightened security going on? Are they searching every vehicle? How much time may be involved? Just wondering what to be prepared for. Thanks in advance!
528849,Guest,2003-03-19 20:41:00,0,It will be business as usual coming into Canada but going back to the states may be a little longer. Visas are required now for a lot of people and there is increased security at US borders. Good fishing

Like a prior post said, it is no problem getting into Canada but coming back you should be prepared. They are searching many more outfits and you should bring your passport and/or birth certificate and picture ID. Be patient with the guys at the border as they are just following orders from above. I don't mind spending a little more time at customs if it keeps some of the bad guys out.NorthmanMontana"
