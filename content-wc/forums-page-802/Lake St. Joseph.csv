I would have to say that without question it was the finest fishing I have experienced over a week. We averaged 50 Walleyes per man per day and did not really target Walleye. We caught 15 Northern Pike over 36"" and one solid 42"". You can catch Walleye right on the beach using just a plane jig. From the other guests there, they said that unless you are targeting musky or smallmouth, Lac Seul simply doesn't compare. Give it a try!"
541406,Guest,2004-07-05 15:42:00,0,"I have been to that very same resort twice in the last five years and each time we had similar luck to yours. We absolutely creamed the walleyes. I loved the lake and the people at the resort are spectacular. The only reason we have not gone back every year is that you cannot catch anything over 26"" on that lake (walleye). Also our boats got the #### beat of them on the beach pallets. Everyone had sand in their livewell pumps, etc. I mean I would go back again I just want to catch a trophy and that has been what has kept us away. It is pretty pricey too. I am going to Lac Suel in two weeks for a week. I will tell you how they compare. I am sure that you can't complain on either trip. I had a great time and Phil is a riot. We would run over 40 miles one some days to some really breath taking spots. I was just looking at our pictures from there last night. I still remember coming in on Sunday morning to watch the Vikings on Satellite TV in September of 2001. The only people at the resort were all from MN and we all motored in to watch the game, what a treat. We happened to be up there 9/1/01-9/8/01 coindently. We were fortunate not to be there on the 11th and possible stuck for quite awhile. I suppose being stuck there is about as good a place as any. Anyways I will let you know which I think is better. Keep in mind I have been up to St. Joe twice so it may have the advantage. WMT"
541421,Guest,2004-07-05 19:10:00,0,"Been to lake St. joe last several yrs, headed back in 3 weeks. In those yrs the water has fluctuated greatly, last yr 5ft low and the yr before 8ft high. I have been told water is high again this yr. almost as high as 2 yrs ago. With such fluctuation in water levels the hot spots change from yr to yr. Would be very interested in knowing the locations you were having the best bite. Last yr with the water level change about 10 ft difference from previous yr all the old spots were no good and had to find others. We were also there the yr a biologist was there and gave a presention regarding the lake and also showed charts comparing Lac Suel and St.joe. Intresting presentation. Though you can catch 30 inch walleye in St. Joe , there are more of them in Lac suel. but St. Joe has lac suel beat in population density. Again would appreciate any info on locations you were having good luck will surely save us a grat deal of time. Thanks!"
541428,Guest,2004-07-05 21:50:00,0,Are you staying at the Old Post? If so I can tell you that no matter what the water levels the fish are hitting in front of Dome Island and Fisherman's Point has a breakline that consistently holds fish. I have been told by others who never leave the are around Old Post that they caught as many fish as we did and we ran 100+ miles a day round trip. If Phil ever stopped throwing in the gas for free I imagine we would have never left that part either. Drop me an email and I will try to tell you were we pounded them. In 2000 we had a group of six boats and sixteen anglers and there were times when everyone had a fish on at the same time. I concur that the population density must be higher in St. Joe just from the lack of fishing pressure when compared to Lac Seul.[email protected] Do you use their boats or bring your own? If you bring your own how big is it? The reason I ask is I won't bother wasting your time telling you about some really prestine spots due to the distance from the lodge. WMT
541478,Guest,2004-07-06 16:42:00,0,I've heard good things about the pike fishing on Lake St. Jospeh. How many can you expect to catch in a day and of what sizes?
541493,Guest,2004-07-06 22:04:00,0,"I can honestly say that if you have any skill with a jig, you can catch as many walleye as you want. We fished so many points, bars and ledges it simply didn't seem to matter. We stumbled across using a 5/16 oz tube jig in 3.5"" mud puppy gold (Jann's Netcraft). We use these for smallmouth on Lake St. Clair. In one stretch, our boat landed 38 walleye in 1.5 hours. We counted because we had a contest. We did create a 12"" leader of 50# spectra because of the pike cutoffs. We took our own boats, 2 Lunds 1800 Fisherman and 1950 Tyee. It was absolutely the right decision. After 2 guided trips, we had routes and waypoints to lead us all over the lake. For Pike, you will have to use bigger stuff to catch the bigger fish. While we did catch some on medium size spoons, the best fish came on gold and/or silver large KB Spoons (Ron and Helen's Musky Shop). Work them hard around the cabbage and points. There was plenty of cabbage present by the way. Our largest pike came in 8.5 ft at the mouth of the Dog Hole River in Twiname Bay. The others were caught in the Hog Trough west of Brodribb Bay. Look for 7-10 ft. of water with cabbage or current. The lake can have a great deal of wind. In Brodribb Bay, we spent our last day fishing the current breaks made by the islands. We would sneak around the downwind side of the island and cast up into the current. We caught NUMEROUS 32-38"" pike doing this. Very consistent pattern. Also remember to bring some chartreuse Gator Spoons. They worked very well for both walleye and pike. Good Fishing"
