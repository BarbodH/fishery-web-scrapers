541540,flatland fisherman01,2004-07-08 17:59:00,13,Heading to Sioux Narrows this week Â–end or a week. Looking for any fishing reports for the area. I have fished out of Kenora and Buffalo Bay area of LOW but not the narrows area. Not to sure where to fish.
541544,Guest,2004-07-08 21:28:00,0,"Walleye fishing has been good they are being caught deep and shallow, the area you want ot go to is Yellowgirl and areas west of it.I've been catching walleyes in the shallow bays for the last three days, to day we didn't catch the size of the previous two days but still good fish wee caught.Some guys say they are catching some still in 30-40ft on points and reefs but not sure about what numbers or size.Good luck."

When you get on top of the fish. Don't just keep your jig on the bottom. Jig it up 4', 5', or even 7' off of the bottom and then let it fall real slow. That is what seemed to work best for us. We spend most of our time between ""smiley face rock"" and west end of Deadbroke channel and anywhere in between. Wish I could go with ya!!!!! wiggle"
541552,Guest,2004-07-09 12:44:00,0,"It's been good fishing. LOts of numbers etc. I'm guiding this summer @ Totem Resorts. Sunset Channel & Deadbrook have been good. Look at the humps west of YellowGirl - these have been good. Fish are now up shallow, Redcliff Bay is a hot spot. However PLEASE be careful going into Redcliff - lots of rocks. Head into RC from the north, not the south entrance. Also out by Crescent / Rope the humps are hot as well. Drop by Totem and I'll help you out more if I can (if not, there are others who will help out). My computer access is limited so I won't see a reply to this post. Good Fishen Rob Carlson ""I sure do miss MInaki"""

I am running a Green 1999 Lund Angler 1700 with an older Suzuki. Hope to see you out there. I will be trying bottom bouncers till I find them and then most likley jig. Thanks, again. Bert"
