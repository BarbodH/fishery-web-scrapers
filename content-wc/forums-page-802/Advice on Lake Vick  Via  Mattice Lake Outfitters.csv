541094,Guest,2004-06-23 07:43:00,0,"Never been to Vick. I have fished 11 lakes above Armstrong , plus the rivers and lakes on canoes trips. I'll ask a fellow who has been to Vick what it was like when he was there. I leave in a couple hours."
541097,stukaboy,2004-06-23 07:48:00,14,Thanks. Any info you could provide would be greatly appreciated. I'll check back here in a couple of weeks for an Ogoki/Bellsmith report. Be safe! I'm sure you'll have a great time!
541121,Guest,2004-06-24 11:10:00,0,Where is scorpion point ??? is a good spot. I have been fishing the resevior for 12 years. I never heard of the spot. Can you describe were it is? We are at the resevoir the second week in August. THANKS
541122,stukaboy,2004-06-24 11:19:00,14,"If you have a map of the lake it is the really long point South of the island where the camp is located (I believe it is called Scorpion point???). Alot of the people in camp fished there and seemed to do well. I tkink people preferred it because they snagged less fishing this area. I didn't fish it much myself, but did catch a big pike there(actually my wife hooked the fish while untangling the line on her spool -- I landed it). Hope that helps. As you know the camp attendants for Mattice will always be able to put you on the fish."

541044,stukaboy,2004-06-22 10:30:00,14,"Has anyone ever fished Lake Vick with Mattice Lake Outfitters out of Armstrong, ON? I was considering this lake but I understand that the Walleye fishing is only OK. Looking into another lake with Mattice Lake Outfitters called Bellsmith. We have a party of only 2 people and these are the only private lakes where they'll accept a party of 2. If you know of any other outfitters in the Armstrong area that you could recommend that would be great. Thanks!"
541046,WillieB,2004-06-22 11:46:00,292,"Stukaboy, I'd be VERY surprised if the walleye fishing was only OK. Haven't heard a bad OR average word about any of Don and Annette's outposts....all has been exceptional feedback. I think Vick Lake also gives you a nice portage lake to access and is a decent sized body of water. I think you'd be hard pressed to find better facilities, equipment, location or folks to deal with. If you want, touch base with www.northernoutposts.com. I've heard some positive things about them also, and they're based out of Armstrong. Enjoy!"
541047,Gray Wolf,2004-06-22 11:47:00,32,Try Ogoki Frontier. They will take two people. My wife and I have taken four trips with them. Check out their website www.ogokifrontier.com

541053,stukaboy,2004-06-22 13:24:00,14,"Wow. Sounds like fun. I went to the Ogoki Res Summer of 2002. Great fishing. Are you staying at the main camp with the attendant? If you ask he'll probably take you out the first day and mark all the hot spots on the map (scorpion point ??? is a good spot). The 2 sets of rapids NW of camp are consistent producers. All you have to do is troll in 8 feet of water or tie off on one of a few snags, drop a jig tipped with a grub/crawler or minnow and you'll catch fish. I caught a monster pike at the falls trolling a spinner rig and dead minnow (approx 42"") . One warning though: bring plenty of tackle. Ogoki is full of snags and you'll lose alot, especially if you fish below the rapids. Let me know how your trip goes!"
