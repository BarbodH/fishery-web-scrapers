541237,Guest,2004-06-29 23:49:00,0,"I have heard a great deal about the fishing on this big lake. I am interested in finding out for myself first hand. I have talked with folks who go to the Ear Falls area and others who go to Sioux Lookout, is there any major differences between the two other than one is on the east side and the other the west? Which side is better? What lodges would you reccommend? I would be bringing my own boat and motor up, 1800 Lund Explorer w/ 150 Yamaha 4 stroke. Interested in a place with hot/cold running water, kitchen, etc. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, what time of year is the best to go? Thanks in advance for your help."
541246,Guest,2004-06-30 10:25:00,0,"I hope people respond I too am wondering the pro's and con's of each area. I have gone to both areas, Sioux Lookout we fished lake Minnetaki (2002) never ventured into Lac Seul. And this Year Ear Falls, and by all accounts was not the average year, the Ear falls area intrigued me, lots of bays, point and islands, some very close, many we couldn't get to, or I guess I should say didn't want to get to because of the high sea's."
541248,Guest,2004-06-30 11:32:00,0,I will be leaving for Ear Falls this friday! Fisherman's Cove resort will have what you are looking for. Last year Sept. was great fishing. Sounds like with the cold spring up there fishing has been a little tougher than norm. I will give a report when I get back on the 13th. Yahoo! I would look to Ear Falls area for the best bite. We went through 96 dozen minnows last year with four of us in a week. We do travel 75miles or so by boat in a day so we do work to find the best bite.
541255,Guest,2004-06-30 13:50:00,0,"I just returned last week and we go out of Williams Lake Lodge which is on the southwest end of Lake by Williams Bay. We fish more the route bay, McIntyre bay and surrounding areas. Last week was a tough weather week but we had excellent walleye fishing despite. We had rain every day and lots of wind, but is what I love about LacSeul, you can always seem to find active fish. Largest was 28, but had lots of fish in the 25-27 category. Fish where in 12-20 of water depending on the day and the weather. Did a lot of jigging once we found fish with spinners. I would chose Ear Falls area as well. You have a lot more resorts and as a result a lot more help you can get on this site from folks that really experience the area. Good luck, there's a 35"" out there waiting for you."
541360,Guest,2004-07-03 12:06:00,0,I have flown out of sioux lookout and was at the Golden Eagle in Ear Falls this year. I would imagine Lac Seul on the southeast side would have comperable fishing. The main advanatage of Sioux Look out is Knobby's...good restaraunt.
541433,Guest,2004-07-06 00:22:00,0,Hi. if you go to sioux lookout you have to portage to lac saul. I forget if it cost anything. I am thinking 10 bucks roundtrip. the walleyes are supposed to be at that end of the lake- vaughn bay. However at earfalls if you cant catch fish on the lake you can always go below the dam and the last time we did there was no slot size for fish caught there. we got our full limits of northerns and walleyes below the dam in a day. a little crowded but hay thats where the fish are. good luck. alan
