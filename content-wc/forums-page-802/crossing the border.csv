540967,MTWalleyeHunter,2004-06-19 20:09:00,61,"A Canadian citizen traveling into the US needs a photo I.d. and some sort of proof a citizenship (passport or birth certificate). Children do not need a photo ID but proof of citizenship is still required. If only one parent is traveling with a child, a notorized permission slip may be required allowing the child to leave Canada and enter the United States. When bringing that big walleye boat down make sure you also bring the registration. If you have any other questions let me know as I work for US Customs."
541395,Matches,2004-07-05 06:17:00,236,"I can verify that yes your note from Mom should be Notorized. I just got back from Canada and my brother had his son's birth certificate and a note from mom. At the border they said they could ask us to turn around and not grant entry since the note from mom was not notorized and did not have a contact phone number. Since he was older they let us in. Note from Mom should be notorized, and have their address and a contact phone number."
541397,bigfish1965,2004-07-05 08:12:00,3210,"I know the childrens permission slip seems like a giant pain, but with so many non-custodial parents trying to flee with their kids, I'm glad to see they are diligent about this."
541398,SoDakMac,2004-07-05 09:22:00,218,"We recently returned from a trip to Ontario but entered Canada thorugh Manitoba. Getting into Canada was quick and easy - photo IDs and a few of the standard questions. However, getting back into the U.S.A. took a little longer. They wanted a photo ID plus a birth certificate or current passport. One of us had a photocopied birth certificate, which was not a problem. We had been told that a photo ID was not sufficient to get back into the States without hassle, which turned out to be the case. Once we were pass the border folks, the USFW fellows checked us over very carefully for fish (we never bring any back anymore), booze, etc. It took a little while but went smoothly and everyone was very courteous."

541441,downriverbob,2004-07-06 07:00:00,880,Where are flying into ?
541443,phidelt157,2004-07-06 07:22:00,191,"Sault Ste. Marie, then onto Nakina"
541446,Guest,2004-07-06 08:02:00,0,"We came back from Canada last Thursday. Wait was a bit longer than usual to get back into the U.S.A., about 1 hour is all though. They did not ask us anything other than usual questions, did not even ask us for drivers license or any other type of identification, vehicle registration, or insurance, etc. We had anticipated more questions and request for identification, etc. It was obvious that security was higher than usual, boat was x-ray. We would assume that probably the vehicles are x-rayed too. The officers were business like, but curtious and we had no complaints at all. Interestingly though, it did appear there were alot of vehichles pulled over, going both ways, for closer inspection. We have no problem with this process if it helps keep things safer from drug dealers and terrorist. We are especially happy to hear they are catching the a__holes that try to bring more than their limit of fish back. Canada's fishery is a priceless resource that needs to be protected from these a__holes. By the way, the weather kinda sucked when we there, but we definitely had good fishing, and lots of fish in and over the slot. Thanks, Lonnie"

540749,Guest,2004-06-15 08:44:00,0,Is a driver license only needed to cross the border?
540752,Guest,2004-06-15 09:02:00,0,"I am not sure - I have been told to bring a passport if you have it, if not, then bring a birth certificate. Why not be over-prepared, it worked for me."
540770,Gary_IA,2004-06-15 12:26:00,144,"You need evidence of citizenship such as birth certificate, passport, voter identification card and, I understand, a photo identification card (a driver's license). If your children are going with you and your spouse is not or if you are an uncle, aunt or responsible adult traveling with children be sure you have proof of citizenship and photo identification (you can most likely get one from the driver's license office nearest you for the children) and written permission from the parents for the children to travel with you. If you are not a citizen I think you need an up to date green card, photo id, etc. I haven't been to Ontario for a few years. You might want to check other's experience where traveling with children are concerned."
540771,Guest,2004-06-15 12:32:00,0,"Good call! I forgot to mention that as well. In terms of boats, I bring my dads boat, and I make sure I have written permission from him (with a signature), stating that I have full use of the boat. That way, if they look at registration, and it is not on my name, I have proof that I can use the boat. Better to be safe than sorry. >You need evidence of citizenship such as birth certificate, >passport, voter identification card and, I understand, a photo >identification card (a driver's license).

540772,Guest,2004-06-15 12:50:00,0,Just crossed the border last week at international falls. Going in to Canada they didn't check id's or anything just asked a few questions. On the way back into the states all we had to show was our drivers license.

540886,GLO,2004-06-16 18:47:00,318,Don't take anything for granted. A simple search will get you to the Canadian customs regs. and border crossing information. Find the regs and do what they say.
540887,Reels,2004-06-16 18:48:00,2876,"Same here. Going into Canada, no big deal. Comming back, security was higher than I ever seen. Boarder patrol walking the waiting line, asked for photo id for everyone in the truck. My son, does not have one, but they were cool with the sons birth certicate. We even had our boat x-rayed. Something new I guess. <{{}}><"
540965,Guest,2004-06-19 18:39:00,0,Had to show drivers license both ways but no trouble getting across either way. biggest wait I've ever seen crossing back into the USA on friday.
