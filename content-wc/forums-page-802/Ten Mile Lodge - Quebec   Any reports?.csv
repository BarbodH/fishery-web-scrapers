Spoke with the owner on the phone, traded emails, and spoke with his wife, and they sounded upstanding. However, before we make a reservation and send a deposit would like first hand info. We are thinking of going Sept 11-18. They have a number of lakes with walleye, pike and laketrout. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, O F"

Lake Dumoine is a very large body of water - however with some help from Richard - you will be on fish in no time...there is also an excellent smaller lake called Bell lake - it has some nice pike. Any questions let me know - I will try to answer them...I am actually thinking about going up around the same time - just for the weekend though - I live about 5 hours from this place. talk to you soon Paul"

I noted that your post addressed only Dumoine Lake and Bell Lake. You made no comments about Ten Mile Lake. Was that by design or merely an omission. Although I have been fishing Lake Kipawa for the last 4 years, I'm always researching other spots in the area for future trips. Since you're only 5 hours away, what city/town is closest to your locale. I'm in Ottawa."
541524,Guest,2004-07-08 07:10:00,0,Hey Retire55 I actually live just outside of Ottawa in Arnprior...(small world). I only fished Ten Mile lake twice - we caught a few small pike - but not much luck - it is a very deep narrow lake - with lots of lake trout - however we where not equipped with the proper gear to get down to them....so we just tried some weed beds for pike...I think Ten Mile is best known for Lake Dumoine and the blue walleye - it is a short (5 minute) drive from the lodge to the boats on Dumoine. I am not sure about walleye in Ten Mile Lake....never seen any. Let me know if you need more info...I fish around Kipawa on the May 24 weekend - we head up to Lac Aux Foins....excellent fishery. thanks Paul
541530,retire55,2004-07-08 11:35:00,1029,"Hello again Paul: Thanks for responding. Yes, sometimes, it is a small world. You're probably already aware of the Kipawa site (http://www.kipawa.net/). Several fishermen exchange information there on their trips into Watson and Grassy (Lac aux foins). There was also a discussion of ""blue walleye"" on that site. I'd like to capitalize on your offer for more information. Perhaps you could send me a private message (middle icon opposite my handle) and then we could exchange info via our email addresses."
541550,retire55,2004-07-09 07:25:00,1029,I emailed Ten Mile Lodge about their lakes and the species in each. They responded that Ten Mile Lake has lake trout while walleyes are in Dumoine and Bell.
