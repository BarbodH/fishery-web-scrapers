Fishing was slower than normal but we managed to catch quite a few walleyes with the biggest 27 in.. The northern fishing was the toughest and finding them was not easy as the weeds were not up like they should be. Normally we catch them much easier and get them up to 40 in. This year biggest was 30 in. It seemed that Keg Lake was the most productive, we saw many boats there. We were told that Way North Lodge has been foreclosed on by a bank, this info for those that are interested."
541400,Guest,2004-07-05 11:41:00,0,Did you fish Keg? If so where and how did you do.
541422,Guest,2004-07-05 19:20:00,0,We fished the opening from the Red Lake side then the island to the right of that opening and a hump between that island and the north west shore. We caught walleye off the island (mostly small) and not very fast. The best fishing was on the hump where we caught quite a few walleye trolling in water from 6 to 10 feet. Those fish were 16 to 23 in. and hit like freight trains. There were boats working the islands all the time we were in Keg (4 hrs.) It appeared to us that fish could be caught at various depths but the more aggressive and larger fish were in shallow water. Our largest walleye (27 in.) came out out of 7 feet of water. In deeper water (15 to 20 ft.) we used jigs tipped with worms in shallower water (4 to 12 ft) we used Thin Fins and orange Rapala minnow baits with the occassional Rattle Trap in chrome and blue. Only fished Keg one day.

541477,Guest,2004-07-06 16:33:00,0,"Indyguy, You said the pike were tough but you normally do pretty well. If fishing for pike how many do you usually catch per day and of what size?"
541480,Guest,2004-07-06 17:04:00,0,Hump1 Coming down from Red Lake to Keg was no problem as the rip you refer to was pretty quiet. The island I refer to is on the right as you come into Keg from Red Lake. It is the only island in the middle on the West side of the lake. It is one of the bigger islands in Keg. Hope this helps let me know if I can provide any more info. I left wishing I was going to be there this week.
541482,Guest,2004-07-06 17:17:00,0,"Link In a normal year I would say 20 to 30 per day would be average. Very few hammer handles with the average in the 4 to 9 pound range with 3 to 5 a day in double digits. We would normally catch a 40 in. pike for 2 out of 4 guys fishing in a normal week. This covers a lot of running as no one spot seems to have more than 4 to 6 fish. I have fished at Red Lake at least 15 times in the last 18 years and have a good knowledge of Red, Keg and Gullrock lakes. This is a very good drive in chain with great walleye fishing. Let me know if you have any other questions. PS:My biggest out of this lake is 46 in. with 12- 40 in. or more."
541490,Guest,2004-07-06 20:35:00,0,"Indyguy, Thanks for the info. We were on Gullrock for the first time the week of 6/19. Our weather was very bad with wind, rain and multiple cold fronts. Still, I was very impressed with the walleye fishing. We also had a tough time on pike. I did manage a 36"" while walleye fishing but didn't do much on artificials. We were really hoping for better pike but I think the weather really hurt us. So the quest for the 40"" pike continues. We were considering checking into Way North but I came across your post from last year and I think we may look elswhere. The only thing I can think of that would be worse than being disappointed on pike at a drive in would be being disappointed by a fly in. Plus with what they charge I agree with your post, you would at least expect good equipment and facilities. I've heard great reports on Pike for Gullrock in May. We may need to go that route."
