541445,Guest,2004-07-06 07:48:00,0,My wife and I stayed at this hotel last week on our way north. Accomadations are nice and location is VERY SECURE for your boat. it is located right off the road on the North edge of town.www.rendezvoushotel.com Phone 1 800 544 9435

We stay at the Tee Pee Motel, it is right on the highway as you come in to town, clean rooms, reasonable rates and good parking. The Shore Lunch Cafe next door has a good breakfast. http://usa-lodging.com/motels/minnes...ionalFalls.htmhttp://www.google.com/local?hl=en&lr...6649&oi=localr Rich J"
541496,Guest,2004-07-07 00:07:00,0,"Hi. whatever you do, do it now. finding a nice place is probably almost too late. we always reserve for next year when there. My wife and I always stop at the holiday inn for a good dinner before crossing the border. the place rendevoux is very nice but has limited parking. they have good food too though. So I guess I would just cross the border and have dinner there. I know when we would get there at 6 or so the lot was full almost and not much chance of parking your boat and truck hooked up. thats why I say just cross the border and get there early and parking should not be a problem. the redevouz is first class and the rooms on the lake side have a nice view too.. good luck."
541500,Guest,2004-07-07 08:02:00,0,Call every place you can and book quick. Maybe try the Rainbow Motel or Red Dog. There will be a ton of boats heading up that day to start fishing for the FFCBC.
541520,rebelrn2001,2004-07-07 21:20:00,1563,Try the Makabi Inn in Ft Frances. We stay there on Friday nights on the way north. Never a problem w/the boat but I put the tackle boxes and rods in the vehicle for an added sense of safety. Decent rooms for the cost and location. Not a Holiday Inn but I think the cost was about $56 US. Getting over the border is important to me anyway on the way. That way that headache is over with and you can soon be on the wonderful scenic Hwy 502.
