541451,Guest,2004-07-06 09:29:00,0,My wife and I want to go to a great Pike Fishery next year. I would love to hear from you experts as to where we should go. We will consider an Outpost but would perfer to be at a Lodge. My wife thinks a hot shower and a flushing john are very important. Thanks for any info that will help us make our decision.....Thanks Again
541503,Guest,2004-07-07 12:18:00,0,Bill Check out Hubers Lone Pine Lodge on Wabagoon. There are lots of weed beds and wild rice areas that hold big pike. The cabins are excellent and they have a German Resturant that your wife will love. I would not do the American plan. We just order off the menu for the evening meals and have breakfast in the cabin. There are plenty of walleye there as well. CDM

The cabins at Merkels are very nice. Terry and Merril do a wonderful job. Terry is constantly fixing things for the better and they are already pretty good now. They don't have the food plans at that other place but for $800-1000 or so I can live without German food for a week. Hubers does look pretty nice but we prefer to make our own meals anyway...that way we can do as we please. This last May/June bill for the week came to about $900 American for the two of us. We didn't need to buy gas and I only bought a few dozen minnows (I brought some already frozen). Actually, this spring we took a boat ride and went past Hubers to fish on Dinorwic and that camp is only about 15"" away from Merkels (at about 22 mph). The other lakes they list are about the same distance from both camps. The weather this year was terrible. We had a bad week for the first time in about 8 years. My wife didn't leave the cabin the last 2 days and we left 2 days early due to rain, rain and more rain and cold and more cold and cold water...."
