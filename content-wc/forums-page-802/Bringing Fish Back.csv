541410,Guest,2004-07-05 16:09:00,0,This has probably been asked 100 times but I guess I don't know the answer. We are going on a fly-in. The guides do all the fish cleaning so they should know the answer to this. Do they have to leave any skin on the filet for identification? Answers appreciated. Thanks
