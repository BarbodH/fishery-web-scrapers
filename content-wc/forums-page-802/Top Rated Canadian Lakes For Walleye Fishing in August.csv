541512,McQ,2004-07-07 15:08:00,615,"If you're talking about North Western Ontario only, then it's a poor representation of August fishing in Canada. I can think of so many more bodies of water in Quebec, South Eastern Ontario, Northern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. August is prime big fish time in all these areas and as fall rolls around it's tough to beat the double digit bite in Ontario's Bay of Quinte or the principal waters of Saskatchewan, not to limit what is going on in the Red south of Winnipeg Manitoba either."
541513,Walleyefisher,2004-07-07 15:17:00,159,I should have clarified NW Ontario.
541522,bigfish1965,2004-07-08 00:28:00,3210,"NW Lake Erie, then :D"
541528,Guest,2004-07-08 10:42:00,0,"If it's only northwestern Ontario the answer is Lac Seul, any time of year. In no other NWO lake do you have a greater chance of boating multiple giants in the same day than on Lac Seul. If it's anywhere in Ontario than obviously you can add NW Lake Erie and the Bay of Quinte."
