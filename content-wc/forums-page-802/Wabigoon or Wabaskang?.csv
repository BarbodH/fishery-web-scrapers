541412,cough6609,2004-07-05 16:38:00,48,"Have been to both lakes and in terms of fishing results, they are quite similiar...in terms of water clarity and ""getting away from it"" they are quite different. Wabigoon is a stained body of water that has great walleye, ample smallmouth, northern and muskie (if you're so inclined). It is 10-15 minutes from Dryden and all the conveniences that brings with it along with additional boats, people and lack of wildlife. Nice to run into the town for restaurants, shopping and ""adult beverages"" if you run out. Stayed at Bonnie Bay resort and the Davis's treat you great, have reasonable prices and larger boats to upgrade to. Wagaskang is a clear water body that has plenty of walleye, smallmouth and northern...no muskie I'm aware of, some lakers and if you want to fill your freezer, good size and quantity of perch. Have stayed at Lundy's (boat-in to north central part of lake), and Kingfishers (drive-in at Perrault Falls flow). Lundy's offers everything Kingfishers has except for mobility of supplies. Jerry and Sally Lundy carry most everything you might need and Jerry goes to the landing at least once a week and will bring back supplies if asked. A lot less boat pressure on Wabaskang and I've seen moose, bear, eagles, etc., during my trips there. Price a little higher and another hour drive from Dryden. Lots of info here...depends on what you're looking for. Craig"

You could also stay at a resort on Wabaskang and fish walleye, smallies, and northern, then maybe rent a boat for a day or two at a resort on Cliff/Cedar if you were looking for something different. Anywhere you go up there I think you will enjoy. The only negative about Wabigoon was mentioned earlier about the water clarity, guys I know never see any of the musky they catch until they are out of the water and never see any follows, which can sometimes make for a long day."
