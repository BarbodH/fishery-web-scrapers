541534,verlund,2004-07-08 14:40:00,32,"thanks for the info. I have spoken with the owner about their boats and he tells me they try to put three people to a boat whenever possible but will due two if that is the way the fishing party rounds out to. When we are there we will have 11 people - 3 in 3 boats, 2 in another. I was also the boats have fish locators and PFDs, however don't know first hand - yet! Thanks again for the info, Steve"
541470,Guest,2004-07-06 14:08:00,0,"Anyone ever stayed here? The last two years, I'd drive by it every day by boat on my way out to fish on Lac Seul. Prices for 6 nights, 5.5 days fishing, with boat/motor/gas/cabin is $565. Seems reasonable - considering we don't want the meal plans because we'll be eating fish all day. Let me know your experiences if you've stayed their.www.lostislandlodge.com"
541472,verlund,2004-07-06 15:17:00,32,Can't help you now but am staying there from 7/17-7/23 and would be glad to post something when I return. Steve
541474,Guest,2004-07-06 15:24:00,0,"Thank Steve, I look forward to reading it. If you need some fishing spots, let me know, I have some places for you to try. Just not sure if you've been there before."
541476,Guest,2004-07-06 16:24:00,0,"We've stayed at Lost Island the last four years and are leaving this Friday for this year's trip. I have nothing but good things to say about Lost Island. The people are friendly, the service is very good, and, of course, the fishing can be very good. The owner, however, just sold the lodge this spring to, I believe, his brother-in-law. I'm told by a friend who just got back from there that everything remains the same. We're looking forward to our trip and it looks like the weather is finally starting to be a little more ""summer"" like. We spend most of our time fishing Sen and Grassy Bays. If I can be of any help, let me know."
541484,Tyee Guy,2004-07-06 17:40:00,717,"You are right, Jim and Marlene sold to Shane who is working hard to keep LIL as a true fishing camp.....Had to cancel our spring trip due to business conflicts, but will be there in September.....Say HI to Basil(guide) from Tom, Joe and Marc.........They have a first class operation......."
541487,orchard frank,2004-07-06 19:36:00,1900,"We've been going there since 1993, great lodge. Shane is Jim's brother, has been around the camp off and on since it opened, there are no changes in the operation or quality of service. We were there end of May, crappy weather, but caught fish, in the snow, sleet ,and freezing rain. We're going back 1st week of Sept.Email me if you want to talk. Good Luck. By the way, the meals are Great!! if you don't feel like cooking."
541499,verlund,2004-07-07 07:41:00,32,"Yes this is our first trip there. How is the navigation on this lake. Is there any hidden danger underwater? Any places on this lake you would recommend for walleye? How deep to fish this time of year, what do you use (ie. jigs, spinners, 3 ways, any particular colors, etc). Any info you could provide would be great. Thanks Steve"
541525,Guest,2004-07-08 09:12:00,0,"Tyee: We'll say hello to Basil; he's a great guy who's willing to share info. Orchard: We may also be going back up at the beginning of Sept.; not sure yet. Steve (Verlund): If all your guys are new to Lac Seul, I would strongly urge you to hire Basil or Brad to guide you the first day or two. They would show you plenty of good spots. It's a huge lake and you can run some long distances at times, or you can fish close to camp. The guides pretty much fish jig and minnow or leeches, but we take up crawlers and fish them on jigs and spinner rigs/ bottom bouncers. The guide fee is well worth it. We leave the day before you arrive, so we'll miss you. The rocks should not be a major problem this year with the water level back up, but you should discuss this with Shane before you head out. Last year with the low water, I almost ran up on some rocks just below the water on our first day. I hate to think what that would have done to our trip! I was going ""full speed"". Good luck and have a great trip. Gene"
541526,verlund,2004-07-08 09:52:00,32,"Surfer, thanks for the info. Our group is new to Lac Suel and do have 2 guides booked (Basil & ???) for Sunday and Monday due to the number in our group (11). We are bringing up a couple of flats of crawlers but may pick up some leeches in Ft Francis as well. Looking for some spots close to camp to fish Saturday afternoon/evening. Thanks for any additional info you could provide and I will be sure to post my report when we return. Thanks Steve"
541527,Guest,2004-07-08 10:35:00,0,"You should be able to fish anywhere from your camp to Websters Bay/bridge area, and get all the walleye you want. Fish points and holes - walleye gallore! Anyone ever rent boats/motors from this place? 16 foot with a 50 HP motor, do they put 2 or 3 to a boat? Also, do they provide depth finders and PFD's? Are they worth the money? Thanks!"
