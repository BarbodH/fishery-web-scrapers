541170,Guest,2004-06-26 07:47:00,0,Anyone have any experience on Aubrey Lake- Rocky Island Lake in the Algoma district of Ontario? Also the Mississagi River looks inviting as you drive along 129. Is it worth stopping for a few casts? Thanks.

Most Walleyes averaged between 14 & 20 inches. Although you may want to check out the lake before you bring a boat back to it because it is behind a #### and they drain the lake pretty good in the summer time. We were there a couple of summers ago and the water dropped about 5 feet during the week. I have heard a couple of people say they drain it so much that it isn't much more than a few pools and some small streams.
