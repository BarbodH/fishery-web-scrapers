541409,Guest,2004-07-05 16:04:00,0,believe i read somewhere that some of you guys soak your crawlers for about an hour b4 use. does this work to make them bigger? any downside?
541417,kingsway2,2004-07-05 17:03:00,15,"I take the crawlers that I want to use on that day out of the bedding and put them in a 5 qt. ice cream bucket that is 1/3 full of water to rinse them off. then I take them out and put them into an empty cottage cheese container with holes in the lid for air. I fill it about 1/4 full of water and put the crawlers in it to fish with that day. Than I empty the water from the ice cream bucket poke holes into the lid for air and put a frezer ice pack in the bottom and set the cottage cheese container with the crawlers in it on top to keep the crawlers cool. The water bath does a few helpful things, one it is so much cleaner to handle the crawlers without the mess from the dirt in your boat and it also does firm up the crawlers and they take on some water to make them even bigger. Just remember to return them to the bedding afterwords so they can live without drowning. I hope you and others find this as useful as i have over the years. Regards, Kingsway2 Rich King"

541447,Guest,2004-07-06 08:13:00,0,now that sounds like it's more my speed. pitch 'em in a bucket of ice water. thanks again.
541454,Guest,2004-07-06 10:52:00,0,"About 25 years ago I picked up a book called ""Lunkers Love Nightcrawlers"" which details a method of conditioning 'crawlers. The idea is to pack a wide, short containers (like the old style cottage cheese tubs)with very damp newspaper shreds. Fill to about 1"" from the rim. Lay about a dozen or so healthy 'crawlers on top of the paper, cover with more, unshredded, wet newspaper and apply the lid so that the worms are snuggly sandwiched between the wet paper. Put 'em in a cool, dry place for three or four days. Their bodies soak up the moisture and they swell up like little kielbasas. Poor walleye think the worms are coming after THEM! Eventually, the moisture dissipates from their little bodies, but for a day or two, you've got yourself earthworms on steroids."

541473,Guest,2004-07-06 15:18:00,0,"I learned that trick fishing with Paul Fournier in MN. He puts his crawlers in ice water too. They seem to plump up and are easy to put on the hooks. Once they hit the warmer water they perk right up, and wiggle a lot. I thought they would drown, and go limp, but that's not the case from my experience. It really keeps the boat clean too! Juls"
