510952,Rick,2001-02-06 00:38:00,226,"Nutimuk Lodge is in the North Whiteshell Park and is on a damed reservoir system and you are between two dams called Seven Sisters and Slave Falls with about 24 miles of distance between them. July can be tough. There are several areas to consider and these are greatly infleunced by the water level (current flow) and dog days effect. Sturgeon Falls, La Barrier and Otter Falls are all current points that are productive under the right conditions. Jigs with night crawlers are productive and if you are patient cranking is very rewarding. I have taken many master walleye (up to 13 lbs)and smallies. Normally the goldeye run has started at this time of year as well and these respond to flys, or a bit of nightcrawler on a plain hook presented 5-6 ft below a slip bobber with split shot for line weight.There is an excellent navigational map put out by the Dept of Natural Resources Map Divsion which is very accurate for depth contours and reefs. (stay out of Sharky's Channel or carry a spare prop and a skeg).Manitoba is barbless and no live minnows are allowed in the Park. Hope this helps. Good fishing."
510953,Guest,2001-02-06 10:06:00,0,As the previous reply said....get the charts and be very careful at Nutimik as there are few propellor eating monsters lurking below the surface.
510947,River_eye,2001-02-06 10:30:00,1486,"The river closer to the landing is a bit tougher to zero in on the fish. Part of the reason is that there's more pressure from fishermen, and the other reason is that immediately above the dam to lamprey falls, the river isn't natural, it's a resevoir held back by the dam. This makes it a bit harder to pick out fish holding structure.The best place to fish for walleyes south of lamprey falls is right in front of the dam. It's reasonably fast current, and I usually drift with a jig and minnow, but if you aren't carefull you can lose a lot of jigs. I better presentation might be a bottom bouncer or a weighted rig put together with a three way swivel. I havn't actually tried these myself, but it would only make sense. I've also never fished the spot in the spring, so it might be a better summer/fall spot.Generally in the spring, the walleyes are in a little bit shallower water, but you can still find them deep. You'll find them next to a weed patch in less than 5 ft. somtimes, and other places they'll be as deep as 20 ft. Also, there are a lot of channels between islands and against the shore with moving water, these are the best places to look. I'd suggest trolling crankbaits or spinner rigs along the shores of the islands and through the channels and if you catch one, stop and jig for a bit, then move on. When jigging, use a 1/8-1/4 oz. jig tied on (no wire leader) with a frozen salted minnow, some people like to use plastics but not me.I guide up at the lodge, so not much of my fishing is done near the landing, so there will be people more knowledgeble about the area than me. If you do get chance to come up to the lodge, definately take it. The fishing is quite a bit better. My name is Eric and if you have any more questions you can e-mail me at [email protected] River eye"
510949,River_eye,2001-02-06 10:34:00,1486,"There are a lot of cottages around there meaning that there is a fair amount of fishing pressure. I have boated around there, but never fished. I see people fishing a lot around barrier bay. I'd probably try my luck up past sturgeon falls right up to the slave falls dam.If fishing is your main priority, I'd consider switching to a different less populated area in the park. River eye"

(for walleye)...i understand some have few walleye and lots of black crappie -- which can be fun too. We are thinking of buying something in whiteshell but FISHING for walleye is top priority..help???"
1423691,Larry Mac,2012-04-20 06:23:00,530,"Hi Gilbert, I agree 1000% with mark;510951 about a trip to Crow Duck. I have been very fortunate to have fished that lake several times (4 to 5) and it is truly an experience you do not want to miss. Yes it is Catch and Release walleye. The Small Mouth Bass fishing is very good also. Have a great Trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1424691,sept61,2012-04-22 13:51:00,91,"Definitely give Crow duck a try, I go a t least 2-3 times a year. The fish have been getting a little smaller every year but you can consistantly catch 30-40, 22'-25"" walleye a day.As far as the Whiteshell, a map will be in order. The water level is extremely low. Just got back and I have never seen the water this low in the spring or ever in 30 plus years I have been going there."
510940,Guest,2001-02-04 16:22:00,0,Going to be staying in Whiteshell Park this Summer during July. Anyone know anything about the fishing there? Particularly walleye? And what's the best methods to use. Thanks!
510941,Guest,2001-02-04 19:03:00,0,"My favorite lake for Walleye in Whiteshell Provincial Park is ""Big Whiteshell Lake"". Highlights.....Nice indoor fishing cleaning house with running water.Lake has a two nice campgrounds and a couple of operations who have ""rental"" cabins. Good boat launch at government docks.Although last year was not as good as usual this lake has been quite hot for the past 5 years. Seems the combination of stocking and reduced limits has helped the walleye population blossom. Fall fishing is exceptionally good especially since there is very limited boat traffic at this time of the year.1/4 oz. lime green jigs and salted minnows work good all year round here. Do remember ""live minnows"" are illegal in the park and there is a new rule which prevents the harvest of walleyes over 15inches (this can make things tough in the fall when the big ones are biting)Nice beach for the kids to swim in is also a bonus if you are bringing the family along!"

510946,Iowa Eye,2001-02-05 16:52:00,104,River eyeIf I remeber a previous posting you said you were a guide at Eagle Nest Lodge. We will be staying at Eagle Nest Landing (this is our second year)the first week of June. Last year we did pretty well on smalies and northers but had a tougher time on the walleyes. They seemed to be scatered one fish here one there. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. depth presentation location etc.Hope to see you if we make a run up to the Lodge.ThanksDave
