1424732,@Lunker,2012-04-22 15:15:00,835,"Interesting discussion. Over the past 18 yrs or so, the walleye fishing in NE Lake of the Woods has just gotten better and better - right along with the perch population, in fact. There is a resident smallie population there as well. My subjective observation shows the smallie population, which I would characterize as ""good"", has at best only stabilized if not diminished somewhat. They certainly haven't dented the walleye population at all."
1424818,v-bay gord,2012-04-22 18:43:00,3168,"Bass are not native to any lakes in NW Ontario. They were stocked decades ago, especially any lakes along the rail lines. I guess it made sense ""back in the day"". Even now they are at the northern edge of their range. A 2 or 3 pound bass up here is an old fish. Catch and release for this species has resulted in some excellent trophy fisheries. Killing walleye lakes.....I seriously doubt that this will be an affect up here. I do know of small lakes that were stocked with bass by a ""certain lodge owner"" that now have spread down the watershed. I would agree that it is not really a positive addition. Similarly in our area pike have been introduced in musky only lakes, and now I hear about crappie in some lakes in our area. People who do this need a good ""boot to the head""........can't agree that they are the average American fisherman doing this. More likely the average American lodge owner. (that should generate some comments!!!...but true none the less)"
1424942,Limeyangler,2012-04-23 03:00:00,563,"There are definitely crappie in the lakes round here...they are spreading on the wabigoon chain....lodge owners are now including them on their websites.I even caught a largemouth last year on the Goon......unheard of by all accounts and it took pictures to convince a lot of people who have fished here all their lives.My suspicion was also lodge owners ""americanizing' the lake for clients. Ooooooops....did i just say that out loud?So far i have not noticed a decline in walleye numbers on the goon (there never were any) lol....JK. In fact the area of the lake where the crappie are prolific and also happens to be where i got a largie is where a number of the larger fish and the winning fish for the Walleye Masters were caught last year, an area with a huge population of football size smallies too btw."
1425133,Steve Ediger,2012-04-23 11:22:00,97,"I think part of the problem with bass taking over in a lake is what we see on TV every weekend. We have been preached to for thirty or more years that we should practice catch and release on the bass. I think people (me included) feel guilty about keeping a bass to eat, but think nothing of hauling a limit of walleye to the fish cleaning station on every opportunity. With this mentality, the walleye end up being over harvested. It also doesn't help the walleye population that they taste sooooo good!"
1425148,Bigstorm,2012-04-23 11:48:00,799,Too bad bass dont taste like walleye
1425162,v-bay gord,2012-04-23 12:26:00,3168,They taste better!
1425164,Aaron-IN,2012-04-23 12:32:00,500,"I would never keep a bass (that's just me) but I've eatin bass up in NW Ontario for years simply because my father keeps them all the time and cooks them up when I'm up there. In all honesty, they are a tasty fish but I would still rather have walleye if given the choice. As long as you have pike and muskie in the same system I seriously doubt smallmouth will have an adverse impact on the long term population of the walleye on any given lake(unless its a really small lake)."
1425190,v-bay gord,2012-04-23 13:20:00,3168,I agree with Aaron. As far as keeping bass I am in favor of a catch and release ethic for them. They are fun to catch but grow slowly up here. I've eaten some smaller bass on lakes with a large bass population and they are excellent.......more towards the pike in terms of flavor which is fine by me.
1423977,LunkerG,2012-04-20 18:14:00,12,"Would like some feedback on impact of the early ice out on fishing this year. Heading up on may 25 this year and am usually there for walleye opener. Would seem walleyes will be well off spawn by this time this year. Also, what could one expect for smallmouth fishing? Will be in Ear Falls lake region."
1424050,Knoxabilly,2012-04-20 20:46:00,225,I'd love some info on what the early ice will do also. Not a whole lot of smallmouths in that area. Been noticing more in the last 5 years but nothing reliable but you will catch them among the walleyes
1424440,The Canuck,2012-04-22 02:49:00,67,Give it a few years and those small mouth will takeover the walleye. Not good
1424444,Limeyangler,2012-04-22 03:17:00,563,how did you come to that conclusion?
1424468,fishinmedic,2012-04-22 06:27:00,5,"It has been proven at least in northern WI that the bass(both largemouth and smallmouth) compete with walleyes and also prey on fry. After bass get established, the walleye numbers drop quickly. They have lowered or removed size limits on bass to knock the populations down in my area to try and help the walleye populations."
1424475,Limeyangler,2012-04-22 06:40:00,563,"oh right, i was just wondering is all. Thats kind of what i thought. Bass are open all year here...i wonder if that helps maintain a healthier population of walleye, although Lac Seul has a lot of walleye in it!"
1424479,v-bay gord,2012-04-22 06:48:00,3168,"I don't subscribe to the ""theory"". You can have fantastic walleye fisheries that cohabitate with agressive, toothy fish such as pike and musky. If there is a problem, it is more likely due to overfishing of the walleye population by anglers, not bass. One difference from NW Ontario to Wisconsin, is our lakes rely on natural reproduction, and are managed for quality fishing. Many lakes in Wisconsin are heavily stocked.....basically are ""put and take"" fisheries."
1424600,Bill Krejca,2012-04-22 10:30:00,6107,"As I remember, at one time (maybe still?) the fish authorities in Ontario, and maybe other places, strongly felt that introduction of bass was detrimental to the walleye population. This walleye decrease resultant (around 10% - again, as I remember) was explained by the statement that bass carry an unhealthy (to walleyes) element that attacks the spawned walleye eggs, causing non-hatching to occur. An interesting observation to me was that I saw no further information on this, about the time that bass tournaments appeared in vague. Perhaps just a coincidence. Anybody have any current data on this? Just a random thought or two from an old fisherman. Bill Krejca"
1424688,NathanH,2012-04-22 13:46:00,697,"Fishinmedic. Is dead on. I too am from northern WI,and echo his words. Bass. Kill good walleye lakes. I have taken to keeping small bass to reduce the numbers in local lakes and others should do the same."
1424715,The Canuck,2012-04-22 14:37:00,67,"I would hate to see bass take over especially in NW Ontario, My father in law has fished the same small lakes for over 25 years and has seen the bass numbers multiply like crazy. 25 years ago you wouldn't catch 1 smallmouth but now it is crazy, he thinks that the Americans that fished thse lakes by plane put them in the water system. Like I said before I hope in 25 years time I am not catching bass in place of walleye."
