I have been driving up there more than 6 yrs. in a row. some times the road is a little rough and sometimes not so bad. leave a little extra time to get there and do it safely. Have a good and safe trip. Just watch out for the crazy drivers on that road there are a few"
1425003,Guest,2012-04-23 07:35:00,0,Whats your destination ?we go to lehibou we think its 44 kilometers from clova chip shot on that rd.
1425101,octanehi5,2012-04-23 10:23:00,1104,"I have a group of 10 guys ,we have two camps the first week in july this yr with Air Tamarac at lake Hebert ,its a 45 min. float plane ride from Clova He is the only outfitter on this lake, Its my 6th yr. going back to this Lake. Very hard to beat the quality and quanty of fish we have caught on this lake anywhere in Quebec. If your not catching 150 walleye's per boat in a day your having a bad day. I have not found a drive to lake that even comes close to this lake. If you like send me a PM"

1423708,Guest,2012-04-20 07:11:00,0,Anyone gone from 117 to Clova on the lepine clova rd. need another route to Gouin we pull boats too. any info much appreciated
1423722,bloom08,2012-04-20 07:36:00,13,"I use to use that road going to Caesars bear camp to pick float plane up. From what i have heard that road is pretty bad and some of the bridges going in are down. We use the new route now to get to clova. http://www.caesars-northcamps.com/en/main.htmtry this site and click on....how to get there. there is a map also on the site. This route i have used the past couple of times and a much better road than the old one. North of Mont-Laurier on route 309, just passed the village of Mont St-Michel, turn right on the gravel road to Parent.- Follow directions to Parent (110miles). Entering Parent, after the concrete bridge, turn left towards Clova (55miles).- Follow road signs for Clova or Caesar's North Camps.http://www.caesars-northcamps.com/commons/logoP.jpg- You will easily find us in the village of Clova."
1423785,octanehi5,2012-04-20 10:10:00,1104,as bloom 08 said thats the best way to get to Clova it takes 3hrs to drive the unpaved road many people take there boats and campers that way
1423800,mr-fish,2012-04-20 10:33:00,58,"Make sure to seal everything the best you can, dust will get into everything !!"
1423802,Guest,2012-04-20 10:39:00,0,3hrs from Mt Laurier to clova??
1423894,mr-fish,2012-04-20 14:31:00,58,"Budget 4 to 4 1/2 hrs. if towing boats. The road has alot of washboards that can bounce you all over the road. Really gets scarey hitting them going into a turn. Also sounds like you have a group going, so that will also slow you down."
1423916,Guest,2012-04-20 15:25:00,0,We have been using the penetration road from sennettereTo go to LEhibou When the new road to clova was finished the outfitters stopped maintaining there parts The last 30 miles we average 12 mph beat the heck out of our boats. We have come out the 309 twice ran into maniacs comming north swore we would never do it again but looks like we have to relent. Too bad the lepine clova rd. isnt better straight shot to gouin. But if it was easyit wouldnt be special. THANX good fishin. Kyle870
1423918,Freytown,2012-04-20 15:29:00,770,"3hrs? Forget about it! Like mr-fish said 4-4 1/2 hrs is more like it.If you are loaded up with gear and/or towing a boat, a 3hr sprint will put you in the ditch...count on it.Kyle, the road through Parent is nothing like the Lapine/Ottawa Lac road. That way usually took me 8-12 hrs...I hear that it is worst these days. LOL Go through Parent and enjoy the ride in."
1423926,Freytown,2012-04-20 15:36:00,770,Thru Sennettere is aprox 60 miles longer & the last 20 miles is bruttal like you said. Went that way once...no more.
1423933,Guest,2012-04-20 15:48:00,0,last time we came out through parent took us five hrs
