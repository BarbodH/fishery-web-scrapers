1423822,gonefishing13,2012-04-20 11:14:00,46,"Me and 3 other guys are doing our first fly in trip in like 5 weeks and are trying to finish planning out our food list. Im confused about things like Oil, milk, water, etc? We are going for a week and have a 100 pound limit, though Im guessing we are going to pay the extra $100 for a 100 pounds over to cover beer.. how much of this kind of stuff do you guys usually use to fly in? Thanks!"
1423826,SinOrSwim,2012-04-20 11:27:00,1528,"Usually, your 100 pound limit is for your personal gear etc and not food???It's a guess but for oil, figure out how many times you will cook/fry fish. Then go a little high. We have also taken a funnel with filters (like coffee style filters) and poured oil back into the container. It's a pain in the butt though.I would only take Milk for cooking unless someone just has to have milk to drink. Water, another crap shoot. They will say drink lake water. I know it's safe, but the color freaks me out and we take bottled water. YOu can cut down on garbage by taking the big jug of water vs. the smaller bottles. Everything is a guess and takes a long time to get figured out, and even then still a guess. You will over guess on some things and run out of others. Our outfitter does not charge us extra for weight. THey just fly in extra beer etc on a later flight when they have room. Nothing worse than running out of beer in the middle of nowhere. Personally, it's vacation so I would take what I think I want/need and pay the fee regardless. What is a few extra hundred dollars when it comes to a vacation. In the grand scheme it's a very small percentage of your total trip."
1423827,RistoRap,2012-04-20 11:28:00,434,"I'm sure some of the more seasoned of us on this board will have this down to the ounce. But, on the 2 fly-in trips I've been on, we ran this by the outfitter and he would let us know a typical amount per person/day. Also, since you are there for a week, they should be doing a check flight mid-week and you can have them bring ""reinforcements"" (beer, ice) so you don't have to haul it all in on the first trip.And, a lot of people will leave their leftovers at the cabin so there's usually some non perishables - can goods, pancake batter, etc.. You can't rely on this being there but it usually is."
1423831,SinOrSwim,2012-04-20 11:33:00,1528,"Oh and take extra EMPTY plastic totes or boxes with you. You will always have extra things, either purchased or packed poorly, that need a home. We take several extra empty plastic totes so when we are loading up the ancillary stuff that people will forget to find a spot for, has a place. Our first year or so, we were loading the plane and a random sweatshirt, pillow etc was being handed down the line and into the plane. LOL The guys at the dock will rolll their eyes. Plus, easier for them to pack in the plane if evreything is in a container. We put fish finders, minnow buckets etc in totes. Plastic totes for food, EVERYTHING. For instance, we each take a suitcase and a plastic tote with our personal gear from rain gear to radio etc. We have a couple ""group totes"" that group stuff goes in like toilet paper, paper towels, food items etc. Take a roll of duct tape too!Also, to save on weight take very small shampoo, toothpaste etc. Get one first aid kit. If everyone takes a 500ct advil, it takes up space and is not needed. Just make **** sure whoever is responsible for it, has it and packs it."
1423844,Guest,2012-04-20 12:16:00,0,"We have never flown in water..We just boil our water and then refrigerate. Just get in the habit of doing a couple of pictures in the morning when you make breakfast and you are good for the day. Not sure I would ever trust just drinking from the lake, but some guys do it and never get ill.. As suggested earlier you can coordinate what everyone in the group is bringing up so you do not duplicate items.. It all adds up towards your 100lbs.. We bring in our own food and we will freeze meals and use it for cold packs on top of our crawlers. Have a large old styrofoam cooler that we put the worms in and them pack the frozen meals on top them.. Also coordinate your tackle so you you do not end up with alot of extra weight.. Seems like we take less stuff up every year and now get away with jigs in various weights and then a few select spoons and hard baits for trolling. Lots of ways to cut down on weight with just a little pre-planning.. Even with all our efforts and fine tuning, we still always come up a few pounds over our 100LB goal..(Our guide fly's in the beer ahead of time or we would really be in trouble)"
1423856,jambi,2012-04-20 12:51:00,504,"Found that I took way too much gear last year. Cutting back heavily this year, especially on the pike stuff. This way I can bring more bacon!"
1423861,TroyMansfield,2012-04-20 13:09:00,92,"oh theres lots of good tips, I have seen lots of guys bring some stuff to go in the bush with that me laugh out loud, ask your outfitter if its possible to fly your beer out prior to your arrival, sometimes they have room on previous flights. thats we do usually, and try to limit the amount of boxes and totes,use them to protect food items, use duffle bags or soft side bags otherwise, this makes it easier for the pilot to pack all your things and use all the space, Dont pack big tackle boxes, if all your doing is walleye and northern, and lake trout I am sure you can put together a tacke box made out for each boat, not each person, dont bring stuff you dont need, I have had guys bring so much stuff they dont need, at our camp the price is for your group and 100lbs per person of gear and food, if you know your going to be overweight just call the outfitter in advance, and let them know and they can proly work it out, and be accurate for your arrival, they book planes on tight schedules if there busy, we also run filter system at our outpost camps that make the water safe to drink.... good luck fishing"
1423872,a3dad,2012-04-20 13:25:00,115,"We pre-plan every meal and just bring what's required. Often we pre make things like chile at home freeze it in ziplock bags and just reheat at camp. No extra weight for cans, etc. We also make a list of shared gear (with the person who's bringing it) and personal gear and send it to everyone on the trip. Keep it simple and cover the basics first. Add the luxury items last. Water is heavy so decide how you feel about drinking lake water. As mentioned before, boil and cool it. If the stained lake water / taste is an issue bring some powered drink mix (gaiteraid, iced tea, etc) to add to it. I don't think we've ever come in under our weight limit, but as long as your not 2x or 3x over you should be ok."
1423980,oleJoe,2012-04-20 18:19:00,114,"LOL You already have to much fishing gear! Food wise , just sit down and do your meals. We eat breakfast and then go fishing till about 4 then eat supper. Our outfitter has fish fryers so we use that for fish and french fries. A gal of oil and use half of it for 3 days and then strain it and use it with the rest of the oil, We just sit the oil in the bbq grill and close the lid. (just like McDonalds) Water , we take a PUR water pitcher and 3 filters. Pur is suppose to take out the giradella and one other bug that causes the problems. It usually takes 2 filters for the week for 6 guys but we take an extra. Snacks at night are chips , dip, salsa, pretzels , nuts, swiss cheese, and ham and crackers. we can take 110# per guy and usually make it every year. DO NOT count on anything being left there. It might be from the guys before you or 3 weeks before you. We leave nothing and want nothing left. Just a lot easier cleaning up when the time to leave. The fishing should be great so enjoy"
1424007,@Lunker,2012-04-20 19:17:00,835,"FWIW, here's a little something I typed up after a couple fly-in trips.... Each person's baggage weight is usually limited on fly-ins  each person has to give up x lbs of weight to the group's quartermaster for food allocationPlan on having steaks for your first or second meal  they will of course be well frozen  anything else that can be should be well frozen - you will be transporting your perishables from WI to the take-off point in standard, hard-body Coleman/Igloo/etc coolers  just moments before weighing gear and takeoff, transfer your perishables to styrofoam coolers (much much lighter), using the steaks and other frozen items (bacon and/or sausage for breakfast) as your ice  duct tape the coolers closed  burn the coolers (as opposed to dragging them back home) after you arrive in camp and transfer your goods to the refrigerator  the frozen items will last plenty long for thisAs part of menu planning, spend some time wandering through a grocery store, looking at items very carefully to see what you can adapt for purposes of lightweight menu planning  also don't be afraid to try some of the dishes at home before making final menu decisionsThink in terms of powdered drink mixes (iced tea, sugarless Kool-aid, powdered Crystal Light, etc)  unfortunately I have not yet located a powdered bottle of beer or martini  instant potatoes can be used both for a side dish as well as fish breading  look at self contained dried noodle/rice dishes  take along a bag or two of frozen vegetables (chopped broccoli, corn, etc) and add a cup or two to the noodle/rice dishes to both bulk them out and add some varietyTransfer everything possible (even canned goods such as baked beans, etc) to ziploc bags to 1) increase convenience, and 2) eliminate weight  obviously, you'll now have to keep these perishable items in the coolerPre-measure your menu items out in ziplocs before leaving home and write the directions directly on the ziploc with a magic marker  for example, pre-measure a meal's worth of pancake batter into a ziploc and write the directions on the plastic bag (ex: add one cup water and two eggs)  the time spent at home is worth time saved in campSame thing for dessert  for example, empty large box (or two) of pudding into ziploc  pre-determine and add the corresponding amount of instant milk so all you have to do is add water  and again, write directions on the bag Also bring along a bag of chocolate chips and perhaps walnuts or raisins and add a handful to each batch of pudding to zip it up a bitConsider taking a fish grill if nothing similar is provided in camp  it's very economical in price, lightweight and takes up little room  allows you to bake or grill fish rather than taking the extra weight of oil and breading for fried fish  then just leave it in camp when you're done rather than dragging it home againDon't forget a small but broad supply of spices  salt, lemon pepper instead of plain pepper, crushed red chili peppers or hot sauce if anyone likes a bit of zip, a bit of dill, etcDO consider that small something special if your weight allocation will stand it  perhaps a bottle of wine (and a corkscrew in your pants pocket) for that steak dinner and a small bottle of REAL maple syrup instead of Mrs Butterworth's for your flapjacks those little creative treats can be very special as the wolves are howling in the distanceThink very very seriously about fruit  in the past, our guys said they wanted it but then most went unused  and it weighs a LOT in a relative sense  we finally decided if anyone wants fruit, they bring it on their own as part of their own weight allocation, rather than against the group's food allocation  yes, fruit's good for you but a bottle of vitamins weighs a whole lot less if you're not going to eat the fruitIf you're not already using them, look very seriously at zip-off pants  they are SUPER for this type of application  zip off the legs and convert them into shorts for warm days  you only need two pair for the entire weekConsider the layering concept when packing your clothes  and pack very very judiciously  sacrifice a third shirt for a pair of long underwear bottoms which you might need, etc - you really will be surprised how long you can wear a pair of socks or underwear or a shirt when you need to consider weight limits  and in worst case scenario, you can always rinse out a few things, wearing the long underwear while your pants are drying  after all, who's going to see you, except for the bush pilots flying wayyy overhead?If you think you'll be needing an anchor, just take a length of ¼ rope (30'-40') and a replacement nylon landing net bag  just fill the bag with rocks and tie closed with one end of the ropeShare the weight responsibilities for items everyone will be or might be using  think sharing rather than individual use  first aid kit, bug dope, pliers, etc  how many tubes of toothpaste or bottles of shampoo do you really need?  sounds small, but in the long run, it all adds up, especially in your case when you're trying to figure out how to get three more muskie-sized crankbaits packed into your limited weight allocationFor liquor, can you be satisfied with a bottle of booze rather than a case of beer?  the bottle will weigh much less than a case  I pre-mix a bottle of Manhattans and just take the single bottle for the weekIf you have something like a fly-fishing vest (perhaps borrow one if you can), stuff as much of your heaviest tackle as you can into those pockets and wear it under a very light jacket  don't let the pilot see and you'll get away with it not counting against your weight limit  of course, the plane won't know the difference whether it shows or not, only that you really ARE over the weight limit and you'll probably crash and burn anyway!!!Eliminate the weight of the tube you might transport rods in  split your rods into two separate groups  place each half of the rods opposite each other, tips to handle and vice versa, making sure the handles stick out slightly further than the length of the tips (in other words, the handles extend a bit further so the tips are protected and won't break off  tightly wrap newspaper around each end of the package and tape tightly with duct tape (lining with newspaper first prevents the duct tape from sticking and stripping off cork from the handles when removed)  this creates a fairly protected and sturdy package of fishing rods that won't need the extra weight of a tube to protect them  then just exercise a bit of care when placing them into the planeAlso, JUST IN CASE you end up over your weight allocation and intend to reduce baggage rather than pay for your overage, HAVE IN MIND the order in which you intend to reduce your gear rather than waste time prior to takeoff humming and ho-ing, trying to decide about what am I going to leave behind?"
1424013,michigan walleye guy,2012-04-20 19:28:00,95,"All great points! We always try to have our outfitter fly in our beer ahead of time--at 20 lbs. a case, you can save 100 pounds of weight right there. Having only one guy do the grocery shopping also saves on weight, as it cuts down on duplication. For a six-night fly in, I bring a meal of ribeye steak, chicken breasts, chops, and spaghetti box mix, and plan on fish fries the other two nights--on three of the days, we have shore lunch, and on the other three days we substitute breakfast for lunch. Meaning we eat twice a day. Somehow, fish, either deep fried, pan fried, or grilled, makes it way onto the menus, even if just as an appetizer. Nobody ever loses weight on these trips.The big area where we are going to try and change this year is in the live bait area--flying in 100+ dozen minnows and a couple pounds of leeches can easily add 80-100 pounds of weight. With everything I've been reading about salted minnows, I'm gonna try them, plus a flat of crawlers."
1424564,octanehi5,2012-04-22 09:17:00,1104,"the 100 lbs usely covers your gear and food ,It is a very hard number to hit, most of the time we have to pay for over weight flight. we have found with our outfitter it cheaper to fly in or own beer than to pay his price at the lake, for 6 guys we also fly in 10 gals of bottled water and boil anything else we use. At $.75 - $1.00 a pound for the cost of the extra flight, its worth the extra not to do without anything, then split up the cost between the group. I have been taking this type of trip for more than 20 yrs. This is the way to go. This is a trip you will remember the rest of your life do not make the mistake on scimping on anyhing. If there is a ? about the weight you are aloud, I would call the outfitter ,that way there are no suprises, Have a great trip"
1424590,dog2,2012-04-22 10:18:00,198,"from the info posted by the previous people take heed to it .wish i had all this info when we made our first fly in . That was many moons ago. like Lunker we have pared our food list way down more dry items less beer a little more booze.The lake water is off color and taste like the lake either boil it or use a good filter if filtering it take a piece of clean cotton cloth and pour the water thru it before running it thru the filter, helps on the filter life. For menu preplan your meals do this for each day will save you unnecessary weight and waste. allow for one extra day incase of heavy fog o r rain and the outfitter can not fly We use dry milk; powered drink mixes dried foods when possible[rice packages,noodle mixes, dried fruit inplace of fresh fruit]. we usually take 1/4 oz 3/8ox jig heads 100 of each per person 6-8 rapalas several spoons dardevils,johnsons,handful of bottom bouncers and trolling weights. small tool kit for emergency repairs on reels. first aid kit .BEFORE LEAVING HOME MAKE SURE EACH PERSON HAS ANY MEDS THEY TAKE WITH THEM. Make a check list for each person as to what they are responsible for, this saves duplication. read posts take notes and enjoy your trip."
1424652,tsquared,2012-04-22 11:59:00,57,"Bring dry gatorade mix and boil the water-eliminates the color issue and if your trip gets extended due to weather you will never run out. Check with outfitter to see if they are providing any basics-canned food, condiments, etc. Otherwise, as mentioned earlier one person does the shopping to reduce overload. No matter what, my experience is you will have twice the clothes you need, way too much fishing gear and will run out of beer."
1424737,@Lunker,2012-04-22 15:24:00,835,"One other thought.....plan on ""cooking"" just 2 meals / day - breakfast & dinner. When you cook fish, make extra. For your lunches, make cold fish sandwiches or fish tacos with your left-overs. A chunk of fish on some good, heavy bread, with a dab of mayo / tartar and a slice of raw onion just doesn't get any better, as many, many of the guys here have testified. Top if off with an ice cold beer and you're in heaven......as if you haven't already realized that long before your first lunch."
1424004,deputy dog,2012-04-20 19:08:00,305,"Unless ice is provided keep empty water bottles and freeze with lake water for ice to keep beer cold. As mentioned before you will all have entirely too much fishing gear but will learn that after this trip. We have our beer flown in ahead of time which is a lifesaver. I always seem to have clean clothes leftover as well. As long as I don't get wet I seem to put the same clothes back on a few times. We use the same oil all week as long as you don't scorch it it will last. 100lbs adds up quick so weigh at home if possible and write weights on masking tape on each large item, ie: duffel bags etc. have one of the wives bake a ham also, good for sammiches and in eggs also. Good luck the first year is a learning experience."
