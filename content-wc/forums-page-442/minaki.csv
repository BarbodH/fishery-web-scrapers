Minaki Lodge used to be the premier fishing destination in Canada for the rich, famous, and everyday fisherman. The Lodge has gone through numerous changes before it mysteriously burnt down a few years ago. That was tragic because the main lodge was a north woods gem! Duane Hel! and family came to town, started to buy failing fish camps, and had brought new life and energy back to Minaki. The town has gone to Hel! in a very good way! Thanks to Duane! Duane's son Corey, is the best guide in Minaki! I can vouch for reefrnr on that. Last June I was having problems locating walleye's in the transition stage. I booked a day with Corey and he located the walleye's and we also bagged 2 mid 40 inch Musky's, in the 25 plus pound range. Best fishing day of my 3 week trip! Also, made PCoves homepage cover picture with Corey! What a great day, guide, and fisherman! Yeah that's Rivratz and Corey! Can't leave Minaki without saying hello to Corey's gorgeous wife Mandy! She runs the store at the PC marina. Just really nice folks all around at PC in Minaki! Duane also was fortunate to get Pat and Bob back to operate the restaurant. There a other good fish camps in Minaki, but, I give Paradise Cove 5 Stars in every category of what it takes to be a successful fish camp. I'm glad that Minaki has gone to blazes!
