1425394,MorganMan,2012-04-23 18:23:00,341,Lololololololololololololol......now that's funny!
1425464,PRD1,2012-04-23 20:20:00,458,"Take along a crock pot and fix a nice meal before you go out. When you get back you will have a great meal ready, all you have to do is open a bottle of wine and enjoy."
1425659,3M TA3,2012-04-24 09:12:00,2846,"About 15 years ago we got tired of eating fish. Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish. That's all we ate. So...we started collecting road kill on the way up. It's really added great diversity to our menu and some of the mixed stews have been exceptional. Grocery bill for 4 guys is just under $17 total. Hard to beat."
1425687,fishinnut 3446,2012-04-24 09:46:00,638,"X2 Moose,Bear,Just kidding but Narda1 and DanBear are spot on when talking about Bullpit steakhouse,just don't know about that Rye stuff!"
1425905,Bill Krejca,2012-04-24 16:15:00,6107,"Gotta love it! Hmm.. you can't beat a dead horse. On the serious side, you might consider when, as well as what. What we've been doing for years is just having 2 meals a day, breakfast and then a mid-afternoon supper. Only 2 meals to prepare, so less prep time, less work. We go out evening fishing, and don't have to prepare yet another meal that evening. More time for cards. Bill"
1425912,wallydave,2012-04-24 16:34:00,2151,"We like the drive-in option, no limits on what we bring to camp. Breakfast can be instant oatmeal, great to have a microwave in the cabin! Some morings, eggs bacon or sausage, and hash browns. Of course coffee and cigar go with beakfast!! Lunch, it depends, most days we have lunch in mid-afternoon, fresh walleye, taters and beans. Ok, a V8, for my veggies, a beer and cigar. Back on the water sometimes we stay out until dark, or we come back early 7-8PM for burgers, brats or steaks on the grill. This year we are taking along some tenderloins to fry up. When we stay out late, we fry up some walleye and taters, beer and yes another cigar!! Chips, tatter salad, salsa and peanuts for snacks. We eat well and fish hard!! That the life at camp!!"
1425920,Rivratz,2012-04-24 16:51:00,105,"[SIZE=""3[/SIZE] OMG! Btmbncr what are you thinking? Your bringing your new bride to Canada for your honeymoon and your going to be eating chili, echilada's, etc. and probably washing it all down with some ice cold brews. Sounds like it's going to be a gaaassss!!! Hope the fish are biting and You bring a tent. The little woman's going to make you sleep outside with the skunks! Fresh fish at least once a day! Don't forget the Beano! A honeymoon you both will want to forget! Just having some fun with you! Congratulations!!!!"
1426016,SinOrSwim,2012-04-24 20:35:00,1528,You don't need to know the meal plan. SHE will be doing the cookin'!!!!! That's why you are getting married and taking her right??????
1426062,Nimstug,2012-04-24 22:22:00,2605,"The last couple of trips we do a slight variation of the above. Main meal is in the early afternoon 1-2-ish depending on the bite. The back out on the water until sundown which is about 7:30 / 8:00 when we go in the fall. If you feel like a munch late, there is lunch meat, p-nut butter and honey, chips, fruit, etc. Each person is on their own for preparing and cleaning up after the late meal. And we never leave a good bite to eat. NimstugThe physician can bury his mistakes but the architect can only advise his clients to plant vines. -F.L. Wright"
1424773,btmbncr,2012-04-22 17:15:00,492,"When I went to Canada with my father the meal plan was easy,ribeyes,fried fish and chicken on the grill.Taken my new bride will be different.Other than eating fish in the evening I thought I;d take things that are quick and easy to prepare.I don't like cooking and cleaning up until late when you get back in from fishing.Besides it will be our honeymoon.I'm thinking about making chili,stuffed peppers,enchiladas and freezing them to heat up when we get back from fishing.Bill"
1424778,Rich B,2012-04-22 17:30:00,1081,"Bill, Run a search on this Canada board for ""camp routines"" and ""meal plans"".....not long ago there were a number of posts on different groups and their meal plans and their daily routines....even a few from some that were husband and wife (as opposed to a guy's group). Congrats on your upcoming wedding and honeymoon at the lake.....that's what I did 33+ years ago.....we got married and then spent a week at a cabin in northern Minn.....the following week a lot of my family joined us at that camp....her family thought we'd never last (what did they know ? ha !). You must have a good woman to head north on her honeymoon.....don't be surprised if a few of the Walleye Central younger guys want to know if she has any unmarried sisters !! Take care, Rich B"
1424969,Hawker,2012-04-23 06:13:00,3967,"But Rich,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, why would they have to be younger WC guys?? (I know, I need LOL) Sorry btmbncr (Bill), back to your question, I couldn't resist!!I'm assuming your going primitive or possibily to a fly in for your honeymoon, but have you considered maybe taking her to a good camp/lodge that offers American Plan? That way you can devote your time together with her and not have to do any of the cooking, meal planning, clean up etc! I know a great place,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and they have a honeymoon cabin!!"
1424991,REG,2012-04-23 07:20:00,445,"Congratulations. I could probably live a couple weeks just on fresh fried fish with some burgers and steaks on the grill to fill in. But if you're looking for easy, don't forget the crock-pot. One thing I like is lazy man's Italian beef. All you need is a lean roast, a crock-pot, a packet of brown gravy mix, and a jar of sliced pepperchinis. Drain the juice from the pepperchinis into the crock-pot and mix in the dried brown gravy mix. Add a little water, throw in the roast, dump the pepperchinis in, set on low in the morning, and you have Italian beef when you get in that night. Chili is good in the crock-pot too. Maybe the bean-less variety since it's your honeymoon..... just sayin."
1425023,JayM5209,2012-04-23 08:01:00,1050,"REG, that's probably my most frequent slow cooker recipe - - - with a few minor variations. I put the roast in, sprinkle a package of dry onion soup mix over top, then pour a half to 3/4 cup of red wine around the edges of the meat.btmbncr, if you decide to take a slow cooker, here's the easiest full meal you can do. Follow REG's recipe for the beef roast. However,before putting the roast in, cut two onions in half, five or six new red potatoes into quarters, and two carrots into one inch pieces. Put all the veggies into the pot 1st, then REG's beef on top. Set on Low and go fishing for the day. When you get back to the cabin, pour two glasses of wine and serve a great dinner!"
1425057,Danbear,2012-04-23 08:53:00,72,"This year for diner we are going to eat off the menu at Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake, should make our trip much easier with no need for large amounts of groceries to bring, just breakfast items, snacks and a big bottle of your favorite Bourbon."
1425099,Pikeslayer8,2012-04-23 10:23:00,1460,"Dude, you will be on your honeymoon and that's all the game you got. Actually, your plan isn't too bad. May I suggest fresh fruit and yogurt with granola for some breakfasts and Walleye Chowder should be included. Way better than Chili. Bring in a couple of filet mignons wrap em in bacon and throw on the grill. I've had my honeymoon on Shikag and the way to go about it is to make every night in camp seem more special than the last. Chicks dig a guy in fish camp cooking for her."
1425175,NARDA 1,2012-04-23 12:46:00,636,"You mean RYE don't you!!!!! btnbncr; Check out www.birchdalelodge.com they have 2 modernized cabins that have hot tubs inside the cabin. Their american plan is awsome in that you chose from the Bullpit Steakhouse menu just like a resturant, instead of everyone eating the same thing, so if you want steak every night you can do that.I took my wife up for our anniversary and had them put a bottle of wine and flowers in the cabin so it was there when she opened the door. She loved it up there and she doesn't really like to fish!!!"
1425215,wallydave,2012-04-23 14:33:00,2151,"Goose Bay isn't too far from Ear Falls, one night you might go to town for a meal, just to change things up. Check with Andrea, she can help with local dining. Grills are available if you want to grill steaks or burgers, freezem before you leave home. We are taking some tenderloins and sweet potato fries this year for a break from walleye. Breakfast is a meal to remember, I take frozen pre-sliced sausage patties, they are easy to cook and transport. The good thing about a drive-in like Goose Bay, is you are don't have to worry about weight limits like a fly-in. You night want to consider some frozen meals for two, check the frozen section of your favorite grocery store, you can have a different meal each night, Chinese, Italian, whatever you and your bride like! Don't forget some nice desserts, if your so inclined! My wife and I just return from a trip to Rome, she loved that I had made most of the plans well ahead of time, but also left some flexibility for trying places the locals go to. It sounds like you have a ""keeper"" your starting off well by trying to make the right plans!"
1425226,TIGHTLINER,2012-04-23 14:54:00,223,BOY DOES THIS BRING BACK MEMORIES OF 44 YEAR AGO NEXT MONTH. I AM SURE YOUR WIFE TO BE WILL BE IMPRESSED WITH YOUR COOKING EITHER PREHEATED OR FIXED FROM SCRATCH. REMEMBER WHAT YOU ARE THERE FOR MAKE IT A SPECIAL WEEK FOR HER.

YOU ARE STARTING OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT IF SHE LOVES TO FISH YOU HAVE A WINNER. MY WIFE IS SPECIAL TO ME JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR HONEYMOON WENT IT HAS CARRIED ON FOR 44 YEARS. GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY THAT WEEK IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL BE A GREAT ONE. LET US KNOW HOW THE FISHING WENT.
