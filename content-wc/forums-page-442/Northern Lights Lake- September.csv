However, I will be climbing the walls this winter if I don't get a couple of fishing trips in so I am going to try and head up to Northern Lights towards the end of September. In the past, I have had a hard time locating walleyes in September as they do not seem to be on mid lake rock piles. Where should I start my search that time of year on a big shield lake with tons of structure? Big points, between islands, big rocks near shore, should I still poke around mid lake structure, etc? Any thoughts are appreciated."

September was a lot more difficult time to find fish than June but not impossible. My largest Walleye-at least that I boated- a 12 pounder was a September fish. I know weather has something to do with it but some of our best fishing trips up there were during the crappiest weather- windy,cold,rainy and sometimes snow. But that being said where we found the walleyes seemed to change every year. Sometimes they were deep-30 feet plus and sometimes we would find them in the shallower bays when the wind was blowing into them but usually with deep water near by. We spent a lot more time moving and hunting for the fish then other times of the year. If I learned anything about that time of year it was don't waste to much time in any one spot- keep moving till you find them. The neat part was while checking out the deep water structure if the walleyes weren't there we might end up picking up lake trout and sometimes really big smallmouth-4 pounders all the way up to my biggest-a 6 1/2(another September fish) and once in a while big northerns. Loved that time of year up there because we would rarely see anyone else on the lake- at least on the north end where we would fish. I might be talking myself into another fall trip up there after reliving some of my old trips- great memories.....Randy"

If I'm prospecting for fish I'll run heavy 3-4oz bottom bouncers and worm harnesses dead slow.Once the fish are found in concentrations I get a lot of fish on oversized sucker and chub minnows in the 4-8"" range on simple live bait rigs with suitable sized hooks. A small fluorescent corky or floater rigged inline about 6-8"" from the hook will many times help trigger strikes.Another method is sitting right on top of them (use your graph) and jig heavy spoons like Hopkins, Swedish Pimples or Buckshot spoons.I'll use a fast jigging motion...really rip the spoon then let it slowly settle. You can really trigger a lot of strikes that way, almost always on the upswing, and they're usually violent.The downside to fishing such deep water is obviously mortality.I've had some success fizzing the air bladder but by and large it's catch and keep when you're that deep.The other pattern which can produce post turnover, just not as consistently is ironically the exact opposite.Look for any shallow lush green weed you can find in less than 10' of water. There's not generally a lot left that time of year and the fish will make brief forays into these shallow weedy waters to feed.In my experience it's usually boom or bust. When it's on it's pretty amazing. Generally we'll rip larger bucktail jigs right through the vegetation to provoke hits.Good luck on your trip and congrat's on the new arrival coming your way."
1425617,Guest,2012-04-24 08:02:00,0,"Wow! You both gave me a few ideas, I appreciate it. When I was a teenager working at Gunflint Lodge during the summers there were a few really good guides that worked up there and they would have big releases almost every day. It took me a long time to figure out how to start picking a few big walleyes off the rock piles in the summer. Now that I can no longer afford to go elk hunting in the fall I want to learn how to have some success with big fall walleyes. Hopefully I figure a few things out before I scratch all my hair off. Randy it has been a long time since I have fished Northern Lights as well and I need to get that lake back on my radar. I remember a lot of the walleyes being real thick from that lake. I like fishing Saganaga but the fish are so dang skinny in that lake. I used to love catching the shorter but much heavier walleyes in Saganagons but I am still salty about Queticos bait ban."
1426022,catran3,2012-04-24 20:43:00,29,"Well you mentioned 3 of my favorite 4 lakes in that sentence- every once in a while I would borrow a small boat and 10 hp and also fish Seagull. I made it up to Saganagons 2 or 3 years in a row and really got into the bigger walleyes there- rare if ever to catch one under 5 pounds but not much over 8 pounds on the top end though either. The first time I fished Sag was the year the state record was caught and all we caught were small ones. In 1980 we were back on Sag with a guide friend of ours from Gordy's guide service. We picked up 'eye's up to 9 #s but all the fishermen coming back from Northern Light were just raving about the fishing over there and that's when plans were made to go to Northern Light the following year. The rest is history with two trips a year up there for many years until I ended up selling my boat in the later 1990's. Been using the canoe since then but could only get my wife and son out in it once last year- they just didn't like fishing out of a canoe anymore. So the search for a boat began and I finally found what I was looking for in February. Was planning my first trip with it to Northern Light this spring but got invited to take it to Sturgeon Lake a few hundred miles farther up the road instead. Plan on taking the family to N.L. the last week of June- hopefully the fishing is as good as it used to be. The wife and I spent our honeymoon at Gunflint Lodge back in June,1993- you weren't around there then were you? We try to stop by there at least once a year and get something to eat and visit........Randy"
1426132,Guest,2012-04-25 06:16:00,0,"I was working for Gunflint Lodge during the summer of 93 but was a canoe guide at the outfitters, so I was not around much. I have spent more time watching a bobber on Sea Gull than any other lake the past few summers. It has been a consistent producer of 26-29 fish for me. I usually fish that lake by myself cause I worked hard to find some spots and I like to keep a lid on them. It takes a while to learn a lake paddling around in a canoe. I did take a good friend down there for a few days with me last summer and he caught a real nice walleye one night, probably pushing 11 pds. I am hoping to eventually find a rock or two on that lake that kicks out 32-33 fish but maybe my friends big fish was an anomaly."
