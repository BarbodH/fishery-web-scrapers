1425522,81Saluki,2012-04-24 05:05:00,97,"After reading/following Larry Mac's ""Way Points/Coordinates"" thread, it got me to wondering how many of you (not camps/lodges/guides) would be willing to share your favorite fishing locations. No need to provide coordinates ... just reply with a YEA or NAY to indicate whether you'd do so or not. ;-) -- 81Saluki"
1425606,rnnonmt,2012-04-24 07:43:00,992,Yes and I have traded before.
1425623,camp chef,2012-04-24 08:10:00,915,I don't use those newfangled coordinate thingys but I have and will gladly help mark up a map for someone going to a a lake I am familiar with.
1425676,fishinnut 3446,2012-04-24 09:34:00,638,"Yes ,I have and will do again and again but make sure their not there the same week."
1425927,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-24 17:11:00,235,"If it's a remote lake, who cares. The reality is that hot spots can change year to year. Your honey hole could prove to be poop hole for someone else."
1426026,TroyMansfield,2012-04-24 20:46:00,92,"yes and usually only with guys at our camp, but to be honest, most of its in my head, just recently started using gps units in the past couple years"
1426042,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2012-04-24 21:22:00,629,"I believe that providing general area locations on a map will be the best, as I'm sure we all recognize ""exact"" waypoint locations are generally not going to be consitent. Fish move around, but there are areas that will generally hold fish. If I do pass on a waypoint of one of my favorite spots, it's because there has been multiple successful catches in that exact spot. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1427792,Bluff,2012-04-28 15:40:00,152,"I have become a little reluctant to share the info anymore. All I have asked is for feedback as to what happened when someone tried the locations. Last few times, even after several requests, I never heard back from the people I gave the information to. Part of sharing the information involves gauging success over time. Feedback is important."
1427890,Larry Mac,2012-04-28 20:22:00,530,"Hi 81Saluki, I have both shared and received marked maps with WC members in the past. When going to new lakes they have been very helpful in making our adventures successful. I have also received feedback on info that I have shared and it brings me great joy when I hear it worked for fellow WC friends. I have always been amazed at how open and helpful the members on this site have been. Thank you all for your most generous help.I have never used a GPS (yet) but certainly can see the many benefits it could provide.Thank you and have a great year,Larry Mac"
