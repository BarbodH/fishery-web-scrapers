1423597,Skywagon,2012-04-19 20:39:00,1106,How about hiring a small float plane to take him back to I Falls?
1427842,Rich B,2012-04-28 18:22:00,1081,"My thanks for all those suggestions....my buddy and I are going to hit camps north of us that run a ""Friday to Friday"" week and see if anyone has an open seat to take him back to Int'l Falls (airport)...he has a early afternoon flight out, so hopefully one of the groups can fit my buddy in for some gas money (and free legal advice.....as my Buddy Jack said it will be worth every penny they paid for it - ha). Northairtaxi is another possibility, though we'll talk and see if any group near our camp can fit my buddy in on Friday. Appreciate the information and advice.....19 days and counting until we're fishing Cedar Lake! Rich B"
1427852,Golden Eagle,2012-04-28 19:01:00,2642,Sounds good if the driver is a Central Illinois cropduster.
1423097,Rich B,2012-04-18 20:16:00,1081,"Our groups (from Ohio, Wisconsin and Minn) are heading up one month from today to spend opening week at Cedar Point Lodge on Cedar Lake (Perrault). One of our Ohio group is in charge of his 50th High School class reunion, and has to fly out of Int'l Falls airport on Friday May 25th, as the reunion is the next day. We're pulling out on Sat May 26th to head back, and I'm hoping that someone has a contact at one of the camps nearby, or a group leaving on Friday that my buddy can jump in with (and pay for gas, etc) to get him down to the Int'l Falls airport at the border by late am. Our camp owners don't know of anyone, nor are any of the other groups in camp leaving early that week....thought I'd post a note here, and see if anyone has any suggestions....I'll drive him down to the airport if need be, though we're both hoping to find a local person that he could pay to drive him down or jump in with a group heading down to the border that Friday. My buddy looked into a rental car though didn't find any rental car agencies at the border. Thanks, Rich B"
1423147,P. Norts,2012-04-18 22:17:00,396,Maybe try Craigslist- Rideshare in Canda??????
1423156,JDP,2012-04-18 23:38:00,1457,"Rich,I know Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul up the road towards Ear Falls works off of a Friday to Friday week for guests. Sooooo, maybe a visit in person to Onaway on Saturday or Sunday evening just after supper could help set up a ride. Maybe Blair and Kathy (Onaway's owners/operators) would know of a candidate or two, for example long time guests whom they would recommend approaching."
1423179,Golden Eagle,2012-04-19 06:06:00,2642,Have you checked the bus schedule?I thought flights were discontinued from International Falls to Minneapolis or wherever your friend is going. Glad to hear they are still running.
1423318,LOW1,2012-04-19 10:30:00,2828,http://www.northairtaxi.com/Could these folks help you out? I have never used them but it may be worth a call.
1423470,Rich B,2012-04-19 15:53:00,1081,"My thanks to each of you for those great suggestions......I'm passing them on to my buddy, and we'll see if anyone staying that week at Onaway Lodge would let him jump in on their way south on Friday am or he'll look into return transportation via the Northairtaxi website. I didn't want to mention it in my first note, but my friend is an excellent attorney (defense for civil cases - not criminal) and whoever would give him to ride back to Int'l Falls would have about 3 hours of free legal advice (ha) and some good laughs talking about that week's fishing ! Appreciate your help ! Rich B"
1423522,Golden Eagle,2012-04-19 17:38:00,2642,"I checked for a bus schedule. Don't think buses make that run these days. Don't know how many are in your party or how many vehicles you will have. But, if it somehow works to have your friend drive a car to International Falls Airport and leave the car in the parking lot, I could squeeze in one or maybe two guys that Saturday morning, for a ride to the parked car. I'm not sure how many guys I'll have in my van that Saturday morning, but will know for sure in about a week. I'll be flying out of Little Vermilion Lake Saturday morning and depending on visibility, will be heading out of Red Lake around 9:30 a.m. Give me your numbers and I'll get it on my mind.Would I need to have your guys walk through customs or would it be safe to haul them?"
1423536,Rich B,2012-04-19 18:12:00,1081,"Thanks for the offer, though we'll have (3) in my Expedition on Saturday and I'll also be towing my rig back from to Ohio....that was thoughtful of you to offer though ! Rich B"
