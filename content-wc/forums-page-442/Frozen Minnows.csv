1426460,IaDave,2012-04-25 15:04:00,476,There is a bait shop just off of I-35 between Mpls & Clouqet that will have them ready if you give them a couple of weeks. Someone on this board recommended them but I don't remember the name. If anyone has it please post because I want to take some this June. Thanks.

We just turn up without calling and they always have plenty available We bring our own salt and ziplock bags and pack a gallon and half ourselves. Only because one of our guys prefers it that way - I would pay the $2.00 and have them do the salting!Turn at Co Rd 10 off I35.
