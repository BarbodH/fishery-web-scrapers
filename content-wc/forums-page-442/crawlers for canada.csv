1426031,BennieS,2012-04-24 20:52:00,108,Anyone ever order a flat of Canadian ready crawlers from Cabelas? Was the delivery in a timely fashion? Was the crawler quality acceptable? Can anyone give me an idea of the cost of crawlers at the resorts they've stayed at in Ontario?
1426169,nicko,2012-04-25 07:10:00,508,I've always bought mine over the border. That way no issues with crossing border with bait and bedding. Where are you headed?
1426181,Jig Man,2012-04-25 07:37:00,95,I have used Cabelas in Richfield 3 or 4 times. You place your order a week ahead of time. They get there bait delivered on Tuesday or Wed then hold it for you to pick up. Decent bait packaged in a styrofoam container packed ready for the boarder..
1426254,tv4fish,2012-04-25 09:36:00,2694,"I just have to throw this out. We have been buying a ""Canadian"" flat of crawlers for years right here in Minnesota. We have bought them from different private vendors --- guess where most of them get their crawlers ?? - You got it -- from Canada."
1426286,octanehi5,2012-04-25 10:27:00,1104,The name of the company to get good healthy night crawlers is wholesale bait company on the net .Cabelas sucks I get 1000-2000 every yr just make sure they are in worm bedding not dirt for the crossing of the boarder
1426341,cuamb,2012-04-25 11:22:00,203,I used Speedy Worm in Minnesota last year. Ordered one day and had them the next. Very hardy and price was good. Just google them or one of the other suppliers.
1426348,Bigstorm,2012-04-25 11:34:00,799,"For the little bit of crawlers we use, I just order them up there. Last time we just got 6 cartons, each carton had 18 crawlers, $4/carton.I could see where if you were using crawlers exclusively, it would be better/cheaper to bring them with.We use minnows (live and salted) for most of our fishing. Trying crawlers last year was just an experiment."
1427596,catran3,2012-04-28 07:17:00,29,How did the 'trying crawlers last year was just an experiment' go- were they better or worse than minnows or about the same?
1427605,Bigstorm,2012-04-28 07:32:00,799,I cant say that the crawlers worked better than live or salted minnows for walleyes. The only downfall to crawlers is that the dont last as long on the jig.
1427832,Rich B,2012-04-28 18:01:00,1081,"When I have headed north via the Soo, I would most times buy a carton of Crawlers from the Dundee, MI Cabela's store.....and they were healthy and packed in paper (as opposed to dirt). On a trip last summer, a half-carton we purchased had all dead crawlers....we stopped at Dundee on the way back and got a refund.....first time ever for dead crawlers (whew !)....we would also get them into our cooler so they didn't get warm on the drive up.....didn't matter this last time. If you're not having them shipped and buy them at a Cabela's (or another store) do yourself a favor and have the box/carton opened and check them out...might save yourself an expensive discovery up at your camp (the crawlers up north were more than twice the cost).
