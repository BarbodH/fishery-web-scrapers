1426669,Hawker,2012-04-26 05:48:00,3967,"Gotta be honest, we haven't boated a trout one (nor hook one) but have enjoyed catching some very nice pike, walleye and smallies. Over the years we've made the portage several times, and for us it's more for the change of scenery and the clear water etc!In reality, if it's Lakers your after, ""rpieske"" gave an excellent suggestion in regards to loading the boat and trailering up to Crow for a day of Lake Trout fishing, excellent smallmouth fishing and for sure some dandy Muskie challenges!"
1426798,Dodger31,2012-04-26 11:12:00,18,Thanks for all the suggestions and info. If our resort owner tells us the portage is working well we will give it a try!Hope everyone has a great trip this year. About 50 days and counting for us!
1426851,nelsenpac,2012-04-26 13:37:00,24,So I've been plotting out a trip to Whitefish to do some walleye fishing next July? Are there especially good areas that I should try? I was hoping there are some spot with less pressure.
1427306,Bill Krejca,2012-04-27 12:52:00,6107,"For the past 50 years or so, walleyes in Whitefish for me have been harder to find than in Sabaskong. Because the water is so clear, some folks troll - long line - the bays at night using Rapala type baits, and get some very nice fish. During the day in the southern part, casting twister tail type plastic on jigs with overhead spinners into shallow weeds has worked well for me. Bill"
1423416,Dodger31,2012-04-19 13:48:00,18,Wondering if any WC guys have had the chance to fish lake trout on LOTW? Our lodge is kind of near Turtle Portage and there is good trout water on the other side. My question is how much work is the portage and is it worth it to head over there and try for some trout. I have experience trolling and jigging trout in other waters and would really like to take a full day and learn this area of LOTW. Thanks for any help/advice on this.
1423609,Bill Krejca,2012-04-19 21:03:00,6107,"Re: The track used for portaging - I haven't used it for a few years, but one of the problems with it was that the track did not go far enough into the lake. This can result in the dolly running off the end of the track, potentially creating a problem. If the water is high enough, the chances of going too far are reduced; low water may increase the chances of over running. This is an excellent case, also, for bringing some strong young guys along to crank the wheel that pulls the boat up the incline. Perhaps the above problem has now been fixed, if so, go to it, the water in Whitefish is much clearer than on the Sabaskong side, and the scenery is great! Most of the trout water is a few miles up, starting at about Calvert Island, where Whitefish Bay Camp is located. Early in the season, some trout are taken starting near the portage, but as the water warms up, relatively few are taken in that part. Bill"
1423682,Ia Walihntr,2012-04-20 05:58:00,320,"Possibly, you are staying at Duck Bay Lodge. This lodge is a stones throw from the portage. Dave and Sherri, owners of the lodge, would be happy to help with information. I'm sure that they would know how the portage was operating at the close of the soft water season last fall. Phone # is (204) 757-2986, or e-mail them at [email protected]. Good luck. Marv"
1423699,Dodger31,2012-04-20 06:57:00,18,"I am actually staying at Red Wing Lodge down just North of Morson. This will be our third year. It's kind of a haul to the portage and I have an email into the owner to ask about water levels. Thanks for the replies so far.Hey Bill, sounds like you are familiar with the area. Couple questions...how far would it be from Red Wing, Gill's Marina area to the portage and then to Calvert Island? And will the track support a 17.5 alumacraft boat? Thanks!"
1424212,Bill Krejca,2012-04-21 11:44:00,6107,"Dodger - Ballpark-wise, about 10 miles from your camp to the portage, another 8 or 9 miles from the portage to Calverts. I have stayed at both Red Wing and Whitefish Bay Camp. I have stayed for 20+ years at the camp just NE of the present portage, which has been razed, and is now in private hands. The original portage was there, a small float-able stream during high water, and a log ladder pull-over during low water. Later, I camped for another 20 years in that area. I also camped in Obabikon Bay and Obabikon Lake a number of times. The mechanical portage should be able to handle your boat; as it could change, I would check with your camp for present condition. For the past 10-12 years, I have stayed at Young's in Stevens Bay, fall fishing for crappies. If interested, contact me at [email protected], perhaps I can give you some tips on the area. Good luck. Bill Krejca"
1426226,nelsenpac,2012-04-25 09:03:00,24,"We have a cabin by Red Wing Lodge and used the turtle portage over memorial weekend last year. We had a 18 ft crestliner with a 115 yamaha motor on it. Your boat floats on to a crib/cart and there is a wheel at the top of the portage to pull your boat/cart over the portage. Unfortately there is very minimal mechanical advantage so the bigger the boat, the harder it is. Bring some muscle along!!!"
1426281,Hawker,2012-04-25 10:11:00,3967,"It's been a couple of years since we used the Turtle Portage, but I can testify to the ""bring extra muscle""! LOL Once you get the boat on top, it's easy, then ride the brake on the downhill side! If memory serves me correct (sometimes it does, other times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, well...................) it takes 6 full revoultions of that six foot diameter wheel to move the boat one foot!"
1426293,Knutson21,2012-04-25 10:31:00,348,"I am not sure what the situation is now or if anyone maintains the system, we were there in June of 2010 and the cables were all twisted up an not connected properly to the wheel. It looked like it hadn't been used for a few years. We actually spent the time about 2 hours to untangle the cables and re-enginner the system to make it work. Becuase it was not connected correctly we had to spin the wheel one way to get the boat to the peek and then spin the wheel the opposite way to get the boat to roll back down the other side. Was it worth it now we lost a lot of fishing time that day. It was a fun experience to say we did it."
1426425,Dodger31,2012-04-25 13:35:00,18,To the last three posts....after dealing with the lift issues. Did you actually catch some fish? I don't want to waste a 1/2 day getting the boat in/out if the fishing will be tough. I love a good challenge but time is precious up there! Is there a good population of trout in that area?Thanks again!
1426426,Knutson21,2012-04-25 13:40:00,348,We actually went the revearse of what you want to do. We went from White Fish to Sabaskong. The plan was to throw for Muskies. We raised one on the day between two boats. However we didn't get much fishing in. As for Lake Trout we fish for them once in a while. One year near Bell Island we nailed them down about 45 feet over 60 to 90 feet of water. The little we have spent after that year we haven't found them.
