We have caught some nice fish up there but I have found other places that produce as well or better. Like any other area it takes a while find the ""holes"". This is a big area and one day of fishing might not be enough. If someone can show you some spots on a map it would help."
1427374,thatvoodoothatyoudo,2012-04-27 15:38:00,79,"This June will be my 35th straight trip to LS. With the early Spring, I would not advise targeting Wapesi in June as my experience is that the large % of big fish have moved down to the main lake areas. Wapesi musky is always a good bet however- even some nice pike on island points next to deep structure, especially if the wind is howling. best regards, TVDTYD"
1427432,rnnonmt,2012-04-27 17:59:00,992,"Have fished Wapesi plenty of times. after the little zig zag to get in there on the right are some reefs right at the surface. Nice smallies and usually a lot of slot walleyes especially in the rocky shoreline bay continuing on the right. There is an island shaped like a pitch fork in central Wapesi that I can remember that has produced large northern over 40""). Have done well with decent walleye and 38-40"" pike at the little rapids all the way east at the river. When you get to the fork at the split at the far eat end stay left (south) to the little rapids. troll in as far as you feel comfortable to the rapids and drift out. Lots of doubles/triples of walleye on each pass. Set up again and repeat procedure. One word of caution traveling through Wapesi is there are a lot of (just under the surface) carnage causing rocks/reefs. Good luck and have fun. Post your reports when you get back."
1428077,tly,2012-04-29 10:23:00,1900,"You won't get lonesome. Early on there is alot of traffic. This is both good & bad. Good = follow someone in their wakes at a respectable distance (think minesweeper) Bad = lots of competition & jockeying so much water, so much congestion Historically it has not been worth the worry, there are so many other spots. As pointed out, the fish are heading back. Timing is everything."
562285,Sutsgold,2006-12-12 09:33:00,219,"We are thinking of making a one day trip from the deception or hudson landing all the way up to wapesi bay in the spring. I have heard stories of great end of March, early June walleye fishing. We do enjoy the scenery, so a hour boat ride is not a concern to us, however, we want to catch fish. Is this trip worth it? Are there other closer bays with better fishing in March and early June? Is the area a sanctuary. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. In my mind it is already walleye season."
562286,2 DOGS,2006-12-12 10:56:00,361,"You better stick with June, I don't believe the walleye season is open in March."
562287,Mohleye,2006-12-12 11:58:00,368,"The boat ride could be a little longer than an hour in March, too."

562295,Sutsgold,2006-12-12 21:17:00,219,"We were thinking of memorial day weekend to make a trip up there. Ive heard great stories, but have not found much about it on the site. Has anyone ever been up there during may?"
562324,Guest,2006-12-15 17:49:00,0,"I fished Wapesi Bay 2 Springs in the first week of June when we were staying at Chamberlain Narrows. A lot of folks talk about Wapesi Bay, but actually I think it is a matter of where you have had good luck fishing. We certainly did better in other spots than I personally experienced in Wapesi. Wapesi is a good distance from Chamberlain Narrows and we got caught out there when a bad wind came up and it was a long trek with a camp boat back out of Wapesi and back to Chamberlain Narrows. Wapesi itself is not a nursery as I recall, but if you continue on past the mouth of Wapesi you will eventually get to a nursery area. Be very careful on your approach to the mouth of Wapesi as there are a lot shallow areas. One buddy did in his lower unit. Even inside Wapesi around one of the first island is a very shallow reef that depending on water levels will either be just under water or above water. In the very far back end of the Bay you can cruise on up stream to a waterfall. I have heard that is really good at times, but we only picked up a few smaller walleye. So, given the right day and the right weather you could do really well in there, but you can say that about a lot of places on Lac Seul. NE Piker"
562326,Guest,2006-12-16 06:28:00,0,I should have added it is considered a 35 mile boat ride from Deception Bay to Chamberlain Narrows. It took us about 50 minutes following the camp boat to the outpost at Chamberlain Narrows. From Chamberlain Narrows to Wapesi Bay is probably another 20 minutes. NE Piker
562364,Guest,2006-12-18 21:04:00,0,"We have been fishing Wapesi throughout the first week in July for a while now. In my opinion it is the best walleye fishing of the entire Northeast region of Lac Seul. However, I don't recommend you make the trip unless you have someone along that knows the area or have someone markup a map of the danger zones (also the best fishing spots). As mentioned in previous posts there are many under water land mines. Even though the open water water looks safe there are at least 5 places in open water that can easily take out your lower unit. In my experience the biggest fish have been in about 6-15 ft near these lower unit danger areas. If you make the trip try and pick a day that there isn't a strong breeze or steady wind, Wapesi can get rolling pretty good and it can make it difficult to hold the bottom with a jig without getting snagged every other minute."
562369,Sutsgold,2006-12-19 11:57:00,219,We have the navionics map of lac seul that is pretty good for navigation. Although the map would not have all the shallow reefs on it I would imagine we would be able to reach wapesi fairly easy with it.
1427203,Guest,2012-04-27 08:57:00,0,"Fek went 2 years ago in June. Didn't catch any big ones, just a 42"" muskie by luck His skills lack the abilty to be a good fisherman. I use the word man reluctly. Good Luck the ride is great."
