1427309,Catman59,2012-04-27 12:56:00,345,And a lot of Canadians would flee the country !!!!!
1427676,115 optimax,2012-04-28 10:43:00,650,"I don,t touch the stuff too much,and i don't see anything wrong with someone blasting a bat around the fire!We drink lots around the fire and most of the time the hang over is horrible,it kind of ruins the next day for awhile but at the time it's just too much fun.I guess the hang over is a small price to pay to let loose and act like a goof ball once and awhile."
1427677,115 optimax,2012-04-28 10:46:00,650,That probably WOULD happen!
1426772,Rivratz,2012-04-26 09:29:00,105,"Absolutely Nothing!!! Why do you think we plan these trips to Canada every year! Been going since 1970. Only missed 2 years! Huge Minaki freak! Been to Lac Seul & English River. I'm with Bigwalleye! Leave all the BS behind Tons of fishing lakes in the USA! None of them compare to Canadian Shield lakes and sceneRry. Sure you miss the family! Who actually misses sex with the wife??? Who actually brings the wife? Not many I presume. Why spoil a good thing! Most wives can't wait until we leave. The kids are too busy with friends. Don't feel guilty leaving them behind. You are going to fish Canada to cleanse the soul! You are a better father after your cleansing. Guilt free! Enough said! I'd rather fish than F the wife! Sad but, ohhh soooo true!"
1426781,castnblast,2012-04-26 10:01:00,111,"Hahahaha...thats funny right there, I don't care who ya are!"
1426826,ripnlipstaknnames,2012-04-26 12:40:00,27,I dont miss a %#$@ thing when im in canada!
1426838,Mike Kansas,2012-04-26 13:10:00,1463,I miss the wife always wanting the checkbook or the credit cards. I miss the kids wanting gas money or an extra 10 for mowing the grass. I miss the neighbors dog tipping my trash can over. I miss the night all my wifes friends play Bunko at our house. I miss going to the Dentist and getting a Root Canal. I miss the neighbors kids band practicing in their garage. I miss Dancing With The Stars. I miss four putting from 10 feet. I miss the Politicians and all their cool commercials. Maybe I should just stay home this year so I don't miss all these things....NOT
1426852,Fishoil,2012-04-26 13:38:00,1277,If it's not OK to miss the wife would it be OK to miss the neighbor's wife?
1426869,Mike Kansas,2012-04-26 14:08:00,1463,Long as you are not my neighbor.
1426880,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-26 14:36:00,235,"Marijuana. Too risky to bring it across the border. I certainly don't need it to have a good time, but one little session per trip during a nice sunset wouldn't be bad. And for the ignorant and deludedly self-righteous who want denounce me, just imagine if alcohol was completely banned up there....many of you wouldn't even go."
1426884,bergsh,2012-04-26 14:52:00,183,"I certainly don't miss work.I do bring my family with me. Got a young guy I am starting early so he develops a love for fishing just like I have. It will be his second trip up there and he isn't even 2. It is ok to bring the wife but I do miss the old times we used to have with just the guys. Wood splitting contests. Drinking excessively, smoking cigars. General vulgarness. 14 hour days in the boat."
1426894,tv4fish,2012-04-26 15:07:00,2694,"You got a point there, judge. But, Heaven forbid - if Canada does THAT, many resorts would be going out of business................"
1426911,maxxum,2012-04-26 16:01:00,275,"I would go if you couldn't drink, but I do love Molson, Labatt's and other fine Canadian refreshments. I miss my kids. Someday I'll take them."
1426598,Fishoil,2012-04-25 20:34:00,1277,I miss a couple of very good friends who used to go along before they passed. I also miss a couple who no longer go along because of health issues or age. I'm extremely thankful that my father is still able to go along yet. Not to mention my daughter and the other relatives and friends that go. We should be thankful for the things that we don't have to miss.....yet.
1426605,moose-hunter,2012-04-25 20:48:00,982,"I miss my Dad. He got me ""hooked"" on fishing and took me as much as he could. Both in the states and north of the border. He's in his upper 80's now and health issues keep him pretty well grounded.Thanks Dad!! I owe you big time!!!"
1426651,bricken,2012-04-25 23:01:00,14,"my kids. I have a really hard time leaving them back in Iowa for 10 days when I am so far away with no phone. My 8 yr old is a major daddys girl and is mad if I leave for a weekend so you know the guilt trip she gives me. And all 3 of them are accident prone. What if they got really hurt while I""M gone? it kinda makes me feel like a bad dad to be SO FAR away with no phone. So when we are leaving town and heading north bound, it is really hard on me. I feel very guilty! Until we get there. once we pull in that driveway, it all seems to go away. I still may wonder how they are doing of course. you give me canada, a boat and a pole and I have no worries, and no stress. Thats what I love about it. no stress, no phone, no clients, no yelling kids and no nagging wife. just you the boys, fish. and whiskey."
1426661,Shellback,2012-04-26 05:01:00,8083,You might consider renting a satellite phone?
1426670,Hawker,2012-04-26 05:51:00,3967,I got nuttin!!
1426702,jambi,2012-04-26 07:08:00,504,Gotta say I miss my Dad bigtime while I'm in Canada. We made 11 trips together now he can't muster the strength to make it. I keep hoping he has one more trip in him...
1426727,tv4fish,2012-04-26 07:55:00,2694,"And here I THOUGHT this was going to be a ""clean"" thread"
1426742,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-04-26 08:16:00,138,Ever notice how much better the women look towards the end of the trip?
1426749,LOW1,2012-04-26 08:34:00,2828,"I am looking forward to my first trip of the year, which is shaping up to be me, my 8 year old daughter, my daughter's same-age friend, and the friend's dad, who is a good friend of mine. Should be a good trip. My wife and other kids and some others may come up later in the week.I decided some time ago that its best to to take the people and things that I miss along on the trip."
1426750,Jimmy Jig,2012-04-26 08:38:00,1905,"I miss nothing at all, my dog is with us!"
1426453,MidWestFishman,2012-04-25 14:39:00,44,"The thing I miss most is that my Dad who was my fishing partner passed away in 2010. We can no longer rib each other about the others fish, getting snagged, backlashes, missed fish, etc. We would start bragging on the drive up to the lodge about how we would out fish each other and it went on the whole week. The memories are sweet but sure do miss him as I have to go solo to Canada now."
1426457,LOW1,2012-04-25 14:50:00,2828,"I am quite sure that my dog would rip my throat out while I slept if I left him behind. Last year were his first trips and he likes it at least as much as everyone else. When we all go we have to take two cars so that everyone fits, but it is worth it. And this gives us room to throw in a few of our kids' friends, which is nice for them"
1426467,5 of Diamonds,2012-04-25 15:21:00,151,"I'd have to agree w/ MidWestFishman. For me, it is my best friend Kevin Francisco who passed away last August. I haven't been up there since. We started fishing together in the late 80's and he began having health issues about 5 years ago and couldn't make the fly-in trips into the bush anymore.I don't know about you other guys and this may sound kind of strange but for me personally, there is something theraputic and spiritual about fishing in very remote fly-in destinations. It's a part of who I am and there is more that I get out of these fishing trips than words can explain. Before I leave on every trip, I remind my wife that if something unexpected happens to me during my trip not shed any tears but know that this is one of my preferred exits."
1426538,wallydave,2012-04-25 18:46:00,2151,I do miss my wife she does encourage my wilderness get aways! I miss the guys that used to join us up North. Other than that not too much!
1426545,Fishin Fun,2012-04-25 18:57:00,218,I miss not being with my dad up there like the good old days. Otherwise there's nothing I miss while fishing in Canada. Is that a bad thing? I don't think so!
1426553,bigwalleye1,2012-04-25 19:19:00,2632,"I miss a walleye once in a while. I try to miss snake pike on purpose. I prefer to miss the really shallow rock piles, but there is one I didn't miss. I really like to miss lightning in the occasional Canadian rain. What DON'T I miss while I'm in Canada? Traffic, news, politics, whiners, road rage, construction, work, cutting grass, the daily grind, bad coffee, a hundred and one demands and distractions, traffic jams at the boat landing, inconsiderate fishermen (hey I fish Mille Lacs, so I know, I know), having to get up earlier to go to work than to go fishing."
1426557,MorganMan,2012-04-25 19:26:00,341,"With 4 kids and a wife, definitely had some struggles missing the family over the years. Oh, and nobody has mentioned sex yet.......I call to give her an ETA once we hit the states and let her know if I'm not home yet at that time to get started without me. It's amazing what a week in the bush (canadian) will do for ya."
1426579,Ranger319,2012-04-25 20:04:00,166,"skin on my fingers!! From thumbing all the smallies, battles with those pesky hammer handles, retying and having the line slice into your hand/fingers, etc. By the end of the week my hands are raw but **** I love getting them tore up!!!"
1426591,Moondog,2012-04-25 20:19:00,362,Sleeping without waking up scratching myself until I bleed. That's it.
1426597,gfish,2012-04-25 20:33:00,23,"My kids, as I want them to experience it, and my dad. Other than that, absolutely nothin'. Summer fishing in Canada is paradise!"
1426356,Bigstorm,2012-04-25 11:46:00,799,"For 51 out of the 52 weeks a year, I miss being in Canada. Fishing for 12 to 15hrs a day without seeing any other boats (usually), eating fresh walleye everynight, playing cards until someone falls asleep in the middle of a hand, no laptop/cell phone and being cut off from the real world is the perfect vacation for me.I always call the wife as soon as I get back into the US to see how she is and how the week was, along with seeing the dogs (our kids) have been. My next question is ""how did the Brewers do this week""?Aside from famliy, what is it that you miss most while you're on a Candian vacation?For me, it's listening to Bob Eucker call the Brewer game."
1426360,wolverine fan,2012-04-25 11:49:00,71,Yesterdays fishing!!!! LOL
1426361,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-25 11:50:00,725,"Well, most of all I miss.....well, there's the things at home....um well work is.......um, the kids are grown so......Geez, I got nuthin'"
1426365,Esoxchaser,2012-04-25 11:56:00,1576,It's half way across the river. Never stay long enough to miss anything.
1426379,Lovetofish,2012-04-25 12:21:00,458,My dog as we make a family trip. When I back my boat in the driveway and start loading it up she becomes depressed. But we don't have room to take her along and our camp has a no pet policy.
1426384,tv4fish,2012-04-25 12:27:00,2694,Since I KNOW my wife doesn't read this forum .................. NOTHING !!!!
1426402,octanehi5,2012-04-25 12:53:00,1104,Start a new post What do you miss most when your not in Canada.I do not miss anything while I'm there
