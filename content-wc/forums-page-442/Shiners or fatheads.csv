1427126,Guest,2012-04-27 06:57:00,0,"When I use a full crawler, nine times out of ten when I get a bite I only have half a crawler left. I started going to half a crawler and now when I get a bite it usually is a pretty aggressive strike and you know the whole (half) worm is in its mouth and you set the hook. No more feeding line out and counting guessing when he has the entire worm in its mouth. Results more fish and less worms per trip. Now all I use is a half of a crawler. Went to a fishing seminar this past winter and that is what the pro's are recommending for the slow death hooks also. GOOD LUCK!!!! Fishing time is fast approaching."

1428081,tly,2012-04-29 10:35:00,1900,"Finally gave up on frozen/salted minnows. Tired of mess, cracked fingers from drying out & enhanced by gill cuts and mostly do not think they are efficient. They are soft and tend to go through alot of them. I have been using Northland's Mimic Minnows since they first appeared and they have worked very well. At LS I find the blue shad seems to work best, almost any size. When we do make them it is a tedious operation but we wind up with flat packs of ziplocs with a couple dozen per package so we do not thaw many at once and when we need more they do thaw fast."
1426273,Ranger319,2012-04-25 09:59:00,166,"With all the talk on frozen minnows lately, do you guys prefer one type over another? i.e shiners or fatheads?"
1426350,Bigstorm,2012-04-25 11:36:00,799,"I've never tried the shiners, only fatheads (salted then frozen). Shiner would cost too much I would think"
1426359,TroyMansfield,2012-04-25 11:48:00,92,"I would say either are a horse a piece, you will do better with live bait, Ive always had better fishin with live bait, and lots of times with clients on guide trips and at out outpost camps, live minnows are the best. a good Dace minnow is the best I find"
1426421,Mohleye,2012-04-25 13:26:00,368,"I'd agree with Troy. I'd go with crawlers and/or leeches before I'd bother with preserved minnows. As far as live minnows, whatever the ones with the red stripe are called, when you pull one of those out of the minnow bucket, it seems like you catch a walleye before it hits bottom."
1426437,new hips,2012-04-25 14:03:00,498,"We used frozen shiners that were left over from previous groups, they were about 4 inches long.......worked great."
1426700,wallydave,2012-04-26 07:03:00,2151,"Goose Bay includes minnows with the boat/cabin package. We end up getting both each day. Last year, a tough one by everyones standards in early June, it seemed the shiners worked best. But it was such a tough week, I'm not sure you can judge by one week. We will be a little later this year, week of Fathers Day, so we will see which work better, we looking at using crawlers and leeches too!"
1426715,back357,2012-04-26 07:40:00,106,"Guys, I'm going to be using crawlers this year for the first time. How long of a piece of crawler do you suggest?"
1426840,Mike Kansas,2012-04-26 13:14:00,1463,I like half a crawler on a jig. Seems to always work and elimantes short strikes.
1426892,Mohleye,2012-04-26 15:02:00,368,"Half a crawler for me too. Unless they are really jumbos, or we're going through so much bait that we might run out. Then a third."
1426921,new hips,2012-04-26 16:27:00,498,"We always use half of crawler, stops the nibblers."
