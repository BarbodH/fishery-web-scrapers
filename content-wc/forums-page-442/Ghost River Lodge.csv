We are staying at Sturgeon River in one of the cabins there. I have read some of the older posts and it seems to be a popular place with the Walleye Central family. Is there any electricity in the cabins, I want to be able to plug in some rechargeable stuff. Second, on their website it says that they have wireless internet service at the lodge, has anybody used it? We are thinking about making daily Youtube videos so that mom and grandparents can be sort of involved in the trip. Any other info would be greatly appreciated......Mark"

He has been to GRL before as well and loves to fish. How old is your son? Yes I love to shop for new fishing stuff even when I don't need any more."
