1425360,camp chef,2012-04-23 17:43:00,915,We usually use a weather rock when we are in Canada. We are there to relax and fish. The only thing you know for sure is that there is going to be weather. Enjoy it.
1425461,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-23 20:10:00,235,"Last year I looked into renting a satellite Internet device for our fly in. I really like having the real time radar view when weather is coming through. It was too expensive. We just have to wing it, look west and you can at leas have a sense of what's coming."
1425485,Hawkfan,2012-04-23 20:54:00,237,"Holy crap! You'll definitely have to go out prepared if you walk out the door at 4am. It's still getting colder at that time of day and the sun won't be seen for hours. At least that's what they tell me...I don't know for sure, I'm not usually up at that time."
1425514,wallydave,2012-04-24 02:48:00,2151,Is this where a George Carlin weatherman rif would go...??
1426001,BennieS,2012-04-24 20:06:00,108,"Slot fish. I don't think you're weird at all. You've been at this for 20 years. Been my wish to do this for my whole life and i'm getting an awful late start at it. If I'm lucky, I may live to do it for 20 years. In the meantime, I'm trying to be prepared and to make the most of every day that I'm there. Finding this website in the beginning of January was a stroke of luck to be sure. I read every discussion and have learned a ton and a lot that doesn't have to do with fishing either in the General Discussion area. I got advice early on to steer away from an Ugly Stik and to get a good graphite rod. I thought to myself, I can't afford that. It then occurred to me that I'd be foolish not to take all the advice that you guys put out there for me and that i couldn't afford not to. I bought two St Croix Triumphs. Not the gratest, not the most expensive, but it should allow me to apply the techniques that I've read here. The winter has flown by thanks to WC. For those who are afraid that I'm not going to relax on my trip, no fears. I do my relaxing at work as I stare at my co-workers, nodding my head up and down to who knows what they are talking about, while trying to recall WC posts about the best way to find fish during a tough bite, so that I can bring that info to mind while in Ontario if I need it. For those who feel I'm getting up too early at 4AM, notice I said I'm walking out the door at 4AM. I usually don't stop my vacation drinking until about 3AM and like to allow myself at least an hour to try and remember how to get dressed. I'll fish till about 7AM, go to bed, sleep till 4PM, get up and start all over again. Kidding of course. I thought I was weird because I wasn't going to Ontario ""just for the fishing"". I feel a lot better after reading that exact advice more than once since I've been on WC. Read something in an old hunting cabin once and repeat it to myself EVERY day, ""enjoy yourself, it's later than you think"". Thanks to all who make this site a success and for the free education about all things fishing. Anyone have advice on how to make the next 38 days go by faster?"
1426021,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-24 20:42:00,725,"Here's something we do to pass the time, we send each other the countdown daily through email. The trick is to make the count down appear in a sentence phonetically, but not as the number. For instance, it is twenty three days until we leave and it may appear in a story like this: There was an aging native American (please, i know it isn't politically correct, but bear with me) who had a young son. One day when he went to town, a cowboy engaged him in conversation and asked the name and age of his his toddler. The Indian replied, ""TRENT, HE THREE."" Sometimes we start this countdown a year before we go.Well, you asked."
1426261,tv4fish,2012-04-25 09:46:00,2694,"JMO here-- the radio station (I think it is AM) out of Dryden is pretty darn accurate with their weather forecasts. All I can say is that if you have to boat a ways to your fishing spots and a storm is forecast, be prepared! We have been caught in some pretty nasty lightning storms. (Now, I have a big enough motor to ""outrun"" them --- I hope )."
1424396,BennieS,2012-04-21 20:03:00,108,I'm going to Ontario first week of June for the first time. Gold Arrow Camp in Perrault Falls. Here's the part where I risk looking like an imbecile. Will I be able to get a radio station where we can get weather for the following day or am i ging to have to have some type of radio with weather channel capability?
1424412,rather-be-fishin,2012-04-21 20:55:00,429,"I go fishing to Lac Seul area just North of Perrault Falls. I am not sure on radio reception in the area, but I do know that our resort posts the weather forecast daily for same day and next day weather, which is very helpful. Of course, if you have Sirius satellite radio that will come in. Good luck and have fun! RBF"
1424415,Blue Lk,2012-04-21 21:13:00,269,"92.7 fm or 103.5 fm,both are local radio stations for Dryden/Vermilion Bay areas."
1424505,WalleyeWally28,2012-04-22 07:25:00,298,Our resort prints the weather report off the internet every day.
1424740,@Lunker,2012-04-22 15:28:00,835,"Check to see if your resort has internet connectivity. I'm sure one of the guys in your group has a laptop they could bring along. That way, as the others explained, if your resort isn't posting the forecast, you can access it on your own."
1424779,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-22 17:30:00,725,"I know this is risky but-a) Have you ever heard Canadian radio? I mean do you really want reception?b) Who gives a rip what the weather report says, be prepared for anything and you are going out anyway, right? I for one say leave the laptop at home and the cell phone in the car. They didn't have any of that junk 20 years ago. But thats just me."
1424871,BennieS,2012-04-22 20:33:00,108,"Yes, I'll be ging out anway, you are correct. I would like to prepare myself for the day however. Shore lunch or sandwiches in waterproof baggies? Can I leave the drift sock in the truck? If it's going to be foggy, i'll bring my Gps otherwise I'll travel with three compasses, just as I do when I hunt. Is it going to be sunny and still? I'll gear up for some perch fishing for part of the day otherwise I'll leave that gear behind. Is the temperature overnite falling form the low sixties to a high for the next day of 41, windy and rain? I don't want to find that out when I step out the door at 4:00am in the morning. I don't like having to go back inside and dress myself for something completely different and unexpected from the three previously beuatiful days. Is it possible the weather will be nothing like the weather report claims? Probably. Doesn't matter really. I'm not in control of the weather and i'll have everything with me in the boat that i'll need for any kind of weather. Sounds as if ""Canada radio"" is pretty bad? It will be interesting to find out as i'm pretty easy to please. In the meantime it sounds as if i have a couple of FM options as well as my resort owner as a resource. Thanks everyone for the help."
1424911,nitroman,2012-04-22 21:56:00,368,I to like to be prepared and I do enjoy listening to the one station we get when we are up there! We bring a digital thermometer up also and I can get weather on my GPS too! I do pack a lot of my stuff in dry bags or ziplocks cause even a nice day can bring a rain shower. Bring a print out of temp coversions because the radio forecast is in C unless you are good at converting in your head.
1424953,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-23 05:15:00,725,"Ah, I see, you make decisions! That's pretty much what i do the other 50 weeks. One thing i like about my Canadian fishing adventures is that there is usually only one decision. ""Do you want to fish over there or over there?""X Wind socks, gps yadda yadda yadda- just not my syle. But I readily admit, I am weird."
1425031,LOW1,2012-04-23 08:11:00,2828,"Here's a link to weather information for the area. Radio weather information tends to be very brief: ""For Dryden a high of 24 with winds gusting to 20 knots and a possible thunderstorm in the afternoon"" usually covers July and August. Much more detailed info can be obtained from the links on the left side of the screen. http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/..._metric_e.htmlCanadian radio is great. The talk programs talk about things that are actually important and the music shows don't play songs about how your boss/wife/girlfiend/husband/dog/truck/prison warden/bass boat did you wrong. Much different that American radio.Check it out at Sirius channel 159."
