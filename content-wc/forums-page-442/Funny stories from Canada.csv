1423344,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-04-19 11:29:00,84,"Hi all, I have 50 days to go so I thought I would try to have some fun. Post your funny stories and we can all get a laugh out of it. This has probably been done in the past but I thought we could do it again. My buddy and I were fishing on Lake of the Woods one morning. We were top water fishing for smallmouth. After having a greasy breakfast and a couple of cups of coffee my buddy had to visit the shore. I am sitting in the back of the boat waiting to get back to fishing. He gets done and starts pushing the boat from the shore. We he goes to jump into the front his feet slip. He has already gave that big final push and the boat is moving backwards pretty good. Well he is hanging off the front of the boat. His belly button is on the tip of the boat. A out thigh down is dragging in the water. He has on jeans and a rain suit. He can't let go and is struggling to pull himself up. Pretty much looks like one of the seals on the Discovery channel trying to get on shore. At this point I am somewhere between laughing my butt off and don't know what to do. I start the boat back toward the shore but he finally pulls himself up on over the front. We sat in the boat and laughed for a good ten minutes. He took off his pants, rain suit and shoes and we fished on. Caught about 60 smallmouths and had a great. Was one of the funniest things I have seen in a boat."
1423397,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-19 13:17:00,725,"My BIL and I were fishing on the last day of a pretty great week. It is the heat of the day and we aren't catching much of anything but throwing lures to kill time. Suddenly I hook into a large pike and finally get him into the boat. As you know, assuming you have caught a 37 incher, it kind of changes your day. After he spun himself into the nylon net I had to spend some time getting him out and then hooked the lure that was still in his mouth onto the knee of my pants (you might guess that this is common for me by my handle). After finally getting the lure off of him, I held him up for a picture but of course I was cross-handed. At this point, I was holding him in front of my face (still cross handed) when he slapped me right in the face four times with his tail fin. Incredibly, he he swam away on my release but we sat in the boat and laughed hard for at least 10 minutes."
1423401,Lovetofish,2012-04-19 13:19:00,458,Scared the snot out of two girls from our group two summers ago. They both just graduated from high school that spring and they were playing cards with my kids in our cabin while some of us adults were visiting in another cabin. It was time for bed and I was walking back and I heard them leaving our cabin. So I slid behind another cabin and when they walked past me I let out a big bear roar. LOL
1423403,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-19 13:20:00,725,"Story #2. Same Brother In Law and I are fishing again on the last day. We are literally on the last cast when he throws his bait and the pole slips out of his hand, lands in the water and slowly sinks. There he stands looking down at the water until the pole disappears. He turns to me, I am chuckling, he says, ""We're done fishing, ain't we?"" We had another ten minute laugh."
1423412,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-19 13:36:00,725,"Story #3. I'll stop after this one, but I bet everyone will have trouble telling just one story. Same BIL, we are with a group of six guys and have just finished lunch at the camp. As we are packing for our afternoon fishing excursion, a pretty yellow float plane lands and comes up to the dock. Same BIL is just about to get into the boat when he realizes he has forgotten his sunglasses. The cabin we were in was furthest from the dock to he is walking fast so as not to keep us waiting. He goes into the cabin and gets his sunglasses and is about to exit when the MNR officer that we now refer to as Barney stops him on the porch and says, ""All right, where did you put them?"" BIL responds, ""Put what? I just came to get my sunglasses."" Barney says, ""I know you are hiding fish in here, where did you hide them?"" He then begins to search through the cabin making BIL wait on the porch. Finding nothing he says to him, ""we're going to search until we find where you stashed your extra fish."" He then goes and consults with his partners. They never did find any stashed fish, probably because we were legal, but they sure thought they had solved a poaching caper. We tell this story often and still find it amusing. Other stories we tell and I can elaborate on some other time: Dunkin' Bob Don and his watch over the deep fryer Don announcing depth and temperature every 10 seconds Tipped Over In Tipover, Fell at the Falls and turned around at Turnaround The trout that looked like a walleye Chief Full O Bull Three of our guys on the ""Tackle that fish use to catch people"" board And many, many more. This will be a great thread."
1423420,wallydave,2012-04-19 13:59:00,2151,"Like Hooks, there are sooo many stories to tell. One year we couldn't get into our walleye lake, so we tried a fly-in lake trout/muskie lake, that advertized some walleye portage lakes. The fishing was not very good, it was too warm and sunny for the lakers, we had a few cloudy days, the bite picked up then. The camp staff was more interested in selling their guides service than putting us on the fish, they seemed to have an attitude, compared to our usual camp. So we trolled and yes we had a few beers in the boat. One day after a rather late night around the fire, my baot/cabin buddy just had to GO! He picked the nearest island, got out of the boat as quick as humanly possible to ""take care of business"" stepping on my rod and breaking the reel. The spot we stopped at was a shore lunch spot!! So when one of us mentions stopping for ""shore lunch"" we always get a good laugh!!"
1423425,wallydave,2012-04-19 14:12:00,2151,"One day a we decided to try one of their ""walleye"" portage lakes. We a three boats of guys to try our luck. I'm in the first boat, we grab our gear and the gas tank, and make the short but steep climb to the portage lake. We plug in our gas and take off to give the others some room. Next thing we know, we hear shouts and our walkie talkies start going off. We called back, but no answer! We turn around and head back, the closer we get the louder the laughter!? The second boat of guys, loaded up the portage boat, and pushed off, the gas wasn't hooked up yet, the boat started to head for the stream leading from the portage lake to the main lake!! The third boat was at the outlet watching this whole episode unfold! They had to put the walkies down, they were just laughing to hard! Next thing we know we are dragging the portage boat up the hill stopping to laugh about the streaks of red paint left by the boat as we dragged it up the hill!"
1423427,wallydave,2012-04-19 14:21:00,2151,"Last day we are waiting for the plane to take us out, its around 8am, cool and foggy. The plane will be late we are told, so my boat cabin buddy decides he's not done fishing, so he starts to pitch a sliver spoon from the dock, next thing we know he is reeling in the biggest laker of the trip. We have our limit, so he's ready to release the fish, when a guy steps up to say, ""what are going to do with that fish?"" ""Let em go"" the reply, ""I have room and need a second fish"" so he startes to make room in his cooler, which means we are standing around, drinking some ice cold beer, ""just to make room, of course!"" Not long after this as we wait and sip ""breakfast"" we watch an eagle flying by with the remains of a lake trout, a bunch of eagles start to chase the lucky eagle. They drive him into the lake, trying to take the trout from the ""lucky"" eagle. Just a few moments to remind us why we value our trips sooo much!"
1424449,Limeyangler,2012-04-22 04:17:00,563,Great story...say hi to Moon for me...PMSL
1424452,Limeyangler,2012-04-22 04:45:00,563,"dunno if this is funny or not....was for me. Was fishing my home lake one day with a local kid i know and was mentoring. I get to a spot i was gonna try but there were around 4 camp boats circling the island, in different directions on a windy day.....i really did not want to encroach on anyone and was not about to try and navigate around everyone going in different directions with the kid in the boat.So......i decide i will try a mid water hump about 300 -400 feet off the south shore of the island that i had on my GPS. I find the waypoint and throw in my marker bouy. As i said it was windy, so as i was getting the kid set up with a minnow etc.....we had drifted quite a way off the marker bouy. By the time we were ready to fish we look back the 100 feet or so to my marker bouy and the boat that was fishing the east point of the island has raced over and started fishing my effing marker bouy!!!!!!I dont know where this guy is from....but around here that is considered very bad etiquette. I was fuming, but had to bite my tongue as i was mentoring that day and the clown in the other boat had his kids with him too. I just slowly fished up to the bouy, pulled it up(the clown was around 5 ' off my bow at one point) and headed to the spot he vacated.It just so happens the point he vacated was stacked with fish, he just had not been fishing it shallow enough. Anyway...clown dude stays on the unmarked spot for all of 5 minutes after i pull my marker bouy and heads back towards us....this time litterally within feet, not so much as a ""good morning"" or anything. We are litterally pulling out a fish a cast...double headers you name it...nothing big...but numbers! The kid whispers to me that 'this guy is a F%$%$# a-hole.....i tried not to laugh but could not help myself. I tell the kid i kinda agree and suggest we really hoot and holler every fish we catch . We did this for a round 20 minutes and i dont think they pulled in a single fish. The guy was getting grumpier and grumpier, and by now his kids are all saying ""dad...why aren't we catching any fish'....""come on dad"" etc...etc...(we can totally hear everything the kids are saying because they are that close to us! maybe its not kind to laugh at this...but the kid in my boat was doing moonwalk celebrations very fish he caught on the casting deck...and the clowns kids giving him heck had us in stitches, serves him right!"
1425074,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-23 09:38:00,235,"One year up at a fly in outpost, the outhouse had worse than usual smell. Believe me, you wanted to be in and out of there as fast as possible. One solution to foul odors is to strike a match, and that's exactly what a fella in our group did. He then decided to dispose of the match right down the hole, apparently not realizing the match was not out. He wiped up and soon joined us for lunch. A few minutes later, someone says ""what's that smoke coming from behind the cabin?"". Yep, the gasses in the turds caught fire. We were able to douse it quickly before any of the structure caught fire (I can assure you, the only thing that smells worse than rotten turds is burnt rotten turds). The situation could have been much worse had we not caught it in time, but we're able to laugh about that now."
1425185,doubleheader,2012-04-23 13:12:00,2652,"My buddy thought this was hilarious, me, not so much. We were fishing Quebec in June, the weather went from cold to hot. The black flies were terrible, at least for me. It's sunny and 85 degrees and I have a long sleeve coat, gloves, and headnet and I'm getting bit- alot. He's up front in a teashirt and shorts not getting bit at all so of course he's jacking me. I'm so hot and have so many black fly bites I'm getting goofy. As we're trolling up the bay I look back to see his lure is fowled on a leaf, and it just hit me as funny that here I am dying of heat getting bit like crazy, and his lure is floating on the surface. So I didn't say anything to him but just started laughing. just to myself at first until I couldn't hold it in anymore. Pretty soon I was laughing so hard i was seeing stars. Finally he realized what happened, and that's when he told me his secret. He takes garlic pills. I just said thanks alot buddy, appreciate the tip even if it's day 4."
1425245,Guest,2012-04-23 15:29:00,0,"My son and I at that time had fished Canada for about ten years. We had tried to get my best friend to come up some time and try it. He always had too many things to do. Either something needed spraying or cows need shots or calves needed watching. Finally, my son just stopped by and told him to get in the truck. We are going on a fishing trip. Thirteen hours later they pulled into camp. He sputtered around a little but eventually settled in to fishing. It was an above normal day temperature wise. Fishing was good, and I pulled onto an island for a shorelunch. While I got the fish ready, my son and Farmer Dave started a fire. FD asked if I thought it would be ok to go for a swim to cool down a little. I thought it would be ok. A few minutes later my son asked me if I told FD it was ok to go swimming. I said yea why. I didn't know he was going to strip down to his birthday suit and go wading into the lake. FD looked like a big bald polar bear with burned brown arms splashing in the lake. My son asked if we should get a picture of this beast. I told him to use FD's camera and sneak it back into his bag without him noticing. I knew when he got home he would just give the camera to his wife to get the infamous fishing trip of a lifetime pictures developed. He commented all the way home at the end of the week about all the great fishing pictures he got. It was a trip of a lifetime. He figured some would be good enough to make into the grain elevator in town so everyone would see what a great time he had. When he got home he did exactly as I figured he would. His wife went to the local one hour developing photo mart in town. She was as excited to see these famous fishing pictures as FD was. Wow, was she surprised when she thumbed through the pictures. I think most everyone on that end of the county heard the line of questioning that night at the supper table. I asked her if she wanted to go along fishing the next time. She said some things about no part of fishing like that and those pictures are going to show up again when FD won't expect it and something about a funeral board. FD had some interesting things to say to me the next time I saw him. That was over ten years ago now, and he might be allowed to go again."
1423743,Hawker,2012-04-20 08:25:00,3967,"Took a group of guys I worked with on their first trip ever to Canada 10 years ago! One of the guys (Scott) is sort of a know-it-all and as we came back to the cabin our first evening the Loons were really calling! Scott stopped on the porch of the cabin and listened intently for a moment and told everyone to ""shush""! We quietly stood around for a bit and Scott (in a quiet voice) says do ya hear that?? Almost in unison we asked ""what"", and as a Loon called again close by Scott says ""THAT, can't you hear the Moose calling it's mate??? I, as well as everyone else about fell down laughing and explaining it wasn't a Moose he was hearing, it was the call of the Loon's! He didn't believe us so he went back over to the Lodge, got Perry (the Lodge owner) outside and posed the same statement/question!! Perry about fell off the Lodge steps laughing and informed Scott he was hearing the Loons, NOT a moose!! When he came back to the cabin, I immediately dubbed Scott's new name as ""Moon"" and it's stuck ever since!It was one of those ""you had to have been there"" moments, and of course ya gotta know the guy, but I still get a good chuckle every time I think about it, and it's certainly the first thing that gets mentioned whenever the group gets together for anything!"
1423783,elway12,2012-04-20 10:07:00,335,Love that story Hawker. Can see some of my buddies from AZ thinking the same thing!
1423815,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-04-20 10:57:00,138,"For years I went on a fly-in trip with a group from work. These guys were steel workers and partied hard. One year it was just our group and two couples in the next cabin in camp. From day one it was obvious that the two ladies next door did NOT approve of us. Forbidding their husband from even have a beer with us.So mid-week our group gets back to camp early and starts on dinner and beer. Well it wasn't long before Joe ""The Big Duker"" (everybody in this group had a nick name) had to take a leak. Well ""Dead eye"" (he was blind in one eye) was taking his time in the only crapper so Joe steps outside and starts to take a leak. Pretty soon we hear Joe talking to someone. ""Well hey, Didn't know you folks were back."" ppppeeeee ""Yes, it is a fine day"" pppeeee ""Fort Wayne, how about you."" pppeeee ""Well thank you ma'am, that's why they call me the Big Duker."" pppeee (Joe had prostrate problems) pppeee ""Couple pike, some nice walleye."" Of course he wasn't talking to anyone, but he had us literally ROFL."
1423835,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-04-20 11:41:00,84,"On a cool morning on Lake of the Woods me and a couple of fellows were smallmouth fishing. It was about 50 or so. T shirt sweatshirt rain suit weather. We round a point and there is a guy buck naked standing on a rock about 25 yards from shore. He waves, stands there for a few seconds, slides down in the water and finishes his swim. Climbs out on the bank gets dressed and walks away. Just the kind of luck I have, couldn't have been a woman."
1423836,Pikeslayer8,2012-04-20 11:42:00,1460,Hilarious!
1423863,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-04-20 13:16:00,138,"Another year the Big Duker brings along his new son-in-law Tom. Well Tom was a banker or something from Chicago. He made a lot of money and he thought he was better than ""us"" lowly steelworkers. First day he informed us that He didn't drink BEER. He only drank 15 year old Scotch. End of the week we are all (The Big Duker, Dead Eye, Pus Belly, Melon Head, Beak, Dirt Farmer, Me and Tom) were at the table playing bid euchre and drinking. It had been a great week of fishing. We were are all feeling good after an incredible pork-chop dinner that Pus Belly had made. I start ribbing Tom about sipping his whiskey asking him if he needed a nipple for it. He shoots back that ""he can drink me under the table any day of the week."" Well as the song goes, ""I'm pretty good at drinking beer"". Plus I'm 6'3"" and 350lbs. He's 5'8"" 140?? Anyways, the kid is matching me drink for drink when Dirt Farmer (He farms part-time, but isn't very good at it) pipes in that Tom's drinking whiskey and I'm just drinking beer. Well CRAP! I'm NOT very good at drinking whiskey. After my second drink my stomach is doing the ubby dubby shakes and the kid is going strong. Well it couldn't be helped, I started cheating. Everytime he wasn't looking, I'd pour my drink out and ask for more of his $40 a bottle scotch. Well fast forward. He's got his head on the table crying about how some fat kid beat him up in 5th grade. Joe announces that the game is over. He is afraid that we are going to kill poor Tom and while he is not particularly fond of the kid, his daughter is. So we all start cleaning up and getting ready for bed when all of a sudden Tom jumps up and screams ""I'm going to get sick"". Everyone is yelling ""get to the bathroom"". A couple of stumbling steps and he just get to the tiny bathroom. He throws open the door at the very last second.... he pukes his dinner all over the Big Duker who is sitting on the john taking a crap.And that is how ""Porkchop"" got his nickname."
1423878,Ranger319,2012-04-20 13:34:00,166,I was laughing so hard I pulled a muscle in my side. Now I can't stop laughing and cringing because of the pain. That's the funniest thing I've heard in quite some time.
1424048,Rich B,2012-04-20 20:40:00,1081,"Walleye_Wrangler, That's one of the funniest ""up north"" stories I've heard in years..... You've got some great friends and no doubt have an outstanding time on your Canadian trips. Thanks for sharing some of the ""highlights"" ! Loved hearing about ""Tom"" and the ""Big Duker"". Rich B"
1424069,LOW1,2012-04-21 04:26:00,2828,"After we have all eaten our breakfast we want to know the story behind P.B.'s christening,"
1424432,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-21 23:00:00,235,"We were on a fly in lake one year and got bored catching walleye. My buddy and I (in our early 20's) decided to follow a creek that flowed out of the lake. It got so small that you couldn't even get a canoe in it, and we decided to hike alongside it to see where it went. It led to another lake, also a lake with a fly in outpost (an ""only cabin on the lake"" outpost). There were two old timers in a boat fishing right where the creek dumped in the lake. They had no idea there were other human beings in the area and all of sudden we appear out of the woods...just the look of surprise on their faces when they saw us was priceless. You had to be there I guess."
1423434,BW,2012-04-19 14:37:00,1816,"One year my late Uncle, our beloved cabinmaster, a laid back but intimidating figure (big guy), was engaging in his yearly ritual of poaching a small (5-6 lb) pike over an open fire wrapped in foil as a pre-dinner appetizer. After one too many gin and tonics, and a non-cooperating fire, things weren't working out and you could see that he, and not the pike, was getting steamed. Of course, we were egging him on and asking ""when is our pike going to be done?"" Without saying a word, he grabbed the pike, foil and all, and hurled it like a discus into the drink, and slowly walked into the cabin. We were all trying not to laugh, like when you were kids and saw your parents do something embarrasing and you knew it was over if you got busted laughing. As soon as he went inside we were busting a gut, and the pike, tomatoes, lemons, and onions were all floating in the bay as the seagulls descended. He finally came out and laughed his a&* off too, and today, it remains one of my best memories of my many Canada trips."
1423474,elway12,2012-04-19 16:00:00,335,I have posted this one a year or 2 ago but it is still pretty funny...When our group got to the camp parking lot and were waiting to be picked up. I thought it would be nice to get some video of the all terrain vehicle they use to take us into the camp. We hear the rumbling of the engine coming down the trail so I get out my video camera and start shooting some great footage AND.....the icon of a tape is blinking in the view finder - I didn't have any tape in the camera or any extra tapes in any of my belongings so NO footage of that or the nice 17 pound laker I reel in during that trip! Of course this story might be more sad than funny...Elway12
