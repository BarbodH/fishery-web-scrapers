2275970,NP4ME,2013-12-15 11:05:00,378,"Jim, We fished Confederation several years ago. It is true, no walleye. The portages were okay for walleye. Nothing to write home about, though. We caught some lake trout and northerns on Confederation, but the fishing was pretty difficult. We might have caught a tough week, but we won't go back. Hope that helps. NP"
