Not sure my wife would be happy there, even though it's fine with me. Anyone stayed in that cottage or know anything about it? I've never fished out of this camp and was looking forward to it. Pooch"

I can guarantee you that the cabin will be VERY clean and comfortable. Cabin #11 is small but I am confident you will enjoy the stay. There is a reason Rod and Lorita don't have many openings , and that is their guests are pleased with the accommodations. The fishing in that part of Lac Seul is very good too. Steve"
