2289098,zeebee,2013-12-20 19:58:00,1144,Mid august to mid Sept. Weather likely to be more stable. Fish are little deeper and predictable. Great sleeping weather. Far fewer fisherman. Better deals on fly-ins.

2289706,wallydave,2013-12-21 07:31:00,2151,"I had been a late May, early June guy NW section of LS. Grew tired of the high traffic. Tried Red Lake this past August. Less traffic steady weather and pretty good fishing. Trying Red Lake again in August out of BBL."
2289794,packpro,2013-12-21 08:09:00,695,"We (15 years) have always booked the starting the second week of June. It really is like opening a Christmas present. You never know what to expect. It just depends on the when the ice out occurs. We have had a week (the whole week) in the mid 90's, and we have had a week where it got no warmer than 46F. The tactics and strategies change based on where the fish are located in there natural cycle. It's always fun and we always catch our fair share of fish.......after all it is Canada! The variety makes each trip unique."
2293322,new hips,2013-12-23 10:37:00,498,"We usually go first or second week in September, one year went 3rd week and it was really to cold for me. Fish are always in the same areas. (lac seul)"
2293657,Aaron-IN,2013-12-23 12:37:00,500,Depends on what species I'm fishing for.
2293746,AllenW,2013-12-23 13:05:00,11482,"Add less people, it's my favorite time, it can be a bit cool then though. Al"
2293794,jambi,2013-12-23 13:17:00,504,I'm right on with Jay here - I've done six trips end August/early Sept and eight trips late May/first week of June. Love these times equally!
2288666,LoDo,2013-12-20 16:25:00,721,"When do you prefer to fish Ontario? Do you prefer the spawning period in late May, early June? What about the summer months late June, July and early Aug? Or is your preferred time to go in late Aug early Sept? Why?"
2288690,Blades-n-Beads,2013-12-20 16:33:00,484,"Lodo, I don't matter when, when in Ontario it's always good. I think the absolute best would be mid-late June . I prefer dark stained water, the bite is good all day long, clear water seems to me the bite is best morning and night, mid day is slow and we wind up going deeper and in hunt mode all afternoon. But it's still fun."
2288850,CI_Guy,2013-12-20 17:54:00,2118,I seem to do the best in late June - early July.
2288858,Bigstorm,2013-12-20 17:54:00,799,I've been there form mid June thru early Sept and cant say the bite was any better at any certain time. I fish the English River (stained water) so we're able to move around a lot to find them based on the water temps. My personal best fish came in late July
2288874,phishfearme,2013-12-20 17:59:00,1242,"for a flyin to a private lake (single cabin) I think the best time is when the weather is the best for people which is early july to later july. warmer and more stable weather makes fishing MUCH more fun and the fish are warmer and more active without lots of pressure. for other places with easier access and higher amounts of pressure, I think getting in early is better for fishing but get ready for some possible snow and possible heat. phish"
2288930,JayM5209,2013-12-20 18:14:00,1050,"1. 3rd Saturday in May to 1st Saturday in June (best time for walleyes and lakers).2. August 25 to September 15, +/-. Weather's nice, the crowds have gone home, the fish are still hungry."
2288938,BreezyPoint,2013-12-20 18:19:00,1581,"I fish anytime from fishing opener to mid October. I seem to catch just as many fish whenever I go, although the muskies average a little larger later in the season. The other interesting fact of my fishing is that I troll shallow running crank baits and catch plenty of walleyes on this shallow presentation throughout the season."
2288946,Duflebag,2013-12-20 18:20:00,218,I like mid to late September. No Bugs and fish seem to be concentrated.
2288954,BreezyPoint,2013-12-20 18:22:00,1581,Bigstorm where do you fish on the English River? This is one of my favorite places.
2289082,port1042,2013-12-20 19:40:00,509,"In 2012 I went for the first time the first week of September. Loved it. 2013 we went the last the last week in May and the first week in September. Planned for 2014 is the last week in May and the first week in September. Many seem to think that mid-summer (late June/early July is nice). My grandson, who is 10 and loves to fish, would be free that time of year. Maybe 2015 I could add a week with him. My point is, there isn't a perfect time, but anytime is almost perfect!"
