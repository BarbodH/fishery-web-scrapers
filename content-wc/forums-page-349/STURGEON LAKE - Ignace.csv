1370375,guidedfishing,2011-12-04 16:50:00,531,"There are camps pretty much along the West side of its 55 mile length. The lake is big and relatively under fished in m opinion. Its a good lake Trout and Pike lake. It can give up walleyes but typically you have to get on the right spot. I would not call it a walleye factor, and sometime you really need to travel to find some dark water. Lake Trout when there on can be awesome, if the walleyes are not on there are plenty of out lakes you can hit. Its big water, but most guys get by pretty good with a 16footer, it can get big and nasty if the wind picks up out there but there are plenty of bays to fish in. For Walleyes early in the spring jackpot lake could be good on the south end. Cobb bay is fairly consistent and the North East arm which can be a haul from just about anywhere can give up some decent walleye. like any Canadian like can be a land mine for rocks just under the surface, and Sturgeon has plenty just need to be careful. I've stayed at Cobb Bay resort and White Sands. I liked them Both, We actually prefer White Sands now because it positions us well for Lake trout which we fish on Sturgeon, and usually hit Out lakes to the north for Walleye. Good Luck GF Good luck"

We never caught one, but were south of the necked down area.I don't remember the name of the camp, but it was owned by a Norwegian couple. Fairly decent camp. Everyone that was in camp were after lake trout except for my wife and I.Search Sturgeon lake on this website and you will find some information as there have been numerous threads over the years about the lake.Good luck.Pooch"
1370397,plumberjoe,2011-12-04 18:14:00,54,"I have fished Sturgeon now for seven years and love it. Big pike, numbers of trout and lots of walleye if you get in the right dark water. We stay at a small outpost camp and fish mostly the northeast arm boat rides of 45 minutes one way are not uncommen so I wouldn't recomend it for a first timer. I have not stayed at Cobb Bay or White Sands but have heard good things about both. I know White Sands does do some guiding in the Northeast arm."
1370429,Catman59,2011-12-04 20:07:00,345,"This year could be a challenge as the whole lake is down to levels that not many have ever seen. The rocks will be in new spots !! Like all have said , very good Laker and Northern lake. Walleyes are there , you just have to have an idea where to go. Stained water is best but I have caught them in the clear main lake in several places on the north end . The time of year can make a difference too . http://www.whitesandscamp.ca/ is a great place to stay , simple , clean and reasonable. The Turners are great people and will do their best to get you to the fish. I would say a minimum size boat would be 16ft . but have a friend who we meet up there that runs all over in a 14 . My 18 seems small in the wind some days !!! PM me if you want any more info."
1370520,Bill Krejca,2011-12-05 10:11:00,6107,"Clear water is good for lake trout, finding walleyes in the spring was tough for our group. There are many rocks that were not on my map. As earlier stated, it is probably under-fished. Bill Krejca"
1386867,Further North,2012-01-27 20:25:00,2008,"Late to the party, sorry...We stayed at Harris Bay Resort down near the south end...the smallest pike we caught out there was 25"", and we quit counting them at 20 by noon on the first day...No monsters, but lots of action an very decent fish.We didn't fish Lakers, but several others did, with good results.For great walleye fishing, we just put the boat in a few other lakes nearby (less than 15 mintes to the closest one) there was one where the smallest fish we caught was about 18"".We're already booked for this summer."
1387155,Larry S,2012-01-28 16:04:00,665,"Did a 3 day trip at Sac Bay lodge,the south end in 2006. Went into Jackpot lake and caught many walleyes.Got pike and trout around the lodge. The lake is huge and has much potential"
1387230,Further North,2012-01-28 20:55:00,2008,Jackpot is on our short list for this year...any problem with getting a Lund Pro-V 1800 in there?
1387242,Further North,2012-01-28 21:58:00,2008,"...by the way, regarding the rocks: Sturgeon Lake is on the Navionics Platinum chip for Canada.The lake is in HD, so it'll help considerably avoiding rocks."
