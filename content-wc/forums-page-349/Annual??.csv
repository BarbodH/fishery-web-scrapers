2188753,clegg,2013-10-28 09:30:00,38,"We're relatively new to doing yearly fishing trips. We've tried two places up north (Quebec) in the past three years, and both have been less than impressive. We're trying a fly-in spot in the spring, so whenever we do find a spot we like, we will reserve a year in advance. If the fishing is good, we'll stick to that place as well. Main reason for me to reserve early is because I don't want life to get in the way from interfering with my fishing week. once it's reserved it's set in stone, and I'll have peace of mind."
2189329,camp chef,2013-10-28 13:41:00,915,"We too,go back to some of our favorites and if we like a lake or camp we usually fish it a few years in a row.When the lake starts to ""look smaller"" it is time to move on."
2189433,BreezyPoint,2013-10-28 14:33:00,1581,I try to go back to places where I have developed a good relationship with the owners and the fishing is good. Knowing the lake well helps the fishing to get better every year.I have made 30+ trips to Lake of the Woods at Red Wing Lodge and know the area really well. Last year I went back to Goose Bay Camp after a long hiatus (not since 1987). I started going there in 1965 and still knew the water well. This will be one of my two for sure annual trips into the foreseeable future (red Wing being the other).Every year I try to work in a third trip and this is my experimental trip. Places I go to include the Winnipeg River and the English River out of Ear Falls. So after all these years I have developed a pretty good variety with some stability and have gotten to know all of these waters really well.
2283098,labsrus,2013-12-18 10:19:00,557,We do an annual first week of August trip with a group of family members and friends. We go to the same lake each year. Pretty good fishing and we always do pretty good on the fish. We have been doing an every other year fly in trip. It is hard to get a group to commit each year so we went with eveyr other year. We have been using the same outfitter and went to a few different lakes that he has cabins on. One has been visited three times by the group. Next trip will probably be with the same outfitter but to a new lake I like the idea of exploring new water.
2283178,Mara5,2013-12-18 10:35:00,209,"Our group (20+) goes same place yearly. It has everything we want or desire. Great wally & smally. Nice modern cabins with all conveniences. Private dock just for our cabins(3). Don't have to lug gear back and forth, never had a problem. Can drive right up to cabins to unload. We're happy!"
2287450,tv4fish,2013-12-20 08:12:00,2694,"My group of 3 has been doing this since 1985. We started out at Red Pine Resort at Sioux Lookout - through the years we DID try a couple of different places - we have been back at Red Pine for at least the last 15 years in a row. As far as fishing ""different"" water, we hit Lac Seul and there is a lot of water to explore - we always try to find a new spot every year, but it sure is nice to be able to go back to the ""hot spots"" that we have found over the years. Every year when we check out, we pay the deposit for the next year and reserve our time slot. The Red Pine has everything that we want/need and the price is very reasonable."
2185434,bigwalleye1,2013-10-25 18:43:00,2632,"Another thread got me thinking. How many of you kind of play the field, reserve when you can, this camp or that, and how many of you, like me, keep rolling the deposit money over to next year, so before I leave Canada I already have my reservation set for the next season? Maybe another part of the question is how many of you are loyal to one camp vs ""spreading it around""? Not trying to make a judgement call on anyone, just trying to see if there ar emore folks that stay at the same place, same week, year after year, or if more folks bounce around."
2185450,NARDA 1,2013-10-25 19:19:00,636,"2013 was my 25th year at Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake, Our deposit is rolled over every year. We have changed weeks depending on who else is going but has been late August early September for about 20 years. Have met a lot of great people at the lodge and in the Vermillion Bay area along with several other lodge owners. It's my home up north. I'm not going anywhere, sorry Marcel, you are stuck with me and The NARDA Guys!!!!!!"
2185506,Whopper,2013-10-25 20:36:00,340,"I have been lucky enough to to both and made some real good friends along the way. I am part of a group the spends the walleye opener on Little Vermillion and have rotated to different places for a second trip to somewhere in Ontario during the season the past few years. About five years ago I didn't make any trips north of the border and was miserable about it. To me there nothing better than being up north, a good feed of fresh fish spent with some fishing buddies. Hopefully I can continue to make these because they are a priority to me. I also spend as many weekends as I can fishing the western basin of Lake Erie, I'm pretty lucky to have a wife that understands lol."
2185514,wallydave,2013-10-25 21:01:00,2151,"Yea when we started going North, we always rolled the deposit over for the following year! These days no way! Its just to hard to put a group together that can commit to a yearly trip!"
2185746,Bigstorm,2013-10-26 06:48:00,799,"We always go to the same place every year. On the last day of each trip, we put down the reservation for the following year. A few of us do a 2nd trip somewhere each year and we have been trying a few different places for that trip"
2185842,camp chef,2013-10-26 07:50:00,915,Too much good people and good water to go to the same place every ear. We like to explore.
2185850,SinOrSwim,2013-10-26 07:57:00,1528,"We have changed camps and outfitters over the years but it's typically after something negative. Whether that be fishing or service or cost. As long as we are happy, we pretty much stay in the same place.However, 20 years of going up, I don't think we have ever booked prior to leaving. We go late August to mid-September. So, our dates aren't usually full. But, we can't book because we don't know everybodies schedules. In the Spring, we start discussing dates to find a date that will work for everyone. I'd rather change camps if they were full than change people in our group. Our schedules just don't allow us to book the same exact week every year."
2186434,mudpusher,2013-10-26 20:18:00,248,"20+ years, two camps. First one closed. Three generations of family and friends. Deposit sent in January."
2186826,elkman99,2013-10-27 07:37:00,180,"A friend of mine always tells me to stop chasing rainbows and to go to the same lake every year. And, there is something to be said about getting to know a lake, which will make you more successful fishing. However, like camp chef said, we love to explore new water. The beauty of the Canadian shield is awesome, and I like to see different areas of it. For us, it isn't really about catching more muskies. As long as we are on trophy water with the potential for bigguns, we are happy. We have a group of lakes that is on our list every year that we choose from and go from there. We still try to visit our original lake, but mainly that is because we have some dear friends who have a cabin on it. There is something exciting about fishing new water."
2188137,GWC,2013-10-28 04:34:00,1021,"We started going to Canada in 2008. One trip in June each year. We made September trips two of those years. We sayed at the same camp , Poplar Point, each trip. Good people & great equipment. Getting to know the lake & owners is an important factor for us. This is the first year since 2008 when we have not gone. Gotta admit, I missed both the people & the fishing. We have lots of good fishing near our home but Gull Rock is a day & night difference for walleye & Pike. Don't care much for the drive up there. Senic but just too many hours. We took my boat two of those years. Something about fishing out of your own boat but it's really too far for me to feel comfortable towing a boat. Don't know about 2014 yet and yes we left our deposit standing for the next year."
