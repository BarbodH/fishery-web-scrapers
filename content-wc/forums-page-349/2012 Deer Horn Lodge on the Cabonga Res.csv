1457986,eatsleepfish,2012-07-05 10:52:00,52,Anyone heading up to Deer Horn Lodge this year? Website doesn't appear to have been updated so kind of hard to tell how the fishing has been. I am leaving tomorrow!
1458152,Guest,2012-07-05 17:00:00,0,"Our group fished deerhorn for many years. Lots of good trips. Steve Hamel no longer runs the lodge and his computer skills in updating the website are lost. I hope the lake has been kept to it's optimal level. The fishing can be great if they don't mess with that. Good luck and please post the results of your trip when you return. We would like to go back as the walleye, pike and lake trout fishing was the best we have had within a twelve hour drive from eastern PA."

I have fished the northern part of the Cabonga reservoir for many years, but this will be my first visit to their lodge. I've seen it last fall while hunting. It looks quite interesting, and for sure, the fishing quality should be good. The ower told me this week Lake trout was very active. Can't wait!"

Had a great time again. We did fairly well with the walleyes. The pike were pretty slow again for us. We did get one 8 lb pike. Also lost something that appeared to be pretty big at entrance to Mike's bay. It took line like I have never seen before. Except for the first day, we enjoyed excellent walleye shore lunches. The first day it was a bit chilly so we ate our first walleye meal back at the camp. Since the low waters a couple years ago, I record the water level about every week. It is nice to see how the water level has recovered. I also miss the fishing reports. The camp seemed to be pretty well filled; that was good to see. My son Mike and I are scheduled back the first week of September."

1462365,emanonmac,2012-07-16 20:07:00,62,"Was up at the lodge June 30 to July 7 and stayed at Cabin #1. Two boats and 4 of us fishing. First Sunday was cloudy with off and on drizzle. We got 15 eyes that day between the two boats. Monday and Tuesday were too windy to go to the big water for Lakers so we spent the days jigging and using bottom bouncers for eyes. Sunny both days and we only got 4 more in 2 days. Wednesday we were on the big water and after moving out over the deep water and away from the 80' - 120' depths we got 5 lakers. Finished out the week fishing for walleye and wound up with 22 total, 2 of which we had for dinner one night. Should have gone to the big water one more time. Slow fishing on those hot sunny days for eyes. Tried several times down around the dam (Barrier) which started releasing water on Wednesday. Nothing there although we did read a lot of big schools but they had lockjaw no matter what we presented to them. Water level was normal and surface water temp was about 70, a little warmer down wind in the coves. Didn't try any night fishing but we stayed out till dusk several times."

We left Harleysville, PA very early on Friday morning, August 31 and arrived that evening around 6 PM. We then fished for 5 days and returned home on Thursday, September 6. The trip from Harleysville, PA is about 630 miles.The weather was just beautiful all 5 days. There was very little wind so it was easy to travel in the lodge boat with a 15 HP Yamaha, almost no choppy water. We never wore our rain gear.Day 1, Saturday:We headed to Wagoose Lake. On the way we fished a couple of spots and picked up 4 walleyes. We now have walleye for our first shore lunch. In Wagoose we picked up a couple more walleyes. It was now around noon so we went south into Andou to find a place to eat. This is the first time we have ever been to Lake Andou. We then ate our first shore lunch. The menu as always was walleye, potatoes, string beans, canned fruit and bread/jam. We then fished for walleye in Andou for a while with no success and headed back to camp.At camp we cleaned fish, rested a bit and about 6PM went to Three Mile Bay, which is very close to camp. We caught several more nice walleyes. For the day we caught around 20 walleyes. The maximum we can have in our possession is 12. So, we had 12 walleyes with most of them cleaned for transportation (skins on).Day2, Sunday:Since we basically had our limit of walleye we went to the Burns Bay area to fish for pike. We fished in Burns Bay and Mike's Bay. We kept 4 pike (10, 6, 3 and 2 lb). We had a great time: lost a couple of good pike, caught several small pike and 1 walleye. We both used a red Toronto Wobbler most of the time. We ate our shore lunch in Mike's bay.In the evening we went back to the same spot in Three Mile Bay where we had success the previous evening. Didn't catch a walleye??Day3, Monday:We went North of camp to the far end of Seven Mile Bay. We actually fished in a small lake on the West side, which contains an Indian camp. We caught quite a few small Pike, one Walleye and one pike that we kept. We ate our shore lunch in this small lake and shortly headed back to camp.In the evening we went back to Three Mile Bay. This time we cast for pike and caught a few small ones. We tried for walleye just before dark and picked up 2 walleyes, one 19 inch. Day4, Tuesday:We went back to the Burn's Bay area for Pike. We kept one pike in Burns, one pike in Mike's and one pike in St. Patrick's Bay. We did catch several small pike in St. Patrick's. We also ate our shore lunch in St. Patrick's. We also picked up another 19 inch walleye on a Red Toronto Wobbler fishing for pike.We fished Three Mile Bay for a short time in the evening for walleye with no success. We are now calling this spot Fool's Point.Day5, Wednesday:We now had our limits of walleye and one walleye ready for our shore lunch. We had 9 pike, which is 3 short of having our 2 limits. We went back to Burns Bay and Mike's Bay. There was solid fog in the morning and we had some problems with our GPS. It was about 10:30 AM before we started fishing. We did catch 3 pike: 2.5, 4.5 and 5.5 lb. After having our shore lunch, we then fished for walleye in Burn's bay for a while with no success. We then headed back to camp to clean the 3 pike and prepare to travel home early Thursday morning.Water Level:The Cabonga water level is updated weekly (Tuesday) on a web site. While we were there the water level was about 6.5 ft. below full. This is quite low. When the level is about 6 ft. below full some lakes are not accessible. This presents a problem for larger boats that like to travel to what is known as the big waters. We don't travel/fish the big waters; so the low water is not a big issue with us. There are still many many places to fish. Also, we do not fish for lake trout; much of the lake trout fishing is done in the big waters.Baits:We primarily fished walleye using a jig with a night crawler. The jig is modified with a trailer hook attached with monofilament line and trailing the jig hook by about 1.5 inches. The Hot-N-Tot was used a bit; caught a couple.We primarily fished pike using a 3-inch Red Toronto Wobbler, casting shoreline and shallow waters. Occasionally, a walleye will hit the Wobbler.Closing:Son Mike and I had a great fishing trip. The possession limit is 6 walleyes and 6 pike. We brought home our limits, 12 walleyes and 12 pike. Most of the walleyes were 17 to 19 inches. Mike took lots of still photos and some video's."
1489433,Rich B,2012-09-23 21:17:00,1081,Thanks for the detailed report on your CABONGA FALL 2012 trip....bet your son had a great time. Let's see some photos if you can attach them. Rich
2292018,ohiojmj,2013-12-22 17:27:00,1262,"Thanks for the pics. Since one gentleman has a Biscotasing hat, have any luck on that lake?"
2292058,B8zeBall,2013-12-22 17:54:00,3,"The gentleman with the Bisco Hat is my father Jim. They call him ""Bisco Jim"". I am his son Mike. We went to Rays Camp in Biscotasing Canada several times and that was many years ago. Once we found Deer Horn about 10 years ago (I am guessing here on the years) we have just continued with Deer Horn. Dad loves fishing at Deer Horn. Mike"
2291970,B8zeBall,2013-12-22 16:50:00,3,Thought I would try and post a couple of photos from our Sept 2013 trip however what I learned was I need to reduce the resolution of my photos to meet the website requirements. .... we will be going again twice in 2014. Mike (B8zeBall)
