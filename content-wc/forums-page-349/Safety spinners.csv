For those unfamiliar, they attach to the head of a jig and then are tied to ""V"" wire which has a smallish spinner on the end. Deadly when cast or slow trolled with baited plastic on the jig end. Anyone else use em?"

I like to use them when casting to the weeds, they seem to help in keeping most of the weeds off the bait. I also feel the spinner adds to the visibility/attraction of the presentation as it slips through the weeds. Bill"
