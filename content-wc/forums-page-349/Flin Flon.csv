We did manage to pick up some Walleye in one of the small rivers for shore lunch. If Walleye is what you are after, it's hard to beat Lac Seul. If you something a bit more remote for Walleye fishing, try Lake St Joseph. Both are excellent Walleye lakes and it will be much cheaper than heading up to northern Manitoba."

2224914,Moondog,2013-11-18 09:44:00,362,Let me clarify..... I have heard that Flin Flon has great walleye fishing. Can anyone comment on this?
2225122,reconssd,2013-11-18 11:40:00,147,I fished Flin Flon area over 20 years ago. I remember the walleye fishing to be good. Nothing spectacular. Now I must clarify that we were going to Flin Flon and the surrounding area for trophy pike. Pike fishing was OK. The lake trout fishing was incredible.

2228682,johnboat,2013-11-20 08:52:00,2014,We have a father and two sons in our yearly group that used to go to Flin Flon regularly. They decide to try a year with us on Gull Rock. That was 4 years ago and the have never gone back. They prefer Gull Rock. John B.O.A.T.
2228802,mrwalleye5,2013-11-20 10:06:00,1922,"From 1978-1994 travelled up there first week of June. Then we moved to Saskatchewan for a few years and only was able to go once in 1997. Then onto Alberta. That was it. Now back in Manitoba but due to job obligations have not been up. Waiting to retire and that will be the first place we hit. Anywhere between The Pa and Flin Flon. Take your pick of what lake you want to fish each day for a month. Athapapasko, Reed, Cormrant, Clearwater, Chocolate, Goose, The Cranberry's (3) Max, etc etc etc."

2234850,Moondog,2013-11-23 08:06:00,362,"Tackleman, It ain't so, it ain't so!!!!! I was just wonnering. It is still Gull Rock for us. Moondog"
