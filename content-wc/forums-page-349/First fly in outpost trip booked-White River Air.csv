2272610,vteye,2013-12-13 11:58:00,812,x2 phish - Plane flying away on a drop off is a wonderful few minutes to reflect knowing you are out there. I've been dropped off 100+ milesa couple of times in Canada and AK from the nearest village or faciliates fantastic memories.
2273922,gordy28,2013-12-14 08:36:00,437,"Great feedback. Thanks this is a good checklist. We are definitely trying to narrow down the tackle - on other trips we've had 25 lbs of gear and only used crawler harnesses and bouncers, a few crank baits and buck tails and spoons for pike. Will bring jigs as well but generally we've never had as much luck w jigs as we have with harnesses and a 2 oz bouncer"
