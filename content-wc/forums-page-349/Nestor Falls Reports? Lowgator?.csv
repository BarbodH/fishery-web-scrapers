2270354,lakerbreaker,2013-12-12 08:44:00,253,Just checking to see if there are any ice/snow reports for the area? We haven't been able to get where we wanted the last couple years due to ice or snow conditions. Looks like this year is shaping up nicely for trout opener. Lowgator sent you a pm...

2294978,Skywagon,2013-12-24 06:17:00,1106,"The whole area has gotten lots of snow this month not long after ice-up (insulation). There is lots of slush on the lakes, even though temps have been below normal. As far as I know, the only ice shacks that are out, are along the ice road at Dryden (the ice road is specially groomed to promote freezing). Trout season opens Jan 1, I am tentative as what conditions will be like on the deep lakes. Not a great report for you at this time."
2295954,lakerbreaker,2013-12-24 13:08:00,253,"Thanks for the update...It looked like a lot of the trout water didn't freeze until after most of the early snows up there..We are going to try and run up into Atikwa through Rowan the weekend after trout opener. Have never made it in there but we are itching to try it. Breakdowns or bad ice/snow conditions have kept us out the last few years, hopefully the stars align and we can get it done this year..."
2296730,Skywagon,2013-12-25 06:52:00,1106,"True that the trout lakes may have missed the early snows, but we did have a big dump that they may not have missed. Some lakes freeze earlier than others, (including trout lakes) because of depth, moving water, springs, or a combination. Some just always seem to have more slush than others. I fished the east side of Atikwa once in March of this year (2013). As in a lot of the trout lakes last season, there was plenty of slush then. Fishing was not stellar that day, but that only means we did not catch many fish on that given day. There are scads of trout lakes in that area, if you cannot get to that one, there are plenty of other options. I love to fish trout through the ice. A great lot of fun if you are setup for it."
2296802,lakerbreaker,2013-12-25 07:39:00,253,"Yes, I agree, trout are the best ice fishing to be had-we are all set up for it as we have been making the trip to the area for about 15 years now- we don't pull tubs or houses and everything fits on our snowmobiles to keep the slush a mostly non issue for us- which route did you use into Atikwa?"
2296882,Skywagon,2013-12-25 08:57:00,1106,"I am self contained also, mostly just carry the flasher, gas auger and poles, don't like pulling anything. Have a portable, but never use it, as I can choose my days to be out. I spent over 2 hours digging out of slush last winter one time (with help). That time the water was to the top of my boots, had to scoop a path all the way to the shore to get out, the snow conditions were just wrong. I drive a newer Bearcat with the wide track and skis, that did not help. Some times it can just get bad, always good to have a long rope and plenty of help along.We came in from the East (not an official route), down logging roads and through some slashes. Had a couple of Tundra's out front breaking trail in the deep snow. There are plenty of good trout lakes that are easier to get in, for us doing that sort of thing is for the adventure as much as the fishing."
2298650,lakerbreaker,2013-12-26 13:23:00,253,"That's all we carry as well, sometimes something to cook for lunch-We have only been up there once during March and the fishing was a lot tougher than our usually January opener trip. We like the adventure part of it as well, that's why we would like to make it into Atikwa...The resort we stay has no knowledge of a route into it though so it's kind of difficult to get it done. We don't want to waste a whole day looking for a way in either...A member from here has offered help on getting into Atikwa so hopefully I can get ahold of him before we leave...We usually run up into Lake of the Woods for a day as well and would abandon that trip for a run into better trout water."
