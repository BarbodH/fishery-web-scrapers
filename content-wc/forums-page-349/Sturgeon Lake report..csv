1453033,1xcleox,2012-06-23 10:12:00,24,My two teenage boys and I are heading to sturgeon lake (north of ignace) next Saturday. This is our first trip to sturgeon. Was hoping someone had a recent report. Also hoping someone can give us some tips that will get us going. Staying on Cobb Bay. Any info is appreciated. Thanks in advance! How have the bugs been and how is the water level?
1453225,guidedfishing,2012-06-23 22:45:00,531,"Its been a few years since I fished Cobb bay, but as far as walleye's on Sturgeon its probably one of the best options for accessibility. Jamie will get you started no problem, I would start back in mosquito bay the 1st point going in and then the shore line on the north side all the way up and down. You can bottom bounce until you hit them and then stop to work it over with jigs. I always had good luck just at dusk with walley divers. You have a better chance in my opinion on lake trout if you head out to the main lake several good area's to the south. I've caught smaller numbers of lakers in 2nd bay, some in 1st bay, 3rd bay is just to shallow before you get out to the main lake. good luck GF"
1453247,Further North,2012-06-24 06:02:00,2008,"We are on Sturgeon right now, but down the lake at Harris Bay. We heard that the Cobb Bay Walleyes have moved out for the most part, but will check in the next couple days anyway.What kind of boat will you be fishing out of, and how far are you willing to travel?You can run up and down Sturgeon a long ways to find different conditions, and there are a ton of other lakes nearby to fish.I'll try to keep this updated as the week goes on......took a pike on a fly rod last night, just to break the ice...."
1453280,1xcleox,2012-06-24 07:25:00,24,"Thanks for the info guys. I have a 1775 Lund with a 150 so I can travel to spots. What are you guys fishing mostly for? I got the lake master chip, will have to fire it up and take a look at the spots you're talking about. I would appreciate updates. Anything to speed up the learning curve. I'm assuming most of the out lakes you would be using a camp boat for. That's fine too. I do have a 10 horse that I will throw in. Always nice to fish out of your own boat plus we have three people so a small boat can get tight. If you work on sturgeon will you find walleyes or are you wasting your time? I've got good electronics and would imagine they should be on the reefs. Do folks mostly fish lakers and jacks on sturgeon. First trip to a new spot is a learning experience. Again thanks for any info, it is really appreciated."
1453285,1xcleox,2012-06-24 07:37:00,24,"So many questions.... What do guys do for locators when using a camp boat? I have a portable vexilar I use for ice fishing? Not sure how good that would work without mounting the transducer? With lake trout they use heavy blade baits. Drop down and real up. Can you get by with 1/2 ounce ir 3/4 ounce baits. 1 oz are tough to find. I'm not rigged up with any down diggers, Just a kicker motor. Any other ways, I am a total lake trout novice."
1453518,guidedfishing,2012-06-24 18:53:00,531,"There are several outlakes you can get your boat into, you make have to put in a few miles. I fish further north on Sturgeon now for my late summer / early fall trip. I fish Sturgeon primarily for Lake Trout, walleye's can be had but you have to be willing to travel I've found its just easier to pull the boat to one of a half dozen lakes I can land my boat at which is very similiar to yours. One thing about Sturgeon is it can be a pain for rock reefs and other underwater hazards. I have the map chip for Sturgeon and for general navigation its great. Let me repeat it does not mark all the rocks and reefs that will remove your lower unit out there. When going into a new area tread carefully. I would try and get Jamie or one of the boys to guide you out to the main lake for lakers one day just to get a quick lay of the land Water levels had risen nicely when I left on Friday, no problem there. You wont have much trouble with bugs around camp. If walleyes are tough in the bays Jamie will get you on fish on the outlakes, or set you up with a camp boat if needed. good luck GF"
1453680,Further North,2012-06-25 07:13:00,2008,"We did well on Pike yesterday on Sturgeon - good enough that we didn't go after walleyes at all. If I have my druthers, we'll go after smallies and walleyes today over on Elva-Young-Whiterock.Weather was beautiful, mid 60s all day with some wind, Mostly sunny.Had a big pike in the mid 30s on a couple times in successive casts - I could see it take the spoon but could just not get the hook set right...had a a follow from a Pike big enough to eat a small dog whole...that one kept me up late last night. I could see her in the clear water, just staring at my lure...looked like a submarine....Water is high. I was able to get my Lund Pro-V into both Jackpot and Mountain Island lakes, though I'd hesitate to recommend doing either to anyone else - there are plenty of fish in the main lake and neither side trip produced enough fish to make it worth the risk and the hassle.The high water is hiding some normally visable hazards - be very, very careful in areas you don't know, and don't rely on the map chip to show you everything - it simply doesn't do it. We found one rock the size of a small office building in an area marked 20', and another reef outside the entrance to Jackpot that'd not only take out your lower unit, but sink your boat if you went in with any kind of speed."
1453808,1xcleox,2012-06-25 11:18:00,24,"Further North,The pics just got me more fired up. Nice regarding the northerns. We will be doing our fair share of fishing for northerns too. You fishing the bays and weeds for northerns or deeper water/windy points?I had a big northern do that to me a couple years ago on Rainy Lake. Was casting a Husky Jerk. The real, pause, real action. I had stopped realling and looked down and a monster was 6"" being the lure just looking at it. I about fell overboard. He looked at it for a bit and then just swam off. We had caught some nice fish that day but that one was in a class all by himself.I'm happy I can get my boat on the outlakes. Wasn't sure that was an option. It looks like your from Chippewa Falls - I'm from Cameron. Which way did you take going up?I appreciate the updates - just wish I didn't have to muddle through 4 more day of work!"

I hate bugs. Must be alergic, I get bit by a horsefly on my foot and it swells up like a watermelon. Were you staying with Jamie?"
2293010,DMella,2013-12-23 08:56:00,32,Hello - I am bringing back this older thread to learn My father spent two weeks (spring and fall) at Cobb Bay last year and loved it - especially the owners. So much so that he convinced my wife and I (along with the 4 kids) to book our fishing week with them July 19-26. We have an 18 ft aluminum boat and a 150hp and the navionics map chip which my dad used last year on the lake. We have camped for a number of years on Lake of the Woods so this is a new adventure for us. We are used to traveling quite a ways to fish and mainly explore new areas and love to catch pike first and walleye second. We have a little experience catching trout on LOW and do have some of the vertical jigging gear and technique down.Just hoping to learn from you anything you are willing to share as I dig out from our first big snow of the season in Plymouth WI. Dreaming about Canada fishing and adventure!Happy Holidays All
2293994,Bill Krejca,2013-12-23 15:01:00,6107,"Some years ago, we did pretty good for trout on Sturgeon using meat and still fishing. You might want to give it a go if you have time. Bill"
1454115,Further North,2012-06-25 21:46:00,2008,"We went Duluth - International Falls - Dryden - Ignace.Up 61 to Pigeon River is a prettier drive by a long shot...but your chances to pass are extremely limited so if you get stuck behind someone out for a drive you're screwed, and the stretch of 11/17 between Thunder Bay and Ignace is interminable......add in the flood damage, and it made the choice easy."
1454124,Guest,2012-06-25 22:21:00,0,"Futher north, I will be staying at harris bay lodge the week after next. Could you tell me what the channel from the resorts bay to the main lake is like? Is it clean or is there rocks to look out for? Thanls"
1454240,Further North,2012-06-26 08:18:00,2008,"There are some rocks at the bay end of the channel that you need to look out for...you'll see the end of a log sticking out of the water...be careful and go slow - in places like that, I always make the first pass on my trolling motor to see what's going on and where I can get through without risking the big motor."
1455571,Further North,2012-06-28 21:05:00,2008,"BTW, PM me if you want some spots for pike. There's some big 'uns in the main lake...or Claus will have all the spots we found them - I know at least one of them is new to him."
1459005,1xcleox,2012-07-08 07:42:00,24,"Wow how fast can a week go by. We got home yesterday from a week in Canada, was really fun. The fishing was great. Stayed at Cobb Bay Lodge. They do a great job, hospitatily is second to none. Jamie, Sheri, Jim and the crew are great. Caught walleyes and lake trout on Sturgeon. We were first time lake trout fisherman. It was a blast.We fished Sturgeon and a bunch of the outlakes for walleyes. The fish were running larger on Sturgeon. The outlakes provided us with hyper fast action! You can see in the video we had 87 walleyes in the boat that afternoon. Nothing huge, largest was 18"". (I fished for the most time so it was hit or miss if I was going to film the bigger fish) We ended that afternoon with 90 walleyes in a little over 4 hours of fishing. I won't catch 90 walleyes in Wisconsin over the next 3 years.Great trip - I put together this Youtube. http://youtu.be/X81sNzhQ2Sg"
1459110,Catman59,2012-07-08 10:54:00,345,Nice report and video. I am packing for Sturgeon today ........... leaving Tuesday night for 10 days worth.
1459132,1xcleox,2012-07-08 12:03:00,24,Lucky! Have fun.
1459450,Further North,2012-07-09 09:18:00,2008,Cool...I'll check out the video when I get home tonight.
1461539,Further North,2012-07-14 19:38:00,2008,Finally watched the video - very cool.Thanks for posting it!
1469349,guidedfishing,2012-08-01 20:45:00,531,"Head up to Sturgeon tomorrow afternoon, 2nd trip up this summer we'll see how the gang is doing and hit some out lakes as well. As always looking forward to some fresh walleye and trout a little beer and some homemade wine. I'll report when I return. Good luck GF"
1454041,guidedfishing,2012-06-25 19:30:00,531,"1xcleox Jamie and Sheri are the owners of Cobb bay resort. Jamie's a nice guy, its been several years since I moved up the lake no complaints on his camp just wanted to be closer to a lot of the out lakes we fish in the fall. I'm not that far from you, just take 53 North, thru Superior and get on 61 north going up the north shore, take the hwy 130 short cut about 25+ miles after you cross the border and come thru Stanley and out on 11/17 just east of Kakabaka falls, and on to Ignace, it is actually the fastest route despite 61 sometimes being a pain. Did the I-falls things before, Pigeon River is much better, nice views, and faster. Good luck GF"
