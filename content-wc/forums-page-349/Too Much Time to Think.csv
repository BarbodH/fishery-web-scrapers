2291378,btmbncr,2013-12-22 08:10:00,492,"I have rod and reel setups for different techniques,ieline counter reels for trolling cranbaits on superbraid,line counters set up for lead core,bait casting set up for bottom bouncers with a reel with a flippin' switch and a light spinning rod for jigging.The leadcore setup would make it hard to pitch jigs with.Bill"
2288482,Downrigger,2013-12-20 14:43:00,60,"Just wondering why we pay high dollars for just the correct rod (length, action, etc.) and reel for each kind of fish - walleye, northern, musky, lake trout, but when I see those fishing hard water, I see a three foot rod with a small open face reel bringing in 20 lb. northern, heavy lake trout and walleye all using the same outfit. As suggested maybe too much time on my hands till opener. Full disclosure - I have never fished Hard water, but have spent a lot on equipment."
2288890,phishfearme,2013-12-20 18:01:00,1242,bottom line is that the fish do not care!! but other fishermen care so many spend lots on rods/reels etc that impress others. phish
2288914,BreezyPoint,2013-12-20 18:12:00,1581,"Quite frankly, the only specialty rods I buy are my musky rods, and that is only because I want heavier tackle so as not to over stress the fish. All my other rods are used for every species I fish for. Besides my musky rod, I have a bait caster and spinning rod and I use both for walleyes. They are both fairly light rods and can catch anything, including muskies. Unless I am fishing for musky, I only take those two rods. I use the bait caster for trolling crank baits and the spinning rod for everything else. My motto is 'keep it simple' and the fish don't seem to care.I catch a lot of muskies trolling tiny crank baits for walleyes...not that I want to, but that is what happens on Lake of the Woods."
2289034,zeebee,2013-12-20 19:20:00,1144,"I discovered years ago while I was on fly-in fishing trips, restricted by weight/volume, that 3 rods was all I needed. One for jigging, one for trolling cranks and one for downrigging. They serve cross purposes and Ive never felt lacking. I could get by with two but would spend too much time rerigging."
2289066,port1042,2013-12-20 19:31:00,509,"Don't be asking questions like that. The economy is just coming back and your going to question the need for specialized equipment? Good lord, let's not create the need for another government stimulus when we can do it ourselves!"

2290394,h8go4s,2013-12-21 14:27:00,1673,"There's no casting in ice fishing, so less need for long rods. And no room for them in the porty."
2290514,oleJoe,2013-12-21 15:50:00,114,I have found over a lot of years that the specialty rods and reels and those super baits usually catch what they are designed to catch. That is us and we have to figure out how to catch the fish. But it is a long winter
2291138,ricorth07,2013-12-22 06:15:00,1143,"So true, about only catching us for sure.... how many guys have we read made a comment about being thankful for the classified so they could downsize collections... I know early on I seem to have bought one of everything for walleye fishing, sometimes two.now I just focus on what style of fishing I.e. jigging, cranks, trolling.. and stock up specifically..Sent from my HTC-PG762 using Tapatalk 2"
