2279586,Crusher23,2013-12-16 19:53:00,611,"I should say thanks for the intelligent responses so far. Why do people with no useful information feel the need to post? I am qualified to carry a handgun and I usually prefer to do just that. I obviously will not take one on this trip. I'm not quite sure what point Vbay gord is trying to make... I also was simply asking for additional responses, not to diminish the quality or veracity of anything others had already posted. Thank you BreezyPoint for your initial response, I am just looking for additional info. Steve"
2279746,v-bay gord,2013-12-16 21:16:00,3168,"Crusher...sorry, my response was somewhat tongue in cheek...but you did initially state that ""it stinks you can't bring your 45"" (was that a ""useful"" comment?) . Maybe not an intelligent response based on really the question you asked, I know your intention was not to incite a gun debate, and I apologize in advance for my knee jerk reaction....but WTF, it's a fishing trip.....no firearms required! You know you can't bring it, and I know you're not........good fishing on the island this summer."
2291618,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2013-12-22 11:35:00,629,"If you are towing a personal boat, there is a nice public ramp @ the end of the road on ""Hanson Bay"". It is known as the ""Government Dock"" & is located just beyond the 2 Marinas @ the end of Hwy 621.Parking @ the ""Gov. Dock"" is free, but there is no security. I have used the ""Gov. Dock"" ramp for over 14 yrs. multiple times during the ""Open Water"" months of the year & have never had any incidents with the vehicle or trailer. You can park & launch @ the 2 Marinas for a fee/week. Not sure where your staying, but most of the ""Island Resorts"" can suggest or tell you where their guests should park. Enjoy your time out of Morson, as you will be in ""God's Country""!!!Set the Hook, CRJohn"
2203601,Crusher23,2013-11-05 08:26:00,611,"We have booked a cabin on an island on Lake of the Woods for two weeks next summer. The logical place to cross is Baudette. I spent the last weekend trying to navigate the Canada website for information. Maybe I was doing something wrong but it was not an easy process. I did learn a few things though but I have more questions. The cabin we are renting is reached by launching out of Morson, Ontario. So... 1 - Between Baudette and Morson, where is the best place to get supplies? (All groceries and refreshments.)Being out for 2 weeks changes things a bit with quantities required. I understand how much ""refreshments"" we are allowed to bring in duty free. 2 - If I wanted to bring in an extra case of beer, what is the duty for that? a bottle of wine? - again - extra above what is permitted? 3 - My boat holds a lot of gas (60 gallons) If the tank is full when I cross the border, will I pay a duty on it? I haven't crossed into Canada since 1993 so I'm sure many things have changed. We all have passports and none of us have any convictions so we should be good on that part anyway. Stinks that I can't bring my 45 but oh well. Any other tips or pointers would be appreciated. I'm just trying to get ahead of the curve on any issues. Thanks Steve (Crusher23)"
2203737,BreezyPoint,2013-11-05 09:17:00,1581,"I fish out of Morson every year. Right now, the best place to buy supplies is in Baudette. There is no significant grocery store once you cross the border (there is a small grocery store in Rainy River, but much more expensive).Don't know the duty on extra beer.You will not pay duty on gas in your tanks (boat or car).Make sure you bring a passport - required to renter the US.If anyone in your group has had a DUI, do some research before you leave to make sure Canada will admit them.Hope this helps."
2203753,jimirjr,2013-11-05 09:25:00,1149,Crusher... PM sent..
2205409,Obabikon,2013-11-06 05:56:00,2370,"1. They're actually opening a new store in Morson. However, most of your supplies will be cheaper if you purchase them south of the border. 2. There's an LCBO store directly across the border on your right. If you'd like to buy Canadian beer. Otherwise, it'll run about $10 per case (above one). 3. You won't pay duty on gas."
2206113,SinOrSwim,2013-11-06 10:56:00,1528,"Duty on the beer is approx 10 per case as someone said. I'd recommend getting all your groceries before you leave. Easier to pack and make sure you aren't forgetting something. If you are traveling a long distance, you can get the perishable stuff on your way up. Just make sure you have room and something to put the supplies in. You don't want bread or eggs getting crushed etc. meats you can freeze and use as ice in your coolers with other refrig items like lettuce, milk etc. In addition, you just never know if a grocery store will carry everything you want. Especially once you cross the border."
2277185,Crusher23,2013-12-15 20:09:00,611,TTT.... still looking for input. Thanks for the rsponses so far.
2277257,v-bay gord,2013-12-15 20:35:00,3168,Can't bring the 45? How are you going to defend yourself on that island in Lake of the Woods?
2277353,BreezyPoint,2013-12-15 21:20:00,1581,What additional input are you looking for...I thought all of your questions were answered?
2277690,Bill Krejca,2013-12-16 07:21:00,6107,"The large grocery store across from the Baudette walleye statue has about everything in the way of groceries, and the prices are not too bad. As mentioned, bring along an empty cooler, or what ever, to pack eggs, etc. That said, I purchase most of the food at home, and freeze most everything that can be frozen, pretty much eliminating having to bring ice. Keep in mind that frozen stuff does not have to still be frozen stiff when you get to your destination, it just has to be not spoiled. Most of the dry or canned food is put into containers like coolers or tubs such as kitty litter containers (good for chips, etc.). Crossing at Baudette normally is a fast process, little if any line, folks are fairly friendly, almost a nonevent, if you are same. Bill"
