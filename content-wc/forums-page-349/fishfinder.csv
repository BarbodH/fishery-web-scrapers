2291338,Skywagon,2013-12-22 07:50:00,1106,"I converted a Lowrance HD5 to be portable and use the large battery from my ice fishing flasher. With this unit you have to be frugal to make it last a day (I keep a spare battery). Just a thought for any that might convert a unit from your boat, the larger color/GPS units do suck juice and will require charging, but are quite nice."
2291578,46Harley,2013-12-22 10:46:00,149,Check with your outfitter; if their boats are electric start you can alligator clip to the starting battery.
2295378,JMKC,2013-12-24 09:20:00,238,"We have used a Lowrance Mark 5 portable (8 D batteries) with great success, no problems. Like said before the batteries will last a week. Suction cup transducer and the unit sits in a zippered bag. Saw it on sale at GPScity.com for $169.95 with free shipping, that's a great price, usually about $200. JJ"
2295722,Larry S,2013-12-24 10:44:00,665,"Hi, John, Merry Christmas. Have used a Hummingbird Piranha for 5 yrs. very easy to use, uses 8 AA batteries. I always take an extra set, have seldom needed to replace on a one week trip Where are you going in 2014? I'm taking my sister on her first fly-in, not sure where yet, but will know in a couple of weeks"
2296234,jaximus,2013-12-24 17:40:00,117,"i have a lowrance x4. turn off the fish locate option, turn off the back light, turn off the sounds. all i run it for is depth and temp. i take it on a canoe trip into quetico park where its all portages and you have to carry everything by hand. weight/size matter. brought it for 2 years. i dont find it all that useful for how much hassle it is. the lowrance x4 with 8 aa batteries and all the extra stuff turned off runs around 10 days of 6 hr/day usage per set of batteries."
2288314,Guest,2013-12-20 13:29:00,0,"Over the years my group has become locked into the use of fishfinders. In fact, it's hard to imagine walleye fishing without one. My dilemma is what to use on a fly-in where weight is a factor and electricity is not available. What sort of units are accurate and portable and battery friendly that can be taken on a week-long fly-n?"
2288474,Wallbanger1957,2013-12-20 14:41:00,5,"First, any fishfinder can be made portable. Attach the proper female connector to the power (red) and white for a 3x5 12 volt battery which has the two male post . Second buy a portable transom mount for your transducer and last , clamp or (my favorite) screw the unit to the seat. Batteries last me about 3 days , so two can make a week if you don't use them all day like i do. If I remember correctly the mount is $35 and $25 for batteries or Buy a inverter generator 800w $100-$900 (honda) weight 25-30 lbs"
2288794,grizzley,2013-12-20 17:25:00,2518,"Fishing Buddy portable fishfinder. Don't know anything about them, but may suit your needs.It looks like they run on AA batteries."
2288842,phishfearme,2013-12-20 17:52:00,1242,we've been using hummingbird piranha portables - plural because we bring a backup and have been VERY glad we did on a number of trips. uses AA batteries and will last over a week. you can also get solar battery chargers - a nice option for rechargeable batteries. phish
2289282,zeebee,2013-12-20 21:25:00,1144,"You are right about depending on depth finders for fishing. In fact, I take two with me just so I have a backup. Both run on 8 D batteries and last well over a week on a fresh set of quality batteries. I dont care if it ID's fish as long as I get depth readings. Stay away from bells and whistles; the simpler the better when it comes to battery drain. There are many good inexpensive units out there. I have been well served by Eagle and Lowrance brand.A hand held GPS is nice on the larger lakes too but a compass will suffice."
2289498,acplumber,2013-12-21 03:39:00,80,"I have a eagle portable , uses a suction cup for the transducer and runs on 8 d batteries. It's awesome for marking the structure. 1 set of batteries lasts the whole week, and I run it all day long."
2289938,Guest,2013-12-21 09:07:00,0,"Thanks for the suggestions, still have plenty of time to shop."
2290114,houndog,2013-12-21 10:39:00,365,I take two eagles just to be sure one works and have adjustable aluminum brackets that work on most any boat. I've found that a small 12 volt rechargeable sealed battery like those used in Vexilars will provide power for a week of hard fishing. Always take a nylon cord so that you can tie the transducer to the boat preventing a prop mess if the fastener (suction cup primarily) lets loose! houndog
2290370,h8go4s,2013-12-21 14:24:00,1673,"+1No need to buy a new locator or transducer. You can easily mount the ducer vertically on a 1x4 board maybe 24"" long and c-clamp it to the transom. Make a plywood box for your locator and battery and screw or clamp it to the bench seat. Most modern LCD locators draw very little current, so a 9AH 12V battery such as those used for ice fishing locators will probably last a week easily. You usually can turn the locator off once you get to your spot, as fly-in fishing doesn't require a lot of finesse or skill. If not, the fly-ins I've been on lately all have solar power to the cabins, so take a couple of jumper wires with alligator clips and pirate some juice off the cabin batteries to recharge your locator battery. As for weight, sacrifice it elsewhere. You're going there to fish. No beer, no soda, no mix, just hard liquor."
2290546,oleJoe,2013-12-21 16:04:00,114,"We have taken in the humming bird piranha also with the suction cups. They run on 8 AA batteries and usually last the week . We always take in spare batteries though. Be sure to tie off the suction cup AND the unit also. I lost the first one when the cup pulled off and came untied then pulled everything in. It has only taken one time for me to tie both off now. They are pretty cheap now, around $80. or better yet borrow one from a buddy. LOL Have a good trip"
