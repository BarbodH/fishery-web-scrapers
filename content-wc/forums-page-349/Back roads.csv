2298098,Skywagon,2013-12-26 09:51:00,1106,"I have two GPS's set up with the Backroads maps. One unit is probably 4-5 years old, the other one was new as of this time last year (wife's Christmas present). I don't know if there have been any updates on the Ontario Backroads map since last year. You should know going in, that some of the roads/trails shown on the map may not be passable, meaning so grown up a 4-wheeler can't get through, maybe culverts/bridges have been removed, or the trail may be washed out, I have seen all of that, a lot. The canoe routes are the same story, most have not been maintained in our area, don't know about elsewhere. With that said, it is a very good tool for our purposes."
