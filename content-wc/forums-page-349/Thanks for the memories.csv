Looking forward to 2014 and hitting the Canada trail again. Canada and it's fishing are truly a gift from God. My family and friends that join me in Canada have to be some of the luckiest people in the world to enjoy such a great gift in mother natures bounty. God Bless all of the WC gang and may you all have a joyus and Merry Christmas. Mike Kansas"

Admittedly, the 27""+ walleye are awfully special. Still, with all the B.S. flying around camp and the view so different from my Iowa, I seem to remember what was said or what I saw just as much as the fishing. Merry Christmas and a fishy New Year."
2280833,Mike Kansas,2013-12-17 11:38:00,1463,Your right tlars the fishing is secondary. It's just a beautiful setting to enjoy friends and relax in a place that only builds freidship and great memories.
