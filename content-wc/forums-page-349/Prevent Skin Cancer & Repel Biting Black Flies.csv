Also, that metal bar you can buy from Cabela's to remove fish oder from your hands, would that work to remove sunscreen smell well enough? Thanks in advance on replies. Duran"

2056858,mswope13,2013-08-25 14:53:00,73,"We had one day this year of the black flies and I'm a believer of Coppertone SPF 50! This stuff worked it's magic and the black flies were no where to be found once this was applied. At one point, they came in fast, furious and HUNGRY. We must of had 100 flies in no time. We drove over to our other boat, grabbed the Coppertone and that was that. I couldn't believe it. I was a bit worried about the lotion getting on my presentation and affecting the walleye bite, but it didn't. Everyone should have a bottle, the results are incredible."

1956258,v-bay gord,2013-07-16 21:19:00,3168,The ankle biters have been bad the last week or so. Seeing this thread made me search for some Coppertone to give it a try. All I had was some Coppertone 30. Test results from this afternoon were positive. Had some flies land on my feet (in sandals) but did not bite. Will pick up the 50 for further testing. Thanks!
1956377,Tylumps,2013-07-17 04:20:00,73,I will go out and buy some and give it a try thanks. Funny story about this though. I brought Skin So Soft lotion to camp one time to see how it works on black flies since it can work on mosquitoes. Well don't try it. Left the bottle on the window sill of the cabin and woke up to see the entire bottle covered in black flies. It will attract every black fly in Canada so don't use.
1959049,Full Moon,2013-07-17 19:27:00,9,Does Coppertone Sport have an repelling benefit with mosquitoes?
1961641,reconssd,2013-07-18 15:35:00,147,Got back 2 weeks ago and this stuff works like a dream. We occasionally had flies in the boat. No flies were on either one of us and no bites. We didn't have issues with mosquito's either. Not sure if this was because of the Coppertone or some other factor.
1961745,Gregking,2013-07-18 16:26:00,2658,"good to know, heading north soon. I am going to run out and pick some up now so I don't forget."
1963825,Bakefish,2013-07-19 10:55:00,1077,"Was up in Canada mid June, although the black flies were around, they weren't real pesky. The last day I pulled my boat out of the water and began to put things away while up in the parking lot. Big mistake. The black flies were all over me. Then I remembered this thread and told my buddy to get me a tube of Coppertone. All black flies immediately disappeared when I put the lotion on. I'm not talking about disappearing from my body, I'm talking about completely disappearing from sight. I won't go up north without it ever again."
1963969,Gregking,2013-07-19 12:04:00,2658,I got mine last night. I'm ready to go
2003338,LLewellin,2013-08-03 16:47:00,1790,"Was out to Devils Lake Sat-Wednesday 7-27-13----7-31-13. Black flies were biting my ankles and lower legs. Put on the Coopertone SPF30 lotion and Wa La---- No more biting. Thanks for the great tip!!! PS: Caught numerous 14""+ eyes with the biggest being 17""+. Not the greatest but not bad. Can't wait to go again"
2004601,Bad Santa,2013-08-04 10:29:00,100,"Used the spray. My wife put it on the 1st time out, I didn't, as a control. I had it on within an hour. worked fine for us for the trip. Thanks for the info."
2013050,Hewhocookstomuch,2013-08-07 12:05:00,66,"you are right about sunscreen turning off the fish. I read some where to use latex gloves. Should have heard the hahas. My fishing pardner stop laughing, when I landed five fish in a row to his none. He became a believer. Lucky for him and the rest of the group I had about hundred pairs of disposable gloves. Being from the south I did not know that I thought was my ankles were getting sunburn, were being eating by black flies. Started wearing cotton socks what a relief. Good post."
1463084,Rivratz,2012-07-18 11:50:00,105,"Just want to keep the thread up front so as many people can see it as possible. We know those dang things can bite thru concrete. It's about time we can fight back with a safe and effective product. Would like to hear back from those who have returned that used it. Hey FC, luckily you realized that before you leave up north. Well worth the return trip. I bet you probably had to purchase something else that you forgot. Happy fishing to all."
1463136,fishincrazy,2012-07-18 13:31:00,1282,Yes in fact at our local Dollar General they had the Coppertone Sport 50 block with 30% more for only $8 it was $3 cheaper then Kmart so the Kmart stuff went back in trade for new socks!I will be reporting back soon as to how this works for me.I hope all of this running around means rain for my trip I love fishing in the rain!FC
1463142,NYBowHunter,2012-07-18 13:45:00,35,"If this really works this is great! I too like to fish barefoot with merril boat shoes on when it's really warm and those Canadien flies just love the ankle area. Darn, I have to wait a whole year to try it out though!"
1463211,Rich B,2012-07-18 16:54:00,1081,"Am heading north next week with my wife, so after reading these posts went out and purchased a tube....let's hope it works as advertised Rich B"
1464389,J.Iverson,2012-07-21 08:56:00,64,"We stumbled on this discovery last year on a trip to Lac Seul too, and used it on our trip again last week. We spray our ankles with the dark tanning oils with the coconut scent and have found it to repel the dark flies, coppertone and banna boat seemed to work for us. As soon as you step in the water you have to reapply, so I always have 2 squirt bottles in the glove box of the boat."
1464736,fishincrazy,2012-07-22 13:02:00,1282,So the spray on kind works too?I am looking forward to trying this next week.It will be nice to wear comfortable foot wear as opposed to the work boots I usually wear.Question which spray was the best in your opinion?FC
1839369,Rivratz,2013-06-05 09:25:00,105,Bringing the post back to the forefront as a reminder to those who hate the biting black fly bass-terds. Safely eliminate those nasty biting flies while fighting skin cancer. It really works! Don't leave home without it!!!!
1952058,Bad Santa,2013-07-15 18:27:00,100,Anyone use this this year? Lotion/spray? Leaving Friday......thanks
1952954,rdbalmer,2013-07-16 04:08:00,279,I used the aerosol coppertone sport spf 50 while up at Lac Seul the end of June and can honestly say I never got bit in the feet or ankles the entire week. I would definitely recommend trying it. Just watch out while applying it so you don't get it on the screen of your graph. Don't ask how I know this. Rob
1954666,fishincrazy,2013-07-16 13:09:00,1282,I used the lotion last year and had great luck with it.My brother didn't use it and got bit up.I believe!FC
1461466,Rivratz,2012-07-14 14:07:00,105,"I just returned home from the Great White North. I had made an amazing discovery regarding warding off those nasty biting Black Flies. Because it got so warm, the flies came out with a voracious appetite. When it's sunny and hot, I normally don't wear shoes or socks in the boat while fishing, Too hot! So my feet and ankles are exposed to those nasty biting Black Flies. I had 2 kinds of sunscreen, Banana Boat and Coppertone. I normally apply sunscreen before going out in the boat so I can thoroughly wash my hands as not to contaminate any bait and fishing equipment. That stuff will turn off any hot bite, every time. The BB sunscreen is a good product and does what it's supposed to do. I had to reapply sunscreen during the day out in the boat. I had Coppertone Sport sunscreen in the boat and used that. Yes, I had soap in the boat to wash with. To my amazement, the Black Flies would not come near my feet and ankles where I had applied the Coppertone sunscreen. Ok, this was just an anomaly right. Wrong! Day after day the same results. The biting Black Flies actually left the boat entirely. Wow! I was blown away. Usually the flies would hang around the boat just too annoy. With that Coppertoone smell in the air, the flies would just vanish. Just incredible. I applied the sunscreen generously like you would apply a moisturizer to your skin. I used the Cppertone Sport lotion SPF 50, not that aerosol sunscreen. One application lasted all day long. If your going on any fishing trip flies are a major annoyance and nuisance in the summer. Especially those fierce Canadian Black Flies. Fight back with Coppertone sunscreen lotion. It really works. So if your leaving tomorrow, run out and get Coppertone sunscreen lotion as a skin cancer prevention, and ward off those nasty biting Black Flies. And, come home with that golden Coppertone tan."
1461509,fishinnut 3446,2012-07-14 16:58:00,638,"I wish you could have posted this 2 weeks ago!Those SOB's this ate us alive,really didn't matter what we tried!At one point I had on sweatshirt and sweatpants and the only thing they were biting were my toes,they went right between the holes in my Crocs and bite my little piggy toes!!!!!!!!!!!I shave my head and put anywhere between 50-70spf on and I think 1 day my head was like a DOG GONE magnet! So thank you for the tip i'm sure I will try this next year."
1461565,mswope13,2012-07-14 21:59:00,73,"Great post Rivratz. We're heading up in 12 days, 5 hours and 2 minutes, but who's counting."
1461596,HeHooksHimself,2012-07-15 04:52:00,725,Good advice Riv and I hope it really works. By the time we go up for our 2nd trip this year in mid September I hope those biatches will be done for the year. But I was wondering....do you have stock in Coppertone?
1461758,Rivratz,2012-07-15 13:10:00,105,"Nope, no stock in COPPERTONE. Just passing on amazing findings regarding the discovery that COPPERTONE sunscreen LOTION repels biting Black Flies. Remember it has to be COPPERTONE LOTION. Since I don't like the aerosol sprays, the finding was with the LOTION. I would like to hear back from groups going up if they used it, and, if it worked for them also. Because it's a sunscreen, it's a lot safer to use than DEET, which may cause cancer, while sunscreens help to prevent skin cancer. The most important thing is, wash your hands thoroughly after using any sunscreens, bug sprays, etc., so you do not contaminate your bait and tackle. The lotions are residual, and will contaminate anything you touch regarding bait and tackle. The residual effect could last as long as your trip. Carry a no scent soap in the boat always. After I wash and rinse my hands in the boat overboard, I like to do a final rinse in the live well water. Don't put soapy hands in the live well water either. The live well water has a fishy smell that leaves your hands smelling more like the lake. Even the fragrance in soap will contaminate bait. COPPERTONE has a unique smell to it that reminds me of pretty girls in skimpy bikini's, at the beach. A nice thought while your out there daydreaming while fishing. Probably daydreaming that you were applying that lotion on a few of those gals. ""Nothing wrong with that thought"". Anyway, the flies just hate that smell, and, if they did land on a treated area, they buzzed off the second they landed, because they hated the taste. The smell of the COPPERTONE in the air, actually rid the boat of the flies all day. Wave after wave of flies would come in the boat, and try to do there business. Wave after wave left the boat totally discouraged in minutes after they arrived. The Banana Boat lotion had zero effect on the flies. I wonder what COPPERTONE'S response will be when I e-mail my findings to them. Also, I did not try the lotion to see if it would repel skeeters. When the skeeters came out, that was alway's my que to come in."
1461776,fishincrazy,2012-07-15 14:16:00,1282,We leave on the 26th I'm going to Wally World tonight an picking up some Coppertone!I have been using the spray on so as not to get it n my hands and I usually wear work boots in the boat so those !@#!$$@#!!!! don't bite me.It would be awesome to be bare foot cept for the occasional hook. OH BTW what no sent soap did you use.I need to get some of that too.Thanks for the tip!FC
1461882,MorganMan,2012-07-15 18:34:00,341,"Ha, great report! We don't til September either, but I will squirt some on my boating partner if I don't need sunscreen!"
1461904,fishincrazy,2012-07-15 19:24:00,1282,!#!$%$^!&^&$%#$%!!! I bought the wrong one. DOH!!!Now i got to go back to KMART and swap it out nuts! FC
1462290,Andyeye,2012-07-16 17:29:00,179,I found out the same thing this past week in Wisconsin. They ate me alive one morning on Middle Mckenzie and I used the sun screen and found out they do not like that stuff. I'm a firm believer now. It just plain works!!
