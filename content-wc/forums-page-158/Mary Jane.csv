6200208,Rock Lobstar1,2018-05-25 21:53:00,134,Not legal yet but still readily available pretty much anywhere.
6200298,LoDo,2018-05-26 09:10:00,721,"Quiet bay, throwing for northern and your boat mate breaks out a doobie. Id guess most folks won't say no."
6200472,fishingfever,2018-05-27 03:55:00,85,How about a boat being operated by someone under the influence? As strict as the alcohol laws are in Canada I don't imagine the OPP are very friendly towards somebody they see using pot while operating a boat.
6200550,LoDo,2018-05-27 07:33:00,721,"Completely agree. Whats worse is when you mix the two. This trip for many is a week away from the family, kids, hustle and bustle of every day life. For those that haven't experienced MJ be smart about it, especially the edibles."
6200786,Sheebally,2018-05-28 02:26:00,1,"We hear about the different uses of marijuana all the time these days. I have a live-in partner for almost 2 years now. He is a tattoo artist and he uses marijuana on a daily basis. From it being used for medicinal purposes to merely getting you stoned, its uses are pretty varied, generally depending on how you are consuming cannabis and what bud you're consuming. While its medical value can pretty much be proven, there is one proposed use that can't really be measured by any test or experiment, well at least not beyond reasonable doubt. This is of course marijuana being used as a creative stimulant. I came across this article https://www.worldwide-marijuana-seed...ost-creativity that using marijuana give him more creativity and passion for his work. I am very happy that i met John and we live together. We are perfectly happy and i am pregnant for 2 months now."

6206696,martinbns,2018-06-09 16:04:00,1520,"I think MJ is much ado about nothing. I was a regular user when I was younger, I have to adult kids who are regular users. Wouldn't be a reason to me to not be in a relationship, congrats on the pregnancy."
6188585,LoDo,2018-05-12 15:05:00,721,"Is mary jane being sold across the border these days? I thought I read something about each province will decide as to whether sales will be open to the free market or government will control the production, distribution and sales. I believe I read Ontario gov will control the sales in gov shops. Do sales start in June, July? You'd think a shop just across the border in FF would be ideal location. Another off highway 1 going east and highway 1 going west. Just remember, anyone on the roads driving extra slow most likely found a pot shop. Curious what affect, if any, mary jane going to have on fishing camps. Border crossing coming back to US in FF and Int Falls could be interesting too."
6188625,Obabikon,2018-05-12 15:23:00,2370,"It isn't going to start until July 1st, and that will likely be pushed back."
6188633,Obabikon,2018-05-12 15:24:00,2370,https://globalnews.ca/news/4030429/r...-delay-august/ Did a quick search. I missed the announcement that it was indeed pushed back.
6188641,123chadder,2018-05-12 15:31:00,429,"you can buy cannabis online from a number of sites online,most require a doctors note,but some do not.the walk in dispensaries all require either acmpr paperwork or a doctors note."
6189001,martinbns,2018-05-12 18:56:00,1520,"It's pretty much legal now, the online shops aren't even asking for Prescriptions anymore. In typical Ontario fashion, it's being sold in government stores only. No idea where they will be located. I suspect it will have a minimal impact on fish camps, the typical customer isn't exactly the pothead type."
6189145,muskyman73,2018-05-12 20:12:00,401,Jared.... I make really good brownies......
6189385,Paul H,2018-05-13 06:27:00,1232,"I have not read how Ontario is planning to implement, but I have been following some Nova Scotia publications as I am planning a trip next year. They will use what we commonly call ""Beer Stores"" I think it's probably similar to how On does beer sales."
6190041,kzoofisher,2018-05-13 15:22:00,5144,This sounds juuuust a little naive to me. Lots of users out there who don't fit the pothead stereotype.
6190265,terrapin,2018-05-13 17:19:00,353,"A bunch of my walleye buddies are 420 friendly. I personally no longer partake. If they want to roast a bowl, I don't mind. Please be aware of the wind and make it go away from me. That **** makes me lazy.... a trait I already have dialed in."
6190329,Obabikon,2018-05-13 17:59:00,2370,you guys stay on the south end of the island... what I don't know can't hurt.
