6206154,SteveZ,2018-06-08 10:27:00,271,So I have a weird request as our trip this year has been changed up. We typically stay at JR's Portage Bay Camp located on Camping Lake. We spend most of our time fishing the English River below Lac Suel. JR's is closed due to the passing of the owner. We will be staying at Evergreen Resort on the north end of Lac Suel. We will be trailering the boats over to the English River each morning. I am wondering about fishing Lac Suel in the evenings rather than going back on the river. Is the north end pretty good fishing or do you need to run a ways to find fish? I have heard about some shallow rocks that can be an issue. Anyone have any info on those? I would appreciate any help. Thanks.

Yes, there are rock hazards but the resort owner will be able to mark hazards & give you spots to fish. Even hiring a guide for the first day would be very beneficial too showing you safe travel routes, fishing spots & techniques. I can't see trailering a boat to the river with the options & good fishing available on Lac Seul. Good Luck!!! RBF"

With them out and on the trailer, we just thought going to familiar water 4 miles away would make more sense than trying to learn a new spot. We may find that Lac Suel is the place to be. I would like to check it out and see how different it is than the river fishing."

Most often times we go in mid to later part of August - just before the kids go back to school. This year, we will fish from June 23 to 29. Furthermore, we have been going to Evergreen Lodge for the past 5 years or so. GREAT camp on all aspects. Now the camp has recently been sold but the previous owner has told me the new owners are local residents that know this type of business quite well. You'll be in great hands here on your first trip. We are looking forward to meeting them ourselves. The owners and even other fisherman will be happy to point you to spots producing fish and what areas to avoid for reefs. I understand your wanting to fish where you have experience, but you do owe it to yourself to try staying on Lac Seul as it is a great fishery. This lodge in particular has so many repeat customers - people that would go to other lakes or resorts if it did not meet their expectations. Best of luck!"
