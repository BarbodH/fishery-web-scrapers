6197588,Twodogs,2018-05-21 07:28:00,115,Have crossed at the Grand Portage/Pigeon River entrance into Canada numerous times and there's no guarantee you won't have an hour wait there sometimes. Depends of course on traffic and how many lanes they will open up...always a cr@p shoot. And Saturday going through Duluth with Grandma's Marathon is a hassle to go around the route as clearis mentioned.
6197904,coldtuna,2018-05-21 16:46:00,25,"Thanks for all the information and input. I'll plan to go through International Falls. We'll probably get there around 1 pm., so hopefully no problem with much waiting. I will also get the paperwork in order for my son so we don't have an issue. Thanks again."
6205824,Sportfisher,2018-06-07 09:51:00,47,"I go through I Falls at about that same date every year, headed to Minnitaki. We usually arrive at about noon. Usually have about an 30 mins to an hour wait at the border. Many trucks with boats."
6205862,wallydave,2018-06-07 11:40:00,2151,One way to beat the line at I Falls Saturday is to cross the border Friday if possible. If you plan ahead you can find a nice place to stay in FF. Good luck!
6206346,valley366,2018-06-08 19:20:00,193,I can tell you that at 430 today the line was backed up over a mile east of the corner at International Falls. Been a long time since have driven that far East.We chose to go eat and waste an hour. Got in line at 5:30 and line was not quite as long. Took about 30 minutes to get to the corner to turn north. Then just under 30 minutes from there. They were opening another lane as I went through customs so wait times after that may have improved.We left MSP a little earlier then usual. Think will go back to normal time that puts us at the border at around 7pm.
6197384,coldtuna,2018-05-20 18:09:00,25,"New to this forum. Thanks for any suggestions. I posted questions on threads initiated by others, and wanted to follow up with my own. Going to cross the border on June 16th with my 12 year old son heading to Sioux Lookout to meet a plane early on June 17. Driving from Madison, WI area. We have never been to Sioux Lookout, but fished Eagle Lake last year. We have been through International Falls last year, and had relatively little delay. We expect to be at International falls around noon on June 16, and I see mixed information about delay times during a Saturday in June. I could go up through Thunder Bay and avoid International Falls. It is about 75 miles greater driving distance, but probably worth the extra drive it if there is a reasonable chance of an hour+ delay at International Falls. Thanks for any information on what type of delays we might hit at IF."
6197392,clearis,2018-05-20 18:23:00,47,"I think you'd still save time chancing it at the Falls. I'm in Duluth and on the 16th is Grandmas Marathon. The expressway up Hwy 61 will be open, but you will need to navigate round the road closures for the marathon to get to the expressway. That will add about 20 minutes. Total additional time to the TB route will be at least an hour and a half more. I don't think the delay at the Falls will exceed that and you'll save gas.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6197402,MN_Moose,2018-05-20 19:08:00,964,If you cross Saturday afternoon you won't have much of a line.
6197414,Guest,2018-05-20 19:50:00,0,When are the longest wait times to cross to the north on a Friday and Saturday?
6197422,That Minnesota guy,2018-05-20 19:59:00,8293,You hit her early Saturday and it could be hours. To be honest I have found getting out takes longer.
6197424,Bstar,2018-05-20 20:02:00,564,Check out this site for border wait times http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html You can check out the approximate time you will be crossing leading up to your trip to get an idea of the wait times. We usually go up in July and August so the wait times are probably different than in June but Saturday mornings are almost always busy. We cross on Friday afternoon with no wait time and spend the night on Fort Frances.
6197512,SteveZ,2018-05-21 06:04:00,271,Make sure you have a letter written by the child's mother that it is okay to take your son out of the country.
6197530,That Minnesota guy,2018-05-21 06:32:00,8293,Couple of crossing tips. Have your license / passport ready. Remove you sunglasses. Answer only the questions when asked. Don't be a comedian or smart a$$. I always roll my boat cover up so they can easily look in the boat if I'm waiting in line anyway. Good luck & have fun. Remember you are a guest.
6197534,prov1900,2018-05-21 06:36:00,544,"And notarized at that... At least I always do. Not sure if it is a requirement, but it lends credibility to your paperwork. There are specific forms that you can print off for this, search the web."
6197564,terrapin,2018-05-21 07:08:00,353,"There is a form online for taking a minor across the border. 90% of the time you don't need it, the other 10% can cost you hours. My kids play in a cross border youth hockey league, every year a couple kids miss the first game of a tournament."
