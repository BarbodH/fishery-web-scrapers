If you did, would you not factor in the exchange rate in your favor just to cover your costs?I'm sure my local bait shop would run your azz out the door if you tried to pay in CND there. Plastic gets you the best rates, but a pocket full of CND shows respect and not the ""entitled American"" attitude I see more than one should from travelers. (Mexico and Canada for me) Every year I exchange five hundred USD to CND at our local bank. This will cover incidentals for three trips. Exchange rate isn't too far off of the daily rate. There is no bank charge if it's under $300 (USD to CND), but $10 if over. It is a convenience thing for me.I'm not preaching, just thinking out loud to guys I enjoy reading and chatting with.Pooch"
6206144,v-bay gord,2018-06-08 09:59:00,3168,"The business's that exchange your US at par aren't doing it to make extra money, but as a ""service"" to their US customers. As been stated many times in threads on rates in US vs. Canadian, the underlying reason is to make it ""easier"" for US customers. Some go so far to say they will willingly accept a loss during low exchange rate years to satisfy their client base."
6206364,Bstar,2018-06-08 20:05:00,564,You can call the Duty Free store and get a quote on the exchange rate for that day as it changes daily although not drastically. I believe you can exchange up to $1000.
6205706,wally28,2018-06-07 05:48:00,65,We are crossing border at International Falls; where is best place to get Canadian money? In the Sault we go to the Casino on the Canada side. Thanks!
6205720,martinbns,2018-06-07 06:26:00,1520,"All major Banks are in Fort Frances, just go to one of their ATMs and withdraw cash. Unless you are trying to withdraw a large sum, like enough to pay for your trip in total the differences you will experience in exchange is minimal in the grand scheme of things."
6205734,bigwalleye1,2018-06-07 06:58:00,2632,"The bank you do business with at home can usually secure CDN for you, if you bank at Wells Fargo, some locations have it on hand. ATM in Canada is the other option. Most banks in Canada will no longer exchange USD for CDN unless you have an account. They quit doing it a couple years ago, it was explained to me they have fear of counterfeit dollars."
6205752,rockape,2018-06-07 07:26:00,215,"I use credit cards exclusively in Canada (unless the lodge owner wants a check). That way, I get the EXACT exchange rate. Some places will screw you on paying with cash if you use American $. I don't want to take the time or the hassle to get Canadian currency. I usually only buy gas and maybe some groceries once I am across the border. Be sure to call your credit card companies so they know you are crossing at IF and will be in Canada for a week. I've had mine blocked in recent years when I have used them easily before."
6205756,martinbns,2018-06-07 07:34:00,1520,"That's your other option, down side is in some more isolated areas some business' will be very small and may not take cards. When we travel to the states for a few days or a week, we usually only take a couple hundred bucks in cash to pay for things like coffee etc. The rest is cards. Also the real reason Cdn Banks won't exchange cash for non-clients is Know your client and Anti-money laundering. US banks can't do it for us either."
6205764,wmd,2018-06-07 07:56:00,388,You can exchange at the Duty Free store in IF as well. Don't know what their exchange rate is. wmd
6205768,racin_onthebrain,2018-06-07 08:07:00,4,I just get it from my bank. Just go in the week before your trip and order from the teller. Only takes them 2 to 3 days max. Then I don't have to worry about credit card working or if they take them.
6205900,BornToFish,2018-06-07 13:18:00,1224,"Greetings,The post by Rockape pretty much said it all. My wife and I really don't spend much money in Canada any more, as we have enough souvenirs to last for about ever. We might use our credit cards three or four times at most, on any given trip - fuel, groceries, bait and hotel. The exchange rate through our credit card has always been favorable to us. As he mentioned, make sure to advise your lender/credit card that you will be traveling in Ontario, to ensure your card is not declined.Good fishing and tight lines!"
6205904,Lovetofish,2018-06-07 13:21:00,458,I just use my credit card. Thanks for the reminder and I called in my travel alert for next month.
6206114,SterlingArcher,2018-06-08 07:49:00,92,"Credits card for gas and food, exchange US for Canadian at a local bank to pay for the big expenses if the lodge doesn't take credit cards (like the one I go to). Many places in Canadia will give you barely a tithe of the actual exchange rate (one year when the actual rate was about 1.20:1 places we stopped told us they would take US dollars at par!). Deerwood Bank, where I bank locally, gives almost the full exchange rate and charges next to nothing for a fee. In years where the exchange rate is very strong - it's at 1.30:1 this morning - I will buy extra Canadian $ as a down payment for next year/hedge against a decline in the dollar."
