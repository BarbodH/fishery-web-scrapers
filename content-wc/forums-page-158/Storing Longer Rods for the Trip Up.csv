6204774,RRK285,2018-06-05 14:29:00,44,I was wondering about what people do to transport longer rods that do not fit into the boat rod storage? I would like them all in the boat some how as i have a pickup with bed cover put them in a travel tube ? lay them on the floor of the boat and maybe wrap them with a moving blanket ? any ideas

6204980,JOE WALLEYE,2018-06-05 20:33:00,753,How do you store them in the boat when moving from spot to spot on the water? On the deck with boat buckles? If that is the case I would store them exactly the same way for the drive
6205010,btyreprich,2018-06-05 21:05:00,1067,My buddy works part time at Home Depot. He made his own rod storage case out of PVC pipe. One end glued shut and the other has a screw on lid. Very heavy duty - we joke that a car could run over the tube and not brake it. I think he also wrapis the rods in old beach towels for added safety. I myself just have a Plano rod store tube that is adjustable for all of my rods. This case has never let me down.

6205168,prov1900,2018-06-06 07:16:00,544,"I lay them in the bow with bubble wrap around the tip end and butt end. I just make sure that there isn't anything in the main compartment to roll around and smash them. Never broke/damaged one yet. For peace of mind, the pvc would certainly be more ideal."
6205228,RRK285,2018-06-06 08:12:00,44,"I have a crestliner so they wont fit laying on the bow. On, the water i just point them out the back, but with the cover on going from Chicago to Sioux Lookout I was thinking of something else. I too use the PVC/Sewer pipe with the screw end for the roof rack but wanted to lay them in the boat someway possibly rigged and ready. I will just put the tube in the boat"
6205264,rockape,2018-06-06 08:51:00,215,"I'm a rigged and ready guy. I just make sure nothing is going to fall on them. Haven't broken anything yet. I want to get fishing immediately when I get to my first spot. Reels on, line rigged, and jig or leader already tied on! I do like wrapping them in a blanket though."
6205320,Aspencreek,2018-06-06 09:53:00,2911,"I made my own out of 4"" PVC pipe as well, simple, easy and took way shorter time than I thought it would. SO, I made a couple more for my 2 piece set ups. Glued one end with a cap, other end with screw in cap and to keep from losing the screw in cap, drilled a couple holes and used grass trimmer line to connect, then padded the ends with foam cut to fit tight, and stuff some crumpled newspaper in to keep the rods in place. So I have 4 tubes all for less than I would have spent on a bazooka, and you can run over them with the truck and they can go bouncing down the highway without hurting whats inside. ID is printed in Sharpie, and my brother spray painted his to match the boat."
