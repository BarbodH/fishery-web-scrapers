6204658,forgop,2018-06-05 10:27:00,880,"I'm headed up to Obabikon on LOTW for a last minute trip for just 3 days of fishing in a week. Since I have a few extra days ahead of me, I'm looking to see if I can squeeze my way in for another couple of days (around June 11-13th). Any suggestions? Would need a boat, place to stay, nothing fancy and housekeeping plan would be fine. Worst case scenario is just renting a boat/motor and staying at nearby hotel if no rooms were available at the camp. Thanks!"

It's about a 7 mile boat ride from where you put in at Labelle's. I've never stayed at Labelle's but it gets good reviews from folks here on WC. There is one more camp you boat past when you go to CN, but I can't think of the name of it."
6204702,emma17,2018-06-05 12:32:00,436,"Sorry I don't have specific recommendations but I know there are camps around Morson, which you'll be departing from for Obabikon."
6204706,Bill Krejca,2018-06-05 12:46:00,6107,"Goggle Morson, Ontario resorts, there are a number of camps right around the area you will be taking off from to get to Obabikon. Bill"
6204708,forgop,2018-06-05 12:48:00,880,I've been looking at several from the sunsetcountry website.
6204720,1700SS,2018-06-05 13:06:00,104,"Red Wing lodge, take a tent. They have shower house for campers. Only $15/night. Mike has boat/motor daily rental. Tell them Brett sent you."
6204778,forgop,2018-06-05 14:33:00,880,Camping is a little rougher than I want to go unfortunately. Arrowhead in Nestor Falls has availability and it's not going to break the bank either.
6204932,The tank,2018-06-05 19:36:00,340,Buena vista resort has motel rooms in morson. I've stayed their before nice place and nice people. the motel rooms are like most cabins on the inside. also have a restaurant and the food is really good.
