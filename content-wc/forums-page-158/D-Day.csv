6205450,ScottWisconsin,2018-06-06 12:20:00,14,God bless the young men and women who sacrificed so much for so many. Its hard for folks today to understand the enormous sacrifice all the allied nations made in the name of world peace. My grandfather was killed at iwo jima. Ive spent countless hours reading letters from the pacific as well as pouring over combat footage and war journal photos just hoping to catch a glimpse of my personal hero. Thank you to each and every vet from every generation. You all have earned the right to stand down. Cronk Semper fi

According to accounts in one of Stephen Ambrose's books, few of the U.S. soldiers who landed on D-Day survived untouched the trek across Europe by the end of the war. Most who landed were either later wounded, or were killed along the way. So many of the heroes in his books, described in detail for their individual heroic acts, later on, a day or two days, or a month later, were killed. Not like the happy story book endings perhaps considered the norm by folks who were not there. R.I.P. Bill"
