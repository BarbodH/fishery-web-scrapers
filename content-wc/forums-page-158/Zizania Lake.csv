6205344,BlueJayBert,2018-06-06 10:17:00,15,Any suggestions as to what to use and where to fish n Zizania Lake? We will be fishing there in late June. Thanks for any ideas.
6205474,phishfearme,2018-06-06 12:58:00,1242,"we fished that lake when it was a single day, flyin, boat cache lake with Excellent Adventures - walleye were wherever you can find rock piles or dropoffs and easy to catch on twister jigs - lots of large pike also. sounder is essential. is this now a destination lake (outfitter cabin)? if so, I would bet that the characteristics are TOTALLY different as it's fairly small and highly susceptible to fishing pressure. phish"
6205478,phishfearme,2018-06-06 13:00:00,1242,by the way - I think it's Zinzania not Zizania. phish
6205498,Walleye2242,2018-06-06 13:39:00,263,is this a fly in lake? Is there a resort or a cabin on this lake now? I did a 1 day fly in to this lake through Doug Gawley years ago...we flew in....and he picked us up a the end of the day. If it the same lake....its not fishing...its catching....HA! Whatever you got in the box will work. We caught 100's....100's of walleyes.

They were all one day fly-in trips.The fishing was consistently straightforward and spectacular. Just find them and stay on top of them for the rest of the day. I had a portable depth finder with me on many of the trips. It was helpful in dialing in the proper depth. We fished in front of the large, ""seagull"" type rock. We just drifted in front of this rock until we caught them. We also had a nice spot about one minute ride from the dock. We came out from the dock, made a left along the shoreline outside of the small bay and went about fifty yards. We normally took about ten dozen minnows per angler. The first time my wife came along, she had a walleye shake off the minnow along side the boat. I told her to grab that minnow! She looked perplexed at me. I told her that she would need that minnow after lunch, as she would be out of bait. She was and she did!I appreciate the earlier comment about fishing pressure. Rights to that lake have switched hands a time or two. I thought the quality of the fishing, while always still good, had slipped over the years.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I think Clark bought up all of Gawleys fly in camps and lakes. Over the years of 1 day fly ins with gawley we did, zizania, waupesi, twain, celt(?) and a few others...they were ALL amazing. We did a few week long fly ins as well and were outstanding."
