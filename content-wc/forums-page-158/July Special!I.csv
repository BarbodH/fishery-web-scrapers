6205916,eyegator,2018-06-07 13:46:00,29,"Anyone have feedback on this place? Is the fishing any good in the early fall on that part of Red Lake?I reached out once and I have to be honest, I reached out once and was not impressed with the correspondence. Lots of ""rules"" as well. Either way, we all have bad days and I can get past that- just curious on the fishing. Mainly walleye? I see they have trout in that area by the website."

As far as rules, they ask for some help with meals. Not a big deal, a few minutes after breakfast and dinner, in the late season with few groups everyone pitched in , to help serve and cleanup.. They run a tight ship, but there is a vibe there that's hard to explain. PM me if you have any questions. No official relationship, just a satisfied customer ."
