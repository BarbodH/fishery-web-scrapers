Everyone fished for up to 2 hours using a Disney Princess rod and reel to see who caught the biggest fish with it. I'm talking about the little pink and purple rod and reel combo about 3' long that costs less than $10 at Walmart. Talk about a lot of fun fishing! Other boats near us gave us some of the strangest looks while we were fishing using that combo. Surprisingly, many nice walleyes were caught, including: 13"", 14"", 16.5"", 17"", 23"", 23.5"" and the winner was 23.75""! Next time we'll have more defined rules, because some guys fished for the entire 2 hours and others fished for only a few minutes. I caught a 16.5"" walleye in about 5 minutes and immediately passed the rod along to my boat partner. Others fished for several hours and caught many fish, entering only their largest. Either way, we all had a blast and got some good laughs! Who says you need an expensive rod and reel to catch fish! All fish were also caught out of camp boats with 15 HP motors, no trolling motors, and only portable electronics. That's about as low tech as you can go and we still caught a bunch of quality fish. I encourage all groups to do this or something similar."

Just takes some luck and the right water. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

6206628,pjshorthorn,2018-06-09 12:55:00,5654,"That is a beauty of a fish for the young lad. The smile says it all. The 89 year old fella probably played that whopper off pretty cool like, yep done this my whole life. To be doing a trip like that at 89.......no one can be cooler than that.Is that 202 for rent anytime soon? PjShorthorn"

6207156,Slim03,2018-06-10 21:50:00,159,We started doing this 3 years ago as a joke. I brought my daughters princess pole and the night before fishing we rigged it with 30lb braid and a pink 1/4 oz jig. She gets passed around every day and everyone must catch a fish with her. Once a fish is caught a shot of crown is required. We have had a lot of fun with it and princess has caught many nice fish over the years and made for some great stories. My daughter still thinks itâ€™s funny when I grab princess out of the rod rack to take to Canada.
