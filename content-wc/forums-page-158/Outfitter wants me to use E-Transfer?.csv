I can attest for Mark though of Nakina North. I've flown in with him before and met him at the dock, solid guy, solid outfitter, you have nothing to worry about there."
6206566,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-09 10:14:00,147,"Just booked a last minute fly in trip that is set for 2 weeks from now. The outfitter wants us to use E-transfer to transfer the money to him instead of a check or cash on the spot. Has anyone used this before? Looks like it is a Canadian Bank thing, I've never heard of it here in the States. I get that we cant send a check because it might not get to him before the trip in 2 weeks, but whatever happened to cold hard cash on the spot? Looking for insight. Thanks"
6206572,nicko,2018-06-09 10:28:00,508,Do it all the time....bank to bank transfer....very safe....He probably want to insure you're actually coming. Too many people these days back out leaving these guys holding the bag. Unfortunately the honest ones pay for that.
6206576,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-09 10:36:00,147,Do I just do it through my banks online website?
6206630,Angler1700,2018-06-09 13:00:00,37,"If you are American you may not be able to access the Canadian system. E-Transfers in Canada are done through a payment services provider called 'Interac'. We call the transfers 'Interac E Transfer'. Interac (the company) looks after most debit and e-transfers in Canada for all major banks and credit unions. E-transfers themselves using this system are very very common and are rapidly replacing cheques on how to send money to other people, so the system and it's operation is totally safe and 'legit' if that is your concern. If your bank has access to this system, they could potentially send one, or you could cheque out interac's website and they may have a solution for you. Your bank would probably be able to send a wire, but those are fairly pricey and would need your outfitters banking information and swift code. Alternatively, if you outfitter was accepting, you could send the funds via something like paypal. That system is universally accepted in both countries and all you need is his email address and is probably the simplest solution.Branch Manager - Winnipeg Credit Union, 14 yrs.All the best."
6206634,pjshorthorn,2018-06-09 13:07:00,5654,I have used Xoom in the past and there is no fee to transfer money if it is over a certain amount. Easy to do and money transfers in 2-3 business days. The kicker is that the outfitter has to give you all his banking information in order to transfer the money....which isn't likely if you are a new customer. Just an option to consider. PjShorthorn
6206636,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-09 13:07:00,147,"Thanks Angler. I'm not overly concerned about it being legit, more so like you were saying, te transfer of funds from an American bank to a Canadian bank. Seems like it would be a very big hassle. I am very comfortable with Paypal so I will ask the outfitter if they accept that. The only issue with either of these things is that it requires all the money to be in one account. Thats why I would much rather just give him cash in person especially since it is such late notice."
6206644,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-09 13:10:00,147,"Thanks, I will also ask them about that if they cannot do Paypal"
6206668,v-bay gord,2018-06-09 14:43:00,3168,An informative post.......you should do it more often!
6206670,The tank,2018-06-09 14:55:00,340,I've done e transfers in the states a few times but never from here to Canada. I just have my bank do it for me.
