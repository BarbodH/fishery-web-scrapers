I told him we could stop on the way up and he can get it then. We will be going up through the Soo and I was wondering what the most convenient place for him to get it was. Does the Wallmart in the Soo sell them?
6206984,Namegosikaa,2018-06-10 13:17:00,61,Lots of places to buy a license on the way but If your drive requires few stops on a tight schedule you can purchase a license at pennocks gas bar in Nakina. They are open daily usually quite early til about 9'or 10pm
6206986,Ogoki,2018-06-10 13:58:00,291,"As you go out of Soo, Ontario, stop at the Trading Post. Use credit card or Canadian cash. They don't give a very good exchange rate. Bought our bear tags there Friday a week ago. Quick and easy. In case you are not familiar with where they are , as the road goes from four lanes to two lanes , they are on the right . Have fun on your trip !!! I just can't get enough of Ontario , even after over 70 weeks in the past 30 years . Be safe and enjoy looking at Superior . Watch for moose . Saw numerous along the road from Soo to Wawa and more over to Thunder Bay ."

6207010,phishfearme,2018-06-10 14:32:00,1242,the MNR website allows you to print out your license right after you pay for it - no need to stop anywhere. phish
6207016,Bstar,2018-06-10 14:35:00,564,That's the best way. It's in your hand before you leave.
