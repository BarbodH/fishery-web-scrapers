568433,Guest,2007-08-16 20:03:00,0,Does anyone know of a fishing lodge that is on McPherson Island in Canada on Lake of the Woods. I am looking for a lodge that is near this area or somewhere in the general vicinity. Thanks for any input.

On the north side of the island, maybe three hundred yards away, is Spruce Island Camp. www.spruceislandcamp.com At the south entrance to Sabaskosing Bay (south edge of McPherson Island) is Bell Island Outpost. www.bellislandoutpost.com Marv"
