Last year the Red was hot and the Winnipeg River was cold until the end of October. They're only an hour apart so you can switch. My experience over the years is that the Red consistently produces lots of saugers, some ""eater"" greenback walleyes and more masters than the Winnipeg. The Winnipeg has produced more 16""-20"" fish for me than the Red but fewer 27""+ fish. Traverse Bay at the mouth of the Winnipeg can offer both a trolling and jig bite. Somedays on the Red they want it horizontal (trolling Shad Raps, Raps, Walleye Divers) and somedays they want it vertical and still. Let the 'eyes tell you."

If the wind is a strong 20 mph+, forget about going to the Winnipeg, it doesn't take much wind to keep you off the bay. We've seen 5 footers in the bay with a 20-30 mph wind. Seems like there is less fishing pressure at the Winnipeg compared to the Red. We've had great days at both places. In general we seem to catch more fish at the Winnipeg. But like others mentioned before. The ratio of big fish/# of fish caught is greater at the Red. Our decision is usually made up by what the wind is doing that day. We prefer to fish the Winnipeg for the simple fact that there are a lot less boats out there. You will use a lot more gas at the Winnipeg. It's a good 6-7 miles out to the bay, and can be a really cold ride in the mornings."
