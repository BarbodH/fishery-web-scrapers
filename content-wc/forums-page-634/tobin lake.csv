568761,Guest,2007-09-04 13:54:00,0,we will be staying in rose valley so we are really looking for a lake where we can catch some good ones to have dinner. Maybe a morning in tobin and then??? somewhere on the way back to catch some for dinner. Thanks!!
568772,Guest,2007-09-05 15:29:00,0,Rick Where the heck are you going to stay in Rose valley....LOL I would try Barrier Lake....I grew up there....good be good or could be poor..depends on the day. Probably catch enough for a meal or two. Good luck! Clarkie
568785,Guest,2007-09-06 12:09:00,0,"Rick, How about a call.... Joe We are staying at a farmers house and having a mixed week of hunting and fishing... Thanks for the help guys. Joe"
568791,T Mac,2007-09-06 15:45:00,10084,"Alan... it's even more fun when it is late October, 15 degrees Farenheit, snowing, and you must spread sand on the launch ramp in order to use it. ..............Then to have fishing about like you had. Yup, it can happen. Tobin fishing is not like a Fly-in lake. Sorry you had lousy luck. But....on big lakes...one can often sit on shore a lot...no matter how far they drove to get there. It has happened to most us... and is why the big lakes have big fish. The wind saves a lot of fish from being caught."
568793,Guest,2007-09-06 16:57:00,0,"that makes sense. I guess I was relying on some luck and it ran out. well the fish dont have to worry about me anymore up there. i think i will stick to lake mead here. its only about a half hour away. On the Nodak web site someone was saying that the fish in the river system of saschatawan are contaminated with mercury and pcb's. Of all the web sites i had not seen that before, it could be just garbage. ok thanks and good luck. alan"

568807,T Mac,2007-09-07 08:33:00,10084,"The fish in Saskatchewan River reportedly do have high levels of mercury, etc. That's why the fish in Tobin are sooo Heavy... ;) ;)"

568836,Guest,2007-09-08 12:59:00,0,maybe it was best that we did not catch any fish then. on lake of the woods we would eat fish twice a day for 7 days.
568507,Guest,2007-08-19 02:14:00,0,"there rae new regs in tobin this year guys,,, barbless and a new limits later"
568543,T Mac,2007-08-21 11:20:00,10084,Keep some small ones for dinner...if you get some small ones. But...sometimes it is hard to catch any that are small enough (under the slot) As for getting a some on the way home... where is home? I might know some spots to stop if I knew which way you were headed.
568544,T Mac,2007-08-21 11:22:00,10084,"Is that you, Paul? Looked like your typing... LOL. If so, ... you doing any good in tournies this year? e-mail me. Terry"
568562,Tredeb,2007-08-22 11:47:00,29,"I wouldn't call tobin lake or anything south of there a good lake for eating fish. You need to go further north to get into the really good eating. For trophies, Tobin is the place to be. For good eating, you need to get out of the Saskatchewan river system. Try some of the lakes up the Hanson lake road or Candle Lake(1.5 hrs west of tobin). the trophies won't be there, but there is no comparison for eating."
568571,Guest,2007-08-23 13:18:00,0,I want to fish Tobin for a shot a trophy. What is the best time of the year to try the system. I never fished the system. Thanks

I have caught decent sized fish there in the spring/early summer, but 99% of my fishing and camping was done up north, not at Tobin."
568574,uzzi,2007-08-23 13:43:00,349,"You can catch a trophy there any time of the year, but I'll say your best bet for lots of piggies is later on, end of Sept, all thru October in the river section, seems like thats about the time the majority of the mama's start heading into the river section to strap on the feedbag for winter"
568630,Guest,2007-08-27 15:31:00,0,"Just got back from tobin. i had high expectations and they were really dashed. so windy for 3 days no one could get on the lake. there is no cover or protected water at all. the wind has a clear path right down the lake. the one day we got on went down to the eagles nest and of the 8 boats drifting or anchored, all locals, no one caught any fish. the 70 dollor licenses were enough for me. I wont be back to canada until #### freezes over. I got brochures from the 6 places on the lake and find that its really deceiving how they take pictures for their brochure that make it look they are an isolated camp when really they are in a little city. the fishing sucked big time. even the border guard at the U.S. side said after the 3rd degree that nobody has been coming back with any fish from tobin or had been catching anything to speak of. they might have the record fish but that is pobably the only fish in the lake. I wont be back. they can keep their fish."
568631,uzzi,2007-08-27 15:56:00,349,"Alan, where did you stay and where did you primarily fish at? Fishing for walleye or pike or both? Did you hire a guide? Lots of water out there and lots of spots for the walleyes to hide. Fishing was incredible on the big lake in July (fished 4 days a week for the month) between Tobin Resort, Prudens point and Pemican point. June was pretty hot for us on the river section (but we were only out 2 times in June), fished first, second drifts and white rock, eagles nest with lots of success. I hadnt fished Nipawin/Tobin since end of July. Heard lots of reports though about the great fishing up to and during the Premiers Cup and Fish for Freedom tournies on the river section. Look at the fish caught and weights on the Premier's cup website. Keep in mind the slot size too that wont show up anywhere as they go back in the water. Personally, I was back up at Tobin this weekend, camped and fished. Only got out on the water Saturday, as it was pretty nice, fished on the big lake for a couple hours on spots that produced fish this summer, not a bite. Said the heck with it and went up the river and fished Eagles nest and Whiterock, bottom bounced and Lindy rig all over the place, not a single bite all day there either, managed one tiny pike in our last 5 minutes of fishing. Hung our heads and went home, but hey, at least we were fishing, right! Weather was cool and windy or I would have tried cranks next. Talked to a couple other boats that were having the exact same luck as us. Same day my buddy also went up to the Flats, fished for 3 hours beside 11 other boats, netted 15 pike in 3 hours, largest is 41 inches his wife caught........ I can see how you'd be discouraged about spending alot of money and coming a long way to find some big eyes, but you can see from my story is that sometimes its hot, and sometimes its cold, even on the same body of water. It's like that everywhere I've ever fished, anyways. Some days you can throw the kitchen sink at em and they're lined up to fill up your livewell. And other days no matter what you do you cant get em to bite. Guess thats why they call it ""fishing"" and not ""catching"" BTW, there are lots of good spots on that body of water to get out of the wind and catch some walleyes. Sorry to hear you had lousy luck fishing. Did you catch some walleyes at least? How many? Fortunately I live only 1 hour away from Nipawin and can fish that body of water whenever, so bad days dont bother me up there. But I have also gone on long fishing trips. Same thing, some years we nail em, other years, not so great, but we still seem to have fun."
568643,Guest,2007-08-28 01:09:00,0,thanks for the info. of the 3 days on the water our boat caught 1 count em 1 perch. we could see the fish on the finder but they would not bite. when we went to lake of the woods or lac saul we always had fish for dinner most of the time if not all of the time. maybe its for the best. our drive was almost 4000 miles thats just too far. I guess I will have to learn how to fish lake mead here. thanks for your comments.
568279,Guest,2007-08-11 14:49:00,0,"isn't that why some of us pay the big bucks to go to fish in Canada is to keep some fish to take home. Who wants to take home a bunch of 15 inchers. Your fishery biologists have come up with the slot limits to protect the spawners. If they allow you to keep a few large specimens, then they have figured it won't effect the population. If they thought it would damage the population, then it would be catch and release only. Fisherman choose to fish Tobin because they can bring a wall hanger home."
568286,Guest,2007-08-11 19:14:00,0,yes a lot of thoughts. we used to fish lake of the woods and it really got bad. they would let the natives catch fish by the ton in nets with no thoughts about size. they caught the walleye and threw the northerns up on the shore or forgot about the nets altogether because we got hung up it nets with a lot of dead decaying fish in them. I hope they dont let it happen out in sasch. I still would like to know about the dry ice. thanks.
568293,korn,2007-08-12 08:37:00,25,"I have been going to Tobin Lake since 2000.We have released alot of 10s 12s and 14 lbers.That's why they call it CPR.Catch,Photo,and Release.The regulations are even better this year.Barbless hooks are mandatory, and no Walleye or Sauger between (21.7in)and (33.9in)can be kept.Also if you get into the Northerns and they are HUGE,everthing between (29.5in) and (45.3in) must be released.This is a world class fishery and it's up to us to keep it that way.Keep a few little ones to eat while your there and throw the rest back.To me it's not worth the hassle of bringing them back.As far as place to stay I would recommend Silver Tip Outfitting,they have a website.My 2 cents."
568301,Ia Walihntr,2007-08-12 20:54:00,320,Is this Po-Korn-y of river fame? Wish I was going with!
568450,Guest,2007-08-17 13:57:00,0,"Well we will be up there in late sept and my friend joe needs some tips on how to catch walleys as he is the worst fisherman you even seen. Just dont tell him that!. we are comming all the way from Chicago so he could really use the help!!! oh rjord I'm going to be in Vegas in oct can you give me some tips on the best tables in vegas.,., they took me for over 10k last time so this time its pay back... oh and what is the best stripclub in vegas? oh are there any up there near tobin lake???"
568474,T Mac,2007-08-18 13:00:00,10084,"I have been going to Tobin since the early 80s. I have caught my share of big walleyes there...but never kept one over 21"". We eat a few small ones (under slot) while there. I never went there to bring back fish. There are thousands of other lakes in Sask for that. Tobin is special. There's nothing like setting the hook straight up...into a double digit Sumo Piggy walleye... on six pound line... or sliding the net under a 10-15 pounder for your buddy......and then releasing them. And doing it several times a day...:):) Nope... Tobin is not the place to go to keep fish. Beside the great walleye genetics that need to be protected, the fish there are high in content on PCBs and Mercury anyway. Point is... many of us have gone there for decades with no intention on keeping any walleyes. We stop other places on the way home and keep a few."

568502,Guest,2007-08-18 17:28:00,0,"Make a stop at Last Mountain or Ft Quapple for an afternoon and you'll get enough fish to eat. They are clean and plentiful in those lakes. Don't slab a big one! Bad enough to deplete the fishery, but the chemicals you may ingest just might do you in as well. It is the end of the river and everything bad up stream ends up there so I won't say more. Mercury looks good on a motor, not in your blood. Maybe that is why they get so big. Let em go and hook em next year. Good Karma goes along way. Please have a blast and practise catch and release and the biologists can stay away for good! Also, my 2 cents."
568164,Guest,2007-08-07 18:22:00,0,Going to Tobin lake mid-September for the first time. We want to use a guide the first day. Can anyone recommend a good guide? Can you also recommend a good boat rental and place to stay?
568192,uzzi,2007-08-08 15:39:00,349,"Try Silver Tip Outfitters or Tobin Lake resort, have never used either personally, but I see lots of activity at the Silvertip store anyways, and same with the Tobin Lake resort store. pretty sure they both have websites"
568235,Guest,2007-08-10 02:19:00,0,Ok thanks. do they have dry ice in that area? I always like to bring some fish home to eat through the year in anticipation of the next year. thanks. alan
568245,T Mac,2007-08-10 08:27:00,10084,Alan...you can only keep a few fish. The resorts have freezers. Our cabin at MacSwaney's had plenty enough freezer space for what few fish we kept. Pack them well and they will stay frozen until you get home. You'll have them eaten in no time. ;)
568262,Guest,2007-08-10 21:36:00,0,if we are lucky enough i would like to take our 2 limits home. we live in las vegas so we will need some dry ice. its a long drive
568263,Guest,2007-08-10 22:07:00,0,"Please don't slab a 10lber to take home with you it makes me sick to see some one put a knife to a fish that is bigger than many fisherman have seen . I am from Sask. and we see it all the time . One time I said something to an American about the 2 9lbers he has on the cutting board and he got mad saying that they were allowed to have 2 fish over 22"" which is true but a bucket of mud off the bottom of the lake would have fed more people and probably tasted about the same. Please don't see Canada as a chance to fill your freezer. You guys come here for the good fishing and if people keep taking out our spawners the good fishing just won't last . I am not saying don't put a few slots in the tub for supper while you are here just try and release the big ones to fight again . With the new slots this year and the barbless rules coming in it should help . Now a fish will be about 12lbs before it can be kept . Keep coming up and help our buisnesses here but remeber that your kids may one day want to experience the thrill of a big Canadian walleye or pike"
568272,Guest,2007-08-11 09:42:00,0,You can't legally slab a 10 pounder at Tobin. The slot limit protects those little 10 pounders. It is an excellent slot limit at Tobin which works very well to keep the big fish in the system. Excellent trophy potential for a 15 or 16# eye at Tobin.
568273,Guest,2007-08-11 10:34:00,0,This was in the past at Tobin that I seen this. Now you will get to see them slab a 12 or 13 . Almost need barf bags at the door of the fillet shack when I see that.
568274,Guest,2007-08-11 11:43:00,0,I agree that catch and release(especially the spawners) is theonly way to go.We only fish lakes that try to practice this type of conservation.We come from the U.S. several times a year to Canada and love and appreciate the opportunity.Unfortunately 90% of the abuse we have seen of the resources has not been from fishermen from the States but rather the locals.Most of us that spend the time and money to come back year after year understand and practice solid conservation. I catch enough walleyes back home to eat.
568277,Guest,2007-08-11 14:30:00,0,Sorry for the rant and I was not trolling or trying to pick a fight . Just putting it out there to give a little reminder to all the guys coming up.
