568832,AllenW,2007-09-08 08:47:00,11482,"Well, hopefully after all this walleye250 got his anwser..:) fwiw For the most part I've always had good times going to Canada, while not overly enthusiast, the Canadians have been more than pleasant to deal with...well except for that wacko game warder and that's another story..:) If one remembers that us (Minnesotans) going to Canada is no different than Iowans coming to Minn,it might be easier to see why not every one there is not going out of their way to make life pleasant or give their favorite fishing hole away. After having gone to Canada for over 25 years now, I have to say its been a pleasant experience and have even made a few friends there, we try to treat everybody as we'd expect to get treated and it seems to work, I look forward to going back each year. Just a thought.. Al"

568704,Frankm,2007-08-29 14:19:00,154,You are so wrong Brieye. I live and work in McHenry IL. I've been going to Canada for 14 years. We used to get everything and drive through in one day. Now we do 2 days so we have to get some of our groceries there. I'm sorry you have such bad feelings towards Canadians. I don't!
568683,Frankm,2007-08-29 14:23:00,154,Walley250. I was surprised being a member since 2004 you haven't seen all the posts/links about these subjects. No disrespect to you. Some of help on these boards is great. Unlike Brieye who assumes I'm a Canadian store owner because my group buys a few groceries.

568684,Guest,2007-08-29 14:33:00,0,Not trying to change the subject but does Richard still own the KCR camp? Loved the fishing up there but couldn't take the owner any more after 18 years of it.

568685,Guest,2007-08-29 15:27:00,0,Awwww come on. Like we're going to share our fishing spots. I'll give you important stuff like directions for bait and beer. What more do you need.......

568718,A Canuck,2007-08-30 20:37:00,86,"all your potato belong to us....Har Har... Seriously though... The guy asked a simple question... why get your panties in a bunch.. not everyone is familiar with the way a message board works.. and even fewer use the search function.. seeing as how this board is probably comprised of 96% American Anglers.... I can see why you boys dont see too many reports from us... besides if we are fishing it is usually our Home waters.. or like me within a 3-5 hour drive... nothing huge to talk about in terms of some of our southern brothers journeys for sure!...I live in Hamilton.. My trips consist of heading up to Lake Nipissing Walleye fishing...(Great fishery BTW)... but nothing compared to driving 13 Hours to the LOTW area.. Sorry I just dont dont have to drive that far to catch Walleye.. I have seen thousands of Ohio and Pennsylvania plates over the years... but this board seems to have a heavy Minnesota Presence.. hard for them to hit my ""home waters"" as most Americans know we are a laid back crown at most times... I tend not to add anything to a post if I dont feel I have anything worthwhile to add.. you guys talk about areas I will probably never fish.. the only reason for that?? I can still catch walleye within 30 minutes-5 hours from my front door... Dont even get me started on Quinte!! Come on November!! Just my 1.923 cents CANADIAN! A Canuck Yes Beer was consumed during the making of this post."
568808,davenathe,2007-09-07 10:31:00,113,"A Canuck, good job putting things in perspective. The search function can reveal a lot of good information for two reasons.

568677,Frankm,2007-08-29 11:31:00,154,"""how about other items such as eggs, hashbrowns"". Sounds like potatoes to me (partly). Like others said why not search the forum first. It just amazes me what a big deal a bag of potatoes is to some people. I don't understand why if people are so worried about it. Why don't they do the research themselves. Its very easy to get false information from discussion boards. I don't like to worry about that stuff on vacation so I do the research. Not to mention I can get potatoes and eggs in Canada. Here some links with all the info you'll need. I'll take the facts from the Canadian Customs website before I'll ever take someones opinion. Especially when it comes to crossing an international border. Have a great day. http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/o...es/laws-e.html http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/"

Some people want to just get to their camp after a 2 day drive with everything they need packed away. I would like for someone maybe Canadian to actually give me a fishing report for once. I've gotten zip from anyone. Except for telling me BS spots and BS sizes. Why don't you just advertise your guide service and have a set. Now I know why this guy can't get any help. As far as buying Canadian goods goes...Who's up there spending their money on vacation? Pissed your not getting more/any? There's another guy like this running KCR named Richard and he's from Wisconsin?"

You ask the question ""why ask for help on message boards,"" I thought that is what they were for. People getting together to help eachother out. All I wanted to know was if hashbrowns and eggs could come over the boarder. I would gladly support the local cafe but Im fishing before they open, and as for buying from a grocery store, Im sure there open hours are while Im on the water as well. Do not preach to me about supporting the locals. When we come up every year we leave hundreds of dollars behind, and we will keep coming thanks to those who have far better manners than yourself."

568651,Frankm,2007-08-28 11:12:00,154,Why do we have to discuss potatoes every other week? You can bring frozen hashbrowns or take 5 mins to stop at a grocery store and buy potatoes. Its really not a big deal.

568666,AllenW,2007-08-29 06:33:00,11482,"Might just be easier to pin a few of the Canadian/US sites on who/what/where/when and why of border crossing..? fwiw, after all these years we've got so unless its something special, we just buy it across the border, helps their economy and saves the hassle of freezing, storage and ice required to bring it with. Only thing we normally bring is a egg/milk/seasoning mixture we put into several bags and freeze, use it for scrambled eggs or fish coating with some Fryin' Magic, just easier premade it seems. Doing a search on this forum first would be a better way to go, then if your question still isn't anwsered, post it...imho It seems raw potatoes are a no, frozen hash browns are a yes, along with eggs being ok too, but considering either gov't may change their mind, I'd check the their web site to make sure.
