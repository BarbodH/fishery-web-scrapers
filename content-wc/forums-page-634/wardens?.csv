568911,Guest,2007-09-11 10:55:00,0,"In six years on Minnitaki (near Sioux Lookout) we have seen wardens on the lake only once, they were in their own boat, and they were checking out some other boat, did not stop us. On White Lake in eastern Ontario we have never seen wardens but have been stopped by the OPP four times, out of five trips there! The OPP never asks about fish or licenses but asks to see safety equipment and if there is any alcohol in the boat. If the boat isn't yours he wants to see ownership info, like a rental agreement. Once I was fishing in a weed bad in about 7 ft of water and the OPP guy pulled in with his big 18 footer. He asked me if I was catching anything and I said yes, until you pulled in here with the HMS Hood."
568882,Sutsgold,2007-09-11 20:08:00,219,"Was fishing the English river on Minnitaki a few years back. A boat was about 100 yards away and on the bow was a young buxom blond waving at us. Having been at the cabin for over a week my partner and I thought we were seeing a mirage. The boat made its way towards us, with this pretty gal still motioning at us. When it got to within 15 feet she quietly stepped back and went inside the boat and two gentlemen in uniform stepped out and took her place. They checked us, and we than conversed. They were very nice and explained they were looking for some reported fishermen who were using walleyes to catch large pike. I guess they used the young lady as a way of keeping boats from fleeing as she had no part in the search of our boat or the questions that followed. We still laugh about the situation and how gullable we were to believe that in the middle of nowhere an attractive young lady would be coming on to us."

568931,Guest,2007-09-12 18:18:00,0,The story at the time was that she was doing community service for having an overlimit. The judge who sentenced her gave her that option or paying a $2000 fine.
568933,Guest,2007-09-12 19:32:00,0,"We fished a few years back on Jan Lake, I believe, and I remember a float plane coming in with a couple of very distraught looking soul's. While we tried to figure out what was going on the guy working the dock said 2 guys up from the U.S. had been pinched with hand gun possession, no license, and weed. Wow, I'd be distraught to say the least!!"
568961,Guest,2007-09-13 15:20:00,0,The weed and the license are not a real big deal...the gun thing will get you time in prison.

568825,voyaguer,2007-09-07 20:45:00,54,"been going since mid 50's my memory is: was checked once on Eagle in mid 80's. came up alongside and asked for license, check our meager stringer, identified a rock bass for us and left politely was checked once at Beavehouse in 70's. my dad forgot about trout in cooler. they were ok with that as our licenses covered it anyway. they seemed ok folks was checked on Oak in late 80's - from airplane as someone described. they were ok, pretty much business like - had the nicest plane I had seen to date long time since this sping when in saskaketwan when a pretty agreeable sort came by via plane, landed at the dock in early am just as everyone was leaving camp to fish. He was ok and tracked us down on a short portage to adjoining lake. Glad I stuck my license in my pants, although I think he would have been ok if I had to go back to camp to get it. I don't really care about having my license checked so long as it is not an interference or based on something other than someone doing their job I do care about the netting occuring by the indigenous folks. I am indigenous also - call home earth. V"
568826,Guest,2007-09-07 20:54:00,0,Only place I have seen a warden consistently was at Minaki a few years ago. Guy would camp out under the bridge and line up boats to check. He never gave us a problem even though we had beer in the boat. One day we had shore lunch stuff in the boat but no fish. He liked that we had lunch but kept no other fish. He nailed another boat though and followed them back to their cabin. We were at the store at Paradise Cove and saw the warden follow the guys in to the docks...fill a cooler with fish and then go to the cabin.
568830,Guest,2007-09-08 06:20:00,0,"We get checked once or twice on Lac Seul. I'm of course glad that they do! Keeps the meat hogs in check. Besides, we get a good fishing report from them & what seems to be working"
568834,woods,2007-09-08 10:46:00,646,"We got checked by wardens in a chopper on Crooked Pine 24 yrs ago. Very nice and businesslike. We get checked almost every year at Minaki. They check us in the boat or at the dock, then check our cabin when we get back. Always courteous. Up till a few years ago, when we got older and wiser, we always had beer in the boats, and they never once checked for it! Thanks guys!"
568874,Guest,2007-09-10 19:33:00,0,"we were stopped several years ago by a big guy named rick la blanc. looked like sgt. rock in his uniform. this was up on lotw in oct. he was checking primarily for moose violations. we were hunting ducks in the basil channel. anyway, he told us that he had no authority to look in our coolers, in our rod wells, on our person or anywhere that wasn't in plain view. if he couldn't see it from his boat it wasn't his problem. we thanked him for the info and carried on from there. another time about 10 years ago we were out on hunters island out in the middle of nowhere on lotw when up comes this big glass boat with two wardens in it. they wanted to know if we had been hunting in minn. we hadn't been. as luck would have it they had an extra quart of outboard moter oil which we needed at the time. we asked where the ducks were hiding and they told us. we motored over to the spot and had a great ring neck shoot. one of the best ever. i was told that in the lat few years or so, the gov't had cut back on funding and there were fewer wardens. we haven't seen any in two years, but it could just be the odds. they were always very helpful and professional. br"

No problems,however i wouldn't want to cross them. Anyone else get ever get checked? This was my 16th time to nw ontario and was our first."
568784,phishfearme,2007-09-06 10:30:00,1242,"we were visited at springpole lake by conservation officer Maw who flew in to check everyone within an certain area to see if he could determine who set a forest fire. he questioned us then checked our boat, cooler and made us take him to other boats on the lake. he was very courteous and was certainly all business (we had to go back to the cabin to get my fishing license - keep it in your tackle box!!!) it was abit of a pain though to take so much time to travel around the lake visiting various boats that we didn't even know were on the lake. never did find anything about the fire - he was just a guy doing his job. we've been doing trips for 25 years or so and this was the first visit AT the lake/cabin. have been check in transit a number of times. i think the MNR budget has been cut so badly though that your visit was one of only a few. phish"
568786,Guest,2007-09-06 12:12:00,0,"On Lake of the Woods (Morson Area), my head guide was checked twice. Both checks were done in Miles Bay. Haven't seen one at the camp yet, but they usually stop by every other year or so."
568788,Guest,2007-09-06 13:46:00,0,"Hi. we got checked only twice on the water in about 30 years. I guess in like any law enforcement, a couple of people get checked and the word gets around that you could be next."
568790,Guest,2007-09-06 14:28:00,0,"Last year a plane dropped in and checked us for the first time in 20-plus years. The officer was very business-like, but certainly not unpleasant nor unreasonable. A couple of us didn't have our licenses along, he gave us a fax # to send copies to once we got home; and I assume he could have made that a lot more difficult for us if he'd wanted to. He did say that they already had a plane chartered to hit all the remote camps to implement a fire ban, but the area got over an inch of rain the previous night, so since they already had a plane, they were out making checks."
568794,Minnow Man,2007-09-06 17:00:00,85,"A few years ago we had a plane land & check us out on Joyce Lake. Had 4 beer in the cooler but was drinking a Coke when they checked us out. Both of us had left our fishing licenses in our vehicle at the lodge. Had to stop by the O.P.P. station to produce them before we left town, didn't say anything about the beer. Our fish were all under 18"" & under the walleye limits, so no problem. The plane came in so quite, we didn't see or hear it until it landed beside us. They were friendly & gave us a break for not having our fishing licenses on us. Now know better for next time."
568796,Guest,2007-09-06 19:43:00,0,"If it was me and I was on vacation why would you take time to ferry a game warden around a lake looking for other boaters? Vacations are far and few to began with and now you ferried a warden for quite a while. I would of said 'no thanks, I'm enjoying my time away from work' and let him find his own way to other boaters."
568797,Guest,2007-09-06 20:24:00,0,We are checked mostly in the winter in NW Ontario. They all carry Sat phones now and can check your licence against their central data base. One of our party was checked like this whe he forgot his license and let off. Had he been lying he would have been charged with lying to the officer....$1000 to start.
568798,guidedfishing,2007-09-06 20:41:00,531,"I have been checked twice in just the last three years first in a remote location, Warden was all business and courtesy. Checked licenses made us take him back to our camp inspected camp and coolers. Thanked us for keeping a clean camp. 2nd time my son and I were stopped right in the middle of the highway and tore down. Stopped both lanes of traffic all vehicles had to wait until they finished it took approx 20 mins. They were all business but this time extended no courtesy. Again no problems but they just up and left us with everything tore down and now I have two lanes of traffic trying to get around me as my 12 year old son and I try and get the boat loaded and ready to go. They left us in a very unsafe situation which I was not very happy about. Had not been checked in the previous 20 years so I guess the law of averages are kicking in. GF"
