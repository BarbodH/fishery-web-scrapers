568927,Guest,2007-09-12 14:15:00,0,We paid 4.35 per dozen at camp in Ear Falls. That price includes PST and GST. That was about 3 weeks ago(mid August).
568928,Guest,2007-09-12 15:48:00,0,they're 2.25 if you buy them from a dealer in the Rainy area... $4 is about what you can expect from a resort.
568929,Guest,2007-09-12 16:06:00,0,On our way back from Lac Seul in July we stopped in Souix Narrows for a ice cream and there was a posting on a bulletin board stating he had the lowest minnows prices in the area. 3 KM south of Kilpatric road. Phone 807-226-5373 Did not state what the prices were but if it is on your way give him a call. Post his prices if you do call.
