568764,fisheagle,2007-09-04 21:53:00,44,"Recently the local MNR shut down the commercial fishing operation on Eagle Lake. Over harvest of Walleye was the infraction. Well it's about time. This has been going for years. Everyone suspected as much when 100 yard long nets are placed within a long cast of prime summer walleye habitat and kept there for months. The netters are supposed to be targeting whitefish with a much smaller quota for the incidental catch of walleye and other game fish. Lately though, gill nets are strung close to large main lake structure where walleye and northern frequent instead of nearby deep open water where the accidental catch of these gamefish would be kept to a minimum. The lake has been fished commercially for over 60 years and much abuse of this great fishery has occured by the operators of the netting business. Back in the day when pike were considered a trash fish to many, large pike up to 25 pounds caught in the nets were thrown on the shore for the scavengers to clean up. They weren't worth much and they tore up the nets. This went on for years. We have now learned that big fish genetically produce big fish, so essentially they helped to destroy a large part of the trophy pike population for decades. See how long it takes you to catch one pike over 10 lbs now. What a terrible waste of a resource. In the late 80s Eagle Lake's walleye fishing was being exploited with the new found success of trolling crankbaits at night over deep water in the summer. Limits( 6 each at that time ) of walleye ranging from 5 to 12 pounds were common. Resort owners, local sportsmen and the MNR united to put into effect some far sighted measures to protect the walleye population. No fishing at night, reduced limits to four and slot sizes to protect mature spawning fish. These were bold and productive moves that have helped the numbers of fish rebound and those visionaries should be praised. Today you have to release any fish which falls in the slot. The local MNR will quickly cite you for a violating the rules. But what if that same fish gets in the gill net and the commercial guys have not met their quota? Possibly the same fish that has been released several times by conservation minded sportsmen. In the boat it goes. What if they have their quota of walleye and get large walleyes in the nets? They take out a knife, slit their stomachs and throw them over the side! What a waste of a resource. Let's hope that growing awareness of this paradox results in closer scrutiny of the commercial fishermen. If they realize that many eyes are watching, they will be less likely to over harvest. If they cannot be profitable unless they break the law then they should go away."
568800,Guest,2007-09-06 22:54:00,0,Hi. So tell me what was the penalty imposed for this. they probably got rewarded with licenses to net on other lakes. they screw the visitor with rediculous limits and let the natives fish with nets. I would have thought the canadians were better than that. shame on them.
568803,v-bay gord,2007-09-07 06:28:00,3168,"fisheagle.......while I am not a big advocate for haphazard netting of sportfish I also know the individual you are painting with some misinformation. You indicate the commercial fisherman was charged with some violation...it is my understanding that the nets were taken out voluntarily because of the number of walleyes ending up in the nets and the small incidental quota that they have for that species. On Eagle the area that the commercial guy operates is quite limited........the deep area around Nash's bay is the location of most of the whitefish come late summer. It is usual to be able to set the nets (location or depth) to target the whitefish and avoid the walleye. Apparently it was becoming too difficult to do it this summer...not sure of the reason. Rather than fill the small walleye quota and then not be able to fish further (his whitefish caught in the winter bring him the highest prices) I was told he voluntarily pulled his nets. Contrary to your perseption I find that he is a very responsible individual. The point you bring in about the large northerns being thrown on the shore ""back in the day"" may be correct but I also know from talking to old time guides on Eagle was that the big norherns they caught were also clubbed over the head and left to float as well. A final point is that the whitefish harvest is a viable business in the area, much like some of the tourist busnesses, and does support the local economy. This person also lives year round here, unlike some camp people who reside in the U.S. Ask yourself who is doing more damage....the fellow bringing bus-loads up, or a few hundred walleye that are harvested in a different manner. By the way, the walleye fishery on Eagle continues to improve each year regardless......"
568815,Guest,2007-09-07 13:26:00,0,"Hi. I know everyone is entitled to an opinion and here is mine. those americans you speak of probably spend or leave at least $1000.00 of their money in canada. how many bus loads does the camp operator bring up, maybe 20 bus loads and how many on a bus maybe 20? thats 400 people leaving behind at $400,000 for the 3 months they are there. Its probably even more than that. so for the sake of providing some netted fish that might be worth a couple thousand the netter is ruining what could be a gold mine for bring in more tourist. another government site that shows the numbers for tourist show it declining shows that, as much as you dont want to accept the fact, americans coming to canada around eagle lake dont come up and spend all that money to be disappointed when they dont catch any fish. I am not coming up any more just for that reason. so you are not getting my 2 or 3 grand anymore. keep netting the fish and see what happens to your economy. Multiply that by the tens of thousands that finally figure it out that they are getting screwed while the netters get rewarded. you folks can choke on your fish."
568819,Skylane,2007-09-07 16:59:00,101,"Gosh Gord, sounds like catching a few white fish is going to kill the local economy. It also sounds like that joker is one of those guys who would like to fill his freezer up with walleye to take home. Who needs a big walleye limit? What is wrong with catch and release and just taking enough for a meal. I wonder why some of the lakes did get fished down."
568824,v-bay gord,2007-09-07 20:33:00,3168,"alanexpup.......I was trying to point out that there is always two sides to every story and to paint the commercial fisher as the source of all problems is very simplistic. Your beef seems to be with the ""ridiculous limits"" and that kind of says it all, in my opinion."
568837,Guest,2007-09-08 13:11:00,0,"I dont know who is to blame but I have been to a lot lakes in ontario and at each one when talking at length with an ""old timer"" from that lake they would tell of just going around the corner just minutes away from the lodge to catch all the fish they wanted. when I was going there I would have to go many many miles and ride for an hour or more to get to where the fish were. In those same lakes I would run accross long nets strung with half inch blue nylon cable and upon inspection could see it literally filled with big dead fish that were rotting where they got caught in their gills. when I was a kid going up with my parents to almost the last year i went up to canada we found these abandoned nets. I cannot just forget what I saw and probably a lot of other people saw. you cannot blame the sportsman that come up for a week of fishing for the decline of fish when nets are used to fish by the tons."
568838,Northpoint,2007-09-08 15:40:00,38,Is netting allowed in other lakes as well?
568852,Northpoint,2007-09-09 13:37:00,38,"Is netting of whitefish allowed on Lac Suel or Gullrock? If so, does this also allow for some accidental harvest of walleye as it apparently does on Eagle Lake? Are tribal members also allowed to net? Thanks"
568857,Guest,2007-09-09 17:57:00,0,there are no commercial fishermen on gullrock and not enough whitefish to make it worth while to try and commercial fish.
568883,Trailerguy,2007-09-11 20:21:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'm guessing the native fishery person lives right on the lake, down the road from Eagle River. I've bought whitefish from him in the past, he's a very resposible person with a good reputation in the community. He also nets whitefish on Cedar Lake. Some years back the Mnr was getting complains from the public about him netting too many Walleyes on Cedar. He hired one of their fish survey people to help run the nets, (which I might add is hard Physical labor). The results was that the % of non targeted fish was very small, and the MNR went away with egg on their faces. In my opinon posts about netting are very sensational, and usually very one sided hogwash that don't any FACTS to suport them. If he wanted to net whitefish on Wabby, he'd have my blessing. Unfortunatly he's near retirement age and not a lot of the younger generations are willing to work that hard to make a living. Working the government is a lot easier! Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

568840,v-bay gord,2007-09-08 16:49:00,3168,"alanexpup.........I agree that things might have changed from the way things used to be but don't confuse the issue of one commercial whitefish fisherman on Eagle Lake to the tales of abandoned nets and rotting fish....that simply does not occur on Eagle. By the way the Americans I referred to in my initial reply referred to the camp-owners, not their guests. northpoint.....there are other lakes with some commercial activities. Lac Suel, for example, has at least one commercial whitefish fisherman. Most of the commercial walleye fishing happens on Lakes Winnipeg & Manitoba in that province."
568841,phishfearme,2007-09-09 04:48:00,1242,"commercial netting is permitted on many of the larger lakes and netting for personal consumption by the native peoples occurs on lots of lakes. at lake st. joseph, you can buy as many walleye fillets as you want for $5 a pound and legally (with the receipt) bring them back to the states (with your daily limit of walleye). probably ALOT cheaper this way if what you really want is meat. phish"
