About 2 miles out in the bay is a pile of rocks sticking out of the water(Robinson's Rock). Go to East of this a few hundred yards, and watch your depth finder. You can see the river channel that runs all the way through the bay. You'll be in 11-12 feet of water, and you will see it drop off to 20 some feet of water. Anchore on the drop off and jig. Or a lot of people pull crankbaits over the large flat areas of 10-12 feet. Both can be really good."

Lund pretty much summed it up. anchor and jig or pull cranks. cranks that have worked well for us in the past are: shad raps, deep jr's, & #5 salmo hornets last year worked real well. if nothing is going at pine trailer to the red and fish it."
568848,Guest,2007-09-09 11:47:00,0,Thanks for the info. What type of bait are you guys jigging with. I have heard of people bringing in frozen shiners.
