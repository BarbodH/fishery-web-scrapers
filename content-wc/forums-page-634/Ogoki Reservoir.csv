For a change we are looking into one of the outpost cabins on the Ogoki Reservoir and my question to you is, knowing there are many camps on the reservoir, are we going to be fishing along side other boats most of the time? This would totally be new to us as we are not use to seeing anyone else on our lakes? I know it is big water but what can we expect? ."

In '06 we saw only boats from our camp (MLO) and that was infrequent. It isn't exactly like a single cabin lake, but you will have plenty of room to fish without fighting other boats for spots."

"" It's been four or five years since I was last there, but other than the MLO camp, I saw only one other uninhabited cabin on the lake the entire week we were there. That's one huge reservoir with plenty of room. Other boats should not be a concern. Wonderful scenery, great fishery, you'll enjoy the time there."

The best part about it was, we caught lots of fish and the hosts MLO were A+"
