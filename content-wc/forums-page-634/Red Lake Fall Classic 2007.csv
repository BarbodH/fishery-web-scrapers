Anyways caught tail hookin chubs, worked very well for us ,crawlers and leeches were getting smaller fish but not the ones we wanted.Fished goshhawk lake tournament this pat weekend wow caught the most walleye iver ever caught in one day when your cullin and balance beamin 26 inchers u know it good lol.Was my first time there. Take care"

568778,Guest,2007-09-05 19:48:00,0,"Mista W was impressed with the multitude of large Walleye being caught during the pre-fish and during the tournament. All I can say is it was <AMAZING>... My only regret was having trouble finding the slot fish just under 18 inches...I've never caught so many big fish in Red Lake. The Tourney was a success...Saturday was warm and we had a small walleye chop coming from the south.. Sunday the winds from the north pushed the little boats into hiding. Monsoon waves took there tole on the hardiest angler which proved to be a challenge. My partner and I were happy to finish in the top 40. Next year we'll be working on our slots. The highlight of my weekend was Mr.Walleye(Gary Roach) gave me a pat on the back and said nice weight for the weekend while I was weighing my fish. Mr. Walleye gave us a few tips as we were bumping and grinding for position on his favorite reef. He is truly a legend.

I'd like to fish that sometime, Red has always been a favorite lake for me and I hear good things about how the tournament is run. I wouldn't be ashamed to finish in the top 40, congrats to you too.
