568809,Bill Krejca,2007-09-07 10:49:00,6107,All right! Got any idea of the present surface temp in Sabaskong?
568811,stevensinks,2007-09-07 11:43:00,330,You bet I would. I can catch walleye at home and I love to fish for pike.
568860,Guest,2007-09-10 06:02:00,0,"Not only would I, I essentially did a month ago. While the main lake we were on was not totally devoid of walleye, the portage lake was the known killer. We caught a half a dozen on the main lake first afternnoon and fished the rest of the time on portage lake (25 to 30 a day averaging about 20 inches -- mostly 17 to 24). Always packed a lunch and were away from the cabin from 8:00 to 5:00, but well worth it."

568881,Guest,2007-09-11 16:06:00,0,"I would go, the worst thing that could happen is you get skunked. But, you'd still be fishing. Catching my largest northern is one of the best experiences of my life. So was releasing it. I had my dad there to video tape it too. My brother and I were with him when he caught his largest. It bent the net in half landing it. We will never forget those days. Are you picking this trip over another which has Walleye? Or is there no option but this trip?"

568950,Guest,2007-09-13 10:23:00,0,"Yep, I would go. It's not all about the fish. The time away, the quiet, the friends, the scenery, the wildlife. Had some dry days in Canada, and many more in Wisconsin. Wouldn't trade 'em. Bring along some steaks, shrimp, chips, beer and cocktails and enjoy yourself! b6"
568768,Guest,2007-09-05 13:57:00,0,Would you go on a trip to Canada for a week if there were no wallleyes in the lake? I'll have the opportunity to catch some on some portage lakes but the main lake only has northern and trout. thanks lazy eye
568769,Guest,2007-09-05 14:00:00,0,"Yes, I would go. Unfortunately, the management at work would frown on it because all my vacation time is used up. There would be a certain amount of friction when I came back. You didn't mention if this week was reasonably priced."
568771,Guest,2007-09-05 14:43:00,0,"Free trip to an empty lake? hmmm, probably. Its a week out of work and week of peace and quiet."
568773,Guest,2007-09-05 16:20:00,0,no. i don't think so.
568774,dollure,2007-09-05 16:24:00,71,In the fall you could get into some nice lake trout and northern fishing. In the fall-I'd go! dollure
568775,AllenW,2007-09-05 16:42:00,11482,"If walleys are just a reasonably short portage away, sounds like a great trip, Trout and Northerns get big enough to make some nice pictures and memories, plus if its walleyes ya want for eating they are close enough to get to. Either way, take the trip, better to take it than not, and wonder what ya missed or not get the chance again. Al"
568776,Guest,2007-09-05 18:08:00,0,"I have a cottage at Minaki ONT, ( unreal fishing already ) and live in CDN. Give me a chance to catch I assume large pike and trout I would jump all over it. Pike caught in the fall and are under 5 pounds are almost as good as walleye. ( most people cannot tell the difference ) Not knowing on where your going, but lakers can get large and they do put up a good fight. Myself I am a walleye fisher man but #2 is laker then pike. Just remeber in the the fall up in CDN the weather can be real ****ty and cold, and at these times it takes a true guy who loves fishing. But also no bugs in the fall, and if you play your card right get a moose tag."
568779,Guest,2007-09-05 21:03:00,0,What's the lake? Pringle?
568781,Guest,2007-09-06 06:16:00,0,No lakers in the Pringle lake I've fished with MLO.
568804,rpieske,2007-09-07 07:26:00,1276,Overnight lows next week in the 20's so pack warm.
