568627,Habitual Eyer,2007-08-27 13:35:00,144,"Gullrock is on fire right now. I fished it the last two weeks. Just got home Sunday morning. Surface temp dropped 10 deg in the last couple weeks. Jig/minnow bite for sure! Big fish are becoming more active and moving onto fish-able structure. Fished last Thursday, released twenty fish over 22"" including a 28""er. That number does not even include the 15/16/17 inchers we caught all day long. Middle lake structure off the deep water was key for us(for size). Almost all shoreline structure should hold big fish a week from now. PM me if you need more info. Steven"

568859,the_bronco,2007-09-09 19:36:00,86,"Macwurst, ( or anyone else who might know ) I have been fishing Gullrock for a few years now but I am not familiar with Franks Island. Could you tell me where it is located? I have looked at every map that I have and cannot find it anywhere. Also, if you know of any other not so commonly known named islands, points, etc... I would be appreciative to know their names and locations. Thank you, Jim P.S. If you would rather send private email: [email protected]"
