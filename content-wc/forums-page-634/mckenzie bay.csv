There was a few spots through the last narrows that you have to watch for. Other than that, it's pretty easy. As far as how long of run, we went out of Timberlane back in the river and it took us a little over 40 minutes. If Scout Bay is where I remember it being you could probably take 5-10 minutes off of that. As far as where to go, there are a lot of good spots out there. Mid-lake humps, wind-blown shorelines. There is a good potential for a lot of fish. Sizewize, we tended to get a lot of slots, but nothing much bigger than 22"". I'm sure they are in there somewhere though. Good Luck"

All my keeper northerns came from Scout lake area. For walleyes>Mckenzie bay is very good fishing but @ SLR you would probally have just as good of luck in the Bay of Islands or around Manatoba point area. My biggest walleye (27 1/2"") came from the mouth area of where Scout lake meets Lac suel/bay of islands. On Sat fished the east side of an islamd within eyeshot of Manatoba point and killed em pulling spinner rigs in 16-24' of water. Water temps ranged from 66-62 degrees. Did very well on reefs and mid lake humps. Enjoy and have a safe trip."
