568594,stevensinks,2007-08-24 11:47:00,330,Thank you for all of the suggestions. I am checking each of them out. The nice thing about starting my search this early is I have time to look. If anyone has other suggestions please let me know.
568595,AllenW,2007-08-24 13:03:00,11482,"http://www.chukunirivercampground.com/ Might be a bit rustic, but if your camping they have elect and water outlets, also some RV's that they rent. Red lake is a great place to go as the lake is nothing but structure and the owners can point ya towards spots that are hitting. Another big plus is the camp is on the river, which makes life much easier when the winds are up and your docking or loading, plus you can catch a lot of walleyes or northerns on the river when the weather is foul. Also other lakes can be gotten to by boat from there. Al"

568342,stevensinks,2007-08-14 09:46:00,330,"Next year my wife would like to go north with me agine. She really isnt into a lot of fishing but she does like to go out a few times each trip. She really loves Canada and likes to spend alot of her time there sitting outside reading, drawing, painting, playing her flute and exploring. We do not want to go to a large camp and a fly in is out. If any of you have suggestions for a cabin or small camp please let me know. Thanks Charlie"

568420,Guest,2007-08-16 13:20:00,0,You could try Wine Lake Camp but the only down fall is it is a 25 mile boat in camp. You can look at it on www.winelakecamp.com. Scott
568421,Guest,2007-08-16 13:35:00,0,"I haven't gone to any of the following resorts but I am considering them: www.routelakelodge.com This resort is north of Dryden, housekeeping or American Plan and you can do Housekeeping and arrange for some meal(s) on the American Plan. I believe it is a short boat in, the only lodge on the lake. Also: www.wenasaga.com This housekeeping resort is a few miles north of Ear Falls. I believe this is a drive in housekeeping resort and is the only one on the lake. I like boat in lodges because the fishing is generally better than the drive to but is not as costly as flyin fishing. However for a nonfisherperson, a drive to resort allows for a drive to town, etc. Good luck"
