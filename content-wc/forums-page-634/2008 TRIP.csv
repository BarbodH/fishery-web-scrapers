568714,Guest,2007-08-30 15:05:00,0,"WE did good this year..went up the 2nd week in June..had big numbers of walleyes as usual..no super trophy fish in our group though with the biggest being 26""..but everyone was cathing them in the 20-22"" range so we were happy..what suprised us this year were the huge smallies..several were boated in our group just under 20""...never saw that up there before..one of our guys stayed up there for the muskie opener and caught a 54"" Al and Kim have always been great to us..they have really invested a lot in the camp as far as ugrades to the cabins, boats and motors..they added 4 16ft lunds this year with 30hp Yamahas..me and my partner were able to grab one of them..it was sweet.."

568672,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-08-29 09:15:00,110,"It is not to soon to start planning your trip for 2008. Many of the prime times have already been spoken for. Many times the outfitter or resort gives preference for time in '08 to whomever was there at that time in '07. Even with the soft economy, high gas prices and the near even exchange rate the prime times fill wuickly.:fishhit:"

568675,Guest,2007-08-29 10:10:00,0,The majority of Resorts on good fishing lakes will be filling up with those of us who book them every year. Our group has gone the same place for the last 17 years and we see a lot of the same groups in camp every year at the same time. However since there are some times avaliable at these quality fishing camps you need to get your name in the hat EARLY. I would suggest that you contact the resort owner no later than November 1st to get your name on the list. The majority of resort owners will have a list of perspective groups that could fill spots that have been cancelled and they will call you. So be the name on the top of the list.
