Nothing against Lac Suel, we will definitly fall back to our yearly trip after this one. We've picked it due to the quality of fish and not on accomadation. Anybody been here and care to give a review?http://www.nwtfishing.com/ Thanks, Jay"

568557,Guest,2007-08-22 08:12:00,0,Was there 2 years ago in July and it is a awesome experience. Kind of pricey but it is a once in a lifetime trip on my budget. We took a 5 day trip and the whole trip cost a little over 5K. We caught a lot of 20lb and bigger Pike and Lake Trout.
568656,Atlanta Dave,2007-08-28 12:38:00,323,We have a 9 day trip set up for next July . Have never been but talked to a guy at another place we go and he got a 30lb pike. We have the 2nd 9 day period he has next year. From my experiences at Lake Athabasca the earlier you get there the better the pike fishing.We have gone to Athabasca for the last 8 years and always get the first or second week they are open. The early weeks the water is still cold and the pike are stacked up in the bays as the water warms they disperse and are a little harder to find. Atlanta Dave
