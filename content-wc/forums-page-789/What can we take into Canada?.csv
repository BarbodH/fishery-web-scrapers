543236,Guest,2004-09-09 11:55:00,0,We are heading to northern Saskathewan in a couple of weeks and we are planning on taking food with us to the resort we are going to stay at. Is there any restriction in bring certain kinds of food (beef or meat etc.) across the boarder. We will be crossing south of Winnepeg. Thanks for all your help.
