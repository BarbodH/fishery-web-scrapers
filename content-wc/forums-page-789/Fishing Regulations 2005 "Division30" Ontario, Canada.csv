543170,Guest,2004-09-04 08:33:00,0,Off the subject of the fishing regs can anyone tell me the status of the Canadian Coast Guard proposed regulations that anyone operating a boat in Canadian waters will have to be certified and have an operators license much the same as the PAL for firearms?

At the present a guest renting a camp boat is required to have a boaters check list sheet signed by camp and the operator of the boat on him at all times. It only takes about 5 min and includes a quick go over on safety, navagational rules etc. If you bringing your own boat no problem."

543193,Guest,2004-09-07 11:34:00,0,"JP I am with you on that piont. August this year I was in distress out on the big portion of Minnitaki lake in 40kph wind. My 2003 ""Bombardier"" built Evinrude would not start on my 22.5ft Lund Baron Magnium boat. I was headed for certain, to crash into the rocky shore line of an island. Apparently just obtaining the PAL does not mean they know ""Boat in distress"" signals as they just kept on going. It was an American registered boat that did, and came to my rescue. Thank you to the 2 men from Minnisota."
