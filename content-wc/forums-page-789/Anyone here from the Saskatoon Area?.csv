541465,Guest,2004-07-06 13:10:00,0,"Just wondering if any of you can comment on the fishing opportunities in and around the Saskatoon area? I am considering moving out that way from BC and as crazy as it may sound (well maybe not considering the board I'm on), the fishing opportunities may impact my decision. I mainly fish Rainbows and Lake Trout out here and I'm trying to get a handle on what type of fishing is available around Saskatoon. I gather there is lots of Walleye and Pike, but what about Lake Trout? How far do you have to travel to get into them? Driving four hours for a roundtrip is no big deal to me. I am willing to travel. I'd like to try out Walleye and Pike but at the same time, I'm not sure I could give up on easy access to the Lakers. How far North is it before the ""real"" fishing for Lakers starts and also, how far from Saskatoon do you have to travel before getting into the good Walleye and Pike fishing? Thanks for any information you can share."

Lakers..check on the map, but anywhere near and north of LaRonge....Saskatoon to Prince Albert, then North to LaRonge....great fishing anywhere around there...lots of great spots for Walleye around Saskatoon, and Pike is awesome up North and on Tobin Lake. Good Luck!"
541495,Guest,2004-07-06 23:19:00,0,"Thanks for the response SaskLund. It looks like the Lakers are a little further North than I had thought, but still well within ""striking distance"" so to speak :) Thanks for the info about Lake Diefenbaker, I had actually heard some things about that piece of water before. It sounds as though I'd have no problem adapting to the fishing out in Saskatchewn. Thanks again!"
541504,Guest,2004-07-07 12:29:00,0,"Unfortunately, Lake Trout in Central regions of Saskatchewan is a declining fishery due to localized habitat, in my opinion. What I mean of localized habitat is that the Lakers are relatively restricted to well known waters thus, are easily found because these waters really don't cover that much area. In fact, some lakes like Lac la Ronge have new limits in place to restrict the amount of Lake Trout that you can keep or even catch over a season. Regardless, these are a few of the lakes north of Saskatoon that I know about where you can drive to: Little Bear Lake - About a 3 hour trip NE from Saskatoon. Not sure how well the Lakers are doing here, but this lake is suppose to support them. East Trout Lake - 3 hour trip NE. Like Little Bear, I'm not too sure how well the fishing is here either. Lac la Ronge - 4 hour drive north of Saskatoon, plus an hour boat ride to Hunter Bay where you'll find the best fishing for Lakers. Pickerel Bay, located within Hunter Bay, has excellent early season Walleye fishing as well. Nemeiben Lake - 20 min. drive NW of La Ronge. I know the Walleye fishing has gone downhill here because of commercial fishing, but I'm not sure it has affected the Lake Trout population as well. Hope this helps in your decision."
541505,Guest,2004-07-07 12:39:00,0,"Thanks for that info Napatak, it does help. Are those lakes you speak of larger bodies of water? The lakes around here I'm used to fishing for Lakers are anywhere from 8-40+ miles long and fairly deep (well over 200 feet in most cases) and cold. They are pretty narrow mind you as they usually sit in mountain valleys. As with anywhere, I suspect you have to put in time exploring to find the jems. That is all part of the fun mind you!"
541576,Northern Manitoban,2004-07-11 00:09:00,195,Throw me an email or post on my site there is allot of world class Lake trout and rainbow fishing that you can drive to in Nortwestern Manitoba and worth the trip you mentioned driving wasn't a problem you would be looking at 4 to 6 hours.I have friends in Saskatoon that come with me to fish these lakes every year.NMhttp://www.xtremesportfishing.com
543038,Guest,2004-08-28 17:59:00,0,"I'm from North Battleford and every june we go fishing at Lac LaPlonge for Lakers. It is about 3 hours north of here by Beauval. We have always done well there. In the past two years I have seen two fish over 20lbs caught and we have caught many other ""nice"" ones. The fish are still shallow - 25-40 feet - in June but are easily caught with downriggers later in summer. When the lake gets too rough the Beaver River is only a few minutes away. One evening two years ago, my brother and I released 165 walleye. The fish never stopped biting until we ran out of crawlers! I hope you enjoy it out here. I do!!"
543042,Matches,2004-08-28 21:01:00,236,"BC Fisherman, Fishing Opportunities?? The first question on this board should have been: Is it legal to drink beer in the boat in the Saskatoon Area?"
543045,JohnAB,2004-08-29 08:44:00,49,"Hello 32incheye, See you are from North Battleford. My old stomping grounds. Parents still have a cabin at Murray Lake. So sad about the water level there. Was there in July and man the water is low, mind you it is a lot higher than it was in 2002 when I was last there. Was surprised that the walleye fishing is still hanging on there. Guy down the beach caught a 5 lber while I was there. We caught a few, nothing real spectacular but none the less still fun. Buddy still seems to do alright on larger pike there as well. Do you know how the lakers are doing in I believe Pierce Lake in Meadow Lake Park? Buddy out ehre was asking me as he is heading over that way later in September. He was at Lac Des Isles in July, said the walleye bite was slow."
543049,Guest,2004-08-29 09:44:00,0,"I haven't heard how fishing is at Pierce Lake. I have heard of big pike being caught at Waterhen recently. I hope to make it up there or to Keeley before the snow flies. The way the weather has been this summer, that day may be soon."
