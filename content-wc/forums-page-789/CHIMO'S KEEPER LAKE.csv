522608,Guest,2002-08-15 06:55:00,0,I have never fished optic lake before but I have been to several of Viking Outpost lakes. I have found almost all to be excellant fishing lakes. Viking is very accomadating and try to have everything you need.Robby
543256,Guest,2004-09-10 14:54:00,0,"Dave, This is Robby. We went to Bearberry last year (2003) we came in when you went out I think. You had said in a previous post that you had been to Hornby and liked it. We are considering going to Hornby next year with eight guys. Is there enough room in the cabin for eight? Any comment would be appreciated. Thanks, Robby"

522599,Dave,2002-07-22 08:37:00,258,"Robby:We've fished other Chimo outposts, but not Keeper. Word is lots of small to medium size walleyeat Keeper. I know Nestor Falls Fly-in(Dave b.) also has a camp on the Keeper River. Good luck."
522600,Guest,2002-08-08 12:17:00,0,"DAVE I JUST SAW YOUR REPLY TO MY QUESTION. WHEN YOU SAY SMALL TO MEDIUM ARE YOU TALKING 16"" TO 19"" WALLEYES OR SMALLER?ALSO, WHAT OTHER CHIMO LAKES HAVE YOU FISHED.THANKS,ROBBY"
522601,Dave,2002-08-11 10:44:00,258,"Robby:I was told lots of 14""-16' walleye at Keeper. I've fished Chimo's Roderick base camp, Hornby and Warwick (Bearberry). Once we got a taste of an outpost cabin and having on one else around, that is the ony way we will go. Hornby & Bearberry are C & R, no take home fish. Good luck,Dave"
522602,Guest,2002-08-12 13:30:00,0,"Dave,How was Bearberry? It looks very good and I am considering that lake next year.Robby"
522603,Dave,2002-08-13 05:03:00,258,"Robby:I'll have to get back to you next month as we are going to Bearberry after Labor Day. We were there in '97 & '98 and did OK. Some 27"" but not as many 20""+ walleye as Hornby. How did you find Chimo? My group is from the Chicago area.Dave"
522604,Guest,2002-08-13 05:59:00,0,"We are from Ottawa, Ill. southwest of Chicago and we have been going to Canada for about 12 years. We have gone through Viking several times and I have gone through Canadian Fly-In fishing a couple of times. Several guys here in Ottawa have been going to Chimo's Roderick Lake for years and told us about them but this is our first trip through Peter. We always go to outpost lakes we picked Keeper because it had a larger cabin we have nine guys going.Thanks,Robby"
522605,Dave,2002-08-14 05:48:00,258,"Robby:Small world, I live in New Lenox. When are you going into Keeper? If your party gets down to six or less I would highly recommend Hornby. Beautiful scenery and plenty of walleye if the wind is blowing. Good luck.Dave"
