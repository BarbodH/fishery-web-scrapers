We intended to fish Minnitaki and Abrams during our stay, but the fishing was really tough in those lakes and only fished two full days. Caught a lot of small fish but nothing of any size. Probably not the lakes fault, but never did get on them. Started putting in at Deception boat ramp and went into Lac Seul over near The Rags and Devils Elbow area. Caught probably 15-18 big fish with the largest being 25 1/2"". Hear of bigger fish being caught, but just catching nice fish was worth the 14 mile run we made. So...Tuesday through Friday we were on Lac Seul. Had to move around quite abit but when you found the fish they were pretty easy to catch. Minnows on a jig seemed to work the best. We jig trolled, vertical jigged, casted on slow retrieve, etc. Never tried cranks but once with no success. Even put a minnow on a crawler harness and caught fish. Made up a bunch of harnesses for the trip, but wasn't getting any good reports on crawlers, so didn't buy any. The weather was real unstable the fish few days we were there which could of contributed to our low success on Minnitaki. Friday was our best day and the weather had been real good since Tuesday, so stable weather with sunshine sure did help. Made the fishing more enjoyable also. Fish seemed to be anywhere from 18 to 38 feet deep. Occasionally caught them even shallower. The trip started slow, but ended very good. Didn't want to leave when the time came."
543201,Guest,2004-09-07 21:25:00,0,What was the water temp up there?
543209,Guest,2004-09-08 07:13:00,0,"When we arrived the temp was anywhere from 62 to 64. The last day we fished it was 67. But we had four really nice days in a row. Tues-Fri. with each day getting a bit warmer. Actually, Friday the outside temp. was close to 80 degrees. Stable weather and warmer temps sure improved the fishing."
