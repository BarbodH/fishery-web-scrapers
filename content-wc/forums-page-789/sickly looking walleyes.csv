Muscle Necrosis The loss of muscle seen often in the walleye appears different from starving fish. Some researchers suggested this disease is a result of injury associated with gill netting while others strongly dispute this theory. Human Safety: Fish in this state are unsuitable for human consumption as the disease affects the texture and taste if the muscle. Muscle Atrophy Muscle atrophy (or muscle wasting) is reported in waterbodies of Saskatchewan and other provinces. Muscle loss is seen in fish with disease of the pancreas or in starved animals and appears to be compounded by cold water temperature. The condition can be reproduced in the lab by feeding the fish a diet low in Vitamin E and selenium. Human Safety: Fish in this state are unsuitable for human consumption as the disease affects the texture and taste of the muscle."

It looked healthy and took a nice picture, but it just seemed that most of the longer fish this year were thinner than normal years. I was told they just had their 3rd mayfly hatch, which is very unusual. My first thought was that the fish gorge themselves on the mayfly larve and it may not fatten them up like their normal food supply does. I going again September 17th and will hopefully find out that they have fattened up for the winter."

They were pale looking and also looked underfed one was released a 27"" and one was cleaned. The one cleaned hardly any meat on it and the meat seemed mushy so it was thrown away. Has anyone else come across this and if so what is wrong with these fish? I have a photo but I'm not sure how to attach it to this post!"
543104,fish4fun,2004-08-31 12:22:00,14,"We were at Minnitaki 2 weeks ago. We also noticed the same thing. Most, not all, fish seemed to have less meat to them than usual. We didn't have to throw any way due to poor meat quality, but the stomachs were nearly empty and they seemed to be feeding less than normal. We saw plenty of baitfish schools on the LCR screens. There was a mayfly hatch while we were there, quite uncommon this late according to the resort owner. He also thinks nearly the entire year class of walleye, northern and smallmouth was lost due to the weather conditions. Strange year."

543138,fish4fun,2004-09-02 09:50:00,14,"No, we didn't see any growths on any of the fish we caught. What kind of virus could cause this, and how infectious is it?"
543148,Guest,2004-09-02 14:23:00,0,just a little one I think I could send you a pic of it.
543159,Guest,2004-09-03 07:54:00,0,">Could be a virus. Did you notice any growths on them? No growths, sores, scabs etc. were visible on our walleye from 2003 either. Coloration was normal."
543160,bigfish1965,2004-09-03 08:23:00,3210,"I was reading up more on Lymphocystis, thinking that the internal variety of this virus could cause it, but the documentation lists this occurence as 'very rare' so I doubt that was it. Could just be starvation, I suppose."
543161,fish4fun,2004-09-03 09:50:00,14,"The thin walleyes we caught were always larger fish. There seemed to be plenty of minnows in the water and baitfish on the LCR screen. The smaller walleyes we caught were normal sized. I wonder if it could have something to do with re-absorbing their eggs and the poor weather during spawning, if the resort owner was correct and they didn't spawn normally?"
543166,Guest,2004-09-03 13:27:00,0,fish4fun were you the guy that helped me free my finger from my transomesaver when loading up my boat at Pickeral Arm? If you were many thanks again I got lucky on that one finger is still a little bit numb on the end and sides.
