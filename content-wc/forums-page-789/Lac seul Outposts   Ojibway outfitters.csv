543143,Guest,2004-09-02 13:01:00,0,"I have made over two dozen trips to Ojibway and can attest to the fact that it is a top notch outfit. Great cabins, remote location, only lodge for 30 miles other than occasional outpost cabin. Located in the heart of great fishing. Word of advice, follow the rules as camp owner tolerates no crap, however is fair."
