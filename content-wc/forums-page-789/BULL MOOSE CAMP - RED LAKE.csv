But I loved it then, a real walleye factory. The old operators sold it to their son, and I don't know how he is doing. But the parents believed in service, really, really clean camp. Board walks all over to the biffys, Hans would clean out the boats every night, and his wife Anna would give everyone instructions on how to do the garbage. Cans, burnable and ""compost"" garbage bags. Woe to you if you messed up. I would love to go back. Give it a shot, we always had great fishing there and super hospitality and service. Let me know how it is if you ever go."
