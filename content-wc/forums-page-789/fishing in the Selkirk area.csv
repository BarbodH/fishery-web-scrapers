543177,luvs2fish2,2004-09-05 16:39:00,16,I'm headed to the Selkirk area soon and would like to know how the Red River is?? I've heard reports that the last couple of years have been tough especially with the water level in the river. thanks in advance
543178,Northern Manitoban,2004-09-06 02:19:00,195,"You are correct that it has been slow the last few years.Water levels are way up and lots of baitfish are in ther system and some Greenbacks are being caught but small ones.How soon are you going I would really wait see how the bite is before I would commit,I would guess end of September and early October is your best bet.I know for myself I'm not going to hit the Red until I hear its non stop action,I have a great walleye run up north where i'am so it will have to be very good on the Red before i pull up anchor and move.Good luck though.NMhttp://www.xtremesportfishing.com"
543195,Guest,2004-09-07 14:54:00,0,"I would have to agree that fishing has been slower the past few years. In my opinion it still is the best place to go to have a chance at a big greenback. Even though it has slowed down, our group has always put at least 10 fish over 8 lbs in the boat. In fact the last few years we went to Traverse Bay around Sept 20 and it was nothing but good. We didn't catch numbers of fish, but the 7-10 we caught each day were good sized fish. In my opinion I would fish traverse bay by Pine Falls. I think there is to much luck in hitting the Red on the right day at the right time. You need the water to be high and the wind to be blowing in. At traverse bay, those big walleyes will be staging outside ready to go in the river system, or on their way in. This way you don't have to hit it perfectly. Yes, Traverse is a large body of water and it does get rough, but on those days get in side the winnepeg River and you will also catch fish there. We have our best luck jigging in the mornings, and in the afternoon pull'n those Shad Raps searching for walleyes, and towards dark switching over to jigs. I won't guarantee tons of fish, but I almost guarantee a few big ones if you stick at it, and switch up your aproach."

543203,Guest,2004-09-07 22:46:00,0,"I'm from Aberdeen, South Dakota, where are you from?"
543204,Northern Manitoban,2004-09-07 23:45:00,195,"Good advice there Wallyone.For me,catching one or two 8 to 10 pound Greenbacks beats catching 20+ smaller fish.Heard many good things about Travers bay but its a busy place.NMhttp://xtremesportfishing.com"
543226,Guest,2004-09-08 20:41:00,0,I live in Sioux Falls right now. Im going to school there. Three of my buddies and I will be going to Pine falls at the end of September.
543227,Guest,2004-09-08 20:45:00,0,Why do you say Travers it is a busy place? When I was there last year in October there were not more than 30 boats out there. That is not much fishing pressure concidering the size of Travers Bay.
543229,gms,2004-09-08 22:21:00,91,"You are most correct, due to the poor yields last year there were many times I was out there last year and you were lucky to see 30 boats....but I have seen it in its hey days and I've counted well over 50 boats out on the ""flats"". As I noted in another post.....it is like a boat ""ballet"" out there when things are happening. gms"
543233,Guest,2004-09-09 10:19:00,0,"I was out at Pine Falls last year around Oct 24, and their was maybe 20 boats in the entire bay,I expected like 100 out there. I havn't fished up there that much, but I thought the fishing was good. Our boat only caught like 5-10 fish a day, but they were all pritty nice. We fished by a boat that has fished there for a few years, and they caught a 8+ walleye every day. To me thats pritty good, but like I said I don't know if like 7 years ago you caught a lot more fish, but If your fishing for 3 days and you catch one walleye over 8 lbs thats good to me. Going up agian this year at the end of Sept. Just seeing if anyone has any tips or info they could share with me on fishing traverse/winnepeg River since I just started fishing this large area. Thanks in advance for any info you can give."
