543260,Guest,2004-09-10 20:08:00,0,"Today I called my buddy who lives up at Pine Falls. He said the greenbacks are up in small numbers. He was out today and caught 13 walleyes. He was on the water for about 5 hours. About 50% of his fish were greenbacks, the other 50% were river fish. The largest were in the 16""-17"" range. This is normal for the beginning of the fall season....the males proceed the females up the river. He spoke with a few boats who were out on the lake and they didn't have any success. He caught some of his fish up by the dam, some by the mud bank, some at treaty point. Hopefully this is a sign of good things to come!"

A few 27"" to 30"" being caught out near the lake and an assortment of nice river walleye and smaller lake run walleye up farther into the Red. A mixed bag of sauger, lots of then in this fall. With the new flows from the heavy rains the big cat bite is definitely on. Big fat ornery sumo Kitties and the numbers are very good. The inside poop is fresh Tullibee fished farther down river is the key, with keeping the baits fresh the big key. Frogs are working well too if you can locate them. Some good action has also been seen on shrimp and cut Goldeye right in the wash of the Lockport Dam. This has been a exceptional season for big cats on the lower Red and September tends to produce some of the biggest of the season as they feed up for winter. I agree with the abundant forage in the Red, lots of shiners in the river plus plenty of other tastily young vitals swimming about if the shiners move. All we need now is the right winds to get the temp right and pull the numbers in. It would not surprise me any to see/hear much more encouraging reports after this weekend and into the middle of next week. Tight lips and all ya see..Eh. The winds of fortune await....I guess?

543268,Backwater Eddy,2004-09-12 03:10:00,3871,"That should be a good window? It is kinda hard to say...Yup..that is it...because it really depends on the weather and the winds. The water temp is falling quickly already, lower 60's now in fact so it is getting closer by the day. Watch the weather reports and hope for the best. A few days of North winds blowing the big lake into the Red is always a good thing to see prior to a trip, in my opinion anyway. As things stand now, I am looking at the same approximate time frame to go North looking mainly for greenbacks on the Red. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
