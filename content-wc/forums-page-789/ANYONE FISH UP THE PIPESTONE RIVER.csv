542727,Guest,2004-08-19 06:41:00,0,Hello Fishfearme I see you are from Pa. that is a long haul up to that area. I know of lakes above Horseshoe from my maps and have heard stories of fellas going up thru the rapids when the water is down and also about a portage thru a swamp but have never experienced that fun. Iadave is one of the resident experts of the area. Fishseeker has written me a long letter about the area BUT I never rec. the letter. Our dau. also sent us a letter that never arrived. Still hoping the letter from Fishseeker arrives-look every day. The lake you are speaking of must be a fly in???? I am making plans to go back up in May 05. We make about 4-6 trips into Ontario as we are 200 miles south of the bridge mackinaw but only one trip to Pickle Lake area due to the distance. Hope to hear more from you concerning your experience in this area--not looking for private honey holes just enjoy others experiences from a beautiful area. Also FISHSEEKER when you are back on the net please try to resend your letter to me. [email protected] Also Iadave please share some of your elxperiences with us again. Take care len in michigan
542731,IaDave,2004-08-19 08:31:00,476,"I'm not really an expert. I have fished Horseshoe Lake once. I have heard many stories because one of my fishing buddies is related to Marv from Iowa. I'm sure you have run across Marv up there. He usually heads up in Mid May and camps until sometime in Mid July. He is probably one of the best outdoorsman I have met. I heard now he finally bought a camper, before it was tents. He used to camp on an island in Horseshoe Lake and I have had the chance to stay there for a few days with my fishing buddy who is related to him. Now he goes to Badeshaw (Mud) Lake which is about 40 miles from Pickle Lake. I have fished Mud Lake about 7 yrs ago and had decent luck at the mouth of the Otaskwin River. We boated up river to a twin falls and now I know Phish we weren't far from Bow Lake. I talked to Marv last winter at a boat show and he says Mud Lake is as good as Horseshoe Lake. Kapkechi Lake which is just west of Pickle Lake is also a lake that the locals go to. There is a boat ramp at the end of the gravel road that goes by the dump. We spent 7 days fishing the various lakes we could get to. Phish- Jerel let us stay at his base camp in one of the cabins for I think was $25.00 a day as it was in Sept. and there was nothing going on except for moose season which was starting the following week. This year I have gone on 2 fly-ins out of Pickle and it was 4-5 yrs since I have been there and now I realize how much I missed Ontario's last frontier."
542740,phishfearme,2004-08-19 11:20:00,1242,"len - yah, it's 1500 miles from PIT to pickle so we usually do 10 day trips. the lakes upstream from horseshoe are indeed fly-in cabins and are controlled by a very friendly native guy, charles wesley (website:http://www.wesleyoutposts.com/). they are just being opened for sport fishing and he's looking to build his clientel list. we've done a number of trips out of pickle including two, two week canoe trips down the albany river to petawanga lake and an excellent trip to bow lake - dave was there this year as well as to an upsteam lake - otoskwin lake. dave - it's great that you can do two world class trips a year - you da man! later, phish"
542741,IaDave,2004-08-19 11:27:00,476,I'm also broke again. This year I sold my boat to afford the 2 trips I guess now I will have to sell something else so I can go next year.
542810,Guest,2004-08-22 13:12:00,0,"This really brings back the memories for me. Had probably the most memorable trip/adventure of my life to Horseshoe in 1986. Made another trip in '88, but it wasn't the same. It was our second ever Canada trip and our first trip that was completely ""on our own"". In June of '86, five of us from 18-25 years old took off in a 1978 Suburban from central Wisconsin. We had two 15 gallon drums for gas, two old 14' aluminum boats, a 20 horse Chrysler outboard and a 12 horse Johnson that came to America with Columbus. We had two spare tires; one was bald and the cords showed through, and the other didn't fit the truck. We didn't care because man, we were going to Canada. We each threw $125 in the kitty and we had money when we got back. I think fuel was about $1.25 a gallon that summer. It was a thousand miles straight north of home. We only broke down once on the way when we blew a hose and overheated. It took us 27 hours to get there because we stopped and looked at every rock and tree on the way. We stopped and did cartwheels in the road just because we could. We drank gallons of coffee We took pictures of road signs and little creeks and each other making faces while we drove. We had enough food for an army in a plywood box that made about 10 trips. I don't know where the old ""food box"" is now, but I'd like to take a look inside at all the junk we filled it with. We camped and fished for a week. We caught literally thousands of walleyes. They were almost all dinks up to about 17"". At one time, I caught 50 walleyes on 50 casts on a plain leadhead jig and cigarette butt. We thought it was about the fishing in those days and we learned a lot about catching fish, but, when I look back, it was way more than catching fish. It was a real adventure for a bunch of redneck boys from Wisconsin. Like I told my buddy yesterday as we were flying in his plane back from his cottage on LOTW, we might as well have been Louis and Clark as far as we were concerned; we drove to the end of the road. We saw one other boat there the whole first week of June 1986. We talked about how the world could have ended and we wouldn't even know. It was pure bliss and pure exhileration. That trip carried a feeling I will never forget, but that, unfortunately, I will never get back. Now we have boats with two outboards, gps, fancy graphs...the whole nine yards. We pull our boats with $25 trucks that don't burn a quart of oil for each tank of gas. We catch fish that are way bigger than those dinks on Horseshoe. We get to Canada in 2.5 hours at 150 miles an hour. It's fun, but I doubt any trip will rival the one where five country boys became real explorers; at least in our minds. Encourage your kids to do this kind of stuff and, by all means, do it yourself even if you're broke. Heck, if you wait, you stand the chance to miss out on a memory like we have."
542814,phishfearme,2004-08-22 18:24:00,1242,"MB - whatta great story. you need to get a copy of ""canoeing with the cree"" by eric severide (the newscaster) who wrote about a canoe trip he and his ""older"" buddy (they were in their early 20' and this was abck in the 1930's) did from northern minnesota thru northern ontario. an incredible adventure. as for me - my most memorable adventure is a two week canoe trip down the albany river in 1991 starting from rat rapids (on the road just south of pickle lake) to miminiska lake. what an incredible adventure. we did another one 4 years after that but the first one is always the best. try to get that book - iknow you'll enjoy it. - phish"
543245,Guest,2004-09-09 15:51:00,0,lets here some more talk about the mighty Pipestone. FISHSEEKER are you out there????? back to the top. len in michigan
541886,Guest,2004-07-21 16:49:00,0,Was wondering if anyone fished up the Pipestone River into Horseshoe Lake during May of this year. This is located north of the village of Pickle Lake. We were up in June and had been up in May a couple years earlier. Found the fishing in May to be better pre-spawn. Not sure if it was just the year or time of year etc. It is a beautiful area. Also the water coming over the rapids was a lot lower this June than it was in May of 2002. We got there in 2002 just after a big late spring snow storm and the melt made for a lot of running water. len in michigan
542030,Guest,2004-07-26 07:18:00,0,"Len, I would love to talk to you about this area....I go there all the time...and I sued to live in Michigan I have many tales to tell...about Horseshoe and Windigo. Please email me at [email protected] Thanks, joe"

542645,Guest,2004-08-16 12:33:00,0,FISHSEEKER ON THE PIPESTONE Are you up on the Pipestone haven't heard from you/ We are just back from north of Terrace Bay where we fished a remote lake for trout and pike. We had to go in on quads and portage two lakes. The wife fell overboard while we were filming a catch and dropped the camera. It is a Sony digital camrecorder. The camera filled with water it dropped in the boat but the boat took on water when the wife went overboard. Will these cameras work after that--we have dried it out but nothing so far maybe the battery can't take the water. lenrays michigan
542646,phishfearme,2004-08-16 14:04:00,1242,"len - i had the displeasure of a similar event in salt water. after drying, the camera was history, the videotape played but then wiped out the heads on the playback machine. the technician told me that the salt was the cause of both problems. since you're in fresh water, you may be able to recover the tape - the camera though is debatable. by the way, we're booked at a lake on the pipestone river next year that's just upstream of horseshoe lake - above frog portage/rapids. you ever been that far upstream? we can't wait. - phish"
