543238,Mike Kansas,2004-09-09 12:11:00,1463,Have fished both Lac Seul Lodge and Evergreen. Both of them are top notch with good service and great Owners and plenty of good fishing. If you want to go to either of them get reservations early ...they have a big repeat business. You might check out Lac Seul Outposts. They have a great camp and the fishing in that part of the Lake is second to none. Im trying it next year based on the fact that every fisherman I have talked to who has been there says it is awesome.....GOOD LUCK
