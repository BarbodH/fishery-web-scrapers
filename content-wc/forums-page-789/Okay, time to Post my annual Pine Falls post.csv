Every year since around 98 or so, I have heard reports of ""baitfish are in the system"" or the greenbacks are starting to come in around this time of year. Since about 98' fishing has been declining. I am still excited to fish and looking forward to going. Every year I post a ""Pine Falls request for fishing report"". Well, here it is! Usually there are some good replies...positive or negative, I'll take either. Have any of you been out much yet or is it still a little early to tell? What are the water levels like and at this time is the current flowing pretty well? I am scheduled to be there on Oct 7th through the 10th as well as Oct 21st through the 24th. Any information is greatly appreciated. Lookout Greenbacks, Here I come!"

Last year we did o.k. in November. This year may be different however as this has been one of the coldest summers in recorded history in Manitoba....all depends if the greenbacks migration is triggered by length of day or water temperature - never did hear a solid answer to this one. The later you go the better in my opinion. Halloween seems to be a good starting point."
