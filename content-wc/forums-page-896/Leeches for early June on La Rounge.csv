527497,DLH,2003-02-07 10:52:00,1,Used crawlers and leeches last year (2nd week 0f June). Never got anything to look at the leeches but they hammered crawlers. Anybody have ideas as to why this happened?? Wondering if the water is too cold or what. Leeches are one of our best baits here in the middle states.
527498,Jim,2003-03-05 21:03:00,238,"What I've found is that if you drop a leech into cold water, it just balls up. Walleyes like that active leech. Might have some luck with some of the new walleye-specific plastic leeches, though.Jim"
527499,retire55,2003-03-06 07:14:00,1029,"DLH:Whether the water was too cold would be evident by whether the leeches curled up (as Jim has said) rather than stretching out (up to 6 inches for jumbo leeches). While fishing, we typically keep our leeches in some water on ice in a cooler. When we go to get a leech, they are curled up in a ball about the size of a quarter. As soon as they are placed into the lake, they stretch out and become very active.However, there are other possible reasons for your observations.Not all kinds of leeches attract fish. The leech species that live in waters with gamefish populations usually make poor bait. Most game fish ignore horse leeches. Either the scent of the horse leech repels fish or it lacks the action of bait leeches. As well, there is a school of thought that suggests that unless leeches are routinely rinsed (to get rid of the white protective slime they produce), they will actually repel fish."
527500,Butch,2003-03-06 10:35:00,115,Water temps under 50 degrees will make leaches stay in a ball as suggested.. Last year with late spring water in the lake was probably well below 50 degreesF in June.
