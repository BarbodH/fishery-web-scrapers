I can remember seeing about a dozen posts or so on some great ice fishing. I know that it is hard water fishing...but it is still fishing. And it gives all of us a chance to get out and get some fresh (cold) air. Not to mention that tingling in the hands when that rod tip just bounces ever so slightly. We live in a beautiful country weather you live in Canada or USA. The outdoors are always there and I for one love being outside. Let's enjoy what we have.Fish ON!!

528392,Stevie B,2003-03-07 23:01:00,157,"Good to here from a fellow Manitobain!!Ice fishing the last few weeks has been a little slow, but I do enjoy being out there. The best luck that I had this year was on the Red. Although I didn't stray too far away from the southern part of it. We mainly fished around the bridge on the 201. Pelican lake was really good a little while back. Many northern's and lots of perch, but not too much size to the perch. Rock Lake is also a favorite of mine. The northen fishing was unusaully slow there this year but according to other fisherman the walleye wern't too bad. I talked to a couple of guys out there tonight and they were cathing a few. Tommorow sounds like it might be a little too cold for fishing but Sun sounds like it might be the day.Fish ON!!"
