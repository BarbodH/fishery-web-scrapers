Is there anyone who would be interested in purchasing this gift certificate? For less than face value of course. I would hate to have it go to waste and it would be a savings for someone looking to head to Canada. You can e-mail me at [email protected] Thanks Joe"

There must be somebody out there who is going to be staying at this camp or would be interested in fishing in Canada but haven't picked a location yet. I have done some research and have come up with these websites to see what Little Canada Camp is like. http://www.justfishontario.com/disc65_toc.htm or http://www.littlecanadacamp.com/The gidt certificate is a $300.00 value + $100.00 minnow and gas charge with their boat. The user must have another paying adult with them....$400.00. It is cheaper if you bring your own boat. In that case, the gift certificate is valued at $270, with no additional charge other than the gas and minnows you buy as needed. If your partner is also sharing your boat, it is only $270.00 for him or her too.If you are interested in working something out or need more details you can e-mail me at [email protected]."
