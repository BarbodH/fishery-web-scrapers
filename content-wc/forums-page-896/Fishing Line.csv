I have been looking at trying either ""Vanish"" or ""Sensation"" this summer. I was wondering if anybody has any expereince using either one of these. I don't want to use a superline like Spiderwire or Fireline for walleye's.Fish ON!!"
528228,Vitreum,2003-03-05 09:59:00,221,"stevie, i used sensation last year and was very pleased with it. i'm going to try some rapala tough and finesse this year also. bought some trilene xt to make some spinner rigs and will probably end up throwing it out. i know that all the guys on here swear by it, but it's like working with bailing wire."
528229,retire55,2003-03-05 14:18:00,1029,"Stevie B:Last year I used Vanish as the leader for live bait (leech) drifting and jigging walleyes with light wire hooks. I didn't use mono as a leader at any time so consequently, I can not draw any conclusions regarding the fish catching performance of less visible line. All I can say is that I had no complaints with its use and I plan to use it again this season.I used 14 lb test Trilene XL for bottom bouncing walleyes and I used 10 lb test fireline on a line counter reel for crankbaiting walleyes."

For a leader I use a couple feet of that line that disapears in the water i forget the name. the fishing is great either way,"
528231,Guest,2003-03-06 05:36:00,0,"I've been a Guide in North Western Ontario for the last 30 years and have used Trilene's ""SOLAR"" XT, for all my fishing since it came on the market. I personally prefer 10 pound test for walleye and 17 pound test for northerns and lake trout. And you're absolutely right about the snaps!"
