528122,Guest,2003-03-01 12:20:00,0,"Our group has been going to the same camp in the Red Lake area for 10 years and we have met some very nice and special people that I would do anything for. This includes many local folks and people from south of the border. My complaint is with people who think they deserve some kind of special treatment just because they have been going to Canada for a number of years. Last year the camp we go to considered changing arrival time from 12:00 noon Sat. to 6:00 p.m. Fri. Checkout would then be 8:00 a.m. Fri. instead of 8:00 a.m. Sat. Would not make any difference to us as we would just change our itinerery. I should add the owners only explaination to us for the change was to give them a little extra time to clean the cabins and get everything in order for the next week. I don't blame them! In my opinion the real reason for it was that some people were showing up as early as 6:00 a.m.. Some people thought they carried the status of ""Special"" or ""Preferred Customer"". I have heard of a camp at Winasauga that has a gate across the entrance and is only opened for people leaving, until time to check-in. I always wonder why when we pull into camp at 12:10 there are people unloaded, launched, and heading out on the lake. Saturday morning we always fart around in Vermillion Bay for a couple of hours and have figured out over the years exactly how much time it takes to get to camp. Last year on the way home we stopped to get gas in Ear Falls. This was around 7:30 a.m. Sat.. There were a group of guys getting liscenses and one was wearing a Cyclone hat, so being a fellow Hawkeye state resident I asked him where they were headed. He told me they go to the same camp we stay at. Asked him how many years he had been going there. He replied ""been goin' there for 14 years"". He seemed like the leader of the group, giving advice, dressed to the hilt in his deck shoes, Dockers, Patagonia jacket and smoking a stoggie. I then asked him what time they usually arrive at camp. He told me anywhere from 8:00 to 10:00. I remarked ""Ahaa, your the reason for the change in camp policy"". He wondered what I was talking about so I explained to him what the owners had in mind and why. He then got an arrogant nature about him and basically told me the policy didn't pertain to him and his group. He had the idea people should kiss his backside because he was the leader of the group and bringing so much, including his presence, to the North Country. I then walked away without even wishing him good luck. I was thinking, 'what an embarrassing pompous A$$&%l#, this guy was. I should add, when calling to confirm our reservations for the coming year, the owners have decided not to implement the new policy.Sorry for being long winded, but what can be done about people like this? It helps to get it off my chest.P.S. to Bud, I've never had the pleasure to meet you but feel like I know you. You probably know which camp I'm talking about. Didn't use the camp name so as not to sound like an advertisment. My wife and Melinda were introduced to each other in the berry patch a couple years back. Sounds like she is great person with a lot of patience. From what I hear the only concern she has with you is you spend waaaaaay to much time with the customers, LOL. Look forward to meeting you some day."
528123,Guest,2003-03-01 13:15:00,0,The camp I go to let's their guests arrive and depart whenever they want.
528124,Vitreum,2003-03-01 13:58:00,221,"we arrive and go fishing at our lodge at lac seul several hours before checkin time. we don't unload the cars into the cabins. we do, however, hit the water if the boats are ready (they always are). nobody complains and we stay out of their way until the cabins are ready. we certainly do not consider ourselves to be arrogant or pushy. just anxious to get fishin."
528125,Guest,2003-03-01 14:57:00,0,"Have been going to this area for over 20 years and spending the summers for the last 5, I have quit telling people I'm a former Hawkeye. An awful lot of those people have the attitude that Canada exists only so people from Iowa have a place to fish. Not all of them but more than a fair share. Because I spend an awful lot of time around 2 camps I can tell some real stories. I've seen some folks put their gear on the cabin porch before the current guests have a chance to pack up to leave. Seen others just leave their vehicle and trailer on the boat ramp because they were anxious to get in a few extra hours of fishing. I guess the point of my post is to say, be considerate of the camp owners, they have alot of work to be done in a very short period of time and thus the reason for a CHECK-IN TIME Be considerate of the folks leaving ahead of you. Not everybody is ecstatic that YOU are on vacation. Have a good time but be courteous and thoughtful. Next week I'll pick on the folks from Minnesota for pulling right up to me when I'm fishing a spot and the folks from Wisconsin for forgetting to bring me cheese."
528126,Big Tim,2003-03-01 16:47:00,63,"We too usually arrive several hours before check in & try to get in a few hours of fishing prior to getting into the cabins. I always make it a point to call the week before & ASK if that is ok.! Our host has always been vere accepting of the idea. Just remember, even though we are customers, we're also GUESTS. The way I figure it that man can make or break a trip we've worked hard all year to be able to take. If I can ingratiate myself & my group to the owner, I just might get the better boat, cabin or best spot marked on my map. I sure won't be bumped for next years trip."
528127,Guest,2003-03-01 18:31:00,0,"We arrive early too. We can't wait to fish. While we can read the check in time, we want to get on the water.The camp owners where I go are understanding. There are some ground rules to arriving early. First, wait to talk to the owners until they are available and then apologize for being early. Second, do whatever the camp owner asks. If they say don't go in the cabin, then don't go in. If they tell you to park on the road, park on the road. Third, stay out of the way. The camp operators have a routine that they follow to clean and get ready. Fourth, be extra good for the whole week. Pick up after your self. Be polite to everybody. If you are catching fish and other guests are not, share some info. Lastly, leave early in the morning on your check out day so they can get a head start for the next batch of early arrivers.I get the feeling that the camp owners where we go are accepting of early arrivers. I would think that having everybody arrive at a certain time, would not be great for them either."
528128,alan ex pup,2003-03-02 00:17:00,126,"Hi. Wow pokeye 7 am and at ear falls already. What time do you get up around 4am. We have been up to red lake just for a ride, about an hour away. been staying at ear falls last 20 years. The wife and I stay the night at fort francis coming from chicago and then pokey along buying groceries in dryden. We get to ear falls around 2 in the afternoon. We check in have some lunch and by 4 or 5 are out on the lake fishing for dinner. plenty of time since the sun does not go down till 11 pm. This way we stay out of the traffic jam going up the road to dryden. I dont understand those people that at 6am just have to wake the camp up by going out on the lake that early. The wife and I have found that we catch just as much if not more by getting out on the lake by 11 am. After all this is vacaton. I get up early the rest of the year, We go to bed late and get up late. The fish will wait, they are always there."
528148,Guest,2003-03-05 14:28:00,0,"I've stayed in resorts all over NW Ontario and also in Manatoba. There have been several times because of transportation arragements that I have had to arrive early and one time as late as mid-night. I always explain my arrival time to the resort owner prior to arrival, usually at booking, and have always been accomodated. My thought on this issue is to always be up front with the people you are doing business with. There are positive rewards for being a good customer. TGG"
528154,Ivy,2003-03-05 14:53:00,556,Slow day in Marshfield isn't it
528137,Guest,2003-03-07 23:07:00,0,"Nope but I am glad you found a place you like. Those of us who spend our lives as tourist outfitters don't do it because we hate Americans - or any other group of people. We do it because - #####, you can figure out the answer to that. Is there a better life?"
528144,Guest,2003-03-03 19:24:00,0,"There are alot of good points here. But I can tell you the guys that show up early and want bait,maps etc. just Don't get the same service as the group that shows up on time you might think the camp owner is smiling and shaking your hand but I could tell you what he or she is really thinking. Over the years I've watch guys come into camp early jump in their boat just to get those couple more hours of fishing in, but they only stay out a few hours because they're dog tired, and when they should be out on the lake (4-darkpm Sat.) thier in the cabin sleeping. This is just my observation since I,ve been in the business. What I tell the boys, unload your stuff, have a cold one, take a nap, eat a early meal and fish to dark.PS Poke-eye if see a guy out on the lake with a yellow lab in his boat stop by and say hi"
528145,Guest,2003-03-04 11:52:00,0,Hey Ivy you like putting all the blame on the camp owner.weren't you the one who was bad mouthing Goose bay camp last year about your cabin and the service you got. You didn't show early did you?
528146,Ivy,2003-03-04 13:27:00,556,"We didn't show up early. In fact we arrived later than we could have. I did not ""bad mouth"" the Camp. I did confirm what Bigfish said about our trip when some one like you felt that we did not have the right to discuss our trip. That thread was discussed to death.My point to Poke-eye was, his complaint should be with the Camp Owner if he did not like the new schedule. Not some fellow customer who he decided to take issue with. Get the picture? Or should I type slower?Ivy"
528147,Guest,2003-03-04 15:09:00,0,"Im also a fellow Iowan,And its really sad to think that the most of you on here sound like a bunch of third graders fighting over a candy bar instead of a fisherman that loves to come to canada and fish with his buddies.It sounds like the most of you have forgot the real reason you go to the places you do...People have to remember that evry lodge you stay at there will be that one group that will think they are better than the world and on the lake they dont care if they pull right up infront of you and fish and cast across your lines.We just have to remember we are here to fish and have a good time so just forget those kind of people... And lets go fishn"
528149,Guest,2003-03-04 16:18:00,0,"No Ivy I can't agree with you poke -eye was just trying to show that the camp owners have alot of work to do in a short time and some time the guys showing up early might make them want to try somthing else different so they'll have the proper time to get their camps ready for you.and as a human being I believe he has right to say what he want if he feels his vacation time was going to be shortened If you want to type slower go ahead, it's not hard to read between your lines"
528136,lunker99,2003-03-04 16:52:00,236,"Alan-you staying at golden fawn again this year? If so, which week? We will be there june 7-14 this year."
528150,Guest,2003-03-04 19:12:00,0,"Wow.........by the looks of these messages we don't have to go all the way to Iraq for war. It really looks like there is some heavy ""cabin-fever"" going on. Relax, the days are getting longer and its only two and a half months 'till your next feed of Canadian walleye."
528151,Ivy,2003-03-05 08:50:00,556,"We had about a half a foot of snow and I have a bad case of the fever so I thought I might as well respond.Go back and re-read the thread. The author of this thread knew about the change in check in times ahead of time. And I agreed with him about early/late arrival frustration. My comment was on how the author handled the situation at the gas station. Not the issue of late/early arrivals. This other guest from Iowa who may or may not be even aware they were doing anything wrong, was told by the author that he was the reason his vacation schedule got altered. And then the author was ""surprised"" that this guy seemed rude to him.My point was, what did you expect him to do.And one last thing. The author made a point to describe what this guy was wearing in his thread. Ya think he had this guy summed up before he even talked to him.I for one, wear a Brooks Brothers suit, Cole Hahn shoes and a Rolex watch when I fish. You would never know I'm a hog farmer from Iowa.Ivy"
528152,Guest,2003-03-05 12:26:00,0,You probably have two mailboxes too.
528153,Guest,2003-03-05 12:47:00,0,"Yes, and three dogs but just one wife."
528132,Guest,2003-03-02 14:54:00,0,"I am one of those that you are talking about! I stay at the camp you are referring to.This will be my 15th year at the same place. I usually arrive at 10:00 a.m. He always has my cabin and boat ready and hasn't been a problem until recently.I have noticed more and more people coming in early. It is a hassle for them to get the cabins clean and everything ready. Even tho I don't need anything from him, he always stos what he is doing and says welcome and tells me where the fish are biting. I know he does that with everyone, so time is of the essence.So.... this year I will abide and arrive at noon. If everyone feels they are welcome eary, as I do, it becomes a major problem for the owners. I actually was looking forward to Fri-Fri. I leave on Friday anyway.Good luck to all this year."
528133,Guest,2003-03-02 17:52:00,0,If you've been going for years you probably know the camp owner pretty good....might even be friends. Friends help friends out. You could get the pail and mop and clean up the cabin for him or her to sort of say thanks for letting us use your property outside of the agreed upon terms. Or you could smoke your cigar and watch him work.
528134,Guest,2003-03-02 18:29:00,0,"OK, me againPLEASE, please, please, do not get out the mop. We know what we're doing and we know how we want it done. I have had guests insist on helping. They're trying to be nice but hey guys - you're cutting into your fishing time cuz you're not getting in the cabin until I think it's clean enough for you. You can tell me you want it dirty til the cows come home. Might as well give it up and go fishing. The guest is right on everything except wanting a dirty cabin. I will clean the fridge first so you can cool your food and beer before you leave us to it and go fishing but that's it.One question though - why don't you cool your beer in advance so you have a cold one ready on arrival? Many do but many don't. I know what my priority would be."
528138,Guest,2003-03-02 18:31:00,0,"We are good friends and I have helped him out. Would love to sit back and have a cigar, but I am trying to quit. 6 weeks and counting."
528135,alan ex pup,2003-03-02 23:35:00,126,"Barbara, do you own Golden Fawn?"
528139,Guest,2003-03-03 10:11:00,0,"Is my camp the only one that lets the guests arrive and depart on any day and at any time? That Sat. to Sat. schedule is a little too rigid, although I understand the reasons for it."
528140,Guest,2003-03-03 10:28:00,0,"Best let you all know who I am etc so you know I'm not pulling your leg. Early arrivers are THE #1 sore spot with this camp owner. We are a small Mom and Pop operation that struggels to get the help we need with the large number of resorts in the area and the small workforce to draw from. Combine that with the fact that some of the help forgets that after bar time they need to go to work the next day; Sat. morning can be a real pain to say the least. We have people still in cabins after the requested 9AM checkout and people in the camp as early as 6AM and even earlier looking for a cabin. Yes some just want to launch their boat and ""get out of the way"" but then want to use the only boat launch in the canp where I'm washing the boats from the lame party that didn't get in till to late the night before; so the boat could be washed when needed; then there's the request to get bait etc, along with the annual refresher course on the fact that the rocks haven't moved since the last ice age. Putting stuff in and around the cabins only keeps us from getting to our work in an efficient manner as camp clean up is as much a routine as hard work. We have only asked for 4 hours ever since we opened camp, giving our guests a 7 night 6 1/2 day fishing vacation. We've had serious discussions the past two years and Patty is winnning the battle in 2004, to have Sat AM checkin after 8AM so the early birds can get on the lake, as we understand you are really looking forward to a great trip. The trade off is a Friday noon checkout, yes a totally empty camp at NOON; so we can have a calm afternoon to get our work done, with better timing to schedual help and get parts etc for that motor that didn't hit anything so why tell the camp owner. This sill gives the guests a 6 1/2 day fishing trip so there is no time lost on the lake and I can assure you, a more relaxed camp staff to deal with. Some may accept the changes and some may think they are owed more time in camp but for our business we are going to set our own hours just like other businesses and have a chance to do the job right."
528141,Vitreum,2003-03-03 11:28:00,221,"i believe that could hurt your business gary. i don't know how your bookings are. you may be full to capacity from beginning to end of season. i know that i would not like that arrangement. but, like you said, it's your business. good luck."
528143,Ivy,2003-03-03 13:57:00,556,"Poke-Eye, It's not what you say, it's how you say it.I agree with your frustration on late check outs and early arrivals. We had a similiar type situation last year. We arrived on time and our Cabin was not ready because the people in the Cabin decided to be lazy #### and take advantage of the Camp host.However, if you had approached me (after I probably drove all night) the way you approached this other guy from Iowa I would have probably been a little more than discourteous to you. You had a huge chip on your shoulder when you jumped on this guy for "" re-arranging the schedule "". What did you gain out of your conversation? Did it make you feel better? Who are you to wag your finger in this guys face and say "" Ah hah you're the problem ""What did you expect him to do. Kiss your finger? And apologize to you as if you are the schedule King? In his eyes you had no more standing than he did at that Camp. Unless there is some un-written hierarchy I am unware of. If the issue really bothered the Camp host, they would have told the problem guest to go somewhere else. They didn't. I think your issue is with your host rather than the guest. Ivy"
528142,daveaz,2003-03-03 15:05:00,16,Gary I for one think your new schedule is totally fine. If you dont get the time you need to address camp issues then everyone suffers.Any openings for a single this June?
528129,Guest,2003-03-02 07:27:00,0,"Alan,No, we don't get up at 4:00 a.m. As I said we were going home when I talked to this guy. We get up around 5:30 and try to leave camp by 6:00. If you've ever tried to cross the border after noon on Sat. you know why. During the week in camp, very rarely are we in the boats before 9:00.As to the other posts, I'll be more to the point. Due to early arrivals possibly having an effect on camp policy, our time on the water would be shortened by 1/2 day. This being due to the fact that now we can unload and be on the water by 2:00 p.m. Sat. Under the new policy we would need to be off the water by 10:00 a.m. Fri. as it takes a heck of alot longer to load than unload.What ticks me off is a few early arrivals can possibly dictate camp policy with their inconsiderate nature, thereby cutting short the fishing time enjoyed by the more considerate. As I said before, ""You know who you are!!"" Wake up and slow down, you're on vacation.As for people arriving from noon to 2:00, I would think this would be less time consuming for the owners than from 8:00 in the morning till 2:00 in the afternoon. Maybe we could hear from some camp owners about how they feel on this subject?"
528130,IaCraig,2003-03-02 10:18:00,434,"Poke-Eye, here is a quote from your original post ""In my opinion the real reason for it was that some people were showing up as early as 6:00 a.m.."" Sounds to me like you are on quite a rant without really knowing why the resort owners want to change policy. Per your post the hosts only said that they want more time to clean the camp and you assumed it was because of early arrivals! Maybe they are just having problems finding help on Saturday mornings? Maybe your are unintentionally using them as an excuse to push your personal agenda. You could be right but if I were you I wouldn't get my shorts in a knot without knowing more. Don't get me wrong, I believe that a person needs to be considerate of their hosts and neighbors and if the hosts say ""no early arrivals"" or ""no one on the water before 10:00a.m."" I feel everyone should comply or go elsewhere. And yes I am from Iowa, but no I do not arrive to camp early, and I try to be very courteous. However if I want to get up early a couple days and quietly hit the water when it is calm and cool, I see no reason why that should bother you or anyone else. I drive 15 hours to fish Canada's wonderful lakes, so that is what I do, I fish. I don't sleep till noon, I do not stay up late drinking beer and I do not dictate to others what they should do on their vacations. IaCraig"
528131,Guest,2003-03-02 14:33:00,0,"Ok I'm a campowner and I do have an opinion.First tho - Don't diss Iowa - they're great people.We don't have a check in/out time for the reason mentioned in one of the posts. We don't want everyone arriving at the same time. We also can't guarantee all cabins by 2 pm. We have 7 cabins and it takes 3 of us an avg of 10 hrs to clean them. We start at 6 - do the math. But our guests arrive at different times. They let us know in advance roughly when they will be in and we do the cabins based on that info. If people arrive before their cabin is ready (sometimes before the previous guests have left), they go fishing or get rid of some of their excess beer or visit. We haven't had a problem yet. Some groups even arrive Friday night and camp out til Sat. That way they get fishing early on the first day. Ending the week on Fri doesn't work because no one wants their fishing trip to end a day early. So, we accommodate each other as best we can.Oh yeah - every week we have guests that leave before dawn (that's 3:30 a.m. opening week). Doesn't bother anyone. Just shut off the musical horns til you're away from camp."
