528181,eyewitness,2003-03-04 12:03:00,680,"On the contrary, slice the fillet in two to make two thin fillets and they cook up just great. It's the thickness of the fillet and the prolonged cooking time that causes the sacrifice in taste. Also, slabbing the fillet should be done prior to freezing if possible. That way the meat will thaw out more evenly causing less of a mushy feel to the outsides of the fillet.....Your conservational opinion is good Bruce, but for those who don't get out much and desire to keep a 5#er, they should at least be able to enjoy it:)."
528182,stinger,2003-03-04 12:41:00,7,"Never keep a 5 lbs walleye unless its injured, its within a legal slot limit or you buy it at the store.A 5lbs is ~ 25 inches long and will taste 5 years old. Take a picture, then let it go !"
528183,Guest,2003-03-06 11:05:00,0,"You may think that Canadian waters are void of pollution but the truth is they are not and a five pound walleye is loaded with PCB's and other contaminants so eating one could seriously shorten your life span. And the guy who said cooking one was half as long as a ten pounder, he is really sucking up the poison. 14"" taste best and are the most healthy for us to eat."
528184,retire55,2003-03-06 12:25:00,1029,"Kimmy:Let me first emphasize that I have no argument with anyones catch and release philosophy.However, I would encourage all discussion of such philosophies to be at least based on accurate information. Specifically, the 2001-2002 Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish states:""In a number of locations, particularly inland locations, fish are analyzed only for mercury as this is likely to be the only contaminant to cause consumption restrictions.""Consequently, I would question the accuracy of your statement "" a five pound walleye is loaded with PCB's and other contaminants so eating one could seriously shorten your life span."" Perhaps you have access to better or more accurate information than the eating guide produced by the Ontario Government. If so, could you be so kind as to share that information with us.Lake Seul, in NW Ontario, is a favourite destination for many walleye fisherpersons. According to the Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish, a person should not consume more than 4 meals per month of walleyes 22 to 26 inches in length (roughly equivalent to a 5 lb walleye). Lake of the Woods is another popular destination for walleye fisherpersons. There, the eating guide recommends no more than 8 meals per month of walleye 22-26 inches in length."
528185,Guest,2003-03-06 12:35:00,0,"So now it's....what, immoral.....unethical??? For a person to choose to eat a 5Lbs Walleye. I don't lead a very healthy lifestyle, so I'm not overly concerned with PCB's and the such.If you cut all the gray fat off the fillets they can be prepared about anyway and taste great. If in a hurry and want to dine like a king though, 25"" is a great size for cheeking them out and frying the cheek meat in butter. Don't get any better than that!Good eating!!!Chef"
528186,Wild Bill,2003-03-06 16:42:00,64,"Mud line,or lateral vein,in my opinion,must be removed on a 5 pounder.Also fillet must be skinned.After that,I trim off all the darkish red meat from skin side of fillet.Then it is ready for cooking any way you like it."
528187,Guest,2003-03-06 19:54:00,0,By the time you trim all the crap off you guys are talking aboutyou have about as much meat left as a 16 incher.Release this size fish unless it's going on the wall!!
528188,Wild Bill,2003-03-07 04:35:00,64,"BS,I think it depends on the body of water you catch the fish on.Here on Erie,putting a 5 pounder on the wall would be almost considered a gag joke.I think the walleyes here hatch out at about 16 inches."
528189,Guest,2003-03-07 20:50:00,0,"Wild Bill,I guess where I fish other than Canada a 5 pounderisn't common and I wasn't saying that 5 pounds is a trophy. Must be nice to fish where they hatch at16 inches. Why don't you just pick the eggs in the spring. LOLBS BS BS BS"
528171,Guest,2003-03-03 09:41:00,0,"I am just curious,,, what is the best way to cook a 5 pound walleye.In 10 years of Canadian fishing I have never caught one that is close so I will never know. Has anybody cooked one and does it taste any different than the 15 incher that are awesome. My group just enjoys the small ones and the cold Canadian beer such as Blue light and Crystal. Hopefully some year we will luck out and catch a walleye over 3 lbs."
528172,Guest,2003-03-03 10:11:00,0,"Depending on where you are fishing, the chances that a 5lb fish will be in the slot is almost a given. These fish are the best for reproducing as well, and should not be kept unless hurt badly. Cooking can be done basically the same way, in my opinion the little ones can not be beat. Good luck to you."
528173,Guest,2003-03-03 10:31:00,0,"I have taken the five pounders and cut them up in small pieces, then put batter on them and deep fry. Delicious! Also, try keeping the skin on the fillets, then put lemon pepper and paprika on the flesh side, put the flesh side down on the grill for about 2-3 minutes, then turn over on the scale side, and finish grilling. Takes about 10-12 minutes more. Delicious and low calorie too!"
528174,retire55,2003-03-03 10:49:00,1029,"If it is preferred to cook as entire fillets (2), I would use a baking recipe. If you are prepared to cut up the fillets into the size that easily fit into your frying pan (preferred cast iron skillet), then I would fry it in a little butter. I cooked such pieces from a 7 lb walleye last year and it was surprisingly delicious, although, the taste didn't compare to that of 15 inch walleye (they're almost like eating candy). I concluded that the 7 pounder tasted good because it came from good lake water. By comparison, I wouldn't keep or eat a 7 pounder out of the western basin of Lake Erie. There, we just kept and ate the ""spikes"". Whether a 5 pound walleye is in the slot or not depends on where you fish. If there is a slot, then such a fish would have to be released whether hurt or not (MNR officials in Ontario don't give recreational fishermen any discretion - consequently, if you keep an injured slot fish and get caught, you'll pay). While I agree with eyecrosser that a 5 lb female walleye is a primary breeding size, where there is no slot, whether one keeps a 5 pound walleye is a personal decision. I don't have a problem harvesting a 5 lb walleye if the health of the walleye fishery on that lake is excellent. I contend that all responsible fishermen should know as much as possible about any lake before they fish it."
528175,Guest,2003-03-03 14:26:00,0,We just cook'em half as long as we do a 10 pounder!
528176,Guest,2003-03-03 15:08:00,0,5lb fish are commonly caught if you are on the water enough. We release almost all but will keep them if the fish has been gill injured or is in bad shape. I prefer to bake them whole with a stuffing. They are extremely good eating done this way.
528177,Ohio fisherman,2003-03-03 16:53:00,989,"Here are some suggestions without getting into the debate on keeping or catch and release.Personally, I would not keep a 5 pound walleye in Canada unless injured (the fish not me) because that is an older fish and therefore may not taste so great, may contain many years of possible contaminants, and is a prime breeder. To keep or release is entirely up to the fisherman (of course following the local regulations). However, here in Ohio on Lake Erie a 5 pounder is a wonderful fish to keep because of the abundance of the fish and their rapid growth rate.A Lake Erie 5 pound fish could be cooked in any manner in any recipe and taste great. However fish that are around that size and larger we usually either bake or cook in chowder because of the larger grain structure. To bake, lay a fillet in a baking dish. Brush or drizzle with melted butter. Mix bread crumbs with melted butter and spread on top of the fish. Bake until the fish is flaky.Use your favorite chowder recipe and you will be hooked for sure. Walleye chowder is as good as halibut or lobster chowder. Basic idea is milk, butter, celery, tiny carrot chips, onion, bay leaf, and anything else that you like. Simmer the mixture until all vegetables are soft, then add the fish in bite size chunks and simmer some more. Do not boil the chowder or the milk will curdle and the fish will fall apart. This is even better the next day after it rests in the refrigerator overnight.I have tasted chowder made with MUCH larger walleyes and it tasted great too. A 15 pounder makes a lot of chowder! A 5 pound walleye tastes better than a 5 pound trout. A bald eagle tastes better than a golden eagle. A spotted owl tastes better than . . . Good fishing, Ohio fisherman"
528178,eyewitness,2003-03-03 17:22:00,680,"I will second the opinion of others who support catch and release. However....if you have the right to keep one within the regs and feel you must do so, or if it isn't going to make it upon release anyway, you certainly have the option to eat it. Baking thicker fillets is the usual method. If you choose to deep fry, just make sure to take the fillet and cut it in half to make two thin fillets. These will cook up the same way a smaller fish would and will taste just as good. Also, I would personally cut away the belly meat side of the fillet and toss it. Bigger fish tend to have more contaminents from acid rain and such and that portion of the body is where they all end up. Even the clean waters of Canada and northern Minnesota end up with these contaminents. A lot of them come from the wood pulp and paper plants, either directly or via rainfall. Regardless, enjoy your catch and don't let anyone get under your skin about it. It is your decision and the conservation laws are made to accomodate it on occasion."

528180,Bruce,2003-03-04 11:36:00,48,I've read all these sugestions of how great a 5 pounder tastesand would like to comment.I have tried Walleye in this size range from WI and Canada andquickly learned that they taste awful compared to a 17 inch eater.Now I'm pan fry with shorelunch cook only.Don't keep this size fish unless it dies in the boat unlessyour on Lake Erie according to another post where they're a dime adozen.
