Make sure your equipment is the best from the line to what keeps the fish connected to you. We always used just what always worked before. Now that we learned the hard way- spell that lost bigggg fish we make sure the line is fresh and the knots are tight and especially that the snaps are the best. Now we only use coastlock snaps for connecting the lure to the line. I know you are familiar with those cheap snaps that are made of brass and are so easy to work my wife and I have lost a couple of big fish that just opened that cheap snaplock open like nothing. with the coastlock snap something else will have to give it up because this thing will not open, its hard to open purposely. good luck. just my 2 cents. There is another good snap like this but I dont remember the name. Coastlock are $5.00 each but you wont have to buy many."
