Have heard that they are all shallow(5-15 feet),have heard they can be anywhere from 10 to 90 feet deep, and that they are scattered at various depths. Anybody have experience and/or information that they can share?"

Last year, it didn't come off until the 10th of June or so.Regardless, yes, the trout will be in shallow water a few weeks after ice-out. I don't know if you heard this story when you were up there last year, but somebody apparently caught a 45lb+ Lake Trout in 5ft of water!! This was in Hunter Bay (where I assume you will be fishing) so, that's where you will want to look first. Try a big, silver chrome spoon in the shallows, slowly working your way to deeper water until you find the trout. One saying that holds true on Lac La Ronge, the bigger the hook, the bigger the fish.Hope this helps you out."
528234,alan ex pup,2003-03-06 01:11:00,126,We will be fishing LOTW first week of June. The have lake trout too. I guess it depends on where the temp is that they like and I hav no idea where that is. Does anyone know that temp? I guess you have to see them on the locator and set the downrigger for that depth if you have to go deep.
