528317,Guest,2003-03-06 12:35:00,0,I am planning on building an ice house at my cabin for storing ice in the summer months. Does anyone have any plans or ideas on how to properly do this?Thank you in advance

The ice was slid into the ice house by means of a tapered slide leading from the water and was made of strong logs and appropriate bracing. The ice blocks were placed so they were touching each other and as many layers as practicable were used. When the house was filled, it was covered over with a thick layer of saw dust so that it would be level all across the structure, wall to wall. The roof would be also of planking, no shingles to hold the heat. Some rain water would get in, but that was a tradeoff. The sides of the house on each end were open from the roof taper up (forming an open triangle) to allow the summer's heat to escape. Usually they were built in a shady spot very close to the water that would get some wind.A ladder on one end was used to enter early in the season and boards were removed during the summer as the ice was used/melted. By fall, you could walk in!A more modern update might be to use foam for insulation, but sawdust would probably still be a more economical material. As I remember, the material covering the ice was replaced every couple of years, as it would start acquiring a fishy odor!There may be more to it than this, but maybe this will give you some ideas to work with. Good luck"
