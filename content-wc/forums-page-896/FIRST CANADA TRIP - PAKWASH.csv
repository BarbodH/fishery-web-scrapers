We will be staying at Pakuni Lodge at the south end of the lake where the Chukuni River flows out. Will probably fish crank baits mostly by casting or trolling. Would like input on best lures and locations for Walleye, Pike & Smallmouth bass and would like any comments you might have concerning Pakuni Lodge. We are all river fishermen and were wondering if the Chukuni would be ok to fish. Should we stay strictly in the lake? Looking to make it a memorable trip for my son's. Any help would be GREAT. Thanks in advance. Brad"

I would recommend trolling with slip rigs along dropoffs tipped with a leach or crawler. The type of rig to use is asimple painted slip sinker with a stop and a floating jig tipped with live bait. The best color on the lake is chartruse and orangeis good also. Bring along minnows, leaches, and crawlers becauseone day they like one thing the next another. As far as location I would try around Walleye Island and around the rock points by the provinsal park along the east side of the lake.The rivers I'm not familiar with. The eyes should be set up in summerlocations which generally means the deeper drops but don't rule outtrying the bays along weed lines. This is a great walleye lake and the south end has good smallmouth action too. Also try looking forbaitfish with your graph suspended in deep water. Last don't try run too shallow around walleye island with slip rigs, it's rocky and you'll loose everything. If you fish the rocks staywith slip bobbers or crankbaits.Good Luck!!"
