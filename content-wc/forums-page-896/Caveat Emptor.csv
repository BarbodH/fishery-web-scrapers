528410,Guest,2003-03-07 16:38:00,0,"I fished this past Fall on the Red River in Manitoba Canada and had inquired about fishing it with various guides services. Well I did it and fished with some great people. After the season was over (in December) I received a follow up e-mail from one of the services that I didn't use. I've deleted all references to the service but I found it interesting that someone would write such a letter. I'm not sure what to make of it apart from the fact that ""with hind-sight we all see 20/20"".............. Hello ***,****** ***** Guiding Services would like to thank you for your interest in booking us for Fall fishing on the Red River. We have had many satisfied fisherman with us on the Red. This year was an exception to the rule. We redirected our efforts entirely away from the Red River and Pine Falls area as the fishing due to many environemental variables caused those riverways to be no less than a complete washout.Unfortunately, some guiding efforts were still being attempted by some, despite the obvious.We had thought about you and had hoped you were not one of them.We at ******* ***** hope that we may add you to our list of satisfied clients perhaps some time in the future. Please feel free to contact us, even if you just want some good fishing advice. Sincerely, **** ******What dou guys think?"
