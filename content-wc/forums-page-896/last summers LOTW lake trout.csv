A little salt and tarter sauce and lemmon. I wish I had a freezer of them. Not as good as walleye but a close second.
528247,Guest,2003-03-08 13:48:00,0,"Wonder if that would work on Rainbows, too?We can catch a bunch of 2-3 lb Rainbow trout, very easily locally. I just save a few to ""can"" and release all the rest. But, this may be worth a try.Thanks."
528236,alan ex pup,2003-03-06 01:26:00,126,tommorrow I am going to cook a lake trout from LOTW last summer. It was frozen in one of those vacuum bag dohickys that my wife brought with last year. supposed to keep the fish better. Never done this before any ideas how to cook it? It about 30 inches long with head and tail on. I suppose to start I could cut off the head and tail and bake it but I know someone out there has a winning method to cook this big fish. Thanks a lot Alan.
528237,Guest,2003-03-06 08:25:00,0,"Nice Fish. Must have come from Whitefish Bay. You may or may not want to try this but here is what we would do. Cut off the head and tail. Then split the fish full length down the back bone on both sides of the bone. Gives you two filets but leave the ribs in and the skin on. Also cut off two or so inches along the belly of each filet. This area will be white looking and is where a lot of the fat and fishy flavor of a fish this big will be. So cut that off and toss it. Now lay the fillets, skin down on heavy foil and turn up the edges to hold the juice on the foil for the time being. Coat the flesh side of the fillets with Miracle Whip (yes), then saly and pepper to taste, then some cut up green peppers and onions. Put on the char or gas grill on medium heat and cover loosly with another sheet of foil. Keep and eye on it and when the fish begins to flake easily with a fork punch a few holes in the bottom foil to slowly let the fats and juice run through onto the heat. Do not do it all at once but by the time the fats have all run through the foil it should be perfect. Serve on the bottom foil and the skin will stick to it. Should be good! Don't burn down the grill by letting all the fat through the foil at once. Taked longer to write about it than do it.Hope it workes for you. The fish is a little too big for the best taste.

528241,Guest,2003-03-06 10:07:00,0,"Great suggestion. I do basically the same thing when cooking lake trout, but instead of using Miracle Whip I marinate the fillets in Italian salad dressing for a couple hours."
528239,downriverbob,2003-03-06 10:22:00,880,"Bob, What island is Whitefish Bay Resort on or what other islands is it near."
528242,alan ex pup,2003-03-06 10:32:00,126,OK sounds good and am going to try it tonight. I think whitefish bay is the water just west of sioux narrows. we caught this one in about 20 feet of water first week on June. still cold water. with the fish finder we could see them a lot deeper but had no way of getting to them then. this year we have our own boat with downriggers on and hopefully can catch a couple more. This one was a fluke
528240,Guest,2003-03-07 07:02:00,0,Whitefish Bay Camp is on Calvert Island. Timber Island is larger and easy to find. Calvert is a couple of islands south of Timber.Bob
528243,alan ex pup,2003-03-07 10:21:00,126,OK fixed up like you said and it was great. I am having the other half for lunch today. I was suprised that while I cut it in half at the back bone there were very few bones at all in the fish. just a few rib bones right at the head end and that was it for bones. Thanks a lot Alan
528245,Guest,2003-03-07 10:37:00,0,"I wish you the best.Man, I have never had ANY Lake trout that tasted good after having been frozen. Hope you have better luck...Maybe that vacuum packing helps?"
528244,Guest,2003-03-07 10:41:00,0,"Really...? It was great?That is good to know. I'll have to try again sometime...your way.Ours are so danged strong tasting, and freezing seems to concentrate the skanky taste even more."
