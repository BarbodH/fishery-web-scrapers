527203,Guest,2003-02-03 06:17:00,0,I have one of those big Ontario {lodge} maps and can not find this lodge listed. Where is it? How is the fishing at the end of June/start of July? Muskies? Walleyes? Northerns?Thanks
527204,Guest,2003-02-03 06:58:00,0,Its in the northeast part of Lac Seul at Chamberlain Narrows. About a 30-35 mile boat ride from the landing at Deception Bay. Good spot but the camp is a bit rustic.

527206,Guest,2003-03-05 13:05:00,0,"when you say it's a bit rustic, what do you mean. i just booked a week in august for me and my wife. can i assume they have flushers and potable drinking water from the faucets. how's the fishing around there. thanks for the info."
527207,Guest,2003-03-05 13:23:00,0,"flushers, yes....they have three german shorthair pointers that really flush the pheasant out of the bush. they also have portable drinking water....only a short walk from the lake to your cabin using old gallon milk jugs. enjoy your trip."
527208,Guest,2003-03-06 11:00:00,0,Camp used to be rustic but is as nice as it gets as the ownersKen and Brenda have dumped in tons of money. It's housekeeping and has all the amenities.
