1548500,Fisherman Ted,2013-03-08 09:32:00,461,No casinos in Kenora. Sorry.
1548889,Gunner_Fletch,2013-03-09 04:38:00,74,"Absolutely correct....I live in Kenora and there hasn't been one here for the better part of 8 years. They lost their license due to ""issues"". It's been nothing but a bingo hall ever since. Why they still have signs here and on the highways with directions to the ""casino"" , is beyond me! That said, the local municipality is pursuing a venture to build a hotel/banquet/casino in the near future in Kenora. Hopefully it will have water access also for both winter and summer."
1548026,revitup,2013-03-07 11:21:00,140,"Are there casinos in Ontario near Fort Frances, Dryden, Vermillion Bay, or Perrault Falls? Our group is fishing at Cedar Lake and some are thinking of golf before we arrive at the lodge. I am trying to think of something other than golf for those who do not want to golf. Anyone out there who can help with this? Thanks in advance"
1548028,tackleman,2013-03-07 11:28:00,444,"your best bet, to find a casino and play golf, go to fortune bay, it's 1 1/2 hours south of international falls, great place to stay for a day or 2. it is located on Lake Vermillion , has a good 18 hole golf course (so i've been told) , a marina if you want to fish, and a reasonabley priced hotel . The wife and I go there a few times each year ."
1548043,revitup,2013-03-07 11:47:00,140,"Thanks tackleman. I need to be more specific. We want to cross the border together, then some want to play nine or 18 holes before checking in at the lodge on saturday before fishing. Others don't want to play golf. Can't really split up because those that arrive early end up with all the unloading work. So I'm trying to see if there is something for the non-golfers to do that is worth their time."
1548045,Blackmacs,2013-03-07 11:55:00,2121,The closest one in Canada is in Kenora otherwise Fortune Bay is in Minnesota.
1548067,revitup,2013-03-07 12:49:00,140,I've been calculating our trip time and think we would get into Kenora around 6-7 am. Is this casino open for blackjack around this time?
1548070,LOW1,2013-03-07 12:57:00,2828,You may want to give the Kenora casino a call. I am not sure what games they have other than bingo. http://184.69.36.142/www/goldeneagle/html/

1548248,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-03-07 19:39:00,84,I have been to the casino in Kenora. It has been 15 years ago or so. Was more of a bingo hall than a casino but there were some table games. Blackjack for sure. A lot could have changed since then though.
1548249,revitup,2013-03-07 19:41:00,140,Looks like it isn't going to happen in Kenora. I called and they only play bingo. Thanks for the help guys. I appreciate it.
1548389,Skywagon,2013-03-08 06:12:00,1106,"If you want to take a little different route, go up the north shore of Superior from Duluth and come through Thunder Bay. There are casino's there and is a scenic drive if you have never taken it. I would guess it will add 1 1/2 hours to the trip, but eliminates 502 if you go that way."
