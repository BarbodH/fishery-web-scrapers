After traveling north of the border for so many years, we've developed a friendship with quite a few camp owners. Its a matter of stopping by and saying hello, hows it going. I always get hung up in the conversation and I just don't get to see everything else."
1547999,Skyraptor,2013-03-07 10:22:00,291,Plan on going Saturday. Have not been there for years and I'm taking the GF and her 3 grandkids who have not gone to a show ever and plan on taking them trout fishing. How much does it cost to trout fish these days?
