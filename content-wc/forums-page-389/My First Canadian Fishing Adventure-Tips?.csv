1427703,Sportdog,2012-04-28 11:37:00,6735,"At 61 years young I'll be going on my first trip to a Canadian fishing camp. We will be staying in a cabin after being transported five miles to a lake with no public access and are allowed to bring plenty of gear and food. I'm looking for any information on what you may feel that I should bring to make my fishing and stay the best that it can be. The lake has walleye, northern pike, lake trout, and whitefish. We will be fishing out of 16 1/2 foot aluminum boats with 15 hp outboards. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
1427723,BennieS,2012-04-28 12:19:00,108,"I'm 60 and going for the first time as well. Gold Arrow Camp in 34 days. Walleye Central is a gold mine of information. Not only will people here be generous with their many years of knowledge but there is also a search engine that you can use if you want to search for a specific subject that has been previously discussed. It's a very valuable tool for first timers such as ourselves. Also go to the Strictly Fishing ""board"". Just an encyclopedia of knowlege shared there as well that will apply to your trip. Tell you what, if you lay out a detailed and specific question, these guys can answer it. Good luck on your trip and don't be surprised at the quality of responses you will get. The famous turkey hunter Ben Lee described turkey hunting and I feel it is true of the Canadian fishing activity as well, ""it's a disease""."
1427738,guidedfishing,2012-04-28 12:57:00,531,"Never to late to get hooked on something.I've been going to Canada as many as 5 times a year for almost 40years now, with a few missed years here and there. I've been pretty consistent the last 15years. I've camped and stayed in cabins and hotel rooms. Regardless here is what I can tell you.1. Get the best set of rain gear you can afford. I prefer full bibs and rain parka, I also have a quality pair of Lacrosse uninsulated knee high rubber boats. That gear is ether on me or in the boat at all times. (I can't stress this enough, and you can thank me later)2. Keep the tackle simple, you really do not need alot. Make sure you have an assortment of 1/8 ounce and 1/4 ounce jigs, throw in a couple fire tiger husky jerks, couple spinners and spoons with leaders for pike and you have it 90% covered. 3. The good folks of Canada for the most part are friendly and most of the time willing to help you. When it comes to cash if you use US dollars expect to be hammered on the exchange rate. Here is what I do since I travel frequently in Canada I either use my credit card because it automatically does the exchange or I stop at an ATM machine on the Canadian side and get a couple hundred buck's CAD. Usually the ATM fee is only a couple bucks and a lot cheaper than doing an exchange anywhere else. I always have loonies floating around somewhere so I don't worry about bring it back I will use it next time.4. Look for fish the same way you would back home, there is no secret. Inside and outside turns for walleyes, bars, and wind blowing into bays. Pike wood, rocks, and weeds. 5. Make sure you have some sun screen, hat and polarized glasses, all day on the lake even in cloudy weather can burn the back of your neck. No need to be miserable.6. Don't drink the lake water no matter what some macho knuckle head may do. Many of the camps use lake water but it comes from points sunk in deeper water and is most of the time filtered. One case of Giardia and you will never make that mistake again. Been there done that don't try it.7. Couple tips to make your crossing at the border easier. No where your going and how long you will be there. They will ask you. Don't try and joke with the border guards just be courteous answer their question and don't say more than what they ask for. They will ask you where your from make sure that what you tell them is the same thing that is on your passport, don't try and give them a reference point if its a small town just tell them the town in your address. You will enjoy. if all else fails see point number 1.good luckGF"

Bug repellents , sprays, you can buy a spray for your clothes and let it dry and it works good. I know it never rains in Canada but good quality rain gear is a must. Check on the availability of live bait. I always take some even though they say you don't need it. Favorite spices and fish breadings. Find out about cooking equipment. Take a good skillet, Ive yet to find a good skillet at a Fish camp or resort. Do you need to bring a cast iron pot ? Do you need a sleeping bag and pillow. Does the boat have a livewell ? No livewell, put fish in cooler on ice, don't leave them on a stringer hanging off the boat all day, you want to eat them don't you. Do you need a portable depthfinder ? Do you need a marker buoy? Is ice available ? What about refrigeration ? Can you make your own ice ? Do you need a cooler ? Is plenty of boat gas available ? A couple extra rods, reels and line. Check with the camp owner/manager to find out what you need for lures and fishing supplies. Good Luck , Have a great time. O - R"

1427820,new hips,2012-04-28 17:15:00,498,"After 25 trips, x2= best rain gear you can afford, waterproof boots a must. I bought a handheld GPS, + extra battery's. Portable fish locater, I have a waterproof gear bag that I keep with me at all times, lighter, whistle,camera. rain suit, netting,repellent, if you get stranded it will be a long night. Mouth spreaders for Northern. We boil the water and then run it thru a Micro filter back at the cabin. Fishing.........Early in the year look for any incoming flow they will stacked in that area. Beaver huts also if deeper water is nearby, most any point especially if in the wind. Follow the wind you will find the Walleye, narrows between two islands create a current flow. Summer.... look for mid lake reefs, we start at 12-15 ft were the jagged rocks are, then work your way out to 40ft, there always on the edges. keep it simple, small jigs and half crawler or leech, or best minnows, bottom bouncers with a few blades + half crawler, if the bite is off, use a lindy rig with 36in snell and live bait with slow presentation. Northerns...............basic Daredeville 1 oz spoons and 3/4 oz size, its all about color and size, add a twister tail as a trailer /white/yellow/orange. Johnson silver minnows Silver/gold, Mepps #5 spinners. Fish inside the weeds with the weedless, outside edge with the spoons letting it drop down 5-6 foot before retrieving. At least one Top water plug, If your onto Walleye and they stop biting the Northern are moving in, fan cast the entire area, they are very aggressive and not that fussy. You can troll shorelines with spoons or crank baits, don't overlook points and wind blowing into a shoreline. My experience says if it's calm and no waves your usually not catching much. I could go on forever, but you will enjoy every minute of the Canadian experience."

1550091,Duflebag,2013-03-11 17:17:00,218,"SportDog,I posted this a few weeks ago regarding what to bring.This will be my 24th trip to Northwinds Canadian Outfitters this year. I have taken both of my sons and many friends to visit the Munford family for the first time through the years. One constant question is what do I need to bring with me? I will attempt to answer this question the best I can using what I have learned through many years of fishing in Northwest Ontario and valuable experience shared by Brad and Scott Munford. First I want to say that those who know me will tell you that I don't necessarily follow everything I am going to tell you. You don't need to bring every piece of fishing tackle you own with you. Less is better, bring what you need and get to know how to use the tackle and techniques thoroughly. The better you know how to use your gear the better your chances are for locating and catching fish in a changing structure or pattern. Fishing in Northwest Ontario typically involves four species; walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass and musky. Generally speaking, you can successfully fish for all four species with two outfits. One spinning rig for Walleye and smallmouth bass and one bait casting rig for casting to northern pike and musky. As one gets more experienced you can add more specialized gear for specific species and patterns but you can catch the fish of a lifetime with just two good outfits. Of course equipment often does break making backup outfits a good idea. For those learning to fish the area, a shared use of backup equipment is a good idea. For walleye and smallmouth bass fishing a spinning rig is the way to go. A good quality 6 to 7 foot graphite medium light spinning rod with a fast action tip will work well. This is one area where buying higher quality equipment results in catching more fish. Many times fishermen miss walleye hits because they hit so light. A lack of sensitivity in the rod results in the fisherman not feeling the light tap of a walleye taking a minnow. I have seen many times a fisherman missing several walleye strikes changing to a more sensitive rod suddenly catching significantly more fish simply because they could feel bites they missed with the less sensitive rod. I recommend a minimum of an IM7 medium light spinning rod. A good quality spinning reel with a good drag in a 100 or 200 size is perfect for catching both walleye and smallmouth bass. Line capacity of 125 to 200 yards of 8 pound test is what you are looking for. To me one issue that takes a high priority in my tackle decisions is weight. I will be holding this outfit in my hand for many hours. The lighter the better on my hands, wrists, shoulders and back after many hours of casting and jigging. There are several store brand rods sold by Gander Mountain, Bass Pro Shops and Cabelas that are not expensive and are of a high quality. Shimano Spirex or Sahara and the Pflueger Supreme or President are all good quality reels that are not too expensive. For a few more dollars, A Pflueger Patriarch or St Croix Stradic matched up to a St Croix Premier rod would be a good combination. For fishing line, 8 pound test in green is a good choice. I personally have used Trilene XT in 8 pound green for many years and are happy with the performance. For northern pike and musky casting heavier bait casting rig is required. Again, you will be making many casts with this outfit so weight is important. You can really tire out your hands, wrists, shoulders and back while casting. A graphite 6 ½ to 7 foot medium heavy trigger casting rod with a fast action tip is a good starting rod for casting to both northern pike and musky. A heavier action bait-casting reel is needed to muscle in a big aggressive musky. Shimano Compre or St Croix musky Mojo or premier rods are good choices. A good starting reel choice would be an Abu Garcia C3 or C4 in the 5600 or 6500 size. These rods and reels have all proven themselves through the years to be tough and good for years of use. For fishing line, 80 or 100 pound test braid is a good choice. There are many brands of good quality braid line available. I have seen spiderwire stealth and power pro used commonly. For the size reels I have recommended a 300 yard spool is needed. Let's discuss the terminal tackle you will need to bring next. As I discussed earlier, we tend to bring a lot more than we will ever use. Many folks bring enough lures and tackle to fish one of the bass tournaments you see on TV. At the end of their fishing trip to Canada they realized that very little tackle was actually used to catch hundreds of fish with many of them trophy size. The truth is a small box will get you by in Canada. Sure you can bring the latest lures and try them out. You might catch fish but in my experience, I consistently catch more and bigger fish by using the simple techniques suggested by my guides. Jigs, hooks, sinkers and swivels in a small box will catch all the walleye and smallmouth bass I can handle. A few casting lures will work fine for catching a lot of northern pike and musky casting. Sure there are a lot of lures you can collect for musky and pike fishing but we are talking about what a person coming up for the first time should bring. Jigs in a few sizes for jigging for walleye and Smallmouth bass with the occasional hungry northern pike and musky causing havoc and excitement. Colors aren't as important as a quality hook in jigs. I have seen too many really nice fish lost because of a hook breaking or bending on a cheap jig. I have also seen just as many fish caught on plain lead unpainted jigs as fancy colors through the years. Sure there are sometimes where a particular color seems to catch more fish but not enough to require every color. I would rather spend my money on a jig with a quality hook built in that will not fail and cause me to lose a fish of a lifetime. For the most part an assortment of lead jigs with the majority in 1/4 and 3/8 ounce with a few in 1/8 and 1/2 ounce sizes is what you need. Bring enough for the week, as you will lose a lot to snags in rocks. The other rig you will use for walleye and smallmouth bass fishing is a live bait or lindy rig. Very simply, a lindy rig uses a sinker with a hole that allows line to run through it, a swivel to stop the sinker from sliding to the hook, a leader and a hook. I bring both number 1 and number 2 circle hooks and J hooks for lindy rigs. For sinkers, either walleye sinker or egg sinkers in 1/4, 3/8 and 1/2 ounce sizes. The items you should bring for casting to northern pike and musky are pretty simple for your first trip. A few 12-inch musky leaders in either fluorocarbon or wire with good cross lock snaps. A few 9-inch original bull dawgs. Walleye, black with orange tail and twinkie are traditionally good colors. 9-inch original suick thrillers. Black is the most used with fire tiger being next. A large one-ounce musky sized spinner bait with black skirt and nickel blades. One item that every person coming to Canada for a fishing trip should bring is a good rain suit. I have spent some wonderful weeks fishing in Canada where I have spent the entire week wearing my rain suit. Because I have worn decent rain suits through the years, those weeks have been pleasurable experiences rather than wet and cold ones. You don't need to spend a fortune. Good affordable rain suits like frogg toggs won't break the bank and will keep you dry if needed. When buying a rain suit think about being in that suit for a full day. Buy a suit that is made of breathable material. A rain suit that is not breathable will be miserable when worn for hours. When packing clothing for the trip think changing weather conditions. A day fishing in Canada might start out cold and rainy and turn hot and sunny mid day. The opposite can be true. Nothing makes a day fishing more unpleasant than not having appropriate clothes for the weather. Just because it is summer and there have been temperatures in the 100's does not mean that you won't see cold days in the 40's when you get there. Bring clothes from shorts and tee shirts to long pants and sweat shirts. Layers that can be added or taken off are the best bet as the conditions often change during the day. A dry bag of some type is also recommended. Something like a water proof gym bag to put your camera, sun block, extra clothes and other items. When I say waterproof I do not mean water-resistant. If water can get through or into something, it will on a fishing boat. A good pair of polarized sunglasses is a necessity. In sunglasses you get what you pay for. A good pair of sunglasses will allow you to see fish you will miss with a cheaper pair. You don't have to spend a fortune. There are many Internet articles on the subject and many great glasses for not a lot of money. Next to your tackle sunglasses are the next most important, especially when casting. Other items brought are up to the individual. Remember, you have to carry what you bring and it has to fit in the boat with the guide, fishermen and fishing tackle. Think what you need and what you will use, not what you have and can possibly bring. Some items to think of are a decent camera. Remember, it may get wet, sunscreen, insect repellant, a good knife, needle nose pliers or multitool, toilet paper in a plastic bag (several times vital), pain relievers like aspirin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen, fishing towel (you will get slimed), gloves, a hat to screen the sun and a spare, Extra line, back up fishing tackle (things will break, get lost and go over the side), something to drink both on the boat and at night in the cabin, snacks if you want them, a cooler for your drinks and to bring fish home (for on the boat, smaller is better), your passport for the border, clothes from shorts and tee shirts to long johns, long sleeve shirts, sweat shirts, jacket and spare shoes or boots because they may get wet. The last thing to bring is a good attitude. Leave work and problems at home, you are on vacation. Enjoy the scenery. Look for the wildlife. Learn to be a better fisherman from your guide. Share stories with your friends. Bring your children and grandchildren so that they can enjoy this wonderful experience. Life is much faster paced these days. Going on a fishing trip to Northwest Ontario forces you to slow down, enjoy the day going on around you and enjoy the people you are with. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ttons/edit.gif"

1436851,dan cardinal,2012-05-17 11:54:00,64,"There is tons of great advise here. As far as fishin', I could add a bunch more...but here is my contribution: On one of those ultra calm days...out in the middle of lake...the surface is like a mirror...turn off your engine...close your eyes...and don't do anything....just set there...take some deep breaths...then attempt to hear a sound. The tranquillity is quite amazing and awesome... it's what I hope Heaven is like."
1450464,Sportdog,2012-06-17 20:42:00,6735,"I arrived home yesterday morning after 25 1/2 hours straight of driving and riding. The trip was great and all the information that I received here proved to be pretty spot on. The border crossing was smooth both ways but the guys in the other car with us had to pull over and pay duty on extra alcohol. Observation for those beer drinkers out there. A case of beer sells for $39.00 at The Beer Store in Canada. Duty on a case of beer brought in from the US was around $9.00. You do the math. LOL! I'm not much of a drinker so it made no difference to me. Wildewood Camp was just as the web site described it with a great staff, and well maintained boats and motors. Those 15HP electric start Honda outboards gained a lot of respect from this Mercury boy. We never fished for lake trout and caught pike as incidental to our walleye presentations. Thank the Good Lord for the advice on the rain gear and light rubber high boots. Five days of rain and wind put them to the test and they passed with flying colors. Our largest walleyes were in the 25 inch range and shore lunch happened for three of our five days of fishing. We had two days of fantastic fishing, one day of OK fishing, and two days that we had to work very hard for our walleyes. Most of our fish were caught on jig and live minnows but our bigger fish we caught on cranks and crawler harnesses while trolling. We saw lots of eagles and a couple black bears but no moose or woodland caribou. We fought rain and wind all week, I mean every day, but I still had a great time. Only time will tell if I go to Canada fishing again but it was a great experience and I'm really glad that I went. Thanks again guys for all the helpful advice, and a special shout out to Pooch. If anyone has any questions please feel free to PM me and I'll do my best to give you good information."

1454290,Bitinlight,2012-06-26 10:12:00,95,"All of the information posted so far is excellent. Good waterproof foot wear in addition to the best rainsuit you can afford is vital. Also, check to see what kind of seats are available in the boats. You will be spending a ton of time in the boat and a comfortable seat is important. If there are no seats but bench seats, find something portable that has a good back rest that you can bring and your time in the boat will be alot more pleasurable. Good luck."

1430882,Larry Mac,2012-05-04 21:26:00,530,"Hi Sportdog, IMHO it is not so much what you will bring as what you will bring back. I am so excited for you as you are about to have a truly amazing experience. I can remember my first Canadian Wilderness Adventure (many adventures ago) like it was yesterday. It was to Whiteshell Provincial Park in Manitoba. I certainly was not prepared in the least. It was in September and the weather was horrendous. It was cold, windy, sleeting and raining the whole time. We had to dip our rods in the water to get the ice out of the eyes LOL. I had nothing but yellow PVC raingear and old leather work boots. I wore plastic bread bags over my socks to try to keep my feet dry. I had a Zebco 33 for my casting reel and an inexpensive spinning reel on an ugly stick for my walleye rod but man did we catch the fish. A lot has changed since then, but one thing I must say with all honesty. That trip truly changed my life. I have not missed a year since and try to go multiple times a year. I do agree that being prepared will enhance your adventure. Sportdog enjoy every moment and have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"

1433092,Cumberland,2012-05-09 11:04:00,3,"Like Sportdog and Bennies, I am 58 going to Canada in August for the first time, Booi's on Trout Lake. We'll be fishing for walleye, northerns, and lake trout, none of which I have any experience with. My brother and I are flying to Red Lake and one of the drawbacks is the weight limit from Winnipeg to Red Lake, 40 pounds. I'm shipping rods and tackle in advance, as much as possible. I've read this thread, and there is lots of good advice, but anything anyone else can add would be great."
1433106,Mohleye,2012-05-09 11:30:00,368,"Cumberland, My advice to you would be that unless you have some experienced fishermen in your group, I would hire a guide for at least a day or two. Catching fish in a remote fly in like Trout Lake isn't terribly hard, but it's a whole lot easier if you have the chance to learn techniques and locations firsthand from someone who knows the water. If guides aren't available I would ask for plenty of help from the owner or his staff. You will have a great time anyway, but you'll have a lot more fun if you have decent catching. I've not been to Booi's but know people who have and they speak highly of it. I'm sure they will give you the help you need. With a 40 lb weight limit, I would also be in close contact with them to find out what you don't need to bring. Good raingear would be my top priority."
1433594,BW,2012-05-10 10:21:00,1816,"Sportdog: Not sure I can add to all the excellent advice but I would want to know one thing if I were you: does the boat you're using have a mounted seat with a back? If not, you may want to look into one of those clamp on swivel seats or something with a back that you can bring/use. A week in a boat with no comfortable seat will destroy almost any healthy back...."
1433634,Cumberland,2012-05-10 11:55:00,3,"Mohleye,Excellent advice. I beleive they run a Mon- Thurs guide service, where a guide in a separate boat puts you on the spot, etc. Thanks."
1433650,new hips,2012-05-10 12:59:00,498,"Cumberland, with the limited weight, your going to have to go pretty basic. The Lakers will be deep, 40-50ft, use a 4oz bell sinker on a 3way swivel, preferably line counter reel so you can duplicate line depth. You can use some Silver or Gold spoons with a 6ft snell. Some of the same spoons that are good for Northern will work for Lakers as well. You can get away with 50 midsize jigs and 25 / 3in White Twister Tails. If they have live bait....use it, minnows are best, but half crawler will be almost as good. Get yourself some quality snaps and swivels, 1 good leader, Titanium or Fluorocarbon. Your weight adds up in a hurry, every year I find myself cutting back on Tackle. Have a Great trip................"

1429342,Rivratz,2012-05-01 15:19:00,105,"SDog, Last year a pike I hooked viciously shook as I was trying to unhook the final of the three treble hooks in it. The violent shake lodged one of the hooks deep in my finger. Needless to say, no way to pull it out because the barb doesn't go backward. The needlenose tool with snips couldn't work because of how deep it was sunk in. I had to drive 40 miles to the Kenora Wal-Mart for snips. I just used the tool in the aisle and put it back on the shelf. Then I went to the Kenora Medical Center to get the barb surgically removed. $500.00 dollars for a 15 min surgery with a 5 hour wait in the waiting room. I should have used my filet knife to get it out. I was too worried about infection as I still had 10 more days left. I would look silly holding that lure for the rest of my trip."
1429363,new hips,2012-05-01 16:18:00,498,"That's why I put single hooks on all my spoons, pinch down the barbs on all baits before using. Trust me you will not lose fish. Keep the Northern in the water, and with one twist usually released without incident, don't bring them in the boat if at all possible. I've been using single hooks on all my swim baits also, and for my cranks, once they show me a preference, I take off the front treble and replace the back with a single hook."
1429396,tooski,2012-05-01 17:51:00,393,"If you fish Canada long enough you are going to get hooked on a release or a cast. Like Riv I was hooked in an area that could not be pushed through. We soaked my thumb in ice water till it was numb and cut it out with a dismantled bic razor. Barbless ever since. Yes, I lose a few but not enough to make me change. Better for the fish also."
1430129,Rivratz,2012-05-03 08:29:00,105,"I agree with New Hips, I never bring a caught pike in the boat, ever! The protective slime on the fish comes off and damages the fishes natural ability that protects it against diseases. Just like bark protects trees from disease. Another big reason is that the slime is the best black biting fly attractant! Don't want it in my boat. Afraid to go totally barbless because of losing a trophy fish after I just probably threw 3 thousand casts to hook one!"
1430173,tooski,2012-05-03 09:59:00,393,"So Riv, you release them properly to avoid injury but you leave the barbs on? Not judging, just curious as to what appears to be a contradiction. Of all the fish you want to release unharmed aren't the trophies at the top of the list? I applaud you for releasing the fish outside of the boat. Pictures of guys holding large northerns on their cabin decks always bother me. What, you are going to eat it?"
1430200,Rivratz,2012-05-03 10:54:00,105,"Tooski, Try very hard to handle all fish with the greatest of care after being caught. I even say a small prayer for the minnow when I am threading a hook through it when baiting. Ok, worms and leeches also. Ever watch the fishing shows? Those guys ""pro's"" catch fish and just toss them overboard. Yeah, even Babe Winkleman is totally guilty! I gently put each fish in the water and make sure that they are 100% revived and are able too swim away. Hoping someone else will get a chance to catch it later. Maybe that should be a new thread? How do you handle your caught fish? If a walleye swallows the hook, I just cut the line and retie another hook. The hook will eventually be spit out in a few days. As for Northern Pike? You do know that they are a Poor Man's lobster dinner!"
1430241,new hips,2012-05-03 12:50:00,498,"I don't believe most people understand the mortality rate, if you catch 200 x5 people in a group = 1000 fish in a week, how many die, especially as the water warms. I think you have to be naive to think a percentage will not die after release. I once spent over a hour to revive a large Northern caught while Walleye fishing with lite tackle, in this case I was on Lac Seul and had to release even though I knew it would die. Proper release, and cut the line on deep hooked fish. Nothing worse than killing a potential Trophy fish."
1430372,Rivratz,2012-05-03 19:04:00,105,"Trophy and Big Fiish are rarely ever hooked that well. It alway's seems that the Big Ones aren't hooked at all after they have been netted. The fish law of Murphy! Yes, I net them in the water, and let them thrash in the water, then asses the situation. These posts should have been its own thread. Sorry!"
1430839,Walleye Wanderer,2012-05-04 19:52:00,101,"Couple of things Agree totally with #1, most important to be dry. LOL, agree with #3 that Canucks are a pretty friendly bunch (i am). Just a thought with the money, if you regularly or yearly come up, can you open a Canadian account in your US bank and buy Can. dollars when it is more in your favour? Thats what I do with the US buck and it works out pretty well and the exchange seems to bounce back and forth in favour of both lately. As for the water, I agree don't sip directly from the lake no matter how far north you are beavers still poop in it. If you boil a pot for five minutes then run it though a Brita filter and then chill it, it works quite nicely. The five minute rolling boil will take care of any possible nasties. Lastly, you are right about the border guards, I have found the American border guys a lot more enjoyable than are Canadians who seem a little uptight. Cheers and enjoy your trip to the great white north!"
1428343,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-29 20:54:00,235,"Bring a fly swatter...bring it in the boat for when then ankle biter black flies appear. Murder them as needed. Bring some foam weather stripping with adhesive on one side. Put a strip on the side of the boat (inside, maybe 12-18 inches) and hang some extra jigs and lures from it. Good to have them at the ready when you need to re-tie. Much easier than having to open and close a tackle tray ( and therefore risk spilling jigs all over the floor of your boat). Someone in a group before us added this to the boats we used in our fly in and it was very handy...but you may want to verify that this is ok with the outfitter. If anchors are not provided, bring a durable mesh sack and load it with round rocks. I got two such sacks at REI and double bagged them. If you double bag them and use rounded, not jagged, rocks, these should last a while. Single sack and or rocks with sharp edges will tear easilly. I personally like having several marker buoyies in the boat. I like driving around humps and marking the edges in several places before fishing it. That's just me, though."
1428346,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-29 21:07:00,235,"And I almost forgot...bring a roll of toilet paper. Others have mentioned sealed waterproof bags. If you plan to venture far away from camp, throw the toilet paper in there. Sometimes the previous night's beer and fried walleye wants out, and it's often preferable to go to shore and use the woods rather than spend an uncomfortable half hour (or more) driving back to camp."
1428461,Mohleye,2012-04-30 08:01:00,368,"Sounds like you have it covered. Listen to Pooch. I would not switch to braid if you are used to mono. It has advantages and disadvantages, but stick with what you know."
1428478,wallydave,2012-04-30 08:19:00,2151,"The first trip can be a true learning experiance! I wish I had known about Walleye Central before my first trip! After all of the pointers and tips so far, I would like to remind you as others have done. Take some time each day to reflect on the whole trip. Embrace the Canadian experiance, the quiet, the adventure, overcoming some of the challenges, laugh with the group, make some memories all of these things will help make the trip for you! One word of caution! This trip may be your first, but if you get ""hooked"", it might not be your last!"
1428511,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-30 08:56:00,725,"Here is my take, have some udder butter or heavy duty hand cream. At the end of the week, especially at your age (you said you were 61), will be cracked and have various hook and fin pokes. Make sure you have plenty of band aids and something to cut barbed treble hook point when you hook your fingers together (You might be able to tell by my name that I have some experience here) A little lydocain to numb the fingers doesnt hurt either. Remember, other than smallies Canadian fish have teeth so don't stick your fingers in their mouths and watch out for till plates on walleye. I am a big fan of the rubber net. The way the pike spin in a nylon net can make it seem like hours to get them unhooked, a picture taken and back in the water while still gillin'. Cigars- jeez i could not stand running out of cigars when I am there. Some kind of weight to sink your beers if the MNR plane lands on your lake. That can get pricey. Peanuts in the shell- a must while trolling. I agree with the advice about toilet paper. After sacrificing several t-shirts through the years, I always have a roll of tp with me. And don't forget your camera so you can take a picture of your partner when he borrows your roll of toilet paper so you can make fun of him. Make sure your knives are sharp, that way when you cut your finger while cleaning fish the would can be repaired with Duct tape, don't forget the duct tape. A magazine or two for helping you get rid of yesterday's meal quicker in the outhouse- works for me. Make sure you have the bailing bucket in the boat- you are too old to pee off the boat without making a mess. I am at work right now so I will have plenty of time to think of other things and I'll get back to you."
1428512,Sanderv,2012-04-30 08:56:00,63,"Yes, Canada uses same alternating current voltage as the U.S. I've been to that camp before and it is pretty nice having electricity for recharging things."
1428668,erieangler,2012-04-30 12:30:00,57,Don't forget your pfd and a couple throwables to use for seat cusions. A few hand tools for unexpected repairs . A small pair of bolt cutters in the event a fish hooks you. enjoy your trip
1428728,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-30 13:53:00,235,"In addition to the bailing bucket (cut milk carton does the job), get a large sponge. Gets the remaining water that can't be scooped. Recommend one per boat."
1428747,Sportdog,2012-04-30 14:21:00,6735,The response has been so great I've started a notepad that I list each recomendation. By the time it's finished I believe I will be well prepared with all the help from you gentlemen. Thanks so much!
1428751,camp chef,2012-04-30 14:33:00,915,"For drive in camps like you are going to,I have a tupperware container that I bring on all Candaian trips. These are things that may or may not be needed. steak knives,grill tools, rubber bands, extra cans of veggies,hot sauce, cork screw, tape, pens and paper, skeeter spray,aluminum foil,cards,cocktail picks,antacid, beer coozies, stick matchs, garbage bags,freezer bags etc.mouse traps,candles,shoe laces,etc. Most things stay in the box even when not in Canada."

1427923,Sportdog,2012-04-28 22:23:00,6735,Thank you. I sent you a PM.
1427996,Bill Krejca,2012-04-29 07:35:00,6107,"I like to pack my stuff in large plastic bins, duct taped secure. This keeps clothers, etc, dry, for traveling a distance longer than from the vehicle to the cabin. Weather can be anywhere form 30 degrees to 85. Bring along some cold weather gear. A rain coat and pants are a must, but don't make the mistake of expecting to wear tennis shoes when it rains. I like ankle high leather boots, useful for keeping bugs off the ankles, also. Wool socks and cut-off gloves , long johns are useful. Don't forget that you generally can't just go to the store if you need something, so make a list of stuff you use at home and determine whether this stuff needs to go with. Listen to Pooch, he knows about which he talks! Have fun! Bill Krejca"
1428078,elway12,2012-04-29 10:26:00,335,"Ditto on Pooch. He knows his stuff AND fishing at Savant. It is a great camp, lake, and great people. Anything Pooch doesn't help with give me a PM. We have gone there 4 times."
1428103,new hips,2012-04-29 11:57:00,498,"Most of the fishing that I do does not involve rocky structure. Excluding my Dipsey Diver rods for salmon on Lake Michigan, all my other rods I use monofiliment line. Do you think I need to switch to braid? I figure that I will switch to braid for my jigging rod and maybe for a bottom bouncing baitcaster outfit but just put fresh mono on my two rods for casting. Does that sound reasonable? Thanks for the tips.Well it's pretty much all rocks up there, I use 6lb fireline on my jigging and lindy rigs, sensitivity is unreal, no line twist either. Small diameter = less water resistance and lighter weights to a achieve desired depth. You can go to Fireline cyrstal with 18in of florocarbon dropper when jigging also. I use 8-10lb florocarbon for all my snells. Mono on your baitcasting will work fine, but get quality snap swivels to avoid line twist. I use Power Pro on all my baitcasting reels because of it's strength. Bad part about braid that it's hard to break when snagged, solution is to use lighter aberdeen hooks, they will bend and come free. Always try to stay fairly vertical when jigging or 45deg when bottom bouncing. Don't get cheap with your snaps swivels or leaders. I caught a 40in Northern on 6lb Fireline on Lac Seul with no leader !!!!"

1428198,Nimstug,2012-04-29 17:03:00,2605,"Sportdog. Congratulations on your first trip to the Canadian Shield! We're pretty much contemporaries and am looking forward to another trip with my son in September. I'll toss a few items out for consideration in no particular order. 1. Take along a 'trip coordinator.' Someone who'll make sure you don't bring too many of one item (salt shakers) and not enough of another item (t.p.) 2. Flashlight or head light. On my first trip a flashlight wasn't on the list and I put one in the car only because I saw one in the garage when I was closing the door. It's dark-dark up there. 3. I respectfully disagree with Octane. Pitch in and help out, even if you are not assigned to do something that day or meal. More hands working more time for fishing. And guys who don't help out tend not to get invited on the next trip. The Canada 'Eh board is full of stories about slackers. 4. When you go through customs, roll down the front and back windows and everyone take off the sunglasses so the agent can see in and see everybody. 4A. Thank the agent for their work. They won't remember you next time but it may make it easier for the guys behind you. 4B. Make sure the guy who answers the custom agent's questions is wearing hearing aids if he has a hearing problem. We didn't do that a couple of years ago. Our guy gave the right answers but it was not for the questions that were asked. 5. Take along a small notebook and pencil. The notebook I use is 7x5. I use it to make sketches of places I've caught fish, how we did that day, and general thoughts and impressions. I use it to remind me of stuff to tell the wife when I get home. 6. For each boat's emergency kit, make sure you have some fire starter materials like small candles or 3"" strips of rolled newspaper soaked in wax. This site has some other ideas. http://www.lovetheoutdoors.com/campi...restarters.htm 7. Hooded heavy duty zipper sweatshirt. Cabelas sells them with a waffle type lining. 8. If your group hasn't decided how to handle money and food, this thread will help: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hlight=nimstug Stay safe on the water. Nimstug"
1428208,Blue Lk,2012-04-29 17:23:00,269,"As a local around your age I can give some rules to live by up here.#1 Be prepared for both extremes of weather (very hot & humid/cold & wet)#2 Take time to sit back & enjoy the sights &sounds,sunrise,sunset,stars,loons & the sometimes the silence.#3 Enjoy,it is not allways about the fish.#4 Canadian beer & whisky is pretty good stuff."
1428209,SinOrSwim,2012-04-29 17:24:00,1528,"Rain Gear!!!!!! Like others have said. You almost have to get the bib overall pants and then a good rain jacket. Nothing worse than having your jacket ride up your back when you sit down and having water run down your backside.Also, I don't take pants or only take one pair. I wear shorts and then put my rain gear on when it's cold. That way, I can take them off when it warms up during the day. Plus, it saves on packing. I can wipe my hands on my rain gear.DRY BAG!!!!! A good dry bag is a must as well. You WILL get wet in those boats even if it's not raining. Keeping your stuff dry is a big key. Also, waterproof boots because the bottom of your boat WILL get water in it. Guaranteed! Notice my theme? Staying and keeping stuff dry makes things much simpler. Flashlight, we have found the head lamsp you can get at walmart and other places are bright and they only take either AA or AAA batteries. Plus, makes it handy to put on your head for cleaning fish or cooking outside."
1428228,Pokstermania,2012-04-29 18:00:00,1,"In Canada bug repellent is good, but stink can cause fish to stop biting, long pants and shirts work better. If your in northwestern Ontario the killer is blackflies. I don't think any amount of spray stops them, but good boots do just fine. I jig with mono up to 35 feet and braid beyond that. Casting for pike or musky is always braid, 20-40 pound is best.I like raps, lip less cranks, wally divers. All work great on different days for Northerns, bass, and walleye.Jigs and little joe's for walleye. Last summer we killed walleyes on spinners (white and yellow). Depends what they want.I have never brought my own pans. If you're flying in, it takes to much weight. I would rather have a few more lures than a pan, but that might be me.GPS is great to have. As are depth finders. Many lodges rent them and they are a must.Most of all bring a camera. The fish of a lifetime is one cast away. Good luck!"
1427898,Sportdog,2012-04-28 20:56:00,6735,"Yes, Wildewood Resort and there are six of us going and none have any experience doing this to my knowledge. I'm a late addition to the dance as one of the six on tap to go had a new job and the time wasn't available to him. I only know two of the other five guys. We will be there on June 9th I believe for a week. I'm guessing that it will be pretty cold that far north in early June. I've been reading the information from the resort web site and have gathered a lot of information there but I figure there are guys on WC that may give me some information that may be very helpful. Thanks for the posts so far and please keep them coming or PM if you prefer."
1427903,Sportdog,2012-04-28 21:06:00,6735,Camp operates on generator power. Does Canada operate on 120/240 volt system like the US? I do plan on taking a good supply of batteries. I think that we should take some of those two way radios for sharing fishing information with the other boats also.
