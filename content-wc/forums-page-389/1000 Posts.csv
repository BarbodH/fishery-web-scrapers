1544489,Mike Kansas,2013-02-28 08:50:00,1463,Finally got to my 1000th post. Never dreamed it when I joined up in 2004. It has been a great ride and I really enjoy all the contacts with all the lovers of Walleye Fishing. Walleye Central is a gift to us all and the avaliable information from fellow fisherman does make us all better fisherman and unites us in a great sport. Mike Kansas
