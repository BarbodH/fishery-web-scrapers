1549187,RapShad,2013-03-09 18:22:00,76,I started using a white Xrap for pike and smallies at the end of our trip last year and did very well on all species. It is starting to become a go to lure for me now.
1544487,MrSimon,2013-02-28 08:49:00,922,We have also had great luck with blue and silver lures when trolling. What the heck is in these lakes with a bright blue back and silver sides?
1544772,jaximus,2013-02-28 18:20:00,117,"the rapala BX minnow looks really neat. i already have 3 cuz i found them mismarked in a clearance bin! go me! the scatter rap also looks very intriguing, probably will go minnow body on those to start"
1544810,Gipper,2013-02-28 20:00:00,76,Why new baits when I have silver Walley Divers for June fishing? Did I mention silver Wally Divers? I thought so.
1544819,zeebee,2013-02-28 20:19:00,1144,I'm less engaged with trying the new offerings than with trying to perfect fishin the tried and true. There is such a plethora of effective cranks out there that will troll to 30' (my self imposed limit for chasing eyes; anything deeper is called a laker and destined for the BBQ) that I find myself focusing more on the conditions (ie the time of year and weather conditions) on a given body of water. Fishin is fun in no small part cause we keep learnin...even those of us with lazy spellin.

1545254,BornToFish,2013-03-01 14:44:00,1224,"I fish on Perrrault Lake in north west Ontario during August and September. I've tried trolling for walleyes a handful of times, with very little success. I can say that I don't have much confidence based on what I have tried and the results so far. I've tried trolling cranks along weed edges during August and September and caught a few walleyes doing this and many small northern pike. I've had no luck trolling the abysss for suspended walleyes. I've done better fishing the rock humps while vertical jigging. Nevertheless, I suspect that many of the bigger walleyes are likely suspended during this time of the year.Can you guys offer suggestions on how to go about establishing a trolling pattern during August/September on the Canada Shield? What type of water should I be targeting to find walleyes? Is there a particular depth, speed, lure profile, etc. that have worked for you during this time of the year? It could be that I am hampered by only being able to legally run one or two rods from the boat.Many thanks for sharing...."

1545699,18wheeler,2013-03-02 17:34:00,2,I fish the English River downstream of you. I love trolling cranks. Two suggestions. Don't be afraid to try different speeds. Usually any faster than 3.5mph is pike only. BUT one year in July 4.0-4.5mph with #9 shadraps over 35 to 45 feet of water was the ticket for suspended walleye. Discovered this when I sped up to turn around. Second don't be afraid of big cranks. My favorite lure for big eyes is the super shadrap.
1545845,Ranger319,2013-03-03 06:31:00,166,"Wife went out of town and left me alone with the credit card...Got some new Taildancers, FlickerShads, and some 832 in white. I'm praying the 832 isn;t as god awful as fireline crystal!"
1545889,tooski,2013-03-03 08:04:00,393,"Guessing you mean 832? If so, no worries. You'll be very happy with it."
1544262,Ranger319,2013-02-27 17:55:00,166,"Well Cabin Fever has beyond set in at my house. Wife is ready for the boat to come back home so she can have her kitchen table back. For some reason she doesn't like having to move Flicker Shads in order to set a plate on the table. Anyway, what new lures are you guys and gals going to try out this year? Maybe not a new lure but a new technique? I bought a few new Flicker Shads as well as a handful of Taildancers. Last year on Lac Seul I finally spent a little time trolling cranks and HAMMERED the eyes. So this year I am going to dedicate a good portion of my trip trolling cranks. Oh might as well add that I will explore new areas of Lac Seul...been saying that for 15 years and its happened once."
1544276,northerneyes,2013-02-27 18:28:00,72,What part of Lac Seul are you fishing or what lodge do you use?
1544277,Ranger319,2013-02-27 18:31:00,166,East side. We stay at Red Pine in Sioux Lookout.
1544297,zeebee,2013-02-27 19:19:00,1144,Boy did I add cranks...trolling be my modus operandi when chasing big eyes. I found a mom & pop in southern Ont and picked up 28 NOS Risto Raps just as I was running low.....should be good for a bit. Then added a dozen+ deep taildancer 11's ; another dozen DHJ 12's and 9 DHJ 10's. Whats the secret to successfully acquiring cranks......... avoid marriage/stay single. Funny thing about cranks....the more you have ...the more you want. Call it a bad case of GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome).
1544366,adempsey,2013-02-27 22:29:00,963,"Storm and Rapala alone have a bunch of new cranks. Heck, I haven't even tried the new ones from the past year. Really interested in the Rapala Scatter Rap series. I'd also like to get back into using inline spinners and spoons more often. Not sure why I don't fish with them more often."
1544409,Babamel2,2013-02-28 06:30:00,414,"Have any of you tried the new Lindy Shadlings? If so, how do you rate them?"
1544423,NathanH,2013-02-28 06:53:00,697,"Rapala Mini Crank, Storm Smash Shad, and Rapala Scatter Minnow should be the new lures I try this year. That said I have spent a good part of my winter stocking up on Fat Raps and tracking down Risto Raps. Risto's became on of my favorite lures to cast last year. Like them better then their replacement the DT series."
1544434,orchard frank,2013-02-28 07:19:00,1900,"Spent a lot of weeks at Lac Seul over a 13 year stretch. I have always liked fishing cranks, trolling or casting, so I did a lot of experimenting up there. My favorite quickly became the Hot N Tot, especially any of the colors with gold. Gold and Pink #1. Loud rattles call them in, can cast it a mile, bounce it off rocks on points and reefs, can get down deep on a long line. Pike love them too, so I ran a home-made thin wire leader, didn't bother the eyes at all. One of my favorite ways to fish (there are lots of favorite ways up there), was to anchor on a shallow part of a reef during a good wind, and cast Tots all around. Wife preferred bobber/jig during these times, she also caught a million. Good Luck"
1544443,MrSimon,2013-02-28 07:34:00,922,"I tied up a bunch of crawler harnesses in all different colors. I've never really used them before and I'm excited to give it a try. I'm also really interested in using Berkely BladeDancers for pike fishing. The wobble action of those things are amazing. Lastly, I just bought all the supplies to paint my own crankbaits and spoons .... it would be amazing to catch something on a lure I painted myself."
1544478,Babamel2,2013-02-28 08:33:00,414,"I have had a lot of luck with Blue & Silver Wallydivers and with Hot-n-tots. however, in recent years the hot-n-tots have not done as well as a few years ago."
