1544072,northerneyes,2013-02-27 10:53:00,72,My wife and I are planning on taking our daughter and husband on a fishing trip in northwest Ontario. I have made several trips for fishing and moose hunting but it is all fairly new to the others. Our daughter has a small dog that she just has to take with her. Any suggestions for a housekeeping resort that is pet friendly. Thanks
