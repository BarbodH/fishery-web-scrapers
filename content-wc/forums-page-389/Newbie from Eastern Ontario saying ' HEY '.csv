Must be nice to be thinking about ""opener."" Clearly the weather down there is very different from NW Ontario. Literally just finished putting a lickin on jumbo perch and walleye this evening but we are not even close to thinking about fishing anything other than hard water. Love it when I get into the big perch but by the time I finish cleaning about 10 I find myself wishing that I had shown some restraint. Anyhow, big bag of boneless waiting for the oil."
1321712,WATER-WERX,2011-06-23 09:57:00,6,"Just a newbie saying HEY to everyone. Hope everyone has a great summer of fishing and catches a MONSTER!Spent my childhood summers at our family cottage on Joe's Lake in Lanark Country fighting off blackflies and mosquitoes while fishing off the same old rock - had more patience back then, and now wish the family would have never sold that cottage! Our camp was at the dam where Joe's Lake butts up to Widows?/Willows? Lake. (It was a spawning site and I remember those glowing eyes by flashlight... thougth that was wicked KOOL as a kid ) Widows lake that butted to the dam on the WEST side ends at the other end behind FLOWER STATION and the old General store up on the hill , ( the Crosby's owned that for years, Mrs Crosby had like 19 kids.. man she must have been a ripper in bed!! ) man do I remember those times, locals use to spear 13lb walleye at that creek and as an early by-heart conservationist I was too young and without a cell phone or any know how to rat them out to the MNR coppers L! Knew it was wrong then and later in life while watching Aboriginals spearing monster walleye at Quinte, hundreds of trophies lying on the shores full of holes some with just cheeks removed I seen enough and gave up fishing completely Grew up, worked in the Gov't for 16years before starting my own business, now help thousands of clients coast to coast here in Canada with everything ATV to TOP FUEL - Now back into fishing after a local here in the Prescott/Cardinal area had to hype up the Walleye fishing on the St Lawrence. Pictures of stringers full of 8lb walleyes from here on the river blew my mind!!! A new rod/reel in hand I'm back at my BUCKET LIST which includes a walleye over 8 1/2 lbs. When I was 6-7 at that cottage over 35 years ago I caught one that size with a toy fishing rod - the old man kept telling me I was hooked on bottom until the big gurl ( plastic worm harness in corner of jaw ) came up and rolled at the side of the boat... then he went ape ****! L!Now with St Lawrence Seaway topographical map #1435 in hand I'm back on the HUNT! in the span of one map from the Iroquois locks to the Brockville narrows some of the best freshwater fishing for Bass, Walleye/Pike and Musky ( plus Sturgeon, channel perch and catfish! ). This is also the location of the famed Oswegatchie River which has been stocked for decades with millions of Walleye fingerlings. Record spawns have been recorded in recent years by MNR on the upstate New York side and all those spawing walleye get backed up into the river here with nowhere to go but the end of a rod! WOOT WOOT!!I'm sure many of you have such stories of why Walleye fishing has you HOOKED - that's mineCheers to allSpenc"
1321816,phishfearme,2011-06-23 13:48:00,1242,welcome to the best canadian walleye board that there is - you'll notice thought that the main focus on this board will be northwesern ontario mainly because most of us prefer a wilderness walleye experience which gets harder to find in the east. but reports and threads from all over are welcome. phish

1322340,WATER-WERX,2011-06-24 19:08:00,6,"much appreciate the invite amigo but the Mohawks or whatever 'band' it is up there totally turned me off the area. We spent alot of time on that water respecting our quota's, being conservationists for the future, the ignorance that our society allows for in this day in age for those crybabies absolutely makes me personally ""SICK""they always call here crying the blues demanding price breaks/tax exempt breaks etc etc while the rest of us are busting our a##es off paying 13% for 'everything'Grow up, it's 2011 get an 'fin job like everyone else on this planet I say and stop LIVING OFF THE MANyes I have the Kahona's to say itbut hey, rock out and have fun fishing!"
