1550024,wallydave,2013-03-11 14:48:00,2151,And was was a running back...back in the day!
1550208,redgoose99,2013-03-11 20:18:00,443,Now that's awesome!
1550238,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-03-11 21:20:00,84,"Cents I am so tupid I guess I shouldn't have outta been beloging to this here site. May be I should find me one of those tell sites calles bas central or some such thing. Or maybe I should by some of them there jigs and some red worms or something and trol around some sinken rocks all day. By the.way that cabbage tastes good the way my grandmammie used it cook it up. Them bas ain't got no teeth neither, lots easier on the thumb then those there waleyes. All in good fun."
1550330,MrSimon,2013-03-12 06:54:00,922,"I don't know about this ..... Walleye fishermen = sitting in a little tin boat on some desolate lake in 40 degree weather, bobbing around in the wind, under gray cloudy skies, fishing a tiny little jig head tipped with a leech just sitting on the bottom .... waiting to catch a fish that fights like an old boot. That doesn't sound very smart to me! But it sure as heck sounds fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!"
1550651,Guest,2013-03-12 15:18:00,0,"Actually, Carp fisherman are the smartest. They don't spend a lot on fishing gear. They don't have to travel a great distance and spend a lot on gas. They don't need a boat, just a lawn chair will do. Corn works fine or a cheap secret recipe. Carp fight hard, are easy to catch and nobody eats them so you don't get all smelly cleaning them. After fishing or while your fishing you can eat a bunch of fried chicken. Now that's what I call smart."

1550720,drlee,2013-03-12 17:39:00,409,"And another thing: Walleye fishermen have to be VERY patient...or, as my old pal Ed Potts, from Norfork, Arkansas would say...""A good pointer don't run through a covey."" (Norfork is just north of Izzard County)"
1550871,zeebee,2013-03-12 21:50:00,1144,A covey is to birds what a school is to fish so....it stands to reason that you can run thru a covey(school) if your cranks is big enuff......just say'in.
1550932,LLewellin,2013-03-13 05:41:00,1790,"Let me see...... Boat costs $30K+, gear costs $2500+, rented cabin $300+ per day, beer costs...can't remember how much and bait (with the new DNR regs) costs $25+ per day and I get to keep 4 walleyes under 18"" which when cleaned nets out to be about 2.5# of PURE EXCELLENCE! Yes, walleye fisher man are much smarter My better half would argue just the opposite but then walleye fishing does keep me out of the bars and from chasing women"
1548790,zeebee,2013-03-08 18:23:00,1144,"There was a recent study completed by the Ministry of Ontario Resources which found walleye fisherman to occupy a ""higher"" level of intelligience as compared to bass fishermen. Evidence cited included... less use of pricey fluorocarbon and plain colored outerwear(aint friggin NASCAR). Simple jigs (as opposed to $20 swimbaits) and affinity towards better tablefare were also noted. There was also something about the difference between a fish and a fish in a 40 lbs clump of cabbage... Cant seem to find the site right now but will post same as soon as I find it. ...Interestingly, their next study is apparently on Musky fishermen and as part of the assesment they plan on sending Musky fisherman a survey. Early returns suggest only one in a thousand will ellicit a response. Ever press your tongue on your cheek tll it hurts?"
1548893,Gunner_Fletch,2013-03-09 04:56:00,74,"WOW....is all I can respond to that! If?....what you say is true , and the ministry conducted a useless study on such a ......? (I can't even find a politically correct word to mention).....then that's just another fine example of our useful tax dollars for some idiots to sit around a table and study such a ludicrous subject..! WOW, WOW and WOW! Further....to even entertain commenting on the subj makes me wonder....just sayin."
1548908,WALLEYE651,2013-03-09 05:50:00,252,"the answer is simple ""yes"""

1548971,Skywagon,2013-03-09 09:04:00,1106,"More time has been spent bass fishing rather than honing reading skills/comprehension, it would seem."
1549029,Bill Krejca,2013-03-09 10:32:00,6107,"As further proof, there is the sworn testimony of thousands of bass fishermen who had someone read the study to them. Bill"
1549043,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-03-09 11:14:00,358,Walleye anglers have bigger Johnsons than bass anglers. Unless they have backtroller outboards.
1549133,lcwhit,2013-03-09 15:25:00,104,same study results would apply if pike fishermen were substituted for bass fishermen.
1549600,drlee,2013-03-10 18:19:00,409,"Kind of reminds me of my old football coaching days...we told the team to hold a vote: Who is more important, the linemen or the backs? The linemen won the vote, 7-4."
1549916,Mike Kansas,2013-03-11 11:58:00,1463,Got to love this post. Former lineman here. Mike Kansas
