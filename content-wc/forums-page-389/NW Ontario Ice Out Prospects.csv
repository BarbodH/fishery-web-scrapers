1548314,bigdaddyguns,2013-03-07 21:34:00,608,"Given last year's early ice out, I am wondering how the winter has progressed this year and the likelihood of a typical early May ice out this spring."
1548368,bob888,2013-03-08 04:59:00,244,The data for this link is not yet shown (perhaps because no ice is out yet). It is what I use.http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ice_out/index.html
1548506,Fisherman Ted,2013-03-08 09:35:00,461,"We are estimating a regular ice out this spring in NW Ontario. While there have been frigid temperatures the heavy snow has insulated the lakes, keeping the ice to a manageable level. So mid April, perhaps a little later is what we are looking at. The snow however will pump up water levels which will really help us out as last year they were low. Fisherman Ted"
1548514,Lovetofish,2013-03-08 09:48:00,458,Fisherman Ted. Has all of NWO had heavy snow this winter? I fish close to Pickle Lake.
1548838,fishguide1800,2013-03-08 20:51:00,84,"We have been fishing a number of lakes just north of vermilion bay since first ice in dec,ice thickness has been steadily increasing,there is a foot and a half to two feet of snow on the on top of the ice depending on how the wind has blown,there 3 ft high drifts in some areas,ice is in and around 24"" to 30"" in some areas with frozen slush on the top layer.ice will leave when it wants to,all depends on weather,but i predict it will be gone on the walleye opener.conditions for fishing and sledding is just fantastic right now"
1548845,JayM5209,2013-03-08 21:05:00,1050,Getting any lakers through the ice on Cliff?
1548885,Gunner_Fletch,2013-03-09 04:29:00,74,"I live on LOTW.....all is correct on the amount of snow and ice thickness as previous posts have mentioned. That said, the ice will be out on LOTW by end Apr. Temperatures are doing nothing but climbing in the long range forecast. My guess....."
1548914,wallydave,2013-03-09 06:15:00,2151,The annual ice out contest!! Yes folks time to predict the ice out dates for your favorite walleye lake! For the NW section of Lac Seul my guestimate is April 14.
1548934,Outfitter17,2013-03-09 06:56:00,127,"Here is the 10 day forecast for Dryden:Mar 9 H 34 L 20 1-2"" snowMar 10 H 21 L 6Mar 11 H 25 L 14Mar 12 H 29 L 10 chance of snowMar 13 H 26 L 12Mar 14 H 29 L 11 change of snowMar 15 H 26 L 10Mar 16 H 28 L 10Mar 17 H 29 L 14Mar 18 H 35 L 20With this type of forecast moving through mid march and only 2 days above freezing (not much above) and most nights down into the low teens we will be looking at a normal to late ice out in my opinion. We have a ton of snow on the ground right now compared to the past 4-5 years and the temps aren't really moving up that fast.I will guess Lower Manitou Lake will be out between May 7-10, the way we are slowly moving towards fishing season this should be a safe bet."
1549126,fishguide1800,2013-03-09 15:14:00,84,"Fishing has been awesome,slowing a bit the last couple of days out,but still catching 15-20 aday from morning till noon,then it turns off,time for walleye"
