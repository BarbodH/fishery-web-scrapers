1535661,joeman79,2013-02-10 06:27:00,417,Going to LOTW first week in August. Houseboating out of Sioux Narrows. Anyone have any advice on areas to concentrate on for Walleye fishing? I imagine they will be on the deeper humps and drops. But having never been on that side of the lake I am clueless of where to start. Been looking at a map and the Yellow Girl Area looks interesting. Thanks for any tips or advice. Joe

From there, anywhere in the basin from Shore on the east, Robertson on the north, Crescent on the west, and Britannia on the south should give you more than enough to make yourself dizzy in deciding. Wanna narrow it down even further, border yourselves with Shore, Robertson, and Twin / Whiteout and go from there."
