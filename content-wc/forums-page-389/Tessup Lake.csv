We are considering Tessup Lake. Anyone have any recent experience there or at any of the other lakes serviced by NWO. Thanks in advance for any info. I did a search, but not alot of recent info available."

From my understanding, the fishing there is relatively easy with nice numbers with pretty good size to them. If it were me, I would start at the creek that leads to Peninsula Lake and fish both sides looking for water debths between 8' and 15'. Fish the eddy breaks, pitching jigs with twister tails or the like. I realize this isn't much, but hey, thats part of the fun going to a new lake. As far as the cabins go, NWO has high quality outpost camps with the finest pilots anywhere. The service is tremendous and Vic and his crew will do everything in their power to ensure you and have a successful trip."

Holly lake is also a good choice to take kids. our group has fished many of NWO lakes for 20 years and started bringing kids six years ago, our first kids trip was at Tessup and the last five trips at Holly. your crew wont be disappointed with NWO."
