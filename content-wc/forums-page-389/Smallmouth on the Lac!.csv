1552073,Mike Kansas,2013-03-14 07:15:00,1463,Best Smallmouth baits on Lac Seul 1) Spinnerbaits 2) Small Cranks 3) Flipping Plastic Worms 4) Dynamite
1553689,Limeyangler,2013-03-14 13:18:00,563,I say keep it simple as you can.Jig and minnows can be presented still or moving....casting is easy too....minnows unavailable use twisty tail grub. mepps spinners also deadly and dont forget topwater popper.Here's a video i did a couple years back just tossing around jigs with minnows up at Williams Bay (Middle section of lac Seul....near Silver water Wheel lodge.)They were everywhere from deep to shallow on a reef that comes up to 8' surrounded by 30' FOW.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uolJeeMDp3E
1556033,bob888,2013-03-15 05:47:00,244,"I'm an avid smallmouth fisherman on Lake of the woods. When fishing a soft plastic bait 4"" tubes are my favorite. My fishing is primarily in June so most of the SMB are shallow out to about a dozen feet of water. Fish tubes two primary ways. Most of the time it is with an open hook with a jig head inserted inside--see pic. I let tube drop or swim it with hesitations. Like the open hook as it provides a surer hook set. Also have a rod rigged with a weight inserted inside the tube and use a texposed extra wide gape hook so the hook point is not exposed. Primary use this when pitching the tube behind large boulders and pulling the tube over the bolder and letting it slide down the front side. Also useful when SMB are in a mix of reeds and boulders. The advantage of a 4"" tube is that the larger head size does not get hung up in rocks nearly as much compared to an outside sinker on a 5"" grub. Also have rods rigged with a crank bait that runs down to about two or three feet and two other rods with deeper running cranks or a trap bait. When the winds really get blowing spinner baits and crank baits are most effective. By the way for you walleye fisherman on windy days cranks and trap type baits (Strike King Red Eye Shad or a Rapala Rippin Shad) on a lift and fall is deadly. Those two trap type baits offer the advantage on the fall that they vibrate and the walleye typically take it on the drop"
1558185,tyson2925,2013-03-15 14:18:00,95,Never fished Lac Seul but I am guessing that the Smallmouth there will crush a topwater bait the same as they do on other canadian lakes.And it has to be the most fun way to catch them!Pop -RSpookBuzz bait
1550480,MOfish,2013-03-12 11:10:00,39,"I've been reading about smallmouth fishing on Lac Seul. There's alot of talk about using 'tubes'. Can anyone elaborate on the use of these? I'd like to know if this is similar to crappie fishing with a lead head jig and a rubber skirt? Any thoughts on what size, color, presentation, etc. would be appreciated. Thanks,"
1550511,Mike Kansas,2013-03-12 12:00:00,1463,"Have used 3"" tubes in earth tone colors like browns, black, green with good success. Flipping rock banks on a 1/4 oz jig with a 2/0 hook. This is early June on Lac Seul. Mike Kansas"
1550573,Mohleye,2013-03-12 13:27:00,368,"Yes, like the tube jigs you use for crappie, only bigger...."
1550641,orchard frank,2013-03-12 14:59:00,1900,"Spinnerbaits work great also, and will cover water quickly (maybe use a thin wire leader, the pike love them as well). Straight line spinners like Mepps will also put a lot of SM in the boat. The long 3-4"" (or even longer) tubes do work very good, and walleye will also eat them. For me, I think the tubes often out-performed the usual twister tails on walleye. Pumpkinseed was my personal favorite color. I liked to ""swim"" the tubes on the retrieve rather than jigging. Good Luck, it will all work."
1550705,Aaron-IN,2013-03-12 17:08:00,500,"Senkos are a must, rigged whacky style....a bit easier to fish than tubes and more productive. Just my opinion."
1550855,stillangling,2013-03-12 21:19:00,149,My suggestion would be to troll or cast cranks instead of mucking around with tubes. That way you will improve your chances of catching something worthwhile along with the bass.
1551044,MrSimon,2013-03-13 08:41:00,922,"This!! A thousand times, this!!! I only fish smallies two ways: 1. Casting or trolling cranks/spinners relatively high in the water column - works great when fish are actively feeding. 2. Slowing it way down with senkos around rocks and boulders. Works great when the bass aren't quite as active. You have to let the fish tell you which method they prefer at any given time. You can also hook a Senko texas style and use it as a glide/jerk bait, and then let it settle slowly .... DEADLY DEADLY method for smallies. Just don't set the hook until they turn or you'll pull it right out of their mouth."
1551046,MrSimon,2013-03-13 08:45:00,922,I like Senkos so much better than tubes that I though I'd post a few pics of smallies (and a LM and pike) taken on Senkos.
1551161,lassh,2013-03-13 11:20:00,553,But... don't wait too long or they will swallow the Senko.
1551175,MOfish,2013-03-13 11:37:00,39,Great Info. Thanks for the tips. I'll have to look up the Senko's. I've never heard of them before.
