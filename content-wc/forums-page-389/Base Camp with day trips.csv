My partner and I will be pulling a boat to Canada for the first time this year. This provides us with a unique opportunity. Thought I'd open up an idea for your advice and opinions. We are going to base north of Vermillion Bay. We will fish the lake we are staying at primarily. Pulling the boat gives us a chance to explore new water for the groups trips in the years to come. Would love to do a day on Lac Suel and a day on the West Arm of Eagle. We are primarily walleye guys, but some of the others like muti species. The question is do you think we would be intruding on the good graces of the camp owners to launch our boat even though we are not guests? Or, is it best to use a public dock? If we use a public dock we only get to evaluate the fishery (80% of how we reach a decision) and not the camp and staff. Then what about our hosts, will they feel cheated knowing we are scouting for other locations. If you have done this sort of trip before you input/experience would be greatly appreciated. If you're a camp owner/guide in the area I would love to know your thoughts as well."

There are tons of options and I'd be happy to recommend some. Been doing just what you're talking about for 34 years. . . and in that area."
1550117,Skywagon,2013-03-11 17:47:00,1106,"Most Camp owners will charge you to use their landing facility. Lac Seul has a few public landings, some have launching fees."
1550149,Rich B,2013-03-11 18:43:00,1081,"PackPro, I've done what you're thinking about, though not ""on the water"". Our family stayed at a small camp on the Trent Severn River way (Georgian Bay) years ago when our kids were young, and the fishing was just so-so with no walleyes in that particular water way (lot's of small pike, pan fish and bass). So, I took middle of the day ""road trips"" and drove my truck and visited other camps on Georgian Bay. Stopped and introduced myself to the camp owners, and asked for a brief tour if they had the time - some did and some said walk around and then ask any questions. I figured out I could find out if the fishing was any good by talking with guys in camp (it was the middle of the day in summer) and was able to check out the cabins/docks/rates/etc and see if it was a family type camp. Where I know stay is on the same chain of lakes I fished from another camp, though we checked out several camps when we were fishing the lakes and like the one we're at now a little better than the previous camp - and would probably be at the other camp if not for stopping and checking out the one we are now using. If you do decide to check out some other camps, I'd ask on Walleye Central or go on the net and have a few camps in mind that you want to visit (either by driving to them or boating to them) - there's nothing like putting your own eyes on the docks, cabins, grounds, etc and then talking with the owners, if you're thinking about staying at their camp - especially if you have just had a long drive up from the states. Should you pull your rig to another camp to launch, expect to pay a ""daily launch"" fee. That's a beautiful area of western Ontario (I fish the Perrault Falls area) and I have a 24 hour drive one way, so don't want any ""surprises"" when I arrive (hence, the above advice). Lastly, you say that you're 80% about the fishing....and so are your buddies....it's my opinion that it's hard to go wrong fishing any of those waters you mentioned. You questioned how your camp owners where you stay will feel if you are checking out other lakes in the area - I'm sure they have had folks from those lakes stopping by their camp over the years and asking questions about their camp. By looking at the other camps and lakes, you may decide to stay at the lake and camp you normally stay at.....and in future years take a day trip or two and trailer your rig down the road for a change of pace. If you don't check out these other lakes and camps, you'll never know if a change of camps is in your best interests. Safe travels north, Rich"
