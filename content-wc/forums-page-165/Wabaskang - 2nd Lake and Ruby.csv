Despite fishing this lake for several years, I could still use (and would appreciate) help with parts of the water. Rather than avoid the spots where we've had little luck, I thought I'd see if anybody here could help us succeed in new areas. How do folks fish 2nd Lake? We try jigging the points separating the coves on the east side; one has orange rocks and another is usually marked by floating jugs and both have decent dropoffs. But we usually have only mixed luck there (typically using 1/4 oz. jigs with minnows). We do have some luck at the mouth to the first narrows but that's often crowded and/or subject to lots of boat traffic. We sometimes pull spinners through the coves and find a few small ones. Any ideas for what we should try - especially as a good search technique - in 2nd Lake? Similarly, despite numerous reports of walleye and perch success in Ruby we've never done well there. We've anchored all the way in (including by the feeder creek entrances) and usually jig or slip bobber with 1/8 or even 1/16 jigs with a bit of worm (for perch) or minnows (for eyes). We've backed out of that very shallow lake and tried fishing a little deeper but still can't seem to do well there. By contrast, we have our best luck in Keynote and Mean Lakes and occasionally have luck in North Bay. Typically we pull spinners with minnows or use bottom bouncers with worms. I'd be happy to share more details if any would like. Thanks in advance. I mostly lurk here but enjoy the friendly, helpful online community!"

We fish out of Peffley's camp and fish Mean Lake, Gawley's Bay, around Doe Island south of the camp and what we call West Bay. We do make at least one portage to Wine and Beaver lakes every year. I will add that early June in years with a late spring we catch a lot of fish in Gawley's Bay. It is a shallow bay with a max. of 10 ft. of water. We fish the edges of the pencil reeds usually trying to set up a slow drift. I suspect other shallow water bays could be good with the same conditions. The bay west of Doe Island is usually good. It looks like 2018 may be a late spring with fish in shallower water. We will be there June 15th. Good fishing to you. Billy W"
6144233,KevinSB,2018-04-19 11:53:00,73,"Thanks, Billy! We've fished a little in Gawley's and I certainly know what you mean about the pencil reeds there! We've caught a few walleye similar to how you described (and even pulled a nice northern by casting at the mouth of the inlet stream on the north end). We probably don't fish Gawley's enough. We also fish Doe, mostly pulling spinners around the island, with intermittent luck. We always try it once or twice a trip and seem to have our best luck there very early morning. I've not fished what you call West Bay, although from a map I understand where you're referring to. May have to check that out. Most importantly, I understand catching fish is about patterns and not spots. I appreciate the suggestion to target Gawley's and other shallow bays in early June. Thanks again Billy, and best of luck to you! Kevin"
6144953,billy weaver,2018-04-19 19:12:00,470,"The water around Doe Island drops quickly into deep water so the only place we fish early is the south side and the point on the north-west corner. Gawley's Bay has a long point on the north side, we catch a lot of fish early in the year on the end of the point and the east side. Stay close to the reeds and in the reeds as much as possible. On the east side of the point there is a few places you can fish into the reeds as the bottom changes. You have to drift or slow troll with a short line to keep from hanging up in the reeds. When we get to camp the first day we all go Gawley's Bay and get a limit of 15-16"" fish for our first walleye meal. For bigger fish later in the week we fish West Bay or the west side of Mean Lake trolling the edge of the weeds close to deeper water. P.S. We catch some nice smallmouth in Gawley's Bay while fishing for Walleye."
