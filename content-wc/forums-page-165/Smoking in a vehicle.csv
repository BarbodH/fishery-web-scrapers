6116370,yoopertrout,2018-04-07 08:32:00,1172,A democratically made decision to protect infants from poisonous smoke isn't a tyranny.

6115594,Obabikon,2018-04-06 19:24:00,2370,If we're going down this road... I think it should be illegal for an expecting mother to drink or smoke during a pregnancy.

6114074,emma17,2018-04-06 08:38:00,436,"Hmmm. I don't think you have free healthcare. As the saying goes, the government gives nothing it doesn't first take. Unless of course your Canadian doctors and hospitals literally work for free. All this talk about protecting unborn babies- yet Canada allows the killing of those same unborn babies. Mercy."
6114194,Obabikon,2018-04-06 09:07:00,2370,"Well, we can probably say goodbye to this thread... First... it was a misread explanation of the law. But, it has gotten political. Sure fire death sentence."
6114626,yoopertrout,2018-04-06 11:21:00,1172,"So, you oppose infringing the freedom of people to give their kids life long diseases, huh. That's swell. Did you know that there is a paradise on earth just waiting for you, that is free from these sort of horrible government regulations - Somalia! It would be a dream come true for you. As far as smoking with 16 year olds in the car - you mis read. The law applies to children UNDER sixteen. Regarding your idea that if we can't stop people from smoking in their homes in front of children, they shouldn't be stopped from smoking in cars with children is nonsense for two reason: 1. Not being able to solve all problems is never a good excuse for not solving any problems. 2. Houses are bigger than cars. As far as me not knowing you - You've been pretty consistent on this site. Show a little decency and concern for others, and maybe I'll amend my view."
6114634,yoopertrout,2018-04-06 11:22:00,1172,"Yes, Canada takes the money from the health care consumers and gives it to the health care providers. We do the same thing. We just jack the cost by including a lot of highly paid middlemen (the insurance industry.)"
6114826,v-bay gord,2018-04-06 12:55:00,3168,"""Free"", as in you describe the use of your Interstate highway system as being ""free"". Both are examples of government providing a service to the taxpayer. Unborn babies? For this I will quote Aspencreek who said "" What I oppose is the enfringement on freedoms by people who wish to spread their idea of correctness on everyone else."" I suppose in Canada women have the freedom to have an abortion without religion imposing their idea of correctness. Death of a thread coming up......"
6114874,v-bay gord,2018-04-06 13:20:00,3168,For those I might have offended on my last post may I suggest ordering one of my exclusive WC t-shirts..........
6114898,Ricky Spanish,2018-04-06 13:28:00,1298,"Since you're not banned, that makes you only half right. To be fair, the old adage of ""it takes one to know one"" certainly applies to me, too."
6115002,pjshorthorn,2018-04-06 14:15:00,5654,"The rumor is that with every T-Shirt ordered, you get two rolls of Gord Poo Paper free. Apparently, autographs on each roll now have a nominal fee. PjShorthorn"

6112162,mjayn,2018-04-05 13:53:00,1188,It seemed to imply that it illegal to smoke in a vehicle with a person 16 years old or under in the car.
6112186,Bakefish,2018-04-05 14:09:00,1077,Gotcha. My reading comprehension is dropping as I get older.
6112394,BRP,2018-04-05 14:59:00,77,"Ironically, the 16 year old could smoke in that car if they wanted. Just not the adult when there are children present."
6112690,yoopertrout,2018-04-05 17:11:00,1172,I think the article implied that you can't smoke in a vehicle with persons under 16.
6112706,port1042,2018-04-05 17:32:00,509,"Smoking in a vehicle with children present: Seven other states have similar laws in the books, including Alabama, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Oregon, Vermont and Virginia."
6113122,Aspencreek,2018-04-05 19:34:00,2911,But it's OK to smoke em in front of anyone you want too when you get home. The nanny state at work!!!
6113194,yoopertrout,2018-04-05 20:09:00,1172,"Brilliant. ""The Nanny State."" Libertarian lingo for the kindergarten philosophy that libertarianism is.I spend a lot of time on my job in a courthouse. I see, and smell people coming to court carrying babies who reek of tobacco smoke. Yesterday I sat ten feet away from a family that smelled so bad, my eyes hurt. It's clear that these people smoke with all the windows up, and the baby in the car. We know that second hand smoke damages children. Do we really have to sacrifice the health of children so your pat, one size fits all philosophy of ""Gubmint is bad"" isn't offended? If we aren't going to protect the most defenseless among us from having life-long illnesses, what are we, as a society going to do? I know, I know, ""the market will take care of it, the government should only provide roads and armies.""What else do you oppose? Speed limits? No passing zones? Laws against beating and molesting children? Aspencreek, sometimes I don't think you have any empathy for your fellow humans."
6113306,Aspencreek,2018-04-05 21:06:00,2911,"What I oppose is the enfringement on freedoms by people who wish to spread their idea of correctness on everyone else. That is NOT, a one size fits all philosophy of government or anything else. And you don't know me at all, so I would appreciate it if you would try and hold off on the consistent character accusations until you do. And it's not just me you do it too. It is pretty obvious we do not see eye to eye on all matters political, but name calling and character bashing doesn't need to be involved at any time. We have had our differences on a few threads here, I believe in a persons right to choose, and I believe that each person has to live with the consequences of those actions. Do I think some of those choices are right, NO, but I defend their right to make them as they see fit, as long as they are within the law. In this case in Ontario (and appears to be in some states in the US too) this is the law, but why? Seems to me to be just some feel good legislation to another perceived problem, and like another poster pointed out, it's ok for the 16 yr old to smoke but not the adult in the car??? BTW, I don't smoke, and do I think the example you are providing is one in which some really poor choices are being made for the sake of those children involved, YES. But to pass a law in which you can't smoke in a car with a child under 16, but you can at home seems just a little foolish, just a little? If you want to protect the children from their parents smoking then we should ban the smoking everywhere, that would make more sense, pass that law."
6113538,Clairebear,2018-04-06 04:43:00,937,"In Ontario we have free health care. We also know that smoking is harmful long term as is second hand smoke for non smokers. We also know that smoking, nursing mothers have infants that are addicted to nicotine thru breast milk. That said, I believe our Gov't and law makers are being pro-active and looking long term into the effects of nicotine on health care. If there are fewer smokers today then there will likely be fewer cases of smoking related cancers, asythma, etc in the hospital beds 20, 40, and 60 years from now. So now our current Federal gov't passed legislation and is moving forward with the legalization and sale of marijuana in our liquor stores this summer. Go figure."
