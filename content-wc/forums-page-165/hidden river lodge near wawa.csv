Also there are 4-5 walleye sanctuary on this body of water we are looking at going the 7th of june and these area are closed till the 15th should this be a concern ?Thanks for any information Fish on"

It all depends on the Spring conditions also.If they have an early Spring the walleyes will spawn and get back out into the lakes.If its a late Spring they can still be up in them until later. Good Luck."

2376921,Wawajake,2014-01-23 10:29:00,413,"I used to have a cottage a mile up shore from Hidden River for nine years. I miss the fishing there badly on Whitefish. Yes there are sanctuaries , but lots of fish above and below those short stretches of sanctuary. Also tons of miles of shoreline to chose from. Water level is controlled by dam so some getting used to but I have had just as much luck with water low as I have high and early june it will be high. You basically have two river systems to chose from and wind and water temperature will let you decide which one (or your host will let you know) Biggest walleye was 27 inch , and biggest pike 42 inch. But tons of eaters at 16 inch . Jigging structure or bottom bouncing with wind drift. Waves and distance can be a challenge , I did it with a 14 ft Alum and 9 hp , but if you want to move around more you will want bigger boat and motor. Balck flies will be at peak , but when on the water no problems. If you want Lakers then you go up to Manitouk . Whitefish has Walleye , Pike, Smallmouth Bass, and ling. Some perch and mostly crayfish as feed. Worms work just as well as minnows."
