4207154,adempsey,2015-09-16 16:25:00,963,How was the trip?
4210562,123chadder,2015-09-18 07:33:00,429,here is a link to a vid on this outposthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyVQ1ry-3dE
4707322,123chadder,2016-04-05 13:01:00,429,i really wanna try this outpost
6131538,123chadder,2018-04-13 17:13:00,429,any new reports on this outpost?
6131554,Mike Borger,2018-04-13 17:32:00,1554,Here's a report from Trident Lake upstream from Esnagami's camp. Very much the same fishing.Pretty sure Eric Lund has now bought this camp as well.https://www.canadafishingguide.net/t...trout-bonanza/
6131602,Namegosikaa,2018-04-13 17:42:00,61,"I spoke with Colin from the New Fly Fisher earlier this year who informed me that he filmed a show at Trident last year, keep an eye out it should be airing soon."
3696162,kick n back,2015-03-26 18:27:00,3,"First I want to say hi to everybody, as this is my first post. I am looking for any info on Esnagami river outpost. We are booked for the week of may 23rd. I have never fished for brook trout, so looking for any info on good lures to use? Good walleye lures to use there? Anybody ever fish this outpost camp? Thanks"
3696266,Mike Borger,2015-03-26 18:50:00,1554,"This must be a new thing for Eric Lund, I had no clue he had a camp downriver. I can only assume he purchased the Trident Lake outpost from Northland Outfitters in Nakina, it's the only thing that makes sense. If anyone knows for sure I'd love to know what the scoop is. Trident is a widening of the Esnagami River downstream from the lake. I know the Northland camp was pretty lightly fished and quite run down. If my guess is correct hopefully the cabin has been refurbished.Light spinning tackle with 6lb test and a variety of spinners and spoons will catch plenty of fish. If you've never fly fished it would be a good time to learn. Make sure you have good breathable stockingfoot waders with studded wading boots otherwise you'll be slipping all over the place. No way no how will you be able to fish properly without getting out of the boat and into the river.For lures I'm partial to #2 EGB spoons, 1/4oz K/O Wobblers and 1/4oz Cleos. 00 Len Thompson five of diamond spoons are pretty lethal as well. #2 and #3 Mepps as well as #6 Panther Martins will catch lots of fish.For the love of God pinch down your barbs and handle the fish carefully! Brookies are really fragile."
3697354,adempsey,2015-03-26 23:22:00,963,"I think you're right. It's hard to tell from the photos though, but the original camp had a cookhouse and bunk house as well.http://binged.it/1HSM5Qg"
3699546,680 AMERICAN DREAM,2015-03-27 11:06:00,203,Not to hijack your post.... But is there a Camp 88 Lodge on this system? I remember my dad taking me up to the Esnagami and we'd take a train to a place where they would come and pick us up and take us to the lodge. I remember going up in late May and boy did we catch some really nice eye's and northerns as well. Beautiful place
3699850,adempsey,2015-03-27 12:29:00,963,"Nope, different lake. That would be North To Adventure (White River Air) Lodge 88 on Esnagi Lake about 165 miles NW of Esnagami Lake. Close though, I always mix up those names!!https://goo.gl/maps/PNK4f"
3700898,kick n back,2015-03-27 16:30:00,3,Thanks for info! Yes it owned by Eric. Started in 2011 from I see on net. Love the idea of having river to ourselves. I want to get out of boat as much as possible. Studded boots sounds like a great idea. I will pinch down barbs and wet hands before touching the fish. It is catch and release for me except one to eat. Thanks again!
3701106,chris.brock,2015-03-27 17:27:00,112,Post a report in a few months if you can. I would like to hear how it went and see some pictures. Sounds like a great adventure.
3707482,Gulper,2015-03-29 14:43:00,6,The Esnagami outpost that everyone is wondering about is on Merkley Lake which is downstream from Trident. Eric picked it up a few years back. It is a shallow lake but you should do well for walleyes and trout.
3707490,Mike Borger,2015-03-29 14:47:00,1554,"Interesting, thanks."
3707978,kick n back,2015-03-29 16:22:00,3,"I will post our results after the trip. Yes, It is on Merkley lake from the weak map I have."
