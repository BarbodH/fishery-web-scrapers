Have never river fished. Can you give me any suggestions for tackle for this area?Thank you for any help you can give.Wingmann

One of the first programs aired was an episode featuring Waterfalls Lodge.They (the Lindners) always identify what tactics they are using to catch fish, and what tackle works best. Keep in mind, though, that they have heavy sponsorship from Rapala, so I'm sure that using jigging raps is a staple of their tactics.I stumbled onto this program by accident, but I'm glad I did. Spent a lot of time this winter on their programming, due to the ice cold winter/spring of 2018. Programming is not exactly Mike Borger quality, but pretty darn good.Good luck!!"
