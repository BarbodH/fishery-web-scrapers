6123122,wmd,2018-04-10 10:45:00,388,"The thread on General Discussion forum about wave wackers got me thinking. Is there a manufacturer that makes a wave wacker or similar product that is easy on/off that could be used on camp boats? I go to 2 different camps and back troll a LOT and I do get wet, be nice if there was a product that is available so I don't have to wear a rain suit. I did look on the Wave walker website. Thanks wmd"
6123586,Pooch,2018-04-10 13:32:00,4618,"I made a set for my older Lund and everyone snickered, but they worked far better than one would have expected.I took a piece of 4"" PVC, split it into thirds lengthwise. Took C-clamps and welded a flat piece of metal onto them.Drilled holes in the flat metal to match holes in the PVC.The chicken scratched drawing below is pretty much self explanatory. I've used them for years back trolling with a 16 1/2' Lund Rebel and rarely ever had water come over them. The short radius of the PVC turns water very quick. There will be a gap on the bottom where water can come through, but it is of little bother. You could actually cut a piece of rubber (mud flap) in that area if you wanted to.If the water is too rough and comes over the home made wave whackers, you probably should be drift fishing anyway.Cheap and it worked for years.Someone can improve on it with little effort.Pooch"

6127242,Pooch,2018-04-12 02:12:00,4618,"Not great pictures, but will give you a poor visual of my hair brained idea. I just happened to notice that you could see the splash guards in the bottom of a couple pictures.Surprisingly they worked better than I ever expected. You're not going to back into big waves, but they do turn the water fairly well. Much better than nothing on a camp boat. Waves hit them and the short radius curls the water back and over itself. Waves comes over them? Time to drift.The four inch worked fairly good and traveled well. Six inch PVC would be better, but then again so would store bought tall ones.There is enough of a gap that transducer wires are safe. As long as you are careful. If I still had them I could get a better picture, but they are long gone. Traded boats last year and they went with boat somewhere in WI.Pooch"

6129082,Guest,2018-04-12 15:11:00,0,Bill- Make 2 sets for St Joe trip in June.
6129522,Pooch,2018-04-12 18:23:00,4618,"I just looked at the pictures I posted above and remembered that this photo is the second set I made and there are differences. The second set worked better and let less water slip under the PVC.I cut the ""C"" clamp and welded it to an angle iron. Then welded a tab that connects to the PVC. I should have realized that yesterday, but some days I'm just a little slow.Before you start cutting and welding take a 2x6 or similar and test fit before cutting your clamps and welding. Most camp boat transoms are just a little over two inches thick so factor that in as they are thicker than a ""2x6"". Probably closer tho three inches if they have a metal cap.Sorry for the late correction. Beers on me.Pooch"
6131706,andreindy,2018-04-13 19:49:00,308,"Pooch, thank you for your helpful and insightful posts like this. My group has quite a few novice fisherman. While some of us are leading the charge with intelligence gathering and supplies, others are looking for ways to contribute in ways that they can. Giving one of them a project like this isn't just an empty assignment...."
