6133970,ILScott,2018-04-15 05:54:00,139,"Looking for a creative way to store my fishing rods while in a camp boat. We always choose a side and put or poles along the edge. In the past they get tangled up, so last time I bought the rod socks and it work pretty good. Does anybody have any other suggestions? I was thinking about making something and keeping them vertical but they might be in the way this way. I'm taking my 12 year old son this year. Thanks for any replies and help. Scott"

I bring two c-clamps and clamp it to the side of the boat behind the driver. You can see it in the pic. When driving I fish out of the opposite side of the boat so it does not get in my way.https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/bass...ition-rod-rack
