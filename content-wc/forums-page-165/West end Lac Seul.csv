6142481,reup,2018-04-18 16:14:00,35,"I have been reading reports and opinions about Lac Seul, and keep seeing that the east end is the favored area in the summer. I have an RV and would like to use it, but do not see campgrounds anywhere near the east end. Is there really a significant difference between the two ends, or is just a matter of fishing activity being less on the east end. It seems Lac Seul is one of the most popular lakes on this forum, and there is a lot of information out there. Thanks for responses"
6142569,prov1800,2018-04-18 16:52:00,5010,In my book there is no difference.lac suel is not as easily accessible in the sioux lookout area.need to drive 10 mi north to the launch and there's nothing else there.could stay in sioux lookout there are campgrounds there. Can take a boat across pelican lake and go through the falls.but need to know how to do that.earfalld area would be much easier and thete are campgrounds at some camps along hwy#105.ive fished both areas and would say there close for both numbers but have found larger fish on west end.
6144473,rockape,2018-04-19 14:07:00,215,"I've heard there are no muskies on the west side of Lac Seul. I fish both muskies and walleyes, and have only fished the east side of Lac Seul. Keep that in mind if you fish for both."
6144657,prov1800,2018-04-19 15:37:00,5010,Your mostly right but I have caught muskie on the west end for years and lots of tigers.problem is most guys fish for walleyes were I do to but I cast for pike a lot and doing that I get muskie to.dont think it's worth your while to strictly fish muskie on the west end but they are there and large as are the pike we catch.i do my muskie fish on eagle lake and a couple of other lakes in my area.i have muskie fished the east end a few times.it is pretty good also.
6145305,Aspencreek,2018-04-19 21:33:00,2911,"I do not target Musky when fishing LS, but will throw for pike after supper. But the ""no musky on the west end"" is a myth. We had a VERY large one take 2 swipes at an evening walleye just outside Scout Bay a few years ago. And I also had a Very large one eat a hammer handle pike that we had just released after taking a jig, those slimey small northern who just lay there after releasing are just asking for it."
6145553,prov1800,2018-04-20 05:54:00,5010,"Thx for chiming in on that.like I said before I wouldn't spend a lot of time fishing for muskie on the west end.but defiantly exciting when you know the possibility of one showing up while pike fishing.to me it seems that were muskie occur occasionally they are of trophy proportions.wabaskang lake and clay lake are also not muskie lakes but both produce muskie in the 54"" range and every year a few are caught in each one of those lakes.you mentioned scout bay area for your sighting I to have seen and caught muskie just around the area where you enter bay of islands.iam a multi species fisherman and just enjoy fishing.we will all be on the water soon."
6145673,Aspencreek,2018-04-20 06:23:00,2911,"Yup, that was the spot. There we a couple other areas where we have had encounters, but can't confirm Musky or Northern."
6145825,Pooch,2018-04-20 07:07:00,4618,"Who's gonna be the first to post a photo of a west end Musky on this thread? I also don't see nearly as many SM on the west end as we do on the east end. Have caught a few SM there, but mostly small. Catch some nice 19 & 20"" on the east end every year fishing for walleye. Don't need to target them, they just ""appear"" several times daily.Pooch"
6146385,Carnhzkr,2018-04-20 09:53:00,964,"I have a good buddy that swears he's seen a couple huge muskies in that area, but couldn't get 'em to chase his bait. Claims he's seen them several times. I had always just rolled my eyes and told him I'd heard there weren't any muskies on that end of the lake. Maybe he was right.I thought I had caught a small muskie on the west end of LS one time and mentioned it on this site. Someone suggested it might have been a silver pike. I'd never heard of a silver pike so I googled it and the pic looked exactly like the one I had caught, so I still have Musky to check off my list of fish species I have caught."
6147505,prov1800,2018-04-20 17:30:00,5010,Could have been a silver pike but there are also clear muskie that are similar looking.both fish are pretty neat.
