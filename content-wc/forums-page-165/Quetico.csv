Check the link out below, it is the Navionics Web App. Totally free, no need to sign up or download anything. Search your area... If the lakes are mapped on there they will be on the US/Canada Chip or the Hotmaps Platinum Canada Chip. Its the same data that's on the current chips.Make sure you turn on SonarCharts Layer. In the bottom left you will see a blue Navionics icon. Click that and choose SonarChart. But either layer will give you what you're looking for. PM me with any questions you may have.link:https://webapp.navionics.com/#boating@5&key=qzwfHrrkhP"
