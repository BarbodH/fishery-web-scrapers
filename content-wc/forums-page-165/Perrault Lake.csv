There's always tomorrow!!!! Chuck"
5650217,team walleye,2017-07-06 18:28:00,336,That is a solid three weeks with little production for Walleye. I might be looking for a different lake doey next trip.
5668178,Rich B,2017-07-16 20:52:00,1081,"Just back from a week at Cedar, and the fishing was terrible for walleyes. I've been on Cedar at least 10 times (mainly the Opener, though twice in August), and this is the worst I have ever experienced. Talked with our camp owner late last week, and he told me other local area camp owners he talks with said the up/down temps this Spring and Summer have thrown off the fishing big time - said crappies haven't spawned yet as neither most of the SM Bass....said you might have a decent day or two of fishing, and another cold front crosses the area. Some Musky's in the high 40's were caught last week as well as a nice 43 1/2 pike (not by us), though very few walleyes. One of my friends and his wife (from southern Ohio) were in the narrows by the Burned Bridge, and they stopped to let a guide boat from a Perrault lake camp (with 2 follow boats) go by....the guide asked my friend how he was doing, and my friend said terrible....the guide said ""the same"" and took off....so I didn't feel too bad about our slow week.

If there was something wrong,...they wouldn't want anybody knowing,..otherwise it may turn people away from comin back. I remember one year at a bear huntin camp,...(way b4 all our technology of finding things out from the internet),....the fishermen in camp were havin NO luck with fish biting,...I jus happened to be in the office when the phone rang,..the owner picked it up,...I'm assuming it was clients that were coming and asking how the fishing was,...his reply was,..the fishing has been fantastic, lots of them being caught!!!! Now,...I don't condone lying,....but I'm sure the people comin sure don't need to hear horrible reports and it be on their minds that whole time! I'm only a 5 year Walleye fisherman,...but I've learned where to find them and I've caught 100's throughout the week that I come,....this year was the exception. I hope its jus the fact that I'm not the best fisherman,...hopefully the fishery is fine and its jus a little screwed up with the weather!!Chuck"
5668490,BornToFish,2017-07-17 06:36:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been watching this thread with concern for all the comments about poor quality walleye fishing on the Cedar Lake watershed (includes Perrault Lake). These comments remind me of fishing on Perrault Lake during 2003.I thought some of the poor walleye fishing that was reported might have been attributed to a big and prolonged hatch of mayflies or inconsistent trends in the weather. But, mayfly hatches and cold fronts don't last forever. Walleyes still eat on a regular basis regardless of the weather trends.I'm wondering if part of the explanation might lie with the forage base within the watershed. That is, the walleyes might be suspended in the main lake water basins chasing ciscoes (a.k.a. tullabees), rather than eating small minnows along shorelines or off-shore structure. I have believed for many years that a fair proportion of the walleyes in Perrault Lake spend much of the open water season in the abyss chasing ciscoes. It could be that this year the proportion of the walleye population in the abyss is unusually large.I primarily targeted walleyes on Perrault Lake during the summer and autumn by fishing rock humps and the like. I noticed during ""warm water"" summers, that I didn't catch many ""big"" walleyes on rock humps. I simply assumed the bigger walleyes were in the abyss chasing ciscoes. However, in ""cool water"" years, I would pop some dandy walleyes on rock humps from time to time. It seemed as though bigger walleyes would still be chasing ciscoes, but would visit the rock humps from time to time. We caught these bigger walleyes jigging and casting big profile lures for northern pike and muskies.If my theory is correct, that the walleyes are chasing ciscoes in the abyss, I encourage anglers to watch the surface of the lake on fairly calm nights, just before dark. You might see entire sections of the lake where ciscoes are jumping out of the water. If so, there is a reason for this. They are being chased by predators and trying to escape! I have witnessed this phenomenon many times on Perrault Lake.If you see the ciscoes jumping from the lake, note the area of the lake that this is happening in (see below). You can always try casting a minnow bait or small spoon (something silver that will run at 3-4 feet in the water column) when you see the ciscoes jumping. You might not catch many fish doing this, but there is a good chance that these walleyes will be the ones that you want to catch.Another avenue to target the walleyes in the abyss is to troll during the middle of the day. Thus, I suggested noting the area of the lake where ciscoes are jumping out of the water. By doing this, you will know where to troll. The area of the lake to target might very well coincide with the ""musky corridor"" due to current within the lake.Ciscoes are generally at their deepest point in the water column during the middle of the day. Thus, they are a somewhat stationary target, at least in terms of their depth in the water column. The ciscoes typically move upward in the water column during the late afternoon and evening when they feed, and thus become a moving target. Thus, you can always try trolling a deep diving crankbait (e.g. a Rapala TailDancer) during the middle of the day. Watch your electronics and see what depth the schools of ciscoes are inhabiting, so you know how much line to let out. I never thought of trolling to be a very profitable endeavor when on Perrault Lake, as you can only troll one line per person. But, it's a better proposition than throwing in the towel and giving up.I learned many years ago that there is almost always something biting when fishing on Perrault Lake. It might be that anglers will have to target what is biting and wait for the walleye bite to resume.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5668522,bearfvr13,2017-07-17 06:56:00,174,"Well said!!!! And now that you have said that,....my son and I did see this happening (fish jumping out of the water) I'm jus not seasoned enough to know this yet!! The Walleye that were bein caught were on humps that came up to 10-15 feet. Putting a slip bobber on and tossing it to the edge where it starts to drop off was how they were gettin them. I was mimicking everything they were doing,...but it jus didn't work for me!!! I also don't know much about reading my fish finder,...soooooo,...that's part of my problem too!! I thank you for your insight on Perrault lake,...I will tuck this away in the ole mellon for future trips!!Thanks ""Born to Fish!!""Chuck"

I'm looking forward to the trip. Also, I'll keep an eye on this thread to see if anyone has reports once the ice is finally out."
6139521,BornToFish,2018-04-17 12:47:00,1224,"Greetings,Fishing on Perrault Lake this season may be interesting, along with most lakes in Sunset Country. I say this in view of the possibly late ice-out this season and the potential for a cool spring (like that in 2017).Z28 mentioned that he will be fishing Perrault Lake in late June. I offer the following suggestions as starting points:Northern pike should be established on the off-shore rock humps. There will likely be some northern pike still relating to deep weed edges and the first break.The shoreline top-water bite for smallies should be hitting its stride by the end of June. This bite can be spectacular!Walleyes should be relating to points and the tops of off-shore rock humps. You might want to bias towards the rock humps near shore, as opposed to rock humps well away from shore. The walleyes will likely be around fifteen feet of water.The above points should be good starting points, but may need to be adjusted in view of how weather trends in May/June influence the seasonal progression for the fish.I hope that you and your brother and father have a great time this season on Perrault Lake. Good out and make some wonderful memories!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6139697,Black_Z28,2018-04-17 13:58:00,153,"I appreciate the advice. Your advice was kinda what I was planning on doing. Figured I'd bring a load of top water stick baits, jerk baits and maybe some streamers for a fly reel on bass. Then as many jigs as I can find to vertical jib walleyes on hard/soft bottom transitions. I figure I'll be using a lot of Side Imaging during the trip. I have a decent map of the lake, but I figure I'll use that just as a guide. Are there many water hazards to be aware of, or are they pretty well marked or obvious? Is it worth fishing the River that feeds Perrault in the Summer? I figure there has to be a few reisdent walleyes that stay in the narrows between Cedar Lake and Perrault as well."
6139897,BornToFish,2018-04-17 14:54:00,1224,"Greetings,I have about sixty weeks of fishing on Perrault Lake - lots of fabulous memories.I wouldn't encourage you to spend too much on artificial lures. I did this years ago and found that most go unused. You will do well to pick a handful of top-water lures for smallies. As far as northern pike, a few one ounce Daredevle spoons and some Mepps Musky Killers will do it for you.If I could only take two lures with me to fish for walleyes in Perrault Lake, they would both be 1/16 ounce jigs.There was only one thought in my mind when I fished for walleyes on Perrault Lake. That is: what depth of water do I believe the walleyes to be in. I would not encourage you to get pre-occupied with hard/soft bottom transitions. This might work for you, but may not work either. I suspect that the walleyes will be relating to rock humps by the end of June. I encourage you to primarily focus on the depth of water holding fish, with secondary consideration to hard/soft transitions and texture.There is a lot of structure in Perrault Lake that is not on maps. I encourage you to make friends at the dock to learn where these places are. Maybe the lodge owners can help you in this regards.Various points associated with Cedar River (the connector between Perrault and Cedar Lakes) hold walleyes throughout the season. However, I would still be fishing the points/rock humps in Perrault Lake.There are numerous navigational hazards in Perrault Lake. The good things is that they are in places that an experienced boater would expect them to be. I use to put out the hazard markers in spring and pick them up in autumn. I might have gps coordinates for these. Check with your lodge owners as I am not sure if the marker buoys are being put out any more - maybe some are and others aren't??? Several marker buoys were missing the last time that I was on the lake.You might want to investigate the shoreline between Jackfish Bay and Twin Islands for smallies. Also, check the shoreline near Jack's Bay, the Sister Islands, Camp Island and Second Bay for smallies. The inside turn south of Sucker Island can be outstanding as well.You might find that the biggest northern pike in Perrault Lake will be associated with rock humps by late June. If so, get upwind of the rock hump by 2-3 casts and cast any big profile lure that will get down about ten feet in the water column. Drift past the rock hump by two cast lengths. You might not catch anything on a drift. But, come back in two hours and you might catch six pike on the same drift.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6139969,wally28,2018-04-17 15:34:00,65,Thanks for all the info; I would think this data also applies to the lake across the road-Wabaskang. Thanks again.
6140137,BornToFish,2018-04-17 17:05:00,1224,"Greetings,Wally, you are most welcome. I'm confident that at least some of the information will translate from Perrault Lake to Wabaskang.I have considerable experience fishing on several lakes in NW Ontario. I learned that a clear understanding of the seasonal movements of each species is hugely important to my fishing success. This understanding is the framework that organizes everything that I think about and do while fishing, especially on lakes in the Canada Shield.I've learned over the years that the seasonal movements of each fish species remains remarkably constant. The thing that sometimes changes is how fast/slow each species of fish progresses through the seasonal movements. Some years, the fish species slowly moves along the progression of seasonal movements in response to cooler weather and water temperatures. Other years, the fish quickly move along the progression in response to warmer weather and water temperatures. Each species pretty much starts the season in the same place every year and finishes the season in the same place every year.One thing that has been intriguing to me is understanding how the seasonal movements of fish species can be unique to a particular lake. The overall progression of seasonal movements remains the same from lake to lake, but there can be subtle ""wrinkles"" that are unique to a particular lake.Over the course of many years, I have listened to some anglers complain at the dock about their lack of fishing success. The cause of their lack of fishing success often traces back to a lack of understanding of the seasonal movements of the fish they are targeting. For example, anglers often struggle fishing great patterns for June when they are fishing in August.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I've been looking into them and getting a little overwhelmed by so many choices..

6142489,BornToFish,2018-04-18 16:16:00,1224,"Greetings,Many sincere thanks to you Chuck for the kind words!Late August to mid-September has been my favorite time to fish on Perrault Lake. I know that finding one walleye is like magic, as I then know where they all are. The northern pike and muskies typically are on the hunt as water temperature is declining.You will find that water temperature is beginning to decline by later in August. Weed beds also are beginning to decline. You will need to adjust for this in your fishing locations and presentations.Fishing on Perrault Lake in June is great. Fishing on Perrault Lake in late August is also great. However, how you go about fishing in June is night and day different than fishing in late August.I hope that you and your son make some great memories together. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6140961,BornToFish,2018-04-18 07:05:00,1224,"Greetings,Sledman: I will offer some thoughts regarding selection of jig style.I make and paint my own jigs. At one time, I probably had twenty five different Do-It molds. Thus, I have had plenty of styles and sizes of jigs to experiment with. I came to conclude that a box with various styles and sizes of jigs is akin to a toolbox full of assorted tools. That is, each jig style has an intended purpose that it excels at, but can sort of do other things half-way well. In the same way, a mechanic can use a wrench to turn a bolt, but could also use that same wrench to hammer something or use a screw driver to pry something loose.For example, I've found stand-up jigs to work well when casting with minnows as bait over sand or loose gravel. The jig will cause a ""puff"" of dirt in the water, simulating a minnow that is foraging on the bottom of the lake. Ponyhead jigs (like a Road-Runner style) work well as a search bait when casting/retrieving, as the small blade adds some thump and flashes some light. Round Head jigs work well when using plastics or GULP type baits as there is plenty of shank and a barb to secure the plastic/GULP. Jigs with a ball collar work great when adding deer hair or flashabou. Tube style jigs work very well with rubber tubes for smallies.I've found that I tend to experiment more with jigs in the early part of the season, when the presentation tends to be more horizontal. The fish see it and have to react now, as it will be gone in a few seconds.As the season progresses, my presentation of choice becomes increasingly more vertical. The walleye has all the time in the world to study my offering, as it's not going anywhere. This is when I have to trick the walleye into biting, as it's no longer a reaction bite. I pretty much use only one style jig when vertical jigging, and that is a Live-Bait jig with a short shank hook. I want as little man-made material as possible for the walleye to think about when its studying my presentation. There is no collar on the jig. The shank of the hook is buried in the bait. The walleye only sees a small ball of lead and the bait.Experience has repeatedly taught me that weight of jig often trumps color of jig. I use the lightest jig that allows me to reliably feel the bottom of the lake and the bite of a reluctant walleye. For me, this is a 1/16 ounce jig. I might jump up to a 1/8 ounce jig if the water is deep (e.g. 25+fow) or big waves. I haven't used a 1/4 ounce or heavier jig in about fifteen years.I've caught walleyes in Perrault Lake on every color of jig on the color wheel. They all work. If pressed to pick a favorite color, I would nominate chartreuse glitter or gold glitter. I've taken incredible numbers of fish with these two colors.I have been making my walleye jigs for many years with ""oversize"" hooks. My jigs commonly feature size #1 or #1/0 hooks. I've been running some Gamakatsu 604BN hooks in size #2/0 and even #3/0 in my Live Bait jigs when using salted or frozen minnows as bait. These hooks work GREAT! I can thread the minnow onto the shank of the hook, such that the ball of lead looks like a pill sitting on the minnow's lips. There is plenty of hook point exposed to hook the walleye.I exclusively use six pound monofilament on my walleye reels. I tie a #10 SPRO swivel to the mainline and then add about 15-18 inches of six pound Vanish fluorocarbon as a dropper to my jig. I tie directly to the jig and NEVER use a snap swivel.I'm sure many guys will have a different view on the above information. I just reported what works very well for me.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I am still hoping for 4 of us from here to go but time to book a cabin is running short. I was planning on staying at rainbow point but we are not going with just 2 of us. If anyone is interested give me a shout. Thanks
6111850,BornToFish,2018-04-05 11:04:00,1224,"Greetings,Ketty..., I wish you the best of luck putting a trip together. I recognize that it can be difficult to get everyone going in the same direction - akin to herding cats.Many lodges have cabins of varying sizes - from two people cabins to quite large groups. It could be that RPL is holding out hoping that they can rent the cabin to a group of four, as this maximizes their occupancy rate and thus profit.It's getting towards the end of the selling season, as we are getting nearer to opening day. It might be that RPL will figure, before too long, that renting the cabin to two people is better than letting it sit empty for a week. Keep in touch with those folks as they might open up the cabin to you and your buddy, as there is always a chance that they won't book the cabin to a group of four people.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6048737,BornToFish,2018-03-08 13:20:00,1224,"Greetings,I have about sixty weeks of fishing on Perrault Lake. September has always been my favorite month of the year to fish on Perrault Lake. August is my second favorite month. Although I haven't fished Perrault Lake during July, it would be my third favorite month to fish there.The reason for my preference in months is that the walleyes in this lake congregate on rock humps and other structure as the season progresses towards autumn. I'm thinking ""game on"" when I pull up to a rock hump and catch one walleye, as I then know where they all are. This might be the foundation for ProV1800's comment.The walleyes start moving in earnest to these rock humps in middle of July. The walleyes are well-established by early August on these same rock humps. The walleyes in Perrault Lake are pretty much all on the rock humps and similar structure during September.The name of the walleye game in mid July through September is being able to locate rock humps and other such structure. Your lodge owner should be able to help you locate some of these rock humps. Friends that you make at the dock should also be able to help you. You may do well to hire a guide for your first trip to Perrault Lake.Finding a rock hump in Perrault Lake is no guarantee of catching walleyes. The single biggest factor in walleye fishing success during the summer and autumn is BOAT CONTROL.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

It's common for lodges to offer ""first guy is full price, second guy is half-price"" type deals during September. Lodge owners understand that families have children in school during September, so they are trying to lure guys to Canada in lieu of their autumn archery and early season waterfowl hunting in their home states. This type of program might be appealing to your guys sitting on the fence and can't make up their minds. The first and second weeks of September often fish like mid to late August. The third and fourth weeks of September can be interesting in terms of weather. The good things about September is that there are few boats on lakes and the bugs are gone.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5711442,Bill Krejca,2017-08-10 07:43:00,6107,"There are probably a number of reasons for changes in weed growth, which can be harmful, or beneficial to the fish population. I don't know the cause of the weed decline in question, but the introduction of the rusty crawfish, which eat weeds, has been determined to be the culprit in a number of lakes. Bill"
5711746,BornToFish,2017-08-10 09:37:00,1224,"Greetings,As I mentioned above, I will not be on Perrault Lake this season. However, I have fished the lake about sixty weeks over the last sixteen years. So I have a bit of experience on the lake.The clarity of the water hasn't changed much over the years that I have been on the lake. I put the clarity of the water, as measured with a Secchi disk, to be about ten to twelve feet of water.The weeds have not changed appreciably over the years that I have been on the lake. I believe there has been ""normal"" year-to-year variability in the weed growth, largely in response to water temperature and the water level in the lake. The cabbage weed beds exist, mostly in rings around the perimeter of various bays. There are many areas of ""sand grass"" that reside just outside of the cabbage weeds.I noted with curiosity the comment by KevinR that Grassy Bay was impassable to boat traffic in the early 1970s. Grassy Bay is easily navigable now, as the cabbage weed only grows in clumps around the perimeter of the bay.If Grassy Bay was like that in the 1970s, then the lake has definitely undergone significant changes since then, but not since 2001.I clearly understand and appreciate Bill K's comments about the effect of rusty crayfish on a lake's weeds. I live in NE Wisconsin. I have seen the weeds in many lakes be completely decimated in just a few short years.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5711794,billy weaver,2017-08-10 10:14:00,470,"We fished Wabaskang in middle June which attaches to Perrault. This was 30 years on this lake. The walleye fishing was down but not poor. While fishing the outside edge of a shallow bay we drifted into the bay, no vegetation 3 ft. of water and nothing but old decayed matter on the bottom. I was using a 1/8oz jig tipped with a piece of nightcrawler and caught a 13 inch worm free perch. Before we were done we caught over a hundred big boys (all worm free, which is unusual). When we cleaned them they were full of crayfish, which I suppose is why they were there. I wonder after reading a previous post if they were rusty crayfish because there was no vegetation to be seen. Is this a sign of things to come?"
5712106,prov1800,2017-08-10 12:32:00,5010,I know eagle lake is full of rusties and have seen their work in the northern part of eagle.they tend to only eat weeds that grow out of sand and leave the mud flats alone.i fish cedar a lot and have seen some weed bed areas disappear but have never caught a rusty in that lake.someonexwould have to put a trap in and find out for sure.one thing about rusties allthough there bad in our lakes they do taste good and are quite large compared natural grayfish.so start trapping them if they are there and enjoy some rusty boils.
5716114,Kevin R,2017-08-13 10:30:00,305,"Wabaskang connects to Keynote when entering Keynote from Wabaskang the weeds were so thick you would have to back the weeds off the motor 5-6 times just to get into the main part of the lake same thing in almost all the narrows throughout Waby, especially heading to the big lake narrows before they built the reservation. When it was rough on the big lake we would just look for a clearing anchor & catch walleye/Pike in the narrows. The big lake had all kinds of weed beds in 10-18 ft all of them held large amounts of fish today most of these humps have no weeds same with Perrault Lake. The clearest water in waby was in Aurbus Bay the Cabage grew about 20ft deep. Wine lake was very clear when we ventured into it back in the 1970's. Cliff lake had a spot named red rock a large reddish/ orange boulder that was in about 20ft that could be easily seen, last time I seen it was July 1977. I spent 4 weeks in August fishing almost everyday on these lakes 1970-1975 what a wonderful experience."
5743217,port1042,2017-08-29 05:40:00,509,"We're heading to Perrault Lake (Manotak) on Friday. Any updates, suggestions, or advice is appreciated. We'll drive up 71 rather than 502, but I hear 105 is a mess too. Hard to avoid 105 unless I give up the trip which is not going to happen!"
5743313,smyto,2017-08-29 06:58:00,3,"I was on Perrault 8/19-8/26. Fishing was pretty good. Didn't catch as many Pike as usual, but we found plenty of Walleyes, and even picked up a couple Muskies. I'll send a PM with further info. Also, 502 was in pretty good shape aside from a few flagger areas, but we didn't experience any major delays. 105 was about the same, there are a few areas of dirt/gravel where they are replacing the road. Be ready to wash your truck when you get home. Other than that, not a bad route."
5745009,Skyraptor,2017-08-29 18:29:00,291,"Been years since I was at Manotak. In fact, it was the only lodge on the lake then when King Johnson ran it. That moose head mount in the dining area is well over 40 years old. Remember it when I went as a kid. Plus bet the current owners never knew that one of their guides from years ago ended up shooting a bear in his bed after it broke into his cabin behind the main lodge. That guide, Herman ended drowning in the lake after he fell out. He was known to smuggle cans of beer in his boots. Caught lots of fish and great memories fishing with grandparents up there over the years."
5757233,port1042,2017-09-07 12:59:00,509,"It's Thursday early afternoon and we're taking a break. For the most part it's been a cold, wet and windy week. We've been fishing but it does tire you out. The basics: Water level is pretty close to normal, maybe a little low, but not causing any problems. Water temp is in the low 60's. This week has been a tough one for fishing with poor, but not horrible, weather. However, the fish are not real active. We've found nothing big enough to brag about and numbers have been low. I'm really not complaining because I've fished this lake a lot over the past 5 years and it's great. But this has been a tough trip. The wind has pretty much dictated where we could fish. We have only ventured once to east end of the lake and have found ourselves hiding behind islands and in small bays most of the time. One tip. My fishing partner has been throwing a silver and orange Mepps Agila (#3) and the northerns have been going nuts over it. I gave him that bait for his birthday a couple of weeks ago and got one for myself too. I lost mine on a snag after two casts. His has been hung up several times over the past week but it always comes home, usually attached to a fish. I'll be back at Perrault in the spring."
6008633,kettyspanky,2018-02-17 04:59:00,271,Anyone heading to Perrault in late July or early August? My partner and I are trying to pick a date to come up and try for perch and walleye. We are from Central Wis. And new to this lake. I've been reading the post's and taking it all in. Any friendly faces that are willing to give us a few pointers would be great if we struggle. We are looking forward to meeting new people too with the passion for great fishing. Let me know if anyone has a trip booked for the 2018 season and good luck to you all.
5674922,BornToFish,2017-07-20 04:55:00,1224,"Greetings,I would be looking for perch, at this time of the season, in weeds. Perch are nomads. They are here today and gone in two hours. Thus, anglers need to keep moving until they find them.If the water level is high enough, such that there is current flowing, and the water is cool enough, good places to look for perch might be Jackfish Bay and Rainy Lake. The perch often move out of these places if there is no current (especially Jackfish Bay) or the water becomes too warm.If so, they will move into weeds in the various bays. Places to look might include the following: Hopeless By, East Bay, College Bay, the cove where Sand Bar meets Hatfield Island, in front of the slot, in the bay in front of Jackfish Bay, and the saddle between Little Hatfield Island and Tween Island. Weeds can include tall cabbage-type weeds, or might be sand grass.Perch will bite if they are there. Thus, I would quietly move the boat into some weeds and anchor. I would give the spot about 15-20 minutes for things to quiet down. If nothing, it was time to move on to a new spot.I could never count on finding a good perch bite at any given moment. However, I was confident that I would eventually happen onto one if I kept trying spots.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5675410,danimalw,2017-07-20 09:02:00,2,Are the perch wormy in this lake when you catch them out of shallow water? I recall that being the case from other lakes in the area. Thanks.
5675506,BornToFish,2017-07-20 09:27:00,1224,"Greetings,The perch in Perrault Lake (including Church Lake and Rainy Lake) most definitely have worms when they are caught in shallow water weeds. Some perch were worse than others. These worms reside just under the skin on the fillet. We used to pop the worms out with the tip of the fillet knife. I understand that the worms fry up just like the fish, but we don't need to go there anymore. We pretty much stopped targeting perch quite some time ago. I used to fish Perrault Lake during mid to late September. Adult perch were commonly found on structure, along with walleyes, that was near where the weed beds were. These deep and cold water perch were often free of worms. These went in the live-well for a trip to the dock.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5675738,smyto,2017-07-20 11:03:00,3,"I was wondering if any of you who have had tough fishing (I am very sorry by the way - I wish your trip would have been much better) noticed a mayfly hatch going on at this time. I have read some of the other lakes in the area were delayed this year on the hatch, including Wabaskang. I will be on Perrault Late August and am trying to get my ducks in a row. Any lodge owners or other guest mention the hatch? Thanks in advance for your responses. I have been going to Perrault as long as I can remember (at least 15 years), and hate to hear reports like this, in my experience the fishing has always been pretty darn good, aside from a few slow days that are a given. Wishing you guys the best of luck on future trips."
5675898,walleyehunt13,2017-07-20 12:24:00,10,The hatch was happening on Cedar when I was there on June 24th to 30th.
5707746,Kevin R,2017-08-08 14:17:00,305,I heard last year when I arrived in camp walleye fishing was slow. I found them biting good when I fished them. Pike fish I thought was poor about the slowest ever. How are the Pike this season?
5707826,BornToFish,2017-08-08 15:52:00,1224,"Greetings,I won't be on Perrault Lake this season. Thus, I do not have any first-hand experience on the lake this season. However, I have fished this week on Perrault Lake for the last sixteen years. Thus, I have a bit of experience to offer.I would be targeting my pike on the rock humps throughout the lake. I am referring to the same rock humps that guys are targeting for walleyes and smallies. I typically found that the biggest pike in the system are most often found on the rock humps this time of the year. It seemed as though smaller pike knew better than to go out on the rock humps.I would sometimes find bigger pike (e.g. > 30 inches) in the weeds during August, but most often found hammer handles over weeds. The bigger pike and muskies typically moved back to the shallow, green weeds about 10-14 days before turnover.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5709522,smyto,2017-08-09 11:37:00,3,"I agree the bigger pike are not in the weeds during the later summer. BornTOFish nailed it on targeting rock piles and humps. Also, and I have no science to back this up, only past experience, but we have caught nice pike in Perrault near islands that have deep water nearby. For fast action on smaller pike in the bays and weeds, throw a Rat-L-Trap. I will be on Perrault in two weeks and it's all I can think about right now. I will provide a report when I return. In the meantime, has anybody been there recently who cares to share an updated report?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5709586,BornToFish,2017-08-09 11:59:00,1224,"Greetings,I concur with Smyto's observation that bigger pike are often found near deep water. My best pike and musky spots in Perrault Lake from early June to mid-September have quick access to deep water. I might catch them in 12 fow or less, but this water is within 1-2 casts of 30+ fow.I suspect the ""window"" is open if the predators are in the shallow water, for example in cabbage weed or are near the top of the rock hump. These fish will eat about anything. This is the time to take advantage of the conditions and put fish in the net. If the predators are not shallow, I suspect they are neutral to negative in their disposition. This is the time when I switch lures to something that will run deeper and just turn around to cast towards deeper water. It's helpful to have an idea as to the depth of the thermocline when selecting the lures in these situations, as resting pike will be found near the thermocline. I like to choose a lure with a big profile and will run at least halfway down to the thermocline. They often come up and crush the lure.A good way to decide the fish's disposition (positive vs. neutral vs. negative) is to assume they are neutral or negative. I put on a lure that will run fairly deep (ca. about 12 feet down in the water column) and start with the boat at least 2-3 casts upwind of the structure. I just drift across the structure while casting and go downwind of the structure about 2-3 casts. I pay attention to the depth of water that the fish strike from.Obviously, I need to adjust how deep I work the lure when going over the top of the structure so as to not hang up my lure. The pike's strike can be extremely subtle if they over take the lure from behind. The strike can be bone-jarring if they T-bone the lure. Either way, I set the hook very hard to make sure that I drive the hooks home!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5711266,Kevin R,2017-08-10 06:54:00,305,"How is visibility & weed growth this season ? Back in 1970,1971 & 1972 it was deep water weeds throughout the lake 20-30ft deep in many areas. Forget about going in grassy bay, was impossible to get a boat in from 20ft deep or so. Just nonstop Pike action casting the weed edges 30-36"" Pike were common few under 24"" over 40"" were rarely caught but most days you could average 10 fish per hour casting. Steel leaders 12"" were the norm & if a lure didn't catch a fish after 10 casts get rid of it. In those years Perrault had much better fishing than most lakes in the area for Pike 24-40"" it was 100 times better than Eagle lake & Cliff Lake had almost no weeds or Pike then. By 1976 things really changed still good fishing but the deep water weeds were no longer abundant, it was claimed the start of the cabins being built along the south shore was the reason water quality/visibility prevented deep water weed growth. 1979 or 1980 was about the first year I recall taking a boat inside grassy bay. The loss of weeds in any lake is huge less oxygen, less cover for bait fish back in 1970 the amount of minnows in the lake was incredible almost everywhere was bait balls."
5669090,BornToFish,2017-07-17 10:40:00,1224,"Greetings,I was thinking about the comments in the preceding post while I was outside making up some fishing jigs. I decided to make this reply.First, let me say that fishing slip bobbers on Lake Winnebago's (east central Wisconsin) west-side reefs is one of my favorite ways to fish for walleyes. It just doesn't get much better than putting out a spread of slip bobbers on a nice spring or early summer evening.However, I'm not sure that slip bobber's are an effective presentation on Perrault Lake during summer or autumn. They will catch fish, but I believe there are more effective presentations when fishing rock humps. Let me explain my reasoning.First, I will suggest that the strike zone for walleyes relating to structure is the bottom 6-10 inches of the water column. That is, they are most often tight to the bottom.The reefs that I fish in Lake Winnebago are relative large and flat. I can anchor my boat in six fow and adjust my slip bobbers to keep my bait about four to six inches off of bottom. I can cast them well away from the boat (say into seven fow) and still have the bait in the walleye's strike zone. Or, I can have them five feet from the boat, and still have my bait in the strike zone. My point is that my slip bobbers are always keeping the bait in the strike zone. The fishing can be frantic when a school of walleyes moves up onto the reef.I'm not sure that the above scenario is the situation on most reefs in Perrault Lake. Most of the rock humps or reefs (including Sand Bar) that I fish on Perrault Lake are steep-sided. I could go to many of such reefs and anchor my boat. I could then adjust my slip bobbers to have the bait in the strike zone at a particular distance from the boat. Therein lies the difficulty in my opinion.My bait could very well be laying on the bottom of the lake if I bring the slip bobber three feet closer to the boat. Or, my bait could very well be four feet off the bottom of the lake if I let out three more feet of line (i.e. further away from the boat). My point is that my bait could very well be outside of the walleye's strike zone a good part of the time that they are in the water.I'm confident that I could catch some walleyes on many reefs/humps in Perrault Lake using slip bobbers. I'm also confident that I would catch more walleyes while vertical jigging, simply because I will do a better job of keeping my bait in the walleye's strike zone! The challenge becomes one of boat control. Slip bobbers could be a great presentation on some rock humps in Perrault Lake if you find that the walleyes are on the flat tops of such rock humps. In this situation, it's like when I fish reefs in Lake Winnebago. The depth of water remains fairly constant over a wide range of distances from the boat. My bait is always in the walleye's strike zone.I hope the above opinions are helpful.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5669858,emma17,2017-07-17 16:31:00,436,"Chuck, I'm not a good enough Walleye fisherman to offer suggestions. I do want to tell you how impressed I am with your incredible good nature about such a slow fishing experience. No doubt you were both envisioning great success prior to your trip, and after two weeks of trying your best, I'd certainly cut you some slack if you had something negative to say. Yet, you haven't said a bad thing about the camp or the lake, only acknowledging your own relative inexperience. I'm sorry you didn't catch more fish, but I'm glad to have read your posts as it will help me to be a better man."
5671610,skindzier,2017-07-18 12:13:00,137,"I fished Lac Seul from 7/2 - 7/14 and had to adjust a bit. The fish weren't out on my favorite main basin locations yet, so we had to fish more in the bays & weed lines. Basically warmer water. I've never fished Perrault & don't know if that may be a similar issue, but you might try ducking more into bays & even fishing weed lines that look more like pike/musky water."
