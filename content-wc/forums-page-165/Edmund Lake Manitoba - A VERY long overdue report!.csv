6105170,Mike Borger,2018-04-02 12:55:00,1554,"Thanks, the support is appreciated!That wasn't a brick wall. It was hideously tacky brick patterned wall panels, straight from 1975. Was only missing the green shag carpeting LOL!That cabin was the former lodge owners residence, hence the odd decor. Don't get me wrong though, it was great. Very comfortable and lots of amenities."
6105906,yoopertrout,2018-04-02 16:39:00,1172,"That explains it. I grew up in the days of fake brick, cheap paneling and shag carpeting, and I don't miss them. I imagine remodeling that far into the wilderness is expensive, and when you're catching northerns that big, who cares what the walls look like!"
6106178,martinbns,2018-04-02 18:53:00,1520,"Another great story, love the one's with your boy. Hope your health and personal stuff improves."
6106218,Shortline,2018-04-02 19:03:00,234,"Great report, mike. You appear to be a good dad! Glad your rounding the bend and on track for a better 2018!"
6107458,vteye3,2018-04-03 13:19:00,496,"Great report Mike, nice to see Bren hammering away on the trophy fish."
6109282,Mike Borger,2018-04-04 09:01:00,1554,"Thanks. I love the trips with my son too. Quote: Originally Posted by ShortlineGreat report, mike. You appear to be a good dad!

6111882,spoonchucker,2018-04-05 11:14:00,82,"Sorry we filled the holding tank but we had ten guys- at least we did leave you a clean cabin. We found the fishing very similar to what you described, there were just so many pike but not the big ones. When we were there 4 years before most of the pike we caught were over 30 besides all the big ones. Not sure how the population changes like that. The old shore lunch island where you found refuge --we caught the biggest ones in the weeds about 200 yards east of that island and along the weed beds on the west side of that island."
6112226,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-05 14:25:00,8293,"Really fun watching your boy grow up right before our eyes. You have reason to be a proud papa, not many kids could do trips like those you do."
6113002,Mike Borger,2018-04-05 18:59:00,1554,"You guys suck!!But yes, the cabin was very clean. Quote: Originally Posted by That Minnesota guyReally fun watching your boy grow up right before our eyes. You have reason to be a proud papa, not many kids could do trips like those you do. Thank you sir, and yes I'm proud."
6113106,pjshorthorn,2018-04-05 19:32:00,5654,"After watching the cabin tour video within Mike's report, it all now makes sense on why there was a catastrophic toilet failure that still had to be repaired upon Mike's arrival. Looks like it blew a huge hole in the floor of the washroom. I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like that; and I've seen some some pretty epic toilet eruptions on Canadian fishing trips .

6102426,Mike Borger,2018-04-01 14:30:00,1554,"Some of you guys know what's been going on with me, others don't. Fact is since last September I've been dealing with some really serious health issues, and to make matters worse life altering personal issues. It's been tough double edged sword.That said, things are slowly getting better and I'm already looking forward to this years travel. Especially the trips I'm doing with my boy.Usually I churn out these stories within 2-3 weeks, but life has been getting in the way these last few months.In any case, I'm very happy to say the full story on my amazing trip to Edmund Lake in northern Manitoba last August is now done! Figuring out a lake the size of Edmund is a challenge, but my boy and I did pretty well. Along the way we battled some really nasty weather conditions and rough water, but boy did we catch some big pike! Walleyes as they usually are in the north were abundant and easy to catch.The facilities were extremely comfortable, far better than what you usually find in an outpost camp. So without further ado I present: Prospecting For Pike In Northern Manitoba - The Challenge Of Edmund Lakehttps://www.canadafishingguide.net/p...f-edmund-lake/Hope you enjoy,Cheers, Mike"
6102634,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-01 16:03:00,8293,Thanks for the report Mike and I hope you got life back on the rails! Always look forward to your reports as you stick some awesome Pike on every trip it seems.
6102650,kona77,2018-04-01 16:06:00,236,Mike- Thanks for another great report. Always appreciate the extra details you include on how you try to break down a new lake. Hope things are going better for you in 2018 and good luck on your trips this summer.
6103018,Mike Borger,2018-04-01 18:38:00,1554,"Thanks! Things are slowly getting back to normal. The kid and I are getting ready for another spring paddling trip in early May, nothing else really matters. Quote: Originally Posted by kona77Mike- Thanks for another great report.

6104322,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-04-02 09:09:00,240,"What a fantastic report--thanks for all the work over the years. I read and re-read these reports over the winter. Bucket list keeps expanding.I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. Have a great spring, and make sure you're evasive about the location of your spring paddling trip, assuming you're going after the big brookies again. Still amazed over the fiasco surrounding your brook trout trip last year. I don't think I recall how that all turned out. Have to go back and revisit that thread.Thanks again!"
6104610,BornToFish,2018-04-02 10:22:00,1224,"Greetings,Mike, you are a wonderful story teller. I very much enjoyed reading your trip report. Although, I was a bit surprised that it took so long into the story before you mentioned a Doctor Spoon. It sure appears that you and your son have a tremendous relationship. He appears to be on a great path in his young life.I wasn't aware that you were having health/personal issues. I sure hope that things work out for you. I missed your positive energy and uplifting comments while you were away.I hope that you have a fantastic come-back season!"
6104682,Kansas Bound,2018-04-02 10:32:00,152,Mike Another great trip report. I always enjoy reading them. Can you post your typical packing list for a fly-in trip like that? I always drive to my destination and am curious what I would have to leave behind. Also what kind of rod case is that?
6104746,Mike Borger,2018-04-02 11:01:00,1554,"Glad you liked! YES I plan on being extremely evasive this year LOL! I haven't said anything publicly about it, but believe it or not the situation with the person who filed a freedom of info claim to discover my spot is STILL going on! I think it's on its 3rd appeal now? The amount of manpower, time and expense our MNR has wasted on this fiasco is breathtakingly stupid.

Yes I know, being the shameless commercial shill that I am it's amazing I didn't mention Doctor spoons sooner LOL! Truthfully though, I use whatever works, I'm not married to anything.Thanks for the positive vibes, I need them.Quote: Originally Posted by Kansas BoundMikeAnother great trip report.

A detailed break down of how I pack for these trips including tackle is on the agenda. Will likely do an in depth video when I have time.Cheers"

6104850,yoopertrout,2018-04-02 11:39:00,1172,"Really a great report. I'm sorry to hear about the health and other issues. I hope they will be manageable, and gone soon. Hang in there! The photos were really great. I especially liked the one of the pelican. One of the things I found most interesting was the brick wall. I've never seen that in a remote camp before - probably because it's a heavy material to haul. I wonder if it went up on a winter ice road. I hope that you, and everyone on walleye central have a great 2018. It seems like 2017 was challenging for many friends and acquaintances. Hopefully 2018 will be easier."
