6118322,Huntindave,2018-04-08 09:16:00,2194,"So are you saying you have determined it was the truckers fault? What exactly happened? Please share with us your inside knowledge. Is this a four way stop? A two way stop? If so who had the stop sign? the bus driver or the trucker? Did the bus pull in front of the trucker? I have not heard any reports as to who is at fault here, I just know it is a sad tragedy."
6118410,Darrenf442,2018-04-08 09:47:00,1369,Its a 2 way stop with stop signs and a red flashing lights. The bus has the right away. 100% truckers fault. He has been taken into custody and awaiting a mental and psychiatric evaluation. Cell phone will be confiscated and went through as well. I hope it wasnt something as senseless as texting or facebook that caused that accident
6118522,Huntindave,2018-04-08 10:16:00,2194,"Thanks for the information. I hope the authorities can figure a way to reduce the chances of this happening again. Still a terrible tragedy, regardless.All I get when I clicked on the earlier link was this;We Are Sorry,This video is restricted from playing in your location"
6118546,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-08 10:21:00,8293,I saw a overhead view of the crash site on the news. I don't know who was at fault but there was cargo scattered from the truck everywhere. My first thought was the truck got t-boned on the trailer. Like I said I don't know who was at fault but it was a horrific crash. My prayers are for all those involved.

6116146,fishin10,2018-04-07 07:09:00,2315,I saw this on FOX News very sad.http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/04...-reported.html
6116226,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-07 07:24:00,8293,"Very sad. 1/2 the people lost their lives. Can't imagine being a parent waiting for that phone call letting you know if your child is alive. To be honest, with as many people as there are now it's a blessing there are so few of these accidents. Thoughts and prayers for all involved."
6116234,Yellow Fever,2018-04-07 07:24:00,1809,Terrible news....seems 14 dead and 14 injured. Unfortunately its not the first time and I honestly can't believe it doesn't happen more often with kids teams crossing the country on both side of the border. Not to pick on the truckers but a buddy of mine that rides the bus with his son for hockey says EVERY transport has a screen with a movie playing.
