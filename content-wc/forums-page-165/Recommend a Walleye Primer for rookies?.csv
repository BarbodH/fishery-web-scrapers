Basic concepts and understanding how light, temperature, wind, etc would/could influence your strategy and search. Most on this forum have earned their experience and have developed successful patterns. The folks in my Canada group this year have caught less than 25 walleyes their entire life. 2 of the 4 have never caught a single walleye. Exciting stuff."
6067249,andreindy,2018-03-17 09:27:00,308,"Anyone have suggestions on a primer or foundational introduction (book, video series) to walleye and walleye fishing that they particularly enjoyed or shared with their own kids? Nothing bests ""on the water"" training and I look forward to teaching my nephew in July on his first ever trip to Canada. I won't have the luxury of spending time with him prior to our trip. It is also our first time to this body of water. I want the boy's brain juices to start flowing and absorbing. I remember a few books on walleye basics being out there. Or is there a web series that has done the same well, in your opinion? I'm not trying to equip him (or confuse him) with advanced, pushing the boundaries of the sport kind of debate, but a ""Back to basics"" so he can be an active, informed and PROUD participant in our adventure to Abamasagi. Granted, he could just type ""walleye"" in Google. If I really wanted to warp his young mind, I could encourage him to search the word ""beer"" on the Walleye Central forum and see where that gets him."

6067665,Pooch,2018-03-17 15:02:00,4618,"When I first got hooked on Walleye fishing I read everything including the Walleye Wisdom book you have listed. Most of it made little sense until I had several years under my belt then re-read everything I own. Bought some tapes and hung in there.Occasionally Walleye still stump many of us, even after bunches of years. That's what makes them appealing to most of us.Like you said, time on the water and having tough days are the best teachers. Ya' just gotta think like a fish some days and never fish memories. Fish experience instead.Wisdom is perishable, pass it on while you can.Pooch"
6067705,adempsey2.0,2018-03-17 15:31:00,612,"I own the In-Fisherman Walleye Wisdom book you listed. It's a decent general book and I'd suggest going with that. The five volume set is good too, but I for your purpose completely unnecessary (unless you can get the set cheap) and the Wisdom book basically covers the same topics.If they are more interested in reading about stories or experiences, there are a few books written by guides that may be of more interest to them. Joe Fellegy wrote several and they are entertaining and educational. Although, he primarily focuses on Mille Lacs in MN. So, most of the lakes in Ontario will not really be similar in regards to fishing. I am sure there are many others.Or George Theriault's Book - Trespassing in God's Country.Alone against the North was also recommended.The Last GuideDefinitely a lot more out there if reading about canoeing or trapping in the Canadian wilderness is of interest."

6068753,andreindy,2018-03-18 12:12:00,308,"The book suggestions are appreciated. I added them to the Amazon wish list. That kind of reading (and mental adventuring), when I allow myself the time, hits the spot. Thank you again.

It covers the main variables nicely (with pictures) and how to make decisions based on those variables. Thank you! I will forward this to the boys. I am trying to lay the foundation for understanding walleye patterns....you walk out of the cabin and down to the dock. How do I make decisions about where and how to fish that particular day, or that particular hour. Thanks all."

Conversely, you can go to www.anglingedge.com and see each episode for free. Some of the best programming out there, and so much of what they do now focuses on Northwest Ontario.I have spent several enjoyable hours this winter watching their programming. Second to none, Mike Borger-programming not withstanding."
