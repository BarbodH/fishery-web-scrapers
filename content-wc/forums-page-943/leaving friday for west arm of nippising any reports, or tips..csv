521794,TangledAngler,2002-06-25 11:02:00,65,Was up there two weekends ago. Rained like crazy. Pike were biting on just about anything. Walleyes were sparse but I hear they've turned on. Check out the Ontariofishing.net message board and look for the Nipissing Report with Pictures. There's the proof.
