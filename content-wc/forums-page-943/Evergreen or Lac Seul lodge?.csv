Two of the workers hung out by our cabin most nights, & invited a few of us so inclined up to their trailer to watch the Stanley cup playoffs ( no tv in the cottages, But he had one on the trailer). Great boats as long as you opt for the 40 hp. 4 strokes on 18' Lunds. 3 spring mounted pedestle? seats, elect start, bilge pumps 7 bait wells. flat floors. fishin should be abt the same either place. We've been to LSL 2 years & planning next year already. Email me direct if you need more info"

They provide a very detailed map to all guests which is extremely helpful with a lake to this size and makeup. All cabins modern (most are new), clean and well maintained. Boats are new 16ft Alumacraft Navigators equipped with depth (fish) finders, 40HP 4 stroke mercury, and all the goodies necessary for a great week of fishing. It's located at the northern most part of the lake with easy access to both the big water and the sanctuary. Allows for good fishing regardless of weather. If you are bringing your own boat, the docks are good and in a cove for both ease and safety. Always, always good fishing, but that would be true at eather camp."

I have seen Pat wade out in waist deep water to help a guest trailer their personal boat. Gary has gone out of his way to help people with their personal boats when they have problems. They are always around camp working and helping out. There are lots of places with lots of fish close by no matter what time of year you choose. The cabins and boats are some of the best on the lake. I've never been to Lac Seul Lodge, but of the camps I have been to, Evergreen is my pick. We have reseverations to go back."
