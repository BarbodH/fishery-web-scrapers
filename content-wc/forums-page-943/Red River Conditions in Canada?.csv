Over $14,000 in prizes and daily big fish pot and total weight prizes, plus a drawing for a fish off for an additional cool prize. Not too shabby Eh? JULY 1st is the deadline for an additional 18 teams to meet the minimum requirement for this event, as it sits today, so get your entry in fast to insure this event will be held in 2002! See the link at the bottom for complete details or call the numbers listed below. Although we are seeing high water on the lower Red it will most certainly recede by the August 17-18th tournament dates. Besides higher water always means bigger fish up there really big fish! For the accomplished cat hunter to the novice this is an event where anyone could win big so consider it as a potential paid vacation. This is one fun event that I would not miss out on folks. Catching MONDO SUMO PIGGYS and maybe come home with some cool cash and hot prizes now that is what I call a vacation Eh! Remember the US/Canadian exchange rate is very favorable, which almost pays for the trip in itself! Cool Eh! ;) Dan Sernyk at 1-204-668-5831 Phone/FAX in Winnipeg Stu McKay at 1-204-757-9876 Phone/FAX in Lockport.

521767,fishcop,2002-06-28 06:47:00,11,"Red River is very high, as well as the Winnipeg-best top make sure you have a spare prop or two, lots of wood floating around(clipped a good one on the Winnipeg on the weekend, broke off a chunk of the stabalizer fin) If you are going, stay away from the locks, there will be enough current to hold cats other safer areas-good fishing!"
521755,Guest,2002-06-23 03:50:00,0,How are the conditions on the Red River of the North in the Canada stretch after all the heavy rain? Has it fallen any yet and is the fishing any good at Lockport for them big catfish?Planing a trip this week and wish first hand reports if possable.Thank you
521756,Guest,2002-06-23 13:38:00,0,"If you insist on fishing the Red in the near future, prearrange the following: Have an up to date will, and make sure your life insurance premiums are paid in full. It is at near record levels with extreme current and any attempt to boat on the Red is tempting fate. Is a catfish worth the risk? Dont want to 'rain' on your plans but those are the facts."
521757,Backwater Eddy,2002-06-23 19:36:00,3871,"Over 3/4 of the 550 milers of the US section of the Red River is below flood stage and very fishable at this time. From Drayton ND up to the Canadian end is very high and full of debris, dangerous at best. The floodway spillway area may be the best bet at Lockport if you head to the Canadian end, from shore only.Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
521758,chrism,2002-06-23 21:30:00,429,"Guys - I was at Lockport today and it is NOT boatable - the locks and floodway are roaring, and the current is ripping with all kinds of stuff in the water. The Red peaked early last week, but there is a forecast of a second peak this week with the water from the SE corner of the province coming this way.The news said that the Red is at or higher than the '97 flood in between the floodway entrance/exit.cm"
521759,Backwater Eddy,2002-06-24 06:02:00,3871,"Hay chrism Weird year huh? From Fargo South the river is no worry, but from about Grand Forks and up, look out.Last night we got hit HARD again on the same wet ground as before just to the North, lots of new water headed your way now, lots! That big ditch you folks built up there is paying for itself fast now I think eh? Remember all the bad press that prodject got at first? The big ditch was the best darn $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ they ever spent on flood prevention up there for sure!;)Be safe folks, live to fish another day!Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
521760,Guest,2002-06-24 09:02:00,0,"My buddy fished down river from the locks, near where the floodwaycomes into the red on SUNDAY. He called to tell me what a good day they had with the cats. He put in at Cats on the Red and while he said the current is VERY strong he didn't say much other than he used 6 ounce weights and that with a cat on and combined with current it was a tough battle. He's taking a group out this Thursday. He said there were 8 or 10 boats out Sunday.Now, I probably wouldn't go but my buddy is a cousin of Crocodile Hunter - I think the brave of heart only go in these conditions as I don't like to worry about being on the water when I'm on the water!Konw what I mean Vern!!!!"
521761,Guest,2002-06-24 11:24:00,0,MY BUDDY JUST GOT BACK FROM RED. HE SAID HE WAS FISHING WAY NORTH OF SELKIRK AND RIVER WAS HIGH BUT FISHABLE. HE ALSO SAID THERE WERE LOTS OF BOATS OUT AND FISHING WAS AVERAGE.THIS GUY WOULD FISH IN LIGHTING IF THE FISH WERE BITING.
521762,chrism,2002-06-24 17:08:00,429,"Hey Eddie!Yes, Mother Nature is having her time of the month up here....It was hot and wet again today, with BLACK clouds to the south and east! Just what we need - more rain!Funny thing is, a few hours drive north, it is bone dry! Just the odd sprinkle here and there! Fishing up there was way late, but things are now back on track...I start vacation in 4 days...can't wait! I've been plumpin' up my crawlers for the past month - hopefully the walleyes will chow down on them!Has your guiding been affected by the weather? I'm sure Stu McKay must be bummin' right now.Latercm"
521763,Backwater Eddy,2002-06-24 19:49:00,3871,"Good luck on feeding them chubby crawlers to all them piggy walleye up North. Hope your vacation is a dry and fun one.My guiding has been somewhat effected by the weather but not nearly as much as it could have been, so I can't complain. Overall conditions are good on my end of the Red and fishing looks very good in the days ahead. Sure hope things settle down soon up on your end for Stu and the crew. I may be wondering up that way soon myself? ;)Have a great vacation!EdBackwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
521764,Rick,2002-06-25 06:35:00,226,Type....Manitoba water level....into your search engine and get a update report....Water levels have dropped North of Selkirk and are predicted to drop more until an early July crest that is predicted to be lower than last weeks crest.....
