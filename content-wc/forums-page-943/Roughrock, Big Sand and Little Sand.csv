We have done pretty well fishing for northerns and smallmouth around the throat and myrtle areas but have not ventured up to Roughrock or Big or Little Sand. Any suggestions on fishing these areas would be greatly appreciated. We are mainly interested in northern,musky and smallmouth."

I'll give you a call when I get in Thursday.If you have anything to put in a cooler take it over to Dad's. I'm bringing the large cooler I bought for the fish from the Florida trip. It'll hold ice a ##### of a lot better than the one I was using.I emailed you a post from someone that just got back from Big North.Here's the link for anyone interested: http://www.ontariofishing.net/cgi/messageboard/view.plIt's labeled ""Fishing Report, Mitaki (He means Minaki) Ontario.See ya Thursday.IPS"

Good fishing in Big Sand for Musky, smallmouth and walley when everything falls into place. I had several big musky follows this past week while fishing for bass. Didn't find a lot of bass around the islands yet as I'm sure they are in transition from the spawning grounds to their summer haunts. Pike were everywhere, haven't had pike fishing that good in a long time. Caught some big walleye up on the Northeast shores of big sand as well. Bass fishing is usualy good on little sand as well and I didn't hit Roughrock but can tell you it holds a good number of big Musky and decent walleye. Be carefull of there as there is a lot of junk in the lakes. Good luck"
