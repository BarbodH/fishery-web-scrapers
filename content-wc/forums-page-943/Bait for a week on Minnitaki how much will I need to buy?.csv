521807,Guest,2002-06-25 09:57:00,0,"Thank you for the info! Yeah Rob has had the island for sale for awhile. He is still taking guests at this point. I have seen a lot on Pickerel Arm and have had their website saved. It sounds like we might do that camp in the future based on the sale of the island or how we do with the lack of amenities on the island. I do have one more question for you-- This is a big lake and not a whole lot of lodges on the system-- some various small outposts such as what I am staying at, Pickerel, Donnelley's, Anderson's, and a few other small lodges. Does this place get fished hard? Are we going to see a ton of boats all around, houses, cabins? I am just trying to get a feel for the setting. I kind of had the feeling boyz from your end of the lake would not make the run down to English and Rice as much being it has to be somewhat of a haul. Do you think the fishing is the fairly the same on both ends of the lake or do you like one over the other better. I will be sure to keep an eye for you and trade stories! We will be in a Bass Tracker from Iowa with a camp boat following us with the other two guys. Again thank you so much for all the help!Chad"
521808,Karl,2002-06-25 11:02:00,63,"The number of lodges, cabins, etc., is strictly regulated. No one can buy undeveloped land to build on. You'll see some rustic old cabins, but they've been there for at least 50 years, and 90% of them are not used. The only private houses are on Pickerel Arm off hwy 72 and they number about half a dozen. 99.9% of the land is undeveloped and natural. 99% of the boats go to English River or Redpine Bay, which comprise about 1% of the lake. Those two spots get fished hard. And an hour run to a prime fishing spot is considered normal. It can be a longer and rough ride though, so most don't make the run more than once, especially if the wind was blowing up. I always figured that fishing shouldn't be painful :).If you want privacy or solitude, there is still the other 99% of the lake that no one fishes. Not because there aren't any fish there, but because a lot of anglers want a ""100 fish"" day. That's why I mentioned the Minnikau Creek area.I've caught over 70 good sized walleye in two hours in english river when there were about 25 other boats there (it was opening day). The rest of that week I fished alone in secluded bays and didn't see or hear another boat.Your choice: tons of fish with 5 to 15 other boats or dozens of fish with no other boats. Disclaimer: I've also had times in Redpine when no one was catching anything but sunburn."
521811,Guest,2002-06-28 11:04:00,0,"We just got back from Abrams/Minnitaki, on Sunday the 23rd. We bought 2 dz minnows the first day there, still had most of them left when we left on Friday. We limited out everyday, had 4 rolls of film developed for catch and release. Had a great time. Believe it or not most of the eyes we caught were just off weedbeds in 7 to 12 ft of water, caught em on light stuff, beetle spins and road runners mostly. Chartreuse!!!! Water was high enough folks were going all over the ""chute"" be sure to stay on the proper side going thru there! Smallmouth were hitting great too, didn't find but a couple under 13"". Found a great sunscreen that works! Neutrogena SPF 45, we are both fair skinned, no sign of a burn on either of us."
521799,Guest,2002-06-24 12:46:00,0,"We have 4 guys and will be boating into a island on Lake Minnitaki-- We have a nice aerator system to keep the minnies alive but I am not sure how much to buy in terms of minnows, leeches, and worms???? Can anyone let me know what they typically use in a week? Obvioulsy, we want to over buy so that we do not run out but I need a ball park figure. Thank you PS- do they sell leeches by the pound???"
521800,eye_snatcher,2002-06-24 13:41:00,0,"We usually figure about two dozen per person per day. However, if you are also taking worms and leeches, you may want to cut that down to maybe one and a half. Minnows seem to be the bait of choice for anytime of the year, but if you are going in late July, Aug, etc., leeches are great and can be bought by the pound. I have always had good luck with Rainey Lake Sports on Hwy 11 after you cross the border. Stay on hwy 11 until you come to the lake, turn left and it will be up abit on your left. If you're going through Ignace, there is a bait shop that carries jumbo leeches by the pound.Hope this helps...eyesnatcher"
521801,Guest,2002-06-24 15:23:00,0,"We will be there this Saturday. We will take a flat of crawlersand will buy a pound of leeches. Although minnows will work, at this time of year you can do as well or better on the other live baits. Jig with half crawler/leech and spinner rigs will get you alot of walleye."
521802,Guest,2002-06-24 18:24:00,0,Thank you guys for the help and Jerry I will be up there also on Sat so best of luck!
521803,Karl,2002-06-24 22:09:00,63,"This is my tenth year and 20th trip to Minnitaki (leave this Sunday!). I prefer minnows, and usually (well always) ran out when figuring two dozen per day. I'd sooner have left over minnows than none at all, so last couple years have splurged and gone with four dozen per day. But don't forget to take along some white Berkely Power Grubs though. Found they will work just as well as minnows and I can usually catch four walleyes before having to put on a new one. The white color catches their attention and they don't see them as often as live bait.Are you staying on Neepawa Island?"
521804,Karl,2002-06-24 22:13:00,63,"They sell leeches by the pound, but also sell minnows by the pound. Most every camp has outposts, and they sell bulk minnows in a huge plastic bag (they add oxygen to the bag so they all survive the plane ride, or in your case, the boat ride."
521809,Guest,2002-06-25 04:02:00,0,"Hey Karl, Pam and I will be arriving on July 5th. I assume you'll still be there. Are you in cabin #3? See ya next week."
521805,Chad,2002-06-25 07:11:00,3523,"Karl-- We are stayting on some little two acre island that has only two cabins-- Rob owns and operates Northern Comfort Wilderness Adventures. We will be directly east of you. Based on the map and the late spring what areas do you like? Will the Rice River and English river channels still have walleyes in them? Any pointers you can give out? We were planning to use jigs (bright colors) tipped with minnows, worms, and leeches-- a feast and see which one is working. Which outfit do you stay with and I assume you like what they have to offer? Is there a website? Lastly, do you ever go after smallies and what do you use on them? Any info is welcome and I will be glad to share my story when I get back. Best of luck!chad"
521810,Karl,2002-06-25 09:00:00,63,"I'll be staying with Paul in #8 week one, and have #3 all to myself week two. Looking forward seeing you there."
521806,Karl,2002-06-25 09:35:00,63,"I stay at Pickerel Arm Camps. http://www.pickerelarm.com/ Best run outfit in NW Ontario.I thought the place you will be staying at was still for sale and not operating. Wish I had $225,000 (it's been for sale for over a year, so i'd start my offer at $200,000 :)http://www.privateislandsonline.com/minnitaki.htmI know Sioux Retreat Services has a cabin on Neepawa Island though, that's why I figured you would be staying there.Walleye spawn is 4 to 6 weeks late this year. Ice didn't leave Minnitaki until May 17th. They will be stacked thick in the usual places, English River, Rice River and especially Redpine Bay. Water level is high and it's been raining almost every day. People I've been communicating with say fishing is excellent to outstanding last couple weeks. The bay and islands near Minnikau Creek are excellent yet and not many tourists go there. English River and Redpine will be parking lots.I'll be the only Lund Stalker in Redpine with one occupant and I always wear a white Shimano cap.Ask Rob about directions to Bass Island for smallies, your cabin is fairly close to it. It's sometimes overfished, but it's still early in the season and is consistently the best spot for them. I only use Pop-R's, which work best early and late in the day, but not that well mid-day. Otherwise a #4 hook with a splitshot about a foot up, and a real (or plastic) leech work too.Once you've seen Bass Island, you'll know exactly what type of structure you'll find them in elsewhere in the lake."
