521843,Dave S,2002-06-24 20:24:00,314,Going to Canada from the US in several weeks and curious if any knows whether the typical boat policy covers use of ones boat when outside of the United States. Have State Farm insurance and afraid if I call my agent and ask this question he might have a heart attact when hearing I am thinking of taking my boat to Canada. Can you get a special rider? Curious if anyone else has explored their coverage when pulling their boat into Canada. Does anyone know if the typical policy provides coverage?
521844,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-06-24 21:04:00,618,"Call your agent and find out exactly what your insurance will cover in Canada. He is the only one that can give you the right answer. many of us here can tell you how our insurance works because we asked our agents. If you find you are not covered, get a rider or check into another policy or insurance company. And by all means get him to put your coverage in writing. Rich"
521845,Rick,2002-06-25 08:34:00,226,Do call your Agent....1st answer is on the money.
521846,Guest,2002-06-26 04:16:00,0,"I have State Farm Ins. Every year before I go I tell my agent and he sends me a out-of-country Insurance card. Your car/truck insurance covers liability on your boat as long as it is hooked to the tow vehicle. Once you put it in the water, your boat insurance covers it. I hope this helps. By the way, your health insurance isn't worth didley-squat in Canada but, they do accept cash. Three or four years ago I got a large treble hook in two fingers. $200.00 later I was fishing again. They would'nt accept Blue Cross Blue Shield. Just a warning."

521848,Guest,2002-06-26 22:04:00,0,Thanks for the comments on insurance. I was worried about my boat and never gave a thought about my pull vehicle. Good point about getting a special card for the vehicle.Never gave it a thought about the Medical Insurance either. Hope everyone stays healthy as sounds like my Blue Cross Coverage isn't worth squat in Canada.
521849,Guest,2002-06-27 20:44:00,0,If you are going to travel outside of U.S.A you need to have health travel insurance. If as Canadians go south of the border same applies.
521850,Dave S,2002-06-27 21:48:00,314,"Boat Insurance - My State Farm Insurance Agent is sending me a special insurance card showing that I have libility and collision coverage on my boat and dates I will be in Canada. Agent said sometimes Canadian Customs requires proof that you have insurance on your boat.Regarding Health Insurance, Called Blue Cross and they said if we had an emergeny type of health care incident we would have to pay the local hospital / doctor the full amount but could fill a claim when back in the US and get reimbursed for coverage similar to what one would have had if they medical emergeny in the US.Waiting to talk to auto insurance agent. Guessing same as boat, that you must have proof of insurance, libility on the vehicle you are driving into Canada."
521851,eek,2002-06-29 17:02:00,72,"I have a Boat US policy on my Lund, and I had the policy written to include U.S. and Canadian Coastal and Inland waters. I just hit a rock in Canada, tore up my stern drive good, and they paid the $4,200 bill with no problem. My home and auto policy does cover use of my truck in Canada, but you have to ask the agent for a Canadian proof of insurance card, no extra charge. Bottom line is we all hate to pay for insurance, but when we do need it, it is priceless.eek"
