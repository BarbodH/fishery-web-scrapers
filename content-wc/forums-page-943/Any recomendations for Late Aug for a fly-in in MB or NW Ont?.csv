521905,Guest,2002-06-26 14:19:00,0,A friend and myself are wanting to go on a 3-4 day walleye fly-in trip with an outfitter. Any recomendations that I should check out that you have had a very good or better experience with? Thanks :)
521906,Guest,2002-06-26 14:43:00,0,I am going to an outfitter called canada outfitters in 1 1/2 weeks. They are based out of Kenora. I would be glad to let you know how it is when we return. You will find that it is hard to find a good fly in for just two people. They have a good website if you want to check them out. I have heard alot of good things about them and have done alot of research on places in NW Ontario. The website is www.canadaoutfitters.com. Also try loonhaunt. www.loonhaunt.com I think the have one outpost for just two people (lake Poirer) and have heard good things about them. Looks like a cool place to me. I almost wish I was going there instead to be honest. They fly out of Red lake Wilson

We were there the last week of August and had a great time and caught Northern & Walleyes till our arms ached. Check their website at www.northernlightslodge.com Great people to work with. John"

The walleye fishing is awesome for numbers and size and the trophy pike fishing is world class. They will take 2 people as they a have small main lodge on south trout lake. There are five lakes to fish from the main camp reachable by portage. They have houskeeping and american plan packages. What I love most about the place is due to it's location (about 70 miles from manitoba border) the fishing is as good if not better than most lodges in manitoba at half the cost. The four day trip is around $825 US. plus optional meals for $120.00. I have reccoemended this place to a few guys on this board and they have all gone back two and three years in a row. Check out west coast hoosiers post on this board to get a fishing report. Good luck and e-mail me if you want more info. If you find the right place you will have the time of your life. The web site is www.waynorthlodge.caDuffy"

I have used Slate Falls Outfitters from Sioux Lookout a couple of times and gone to a small lake that he uses for small parties. Good fishing and decent cabin, good boats and new motors."
