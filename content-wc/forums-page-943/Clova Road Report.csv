521748,Guest,2002-06-28 06:18:00,0,"Thunderstick, boy can I relate to that very descriptive post. That's me to a T. Have a great trip and give us a report when you get back! As Dorothy would say, there's no place like O'sullivan....Wish I was going up. I only have some 49 weeks weeks to wait........"
521736,Guest,2002-06-22 13:13:00,0,"I am a week away from departure and I'm packed and ready to go. We'll br heading up the Clova Road to O'Sullivan Lake on Saturday, June 29. Has anyone been that way? How's the road? More importantly, how's the fishing? (How are the bugs?) It's gonna be a tough week at work. They ain't getting crap out of me this week. ""In my mind, I'm already gone!"""
521737,Guest,2002-06-23 05:52:00,0,"We were up the Clova to O'sully 6 - 15 June. Going in the first ten miles were a little rough and we thought we were in for a long one, but after the first bridge the road improved greatly. On the way out it was good all the way. We were told they are grading continually this year and we did pass the man smoothing the road on the way out. Also, we tow a boat in and it still was just a little over 2 hrs. to the lodge. Fishing was spotty early in our trip since the season is almost a month behind from their cold spring. Water temp was 50 degrees when we arrived, almost 15 degrees cooler then we normally see it the 2nd week of June. Although tough early, we still had walleye nightly for dinner/shore lunch. By the end of the week, things were picking up considerably, in fact our last night everyone was lifting eyes at a good pace. All in all, the week was tremendous as usual. Note: The water was so cold people were picking up lakers in the shallows while trolling stickbaits for eyes! Good luck! Tell Russell I said hello"
521738,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-06-23 22:00:00,618,"Thunderstick, I just got back. First thanks for the info on getting through ottawa, it was a breeze. The grader was sitting at the turn to osullivan when we came out and you will find that the road will get better the deeper into the bush you go. Watch at the bridgeson the clova road, there are some serious washouts starting. There is a sink hole at the first stream crossing on ossulivan's road too. I'd like to say I made it out in 2 hours like bruce did, but broke a spring on my trailer and lost a brake line with 55 miles of dirt to go. Thank god for duct tape, lol.The fishing....The weather really warmed up last week. The water was at 52.4 when I launched and hit 68 by Friday. The weeds were just starting to grow at the end of the week. Pike were holding tight to timber near deeper water. I caught my first lakers last week (11LB 10 oz &15lb 4 oz) both in 10 to 15 foot of water. As far as Eyes, we took your advise on trolling stick baits to find active fish and jigging. It was the ticket so thanks again. Most eyes were caught in 8 foot of water or less. We did best on the north end of the lake. At the river, the sand flat just south of the shore lunch spot, the shore line of the big island left of the big rock and the points to the right of the big rock and the humps on the south side of smith bay were kind to us. We hit a bunch of 2-2.5 lb eyes. Most of the others in camp fished the black hole which produced lots of fish but no size. Good luck, Rich"
521739,Guest,2002-06-24 03:20:00,0,Wow! Thanks for the information. Sounds like we might hit a pretty good stretch although the long range forecast calls for some rain early in our week. Hope you guys had as much fun as I'm planning on having. By the way...where'd you cross into Canada? The TI Bridge or Ogdensburg? Thanks again and I'll file a report upon my return.
521740,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-06-24 21:10:00,618,"Crossed at TI bridge. Went quick and no hassels. Good luck, Rich"
521741,Guest,2002-06-26 05:16:00,0,"Thunderstick, we cross at Ogedensburg, NY. It's a little shorter than TI. Good Luck at O'Sully! Your not to excited now are you??Leave us a report when you get home!!"
521742,Guest,2002-06-27 07:06:00,0,"Hey Thunderstick, Bruce PA and CR8WTHunter......could you guys provide any info on the camp where you're staying.....website or whatever? Sounds like the kind of place I'd like to try out with my buddies. By the way, Thunderstick, I call that week of anticipation before the trip as having ""one foot in the boat"".....I've gotta wait till next summer to make our trip North....sigh..."
521743,Guest,2002-06-27 09:10:00,0,"Baxter, I'll get back to you on this when i get a moment."
521744,Guest,2002-06-27 15:12:00,0,"Try this:www.osullivanlake.caI've literally been packed and ready to roll since last Saturday. My mind keeps dreaming up things I should bring, in the event that the unhappenable happens. I'll return home with hundreds of dollars worth of untouched new lures (ones I simply COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT), I'll have black fly knobs on my ankles and neck, my liver will be looking for a new home, the infections on my hands from cleaning walleye will take a week to clear up and I'll be faced with the reality of waiting another 51, or so, weeks until the next trip. But it will be worth it."
521745,Guest,2002-06-28 05:01:00,0,"Thanks Thunderstick for the link! This place looks like just exactly what my gang is looking for.....we've been going to Quebec every other year now -w- the same 8 guys, and we're trying to hit a new outfitter each trip. Does your group go for the remote camp? That's what we would be interested in. Any info on the remote camp, especially how many people it can accomodate would be appreciated. Hope you guys have a blast up there, let the rest of us know how you made out when you return. God, I love this site....it keeps me sane when I've gotta be chained to the desk at work, hearing about trips like yours. Good luck, may the Dore' Gods smile upon you!"
