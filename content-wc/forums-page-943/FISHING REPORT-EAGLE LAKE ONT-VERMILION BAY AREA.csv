SOON TO COME WITH THE WATER TEMPS IN THE 60'S IS THE MAYFLY HATCH,SEEN A FEW STRAGGLERS START TO SHOW UP YESTERDAY.HOW SEVERE IT WILL BE REMAINS TO BE SEEN.I'VE SEEN HIGH WATER CONDITIONS SUCH AS THESE SOME WHAT REDUCE THE LEVEL AND DURATION OF THE HATCHES BEFORE.NO MATTER HOW SEVERE DO NOT GASP,CLUTCH YOUR THROAT,OR THINK ALL IS LOST IF YOUR TRIP IS COMING UP IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE OF IT.IN THE FOLLOWING REPORTS I WILL HIGHLITE TECHNIQUES AND PATTERNS TO COMBAT THOSE PESKY LITTLE CRITTERS AND HELP MAKE YOUR TRIP A SUCCESS.WALLEYES- HAVE BECOME EXTREMLY MULTI DIMENSIONAL IN THE PAST WEEK OR SO USING MANY DIFF TYPES OF STRUCTURES AND PATTERNS.FOR THE VACATIONER THAT MEANS IT IS VERY EASY TO FIND WALLEYES.IT IS VERY CLOSE TO BEING SOME OF THE MOST CONSISTANT FISHING AS FAR AS CATCHING I'VE SEEN FOR THIS TIME OF THE SEASON IN A FEW YEARS.BIG GROUPS OF WALLEYES ARE STILL USING AND OR MOVING INTO AREAS OF NEWLY EMERGING WEEDS IN BAYS AND ON THE FLATS.MOST CONSISTANT DEPTHS HAVE BEEN 4'-12' AND JIGGING WITH MINNOWS OR PLASTICS BEING THE DOMINATE PRESENTATION AND RECENTLY CRAWLERS HAVE KICKED IN.WITH THE HIGH WATER, AREAS OF CURRENT HAVE BEEN CREATED AND BECOME VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY CHANNELS BETWEEN LAKES OR CONNECTING THE MAIN LAKE WITH OTHER BASINS OR BAYS.ALSO NORMALLY DRY OR SMALL CREEKS THAT ARE NOW DUMPING INTO THE LAKE CAN BE A TEMPORARY BONANZA AREA.TYPICALLY THESE AREAS ARE VERY WARM ,FULL OF SHINERS AND OTHER BAITFISH AND THE FISH ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE SO JIGS WITH PLASTICS AND CRANKS MAKE FOR FAST AND HIGH PERCENTAGE WORK.ROCK AND COMBO WEED BARS OFF MAINLAKE AND ISLAND POINTS ESPECIALLY THOSE OUT FROM LARGE BAYS BUT NOT QUITE IN THE MAIN DEEP BASIN ARE STARTING TO PRODUCE.SOME FISH RIGHT ON TOP AND OTHER GROUPS OF FISH DOWN AS DEEP AS 22'.AGAIN JIGGING OR CRANKING THE TOPS AND JIGGING OR BOTTOM BOUNCING THE DEEPER EDGES WITH SPINNER RIGS AND CRAWLERS OR MINNOWS BEEN BEST.LOTS OF 50-100 FISH DAYS BEEN COMMON WITH SOME DECENT SIZE MIXED IN.MOST BIG FISH COMING SHALLOW.SOME BIG 27-32 WALLEYES BEEN CAUGHT BY MUSKIE FISHERMEN ON BIG BAITS IN THE WEEDS.THESE INDICATORS ALL POINT TO AN APPROACHING FEEDING PEAK AND SOME OF THE BEST FISHING OF THE YEAR.THE 4WD LAKES AND FLY-INS HAVE BEEN SMOKING HOT WITH EASY FISHING SHALLOW ESPECIALLY ON THE DARKER WATERS.PATTERNING HAS BEEN EASY.FISH THE BAYS 4'-12',IF NOT HAPPENING FISH THE POINTS 8'-18' IN BETWEEN THEM OR OFF ISLANDS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH WIND COMING IN AND YOU'LL BE INTO FISH.MUSKIES-STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF COMING TO LIFE.I WAS OUT ON MY FIRST MUSKY TRIP OF THE SEASON YESTERDAY AND WE BOATED A 48 30#'ER,RAISED 6 MORE UP TO AROUND 52,CAUGHT SEVERAL DECENT PIKE AND 32 11# WALLEYE IN ABOUT 5 HRS OF FISHING.MIKE HAS BEEN OUT RAISED AROUND 18-20 THE DAY BEFORE WITH SEVERAL GOOD ONES AND HAS BOATED 6 UP TO 43 AND 22#'S.THE PAST 2 DAYS.CAL AND MIKE BOTH FISHED WITH THE DIMESTORE FISHERMAN CREW AND EACH BOATED 3 UP TO 40AND RAISED 25-30 ON ACTION LAKES.MOST MOVEMENT HAS BEEN ON 7GRAMAS,MED DOGS,600 SERIES BUCHERTAILS,AND BIT ON TOPWATER.LOOK FOR THINGS TO HEAT UP FAST!!!
