521954,FOOTDOC,2002-06-27 20:42:00,139,I am going to Manitoba for the first time and understand the region is barbless. Will they simply let me take a pair of pliers and flatten the barb on my lures? I hope this is the case. Thanks in advance!

The CO's rule is that the barb must be flattened so that if you drag your fingernail backward on the barb, it doesn't dig in.My own feeling is that barbless is a good thing, and once you learn not to give the fish any slack line, you'll rarely lose any.cm"
521957,fishcop,2002-06-28 06:37:00,11,"yes, pliers are ok to use to de barb hooks, I like to use a dremel at home to take them off and sharpen the hook up' however if you don't live in Manitoba, that would mean doing all your tackle. In Manitoba, only the hook on your line needs be barbless, so you don't need to do all your tackle footdoc! Have a great trip- what part are you going to?"
