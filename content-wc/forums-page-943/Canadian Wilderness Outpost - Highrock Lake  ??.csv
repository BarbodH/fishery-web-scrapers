521602,Guest,2002-06-20 09:55:00,0,Canadian Wilderness Outposts is owned by Jordie Turcotte. We are going to Dora lake in two weeks. We did an extensive background check before we booked the trip and received nothing but rave reviews about the class operation he runs.

We went to Mink lake last year and cannot imagine either one screwing up. It was my first trip and the communication, planning, accomodations and hospitality could not have been better. Have a close friend that has used Jordie for many years and keeps going back.Have a great trip."
