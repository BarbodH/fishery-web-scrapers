521901,Dave,2002-06-26 13:11:00,258,We are going to cross over to LV for one day in hopes to land my first Muskie. If anyone would be so kind as to recommend what baits to use and if there are any good spots to try??? Also is the public entrance to the lake easy to find. I am assuming it is right off Hwy 72 and you go through the Park. Any and all help is appreciated! Dave PS- Any smallie tips are welcome.
521902,Guest,2002-06-26 18:37:00,0,"Dave, Try the far West shore for muskies. Huge weedbed that always holds fish. Also Ament Bay and any other area such as reefs and main lake points have always been good for us. Don't forget to make a trolling pass outside of these areas. You may be surprised wats lirking out there. I'v had good luck with silver/black bucktails, med bulldawgs and topwater bait in the evening. A black/silver prism or perch jakes work well when trolling. You don't need to be bumping bottom when trolling during the summer. The fish can come up for the baits and keeps away the snags.If you've got a boat to navigate the creek, head to Maskonge and Hooch lakes. Far West shore. You see the sign. Lots of small muskies, tigers too, up to 40"" and decent northerns. Bucktails with flame colored blades and 6"" firetiger grandma's/shallow raiders have worked well for us. Have had 20+ fish days in there. Barbless hooks only and no live bait. Don't try for smallmouth unless you want a whopper. Not much numbers, but they run very very large in there. Caught them in excess of 20"" on musky baits.Most of all have a good time and enjoy yourself. Hope this helps and let us know how you did."
521903,Karl,2002-06-26 18:50:00,63,"You are correct about the public landing. Just follow the signs in the park. Lake level is high, so be prepared for wading when boat launching. The smallmouth and muskies are everywhere, but the best bet is the rock reefs near Little Vermillion falls into Big Vermillion, or the opposite shoreline of the island in front of the boat launch. These fish have seen everything, so try something new or different. Pop'Rs are the most fun for smallies and work best before the sun gets too high - like 9:00 A.M. The water is so clear you can see them from about 20 feet from your lure. Like little torpedos."
