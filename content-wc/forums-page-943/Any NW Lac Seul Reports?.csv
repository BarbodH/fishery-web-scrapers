We have tradiationally done well in McKenzie Bay area and will likely spend a couple days there. Is everyone still fishing in Sawmill Bay or the Wennasaga, or have the fish moved out into lake structure? Any help on depths, bait and colors is appreached. Thanks for the help?"
521813,Guest,2002-06-24 14:11:00,0,Fished Lac Seul the week of the storm. We caught fish on main lake structure adjacent to the old river bed all the way up into Aldous Bay. Had best luck on jig/minnow and leech combos in 10 to 20 ft water.....Got two 30' Walleyes and lots of slot fish....Good Luck

521815,Guest,2002-06-26 14:07:00,0,"Don't worry about fishing in the NW area. If you can't catch Walleyes on Lac Seul, you should take a few weeks off to gather your thoughs and then quit the sport. Take up something like birdwatching.Fish anywhere from 4 to 20 feet along structure & weeds. If your not catching anything go shallower instead of deeper!"

We were in on the tail end of the Wenesaga river action, I would guess by the time you get there there will be nobody (or fish) there. We did the best in Sawmill in shallow bays in 5-8 ft using slip bobbers & jigging minnows under the boat. Caught several fish over the slot. Things change in 2 weeks though! Good luck!The guide told me that the spawn was 2 weeks late this year. I saw one fish being cleaned that still had eggs in it on the 17th of June (it was >25""). We had a 15 minute wait into Canada and a 2 hour wait to get out at International Falls. Be prepared for a wait."

They are not that much beeter to eat and we've all seen what slots and limits have done for the fishing in Canada over the last 10 years. We occassionally fish five lakes lodge in Gull Rock and they require no fish over 18"" amd I think it's a good idea. Just hate to see those large fish ending up being cleaned,"
