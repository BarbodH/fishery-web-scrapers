521963,Andyeye,2002-06-28 06:36:00,179,Does anyone have any info on this lake? We have fished it a few times but always stayed close to our access point I would like to give it try in August. I know there are some rock hazards and it is a good sized body of water. We fish at the falls where Cygnet Lake runs in but we would like to try some other spots. If anyone can tell me anything I owe you one. Thanks!
