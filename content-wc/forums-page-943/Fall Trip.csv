521891,Guest,2002-06-26 11:46:00,0,We returned a couple of weeks ago from Lac Seul and had such a wonderful experience that my Dad wants to go back this fall. How late into the year can we go and still have some fairly predicatable weather and good fishing? We we're thinking about mid to late September. A friend will be going with us and taking his son who is only about 11 years old. We'd prefer not to freeze him out. Thanks.
521892,Dave,2002-06-26 12:17:00,258,Our group does a fly-in (100 miles north of Red Lake) the week after Labor Day & the weather is fine. Occasionally we get one day with frost. Go for it.
521893,Guest,2002-06-26 12:49:00,0,"Dave,Where do you go and how's the fishing?"
521896,IaDave,2002-06-26 12:53:00,476,"We usually go the third week of Sept. We kind of plan around the full moon. The old saying the best is 3 days before & after. We go to the Sioux Lookout area(Lake Minnitaki). I'd take the fall over the spring anyday, the weather is more consistent,less boats,to me the fishing is just as good with a good chance for huge northerns,the leaves are turning, & the smell of a wood stove. Only negative is the days are shorter."

In fact, we've already reserved again for next June....great accomodations, service, food and fishing. Not the cheapest, but its pretty much first class all the way."

Roderick (base camp)has lake trout, walleye & northern. Where Hornby & Warwick (outposts)are walleye & northern only (catch & release OK to eat fish there but not take any out). We do pretty good in Sept. Biggest was 28"" @ Warwick, 42"" northern last year at Hornby. Good cabins & reliable boats."
