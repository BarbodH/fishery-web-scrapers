521953,Guest,2002-06-27 20:21:00,0,I am looking at a trip with my son and was told this was a great place to take a kid. I do not know a thing about this lake and would like to know where to get maps and any help i can to make this a great trip for my son. We are looking to catch numbers of fish as we will not be keeping any fish. I just want to take him to a place he can catch a bunch of walleye. If you know of a better place in the same area or a bit south please let us know.
