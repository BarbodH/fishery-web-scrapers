521940,Guest,2002-06-27 16:05:00,0,I have heard with towing a boat we should not take Hwy 502 out of Ft Frances but take I believe 17 up and then cut over-- This would be a ways out of the way but well worth the better roads when towing. Is this true??? Has anyone taking Hwy 502 and what is it like? HELP!Thanks guys for the help Best of luck fishing Chad

Out of Fort Frances we took 11 west to 71 north up to 17 then accross to Vermilion Bay and Dryden. 71 is a ton better road than 502, no potholes, lots of flat sections, alot nicer road if you are towing a boat. For us, to get to Eagle River, it takes us about 45 minutes longer than if we took 502, but it is far worth the extra time. We talked to others in camp who came up 502 and said it was rough and pothole filled. So, try and take 71 if you can when towing a boat."
521942,Guest,2002-06-28 07:35:00,0,That is exactly what I heard from another guy who went up a few years back. I guess nothing had changed much. Thanks for the update.Chad

One spot there was a whole section of the northbound side gone! They were asking people to use 17 over to Kenora and the Sioux Narrows route, then there was a bridge out west of Kenora, we went up thru Thunder Bay going in, it was about 90 miles out of our way, but no real delays like there were on 502. By the way, going in at Pigeon River, we were searched, just 2 of us in an RV, we were there 45 minutes for that. Sailed right thru International Falls coming home."

I don't pull a boat, so 502 is just quicker for me. Took 17 home one year for some different scenery, and it is a much better road but took over two hours longer. The road from Duluth to Pidgeon River crossing is one huge tourist trap with average speed 25mph on a Saturday. Highway 53 in N. Minn. has the least amount of construction in many years. One stretch of 11 miles. The rest was in excellent condition.One way or another I'll be fishing in a little over 48 hours from now and driving will be the farthest thing from my mind."
