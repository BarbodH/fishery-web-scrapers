This is the first time we have gone up this late......we usually go for the opener. As we all know, jig and minnow is the main stay for the opener, so what should I look to do to put a few eyes in the boat this time of year? Thanks,"

You might want to try Steamboat and go deep for walleyes.Like you I have mostly a spring pattern guy, with one July trip, we had the best luck in the drop offs near windy points with the cloudy stirred up waters.Good luck! And let us know how you did!"
