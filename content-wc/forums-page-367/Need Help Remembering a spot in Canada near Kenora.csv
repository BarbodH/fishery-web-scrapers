Its been about 7 years since Ive been there and was so in awe of all the scenery that I didnt pay attention the roads and landmarks. We crossed Whitedog Dam and from there im not sure how long of a drive till we got to the launch. I think it was Whitedog lake but not sure. We launched our boat, loaded up our supplies and camped out on an island. We payed the indians to launch and there was camping available by the landing.I was a passenger, but this time trying to make a trip and a tradition of it. Anybody ever fish here or got any ideas where im talking about or been there?"
1945353,quintessential,2013-07-12 21:05:00,3,"I drive that way several times per year. If you follow the Trans Canada highway (17a) on the North side of Kenora, you will reach Hwy #596 and a sign that says ""Minaki"". Follow the road North until it T's off. Minaki to the right, Whitedog road to the left. From that point it's pretty straight forward. Good luck!"
1945417,joeflip,2013-07-12 21:28:00,75,Caribou falls should be just north of the area your talking about. Just north west of Minaki...

1947073,TrollerDude,2013-07-13 20:59:00,33,Thanks For Info ...I Will Let You Guys Know How It Turned Out... Anybody Know Of Any Places Near Kenora That Rent Cabins And Have Boat LaunchEs In Case This Doesn't Pan Out?
1947137,quintessential,2013-07-13 21:26:00,3,Paradise Cove in Minaki...lots of cabins and they have a private boat launch for their guests. I think it costs $45/person/night if I remember correctly. Close enough to White Dog if things don't pan out.There's a lot of good fishing out that way!
