1938377,big popi,2013-07-10 14:21:00,635,"I have been lucky enough to fish the same waters near Atikokan since 1972 when my dad took us up fro the 1st time. The fishing was fantastic then. Becuase i was in the Navy in the early 80s, I was not able to go back up until 1990. From what my Dad has said & what I have seen the walleye fishing has steadily improved. I attribute this to the more stringent limits (4 in possesion, 2 per day) on walleye and the pike slot limit."
1938385,tv4fish,2013-07-10 14:21:00,2694,"I don't know about the ""best ever"" - but, we have been going to Lac Seul (Sioux Lookout area) since 1985 and I think the QUALITY of walleyes has increased since then. We used to catch lots of fish ""back then"", but the problem was they were smaller fish. Now we catch nicer fish.Quick story - on our very first trip (1985) we stopped at that little store that is right north of the intersection of Hwy 11 and 502. At that time it was run by a little sweet Grandma - we went in and asked her where we could go to catch ""lots of big fish"". Her reply was ""spot on"" --- ""You should have been here 50 years ago............"""
1940129,troutwater,2013-07-11 07:04:00,299,Thanks for the responses. I always like to hear what others have to say and it's just a fun topic to discuss. Some good points were brought up like what fish species and what lake it is. There is more to Canada than just the fishing though IMO. Getting out in the wilderness and just enjoying nature is a big part of it to me.
1953098,octanehi5,2013-07-16 06:01:00,1104,"I have fished the same fly in lake in quebec for 10 yrs. The outfitter has imposed a slot of only keeping fish rom 14"" to 20"" Walleye, and pike from 20""to 28"", Also the nimber you may take home is 4 of each, not like the province of quebec's 8 fish. I have watched the average size of fish caught, growing over the yrs. the slot limit works,This yr we hit the perfect storm, what fisherman only dream about. the week before we got to the lake it rained with low pressure for 5 days in a row, along with the water temps only being 59 on sunday the day we arived,the bite was just starting to incriece,as high pressure built the next few day so did the bite,many of our crew of 6 guys set personal bests by weds, of that week from weds. on the wind blew very hard from the south west for 4 days, pileing up the bait fish and walleyes at the north east corner of the lake. it was like catching fish in a barrel. jigs never even touched the bottom before you got hit and this happened all day long for four days. The best fishing in my lifetime,doubled my previus fish caught in one week total. our group also set a record for the numbers of fish caught by 6 guys in a week. The perfect storm"
1953226,Freytown,2013-07-16 06:49:00,770,"Quota's are based on the zone fished in Quebec. Hebert in zone 14 is 8 fish, but the camp rule is only 4."
1953810,Bigfishhunter,2013-07-16 09:01:00,803,"I started guiding on Kississing Lake 10 years ago, and the lodge has kept accurate records of trohpy fish caught and average numbers of fish caught. The average numbers are estimates from the guides through their days. The past five years have seen the numbers of trophy fish go up exponentially, while numbers have decreased somewhat. There might be a relationship between these two, but it is just anecdotal evidence based on experienced guides."
1954098,Kevin R,2013-07-16 09:59:00,305,"The skill of fishing has improved immensely for the average angler along with the equipment boats motors & electronics. In 1977 I was using a paper graph most didn't even have a depth finder. Fishing the same lakes today I have seen a huge decline in the numbers of the most abundant Northern Pike of the 1970's, Smallmouth Bass have increased tremendously all sizes as well as Walleye over 18"". Gone are the massive schools of Perch & cigar to 16"" Walleyes. I have an old video tape of Wabaskang Lake Fishing the summer of 1983 with 15-20 boats all on devils point catching walleye one right after another we (4- people) caught our limit of 24 in about an hour along with many Pike. I have no clue why people point to the decline in fishing during the 1980's it was fantastic in those years I think it's the skill of fishing that has improved more than anything. I look at my bottom machine today & mark a fraction of what I did in the 1970's. if your into bird watching that has increased about 10,000 times more."
1937025,troutwater,2013-07-10 07:54:00,299,"I've heard a few people say this, but just thought I'd get some imput from people who have been going to Canada for a long time. Some of the camp owners say it's the best ever thanks to slots and more restrictive limits, but I've only been going to Canada since 2007 so I don't have that much to go by."
1937145,Aaron-IN,2013-07-10 08:37:00,500,"It obviously depends on the lake but just in general, for the lakes I fish I would have to say NO, it's not the best its ever been but certainly better than it was 10 years ago."
1937177,MrSimon,2013-07-10 08:46:00,922,"I often get caught up in trying to answer questions like these .... its fun to think about. But really, it doesn't matter if the fishing was better in the past. I'm still going to go to Canada. The fishing is still awesome. And I'll still have a GREAT time."
1937321,LOW1,2013-07-10 09:13:00,2828,"I agree with this. For example, we were at the cabin last week and although it was hot (85-90) the humidity was low and it cooled down at night. When we returned to the states the temperature was the same but the humidity about did me in. It's taken me two days to get used to it.I really like the weather in Canada from May 15 to October 15.As far as whether fishing is better now than in the past, it's important to remember that fishermen who fished in the past are just as likely to distort things as are current fishermen.From what I have read though, it sure seems that the abundance of large northern may have decreased. And I would like to know how many, if any, of the large 200+ pound sturgeon are still swimming around in Lake of the Woods."
1937337,drlee,2013-07-10 09:15:00,409,"This is a tough question to answer. I have fished 27 different lakes in northern Ontario since 1987. I have had some great years and some pretty bad ones! The past 10 years I have narrowed my trips down to two lakes, both in the Ignace area. The fishing has been absolutely great during that time period on the two lakes I fish, one for a week every year and the other for two consecutive weeks. Although my fishing success has varied over that decade, I would say it has been relatively consistent. I have never had a trip where we did not catch lots of fish; some weeks, we might go a couple of days with really slow fishing, for a variety of reasons, weather, wind, lack of wind, etc. I hear camp owners and many fishermen say that the fishing in Ontario is better than ever. That may very well be true. The problem is identifying the cause/effect relationship. Is it slots? Reduced limits? More catch/release fishermen? Less pressure due to the economy? Several years of great reproduction? Probably lots of other variables I have not listed. Your guess is as good as mine! There is no doubt that returning to the same lakes, paying attention to what results in better fishing on those lakes, trying new areas/methods/baits, talking to others who fish the same lakes, and increased time spent fishing all contribute to better fishing. I will continue to keep only 15"" - 17"" walleyes to eat; I do take 4 home each trip; I use barbless hooks for quicker fish-friendly releases; I pay strict attention to the laws. Geez, I really love fishing in northern Ontario."
1937513,v-bay gord,2013-07-10 10:18:00,3168,"Depends on the time-line. If it's your 10th year fishing somewhere up here, then probably the answer is yes. If your fishing started back in the 1930's, then probably not. Of course not too many WC members with that experience to draw from...."
1937961,tackleman,2013-07-10 12:41:00,444,"This year I had the best fishing in 20 years on Eagle Lake. So in my opinion it has improved amazingly, ( I just hope it's this good again next year.)"
1937993,v-bay gord,2013-07-10 12:47:00,3168,I think it's more likely your fish catching skills have finally improved!
1938217,eriksat1,2013-07-10 13:38:00,6029,"When I started fishing Lake of the Woods the limit on musky was 28"" and you could keep 2 per day. Yes I think it has improved."
1938233,2746,2013-07-10 13:40:00,3206,"good observation. I started in the very late 60's and fishing is better today. Very much better than the 80's. all my experience has been in Ontario and includes Eagle, LOTW, Lac Seul, Red and Nunguesser. My sense is that it's still improving......certainly not declining."
