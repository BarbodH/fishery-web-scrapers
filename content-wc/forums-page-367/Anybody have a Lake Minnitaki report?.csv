1920882,Guest,2013-07-03 19:01:00,0,"We did OK but not great, caught some good ones at Redpine and lots of small ones at English River but never could get any consistent pattern elsewhere. Fished one hump and found no fish there. One problem was we fished a lot in Lyons Bay, it is close to our camp, but we have often not done much there. Found a spot on Troutfish that was good for those of us using leeches on Sunday, then nothing the next day."
1922810,Troy Mansfield,2013-07-04 21:20:00,22,"I was out guiding this afternoon on minnitaki and we found them stacked on rock piles near the wind loaded shore in less than 12 feet. Casting out and dragging the bottom with a jig and minnow, biggest was 25"". And prolly caught 40 fish total. Majority from 16.5 to 17.75. A few slots. 3 pike. One was 40"". Then when that shut down we moved out to a clay hump that tops at 17' on abram and caught another 10 between 15-18""."
1930346,wiwalleyefreak,2013-07-08 11:33:00,25,Headed up next week...anyone have any fishing reports from the last week? Any thoughts on bait?
1939793,tuiflies,2013-07-10 22:35:00,158,No new updates?
1947417,wiwalleyefreak,2013-07-14 05:09:00,25,"Hoping today is a good day to get some feedback. Headed up to fish Minnitakiin a few days and I am looking to get feedback on how those coming off did, bait used etc. Any info is greatly appreciated. Freak"
1947537,CI_Guy,2013-07-14 06:38:00,2118,"Just got back from 5 days at Minitaki. The mayflies had just hatched & the wind was out of the north and we had to work to catch walleyes. 20"" pike were everywhere. The 4th day the wind was from the south and we caught a lot of 20"" to 27"" walleyes on sunken islands in 17' to 20' deep water. Cranks to locate them and jigging minnows once we found them. Friday morning we went after smallies, find an island with wind, weeds and gravel and they'll be there."
1949417,Troy Mansfield,2013-07-14 21:00:00,22,The walleyes are just moving back out to the humps The fishing should be great and back to normal minnitaki I agree with CI GUY he did it right to locate them and catch them. I was out the other evening and was pulling them out of 17-28ft. You could see the big fish stacked up on the graph at the humps
1952594,wiwalleyefreak,2013-07-15 21:01:00,25,"Troy and CI, Thanks for the info! Have you heard about any one catching any eyes on crawlers? Freak"
1953258,Troy Mansfield,2013-07-16 07:05:00,22,"If it were me coming to fish minnitaki, I'd have a bit of everything. Minnows leeches and worms. I use minnows most of the time myself. But there is def times worms and leeches out do minnows."
1962617,wiwalleyefreak,2013-07-18 21:05:00,25,Leaving tomorrow for Minnitaki. Thanks to all of you who have answered questions on this post. I will be checking the site until early afternoon tomorrow so if anyone has any last minute advice let me have it! Thanks again Freak
1882929,Guest,2013-06-20 08:24:00,0,"Anyone have recent info from Minnitaki? We are up there starting Sat 22 June. To extrapolate from earlier reports, sounds like conditions are more like the 1st or 2nd week of June than the end of June - early post-spawn, fish are shallow in bays or weeds downstream from spawning grounds. Thanks. If you see a Mirrocraft out there, its probably us. We stay at Timber Edge on Butterfly Lake."
1883681,Shotgun,2013-06-20 12:14:00,759,Will be at Timbers Edge the second week of July. This will be our 4th year at this camp. Decent success in years past pulling snells with spinners baited with minnows using bottom bouncers. Please give us a report when you return.
1883705,Red Pine J,2013-06-20 12:18:00,44,"In years past I'd have said ""see ya there"".......but, unfortunatly I'm knot going this year. Just left my pals house here in Missery & he & his are leaving for a week on Minnitaki @ Pickerel Arm Camp. I'm not a happy camper, but, I do wish that all find a good bite & fair winds this week. J."
1883905,skap,2013-06-20 13:01:00,58,"Good afternoon all,Just came back on Tuesday from Minnitaki. Awesome time as always but it was a little different than previous years. The late spring and VERY high water has things backed up a couple weeks. The areas we fished we would normally fish if we were there around Memorial weekend. By mid June the fish should already be out on the deep humps and they were not there yet as of Monday night when we put the poles away. Plenty of fish to be had but they were shallower than normal. I dont think I have ever fished Minnitaki in 5 feet of water before but we did last week. Still a blast, just had to switch to shallow water locations. Rice and English River opened up on Saturday and those areas were busy but productive. Didnt see many other people outside of those areas to be honest. My guess is another week or so and the fish will be in their typical summer locations.Water is very high right now as well. I am heading back up next weekend from June 30th. - July 3rd and expect by then to be in a more summer pattern. Feel free to message me if you have any questions. Happy to help. Good luck to all!!"
1884649,Guest,2013-06-20 17:46:00,0,"Thanks for the report, will let all of you know how we do."
1887025,TomO,2013-06-21 16:13:00,16,"Got back Saturday- water was very high,either 7 or 10 feet depending who you asked. Fish were shallow, Eyes in as low as 3 ft of water. Different patterns from last time for sure. Seemed to be moving deeper by the last day. Smallies not yet on beds as of then"
1905554,Red Pine J,2013-06-28 11:18:00,44,"I don't have details, but, the early report is that the fishin was AWESOME. My pals left today as it was raining. My pals stayed @ Pickerel Arm Camp & said they only left Pickerel Arm acouple of times during their stay. Plenty of fish to be had near camp & on the arm itseft. It's always nice to be able to catch plenty of fish near camp. Will report more details as they come in R P J"
1906810,rnnonmt,2013-06-28 17:59:00,992,Not so good thru the middle of the chutes on June 18th. Watched a boat go through the middle ahead of me. Heard all kind of racket coming from his boat. After he got through he stopped and I pulled up along side of him. Bent over and knocked off about an inch on each blade. OUCH! Yes it was a stainless prop. Double OUCH!!
1908010,IaDave,2013-06-29 09:47:00,476,What a dummy- I guess I was correct saying you could almost run thru the middle
1913362,Red Pine J,2013-07-01 16:25:00,44,Needless to say the fishin was on fire. They only went to Red Pine Bay twice during the week. Stayed on Pickerel Arm the rest of the time. Mayflies had hatched the week b4. Walleye & Smallmouth both biting great!!!!!! R P J
1837081,Guest,2013-06-04 16:56:00,0,Thanks Dave. How was the trip up 502? I heard there was a culvert washed out a few weeks ago.
1838705,IaDave,2013-06-05 06:44:00,476,No problems- couldn't really tell except for a little gravel patch.
1850905,Sportfisher,2013-06-09 16:47:00,47,Any new reports for Minnitaki? 8 of us are leaving 6/16 for a week. ThanksSportfisher
1852266,Cash,2013-06-10 06:48:00,73,I'll be there the same week at Pickerel Arm Camp. Where are you staying?
1852530,Sportfisher,2013-06-10 08:01:00,47,"We are staying at Donnelly's. Leaving early Saturday morning, and can't wait!"
1853866,RoughWaters,2013-06-10 15:01:00,98,Sportfisher-Our group of 9 is going to be at Donnelly's also. Should be fishing by saturday afternoon. Anticipation is building!
1854026,yurtman,2013-06-10 16:02:00,46,"spent the last 4 days up there fishing in the tournament.thursday and friday very slow - some guys catching only 2 or 3 the whole day. completely different on the weekend - lots of fish in 12-18 feet of water. pulled some out of 30+. starting to relate to the humps and deeper structture. lots of slot fish, 19-21"" in the chutes and fast water. ours were caught almost exclusively with bottom bouncers and leeches but some guys having success with crawlers or jig and minnow.2 nice lakers, 36"" and 38"", both hit leeches while we were trying to pull up some large walleye in 35 feet of water. oh yeah, finished 4th"
1856721,Sportfisher,2013-06-11 11:41:00,47,"Rough Waters: I think we are in Cabins 5 and 6. Stop by if we are not out fishing! Older Blue Lund Tyee, Older Green Sportfish and Newer Black Lund Tyee. See ya in the cleaning shack!"
1858449,RoughWaters,2013-06-12 00:45:00,98,"I can't remember which number cabin we are in. Maybe cabin 9? Sounds right, anyway it's the first cabin on the left when walking up from the docks. Our crew has 2 white lund fishermans, a red Prov, and a maroon ranger. Hope to see you on the water! Only a few more days!"
1858833,Sportfisher,2013-06-12 07:12:00,47,"I can't remember the number of our cabins either. As you walk up the ramp from the dock, we are on the left side. IIRC, there is a camp site at the top of the ramp, then a cabin, then another small campsite, and then our two cabins. See you there!!!!Can't wait!!!"
1820721,Cash,2013-05-30 07:20:00,73,"How was the fishing, water levels etc.?"
1822721,BenBeattie,2013-05-30 17:29:00,232,Haven't fished walleye on Minnitaki yet this year but was chasing lakers yesterday. Water levels are quite high on Minnitaki right now. Most rocks that are usually poking above are hidden.
1822849,fishguide1800,2013-05-30 18:13:00,84,Buddie of mine fished there 2 days ago.said they did good.but slower action.another week it should get better.
1823473,TomO,2013-05-30 21:04:00,16,Ben-how was the Laker action?- I leave a week from tomorrow (love to bump this a couple times this week
1825601,BenBeattie,2013-05-31 15:37:00,232,"It was alright, Tom. Caught a few, all in the 28-32"" range. You chase lakers a lot when you're up here?"
1825977,zeebee,2013-05-31 17:41:00,1144,"Spoke with a fellow who resides on Abrahms and he has spent the last 24 hrs battling fast rising waters after unusual rainfall..playing havoc with his dock which also happens to support a hot tub and sunroom. Hmmm. I need to pay a visit me thinks. Assuming of course he gets things under control. Ashamedly, Im a fair weather friend. Point being, water levels are highest they've been in a while. Good for those coming in from Butterfly lake tho as long as one is aware of newly submerged rock elsewhere."
1826641,TomO,2013-05-31 22:14:00,16,Only been up once before. Didnt have any luck. I've caught some on Lake Michigan but plan to target them a bit more this time up. A guy in our group last time caught a 40 inch brute
1827033,IaDave,2013-06-01 08:17:00,476,Just got back yesterday- Water levels are the highest I have ever seen and were rising. Fishing for me was just okay with nothing over the slot but others caught some. Fished mainly Abrams and Botsford and the river between with current being the key. I did go into Minnitaki to get to Alcona Bay and had no luck which surprised me. It was an early morning and dusk bite(8-9:30 pm). I would think from here on out it will only get better once the water starts warming up. Surface temps ranged from 49 in the main lake and up to 57 in the bays in the afternoons. I overheard a guide tell someone the temp in 30' was around 36 still. Always great to get up there no matter the fishing and look forward to going back the last week of August.
1832465,tv4fish,2013-06-03 14:10:00,2694,"Wow Dave - The water must have been really ""boiling"" through the Chutes, then???"
1832553,IaDave,2013-06-03 14:46:00,476,It was boiling for sure-No problem getting into Minnitaki. I think you could almost run it right thru the middle.
