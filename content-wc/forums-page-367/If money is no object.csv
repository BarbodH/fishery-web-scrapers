1960889,pike50plus,2013-07-18 11:15:00,584,We are actually looking for a great Alaska place for next year.
1962993,octanehi5,2013-07-19 05:58:00,1104,"pike50plus. I did give you my opinion on the best place, money no object,I did not miss anything. You did post on a walleye site , Alaska is not noted for their walleyes. There were a few responders that agree with me.Good luck in you endevers"
1938625,vteye,2013-07-10 15:42:00,812,"Hmm, anywhere, money not a concern, I haven't experienced high endpike, walleye fishing fully guided, guest lodge etc. but...I have fished the Bristol Bay area of Alaska out of Dillingham, unguided river float trips a couple of times. A guided Alaskan river trip at Togiak River Fishing Adventures would be a bucket list. Float trip can be done for fraction of the list price on a do it yourself basis. http://www.fishtrfa.com/p/the-fishing.html"
1940353,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-07-11 07:57:00,358,"Gratuities are also expected above the grand a day. Your guide, boat boy, waitress, maid, cook, and pilot expect tips. Guidelines are usually posted in the cabin."
1941137,2746,2013-07-11 11:37:00,3206,"Took a trip like that twenty years ago......one of those ""I've always wanted to do this"" kind of trips. Meals to die for, guides and prepared shore lunch along with out of this world northern and lark trout fishing. It was an experience I enjoyed but not as much as I thought I would. Being waited on and having someone else run the boat and find the fish was not my cup of tea. Much prefer our drive to or fly ins where I play a larger role in the trip. Also, the people we met there were nice but ""monied"" if you know what I mean. Dressed like they just stepped out of a Cabela's catalog. having said that.....if someone else is paying take advantage of the experience."
1942217,wallydave,2013-07-11 19:23:00,2151,"If money was no concern, Hawk Lake would be an option, Eddie North, Walston, Gunisao, and so many more !! Enjoy every moment, and give us a report when you get back!"
1942601,pikeman14,2013-07-11 22:15:00,144,"Sounds like an offer you can't refuse! I can only dream about a trip like that. I do agree with Larrym on the other hand. Being waited on hand and foot can be nice for some, but I feel more comfortable driving the boat or picking up my own fish. I would love to fish Wollaston, Ganglers, etc type lakes, maybe there is a more reasonable priced lodge in the area for common folk. Please let us know if it's as great as Babe Winkelman/ In fisherman sweepstakes winners say it is."
1942817,Kevin R,2013-07-12 05:42:00,305,"I posted this a few years back & have only been at the Lodge for a week back in 1997, Dick had recently opened it.The fishing, cabins huge spacious luxurious, boats full equipment 50hp Hondas, food & service was outstanding. We caught about 100 walleye a day per person between 16-20"" northern pike were common over 40"" often they would take hold of a walleye that you just hooked. They offered guides but the lake had so many fish you could catch almost anywhere in the lake with little to no skill. I tried to go a few times after my first trip but they filled out fast & the open times didn't work for me. Some of my friends did get back & they all said it kept getting better in all aspects each season it's hard to believe you are talking about the same place."
1943089,muskyroller,2013-07-12 07:24:00,56,"This is a no-brainer for me...I want to chase big pike and the ""place"" for this is on Great Slave Lake at Talston Bay. 3700$ for the week puts it out of my price range, though. That doesn't include the 1,000$ plane ticket from Minneapolis!So, for 5,000 I could have the trip of dreams...maybe some day?!?!google it if you have never seen the website or heard of it...amazing stuff."
1950122,octanehi5,2013-07-15 08:46:00,1104,"In my mind somehow being waited on hand and foot. does not go with the great north fishing trip.Being somewhat self sustaining in a more remote setting with not many people around.catching lots of fish, finding your own spots.Cooking,drinking smoking cigars were you want and when you want.Breakfast is after you catch a lot of fish not before, shore lunch is better because you made it. Dinner is made of the things you brought, it could be steak, shrimp, lobster what ever.Your time you spent with your friends PRICELESS.Read my posts on Canada Eh and strickly fishing about Lake Hebert in Quebec.This trip can be had for $1500, It was a trip that will be hard to beat, I do not care what lake you go to. With my $5000 I will stay with Air Tamarac ,Take three trips, with money left over.Money is not everything,Its about the quality of the time you spend in life, with your friends not someone who is payed to do so."
1952170,bear52,2013-07-15 19:14:00,3,"octane .these are my thoughts exactly.I have fished with some guys for 35 yrs.Yea we have had some new guys added to our group and some have died over the years.Some were very close friends .I can remember every trip some were in places where the fishing wasn`t that good ,some where the camps were less than acceptable.BUT the friendship and hardship of these places make for good ""camp tales"" and make the good times even better.A remote cabin with a group of guys that are friends is a vacation that needs nothing.I like to think that it`s just extra ,,to catch fish.I can`t wait to get back. Barry"
1956513,octanehi5,2013-07-17 06:08:00,1104,"I start planning my next trip the minuit I land in the plane, I would go on such a trip just to see how it went but would not give up my remote trip to the great north.If you had that much money just buy the lake and stay there for the season, fly in the wine, women and song.if money was no object"
1152367,celticbass1,2009-12-05 21:07:00,67,"Okay guy's, here is an interesting one. I have a brother who is getting a pretty large bonus this year and he is familiar with a lodge called Wollaston Lake Lodge. He has decided he wants to go to this place with two sons and has invited me (free of charge) to go along to be in the boat with one of the sons every other day. This place is over $4000.00 for a four day trip per person and I was wondering: 1. Have any of you been here and is it really worth that much? 2. Do you guy's think you would enjoy a place that you have to use a guide while fishing? 3. Can you name a place in Canada in the same general price range that you would rather go? and if so why? Thanks for any input"
1152383,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-05 22:53:00,803,"This pains me to say, because they were my primary competition for many years, but they really are one of the best. They do virtually everything right, don't forget that price is taking care of you right from Winnipeg, many places don't take that into account. You are flying in on their airline not some other over priced air service. Fishing with guides (good ones) can be a lot of fun. If you just trust that they know what they are doing, get to know them joke around with them you will have a blast. Guides work hard for guys who put a good vibe in their boat, not always for the tip, they want to enjoy their day too. A good vibe means not freaking out or making stupid comments when the fish are off a bit. Others may have different ideas, but I could probably point out some flaws for most, very few places can compete with Wollaston."
1152384,LeeMB,2009-12-05 22:54:00,83,"Wollaston is worth the money. Some of the best Pike fishing you will ever see. Most of the guides are quite knowlegable fishermen. On a big lake they can save you lots of time and energy. If you haven't fished with a good guide you will really enjoy it, and learn lots. It also allows you more fishing time and less boat driving time.Some of the other places in that price range that are very good would be, Ganglers, Neultin, Webbers, and Gods Lake to name a few."
1152431,celticbass1,2009-12-06 07:28:00,67,"Thanks for the thoughts guy's, I think I'll go and have a great time. I did think it could be very interesting to have a guide teach me a few things about finding big Pike so I'm looking very forward to that."
1152756,Kevin R,2009-12-07 18:03:00,305,"http://www.guardianeagle.com/This needs to be on the list, the fishing is great as is everthing about this place. They were booked for the season when I checked for some friends a couple years ago."
1934265,pike50plus,2013-07-09 10:39:00,584,"Per Spence Petros ' the best Canadian lake I ever fished"""
1934489,SinOrSwim,2013-07-09 11:41:00,1528,"We went to this place many O' years ago. Found it at one of the All Canada Shows. We did a fly-in then a boat in, so didnt' stay at main lodge. Which was beautiful. However, WORST trip we have EVER taken. Not even close. I mentioned this in another thread months ago and it was brought to my attention the main owner died awhile back. So, I'm not going to go negative and maybe (I'm sure) others have had a great time."
1936025,Iowa Hawkeye,2013-07-09 19:08:00,90,WOW you're saying its $1000 per day per person?? I hope they wipe you with 100 dollar bills
1936249,NWwalleye,2013-07-09 20:31:00,223,"I have a good buddy that is guiding at Wollaston Lake Lodge right now.. Dave McSween ... He has been sending me pictures... I tell you, that some day when I win the lottery...I am going up there for some awesome fishing ...Make the trip .... I am sure that you will NOT be disappointed !!!!!!!!!!!!"
1936609,ftfarms,2013-07-10 05:22:00,444,Well if I hit my head hard enough and decided I didn't like my money any more that would be one place at the top of the list along with buds gunasao lake resort.
