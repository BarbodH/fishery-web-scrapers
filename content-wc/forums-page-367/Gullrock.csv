1937985,2746,2013-07-10 12:47:00,3206,"Thanks tackleman, I hoped you might see this. With some luck the mayflies will be done by Saturday when we get there. The depths are about what I would expect for this time of year. Hot here in Iowa and looks like it is there as well. May drive fish a bit deeper by next week. Maybe we will see you on the water."

End June I was in 4-6fow and nailin them.I would work on top of the flats in 8-12fow but like tackleman said from what I am hearing 12-18 seems to be good but still getting a few reports of shallow fish Northerns are starting to move in to the weeds. With late ice they are finally starting to appear. Good Luck wish I was headin back, but have to wait till September!"
