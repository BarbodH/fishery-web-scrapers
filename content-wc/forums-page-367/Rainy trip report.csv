1924738,OldRook,2013-07-05 22:52:00,16,"Just rolled out of camp narrows this afternoon. First serious trip to rainy and first time on the north end. Got into camp Sunday Fishing was good, not great. Took us a few trips and lots of helpful tips from neighbors to put us on numbers of fish Once we figured out the windy points and chunk rock it got much better. Never killed the fish, but had some good days. 15 smallies in 1.5 hrs was the best stretch for the wife and I Caught a number of walleyed. Several each day. My son picked up a 5lb and 6 lb walleye on consecutive days. The wife and I caught 9 and 10 lb pike respectively. Wife had a 5. Lb smallie right up to the boat and I won't mention who blew the net job. No 5 jointed shad rap in crawfish color (deep diver) was money Jerk baits worked well and a chartreuse mr twister grubb on a 1/8 oz jig head kept us in eating fish and got us on fish the first day Tipped with a crawler or a leech The fish appeared to be transitioning from spawn to main lake. Great trip and the camp was clean and functional Tom is extremely personable. Good trip, great country and weather!!!!!"

It's great when others in camp will help get you on fish (especially if it's your first time on that lake or area). Our group is thinking about Camp Narrows for next Spring, so I appreciated your comments. Rich B"
1925610,Nimstug,2013-07-06 11:56:00,2605,I'm the one that tossed C.N. out as a suggestion and am glad to hear you had a good time. Where was the general area you got into the smallies? I'd have to guess Alexandria.
1926490,OldRook,2013-07-06 21:12:00,16,"I think you will be pleased with camp narrows. Clean and functional and Tom is a very nice, laid back guy. Correct. Once we found Alexandria we spent a bit of time there. Our best fish actually came from the main lake and north a ways. Saw zero boats up there. Don't know the exact name but a good distance above Cherry island. Really thinking about a return trip in Sept!!!!"
1946657,wishow,2013-07-13 17:21:00,19,"Glad you had a good time. I just got back today from Camp Narrows, good camp, Tom is a good guy. Tom wasn't in camp for the first couple of days and the info from his dad was, well let's say dated to say the least. The weather was terrible for most of the week. Saturday-down pour all day,Sunday same, Monday almost as bad, Tuesday- bright sun, calm and 90 degrees plus. Wednesday back to very strong winds and rain etc. Most everyone left Friday at some time as even worse weather was on its way. Fishing was as bad as weather, but that isn't Camp Narrows fault. I would like to find something closer to the Alexandria bay area though, we probably put 60 miles on the boat, that gets expensive for a few fish."
1947169,Nimstug,2013-07-13 21:35:00,2605,"Cascade Camp is another boat in camp that is WAY above Ash Bay at the top of a narrow bay. Unless something has change, I understand you boat in from Fort Frances. I don' t think they have a website but I found this: http://thefisheries.com/links.html and a 10 year old Walleye Central thread https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...p/t-71201.html Nimstug"
1947705,OldRook,2013-07-14 07:30:00,16,Bummer on the weather Wishow. Always roll the dice on that don't we? I think camp narrows is the closest to Alex. That is my understanding from a couple of long time guests there I am seriously considering a fall trip. Just have to see where we are at in relocating from MS to MI!! Just about home to MS now- spent a week working up north after the Canada trip Man it's already hot in middle tn. Home is gonna be a cooker!
1952122,wishow,2013-07-15 19:03:00,19,"Good luck with the heat. It's 92 in Wisconsin and that's 20 degrees more than I need! The thing I found frustrating about that area of Rainy lake is that if the ""shore bite"" isn't working there is no other option. Everything is the same, no deep water humps to fish, and with one line per person, you can't break out the planer boards and start covering open water. Tom was at a complete loss as to what to do.Don't know, if I do go back it would be much earlier in the year for sure."
1952194,Nimstug,2013-07-15 19:19:00,2605,"I know where there are some humps around Camp Narrows. And no, I'm not telling. Seriously, they are there and they are on at least two different charts covering the same general area. I have the map we've used on all our 5 trips and Tom pointed them out and circled them on our first trip. There may not be as many as other places - that I don't know - but there are humps. Many of them are very well marked. Nimstug..who is not a planer board kind of guy as it is."
