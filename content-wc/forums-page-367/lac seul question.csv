1953498,Troy Mansfield,2013-07-16 08:07:00,22,I can find out. Ill ask the game warden. I usually run into them in my line of work
1955434,rnnonmt,2013-07-16 17:34:00,992,Just a guess but it's probably the same as being over your limit. Either way its more than you want to spend!
1952018,rommel,2013-07-15 18:14:00,369,i know that i have to put walleyes in a cooler on lac seul but what about northerns that would have to be a pretty wide cooler for northerns any help would be appreciated
1952042,wallydave,2013-07-15 18:20:00,2151,"On Lac Seul your ""keeper"" fish have to be dead. With walleye I lift up on the top jaw to break the spine. With pike, the boats at Goose Bay are equipped with a wooden club. I usually release pike so I have never tried the spine method. Good fishing!"
1952066,rommel,2013-07-15 18:29:00,369,do you gut them prior to icing them? sorry for being so naive about this but the whole concept is new to me
1952082,rnnonmt,2013-07-15 18:37:00,992,Yep! All keepers must be dead. If you don't want to snap necks or beat the northerns you can get a good set of bone shears and snip the gill plate. It's a bit messier but less traumatic for the fish and maybe the fisherman. Some prefer the snip and bleed method claiming the meat is whiter and better but I can't tell the difference. Bring enough block ice or frozen 1/2 gallon jugs to keep the fish cool for the day. This year I used my live well for a cooler. Used frozen gallon jugs and a wet towel(s) to keep the fish cool until we were off the lake for the day. Rinse the jugs off and rotate them back into your freezer.
1952090,rnnonmt,2013-07-15 18:39:00,992,No need for gutting but I guess you could if you prefer. But definitely not necessary.
1952146,new hips,2013-07-15 19:10:00,498,"find yourself a burlap potato bag, throw it in the cooler with gallon ice jugs, no slime in the cooler, rinse the bag good after use."
1952186,zeebee,2013-07-15 19:16:00,1144,Learn to fillet on the fat end of a paddle when encountering 3 ft waves.... remember the SNL skit of the Rabbi circumcising a newborn in a Lincoln on a washboard road ?....same but different...both need to preserve as much meat as possible. Call me 3 finger Joe...god knows the hooker did last night. Burlap need be used only for the ugly ones.

1953282,Troy Mansfield,2013-07-16 07:18:00,22,I fill the cooler half full of ice and I take a knife And slide it behind the gills on Walleyes and northerns And I bleed them out. It makes a difference on how clean your meat is. No tast difference And clean up is easier. I'm against snapping necks because it can cause grief in the fish house for who's doing the filleting And if you keep a walleye just under the slot and you break it's neck. It can now be stretched a little further and could create some grief from the CO. I've actually witness this. And my friend got a fine. He took it to court to make a point. And charges were dropped There's no need to be clubbing the snot out of fish. Make it a classy harvest.
1953450,wallydave,2013-07-16 07:57:00,2151,"Its good to know there might be a better way than clubbing or snapping. For the longest time, we just left the fish in the cooler with ice, then I saw a thread about the dead fish rule! Yikes that might have gotten expensive!! What would the fine be for a live fish on LS?"
