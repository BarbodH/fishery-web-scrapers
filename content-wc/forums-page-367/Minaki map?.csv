1938665,Guest,2013-07-10 15:56:00,0,Going to Minaki for the first time in August and looking for the Navionics chip that will work for that area. Thanks for any help Tracey
1939145,timvigen,2013-07-10 18:35:00,42,"I'm pretty sure you need the Navionics great lakes region,its not on the canadian map as far as I know,If your staying at Paradise Cove, Duane **** will put you on fish, ( his name got censored because its the oppisite of heaven,but its his real name)"
1939921,manitobawalleye,2013-07-11 05:30:00,885,Navionics Gold 2XG SE Alaska Canada is the one you want.
1939985,JohnG,2013-07-11 05:59:00,74,"Navionics north chip also has all of the Winnipeg river system, up to and including big sand."
1940097,Aaron-IN,2013-07-11 06:55:00,500,"Be careful, there are plenty of rocks to hit that aren't on the lake maps."
1945625,Bigiver,2013-07-13 05:45:00,94,"I have the Minaki area up to Big Sand on the Navionics N-5 chip as well as the Great Lakes chip. It is an overlay and not a survey lake so it is close but not perfect. It is in fathoms and not in feet or meters and not all of the contour lines connect. Arron-In is right and not all the rocks are on the map. I have not seen the Navionics Gold 2XG SE Alaska Canada chip Manitobawalleye, is it a better map?"
1951338,jignminow,2013-07-15 14:26:00,168,The Great Lakes is the chip that I use....
1952690,manitobawalleye,2013-07-15 21:28:00,885,I am not sure if it is better. The bonus with the SE Alaska Canada chip is that it has the most Manitoba waters. The Winnipeg River from LOTW all the way up to and including Lake Winnipeg.
1952746,Guest,2013-07-15 21:42:00,0,Thanks for help guys I got the Premium North Chip it has all the way to big Sand and updates the lakes I normally fish. The new Canda premium is supposed to have big and little Sand also. Hope the eyes are hungry in August.
