1962257,Golden Eagle,2013-07-18 18:45:00,2642,"Two years ago, in October, my wife and I rode the 185 round trip to the camp of a competitor. Jim had some stories for us.Pretty sure Booi is using the Caravan amphibian that's parked at the airport this season. Owned by Superior Airways and uses Red Lake Airport for taking off, but lands on the lake. Rode it May 30 and June 8. Really sweet. Quiet cockpit. Ear plugs not needed.Buy it while I'm young enough and I'll put together a party to visit your camp."
1962393,eyemike,2013-07-18 19:31:00,233,"We flew in on Superior Airways, Very nice big plane. Jim is quite the story teller! Very friendly. I really enjoyed talking with him."
1962497,Golden Eagle,2013-07-18 20:06:00,2642,"And Jim's late dad, Ron, was quite an interesting guy."
1956010,eyemike,2013-07-16 20:13:00,233,"My wife and I returned home from Booi's Trout Lake Lodge and Outposts on Sunday. What a great trip! Very few walleyes 18 or under. Biggest ran at 25 and we caught 6. Lots of 23's and 24's. Not many pike but the ones we caught were really nice. the largest at better than 43 inches. Good weather, excellent boats, very nice accommodations."
1956194,stjoeguy,2013-07-16 21:04:00,979,Looks like you had a great trip!
1956721,zeebee,2013-07-17 07:05:00,1144,Very nice. I will miss Boois and Jim and Traci this year as I cant get away until Sept 2 and they are shuttering the place up in mid Aug this year.Gonna stay at Cat Island Resort for the 1st time. Thanks for the pics. I think I recognize the shorelines in the background. Gets me stoked.
1958297,eyemike,2013-07-17 15:08:00,233,"zeebee, the pike came west of that little tiny island just north of the cabins. We stopped there on our way back to the cabins and fished the cabbage picking up a couple of walleyes for supper."
1958433,zeebee,2013-07-17 15:49:00,1144,"That's in the vicinity I caught a 47"" last Aug......20' over 35'. I was a few hundred yards N and towards the shore. Hit a trolled Deep Husky Rap DHJ 12 in perch. Initially I thought I was snagged until I realized the depth of the water. He was like a log until he too realized he was hooked and then all **** broke loose. Lotsa fun.Did you chase any Lakers?"
1958945,eyemike,2013-07-17 19:05:00,233,That is right in the same area. #8 Shadrap orangeish gold 15ft. I did not spend much time on lakers (I should have) Those that did did very well. They were catching numbers and size in as little as 18ft. of water out to 85 ft. Out buy Hag hole.
1960217,zeebee,2013-07-18 07:59:00,1144,"Thanks for the posts. I was doing quite well with 6 weeks to go. Now, Im beside myself with anticipation. As for the lakers, I take in a portable downrigger and its a fish every 15 min. Two years ago we latched onto a 33 lbs brute. Ive been as far as the NWT for lakers and Trout Lake holds its own both for size and numbers.Will be staying at Cat Island this year as Boois is shutting down mid August (Traci gets real itchy to get back home after a couple of mo up there). Stopped by Cat last year for a looksy and had a couple of beer with my son in their lounge. Strictly American Plan.I like restaurants but not on a fishing trip. Got the bill for our 4 beer.. $50...ouch and this after I towed one of their guests in when they blew a head gasket on the Yamaha. Its my only option for a Sept trip however."
1960273,Golden Eagle,2013-07-18 08:22:00,2642,It might be worth a try to see if Jim would let you stay a week or so in camp with nobody else around. He's in the air quite a bit in his 185 and would probably look in on you a couple of times. That means that you bring in a couple of extra walleyes when you see him touch down.Could be one of your best ever fishing experiences. I've done it a few times at another camp and it works.
1960377,zeebee,2013-07-18 08:43:00,1144,"Would be great if I could work that out however, Jim may have sold his 185. Suppose they are scaling back and wanna spend more time away from the business. I heard this year his guests are flown in with a 3rd party charter. If I were 20 years younger Id buy that place. Its got tremendous potential and they are not interested in marketing it at all."
1961569,eyemike,2013-07-18 15:04:00,233,Jim still has his 185 just don't fly as much. He told me that upkeep is really high. Next time in I will have to try for trout.
