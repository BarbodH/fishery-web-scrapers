1963289,Hump,2013-07-19 08:19:00,578,"I was having a discussion with a friend about fish regulations in Ontario. I said that the limit, with a regular license is 4 in possession and you can have 1 walleye over 18 inches for trophy mounting only. He said his group observes the 4 fish limit but keep 3 18 and under but fillets one ver 18 inches. I said he is illegal. Who is correct?"
1963305,Lovetofish,2013-07-19 08:27:00,458,"I fish by Pickle Lake and we can keep one 18.1"" or bigger walleye to eat or take home."
1963385,Aaron-IN,2013-07-19 08:51:00,500,You friend is correct.
1963393,phishfearme,2013-07-19 08:55:00,1242,"possession limit is 4 - no matter what form they are in - whole, filleted, frozen - or actually even in your stomach. one of these can be over 18.1 inches."
1963409,tv4fish,2013-07-19 08:57:00,2694,"We need to know which body of water you are talking about:[QUOTE] there are several slot sizes that are in force in Ontario, you must check the regulations to verify that you do not possess any species in the slot limit for that species or that particular lake you are fishing on.On Lac Seul you cant have a walleye between 18 to 21 inches in your posession, but you can have one of your 4 that is over 21"" [QUOTE]"
1963449,FrankLeigh,2013-07-19 09:08:00,80,"I have lived and fished in Ontario all of my life and I do not ever recall seeing anything in the regulations about the one over 18"" (most zones) being for ""trophy mounting only"". Who would mount an 18"" fish anyway?The regulations link is available on this board.Have a good summer.Frank"
