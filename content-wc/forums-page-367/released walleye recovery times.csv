I still wonder about their ""recovery"" time. phish"
1950906,phishfearme,2013-07-15 11:57:00,1242,"there was a 6-7ft weedy break line entirely around the lake - anywhere from 7 ft to 11 ft deep off this break line produced very nice fish for the first 4 days or so. three areas around this break line produced better than others but they were pretty extensive. maybe size does matter. like I mentioned before - there's probably way too many variables to enable any meaningful answer to my issue. by the way, your avatar indicates that you got both younger and handsomer - what's your secret? phish"
1938417,phishfearme,2013-07-10 14:27:00,1242,"I've been fortunate enough to ""open or re-open"" four or five lakes for some outfitters. these lakes were all the ""private lake"" types (relatively small lakes with a single cabin on them) and they were either never fished previously or were closed for about 10 years. I have noticed something consistent among all these: hot spots are hot for only a very limited time. in my most recent experience, this happened over all spots in the entire lake. the first 3-4 days of the trip were about the best fishing one could expect for both size and numbers - but by day 7 or 8 we had a very hard time to even catch dinner. changed tactic and locations also but to no avail. so - got to wondering about released walleye recovery times. I am absolutely sure that we've caught ABC fish (already been caught) so some fish must recover quickly but our most recent experience (which matches much of our previous experience) is just hard to understand. any opinions out there - or better yet, any similar experiences or does anyone know of any studies? I am sure there's LOTS of variables (handling times, live bait/lures, depth, etc.) - and there's one item we discussed as we trolled our way into a pretty strong wind towards a point of land catching fish after fish and releasing the fish a good 200ft plus from where they were caught as the wind blew the boat back. could this ""relocation"" away from where they were with their ""friends"" also have a big impact? (we never made it to that point of land on the first day!!) thanks, phish"

1938761,tooski,2013-07-10 16:21:00,393,"So your question applies to the ""virgin"" lakes or your experiences on all lakes in general? I did not notice this trend on Richter and it was a relatively small ""virgin"" lake but now that I think back on it the weather caused us to fish differently the last couple days so we weren't hitting the same spots. Maybe the size of the lake, but I thought you were on some pretty big water a year or two ago.?? Interesting point, looking forward to any responses with similar results...."
1938817,1jigfish2,2013-07-10 17:02:00,110,"Three years ago, our group caught the same 25"" walleye 5 times in 1 day. It stayed within a small area the entire time. We were jig and minnow fishing, and are careful with the fish. We have more often fished a hot spot, caught lots, then nothing. We would come back later and it was hot for a while again."
1940497,phishfearme,2013-07-11 08:38:00,1242,"[QUOTE=tooski;1938761] So your question applies to the ""virgin"" lakes or your experiences on all lakes in general? especially to small untouched lakes but even to large lakes that are fished almost daily during the season. for the larger lakes, I'm certain that there are always hot spots yet to be found. for the last lake I mentioned (small with well defined structure), we were able to hit every spot many, many times. [QUOTE=tooski;1938761] I did not notice this trend on Richter. isn't richter more of a james bay lowlands lake where underwater structure is limited and fish are more nomadic - ie; they travel around chasing their food source? I think that fish that relate to structure tend to act differently. [QUOTE=tooski;1938761] Maybe the size of the lake, but I thought you were on some pretty big water a year or two ago.?? last year at Williams lake - which is actually 3 large lakes - we had the best luck at lake 3 (furthest from the cabin) and it acted like I described; hots spots died and were worthless later in the week. phish"
1941353,fourt2,2013-07-11 12:45:00,45,"Interesting topic! I don't know about how walleye react, but I read an article (In-Fisherman) a few years ago about bass and their recovery to being caught. For the fish studied (believe it was a University of Minnesota study), age of the fish played a significant role in recovery time. Older (wiser?) fish took far longer to return to feeding activity than younger fish after having been caught. I assume (but don't know for fact) that the researchers controlled other variables (handling time, etc.).Younger bass would strike again within minutes, the wily veterans could wait a day or more.I do know that on Red Lake I've caught the same walleye 3 days in a row at roughly the same time and at the same spot..."

Older (wiser?) fish took far longer to return to feeding activity than younger fish. this is quite consistent with our recent experience. for the first 2 or 3 days the AVERAGE size of the walleye we were catching was 19 inches - no BS. these fish are about 10 years old and after being caught they just disappeared. the size of the fish we caught continued to decrease until we weren't catching anything at all. from my experience, I agree with this conclusion - so size does matter! phish"

Three different times I have got on schools of walleyes that were 6 to 9 plus pounds,caught a bunch on that spot and never caught another fish there.Twice the fish were in shallow water,3 to 4 feet deep.Once they were in a saddle between a point and a rock reef.They just had a bunch of baitfish in there and were feeding."
1945633,stillangling,2013-07-13 06:05:00,149,"I think that recovery times are minimal when you immediately release fish. At least in shallow water and fish that are not hooked deep. One two occasions that I can confirm, I caught the same fish right after releasing it. One was a walleye. It was tagged so I recorded the tag number before pitching it back. Threw the boat in gear to start trolling again and bang, it hammered my spinner and minnow. Same fish and it fought like crazy the second time! On another occasion I caught a smallmouth with a unique wound on it. Landed it a few minutes later. I'm sure this happens all the time but we just right them off as fish of the same size."
1946049,tooski,2013-07-13 09:49:00,393,"Phish, I certainly don't have the answer but some good replies got me thinking more and I was wondering if the ""hot spots"" were relatively small. Looking back at the two Richter trips ( I chose Richter since it was relatively small and virgin) there was a shoreline around 1/4 mile long that stayed consistently good while the smaller areas did cool off somewhat as the week progressed...."
