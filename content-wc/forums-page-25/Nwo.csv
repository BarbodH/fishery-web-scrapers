6696006,prov1800,2022-11-09 14:50:00,5010,Good luck in 212 days.
6696022,prov1800,2022-11-09 18:37:00,5010,Looks like a snowstorm coming.Hope it's not like last year's.Cut some poles to hold up the roofs on my deer blinds just in case.https://youtu.be/7WDa7sgAv5Y
6695462,last chance,2022-11-05 13:28:00,3262,"I would have loved to have been with you on that hunt. i grew up in rural TN but never really hunted birds as I left for IN at the ripe old age of 14 and went to work. the only hunting after that was for rabbits in IN but made many trips back to TN and hunted rabbits down there. now we would walk fields and get a few quail but never seen any other birds. at times we jumped some grouse just walking through heavy brush rabbit hunting. but by the time we got over the shock from busting them they were always too far gone to shoot. i have eaten grilled pheasant and chuckers and do believe it was the best meat I have ever eaten. a friend of mine had taken them while hunting a little farther west of IN and brought a few to a cookout we were having. however, rabbit back is also one of my favorite meats to eat. I am 71 now and don't hunt them anymore as all my friends have died and I just don't have the need to hunt by myself. but I still hunt our muzzleloader season but gave up the bow and gun seasons. I have a Thompson center encore 50 that I'm letting my 15 yr old granddaughter shoot. then my rifle is the CVA 45 v2 accura long range with the nitride finish. my granddaughter hasn't hunted yet but i plan to change that this year. she is going to practice with me tomorrow."
6695464,prov1800,2022-11-05 13:39:00,5010,Sounds awesome your grandkids like the outdoors and you will take them out.Iam 70 this year but still head out a lot by myself.Got a 76 year old buddie up from WI hunting deer right now.No luck yet.Deer herd got pretty much wiped out here last winter and everything is coming at night.Has another week here yet.
6695520,prov1800,2022-11-06 07:17:00,5010,Good morning from Vermilion Bay.
6695682,Skywagon,2022-11-07 05:33:00,1106,"I went grouse hunting Saturday for the last time this year. We knew the good weather was past due to run out. Now that the in between season is finally upon us, it will be a good time to spend in the shop, service the toys and wait for freeze-up."
6695688,prov1800,2022-11-07 06:03:00,5010,Get them ice shacks ready
6695692,Eckohlt,2022-11-07 06:31:00,3685,Ditto on them shacks!
6695754,Skywagon,2022-11-07 11:42:00,1106,"No worry about the shacks, they are all headed in the direction of the lake waiting to go."
6695758,Skywagon,2022-11-07 11:53:00,1106,"Spoils from Saturday's grouse hunt were on the menu today, along with sweet Potatoe fries and spice cake."
6695762,prov1800,2022-11-07 12:27:00,5010,Man that looks good and love French fries fried in oil.Dessert looks pretty good to.
6695766,prov1800,2022-11-07 12:41:00,5010,Have some cooling down happening and have some ice forming here and there on the creeks.Them shacks will be out for you at Clarks in Dec.Ill have to prefish there just before you come up.
6695062,prov1800,2022-11-01 20:46:00,5010,Lots of sharpies in the cuts.they like open terrain.very spooky birds.Dont taste very good.We don't eat spruce grouse either.Red meat kinda tougher and taste like spruce needles.lol.ruffs are the best
6695370,prov1800,2022-11-04 15:56:00,5010,Another buck showed up at the bait.
6695372,That Minnesota guy,2022-11-04 16:18:00,8293,Hunting over bait is allowed up there eh?
6695374,prov1800,2022-11-04 16:23:00,5010,It sure is.
6695376,Eckohlt,2022-11-04 17:57:00,3685,You baiting those deer with left over fish carcasses??
6695380,prov1800,2022-11-04 18:14:00,5010,Deer don't care much for fish guts.I buy corn and oats and alfalfa bales.Unfortunatly no free bait for deer hunting.Baiting is the way my US hunters want to hunt.I still hunt ridges and trails but nice to get into a blind and turn on heater and strip down and enjoy the day when it gets cold.Just like ice fishing.lol.
6695382,Yellowfin123,2022-11-04 18:25:00,2182,"maybe one of these days i'll drop off a hog up there, be a nice break from fish and birds"
6695384,Eckohlt,2022-11-04 18:25:00,3685,"Well don't strip down to much when we're ice fishing,I don't want you scaring away all the big girls!haha"
6695386,prov1800,2022-11-04 18:32:00,5010,I'll keep it civil
6695388,prov1800,2022-11-04 18:36:00,5010,That's what I love about having seasons.Within a few months you get do all kinds of different hobbies.
6694956,prov1800,2022-11-01 07:26:00,5010,Weather has been beautifull and wish I had kept my boat out.Defiantly some beautifull days to have been out fishing.Have a couple more meals in the freezer of walleye/pike.Have been substituting some awesome ruffed grouse instead of fish.Great part of fall
6695004,Eckohlt,2022-11-01 12:11:00,3685,Something is always dying when you outside john!lol
6695008,southernEyes,2022-11-01 12:54:00,232,"Have you noticed a decrease in grouse populations? Here in the mountains of the mid-Atlantic, once plentiful ruffed grouse are near extinct. Same in the region of PA where I grew up hunting them 20 years ago. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6695014,prov1800,2022-11-01 14:15:00,5010,Grouse populations go up and down here depending on weather but it's still always a good hunt but this year we had a population explosion with grouse.Been fun this year as iam seeing 20-30 birds everything I go out.If I hunted with a dog like I did last year we would see a ton more.
6695016,prov1800,2022-11-01 14:17:00,5010,Good to be top predator
6695034,Bill Krejca,2022-11-01 16:49:00,6107,"Ya, top is good!!! Bill"
6695036,Eckohlt,2022-11-01 16:53:00,3685,"Beware of the top water predator,it can shake a hook into one's hand n draw serious blood!"
6695038,Timmer92,2022-11-01 16:56:00,451,Totally jealous!
6695054,prov1800,2022-11-01 19:57:00,5010,This guy showed up last night
6695058,johnboat,2022-11-01 20:15:00,2014,Grouse = best meat in the Bush!I fried me up a couple Spruce Grouse I brought home a few weeks ago. The flavor is Delicious! I love the tang of the Spruces.We brought home the limits of Ruffies and Spruce but no Sharp tails. We were hunting in the Red Lake area.Not many Sharptails there. What's it like where you're at?
