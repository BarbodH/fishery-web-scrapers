6695468,Slim03,2022-11-05 14:37:00,159,Bubba lithium lasted 3 days before having to change batteries. That was every day with shore lunch and cleaning fish in the evening with a group of 9.

6686198,Net_Man,2022-09-14 14:18:00,580,Rapala currently has 2 versions of a cordless lithium electric knife. Does any one have personal experience/review of the Rapala R12 lithium?
6686212,BCNeal,2022-09-14 16:32:00,19,"The new Rapala R12 is like the older Rapala version on steroids. It's faster, more powerful and batteries last longer. On a recent trip to Canada I cleaned over 50 walleyes for our group on one battery and it was still going strong."
6686246,Donscs,2022-09-15 03:00:00,379,"Clairebear thanks for the info regarding the American Angler knife. I have a different brand but I sent the info to my buddy who has 2 of them. The new knives already shipped and he couldn't believe how easy it was to get them replaced. Thanks Again,"
6686266,Snapper,2022-09-15 07:53:00,148,"Bought a Bubba Electric Fillet Knife when they first come out. Has four sets of blades with it. All of the blades are awesome. I mostly use the skinniest blade for walleyes under 18 inches and use the other blades for bigger walleye, salmon, and northern. Glad I bought when I did, they have sure went up on price, just like everything I guess."
6686292,valley366,2022-09-15 09:43:00,193,"I have the R12 Rapala and love it. Yes, like the old one but on steroids. Amazed at how fast the blades are and how great they cut."
6686440,bayman,2022-09-16 07:27:00,14,R-12 price is way more than Bubba
6686518,elway12,2022-09-16 11:37:00,335,Which Bubba cordless model are you guys using with success? The new Bubba model has a brushless motor but the older model one does not. The brushless one is about $100 more expensive and also includes a waterproof hard case. Thanks
6686534,walleyecheek,2022-09-16 12:42:00,2231,"I've got the ""0lder"" version Bubba, and its terribly Successful !!!"
6686550,jaleonard,2022-09-16 14:53:00,29,"Full disclosure: I work part-time at Cabela's (4 yrs, next month) after 12 yrs of retirement boredom at 58 yo. Try the BPS lithium. They are good too. They still have two models out. They are exactly the same but the one with the red case is $69.97, the black is $99.99. The red case was introduced for 2021 Black Friday. They are still available. I bought the black case some time before Black Friday. Anyway, I was amazed at the quality of the knife and the staying power of the battery. After the initial charge, I filleted 3 limits of crappie (75 and it was still going strong. I charged it... just because. Before, I had the American Angler electric, which I liked but it got too hot - this is what got me to try the BPS lithium. I've fished (crappie) at least one day for the past 4 weeks, and still haven't charged it. I like the shark blade best. It comes with 3 blades and there is another blade (8"" standard) that is available separately. I don't know how BPS' model compares to the others, as I haven't used them. Just offering another option. No matter the brand, I like the cordless convenience and cool handle."
6685890,kswalleyer,2022-09-12 17:59:00,1651,Bubba!
6685894,Clairebear,2022-09-12 18:42:00,937,Bubba hands down. Used a Rapala for years and it served me well. Bought the Bubba this summer that comes with 4 blades and spare battery. Watched some one else that had a plug in Bubba and his blade speed was twice mine but both cleaned walleye equally as well.American Angler is also a very good knife and anyone that has or uses one should check out this recall. A buddy of mine had two and was rewarded with two brand new replacement knives this summer.Check it out.https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Sc...eration-Hazard
6685948,prov1800,2022-09-13 06:38:00,5010,Iam more of a traditional knife guy.Proud of keeping it sharp.My wife got tired of me using the turkey carver to clean crappies so she bought my one.I rarely use it but it works okay.knife cleans up faster also and it will never let me down.for getting y bones out of pike and trout you can't beat a knife
6685950,Lmbkiller,2022-09-13 07:01:00,639,I'm with prov on this one and there's no reason to cut thru rib bones anyways. Dulls an electric knife just as well as a regular knife and adds extra work and meat loss
6685956,last chance,2022-09-13 07:24:00,3262,just get the bubba kit with 2 batteries and extra blades and you'll be set for yrs to come. with 2 batteries you should never run out of power. you can get a kit with 2 batteries and 4 different blades off eBay for just over 120.00.
6685966,prov1800,2022-09-13 07:52:00,5010,"Was giving a Chicago cutlery knife some 20 years ago and have it to this date.Blade is thinner but it has meaning to me.Its still like a razor blade.I carry it always in my fishing trips and on my hunting trips and has come in handy over the years not only cleaning fish but many other things, so hard to change it out for something that runs on a battery.Leaving for a moose hunt next week.My fillet knife will be coming along to clean some fish and hopefully it will be deboning some moose meat on the shoreline of Grace Lake."
6686040,gillmaster0,2022-09-13 13:33:00,24,"Bubba, but use Infisherman's standard blades (they fit) for best results and easiest of work."
6686064,walleyecheek,2022-09-13 15:48:00,2231,Do you mean Mister Twister original blades ? Never heard of Infisherman's blades !
6686072,Eckohlt,2022-09-13 15:59:00,3685,"Infisherman electric knife is discontinued,there afraid old Al's gonna cut his pinky off!"
6686074,walleyecheek,2022-09-13 16:07:00,2231,"Sorry never heard of a ""infisherman"" electric knife."
6685750,northerneyes,2022-09-12 09:50:00,72,Any recommendations for the best battery powered fillet knife for walleye and northerns
6685754,bigwalleye1,2022-09-12 10:12:00,2632,"I've never been an electric knife guy, and figured it was time. Bought a Rapala Ion and I've been pretty darned impressed with it, both with the knife itself as well as with the battery life. Takes a bit of getting used to, but I can do just as nice a jog on pike and walleye and crappies with it as I can with my manual Chicago Cutlery knifes. The only thing it won't do well is the cheeks."
6685760,valley366,2022-09-12 10:26:00,193,Recently replaced my Rapala battery powered knife with the new Rapala R12 Lithium Ion knife. Blades move a lot faster than the old one and the full electric model. Cut fish great. We only cut Perch and Walleye so cannot speak for Northern.Granted we did not fillet a ton of fish but one battery lasted all week. Think we filleted about 24 fish that week.One thing to note if upgrading from a Rapala I don't believe you can use the old blades in the new one. They go in properly but do not lock in place. Can pull them out without depressing the release button. I did not try to use the old after was able to pull them out.
6685766,last chance,2022-09-12 10:36:00,3262,the bubba is the best battery-powered fillet knife on the market as far as I'm concerned. it makes fast clean work on walleye. i have used many corded knives to clean walleye but none of them stood up to the bubba cordless.
6685768,proguidedream,2022-09-12 10:42:00,345,"my rapala works well. you wont run it out of batteries on a day or 2 of limits . if that many guys and fish, better have someone help you anyways. normally guys with electric will do the slabbing, other guys will finese the y bones out."
6685778,stukkie,2022-09-12 10:55:00,21,"Last Chance is 100% correct , we've tried others and they are no match as per handling/battery life as the bubba"
6685780,Ltrain,2022-09-12 10:57:00,4145,"Can't imagine anything being better than the Bubba. Picked one up this year and kicking myself for not doing it sooner. Had corded Rapala,Rapala heavy duty, and Mr Twister."
6685782,Husker525,2022-09-12 11:11:00,720,"I have been a manual knife guy my whole life. I was persuaded to switch to a Bubba cordless knife a month ago. Lifechanging! I should have switched years ago! It was so fast and easy! I am sure there are many good brands out there, but I went to the Bubba because that was my manual knife. I prefer the more flexible blades in the set, as that meets my fillet style more. I was even amazed that I could cut out cheeks with zero issues."
6685838,rjthehunter,2022-09-12 14:18:00,154,Bubba electric knife is the way to go. Look on Amazon. I picked one up there for $120 beginning of the open water season this year. No better option out there!
6685888,kettyspanky,2022-09-12 17:53:00,271,"Rapala ion is awesome. We have had at least one on each trip we go on. We did 134 perch on one battery on our trip this year before recharging. Walleye it does pretty amazing also. The cheeks are best done with a regular fillet knife. Whatever you pick, good luck and have fun."
