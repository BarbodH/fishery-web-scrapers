6696618,Wawajake,2022-11-14 17:21:00,413,I think I remember reading on Ontario Gov website that non residents ( besides the small fee to camp on crown land) are limited to 21 days at any crown land camp location within a calendar year.
6693520,Walleye2242,2022-10-23 19:50:00,263,I have had a truck bed camper set up for about 30 years now. I have never used it in canada though. use it for weekends and fly fishing adventures mostly. Weekend trips mostly. Was wondering how many camps would let me drive in and stay in my truck and just rent a boat and motor for time i was there? communication and times would be a must. If they had a shower house area i would be good to go without having to rent cabins. It was just a thought and dont know if i would do it or not but sure would be fun to be able to drive up and skip around from lake to lake without having to spend alot of money.

6693548,RichA$1970,2022-10-24 05:55:00,1159,You are in a great position as many drive ins offer camping with a shower house along with boat rentals. Ring mobile you don’t have to stay the whole week and I’m sure they’ll accommodate for $$$$
6693552,NETim1187,2022-10-24 07:21:00,166,Young's Bay at the Angle Inlet on LOTW immediately comes to mind.
6693560,Bill Krejca,2022-10-24 08:10:00,6107,"Quite a few allow camping. A good one, with which I am familiar, is O'Sullivan's Rainbow, on O'Sullivan Lake, a great walleye lake, in the wilderness, near Nakina. Bill"
6693608,proguidedream,2022-10-24 12:57:00,345,"what you might be interested in is Provincial campgrounds.. can google ontario or manitoba and it will give you a list. Many of them have ""resort"" type accomodations close by that will rent you boat. something like ""Sioux Narrows Provinvial Park Campground"" then look at the map, Crawfords camp or Totem Resorts both have boat rentals. if you just want to rock up to a resort that doesnt offer camping and sleep in the parking lot, i dont think they will be to keen on that."
6693702,tsabott,2022-10-25 09:24:00,12,"Buena Vista Resort in Morson, Ontario Lake of the Woods will have everything you need. Shower house, wifi, boat docking or rental, bait, restaurant, etc."
6693720,N_of_Quibell,2022-10-25 10:37:00,151,"For $9.35CDN a day (I think that's right) you can get a permit to camp on Crown Land. There are some restricted ""Green Zones"" around popular lakes, but that leaves a lot of available space. Of course, you would have to ""rough it"" without the bath house. To my mind, one of the major appeals of a truck camper is it allows one to trailer their own boat. But there's a lot to be said for a nice warm bathhouse on a cold rainy day...."
