6697602,Skywagon,2022-11-23 04:45:00,1106,"I recently tried to book a non-stop flight in and out of Denver from an airport in the US that used to provide that service, not available anymore. It is not just a Canada thing, there are airline problems everywhere since covid."
6698230,LoDo,2022-11-27 17:11:00,721,"Pre Covid, Winnipeg had dozens of non stop flights to and from US cities. ****, Winnipeg flew rd trip, direct 2x daily to Denver. AM and PM flights. All spring, summer and fall 2021 and 2022 Winnipeg had 1x daily flight with MSP. That was the only Winnipeg to US flight. Thats it. The flight landed late in the evenings and the flight from Winnipeg to MSP departed at 6a. Winnipeg airport was awful all of 2021 and 2022. Hopefully theres a change in 2023. Denver is the 3rd busiest passenger airport in the country, with record passengers 2022. Yes, Canada is far behind with all things opening post covid. Again, hopefully Canada will improve 2023."
6697088,krazyk711,2022-11-18 16:50:00,26,No it's the drama between guides and lodge owners...Seemed that covid created alot of tension amongst them.. it was actually interesting for awhile then I shut it down...
6697092,Eckohlt,2022-11-18 16:57:00,3685,Ok gotcha.
6697118,Camoclad,2022-11-19 05:29:00,628,Most of the group lives an hour north of Atlanta. We fished Coles lake with Pipestone Fly-In Outposts in June and then went to Vermilion Bay Lodge in late September. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6697224,billy bob,2022-11-19 17:23:00,13,3 favorite things 1) fishing again with my 3 daughters 2) fishing again with my 3 daughters 3) did I mention fishing again with my 3 daughters at Vermilion Bay Lodge 3 least favorite things There are none--had another memorable trip!!!
6697230,bthomas3333,2022-11-19 19:14:00,465,Guides...I have refrained from saying anything here because I can't be totally honest on the least favorite side. b-
6697268,DonnC,2022-11-20 09:36:00,15,"Outfitter/guide drama is common. I ran into it fishing reds and trout in Louisiana. And you are correct, it just has to be shut down."

6697376,wbgbesox,2022-11-21 12:57:00,85,"In full agreement with your comment regarding Jim's corner----------- 45 minute wait to report to Canadian customs that we were leaving the U.S - N/W angle area and then when someone answered she asked why we weren't using the landline phone instead of our cell phone and promptly hung up !! . So in order to comply we used the land line phone waited 55 minutes outside with bugs to be cleared to leave the U.S.Angle area, enter Canada and reenter the U.S at Warroad customs"
6697484,LoDo,2022-11-22 07:50:00,721,"1. I was able to get 30 days at camp this spring, summer and fall 2. caught my largest northern at 43"" with several over 40"" 3. took my dad to camp for the first time of hopefully many more trips 1. Winnipeg airport not open to international flights 2. Winnipeg airport not open to international flights 3. Winnipeg airport not open to international flights I have to think Winnipeg airport will contract with an airline like post covid days with several US cities to make travel easier. I feel bad for the ~1m folks that depend on Winnipeg airport for their international travel. What a waste of time and money for those folks to have to connect in Toronto or Calgary to travel to the US and abroad."
6697550,proguidedream,2022-11-22 13:56:00,345,WPG airport has Minneapolis to WPG and vice versa available right now. https://www.expedia.ca/lp/flights/ms...is-to-winnipeg and plenty of directs to other places like Mexico

6696890,RichA$1970,2022-11-17 06:38:00,1159,"1. Big Northerns making the drag squeal2. Almost getting bored catching Walleyes3. Just being in Pure Solitude and soaking it in-1. The 17 hour drive, mainly heading back-2. Some of the guys in the group who think they are auditioning for Top Chef & all the crap they bring including gear. -3. Stopping at crap restaurants vs something quick or packing some chow"
6696912,HeHooksHimself,2022-11-17 08:06:00,725,"Top 3: 1: The experience (as Monty Python would say ""And now, something completely different!) 2: The hunt 3: Big hungry spring lakers Bottom 3: 1: Trip home (reality bites) 2: Black flies (why I usually avoid mid June) 3: Covid restrictions (hopefully a thing of the past)"
6696916,Camoclad,2022-11-17 08:10:00,628,"3 Favorite: 1. The fishing after the COVID hiatus was fabulous, it was almost as if the fish hadn't seen a lure in almost 3 years! 2. For our 2 trips, the weather was near perfect for the respective weeks. 3. Now that TMG is in IFalls, he bailed us out when our luggage made it to IFalls when the passengers didn't! Also had a nice tour of the area while we were there too. 3 Least Favorite: 1. Delta has far less concern for our trips than we did! It really was terrible service, missed flights, and a lot of difficulties getting support for issues that they were responsible for. 2. Increasing costs of everything. Not a complaint, just not ideal that every single aspect of the trip has a 10-30% price increase. 3. Seeing some of the formerly successful/prosperous businesses still struggling or closed. Couple of honorable mentions: Favorite: The arrive CAN app made the border crossing really quick and efficient. I was a bit worried but it went well and seemed to expedite the process. Least: Having difficulty filling up the trips. It has become really difficult to find folks to commit to and follow through with the payments when that time comes."
6696996,Hook_settr,2022-11-18 03:40:00,127,"Positives- *Going with my dad, brother in law and nephew. Enjoyed making memories with family and it was great to share the experience of my 16 year old nephews first fishing trip. *Fishing out of my own rig. The camp boats we used were nice but using your own rig sure beats having to pack gear out of your boat at home and making due in Canada for a week. *Being back in my happy place after missing due to Covid restrictions. Negatives- *High water meant no docks at the lodge and having to launch/recover the boat each day. Not huge but still a pain. *Anxiety of having more hoops to get through due to Covid (vaccinations, paperwork, ArriveCan) but in the end was easy peasy. *Trying to pack all my brother in law and nephews gear. They looked like they were going for a month instead of a week! LOL"
6696998,btyreprich,2022-11-18 04:11:00,1067,Positives: 1. Preparing for the trip during which time I have a chance to remember past trips over the 40 plus years 2. The drive up to Canada gives our group to catch up with each other and share a few laughs 3. Fishing & the first shore lunch Negatives: 1. Packing to go home and the drive home knowing it'll be a long 12 months before we do this again 2. People who crowd you on a point when the lake is as large as Lac Seul 3. Seeing all the dead bugs on your truck when you get home

6697078,Eckohlt,2022-11-18 15:49:00,3685,What is camp politics??never heard of that.
6697086,walleyecheek,2022-11-18 16:28:00,2231,I think its where a bunch of people staying at a camp sit around a campfire drinking Labatts Blue bashing Trump & Biden !!!!!!!!
6696782,UKBDM,2022-11-16 06:50:00,178,"Most Favorite 1. Caught 2-39"" pike in a 12 hr span. PB for me but 40"" pike continue to elude me. 2. Put 1st time Canada fisherman on a PB pike 35.5"" tank of a fish. His smile and our celebration was memorable. 3. Renewed friendship with camp owners after 2 year COVID hiatus. Least Favorite 1. Walleye really scattered due to high water levels on our lake. Struggled to put together numbers of fish. 2. No Lake Trout caught by our group this year. Broke a 10 year streak not including COVID years. 3. Not having my BIL and his two sons in camp due to COVID vaccination status. Also missed my son who couldn't get off work."

6696812,stjoeguy,2022-11-16 12:12:00,979,"Favorites: Getting hewhocookstomuch back to St. Joe for the first time since 2019. It's always good to get the gang back together. Fishing with a neighbor who was giddy with excitement as he caught so many walleyes on his first Canada trip. Seeing the water higher than ever this spring compared to lower than ever last fall. Bringing a couple guys for their first trip that are really excited to go back again. Bear walking across the yard and finding a greasy paw print smeared on the glass door the next morning. A friendly squirrel on the porch at Root Bay. Getting my smallest northern ever, about 6.5"". Least favorite: The high water changed the fishing so that some go-to spots weren't as productive this year. I could add a half dozen more favorites but can't think of any other negatives, so it must have been a great year."
6696838,NM_Trout,2022-11-16 15:08:00,1094,Gotta love Northerns. Those things are born with a bad attitude.

6696622,phishfearme,2022-11-14 17:48:00,1242,favorites from this past summer: - when the pontoon plane takes off after dropping you off and it's quiet and you realize that you have the entire week in front of you - having Joe P (Freytown on WC) join us this year and he and I catching just shy of 100 nice walleyes between breakfast and lunch one day - meeting up on the lake with Corey and his group to exchange items mistakenly swapped from last year's trip with them - not so favorite: - we all got sick as dogs anywhere between 1 to 3 days - lost a number of days fishing (we think we passed covid around) - waiting for the plane to pick us up in brilliant sunshine and calm weather while Pickle Lake was fogged in. - having to rush to make it to the Thunder Bay airport and then getting stuck in Toronto due to cancelled flight. had to enter the US at the Toronto airport then returned to Canada to get a motel then reenter the US to get home - each costing many hours. the worst two travel days of my life - and I've traveled for a living. phish

Just being up there and enjoying the piece and quiet and the fishing. 3 things I disliked 1. The wind blew alot to make fishing some days challenging. 2. The packing up and getting ready to leave. 3. The year long wait until we get to go again.
6696674,Bill Krejca,2022-11-15 07:31:00,6107,"Plus: Spending time with my son and friends. The exhilaration of first day out on the water. The presence of the Canadian bush and all the creatures therein. My personal best 31"" walleye. Negative: Blowing a tire and fender on my trailer on I-35 near Mpls. As you can see, the positives outnumber the negative. Always has, always will. Bill"

Worst : 1) Saying goodby to my daughter at the airport when we were headed to two different home destinations.2) Seeing the thousands and thousands of acres of burned forest NW of Red Lake.3) The crazy long drive headed back. Red Lake to Grand Rapids drive is no fun when you are exhausted!"
