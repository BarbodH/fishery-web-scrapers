6696970,prov1800,2022-11-17 17:05:00,5010,Years ago.many years ago I never owned a ice fishing rod.Not sure if there were any.We picked up fresh willows on our way out on the ice.Had our spools of line ready with a hook and weight ready to go.almost like a Lindy rig.heck it was a lindy rig before it became a lindy rig.

6697156,Mark Pothen,2022-11-19 07:21:00,1325,I have multiple custom rods from Thorne brothers. Give them a call and ask for Lonnie or the rod shop. They can build whatever you want
6696834,Fournier,2022-11-16 13:58:00,3,"Good day all, and big thanks for admitting me to this awesome community. Been Googling a ton for past 2 years on recommendations for an ice rod (broke tip of my Shimano Convergence (36'' Medium) some time ago and spent last season with a Quantum line which is ok. Was hoping for some recommendations that aren't necessarily custom rods (getting those at the current CAD to USD exchange rate really hurts). Also while I'm at it, any thoughts on inline reels? just an fyi, up here Walleye sizes are legit between 32cm & 47cm (12 1/2'' & 18 1/2''), so not hunting for lunkers hence Medium (as there is always nice pike in the areas I fish) thanks all for any insight you can provide"
6696836,proguidedream,2022-11-16 14:43:00,345,"FENWICK elite tech , 32 or 36 M. easily the best production ice walleye rod ever made. (the old solid green ones are great) if your rip lipless crank baits, or go somewhere with bigger walleye alla lake winnipeg. the 36 MH will do wonders."
6696872,MikeinMN,2022-11-16 20:49:00,190,"I got a Frostbite Drench last year and have been really happy with it. Frostbite is a Canadian company, so no worries with the exchange rate. They have a VERY large selection of actions and lengths with a bunch of Youtube videos to help with selection. Just Google fish frostbite for their website. I'm also considering an inline ice fishing reel, but I'm a little concerned they're not sturdy enough for walleye fishing. I crappie fished with my BIL last winter and he uses one. Works excellent for that. They have the ability to quickly drop jigs back with one hand, and way more control than a spinning reel. The better ones seem pricey to me at around $100 USD. Hopefully someone else can add a little knowledge about using an inline for walleye."
6696886,adempsey2.0,2022-11-17 06:31:00,611,"All my ice rods are the older St.Croix rods without a reel seat. Still going strong. I am partial to St.Croix and will likely continue to purchase the majority of rods from them. I would certainly look at others that are popular like the Fenwick and Frostbite lines, as they are also quite popular. I am surprised you have been looking for two years. Never used an inline reel and do not know much about them. Would certainly be something I would be interested in trying out in the future though. A quick look I would be hesitant to buy any of the brands that I see manufacture them. Maybe I would look at the Pflueger line, but not sure about the others."
6696898,prov1800,2022-11-17 07:29:00,5010,"So I do quite a bit of ice fishing and basically any cheap rod combo will do the trick.I have some st Croix mojo rods which are very nice and really not to expensive.My favorite rod is a old Avid I had that I step on years ago and broke it above the reel seat.I made a 40"" ice rod out of that rod.It was a medium with x fast tip.I cut handle down and put oversized guides on it and it is the rod I use mostly.Has caught everything including very large muskies so its proven itself many times."
6696910,Fournier,2022-11-17 08:03:00,3,"Wow many thanks, those are my two rods for summer and LOVE the feel & action.."
6696918,Eckohlt,2022-11-17 08:17:00,3685,"I have ice fished with a number of guys from Ontario,there fav rod is a willow stick n ribbon tape,some days they beat me up on fish n some days I get them,I prefer a rod I can hold n reel them up."
6696924,Fournier,2022-11-17 09:25:00,3,"yeah definately need the reel seat in my case, finicky walters here I am as picky as they are in my gear selection hence the R&D time hahahaha..Thanks very much for the feedback les amis!"
6696958,prov1800,2022-11-17 15:31:00,5010,There's still people doing that.Still works.
6696968,Eckohlt,2022-11-17 16:57:00,3685,"I've seen it in action,seems like most things work in Ontario to catch fish."
