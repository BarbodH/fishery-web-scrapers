The Wabigoon and English Rivers comingle at Ball Lake which at least 50 river miles downstream from Ear Falls. Compared to the elevated Hg levels in the Wabigoon, the English River levels are ""at background"" levels where it enters Ball Lake. Regarding nuclear waste disposal in NWO - what could possibly go wrong?:https://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/en/mines-...ne-remediation Oh, I'm sure we know so much more now, and something like that will never happen again."
6694838,prov1800,2022-10-31 11:32:00,5010,I've not heard about the English River having mercury in it.Only river I've heard of is the Wabigoon River that was polluted with mercury by the paper mill in Dryden.Definatly a crime as that water ends up in Hudson Bay.There is acid rain everywhere in the world and has been for a very long time already and this is where the northern lakes get the pollution from.Iam sure everything we eat from veggies to beef is polluted with some kind of affects
6694910,N_of_Quibell,2022-10-31 19:29:00,151,"The English River receives some Hg pollution downstream from where the Wabigoon enters it, but that is way, way downstream from both Dryden and Ear Falls. An excellent article on the subject is:https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10...cets-2021-0093 Something particularly interesting from this article is that the evidence suggests the old site in Dryden is no longer the primary source of ongoing pollution, but rather contaminated soil particles on Wabigoon flood plain on the way down to Clay Lake. This finding will make any remediation efforts very challenging."
6694918,prov1800,2022-10-31 20:59:00,5010,Then it all goes into the Winnipeg river and into Lake Winnipeg and into Hudson Bay.Can you imagine a accident at the proposed nuclear waste site just east of Dinorwic.
6694976,N_of_Quibell,2022-11-01 09:09:00,151,"Unfortunately, I can imagine it. I grew up downwind of the 3 Mile Island Nuclear Plant in PA. At the time, we were notified of the possibility that we, including our 95 year old Grandfather, would need to be relocated if they couldn't get the melt-down under control. Personally, I think it's criminal that such an idea is even considered for such a pristine gem as NWO. Stock up now:https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/healt...px?newsid=1586"

6695082,Skywagon,2022-11-02 05:46:00,1106,"The Nuclear Waste Management Organization is billing the proposed high-level nuclear waste dump site as a tourist attraction, they have even told people they will build what they call a ""Center of Excellence"" a place for people to come and see the marvels of a nuclear waste dump. I am sure people from all over the world will want to come to northwest Ontario to visit such an attraction. Here is what was in vogue in Dryden for Halloween this year."
6696840,stumcfar,2022-11-16 15:44:00,451,"I haven't fished the river much, but when we have, we had pretty good luck with plastics and on Lac Seul around Ear Falls, I can't get a fish to bite the same plastic??? Strange!"

6691702,AsianAngler,2022-10-13 10:20:00,67,"Seeing this thread reminded me of the horrible mercury pollution of the English River that came to light in the 70s. Poked around in the internet and apparently there are still high levels of mercury some 50 plus years later. Not only that, but mercury contamination of fish is rising in fish throughout Ontario and some experts believe that they will continue to increase due to logging and climate change. While many fishermen continue to be skeptical about the risk, Ontario maintains a website that shows the level of contamination and the health risks due to eating fish. I found this article written by a tournament fisherman affected by mercury poisoning particularly interesting. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thund...hted-1.5904772 This makes me very sad. We own a Canadian cabin and still fish and eat our catch, though rarely more than once a week. In fact, in our 20s, we loved camping and fishing in the English River, but haven't done that for many years. First Nations people are still suffering the affects of the pollution in the 70s and the government has not followed through with their promises to clean up pollution. We must continue efforts to protect the water and lands that we all love."
6691742,Wawajake,2022-10-13 13:12:00,413,"I don't see anywhere in the article that logging and or climate change is causing mercury levels in lakes. Now there was Paper Mills on the north shore of Lake Superior ( eg Terrace Bay) and they have a history of causes of mercury in water outputs and air pollution, but the paper mills left in Ontario are few and those left have far improved safer processes. Other inland lakes for decades have been effected by southern source winds from USA and Canadian factories around Lake Erie and Lake Ontario causing toxic acid rain to both countries . Fortunately we have improved that dramatically with scrubbers and processes that don't use mercury. Interestingly this fellow from the Sault must of been eating a lot of his very big fish caught as seen from his facebook page, yet he is helping fight the MNR from changing regs to not being able to keep one walleye over typical keep slot size. .......Anyway it is common practice by us Ontario locals to eat the small and medium ones and catch and release the big old ones . Exactly what the Environment study map quoted reccomends."
6691744,Wawajake,2022-10-13 13:25:00,413,Oh forgot one more source of mercury is coal fired electricity plants......Ontario has closed most if not all of them. So perhaps in next decade even the big fish will be excellent fare.
6691846,Bill Krejca,2022-10-14 06:30:00,6107,"Am familiar with the pulp mill pollution, but not with the electric plants' pollution - what process do they use which dumps the mercury into the water? Bill"
6691876,Wawajake,2022-10-14 09:01:00,413,I get the impression the primary source of heavy metals from coal plants is thru air pollution / acid rain.
6692432,AsianAngler,2022-10-17 08:15:00,67,"Sorry, you may have missed in my earlier post that I was poking around the internet regarding mercury. It was not in the article that I posted the link for. Apparently, logging activity releases mercury that is trapped in the soils. As for rising temperatures, studies have shown that fish sometimes are forced to change their prey and are often more active which leads to consuming more fish, and in turn, more mercury."
6692560,N_of_Quibell,2022-10-17 12:14:00,151,"I may be mistaken, but I believe you are confusing the English River with the Wabigoon River. The Wabigoon downstream from Dryden suffered some of the most worst Hg pollution on record anywhere. The Hg was the product of a chlor-alkali plant, which was part of the pulp mill production in Dryden. Clay Lake sediments continue to have high Hg levels, and it presents a particular problem to the First Nations who depended on the Wabigoon fisheries. I'm not saying the English River is pristine mercury-wise, but as far as I know it is nowhere near as bad as the Wabigoon was. The good news is the Hg levels in the Wabigoon drainage appear to be falling, the bad news is its still high"
6693536,AsianAngler,2022-10-24 01:30:00,67,It is both rivers and sometimes it is called the Grassy Narrows poisoning.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mercu...m-fight-hanafi
6694786,Skywagon,2022-10-31 06:33:00,1106,"To give some clarity, the mercury was released from the Dryden pulp mill into the Wabigoon River which eventually flows into and co-mingles with the English river. The people of the Grassy Narrows Indian Reserve (which is probably 50 miles downstream of Dryden) are still suffering from the consequences of mercury poisoning.Back in the day when the mercury was released into the water from the Dryden pulp mill it was probably not really known what the consequences to people in the area would be, they thought it was safe. Over 50 years later we know better. Now there is similar situation, the Nuclear Waste Management Organization is proposing a high-level nuclear waste dump at the head waters of the Wabigoon and Rainy River, they say it will be safe, that it will be many years before the containers they bury underground will eventually leak. This proposed project is experimental, it has never successfully been done before in the world, another similar project failed, they are currently spending billions of dollars trying to clean it up. This is just what one of the most pristine areas in the world needs, the risk of a radioactive release in our water system that could affect major fisheries, including Lac Seul and Lake of the Woods."
6694794,Larry S,2022-10-31 07:26:00,665,Its INSANE to have a Nuclear Waste Dump ANYWHERE in Ontario. In Nevada We have been Fighting for Years to keep a Waste Depository from our State There are So many Scenarios where many things can go wrong Destroying the Land and Fisheries. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN!!!!
6690834,SteveZ,2022-10-10 07:55:00,271,"Spent a week in Ear Falls fishing the English River. The bite was crazy good to say the least. Water temp 54, good flow out of the dam, and the walleyes were stacked on rock piles and current seams. Pitching 1/4 to 3/8 oz jigs with B Fish N Moxi's and Pulse R's in purple/chartruese, and blue/white were the go to baits. Smallies were on the chew as well. It was a wonderful trip and I can't wait to go back in the spring."

6691282,SteveZ,2022-10-12 05:40:00,271,From the dam and down stream about 6 miles.
6691288,Eckohlt,2022-10-12 06:15:00,3685,Steve did you fish where the rivers meet to go to camping lake? And if so how was the fishing down that far??
6691360,SteveZ,2022-10-12 09:50:00,271,We did not go that far but a buddy was at MK Camp a couple of weeks before and said the fishing was crazy good in that area.
6691548,Eckohlt,2022-10-12 19:12:00,3685,Where is MK camp??is that the full name of the camp?MK
6691622,SteveZ,2022-10-13 06:58:00,271,MK Camp which is no longer a camp is on the east shore where the Chickuni meets the English at the entrance to Camping Lake.
