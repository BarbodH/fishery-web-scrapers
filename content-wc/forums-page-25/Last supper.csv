6697326,prov1800,2022-11-20 20:09:00,5010,Glad I was able to get a pic of that.That grouse was running around strutting most of the morning as there were 3 females there.Woodpecker just happened to land close to him.Likely not going to see that to soon again.My new cell phone defiantly takes good pics as this was 40+ plus yard out.
6697350,RichA$1970,2022-11-21 09:49:00,1159,The woodpeckers definitely can fill the void during a quiet time. I had a couple of does I watched eating greens off a fallen tree and an opossum walked right under my stand…he sounded just like a buck so it’s funny how animals can fill the quiet woods with sounds.
