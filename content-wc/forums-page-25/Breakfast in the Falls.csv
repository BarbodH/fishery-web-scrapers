6696826,nitroman,2022-11-16 13:43:00,368,T Patton Cafe in Orr is the best bet for a good ol fashion stick to ya ribs kinda breakfast. Mcdonalds in the falls but that place is crazy busy on travel days and to me it seems poorly run with slow piss poor service. La Place de rendezvous on the Canada side is a good option as well.

6696278,bigwalleye1,2022-11-11 19:08:00,2632,"With a return to Canada several times last summer, I was beyond disappointed with the options in the Falls. Shorelunch is long Gomes's, Patty's is closed due to retirement, Voyageurs was locked up tight both times through with no sign of life. What's left for a decent sit down breakfast with or even without decent parking?"
6696286,That Minnesota guy,2022-11-11 19:47:00,8293,Great news! All the places you mentioned that are closed are for sale. Bring your checkbook and staff and you can be a business owner in beautiful I-Falls. Chocolate Moose is your best option.

6696326,RichA$1970,2022-11-12 07:53:00,1159,I’m glad I don’t need much of a breakfast Diet Coke is enough for me as we stopped at the Chocolate Moose and my friend’s breakfast was like $15. I’d rather put the pedal to the metal and get to the lake vs a sit down breakfast
6696366,eyecatcher1,2022-11-12 15:14:00,323,We usually stop at the Village Inn in Virginia. Good food and plenty of parking.
6696468,Joek3,2022-11-13 08:23:00,244,"I'm with you RichA. Cup of coffee, breakfast bar or banana, nature calls and let's roll to the launch."
6696488,David Anderson,2022-11-13 10:55:00,2073,"If you are driving up 53 stop at T Pattenn Cafe in Orr, on the left side. Great old style breakfast"
