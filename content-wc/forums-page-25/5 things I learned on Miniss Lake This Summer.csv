6698508,gordy28,2022-11-29 14:16:00,437,Thanks all - glad everyone enjoyed it Its a long winter for some and time between trips is about as slow as Christmas Eve to Christmas morning for a 6 year old lol Andrew

Life has been busy but sitting squarely in the shoulder season I finally go around to oneEach trip I take I try to get up early, have a coffee and jot down notes about the previous day. Some of its useless ramblings (a lot of it) but on our recent trip I managed to capture a few key insights I thought I would share https://www.northernjacks.com/post/5...on-miniss-lakeCheersAndrew"
6697928,Fishquest,2022-11-25 20:39:00,89,"Thanks Andrew another fine read, we gave up and fish counts and anything that could cause stress or pressure along time ago and now use the trip as a holiday to relax and the fish are a bonus. Pre trip work sure helps narrow down some possi le hot spots and always a starting point and jigs are it that's all you need in the north to put fillets in the pan."
6697948,Bill Krejca,2022-11-26 05:50:00,6107,"Nice report, liked the sharing of just enjoying being there and the surroundings! Bill"
6697964,gordy28,2022-11-26 06:30:00,437,Thanks Mike and Bill. Glad you enjoyed. It’s taken me quite a few trips but trying to soak it all in is important I think. The week goes fast and it’s easy to race through it and miss outAndrew
6697966,HeHooksHimself,2022-11-26 06:38:00,725,"Nice read Andrew. The thing that resonates for me is ""enjoying the moment."" A week in the Canadian wilderness is special and if we never caught a fish, it would still be worth the effort. Like I say to people that ask me about our Canadian fishing adventures, ""There is a lot more to Canadian fishing than the fish!"" Keep it coming! Fish On! Hooks"
6698012,N_of_Quibell,2022-11-26 09:02:00,151,"Nice. It reminds me I need to work on my jigging technique. I can identify with ""Breathe in the Air"" - better than meds!"
6698270,That Minnesota guy,2022-11-28 08:24:00,8293,Does Borger still have his web site? I haven't checked in a while and now can't remember what it was.
6698286,maddogg,2022-11-28 10:19:00,178,One of the best lakes we've fished. We fished it for many years. Left me with some of the best memories of fishing and comradery I ever had.
