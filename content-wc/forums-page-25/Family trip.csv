Wife and 3 kids will be coming this time so fast action is important as 2 of the kids need to get a bit energized with some good numbers. Wife and I have fished Gull Rock and some smaller lakes before. May end up back there again as the fishing and camp we stay at are fantastic. But a shorter drive and possible crappie/perch/smallmouth action is appealing as well. Was thinking Eagle or Cedar lake or anything in that area might be worth checking out. We are not pros, considering a guide for a few days as well. Thanks in advance."

They also have a restaurant if you want to take a night off from cooking. You can fish for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, perch, musky and lake trout."
6695926,prov1800,2022-11-08 15:10:00,5010,Check out Northern Lights Resort on Cedar Lake.Has very good crappie fishing as well as the other species to.Very good 1800 ft Kodiak boats with 50 4 strokes and all the free bait you want.

6695978,Camoclad,2022-11-09 06:57:00,628,"BankerFish and ProV1800 are both correct, both places are really nice. I would reach out to Prov1800 privately and see if he could guide you. He worked his butt off for us and was a lot of fun to fish with. Another consideration would be to contact Clark's and see about a fly-in trip to Zizania for a day. The flight is really short, maybe 12-15 minutes. It is incredible fishing and would be an awesome day for kids."
6695980,prov1800,2022-11-09 07:05:00,5010,Was going to mention The day trip to Zizania.Thx for mentioning it.That defiantly would be a trip not soon forgotten.VB Lodge would be a great place to stay also except no crappies on Eagle but I do day trips if arranged early enough.
