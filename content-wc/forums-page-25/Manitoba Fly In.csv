6696676,bthomas3333,2022-11-15 07:31:00,465,I can't speak to all the lodges there. I can only speak to why I chose one. I chose GRL for easy access to the Brook Trout without doing a fly out. So I would look at locations and then research from there.Brett

6695044,pete kraft,2022-11-01 17:21:00,28,"It's not in Manitoba, but there are a few places on Cree with American plan and I believe one where it's a small camp, but you're on your own, Pike fishing is world class and if you can make a September trip, the Trout fishing is excellent. The lake is hard to get to, we had a direct flight from Saskatoon on a single prop that landed at Crystal's airstrip, but I don't know if that's available anymore."
6695118,spoonchucker,2022-11-02 10:40:00,82,"I fished Aikens many years ago and facilities were excellent as was the walleye fishing but pike were hard to come by. Maybe that has changed but I would check Master Angler to see if many large pike come out of the lake you do eventually choose.I do think Brett is right- where you are flying from would be helpful to suggest the right places and I admit my group loves Cree and we are pike hunters first. Never been to Cree lake lodge which is full service though but have heard good things about it, we do unguided housekeeping. These all came from Cree. Toronto to Edmonton or Calgary to Ft McMurray and then float plane."
6695126,trapsht,2022-11-02 12:38:00,28,"Spoonchucker....those are absolute giants!!Im coming from Chicago area. Direct flight to Winnipeg. Some lodges fly you from there, and others require another flight. I'd be open to an outpost, but most require more than 2 people. Right now I'm leaning towards Dunlops because I can go unguided. Ive never been on a guided trip, and Im not sure how I would do with someone all week that I dont know in a boat. The obvious downside to Dunlops is that I have to fly to Thompson, which is another expense.Im attempting to speak with all of these places on the phone to get more info. Luckily, they all have openings in July."
6695130,bthomas3333,2022-11-02 13:32:00,465,"I also fished Cree Lake last season from June 13-20. I fished from Broken Arrow Lodge. It is a pure outpost and the price reflects the outpost nature of the place. I also posted a trip report here on Walleye Central. Couple things about Cree. 1. Obviously you need to get to Fort Mac. The cost of travel will reflect that cost. 2. It is a HUGE lake and from Broken Arrow a lot of the very best pike fishing is a ride. Not crazy but 20-75 mins. 3. Because it is a huge lake a ton of places look good. I spent all of Covid downtime organizing a plan to fish it. Not that big a deal and I would be happy to share spots with you, but it is not an easy place to fish. 4. Broken Arrow has first class equipment and really nice cabins. The owner Brian Garrett is first class as well. If you are considering Dunlops I would consider Broken Arrow as well. To get to Dunlops from Winnipeg is a LONG 9 hr drive or a second pricey flight to Thompson which is the jumping off point for DL. If I am taking two flights one could easily be the 2nd flight to Fort Mac. Here are some of our Cree fish from June. As you will see the fish in Cree are built really well! Brett"
6695186,DeBo,2022-11-03 08:25:00,211,Does Kasba Lake have good big pike? I mean obviously it’s probably pretty good but I don’t know if it’s top tier or if that is more of a Laker spot. I believe they are a direct flight from Winnipeg when I was looking a few years back. Might be another place worth a look.
6695200,proguidedream,2022-11-03 10:22:00,345,looks a bit ruff lol
6695246,Carljlf,2022-11-03 15:38:00,1,"If you are looking for an unguided trip, try Cobham River Lodge. They have flights directly from Winnipeg and you can use a guide or not. Excellent boats with flat casting deck and fish finders with waypoints already installed. The lakes are very easy to navigate with many large weed beds. The lodge is a little ruff but the food is excellent and the staff is very helpful I have fished there and going Bach this summer."
6695448,JWN1,2022-11-05 11:12:00,6,Ganglers have several outposts that are worth looking at.
6695778,Spurgery,2022-11-07 13:38:00,79,I see there are several lodges on God’s Lake/River. Anyone have insight or preference to which one they would choose and why?
6694120,trapsht,2022-10-27 11:21:00,28,"I'm going to try something new this year, and go on a fly in trip with my son to Manitoba. We fish year round, and have spent many trips in Ontario. We are looking for trophy pike. Any first hand knowledge of lodges would be most helpful. -4 or 5 day Guided American plan.-Doesnt need to be fancy(but most seem to be)-Budget is $4500 pp-Fly from Winnipeg(trying to avoid 3 flights)-On my list so far are: Dunlops, Minor Bay lodge, Silsby lodge,misaw lake lodge.Would love to hear any prior experiences with these outfits, or any other suggestions."
6694136,Eckohlt,2022-10-27 11:56:00,3685,Bthomas3333 is the northern guru he's the guy u need to talk to!
6694352,CincyPike,2022-10-28 07:09:00,9,I would highly recommend Dunlops for trophy pike.
6694360,bthomas3333,2022-10-28 07:39:00,465,"I have fished Dunlops twice. Very professional quality trip. Lots of fish and easy walleye's for a break. I've marked up maps for other guys so I could send you what I have done for other guys. I'd also be happy to share what lures worked. I've also posted two trip reports to this site. Another idea you didn't mention that is worth looking at is God's River Lodge. I recently enjoyed a late season trip with a target of Lakers but the pike bays we fished a few different sessions were first class. I saw three massive cabbage beds that I am sure would hold good pike earlier in the season. They also have a day flyout lake that is rumored to turn out INSANE numbers of big 40+ inch pike. Like 20-40 per day per boat. (Those are insane numbers that are only touched by Alaska when it comes to pike. More than excited to give that lake a shot someday. It's called Semmons Lake and supposedly is really only great first few weeks of the season) TBH with that budget for 4-5 days you can fish a lot of the very top spots. If it is purely the number of flights why not consider Northwest Territories or Saskatchewan? Both Yellowknife and Saskatoon are reached from Vancouver or Toronto. Those city are reachable from most US cities directly. Those two parts of the country are another level especially if you are targeting pike. Places like Taltson Bay / Trout Rock / Cree Lake / Cree River / Milton Lake are all super if you open up the search a bit, plus places I am excited to try like Marshland fishing outfitters and Lakers unlimited. If you have questions or want to hear more about one of the places I have fished let me know. I'd be happy to chat. Brett"
6694364,OldFootdoc,2022-10-28 07:47:00,393,"A second vote for you to consider God's River Lodge... My son and I are forunate to have fished that lake through that lodge 4 or 5 times, just as ice is out. The fishing on God's Lake is phenominal and you can catch large numbers of 5-8 and up to 10 pound walleyes and large pike consistently. Large pike is vague with our largest at 48"" and there is usually one of those per trip on God's lake for us. Others in the camp have had equal success. If you can go to God's and take a day trip in the early spring to Semmons, you will find 50"" pike. One morning, my son had 7 pike over 45"" fishing the tributaries on Semmons. This is a good camp with good accomodations and food and very helpful guides. Also, in the evening, the camp is positioned at the head waters of God's river and shore fishing just a few feet from you cabin is enjoyable and productive."

6694980,trapsht,2022-11-01 09:24:00,28,Thanks for taking the time to help with my decision. A lot of good info here. For those that have stayed at Gods River Lodge...how was the lodging situation? Website states there are a few main lodges with bedrooms inside. Doesn't sound like there would be much privacy.Im going to save NWT lodges when my son is a bit older.
6694990,bthomas3333,2022-11-01 10:19:00,465,The main lodge bedrooms are not usually used for fishing guests. The lodge built 2 new tri-plexs in ~2018/2019 that have 1 bedroom 1 bath on the ends and 2 bedrooms 1 baths in the middle. The tri.s are really fine from a privacy perspective of course I was there when I was the last guest of the season in late Sept. Ill post a couple of pictures. If the site will allow. If not Ill try to send a private message here.

6694994,proguidedream,2022-11-01 10:28:00,345,Aikens Lake would be my choice with that budget. it is a short drive to float plane base from WPG and trully 5 star service. time of year may come into play for best pike fishing
