6694784,Walleye2242,2022-10-31 06:31:00,263,I would do the exact same but stay at the bayview at eat at the harborauge right across the lot. tackle shop right next door as well. Great rooms and the restaraunt has much better food at a much better prices. get the border out of the way....wake up in canada. no worries about long morning lines and such. so much better.
6694974,WCoyote,2022-11-01 08:37:00,200,"Meat Lovers Pizza, Border Bar - fantastic"
6694184,7 Mag,2022-10-27 14:15:00,1887,The lake is beautiful and I enjoy the drive on Hwy 11 in particular watching the trains cross the lake.
6694220,prov1800,2022-10-27 17:10:00,5010,Was there alcohol involved in that bill.lol.Have ate there but never came anywhere near that kind of money.
6694278,x4flatfish,2022-10-27 20:31:00,319,"Stayed at the Cobblestone twice this summer. Very nice new motel. Very good bar food. They just opened the restaurant/ bar a couple weeks before my second trip in September. Indoor pool etc. Good parking. Fuel next door including non oxy. Nice to pull in park, and not have to leave again to eat or have a cocktail. Yes it is a bit more expensive but as I have gotten older I prefer the convenience...."
6694296,RichA$1970,2022-10-28 00:35:00,1159,Watch out for the Chocolate Moose if you have more than a 3 hour drive as in June poor Fred in our group blew a sphincter valve and it was more of a Chocolate Douche that knocked out a pair of Lee Riders on the way to Red Lake.
6694298,Eckohlt,2022-10-28 04:06:00,3685,"Getting near Christmas,a nice gift from you rich to Fred would be a crap load of depends."
6694574,WCoyote,2022-10-29 09:22:00,200,"Falls motel certainly isn't 5*, but it is clean. No problem with boat parking. Owners are friendly. Husband is a guide if want to schedule an evening outing. Falls motel has worked for me for over 2 decades, every year.The great breakfast spots have taken a hit in recent years in IFalls. The Falls coffee landing downtown is pretty good and have terrific scones.Through Ft Francis on 11 there is very good breakfast spot on the east edge town. Where road heads north, west side of road, lake is on the east side."
6694576,WCoyote,2022-10-29 09:27:00,200,STUFF HAPPENS -eh Fred!
6694586,villagespinweave,2022-10-29 10:11:00,3,"Highly recommend The Library for breakfast. Wife and I spend our summers on Rainy and visit it often. ""Second Edition"" + a side of hash browns and coffee... good coffee. Dawn and her partner used to run a coffee shop inside the Super One just east of them. Friendly, pretty quick service, as reasonably priced as they can be in this climate. Did I say good coffee?"
6694660,Joek3,2022-10-30 07:31:00,244,Been doing the same thing for 8 years. Hilltop motel then Border bar for pizza and beer. Hilltop rooms have been clean and $100. ($50 a guy). Seems all the new places are much more expensive. They have Starbucks coffee in room and cereal/fruit in office. We are not big breakfast guys. This works great for us.
6694664,btyreprich,2022-10-30 07:51:00,1067,Hilltop for us as well - smaller parking lot to be sure but we have always been able to find a spot not that far from our room which we like. We haven't found a pizza spot in IF that is to our liking. LOVED the Mexican restaurant but now it has changed over to The Library so we will have to give this spot a try.
6694080,Camoclad,2022-10-27 10:20:00,628,"This summer we at breakfast at the Moose and a coffee shop downtown near the border crossing, I think it was Coffee Landing Cafe or something such as that. Both places were a great sit down breakfast."
6694092,Camoclad,2022-10-27 10:30:00,628,"Our group has flown into I-Falls several times. Havent stayed at the cobblestone yet (it is new). We stayed at the Days Inn this summer and for the price it was great. The place was clean, easy to get to, plenty of parking, walk across the parking lot to the chocolate moose for breakfast lunch or supper. In the past we have stayed at the Hilltop Lodge (formerly hilltop motel). They changed owners and with all the covid cancellations and such for our trip (3 years of planing, cancel, re-plan, cancel, ha!) we ended up using some reward points to stay at Days Inn but not because of a poor experience with the Hilltop. I would stay either place again for sure. My brother and his family decided to cross and stay in Ft. Francis and that worked out fine for them. I believe they stayed at the bay view motel."
6694096,7 Mag,2022-10-27 10:39:00,1887,"I look forward to having breakfast at the Chocolate Moose, great service and the food is good. I haven't stayed at the Coblestone but there is plenty of parking."
6694118,Wickguy1,2022-10-27 11:15:00,14,Sounds like that might be place to look for rooms. Like the idea of a good restaurant close by. Appreciate everyone's input
6694152,prov1800,2022-10-27 13:14:00,5010,Could cross border and get a room at the place de rendezvous.Has a restaurant and great veiw of Rainy lake if you can get a room and balcony on that side of hotel.Been there few times.Very nice.
6694154,Walleye2242,2022-10-27 13:27:00,263,2 of use ate at the rendevous in august. Food was fine. however the 100.00 bill was crazy for what we got. 2 people. short staffed so i think we were there for over 2 hours for dinner. The harborage by bayview is way better and prices much more affordable. just 1 human's opinion. in reality...cant go wrong at either place.
6694160,7 Mag,2022-10-27 13:39:00,1887,"Availability might be a challenge, a lot of the motels are rebooked by repeats such as myself, I rebook for the next year when i check out. Goodluck!"
6694166,Wickguy1,2022-10-27 13:48:00,14,That is why i am getting on it now. It shows availability at Cobblestone. Being a Thursday might help some I hope
6694178,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-27 14:12:00,8293,"Days Inn started doing some remodeling they are near the Chocolate Moose like Jason said. Falls Motel has a loyal following with outside entrances to the rooms. Some like that. Jason mentioned Hilltop, they also are outside entrance and you might not like the parking. The Holiday gas station sits on the site where a motel burned down before Covid. Voyageur Motel might have parking issues for you. Going West on 11 you have the Nomad. West on 11 is the River View. (Old Americ Inn.) West on 11. New Americ Inn. Food options....... Chocolate Moose McDonalds Voyager Restaurant Dunkin Donuts Coffee Landing Sammy's Pizza Border Bar The Library (The old Mexican place by Super One Grocery) Hardee's Other than that you head East on 11 to the resorts on Rainy."
6694182,Wickguy1,2022-10-27 14:14:00,14,Appreciate it. Will have some beers with the boys and see what they want to do.
6693998,Wickguy1,2022-10-27 07:53:00,14,Headed to a different lake in Canada next June with a group and I am looking into lodging. I am guessing there are a few in the group that overnight in Int Falls. I am looking for advice on hotels in the area. We might have a group member flying into Int Falls airport so I would like to stay close to that if possible. I see there is a new Cobblestone close to the airport with a restaurant possibly. Has anyone stayed there and is there ample parking for three trucks with boats. If not let me know what you recommend. I would like to get reservations as soon as I can. We will be staying on a Thursday night to break up the trip from NE Iowa. Thanks all. I appreciate it.
6694000,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-27 08:00:00,8293,The Cobblestone just opened this year and is what you would expect of a new motel. It is the closest Motel to the airport. There also is a brand new Americ Inn that opened. That is further away.
6694004,Wickguy1,2022-10-27 08:03:00,14,How is truck/trailer parking at either location? I appreciate your response
6694012,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-27 08:14:00,8293,"Plenty of parking, tarred lots, good lighting. If you want pictures of the parking let me know."
6694014,Wickguy1,2022-10-27 08:16:00,14,I'll take your word on it. Lighting is a great point too. I appreciate the response. I will reach out with any further questions.
6694032,Walleye2242,2022-10-27 08:38:00,263,the new americ-inn is really nice. very nice. farther away from airport but I-falls is not big. There are many options for places to stay in I-falls. The new americ-inn is the nicest by far but all the others will do. As i have stayed in I-falls and then crossed in the morning for many years it is much nicer to cross and then stay in fort francis. i did that this past year 3 times and i loved it. No stress and issues in the morning. You wake up...your already in canada. The bayview is a great option in fort francis with a great resteraunt and tackle shop a parking lot away. I will never stay in I-falls again probably.
6694034,Wickguy1,2022-10-27 08:41:00,14,I will look into that too. Very good point. Thanks for the info. I saw the Cobblestone and my dad is a sucker for a hot tub after a long day traveling lol.
6694036,prov1800,2022-10-27 08:42:00,5010,Airport just isn't very far anywhere from town.
6694070,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-27 10:00:00,8293,"Correct, the Cobblestone will give them the closest access to gas and another restaurant (Chocolate Moose) although there are a couple of others also."
6694074,bigwalleye1,2022-10-27 10:12:00,2632,Can you offer specific names? My two trips through the falls found it to be a veritable breakfast wasteland
