However Central will have other guests and not by yourselves, but good fishery. We went with Amik last summer to Cobham Morley outpost. Very good outfitter and all their lake outposts are good. Shearstone is a true outpost and you would be on your own, with no other camps. My brothers and I are returning to Amik in 23 late July to Vee Lake."
