6693888,bthomas3333,2022-10-26 12:57:00,465,I would guess/bet that we will see more flights added to Canada in the next 6 months. I mean it is a risk to not book now but I would guess the situation for next summer will be better if we chill for a couple of months. Brett
6694408,NM_Trout,2022-10-28 10:40:00,1094,Just don't stay at the Staybridge Suites in Grand Forks. We had a horrible stay this past year. Beds were made up by hotel staff and when turned down we found dirty sheets and blood on a pillow. Only thing missing from the room was crime scene tape. Management's response was a display of apathy.
6694498,LoDo,2022-10-28 19:42:00,721,"We used to fly Denver direct to Winnipeg and drive 5 hrs to Red Lake. Pretty easy and the flight times were beautiful. Door to door to camp / home same day both ways = no motels. Couldnt ask for better itinerary. Today, flights are awful. Flying to MSP, layover, fly to Winnipeg, hotel, drive, etc... not great! Fly to MSP, layover, fly to non dependable Int Falls, drive... meh... not great. Fly to MSP and drive..... F that too! I agree with a previous poster, Winnipeg has to loosen things up. Imagine the 1m Canadians that depend on Winnipeg airport to travel to US. Those folks have to fly to Calgary or Toronto before flying to US destination. F that!! Time and cost sucks. Winnipeg is by far the biggest issue. Not being able to fly direct to Winnipeg is hurting. Pre Covid Winnipeg had flights coming in / out from dozens of US cities. I have to think this changes in next 6 months. Fingers crossed."

6694536,Eckohlt,2022-10-29 05:19:00,3685,"I'm pretty sure they'll get right on that idea,Christmas is coming up,one of those rich guys may even get a jet for Xmas,hel with a prop plane."
6694548,prov1800,2022-10-29 07:15:00,5010,Drydens airport had commercial jets coming in and out.Was very handy having it in operation and took a few flights out of there.Those flights get expensive.But for people that can afford it defiantly handy.Kenora still has a airport as does Sioux lookout and red lake.
6694554,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-29 08:21:00,8293,Wonder what a person would pay to be shuttled from MPLS to the resorts within say 100 miles of I-Falls?
6694558,prov1800,2022-10-29 08:28:00,5010,I remember wilderness air doing that and Gaurdian Eagle by siouxlookout still does it.
6694716,Camoclad,2022-10-30 11:52:00,628,"We would have considered it but I am sure flying would a bit too expensive considering we were already close to 3K in the trip. We have even looked at renting a plane to fly from Georgia and it is impossible to come close to the prices for commercial airlines, not to mention no one is going to send a plane to IFalls or a municipal airport in Ontario and have it sit for a week and then bring a group back. That is where a shuttle would be nice though probably still too expensive. Flying to IFalls by commercial airline really is convenient, until it isn't because of flight changes and the resulting chain reaction. It's all part of the process I suppose. Give me 5 more years and I am going to drive it to and fro and take the airport hassle out of the equation! Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6694718,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-30 12:01:00,8293,If you drive up the 3rd week of May and return home the 3rd week of Sept. you can eliminate a lot of the traffic jams in International Falls.
6693764,Mojo-NC,2022-10-25 18:17:00,1929,"Scheduling flights into and out of International Falls (INL) for a Canada fishing trip has become a royal PITA. There are fewer flights available and the cost to fly up to INL through Minneapolis is pushing $1000 now, which has nearly tripled since we first began fishing Canada. This past July, for no apparent reason our flight from NC to Minneapolis was delayed so many times that we ended up missing the last flight of the day to INL. They kept delaying it about an hour at a time until it was too late. At least we got to spend about 5 hours hanging out in the airport drinking $9 beers (sarcasm). The following day, the first flight available to INL wasn't until the afternoon, so we ended up losing a full day of fishing. We don't want that to happen again. We just booked flights for our trip to Canada September 2023. We ended up booking flights to Minneapolis instead of INL because the cost savings was so significant it justified the additional 5 hour drive. We've previously flown to Duluth, Winnipeg, and MSP. We swore we'd never drive from Minneapolis again because the drive from the lodge to the airport after a week of long days of fishing was brutal, but here we go again. This time we are allowing an additional day so the drive back is not so rushed and hectic. For others who fly up each year, what do you do? We've considered staying additional days to fly on less popular travel days where the flights are considerably cheaper, but a couple of the guys still work and don't want to burn that much vacation. Even of we did, what would we do - fish Rainy for a couple of days? I'm not sure that is even possible. There really doesn't seem to be a lot of other good options. Are there? Have I overlooked something?"
6693766,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-25 18:22:00,8293,Have you looked into flying into Duluth Mn? Won't help a lot but it will save you 2 hrs each way driving.
6693814,Wrktfsh,2022-10-26 06:59:00,492,Have you looked into flying to Fargo then rent a car one way? Delta connection can get pretty pricey at times flying into the regional airports.
6693816,prov1800,2022-10-26 07:00:00,5010,I had a had a couple of guys from Alabama this year that flew into wpg and rented a car and just drove the 4 1/2 hrs. To Vermilion Bay.They said everything went smooth.Mifht be worth looking at.
6693824,Larry S,2022-10-26 07:10:00,665,"Since I moved to Henderson, Nevada in 1998,I have been flying most of the time. Flew at first to Canada --Thunder bay but over the years it got More & More Crazy One year on way back instead of flying back Thunder bay to Toronto then on home to Las Vegas Airport I was re routed to Vancouver and had a 7 hour wait there before flying home to arrive at 1130PM instead of original time of 1PM. Have been flying into Minneapolis the last 5 years and renting a car. tried Duluth once but no straight flights there you first fly into Minneapolis and wait a couple of hours (at least) before heading to Duluth. Found it just as easy to drive from Minneapolis Have made flight arrangements for my 2023 trip at start of June already, also car rental prices this year are lower Have never flown into International Falls, did fly a couple of times into Winnipeg. Flying into Toronto is Crazzy Larry S"
6693840,phishfearme,2022-10-26 08:16:00,1242,"Just to add a bit to Larry's comments - we've flown for many years from PIT to either Thunder Bay (mainly), Duluth or MSP. Returning home on this past trip, we went Thunder Bay to Toronto to get back to PIT - the TOR to PIT flight was cancelled, and we had to stay overnight in a local (nice) motel. BUT - we had already cleared US customs and passport control at the Toronto airport, so we were officially in the US - then we had to get back into Ontario to get to the motel, so we had to clear Canada customs and passport control - then the next morning we had to again clear US customs and passport control - easily 10 hours of waiting in line. it's getting nothing but worse - my advice - avoid international travel - stay domestic and drive. it will not take any longer and will ultimately be cheaper. for the 2023 trip, we will fly non-stop PIT to MSP, meet up with Larry and Pat, rent a large car and drive almost to Pickle Lake. flying to Duluth is MAYBE a better option but it requires a connection, and the price is MUCH higher - and it's less than 2 hours' drive from MSP and this is easily eaten up by the connecting flight time. phish"
6693846,Tx Jig tyr,2022-10-26 09:30:00,140,"When searching flights, ck out Grand Forks, N.D. as a possibility, closer than Fargo, and less expensive than other destinations Tx Jig Tyr"
6693880,Mojo-NC,2022-10-26 12:33:00,1929,"Yes, we've actually flown into Duluth once. It was significantly less expensive that year. Now it costs about the same to fly into Duluth as it does INL."
6693882,Mojo-NC,2022-10-26 12:34:00,1929,I'll definitely check into that. Thanks!
6693884,Mojo-NC,2022-10-26 12:44:00,1929,"I think you're right. I'll check into the other suggestions, but I suspect from now on we'll just fly into MSP and be done with it. The layovers and connection flights take several hours and instead we can just drive to INL rather than fly. We can fly from Raleigh, NC to MSP on direct flights, flights to MSP are fairly reasonably priced in comparison to Winnipeg and other closer airports, and they offer several flights per day to better accommodate our schedules. We'll just have to add a full day either side of our trip to help account for the additional drive time. Thanks everyone for your input. I'll definitely check out all of the recommendations."
