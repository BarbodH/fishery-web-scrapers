Though I should add, we did take care not to use gps feature and powered unit down if we settled into a spot for awhile. When the camp provided ability to charge, we were less cautious about battery drainage and had absolutely no problem. Have also seen Lithium batteries used and though their purchase cost is higher, they'll perform much better."
6695656,prov1800,2022-11-06 21:25:00,5010,Is there a generator at camp
6695694,adempsey2.0,2022-11-07 06:47:00,611,"This is quite important to make a decision. If you have no way to charge the battery, you have to either find a unit that uses as little power as possible and possibly bring two large batteries, such as 12Ah or 10Ah lithium. It may be possible to get away with 1, but really depends on use time etc. Otherwise, finding a unit that uses AA batteries could be a better choice. The problem is they don't really make them anymore. At least, as far as I could tell. Humminbird used to sell a basic portable unit that ran on AA batteries called the Fish'n Buddy, but it may have been discontinued. I haven't seen the AA battery version of the PirahnaMax in a long time. Might have to look at the used market. It is possible to make a 12V portable battery pack with any sized Alkaline batteries as well. That really only makes sense if you have a unit that doesn't require much power."
6696052,Mojo-NC,2022-11-10 07:33:00,1929,"My first portable fish finder came with two options for power: a 12V battery power supply that used 8 1.5V D-cell batteries connected in series, or a single 12V gel cell battery (this was before the newer/better lithium batteries). I never used the D-cell source because I always had access to power for recharging a single 12V battery. Here is a similar setup.https://www.amazon.com/Aexit-Battery...s%2C317&sr=8-6 It can be used to power any 12V fish finder unit if there is no generator available."
6696082,cuamb,2022-11-10 10:02:00,203,I made a wood base with a Johnny Ray mtg. bracket and put a HDS 5 on it. I put a pocket on the back to hold a Vexilar battery. I did not use a lithium battery and had no problems going all day. Lithium would be a better option. You will need to be able to charge the battery. Amazon has a portable bracket for your transducer. It was great having a depth finder and mapping.
6696230,antimoniker,2022-11-11 15:37:00,5,"This spring I purchased a Striker Plus 4 and paired it with this Portable Fishing Kit, and then replaced the lead battery that came with the Kit with a Dakota Lithium 12V 7AH Battery. I really liked this set up on my 4 day fly in trip. It drew very little power at medium brightness and was pretty light weight and easy to portage with when paired with the lithium battery. I also liked the Quickdraw mapping, but didn't run that continuously. After 4 days, I checked the battery and I had only used 70% of the capacity of the 7AH battery. I have included links below. Hope this helps.https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/592096https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/543361https://dakotalithium.com/product/da...ah-battery-69/"

6696862,7thCrowWing,2022-11-16 18:26:00,132,Did the portable kit come with the transducer suction cup?
6696930,antimoniker,2022-11-17 10:19:00,5,"Yes, it did come with a suction cup and that is what I used. I had no problems with the suction cup on the 14' aluminum boats we were using."
6697798,7thCrowWing,2022-11-24 20:47:00,132,"Cabelas has the Striker 4 portable package on sale for $160, based on what i have seen elsewhere that is a really good price i think i am going to get that one. Thanks for all the help."
6697802,RichA$1970,2022-11-24 21:05:00,1159,My buddy got one for our fly in last June and it did the job just fine.
6695486,7thCrowWing,2022-11-05 19:31:00,132,"What is the best option for a fly in trip, in the past I have used a set up off the boat battery using alligator clips when we used camp boats but with weight limits and no boat motor battery not sure what to invest in. Looks like most posts on this are a few years old so wondering if there is anything new?"
6695500,last chance,2022-11-06 04:14:00,3262,if you have power to charge them back up try getting a small ATV battery and a charger just large enough that it will charge them back up overnight. if you don't have power at night I have no suggestions. most of the ATV batteries I've bought came with a dry battery and the acid in a separate container. so it can be transported to where your going dry.
6695502,prov1800,2022-11-06 04:52:00,5010,Best bet is a lithium battery.Very light like a pound and come with a very small and light charger.My battery runs my Lowrance hook 7 for about 3 days.
6695506,h8go4s,2022-11-06 05:27:00,1673,"It's been a few years since my last fly-in trip, but even then there was a solar panel charging batteries for the cabin lights and water pump. Pretty simple to wire your sonar battery into one of those batteries at night if you need to. (Not sure how that works with Lithium batteries). Take along a multi-meter to check your battery charge. Any fly-in lake I went to there wasn't much need to run sonar constantly; once you found fish it was hard not to catch them. But those were small lakes, only one cabin on them, so little fishing pressure."
6695512,Mojo-NC,2022-11-06 06:46:00,1929,"As prov1800 indicated, a 10Ah lithium (LiFeP04) battery is a great option. Lithium batteries require a special charger, so your old SLA battery charger won't work. I also picked up a 4Amp 12.8V-14.6V Lithium LifePO4 Battery Charger, so all said and done the total cost was about $75. We charged our batteries using the camp generator every evening while we were preparing and eating dinner, so it worked out great for our fly-in trip."

6695654,7thCrowWing,2022-11-06 20:08:00,132,"i had used an lowrance 334c many years ago on trip where we used camp boats, mounted it on top of a small cooler and used boat battery, wonder how much battery this would use if a went the lithium route as noted above, i could mount it on a board and take a clamp, i have the suction cup transducer. any input on battery usage for the 334C, we wont have boat battery on a fly in i assume. Thanks"
