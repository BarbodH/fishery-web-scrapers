I am posting our best day which was Wednesday over 250 walleyes with an amazing 70% over 20 inches. Our biggest on the week was 27 what an amazing drive to lake. Just gets better every year

6400820,Erie Ranger620,2020-02-28 10:34:00,74,Agreed drive there is worth it everything north of the bridge into Canada is really great scenery especially along Lake Superior. Hardest part of going to OSulliivans Rainbow is getting a cabin they are seriously booked but by putting your name into their list sooner or later something comes up
