The one i did catch was on a straight hook.anyways was fun trying"
6399588,Eckohlt,2020-02-25 12:53:00,3685,"John u taught them well not to bite anything on the end of your line there well educated,but like I say they will put the feed bag on at sunrise March 13,I refuse to have hot dogs for lunch over a walleye sandwich so I'll bring up my secret lures 100 percent effective,besides that I will have a dozen holes drilled outside they will find out in hurry your not the only one sticking hooks in there lips hahaha,rod"
6399698,prov1800,2020-02-25 18:38:00,5010,We will find out.havnt been there early yet.
6399966,walleyenewby,2020-02-26 11:57:00,36,Wondering if you knew how the Canadian trout taste in comparison to Lake Michigan ones? Only way I can eat Lake Michigan trout is smoked. Just don't enjoy the taste.
6399976,prov1800,2020-02-26 12:15:00,5010,"Ive heard that.i brought some canadian lake trout to a buddy in ill.He said they were sweet tasting.he wont eat them either from lake michigan.But we dont keep big ones here to eat.we mostly fry them like walleye.Bigger ones are ok but get greasy.Love the 20-22"" once here.Bigger ones always go back to fight another day."
6398600,prov1800,2020-02-22 15:28:00,5010,"Havnt got out to often yet for trout but had to go today.+2 a bit of a cool breeze and bluebird skies.Got to our spot and i started drilling holes and my wife cleaned the slush out of one and started fishing with a white tube and a minnow.By the time i drilled the other 7 holes and cleaned them out she put 3 on ice already.haha.Fishing was pretty hot today as we caught and released a number of but took 4 nice eating sized ones home for supper.Homes i drilled were in the 40-65 ft range on a gradual slow drop which has always been a great spot.White tube jig and 3-4"" minnow did the trick again.Disnt see to many fish on the Hook 7 but the ones we did see we could easily get them to commit.Had a couple that chased the lure to right under the when it took the bait.Just love that kinda action.Fished from 9-12 and headed home.never find trout to good in afternoon on this lake.Snow conditions are still low for this year and no wind ďrifts so the ride across the lake was very smooth."

6398816,Eckohlt,2020-02-23 12:20:00,3685,Take it easy on my pets below the shack John lol
6399408,prov1800,2020-02-25 05:24:00,5010,Was a slow day on Sat Rod only 5 walleye and 3 northern.???.One of those days.Never saw much action on the sonar.Tried 3-5 and either they were there earlier or after we left.It happens.I drilled a hole outside shack also.
6399460,Eckohlt,2020-02-25 07:09:00,3685,"John I don't think there going to bite again until March 13 that's my theory,I fired up my auger the other day I will bring it if it's nice out I'll make Swiss cheese out ofthe ice away from the shack walk around dunking holes trying to pick off eyes,rod"
6399466,prov1800,2020-02-25 07:22:00,5010,Good idea.there is a auger at camp you can use.its snowing and blowing so my trout pmans have changed today.thinking shack.try a bit earlier.a recon day lol.ill be fishing by 9:30 and try till noon.ill ley you know how it goes.
