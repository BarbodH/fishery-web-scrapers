6396000,BornToFish,2020-02-14 06:59:00,1224,"Greetings, The recent post by Limey triggered some thoughts. I used to fish a good musky lake not too far from Dryden. I was fortunate to connect on several occasions on a fantastic musky/pike bite during the autumn. The timing of this bite was highly dependent upon autumn weather patterns - cool/cold versus warmer weather. I noticed that the timing of this window seemed to coincide with the ten to fourteen days prior to turnover. As I mentioned above, this window might happen in mid-September or mid-October - all depending upon weather. The weeds in this lake tended to begin dying off in earnest when the water temperature hit the upper 50s to low 60s. The baitfish such as perch would be funneled into ever smaller patches of green weeds. Casting around three green weeds in close proximity to one another was often like finding a gold mine. Finding the green weeds could be challenging. I looked in small coves and bays that were protected, received sun and waves bringing in warmer surface waters. I typically fished these places in the middle of the day and afternoon. I wanted water temperature to be at its daily peak. I would keep the boat in ten feet of water or so, and would cast into shore. I most often threw baits that I could work SLOWLY and keep above the weeds - e.g. jerk baits and twitch baits. These baits were typically eight inches in length. The key to my success was slowly working the baits, with many deadstick pauses thrown in for good measure. This pattern would break down about the time the water turned over in the lake. By then, I believe the weeds were pretty much dead. This coincided with the water in the lake being the ""same"" wherever the fish wanted to go. The fish were not finding an advantage to being in any particular place. I have many fond memories of fishing this fall pattern. I just wish that I could have timed the window better. I fished the window in some years and not others. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6395752,Limeyangler,2020-02-13 09:53:00,563,"I have only recently started 'targeting' pike and musky. I started experimenting with musky fishing in particular last fall. I spent a lot of time and money casting different lures. I got tired and bored throwing the huge baits that conventional wisdom says to use for musky, so I decided to throw some smaller baits reasoning that at least I would catch a few more pike while waiting for a musky and ease the potential of repetitive strain injury. What happened next was I started to catch musky almost immediately by downsizing. I also was catching some nice size pike too. Because the fish seemed to be in and around shallow weeds at the end of September until the weed died off by mid October I was using light spoons and suspending twitch baits which allowed me to buzz across the tops of weed and then vary retrieve speed to go deeper in pockets and once I hit the weed edge. 3 lures quickly became my go to favourites, a 4.5"" Shimano Waxwing Jr. slow sinking/suspending bait, a 3"" Lucky Strike Warden's Worry and a 7"" Lucky Strike Canoe spoon."

6300158,prov1800,2019-03-15 08:46:00,5010,I my experience taking guys for pike o have come to the conclusion that 90%of them just want to cast.not many have the patience to go deeper.I understand that as deeper fishing is slow for pike.It can pay off though if your after bigger fish than than near shore.La≈ïger pike in closer to shore are there just eating what they got in the deep water.So if you get lucky you might find one willing to bite while it's there.my go to lures are a Joe butcher slop master.this lure has been it's weight in gold for me as well as hooking muskies.they other bait i would through is the Krave Jr.The Krave goes 6-7 ft but has great action and when you stop it floats up backwards.my perch colored one is good all season and my white one is a killer in late fall when the whitefish come in shallow to spawn. As far as summer fishing goes I use a Bondi bait when my guests are walleye fishing deeper water or hang a dead bait.Basically most BIG pike are caught by accident mostly on a jig and minnow.Of course water bodies are very important and any system that has current will produce larger pike in shallower water all season.My favorite lake is Clay Lake for pike.Clay is mostly a river system with huge pike willing to bite all the time for 28 mi.Lac suel is another great system as water temps in main channel stay cool well into July making all the rock piles you can hit great spots.lol.plus if you know where the weed beds are your in business.

Rapala f18 Silver/Black or Firetiger I have had many many over 40 inch largest 47 if I had to chose one Mepps #5 I even talked to Mepps to make a twin blade #5 and they do now and are just as good.

6299036,BornToFish,2019-03-12 11:21:00,1224,"Greetings, My favorite pike lure depends upon the time of the season. For me, it all boils down to the willingness of the pike to chase down a lure. I classify the lures by speed: fast moving, regular speed and slow moving. I will often be throwing a spoon if they are willing to chase down a lightning bolt and stuff it into a bottle. The Dr. Spoons and Daredevles are tough to beat in red/white, yellow five-o-diamonds or hammer copper/orange swirl color schemes. I retrieve these lures fast! The next slower lures that I routinely throw are spinner baits - either in-line or bent-arm style. I can burn these along about as fast as a spoon (bulging under the surface) or slow-roll them. I throw a lot of jerk baits (e.g. Suicks or Bobby's) and minnow baits (e.g. Shallow Raiders or Crane baits) in the early season and again at the end of the season when the water is cold and the fish are not willing to chase a lure. I can fish these lures with plenty of pauses to tempt reluctant fish. An advantage of the spoons and blade baits is needing to deal with only one hook when releasing a fish. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
