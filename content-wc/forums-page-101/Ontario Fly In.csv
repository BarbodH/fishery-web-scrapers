6387138,TitanD,2020-01-17 14:37:00,43,"We are going to Root Bay on Lake St Joseph May 24-June 1 this year. First time to the lake and looking forward to it. We have been going North for many years and like many have said lots of great lakes with quantity and some with better size opportunity. We have been with Clarks multiple times and so far our favorite is Wright Lake. Good clean camps with all the outpost amenities (including generators and free minnows/bottled water). Wright Lake has produced several over 40"" Pike for us in the past and Walleyes on average are bigger than most of the fly ins we have been to in the past. No monster over 30+ fish (probably a few there) but lots of fish 22-26"". I would not call it a numbers lake necessarily but lots of water to fish with a few connecting lakes that can be very good as well. We will likely return one day but we tend to be nomads and like wandering around to different lakes to try something new and different every year. I also know someone that has been to Snelgrove and really likes that lake with Clarks.I think Clarks is in that $1300 range for a 7 day trip so pretty reasonable considering what you get. Really like what we have experienced thus far in the planning phase of the trip with Ryan at Slate Falls Outposts. Everything I read, hear and from what I have observed thus far they run a top notch fly in camp service. Can't wait!Good luck in your search."
6387230,Daveygravy,2020-01-17 20:51:00,88,"Hooker lake with Slate Falls. It's part of the Miniss river system, so you have multiple lakes to fish and a couple of river sections as well. The whole system has big numbers of walleye. If you go, check out Minko lake. The east end has some big pike and it's one of the most serene lakes I've fished. The lakes aren't large, so weather is generally not a problem. Slate Falls is a top notch outfitter. Our group now goes to their camp on Eagle Island lake St. Joe .I fished the system for many years from a different camp on Arc lake and would be happy to help out."
6387268,Mike Borger,2020-01-18 07:52:00,1554,"Would really love to hear about Arc, I'm fishing it early June this year."
6387280,Skywagon,2020-01-18 10:14:00,1106,"I looked at a cabin on Arc and the adjoining one that was for sale on Taper 4-5 years ago (North Umbrian was the outfitter at the time), the Arc cabin was situated on the S/E end of the lake. A small bear could almost crawl through the hole in the floor at the cabin on Taper, the sleeping cabin on Arc was not too bad, the other cabin on Arc was nothing to write home about. At the time they were asking waaay too much money for what I considered tear-downs. Another outfitter may have the LUP now, or the cabin may have been rejuvenated, I don't know, did not keep up on it. I did notice at the time that someone had written on the wall of the Arc cabin that the fishing was not too bad out a short distance from the cabin. Davygravy can probably provide more information."

6390892,Waba,2020-01-29 16:50:00,25,Hard to beat Erringtons Wilderness Island for great walleye fishing!
6398636,forgop,2020-02-22 16:52:00,880,"I fished Maskara I believe in July 2016. Nice camp as all of their camps. It's not a large lake, but I really enjoyed it. At the lake opposite of the camp is a nice reef for jigging and between the other 2 larger bodies of water, there's a spot that is literally 3' deep where jigging for numbers was just incredible. This was by far my most successful fishing trip as an inexperienced walleye fisherman. We caught far more walleye than pike but there were still decent numbers of pike when we trolled a bit. If you're on facebook, I have some pics I can share and I'm pretty sure I have the lake map marked up somewhere."
6386534,tv4fish,2020-01-15 05:10:00,2694,"That pretty much ""sums it up""....... Along with that, however, is the ""experience itself"".I/We have been going to the Lac Seul area for over 35 years - the fishing (catching) is the main reason we go - BUT - it also provides a great experience of seeing and experiencing the great Canadian outdoors with 2 buddies that I have known since grade school.We have had many 100 fish per day experiences ourselves and they are flat out fun - the doubles and triples catches are unforgettable, and - yes we have caught walleyes over 29"" also. Of course, finding and trying new areas are also part of the experience. It's a challenge that we try to undertake each and every year.That entire ""Canadian experience"" is something that we just flat out look forward to each and every year. We will keep doing it until we can't.................."
6386760,pjshorthorn,2020-01-16 06:33:00,5654,"Has anyone fished Maskara Lake through Slate Falls? . Looks like a nice camp, but the fishing seems to be strictly a numbers lake for walleye. Any pike fishing on that lake ? The website doesn't really have a lot of information about that particular outpost camp. I like the fact that it is remote and take smaller groups of 2-5 folks all season. PjShorthorn"
6386800,prov1800,2020-01-16 09:38:00,5010,"PJ.Clarks has outposts that will take smaller groups.Be like Zizania only with a cabin.Generator,bottled water they bring in to cut down on weight and all the minnows you will ever need.Pusher Lake has a smaller cabin and has access to Upper Wapesi.Walleyes uo to 27""and some pike to 40"" so the lakes are no slouch."

6386852,wallydave,2020-01-16 14:32:00,2151,"I had a fantastic week of fishing on Minniss through Hidden Bay Lodge! They have a food plan to start, it's like an American plan but you are on your schedule. They put you up the night before the flight, get plane, and staff, say Hi to Shaggy for me! Now the important part, we had a early Sep. week, no bugs. a couple of nights with the Northern lights, now the best part, fishing off the map they gave us, we had some nonstop fishing with plenty of strong tasty walleyes, Breezy Point came with us, "" I've fished Ontario for over 50 years, some.of the best walleye fishing ever! Google it!"
6386854,Eckohlt,2020-01-16 15:12:00,3685,"I can vouch for upper wappesi,it's not rocket science fishing that lake very easy and you can't get lost on the lake even if you tried.It's full of really nice eye's lots n lots over 20 inches"
6386970,pjshorthorn,2020-01-17 05:10:00,5654,"Thanks John. I'll look into those lakes. Upper Wapesi intrigues me since it looks accessible by boat only. I found both on my wall map of Lac Seul. They look like nice lakes and those are quality sized fish for sure. Now, if I could only fly from Pusher into Zizania for a day....that would be an epic week long trip then. Hmmmmm.......now the wheels are turning. Come up a day early, fish Zizania the first day and then fly in to Pusher the next morning for a week. PjShorthorn"
6386976,prov1800,2020-01-17 05:45:00,5010,That sounds like a great plan.i know lots of spots in both lakes.i could mark maps for you guys .each lake has a hump in it that really produces walleyes at all times during the days..pushers cabin is really nice with a great location.never stayed there but grabbed some minnows from there as we had run out and went and checked it out.i did a show in there a couple of years ago.might be on clarks site but its on youtube to.
6387070,3M TA3,2020-01-17 10:26:00,2846,"Don't know where you're from or how you enter Ontario however should you have to pass Highway 527 near Thunder Bay you could shoot up to Armstrong Station. Mattice Lake Outfitters can get you in to some awesome fishing lakes. My last trip was at Attwood Lake and fishing was incredible. Jigging and bottom bouncing was so fast and furious our arms ached at times. Big numbers of fish from 2 to 4 lbs, with an occasional 5 to 6 as well as an occasional pike too. When we couldn't stand the pain in the arms from all the action we'd retreat to some trolling and picked up a good number of pike, many in the 30 to 36 inch range with 2 that exceeded 40 inches. Lots of walleye that way too. We just did it to rest our arms though. You want numbers, you'll surely get them there."
6386384,Bigtaproot,2020-01-14 11:18:00,900,"Hello Friends, 3 of us have made a handful of trips to Lake St Joe. We are interested in walleyes in quantity. I have never done a fly in trip. Does anyone have a favorite fly in destination to catch walleyes in quantity. Size is nice too but mainly interested in action. Thanks, Bigtaproot"
6386392,adempsey2.0,2020-01-14 11:46:00,611,There are so many great options!My trip to St.Joe with Slate Falls Outposts was pretty incredible. We stayed at the Root Bay camp at the far west end of Joe. They have a number of other camps and lakes as well. They fly out of Sioux Lookout.I can't say enough good things about North Caribou Camps either. The fishing on North Caribou is incredible. They fly out of Thunderbay.You woulf probably be better served if you offered a budget and how far you are willing to drive. There are 100's of fly-in camps that have great Walleye fishing.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk
6386404,prov1800,2020-01-14 12:17:00,5010,"As dempsey said many options.If you want to look around have a look at www.clarksresorts.com.They have 24 outposts north of Lac Suel.All have generators to charge your toys,bottled water and free minnows brought in every couple of days.Been to some of them and they have all been fast action and more than you can count in a day. If you need specifics on something that catches your eye just message me for info."
6386414,Mojo-NC,2020-01-14 12:43:00,1929,"I don't really get the numbers thing. I get a little bored catching fish when it takes no skill whatsoever to catch them. We usually end up trying a bunch of different techniques to see if we can get them to work when there is a good bite on. Dropping a minnow and jig and catching a hundred fish or more day after day is fun for a little while, but gets old as the week wears on. It's a good problem to have though..."
6386420,prov1800,2020-01-14 12:53:00,5010,Agreed.but most flyouts are just like that as are a number of drive inns.Trying different techniques is a lot of fun though when action like that.There are a number of lakes that have good fish populations that are void of fisherman because they are tough to fish. Most fisherman get one week up here and live to catch a 100+ a day.Nothing wrong with that in my book.Personally i like the tough lakes myself also.
6386440,grindstone,2020-01-14 14:01:00,201,"We have been flying in to Moose Point Lodge for 15 years. It's the best week of the year and I go a lot of places to fish. We have a group that ranges from usually a dozen to as many as 22 one year. The owners Brad and Donna have maintained Moose Point as catch and consume for all those years. We take a couple of 16"" walleye for lunch and everything else goes back. In a typical day finding ones small enough for lunch is the biggest challenge. A 100 walleye for my son and I by lunch break is not unusual. There are windows every year where you can't get a 1/4 of jig and leech to the bottom in 14 FOW - literally. Donna is great cook. Breakfast and Dinner at the Lodge. Great home made breads cookies and deserts and a variety of entries w soup or salads. Afternoons my son and I usually chase SM. One SM afternoon while I struggled w boat control in a wind blown boulder strewn bay my son nabbed 13 walleye on 13 casts w a gold # 3 Mepps. I really can't say enough good things about this place."
6386450,stumcfar,2020-01-14 14:33:00,451,"To each his own, but I agree with numbers. I go on fishing trips to catch fish. Of course 100 14"" walleyes would get tiresome, but I have never seen that happen. To say you get tired of catching fish and want to spend a trip running around trying things to see what works is not what I am about. Find the fish and catch them all day! I don't no how that could get tiresome in a week! We are trying a fly in that is new to us this year, but have heard good things. The key to fly ins and new lakes is finding the fish. They are there, but it make take some time to pin point them when you are the only boats on the lake. Good luck with your search!"
6386478,RichA$1970,2020-01-14 17:07:00,1159,"Camp Lake St Joe is a boat in, half the $ of the fly ins and tons of walleyes n pike for an option. Not sure your budget but boat ins don’t get delayed due to weather, fires or mechanical issues along with weight restrictions."
6386492,Bstar,2020-01-14 18:59:00,564,X2 on Slate Falls Outposts. We've been to Miniss Lake twice with them and we're going back this year. Six guys caught over 1500 fish last August and two of them have never been walleye fishing before much less to Canada! You can also check out Boreal Forest Outfitters out of Nakina. Melchett Lake is a walleye factory. Amik Outposts' Cobham Lake outpost is a numbers and size lake as well as some huge pike.
