6400538,Esoxfeign1313,2020-02-27 18:43:00,79,Lol right? Glad I’m not the only one who was going cross-eyed from reading those regs. Clear as mud.
6400688,adempsey2.0,2020-02-28 07:00:00,611,This is how I interpret that: You can possess 1 Walleye between 35 and 45cm in length OR it can be over 70cm OR 1 Sauger of any size. In the stated water region.So 1 fish. They often combine similar species into the same limit. Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk
