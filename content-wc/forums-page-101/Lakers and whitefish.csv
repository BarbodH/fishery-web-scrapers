Actually went to the same spot two days ago and managed one whitefish and some pike and lost two trout at the hole, one being the biggest trout I have ever had on my line, felt like throwing up. That first day there were tons of fish around but they were being finicky, so I went back today much earlier in the morning, it paid off! Had around 8 whitefish in the 24” to 27” range, a couple of pike and landed two lakers, the bigger one at 34” and lost 3 with numerous chasers, all that packed into 4 hours made for a fun morning. I was fishing in 34’FOW , pike and lakers were on a 4” tube jig, and the whitefish were going crazy for a 1” purple and white crappie tube jig on a blue and glow 16th oz jig."
