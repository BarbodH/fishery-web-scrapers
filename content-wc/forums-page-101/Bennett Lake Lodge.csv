Curious about the walleye fishing since it is connected to Guniseo via a creek/river. Price is pretty decent for that area of MB.http://www.bennettlakelodge.com Thanks, Brett"

6400310,Eckohlt,2020-02-27 11:18:00,3685,Brett does that price include the float plane?
6400322,bthomas3333,2020-02-27 11:37:00,465,"It does but I am not clear on what departure city. There is an option just North of Winnipeg and another one 3 hours north off Lake Winnipeg...that I know of. It is one of many questions a call to the outfitter would answer, but I was hoping to hear anything about the fishing first.The real appeal to me is the location with the connection to Guniseo and the larger walleyes in that lake. I would think the genetic freaks in Guniseo would cross over to this lake. The price is comparable to regular ON outposts.Brett"
