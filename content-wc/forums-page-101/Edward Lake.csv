6400302,prov1800,2020-02-27 11:09:00,5010,Ron there are 2 shacks there.the one your in is nice and cozy and really warms up.holes will have to be opened when you get there.the shack i fish from is right beside other one but the hole there is always open and heated with a light bulb.they keep minnows there and makes it easy to get them out.colder in that shack.to cold today.lol.
