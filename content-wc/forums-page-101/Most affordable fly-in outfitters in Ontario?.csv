6400300,Mich_Fisherman,2020-02-27 11:08:00,292,"By far the best fly in the I have been to is Expeditions North flying out of Hornepayne. Main reason is the fishing!! Trophy walleye with 29"" -30"" caught every year by our group as well as eaters!www.expeditions-north.com for pricing (under $1,000 for the week) -Housekeeping only option available. -Log cabins 24hr electricity, electric fridge, gas stove, wood burner for heat ( unlimited cut and dried wood for burning provided) -Running water (using commercial water purification system) -Full kitchen with all pots/pans/dishes/silverware -16' Lund boats/20hp 4 stroke engines, including fish finders/life jackets/nets/anchors - Boats gassed and bailed (if rain) every morning - Minnows always available for purchase - camp fish fry during with week - Customer focused ownership. David makes sure things are right."
6401112,forgop,2020-02-28 23:54:00,880,"There are a few still out there, but not many. I couldn't justify these $3-5k/week trips no matter how they are and as long as I have a shower, I can rough it enough for a single week. I realize if I was in a group of 6, my options would go up a lot."
6399030,forgop,2020-02-24 06:55:00,880,I didn't know of the above site to search for outfitters. Will give them all a look. Thanks!
6399032,MrSimon,2020-02-24 07:08:00,922,"We found Boreal Forrest to be a fantastic bargain. Sure, maybe you could find something a few hundred cheaper, but Jason and Sue run a great operation that you can trust, and the fishing is excellent. If you really need to pinch pennies, most groups can dial the food/beverage budget way back and still be completely fine. I know my group could EASILY cut $150 per person if we shopped smarter and didn't buy so much extra tackle that we don't need."
6399048,gordy28,2020-02-24 07:46:00,437,Adam's site is awesome! Depending on when you want to go Dan at White River Air may be willing to work on price We enjoyed our trips with him Andrew
6399076,MrSimon,2020-02-24 09:27:00,922,"I got to thinking, so I looked up numbers from our trip with Boreal last year. 5 Guys. 2,600 miles in a motor home (9 mpg). $1,494 per person -- including gas (15%), outfitter(70%), tips(3%), food/beverages(9%), and tolls(2%)."
6399102,adempsey2.0,2020-02-24 10:28:00,611,Another point is that both White River Air and Leuenbergers both list rates in Canadian $.A 7-day trip with WRA can be $825 USD and $700 USD with Leuenberger's.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk
6399104,forgop,2020-02-24 10:29:00,880,"I just emailed them. Of note, I like the Spot X because it would save me from activating my inReach that would be $100+ to activate for unlimited service for the week. I've got so much stuff gear/tackle I could lose quite a bit on each trip the next 5 years and still be good to go there. I usually don't do anything extravagant with the meal planning as it's usually pancakes or eggs/sausage and I'll bring in something like pre-made chili or something from the smoker that I'll freeze and just heat and serve to cut down on preparation at camp and it's mostly potatoes with fish for hopefully 2 meals/day. The beer is staying in the budget as well. LOL My small group size works against me for getting a better rate per person, but I just can't find people who want to give up their suburban lifestyle to do it. The guy who turned me onto these trips said he had no interest his first trip and refused to go after he got back from Vietnam, but the group said they'd pay for his spot and all the beer he could drink. He's been going every year since."
6399312,forgop,2020-02-24 19:31:00,880,"Not with my group size unfortunately. Heard back from Leuenbergers, MLO, Boreal Forest, 7 Lakes, and Air Dale. So far 7 Lakes and Air Dale are the top choices from a price standpoint. Even the cheapest options and figuring any discount for a kid is still $3k+ after taxes for 3.

6399434,RichA$1970,2020-02-25 05:58:00,1159,I would just be leery on some of those camps that are on small lakes under 500 acres
6399444,MrSimon,2020-02-25 06:18:00,922,"Honestly, if your budget is less than $1000 per person, you might want to just do a drive-in. They are less than half the price and you'll likely have a much nicer cabin, better boats, and a larger lake to explore."
6399472,adempsey2.0,2020-02-25 07:37:00,611,"A fly'in lodge works too because the flights would be full, effectively making the group size less relevant. Many have cabins for groups of 2 or 3 as well.For example, Waltons Kay Vee Lodge on Nagagami is $1055 CDN/person with no minimum required. Children <16 are also 1/2 price in July and August.Kaby Kabins on Kabinakagami is $1145 CDN/person. Children 14 and under are 50% off with 2 adults. Not sure if 15+ counts as an adult, but it technically should sine you are paying a full fare.Watsons Windy Point Lodge on Kabinakagami is also reasonable. Especially with kids.Of course, there are certainly places you can drive-to that charge $1000 or less per week for the cabin.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6398630,forgop,2020-02-22 16:35:00,880,"Just wondered who you might recommend at the moment for most affordable fly-in outfitters in Ontario at the moment. This is a trip I'm kinda taking without having budgeted so the $1500/person trips just won't work. Just need the basics with a shower, nothing fancy and prefer good fishing hopefully. Just now going to start inquiring for open weeks hopefully in July. TIA"
6398644,stjoeguy,2020-02-22 17:05:00,979,Try Miniss Lake with Slate Falls Outposts. $999https://slatefallsoutposts.com/our-s...tario-fishing/
6398650,forgop,2020-02-22 17:24:00,880,"Unfortunately, I'm limited to just 3. Verne may give me some good pricing given I'm a repeat and some referrals. I went to Maskara last time."
6398706,Bstar,2020-02-23 06:25:00,564,I would give Verne or Ryan a call and see if you could work something out. You could also try Boreal Forest Outfitters out of Nakina. Very reasonable pricing and they have just bought some of Mattice Lakes outposts.
6398792,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-02-23 10:20:00,240,"I was at Auger Lake w/Mattice Outfitters in 2016, was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the prices were, especially factoring in the very nice cabin and excellent fishing. Best of all, they will fly in groups as small as 2 or 3, depending on which month/lake you are looking at. We went in May/June. I believe that Auger was one of the outposts sold...."
6398820,RichA$1970,2020-02-23 12:45:00,1159,Try Boreal Forest or Twin Lakes Outfitters our of Nakina.
6398904,adempsey2.0,2020-02-23 18:27:00,611,Go to this site: https://fishingoutposts.com/listing-..._outpost_camp/Click Price and select the single $. That lists everything <$1250.Still populating the database though.

The outfitter provides boats. Definitely the cheapest option.https://exc-adventures.com/https://www.wilderness-air-escapes.com/
6399006,prov1800,2020-02-24 05:23:00,5010,Give clarks a look.They have many options with the 24 outposts they run from there base at cedar lake. And take a look at tgere Anishinabi Lake Lodge to.www.clarksresorts.com
6399022,MrSimon,2020-02-24 06:44:00,922,So what IS your budget?
6399026,forgop,2020-02-24 06:52:00,880,"Trying to stay around $1k per person so I know that makes for a relatively narrow field of outfitters. I got to talking with one of my patients about fishing a couple of days ago and the fever hit me and here I am deciding with zero planning to budget another $3500 for the trip, gas, and hotels, not to mention taking a week off of work without pay."
