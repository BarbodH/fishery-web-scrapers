6397576,Namegosikaa,2020-02-18 18:42:00,61,Not sure if still do it but I believe meta lake lodge rented the outpost camp for ice fisherman accessing the lake via trail not sure if they still do.
6397604,johnboat,2020-02-18 20:16:00,2014,"Give Ian a call at Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock. It might be what you are looking for. It's a drive to camp and you will be staying in a very nice winter cabin.You can fish right on the lake your staying at or choose from a handful of lakes that you take the sleds to. I have been going there for 18 years in Spring and went twice on an ice fishing/hunt. With plans to go again.Ian is very knowlegeable on the area and will have the latest details on the hotspots from the locals. The ice fishing package is something he started up a while back and he will work his butt off to make your trip a good one..........oh, and the cost is extremely reasonable. And yes, he'll have all the equipment you'll need and it's a first rate. From the sleds to the hut, heater, auger.......Don't book untill you talk to him first. He'll be glad to visit and will be glad to answer any questions.I was up there January 18-26. Beautiful Country! Feel free to PM me if you wish."

It does seem like a few do operate and offer up some form of ice fish packages for us die hards....great to see. We are located a LONG ways from the NW,eg, Red Lake region. Probably not a possibility being winter. Our spring drive from home to Nakina in June is 14hrs and obviously we dont mind tht 1 bit...this time of yr, more than that is iffy. Lake Simcoe for perch, lakers,etc is always a great day trip or even overnight on the lake in a good hut setup. Pascha Lodge is driveable for us and seems to be a great option as well for a solid few days of walleyes. Ive been on this board for several yrs and hadnt really thought i ever read a post on the spring-fall outfitters operating thru the winter. Thought it was worth a try to see what guys thought. Cheers!"
6395992,gmattbruin,2020-02-14 06:42:00,174,"Our group has been faithfully fly-in with twin Lakes Outfitters and our go-to lake has been Abamasagi for many yrs now. What im wondering is, how many of these outfitters open up and allow sledding in, staying over and ice fishing their lakes this time of yr. I know im interested and my son who has been going with our group since he was 10....now, 22, has all the gear for overnights, etc ice fish. Anyone know of any add your thoughts"
6396016,hoppy63,2020-02-14 07:22:00,367,"I read on some of these forums of ice fishing in Canada, but it is usually all Simcoe which makes sense since it is well known, is/was great perching, easy access as far as traveling to and from, etc.....but I am looking for some info or stories on some of the places that people may drive to or areas where people fly out of during the ""soft water"" season that people have hit during ice season....areas from maybe Wawa, Longlac, Geraldton, Nakina.....and west to the areas north of Ft Francis on up to Red Lake. Curious of how people have found travel in the winter, any of the lodges and or guides people have used, how they found the fishing to be compared to summer, basically the whole experience. I would love to go up some time and be able to enjoy some time on the ice and the scenery but the weather and travel are obvious factors/wild cards in any planning. Just curious to hear anyone's stories or info or recommendations. I posted this same question in another forum and read this post so thought I would piggyback along and pose same question here. I would love to come spend some time up north ice fishing but would most likely be more interested in having an outfitter to supply cabins, machines and huts since I and whoever's might come with me are older now."
6396022,Eckohlt,2020-02-14 07:31:00,3685,"Pashalakecabins has many snowmobile lakes you can go to although I've never been there,I did talk to him on the phone and sounds like a winter wonderland for all species of fish,rod"
6396026,Eckohlt,2020-02-14 07:35:00,3685,Also you could try Winoga lodge they have remote ice fishing packages
6396030,Eckohlt,2020-02-14 07:46:00,3685,Cobb bay lodge there website has ice fishing package also
6396052,MrSimon,2020-02-14 08:19:00,922,"Even though many of the fly-in lakes are accessible by snow machine, I wouldn't count on too many outfitters letting you do it .... unless they specifically advertise ice fishing. I've often wondered about the legality of doing a DIY ice fishing trip to the lakes north of Nakina. There are gated logging and access roads that lead right up to many of those lakes. I know it's illegal for non-natives to drive a truck up those roads in the summer, but I don't know if the rules are different in the winter."
6396144,prov1800,2020-02-14 10:58:00,5010,The only outfitter that does snowmobile in trips is clarks in the Vermioin bay area.They have a fly out lodge they take people and its a 40 mi ride on a groomed trail.They have cabins there and main lodge.Generator gets fired up so you will have lights and be able to charge sonar batteries and at lodge there is wifi.There are a number have portable shacks up on main lake for trout and some shacks up on a few other lakes for walleye and some more trout.They also have sled rentals.Some big fish fries in lodge after a da√Ω of fishing.I posted last week on here about Anishinabi Lake Lodge.Check it and heres there web site.Awesome trips.The real deal.www.clarksresorts.com3
6396192,Skywagon,2020-02-14 13:42:00,1106,"I would suggest contacting Colin Gosse https://lacseulguide.com/ , or Winoga Lodge https://www.winoga.com Both are in the Sioux Lookout area, do winter snowmobile-ice fishing trips and are well respected in the fishing community."
6397296,MrSimon,2020-02-18 07:02:00,922,I checked with an outfitter in Nakina on this. Apparently much of the land between Nakina and the best lakes is owned by mining companies and its trespassing to use the trails. He also said that almost all of the outfitters only have insurance during the summer months and therefore wouldn't transport guests or allow them to use their cabins during the winter. Sounds like just going with one of the outfitters listed above that advertises ice fishing is the way to go.
6397314,Eckohlt,2020-02-18 07:57:00,3685,"Mrsimon good job on researching that about flyin ice fishing,your a researching guru,now can you find me a flyin lake full of 30 inch walleye and you and I will both go there lol,rod"
