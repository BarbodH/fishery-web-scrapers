6398818,forgop,2020-02-23 12:24:00,880,He mentioned it but I cannot recall the reason off the top of my head and I can't seem to find the email. I believe it's just for the 2020 season.
6390430,MrSimon,2020-01-28 13:43:00,922,Nothing at all wrong with having WiFi. There's no rule saying people HAVE to use it.
6390462,KSjim,2020-01-28 14:22:00,88,Very true. Last year our group of 8 had 6 users- 2 non users. I am old school and don't care for it but a couple guys in our group would not of went if it was not available. In today's world if I am an outfitter I would be looking to provide it.
6390580,RichA$1970,2020-01-28 20:11:00,1159,My outfitter did it to cut costs and eliminate the mid week check in which is typically a waste of their time. nobody is pressuring me to turn it on and it beats packing hustlers.
6390830,Guest,2020-01-29 13:24:00,0,"Hidden Bay in Sioux Lookout does have WIFI at all their fly in outpost. True outposts which you seek. not a fly in lodge. including flush toilets hehe. Our group has been flying into their Miniss Lake outpost for years now. Great Fishing. Big lake. Their cabins also has free satellite phone service, where you can call their main lodge to order things and also call back home to the USA, at no extra cost. the guys like this. Able to check in with the wardens back home. Also, Hidden Bay's rate also include all your food at the outpost. Something we really like. No need to go shopping for groceries and less to pack.www.hiddenbay.com Tell them Steveoh sent ya."
6398750,forgop,2020-02-23 08:29:00,880,"Anjigaming does have WiFi and the last I contacted Martin, they weren't going to fish Anjigaming in 2020. I was kind of hoping to book there this year myself."
6398752,forgop,2020-02-23 08:32:00,880,"In my experience, the inReach does work great. That said, the annual cost and the one month I pay for unlimited use amounts to about $125 for the trip. Therefore, WiFi can be much more economical and reliable than taking an inReach."
6398758,forgop,2020-02-23 08:36:00,880,I prefer to do as nature intended and find a spot away from camp or wherever rather than ever use one of those outhouses.
6398760,forgop,2020-02-23 08:39:00,880,"This is true. If you pack well, there's no need for a mid-week check and I'd be more about waiving the mid-week check to lower my cost."
6398796,stjoeguy,2020-02-23 10:44:00,979,"The Winoga Lake St. Joseph outpost cabin has wifi. I used to look forward to a week away from everything, so when wifi was brought in a few years ago I had mixed feelings. It would definitely be good for a business owner, however, if it allowed him to get away when he otherwise couldn't.https://www.winoga.com/outposts.html"
6398808,bthomas3333,2020-02-23 12:04:00,465,I have been very interested in Anjigaming. Did they give a reason why it wasn't opening? How about 2020?B-
6390030,bthomas3333,2020-01-27 10:18:00,465,"Hi all, Strange question but has anyone experienced with wifi at any outposts, true outposts not lodges or mini lodges. I am talking places in the ~2500-1500 USD or less for a week. I know a few but I was hoping to find a few more. Viking Island fly-out of Red Lake $1350 Apisko (Sas) fly-out of Winnipeg $1600 Edmund Lake (Elk Island) fly-out of Winnipeg $2600 Does anyone have any other options? Thanks, Brett"
6390032,gordy28,2020-01-27 10:20:00,437,Hey Brett I believe Hidden Bay out of Sioux Lookout also offer wifi at their outpostshttp://hiddenbay.com/our-lakes Thanks Andrew

6390084,MrSimon,2020-01-27 12:17:00,922,"Depending on what you need the WiFi for, you might be able to just use an InReach device. We used one on our last trip for texting and it worked great! I don't really know what other features and functions they have though."
6390086,bthomas3333,2020-01-27 12:27:00,465,"Thanks! I have an in reach and agree they work great. So great in fact my group of 6 fishing Cree in June now has one in each boat. That way we can separate on the big water and not worry about getting stuck with motor problems with no help coming until late or morning. We can just text in reach to in reach and have help on the way along with exact GPS coordinates of the sender.For the purposes here I need true internet for voice and ideally to login to systems. Doesn't need much bandwidth or data. My wife and I both run small businesses and for us both to get away at the same time we can't go completely off the grid and sat phones are a pain and have little to no data unless you send a bunch of $.Thanks,Brett"
6390108,spoonchucker,2020-01-27 13:15:00,82,Wi Fi worked great at Reilly Lake outpost last season.
6390302,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-01-28 07:22:00,240,"Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts now have wifi, (unfortunately). I know a lot of people are overjoyed by this, but not me. I enjoyed being able to unplug for a week. But that genie is never going back into the bottle. Next up is flush toilets and air conditioning."
6390314,MrSimon,2020-01-28 07:45:00,922,I agree about not wanting WiFi at an outpost. But would you really turn down in-door flush toilets?!? I've spent enough time sitting on piss-soaked particle board in the middle of the night hoping a bear would actually come eat me so I wouldn't have to smell that awful wind wafting up from the pit below.
6390384,David Anderson,2020-01-28 11:25:00,2073,"Well stated. Things are changing. The 40 year old guy who takes a vacation but is expected to have contact via his e-mail for work is a reality. With readily and reliable satellite internet, many outpost camp owners don't realize people will pay for that service.....just look at the airlines, this is a profit center. I can't imagine even if an outpost is $1500 that and extra $100 for 4 guys isn't going to be a deal breaker. And flush toilets are pretty darn nice!"
6390416,bthomas3333,2020-01-28 13:04:00,465,"Sorry guys. I know WiFi at outposts is sort of a sensitive topic. In a perfect world I wouldnt want it either. Everyone has their heads stuck in their phones enough, but it my cases I try to take 3 or 4 10 day trips during the summer. The wifi lets me keep my business running. Without wifi I can probably only be gone once. I'm sure a lot of owners agree with you guys and many will never offer wifi.Brett"
