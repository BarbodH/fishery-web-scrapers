The guides were super fun guys. REALLY expensive, but if you have the means I highly recommend it. Let me know if you have any specific questions and i'll try and answer."
6399134,spoonchucker,2020-02-24 11:15:00,82,Thanks- but the Trophy Lodge you went to is the Plummer's one and I am trying to find out about the one on the eastern arm of Great Slave. I know the one you went to is highly regarded and many $. I would love to fish there someday.
6400008,KSjim,2020-02-26 13:25:00,88,I can't help you with info. on that lodge but I have had the good fortune to fish at Plummer's Great Slave Lake Lodge twice and plan to return in 2021. Looking at Trophy's web site it looks very interesting but I would question the self guiding part of the trip. I have made 25 plus trips to NW Ontario/Manitoba over the years and have only used a guide a couple times but the Slave is a different beast.The Slave is a huge and conditions can change rapidly. Each trip I have made at some point the guide would say the wind is shifting around we need to get out of this area.Also in Ontario I use a fish finder primarily to check the water depth and temperature our guide at Plummer's had over $3000.00 in electronics. We would watch his screen and see the fish come up from the depths and attack our lure. Throw that in with the great shore lunches prepared everyday the guides at Plummer's have a lot to offer.At $3100.00 Canadian for the week the lodge looks like a very good value. If you are comfortable with the self guiding I would have to believe you would have a great trip. The Slave is a very special place. I would go their every year if I could justify the cost.
