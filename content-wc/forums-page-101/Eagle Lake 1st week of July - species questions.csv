This year I am bringing a bigger group of family who have never been fishing in Canada. We are staying on the west arm of Eagle. I want it to be fun for all. I have one teen who pretty much fish's bass. I have no idea where and how to fish bass on this lake. There is not the vegetation that we catch them on in Wisconsin. We caught one on a walleye hole last year but I would really appreciate any input on bait, depth, structures and areas for that time of the year. I also have several people who love to fish and eat perch. Are they even plentiful enough, where, what depths, etc. I did a search but didn't find any details. We will spend most of our time fishing for walleye so I don't want to spend a great deal of time trying to find these fish. Thanks"

6399010,prov1800,2020-02-24 05:36:00,5010,plenty of good fishing near stanleys.and plenty of bass both east and west of camp.should be good in early july as fish normslly will be transistioning to some deeper waters with water temps rising.you will be fishing very clear water in the west end of eagle lake.lots of humps all over and some good weed beds.big body of water.pretty safe boating as most rocks are marked.bass will going deeper that time if the year but west end is fairly deep with lake trout so bass will be close to shore on fast dropoffs.id say take a guide out for a day and get tge lay of the land.
6399128,walleyenewby,2020-02-24 11:03:00,36,Thanks prov1800. My son will appreciate the tips for bass. We likely will hire a guide. If anyone has any input on perch would be appreciated.
6399238,prov1800,2020-02-24 16:17:00,5010,Theres lots of places for perch also.You just have to know where and make the runs to the spots. Hard to describe where but few mikes west of camp is a bay called iowa bay with a huge weed beed right in the middle.definatly wirth your time in there.fairly big area.need to work it.
