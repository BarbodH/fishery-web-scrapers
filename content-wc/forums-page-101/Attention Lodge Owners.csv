Moderators, if this is against board protocol I understand if you delete the thread. My kids go to a Catholic high school and every year they hold a Gala Event to raise funds for special projects for school improvements and to help keep the cost of tuition down. There are silent auction items along with a Grand Auction at the end of the night for larger items like trips. Most years there are only one or two grand action items that involve hunting or fishing, and some years there are none. My wife and I are considering donating a trip, one that has not previously been done. First thought I had was a Canadian fishing trip. We would like to offer the winning bidder a guided American Plan. Our budget for this trip is about $2500. It could be for 2 or more people for 3 or more days. Drive-in, Boat-in and Fly-in are all options. If you are interested in helping me with this donation package please send me a PM. I am open to suggestions from those of you who would like to recommend camps that I could contact directly as well. Thanks"
