6399014,andreindy,2020-02-24 06:19:00,308,"Nails, absolutely no reluctance to share the name of the lake (Abamasagi) and there are great folks on here who have fished that lake and we have shared thoughts. My group does reasonably well, but I am always curious how a more experienced fisherman would rig or fish the same situations as I have never fished with one. That's all. Nothing more to it. My original query was simply wondering if there were local walleye clubs in SouthEastern Wisconsin so I could connect with others and learn first hand."
6396290,andreindy,2020-02-14 20:18:00,308,"I'm a once a year fisherman to Ontario (3x overall) and a 2-3 time a year fisherman overall. Are there any Ontario fisherman in SE Wisconsin or Central Wisconsin I could connect with that might be willing to spend a day out on the water with them so I can hear their stories, share mine, and I can ask them what might seem like basic questions and can teach a newcomer a few things? I lead a band of novice fisherman and I would love to learn from someone more seasoned before our annual July trip. I will cover gas, bait, lunch, drink, etc, etc, etc. ! I am at a place in life where I can take a day off from work when I need a day off from work. I have always appreciated the WalleyeCentral group. Looking to connect more and learn from others who think about Ontario almost every single day. Not sure if there is a Walleye Club in Wisconsin?"
6396360,tolsen,2020-02-15 06:44:00,126,"Not in WI, but NE and have been going to the Minaki, ON area for 20 years and my dad has been going for 40+ what type of information are you looking for. I love sharing fishing knowledge, tips, and tricks. What parts of Ontario is I may ask and what fish species? Just walleye? What time of you are you fishing generally? What are the water temps?"
6396472,Walleye2242,2020-02-15 14:26:00,263,I am in madison area. My summers are very flexible!!! I have a cabin back in Illinois to fish. Been going to Canada for 30 plus years now.
6396530,andreindy,2020-02-15 19:54:00,308,"I appreciate the replies! Like most people, I am learning as I go, but never had the opportunity really of fishing with someone with more experience in a very long while. Thinking if someone would ever be willing to bring me on board for a day of fishing and wouldn't mind me learning. I could see how they control their boat for drifts, some back trolling wisdom, boat positioning for vertical jigging, using the locator, jigging techniques and how they keep in contact with bottom and learned their feel. I would benefit greatly from some hands on experience so I can more effectively teach the gang this year on our fly-in to Canada. Strange request, I know. Don't have much to offer in return except reasonable company (wife may argue this)."
6396580,RichA$1970,2020-02-16 05:26:00,1159,"Donâ€™t sell yourself short as it is trial and error. Diversity in your tackle with your boat partner, approach and luck will help. What lake are you fishing as the size and structure can help as I would go on google earth to look at structure, inlets, flows n islands. I am in central IL n counting the days until we head north."
6396640,kettyspanky,2020-02-16 09:09:00,271,Andreindy I sent you a pm.
6396916,andreindy,2020-02-17 05:46:00,308,"I see some PMs came my way. Brother-in-law stopped over yesterday (one of the members of the group). To my wife's and his wife's annoyance, all he wanted to talk about was Canada."
6398466,Hwy 101,2020-02-21 22:59:00,33,"What lake are you fishing? There are very few lakes that haven't been fished by the WC crowd. I posted my destination a while back and 5 years later still get yearly updates from a couple other groups that fish out of the same lodge at different times of the season. There is also a book written by a frequent WC contributor called Fishing Canadian Shield Lakes. Hard to get a copy, but it really shortens the learning curve. Try to get everyone in the group to buy a good walleye jigging rod. Some people will argue the point, but I think giving an inexperienced fisherman the proper rod/reel/line combination gives them the ability to easily learn the basics of jig fishing. just my 2 cents"
6398936,andreindy,2020-02-23 20:02:00,308,"Great points. I think I am looking less for specifics on the actual lake and more about how to best execute techniques, beginning with plain old jigging. I would be so interested in seeing how someone with more experience fishes and how they maximize sensitivity and jig control."
6399000,NailsWI,2020-02-24 05:14:00,898,"Why are you so reluctant to give up the name of the lake, the fellas here are trying to help you out. On most Canadian lakes, catching fish isn't that difficult. My dad is living proof of that. 60 year rod fiberglass rod with the sensitivity of a cooked spaghetti noodle and some of the most God awful looking rigs you could imagine. Location is the key, if your not fishing where the fish are you're gonna strike out."
