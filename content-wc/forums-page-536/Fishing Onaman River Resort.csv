1204304,shoreline49,2010-05-26 18:30:00,1,I would recommend fly-in over Onaman Resort.The reasons are as follows:-- Very Steep and rough hill to boat ramp. You must have 4 x 4 truck and even that is difficult to use here.-- A long way on the river to get to Lake Nipigon to fish for Lakers-- Accommodations were poor: mattresses were very thin and power supply was not continuously on.-- We were booked in for a week and ended up leaving after 2 nights to stay for the week at a Beardmore Motel.
1204360,dcraven,2010-05-26 20:41:00,47,"I have flown in and fished all over Ontario, Manitoba, NWT, Yukon, the Great Lakes and Alaska. I have never experienced better fishing for walleyes than at ORR. The cabins were clean. I brought my 8 year old son and wife there with another father/son. The guy that went with us has fished Lac Seul, LOTW, Savant and many other places in Canada over a 40 year period. The cabins, though somewhat rustic, were clean enough for my wife and she is PICKY. They have done improvements even since we were there in July. There are many places we have not returned to just for this reason. I would bring my own boat, if you own one - that is the only stipulation I would change next time I go. Even though the road is rough and long on the way in, once you leave the tarred hwy, bringing your own rig would be beneficial.The boats they have cached in Onaman Lake are very good. Yep, the ride out to Nipigon is about a 15 minute ride but here where I fish on Leech Lake, a 15 minute ride is nothing. Plus - we NEVER fished out of a boat for the evening bite. We walked down to the access and caught walleyes, for five nights straight, on darn near every cast - seriously. My buddy and his son launched their boat and fished 100 yards downstream simply because they wanted to fish out of their boat. Most evenings I hardly got to fish because my 8 year old was catching fish on most casts - thus I was unhooking - only on twister tails and no bait. Rediculous fishing! On the last night the walleyes didn't bite as good as the previous five nights - that was our slowest fishing of the trip. And this was our first trip there.Northwind lake was 200 fish per fishing session - if not 300. If a three in a boat fished the whole day you would become jaded. You may catch 400 or more fish. We caught fish to 10 lbs/30 inches on NWind. We caught fish to 9lb/29 inches on Onaman. Most fish were 3 to 6 lbs on Onaman.Nipigon is scary-big. It would be wise to have a marine band radio and fish with another boat - just in case of motor trouble, hitting a reef, whatever. This has to be the best drive-to lake trout water in the world. Forty pounders are not uncommon. Thirty plus pounders are common. I would not say it is a ""numbers"" lake. The brookies are out in the lake and unbelievable 3 to 8 lbs. We hired Robert's dad, Wilf, for a day and caught five brookies over 4 lbs and up to 6.5, whitefish to ten pounds and six northern pike, three of which were over 42 and up to 45 inches.It is 38 bucks per person per night because of the remoteness. It is not the Raddison or Hotel Sofitel. It is an old POW camp during WWII. We saw wolves, bear, moose and woodland caribou. If you don't mind cooking for yourself and trying new lakes, once you find the fish the fishing is as good as I've ever seen, anywhere..."

Good fishing Pikeman"
