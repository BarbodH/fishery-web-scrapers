1204859,Dave Q,2010-05-28 07:25:00,1003,this time tomorrow I will be living it. for 8 days............yeeehaa
1205384,oldblue2008,2010-05-30 11:00:00,313,"just curious as to how deep the trout are when you are chumming out on Athapap?? one of our locals has a cabin on Athapap, and chums for them, but have never had a chance to ask him"
1205390,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-30 11:43:00,803,"depends on the time of year, yesterday I was in 30 feet of water, surface temp was around 50 ish. In July and August I will jig anywhere from 70-120 feet, depeding on where the fish are. It is impossible to fish for lakers without sonar, well, not impossible, but very difficult and shooting blind."
1203878,Gibson,2010-05-25 14:06:00,17,"We catch our sucker in the spring and cut them up for bait and chum. Watch your sonar, they sink straight to the bottom and ocassionally you will see trout coming up from the bottom to intercept the chum. On Athapap. go for McKenzie Point on the big lake. We leave from the govt. launch at Bakers and go through Mink narrows. If you have not run this course before it would be advisable to go with someone who knows the lake. There are marked reefs and UNMARKED reefs. It IS legal to chum in Manitoba. The lodges will help you out as to directions and possible guide assistance. If interested, I could pm the number of a fellow who guides when his schedule is open. He has lived in Flin Flon his entire life and knows the lake well.As a later post implied, if we do not have any action within an hour, we move. That lake can turn nasty with rollers real quick. A decent sized boat, captain, floaters, etc. you know the routine......"
1203929,dcraven,2010-05-25 16:25:00,47,"This concept of ""perch taps"" is interesting... My parents brought me to Neulitin Lake in 1986, as a college graduation present. We only had about a square mile of open water to fish on in the middle of June due to late ice out at the furthest north out-camp (Windy River). Trout were hard to come by until I caught one and it had two three pound suckers coming out of its gullet. I pulled them out prior to releasing the trout. We stripped the suckers out and put sucker strips onto, of all things, muskie sized spinnerbaits and bucktails, such as the giant eagle tail. The traditional spoons must have wagged around too much for their liking at that time. Anyway, as we would troll the spinnerbaits or bucktails we would have what felt like perch taps and an occasional, soft tug or hold. On the hold, we would set the hook and be hooked to trout from 40 to 45 inches in length. If the tapping continued with no tug/hold we would reel in to find they had stripped the meat off the skin - all that would be left was the three to four inch strip of skin. Crazy picky for Canadian, virgin trout. Thus I found the ""perch"" comments interesting and consistent with what we found in the NW Territories."
1204095,Smeds,2010-05-26 07:32:00,103,"Interesting thread ... what we have done to get chum down where you need it is take a 1 lb. metal coffee can and by using an old-fashioned can-opener cut multiple triangle shaped holes in the bottom (which will be the top). Poke a hole on both sides of the can near the bottom, and run a piece of wire through leaving enough extra to make a ""handle"". Take the plastic lid, and cut a few slits around the edge to enable the lid to still stay on, but to pop off easily with pressure. Poke a hole in the lid close to the edge, and another through the can near the top. Use a loop of wire to attach the lid to the can when open. OK, hopefully you can follow those directions. What we have is a ""chum-can"". Load it up with whatever cut-bait you want, hook it to a stout rod via the wire handle (lid facing down, holes in bottom facing up remember), and slowly lower it to the bottom. After touching down, lift up a foot and then give a good rip ... the holes allow the water to flow through and pop the lid off. Works great in areas of deep water with current ... if you just throw bait over the side it will be 1/4 mile away in strong current! A Lake Superior ""Bobbing"" trick ... try it, it works!"
1204115,Guest,2010-05-26 08:40:00,0,"So are these techniques legal in Ontario? I'm headed to a lake trout lake in August, and have never fished for them before. thx!"
1204144,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-26 10:31:00,14,"Dave Q The bays we fish early spring are to shallow to hold pike in July, a sure spot out of Bakers is a cabage bed located on the east side of the large island in the middle of north bay(just to the west of wright bay)its a good size bed so start on the deep edge and work your way in towards the reed line. I use a mepps black fury,be very surprised if you don't hook up with a few in the 40"" class and numerous 8-10 pounders.could try the bay to the south out of Bakers(Pickeral over wintering bay) large bay with some deeper water in it,lots of weeds use white spinner baits,also try back end of schieders bay,good luck hope you catch a bunch."
1204154,JayM5209,2010-05-26 10:50:00,1050,"You won't find info re: chumming, but there is lots of excellent information on laker fishing in the fishing tips pages of the Vermilion Bay Lodge web site. It's organized by time of season. You'll find it at http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/V-Bay Gord, if you happen to read this.....what are the trout doing? Heading for deeper water already? I'm heading north Friday in anticipation of some trolling on Cliff and Aerobus next week. Thanks for a status report on the trout."
1204710,Thor29,2010-05-27 18:24:00,36,"We chum all the time when fishng for lakers. Fish Athap all he time and anchor, chum and let your bait sit on the bottom and hold on. This presentation will catch you numbers and is also the best way to latch onto to a lunker. The begining of June the lakers are still up so they can be caught by trolling spoons but you probly won't get anything big (20+ pounds) if you want a trophy, anchor and jig. we use sucker belly as bait which you can buy most places around here. head out towards Mackenize point on big Athap and you'll find everyone."
1204788,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-27 21:51:00,803,"Athapap is my home lake, and the method described by Thor and Dave and right on. I let my jig sit on the bottom with a tight line, not hanging, cause they won't touch it if it is, right o the bottom with just the slightest bend in my rod. When I see a change, anything at all, I hit it hard, often there is a trout at the other end. I don't fish this way on other laker lakes, on 2nd Cranberry, Reed, Kississing, Clearwater, I tend to lean to more aggressive approaches, rip jigging, trolling etc. It seems that the most consistent technique on the ""Pap"" is to chum and jig. You need an anchor though. I have done well on these other water with the jig and chum, but do just as well with more aggression too, which is more satisfying."
1204809,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-28 02:15:00,14,"Going to defiantly give this a try. Will have to pick my day very carefully to get out to Mackenzie point, lots of big open water to cross coming out of Cranberry."
1204850,v-bay gord,2010-05-28 07:03:00,3168,"Jay........we have had some very nice trout caught this week on Williams & Sutton spoons (3 way swivels) in 30 to 40 feet of water (either depth or suspended). On a portage lake we were still able to catch trout in 20-30 feet trolling with Hot N Tot's ......long lined. I'm not familiar with the fishing on the lakes you mention but either of these methods would be a good starting point. Your electronics will guide you as far as how deep these fish are. Some cloudy, rainy weather predicted for the first few days this weekend which may allow these fish to roam a little shallower..check it out. Good luck! V-Bay Gord"
1203690,Outfitter17,2010-05-24 22:25:00,127,"Don't bring any smelt up here, as mentioned it's not legal in ontario and I would guess most of canada."
1203692,Stu,2010-05-24 23:01:00,472,"Ok, I'm a little confused here. How do you get the chum to the bottom in 100 ft. of water?"
1203702,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-25 04:50:00,14,"The smelt I was going to bring with me are cleaned bagged and frozen, they were left over from a FOP benefit fish fry. Will research to make sure all is legal before I bring them with me."
1203737,Bill Krejca,2010-05-25 07:34:00,6107,"Re: using fish parts for chumming. Without digging into the latest specific game laws booklets, it has seemed that Ontario's laws are somewhat more restrictive than Manitoba or Sask. as to what can be used for bait. Whether chumming is considered ""bait"" may be a decision made by your official ""visitor"" on the lake. Littering is also a possible offense. In the interest of protecting one's wallet's contents and the maintenance of a low blood pressure, it might be a great idea to further research this. Additional input would be interesting. Bill Krejca"
1203741,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-25 07:48:00,14,"The time I saw this done the chum was cut up and dropped over the side of the boat, it would slowly sink to the bottom. We were in 90 feet of water and that boat probably caught over 50 trout and by no means were these small fish."
1203742,Dave Q,2010-05-25 07:52:00,1003,"Hi I'm in Sask, we go to athapap every spring for 10yr's+...leaving this Fri. for a week. We fish 90% for laker's. Anchor and stay put, this can be tough if your not getting bit, but stay for at least an hr after/during chumming. Re chumming it IS legal in Manitoba BUT you can only use some things. I have no idea re your smelt. We use sucker. Most(all) locals use sucker. We have it cut into sml. pieces and toss it all around us, if its NOT frozen it will sink, you can see it on the sonar( many times you can see trout swimming and eating the chum as it sinks...way cool) with a strip of belly on the jig. The don't move it / perch hit is right on!"
1203755,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-25 08:31:00,14,"Dave Q Looks like I will be up the week after you,we stay across the road on 1st cranberry but go on Atapap at least 2 or 3 times during our stay. Fish for monster pike in bays along north shore,mainly a bay referred to as (goose farm and a bay a couple miles past brownie bay towards tin can narrows) generally how deep of water do you usually set up in at this time of year"
1203791,Dave Q,2010-05-25 10:05:00,1003,"Hi could you tell me more about bays you refer to, please, location? (I know tin can) I will be going up a second time(1st week July) with my girlfriend and want to put her on #s of pike. We will launch out of paradice(sp) or baker's narrows prov. park. Re: your question, It is honestly hard to give good advice about were to anchor, but I will tell you what we have learned. 40' to 100'. We like 70's and 80's but last yr(cold spring) we did best under 50ft. Look for drop offs, try the top, or bottom of the slope. Look for fish!!, note the depth they are at before you anchor. If you are on fish but they wont bite lots of days its a waiting game, they will turn on. Once we pick a spot we stay for an hr. min. Some days ALL day(8hrs) in the same spot. Chumming helps. The post re not moving your jig and setting on the lightest little tap is right on. Some days reeling up with a 4"" rubber tail and belly is good. Hope this might help a bit."
1203871,Stu,2010-05-25 13:52:00,472,Looks like I'm gonna need a WHOLE lot of anchor line!
1203877,Bill Krejca,2010-05-25 14:04:00,6107,"I've had good luck on trout by anchoring in relatively shallow water, maybe10-20 ft deep, and casting the bait into the deeper water. I've used 2 anchors- one in front, the other in back, to keep the boat in place. Just have to be able to find the right location for the shallow spot to be in position for the cast to the deep. Bill Krejca"
1203468,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-24 10:53:00,14,"Would love to try for some large lakers this year, with the way the weather is this year I'm sure they will be in deeper water than I'm used to fishing for them,when chumming should you try and anchor or just throw out a marker buoy and use the electric motor to stay in the general area,also what type of presentation is best when chumming."
1203509,dcraven,2010-05-24 13:17:00,47,Is chumming legal where you are heading?DC
1203532,Gibson,2010-05-24 14:21:00,17,"I've caught bigger Lakers chumming for them. I definitely anchor and make sure to throw the chum far enough around the boat to compensate for any wind variation. The lake we fish is over 100 feet in our spot. At that depth I use 3/4 or 1 ounce jig tipped with sucker, using sucker for chum as well. Whitefish works well too.Since the chum sits motionless I keep my jig on bottom and seldom move it. Most hits resemble a Perch tap and set the hook as soon as you see that tap. Good luck......"
1203582,v-bay gord,2010-05-24 17:15:00,3168,Now that's a technique I've not heard of before.
1203598,Outfitter17,2010-05-24 18:25:00,127,You guys are just kidding right?
1203622,dcraven,2010-05-24 19:21:00,47,I don't think there is any kidding going on here... That's why I asked my previous question regarding as to whether or not this is legal. My guess is that this is illegal pretty much everywhere except for South America.
1203630,Walleye_Wrangler,2010-05-24 19:37:00,138,People chum all over the US for trout and carp. Others use chum bags for perch and bluegill. Not sure of the law in every state but it's legal in some. Several view it as littering. We use to chum corn for rainbows when I was a kid.
1203644,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-24 20:06:00,14,"The only time I have seen this done was on Clearwater lake ThePas Manitoba, a boat that was fishing in the same area we were caught trout as fast as they could get baits back down to them, they said once you get them going its like fishing in a barrel. I'll be up on Athapap in 2 weeks and thought I would give it a try. Bringing up a bunch of frozen smelt to use as chum."
1203653,dcraven,2010-05-24 20:29:00,47,"There is no doubt that it works for smaller trout and panfish - a feeding frenzy, of sorts, is created. I checked the Manitoba rules/regs and see nothing to make it illegal other than it makes a quote about ""gimmicks and other techniques are usually considered illegal"" - but I see nothing that specifically makes it illegal. And that is only in a quick, five minutes can of the rules. Trout are especially suseptible to this technique, as I have been told by several folks who used to do this for rainbows in stocked lakes, here, in Minnesota. They frequently used a can of corn and would simply cut a stomach open and get the corn back when more bait was needed (on a kept fish). Barely another kernal would fit in the stomach, they said. I thought this was made illegal for gamefish (I'm very aware that this technique is used extensively for carp) across much of north america, but I guess I'm wrong."
1203658,bodon,2010-05-24 20:36:00,2,It's not wise to use smelt for chum. Too many lakes in Canada have had smelt establish a population due to milt and eggs being mixed together and frozen. These fertilized eggs that get stuck to the smelt can hatch and start a new species into a lake. This practice is illegal in Ontario and is likely illegal elsewhere in Canada. bodon
