1205913,Bigfishhunter,2010-06-01 12:39:00,803,"Cranberry Portage is a great place to fish from. YOu have access to Flin Flon and lakes around there 20 min. to the north. Snow Lake is about 40 min. to the south then eastish. Here you will find some great lakes like Reed, Iskwasum, Tramping and Wekusko. Then for a fun day trip head to the Pas to fish Clearwater, Cormorant, Bradley, Barbe, etc. Great location to spend a week to a month to a lifetime fishing from."

1204705,Thor29,2010-05-27 18:11:00,36,"The weather has not been very nice since opening, but last weekend was on Athap and caught afew lakers. Walleyes are biting on the Cranberries as well as Athap,heard of quite a few around the 30 "" range. A 29 was caught off shore at Bakers Narrows so starting to pick up. The river to Simonhouse seems to be a good spot right now, have not heard anything on Elbow."
1204707,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-27 18:18:00,803,"I live in Flin Flon, check out my reports on our local board.http://xtremesportfishing.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1 Athapap is good, pike are on, and trout are still catchable in semi shallow water. Eyes are perfect right now, ravenous in fact, so 3rd and elbow should be a hoot. Good luck, I love fishing the Cranberries, my wife is the Public Health Nurse in Cranberry so many days in the summer I take her to work towing the boat, go fishing for the day then pick her up and take her out for the evening."
1204808,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-28 02:05:00,14,"Thanks for the report, 6 more midnight turns and a 24 hour drive and I'll be knocking on heavens door. Will be in a 16' olive green star craft with a 50 Yamaha tiller if you see me stop by and I'll buy ya a cold one. You guys ever go in to Arthropod for some of those high flying rainbows and brookies, also love Goose river for some early morning brooks."
1204810,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-28 02:53:00,14,"Big fish, thanks for xtreme link, great reading one more question whats up with the orange buoy technique have often wondered about that."
1204811,MONSTERQUEST,2010-05-28 03:58:00,14,"Big fish, red old post about Goose and Egg lakes. Actually fished Egg about 6 years ago, was in the fall and we were pike fishing caught a few but wasn't greatest weather for jack fishing,local I was with spoke very highly of this lake for master pike.Last few times I have checked was a locked gate across road leading in to lake so could not access it."
1205058,Thor29,2010-05-28 19:11:00,36,"the orange bouys ae attached to our anchor lines. it runs through a gripper so when your fishing in 100 or more feet of water all you do is slowly drive away and it lifts your anchor off the bottom. once it hits the surface the bouy goes under water,the gripper hold the line,and you stop and pull in your line. this way you don't have to lift the anchor all the way from the bottom. works real slick. the bouy holds the weight of the anchor so its easy to pull."
1205063,Thor29,2010-05-28 19:15:00,36,"from Cranberry your about 1/2 hour from Barbe. if your after rainbows its the place to go. also if you can catch them, monster brookies in there as well."
1205328,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-30 07:04:00,803,"Yep, Thor29 is right on, orange buoys are an anchor lift so you aren't hauling your anchor 100' over and over again in a day. If you are in for a day of trout fishing, it is wise to move often to get on top of where they are, I have moved up to 7 times in a day, so hauling a 20 or 28 lb anchor gets old after a while, and you need your hand strength and arm muscles for fighting 30 lb trout, not heavy metal."
1205329,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-30 07:08:00,803,"Hey there MonterQuest, I was going to send you a pm, but it says that you don't want them. I was just going to send you some info on some locations. Can you send me a pm with your email and I can email you?"
