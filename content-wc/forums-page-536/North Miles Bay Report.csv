1204519,alanb,2010-05-27 11:02:00,56,"Just got back late last night from an excellent trip. We were fishing from the evening of 5/20 through 5/25 and except for Monday 5/24 (rain and thunderstorms all day) the fishing was fantastic! I would have never thought I'd be fishing in a T-shirt, shorts and flip flops almost every day at this time of year. The group I go with has been doing either the opener or the weekend following the opener for over 20 years (with over 30 years for a yearly trip) and they agreed this was the best fishing ever for them. Lots of walleyes in the 20""+ range, with several 24"" and a 25"" walleye. I got my largest walleye ever this year (24""). Trolling with black/silver and blue/silver Hot N Tots in 10' to 15' of water were highly productive. Most hit the lures very hard. My wife's cousin is a huge Husky Jerk fan and had never used a Hot N Tot before. I loaned him a blue/silver 09 size and his first troll within a few minutes got him a 23"" walleye. The really small ones to eating size were to be found in the expected areas, but the big ones were found on the bottom (13' average) in calmer water areas behind a break or island that had a lot of current and wave action. Jigging with chartouse/orange with a minnow, piece of crawler or plastic twister tail was very successful early on in the trip. I'd start with a minnow, then switch to the twister tail and the activity of the bite wouldn't change. Lots of smallmouth bass were to be found in with the walleye, most were big fighters in the 2 pound range. Not as many Northerns as last year, but much bigger ones were found - lots in the slot that had to be put back. The largest Northerns caught were a 37"" and a 35"". Tons of taildancing from both of these species. Bottom line - great fishing, you were bound to catch something if you had a line in the water. And the 2""+ plus of rain on 5/24 should help bring up the lake about 6"" when it all drains in. The water was down 3 feet from last year! Don't know how many will get this info before the US Memorial Day weekend, but everyone up there expect this weekend to continue with the excellent fishing. Have fun and look forward to everyone's stories. Alanb"

1204702,Obabikon,2010-05-27 18:02:00,2370,Well... I know he did catch quite a few crappies off our dock! lol...
1204846,Bill Krejca,2010-05-28 06:48:00,6107,"Oh yeah Jared, that's right, I forgot, that was Alan. Bill Krejca"
1204879,alanb,2010-05-28 08:37:00,56,"Bill - We were not targeting crappie, but in one of the short windows between the rain on Monday we did get a few out in front of Bottleneck Bay jigging on the spot everyone targets. Good sized, but nothing like I was pulling in off the dock at Obabikon Bay Camp. Rockpt- That cabin is in the in-law's family. When do you make your trip to LOTW? Do you stay with Jared or over at Miles Bay Camp? Alanb"

1205576,1shooter,2010-05-31 09:20:00,1493,Good report......hopefully they will still be biting 2 weeks from now when we are there.
1205698,W.W.,2010-05-31 18:53:00,245,"I've been going up to Miles Bay area for more years than I want to admit (guess I'm not getting any younger.....).Always go for 2 weeks starting the week end after the 4th of July.Perch and walleye are usually very good.My personnal best walleye is over 30 inch, but haven't been able to break into the 50 inch class muskys yet. 48 1/2 to 49 inch has always stopped me. Sometimes I can get the crappie patterned but usually they are ?I invited my nephew to go along (I'll pay his way) as a college graduation present for summer of 2011; invited my two brother-in-laws to go along also. They get to pay for themselves! Hope I can stand them for that long. Guess I'll just have to keep trying on that 50 inch 'ski. (Maybe I can try trolling one of the brother-in-laws as bait.)See ya' all there.W.W. in Iowa"
