1205365,5richards,2010-05-30 09:28:00,131,I am heading to Little Vermilion in a few weeks and I wanted to try and preserve some minnows for the trip. After reading most of the previous posts I decided to use a mixture of salt and borax and give it a whirl! I applied the mix and layered the minnows in a styrofoam cooler and allowed it to sit covered in my basement for two days -- Curiosity got the better of me and I pulled them out and they were stiff and leathery -- when I added a little water they seemed perfect! They will surely stay on a hook and be durable. I froze them in batches of 24 in plastic resealable bags. I pulled one bag out 4 days later and they didn't change a bit --- Thanks for the valuable resource WALLEYE CENTRAL!
