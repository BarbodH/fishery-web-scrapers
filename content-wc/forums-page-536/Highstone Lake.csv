1206177,Guest,2010-06-02 06:12:00,0,Anybody out there know anything about Highstone Lake? The lake (Hooker Lake) I have 30 years of experince fishing is no longer available. The outfitter is Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout and they are offering a great rate at Highstone Lake but the lake I have been going to is a sure thing and that is what I want out of new lake. Any info on Highstone Lake would be greatly appreciated.

Hidden Bay took very good care of us. My wife was 7 months pregnant at the time and they made a couple of extra flyovers just to check on us. The lake had another fly-in cabin on it and I found another group camping on the lake, they came up a river to reach the lake - so it wasn't as remote as I was hoping it would be. We all caught fish, They were not hard to find but very consistent in size. There were no negatives about the lake/cabin and I was there twice. I seem to remember a post from a couple of years ago that had some info on this lake, you might try searching for it."
