1205820,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-01 08:07:00,151,WTF! The answer was right under my nose. It's no wonder I can't tie as many fishing knots anymore...
1205821,Freytown,2010-06-01 08:09:00,770,Pray for lots of rain.....soon.
1205822,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-01 08:12:00,151,"I see you're going up 6/12. Hopefully, they'll have mucho inches of rain by then. We're leaving on 07/01, heading North of Matagami. It would be great to hear how your trip went. I've been up in these fires (smoke) before fishing. Best."

1202294,Freytown,2010-05-20 11:24:00,770,Gouin (Zone 14) season starts tomorrow 5/21/10. Where are you heading?http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/p...es/zone-14.asp

1202565,Freytown,2010-05-21 08:48:00,770,Good luck next week...post a report when you get back. I have fished Mattawa many times & usually had a good time. Where the Flapjack enters the baie is a good location in the spring. This area is off limits until June 1st...my bad.
1202778,a3dad,2010-05-22 06:04:00,115,Good luck Rich. Let us know how you make out. -Kevin
1202816,Vinniethe cat,2010-05-22 08:38:00,1,"Hi there.Just saw the Gouin thread. I'm flying in to Ottawa from England on the 24th, then driving to the Gouin for the 31st for a week with some Canadian buddies.Did it at the same time last year, staying at a cabin belonging to Camp Martin.Awesome place, caught a lot of Northerns, lost a few big ones, by the feel.Looking forward to it....."
1205648,Freytown,2010-05-31 14:30:00,770,I thought we would have a few Gouin reports by now. How has everyone been doing? I will be up 6/12 and hopefully have a good report & pic's to post.
1205701,Kman67rsss,2010-05-31 19:00:00,30,We are headed up 4th of july. Talked to the outfitter the other day and the lake is low. 3-4 feet lower then usual. Now there are major fires in the area. Im in NH and we have been getting the smoke from the fires yesterday and today.
1205811,Freytown,2010-06-01 07:24:00,770,"http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/...062/story.htmlI hope this region gets some rain to help put out these fires. This link provides some info on the fires location. ""The Quebec government has barred access to the fire zones in a vast territory of 8,000 square kilometres between Roberval, in the Lac St. Jean region, and Parent, in the Mauricie, all the way up to the Gouin reservoir, about 150 kilometres west of Lac St. Jean."""
1205817,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-01 08:03:00,151,I can't confirm this and I've been to SOPFEU. Who/what/where is your source. Thanks.
