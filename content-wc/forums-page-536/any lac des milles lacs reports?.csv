Several threads discussing LDML this spring. Here's one:http://fishingboard.thunderbayfishin...showtopic=7856 Cheers, NWO Fishing Bum"
1205150,Guest,2010-05-29 08:32:00,0,i fished lac the first 2 weekends. the first weekend the fish were in 15-17 feet in the pine point area and it was slow in sawmill bay. last weekend was the exact opposite. we fished the deeper water with little to show. we then came back to sand point and they were literally jumping in the boat
