The wife and I usually just fish for perch on the river, but I'd like to see if I could fish for walleye one day. A local neighbor up there tells me the walleye have been scarce on the river in past years. Are there any lakes within a couple hours that I might find productive for walleye? Thanks!"

Phenominal fishing,walleye(better in the fall but still great anytime),perch,and smallies. Have a great trip. Alot of info on both places on this site, plus links to many more. Fosterthedog"

Bay of Quinte is also too much for a day, but thanks for the response. I was wondering if there might something along the Rideau canal route."
