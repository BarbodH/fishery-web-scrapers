1206747,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-03 19:03:00,151,I don't want to get off thread but I talked to a friend of mine today and he said Lac Evans (North of the Gouin) is down 4'.
1203425,tpr39,2010-05-24 09:21:00,13,McQ do you mean a 14# walleye?!!! Oh my. Are there pictures? Was it released?
1203467,Freytown,2010-05-24 10:52:00,770,Isn't a sumo an invasive fish from the far east?
1205794,a3dad,2010-06-01 06:26:00,115,Any updates anyone? McQ? Leaving Sunday. Can't wait.
1206515,a3dad,2010-06-03 06:12:00,115,"Spoke to Jean (Air Tamarac) yesterday. He said the water level is down 6 feet (from full). He was saying it's a good level, but I'm not so sure..."
1206516,Freytown,2010-06-03 06:16:00,770,"Hi,What did he say about the fires? Where are you going?"
1206521,a3dad,2010-06-03 06:20:00,115,"I posted in the ""fire"" thread about the fires. I'm going to Gouin Plamondon Bay starting Sunday for 5 days with Air Tamarac. Flying out of their base camp in Clova. Kevin"
1206522,Freytown,2010-06-03 06:23:00,770,"Thxs, I just seen your post about the fires. The six feet drop in water should help your fishing. Baie Plamondon is a very good area. Good luck."
1206528,a3dad,2010-06-03 06:49:00,115,"Been to Plamondon several times. I know it can be great. The low water levels help with Walleye bite, but I mainly target the large pike. I prefer the water to be up and catch them in the back of coves. But with the warm weather and the low level this year, looks like we'll be out on initial points and drop offs. It will be great anyway! Thanks for the luck!"
1206546,tshea,2010-06-03 07:28:00,36,"I was in mattawa bay, May 21st - water was down 6' from high water mark and hotter than **** - 80+ degrees"
1206552,Freytown,2010-06-03 07:44:00,770,How was the fishing that week?
1197635,McQ,2010-05-07 08:19:00,615,Another week of sporadic rain has raised the water levels by about another foot. More snow and rain forecasted for the weekend and below freezing temps at night will add to the pool. The Nemio River where I am is a major spawning area and I'm looking forward to some great fishing from the 21st on.
1198169,tpr39,2010-05-08 15:27:00,13,The weather looks kind of nasty for the next few days. McQ do you ever fish for burbot? We've been targeting them for a number of years and love eating them (mock lobster). If you do fish for them would be interested how you go about it etc. Am I right that the Communal guys will sometimes remove the buoys before the actual opening of the rivers (6/1 this year) so the rivers can be fished early?
1198323,McQ,2010-05-09 07:32:00,615,"6"" of snow on the ground overnight, continuing through the day but 4 days of sunshine coming up - good for the water level. When it comes to burbot I catch them incidentaly while jigging walleye deep - so true, great eating and my method tis to cube the filet, soak overnight in milk and deep fry in cajun breading for breakfast - mmm good. I am not aware of the removal of spawning off limits signs early, in fact it's the main reason for enforcement early in the season. Posted areas are usually only off limits at the headwaters having no effect on downstream fishing."
1200410,McQ,2010-05-14 09:55:00,615,The levels are at my preferred height - more rain will spread the fish out more. The long range forecast calls for good temps and no precip - opener will be a barn burner fror sure. Good fishing everyone and have a great time on the Gouin.
1200652,tpr39,2010-05-15 11:04:00,13,McQ will look forward to your opening day report. Spoke with my outfitter earlier today and he also said the water is on the rise.
1203021,tpr39,2010-05-23 03:39:00,13,"McQ interested to hear how opening went, water levels and other topics of interest. Weather looks like it has been quite warm and the next couple of days may be near records. Might get the fish dispersing early this year?"
1203065,retire55,2010-05-23 08:04:00,1029,"McQ: While I realize you're living in paradise these days and that it's difficult to think of us who live vicariously on your information updates about Gouin water levels and the fishing, how about an update. We're dying here buddy."
1203174,McQ,2010-05-23 15:54:00,615,The postspawn bite is strong - mostly males averaging around a pound and a half. A 14 lb sumo was caught yesterday just outside the posted area. Created quite a stir. Personally I have been too busy to get out but expect to have the work caught up by wednesday which will allow an opportunity to try the river for myself. Jig and leech has been the bait of choice and some trolling by guests is also contributing to limit catches. The bear hunting the year is phenominal with all ther baits attracting multiple bears - the activity is keeping us all hopping. Unlike the last few years this years temps are abnormally high 85 degrees today and we will be in the ninties tomorrow- long range shows a return to more moderate temps for the weekend - no precip for the past two weeks so water levels are unchanged which suits me just fine.
1203367,Freytown,2010-05-24 06:04:00,770,"McQ,Thxs for the update. Now once you get out fishing I am sure we will get an updated fishing report. Keep the reports coming!"
1203369,a3dad,2010-05-24 06:08:00,115,"McQ, As always, we greatly appreciate the updates. I know the reservoir is full at 405m. Do you know what the current readings are? Also with the unseasonable warm weather how are the bugs? Have the black flies and mosquitoes come out early this year? I'll be up 2nd week of June. Looks like I'll be in a summer pattern if this keep up!!! thanks again, Kevin"
1191830,McQ,2010-04-21 08:42:00,615,"The ice on the Gouin is going out rapidly this year - most areas are ice free, back bays are slush covered. Water level is down five feet (from last years level) which is typical for this time of year - spring rains will raise it quickly, a perfect level increase would be 3'."
1191895,NYBowHunter,2010-04-21 12:24:00,35,Thanx for the info!! I was just thinking about PMing you yesterday about this as I see the temps have been in the high 40's low 50's there (daytime highs) for a couple of weeks. Set to go in June - can't wait!
1192702,tpr39,2010-04-24 07:59:00,13,McQ I have been in contact with one of the Administrators of the Gouin Communal Website who indicated at the beginning of the week that the Gouin is 1 foot shy of being completely full. He was going back to the Gouin on thursday this week and upon return was to provide water level and ice conditions. From satellite photos looks like ice is coming off about 7-10 days earlier than normal. Do you agree? Curious what your information sources are? Also where and when do you go to the Gouin. We fish at LeHibou last week of May. Going to the Gouin for the last 20+ years.thanks
1192719,a3dad,2010-04-24 08:46:00,115,"Thanks for the info guys. Watching with great interest. Where can we view current satellite images? thanks, KF"
1193132,McQ,2010-04-25 13:06:00,615,"tpr39 -- I'm at the Gouin right now. This is my 29th year. The last 5 years I've adopted the folks running Nemio which I much prefer to any other location up here. I'll be here through the end of June, back home for July and then returning for August. The remnants of the ice were out last week - level is -5' from last years high water mark, I'd like to see another 3' before opener."
1193560,tpr39,2010-04-26 15:19:00,13,"Hi McQ: Now I know why your information is so good. Here is the post from the Administrator of the Gouin Communal Website:""Ice In Some area is out as of saturday morning, the big lakes Brochu, Murre, Male etc. ... are still ice over. Still ice are over. Water level is about 1.5 meter below last fall and is expected to be normal, about a meter below full for the opening, weather (rain) permitting. Water level about 1.5 meters below IS last fall am and is Expected to Be Normal, about a meter below for the full opening, weather (rain) Permitting. As fo the study, still working on that As the study fo, Still working On That""I would love to hear more reports from you regarding weather conditions, fishing etc. We leave for LeHibou 5/27."
1194259,McQ,2010-04-28 10:42:00,615,Will do!!!!!
1194599,Freytown,2010-04-29 05:29:00,770,"McQ, thxs for the Gouin updates I will be up to Baie du Sud 6/12 for the 1st time. I am looking forward to fishing that section of the reservoir.I fished the spring of 2003 (Baie Poisson) when the water was down 20 feet. That was something to see. The fish were at a disadvantage that spring.Keep the updates coming."
1196060,tpr39,2010-05-03 06:27:00,13,"Hi McQ, am I correct that the spawning areas will be open for fishing on 5/29? Any news to report?thanks,"
1196288,McQ,2010-05-03 15:03:00,615,Here is the Ministry linkhttp://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/p...09_zone-14.pdf June 1st is the date Water is up about a foot over the past week with more rain in the forecast - everything should be all right for opening.
