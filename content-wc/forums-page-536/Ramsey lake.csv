1204708,TIGHTLINER,2010-05-27 18:21:00,223,Got back from ramsey lake late saturday. We enjoyed good fishing even though it was sunny warm no wind and no rain. We had a high pressure sitting right over us for the week. The northern pike were hitting just about anything you tossed at them however the walleyes were just not hitting like normal probably due to the weather and the lake being down about 2 ft or better. We marked lots of fish they just would not take anything. The new owners kim and justin are fantastic both young and very eager to help with whatever they can to make the stay as enjoyable as possible. All the foods were stocked in the pantry with many cans on the shelves. The meats were all frozen and there for the taking. I don't think anyone had trouble with any motors or leaky boats they keep up on the equipment all the time. The camp is very clean all cabins were as clean as you could ask for. Saw bears mink beaver eagles around the lake with no moose to be seen. The black flies were around but not in the mood to bite that is probably why we did not see the moose they were deep in the bush yet. I will be going back in 2011 the good lord willing. Been going since 1988 sometimes twice a year. If you are looking for a reasonable price place where the food is furnished and the camp is clean with good help look at rays camps on ramsey lake. Tightliner.
