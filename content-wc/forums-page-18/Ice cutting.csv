I am only relating what has been passed on to me in the late 1940's/1950's. I imagine a farmer's horse(s) were used. Coming from Morson, a trail was cut next to the Turtle Narrows, as it didn't freeze well enough to always use it, the trail is still identifiable, now used by snowmobilers. We used the ice at the camp for many years until a generator started providing power for a freezer/fridge. Progress! Bill"
6718987,Eckohlt,2023-03-02 08:21:00,3685,"I'm thinking in the near future ice cutting days will be over,as you say Progress is taking over.Cutting huge amounts of ice to store for the year gotta get old.Lots of booze involved in wrestling chunks of ice from what I've seen,haha."
6719119,ILScott,2023-03-02 17:52:00,139,"I will tell you this, that the ice out of Wine Lake made some great Gin and Tonics. The ice seemed to last longer and added to the remoteness. Scott"
6719169,Bill Krejca,2023-03-02 19:54:00,6107,Can't beat natural ice. Just the culture of the process makes it an unusual commodity! Bill
6719199,Eckohlt,2023-03-03 05:08:00,3685,"If you want shaved ice for a smoothie,use the auger works great!"
6716769,NM_Trout,2023-02-23 09:53:00,1094,"From a post on here about lake trout, I found myself on the home page for Wine Lake Camp. Great. Now I want to help with ice cutting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIz5Nqaw7BY&t=148s"
6716777,Eckohlt,2023-02-23 10:07:00,3685,"Call the owner up,tell'em your in on ice cutting,I'm sure the more help the merry'er,I've done it,it's not that much fun."
6716801,NM_Trout,2023-02-23 11:33:00,1094,I bet. Much like my desire to run a snowblower at night in a snowstorm. I bet that gets old quick.
6716803,Eckohlt,2023-02-23 11:37:00,3685,"Shoveling gets old also,just got done with about 14 inches,we got bomb in s.e mn"
6716849,ILScott,2023-02-23 15:09:00,139,They stopped cutting ice on Wine. During covid they turned the ice house into a cabin and it is a nice little cabin for 3 or 4 and great view of the lake.
6716861,Eckohlt,2023-02-23 16:28:00,3685,"The money they'll make off the cabin they can buy all the ice they want,fill a floatplane n have it delivered."
6717221,Bill Krejca,2023-02-24 18:37:00,6107,"Somewhere, I still have a pic of the old ice house at Turtle Portage Camp, LOW, and the ramp going down into the water, it was used to skid the ice chunks up into the ice house. Horse were used at one time for pulling. Bill"
6717223,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 18:58:00,3685,Did the resort owner own a horse?or where did the horse come from?
6717321,Richard B,2023-02-25 09:59:00,735,Manitou Weather Station still cuts ice from the lake and stores it for use in the summer. https://www.facebook.com/manitouweatherstation/
6717323,Eckohlt,2023-02-25 10:05:00,3685,"Looks like they had plenty of help,and most were watching the help do the work,that's a lot of ice cubes,thanks for sharing."
