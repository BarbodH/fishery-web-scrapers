6719009,Bigredmf,2023-03-02 09:34:00,129,I run an older Lowrance LMS527.Battery life can be an issue so when you start at 12 volts it will run out of juice in just a couple hours.After a ton of research I started using NATO issued 6 volt battery cases with 4 quality D cells. Three in series so I start at 18 volts. After over 24 hours of fishing I still maintained 11 volts and the finder and GPS still worked.The last time I posted this I got a little beat up about using non rechargeable batteries but this set up works well for me.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=572833YMMV
6719019,prov1800,2023-03-02 10:06:00,5010,So most fly in destinations I've ever gone to have a generator.In this case any type of battery can be charged.I have a hook 7 and last year I bought a lithium battery and it came with a charger.My hook 7 can run a couple of days on this battery and love it even if I can charge it daily.its in a old cabelas bag and I use it if iam guiding out of a camp boat.I also use it on my own boat and hook it up to my universal transducer on my terrova.i just leave it in the bag and run it from the battery.win win situation.
6720575,Phillypat,2023-03-06 14:03:00,12,"Some great advice here! Im thinking im actually gonna take my Lowrance hook 5 off my kayak and get a suction cup transducer mount! Ill have my friend, a contractor, build a clamp mount and use that for the display. Good recommendation on the Lithium battery too. I will likely pick one up!"
6717945,Phillypat,2023-02-27 10:57:00,12,"Hi, My group and I will be going to Little Gouin with Caesar's North Camps on June 24th. We hope to bring a deptfinder to get a better feel for the depth structure of the lake as well as looking for sunken humps and offshore structure. Maybe we will luck out and mark a few eyes. Oliver runs a 12 foot john boats with a 4.9 on the back. We would prefer a depthfinder that doesnt need a 12 volt battery and with an easy and removeable transducer mount. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks,"
6717965,Coho975,2023-02-27 11:55:00,323,I would recommend getting one that does need a 12 volt battery and then getting a small lithium for it. Mount transducer to small board and clamp to transom. Not sure your budget but there are tons of used Garmin 93sv's out there in the $350 range. Pretty decent units for that price.
6717973,adempsey2.0,2023-02-27 12:34:00,611,"I don't no for sure, but I have not seen a depth finder that uses anything but 12V batteries for a long while. You may have to look at the used market. That being said, the 12V lithium batteries don't weigh too much and are probably the best way to go. For the transducer mount, many people just use the suction cup without much issue. There are some pretty good magnetic mounts available now as well."
6717977,fishron,2023-02-27 12:40:00,317,"The one that I have used many times on fly-ins and tske with me as a back-up on my boat is the Lowrance X-4. Comes in a carry case, runs on 4 D batteries, I've never come close to running out of power on a week long trip. Nothing fancy but gives good definition. May be out of production but look around on E-bay type sites. Worked well for me on three trips to Hebert in Quebec. Ron"
6717989,brown1317,2023-02-27 13:27:00,74,I have a Humming bird that only pulls 750 mil amps. I made a simple transducer mount out of aluminum and an old c-clamp. I use a $7 tool box from Home depot to carry the li-battery in and mount the depth finder. Been using it for years.
6718043,Carnhzkr,2023-02-27 16:23:00,964,"I have 3 portables that I've used. Simple and easy are the Lowrance X-4, as mentioned earlier, and I also have a Humminbird 160, that's basically the same thing. Either of these can be had for less than $150 and I'm sure you could find a used one for way less than that. They're very basic, but they're decent for a fly-in. They will help you find reefs and edges and are great for depth, and so-so for marking fish. Either of these run on 8 D cell batteries (not 4 - D batteries are 1.5v so you'd need 8 to get to 12v) or you can use a 12v lead acid battery like you'd use for ice fishing. Those batteries run around $20. I've gotten about 3 days using either type of battery on these units (maybe you could push it to 4 days), so if I went this route, I'd bring at least 2 sets of batteries unless you had a way to charge a lead acid battery.The best one I have, though, is a Humminbird Helix 7 with a lithium battery. With the Canada Lake Master chip, these things are the bees knees. The new ones will even let you record detailed contour data so you can really find the spot on the spot. Not cheap though. They'd set you back about $700 plus another $150 for lithium battery and charger and another $100 for the map chip.If you're just looking for something simple & cheap to use once or twice. I'd recommend either of the units I mentioned in the first paragraph."
6718293,Mojo-NC,2023-02-28 09:29:00,1929,"This thread got me thinking about a couple of portable fishfinder units that I have and no longer use - they just take up space in my hunting/fishing storage cabinet. I used to bring one with me to Canada every year, but I have since upgraded to a combination sonar/GPS unit and I know I'll never use either of these again. I've been holding on to them just in case someone in my group needed one, but now they all have their own portable fishfinders. These units are both sonar only, and each have everything they need to operate except the battery (case, head unit, power cord, and transducer with suction cup mount). They are both the same model except one is color and the other is black and white. I'm pretty sure they both still work fine, and I just checked to make sure that each powered up properly. The head units fold down as shown for transportation and the battery and transducer both fit inside. One can run on 8 D-Cell batteries connected in series to provide the required 12V (see photo). Actually, they both can but only one has the converter to make it 12V. i've never used the converter because I've only used a single 12V SLA or lithium battery. I'm planning to go fishing tomorrow so if I go I will bring both units along with me and connect the transducers to confirm that they each work properly. If anyone wants one of these, PM me. We'll have to work out shipping costs though, and other than me confirming that they work when I check them tomorrow there would be no additional guarantee. I only ask that you request one because you need it, not because you want to turn around and sell it."

6718517,Stickman8474,2023-02-28 17:03:00,39,"I've used a real basic unit for multiple Canadian trips. A Garmin Stryker 4 (on sale for $99 at Bass Pro March 9th), and a 1x4x2"" cedar plank for transducer mount with a c clamp to secure to transom. Put the unit in a $5 lunch bag with cables & batteries. Lithium will be lighter, but less expensive lead cells work fine. Just remember you may need a small charger. A couple ty wraps and electrical staples complete the set. It's worth the weight believe me. Guaranteed to make you more effective and safer. Honestly, I feel it's a must have for fishing remote isolated water."
6718543,adempsey2.0,2023-02-28 18:46:00,611,"know not no...I had to fix that, it was annoying me lol. Is there a reason you do not want to go with a standard 12V lead acid AGM battery? Is it weight? or budget? no way to recharge it?"
