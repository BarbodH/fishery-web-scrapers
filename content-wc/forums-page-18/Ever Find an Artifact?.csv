6719031,prov1800,2023-03-02 10:37:00,5010,Havnt seen any new stuff in many years.Only on railroad box cars.
6719037,Eckohlt,2023-03-02 10:43:00,3685,Is the stuff on the box cars have anything to do with fishing??
6719045,prov1800,2023-03-02 11:10:00,5010,None.

6719775,Bill Krejca,2023-03-04 07:41:00,6107,"Back in the 1950's, I think, during a summer of low water, a relative stopped at the deserted reservation east of Turtle Narrows on LOW. He found many remnants near the lowered water's edge, I personally never saw any of them. Bill"
6648332,tv4fish,2022-04-16 05:52:00,2694,"I thought I would mention this: WAAAY back (probably 1985-1990) when my group begin to motor up to the Grassy Bay area on Lac Seul from Deception Bay- we found out that there was/is an old war prisoner camp along the way. On one of our trips back to Deception Bay, we decided to stop and explore the camp. Wouldn't you know - one of the guys found a bottle of that old hair tonic -Vitalis. Yep - he kept it as a souvenir."
6648352,KRobins,2022-04-16 07:00:00,34,actually 2 POW camps on the lake. I poke around both and have quite the collection of bottles/cans/tools. There once was a Hudson Bay Company trading post on the lake from mid 1800’s but it’s now under water &#x1f928;This is a photo of an old single shot 12 ga
6648436,PRO-V16,2022-04-16 10:35:00,454,Cool stuff. The cemetery just east of the Hudson Bay post is quite interesting to visit too.
6718631,KRobins,2023-03-01 07:56:00,34,hmmm not sure the locals would be ok with poking around the cemetery. I could be wrong I do know a few things found via the flooding from the cemetery and caused a bit of a stir with the Lac Seul band.
6718651,btyreprich,2023-03-01 08:29:00,1067,One one trip Lake St Joseph - staying at Old Post & Village - the lake level was down considerably. Walking along the beach in front of the camp I found a round metal sphere that was badly rusted. Camp owner John said it was a small cannon ball!
6718667,KRobins,2023-03-01 09:14:00,34,Lake St Joe flows into Lac Seul via the Root River. A set of old spillway dams make it like Lac Seul in that the water levels flux enough to erode history outa the shorelines. I’m planing a canoe trip starting in Root Bay off St Joe down the Root River to find an old HBC cabin and explore some old forgotten rail portages. I’m told the steam engines are still up there hidden in the tree line .
6718697,Eckohlt,2023-03-01 10:41:00,3685,Good luck n make sure you take a pole.
6718905,PRO-V16,2023-03-01 23:15:00,454,"We didn't visit it as in poking around, we did it respectfully like any cemetery noting headstone info. No artifact hunting involved."
6718949,Bill Krejca,2023-03-02 06:40:00,6107,"Along with the various POW camps scattered around in the bush, it can not be that uncommon to come across older temporary logging camps/netters camps. One of the giveaways I found was the number of piles of old rusted cans, and etc., along with a barely decipherable minimal shortened tree height. I did find an old rusty knife at one, and some silverware, some 50 years ago on LOW. Recycling was not a common practice back then. Bill"
6718997,prov1800,2023-03-02 09:04:00,5010,Been to the POW camps on LS.Interesting.I heard very gourds.Would of been a long walk if you wanted to escape.Most all beaches in the area and there are hundreds have all kinds of native arrow heads and spear heads some pottery and rock dolls.Interesting stuff.Always fun to get out of the boat and do some beach cooming.West end of LS has lots to and some areas have pictographs dating back hundreds of years.Eagle and Cliff lakes have some real cool ones.
4156777,campchick,2015-08-25 08:38:00,96,I have found pottery shards down by the water at one of our outposts. Pretty cool!
4157185,Carnhzkr,2015-08-25 11:24:00,964,Here the two points we've found - the large one is a spear point found along what would have been the Manigotagan River in MB and the arrowhead near Altimeter Creek in ON.
4158569,BrianE,2015-08-25 20:32:00,98,way cool! thanks!
6647562,KRobins,2022-04-13 11:38:00,34,That is the year my dad bought the camp

6647664,Skywagon,2022-04-13 16:43:00,1106,"Found these, plus another box full in my former life living on the prairie."
6647706,Carnhzkr,2022-04-13 18:48:00,964,I grew up on a Rez in Nebraska. Lived there until I went off to college. You'd think I would have found lots of old artifacts but I only found one arrowhead.
6647846,KRobins,2022-04-14 09:24:00,34,up here in Northern Canada I get to explore a water route used for 1000’s of years to get from Hudson Bay to Lake Superior and Lake Winnipeg. I one day I can find pieces ranging from 8500 to 500 yrs ago
6647992,Laketripper,2022-04-14 18:38:00,103,Indeed a fascinating waterway full of history. It's a shame some of it has been lost to flooding ....the likes of Lac Seul Lake as an example.
6648010,KRobins,2022-04-14 19:52:00,34,The dam in 1928 indeed did hide a lot of history including the Hudson’s Bay Company Post but on the flip side the dam erodes the shoreline exposing all the stuff I find &#x1f609;
4153633,Carnhzkr,2015-08-23 20:04:00,964,"Have you ever found an interesting artifact on a Canadian fishing trip? On the NW section of Lac Seul there's a quiet cove where Whitewing Resort keeps it's houseboat. We stopped there to eat lunch and stretch our legs a few weeks ago. My son was skipping rocks and picks up one that he thinks looks like an arrowhead. I looked at it and am convinced he found an artifact. A few years ago, the same thing happened to me in Manitoba. I was skipping rocks and pick up an odd looking one. It's a perfectly shaped spear point I now use as a paperweight on my desk. Really makes you think when you find something like that. Some aboriginal probably spent days carving out an arrowhead or spear point who knows how long ago, only to have it wash ashore for me to stumble upon it. What are the chances? Can't help but wonder if these points were ever used to bring down a moose or a caribou."
4153713,BrianE,2015-08-23 20:32:00,98,"Great find there my friend and thanks for sharing, i found my first arrowhead accidently that way while walking through a plowed field many years ago, then i was hooked and found over 50 while scouring neighboring fields elsewhere in N.E. IL over several years.I found two in Mexico back in 1990 on a Hunting trip after a horrible downpour that stranded us overnite out in the middle of nowhere, i found one on the way to my Dove stand and one on the way back, the ones from Mexico are very thin and fine and much different then the ones from home."
4153913,Juls,2015-08-24 04:21:00,13414,"I think I did...on this last trip to Meta Lake. Same thing...skipping stones. I turn one over and it looks odd. It appears that it was used as the base of the stick used to make fire...the old way...by friction. Across the lake, from the lodge, is a burial ground, so there certainly was human activity there for a very long time. It's a perfect divot in the rock....not naturally made at all. So, that's what I'm going with. I too brought it home.... for my ""rock collection""."
4153985,octanehi5,2015-08-24 05:30:00,1104,I had a guy fishing with me last yr that was fishing with a mitchel 300 a true artifact. I once pulled up a piece of petifide wood.from the bottom of the lake in northern quebec. the lake was carved out by the glazier a few yrs ago!
4154017,pjshorthorn,2015-08-24 05:53:00,5654,"Although not an artifact,still a pretty cool find back in 1982. We pulled up for shorelunch around the Chamberlain Narrows area on Lac Seul. While most of the group napped, I found a trail and went exploring. I came across an old trappers line. There were a number of snares and steel traps still set from what I would have imagined to be from the previous winter. All the traps had been baited with heads from small northern and the traps were located inside of a narrow semicircle structure made out of sticks poked into the ground upright.This would have been during a time when trapping,fishing and hunting was still very prevalent by the native Canadian Indians from Reservation 28 that is on the lake. PjShorthorn."
4154193,SinOrSwim,2015-08-24 07:00:00,1528,I find an artifact every morning when I see MorganMan on the dock!!!!!! Heeeyyoohhhhhhhhh
4154353,Mike Kansas,2015-08-24 08:10:00,1463,We stopped for shore lunch one day just north of Bear Narrows on Lac Seul and I found an arrowhead on the shoreline. It was especially cool for me because I have a collection of arrowheads that was started by my father and I 60 years ago. Every time I have found one I have had the same thought as you about how some hunter from years past deposited it while hunting for food for his family. Each time one is found it feels like a connection to the past when life was a true challenge. Mike Kansas
4155065,vteye,2015-08-24 13:49:00,812,Char fishing from shore on Baffin island came across a bunch of whale teeth. We presumed they were narwhales or beluga. They appeared to be from decades before.
4155625,WalleyeMatt,2015-08-24 18:22:00,93,Every year I find my Father In Law siting in the truck headed for Canada and in my boat when we get there. What a find. Matt
4156001,Live to jig,2015-08-24 20:06:00,159,"I found a old ax on a remote island, stuck in a tree while exploring the island with toilet paper. after a quick shore lunch. I took it home cleaned it up and found the makers name and Googled it and found a pic of it...it was made in the 40's. I restored it and it hangs in the man cave...makes me smile when I look at it."
