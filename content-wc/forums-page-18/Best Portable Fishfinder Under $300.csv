6721429,Franco,2023-03-08 15:39:00,107,I was kidding lol. I'll bring it All I need is to buy Amik a prop or a lower end!
6721433,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 15:53:00,3685,"I heard Amik got some new motors,they don't require a prop or lower unit.So your good to go,wide f'in open."
6720167,kona77,2023-03-05 10:52:00,236,"Might be looking to buy a Garmin Striker 4 bundle to take up to Ontario later this year. It comes with rechargeable batteries and wonder how long they last on a full charge. I see some guys are using a lithium battery with them and not sure I would be OK with the batteries that come in the bundle. Charging is not a problem since we have electricity in the cabin. Any input from guys using this unit that comes with the rechargeable batteries would be appreciated. I used the regular battery the first year I had my Garmin Striker and I remember charging it after a 2-3 days. We were on a new body of water so I had it on constantly. I believe I charged it twice during the 7-day week. As I noted, changed to the Lithium for weight and I only had to charge it once for the whole week."
6720461,Donscs,2023-03-06 09:06:00,379,"Hey Kona, thanks for the response. Do you recall what size Lithium you purchased, i.e., 7ah, 10ah. Thanks again,"
6720471,NWBearcatgrad,2023-03-06 09:23:00,36,"Not the beat pic, but my set up is similar to alot of the other posts. I bought a cheapo toolbox at Walmart. Mounted the unit mount on top and drilled holes to run the wired out to the transducer and unit. Used sealing rings to ""waterproof"" the holes. I just switched over to a lithium battery 2 years ago. HUGE upgrade. Less weight, longer lifetime, and less charges.I use a transom mount for the transducer. It is aluminum and just bolts on. My BIL uses a suction mount and neither is better or worse.....so a toss up. The best thing is all the stuff fits into the box and gets stored and only used when needed. I have used it on a few buddies boats in some smaller lakes and areas that don't have finders easily. My unit was originally on an old 17fter I owned and then sold when my kids were born. If I did it again I would not buy a high dollar unit and still do the same set up. My unit is an old Garmin echo something. It has worked great for a long time!"
6720479,adempsey2.0,2023-03-06 10:01:00,611,"You can calculate an estimate.Typical current draw for that unit is 230 mA or 2.76 W. That is likely without the backlight on, which drains the power. Max is 1A, so I assume that is with the backlight on.The 7Ah would likely run 25 to 30 hours on a single charge.The 10Ah would likely run 36 to 43 hours on a single charge.The benefits of the Lithium is that you can discharge it deeper, it recharges 4X faster and is 1/3 the weight."
6720513,Old Timer,2023-03-06 11:44:00,255,"Not wanting to throw water on this thread, but at a good fly-out lake any old depth finder will be sufficient. And if it goes dead, you'll do just fine without it. Just use the outfitter's map that's where you'll be fishing anyway. For my first twenty-five years in Canada there were no depthfinders. We caught plenty. I'm not sure I caught that many more once I started gluing my eyes to a screen."

Just use the outfitter’s map … that’s where you’ll be fishing anyway.I certainly agree a marked up map from the outfitter is always a good starting point but we have found plenty of other great spots on various lakes and of course depth finders were a valuable tool. We have fished a couple of our lakes on multiple occasions and agree that once you get to know a lake and the best spots then we don't run our depth finders all that often."
6721373,Franco,2023-03-08 12:44:00,107,I have had a Garmin Striker 4 with the portable kit for quite a few years. It's great. No complaints at all. A 7ah SLA that's in good shape will last about 3 days if you're thoughtful about power / overall use. I just bought a 10ah LifePo4 battery for it but that's only because I have no usually have no electricity where I go.
6721421,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 15:24:00,3685,Amik will have some juice for ya Franco!
6721423,Franco,2023-03-08 15:29:00,107,Lol…maybe…but I probably won’t even bring the finder up there! Won’t need it!
6721425,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 15:36:00,3685,"You bring it!!!!it will at least help you see the humps and the rocks under the surface,just coz it's a flyin doesn't mean you can leave sht back at home,once your at the lake it's kind hard to go back n get your depth finder."
6709127,SweetD,2023-01-24 12:34:00,243,"I have a couple of older units that generally work OK but have experienced some nice units over past 5-7 years and just wondering what others might suggest.Ideally color display, GPS course mapping. Nothing crazy as we are almost always on a fly-in so depth, fish finding capabilities + tracking our routes when fishing bigger water we have found to be helpful. Would like something out of the package ready to go vs putting all the components together to make it portable.Thanks in advance."
6709231,Walleye Wanderer,2023-01-24 20:36:00,101,"Hey SweetD, I have been dragging a STRIKER Plus 4cv up north on fly-in trips for the past couple years and find it does pretty much everything I need it to do. It's small, light and the Vivid model sells for about $250 CDN. Cheers WW"
6709313,Mojo-NC,2023-01-25 07:58:00,1929,"If you or any of your buddies already have a fishfinder that you really like, it would be more economical to convert it to portable. If you do that you will likely have a much better unit than if you were to purchase something in its entirety. If it is something that you will only use in Canada, it's hard to justify spending too much unless you go there often. I already have a couple of Lowrance HDS 7 Gen 3 fishfinders on my current boat. I only use one of them. To convert the unit to portable, I had to purchase a spare transducer, a suction cup mount for the transducer that attaches to the camp boat transom, a rechargeable SLA or lithium battery (lithium preferred), a battery charger, a power cord that is specific to the fishfinder unit you're using, a mounting bracket for the fishfinder head unit, cigarette lighter plugs, a portable case, and some foam to secure the battery inside the case. I also purchased some rubber feet for the case to keep it from sliding around on the camp boat seat. Most of the components I mentioned are very cheap (or at least reasonable) from Amazon. The transducer and the battery/charger make up most of the cost and you'll need a battery/charger for anything you purchase anyway. It may sound complicated but it's fairly simple and extremely convenient. I put a lot of thought into making it efficient and reliable, but not a lot of money. Here are a couple of pictures of my final product, one while in use. It works great, has Sonar/DownScan, a Navionics chip with many Canada lakes already mapped, and GPS. Everything but the transducer, head unit, and charger fit inside the case when not in use. I remove the mounting bracket and place it inside the case when not in use as well."
6709321,grindstone,2023-01-25 08:14:00,201,"hey I really like those pool noodles for a camp boat. As to the battery for the HDS how many amp hours is yours. Our camp's batteries are (have been) on their last legs for several years and I'm thinking of getting my own to bring. I also bring one of my own boats units as well, having a spare power cord transducer for the week in fish catching Nirvana."
6709327,kona77,2023-01-25 08:36:00,236,"I also have a Garmin Striker 4 unit. Bought a couple years ago with ""the bundle"" that includes the carrying bag and transducer. I see Cabela's still has the unit for $199 and of course there are other places to purchase. I did buy a lithium battery just to help reduce the weight of the whole unit. I think I only had to re-charge once last year over a week of fishing. Does all the basics you mentioned and I was happy with the purchase so far."
6709337,Mojo-NC,2023-01-25 10:03:00,1929,"Yeah, we do love the pool noodles for our camp boats. They cost almost nothing and have so many different uses. I use a 10Ah Lithium LiFePO4 Deep Cycle Battery. Note: Lithium batteries require a different charger but they are much better batteries as compared with SLA batteries. It lasts all day and charges quickly while we're cleaning fish and making dinner. I do turn the screen brightness down to help extend the battery charge whenever possible."
6709341,kettyspanky,2023-01-25 10:11:00,271,I have 2 Garmin striker 4's. One in my small boar and one portable for fishing trips. They work awesome. I would highly suggest them.
6709387,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-25 14:26:00,151,"Another vote for a Garmin Striker 4. I've had one for a few years now and it seems to work fine, but I have no real basis for comparison..."
6709597,Carnhzkr,2023-01-26 10:50:00,964,"Like Mojo, on my last fly-in, I pulled my HB Helix 7 off of my boat and converted it to portable. Mine is an older gen 1 model, but it worked great for mapping and really helped me find fish hanging off the edge of reefs. A new Helix 7 would push you way past your $300, but maybe you could find an older one on the used market. If you decide to do anything like this, lithium is definitely the way to go."
