6719709,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-03-03 22:50:00,358,Remember Fish Formula? My dad would spray that oil on his bait and leave huge oil slicks where it entered the water.
6719717,Eckohlt,2023-03-04 04:37:00,3685,"Ya,that's another one."
6719725,Stickman8474,2023-03-04 04:55:00,39,"Mepps are great spinners. Aglias and Black Furys being favorites. Favorite color is whatever the fish are hitting that particular day, though maybe the Aglia with gold backed red and white blade being most consistent. Don't over look the Mepps Long Cast #4 option for deeper retrieves. I've had good success with the Long Cast, especially on the Orange and Gold."
6720589,proguidedream,2023-03-06 15:01:00,345,"i personally keep to a simple method , hammered brass when its sunny. hammered silver when its cloudy. fish like the flash. sometimes dull painted ones do not provide any flash especially deep."
6719313,NM_Trout,2023-03-03 09:39:00,1094,"Going to try spinners this year for walleye and pike. Looks like Mepps in #4 or #5 are the right size. What are your favorite colors? I'm guessing chartreuse / orange / red are a good choice, and it seems that a gold blade is right for tannin waters. Opinions?"
6719329,Pooch,2023-03-03 10:12:00,4618,"Over the years gold (a good bright gold) seems to be fairly consistent. As far as spinner blades go, a white or gold back side of the blade seems to sometimes make things ""work"". A bright gold jig has sometimes been the bread winner when everything else was ignored. Can also say that about any particular color on a given day. One of my old fishing buddies never fished anything but a red and white spinner blade with silver back side, and over the years caught as many fish as the rest of us. His approach was simple and hard to argue against. Pike love chartreuse and noisy anything for some reason. Pooch"
6719335,Clairebear,2023-03-03 10:21:00,937,"PROP purple, red, orange, and pink or combinations of."
6719341,Cozzmo,2023-03-03 10:44:00,7,I love using the double blade #5 for pike. Blue/Silver blade with white skirt was the hot lure on our last Saskatchewan trip. Also do very well with the Gold/Red blades with yellow skirt. I always opt for #5 and double blade regardless of the color.
6719345,MN_Moose,2023-03-03 10:57:00,964,For Mepps spinners I like a #3 in white/white or orange blade & black tail
6719351,kim n indiana,2023-03-03 11:07:00,62,fished ton spinners in Maine for smallies. copper seemed to be best. but i don't think Mepps makes them anymore last I checked. here is another hint. bend the front part where you tie on up 90 degrees to make right angle. takes all the line twist out.
6719469,adempsey2.0,2023-03-03 13:40:00,611,"Ultimately, I think any flashy finish - silver, gold, copper and a few contrasting colors like black/yellow, black/chart, white/red, white/pink, white/blue, firetiger, rainbow trout will cover your bases. I don't get too caught up in colors, I just like ones that contrast well. Grab a couple Syclops spoons too. Those are pretty good.Quote: Originally Posted by kim n indianafished ton spinners in Maine for smallies. copper seemed to be best. but i don't think Mepps makes them anymore last I checked. here is another hint. bend the front part where you tie on up 90 degrees to make right angle. takes all the line twist out.Big fan of Copper too. I think most of mine are Blue Fox (no preference over Mepps, just what I had access to probably). I think Mepps makes the Aglia in copper. Not sure, been a while. I probably have some, but would have to go look."
6719531,RichA$1970,2023-03-03 15:11:00,1159,I’ve had luck with a Windel’s Pike Harrasser Magnum with a long gold blade & yellow/brown/red tail and then a Mepps Musky Killer with an orange blade and black tail for dark days. Also agree on the Mepps Cyclops in goldor silver in the 5” size
6719637,kona77,2023-03-03 18:53:00,236,I agree brighter colors in most Canadian waters make sense and we use a number of gold/copper blades. Silver on bright sunny days has also worked. Over the years one of our tops Mepps lures has been #4 Black Fury with chartreuse markings. Hard to explain but that has caught the biggest gators on several trips.
6719657,Eckohlt,2023-03-03 19:14:00,3685,Well by the looks of reading this it seems every color works!!
