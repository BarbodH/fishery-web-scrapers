6722823,Bill Krejca,2023-03-13 12:23:00,6107,"Yup, just the same technique as cat fishing, slip sinker several feet above the hook, and a hunk(s) of fish meat. Some folks say raw chicken, beef heart, etc., works pretty good, but I never tried them. Along that same line, I have had good luck by finding a flat near deep water and putting down a front and rear anchor, just adjacent to the deep water, and then cast to the deep water. You have to allow some slack in the line due to the boat moving a bit, but it can be a pretty good way to trout fish. The trout may swallow the treble, so this technique doesn't work well for catch and release, don't forget to get your treble back during cleaning, don't want to kill a bear!! Bill"
6722837,prov1800,2023-03-13 13:41:00,5010,"Shore fishing for trout is very relaxing.Sometimes we would hike to a good spot and throw a treble hook a chunk of sucker as far as you could and then would wrap line around a tin can and when trout would take the bait and swim off with it the can would roll on the rocks.We would always wait till the line stopped moving before setting the hook.We would do same procedure if we got to our really good spots by boat,except would take line out from shore and drop line in, then on way to shore we would clip another line and hook on and about half way back to shore we would drop that line in.We have done that since my kids were little and usually we would camp out a few day.Was usually a boat load with the 2 kids and my 2 German shepherds plus all our camping gear in a 14 ft deep and wide lund.Mornings always seemed best on bright sunny days.We would also troll for trout and always had great action after ice out.Could leave our stuff at the campsite worry free that anybody would even think of coming to shore with my 2 dogs there.lol."

6722915,prov1800,2023-03-13 16:03:00,5010,We still do it .Matt has taken the little guy for a taste of that last spring.
6722465,prov1800,2023-03-12 08:12:00,5010,"Got out for the derby yesterday which was held in Boulder Bay by Ojibway Lodge.Roads where really plowed out well where even cars could get out on the ice.Seemed like couple hundred plus people showed up on a cooling day and some bad wind.Started at noon and went to 4.Big fish would win.Few fish caught and a 4.7 lb pike did the trick.Couple smaller pike for second and third.I managed 3 12"" walleyes but never brought them in to be weighed.Someone said I should of as 1.2 lb would of taken 3 rd.Oh well.Derby was on a big flat in a bay.Fun time even though derby are usually slow for catching.I did bring my pop up and was nice to get out of the wind at times."
6722499,Eckohlt,2023-03-12 09:09:00,3685,"I see people are spread out pretty good,not shoulder to shoulder,are those derby's dry derby's or can people have booze??"
6722511,prov1800,2023-03-12 09:15:00,5010,I'd say pretty dry.lol.
6722677,Skywagon,2023-03-13 05:25:00,1106,"We fished all day yesterday on a trout lake, the north-east wind was so bad you had to be in a ice fishing shelter, foot tracks in the snow blew in quickly. I would guess some of those at the derby probably sat in their cars while fishing."
6722693,prov1800,2023-03-13 06:57:00,5010,There were a few went to vehicles to warm up.I stood outside here and there but sat in my tent to get out of wind.looking forward to a bit more ice fishing in some better conditions
6722697,Eckohlt,2023-03-13 07:23:00,3685,"What is it about 10 weeks till opener?,someone on WC must be counting the hours until lift off!"
6722701,prov1800,2023-03-13 07:44:00,5010,May 18 will be the walleye opener but everything else except muskie will still be open.Always hope we get a bit of open water before that and get the boat in and get some lake trout that sometimes cruise the shallow bays.Can still be cool but that first day in the boat sure feels good after a long winter.Acording to some pictures I have I was on a small section of open water last year on April 20 th.
6722705,Eckohlt,2023-03-13 07:58:00,3685,Mother Nature will determine if you go after lakers early.
6722709,prov1800,2023-03-13 08:01:00,5010,Yup.Have at times fished off shore for them by throwing a treble hook out as far you can a wait for a trout to pick it up.Have had great success with that.
6722721,Eckohlt,2023-03-13 08:19:00,3685,What kind of meat on that treble!!
