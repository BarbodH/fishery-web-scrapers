6639800,Baseline,2022-03-12 17:29:00,3207,I went to the show today and Separation Lake Lodge was not there. Good luck with getting a refund.
6695884,Morgann211,2022-11-08 10:42:00,3,Please let me know if anyone sees or hears from him. He has 1800.00 worth of deposits that I would like back if he's not gonna provide the service promised. Pretty ****ty to do this to a group that's been supporting his family for over 20 years.
6695886,proguidedream,2022-11-08 10:46:00,345,"maybe call other lodges on the lake , Walsten outpost ?? surely they will be in the know if a lodge on the lake is shut down or someone else took over. or call the float plane company you used and see if anyone is flying in and out of there"
6695888,Morgann211,2022-11-08 10:49:00,3,I have contacted Walstens. She said it sounds like he skipped town. Has had a lot of calls with the same stories.
6695892,proguidedream,2022-11-08 11:00:00,345,"interesting. not much comes up on google. an old linked in page the company is called ""Separation Lake Camps Ltd"" i would file a report with the RCMP and at least that might flag some other stuff. if the bank owns it they would want their money somehow. and if he owned it outright, why not sell it and get a few 100k ? maybe passed away, owes nothing to the bank so no one cares about the place."
6695898,Morgann211,2022-11-08 11:42:00,3,I spoke to his brother who said he's fine just hadent head from him. What is the RCMP?
6695902,proguidedream,2022-11-08 12:20:00,345,"Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) , or the OPP Ontario Provincial Police. you can file with OPP online herehttps://www.opp.ca/index.php?id=132 at least that why they are notified of some shady business going on."
6698690,Herkyhawk00,2022-11-30 11:18:00,33,Did you ever contact the campground which is part of Separation?
6722315,WalleyeCrazy2,2023-03-11 13:01:00,29,Separation Lake Lodge is under new ownership! Chris and Amber Halley have purchased Separation Lake Lodge. I have had the pleasure of spending time with their family @ Caribou Falls for over 20 years now. Their website is https://www.halleyscamps.com/. The best number to get a hold of them is 1-800-465-3325.
6722339,RichA$1970,2023-03-11 15:40:00,1159,I saw under new ownership and the new prices $$$$
6632660,PIKE PRO,2022-02-12 05:35:00,28,Has anyone tried to get a hold of Ron at SSL? Been calling and the phone has been disconnected and have sent emails and have got no response....
6634552,Baseline,2022-02-18 06:39:00,3207,I think they have been closed due to the Pandemic . Last year when the border opened I tried to contact them and got no answer and their website was inactive. They are listed as an exhibitor at the the Minneapolis Northwest Sportshow in March so they might be ready to resume operations.
6634560,prov1800,2022-02-18 07:00:00,5010,Think they could at least answer people.
6634572,Baseline,2022-02-18 07:54:00,3207,You would think so. I think they have some management problems. After the owner died and the 2nd generation took over there was a definite change in atmosphere. The last 5 to 7 miles of the road isn't being maintained by the logging operations anymore and the resort declined to co-op money with other property owners to have it graded. It was in rough shape the last time I was there in September 2019. Hope they get it together because it is a great place to fish and you don't find a campground with electricity and a hot shower house 30 miles off the main road anywhere else. The resort cabins are decent too.
6636210,PIKE PRO,2022-02-26 06:22:00,28,Baseline are you planning to attend the sports show? If so can you tell Ron that I've been trying to get a hold of him and tell him to get a hold of me please. He has a grand of my cash for deposits and I'm not happy that he's not answering my emails. Thanks Pike Pro
6636216,walleyecheek,2022-02-26 06:46:00,2231,"Looks like they are out of business. Phone disconnected, no website."
6636228,Eckohlt,2022-02-26 07:53:00,3685,That guys probably laying on some beach in Mexico sipping a tall cool one.
6636244,RichA$1970,2022-02-26 08:08:00,1159,Seems like there’s several other outfitters who don’t check email or phone messages. With today’s technology there is no excuse not to reply back to customers at least within 2 weeks on requests. Another deposit scam outfitter to be noted.
6637038,Baseline,2022-03-01 06:59:00,3207,Right now I'm planning to go. If Separation is at the show I'll let you know and you can contact them.
6637168,PIKE PRO,2022-03-01 15:28:00,28,Thanks Baseline let me know if they are there or not. Because I still have not got any response from them....
