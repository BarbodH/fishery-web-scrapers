Where can he purchase a fishing license? I suppose he can get one on line eHHHH! Regarding crossing the border on a Monday, he will be crossing in the morning, is there typically a long wait on Monday mornings? Thanks"

Don't let the name fool you, Canadian tire is like a Fleet Farm, with a nice hunting & fishing department. Otherwise Nestor Falls Bait, as mentioned."

6721983,nitroman,2023-03-10 11:18:00,368,Online is the way to go for license. You can buy it today and print it out and throw it in the tackle box/boat and done! Monday crossing will be easy.
