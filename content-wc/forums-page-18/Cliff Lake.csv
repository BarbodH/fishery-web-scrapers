6720545,Eckohlt,2023-03-06 12:36:00,3685,"45 years ago I would take naps out on the lake also,not from being tired,it was from the liquid I put in my body!"
6720285,prov1800,2023-03-05 18:04:00,5010,Picked today to go for some lake trout.Nice bright sunny day with minimal wind.Got out around 9 this morning Took our time getting out of the house as it was still -14 out and frosty.Took till around 11 to feel a bit of warmth but it got to +2.wife kicked my butt in first few hours using live bait while I tried artificial.I had a lot of fish chasing my lures but wouldnt take.When I changed to live I quickly caught up to her.Guessing we caught a couple dozen.Nothing big but just right for us for a supper.Nice to get out on a nice day.

6720291,prov1800,2023-03-05 18:18:00,5010,Hey.i did contribute 2 of those.
6720293,Eckohlt,2023-03-05 18:25:00,3685,She probably pulled her line up to give you a better chance to catch one or two.
6720301,prov1800,2023-03-05 18:53:00,5010,She did this for a while.lol.Thats when I caught up.
6720363,Eckohlt,2023-03-06 05:16:00,3685,"Those lakers will wear a person right out,specially if your putting the hammer down on them,I don't blame her for taking a rest,she don't need to go to the gym,just cliff lake."
6720383,Bill Krejca,2023-03-06 06:33:00,6107,"Not huge, but still nice fish, climate looks warmer than reality, eh? John - did you try those 2 heavier red/white shinny jigs which I gave you? Those are my standard trout killers. Bill"
6720401,prov1800,2023-03-06 07:17:00,5010,"I did and unfortunately did not catch any.Tried them last time out to.Yesterday my wife was hauling trout up steady on a 2 1/2"" white tube with a minnow.I tried the same tube with no minnow and then went through my tackle trying a bunch of stuff.They would chase every lure that went down but would not take it.Had a lot of fun watching my sonar.I decided to put a minnow on and first drop I caught one.lol.Has to be the smell from the live bait.it was a instant hit at 40 ft as the trout came of the bottom fast.Caught a bunch while wife was taking a break.lol.They were all about same size and perfect to eat.Lake trout any bigger tend to get greasy and take on a different taste.one thing about trout is even when there smaller they can put up a good fight.My son and family were fishing a different spot and he got there late but had one up on the ice .Will venture to some other spots later when snow goes and will use ATV on pure ice and not leave any tracks with my sled that people can follow."
6720407,Eckohlt,2023-03-06 07:34:00,3685,Must be spawning in cliff just fine by the looks of the size.
6720415,prov1800,2023-03-06 07:39:00,5010,Think they are to.Need to see small fish and if you do very good sign especially trout lakes.No smelt in there.
