6719203,Mojo-NC,2023-03-03 05:30:00,1929,"We've flown into Winnipeg several times, but have also tried several other options. I completely agree with the others about Winnipeg being an ""undesirable"" city. Prov1800 described Winnipeg well. It can be difficult to navigate around because there's no freeway to quickly get away from the airport, but it does have a Costco and other large chain stores such as WalMart where you can get your groceries and other necessary supplies. The several hour drive from Winnipeg to Ontario is flat and boring. Going through customs at the airport is very convenient. Rental cars are readily available. International Falls is more like a quaint small town with friendly people and it has a few stores from which you can get your groceries. It is really easy to get around in INL. It used to be inexpensive to fly into INL, but that has changed considerably over the years. The airport is very small and does not have a lot of flight options. You have to book very early. We've never had a problem getting a rental there and we usually use Wherley Motors. It's has just gotten really expensive to fly to INL and Winnipeg is not much cheaper. We've flown into Duluth and driven up from there a few times, depending on the airfare costs. Duluth adds 3 hours of driving. Next year we're flying directly into Minneapolis and driving the extra 5 hours. The extra drive sucks, but at about $300 to MSP vs $1000 to INL is too significant of a savings to not do it. We just have to fly up a day early. It's also a direct flight to MSP for us, so there is much less of a chance of flights being missed or canceled. Last year we lost a whole day of fishing when flying into INL because of flight delays. We want to avoid that happening again at all costs."
6719229,Tristian5431,2023-03-03 06:44:00,37,"I just looked up the drive...from MSP to Cliff lake is an 8 hour drive. I think I could handle this if I had a buddy, but in most cases I am coming up solo. Last summer I came up for a week solo flying into IF and then back a month later with my wife and 2 year old so we needed that shorter drive. I think I am going to stick with Winnipeg this summer because doing the 8 hour drive seems a bit daunting for me driving solo. If I had a bud to chat with on the way up I would take the drive up. In the future though.. when I have a dedicated fishing buddy who I can split the drive with I will just fly into MSP and then drive up!"
6719271,LoDo,2023-03-03 08:04:00,721,"We fly from Denver to get to our lake in NW Ontario and have always flown through Winnipeg and had success. Easy customs, easy rental cars, etc.... The drive is quick. I dont care about the flat farmland, theres beauty in all land. Kenora and northern Lake of the Woods is cool. Kenora has improved. Lake of the Woods brewery is new. Good spot to grab lunch and a beer. Do you have a connecting flight in MSP? Winnipeg used to fly direct 2x daily to/from Denver and no longer an option. Winnipeg states its an International airport, but theres nothing international about it other than MSP. Feel bad for the 1m Canadian citizens that use Winnipeg Airport as their primary hub that have to connect in Calgary or Toronto to get into the US. Huge time suck and cost."
6719275,prov1800,2023-03-03 08:20:00,5010,Thunder Bay is a good option but adds about a hour drive if your destination is the Vermilion Bay area.
6719311,NM_Trout,2023-03-03 09:37:00,1094,"That's what we settled on this year as well. The costs to fly into INL are now ridiculous. I got scared off by the covid tests needed to fly home from Winnipeg. Last year we flew into Grand Rapids, and drove up, and that was LONG drive. Driving from MSP will likewise be a pain, but this year we are paying extra to have an additional driver (why do rental cars companies do that to us?). Being able to split driving will make it just fine. Flying into MSP on Friday, spending Friday night in Fort Francis, then leisurely drive up to Red Lake on Saturday. It adds an extra hotel night, but splitting costs with a fishing buddy is not bad."
6719319,Tristian5431,2023-03-03 09:50:00,37,"Coming from NJ the connecting flight is Montreal. This will be my first time flying to Winnipeg. I checked out Thunderbay as well and the flight times really don't help with the addition of the extra hour drive... so Winnipeg it is. If I had a few fellas with me in the future I'd definitely consider the drive from MSP. When I looked that round trip flight cost to International Falls, I had sticker shock LOL.. glad to know that I am not the only one who is boycotting those cost. LOL"
6719325,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-03 09:59:00,8293,I'm thinking maybe I should start a shuttle service from Mpls for you guys.
6719463,NM_Trout,2023-03-03 13:31:00,1094,"If you could get an old van or school bus, and charge $100 or so for a round trip, I think you would stay crazy busy."
6719471,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-03 13:40:00,8293,Problem is you could only turn 1 trip a day so it wouldn't work unless all frights came in at the same time.
6719547,Golden Eagle,2023-03-03 15:21:00,2642,"Twice I've used Bearskin roundtrip from Winnipeg to Red Lake, but Bearskin has priced me out of that one, with Bearskin doing mostly government paid flights."
6718877,Laketripper,2023-03-01 20:05:00,103,"Winnipeg is labled by some Canadians as being the a$$hole of the country but that is only because it is situated near the center of Canada longitudinally and is compared to that particular body part by location.It offers a great culinary experience if you have the time to explore.Like any other city, in some areas you need to keep your head on a swivel...and don't walk down the street with a case of beer in hand. There are a few choices of road routes to continue eastbound from the airport and the best one for a newbie to the city would be to take the north perimeter. ."
6718883,RichA$1970,2023-03-01 20:29:00,1159,"I see Tristian is from New Jersey so if he can drive there, then Winnipeg will be no issue."
6718889,prov1800,2023-03-01 20:38:00,5010,Wpg is a sh*t hole like any other big city.I lived there and grew up there.Good parts and bad parts.
6718911,pjshorthorn,2023-03-02 02:20:00,5654,"This . When I lived in the ATL area I could get a direct flight into YPG. It was very easy all around. If your trip timing is at the same time as the sunflowers blooming on the north side of the city, it is a pretty cool sight and a very easy drive to the 105 area. IFalls has limited flight schedules for connections. If your flight is canceled, you will be waiting for awhile to get to MSP to catch a flight home. PjShorthorn"
6718967,Tristian5431,2023-03-02 07:16:00,37,"I live in New Jersey, about 25 mins out of NYC, Winnipeg can't be any worse than NYC hahahah. East coast folks like myself, who live close to NYC generally trust no one, and think that everyone is trying to rob or stab you, except my fishing buds of course ! Seems like Winnipeg is the better option! My plan is to land, get my rental car and start driving to area where I will be staying. I can check out the city of Winnipeg on the way back!"
6719039,Gord,2023-03-02 10:51:00,62,"I lived in Winnipeg most of my life. Best to jump on Route 90 then head south from there on the Perimeter Hwy(101) 20 /30 minutes, it'll take about 20-30 minutes to get to the Kenora and #1 turn off. The shortest route would be to take the #12 highway (Steinbach) which is about 20 minutes from the Kenora and #1 highway turnoff then to Rousseau MN all the way to IF.

6719043,prov1800,2023-03-02 11:09:00,5010,Agree its easier but will miss out on the culture the city offers.

6719095,Skywagon,2023-03-02 15:41:00,1106,"I had some of the Cat row crop's back in the day! As far as which airport I would suggest Winnipeg also, it is pain running from one side of MSP to the other to catch the I Falls commuter flight."
6719113,phishfearme,2023-03-02 17:20:00,1242,"have you ever considered going into Thunder Bay? United from Trenton to Toronto then onto TB. we've gone from PIT to TB most every year - good and reasonable rental cars available and good motels (The Valhalla is terrific no matter what others say) and lots of food shopping available right there. as has been pointed out, the Winnipeg airport if on the wrong side of town with respect to the Ontario lakes. otherwise, we've found that getting a non-stop into MSP is ultimately the easiest way - avoiding flying international is recommended. phish"
6718607,Tristian5431,2023-03-01 06:40:00,37,"Good Morning, Looks like a flight from NJ to Winnipeg is less expensive and more convenient for me for my June 23' trip. Are there any downsides to flying into Winnipeg vs. International falls? It would be a four hour ride to the lodge vs a 3 hour ride from International falls, but the flight schedule and price make it so much more convenient seems to be so much better? How's the rental car situation in Winnipeg? Thanks!"
6718619,DeBo,2023-03-01 07:34:00,211,Hopefully someone can chime in on Rental Car situation there. When I flew into Winnipeg for work a bunch 8 years ago or so it was no issue. The airport itself is just fine. Bunch of hotels right next to it for the trip home if needed. It’s on the NW side of town so you’ll have to take the perimeter highway around or cut through on surface streets in places.If you are a food person it’s a great city to start your trip. All sorts of different cuisine available. No offense to IF/FF but that’s a bonus to some people.It’s an easy drive to the NW Ontario lakes. You’ll start out in flat farm land prairie and then you’ll hit the shield.
6718625,bthomas3333,2023-03-01 07:44:00,465,Done it a ton of times. Car's are right across the street and generally available. There is no easy way to get from the airport on the West side to the East side where you will cruise across the farm land until you hit the border. Seems like ON has all the lakes! The good news about cutting through town is access to food/groceries/booze is all super easy.Personally I am surprised when guys choose to fly into IF. It doesnt save much time and they could take delays since the airport is not a major airport.Brett
6718641,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-01 08:05:00,8293,It's a very nice airport. The only issues getting in & out are caused at the major hubs.
6718653,prov1800,2023-03-01 08:31:00,5010,Bit off a drive getting out of city.For me it's easy as I lived in Wpg but with navigation now it's easy.Once on hwy it's a easy relaxing drive.farm fields then some bush starts and rock cuts in Ontario.Might get stopped at border and further east toward Kenora as lots of construction going on with the twinning of hwy going on.The drive from the falls is very beautifull drive in my opinion so either way very enjoyable.
6718679,Tx Jig tyr,2023-03-01 09:30:00,140,"I have done both several times. Rent cars much easier, more choices in WPG. Hard to believe, but quickest way from the airport is go north to the by pass then head east. On the map it looks counter intuitive. Good luck whichever choice you make. Tx Jig Tyr"
6718807,Fisherman Ted,2023-03-01 15:10:00,461,"Actually there is. GPS will take you all the way through town, just a complete time suck. However when you leave the airport jump on Route 90 North which hits the perimeter highway and away you go. Saving you a ton of time. The one big benefit of flying into Winnipeg is that its a major international airport where you clear customs right there. Crossing at I-Falls can be brutal and add a lot of extra time to your trip. I recommend all my clients fly in and out of YPG. -FT"
6718831,kasmere,2023-03-01 17:01:00,20,Flew in from Chicago a few years ago. Rented a van and drove up to Pine Dock. No problems and fun trip.
6718841,NM_Trout,2023-03-01 18:13:00,1094,"I have flown into Winnipeg, but opted not to this last year. The Covid rules were such that in order to fly back into the US, you had to test negative for Covid within the last 24 hours. The hassle factor of doing a covid test (with not knowing what time we were getting out of camp) was too much for us to want to deal with. My impression of Winnipeg isn't the best. It seems to be a city which is plagued with a LOT of substance abuse. The last time I drove through I recall that there was a lot of intoxication on public display."
6718851,RichA$1970,2023-03-01 19:01:00,1159,"Winnipeg is a nice airport & town, plenty of great eats. Used to go to the New Holland plant a lot when they contract made our Challenger row crop tractors."
