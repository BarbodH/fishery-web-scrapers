6717601,andreindy,2023-02-26 09:34:00,308,"What basic techniques do you use when searching/exploring new ""fly-in"" water with novice fisherman? The members for our group are generally vertical 'jig droppers'...and will generally remain in whatever areas pointed out or discovered. My group of 6 is headed for first time to a smaller fly-in lake (Saga through Twin Likes Outfitters) 2nd week of July. We will need to explore this new lake and I need to grow these fellas and get their help. Boats are 14' camp boats with 9.9. Typically moves about 2.1 at lowest throttle. They will have a locator. They need to learn better boat control. I don't think they will go for learning bottom bouncers...I have tried. I am thinking that I could simply have them tie on a Flicker Shad and long line troll as they putt around? OR I have thought about having them drift/troll around with something like an Erie Dearie and crawler as they work out from shorelines or even deeper water? First, I confess that I need to break out of the chains I put myself in by feeling entirely responsible for my groups fishing success. It's the guys from my family and I want to introduce a few other simple options for this novice group and reduce pressure off of me. Anyone in similar situations?"
6717613,gmattbruin,2023-02-26 09:50:00,174,"Hey, i wouldnt call myself an expert by any means. Weve fished with TLO for over 20yrs. Have fished Hebner, Washi, Esser and settled in on Abamasagi abt 12 trips ago, but never fished Saga. But i find almost all these lakes are very similar type structure, water colour and shorelines. For us, mostly June fishing we focus on shorelines, rocky points and off of them, weed beds ar the beginings of them depending on water temps. Almost exclusively we are trolling, casting, jigging And almost exclusivley we troll with jigs with crly tails of any kind, we also make up our own slow death harnesses that are abt 2ft long. So we take in a good amont of worms. If a shoreline or a small bay is getting pounded by wind and waves, we will focus on that right quick to see what action it will give. Typically it can be awesome for walleye. Troll the shore, come to a point and youll hit the pike waiting. These tactics have never ever failed us on any new lake as we try and discover the key spots."
6717617,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-26 09:59:00,8293,"Every Canadian lodge I have been to there was a map stuck to the wall with spots marked. Sometimes this map was hand drawn and crude, other times it was a regular map. Groups would mark the areas they fished and how they did. It's always a starting point. In general points, drop-offs, saddles are good starting spots. Jigs or bobbers are always pretty easy in Canada. If the wind is blowing you can troll around and explore. Get those boys on a couple 40+"" Pike and won't need to worry about looking for those Walleyes anymore. Have fun."
6717649,andreindy,2023-02-26 10:53:00,308,"I appreciate these thoughts...we were Abamasagi guys too...had to bump elsewhere so my brother could make it. After 3 trips there, I had enough spots marked and mapped to direct these guys and still keep it really simple for them. I would like to teach the guys a few more techniques other than a jig directly vertical beneath the boat on spots that I directly sent them to, because on this lake, I will not yet have those spots. And teaching them how to easily switch it up without major rigging changes required so they learn. I want to help them get from ""Hey Andre, what should we do?"" to ""Hey Andre, jigging really slowed on that spot so we tied on some ""fill in the blank"" and drifted/trolled and got a few...so we are going to try that tonight later..."".

6717671,adempsey2.0,2023-02-26 11:35:00,611,"On a new lake, I will head to one of the spots I picked out before the trip, prioritized based on wind direction, and hit it with jig+grub/paddletail. I may stay a while or I may move to several spots in fairly quick succession to test them out. Just depends on the lake. If I think the fish are a bit deeper, I will also use blade baits, Rippin' Raps etc... to drift/jig If I am in search mode, I will move to trolling cranks or jig+grub. I like to ""power jig"" as well, where you are basically jigging as you move along like you would trolling. Works great for finding active fish. For complete novices, I would stick with jigs. It's just way easier. They are quite versatile. You can anchor and vertical jig, you can drift, cast/retrieve/pop or power jig. You can just use bait + jig and it will work great. Otherwise, trolling cranks is fairly easy but as you said you do need to know how/where to drive the boat. If you are bringing bait, you could bring some backup gear for Lindy rigs since they are easy to rig up. Doubt it will be necessary though. I have only had to move to bait in certain situations - pressured lakes (multiple lodges/camps) and deep lakes with very steep shorelines where I used Slip Bobbers. Regardless, I think you will do well just trolling cranks/jigs and vertical jigging (while drifting). Just be sure to bring some heavier jigs for those windy days or if the fish are a bit deeper (up to 20ft or so)."
6717675,RichA$1970,2023-02-26 11:52:00,1159,"Take a look at a map, play the wind and have them drift with a heavy jig & crawlers. Since you have a depth finder have them troll with a hot tot, Wally diver or husky jerk / shad rap until they get towards an island or point. Blind squirrels find acorns all the times up in Canada, just have them watch some you tube videos & they should be able to figure it so I wouldnâ€™t worry about babysitting them unless they are complete disasters."
6717681,kona77,2023-02-26 12:20:00,236,"Some good suggestions. We have taken some ""newbie"" fisherman about to Canada over the years. I would agree with using heavier jigs/crawlers (or plastics) so they can get to the bottom and can feel the jig bite. Trolling/long lining various cranks makes sense. You did mention using bottom bouncers and wonder why that would be difficult? I have shown bottom bouncing to a number of ""newbie"" fishermen over the years and folks usually pick that technique about pretty quickly. I always found bouncing to be the best/fastest way to cover water and find active walleye's. Middle of July should be a prime time for a crawler bite in deeper water or off structure breaks, rocks etc. Have you thought about taking the new guys out on a local lake just to go over techniques and basic fishing tips before the trip? Maybe that is not an option. Of the 6 guys are we talking 3-4 are the new fishermen?? If so maybe have a couple experienced guys like yourself fish with the new guys the first day or so. Sorry if you have already considered these suggestions."
6720803,jambi,2023-03-07 07:53:00,504,We bring a good basketball net. Drop in some rocks and tie it up. Instant outpost anchor.
6720815,kim n indiana,2023-03-07 08:10:00,62,"In Indiana, that is Sacrilegious ...!!!!"
6720835,reelpro1,2023-03-07 08:46:00,20,Anchors should be provided - along with lifejackets and a safety kit - unless the fly in lodge wants to loose its business in a liable suit.
6720847,Old Timer,2023-03-07 09:01:00,255,I'm all in on an anchor. I use an onion bag for the rocks. At any good fly-out lake you can find fish without a depth finder. Just look at the outfitter's map and fish there or similar spots. An anchor allows you to efficiently catch fish without being a skilled boat operator.
6720861,prov1800,2023-03-07 09:19:00,5010,"It's a fly out so if it's a good lake it's a no brainer.See your mentioning artificial baits.Id start out with live bait.As most flyouts I've ever been to there is usually a guest book that should have a ton of info in it.Bring sonar.If not fish points and islands,mouths across bays and weed beds."
6720863,Walleye2242,2023-03-07 09:21:00,263,I would start by asking Mike Borger.
6717741,adempsey2.0,2023-02-26 16:00:00,611,With respect to maps. I find Bing and Toporama/Fish Online often have the best aerial maps.https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=1b223...=2&form=S00027 Can get a lot of info from topo and aerial maps.
6717933,jambi,2023-02-27 10:02:00,504,All great replies. Make sure each boat has a portable depth finder. Those help a ton when scouting.
6717941,NM_Trout,2023-02-27 10:35:00,1094,"Thanks for this... good info. Is there a way to find out when the satellite images were taken, or a way to get earlier images?"
6717975,adempsey2.0,2023-02-27 12:39:00,611,"I do not believe you can change to different images as you can in something like Google streetview. Getting the date is possible, but not easy. There used to be a free website that you could use to retrieve the information, but that is no longer available. To do it, you basically need to pull it using their API. The aerial images are stitched together using various sources and dates, so that is likely why they do not provide the information. Would be nice though. I tried looking at ArcGIS, but could not figure out if you could change the dates of the basemaps or not.https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html Would be nice if you could change dates like EOSDIS. I use this to gather ice out information. The resolution is too low for much else.https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/"
6718297,gmattbruin,2023-02-28 09:49:00,174,"I love these sat maps. Boy, you can sit there and blow up areas and really identify amazing walleye and pike locations.I compare it to our flying in. Cruising at 200-500ft, looking down on a lake or when dropping in on the 1 youre about to fish.The perspective is a very different one than being on the water itself.Great views!!"
6719879,wdkott,2023-03-04 12:21:00,26,"A great search bait is a hot n tot. Bring various colors in the two sizes. With their bill and wide wobble they rarely get hung up or snagged in the rock. Just troll them so you tick bottom occasionally. The walleyes, pike, and bass all love them. Be sure to troll wind blown shorelines and points. Once you start getting doubleheaders you can set up a drift using your jigs."
6720095,last chance,2023-03-05 05:52:00,3262,"I fished Lake Eries' western basin for years just drifting weight forward spinners but when the zebra mussels cleaned the water we started trolling and the small hot n tots and the small wiggle warts ended up being our go to baits for catching walleye. we tried anything when the fishing got slow and some things worked and some things didn't on any given day. one trip in early may we wasn't catching anything with any of our standard baits. I had got a great deal on some tiny tots but had never used them. but that day I said what did we have to lose. we started using them and right away we started catching one right after the other. we ended up getting a 4 man limit about noon and went in. we started carrying our cooler across the lot to where we were parked. some friends came out to meet us and asked what we had caught. when we said we had our limits they said they didn't believe us and asked to see our fish. we sat the cooler down and opened it and they were amazed at our fish. it took 1/2 to 3/4 of an hr for us to get out of there as people were coming to see our fish. nobody else was catching fish that day because they were up real shallow and they were fishing under them. but day in and day out we caught many limits with the 2"" small size hot n tots and the small size wiggle warts. they are great baits but it's always a good idea to put one shallow diver and one deep diver like the walleye deep diving bandit."
6720519,Old Timer,2023-03-06 11:53:00,255,"All good points from Trout. First off, talk to the outfitter. After all, you're paying him so you can catch fish not take a boat ride. Then bring live bait, even if the outfitter says it's not necessary. After that, a few jigs to put the meat on and you're good to go."
6720571,reelpro1,2023-03-06 13:33:00,20,"Storm Hot'N'Tot - both sizes - the small one will run very close to 15' trolling and the larger one 20' Chrome Black and a Gold Black - troll 15' and 20' depths - you will usually find them at one or the other . For searching also try Cabelas Go To Swim Minnow paddle tail in 5"" threaded on a long shank 3/8 oz jig head. Alewife or Black Shad. Cast swim bait out as far as possible - sink to bottom in 5 to 30 fow - lift rod to 12 oclock sharply as soon as bait touches down - repeat back to boat. Almost every 30"" + walleye I got in 2022 was on this bait/method when searching for fish. GL"
6720679,andreindy,2023-03-06 18:57:00,308,"Everyone, I think one of the key variables (struggles) when I really think about it and that is influencing my strategies with the new guys and how to incorporate your advice comes down to boat control and positioning. We are at a fly-in with 14ft Naden's and 9.9 Merc 4 strokes. And there are times where one of them has to control their own boat. No trolling motors and no anchors (unless we make or bring them ourselves). So stationary fishing is difficult because you are constantly drifting where the wind pushes you. Working on teaching them how to motor ahead and drift properly...I set a couple marker buoys out on spots and you motor to the first marker and drift back to the second and then repeat. I think bottom bouncing was difficult for them because of speed and boat control. The slowest the boats idle down to is about 2.1 to 2.3 MPH. And with wind and slack and angles, they had a difficult time keeping the line the way it should be."
6717695,Mojo-NC,2023-02-26 12:57:00,1929,"I looked up Saga on the website and they already have a lot of information posted there about the lake along with a printable pdf map of the lake that is already marked. Print some copies before you go and have them laminated to make them waterproof. Ask the outfitter where the good spots are located. They're not a secret - they want you to be successful and come back another year. I would focus at first on the areas identified on the map, at least until you get a good feel where the fish are hanging out and what depth you are catching most of your fish. Expect the fish to be fairly deep in mid-late July. I would predict that the majority of the walleyes to be in 15-25 FOW for the most part during the day, but that's for you to confirm once you get there. I like to pull spinner rigs, floating jigs, or plain hooks with crawler or minnow along fishy looking areas anywhere deep water comes close to the shoreline. I don't use bottom bouncers but instead I use a Lindy No-snag sinker or a bullet weight just heavy enough to keep it down in the depth you are fishing (weight, beads, barrel swivel, leader). I rig it like a Carolina-rig with about a 4' fluoro or mono leader. Back troll along the shorelines and pay attention to the depth where you catch most of your fish, and make a mental note of any significant drop-offs. Jig any areas where you catch multiple fish while pulling spinner rigs. If you find a rocky point, focus on the depth where you've been catching most of your fish. Don't ignore deeper water humps that come up to the magic fish catching depth. Once you find a concentration of fish, jig 'em up. If it is too windy to hold on your spot with a camp boat, you can drive up into the wind, drop anchor, and slowly let out just enough anchor line to hold you on the desired spot. That method eliminates the need for more precise boat control and can get a newbie a lot of fish. i prefer crawlers over minnows during mid-summer, but both work. Good luck!"
6717707,NWwalleye,2023-02-26 13:10:00,223,"Any new lake . I concentrate on main lake points and Islands. All the while looking for humps, reefs and of course weeds ."
6717727,NM_Trout,2023-02-26 14:31:00,1094,"#1 : have a very open conversation with your host. Let them know it is a new lake, and you have noobs. Remind your host of when you are coming in, and ask for best lures for that time of year. Ask for a pdf of a chart of hotspots from them. #2 : If someone is on the lake before you, get to know them before you arrive. Your host will likely pass your email info on to them so you can introduce yourself. We always do this, and have cultivated good friendships with folks we would have never met otherwise. Ask them to leave you an updated hot spot chart and best lures when they leave. You may get the good fortune of meeting them at either the camp or the float plane dock. Keep a copy of the lake chart with you and pick their brain if possible. Things are usually moving pretty fast at the dock, so there might not be too much time. #3 : Look for the major spots where the water enters the lake, and where it leaves the lake. This always seems to be a major baitfish collection point, and the bigger fish will be there if the water is not too shallow / warm. #4 : If the lake has enough water flowing into it, go to the upstream side, drop your jigs, and let the boat drift. The flow of the water will likely carry you over the fish. #5 : As mentioned already here, fish the windy side of the lake. The waves aerate the water, and the bait blows up towards that side. Look for a point on the windy side. #6 : Don't be afraid to prospect a little with your fish finder. Spend 30 minutes cruising around the lake, about 30-50 feet from shore, and look for channels and structure, and especially echos from fish :-)#7 : Bring a little bait with you. Meat helps. Once you figure it out, you can forego the bait. #8 : July you will have some weeds. Fish the weeds with a floating rapala or a frog. It is a hoot. My favorite colored plastics are electric chicken, green and white, chartreuse and white, perch imitation, and a pure white / metalflake for night. 3.5"" to 4"" plastics. I always keep a whole lot of 1/4 and 1/8oz jig heads in flourescent pink, and some in chartreuse. BTW, I have not tried Mepps #4 and #5 spinners but will do so this year as I hear they can be fantastic. You probably already know this... but bring super glue to glue the plastic to the jig head. Also good to have when somebody gets sliced by a pike tooth :-)Good luck! Kudos to you for bringing new folks into this."
