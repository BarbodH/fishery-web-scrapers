6722251,gmattbruin,2023-03-11 09:27:00,174,"This is definately the lodge Howard owned. Does this new owner also own the cabin up the arm of Aba? It was always Howards as well. Nice spot, nice beach area. Cabins there had fallen in disrepair"
6722255,Eckohlt,2023-03-11 09:32:00,3685,"Yup,it's livable now so June when your there you might have more company,it is a nice sand beach."
6722263,Tr-eye-fecta,2023-03-11 10:20:00,72,They were very responsive to emails/inquiries. Seem nice. Just decided on going elsewhere...not because of them.
6722267,RichA$1970,2023-03-11 10:25:00,1159,"Just wish they had pictures of the cabinsbased on the former owner’s standards, boats and area as the website really doesn’t show much. Once again if I had a business I would fill my website with as many pictures to advertise what I have. I know a camera can do wonders but not a picture I could find of what does the cabins look like. Their pricing doesn’t make sense either as they have May & June package rates and then after June it’s like $175/day…is that for 1 person as that’s more than what they May/June or for 2.Still looks like a good option & will be good to read any reports from this year."
6722287,danvan18$,2023-03-11 11:11:00,67,Yes I agree as I'm looking at a second trip in September and many of the Nakina area outfitters have very good rates for a week with the exchange rate. Some of the cabins may be a bit more rustic than what I'm used to but the fishing will likely make up for that.
6722293,Eckohlt,2023-03-11 11:27:00,3685,"Dan go check them guys out this fall,I'd like to find out the results when your back!!your spoiled with that nice Otatakan cabin.hahaha"
6722299,danvan18$,2023-03-11 11:36:00,67,"Yes you are right what a great cabin! Looking at Melchett wtih BFO, I think you may be going there in June. Problem is getting guys to commit even with more of us retired now. Really enjoyed Keike in the fall in 2021."
6722305,Eckohlt,2023-03-11 12:00:00,3685,"Going there June 15 to melchett,three guys I went with to wapesi didn't want to go anywhere this year,so your right getting bodies is getting tougher,doesn't matter to me I'll go alone somewhere if I have to."
6722341,RichA$1970,2023-03-11 15:50:00,1159,Looking forward to hearing more on the Nakina area as it seems overlooked & not as traveled. One thing for sure is Pigeon River is the easiest & quickest border crossing I’ve done.
6722987,LittleBait,2023-03-13 20:36:00,37,"The lodge on OSullivans has decent cabins good price also, drive to also"
6721807,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 19:02:00,3685,Anybody booked with these new resort owners on O'Sullivan lake near nakina??
6721823,adempsey2.0,2023-03-09 19:58:00,611,"We ran into the owners last year? year before? in Nakina? I forget where, at some air base. Seems like two down to earth dudes working to make their dream come true. Would also be curious as to how they are making out with renovations etc.."
6721835,RichA$1970,2023-03-09 20:58:00,1159,"Nakina area seems to be the low cost option & if their rates are in CAD, wow that’s a great deal."
6721865,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 05:55:00,3685,"I talked to one of the owners last sept,I was fishing Abamasagi and they have a outpost on that lake also,he was working on there outpost,nice guy,so I think there doing lots of upgrades,I hope someone from WC goes to there resort on O'Sullivan I wanna hear about it!"
6721867,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 05:57:00,3685,"I think nakina area going to pull in more fisherman,I'll be one of them!!"
6721871,Bill Krejca,2023-03-10 06:01:00,6107,"The camp is not on the lake, but up the river which runs in to it, around a mile? trying to remember, it has been a few years since we boated up to/by it. At that time, the camp looked rather neglected/junky grounds. I assume the new owners have been busy doing repairs, so it could end up OK. Since the camp is on the river, and surrounded by the forest, chances are, with little wind hitting it, that bugs could be a problem. The water area on O'S is neat, and can offer some good fishing. Bill"
6721873,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 06:09:00,3685,"Bugs won't bother me when I go,the snow might bother me.haha"
6721879,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 06:18:00,3685,If they would only build a McDonalds in nakina!
6722241,gmattbruin,2023-03-11 09:09:00,174,"This sorta new lodge, is this the one Howard and Elsie owned? More near the river?"
6722249,Eckohlt,2023-03-11 09:24:00,3685,"Right on the river Glenn,I talked to the owner he was at Abamasagi last sept,he was working on there outpost down in the corner there,nice guy n hard worker,so maybe Howard's old resort will take on a new look!!"
