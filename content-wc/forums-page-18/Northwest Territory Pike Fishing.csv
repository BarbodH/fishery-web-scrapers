6723269,reelpro1,2023-03-14 14:18:00,20,"Kipawa Quebec A drive to location with many accomodation options. There are many ""back lakes"" here that get virtually zero fishing - Gator pike in them. Some you would think twice about swimming in. When you reel in a Pike and see a dozen of his friends swimming with him up to the boat - like Smallmouth Bass do often. 4 1/2 hr drive to location from Toronto Ontario. Or 1 hr from North Bay Airport."
6723283,prov1800,2023-03-14 15:12:00,5010,Those are great numbers and great sized fished.I suspect those sized fish came from cooler waters where they were shallow.Thats what makes those waters so good.If you would of or maybe did I don't know but ice out in NWO will produce fish like that also as that cold water is what big pike like.We do have them here.Basically no one fishes for them much and when gets caught it's usually accidental while fishing for a different species.Once water here warms up those big hogs go deep.When I had guests willing to try for them deep on structure where walleyes were we had no problem catching them on fairly big sucker rigs but would be very hard due to water Temps to catch them shallow.I do fish a certain lake which is a river system and has good current which helps with pike as water Temps stay cooler and a lot of prey fish hang out in these current areas which produce some beautifull fish among smaller ones.Just need to fish a bit harder and pick your spots fishing more south.Numbers are not a problem with smaller fish they are everywhere.

6723375,LittleBait,2023-03-14 19:33:00,37,You have to be able to fish them or also pay for guide everyday to have same opportunities. Bid plaus is a short distance from most of the Midwest!
6622976,Nebraskafisher,2022-01-07 09:57:00,1,Looking for some good lakes oand lodges to go Pike Fishing this June/July. Any input greatly appreciated. We are looking for a fly in . TIA
6622980,Knutson21,2022-01-07 10:08:00,348,I went to Lac La Matre in 2018 and it was by far the best Pike Fishing I have ever encountered.
6622996,bthomas3333,2022-01-07 10:59:00,465,I have fished 3 of the places on GSL and missed out on a 4th due to COVID / Flooding.My trip reports on walleye central are here:Taltsonhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ght=Trout+RockTrout Rockhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...light=FrontierFrontierhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...light=FrontierSome other options are Plummers location on GSL and Aurora Nights. Aurora sustained a major flood and may well not be in business until 2023.If you want pike and you want comfort Trout Rock is excellent. If you want fishing on your own schedule with less amenities I would suggest Taltson Bay. Frontier is a better multiple species location. It has good Pike / Very good trout / very good grayling.These trips are pricey but amazing experiences in beautiful country.Enjoy.Brett
6623188,dhottle,2022-01-08 07:41:00,163,"I have fished the Taltson when Arthur Beck owned it. Also fished Lake Lac La Marte & Plummers Great Slave lodge. All three offer good numbers & a good shot at fish over 46"". I fished lake Athabasca from Lakers Unlimited camp for over a dozen trips. Athabasca is located in both Alberta & Saskatchewan just a little south of the old Northwest Territory. My biggest pike came from Athabasca at 32lbs."
6623544,prov1800,2022-01-09 09:31:00,5010,Just as a alternative to the high priced up north fishing for pike and Lakers some of the fisherman that can't afford those kind of places and are interested in pike/trout trips I'd suggest looking into Anishinabi Lake Lodge owned and operated by Clarks outposts.Ive had the great pleasure of having fished it a few times.Awesome pike lake and trout fishery plus some world class smallmouth bass with short portage lakes to walleye.1/4 of the price from the northern trips and pretty close to same fishing.Small island on Crystal clear Anishinabi Lake with 4 cabins only spread out over the island with a main lodge and tgey also have a cabin at other end of the lake which sits by itself if you like to be on your own.Great Crestline 17 ft boats making your trip even more comfy. Lake reaches 300 ft deep.Stunning area.My personal favorite fishing for pike..Only 15 min scenic flight from there base on Cedar Lake.Have not been tgere since pandemic started so camp has had no fishing since.But will be awesome this coming season.Any info needed just pm I can give you most details.
6722981,Franco,2023-03-13 20:26:00,107,"I did a half day guided trip right out of Yellowknife Bay last year before we headed to Plummer’s. Between my son and I we probably got 20-25 pike in about 3 hours of fishing, including a 25 lb 43” and a few over 30”. Seemed to us there were lots and lots of pike everywhere up there."
6722985,LittleBait,2023-03-13 20:29:00,37,Talston not a plush place but you would probably catch more m40+ there with 5-15 minute boat rides. One added place could be Trout Rock
6723033,Moosebunk,2023-03-14 07:01:00,211,"Remember Jack Penny's articles from back in the day with Esox Angler magazine. Jack spent a lifetime in pursuit of pike up north, taking several trips a year and sometimes into remote places that later became accessible, outfitted fisheries. Mid 2000's he would have written at the time, 1. Alaska - Midnight Sun 2. Talston Bay 3. Spring Bay with Lakers Unltd. on Athabasca. Somewhere in that top five was Trout Rock too. A friend went there and reported how amazing it was. Recently a buddy took a job in Fort Resolution and has offered me a contract there this summer. We're talking of slipping over to the Taltson for about a week around second week of July. Anyone who's been there at that time, would love to hear a little about their experience. Otherwise, I'm with prov1800 on this one. Wouldn't ever spend big bucks on pike with Ontario having so many great options for half the price or less. Save that $$$ for the giant lakers, arctic char, maybe salmon or white sturgeon..? Had a single afternoon a few years back, actually just 2.5 hours when my wife and I in our boat and our two friends in theirs, found a loaded spot and put 17 over 40 inches in our boats. That day a 46.5 was best but we'd return some time later, catch a few less in the same timeframe that were over 40 but, get a 49, 48 and another 46.5."
6723049,Sylvanboat,2023-03-14 07:24:00,94,I have also been to Lac LaMartre. 15 pounders are routine. You have a real shot at a 25 pounder. They also have lake trout. Good luck
6723129,bthomas3333,2023-03-14 10:51:00,465,"Based on 4 trips a year to more remote locations(NWT/SK/AK/MB) and 30+ years of fishing NW ON, it sounds like you caught it just right. I've had those sessions but never in 30+ years in NW ON. Ive had many of those days in NWT / SK / AK. Best single day for 4 people was in AK and we had 59+ over 40 and 232 for the week. Brett"
