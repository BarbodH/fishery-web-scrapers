Just make sure that wound heals up pretty well before grabbing another one. I¬íve had some pretty bad ones when saltwater fishing and the infection rate can be really dangerous due to the high bacteria content in the warmer water. We would have to get pumped up with shots and pills of antibiotics to stave off any serious infections. Best wishes, PjShorthorn"

6602130,prov1800,2021-10-08 07:03:00,5010,Went up to Cedar yesterday to go load up my boat around noon and figured I'd cast a couple of hrs first.My third cast brought a good fish to the boat and after 3 figure 8s she bit my lure.Had a tough time getting her in the net by myself but finally got her in.Took a couple of selfies and when i was going to put her back in the water she thrashed pretty hard and jumped out of my hands and tore my thumb up pretty good.Patched my self up and headed back to dock tied up and drove to the clinic in Vermilion Bay and got stitched up.Whoa.Not sure what happened allthough I did see a missing hook on one of my treble.Beautfull fish and I'll heal up soon.
6602156,Cover Dog,2021-10-08 08:05:00,300,OUCH‚Ä¶ that had to hurt and put a halt to a good day of fishing. Might be a little hard if you have to thumb the reel.
