6720885,Bill Krejca,2023-03-07 09:52:00,6107,"I seem to remember the name, means walleye, I think, is it on the Hanson Road, or up toward Pelican Narrows? I do know I didn't fish it, tho. Bill"
6720949,prov1800,2023-03-07 12:10:00,5010,Your right Bill.French for walleye.Wonder what the French word is for pickerel which is actually the proper name.
6720965,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 12:36:00,3685,"I always hear the French say Bonjour,that must mean pickerel."
6721515,Bill Krejca,2023-03-09 05:28:00,6107,"My guess at bonjour would be ""good trip"", but my Czech heritage never taught me any French, although I had a couple years of HS Latin, like a hundred years ago. Bill"
