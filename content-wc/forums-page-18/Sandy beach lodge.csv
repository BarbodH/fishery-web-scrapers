It's kind of sad, but we're tired of the run down conditions and staying in cabins from the Fifties. We were thinking of going to sandy beach lodge. Does anyone have any recommendations or experience with them? We're looking for a fly in with good trout, northern and walleye fishing. House keeping or American plan. Would consider other fly-ins too. thanks"

6719173,Spurgery,2023-03-02 20:28:00,79,Only been to trout lake once. Stayed at cat island lodge. Wasn’t impressed with the sleeping cabins but the lodge itself was fine. Have heard Boois has the nicest accommodations but more expensive. Trout lake is clear water. Big pike and good numbers of 20-23 inch walleyes. Didn’t catch the pigs we typically do in stained lakes but the consistency of 20-23 inches was crazy. Lots of lake trout too. I wanna go back someday.

Walleye and pike fishing is great. Not considered a trout lake but there are some big ones. Trout don't seem to be reproducing so it's release only."

Seeing as though no one else can come up with an answer, you might be right! Maybe people brought smelt up as bait in the 70s and 80s. Any other theories? I thought it could have something to do with insufficient lake Temps during spawning due to climate change."
