I've never wanted to pull my trailer that far, but have stayed across the lake at Five Lakes Lodge and it always looked like a nice set up for RVs. Some of the other resorts on the chain also have trailer hookups, but this place was originally designed for RV sites and not as an add on."

6718093,Latecatchr,2023-02-27 19:49:00,11,I was wondering if it was safe to leave fishing gear in the boat at night since there was a camp site so close. Anyone have any input ?
6718121,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-02-28 00:55:00,358,My philosophy is to take the gear in if there is a chance it can be stolen. Losing all your gear means the end of your fishing trip.

6718145,RichA$1970,2023-02-28 05:31:00,1159,I’d carry the main items in if your in a new area. For me it’s only 2-3 rods & a small 2 tray tackle box. Just depends how much crap you pack.
6718187,prov1800,2023-02-28 06:54:00,5010,If I guide at any camp and happen to do a few days whether iam in a camp boat or my own I always leave my gear in the boat.Guys I guide always ask me if it's safe.i tell them I have never had a problem.Just take my back pack out so I can load it up again with snacks and water.

6716585,Ikedcr,2023-02-22 13:48:00,4,"I have done many fly-in NW Ontario trips over the years but never a drive-in camp. This year I am changing it up to looking for a drive-in camp. My wife has never fished up there so we would like to combine a week fishing in NW Ontario with another week of visiting the Canadian Rockies, Banff etc. We have a mid-size travel trailer and would like to find a drive-in lodge that has campsites and a boat to rent. It turns out it is hard to find fishing lodges that have campsites. Walleyes are the focus, however, other species would be pursued if there. Thinking July or August. We are flexible on dates. Any and all recommendations or thoughts on good fishing lodges that also have camping spots would be appreciated. Thanks, Ike"
