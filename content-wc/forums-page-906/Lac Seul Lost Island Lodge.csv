Anyone who mentions the Vermilion River hasn't been there!)Just like all the good ones though, it's hard to get into due to repeat clients."
526420,TeeDub,2003-01-18 22:59:00,48,"You're obviously not real familiar with the area either Karl..... otherwise you'd be well aware that the ""Vermillion"" referred to, was Big Vermillion Lake NOT Vermillion River. Deer Path Lodge is located on Big Vermillion, maybe 4 miles at most to a Lac Seul boat launch. You're right.... not even near..... if you're walking!"
526421,Karl,2003-01-19 15:14:00,63,"Excuse me, since when did Big Vermilion Lake stop flowing into the Vermilion River? Or have they changed the name in the last month or so?Geography 101 my friend."
526418,Guest,2003-01-25 20:43:00,0,"This is a super camp, if you can get in! Our party visited the camp in August 2001 and liked it very much. Unfortunately, we have tried to get in for the last 2 years with no success. They are booked solid for the next year by the time they leave camp in October. Remember this, they do no fishing shows and do minimal ads, but are booked solid every year.Our party has found out the hard way that MOST of the camps that come to fishing shows do so because their return business rates are very low. The successful camps do not need fishing shows because parties return year after year. Lost Island Lodge is in this group.The only negatives that i see of the camp are small cabins and HEADS that located at a central location on the island."
526408,Noel,2003-01-12 19:51:00,115,have any of you been to this camp and what was your experience with it. I checked their website but the information was sparse. Thanks for your help.
526409,Guest,2003-01-13 14:00:00,0,Heard nothng but good things about it but they are booked for the summer months. We tried to call and resevre something about two weeks ago.
526410,Guest,2003-01-13 23:10:00,0,"My buddy and I were fortunate to get into g roup that goes there twice a year. We go on the fall trip. The place is top notch. Great food, hospitality, the guides are a stitch and cabins clean. This group books two trips per year for 5 years in advance. You need a letter from the pope to get on the waiting list. There now you've got me dreaming till next September, thanks alot. I just quit thinking what a great trip we had this past Sept. P.S. the fishing is fantastic, we boated well over 100 walleyes in the 22'to28"" class."
526411,Noel,2003-01-14 14:55:00,115,"Hey, thanks for the info. I will have to call them and get on the waiting list. Sounds like the waiting list for Packer season tickets."
526412,IaDave,2003-01-14 15:36:00,476,"Why get on a waiting list when there are plenty of other places to stay and still fish Lac Seul. Of course everybody has their favorite places to stay as I do,but I have also gone and stayed at a motel just because I wanted to fish Lac Seul. I have never not gone because the place where I like to stay is booked. Just an opinion."
526413,Noel,2003-01-14 18:22:00,115,"Well Dave, perhaps you can suggest some others to try in the southwest area around Hudson. I just can't find many. thanks."
526414,jimbo,2003-01-14 19:04:00,223,Try Deer Path Lodge. Not fancy but wonderful people that run it. Give Rick or Evelyn a call at 807 737 1050. Tell them jim in South Dakota told you. No I am not employeed by nor get any compensation for any of this.RespectfullyJimbo
526416,Guest,2003-01-15 06:20:00,0,"Noel,You can stay at a ton of places in Sioux lookout and only be 10 miles to the Hudaon landing.Plus then you can fish on Vermillion or Minnitaki"
526417,IaDave,2003-01-15 07:16:00,476,"Noel- I think you took my reply the wrong way. Jabs is right there are places around Sioux Lookout. Check out Winoga Lodge,Frog Rapids Lodge, Red Pine Lodge, Anderson's Lodge, Lac Seul Outposts. All of them have easy access to Lac Seul and other lakes but it would be a little of longer boat ride. if you have any questions e-mail me. Good luck with your search."
526415,TeeDub,2003-01-15 14:40:00,48,"Hey Jimbo! I think I recommended Deer Path to you a few years back. I'm glad you enjoyed it! Rick and Evelyn are indeed good folk and no...... I don't get any compensation either. Very little respect either, come to think of it!I'm hoping to get back there this summer myself!"
