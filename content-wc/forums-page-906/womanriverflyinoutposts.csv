Went to Shabumuni Lake twice, good walleye fishing in July.Caught several in 28 inch range Also went to Berthold Lake,many walleye up to 5 lbs ,but also lots of pike. Caught a 42 and 41 inch pike the year we went there. Gawleys who now owns Women River runs a good ship so you should have a great trip if you go there"

The cabins were great fishing was very good. Kapikik is a big lake very nice cabin the only one on the lake lots of water a couple of rivers one in one out to fish. Lots of walleye 17"" to 20"" and big norhtern up to 40"".McVicar is very nice with a beautiful cabin and a nice portage lake(Lang) with lots of walleye 19""-24"". Aerial is a small lake with good walleye fishing and a nice cabin.Cannon is also a small lake with a lot of walleyes.My favorite is McVicar with Kapikik second.Gawley flys out of Ear Falls (Lac Seul) much nicer than driving the old road 31 miles."
