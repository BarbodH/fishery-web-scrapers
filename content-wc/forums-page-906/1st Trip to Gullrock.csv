We had good fishing(lots of numbers but no monsters)and because the fishing was so good we didn't venture out more than 3-5 miles from camp. Didn't have GPS with me but most locations are off Islands or points, with one mid-lake hump that a GPS would help on. I'll be happy to show when we are there or could get you close on a map. Lots of guys who fish Gullrock frequent this board so would expect you'll get lots of help. My e-mail is [email protected], lets visit. By the way if you like to golf your just 10 min away from a very pretty course...makes a nice break for an afternoon or two."
526888,Guest,2003-01-24 12:07:00,0,Hello LarryI have been going to Gullrock for five years now and stay at Five Lakes Lodge. You can pretty much pick any wind shoreline with structure to catch fish on the rock piles. Bud the owner will mark a map for you based on where the fish were biting. He usually keeps a pulse on where fish are being caught the week before. Our first year we never had any problems catching fish. My preferred method is a jig and minnow. I know other presentations work but that is what we mainly use. I do have some GPS points you can email me at [email protected]Jeff
