526718,Guest,2003-01-20 12:56:00,0,"I just booked a week at Witch Bay Camp for the first week in July for my daughter and me. Boy, am I excited. If anyone has some info or hints on how to fish it this time of year I would appreciate it. Thanks."
526719,Vitreum,2003-01-20 15:27:00,221,check out this site. he knows that area like the back of his hand. http://www.justfishontario.com/disc54_toc.htm
526720,Guest,2003-01-21 13:53:00,0,"I fished with the guy who runs http://www.justfishontario.com when he ran and developed their fishing program. He put us on some great fishing, taught us how to find spots, bottom bounce, and exercise better boat control. I wish he was still there but it is a great place to go. Very secluded and the owners do care about their guests. I give it a thumbs up."
526721,Guest,2003-01-21 15:15:00,0,"One of the strengths of Witch Bay is their fishing program and the Pros they have on staff to help you with locations, lures and presentations. They will put you on fish!"
526722,Guest,2003-01-21 18:18:00,0,It would sure be nice if the owner's would stop posting stuff on this board. Why don't you bye a banner instead of trying to get free advertising!!!Rip some LipNFR
526723,2746,2003-01-21 19:55:00,3206,"If your talking about me I live in Iowa and certainly don't own a camp or have any interest in one....just know about witch bay. Didn't mean to ""trip anyone's trigger"" just trying to be helpful."
526727,Guest,2003-01-22 05:06:00,0,"I've only fished there once, but I loved the place (no, I don't work there). We were at the camp the summer of 01, in mid July. Fishing were in usual summer patterns, deep reefs and humps. Bottom bouncers and crawlers worked pretty well. So did your basic slip sinker rig with a floating jighead and a leech. However, the strangest part was this big fish pattern up on the rocks. If you talk to anyone who's been there, you will hear all about it-it's like they can't get enough of this, and frankly it seemed like they were pushing it almost too hard. But, we finally tried it on the last day for just a couple hours and it did get me two fish: 25.5 and 27.5, sooooo. . .Anyway, the trick is to find places were rocks come almost to the surface (1-4 feet), but don't actually come out, i.e. no islands. Generally the easiest way to to look at your map, and find places marked with navagational buoys. Position your boat just outside the rocks, and anchor if necessary. Tie on a No. 9 Shap Rap (color didn't seem to matter, but I used perch-however, the size does matter: a No. 9 is really the ticket). Cast up over the roacks and begin reeling until you feel the Shad Rap hit the rocks. Stop reeling then and just slowly pull your rod or sweep it to the side, feeling the Shad Rap scrape and wiggle through the rocks. Then slowly return your rod tip out in front of you while you reel up the slack, and repeat. When you feel the bait start to get hung up, give it some slack, and it will hopefully back out for you. Most of the strikes come on the pause as you reel up the slack. Then hang on, because its almost guaranteed to be a big fish. Have a supply of the Shap Raps, because you will lose some. If the day is clear and and windless, you may actually be able to sight fish for them. One of the guys in camp spent a day doing this when we had temps in the high 90's, and was sight fishing for fish. He caught two that day over 30"". One was 33.5"". Never thought it would work, but it does.Good luck, and have a good time.Bill"
526728,brian1785,2003-01-22 22:01:00,1534,"Very good advice Bill. I've been up there twice with my wife and daughter and we just love it. Their fishing program is awesome. They will put you on the fish, no questions. And, that shallow water pattern was definitely the ticket each year we were there. We're going back again this year. We always go the first week of August. Little warm but the weather is usually very stable and the fish are pretty predictible."
526724,bellbuoy,2003-01-23 19:46:00,490,"Dear Nestor Falls Resident:I've been on this board most every day for the past 6 years. To date, I cannot recall a single post by Gail or Steve Hockett, the owners of Witch Bay Camp. I consider the Hockett's friends of mine and do not ejoy seeing their name or reputation impugned.I posed a question back in November about Crawford's Camp on Crow Lake. Here is the response from Nestor Falls Resident:""You could go to Crawford's if you want. There are much better places to go if you want the beach and LOTW. Try Hanson's Wilderness Lodges they have a lodge on both lake and nicer cabins with better guest services. The road LOTW from Crawford's is long and in bad shape and once you get there you have to drive so far before you get to good fishing in the spring and summer. At Hanson's you can stay at both resorts and both have beaches, Canoes and Kayaks are provided for no extra charge check it out http://www.hansonslodges.com/""I did not ask about Hanson's Lodges nor did I want to know about Hanson's Lodges. Now you someone is asking about Witch Bay Camp and you are making false accusations about the owners of Witch Bay Camp.You have also made an accusation against ""Jimmy"" in the Whitefish Bay Camp post on 1/21/03. It reads:""Funny how I think this is the same guy as last year posting saying it's his frist trip to Whitefish Bay!!! Funny how that happens. Buy a banner.Rip some LipNFR""In the past three months, you have made three posts all relating to camps on or near LOTW. All negative, and in one post you recommend Hanson's Lodge. It would appear that you may have a bias and possibly have more than a casual interest.I have taken the liberty of reporting your posts to Scott Golden. Perhaps Whitefish Bay Camp and Witch Bay Camp aren't the one's who should buy an advertising banner.BellbuoyP.S. Isn't also funny that you've never taken the time to register.Bellbuoy"
526725,2746,2003-01-24 08:22:00,3206,Good response bellbouy. You did your homework...wasn't sure what I had stepped in.
