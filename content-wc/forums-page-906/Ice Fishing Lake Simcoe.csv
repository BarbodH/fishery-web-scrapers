Maybe by this weekend the ice will be thick enough and there will finally be some Lakers caught along with some big pike as well. Does anybody else on this site fish Lake Simcoe in the winter??It's a first class fishery, as long as the weather co-operates...lately it's been nothing but mild winters."
526839,Guest,2003-01-24 08:43:00,0,The lake is froze over now and fishing is good.We caught over 100 Huge perch last staurday between 2 of us and it looks like were in for a great fishing winter this year.My buddy has been out all week in 70' of water using a jigging rapala and has caught some nice lakers but only a few whitefish. Just need to find the whitefish and were all set.

I've been doing ok at Beaverton and Virginia Beach but nothing great. Have you been drilling your own holes or have you been renting a hut??Maybe I'll see you out on the water some day next week. If you let me know whereabouts you fish, I'll stop by and say hello. Tight lines..."
