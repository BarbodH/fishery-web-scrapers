526798,Guest,2003-01-22 17:10:00,0,I am thinking about lining up a trip for my son & I in june or july. I know the walleye fishing is good but would like to do some northern fishing also. How is the lake for numbers and size that time of year. Anybody know of a muskie lake nearby that is any good that I could trailer to for a day? Thanks!

For numbers, we hit the weedy bays and outside corners of the channels.I'm a very big guy (6'4"" - 300lbs+), I make any fish look small, but look at these pictures from one of my trips to Gullrock.http://www.torgerud.com/Photos/Photo...shing\Canada99(you'll have to paste the whole line into your browser :P )I haven't fished it, but I hear that Lac Seul is an even better lake.Good luck and have fun up there!- Rick"

I have fished Gullrock for the past 20 years but it has always been during August. Our party fishes strictly for trophy northern and we do very well year in and year out. We don't catch great numbers, between 5-10 in the middle to upper 30"" range and occasionally a 40+"". I have boated a 42"" and my brother has boated a 44"" out of Gullrock as well. We fish the deep weed edges in the evening. We spend some time fishing for them so it's not like you will pull right into a spot and start catching fish. Put in your time and you will get rewarded.Good luck and have fun it's a great lake!!!Renn"
