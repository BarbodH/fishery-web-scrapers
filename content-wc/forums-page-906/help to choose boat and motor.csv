526543,Guest,2003-01-17 16:07:00,0,"I am looking at purchasing a new 12 foot aluminum boat, motor and trailer. I have looked at a couple of deals: one is a 12 Princecraft Ungava with 8 hp Yam 4 stroke; the other is a Lund wc-12 with 8 hp Honda.Any opinions or experiences on these 2 boats would be appreciated.Any thoughts on whether the 8 hp motor is adequate for these boats?All comments are appreciated. Thanks"

526545,Guest,2003-01-19 01:06:00,0,"You really might consider going with a 14ft boat instead of a 12ft.You'll find the extra 2 feet make a huge difference. By the way, those 8hp motors are more than adequate for the 12ft and would probably be fine for a 14ft as well, however, a 9.9 on a 14ft would be my way to go. Just my couple of cents."
526546,Guest,2003-01-19 13:45:00,0,"I agree, 14 foot, 9.9 honda, yamaha, or suzuki, get a used rig and save some money."
526547,Guest,2003-01-20 16:32:00,0,what is your reason for a 12 footer with a 8hp? are you fishing lakes with horsepower restrictions? a new lund 12 footer with a 8 hp 4 stroke$$$$ You could get a nearly new 14 footer with say a 15-25 hp for roughly the same money i suspect
526548,Guest,2003-01-21 10:39:00,0,"I have a 12 mirrocraft, with a 15 hp. Would be good with a 9.9.If I had to choose again, I would look hard at a 14'. The 12 getspretty cramped if you have an extra gas can, 2 guys, tackle, etc.My brother in law has a 14' grumman with a 25 merc...fast, roomy.Definitely go for the 14 if you can afford it."
526549,billybob,2003-01-21 13:52:00,6,thanks for all your comments and suggestions. I'll consider what's been said in light of what/where I plan to use the boat.Appreciate it.
526550,Guest,2003-01-21 22:08:00,0,"Look at the 14 foot LUND WC 14 DLX, it has a flat floor."
526551,Guest,2003-01-24 10:35:00,0,"You may also want to look at Alumacraft. They have a real nice 12 footer. Nice hull material. I, too, would suggest you look at a 14 footer. I've had both and the 14' did the job a lot better. I believe the 8 hp would be fine for either of them. Lund's smaller boats seem pretty nice, too. There is some real junk out there in this size range. But Alumacrafts and Lunds are both very good. Can't speak to Princecraft. Good luck."
