Some superb outpost cabins and lodges are on it.You might want to make some inquiries to the folks at www.birchpointcamp.com, www.nungesserlake.com, or www.lacseul.com.Also check out the message board at www.esoxhunter.com.Who are you booking with? They should be able to provide you with the location of the nearby hotspots."

The pike fishing was not good last year when we went in August. We caught pike, but regardless of lenghth, they were VERY SKINNY and had no girth.The lake has very few bays with structure to fish for pike. We caught most of our pike fishing for walleye. The eastern part of the lake is the best area for pike."

Depending on Ice Out, large northern may be in the river at the East end of the lake. Also check the Coli Creek area. Use dead bait at that time. Once they move out of the creeks they are a little harder to find. Check humps and points closest to the creek areas first. The North Bay area is also worth a try. If they are out of the creeks try spoons, spinners, and Zara Spooks."
