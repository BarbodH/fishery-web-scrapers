526915,Tim,2003-01-25 16:01:00,179,Does anyone out there have any information on this resort. Six of us are looking for a resort for the 2nd week of June. Several resorts in the area are filled already. Any info would be greatly appreciated.
526916,Guest,2003-01-25 18:36:00,0,"Three of us stayed at Scout Lake Resort last May (our first trip to canada)..The cabins are clean, neat and functional. situated not too far from Lac Seul (about 15 mins out of scout to LS)..Good people the boats are decent and had no motor issues..We ended up with a 16ft lund with a 25hp and it got old by the end of the week. They have a limited number of 17ft outfitters with 40's..If you can get one..Get it..If you're looking for the Ritz you're looking at the wrong place. If you're looking for a place to sleep, clean up and relax that's clean and neat you'll be very happy with them. The boats were gassed up early each morning and the minnow buckets filled, never had to wait even once. Roland runs the dock and is a nice guy, but not overly helpful on fishing information..You're pretty much on your own or talk to the other guests..We hired a guide for one day and he was nice but it was not well spent money..We simply followed the stream of boats out of camp to Broand and Sunlight lakes..(about 25mi one way brother..think about it 16' and 25hp..my arm hurt for two weeks after we got home). The guide was strictly a walleye jigger and that's all we did..Caught a lot of fish and some darn nice ones, but so did the other twenty boats working the same spot with us..Not my idea of far north fishing..We freelanced it the rest of the trip..Struggled with walleye at first but caught consistent fish and when we did they were big.. However the third week of may it was tough unless you hit Broad and Sunlight or went North to the other river and creek areas..You had to be where the fish were and they were mostly in the current areas recuperating from spawning. The pike fishing was excellent. My best was a 41 incher (all pike released) and the best in our group and camp that week. They told us at camp that the week before a 48"" pike was caught right across from the camp in a bay and released. Caught a serious number of fish (pike)..one spot gave up 24 straight without a miss all 3-8lbs..My fatherinlaw hooked up a real hog there and got broke off..The fish ran hard and wrapped around some standing timber. probably would have been big fish of the week. But hey you gotta love that..It was a quiet boat ride back that evening! I would have no qualms recommending the place. Matter of fact I'm thinking about returning..We are either going to freelance, stay at Evergreen or Scout Lake..My only drawback about Evergreen is the location..Whole lot of open water if you do run south to fish if it kicks up..We had some serious wind and I was very relieved to make it back to Scout..We fished there when there was serious waveage on LS..Few walleye that time of year, but many, many northern..The guide was helpful in lake info..He really likes the 2nd week of june for all around fishing..Said then the fish are all out of the spawning/staging areas and back in the lake.He Really liked the Bay of Islands that time of year and it's right on the way from Scout Lake to LS..The wind wouldn't be an issue there..I emailed with Lizzie today..I'll make my mind up this week..However I'm for darn sure taking my boat this time..17' pro deep v with a 90hp..Prop wrecking rocks or not. Good luck.."
