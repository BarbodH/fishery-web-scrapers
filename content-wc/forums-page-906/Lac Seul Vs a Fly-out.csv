I don't plan to pull up a boat so we would have to rent a camp boat. I am comfortable with the cost comparisions with either choice.I know they are alot of intangibles that make up this decision. But if you had to choose, what would you do and why?Thanks,Ivy"

526456,Guest,2003-01-14 12:15:00,0,"been to many fly-outs since 1983, some good some not so good. heard so many good things abouy lac seul, decided to try it this year and fore-go the expense of the flying. the only thing that worries me is having all these boats and people around, use to having the lake to ourselves. going last sat. in june, lac seul lodge. hope i made the right decision. doc."

If you are going to be at the Lodge have Dan set you up with one of his 18"" boats and get your self a good GPS and a depth finder. Head to where Dan recommends and drive slow...lots of prop damage areas. Last of June is a good time for Walleye. I would get maps from Dan and go to the Black Bay area. You can fish all the way from McIntyre Bay to Aldous Bay and all the points in between. Fish this area hard and you will catch some awesome Walleye and plenty of them. If you like bring a Pike rod or two and some 1/2 to 3/4 oz spinner baits and hit the weed beds you see that time of year as you move from Walleye Spot to Walleye spot.....it can be toothy critter heaven. Drop me your email address and I will be glad to share some good Walleye areas for end of June. We will be there 2nd week of June........Walleye [email protected]"

526460,Guest,2003-01-25 20:55:00,0,"LacSeul is the place to go walleye fishing. Unless your fly-in is a SUPER pike lake, Lac Seul cannot be beat for walleye. Remember, Lac Seul does have a slot limit for walleyes [18 - 21 inches are throw backs. Only one over 21 inches.]"
