526734,Vitreum,2003-01-20 20:04:00,221,"Just wondering what was the largest for last year. A guy in camp claimed he caught a 53"" Northern. Of course, he was fishing all alone and their group had claimed to catch 3 42 inchers earlier in the week. I don't fish for Northern, but these seem to be monsters. We were fishing out of Ear Falls. Just wondering. These claims seem to be a bit much."
526735,Ryan,2003-01-21 15:46:00,135,"I have fished Lac Seul 5 times with another guy, and our two biggest pike were a 45 and a 42 incher. I was fishing back in India lake, down past scaler, the day after I caught the 45 incher and I saw a fish that was EASILY in the 53 inch range, so I would believe the guy. It made the 45 incher I caught the day before look like a minnow. Before anyone assumes it was a muskie, I got a very good look at the fish and it was clearly a pike."
526736,eyewitness,2003-01-22 23:59:00,680,"Ryan, I've been into China many times but haven't been into India yet. Are there any hazards you need to watch out for going back in there? Does it get deep in there or is it all shallower? China puts out some nice fish but gets hit by a lot of guys. Would love to hear more. If you don't want to post anything in detail here just email me. Thnaks!"
526741,Mike KS,2003-01-23 08:19:00,18,"One of the guys in our group who has always been ""Pike God"" to us caught what he called a trophy Pike a few years back on Lac Seul. It was 57"" long in his mind but 41""on the ruler. We have been on Lac Seul for 15 years and the biggest Pike I can recall was 46"" but tons of 35"" to 40"" girls. Have some days when we Pike fished hard that one boat, two guys would catch 300+ Pike in a 10+ hour day.....We dont fish Pike hard anymore because we are getting older and would rather wear out the Walleye. But every once in a while a 10 to 15 lb Pike will tear you up on a Walleye rod."
526737,fishnut,2003-01-23 08:27:00,46,"I'm confused about China and India lakes. I have been down there past Scaler also but my maps do not name the lakes in there. When you come down the long narrows from Scaler is the lake to your right India and China straight ahead?? If someone has a map with these lakes named and can scan that area and send e-mail I would appreciate it.Thanks,Fishnut[email protected]"
526738,eyewitness,2003-01-23 09:00:00,680,"Your presumtion is correct. The narrows splits at the end. China is pretty much straight ahead and India is to the right going in. If you spend time back there I'd recommend you always go with another boat. it's a long way back to anywhere from there and there's no walking out if you have problems. Case in point. Buddy blew up his new one year old motor a couple years ago just before China. Both of us run big rigs. It was a 2 hour tow to get back to camp and I was doing a reasonable speed. Can't imagine trying to paddle back or wait for someone to come back there. It could actually be days if no one knows where you went. Now we always tell the camp owner where we are headed for the day in case something were to happen. Probably telling you what you already know, but thought it was worth saying it anyway. I have a special place in my heart for that lake and a lot of respect for it as well. I've heard too many bad stories of things gone wrong up there to ignore them. Gosh, now all I can think about is when I'll be back there next.....:-)"
526739,fishnut,2003-01-23 14:04:00,46,"Thanks for the quick reply and info. I agree you don't want to go that far alone. Last year on the way into Scaler I ""found"" the rock on the left. It did a real job on my prop. I did have another or it would have been a long tow. Best luck on Pike was just to the right of the China-Indian split, nothing real big but a 38"" was fun.We are booked for the middle of June and I also am ""chompin at the bit"". This hard water fishing is getting boring.I sure would like to find some Smallies up at that end of the lake. We have done well out of Hudson.Fishnut"
526740,eyewitness,2003-01-23 14:24:00,680,"Funny you said to the right of the split. We did our damage on the left side of the split going into China. Lots of 33-38""ers and I had one take my spoon at the boat and spit it out that dwarfed any we caught. It just plain scared me! Inhaled and spit my Silver Minnow right in front of me, then sat there staring at me. It was definately a pike and not a ski as she turned broadside at the boat and gave em a good long look at her. Conditions were sunny and dead calm. What a rush...Teenage kid caught a 48""er out of there the day prior which was CPRed, measured and verified by their whole group. Also know of a 14.7# eye that was taken back there a couple seasons ago. Sure wish a guy could hard water fish that far in. I'd be on my way tomorrow!"
526742,Vitreum,2003-01-23 17:50:00,221,"mike, that's kinda what i thought. my brother-in-law has fished pike hard on lac seul for 6 years and has yet to boat a 42""er. all of the guys in that group i was referring to are kinda, how shall we say it, bullchyters. good pike fishermen, but have a tendency to stretch the truth."
526743,Guest,2003-01-24 13:05:00,0,"Went to Lac Suel for the first time last year and mainly fished for Walleye. We did spend a few days casting for Northern and caught 3 between 37 and 41 inches so I don't doubt there are much bigger fish in the lake.Unfortunately my son and daughter didn't like the lodge so we ma be headed elsewhere this year, but Lac Suel was the best fishing I have ever had."
