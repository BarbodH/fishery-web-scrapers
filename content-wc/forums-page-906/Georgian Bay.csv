Some of the guys want to give the Georgian Bay (around Pointe Au Baril, maybe) a try this year. Can someone give us some info about walleye fishing in that area during July? How is the deep water walleye fishing in that part of the Bay?Thanks, in advance, for any replies to this request for info.jerryj"

THE MAY TRIP IS FOR NORTHERN'S WITH SOME NIGHT FISHING FOR WALLEYE BEING A BONUS. THE OCTOBER TRIP IS STRICTLY FOR WALLEYE. THIS PAST OCT WE DID EXTREMELY WELL ON WALLEYE. I THINK THEY MAY BE HARD TO LOCATE IN JULY. WE FISH A VERY SHALLOW AREA WITH CURRENT AT NIGHT, WE ALWAYS TROLL SHALLOW DIVING RAPELAS. THE AREA WE TROLL IS ONLY A COUPLE HUNDRED YARD STRETCH. LAST YEAR WE PICKED UP ONE ON EVERY PASS, NO FISH WERE UNDER 5LBS. GOOD LUCK AND POST YOUR RESULTS......."

This is probably due to people hitting rocks. If you bring your own boat an extra prop would not be a bad idea. Also make sure your motor is in the released position. The only reason I haven't been there lately is that my best friend bought an island in the main channel, we rough it in tents, weather can be brutal the time of year we go(always a great time no matter what-lots of memories). I wish I had a map to help you on your first trip, we hired a guide one time just to find more weed beds, it really has paid off. Be careful until you feel you know the area. If you have any questions let me know."
