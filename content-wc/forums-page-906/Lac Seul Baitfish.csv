During July and August we do a high percentage of trolling on flats or 10 foot areas that are at drop off edges. We have had great luck with Shad Rap SRO8 or SRO9 in Perch, Firetiger, Silver and Gold. Once we locate a school we usally will start jigging but if the action isnt good we go back to trolling in hopes of finding more fish."
