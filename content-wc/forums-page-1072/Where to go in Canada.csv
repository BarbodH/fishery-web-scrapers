507780,Guest,2000-05-05 18:57:00,0,"My fiance and I are looking to go fishing early August somewhere in Ontario, crossing at Sioux Ste Marie. Fishing for walleye, pike, or small mouth bass. Quantity of fish is a key, size is a bonus. Will consider boat-in or fly-in options. Any suggestions?? Please e-mail us or post at this site. Thanks!!"
507781,Guest,2000-05-07 12:28:00,0,Arctic Watershed Outposts in Nakina has two smaller sized cabins that hold only four people max and they charge only $20.00 Canadian per person for under four people (sounds to me like only yourself and girlfriend going)I have gone on trips with these people three times already and quite honestly I could not expect to be treated better! These folks are great! I am going to one of the small places May 20(Wayner Lake)and if you like afterwards I could tell you how the fishing was there Their URL is www.nakina.lakeheadu.ca/naklib/awo/main.html and phone number (807) 329-5812

If your looking for trophy fishing for walleye, pike, and trout then you may want to look into it. E-mail me if you want more info. [email protected]. good luck"
507783,Guest,2000-05-13 15:52:00,0,Anyone else have any suggestions??? thanks to the 2 who have given us a idea where to start...
507784,Fred_G,2000-05-15 06:15:00,908,Check out The Old Post & Village on Lake St. Joseph. We are returning for our fourth trip this year and couldn't be happier. Walleye and Pike fishing is fantastic. Their web address is www.oldpost.com. LOL Fred
507785,kingsway,2000-05-20 13:55:00,27,"Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23.Rich"
