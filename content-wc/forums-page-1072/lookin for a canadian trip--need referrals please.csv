507653,BD,2000-05-16 00:55:00,739,"Try Press Lake Camp < www.presslake.on.ca >. The cabins are clean, the prices fair, and the northern and walleye fishing is good. If you can get a larger group togeather try Lake of the Woods Houseboats < www.lowhouseboats.com > out of Reed Narrows (by Sioux Narrows). A 44' houseboat would be the best for a group of from four to six guys."
507654,kingsway,2000-05-20 13:51:00,27,"Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23.Rich"

We have always dreamed of going fishing up in Canada but have been to busy with family to make the time.There's so many lakes up there I don't know where to start. Does someone have a favorite trip to recommend? We are not highrollers. I wouldn't mind towin my own little fishin boat up.We love walleye fishin but wouldn't mind a chance to luck into a big pike. I don't want to hear from resort owners but other folks like myself. Where would you take your Dad?"
507643,Guest,2000-04-19 13:27:00,0,"Great place to take your dad is Separation lakelodge,winter phone is 217 357-3069,lodge is 807 224-4537.The fishing is outstandingsee them on theweb,www.separationlake.com,rates are real good,also.Fished it last year,and going back the week of july 15th,only problem we had was we ranout of cold beer.Its only an hour and a half drive out of Krnora,no need to fly up,drive up too.Pleanty of big walleyes northern and smallmouth.Make your dad happy and try it. Rich"
507644,Jim,2000-04-19 20:17:00,238,"Check out Cedar Lake. It's in Ontario about two hours or so north of Vermillion Bay, so it's not a bad drive. It's not a huge lake, but qood sized nevertheless. Good walleye fishing. Also good populations of muskie, smallies, pike and perch. You can trailer your boat there.There are two or three lodges on the lake, and one is called ""Cedar Lake Lodge"". It's affordable, respectable fishing, and a good place to take your dad. If it's windy, you can still find places to fish and not get blown off the lake, as you can in so many big lakes up there."
507645,Guest,2000-04-20 07:31:00,0,I would highly recommend The Old Post & Village on Lake St. Joseph in NW Ontario. It's a drive to camp. We have been there for the past three years and the fishing improve every year. Last year our group caught hundreds of walleyes and twenty pike over 35 inches in a week. John and Wendy Grace run a top notch lodge and treat their guests extremely well. Check out the website at www.oldpost.com. LOL Fred
507646,Guest,2000-04-20 21:51:00,0,"I would also recommend Separation Lake Lodge north of Kenora. Another suggestion would be a houseboat trip on Lake of the Woods.You canpull your fishing boat behind move to a different island every day . The fishing is excellent, the scenery changes with every mile.I took my 79yr. old father with us a year ago on his first trip to Canada and he had a great time.I would recommend Houseboat Adventures out of Kenora.The owne has a float plane and can be at your houseboat within 15min.in case of emergency or to bring supplies to you.WE did a week fishing trip by houseboat for less than 500.00 apiece including gas,food bait,everyhing!Let me know if you want more info. Bud."

507650,Guest,2000-05-02 10:30:00,0,Check out Holinshead Lake about 90 miles NW of Thunder Bay Ontario. World class fishing for walleye and pike. Cabins are all new and have all the amenities. They have a web site. They like people to practice conservation in the amount of fish they harvest and as a local I like to see this. Good fishing: Frank
507651,Guest,2000-05-02 17:26:00,0,"my family has been going to Abrams/Minitaki for almost 20 years. We have stayed at numerous camps and have selected Tikinagan the last 4 years. Family owned, nice, very nice folks own and operate it. You can fish big water as well as rivers and streams. Their e-mail is [email protected] They have cabins as well as new campsites, take your own boat, rent theirs, your choice. Strongly recommend very deep v.
