507841,Steve,2000-05-19 05:15:00,259,"I fish a favorite hump close to shore (comes up to 9 feet from 40 feet) anchored and using slipsinker rig, motionless like,more or less just hanging it over the boat so the sinker is just touching bottom(like a lindy rig) they can get downright agressive on warm summer nights and if they do i stay anchored and throw a shad rap over the top of the hump. Good luck"

During periods of good moonlight shad raps, risto raps, hot n tots, and bombers all work well for me. When the sky is dark I rely exclusively on rattling cranks, especially the 3/8 ounce rattle tot by Storm. This lure (regardless of finish) flat out rocks. Good luck and try to stay in the 9 to 15 foot range for water depth. Banging bottom with the metal lip also turns them on..."

GO SLOW, fish in about 5-8 feet of water adjacent to deep water while letting out 60 to 100 feet. Off Shore Planer Boards work great with the Flashing Strobe on them too. Finally, make sure your boat is well organized and you know where things are to minimize turning on lights. If you have an electric motor USE IT. Be PREPARED for good things to happen quickly. I caught 3 walleyes all over 8 pounds in 2 hours on the French River when you could not BUY a 16 incher during the day. The old timers were amazed because nobody fishes at night on the French River. This system has worked well in bodies of water I've tried it in. The only BIG problem I've had is tryin to get somebody to fish at night with me. Real spooky at night with big fish on the end of your line."
