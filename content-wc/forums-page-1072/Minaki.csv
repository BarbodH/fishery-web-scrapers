507850,Guest,2000-05-13 12:09:00,0,Anybody have any tips on what to use or where to go in late Augest in Minaki? I have only fished there in the spring.
507851,BILL,2000-05-14 05:13:00,121,"WHAT ARE YOU FISHING FOR???? IF IT IS WALLEYE, TRY THR REEFS IN BIG AND LITTLE SAND. THE PATTERNS IN SUMMER ARE NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN SPRING!!! THE FISH HAVE MOVED A LITTLE DEEPER. I LIKE BOTTOM BOUNCING THE BEST, WITH A NIGHT CRAWLER OR LEECH. JIGGING WITH MINNOWS!! THE MUSKIE FISHING IS HOT!!! I MEAN HOT!! IN SUMMER, YOU WILL HAVE GOOD LUCK IN ROUGH ROCK, EARLY IN THE MORNING OR LATE AT NIGHT. FISH THE NORTHERN UP BY DUCK BAY, LAST YEAR IT PRODUCED A 22 LB, AND IT STILL IS SWIMMING BUT MAYBE A LITTLE BIGGER!! GOOD LUCK. PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW YOU DO.THANKS BILL"
