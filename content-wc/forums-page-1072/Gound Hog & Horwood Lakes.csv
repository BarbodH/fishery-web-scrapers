I haven't been there in 15 years, just thinking about returning in the next couple of years. Is the quality of fishing still good? Would like some info on camps too. Who took over Wades Camp on Horwood? Made my first trip there in 1968.Thanks"

Took it over around 89 0r 90 i think (if thats the one, I only know of two lodges up there). Fishing has been good average walleys,(biggest for me was 7 pounds), smallish pike. But then I go later in year. I heard early in year is good, but then its Canada, so what else is new! Its still pretty country and its Canada at its finest. the Edwards are nice people too, so if ya go tell em Steve said hi. If you need other info e-mail me, cause I dont check here too often. good luck"
