507505,Guest,2000-04-07 09:21:00,0,"Eagle Lake is much more renowned for jumbo pike and muskie than it is for walleye - at least - that's what I've always heard and read. We are talking about the same Eagle Lake, right? Northwest Ontario? Near Vermillion Bay/Dryden?"
507506,Guest,2000-04-21 19:52:00,0,Was at South Shore about 5 yrs ago. We picked up a lot of walleye in Blind Bay by a rock cliff on the opposite side of lake from the entrance. Good luck
