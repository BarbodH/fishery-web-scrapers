507844,Guest,2000-05-12 20:02:00,0,Heading up there next week for season opener. Have never fished there. Can anyone pass on any experiences there? Heard Lake Trout and walleye are good. thanks.
507845,HM,2000-05-15 05:35:00,11,"Have fished this region for over 10 years with varying success. The opener can be a real coin toss depending on the weather. If the spawn is late then fishing tends to be a little spotty. With the weather this year, I would hope the fish have already spawned and may be on a bite. Nice thing about the lake trout is that you can catch them in the shallows 10-20 ft on jigs. Am looking forward to getting up there myself sometime in June. Good luck and good fishing..and stay off teh rocks. By the way, where are you staying?"
507846,Guest,2000-05-15 17:38:00,0,"HM, thanks for the info. Staying at Taggert Bay. Should be good for lakers and walleye this time of year. Bringing lots of jigs and floating rapalas."
507847,Guest,2000-05-16 17:31:00,0,Where is Kipawa located in Quebec?
507848,HM,2000-05-17 04:12:00,11,"Lake Kipawa is located about an hour northeast of North Bay Ontario. The largest town is Temiscaming Quebec. The area if a series of interconnected lakes and rivers. Most of it is only accessible by water or a few old, rough logging roads.On my last trip cell phones still wouldn't work and you can only receive about one or on a good day two radio stations."
