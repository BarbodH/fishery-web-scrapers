507904,Guest,2000-05-16 17:37:00,0,Looking for info on Reservoir Cabonga. Going up next week and trying to find out how the bugs are in late may and what type of weather to expect?
507905,Guest,2000-05-16 19:40:00,0,"Haven't fished Cabonga but have fished LaVerendrye Park for twenty years. Black flies can be murder into June (then there's a shift change and the mosquitoes become murder.) As far as the weather...we've fished from mid-June to late August. In the same week we have experienced 85 degrees, sunny and mild then cold windy and snow flakes then back to sunny and warm. The longer days of summer seem to produce exceptionally hot days but early and late in the year the coolness can be extreme. Be prepared. Bring fly dope and expect to bring home a few trophy knobs on your neck and ankles."
507906,scoot,2000-05-19 06:06:00,12,Me- Let us know how you did when you get back from Cabonga. A bunch of us fished there in 1997 and didnt do too well. We liked the place and would like to go back if we could hear some recent fishing reports. email me at [email protected] Good luck!! Thanks
507907,Guest,2000-05-19 16:49:00,0,"I fished Cabonga several times. Have always done great fishing with minnows hooked jigs on Lac Andou and Lac Rapide. Bugs never a problem in July or Aug, while it was daylight. Good idea to buy minnows(frozen) at Le Domain. Last time I was there the law stated only parc sold minnows were OK. Anyone know if this is still the case."
