513644,Guest,2001-07-03 13:11:00,0,"THANKS FOR THE REPLY, LOOKS LIKE I DON'T NEED ANY EXTRA SHEAR PINS. JUST MAY HAVE TO FIND SOME NEW LOCATIONS FOR SHORE LUNCH!"
513645,Guest,2001-07-03 14:16:00,0,"Grumbler,I wouldn't leave those extra sheer pins at home. The high water has caused alot of debris to float off the shorelines and are now found in the lake. This debris includes many, large floating logs. Large rocks that were visible under lower water conditions, now are found just a few feet under the surface, so you have to be vigilant when motoring down the lake. Many of the sand beaches are now under water, so if you were using these as a shore lunch area, you indeed will need to find new locations. Good luck and good fishing Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
