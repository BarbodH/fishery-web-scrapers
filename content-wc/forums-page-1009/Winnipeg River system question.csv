I can honestly saythat in the 22 years of going up to Big Sand Lake and the surrounding area that I have never seen the water as high as itwas this year. I wouldn't be too concerned about the water levels, the fishing was good. Can't say that I saw a whole lot of floating debris but there was some. There are a couple very dangerous hidden rocks now. Stay away from the shore coming and going as much as possible and have one of the locals show you the danger areas. Try the smallmouth fishing out while your up there, its a great system for smallies. You can't go wrong with a 1/4 ounce gold jig head with a black twisty tail and a spinner (preferably gold). Caught lots of smallies and some big walleye on that combo. Good luck."
513625,Guest,2001-07-02 10:16:00,0,Buzzer Just returned from Minaki last week the fishing started slow then picked up later in the week. We got a lot of Walleye in 20 to 22 feet of water. Most of them were 16 to 18 inches with a few 21 to 25 inches. One day there was a lot of debris floating but it was caused fron them messing with the dam in Kenora. We fished mostly in Gun Lake up to the narrows. Good luck and let us know how you do when you get back.

513627,Reels,2001-07-03 06:02:00,2876,"Fishing should be good. If they are not relating to structure, fish the current. We were up there a few weeks ago, and will be back up in August. On the strucure, spinners and leeches worked best, but I would think they will turn on crawlers and minnows soon.There was some debri, but not too bad, just got to watch while your driving. Hazards not too bad, just dont blast too close to the islands.Tight lines"

513631,River_eye,2001-07-04 12:18:00,1486,"I guide on the winnipeg river in Manitoba. The water is extremely high, although it was even higher a couple of weeks ago. We see a lot of floating debris whenever the water is going up. Right now it's going down slightly, so there isn't so much. The fishing isn't really affected that much by the water level, it just changes the spots that you fish. As for rocks on the river, there are way too many to mark. There are reefs in the oddest of places, even way out in the middle of the river, so a guide is a must.River eye"
513629,Guest,2001-07-05 04:00:00,0,"Buzzer,Since your going after Musky and Pike I would concentrate onthe area between Minaki and south towards the Dalles. I hadthe biggest Musky of my life on down that way a few weeks agobut never got her to the boat. Good Luck"
