512714,Guest,2001-05-23 11:40:00,0,Figured out what the first message was all about. Your reply to the miss behaving conduct was sent to me from some of the guys im going fishing with. they are giving me a hard time. No harm was done or intended.
512715,Guest,2001-05-28 12:35:00,0,"Stringers are legal at this time in Ontario, but not recommended. Do NOT release fish from a stringer to put bigger ones on...releasing fish kept on a stringer will get you into trouble with our CO's....hope this helps"
512716,Frank from TBay,2001-05-28 15:59:00,312,Stringers are illegal on some lakes in NW Ontario.Lake Nipigon is one as well as Lac Seul. Check the lake specific rules in your regs.
512717,Guest,2001-06-30 07:59:00,0,How was your trip. We are flying in to Brownstone on July 21. Any info on Excellent Adventures and the lake would be appreciated. This is our 1st time with this outfitter.
512718,Guest,2001-07-03 09:43:00,0,"had a blast, weather was great no bugs except at dark, caught some nice wallies about 24-28"", fish the bays where the wind is blowing into the shores. northerns are small about 28-30"", had a walleye on and and northern hit it and netted both. fish the mouth of the river by the big beaver dam, caught all the big wallies there. portage lake is good, nice walk make sure you take extra gas and the winch on that lake works like s---! fish the falls for northerns in the portage lake and if looking far eyes fish between the narrow spot in the lake and along side where you'll see names sprayed on the rocks. used only spinner rigs with a split shot up about 12"" with crawlers. saw moose behind cabin in bay at end of lake there's a small creek that goes into the s--- they come there to eat at dark. caught some 13"" perch in the bay behind cabin, was'nt fishing for them and also caught 1 whitefish on the portage lake. we left a detailed map on the wall hopefully its still there, if you have any more questions e-mail me and i'll answer them for you good luck, have a blast, we mainly trolled for them, all we had was crawlers for bait."
