They caught 8 fish over 15#'s with the largest being 25#'s. I asked him what they were using. He told me they were using frozen ciscos (tullibee's) under large floats.He had some left over and they appeared to be professionally packaged. What I want to know is, can you get this across the border and what is the cost? If not where can someone get ciscos as bait? I haven't seen them before. Any info would be appreciated.ThanksAdam"

If you are going thru I-falls/Ft Frances check with either Witherspoons going west out of town or the Can-Op gas/bait going east out of town. There is also a Can-op east of Ft Frances in Mine Centre that has bait. Xplorer"
