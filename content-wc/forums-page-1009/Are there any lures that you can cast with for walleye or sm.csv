513647,Guest,2001-07-03 04:01:00,0,"Several, my favorites are the Rebel Wee-R, crawdad cranks (anykind) shad raps and hands down the best would be a gold quarter once jig head with a black twisty tail and gold spinner."
513648,Guest,2001-07-03 14:07:00,0,i have caught walleye with berkley frenzy's and wally divers without trolling and those crankbaits also caught northern but for smallmouth if you are in water that is rocky and shallow try using a crankbait that dives deep and rattles it wil hit the rocks but most likely not get snagged because of the angle it dives with and if there are smallmouth you will most likely catch tem
513649,dctolle,2001-07-03 17:52:00,9,Try using husky jerks they work very well here (ohio) in the spring when fishing rip rap. but im not sure where that other guy is fishing where he doesnt snag cranks in the rocks. they snag Very easy if you pull em too hard. and the angle they r diving puts them right in between the rocks. so be careful. can get expensive. \good luck
