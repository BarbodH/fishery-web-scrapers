513701,Reels,2001-07-04 17:06:00,2876,"My honest recomendation is not to hire a guide. ALthough there are a few excelent guides, for every good one, there is ten bad ones. You use your boat, your gas, your bait, the guide fee, and tip. It can be costly at the end of the day. This area you really dont need a guide to catch fish. Talk to the owner of the lodge you are staying at, or buy some bait from Jacks, and they will put you on the fish. I have heard of many bad experiences, and have had a few myself. If you do hire one, there have been a some excelent guides mentioned here. Do a search on Minaki, and Im sure you will find some. Nothing like a shore lunch cooked by someone else! Other than that, like I said before, its easy to find fish on this system on your own.Tight Lines,Ron"

Although you don't need a guide to catch fish, there's a reason why they aren't cheap. Sounds like you've just had a few bad experiences yourself and are a bit sour.River eye"
513703,Reels,2001-07-05 06:38:00,2876,"I was reffering to Minaki area. I have been going there for over ten years and yes, have had a few bad experiences. I stay up in Minaki a few weeks a year. I have heard more bad than good from other guests staying up there over the years. I in no way intended to say a guide is not worth the money. What I am saying is in this area, the hazards are generally marked, the river channel is marked with navigation bouys, and is generally safe trafficing the main channels. Minaki is pretty populated with fishermen, so it is easy to to find the word on what the fish are doing. The local guides do not take you to any other spots than what everyone else is fishing. I also said there are a few very good guides in the area, and the person should do some homework. A good guide is worth well more than what they are paid. You can allways learn from fishing with someone else, whether it be a guide, friend or a local you have met in town. Finding one is another thing. Just one fishermans opinion... thats all."

I think it's right of red bouys and left of green bouys downstream (northwest) and of course the opposite coming back. Last year a guy I know lost his entire duo-prop lower unit on a rock shelf just a mile north of Minaki because he did not know this. Fishing Tips:I wish I had hired a guide my 1st year up there, but that was late June 1993 and the fishing was tough all over that particular week. (not just for us ignorant newbees) However since then, I usually go up in the 1st half of august and the weather paterns have been consistent enough that we have had very few days of slow action. I would say it depends upon your expectations and your experience level. However as earlier replys said, a good guide is worth gold and can put you on more fish or bigger fish usually your choice. Check the WalleyeCentral archives for august fishing tips and if you think you want a guide you can get good ideas there as well as from your resort owner. Even , though I never met the guy, ?Rob? ?Ron? Carlson (RTMG) sure has given some great replys on this board that parallel my own Minaki experiences and if I'd want a guide I would not be afraid to give him a call. Just my opinionIaCraig"
