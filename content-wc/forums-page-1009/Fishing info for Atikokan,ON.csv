There is a nice campground and some housekeeping cabins there. There are several lakes and the Seine River for fishing. Roger will give you more info than you can handle about where to fish. If I was going to wilderness camp it would be on an island in the river. We did that for years, puting in the boats and going 30 miles by water to our favorite spot; but some of the guys are in their seventies and it's no longer fun sleeping on a rock."
