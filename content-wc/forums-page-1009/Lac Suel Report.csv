513697,Byron,2001-07-04 16:24:00,42,"Just got back from an 8 day (June 22nd through June 29th)fishing trip. First of all, we want to thank everyone who shared info on this site. Every where we were told to try, we caught fish.Now for th report (this is a report of only 3 of the 8 of us):All walleyes were caught in 5 ft. of water. Windy points and cloudy days were best, however we did catch many good eye's on sunny calm days. We found some submerged islands, and they produced very well. Biggest eye caught was 30 inches with one being 29 1/2 inches, and 2 at 28 inches. 22 were between 24 and 28 inches. Most of the others were in the slot and up to 24 inches. We did catch some below the slot (shore lunches), but the majority were in the slot or above. Except for what we ate, all were released.We started fishing with crankbaits and jigs (chartrues & gold), but turned to spinners and pretty much stayed with them. Best colors were chartrues, copper, gold, pink, silver and orange. We soon learned that while the orange produced some nice sized eye's, the pike really liked them, so we stopped using orange.Big Sand Banks, and areas around Moose Island, Shanty Narrows East, Rat Bay area, Scout Bay (an area called the wall on the south side of the narrows)and north toward Fishermans Cove Camp. South Bay on the south side of Hungry Narrows, also as you enter through the narrows, there is a big island, off to the left is a channel that goes to what I belive are called the falls. As you enter this chanel the first island you come to has some great submerged boulders on one end and shallows arond the rest of the approaching side. The saddle between the boulders and the south west tip (smaller boulders) are great for walleye, and we caught a few smallies there.Between the three of us, I can safely say we caught over 900 fish. We used fifty dozen minnows, 1 1/2 lbs. of leeches, and went through fifty harnesses, and fished 14 hours every day. We had a GREAT time.I can not say enough good things about Fishermans Cove. Dan, Keith and their families are great people. It's very important to them that you have a good time, and Catch a lot of fish. < www.fishermanscoveontario.com >When we left for Lac Suel, we thought of ourseves as Pike fishermen. We now fancy ourseves as the walleye elite."
