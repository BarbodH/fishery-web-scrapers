I wanted to share a few observations about fishing ethics that I've witnessed so far this season. I'm posting this under the Canada section, because that's where I fish and that's the area that I'm most concerned with. The lake I fish has a 4 walleye limit with only one fish being over 18"". For the record, neither I nor anyone in my boat keeps a fish over 18"". We simply photograph and release. I know it's everyone's dream to catch that ""wall-hanger"", and I can't blame ya! I might suggest a graphite mount and a nice photograph instead.That's not what really bothers me. I have witnessed more big walleyes being cleaned this year than ever before. I'm talking 6-8lb fish. Many were big producing females whose eggs ended up in the gut bucket as opposed to the lake, not to mention that they'd never reproduce again.Last week I heard a group of testosterone filled fishermen brag that they ate a bunch of 20+ inch walleyes for shore lunch and then proceeded to go out and harvest some more in the afternoon.That's illegal, and practically unenforceable. The ultimate loser is the future fisherman. Fishing shows and publications have done a good job of educating us all on the merits of catch and release. With today's technology, it is possible to fish a lake out or atleast seriously deplete a lake's population. The balance in Canada is more delicate. The waters are stretched thin with law enforcement personel. Restocking lakes in Ontario becomes an improbability due to the sheer number of lakes. It's our duty to control these resources. It costs me a lot less to fish here than most, but given that, I still can't pay for my trip based on my catch. I've caught hundreds of walleyes this year. Most have gone back in the lake so you can catch them to. I'd hope that you'd do the same. Enjoy your trip North!"

Having said that though, what is your take on the bucket loads and I mean bucket loads of walleyes the Indians take and take daily? My personal opinon is that of yours. I only take the smaller ones (better eating anyway) but if I (the testosterone one) take a few bigger ones or the Indians take the bigger ones, where's the future anyway? I have first hand experience with this. I use to go to this lake in Canada and put all and I mean all the fish back and then one year I went back and could not get a single bite. I later questioned this with a few locals and they said that this lake had been depleted by the Indians. Now we are lucky to catch one. I do very much agree with what you are saying, but all (and I mean all) should practice selective harvest. I won't even get into the half of moose I saw last year. Just blew me away."
513380,chrism,2001-06-20 12:23:00,429,"DocI'm with ya on that one - there's too much netting going on and it is destroying our sport - this sport reaps dividends to the provinces and states where there is a healthy fish population. Sooner than later someone has to control this - before it turns into another cod or salmon fiasco.The biggest problem ahead is for someone to rewrite the laws that allow the natives to unselectively harvest, and to follow it and enforce it closely - Personally I think it is a challenge nobody is prepared for or better said nobody has the $$$ for...Take away someones livelihood and watch them dig in their heels....especially if it was their given right, given to them by the powers that be.And in defence of the natives, there are a lot of non-native fisherpeople on the bigger lakes that do the same thing - It is the whole concept of commercial fishing, pulling more out each year, and not realizing it is a finite, yet renewable, resource that must be managed properly. I spoke with one guy who said the fines levied on him by the C.O.'s were just the cost of doing buisness...I wanted to puke on his sled!I am one happy camper when the ice freezes in a way that the bombardiers can't drive out onto the lake to drop their nets - ice fishing usually seems to be much better! Think there's any correlation???And to those of you who choose not to obey the slots or double dip or whatever, you run the risk of ruining it for all of us and I for one will do my best to prevent that!"
513381,Guest,2001-06-20 16:11:00,0,"Agree that everyone should conserve. But as mentioned earlier, natives are the biggest threat to the fisheries. They continue to rape the fisheries every year with no deterent coming from the federal government."
513382,Guest,2001-07-03 12:59:00,0,i totally agree with what you said and i am going up to canada for a week of fishing and i will keep in mind what you said and i only keep small ones to eat because they taste better and i was wondering is the lake that you are going too roderick lake in canada because i went there last year and they have the same rules
513383,bigfish1965,2001-07-03 16:42:00,3210,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Jul-03-01 AT 06:43PM (CST)[/font][p]Hi all; I think it is patently unfair to blame Natives for the depletion of fish stocks, when us 'white' people have done far more to damage the environment then the natives ever can. It is a combination of factors that lead to dwidling fish stocks, and you can never blame it on one problem. Our biggest problem is our inability to adjust our fishing techniques. I have enjoyed continued success fishing in all my favorite lakes. It wasn't easy at first, but I knew the old tactics didn't work and I had to adjust because the fish had adjusted. The fish had to adjust to our incursions...eg. zebra mussels, farm fertilizer run-off, boat pollution, and leaky septic tanks. Lakes have changed, the natives have always been there. If you disagree with the native tactics then encourage others not to purchase the Walleye that the natives sell. Every court in our land has agreed that we are the interlopers and the natives have a basic right to the environment and its resourses before we do. It is a fact. Get used to it. In the mean time, lets do what we can ourselves to increaes fish stocks. Use a self imposed slot limit. Take only fish under 16 inches. Take only a few, and for God sake,DO NOT buy fish captured by commercial or native nets."
