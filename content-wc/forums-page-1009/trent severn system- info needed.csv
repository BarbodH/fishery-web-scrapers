513587,Hunter,2001-07-01 17:31:00,346,"I just did a search it is www.fishinglakesimcoe.com, if it doesnt work do a search for ice fishing lake simcoe you will find it. I just found another good one, its Bob Izumis Real Fishing, alot of guys in the discussion room are from that area. And they seem to be very helpful. If you are not too far away check the Indian river while you are there, best largemouth ever, came from a bay that you have to go through a NARROW ditch to get in to it. It opens into a 4-6' deep marsh that is full of stumps, It isnt easy finding it, or getting in there. But when you do, you are in for some of the best largemouth fishing you can find in Ontario.Good Luck!!!"
513588,Guest,2001-07-04 09:18:00,0,Rice Lake.Best walleye fishing in the Kawartha's Get ready for some weed fishing. Locate fish on the edges and than move into the weed bed. Best fishing tends to be in about 7 - 9ft with stained water the dirtier the better.Most common bait used - hair jigs 1/4 to 3/8ths short casting into weed and shaking to bottom. Once through the canopy you can small hop jig. You can also try dunking your bait into the weed. Email me and I will share some spots that tend to be active year round.[email protected]
