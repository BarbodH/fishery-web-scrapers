The last couple of weeks it has been so, so. There is a ton of walleye on that lake but from what I have been told there mostly eater size with an ocassional big one. The one person I talked to had bad weather but they managed one big fish, 45"" I think. Sportsmans is a pretty big lodge with capacity of around 30 per week. i could be wrong.Sean"

Due to the short distance of air travel it is quite a bit cheaper than some of the other places they are looking at.I'll pass on whatever shows up here in the next couple days.Steve"
