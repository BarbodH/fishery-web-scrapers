513621,Guest,2001-07-03 12:49:00,0,i have caught walleye with berkley frenzy's and wally divers without trolling and those crankbaits also caught northern but for smallmouth if you are in water that is rocky and shallow try using a crankbait that dives deep and rattles it wil hit the rocks but most likely not get snagged because of the angle it dives with and if there are smallmouth you will most likely catch tem
