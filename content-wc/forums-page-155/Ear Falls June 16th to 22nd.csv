Very nice cabins, great layout, and wonderful people. We found tough fishing conditions. It was hot and the water level was down 2'. The morning bite was pretty good but the afternoons were very tough. Sleeping conditions were tough as the temps didn't cool down much over night. All in all it was a good trip. Can't wait to get back there in October."
