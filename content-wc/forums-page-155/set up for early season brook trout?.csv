You can grab decent 5w set ups from scientific anglers, I have one and its one of my favourites. Cost wise it's around $180, surprisingly good rig for that price and its complete minus flies and tappered leader. As far as learning goes you can practise in your yard with just the weighted floating line and mono leader ( no fly). If you can throw line 35' your laughing, mastering the cast, mending , roll cast and double haul will come in time."

6211752,1K1MOA,2018-06-21 15:48:00,90,"I had a great day with the specs when I hit a small creek. The secret weapon was a mouse fly - yes, a surface swimming fly the size of a mouse!!! They would just hammer it on the surface, and it would disappear. I caught over two dozen between 15"" - 17"". I had one 17"" fish I hooked being chased by another over 20"", that was trying to take the mouse fly out of it's mouth! The mouse flies could have easily been fished with light spinning as well. Pictures attached. The ""splash"" picture is a spec (tail on left with fly in mouth on right) if you zoom in. This was the Nakina area the first week of June."

6049217,123chadder,2018-03-08 17:08:00,429,no speck fishermen here?
6049273,adempsey2.0,2018-03-08 17:59:00,612,"Our trip to Trident lake on the Esnagami River back in late May 2016 we fished for Brookies using spinning gear.I tossed mostly spoons in the 2 to 3"" range (1/2oz to 3/4oz). I liked the Len Thompson Dimpled series a lot. There are plenty of options though. I'd bring a range of sizes to be sure, since spoons are small and relatively light you can easily load up.I would highly recommend bringing floats+shot and fish with worms as well. My boat partner caught some real beauties like that. Being able to run the float with the current was a great approach in some areas that were really hard to fish otherwise.Spinners probably would work too, but I stuck with spoons since they were working well.Chris even caught one on a jig+grub.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYz5...c-TXE3GPpT6HqZ"
6049777,vteye3,2018-03-09 07:18:00,496,"I've never caught Brookies in the big water of Ontario like Ogoki or Albany river systems. A favorite trout lure is size 3 Mepps Agilia slilver blade, no dressing on hook. They offer two different blades round and elongated. We prefer the the round blade. We have home made some similar and used different colored beads red, orange, yellow, dark green and combinations of of colors. We've caught all kinds of trout (char, dolly, rainbow, grayling) on that size Mepps in previous Alaska trips should work on Ontario rivers. Suggest a small swivel 3 feet above the lure with florocarbon leader and add weight as needed."
6052041,fsz,2018-03-10 17:23:00,144,"Vibrax or mepps spinners can be hard to beat. Depth and current dictate sizes. There are a couple good books regarding spinner fishing for trout. One is called ""spinner magic"" by Jim Bedford from MI. He also has chapters on plugs and spoons for trout. Its a good general teaching book. The other, ""spinner fishing for steelhead, salmon, and trout"" by Jed Davis is strictly on spinners and offers a more refined and detailed analysis of fishing spinners for these species. Davis fished the MI streams and moved to Oregon. Pretty good writing style that is entertaining. Both these books are probably late 80's vintage and are available in soft-back (less expensive). Learning to read a river can be an art and science. Depending on weather, water temperature and clarity, float (bobber) fishing may be more productive, as I think one poster has mentioned. Specks are sensative to changes in the barometer and weather. Concentrate your effort on days where the barometer is rising as opposed to falling. Those sunny, windless days walleye fisherman dread can be some of the best speck days. Good luck"
6053217,1K1MOA,2018-03-11 10:51:00,90,"I have fished the Nakina area multiple times for specks, on rivers and lakes, and you're getting good advise on what to use if spin fishing. I would add blue and silver #3 and #4 Blue Fox to the list. Slow retrieve is usually best; the reason for spinners is you get great action without needing much speed. These days I am primarily fly for specks in rivers, where a leech pattern or wooly bugger fly early season has produced very well. If deeper pools, you need to add a split shot and possibly use a sinking tip on the fly line if really deep. I mention this, because if you are going to be there for a week, why not give it a try if you own a fly rod? Variety is always nice on a week trip. No long, hero casts are needed, 15 - 20' normally works fine. I would recommend a strike indicator (like a small bobber) since you are new to it. You are fishing where you could possibly catch a 20""+ Speck on a fly, why not try? If you find fish, early season they are not hard to catch. Keep in mind though, you can spook them. If boating in to where you are fishing, let things quiet down for a bit before just hammering the water. I also keep my clothing color natural to the surroundings and approach quietly when shore fishing. Best places of course are the pools and eddies below the fast water, and the ""darker"" water seam edges, typically on curves, etc. Last thought for you...I would suggest 10# Trilene XL, strong but small enough diameter, and check for chaffing. I had a buddy loose a fish of a lifetime (probably close to 3# on the Drowning river, not far from you) a couple of years ago, his 6# line was chaffed."

6053481,adempsey2.0,2018-03-11 13:07:00,612,"Could always try a spin bubble. Worked for me, although I was fly fishing for pike.http://www.orvis.com/p/ajusta-casting-bubble/7l64"
6053705,123chadder,2018-03-11 14:54:00,429,interesting.....can you explain how to use it?
6054081,adempsey2.0,2018-03-11 17:41:00,612,"Sure. The purpose of the spin bubble is to add weight to your line so you can cast out flies. To give it weight, you simply fill the hollow bubble with some water. That gives it the weight it needs and a neutral buoyancy [or it floats depending on how much water you add] when it's in the water. So, basically it doesn't sink and drag your fly down with it.It's design is similar to a slip bobber where you pass your line through the bubble. However, inside the bubbles I use (there are different designs) the central port is made with surgical tubing. To secure the bubble to your line you simply twist the surgical tubing. Once your line is passed through, attach a bead and swivel followed by a leader/tippet and tie on your fly. There are various types of indicators you can use instead of the spin bubble to give weight so you can cast out the fly. I like the bubble. You can even use a floating Rapala.Some links to articles:http://globalflyfisher.com/fish-better/fishing-a-bubblehttp://www.anglerwise.com/2010/02/13...-spinning-rod/https://coloradooutdoorsmag.com/2016...owing-bubbles/https://fishwithjd.com/2009/07/12/fl...-spinning-rod/A few videos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v3Gxx0-Ch0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9BrJbALZzMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAL7502sG2Qhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wDf...ature=youtu.behttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtj3INAIdj0"
