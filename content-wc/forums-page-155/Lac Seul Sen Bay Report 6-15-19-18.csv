6211614,Bob/MN,2018-06-21 10:24:00,178,I launched out of Deception Bay and fished Sen Bay. We encountered a thunder storm the first night which slowed the fishing down some. I did manage to get the money fish the first day with a nice 26 inch walleye. The fishing improved daily and a lot of 20 to 24 inch fish were boated. A lot of fish were still in 6 to 10 FOW with a few bigger fish in the deeper 20 to 30 FOW. Water temp varied from 68 to 72 degrees. The water level was down 2 to 3 feet so watch the rocks. There was a bug hatch in Archer and the fishing was slow but I did manage to boat a 24 inch walleye in 18 FOW. The biggest fish our party boated was a nice 30 1/2 walleye. Lures of choice was a jig/plastic and a spinner/crawler rig. We stayed at the Lamplighter motel and had nice accommodations.
