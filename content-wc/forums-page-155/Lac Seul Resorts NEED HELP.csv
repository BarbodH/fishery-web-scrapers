6212138,jkonop,2018-06-22 15:05:00,544,Scout Lake Lodge has been great for me the last 7 years I have been going there.http://www.fishlacseul.com/
6209510,dschiebel,2018-06-17 04:44:00,85,"We are older gentleman that are tired of the flyins, we would like to try Lac Seul. There are only 2 of us and were coming from Mpls area. We are looking for a very nice resort that is a little way from others. We do need elect. We will be renting the resorts boats. Hate to drive a long way everyday by boat. We like catching numbers of walleyes, with the chance for a big one or northern. Numbers are important to us. We have never been on the lake and will hire a guide for a day or 2. We are thinking May or Sept of 2019. Please steer us to good clean resorts Thank You Dave"
6209520,wallydave,2018-06-17 05:15:00,2151,"Give Goose Bay Camp a look on the web www.lacseul.com nice cabins and boats, guides available. May night already be be booked, September might be a better option. Early season can be crowded, late season their will be more open water, stayed there many trips. Onaway might be another option never stayed there, but have heard good things! Good luck!"
6209526,Pooch,2018-06-17 05:36:00,4618,"There are a bunch of camps in and south of Ear Falls. Most all get good reviews here on WC. Do a little searching as there are some actually in Ear Falls and then there are a number south of there. Depends on what you like, the time of year and how far you want to motor everyday.The camps that come to mind are Onaway, Fishermans Cove, Lac Seul Lodge, Evergreen, Scout Lake, Whitewing and others. I've seen camp boats from the first three mentioned and they are all much nicer boats than any fly-in I've been on.The camps I mentioned are all on the NW end of the lake. There are fewer camps on the east end of the llake. What comes to mind near Hudson is Mahkwa, Lost Island and a high end camp called Silver Water Wheel. There are others near Sioux Lookout that I am not familiar with so sit tight and others will surely chime in on your question.Anywhere you go on Lac Seul you need to be aware of it's shear size, a lot of hazards and it can get very rough with little notice (not if) when the wind comes up. Hence the larger and heavier camp boats. Lac Seul fluctuates a lot in depth through out the season. LS takes a bit more awareness to fish safely than most other lakes. You just can't go bustin' azz across the lake anywhere you want. The large open water isn't always as deep and rock free as it looks. Fantastic fishery, but very different than most all fly-in lakes. Camps are booked early so make up your mind and book early. Most camps give returning guests first right of refusal for next seasons reservation so open cabins are sometimes hard to come by.Pooch"
6209732,LoDo,2018-06-17 14:26:00,721,"Onaway!! Good luck getting in there. Repeat clients dominate that place for 2-3 months. If you get in, be ready to book your next years trip too."
6209742,stjoeguy,2018-06-17 16:11:00,979,"Onaway was great but not exactly away from others. Not sure what your definition of a nice resort is, but you might check out Lac Seul Outposts.http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/lacse...agerentals.htm It's a boat in outpost resort on the NE end of the lake. They pick you up and bring you in to the resort. We saw very few other boats around in September."
6209882,jimirjr,2018-06-18 06:35:00,1149,"I'll SECOND that vote for the ""Outposts"" You go later in the year, (After Labor Day) and You'll see VERY few other boats. Ken and Brenda run an excellent camp and They take care of You.. Fishing is tremendous !"
6210036,pjshorthorn,2018-06-18 10:57:00,5654,"If you want to be guided for a few days, I would try Lost Island Lodge out of Hudson, ON. American and housekeeping plans are available. Ask for Collin Gosse as your guide. A friend highly recommends him. If you want to be more remote, then Lac Seul Outposts is a great camp. I have not seen guides used out of this camp,but Ken may be able to arrange that, but you would have to inquire. This is a housekeeping only camp. Been there at least 8 different times. Great fishing. PjShorthorn"
6210110,Bullman,2018-06-18 13:18:00,17,"I will also recommend Lac Seul Outpost. Boat in that gets you past most other camps or day trippers to the lake. The walleye fishing was outstanding. Most within one mile of the camp, unless you decide you just want a boat ride. The other wonderful thing with this camp is the dock is situated in about 15 foot of water and you can sit on this in the evening and catch quite a few walleyes without even trying."
6210260,RACER|X|,2018-06-18 18:36:00,41,"Had a group of 12 at Onaway last July. A few Gents over 70 and a few mid-60's. Good camp for all and the accomodations were good for the Sr. Fishermen. Nice easy load docks, easy to walk, etc. Would recommend Onaway if you can get in. Fiahing was great too. X"
6211858,ToxicAngler,2018-06-21 21:31:00,30,"Check out Lac Seul Lodge. Good camp, good equipment, great staff, awesome fishing within a short boat ride. Lots of repeats so can be tough to get in. Taking my daughter over labor day for the 3rd year. Never been disappointed with the trip."
