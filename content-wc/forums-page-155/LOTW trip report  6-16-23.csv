We stayed at Indianhead Lodge for the first time. We we on the housekeeping plan and had our own boat and didn't use a guide or ask for any help. Cabin has been remodeled and was the nicest we have stayed in, the owners did a great job and the touches like ceiling fans, larger showers, commercial coffee makers and many other things were noticed and very much appreciated! Going back for sure in 2019. I'm a bass fisherman so keep that in mind. We generally fish 3-4hrs in the morning/evening and sometimes a couple hours during the day? Still a few fresh bass on beds but mostly finished spawning. We had no trouble finding fish and caught fish up to 3lb, maybe a little larger. Tons of fry in the water and fish feeding on both them/crawdads . The best surprise was a good topwater bite. No crankbait bite for us and very few spinnerbait fish, mostly soft plastic Northern we're typical for us as we didn't target but caught while bass fishing. Definitely fish available. Walleye/Muskie we never caught which was a first and we never tried. Heard from others they were on reefs/humps on minnows from 18-37'. Gotta go and catch-up w home stuff so if you have questions just ask."
