Here's a quick recap:-As usual with Slate Falls the cabin and equipment were top notch.-We saw more wildlife on this trip than I ever have in my life. -Weather was tough, we endured a couple of cold fronts and quite a bit of rain.-Surprisingly water was down at least 4 feet on St. Joe compared to my August trip there.-The low water made things difficult as we had to adapt, at least for the larger pike. We found them though. -Walleye fishing, when we bothered, was incredible.-Highlight was a day trip to an area north of the Albany River to fish for lake trout and brook trout. It was INCREDIBLE! And all the more special for me as I'd fished these very same waters 23 years ago on one of my long solo canoe trips. It was a surreal experience being back there all these years later.If you want to read the lengthy, detailed story on our trip you can see it here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/j...ake-st-joseph/If you'd rather just watch a 31 minute highlight reel video you can see that here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxUjXdTBRsMCheers, Mike"

6212478,kona77,2018-06-23 10:06:00,236,Mike- Another great trip review..Bummer about losing the camera on the brook trout stream but it appears it was well worth it to revisit a spot you thoroughly enjoyed years ago.. Looks like Slate Falls/Verne run a great operation and take care of their facilities and customers. I always pay attention to the details you provide on searching for big gators on a new body of water.. The lower water this year made things challenging for our group on another body of water but we eventually figured things out. Look forward to your other adventures
