I have looked at the site with current crossing times but I can't find a site with any data on past wait times. Thanks for any help you can provide. Big Louie"
6212818,BCNeal,2018-06-24 14:54:00,19,We went through about noon on Friday June 7th and had approximately a 1 hour 30 minute wait.
6212826,packpro,2018-06-24 15:20:00,695,Went through Friday June 8 at 6:15 PM. 45 minutes. Long line but it moved pretty good.

When you are with 3 other people in the truck and there is excitement about the start of the fishing trip, the wait time doesn't seem that long to us. We'd like to cross at Baudette, but it would really be out of the way for us coming from the Chicago area."
6213094,ILScott,2018-06-25 06:20:00,139,We always cross the border on Friday morning between 6 and 7 and no wait time. This year is was around 6 and one car in front of us. After crossing get license and eat breakfast in Fort Frances.
