6212284,rzep,2018-06-22 22:00:00,1196,"Ok... We are talking NW Ontario ....aren't we ? Fishing .. right ? Not Time Square ....The scale from Motel 6 to Hilton really does not hold here ... is more like starting with hole in the ground for a bathroom followed by Motel 6 to Super 8....If you are targeting Hilton level audience... it maybe hard ... As you can see ,most guys here coming to CAN are still trying to figure out how many cases of beer they can take thru the boarder and whether boxes of nightcrawlers are allowed.It is just simple economics. Natural resources and oil prices are down when comparing to years back so CAN is lower w/r US dollar. I do not care if the diff is single % but once it reaches 20-30%, its is getting my attention. I have list of places which charge in CAN and another list of places for US $.... When rates goes one way or the other, I look at different lists.I am not saying you are bad person and price gauging. I just not see value w/r accommodation in NW ontario on fishing trips. Simply due to the presumption of the entire experience. I could see more value in terms of additional services.. like including guides, better boats etc....and these are easy to compare.This discussion brings bad memory from last year ...- We stayed overnight (before fly out) in the filthiest hotel/motel ever .. for ~$100/night ... .in Red Lake ONT .. cant recall the name .. the beds were actually made with visible stains on sheet and covers. Floor was actually sticky. Coming in late,I was simply too tired too complain .. We slept fully clothed over our own blankets. Super 8 by Tim Horton seemed much better choice .. at least from outside."
6212358,Obabikon,2018-06-23 06:04:00,2370,"This comment might imply that you believe resorts that charge in US are price gauging. Heck there's another topic going right now on where the best place to exchange currencies is. Seems pretty inconvenient. I didn't believe you thought I was a bad person, and I am not defending my character. I know how the business operates, and why I charge what I charge... and what currency I charge in. If I changed currencies (which most of my guests would not like), I would immediately have to raise my rates 30% to match the amount that I am currently charging. Also, I was speaking of the ""range"", as far as values go... remoteness has value, cabin quality has value, meals (and quality of meals) has value, boats have value, service (fish cleaning, maid service) has value... there are tons of reasons (including mattresses, cleanliness, and unstained sheets) that make one place more valuable than another for a trip. The value is not always reflected by the price of the place. That is where good deals and bad deals come in. You had a BAD deal when you stayed at that crappy hotel. $100 is too much for a flea bag. It isn't simply ""they all catch walleye, northern, musky""... Last comment, and again I will stop trying to argue economics on a fishing site.... Currency, Value and Cost are three different things, and are often completely unrelated. Currency - simply what they charge in Cost - what the actual price is (to compare two places, the price must be converted to the same currency) Value - what the place is actually worth Combining those three is how you get a ""good deal"" or a ""bad deal""."
6212372,Shellback,2018-06-23 06:22:00,8083,"The comments in bold are what frustrate me when folks start talking about what currency lodges charge. Hopefully the ""new"" rate is going to cost the customer the same amount after the conversion unless you are tacking on another 30% over and above the conversion rate."
6212532,Obabikon,2018-06-23 15:23:00,2370,"No... I would simply need to charge the price on the conversion rate. I wouldn't need to add another 30%. But, my prices are determined by what it costs to run the resort. So... to pay the bills, mortgage, and make a living, I would need to earn X US dollars or X times the exchange rate in Canadian dollars. It doesn't make a difference to me, as they are the exact same. What frustrates me when this topic comes up, is that there are people who think that anyone charging in US is making 30% more than those charging in Canadian. That's just not a fact at all. You can't gouge people for 30% with the exchange rate, unless they were told up front that the price was Canadian, and then switched it to US. If you know the cost of your trip before hand, that's all that matters. I'll say this though... Canadian Tire in Ft. Francis does not give any exchange rate for US currency. That is gouging US clients. If I were to go to a resort, and Canadians were paying the same price in their currency as Americans were paying in their currency... that isn't at all fair."
6212556,Wall-i-Lama,2018-06-23 17:45:00,1524,"V bay speaks the truth! I know a resort that published a ""generic"" rate on their brochure and website and didn't state if prices were in US rates or CA rates. So, if a site was $1000 and you were from US it was 1000 greenbacks. If you were from Canada it was 1000 loonies! Never did find out how it worked out with pesos! Anyway we got tired of paying an approximate 20% premium compared to CA citizens, so we found a new place that simply charges everyone the same RATE. I really don't care about what currency, as long as it's the same rate for everyone. After loosing a significant amount of business, they now publish that all rates listed are in US. I'm sure the ""wink wink rate"" still applies to CA citizens. But at least they covered their arse (at least they think)!"

6212608,Pooch,2018-06-24 05:25:00,4618,"Whether a camp charges me $1000 CND or $750 USD it's the same amount of money out of my pocket. Writing a personal check for $750 to the camp owner is convenient for me and most likely an inconvenience for the camp owner as his bank is going to ""ding"" him a little on the conversion and not credit his account until the check clears south of the border. It takes longer for an out of country check to clear. Don't believe me? Take a Canadian check to a USA bank and see what happens and the time it takes to make it happen. If at all. If I write a personal check to an out of country establishment and that check bounces, what are the odds that the person who took that bad check will ever get their money? Not much above 0% is my guess.Charge card in camp? If you were a camp owner and took plastic you would have to increase your rate the 3 or 4% they are charged or take the hit yourself. Three or four percent is huge as it comes directly off the top. So do you raise rates for the convenience of a few at the detriment of those who pay cash or do you mark your rates up then give a ""cash"" discount for a guy with cash or check?Unless there are huge moves in currency values USD vs CND it is a mute point. Plastic is great for travelers (that would be me), but it is not free. And those ""cash back"" cards? Who's cash do you think you are getting back? Credit card company or yours and/or the retailer? Kind of like the ""Rebates"" BS. I'm always amazed at folks who probably have not owned a business think that a business owner is making big bucks as most are not. It is tough to be self employed. Try it sometime and you will have more empathy for those that go it alone. Just my take on this subject after traveling out of the country a lot during my life.Pooch"
6212820,v-bay gord,2018-06-24 14:54:00,3168,"I think it's not about liking or disliking Americans or Canadians, but which currency gives you the biggest bang when you stick it in your bank. In this case the American $ has a bit of a bonus if, and I say IF, you price your service with the intention of making an extra profit from the exchange rate. Sure, it isn't every business, and I agree my comments were a horrible generalization. I have a dark side when it comes to stirring the pot.... Thanks for your thoughtful response. 1-2%??? What an outrageous rip-off!"
6212822,Obabikon,2018-06-24 15:10:00,2370,"From my experience... CC company fees run from 3-5%. Cashing a US check costs me 1-2% on the exchange rate... depending on if I do it through firma exchange or straight through the bank, and also how much I'm depositing. I typically save enough checks to get above a certain amount. This gives me a better exchange rate. As for actual profits, it is better financially to be paid in checks than to receive CC payments. The real question is, does the ""hassle"" of checks justify accepting CC payments? That is for each individual business owner to decide. Saving 2-3% doesn't sound like much. However, if a business' gross income was $500,000... that equates to $10,000-$15,000 saved from bank fees. I personally don't want to give the bank any more money than I have to."
6212830,Obabikon,2018-06-24 15:33:00,2370,"I just don't know how you could ever do that. If I want to gross 5% more money this year... I have to raise my prices 5%. Maybe some people use the exchange rate as an ""excuse"" as to why they charge what they charge. However, when you pay $800 for a trip, do you really care if $100 goes to electricity, $40 goes to water, $200 goes to staffing, $60 goes to licensing, $175 goes to food, $100 goes to taxes, $100 goes to profit, and $25 is more profit (that they added in because of the exchanging currency)? An $800 trip is what it is. How an owner justifies that doesn't really change anything. It doesn't really matter why the prices go up... I guess some owners like to make excuses as to why they charge what they charge. I don't personally like that. I charge ____. I charge that, because that's what I feel is an appropriate amount to charge when I take into account financial needs mortgage, taxes, payroll, operational costs, and personal income. There are three ways to cheat guests, in my opinion.... Actual costs ""yes, your trip was $800, but there's a docking fee, a parking fee, a fish house rental fee, fish bag fee, ice fee..."" but none of that was explained up front. Services ""our 5 star chef will fix steak and lobster every night""... but it ends up being craft dinner. Not honoring your price ""I told you $800, but I didn't know the exchange was going to tank and gas prices go up... so now it is $900"""
6212836,BreezyPoint,2018-06-24 15:56:00,1581,This whole exchange discussion drives me crazy. This is a buyer beware situation. Know what you are paying for and what you are getting. Knowing what you are paying means understanding exchange rates and options. I know plenty of good places charging US funds that are cheaper then very good places charging Canadian funds (and vice versa). I stay at places that charge US funds and places that charge Canadian funds. Both are great places with good rates that are comparable. People who whine about this should try to understand the mathematics or stay at a place that charges in the currency they favor or else just stay home!I did stay at a place one time that changed from Canadian to US on the fly. I never went there again and that is the behavior people should be upset about.Frank

6212632,Shellback,2018-06-24 07:32:00,8083,"I use plastic most often because I ""do"" get cash back. That said, if more businesses offered a discount for cash I'd be all over it. If a business said this price is cash, add 3% for plastic, I can well accept that. I know when I've exchanged US $ for Canadian $ at one of their banks, they dinged me a few %. I'm assuming they ding Canadian businesses when they deposit US $ also. If so, then would it be more practical for a Canadian business to accept plastic from US customers as they should get the full rate in CA $, verses being dinged on converting a US $ check to CA $? Would that offset the CC company fees charged to the business?"
6212646,rzep,2018-06-24 08:09:00,1196,"Kind of funny as we keep talking about ""value added"" Hilton type stuff and then back to how do I get 3% cash discount......I never said life was easy and plenty of money to be made running resort in ONT. Actually, out of the last 5 resorts I spent week, only one was 90% booked during my week. Last year, place was maybe half full with multiple 6-8 person lodges, having 2 people. Then 7-8 years ago I was on eagle lake and we (2) were the only people in the camp.My friend was going to resort on Wine (?) lake for many years. The resort went up for sale couple years back (do not know what happened since). I recall price being close to a 1 mil (US !!!). Based on what he told me in terms of lodge, outpost etc and what he paid for the week, I calculated I would have to own it for 25 years to get my money back. And this is assuming, nothing else popped up along the way. No, thanks ...I like fish ... but 1 mil gives me lifetime of fishing trips on tarpon in the Keys.Personally, once I hit road on vacation (or get on the airplane) I do not look ""how to save X %""....kind of defeats purpose of vacation i.e., worring about the stupid stuff."
6212802,Obabikon,2018-06-24 14:09:00,2370,"Sorry v-bay, I certainly respect you as a fellow owner, but what currency a company charges in does not at all effect their discounts. Your above comment is 100% misleading, and a horribly inaccurate generalization. You're basically saying... ""people who charge in USD like Canadians and hate Americans... it is reflected in their price"" Businesses that charge in Canadian are just as (if not MORE) likely to offer discounts to ""fellow Canadians""... how can they do this? Because (GASP!!!) PROFIT is built into their price.... I know, it's unbelievable. Personally, I give 50% discounts to buddies I went to school with. I also allow my immediate family to come up to the resort, as long as they pay for food and gas (probably in the range of 80% off). How on earth is this even possible? I actually lose money when family comes to visit... and when friends come up, I don't make enough to pay the standard bills. Discounts to Canadians (or discounts to anyone) has more to do with the owner, and how they view their clients. MOST resorts don't care what country you are from, they just want to make a living doing what they love to do. Some, would prefer more Canadians, or feel that ""locals"" deserve a financial break. That has nothing to do with currency, and everything to do with business strategy. You can give 30% off in Canadian just as easily as you can USD... If an american plan resort is charging 30% less than their identical competitor... where is the ""cushion"" or ""gravy""? Easy answer... it doesn't exist. Sure... if they are charging the same number, but different currencies... or if two identical resorts are both charging in Canadian, but one is 30% higher... or if they are both charging in US, but one is 30% higher... then the cheaper one is the better price. Money doesn't magically get made because of an exchange rate. When I set my prices LAST JUNE... the exchange rate was 1.29 Today the exchange rate is 1.33 (and two weeks ago it was 1.30) Man, that extra 1-2% growth is freaking GRAVY! If the rate hasn't changed significantly since prices were set, there is no ""cushion"" or ""gravy"", and it can change down just as easily as it can change up."

The guy I know gives me 100 of the bricks, they're not too heavy only about 2# each, and I take them to Canada. The first time he suggested it I was worried about the mess but each one is individually wrapped in tinfoil to protect them. The cousin is so happy to get them that he's been giving me an exchange of $1.50 with no fees. I'm thinking about asking for more this year since we made the original deal when it was par. Not sure though because the cousin has always been super nice but some of the guys who help him unload the bricks are sort of scary and I don't want to seem rude. Anyway, it's really convenient and goes really fast 'cause they always seem to be in a hurry to get to work. They are nice guys and always give me a little ribbing, calling me their ""mule"" and stuff like that. One time the bricks must have been stored around where a skunk lived and kind of smelled.

6211922,Obabikon,2018-06-22 06:49:00,2370,"rzep, There are lots of ways it is convenient to charge in US. I would say that almost all of my guests pay with a personal US check... not cash. So, very few people are carrying cash. I also allow them to put staff gratuity onto the check, which is not something I could do with a card. On top of that, people who go to place in Canadian don't know how much it is actually going to cost, until they pay the bill. If the exchange rate goes down 7%... your trip just went up 7%. If the exchange rate goes up 7%... your trip just got cheaper by 7%. There is a lot of convenience in knowing exactly what your trip is going to cost before you go. If you're the customer, your currency doesn't fluctuate from the time you booked, until the time you leave. Sure... you can pay for your entire trip the moment you book, if you'd prefer. As far as taking cards goes... I realize the new things you can plug into iPhones are much more affordable, but the old fashioned credit card machine cost the business more than 3%. I could take cards, and I am actually going to start doing so soon. However, they are certainly not free on the business owner's end, and that has nothing to do with what currency we use. I want to make it as convenient as possible. Just because cc/port companies only take 1% from you, doesn't mean they only take that much on the other end. Then add to that... many remote resorts struggle with internet and cell phone coverage. If you don't understand the difference between ""values"" of trips... stay at a Redroof, Holiday Inn, and Hilton in order. You can pitch a tent if you're wanting to save the $$$. The reality is... if you think that owners that charge in US are making 30% more money this year than owners that charge in Canadian... you're entirely off base in how it actually works. Try to find a comparable Island resort, on Lake of the Woods that charges in Canadian... and isn't 30% or more expensive than Obabikon. Charging in a currency does not make you more or less expensive.... charging in US does not mean you're gouging your clients.

6211116,Guest,2018-06-20 11:03:00,0,That number doesn't even make sense. At today's exchange rate is would be 133% or 75% depending on which way you exchange. Perhaps this is some new Canadian math you've come up with.
6211172,Obabikon,2018-06-20 11:59:00,2370,"Unless you're a broker transferring millions of dollars electronically, you will never get 133% when the exchange is 133%. If you walk in with $100 US cash to a Canadian bank, they will probably give you $127-$129... it is simply a handling fee. They have to then take that $100 bill and send it back to the US or sell it to a Canadian. If ONE of those US $100 bills is fake... they have to make 20-30 $100 transactions just to break even. Plus... tellers do not work for free. If you exchange at a store... they will take some money off of that too. So, you might get $122, because when they go to the bank, they will get $127. They also are assuming the liability of handling money (accepting fake, loss, being robbed, etc). Their employees are also not working for free. But, the more money you handle, the better the rate that the bank will get you. So, a casino can offer a better exchange rate than a mom and pop grocery store. Don't blame the grocery store for charging outlandish prices... they are simply trying to run a successful business. If their exchange isn't fair... people will stop exchanging with them. All of that said... service should never be free. If someone is being paid to work, and you require their time... they should be making money off of you, and you should simply be thankful for the service rendered. If the cost of the service is too high... go to another location. However, keep in mind that most business owners are here to try to make a living... and none are getting rich off of exchanging money."
6210734,walleyecheek,2018-06-19 15:37:00,2231,Just my opinion but I don't think Canadian resorts should charge in us funds. They should charge in Canadian funds. When the exchange rate is in our favor (us customer) we get the short end of the stick !!!
6210746,Freytown,2018-06-19 16:08:00,770,"So instead of charging USD$1,000 you'd be happy if they charged CAD$1,300. (PS: there is no difference). FT"

6210758,v-bay gord,2018-06-19 17:07:00,3168,I like the way you think. Once again the exchange rate debate surfaces it's ugly head......
6210762,v-bay gord,2018-06-19 17:15:00,3168,I have a bridge to sell you.........
6210778,CI_Guy,2018-06-19 18:09:00,2118,"The exchange rate swings back and forth so we may be getting the short end of the stick now, but we are also come out ahead other times. IMHO the biggest reason they charge in US dollars is as a service to US customers because we Americans are to lazy to deal with math!"

6210792,That Minnesota guy,2018-06-19 18:55:00,8293,"Funny how nobody mentions there are many businesses here in the states that wont accept Canadian currency anytime. But, I guess thats different."
6210814,Obabikon,2018-06-19 19:59:00,2370,"1st... nobody gets the short end of any stick, unless you don't get the value you pay for. Figure out what you're paying, and if it is a good deal... take the trip. Right now, a trip that is $1000 US is the same as a trip that is $1,300 Canadian. So, if you find two identical resorts, and one is $900 US and the other is $1,300 Canadian... the one charging in US is cheaper. If one is $1,000 US and the other is $1,200 Canadian... the one charging in Canadian is cheaper. Just find the right place, at the right price, and have a great trip. 2nd... I can't recall an area in the US that is 90% reliant on Canadian tourism. I'm sure if that was the case, they would probably be more amiable to charge in the loonie. As I have mentioned before, in 12 years of business, I have had less than 10 total Canadian guests. It is very inconvenient to exchange money to pay the bill. I could simply multiply my prices by 1.3 and then make every single one of my guests exchange currency to pay their bill. Seems much easier, and certainly more convenient to our paying guests to simply charge in US."
