6212072,jveri,2018-06-22 12:13:00,70,I have before with a 6wt fly rod up north using a sink tip on the end of my floating line casting wooly buggers towards rising fish. This was during a mayfly hatch so not sure how you would target them once they go deeper

Stripping a streamer on a sinking line ought to work so long as the fish are shallow enough. I don't think you would feel them take a nymph, you would have to fish that under an indicator. I'd recommend lead eye streamers like a clouser or rabbit strip that imitates a leech. Those are just glorified jigs, anyway. Combined with a sinking line you can get down a max of 10' and still have enough tension on the line to feel a strike. Weed edges, rock flats and shoreline breaks are where I'd try. You'll get smallmouth if you don't get walleye."

We were fishing below waterfalls in deeper pools. A jig and twister tail on a spinning rod was more effective, but it can be done."
