Walleye bite was on all day as the weather pattern was stable all week. Pike bite was fantastic.Latest rumor on the ""Lodge Property"" High Courts struck down the permit to build 139 condominium units on the Minaki Lodge site due to not having the ability to deal with the sewer treatment for that many units."
