6211958,The tank,2018-06-22 08:54:00,340,Where are you staying at in canada?
6212002,PRO-V16,2018-06-22 10:08:00,454,Try the casino in Warroad. Big well lit lot.

6212254,PRO-V16,2018-06-22 20:18:00,454,You would not cross at Baudette to go to the Angle.
6212308,The tank,2018-06-23 03:18:00,340,Depends where hes coming from if he crosses at Baudette or not? Hes very vage on his post.
6212310,PRO-V16,2018-06-23 03:26:00,454,He said he was fishing the Angle.
6212342,The tank,2018-06-23 05:31:00,340,So if your fishing the angle and staying on flag island wouldnt you be driving through Baudette? I do know a few that go through Baudette and boat to the area around flag island from morson. They thinks its easier than the road to the landing.
6212346,The tank,2018-06-23 05:46:00,340,What im saying he can stay at americinn. I was a little messed up for a bit on how to get to the angle. I know how but my brain wasnt awake.
