6025001,prov1900,2018-02-25 08:52:00,544,"Our group has ranged from 12 to 2, depending on the year. When it's just two of us, our time on the water is a lot longer. Now that my two young boys go, our schedule doesn't always meet everyone else's. We are usually last ones out but it's all good. I enjoy Canada for the fishing of course, but the older I get, sometimes, just staring at the water from the cabin is worth the price of admission. I also have the fastest boat in our group, so usually about the time our group gets to their spot, I am within seconds right behind them. We fish till about 3-4 in the afternoon, go in, clean fish and get supper ready. I do all the cooking and most of the fish cleaning in our camp. We eat fish on most nights, but only as an appetizer generally. After supper and a few cold ones, we all head back out and have a makeshift bass tournament. Head in at dark for a few more cold ones, then off to bed. I never sleep anywhere as well as I do in NWO. This has been a great thread. I can't wait for this years trip. 98 days."
6025729,btyreprich,2018-02-25 14:14:00,1067,"The routine starts for us on the ride up to Canada. We stop for a lunch in Eau Claire and for years we'd eat at the Perkins in that town. Not bad / not great. So last year we went on the internet while on the ride up and found a locally owned family restaurant that was more enjoyable. We agreed to keep on trying new spots using this approach. On Friday night in International Falls, we go to the Mexican restaurant in town which is quite good. I recommend it. After our meal we ask the manager if we can sit at one of the table to drink been and play cards. We have never been told no as we are buying beer and are sure to tip the waitress extra. I do 90% of the meal preparation so I make the two younger ones do clean up and dishes. Once that is done it's more card games and beer for the other three while I prepare tomorrow's Shore lunch and dinner. Card game gang is now ready for a snack which could include: Popcorn Chips & salsa Watermelon cut up into cubes I then sit on the sofa, surf the Internet, and take a nap before bed! It's heck getting old."
6026065,Baseline,2018-02-25 16:35:00,3207,I'm a small group guy 2 to 4 people. Coffee pot ready to go the night before. Up around 6 am Cook a good breakfast and shove off about 8 am. Return around 3 and eat dinner. Kickback till 5 or 6 then fish till dark. If the weather sucks we fish less hours.
6026377,Lockport1850,2018-02-25 19:19:00,6,"With respect to Canadian FLY-IN trips, this is a great schedule. My friends and I live in southern Manitoba, and when we fly to the far north at Munroe Lake Lodge, daytime hours are for monster Pike fishing. When the waters and Pike warm up around 11am to 6pm, you want to be on the water, casting as much as possible. Rather than sitting on the shore for 1.5 to 2 hours while lunch is made by the guides, we eat our daily sandwichs as we boat to the next bay for Pike. That being said, we are on the water early, right after breakfast, to fish the river for Arctic Grayling since they are up early while the Pike are still relatively dormant. As someone else said, we also let almost all the fish go, and may eat 3-4 fish on the one out of five nights there is a fish supper. If we are not too tired, we fish about 3 hours in the evening for Pike and big Lake Trout. And then we sleep like babies, which can be a little hard since there is twilight all night long that far up north (it never really gets dark in summertime)."
6026489,valley366,2018-02-25 20:50:00,193,"Have several routines that have adjusted over the years depending on the group.One part that has not changed much. Departure day. Head out of Minneapolis around noon, stop at International Falls, top off gas and grab dinner. Hop across the border for the night at Super 8 Ft. Frances. Up and on the road around 9am for the ride north.In camp our daily routine is approximately:700-730 people start getting up and good breakfast. Pancakes/sausage or Eggs and bacon.830-900 on the water1 lunch. Used to be fish shore lunch, currently is sandwiches until kids old enough to split some of the tasks5-6 back at the cabin for a hearty dinner. 730 or so back on the water for the evening bite.930 or so kiddos to bed so dad can have a beer on the porch looking over the lake.Like others we eat good in camp. No set night for anything but the standard menu is spaghetti, steak, burgers, grilled chicken, lasagna, grilled pork chops and a fish fry."

Grab a bag lunch or shore lunch kit and head back to the cabin for our boat bag and last call for indoor plumbing. Leave the dock about 7AM. Depending on where we plan to fish, we might leave our bag lunch at the cabin and come back for lunch about 12-1. If it's hot or fishing is slow, we may take a short nap, or just grab a thermos of coffee and head back out until 5. Supper goes from about 4:45-6PM where we chat with our tablemates about our fishing day. Back to the cabin for our boat bag, enjoy some indoor plumbing, and back on the water until dark. Lounge a while at the bar or on the cabin porch for a few cold ones then hit the sack. Repeat daily, and for as long as the wallet permits. We spend almost every weekend at our camper in northern WI, where I am always tending a smoker, grill, or campfire cookout if we aren't fishing or sleeping, so I prefer the full service treatment on our Canada trip."

Head up through Duluth and try to get to the Lakeshore Motor Inn in Virginia, MN before 11 pm. Then it's up early and finish the drive up. We prefer American plan, so we wake up to a fresh pot of coffee delivered to the cabin, then breakfast at 7 sharing a table with awesome guests. On the water around 8. We either bring sandwiches or head in for lunch depending on weather and moring fishing location. Back on water by 1-ish and then in for dinner at 5 to share stories with new friends.

We do the walleye thing from about 7 am until 9 then get some perch until 2 with a good sandwich during the day with snacks. At 2pm we are back and start cleaning fish and have a few cocktails. From about 4-6pm we have a nice supper from the slow cooker or the grill and head back out about 6ish for walleye. We do the walleye thing until about 9 and then clean fish and drink beer until about 11 and hit the hay. We have a great time even if the fish don't bite.

Pack cooler full of sandwiches, snacks, & drinks for the day. On the water by 845, catching 1st eye by 915. Stay out until dusk & return to clean dinner while starting to suck down the Labatts. Dinner made, eaten, & cleaned up by 10. In bed by 1030. Days 3-6Usually still the 1st one up but now it's more like 7-8 & need aspirin. Pound the coffee for a bit and wonder down to the docks all pie-eyed getting the report from the dock hands. Back to the cabin for more coffee and think about breakfast. Usually pancakes because they're easy and help soak up the devils juice. On the water around 1030-11. Stay out all day, again. Catch our 100 eyes and head back for dinner with our Labatts. Usually don't even bother checking what time I pass out, just concentrating on making it in bed. Day 7Wake up and cry because it's the last day in camp. Leftovers for breakfast, then on the water until 6ish. Come back to polish off the remaining Labatts and eat. Pack and clean cabin. Wander around one last time and see if anyone's out and about. Trade some stories and lies and say our goodbyes. Bed around 10ish. Day 8 Head home and reflect on another great trip to Sunset Country. Discussion of the following year is usual conversation."

Only 2 of us are interested in breakfast which is typically toaster waffles with microwaved sausage or a microwave breakfast bowl or sandwich. We are on the lake around 6:30 until 11:00. From 11:00 to 2:00 we're back at camp for a big lunch, 3 handed cribbage, and maybe a nap. From 2:00 to about 4:00 we're back on the lake generally chasing northerns. Back to the lodge from about 4:00 to 6:00 for appetizers and cocktails then back chasing walleyes from about 6:00 until sunset. Back to camp for a light dinner, more cribbage, and to bed. We never actually set up a schedule but after 12 trips together it's just the way things work. If we're on a good bite or at the far end of the lake we'll switch things up. We always have a small cooler with meat, bread, mayo, soda/water, and Lunchables on board just in case we decide to stay out. We don't do a shore lunch but we do eat fish at 3 or 4 times during the week. One part of our ""routine"" lasts all year. We play cribbage together at least 3 times a week. We play for a buck a game and a nickle a peg -- double on a skunk. All losses go into the ""Canada Pot"". We go up twice a year and ""pot"" ends up paying for at least 3/4 of the total bill and from time to time we'll treat our wives to dinner from pot as well."

Our camp is friday to friday, and we drive to FF on thurs and stay the night at the Super 8. Get up head to the safeway and then to rainy Lake Sport shop for licenses and Leeches, crawlers.

We cross at International Falls about 4pm. We then head to a hotel in Fort Francis, we have been staying at LaPlace Rendez-vous (nice accommodations, good food and a nice bar) but this year we are going to give Copper River Inn on the West side of Fort Francis a try because we have decided to take the 71 up instead of the 502. The 71 is a nicer drive with a couple pit stops (we are getting older) available if necessary. So we will have dinner and drinks and then breakfast in the morning at Copper River and then head to Birch Dale Lodge at about 8am. We arrive at the lodge about 11:30 and get checked in to our cabin. We then head to a friends private cabin for a Seafood Lasagna dinner drinks and conversation. Friday is spent fishing and then back to our friends cabin for a Prime Rib Dinner, drinks and more conversation. The rest of the week the American Plan takes care of all our meals, so days are spent fishing. Saturday evening the group hosts our annual ""Wing Night"" for the camp, friends and family. Other nights after dinner are normally spent in the bar telling stories and meeting old and new friends. Friday night we have our farewell Steak and Lobster dinner and then our NARDA Awards Night to hand out trophies for largest fish etc.. Saturday we leave at 6am to head home and the long wait to do it all over again next year!"

We have a really good cook in the group but I must insist on the blue cheese Alfredo and buffalo eyes! Thanks for sharing the link to your culinary pictorial. Do you do any trout fishing in Colorado?

We've been doing it since 1985 and back when we first started, we fished hard - now it's much more relaxed. Get up at 6:00 -- head in for breakfast, hit the water at about 8:00 (we boat a ways for our spots on Lac Seul). Stay in the boat and fish ""all day"" (OK - 'til 3:30 ) head back to camp, have a couple of good drinks, clean fish, cook dinner (or go out to eat - ""in town""), do any clean-up, then's it's card playing time (cribbage, hearts, etc.), hit the sack around 11:30-12:00.

I found that relaxing and having a good time were more important.The good news is that so many fishing spots are close to camp that I can do this schedule without sacrificing much.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6024329,Slim03,2018-02-24 21:03:00,159,Couple guys get up at 5:30-6 and start coffee and bacon. Few more get up later and start making eggs and toast. Breakfast starts around 7. As soon as breakfast is done boat owners go load minnows and final prep boats while cabins are cleaned up. Start fueling boats while the remainder of the guys are showing up and head off no later than 8. Fish until noon sometimes a little later depending on the bite. Shorelunch of walleye pike potatoes and beans that takes about 1-1.5 hours. Then back to fishing. One boat typically heads in around 6:30 to start dinner and the other typically stays out till just before dark and we rotate every other day. Drinks the until 10:30-11:00. We are a bunch of farm guys so used to getting buy with small amounts of sleep for periods of time. We spend as much time on the water as possible and fish hard because most only get up there once a year.
6024785,elkman99,2018-02-25 07:57:00,180,"Great old thread! we usually have 2 different routines, one for an outpost camp type of trip where we are all alone, and one for when we are in a camp with other folks. They are pretty close to the same, except at the outpost cabins, the #1 rule is that we have a fire going from within the first 15 minutes of arrival to when our week is up. We are kinda fire bugs lol. Also, we tend to play our old school country music a little bit louder when we are by ourselves on an island. Since we are doing an outpost trip this year, I'll give that routine: -Wake up around 7:00 throw logs on the hot coals and get fire going good again. -7:15 - 8:00 put the percolator coffee pot on the fire for some tasty Joe, and heat water on the fire for a warm shower (half the time we just jump in the lake weather permitting ) My own personal routine is I HAVE to get a shower in the morning or the world just ain't right. Me or my buddy may or may not cook some breakfast while other is showering. -8:00 - 8:30 Head to the boat and rearrange my musky lures from night before and get the starting lineup tied on to get ready to fish (usually coffee in hand, but several days it will be a bloody mary or a beer) 8:30 - 1:00 Musky fish and give each other a hard time in boat. Telling my buddy all his gear and lures are junk and he won't catch anything lol 1:00 - 5:00 back to camp, and stoke the fire again. cook a big meal, drink lots of beer, and listen to music while enjoying Canada. Example of meal: Big 3 inch cowboy cut ribeye, grilled veggies, salad, and bacon wrapped/cheese stuffed garden jalapeno peppers for appetizers. (or we do a fish fry with pike a couple of days) 5:00 - 10:30 musky fish 10:30 - midnight - put wood on fire, drink beer, eat ghetto nachos, fall asleep watching band of brothers or other great series."

The solitude time is precious and few if any are on the water at that time. Breakfast at 8 and a bit of prepping. Back on the water with wife and dog from 10:00 till 3:00PM. I'll always fish for walleyes between 11 and 1 no matter what the conditions. Relax a bit, dinner at 5 and back out at 7 till dark. Repeat.

The trip up involves a stay at the thunderbird lodge on Rainy lake.An evening of cocktails and Sirloins sets the stage to cross the border the following morning and head to camp.My partner is a restaurant owner and as such wants nothing to do with the cooking of meals, which works out well, considering that I really enjoy it.We spend as much time relaxing on the screened in porch watching the world go by as we do on the water. We probably fish 6 to 7 hours a day. The routines in our week include. Martinis and a running game of Gin after fishing. During the week we have Venison cheese burgers twice, grilled lobster tails, BBQ chicken, Lamb chops and Aged Porterhouses. Unlike most groups we only eat fish a couple times for lunch. We practice catch and release in Canada except for a few noon time fillets.The trip home has also been made more enjoyable by stopping in Duluth for the evening and again having a nice meal and a bottle or two of wine.Not much of an itinerary needed for two old friends that usually finish each others sentences."

Especially if each boat does it's own thing and fishes different parts of the lake. You can get out of walkie talkie range in a hurry on those lakes."
1411568,Wall-i-Lama,2012-03-25 19:49:00,1524,"our routine is fish, eat, sleep.....repeat."
1412684,Whopper,2012-03-27 20:54:00,340,I still can't help from being the first one up everyday and drinking a pot of coffee before you even think about getting up lol Yes I'm looking forward to the late evening dinners again reel soon
1412882,benn,2012-03-28 10:33:00,48,"Our group (usually about 9) is made up of mostly retired men. We have a couple who are early risers. They get up at about 5:30 - 6:00 and put the coffee on. At about 6:30, breakfast is started and people start rolling out of bed. By 7:30 the breakfast dishes are done and the shore lunch kit is packed and ready to go. For the next half-hour, there is a line at the john for those who need to ""do their thing"". At 8 we head out to the boat landing. Usually fishing by 9, depending on where we go. We stay near Sioux Lookout and fish a different lake every day for a week. We will hit a certain lake twice in a week. Always have shore lunch at noon! By 5 we are back to the boat landing and are having happy hour by 5:30 - 6:00. Eat dinner at 6:30 - 7:00 and are in the sack by 10:00. Some go to bed earlier. Some stay up later. Shore lunch and happy hour are never missed!"
1412909,Golden Eagle,2012-03-28 11:31:00,2642,We'll do it in 42 days. You need to see your urologist about that problem. A little extra sleep would do you good. My body needs sleep time to heal.
1413967,labsrus,2012-03-30 10:49:00,557,"Our group is a mixed bag of hard core fishermen and guys who go to get away. We are pretty flexible on schedule. A few nights we do not go out after dinner and play cards or sit around the camp fire. Most days start early, coffee is pre made in pot and the first one up in AM will turn on the burner. A quick breakfast, cereal or toast and off to the lake. Our guys only trips are at rather large lakes and we usually deceide to fish in the same general area each day to keep in touch and to see how everyone else is doing. When the family is along, I fish a few days real early by myself for an hour or two. I will make arrangements with my son and daughter to take them out at least one morning. We alos make it a day where my long time friend and myself will go out to fish and get caught up on life in general. This is usually a good time. Now you guys have ruined my Friday afternoon concentration at work."

1414449,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-31 16:56:00,1460,"Our trip goes like this. We typically arrive in camp between 10:00am and noon. Offload and help reload the plane. Do the camp inspection thing with the pilot all the while questioning the prior party in camp on how their week went. How was the weather and what kind of success did you have sort of thing? After setting up camp, we throw some brats on the grill and eat em with our homemade mustard and horseradish pickles. Then on to the lake around 1:00 to catch walleye for the first night fish fry. Off the lake around 7:30-8:00. The fillet guys get busy and my brother and I start in the kitchen. First night fry is relatively easy so we prepare huge batches of cold pasta salad and our kicked up recipe of baked beans. We keep this available in fridge for the rest of the weeks lunches. Eat and have a few cold ones and I try to get to bed by midnight after the pitch game. Up at 6:00 with coffee on. Breakfast has gone to a lighter fare for us, fresh fruit, yogurt and granola on paper plates. Will do the big egg and sausage thing on fly-out day and a pecan/banana pancake on a cool or rainy morning if we are not too mad at the fish. After breakfast when we complete our morning chores, we meet as a group at the dock. We have what we call ""dock devotions"". One of us will prepare a morning devotion ahead of time and pontificate on the dock as the rest of us listen from our respective boats. Seems to put the day in perspective while giving the glory where its due. We try to pull out around 7:30-8:00 and fish hard till 1:00 and its either shore lunch or camp lunch always consisting of walleye. If its a cold day, we will have either Walleye Chowder or the Blue Cheese Linguine with Buffalo Walleye that I make. Nice warm days are fried walleye. Back on the lake around 3:00 and fish hard to 8:00. At this point nothing really varies but the nightly menu. Second night is Smoked Pork Chops with asparagus drenched with hollandaise sauce with sweet taters. Third nights menu is Con Pollo linguine with lots of grilled peppers and mushrooms. Forth night is what I call flavor burgers with a foil pack thrown on with course chopped onions, butter, crumbled bacon, and blue cheese. We make Fettuccine Alfredo with this. On the last night I will grill up a whole tenderloin. Baked potatoes prepped and put into the oven on low is a side. Also, most every night, we serve salad or cottage cheese. On the fly-out day, we drag the boats up and scrub them out, we mop out the floors, clean the stove and oven and always try to leave the outpost camp in better condition than when we arrived. We eat like kings, party like rock stars while always being respectful to the lake and the amazing resource that we all have come to love. Yea, I've got a routine in Canada and it works pretty good!"

Like the others said, ""It's a vacation"".Our group makes numerous trips and spends a lot of time in Canada, but time on the water is precious to us and can't be flirted away.The after lunch nap is to important to miss...............Pooch"
1410510,JJJMN,2012-03-23 08:56:00,153,"We've been doing the same trip now for over 20 years. My 2 brothers, me and 2 to 3 others. Normally 6 to 7 guys. We leave Minneapolis on Saturday (Walleye Opener) morning and arrive at Sturgeon Lake (NW Ontario) about 4pm (depending on how many Casino stops we make on the way). Unload gear and setup in the cabin. 1st night we normally eat something easy like Chilly Dogs Play cards until 10-11 and call it a night. Sunday morning a couple of us will be up about 5am and get the home made Carmel Rolls going and coffee. 8am the rest will start getting up (the smell of fresh made Sweet Rolls will do that). This whole time we get to sit and watch the whole camp empty with boat after boat hitting the water (7 Cabins in the camp). Hey, were on vacation!. Get the boats in the water around 9am and be fishing by 10am. We only go about ½ mile from the dock and don't have to work too hard for enough for lunch. Back in at 1pm for fish cleaning and prep for shore lunch. This is also about the same time were fixing issues with the boats, radios, live wells, trolling motors every year it seems to be something. After lunch its time for 2 hour nap and back on the water from 4 to 6. Dinner at 7, cards and drinks until 10 for the losers, and midnight for the winners. Monday it all starts about the same way, on the water about 9am and back by 1 for lunch. We get in about 6 hours of fishing a day. Depending on the weather we fish Northerns a few times in the afternoons during the week and then 3 to 4 hours of Lake Trout fishing at some point. Pack up on Friday morning and back in Minneapolis by 6pm. Only 8 weeks to go."
1410511,new hips,2012-03-23 08:56:00,498,"Usually someones stiring by 6am, most times breakfast is on your own,usually on the water by 7:00 7:30. Meet for shore lunch about noon, sometimes fish fry but most times sandwiches, take a hour break. Fish again until 5:00pm and make big supper, clean up and fish until dark, then cocktails and card game until 11:00. Can't wait for September !!!!!"

FishingAfter-dark till 1-2:00am. Fish cleaning, dinner, clean-up, drinking and lying.We use to head to Dryden for entertainment on Tuesday night then golf on Wednesday in Sioux Lookout.

1411281,wallydave,2012-03-25 07:35:00,2151,"On an average day in camp, I tend to get up with the sun. Coffee and stroll to the dock along with a Cuban cigar will start most days. Feeling the warmth of the coffee cup in your hands, watching the mist rise from the water, as the sun begins it course across the sky. Check the boat, see if the otters have raided the minnow bucket. Wipe down the seats, by the time breakfast is a memory, the seats will be dry and ready to go. Back to the cabin, some days bacon or sausage and eggs, others cereal, more coffee. The gear is in the boat, the boat is gassed and minnowed, off to the first spot. Catch lunch for the day, head back in, most days we feast on walleye for dinner and lunch. We may take an afternoon nap or we hit the water again. Dinner is caught, back to the camp with a enough light to fry up dinner. A beer, cigar and some time watching the sunset for the day, plan on the next days spots to try. Repeat as needed!"
1411347,octanehi5,2012-03-25 10:35:00,1104,"Coffee is about the only routine in the morning, this yr we have 10 guys in two camps. so getting that many guys doing the same thing at one time is hard to do. We do plan three big meals together this yr. campfire, beers, wine, cigars well after dark. Its all about relaxing, if you need a nap take one. We also are planning a shore lunch at the far end of the lake for the whole group.The lake we fish is one of if not the best walleye lakes in Quebec. only fly to one outfitter on the lake,14""-20"" are keepers all the rest have to go back. Have a great trip"
1410119,"6'3""",2012-03-22 11:35:00,47,"Got about 12 people in our group and me and my fishing partner can't sleep past 6:00(I GET UP AT 3:50 WHEN WORKING). We have to drag most out of bed by 7:00. Eat a quick breakfast of whatever we took along. That could range from french toast to toaster waffles.We are on our own for breakfast. We all leave together cause we fish a different lake(or 2) every day.Lots of exploring for our group. We carry our boats and equipment in the back of our trucks. We do have some favorites after 10 years in this area. Shore lunch whenever we spot the smoke from the fire that one of the group started, at least when there is not a fire ban. Usually brats or chicken breast or pork chops. Sometimes we don't get fishing til 10:00 because of driving and I don't think it hurts our success too much. Fish after lunch til dimming light,sometimes earlier depending on length of drive back to the cabins. Clean fish after dark usually while the ones not so adept at it get slicing potatos and onions and get the fryer warming up. Love this time of the day .A few cold ones and B.S. We play a lot of eueker(sp.) and bed by 12:00"
1410184,Lovetofish,2012-03-22 14:07:00,458,"We have a large group of families and have been going to the same camp for many years. It's nice that everyone knows where and how to fish so we all do our own thing. We'll meet at a beach about noon to eat sandwiches or roast hot dogs. Maybe even fry fish one day for sandwiches. Back to camp about 5 to clean fish, drink a couple, and eat a lot of fish. We have one night set aside where we have an all-camp fish fry. Other then that, we eat on our own. With kids it's tough to expect them to get up early so I fish alone a couple mornings. And guess what? They stay up late playing games and cards. But it's their vacation too and I get plenty of fishing in. I don't go to make it ""work"" although we do make a portage every trip and that means leave the dock at 6 AM."
1410195,Pezman38,2012-03-22 14:49:00,3196,"We don't keep a routine, but this is basically how it plays out. Eat from 7-8, Head out for 6 doz minnows at 8, fishing spot at 8:15. Wait for the walleyes to turn on at 10, run out of minnows. Get Lunch Old guys sleep I check WC to see how to fix whatever I break. Get minnows at 3-4 and Fish till dark or we run out of minnows again."
1410254,bigwalleye1,2012-03-22 17:32:00,2632,"Up at 6, minnows at the lodge as soon as they open at 7, on the road to the landing with a stop for coffee and a donut,, boats floating by 7:30, and off for the day. Shore lumch around noon, more fishing, back to the lodge by 5:30 or 6, dinner on and a cocktail in hand immediately while we prep the boats for the next day. Our time in Canada is short, and anything that detracts from fishing and catching is to be avoided at all costs. Shore lunch is part of the Canadian experience. We start keeping fish on the last day, and have brunch with scrambled eggs, bacon, spuds and a nice melon on the last day so as not to run afoul of the limits."
1410274,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-22 18:25:00,223,I am up at 4:30 am getting the coffee and breakfast on for everyone else normally once the coffee smell comes on like the folgers commercial everyone starts to stir. While breakfast is being served at 5:30 am everyone is either fixing lunch for everyone or running to the outhouse. Someone is doing the morning dishes lots of time we use paper or foam. Makes for a easy cleanup. Out on the water by 7 am lunch is somewhere on the lake at noon then another 3 hours of fishing. At 4 pm i am heading in to get supper going someone is cleaning fish and supper is about 5 pm and a few drinks. Some take showers early but usually everyone is back out on the lake at 6:30 pm till almost 10 pm then it is showers and a few drinks and in bed by 11:30 pm. The next day is the same. We try to spend as much time as possible on the lake that is what we are there for not to sit in the cabin.
1410279,drew59,2012-03-22 18:41:00,87,"Ditto (except the going to town part). I'm not surprised you guys without wives along stay out late. The rest of us have reason to ""stay in""."

Around 7, rest of the crew starts to wake up to the smell of bacon or sausage frying, I've started breakfast & banged around the kitchen enough to wake them up! I make breakfast-eggs, pancakes, sausage or bacon, toast-and they make sandwiches, pack lunch & coolers, restock bait. Eat breakfast and away from the dock 8:30-9:00.

The group I go with does it something like this (early August): 6:30-7:00am people start waking up, having coffee 7:30-8:00am boats start shoving off, morning fish session 10:00-11:30 break for large hot breakfast Noon-5:00pm fishing 5:00-7:00pm fish clean, make and eat dinner 7:00-9:00 young guys go out for evening fishing, old timers have happy hour 9:30/10:00 old timers start falling asleep 10:30 and beyond - young bucks pound beers around a campfire We stick to this routine almost religiously."

So many days are something like this. 2-4 is historically the slowest fishing time anyway. Early risers put on coffee about 6:30 We usually just eat cereal for breakfast to keep the mess down. Everyone takes a dump and gets their gear to the boat for 8:00ish shove off Come back in around 2, have a big meal drink some beers clean it all up and back on the water by 4 Fish until dark Hang out on the deck and snack, drink, smoke cigars and tell lies.

Fish till the AM bite slows. back to camp for breakfast while the hungover people complain the fishing is terrible. Yea, it can be after 0900. LOL Maybe a mid day siesta, hike and lunch. Back on the lake by 1600, fish till dark-thirty. Dinner, back to bed."

Eating a cold fish sandwich on the move is my idea of eating lunch. Also it's hard to leave during the evening walleye bite. Walleyes don't belong to a union. They work all night at hunting a meal.Most of our fish cleaning and fish frying are done after dark. Going out really early in the morning is rewarding, but not the greatest time for catching. At least that's my experience in NW Ontario."

The rest are up by 8 and we all grab a quick bite to eat and head out by 9. Fish from 9 to 2 or so and grab a quick shore lunch or snacks in the boats. Fish from 3 to whenever and head in for fish cleaning, dinner, drinks and fun until 12 or 1. Then back up to do it again. We are not a group that has a regimented schedule and we really don't want one. Our attitude is we are on vacation and will do what comes easiest. 63 days and we will try out this routine again. TonyO"
1410048,zman8701,2012-03-22 09:15:00,100,Goldeneagle I could not agree with you more. My biggest walleyes have been caught at 2:00 in the afternoon in less than 10 FOW. In June when the sun gets high in the sky the walleye bite is on.

This is also a good time to watch the otter which hangs out at the dock. If the weather is nice I then take the kayak out for an hour or so to get some exercise. I especially enjoy looking for snapping turtles. Back to the cabin and cook a big breakfast for the kids-usually pancakes and bacon. Drink more coffee.May go fishing sometime between 10 and 4. Or may go tubing or kayaking with the kids or do some cabin repair project. Frequently don't eat lunch so usually have an early dinner. In evening kids like to swim or go tubing or if we did not fish during the day we may go out for two hours or so. Kids like a fire after dark and so do I. Sitting around a fire is a good time to talk with kids.In evening we watch John Wayne westerns, especially True Grit, the best western he made IMHO. (Who doesn't get a kick out of ""Fill your hand, you SOB?"" or watching Glenn Campbell try to be a Texas Ranger). A cold beer or other beverage may be consumed. I also try to read a book or two during the week.Very seldom fish more than four hours per day unless we have hired a guide for the day."
1410107,Cash,2012-03-22 11:16:00,73,"Usually something like this: 6-7 am - get up, have coffee and a light breakfast. Make sandwiches, pack coolers, get bait etc. On the water by 7:30-8:00. Fish, hike, sightsee, all day. Rarely go back to camp unless the weather is really bad. Back to camp 5:30-6:00. Have a couple drinks, clean fish, make dinner, do the dishes. Maybe a card game. In bed by 11:00. One night a week we usually go into town for dinner."
