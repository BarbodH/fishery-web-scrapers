6213176,johnboat,2018-06-25 08:51:00,2014,Sasquatch lives!
6213220,PRO-V16,2018-06-25 09:51:00,454,For sure!!! Must be the tree knocking all the believers talk about. We always joke at the hunting shack that sasquatch are a myth.....until it get's dark.
6212828,wantabigone,2018-06-24 15:21:00,39,"Pym Island – Hearst AirOur group of 4 flew onto the Attawapiskat River at Pym Island on June 8th for a 1 week stay. We all had great expectations for the coming week.The water level had dropped the previous week by 4-5 feet and continued to drop while we were there by maybe 2 more feet. The river currents were very powerful in most places with sporadic spots of relief where the fish could be located in some concentration. Bright, cloudless days for 5 days with no wind to break up the suns’ rays into the water. The first place the guide brings us to on Friday coughs up some decent pike and a 30 inch walleye in the other boat. What a great start! The pike fishing was tough going as the pike were either deep in the banks of the river where some weeds were or spread out throughout the river. The first 4 days did bring in a few dozen 30-36 inch pike but the elusive 40 incher was yet to be had.Finally on Tuesday and Wednesday the sky was thick with clouds and the fishing picked up in size, quantity and fighting spirit. The water had warmed up considerably over the days and the fish were fighting like real troupers. We continued to catch more 30+ inch pike and caught several quality walleye while fishing for pike. The last day brought the cloudless skies again but a wind did help break up the suns’ rays which helped make the pike come out and play a bit. We had a great week with many laughs and I was introduced to some new techniques and ways of reading the waters by our guide Norm. Speaking of which, Norm has helped me know the difference from a rock in the distance in the river from that of a moose. As Norm pointed out to me when I had mistakenly thought a rock was a moose… “moose have ears, that rock has no ears….”.We saw many beaver, muskrats, arctic turns and eagles. I was cussed by a chattering river otter and we saw a moose cross the river.On the final day I caught my largest pike of the week at just over 38 inches. That 40 incher was just not to be had this time around. I did however catch some beautiful walleye 27, 2 at 28 and a 29 inch. On our final night we had all stayed up until 2 am enjoying the fine evening and reflecting on the past week. Now for an odd experience that I will always ponder about knowing I will never know for certain what I had heard. In the dark hours of morning I had woken up and heard what sounded like someone chopping wood way out in the forest or someone taking thick logs and banging them together in a very consistent rhythmic beat. This went on for many minutes until I fell back asleep wondering what the heck I was hearing. In the morning I had described this to the Native guide Norm who said it was the ghost. There was a native trapper that was never found and is known for making loud noises and banging the sides of (his) cabin. All I can say, it was not a sound of anything an animal would make, not a woodpecker etc. Things that make you go hmmmmmmm. I just figured I would share this to add a different topic to a fishing report!All in all we had a great trip. Tight lines all. Here is a link to the camp.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOHZuEGe7zk"
6212868,adempsey2.0,2018-06-24 16:44:00,612,I have heard that knocking before. I am pretty sure it's a type of bird.
6212876,hugepike0,2018-06-24 16:59:00,28,"Loved reading the report - wish more people would do this - sounds like a good trip - i have read that there are big pike to be had there, maybe next time. what did this trip cost per person?"
6212890,wantabigone,2018-06-24 17:16:00,39,You can see listed prices here. I agree....maybe next time we can get the big pike. The huge walleye made up for it though. Fantastic for a fly in. I have only had larger at Bay of Quinte.https://www.hearstair.com/trophy-ang...-outpost-camp/
6213032,chris.brock,2018-06-24 21:17:00,112,"It sounds like a great trip Mark. I have heard that type of knocking too. Unlike Adam, I don't think it's a bird. I heard it most recently on Cemetery Island on N Caribou Lake."
6213102,Bill Krejca,2018-06-25 06:39:00,6107,"Sounds like some pretty nice size walleyes. Re: noise - perhaps the drumming which partridge make, sounds like a drum? Bill"
6213116,chris.brock,2018-06-25 07:18:00,112,"That's a logical explanation, but the noises I heard were quite different than a grouse thumping. Also, usually animal behaviors like that are associated with mating rituals in the spring, we heard the knocking a few nights in mid September at N Caribou."
6213122,Skywagon,2018-06-25 07:25:00,1106,"If there were any logging activities (even many miles away from you) it could have been that, they log 24 hours a day, those sounds really carry."
6213136,wantabigone,2018-06-25 07:35:00,39,It most definitely was not a grouse- I am very familiar with that sound. Too bad I could not get a sound bite for it. It must be an animal but what kind of animal? I have no idea.
6213138,wantabigone,2018-06-25 07:39:00,39,"There is no logging in this area BUT, I suppose it could have been a local using an axe in the dark. The timing of the hits were very consistent with no variance in cadence and pitch of the noise. I suppose a skilled axeman could accomplish this though."
