She doesn't like fish, so most of her shore lunches are canned veggies or spaghetti-o's. We typically boil a pail of water on a Coleman stove with the canned stuff inside while filleting the fish, then set it aside while frying the fish and taters. I never got sick, so I must not have eaten the canned stuff that day. No telling how she might have gotten it, though. Pretty sure she doesn't drink from the lake."

6212306,Guest,2018-06-23 02:44:00,0,I've been drinking the water right out of the lake by the dock / Float plane since 2000. Never gotten ill. scoop it up with my hand. refreshing!
6212684,GWC,2018-06-24 09:25:00,1021,"Interesting question. We've have years where we've used what ever came out of the tap for dishes & coffee. More recently, we're more aware of possible issues with water so we carry bottled water for coffee & brushing teeth. We use ice packs that can be refrozen. For dishes: dish soap & rinse in water with a cap full of bleach per gallon of water. This maybe an over kill but why risk spoiling a fishing trip."
6212706,Ogoki,2018-06-24 10:14:00,291,"https://www.katadyn.com/us/ca/368-80...mp-pro-10l_usaBeen using the above filter for years. I put hose in water pitcher and very shortly have GOOD water. Also I put pitcher in a bucket in event you get busy and forget it. Saves mopping floor. When you get home run some water with bleach in it thru filter and let filter dry ,several days before storing . I put a filtered pitcher in refrigerator and one pitcher on counter covered for coffee water. I also take a new filter along as the filter will eventually get plugged up."
6211338,turkeyriver,2018-06-20 18:37:00,80,"On our fly-in we have always boiled or filtered our drinking water even though our outfitter and his help drink water right from the kitchen tap. There are notices in the cabin that the water isn't drinkable cause the gov't says so. We always perc coffee with water right out of the tap. Here's one thing I've thought of. We wash and rinse our dishes with hot tap water that hasn't been boiled, yet have had no problems. Wouldn't that be a source of trouble if there was one? Anyway, we will continue to filter our drinking water and boil our coffee with tap water like we always have. And yeah, a electric coffee maker would not boil water like a stovetop percolator does."
6211374,Joek3,2018-06-20 19:57:00,244,"As Kona77 says, while having your last beer or scotch, boil a large pot of water. Put in fridge for next days use. Better safe than sorry."
6211394,forgop,2018-06-20 20:25:00,880,"I also used this. Great for smaller amounts, but for a larger group, I also picked up a bag filter capable of holding multiple gallons. Sent from my Pixel 2 XL using Tapatalk"

6211790,DaBirdman,2018-06-21 17:27:00,164,"Our plan is to boil water, put it through a Brita filter pitcher and use it for coffee & koolaid. Is it better to go out from shore & get water, or is water from the tap ok for boiling & drinking? Or doesn't it matter as long as you boil it hard?"
6211866,LoDo,2018-06-21 22:26:00,721,"We do fly-in trips annually and boil all our water. Whether its lake or tap from camp, we boil everything. Part of the fun with these trips is the upkeep, side jobs, camp skills, etc... You have to love the new guy that has zero camps skills!"
6212070,northerneyes,2018-06-22 12:05:00,72,"Our group has been very foolish in the past. For many years on flyin moose hunts we took no precautions. Used the water directly from the lakes. It was a joke among us as well as being true that we took tang along to mixnin the water so the little squigglies weren't noticeable. When you get older you get wiser, we now boil or take drinking water with us."
6212112,terrapin,2018-06-22 13:54:00,353,"If any of your group is overweight, consider using the water directly from the lake. I had giardiasis about 25 years ago, and the ten days of vomiting and screaming meanies melted away the pounds. The best part was the 60 miles of dirt road to get to a doctor."
6210888,55walleyes,2018-06-20 04:36:00,131,Is it safe to use lake water for coffee in the morning since it is essentially boiled water?
6210896,wallydave,2018-06-20 05:15:00,2151,"Good question, what type of coffee maker will you be using? If it's a percolator , yes the water does boil, on fly-in trips most have that style of coffee maker, if they have a Mr. Coffee style, I'm not sure how hot, and for how long the water is heated? If it's a drive-in camp, if you have room, bring some water with you. It's not worth getting sick over something like clean water."

6210930,BornToFish,2018-06-20 06:43:00,1224,"Greetings,Many fishing lodges throughout NW Ontario draw their camp water from the body of water the lodge is located near. It's often impractical to drill a well in the bed rock that makes the Canada Shield famous.Fishing lodges typically use a combination of the following to purify their water: particulate filtration, tannin filtration, uv light and chlorination.I commonly see beavers on the lakes that I now fish or have fished in the past. I believe that beavers are a common host for the parasite giardia. Thus, there is good reason for lodge owners to purify their water. I encourage the original poster to make sure that the lake water used to make coffee reaches a solid boil and holds it there for several minutes. Otherwise, go with bottled water, as it isn't worth the chance of a ruined trip.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6210942,v-bay gord,2018-06-20 07:12:00,3168,That is true and the regulations require that water treatment systems meet the standards for safe water at camps.......if not then the water sources must be labelled as non-potable.
6211018,Bstar,2018-06-20 08:53:00,564,We took a water filter with us last year on a fly-in. It was the first time we had even considered using a filter. Never got sick on any of our previous trips. Bottled water weighs too much to take in on a fly-in. We filtered the tap water into a collapsible 5 gallon container and replenished it as needed. Worked well.
6211054,kona77,2018-06-20 09:34:00,236,I would definitely boil the water for several minutes and then use it to make coffee.. As others have stated brining in water does add a lot of weight for a fly-in.. We learned of the importance of avoiding lake water on one of our earliest fly-in trips.. For many years our morning routine would be too boil as much water as possible when making breakfast and then pouring the water in containers to cool in the fridge.. Use and repeat on a daily basis. There are a number of good portable filters on the market and I know that subject has been handled on previous posts. We have been using an outfitter the last 6 years who does provide bottled water as part of their fly-in service (Clarks Resorts).. A nice service to have to avoid concerns and the daily effort of getting safe water..
6211056,U D,2018-06-20 09:38:00,249,"Get yourself a filter. I use a MSR. I can pump water from any lake or puddle and be confident. Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink, just doesn't have to be any longer.https://www.cabelas.com/product/MSR-...E&gclsrc=aw.ds"
