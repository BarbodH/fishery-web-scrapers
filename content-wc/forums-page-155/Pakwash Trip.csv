Best cabins and boats our group has ever had. Had nice weather all week, although it was very windy a couple days. There are a number of camps on Pakwash, and the popular fishing spots get quite a bit of traffic. We tried to fish ""away from the fleet"" and found a couple spots where we did really well. We also struggled a few days as well. There are some big fish in Pakwash, as we saw a couple 29"" walleye caught that week, along with a 42' northern. Our biggest walleye was a nice fat 23"" and our biggest northern was a fat 36"". We never fished for perch, but caught a number of jumbos while walleye fishing. There were a number of long time repeat guests in camp, and they seemed to do well for both numbers and size. I think there is a definite learning curve to the lake, and after a trip or two to learn the lake, results will greatly improve. We ate plenty of fish, brought some home, and had a great time. Rob and Nancy try very hard to make sure you have a great trip. Didn't re-book yet as we have a few details to work out, but looking forward to going back next year. Tim"
