6211784,hoppy63,2018-06-21 17:08:00,367,What is best bet in Geraldton for groceries....bread in particular. Want it to be as fresh as possible but don't want to get to Geraldton and find out they are sold out. Has anyone ever had issues like that???

It's a huge chain discount food market in Canada.https://www.nofrills.ca/store-locato...mpaign=Loblawshttp://www.daneffsfoodmarket.ca/#oneclickaboutusOtherwise, buy it ahead of time and freeze it. I've done that plenty of times too.If you want it really fresh, bake some! No Knead bread is pretty easy to make. Ideally you want a dutch oven, but a cookie sheet turned over and a stainless steel bowl as a lid works.https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-mak...ad-home-109343"

I now buy the food which I purchase in Canada (Canadian bread being a favorite) such as bread, vegetables, milk, and eggs, from a large store, forgot the name, on Arthur St, several blocks east of the highway in Thunder Bay.
