6211716,BlueJayBert,2018-06-21 14:08:00,15,what is the best way to keep a flat of worms fresh for a week when you don't have room in the refrigerator (beer has priority) thanks.
6211726,CamoHunter,2018-06-21 14:24:00,363,"Store bedding and crawlers in a medical styrofoam shipping cooler along with a frozen 1/2 gallon milk jug full of ice. Rotate the frozen jugs of water. 1 in the freezer, 1 on the flat of crawlers. Switch them daily. 1/2 gallon milk jugs work well, or juice containers. We usually have 3 flats of crawlers for the week, and they are never in the fridge. Been doing it this way for years with no problems.For our Boat Container, each day we head out, we grab 10 doz crawlers or so and place them in a Hagen's Keep Kool Live-Bait cooler. Around the outside of the Keep Kool Bait Container, about 12 of the Rubbermaid Mini 8oz Blue Ice containers (1026-TL-220) fit perfectly. We rotate those daily also. 12 in the freezer, 12 in the bait cooler."

Transfer the rest to a container with worm bedding.I use a small cooler, probably 2.5-3.0 gallon, and worm bedding (Frabill). I put a couple of freezer packs in ziploc bags and put two in the freezer and two in the cooler. Only the freezer packs in the cooler were in the ziplocs. Each morning I swap out the freezer packs from the cooler with the ones from the freezer. The ziplocs help keep the freezer packs clean and also helps with condensation somewhat, so your worm bedding doesn't get too wet.I've kept the cooler in the shade on the deck in the summer this way, but if you can find a shaded spot under the cabin etc that is better.Take out what you need for the day. Do not return any back into the box at the end of the day, just put ""leftovers"" in the fridge in the smaller ""day use"" container.A larger cooler is always better if you can manage it. Especially for a full flat."
6211774,kona77,2018-06-21 16:29:00,236,Agree with the feedback from the previous two responders. We always take a larger Styrofoam cooler on our trips. On the way up we will put some of our frozen food over the crawlers to keep them fresh. Once we are at the outpost we simply keep replacing frozen plastic bottles over the worms. AdamD gave you solid advise about not putting back crawlers leftover from the day's fishing. We also place these left over worms in small Styrofoam containers in our fridge and will add to them the next day. I brought back about 30% of the crawlers from this years trip from two weeks ago and they are still in good shape by simply replacing the ice packs every day.

6212384,Plotman,2018-06-23 06:59:00,394,I purchased the Hagens Keep cool bait cooler this year myself and so far it has worked very well. I think mine holds 13 of the 1026 blue ice packs as mentioned above and I bought an extra 13 so I can just keep rotaring them from freezer to the baiit cooler and not tying up valuable refrigerator space while in canada. The best price by far was found at Blains Fleet Farm that even though I had to have mine shipped it was still cheaper than anyone else. I was actually surprised that there was no mention of which ice packs fit perfectly anywhere I looked and the Rubbermaids are the best fit with no wasted space that I could find.
6212484,papadave,2018-06-23 11:19:00,151,A couple years ago I decided to have some worms sent to the lodge I was going to in Ontario. I ordered them from Windsor Wholesale Bait in Ontario and they delivered them to the lodge free. The worms arrived just before I did on Saturday. The lodge owner was nice enough to keep them in his walk in freezer for me. This was a three week trip and by the end of the second week the worms were shrinking and lifeless plus the bedding was not looking good. I ran to a Canadian Tire to get some bedding and all they had was Frabill Super Gro Worm Bedding. Within one day the worms were back to normal size and by the end of the week they were huge. I didn't realize when I bought the Super Gro that it also feeds them. I highly recommend trying it. http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/fr...0002p.html#srphttps://www.canadiannightcrawlers.com/
6213150,MikeG1,2018-06-25 08:20:00,433,I'd never suggest putting worms in a freezer.
6213304,papadave,2018-06-25 12:23:00,151,No don't freeze fresh worms! This walk in freezer was used by everyone in camp to hang their catch and never got cold enough to freeze water so keeping them in a styrofoam container actually helped insulate them from getting too cold as well as too warm.
