6211712,Lovetofish,2018-06-21 13:56:00,458,How is 502 up to Dryden this year? It was mentioned earlier but haven't seen any info since the fishing season began. Thanks.

6211724,stjoeguy,2018-06-21 14:15:00,979,"Very good. There were a couple of construction/one-lane bridges on the way to Sioux Lookout, but I don't remember which side of Dryden they were on. Both 502 and 72 were in very good shape with just the occasional, marked bump."

6212028,stjoeguy,2018-06-22 10:51:00,979,"Besides the two construction/one-lane bridges, which were no problem, there were a few miscellaneous small potholes (usually right trailer tire from the edge) to watch for, but nothing major and overall, the road was in very good shape from Sioux Lookout to St. Joe."

When we got to the top, a bear was leisurely walking across the opposing lane into our lane. By the time I locked it up and stopped, the bear had that same look......""What? You are in my space so shut up."" We were close enough to see that the bear had just taken a bath in a lake as it was dripping wet. I think we saw 5 bears on the stretch of 17 we traveled over to Eagle Lake. PjShorthorn"
