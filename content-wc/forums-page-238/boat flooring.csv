4694554,JDP,2016-04-01 13:30:00,1457,"Check the ""Boats"" forum.A lot of good information there.Use the search function once you get in the forum.What year is the boat?May be a warranty issue...Here you go I searched ""replace floor"":https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...rchid=45699410"

4694754,BornToFish,2016-04-01 14:07:00,1224,"I helped a friend replace some flooring in his Lund boats. A few points come to mind that might be worth mentioning. When you replace the floor, you are one-half way there to repair any loose rivets. Also, replace the flooring with marine grade plywood, not ""treated"" lumber. There is a difference in plywoods. Be careful when removing the old flooring as you will likely need to make a template when you cut out the new piece of flooring and also with carpeting/vinyl. Good luck!"
4695226,bigwillies,2016-04-01 16:51:00,515,when you go to pull out the old floor make sure and try and clean the old screws out as best u can so theres less chance to strip them out (they will be full of sand). any u strip out shear the tops off so u can at least get the wood out and get the screws after. always use outdoor adhesive. marine grade carpet too witch u can get in dryden. have done a few(quite a few) boats and taking them apart always seem to be the most pain.
4695266,bigwillies,2016-04-01 17:11:00,515,if u get in a bind. feel free to pm me. floors are what i do for a living so i can probably send you in the right direction.
4695962,prov1800,2016-04-01 21:22:00,5010,Thx for all the info guys ill letvyou know how it goes.
4696602,last chance,2016-04-02 07:27:00,3262,"I replaced the floor in my 21' cobia a few yrs ago. just save as much of the old flooring to lay out the new floor. I used marine plywood but any good exterior grade plywood will work. exterior plywood uses the same glue as marine plywood. its just not as smooth and has more knots. but you want to seal the wood with several coats of good sealer. you can use polyurethane or some other type sealer. make sure and seal the edges real good. I didn't know about using the polyurethane when I sealed mine, so I used a paint on truck bed liner. then I got marine grade carpet and glue from cabelas. but 1st I sealed the edges and seams with cheese cloth and fiberglass resin then installed the carpet. I did mine by myself but an extra hand would have helped. don't use treated plywood. that's right do not use treated wood."
4696610,prov1800,2016-04-02 07:28:00,5010,Yes they would do the warranty on that one board only.and i would have to bring it winnipeg to have the work done.to far to many trips.
4700658,Bill Krejca,2016-04-03 15:37:00,6107,"Wow, a long way to go. My dealer here did/is going to do mine. They are reimbursed by Lund. Bill"
