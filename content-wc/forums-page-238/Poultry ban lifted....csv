She shared with me that the Poultry Ban (due to Avian Flu) has been lifted for all states but Indiana. Travelers can bring chicken, eggs, etc. into Canada.Today, I called the CBSA and spoke with another representative and she confirmed that the ban has been lifted.CBSA contact information is in the attached photo."

4705466,roscoe33,2016-04-05 01:42:00,653,"Yes, if you can prove they didn't come from Indiana. It just isn't worth the hassle or risk of being stopped at the border, inspected, or have items confiscated. Not very hard to stop at the store after you cross the border. Drop one guy off with a list while you run to the gas station to fill up, or run to Hortons for coffee and sandwiches. Support your host country. And who eats chicken on a fishing trip? Its either fish, fish, fish, or steaks."

4706210,Shellback,2016-04-05 08:27:00,8083,"I do most of my food shopping in Canada. Now I've gotten used to centigrade temps and liters of gas, but what is it, grams for stuff in the deli? Last year I had to order potato salad 3 times to get the amount I wanted! Just show me a few containers, I tell you which one to fill up. JK, but I might run out of years, at 68 y/o, before I figure out grams."
4706618,3M TA3,2016-04-05 10:03:00,2846,"Just remember that 1 kilo (1000 grams) = 2.2 pounds. That's it. If you remember that, an old bird like yourself will have it whipped then. An old bird like yourself actually knew the 3 r's, and Rithmatic was easy peasy. A little math in the head with fix you right up and rounding off helps.... a lot."
