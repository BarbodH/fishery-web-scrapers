4693850,fishron,2016-04-01 09:17:00,317,"I would agree that the best walleye lakes have tannin in the water and a visibility factor around four or five feet in typical daylight. In those conditions we've caught walleye throughout the day. However, my favorite lake, due to the memories compiled in 25 years of fishing it, has water that's gin clear and at high noon, visibility is 15 or more feet. In those conditions, it should be walleye fished at just before dawn and just before dark. Night fishing is probably the way to go but at our ages we prefer to be sipping bourbon and kicking around the day's happenings by that time. Pike and smallmouth give us targets during the day. If there is an exception to the rule it occurs very early or very late in the season. Maybe it's early hunger or late season desire to fatten up that seems to bring more action in daylight Off the subject of lake fishing was an observation by a local Delaware river, PA guide I encountered a while back. The rivers been invaded by voracious and large flathead catfish. He now catches more walleye in the daylight hours than ever before. His theory is the big cats keep the walleye more interested in not being eaten at night and has caused a feeding adjustment. Who knows????"
4695546,kzoofisher,2016-04-01 18:38:00,5144,"An odd thing I've noticed in clear water is that once you get a walleye's attention he usually doesn't hesitate. Maybe once he moves out of cover he's in a hurry to get a meal and get back? Most of the clear lakes I fish also have good smallmouth numbers so it could be competition with them, too. Light taps and a tendency to be non-commital are more common in those 5' visibility lakes. Also a greater dependence on scent."
4699858,fsz,2016-04-03 10:09:00,144,"Thanks for the replies guys. Kzoo, how is the bass fishing compared to walleye at Windermere? From what I have read walleye are tuff there but bass can be had much easier."
4688842,fsz,2016-03-30 17:35:00,144,"Its been quiet on the board for a while so I thought I'd bring this up. Read the posts on Cliff Lake and it got me wondering- are any clear water-oligotrophic lakes known as high number producers (walleye)? As I read posts and do research, I see some common themes/responses. All things being equal (fishing pressure, size, etc.) stained lakes seem to produce better numbers of walleye than clear lakes, although the clear lakes can produce very large walleye. The opposite seems true for smallmouth. Aside from Lake of the Woods, I haven't seen many posts identifying any particular lake as being a genuinely good numbers lake for both walleye and smallies (excepting the great lakes). It seems its one or the other. I certainly haven't read all the posts or fished all the lakes, and I'm sure there are some clear water lakes that are genuinely good walleye lakes. Just curios if anyone else believes there is a general pattern. Beauchene in Quebec is a prime example. Known as an awesome bass fishery, it is not known as a walleye producer at all and I have read posts on this and other forums where folks were disappointed if they went their specifically for walleye (unless they fished back-lakes). And Beauchene is off limits-no public access- unless you go thru the outfitter so fishing pressure isn't an issue. What re your thoughts and experiences?"
4689138,Matrix04,2016-03-30 18:53:00,13,"The Beauchene outfitter is a good exemple of deep lakes with extremely clear water, with a huge number of bass, but limited number of walleyes. Even at dusk, from my experience I caught 10 bass for 1 walleye in two of their ""best"" lakes for walleyes. In those clear lakes, lake trout seems to come second as for number of fish caught.On the other hand, Kipawa Lake (just north of Beauchene) has also very clear water. But, very few bass, more walleyes and lots of lake trout. So, there is no size fits all explanation I think.But I would agree that lakes with tainted water (and normally shallow), produce a larger number of walleyes. Perch is the primary prey in those lakes, and walleyes can be found year round feeding on them in relatively shallow water."
4689226,P&y only,2016-03-30 19:07:00,133,I fish a stained water lake system and it has incredible walleye AND smallmouth. Both size and numbers.
4689690,Bill Krejca,2016-03-30 21:12:00,6107,"Generally, I have better luck with walleyes on stained or somewhat stained waters, for quantity. Clear waters maybe produce better at night, I just haven't fished at night that much in clear waters, stained waters seem to shut off as it gets dark. An exception is O'Sullivan Lake near Nakina, which is clear, and lake trout water, yet can produce very good quantities of walleyes. No bass there. Bill"
4689706,phishfearme,2016-03-30 21:19:00,1242,in-fertile oligotrophic lakes simply don't produce near the walleye numbers or size as do fertile mesotrophic lakes - just the opposite for lakers - actually mesotrophic lakes only rarely can even house lakers. it should be the same for smallies as it is for walleyes - it all depends on the food chain - so some infertile lakes may house good populations of smallies but I would still head to the fertile lakes for them phish
4692234,prov1800,2016-03-31 16:44:00,5010,Great post.another lake i would like to mention is eagle lake it is oligotrophic at the west end where the clear water and 100' deep water hold the lake trout.this part of the lake is awalleye factory for numbers as well as larger fish to.you would think it wouldnt have a population of walleyes like that but it does.as you head east for approx 65 miles the water clarity is almost zero.but for sure the walleye fishing in that section is with out a doubt much better fishing.speaking of eagle lake itt is loaded with smallmouths from one end to the other.another lake in our area that has the samecfeatures as eagle is wabaskang.i think most ofcthe deep trout lakes that hold walleye are much over looked by fisherman.these fish behave differently and most fisherman just write of a lake because they dont know where they live and how to catch them.another great lake that has both fanrastic walleye fishinv and smallmouth is cedar lake and lac suel.lac seul being around a 110 miles long.
4692386,Obabikon,2016-03-31 17:31:00,2370,"I run into this issue a lot of times at sport shows. People come up and say something like... ""lake of the woods? No walleye in that lake"". I ask them if they stayed in Sioux Narrows... clear water walleye fishing can be TOUGH."
4692946,kzoofisher,2016-04-01 03:13:00,5144,"It certainly can Makes for a very satisfying challenge when you get it right. Still, when a solution comes for the mussels you won't hear many people cheering louder than extreme water clarity crowd."
4693314,Obabikon,2016-04-01 07:24:00,2370,"Absolutely. Also, if you know what you're doing in the clear water, you can be VERY successful. There are people that go, not knowing the difference... and end up not knowing what to do. (I wouldn't have the slightest on how to catch fish in clear water)."
4693490,prov1800,2016-04-01 07:57:00,5010,I find this a problem that i have heard from many anglers that have booked trips on clear lakes.them folks are all pumped up and go out with a few spots the camp has giving them and come back with a big fat zero.Having never bern told tge walleyes are tough to come by BUTthere are other species that will bite at times.Hard to have repeat business on these kind of lakes except for the anglers that like these challenges. I know a few of them and they wouldnt give up on these lakes.due to less traffic on these types of lakes is worth t to them.i dont blame them as i frequent these types of lakes as well.
