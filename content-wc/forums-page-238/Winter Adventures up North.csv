4700442,fishnwo,2016-04-03 13:39:00,16,Thought some of you might enjoy this video... one method we use to haul supplies to our remote fly-in outposts is in the winter time over the winter roads and ice. This year we brought along a film-maker to capture the adventure. This trip was to Shabumeni Lake (near Birch). We are building an addition on the cabin as well as a new dock so needed lots of lumber and other supplies. This trip took place in February... there was ALOT of snow and slush up North this year!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R82mUge8Z_s Enjoy! Anyone else have any crazy winter adventures to share?

4700754,Carnhzkr,2016-04-03 16:05:00,964,I enjoyed the video. I'd love to help out with something like that. At least it looks like fun sitting here in Iowa watching golf on a 70 degree day. Thanks for posting it.

4700938,That Minnesota guy,2016-04-03 17:03:00,8293,Your green treated dock lumber looks like the stuff Menards sells. Crooked enough to go around corners. Nice video thanks for doing it.
