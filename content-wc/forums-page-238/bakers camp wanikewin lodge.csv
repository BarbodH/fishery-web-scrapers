They had a guide named Ernie who was well known in the area taking them out. We then camped through the 1960's on Wanapetei Bay in a tent. Returned to Camp Wanikewin with all 6 of us brothers, our 68 year old Dad and 4 grandchildren in 1988 and 1989 and Ken and Dee Baker were the owners. I have to say that it is a nice camp and would stay there again. We fish mostly in the French, some in the Pickerel River, and it is good smallmouth fishing. I enjoy throwing 1/4 ounce tender tubes in the Flat rapids and virtually anywhere smally looking. Walleye fishing is better in May. We had American Plan in 1988 and the food was very good. We have fished out of the French River Lodge which is closer to the fishing area we use, but it is not as nice as Camp Wanikewin. Have a good trip, Don"

I am now 51 year of age. last year was probably the most enjoyable time I have ever had with respect to the Owners Ken and Dee, and my family enjoying the scenery, boat rides, fishing, swimming, visiting the main lodge, feeding the chipmunks by hand, afternoon play fishing with my kids on the docks and real fishing in the boat. I did get some self time in the boat to hit it hard and I can tell you it was pretty non stop fishing action. Red and white large jitterbugs for Bass and occasional pike, tons of pike on #5 red and white Mepps. If you want to fish for pike and bass - we caught as many as we wanted to whenever we wanted to. All the way in the back at musky Bay turned out to be a surprise honey hole for larger pike, I tried it for fun but it was a little murky and then I got a nice hit, then caught several nice pike. 30 plus inches. Nothing huge, but I am sure they were there. I kind of blew it for the walleye (Pickerel) as I tried around the shores in about 10 - 15 foot of water. it works well in the spring, but late summer I should have gone deep. My mistake and I will make up for it this August as we are going again. I gave the whole experience considering I was there with my wife and kids an A+. Every had fun, was entertained and always something to do. We walked moose trails in the woods, swam around islands, and saw a black bear on the shoreline. I can not wait to get back. Ken and Dee are truly hospitatlity plus people. They are both Gems. -Jeffrey"

Mostly seeking eyes and large pike and other adventures such as you listed. The Bakers seem super nice from my calls. Small world--she is a retired teacher from Akron, Ohio and I'm a Science Teacher in the same system looking towards retirement in a few years. The boats look ample--would it make sense to bring a transom mounted elec. motor? I'll be bring a portage Humminbird since they don't provide those either. Would bring my 2007 Lowe 165FM but they only give a $100 break so it will stay in Akron--going to miss the new Humminbird 360 Imagining and 60hp 4 stroke with single counsel. Was this your first trip? Any spots you want to share--Dee said Ben will also help. Thanks, David"
4715258,bigcreekdad,2016-04-07 18:30:00,74,"Hi I haven't benn to Kenny's place in a long time....it's my my bucket shortlist. Kenny and Dee are the best! Cabins are very good, as well as the food. I have a few thoughts: 1) Take your boat...it will allow you the ability to run all the way to the lower French going west, and a quick trip east to the ""power lines"". Ken's boats are quite good, but if you have your own boat you will not regret bringing it. 2) If you are going in July, your focus will be on bass, pike, and muskie...a little late for walleye...but if you want to target them fish very late, and get advice from Ken. 3)Try a lot of topwater. Even big topwater....I've seen some of the biggest muskies in my life on that water..I mean serious fish! 4)Spots...Unlike the French, the Pickerel does not have a ton of bays, fingers, etc. They are obvious on a map Ken can give you. Good luck, and report back. Also..say him to Ken a Dee for me. John from Toledo, Ohio"
