4724994,prov1800,2016-04-11 08:09:00,5010,Nice video Tyler.cant wait to fish from a boat rather than standing on ice.Great fishing on Cliff Lake and catching and releasing those walleyes is great practise but i did hear you say you where fishing in 30 ish feet of water which potentially is a death sentence for walleyes.I realize fishing deep toward fall is easier but should be avoided at all costs or the catch and release is useless.I personally wont fish deeper than 25'and i let guests know the reason .just my 2 cents.
4543121,reconssd,2016-02-13 16:14:00,147,I attended the Milwaukee Muskie show and came across Cliff Lake Resorts. Looks like a nice place and the weekly rate isn't bad. Have any of you fished here and what was your experience? How was the fishing and would you go back? Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences.
4543385,ripnlipstaknnames,2016-02-13 18:49:00,27,"I fished here about 7 or 8 years ago, the lodge was OK then but it was the year the new owners were taking over so I'm sure it's better after a few years. It's a really cool lake that I would go back to. Very deep cold water, lots of lake trout (even though we didn't really fish for them much and didn't catch any). We had a really tough time finding walleyes however, I've been going to Canada for 16 years and fished about 8 different lakes up there and this was the toughest walleye fishing I've had. That being said, the smallies, northern and musky fishing was awesome! You could catch bass ask day long if you're into that, and lots of pike in the mid to upper 30 inch range. The only reason I haven't been back is because our number 1 target is walleye (like most probably) but if you just want to catch fish is a great place. Not saying the walleye fishing can't be good, may have just been the week, or maybe it was just us."
4543945,troutwater,2016-02-14 06:22:00,299,"Stayed at their Muskie Bay area summer of 2014. Great people for sure, and very helpful. We had a coil pack go out one day and one of the maintenance guys knew exactly where to go and even offered to go get it for us. Fishing was good as we were mainly after muskies. We found the pike fishing to be average at best, but that's kind of what it's known for since the muskies are plentiful. We fished for walleye for only a few hours and had some success, but it was just to kind of kill time. Tyler and Sarah are great and can put you on fish. I know we'd definitely go back again."
4545617,JayM5209,2016-02-14 14:40:00,1050,"Over the past 38 years of trips to NW Ontario I've fished Cliff at least one day, often two, during each week long trip while staying at another camp in the area. Over the past six or seven years I've been adding a 3rd trip each year to do a solo venture and four times have stayed at Cliff Lake Resorts, three times at Lost Bay and last year at the newly redone Musky Bay Camp.I fish Cliff for lake trout almost exclusively, especially in the first weeks of the season when the water hasn't started to warm yet and the trout are taken long lining cranks or spoons in the top 15 FOW. It's a real hoot, and it is not uncommon to catch a musky or large walleye while trolling for the lakers. Musky, lake trout and smallies are abundant. As a laker lake with lots of deep water I do not call it a numbers lake for walleye, but the ones there are larger and beautiful fish. Over just the last several years the number of 'eyes has increased significantly. The staff are excellent: helpful, informative, pleasant, eager to serve the guests, will put you on fish, and work to ensure a pleasant stay.Check out their website and FB page for more info and pix. Also, Cliff is Butch Furtman's favorite multi-species Ontario lake and he does at least one program on the lake every year. Cliff Lake Resorts may have a link on their website to some of his video. If not, look for it at http://butchfurtman.com/, the web site for ""Butch Furtman's Sportsman's Journal.""There is at least one local guide who works on Cliff regularly with clients and is a frequent WC contributor. He may jump in here with more info. I will continue to fish Cliff so long as I can make the trips to NW Ontario, particularly for early season lakers. It won't be a substitute for several other camps on other lakes in the area, rather a regular ""in addition to . . . ""Hope this is some help. Have a great week wherever you go."
4546889,prov1800,2016-02-14 21:40:00,5010,Ok jay ill bite.lol.I do spend some time on cliff lake an absolutlg love fishing there.As mentioned and toralkg agree that bass fishing is crazy there.Its my wives favorite place for smallies with her fly rod.Lake trout and muskie fishing is also on the good side most days.But most fisherman are looking for good walleye waters with some decent action.Cliff lake is definatly not your destination.if your looking for quality fishing then it is.cliff lakes walleye population is fairly good but are some of the hardest fish to find.being a very deep and clear lake makes it tough to find them on sunny days.they tend to suspend a lot and just wont bite on some days.over the years and to this day once walleye season opens the lake tends to stay fairly quite and dont see a lot of boats.so if you enjoy some peacefull days and have patience and fish for the other species you'll probablg have a enjoyable week.
4561617,reconssd,2016-02-19 11:10:00,147,Thank you for your feedback. I really appreciate it.
4562353,MikeMcC,2016-02-19 14:03:00,72,Cliff Lake was my first canadian fishing experience about 35 years ago. What great memories from that trip which got me hooked on NW Ontario. I remember we portaged into a couple of really good muskie lakes named Evening and Little Evening. Not sure if those waters are still fished but it was a great adventure.
4562465,JayM5209,2016-02-19 14:30:00,1050,"The three connected lakes are Mystery, Evening and Twilight. In my early years in NW Ontario I used to motor up the creek in a 14' camp boat with a 6 hp Johnson to fish for walleyes in all three. The beaver dams got pretty high some years! Cliff Lake Resorts has a boat cached on one of the lakes so it can be accessed without doing the long creek/beaver dam adventure. They also cache boats on several other nearby lakes that provide very good walleye fishing.Oh, the memories of changing the shear pin on one of those little Johnsons half way down the creek when you're praying you'll make the landing on Cliff before it's totally dark!!"
4572521,MikeMcC,2016-02-22 19:00:00,72,Yeah great memories when you add in a little extra adventure. I think what we called Little Evening is the small lake just east of Evening. That was my favorite and would like to try to get in there again some day.
4683602,pikeandtina,2016-03-29 09:31:00,145,"Just wanted to say thanks to the people who responded to this thread. Based on your responses, I booked w/Cliff Lake for July 2nd...taking my 17-year old daughter, which is the best part! Appreciate it, John"
