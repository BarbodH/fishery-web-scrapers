4699522,v-bay gord,2016-04-03 08:23:00,3168,Too many generalizations about trolling. In my mind it's a non-issue.....unless you want to include the walleye guys trolling with a mast and planer boards...they take up a lot of water.
4699642,Obabikon,2016-04-03 09:00:00,2370,"I've never seen that except on Lake Erie... every musky fisherman (including myself) trolls in a very similar way. It does come down to showing courtesy on the water, but at the same time... musky being stocked in a lake will lead to more traffic on that lake. Guys who fish the lake now, do not want that. Again, I am not against stocking. I'm just saying that it isn't ALL positive. I also believe they need to lay out a 20 year plan, and stick to it. If they say they're only going to stock a handful, then that's all they're allowed to stock."
4699770,NP4ME,2016-04-03 09:44:00,378,"Obabikon, The MN DNR does have a long range plan. This stocking is a part of that long range plan...to give additional opportunities to those that fish muskies. You only want them to be ""allowed"" to stock what is on the plan, well I don't think you have that much to worry about. Look at the battle they have to just stock the few lakes that are on their plan. As for musky leading to more traffic on a lake, you just might be right. But those are PUBLIC waters. I'm sure not many people want more traffic on ""their"" lake, but that shouldn't even be part of the argument. That is the argument being proposed by a lot of the home owners. In terms of your trolling argument, I completely agree with Gord (as I do MOST of the time...even though I know he is against the stocking). Your generalization of musky trollers I think is way off base. As others have stated, I believe it comes down to the person operating the boat. As I said before, I have been far more upset with fellow walleye anglers' antics than what I have with musky guys. My two pennies."
4699938,P&y only,2016-04-03 10:21:00,133,"my experience has been that adding a predator fish to a body of water often makes it a mediocre fishery for all. So, I would be opposed to adding muskies to any lake that was ""good or great"" for some other species. If the other fishing is just average, throw em in."
4700050,v-bay gord,2016-04-03 10:59:00,3168,"Thanks NP4ME........but I'm not really against stocking musky in Minnesota. I just happened to agree with Al when he brought up the point that an organized lobby group should not sway the final decision simply because they are more organized than the general public. At least that is the way I took it. Decisions like that should always have a good basis in fisheries management, and an overall management plan based on science. I can see why some would oppose it, and some would be for it."
4700770,NP4ME,2016-04-03 16:11:00,378,"Gord, I think there are organized lobby groups on both sides. There is Muskies Inc. and the Lakeowners' Associations. Obviously, both have their motives. The difference I see is the YEARS of research and hard work put forth by the DNR in their LONG RANGE plan, which supports MI. I have to trust the experts on this, and that is not the lakeshore owners. They have used several different methods of BS propaganda. It started with using the walleye as a scapegoat. That ended when numerous studies showed they were 100% wrong. Somewhere along the line they got so desperate to use the line that people were getting massacred (or at least were in fear of) by the ever so dangerous muskellunge. To me, it just gives the appearance of desperate fear mongering on the part of the LOA. NP"
4700890,v-bay gord,2016-04-03 16:48:00,3168,"I do have a problem with how the lake shore owners are being portrayed in much of the conversation over this issue. In some ways they have the moral high ground in my opinion. They are not asking for change, they want to preserve the lake the way it exists. Those who want to change a lake's biology need to have the burden of proof placed on them....at least in my opinion."
4702690,Obabikon,2016-04-04 09:03:00,2370,"Last post on this. My point about everything is that there's two sides to everything. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with musky trolling generalizations. I'm just trying to point out that there's positives and negatives to stocking. Stocking lakes negatively affects some, and offers additional lakes to others... it isn't cut and dry.I'm pro stocking in most lakes, but at some point, they need to stop.Oh, and to genetically breed muskies for size, then stock them into lakes that they will have zero predators and unlimited food.... yeah, that shouldn't ever count as a world record."
4720810,NP4ME,2016-04-09 18:59:00,378,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=338TH_pwiAI I think this pretty much sums it up.
4698658,Obabikon,2016-04-02 20:09:00,2370,"The casting (in my opinion) isn't a big issue. It's the trolling. I'm not saying they shouldn't stock some lakes (they already have for many years). I'm stating that they don't need to stock that many of them. On a side note... I believe that any lake that was stocked, should never hold a world record. Since they were grown unnaturally. (just my opinion)"
4698698,NP4ME,2016-04-02 20:16:00,378,"Obabikon, I'm with you about trolling, but that is a whole other can of worms! I know you are saying they don't need to stock that many of them. They stock less than one percent of them at the moment. They are proposing to only stock a handful more. I guess I just don't see the problem."
4698714,zeebee,2016-04-02 20:30:00,1144,"....""trolling an issue""....""stocked fish shouldnt count""..........where do you guys come up with this stuff?"
4698746,Obabikon,2016-04-02 20:35:00,2370,"Zeebee... the reason I believe stocked muskies shouldn't count. They KNOW that the first generation of stocked muskies grow the largest. They have no major predators once they reach maturity, and have nearly unlimited food sources. If someone grows a large mouth bass to a record by feeding them in an aquarium, it doesn't count. This isn't a big deal, just my opinion. Large musky lures trolling past guys jigging is an issue. They cut corners, and end up tangling with guys who are stationary. If you've never seen that, you're very lucky."
4698810,v-bay gord,2016-04-02 21:31:00,3168,So does that mean that you disagree with people trolling for walleye? Is trolling the issue...or just a-hole anglers?
4698858,Obabikon,2016-04-02 21:53:00,2370,"There's a difference in speed trolling with 9 hooks, vs. trolling for walleyes. A-holes are everywhere."
4699098,Fisherman Ted,2016-04-03 06:04:00,461,"There are also walleye, bass, snook, tarpon, pike etc. fishermen who can be complete morons and disrespectful. There are no shortage of fishermen in the world that think they own a lake. And walleye guys can and do troll all the time. And pike fishermen. Even bass guys from time to time."
4699162,That Minnesota guy,2016-04-03 06:24:00,8293,Trolling is trolling. Neither the bait nor the fish knows the difference in baits or species. It's the person who is running the boat that you would have a issue with. I can be as big a dick trolling for Walleye as I can be trolling for Pike or Muskie. It's about being respectful and using common sense. But this also works both ways. Anchored up fisherman (regardless of species) need understand that they don't own a 200 yard radius of where they are fishing.Trolling large secluded (think Canadian) lakes you shouldn't need to crowd anyone regardless of how you are fishing. There is room for everyone. My reasoning on fishing is if you need fish so bad that you will move in on a guy or troll close enough to see what kind of sandwich he is eating you should just stay home. Go to the store and buy a fish. You should be able to relax and enjoy your day and not stress over whether somebody is to close to you.
4699194,turtle chain,2016-04-03 06:27:00,1398,in our neck of the woods Musky is king all the other fish are miss managed. We have more class A #1 lakes with in a few miles from our place in northern wi my 2 cent's
4699298,Obabikon,2016-04-03 07:29:00,2370,"That comment is not true. Trolling for walleyes is slower and much more vertical. Trolling for muskies is faster and usually further behind the boat (unless you're trying prop wash trolling). I completely agree with you that jerks are jerks. There's jerks in every group of fishermen. Again, I'm not against stocking at all. But, it isn't 100% positive for everyone involved. It has positives and negatives."
4696034,NP4ME,2016-04-01 22:26:00,378,"I am posting on this board because I know most people on here are walleye fisherman. I'm sure a lot of you have heard about the musky stocking controversy going on in MN right now. I am interested in your thoughts about stocking musky in new MN waters. I consider myself a multi-species fisherman, and I love to catch all that swims. I am totally against the bill that is being put forth to stop the musky stocking. I love being able to have the opportunity to fish for all sorts of fish and why not give more access to that possibility? I have listened to some of the opposition's propaganda and a lot of it is just plain hogwash (people afraid to get in the lake because they are worried a musky is going to attack them). Of course, some are saying the muskies are eating all the walleyes, but most people know that's not true (and science has proven that). As a matter of fact, my favorite MN walleye lakes all have muskies stocked in them. Your thoughts, please."
4696066,Obabikon,2016-04-01 23:06:00,2370,"Well... I'm not a huge fan of over stocking. There's a couple reasons... first musky ""bites"" do happen. Not often, but its a legit threat. I've heard several stories of people dangling their feet in the water and ending up with 30 stitches. Is that a reason to not stock? No, I don't think it is. More importantly... I want to say I'm a musky fisherman. I love it, I'm passionate about it. However, there are musky fishermen out there that are TOO passionate, and come off as rude, and over aggressive. I believe that there should be lakes that don't have to deal with people trolling or casting for muskies."
4696682,That Minnesota guy,2016-04-02 07:45:00,8293,"There is a thread going here with over 100 replies. People are on both sides of the fence. Contact your representative, nobody here votes on the bills."
4696722,kzoofisher,2016-04-02 07:50:00,5144,"I have nothing against stocking musky in principle, especially in lakes where stocking to create opportunities is already a main focus. The excuses from some of the opposition are absurd but that doesn't mean that the advocates are entirely to be trusted or that the MNDNR can't be pressured by those with the best intentions*. Talk of the introduction of an apex predator without any possible downside finds me skeptical. With an abundance of prey and an appropriate per acre stocking there's no problem, underestimate the prey or the level of predation from other predators and you can have a problem. In a lake where walleye are entirely or almost entirely dependent on stocking the risk of imbalance is small because population adjustments can be easily made from year to year, either by stocking fewer walleye or musky or by increasing limits on them. With significant nat repo the risk increases and when you get an imbalance you have to try to get a handle back on predation purely from the top. The #1 predator on every lake is in boats, luckily that is also the predator whose consumption we can externally control. That predator unfortunately is also the only one that is going to yell at the government. When limits have to go up no one complains much but if they drop, well we've all seen the circuses that creates. And musky do attract more fisherman. Those extra fisherman may end up taking more walleye and that extra take may result in lower bag limits. That's a valid concern. On smaller lakes, under a few thousand acres, it can be a very valid concern. *Big debate in Michigan over the last few years about expanding bass fishing year round and also tournament fishing year round. The advocates presented lots of good arguments for catch and immediate release January to the end of May; some much weaker arguments for having tournaments with catch and delayed release during the same time period. They were very well organized and applied a ton of pressure on the DNR; luckily, the DNR has gotten pretty good about holding public meetings and doing surveys so the concerns of the general fishing public were heard. These concerns mirrored those of DNR biologists and helped them argue patience to the politicians on the Natural Resources Council. Some serious science is being done and in a few years we will be able to make a much more informed decision. The bass guys meant well and were passionate. That was exactly why they had trouble seeing the risk of their proposal. Musky guys also tend to be very passionate, too."
4697250,NP4ME,2016-04-02 11:05:00,378,"Obabikon, I agree, there are musky guys that are very passionate and aggressive (I probably can get that way at times), but I have seen similar behavior with anglers for other species. There is not a whole lot that bugs me more than when I'm on my favorite Canadian walleye spot and here come three other walleye guys roaring up on me, only to anchor up within arms reach when there are thousands of acres of other empty spots for them to fish. Same can be said for bass guys, especially when there is a tournament going on. As for your statement about believing there should be lakes that don't have to deal with people trolling or casting for musky...I think MN already has almost 12,000 of them. That Minnesota guy, Thanks for being ""that Minnesota guy."" I appreciate your snide remark. It really added to the discussion. I looked for a thread on this topic before I posted, and I wasn't able to find one. I hope you will accept my most sincere apology. NP"

4698378,NP4ME,2016-04-02 18:26:00,378,"That Minnesota guy, thanks for the link. I just got done reading all the posts. Interesting discussion. zeebee, I see your point; however, it seems the health of the ecosystems that contain muskies have no negative impact whatsoever (and science proves that). The contrary could almost be argued. My favorite MN walleye lakes all have muskies. And I don't think they are just my favorite walleye lakes as there are piles of boats stacked on top of each other fishing for eyeballs as well. turtle chain, I find your comment ironic. MN has what, about 12,000 fishable lakes? Of that I believe less than 100 are stocked with muskies. Of the 12,000 fishable lakes, how many contain walleye? Yet the DNR continues to stock extra lakes with walleye. Do you not find ANY irony in that? Walleye fisherman (me included) want more lakes to fish, and I believe the same can be said for musky fisherman (me included). Why not give a few extra opportunities for many to enjoy?"
4698458,Pikeslayer8,2016-04-02 19:12:00,1460,Meh. The musky guys seem ok. Now the trout guys are real basswipes.
