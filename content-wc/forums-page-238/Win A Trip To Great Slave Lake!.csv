4583321,Mike Borger,2016-02-26 05:33:00,1554,"Hey Pat fwiw I wasn't kidding. Polish up your report, keep your great sense of humour and I'd publish it. Drop me a line anytime if you want to discuss."
4583337,pjshorthorn,2016-02-26 05:34:00,5654,"Ahhhhh yes.........thanks for the reminder. We have solved the problem with Gramps making coffee and having it flow onto the countertop instead of into the pot. We have a used Kerig machine that will make the trip and we will be duct taping his cup in place. Now if we aren't there and he tries this new method on his own, no telling what will happen..... I have been working on a new and revolutionary pee bucket design for Breezy to use this year. The catch basin design of "" The Pee-in-nator"" is solid and leakproof. There has been a slight engineering delay in coming up with a harness system that will work flawlessly under all types of fishing and boating conditions. Having said that, we will endeavor to persevere. PjShorthorn."
4586905,wallydave,2016-02-27 06:25:00,2151,"I cant wait to see your final design! Of course you will have all colors and camo styles for your final design! For me Ill keep using the bedside urinal I got from the hospital. Light weight has a lid to prevent any spillage, and it was free! Im sure your crack team of engineers will solve the harness issue, selling Breezy on your design, might be a tough nut to crack!"
4587721,pjshorthorn,2016-02-27 11:23:00,5654,"I'll send you some contact info.. Just an FYI, I can't spell all those words with the Canadian ""u"" included PjShorthorn"
4589193,wallydave,2016-02-27 21:16:00,2151,"Pat, send your word document to Mike the Canadian spell check will add those Us eh?"
4589657,Mike Borger,2016-02-28 06:43:00,1554,I'm just thrilled and frankly surprised that you can spell at all! What a huge bonus.

4579497,Mike Borger,2016-02-24 19:17:00,1554,Hey Matt I didn't mean anything by my comment. Fact is Frontier Lodge requested the Facebook like be part of the contest and I thought it was reasonable.Beyond that it's a simple matter of filling out a form and clicking submit.
4579537,Mike Borger,2016-02-24 19:25:00,1554,"I was just joking, I totally respect where you're coming from on this.Only thing worth adding is I won't be selling anyone's information."
4579561,kzoofisher,2016-02-24 19:28:00,5144,"facebook is very cheap advertising for a lodge and one ""like"" can get their page on several other target audience pages. I hit ""like"" on any lodge whose page I visit just because it is in my best interest to keep lodge open and maybe someone will visit that lodge because of it."
4579849,adempsey,2016-02-24 20:36:00,963,I created an email account and a facebook account associated with it. It's not a big deal and you can just dispose of it afterwards if you want.
4580257,pjshorthorn,2016-02-25 05:13:00,5654,"Dang it. I'll be traveling home on the 6th after a week at V-Bay Lodge. To be quite honest, I'm not sure I could absorb anything else after a week there so it is probably best I opt out of the contest opportunity. Gord has quite the seminar schedule lined up for us at the lodge so I'll be anxiously awaiting our trip this year. Rumor has it that a few of the seminar topics include: - Tips and tactics on catching big lake trout with a Pocket Fisherman rod. - The best way to tell when your outhouse hole is full. - The best method to get your boat on plane when the motor is stuck in reverse. - Easy ways to remove marker buoys that have become tangled in the prop - Wood carving using live beavers. - Accurately identifying the sex of nightcrawlers. ( this class makes no sense at all. ..... ) - And back by popular demand.......How to make a mink lined athletic supporter for those cold fishing trips. As you can see, our week has full schedule. Mike, if you need a copy of my seminar notes for future articles in your magazine, I'll be happy to send them along. Best of luck to everyone who enters the contest. Sounds like a relaxing week. PjShorthorn."
4580313,Mike Borger,2016-02-25 05:54:00,1554,"No, but you should be writing a humor column for me I think. Too bad the dates don't work for you!"
4580481,wallydave,2016-02-25 06:57:00,2151,"Pat, ask Gord to include a couple of safety seminars, sake coffee making and proper pee bucket use!"
4580505,Mike Borger,2016-02-25 07:01:00,1554,"For some reason ""wood carving using live beavers"" cracks me up. Awesome LOL!"
4582953,kona77,2016-02-25 20:34:00,236,There is nothing more fun than catching big Laker's.. Someone is going to be a very happy fisherman(woman) in August..Great opportunity..
4583297,pjshorthorn,2016-02-26 05:16:00,5654,"Mike, I'll be sure to publish a trip report this August when we return. There should be enough hijinx during the trip to easily round out a one page article I'm sure each member on the trip will contribute equally to the overall silliness we usually experience during our week in Canada. Take care, PjShorthorn."

4579489,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-24 19:10:00,8293,"Mike you are right I don't get involved in many places outside of here. I have found no matter what anybody says they want one thing..............your e-mail address. Sometimes they sell it, sometimes they use it. I'm very happy not knowing what is happening on facebook, besides if it's important won't it be on WC?"
