4690170,Pooch,2016-03-31 06:49:00,4619,"Seems like about once a year we get caught by a storm. Nearly always it's when we are fishing and there is a treeline between us and the storm. The first we realize that a storm is approaching is when we start hearing thunder. By then it's usually too late to beat feet for the cabin.I've both made a run for it and also I've taken refuge on shore. It's a lot less exciting but much more comfortable on shore. Your gonna get a wet butt either way. I'd rather get wet on shore.We all do dumb things when young, but hopefully we (me) do less as we age.Pooch"
4690266,BornToFish,2016-03-31 07:08:00,1224,"WallyDave said it perfectly: ""Live to fish another day"". Mother Nature will always win. There are a few things worth keeping in mind. One is that I keep a radio in my cabin to catch the local weather forecast from CKDR in Dryden. I listen each morning for the weather forecast, especially for wind and potential for storms. These forecasts are not a guarantee, but I don't want to overlook relevant information. My wife and I keep high-end Cabela's raingear in a dry bag in the boat. It's nice to have when we get caught on the lake during a rain storm. I've learned to keep an eye on suspicious looking weather. I've learned the location of sheltered bays throughout the lake system that I fish. I just pull the boat up to a good spot on shore and tie off. Since I am responsible for damage to the boat, I try very hard to find a spot sheltered from the wind. I don't want the boat to get pounded onto rocks. A few years ago in September, I was fishing for muskies just before a major storm arrived. I was on one of my better ""big fish"" spots, so I pushed my luck to the last possible moment. I pulled up to an island, just as the storm let loose. I hunkered down as best that I could. I was staring at the floor of the boat to prevent water from running down my neck. I looked up when the storm finally relented. There was an otter in the water about three feet from the boat. The otter was looking directly into my eyes. He had a look on his face that if he could have talked, would have said ""are you stupid or something?"". Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4690450,JayM5209,2016-03-31 07:54:00,1050,"Some really good advice in this thread! My 1st option when nasty weather is approaching is to get off the water - now! The fish will be there after the front passes and I'm not about to demonstrate how great a stick of graphite is when functioning as a lightening rod.In almost 40 years of trips to NW Ontario my group has five or six experiences of making shore and sitting out a storm while hoping there's a tree close to ones we're under that is just ten feet taller. These times still come up in the evening cabin story telling sessions, and we have vivid memories of which lake, who was in which boat, and exactly where we made shore.An old timer with lots of bush experience told me long ago that when looking for the lightening while watching a storm front approach and you hear thunder, you're already too late and have waited too long before getting off the water. A tip to make sitting out a storm just a wee bit easier - I have a small 14"" or 15"" duffle bag that never leaves my boat. The piece of duct tape on the side reads ""Overnight Emergency"". I've never been stranded overnight but that bag gets checked and, if necessary, replenished every spring when the boat is prepped for the season. Next to several lighters and candle studs to help fire starting, the most important item in there is a 9'x12' plastic drop cloth. It's provided shelter from downpours on more than one occasion. It sure feels good to be dry after the rain stops, the wind is still blowing, and the temp has dropped 12 degrees!P.S. Buy a couple of the cheap drop cloths but DO NOT unroll or unfold them to see how big they are. When refolded to stow they always take up at least three times the amount of space than they did when factory packaged!"
4690818,Fishoil,2016-03-31 09:34:00,1277,ALWAYS get off the water at the first signs of a storm. The weather up there comes in like our weather on steroids. A few years ago we were heading back to camp because of an incoming front and saw a huge bolt of lightning strike the woods about 1/2 mile from camp while we still had a couple of miles to go. By the time we got to camp we were seeing smoke and ended up calling the fire in to the Ministry. The only good part about it was I got some really cool pictures of the water bombers doing their thing.
4691034,LOW1,2016-03-31 10:22:00,2828,Agree 100% with the get off the water fastadvice. The only thing that I would add is that especially in the early part of the season you need to bring dry clothing and/or a tarp. Getting wet in August is usually no big deal. Getting wet in mid May or even mid June can get you really cold in a hurry. I keep a tarp and a number of those reflective rescue blankets and of course fire starting stuff in the boat. I have not had to make a fire but have used the blankets.
4691570,Lovetofish,2016-03-31 13:35:00,458,"Get off the water, the sooner the better. If you have to pull up on shore move away from your boats. Those storms usually don't last very long. The camp I go to has satellite TV in the lodge so we check the weather forecast most mornings. Or the owner gives us a heads-up. If there is a threat we just fish closer to camp. As a greenhorn we were caught with our pants down more than once."
4692410,eyemike,2016-03-31 17:40:00,233,"One year my dad and I were fishing Little Vermilion. We were quite a long distance form the camp when the weather changed really fast. We quickly put on our rain gear and started heading back when a big water spout was heading right toward us. My dad was operating the boat and was very good at it I might add. He headed for the nearest island. waves were crashing over the boat. He kept tacking back and forth through the waves until we made it to the island. Of all my years on the water, this was the worst weather I have ever been in. As we were waiting out the storm a boat was trying to head back to camp, they were almost sunk. They had so much water in the boat that the gas tank was stuck up under the motor handle and they couldn't steer the boat. They finally got over to us, it was a father and son from camp. Neither of them had rain gear and were both wearing shorts and tea shirts, both were freezing. We had extra jackets in our dry bag that we gave them along with hot coffee. When we got back to camp we were the only two boats still out. There were some very concerned people waiting that day. Those two guys said if they hadn't seen us they would have probably drowned trying to get to the docks. Sometimes good reasoning will overcome fear. Thank God it did that day."
4693434,tv4fish,2016-04-01 07:47:00,2694,My group has also been caught on Lac Seul in BAD storms. All of us not only have good rain suits but also some type of rubber footwear (like boots that go over our tennis shoes). It's not fun to end up with soaked socks/shoes in the cooler weather. Yup - we also beach the boat and stay as low as we can. Seems like Canada can get SUPER lightning.
4693962,octanehi5,2016-04-01 10:06:00,1104,"A full set of good rain gear is always in the boat,In a thunder storm witch usually come in quickly,seek the lee side of land or island get out of the boat.In a all day rain and wind storm you want to stay dry ,the fishing is great during these storms. Life vest a must,Your ability to run a boat in rough water is a key factor."
4694250,canarch,2016-04-01 11:35:00,4,"fantastic thread - thanks guys some great information for someone who is very very inexperienced in boating but will be taking my father and brother up north end of may for a fishing adventure. having a cottage north of the Sault Ste Marie we know how quickly the weather can change will certainly be checking out landing spots during good weather just in case and will be adding a few more ""essentials"" to the boat bag such as tarp and candles."
4694618,johnboat,2016-04-01 13:39:00,2014,"I can't imagine leaving the dock WITHOUT raingear in the boat! One thing to add: Keep your eyes out for others and be ready to offer assistance. There were some novices 3 years ago out on LOW when the weather kicked up, a Dad and teenage son. I'm in a 21 foot deep V, full windshield, bimini up, rain wear on, they are in a camp boat, 20 horse. Before it gets bad, I slowly motor by and ask if they would like to be lead in before weather hits us. Dad said no. Son said yes. Dad then concurred with son. I waited for them to ready up and lead them in to their camp. Next day, mid morning, after the big blow, as in trees down, lightning fires on islands, heavy rain, etc.....They come up to my boat, Dad hands me a cigar and says ""Thanks"". I said ""no problem"". He grabs my hand and says it says it again "" No. Really, Thanks!"" Trust me. He meant it!! In visiting with him he admitted he just really didn't know what to do and ""just kinda froze up"" So don't be afraid to ask if someone needs help."
4694850,Manitou,2016-04-01 14:45:00,125,And don't be afraid to pull into the closest camp.When I was a young lad we had a big bunch of girl paddlers from Camp Stevens stop by...
4694882,Pooch,2016-04-01 14:58:00,4619,"The proverbial ""Any port in a storm"".Good thread. Seems all of us have been out on that ledge at least once in out lifetimes. Hopefully most of us have grown wiser because of it.Pooch"
4695834,wallydave,2016-04-01 20:23:00,2151,"One summer on Lac Seul, early July the afternoon winds were brutal. We were hanging out in Steamboat waiting for the wind to die down. We could hear boats thumping against the wind blown waves. Several boats came out of Steamboat, we followed them into the big waves, we saw a smaller boat trying to keep up, we slowed down to let them follow in our wake. They turned after a few minutes to head home, they waved to say thanks! We need to make sure that we can help a fellow fisherman get home safe!"
4699130,Fisherman Ted,2016-04-03 06:10:00,461,"Everyone has a story. Here is one that literally hits home. Last summer huge storm blows through Northern Ontario. We track it on radar and guests go out ahead of it watching closely (as did I watch the guests from the dock). As it approaches we get all boats in but of course one boat wants to take their time to get in their last casts. They finally realize its going to be a horse-race and race for home, the system now on top of them. We all watch them come into port.They jam into the docks, with hail and lightening all around them (and us) and scramble for cover. 30 seconds later a bolt of lightening hits their (my) boat while tied up 10 feet in front of us. Blows out electronics on the motor but no injuries. They learned a lesson for sure that day.On a side note my back-up water pump was 50 feet out in that same bay. Lightening went into the pump, through the water pipes and got into the entire camp electrical system. Guests in multiple cabins were shocked while in their bathrooms and it completely blew out my 10 acre wireless network."
4694018,fishron,2016-04-01 10:18:00,317,"A buddy and I got caught in a storm once after we were on our way out from a brook trout pond walk in, leaving our small boat and motor on the main lakes shoreline. It wasn't raining buckets, it was raining barrels, and as we walked back several dead trees crashed down around us. Fortunately none were close enough to threaten us. When we got to the boat the deluge was over and the small 12 footer was about a quarter filled. With a small motor we couldn't make enough speed to pull the transom plug so we bailed. Fortunately the lake wasn't rough or we would have been stranded on shore for quite a while."
4689290,tammybrian2,2016-03-30 19:23:00,12,"something i've always been concerned with, and fortunately have not had to deal with too much, but its always on my mind on rainy/overcast days, are ideas on how to best handle getting caught in a storm (w/lightning) in canada. you're several miles from camp, dark clouds in the distance you're keeping watch on, but before you know it they're on top of you. is it best to try to run back to camp to get out of the weather, or beach the aluminum boat your in and wait it out on shore somewhere 'safer' than being on the water? what have you done in the past in these situations?"
4689298,muskyman73,2016-03-30 19:27:00,402,"We have been stuck on numerous islands from time to time when the tornado's hit Rainy River. Just try and ride it out on land, it's alot better than dying on the water ! I say this as we hit bad bad bad weather once, and we had no choice but to try and make it across and man did it suck."
4689450,That Minnesota guy,2016-03-30 19:53:00,8293,I always get off the water to ride the storm out.
4689498,Ranger319,2016-03-30 20:03:00,166,"Been caught in numerous storms over the years, still gets my stomach in knots when it happens. We fish the same spots year in year out and have found better hiding places. When fishing new areas, we always take note of good beach spots. Having a big breakfast of bacon, eggs, sausage gravy, biscuits, coffee, etc often aid in finding these spots.... We always make sure to tie off the boat as quickly and safely as possible. Leave the bilge pumps on, it's amazing how fast water can fill up a boat. Waves can crash over the back really easy when the weather turns. Stay up in the trees and wait it out and resist the urge to get back on the water at the first let up of rain, there is normally a second wave of crappy weather. I thinking it was 3 years ago, we made 6 trips to shore for bad weather. Worst decision is to think you can out run the storm. You can get ahead of the wind but with all the curves and turns on some lakes, that wind will catch you fast and remember, no way you are outrunning the Lightning. Been there, done that, have the busted up fishing stuff to prove it."
4689586,wallydave,2016-03-30 20:30:00,2151,"One year my son and I went to Goose Bay Lodge in mid June we were heading out one morning, if was cool cloudy and windy. Driving the boat I saw a front heading our way, I saw a front heading our way, my son was bundled up his back to the bow and the wind. I saw the lightening in the distance. His eyes looked like saucers! Dad , we are heading back right!? Yea we are heading back to camp. Live to fish another day!"
4689618,rather-be-fishin,2016-03-30 20:41:00,429,"13 years ago on our first time fishing on Lac Seul a wise guide said to us, ""the weather changes very fast up here, so always keep your eyes to the sky & have a safe haven in mind."" So, I remembered those words & always know of a sandy shoreline near our favorite fishing spots to go & take refuge in if need be. In our 12 years of fishing Lac Seul we have had to go to shore 6 times. It's always better to get off the lake when lightening & high winds & rain blow in. 4 months & the count down is on to our trip to Lac Seul! RBF"
4689658,Fisherman Ted,2016-03-30 21:02:00,461,"This is an absolute no brainer. No way should you EVER try to out-run a storm. Get to shore. Wait it out. Doesn't matter where, just get off the water."
4689946,fsz,2016-03-31 05:01:00,144,"I have had lighting strike within 100 feet of me 3 times, all on Canadian fishing trips. Once using the head in the middle of the night during a storm, and twice while on the water during a storm. All hits were to trees as you would expect. The first time on the water we went to shore, it hit on shore after we got to shore. The second time on the water it hit shore right in front of us before we got to shore. I redirected, stayed on the water and beelined for camp, figuring lighting could strike the same spot twice. Bottom line, in both the occasions on the water I waited far to long to get to shore. I was in my early 20's."
4690010,Baseline,2016-03-31 05:31:00,3207,"I do most of my fishing in norther MN and NW Ontario. While lighting is not usually a problem up in the north country, wind is. The big lakes up her can get rolling really fast so I also keep and eye on the surf and get off the lake when necessary. I'm off the lake as soon as I see the first crack of lighting or hear thunder. You are the tallest thing out there when on the water."
4690122,bigwalleye1,2016-03-31 06:36:00,2632,"In an electrical storm, any shore is a good shore. Some are softer than others. As others have said, scout your fishing areas and the shorelines nearby. Protected lunch spots are very good storm cover spots. If you look around, you may find a bonus new lunch spot."
