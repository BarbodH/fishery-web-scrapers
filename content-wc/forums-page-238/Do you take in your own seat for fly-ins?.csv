4555569,forgop,2016-02-17 14:24:00,880,"I don't believe any of the seats I've ever seen have been secured to the bench seat. It's been mounted to a piece of plywood or attaches to a spring loaded mechanism, so it's not as though it'll be any work to use mine."
4555625,SinOrSwim,2016-02-17 14:51:00,1528,"Must be differences in outfitters. Any of the ones we have ever had either had benches or seats that were bolted to the benches. Typically bolted on. That said, the base was very similar to what you posted so maybe there is a way to swap out the seat that is there with your own? Be worth a shot. Those seats are horrible. the one part of fly-ins I don't miss. The seats and tiny boats/motors."
4707298,123chadder,2016-04-05 12:55:00,429,"i use a padded seat with a clamp...the clamps come with clips and the trout outpost at wra has the holes already drilled on both sides of the bench seats for the clips,i just screw the clips on,click in the clamp and the seat isnt going anywhere now im not endorsing people to put holes in outfitters boats,i just got lucky a comfy,sturdy boat seat means a full day of comfy fishing"
4713250,fish007,2016-04-07 08:32:00,120,the camp we go to has plastic bucket style boat seats. I have severe r/a and after a couple of days my back hurt so badly I couldn't fish. I now bring a seating pad that is used for wheel chairs and it really helps. You sit a little higher and that makes me sit more upright plus my rear doesn't get sore.
4715314,mr-fish,2016-04-07 18:54:00,58,Have A ThermaRest Camp Self Inflating Cushion .... Just Sit On It And Turn The Air Value To Adjust And Find What's Most Comfortable For You ...Basically Sitting On A Cushion Of Air ...
4725922,123chadder,2016-04-11 11:45:00,429,having a solid back rest really makes a difference
4726586,rocko0305,2016-04-11 14:52:00,138,"If we go to an outfitter that doesn't have seats, we have found these work very well, and only weigh 4-5 lbs. They're nice because rather than having to adjust them using side straps like most stadium/canoe seats, you can easily change the slot that the seat back locks into in about 5 seconds or less.http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shop...duct/10213338/"
4550841,forgop,2016-02-16 07:18:00,880,"The typical boat seat I've seen on the Lund bench seats is just plastic, sits on a piece of plywood, and is held by a spring to keep it from sliding. I attempted to use the life vest, jackets, you name it to the best of my advantage, but my back would get so sore that I'd have to take quite a break. Just wondered if anyone else has carried in their own setup to provide more comfort while you're in the boat. TIA"
4550865,MrSimon,2016-02-16 07:23:00,922,I sure have considered it as my back gets sore too!!! But I usually just take some Advil and deal with it. It's hard to justify the extra weight.
4550977,Bill Krejca,2016-02-16 07:52:00,6107,"Perhaps when going to the same place every year, leave a few jigs home and take a seat to leave. It could be stored in a relatively inaccessible place (like under the cabin, in the woods, etc), if losing it is a concern. Bill"
4551425,forgop,2016-02-16 09:07:00,880,"In this case, I don't think the weight would be an issue for a small group. Even so, isn't a comfortable seat worth say $50 for a week on the boat if you had to pay the overage?"
4551545,LOW1,2016-02-16 09:35:00,2828,"Talk to your outfitter. I would think that high quality seats would be a cheap selling feature that the outfitter would buy. If you and his other customers would each pay $5 or $10 a week more, the outfitter could buy them and still make money off the deal as well as having happier customers."
4552937,forgop,2016-02-16 15:35:00,880,I think I've just found my fly-in setup:clamp:http://www.cabelas.com/product/boati...F104492880.utsseat:http://www.cabelas.com/product/boati...Tz_stype%3DGNUI think the total added weight is less than 20# and well worth every penny if an outfitter wanted to charge me for the overage.
4553377,515,2016-02-16 17:28:00,254,If the outfitter doesn't provide them we bring ours along and it well worth the extra cash for that once a year this for us.
4553505,unclepaully,2016-02-16 18:09:00,112,"This past summer boat seats ended up being one of our biggest disappointments to our week at the Northend Cabin on Esnagi. Many weeks before our trip I asked if there were seats for all of the boats as we have a few members in our group with very bad backs. I was told a definite yes. Well there ended up being three seats, two of which were constructed of rotted wood and not usable at all. If I had known this, we would have paid for the overweight cost and had portable seats flown in or picked a cabin that had seats. This was not White River Air's fault, as the cabin is run by one of the lodges down the lake. I know for some groups they could care less about boat seats but for a few guys who have chronic back pain, a boat seat can be the difference between an enjoyable week of fishing or a very uncomfortable one."
4554513,SinOrSwim,2016-02-17 07:48:00,1528,"I don't miss those boat seats. However, what if you took your own but the boats already had the mounted swivel plastic seats? You can't just remove those? So, taking your own may not be an option regardless. Unless you put it on the opposite side of the boat but then you would drive backwards from what you are used to. I remember being told once seats are a pain in teh *** for an outfitter. They break so easily because some of the guys using them are big guys. Lean back hard and.........snap. I don't think it's quite that simple is the point. It is one of the reasons we don't fly in. Cost for our group is one and electricity. We have people that use cpaps and don't want to deal with all that stuff."
4555481,Mike Borger,2016-02-17 13:29:00,1554,That's a very good point.
