4716418,jkaup,2016-04-08 08:25:00,56,I plan on taking a light weight for trout in the river. One for walleye jigging and a medium heavy for northern. Wouldn't mind another for jigging just in case. How many is too many considering the weight restrictions and camp boat set up?
4716570,acplumber,2016-04-08 09:23:00,80,I think that's perfect Rods n reals are usually some of the lightest things u have to worry aboutBetween 6 guys that go on ours a few end up getting broke
4716914,jveri,2016-04-08 11:38:00,70,I always bring two ultra lights or lights and two medium spinning rods. Carry a medium or medium heavy baitcaster as well for northerns. You'd be surprised how many rods you can break when some beverages are involved lol
4716930,tsquared,2016-04-08 11:40:00,57,"I will admit I have a fishing problem, I definitely get too much tackle, etc...however, it is a fishing trip and I will go lighter on other items to bring more rods, reels and tackle. I enjoy fishing various methods so I will bring at a minimum a medium baitcast to crank for walleye and smallmouth, 2 med heavy for spinners and large lures, a small jig rod and a med spin rod. I usually bring an extra rod or two as someone will break a rod (especially when you everyone has 4-5 rods in a boat). I transport the rods in a lightweight tube and the rods really don't add much weight."

I would likely take the following fishing rods: 1) Light power spinning rod for jig fishing for walleyes, tubes for smallies and perch (two of these rods or maybe switch one for a medium light power) 2) Medium power spinning or casting rod for cranking and trolling 3) Heavy power casting rod for casting for northern pike 4) Medium heavy power musky rod Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4717362,forgop,2016-04-08 14:02:00,880,"Rods weigh next to nothing so if it comes down to it, an extra rod or two won't set you back but maybe a couple of bucks if they charge for over weight. Sent from my SM-T810 using Tapatalk"
4717634,Old Timer,2016-04-08 15:41:00,255,Two or maybe three. All are two-piece in a compact case that holds no more than three. I've made a lot of fly-in trips and never had the need for more.
