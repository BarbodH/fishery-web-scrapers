4704650,v-bay gord,2016-04-04 18:17:00,3168,"You're right......I missed that on my list. The bakery is right next to the Fort, on the highway, near Bobby's Corner. Great coffee... They also have a limited menu."

Found them by accident the first time, the guy asked me what kind of coffee I drank and a few more questions, he picked the bean and the amount, made it in the french press for me and it was easily the best cup of coffee I've ever had. I am a strong coffee fan, so the me Tim Horton's is like drinking brown water, this business is fantastic. I've also had a cinnamon bun and one of their big cookies which were excellent."
4714618,prov1800,2016-04-07 14:58:00,5010,From the looks of it the old Pines restaurant is getting a remake.So might have another place open also.
4533593,v-bay gord,2016-02-10 09:41:00,3168,"I know a lot of you travel through Vermilion Bay to reach your fishing destinations. Just a heads up that a ""new"" restaurant has opened so we finally have an actual sit down restaurant for breakfast (lunch and dinner as well). It's called ""Quacker's Diner"" and is located on the highway across from the liquor store (LCBO). The other options are the ""Fort"", which was serving breakfast as well, plus some other great stuff........Buster's BBQ (always good for lunch dinner)......and the burger stand at Bobby's Corner (which also serves some breakfast sandwiches). Now we just need summer to arrive......."
4533905,3M TA3,2016-02-10 11:16:00,2846,A plug without critique. So... How is the breakfast?
4534305,pjshorthorn,2016-02-10 13:05:00,5654,"Before I opened the thread I was thinking that Susanne was going to be making breakfast for us each morning while we were in camp. Then it dawned on me that wouldn't be happening since Breezy and Gramps don't get up till the crack of noon. Since you are the Big Quacker in V-Bay, maybe we could get some breakfast at the joint one morning with a table next to the big picture window PjShorthorn."
4534753,tackleman,2016-02-10 15:51:00,444,"i saw it was open when we went through last weekend, this is just what the bay needed. how's the food Gord?"
4534921,v-bay gord,2016-02-10 17:32:00,3168,I suppose I had better follow up with some research. Will report back at a later date.......
4687666,Duflebag,2016-03-30 11:41:00,218,"Hey Gord, some of the guys were talking about our trip coming up. Any updates on how the new restaurant is? Has it affected Busters in any way since opening also? Thanks"
4687890,Blue Lk,2016-03-30 12:45:00,269,I stopped in for a burger shortly after they opened.Food was good.Busters has been closed all winter.There is work going on at the old Travellers (directly across from village corner)word is that new owners are reopening but have not heard any dates yet.
4688018,v-bay gord,2016-03-30 13:34:00,3168,"Sorry, don't have anything to add beyond what Blue Lake mentioned. I've only heard positive reviews about Quakers. Once the season gets going you'll have the following choices.....Quakers (breakfast through dinner), Busters (lunch, dinner), The Fort (sorry, forgot the name of the restaurant inside, but heard they served breakfast and the sub sandwiches are supposed to be real good, salads etc.), and the burger shack parked by Bobby's (open at 6 a.m. and has some good breakfast sandwiches)..........plus the Traveller, which I heard rumors of a June reopening....."
4689250,P&y only,2016-03-30 19:10:00,133,I'll give it a try may 28th. Thanks for the heads up~
4691042,Duflebag,2016-03-31 10:22:00,218,Thanks Gord. I am sure you are looking forward to ice out more than any of us south of you.
