4689474,Pauleye78,2016-03-30 19:59:00,57,Looking to stay in Sioux Narrows this summer and came across Crawford Camp. I'm looking for a place for the wife and myself. Has anybody stayed there lately? Any other suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks Paul
4691754,QuikNet,2016-03-31 14:24:00,237,You will not find a better place than Tomahawk Resort . The Kast Family run a super place and their accommodations and equipment are A-1 . We have stayed with them many times .

4700370,LyleK,2016-04-03 12:55:00,248,Stay at the Tomahawk exclusively. Have been to the others in the area and there is a major difference for the price difference. We have been going to the area for 30+ years and will only stay with the Kast family.
