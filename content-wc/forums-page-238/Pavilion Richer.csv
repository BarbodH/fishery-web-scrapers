4720042,Lktrician,2016-04-09 13:18:00,32,Has anyone fished at Pavilion Richer? This outfitter is located north of Maniwaki Quebec on the Clova road

4721394,F250,2016-04-10 04:40:00,75,I have not been there since the early 2000's. I did fish there three years in a row. First year was great - lots of walleyes. The next two years we struggled. Remote cabin was a 6 on a 10 scale. I did see them at the Montreal Outfitters show this year. Too many other really good places to go in PQ. I wouldn't go back there.
4722906,Lktrician,2016-04-10 14:20:00,32,I would be open to suggestions if you have some. There would be 4 in our party and would not mind getting well off the beaten path. Thanks

4724498,F250,2016-04-11 06:39:00,75,You really can't go wrong with any of the outfitters on the Gouin. I have done many fly-in and drive-in trips up there.
