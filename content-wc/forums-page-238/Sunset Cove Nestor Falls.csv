4719122,Slushfish,2016-04-09 06:44:00,263,This will be our 9th year to LOTW in July. The camp we've stayed at (and loved) has closed their doors for now. We just booked 2 wks with Sunset Cove and was wondering if anyone has any experience with them. It sounds like they are new owners of the camp. They sound pleasant enough on the phone. Just wondering if there's anything I need to know. Thanks All.

Also, does anyone know what happened to Canadian Haven camp? I guess it has been for sale for a couple years now and not open. That was always a nice camp."
4719586,Slushfish,2016-04-09 09:06:00,263,That is where we used to stay. In 2014 Brian leased/sold half of the camp to someone local and kept half the cabins. We stayed there that yr. and had a grt time. Last yr it wasn't open. This yr. we are trying Sunset Cove with high hopes. It's tough going from a camp you have gotten so used to and trying to find another that will be so accommodating. We'll see.
