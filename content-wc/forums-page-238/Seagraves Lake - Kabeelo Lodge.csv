Our group has a chance to go to this lake and give our other lake a skip. What is the fishing like at Seagraves? Kabeelo tells me there is trout, walleye and northern. It's a clear water lake. I'm interested in the trout but prefer the walleye. Being clear water, is it a harder lake to fish for the walleye and northern. Thanks for any help."

It's an incredibly well run operation, and we had great fishing. I'm not as experienced of a walleye fisherman as many on this site, but my impression is that clear water can be a bit tougher than stained. I do recall the people from Kabeelo telling me that the average size of walleye at Seagraves is larger than at some of the Kabeelo lakes. Have fun!"

We still caught plenty of walleyes, and I wouldn't say we were fishing real hard. Lot's of 18-21 inch range, and our largest was 25. Great numbers lake. Tea stained water. I can't recommend Kabeelo enough- they make darn sure your trip is everything you want it to be."
