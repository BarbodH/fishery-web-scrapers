6573978,RRK285,2021-06-28 11:41:00,44,"Where would you recommend taking two 10 year olds? Any lakes or outfitters that anyone could recommend. I have been to most of all the big lakes in NWO and while my kids can handle the fishing part, I am not sure long boat rides, many of miles away from camp, in rough water is ideal. Probably looking for a smaller body of water with plenty of numbers. Early June. Any suggestions to any of you have taken your kids up for their first trip ?"
6573992,Hwy101,2021-06-28 12:30:00,18,"This might get me lit up by the hardcore walleye guys. For my sons first two trips at 9 and 11 I took him to a camp that had crazy good smallmouth and pike fishing, with muskies being very common. He caught fish on pretty much any bait he pulled out of the box and saw most of the strikes which really got him fired up. It was kind of a practice run for the following walleye trips we took. Catching a 36"" pike on his very first cast in Canada set the tone. This was at Fireside Lodge near Sioux Lookout."
6573996,Knutson21,2021-06-28 12:45:00,348,"My Son is addicted to electronics' TV, Tablet, Gaming Systems, etc. 2019 he was 7 years old and per family tradition eligible to go to Canada with the Guys. I took him to a private cabin we have access to that is 18 miles from the boat launch were we park our vehicle. the cabin has no running water, no electricity, no communication with MOM (my wife). He handled it like a champ, we need to give our kids more credit than we do. They can handle a boat ride, being away from home and electronics. In fact I think we should provide these things to help them realize there is more to life. His first three walleyes of his life went 25"" 24"" 25.5"" all the first night. There were (4) guys and my son on the trip, we had 3 generations in the boat all week. It was awesome. I remember the days when I was the 7 year old in the boat with (3) generations. In summary, don't over think it, just take him with you. When ever he was tired and didn't want to fish anymore, he took a nap in the boat or ate a snack."
6574080,Baseline,2021-06-28 18:06:00,3207,"I would recommend Hanson's on Crow Lake in Nestor Falls. Crow is loaded with SMB, pike and has musky and lake trout. It is just across the street from LOW and the resorts have a private ramp and parking on Stevens Bay for walleye, SMB and even panfish. If you would like a trip that is more remote go to Barker's Bay on the Lower Manitou. It is a boat in resort, but well worth the effort to get in there. Tons of SMB and pike. the Manitou also has musky and lake trout. I used to take my kids and their friends to both lakes."
6574098,SweetD,2021-06-28 19:16:00,243,Nighthawk Lake would be a good choice if there is still am outpost cabin there. Used to be run by Viking Outpost out of Red Lake. My wife and I spent a week there probably 20 years ago. Great niumbers and boated a 40+ Pike and 28” eye!Good Luck
6574102,adempsey2.0,2021-06-28 19:43:00,611,"For a fly-in trip: Air Dale: decent cabins, nice lakes, children <16 $350, some lakes with nice beaches/cliffs, flights out of Wawahttps://www.air-dale.com/ White River Air: nice cabins, smaller lakes, children <16 1/2 price, flights out of White Riverhttps://whiteriverair.com/rates-fishing/ I have also been to several of the lodges flying out of Hornepayne (Kabinakagami, Nagagami, Obakamiga, Esnagi). All worth a look. Lakes aren't too big. Buck and Bingwood also offers some rustic outposts on smaller lakes that are likely Walleye factories (https://www.fishbucklake.com/index.php/cabins?id=48). I think those outfitters offer good fly-in options with a balance between price and driving distance."
6574132,NM_Trout,2021-06-28 22:00:00,1094,"Don't do it. You know what is going to happen? Those kids are going to get hooked on fishing. Once that happens, you are completely hosed. You're going to feel guilty if you buy yourself new waders when they are still using the walmart special ones. Same goes for rods, reels, raingear, and tackle.You're going to start buying 2x to 3x as much by way of lures, and you are going to keep an eye out for your kids' favorite lures. Pretty soon they will be your first go-to for fishing partners, and your old fishing buddies will be giving you the WTH look. God help you if you even THINK about about taking an outpost trip without them. You will immediately feel like a bad dad, and if they find out about the adults-only trip there is going to be months of **** to pay. And if you take them with, now you are paying for 2 or 3 folks each trip instead of just you. And then, all of a sudden, they grow up and move off (and take half your tackle with you) to a place which is well beyond a day's drive.Then you go out to try and fish all the water you fished with them, and the memories come flooding back. You get used to seeing them in the boat, or upstream or at the camp. That water will NEVER fish the same again.And they just are not there and you realize that you aren't as young as you used to be. So no. Don't do it. Get them a new Playstation and better internet bandwidth. You'll thank me later. Signed, Lonely dad in NM.P.S. I suggest Loon Haunt outfitters : Monroe lake. It's on a small island so the walk to the outhouse is as close to guaranteed to be free of bears. Cabin is perfect. Bill and Louise specialize in groups of 2. If you want more people around, and some internet access, try their Goose Lake. Fishing can be just as good, and the cabins have indoor toilets. Good luck!"
6574500,bigwalleye1,2021-06-30 07:17:00,2632,"We didn't have a lot of extra money when I was a kid. Fishing was local, or later, folks saved up enough to but a cabin/mobile home on a small lake in WI. I remember spending a lot of time with my Dad fishing in a small outboard powered boat, or fishing panfish in the spring with waders and a flyrod, some hand me downs from Pop. My only point, and the only add from me to the conversation is only this: Take him with you. Wherever you're going, regardless of the accommodations, regardless of the size of the water, regardless of the species. Looking back, some of my happiest times on the water were, and continue to be with my Dad. He's been to Canada with me, in my boat, numerous times, and I've been able to make the same kinds of memories in reverse. Me putting him on fish, me running the boat, me sharing my time with him. I've never heard a kid complain about the accommodations, the lack of internet, the lack of electronic games after a week in the bush. Never forget, kids, more than anything, want to spend time with parents that share their life experiences, their passions, and it's more important to share the time than to pick the ""perfect"" place. All places are perfect with Dad."
6574514,acplumber,2021-06-30 08:43:00,80,"We did a dads(2) and sons (4) trip a few years ago to this place with five mile lake lodge out of Chapleau. Its a boat in lake and only cabin on the lake. Fishing was good but did take a little bit to figure it out. the price was very reasonable. I'd go back. my boys still ask when we are going back. The ages were 5, 6, 6, and 10 and were never board except for the drive...."
6574604,Pink Unicorn,2021-06-30 13:41:00,83,"You hit the nail on the head with this... My first trip was when I was 10 with Dad, Uncle and 2 cousins. We went in late June and had a snow storm/rain for 2 days followed by 75 degrees. Was it ideal? No. Was it the best trip i've ever been on (despite slow fishing and bear problems) YES! Never forget- The memories of the first trip up with Dad will last a life time. Don't over think it! BTW- Chimo Lodge Roderick Lake was that first trip and I would recommend to anyone with kids/family. Sand beach out front, sauna, nice cabins with power and indoor toilets, great fishing close to camp with many options to explore."
6575414,Prairieboy43,2021-07-03 10:25:00,38,"Yup get them, hooked. Happened to me at age 5. We lived in Yukon Northwest territory Canada . Whitehorse Yukon (close to Alaska border). We had cabin a t beautiful lake nearby. There was large community dock. I would fish for hours, while my parents partied away with friends. I remember catching a 15lb jack fish (I weighed 60lbs at #5). And having to drag it to the cabin to show my family. Old man couldn’t believe it. Had big fry that night. I was hooked from then on. Yes enjoy the trip."

6575588,ILScott,2021-07-04 11:49:00,139,"Took my son the first time Wine Lake Camp when he was 12. It is a boat in camp. When we left the landing he left his electronics in the car and never regretted it. The camp doesn't have electricity but has nice cabins. We went with another dad and his two sons. We fished hard in the mornings and the boys always had gas in the boat and bait ready to go. We would come in for our main meal at 3 and then back out at 5 for the night bite. This is a smaller lake system with 5 different lakes to boat into. We would hike up to some of the portage lakes, stop at a big sand beach and swim and fish from shore and just explore. Go to the waterfall and get out and again explore and fish the area from shore a little. We let the boys choose where to go. When we would come in one of the older boys would fry the fish and the other two would get water for the cabin. It was easier with three boys than grown adults. Two boys would go swimming out in front of the camp and enjoy it. The boys had a blast and we had trips planned in 2020 and this year but we will be back next year. No matter where you go let the children in on the planning. They still talk about that trip and can't wait to get back and the owner likes the young children in camp. Two years ago my son would wake up early and go down to the dock to talk to the owner."
6574556,NM_Trout,2021-06-30 10:56:00,1094,"x2 for what Bigwalleye said!I've gone on dad/daughter trips with my kids, quite a bit and have done outpost trips when they were about 11 or 12. May I give a few tips for kid wrangling?These are just my observations for my kids. YMMV!1) Nobody casts a rod unless everybody near has eye protection on. We use barbless hooks, and even convert our multi-hook lures to a single hook. If it affects our catch success rate, I've never noticed.2) Bring way more snacks than you think you will need. Bring them in the boat too.3) Set the ground rules for sunscreen and bugspray early. One of my daughters hated bugspray but would get reactions to mosquitos. Sawyer Picaridin is a fantastic alternative to deet and is more kid friendly.4) Have your kids keep ""journals"" of the trip. Make an entry every day. They will enjoy looking back at this later, and it teaches them to keep notes on fishing successes.5) Bring extra games, including those they might not be familiar with. Travel chess / backgammon / yahtzee, whatever.6) Bring a GPS, and do a pre-search for geocaches in the area you are going.7) It's almost guaranteed to rain. Hard to cheer up a wet and cold kid. Get them the best raingear you can afford. Frogg Toggs makes an alternative to goretex which is pretty dang good.8) Consider head nets and bed nets to protect against mosquitos. My kids hated the thought of sleeping with mosquitos in the room, and this helped them a lot.9) Bring a decent small pair of binoculars or a monocular.10) Also bring a mask and snorkel, walkie talkies, extra batteries for flashlights (we use rechargeables that we charge off of the camp solar setup). My kids use spotify for music, and we use a tiny golf ball sized speaker that plugs into a phone. 11) Set up contests most fish, biggest fish, ugliest fish, whatever.12) Get them involved in the planning. Menus day activities, driving routes, places to stop. 13) Share the camp chores with them. Treat them as much like equals in the camp as you can.14) Beware sibling rivalry, especially late in the trip. Just be ready for it. Mine would get tired and grumpy (heck, this still happens and they are now 28 and 25)15) Don't wait to have a shore lunch. It might be sunny on that first day, followed by lots of rain. My kids love doing shore lunches. Heck.. I love doing shore lunches. Bring flint and steel and challenge them to start the shore lunch fire without matches. My kids are pyromaniacs and love making campfires.17) Bring a better first aid kit. Be prepared for sinus / allergy problems. Bug bites, diarrhea, constipation, sunscreen in eyes, along with the usual cuts/scrapes/splinters. I even brought (but did not disclose) female hygiene products ""just in case"". Bring industrial strength sunscreen.16) When you get home, after a week, sit down and visit with them to discuss what went well and what could have gone better for the ""next"" trip. Start planning :-)I'm jealous and I miss those days. Enjoy!"
