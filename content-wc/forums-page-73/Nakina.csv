The other thread that wants no replies is referencing the easing of the border restrictions that begin today July 5th. I'm hopefull by July 21st there will be more news that is good. Anyone going to be in Nakina on the 12th let me know and we can have a Canadian beverage together and talk fishing! I know it's a lot of wishful thinking but that's what we have to hang our hats on for now.......fingers crossed!!!
