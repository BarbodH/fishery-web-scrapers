However, there are a ton of waterfront cabins that you can rent, which usually offer small motorboat rentals, too. The only guide/charter that I used (twice) was 1,000 Islands Fishing Charters out of Clayton, NY. They offer drift trips for pike and bass. Basically, you drop a shiner over the side and drift. They also offer muskie charters. There are a ton of guides/charters up and down the river, so your choices are virtually endless."
