6574620,Eckohlt,2021-06-30 14:41:00,3685,Why did he swim alot farther? did he swim the widest part of the rainy? he should have known to swim a narrow spot
6574626,Wallychowder,2021-06-30 15:05:00,1567,He needed the exercise &#x1f923;
6574634,CI_Guy,2021-06-30 15:38:00,2118,I think Frank was swimming in water a little rougher than the Rainy River or Lake.
6574636,Wallychowder,2021-06-30 15:40:00,1567,My point exactly !
6574638,Eckohlt,2021-06-30 15:48:00,3685,"Even though the rainy is not that wide it would still be tough going,holding onto your poles,coolers,duffle bag,tackle box,flat of crawlers,but it could be done"
6574658,pjshorthorn,2021-06-30 16:05:00,5654,Let us know how that goes for you when you make it across the Rainy in September. You may need to make a Moose Mobile reservation now to get to your final destination. I here the Moose are getting booked up pretty quick.. PjShorthorn
6574662,Eckohlt,2021-06-30 16:09:00,3685,"I'll be driving in sept when I cross,we will leave the swimming to frank"
6574670,Wallychowder,2021-06-30 16:19:00,1567,Nobody's swimming anywhere ! The border will be wide open by mid May 2022 !
6574674,Eckohlt,2021-06-30 16:25:00,3685,"Starting mid aug 2021 it will be a wide open range for all that took the needle,so your right leave the swim suit at home"
6574680,Wallychowder,2021-06-30 16:40:00,1567,Do they make camo wet suits ?
6573758,NM_Trout,2021-06-27 14:32:00,1094,"So what happens if you are on US water and you stray into Canadian waters if you are fishing Lake of the Woods? (or vice versa...)Let's consider first the situation that we aren't under pandemic rules.How upset does Canada / US get if you stray across the border and fish, even if you have a valid Ontario and US fishing license? Is it a violation of their immigration laws?If you want to fish Canada water, do you have to launch in Canada? Do They have a floating immigration checkpoint? Anybody ever have contact with law enforcement to check immigration status or ?????"
6573764,prov1800,2021-06-27 14:38:00,5010,Very illegal.
6573768,Obabikon,2021-06-27 14:53:00,2370,"1. during regular times... it is not that big of a deal. They allow people to cross daily via boat, but they must stay in their boat. They changed a lot of the rules about he RBC (remote border crossing). It is pretty relaxed. 2. during a pandemic... it is a big deal."
6573770,Juls,2021-06-27 15:02:00,13414,"https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-v...pb-pp-eng.html Transit through Canadian watersYou currently cannot enter Canadian waters for optional reasons, such as: touring sightseeingpleasure fishing visits to cottages/vacation homes across the border You may still navigate through international or Canadian waters while in transit directly from one place outside Canada to another place outside Canada, if the transit is: direct continuous/uninterrupted by the most reasonable route Transiting through a canal or lock system that requires mooring or anchoring is not an uninterrupted route."
6573792,Slim03,2021-06-27 18:33:00,159,Only illegal if you get caught. Let me know how it works out for you.
6573862,MN_Moose,2021-06-28 05:58:00,964,"in normal conditions, being a few feet across an imaginary line and fishing isn't a big deal. Being two miles across a line and intentionally fishing could be cause for a ticket. Last year on Rainy Lake there is a portion of the navigable route that crosses into Canadian waters. Just as we were crossing into the Canadian waters portion we met a U.S. Border Patrol boat. They didn't blink an eye at us."
6574586,26IsoLead,2021-06-30 12:39:00,22,We just let hundreds of thousands of illegals cross our southern border in a heart beat!
6574590,Wallychowder,2021-06-30 12:44:00,1567,Yeah well ! Canada's a little bit more strict.......as if you couldn't tell ?
6574602,Eckohlt,2021-06-30 13:37:00,3685,You have to swim the rainy to get in
6574606,Wallychowder,2021-06-30 13:47:00,1567,"The ""Rainy"" really isn't that wide ! Frank Morris swam alot farther than that !"
