This year - first we had the usual ""fish fly"" hatch that hit shortly before the first of June - that lasted longer than usual - it went about 3 weeks. Then we had the ""small"" mayfly hatch (these are not the bigger, typical sized mayflies - they are only about half the size of a ""regular"" mayfly). Right now we are experiencing the ""regular"" sized mayfly hatch (the same size that you see in Canada). The water surface is just thick with their carcasses right now. Usually we can count on 3 hatches of the fish flies - Memorial Day - the Fourth of July - and Labor Day. They must like holidays.................."
6575094,Ltrain,2021-07-02 07:01:00,4145,"Yeah that's where i was 6-13 to the 27th. Love the lake, love the area. I stayed at Fishers which i really enjoyed and i love Da Boathouse's food and beverages. But the hatch,wow do I hate the hatch,lol. I will be back but it's either going to be at the end of May or perhaps August. That brings me to my question- how the August bite, if assume it picks up with no bugs anymore . I'm guessing it's going good on the flats, would that be correct?"
6575326,tv4fish,2021-07-03 05:30:00,2694,"Obviously - the flats ARE going to be the best areas to hit. And, you are correct - typically in August the mayflies are not around. That said - Mille Lacs is currently down over 8"" in depth (mainly due to NO rain) AND the hot weather has also taken its toll with ""lake evaporation"". You may know that Lake Mille Lacs relies mainly on ""surface rain"" as it has limited creek/river inflow. And, of course, all of that affects water temp. Right now - no one can even ""target"" walleyes while fishing. If you come up in August - who knows how fishing will be this year............"
6575334,Ltrain,2021-07-03 05:53:00,4145,"Not coming up this year again, just wondering how the typical August bite is. I know this year is a little off with the lake getting so warm so quick and being way low, it was more than a foot low when i was up there. I'm just thinking in a few years when I may come back, I will avoid the hatch, maybe August might be better."
6575386,troutwater,2021-07-03 08:49:00,299,"Thanks for the responses. Last week we were on Vermilion with a big hatch going on. We did find crawlers being much more productive than anything else. Only thing we found on main lake structure were huge schools of perch, so it was a struggle to find fish."
6573860,troutwater,2021-06-28 05:57:00,299,Just wondering how do you guys typically target walleyes when a big mayfly hatch is going on? I've heard that people either love it or hate it.
6573878,tv4fish,2021-06-28 06:34:00,2694,"Trout: I can just relay what our experience(s) has been over the past 35 years (primarily on Lac Seul) going after walleyes. IF you hit the start of the mayfly hatch - it seems like you could throw ""anything"" at the fish and they would go after it. However, if the hatch has been going on for 2-3 days, the fish seem to have ""had their fill"" of them and then it has always been harder to catch our walleyes, i.e. - the ""bite"" was always slower. You ""pays your money and you take your chances"" when it comes to ""timing"" the mayfly hatch....."
6573888,ILScott,2021-06-28 07:02:00,139,"I really like the mayfly hatch. Especially if the wind blows the same direction multiple days. My go to is a bottom bouncer with a bronze blade, slow death hook with a small piece of worm. I backtroll right through the hatch."

6574108,adempsey2.0,2021-06-28 19:54:00,611,"Would I choose to go on a trip during a hatch? NO. However, one of my annual trips tends to be during the hatch. Depending on where we go, we have hit it about 50% of the time. What I use: 1) Small spinner with a piece of crawler. Size 0 or 1 blade, single hook. 2) Slip bobber with a floating jig and small worm. Short and shallow. The bigger problem is being in the right place on the lake. The mayfly hatch is often on fire in SOME places on the lakes I have been to. Not every spot. So, if you don't find those spots you may be SOL for a few days. At least, that has been my experience."
6574128,NM_Trout,2021-06-28 21:35:00,1094,"Back in 2013-ish I took a trip above Red Lake with my brother, and we were in the middle of a mayfly hatch. I flyfish quite a bit, and I have to tell you, I have never seen anything like this at all. Millions and millions of huge mayflies in the sky. Darn near biblical in proportion. The fishing sucked. For Canada, that means we caught about 40 to 60 a day, but still.... it was slow, fish were a bit smaller, and it was not what we expected. That was also the year that we had a lot of wildfires and we had a wildfire burn right up to the short of the camp, with thick smoke in the air. One afternoon we watched water bombers scoop water off of the lake for 3 hours straight. I don't know if it was mayflies or water bombers (or all the smoke), but fishing was off for a few days."
6574162,eyeman_1,2021-06-29 05:24:00,690,"I've never had poor fishing during the mayfly hatch, but the key is fishing bouncers with spinners. Hammered copper, or bronze in size 3 with either a slow death hook and crawler or shorter snell and full crawler. Fish the mud to rock transition and it's game on."
6574378,Rock Hound,2021-06-29 15:03:00,51,"I would rather not fish during a hatch, but you cannot control that. One time I had an old timer tell me that when a Mayfly hatch is on, switch immediately to a pink / white jig and half a crawler. - Well, that has NEVER steered me wrong! I have also used rigs with crawlers, spinners and Slow Death and done well too. Regardless, crawlers are the key when the hatch is on, and it can actually be excellent at times. It isn't a reason not to go, but it does require a different approach usually. Crawlers are the key for me in a hatch!"
6574724,Ltrain,2021-06-30 20:09:00,4145,"I switch to crawlers too . Slow death and long leads with inlines instead of bouncers. Also use pink and red harness blades. That being said think I'm done taking a Minnesota/ northern Wisconsin vacation in June, just tired of dealing with the hatch."
6574964,Aspencreek,2021-07-01 15:56:00,2911,"On our trips to Lac Suel, if we happen upon a hatch in a particular area, we too will switch tactics to backtrolling with crawlers or slip bobbering with a crawler. Crawler is the key, at least for me. If we move to a 2nd or 3rd spot on the lake the hatch may be over or not yet started or isn't going to happen, it really depends on the water."
