6575336,Wallychowder,2021-07-03 05:55:00,1567,Would a ZIPline work ?
6575356,Eckohlt,2021-07-03 07:50:00,3685,"No,,,,,they could shoot you down in mid air"
6576020,rosh1,2021-07-06 06:54:00,275,Thanks for the pictures. Hope the water level doesn't get to low. Hope I can get my boat in soon.
6576022,prov1800,2021-07-06 07:09:00,5010,Seems some launching going on at launch near your cabin.Vermilion bay launch not to bad.have to back in farther.Hope you get to come up soon.Definatly time they open up.Just political now.
6576028,rosh1,2021-07-06 07:17:00,275,It's hard to wait. We are ready. Hope you didn't catch all the fish.
6576034,prov1800,2021-07-06 07:35:00,5010,No.plenty left.We only went as far as Portage Bay and only walleye fished a hour.Hot day cast a couple of hours and then found a couple of beaches to cool off.
6575242,prov1800,2021-07-02 16:23:00,5010,Wife and I decided to fish Eagle today.We launched at Vermilion Bay dock.Quite low there but no problem to launch.We muskie fished first and hit all the weed beds down toward Portage Bay through the back channel.What we found in each spot was no weeds only a few.Not sure what thats all about maybe the rusty crawfish have been busy.Managed to pull 3 pretty good fish to the boat but with the water getting up to 76f today they didn't have much spunk in them.Just a follow and swim off.Oh well next time.Walleyes basically in around 30+ plus ft on the humps but don't fish that deep but picked up some here and there in 25 ft.Tgey came up pretty good with no bad effects.Same for all other humps we fished. Went to the beach by Pine Beach camp and enjoyed some swimming.Water is great.Actually saw 3 boats today.lol.Shocking.We ran back to the from other side of Portage Bay.Very calm out to.33c today to warm to fish all day.Very smoky out also for last few days with all the fires in the west and north of us.
6575246,v-bay gord,2021-07-02 16:48:00,3168,"Saw you leaving the dock. My observation, only crazy people fish in this heat......but at least you went swimming! My other observation is only crazy people set off fireworks during a fire ban..."
6575250,prov1800,2021-07-02 16:58:00,5010,Yes and yes.Swimming was beautifull.got off lake pretty early.Yes got HOT.One more swim after loading boat and will go for one more swim just north of me tonight.Heard a few fireworks last night to.IDIOTS.
6575252,prov1800,2021-07-02 17:00:00,5010,Weed beds in rough shape.???
6575258,Bill Krejca,2021-07-02 17:05:00,6107,"Re: - Less weeds - Due to low water, maybe? Bill"
6575260,prov1800,2021-07-02 17:14:00,5010,pretty sure its the rusty crayfish started seeing beautifull weed beds get chopped down by crusties 5-6 years ago when i guided out of ALL.I havnt been fishing much out of Vermilion Bay last few years.Down at east end of Eagle I don't see that happening that much but they are there to as we catch them all the time.
6575264,Eckohlt,2021-07-02 17:21:00,3685,I hope to be swimming up there sept and oct.
6575266,prov1800,2021-07-02 17:33:00,5010,Hope I get to see that.
6575268,Wallychowder,2021-07-02 17:36:00,1567,The way it's going you might be swimming by 2023. Unless you swim across the Rainy !
6575270,prov1800,2021-07-02 17:38:00,5010,Short swim.Could be done.
