6573870,Windermere,2021-06-28 06:05:00,23,"I would like to share something that I don't think has been shared or considered. The emotional stress and risk that comes with dealing with everything that is going on with families and businesses ON both sides of this COVID mess, this may be worth pointing out. I have been in some type of business for the past 45 yrs.; I have seen a lot of businesses open and close in my lifetime. I personally cannot recall one or any businesses that faced hardships that wanted or intended to screw over their customers. I'm not saying there are not those types of people, but in most small towns this is not the general case. I also feel that most outfitters are just like your small rural town business owners and they are not takers, but just hit some hard times that might have been unpredictable to plan for, like an almost two year shut down. I know maybe I shouldn't share this but if it helps someone understand that they are not the only one, then it is worth the risk of sharing my situation! This spring with the border closing yet again, I personally felt the pressure and depression setting in and closing in around me. I love what I do and live for this life. I realize this is my and only my choice and do not expect ANYONE to support me for what I love and want to do. But the reality of being put in a financial situation that was no fault of either my guests or my family was hard to deal with. Trying to figure out the best way to meet everyone's needs was what I was striving for; guests, family, and business responsibly, stressful! But hearing my wife's point of view, these camps are us together, and we will work together though this was helpful! This has been hard sharing about my own weakness during these uncertain times. But this continual beating of the drum, of what some are doing, and some are not doing, has a valid point but at what costs? During these difficult times, the list may have been thought of being helpful but it may be destructive as we may not have all the true facts, and how this could destroy not only their business but their lives. I truly believe most outfitters are doing the best they can. I believe no one really wants to take from their guests and nobody wants their camp's name to be torn down by a post or read from a list that they are wrong for trying to keep the camp OPEN! Everyone's situation is different and as a reminder, we may not know the real facts and the hardships they are facing. Remember, we may never know the true emotional stress that all/any outfitter is going through during these times. Two years is a long time with little revenue and the emotional cost may be greater than what some of us really realize. There have been a lot of losses during this COVID mess; family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers, jobs, friendships and yes, borders closed. COVID has touched so many lives and it is NOT done with its effects on all of us yet! Instead, try to UNDERSTAND the stress that COVID has caused for some could be greater than some may know. Reach out with understanding. I have read that some outfitters are not talking or returning guest's calls, but maybe they are under so much stress with their backs against the wall. They may feel they have nowhere to turn or don't know what to say because the fear of disappointing their guests due the financial situation they have been put into. With understanding, this was no fault of theirs...being forced to shut down...with little to no revenue...but lots of talk and promises doesn't always help. Remember not everybody can receive all the benefits listed previously for financial help, I know we didn't. Just because it is on a list to be looked up and seen by all doesn't mean you automaticity qualify! Kindness, sharing, and understanding will help. I hope by providing a different perspective that I might bring more understanding to this difficult situation being discussed on posts. I by no means am trying to give cover for those that want to only take and not work with guests. But for some, maybe the stress that they are going though is hurting in ways some of us cannot see. I really wish that we could all just talk about fishing together, but I also see the effects that COVID has bought all of us, both fisherman and outfitters. Please remember the pressures behind those closed doors may just be greater than most can see or understand for ALL of us. HOPE and FAITH - is my wish for everyone!"
6573880,kswalleyer,2021-06-28 06:48:00,1651,"so hard to respond without getting the thread blown up....I don't doubt any of this for a second. I feel for anyone who has been impacted as it is nobodys fault, here . While I havent watched all these threads a whole lot, I think a lot of people(me for sure) are on the resort owners side as business owners first, their own fishing wants second and understand riding it out with them...That being said,Im not there but I dont see a high survival rate if these lodges dont start filling up very soon.,,its hard enough that you dont get 2 years of lost revenue, business disruption back easily at all. Ill leave it there before I get myself in trouble, Im on your side, trust me. particularly when it comes to the business side"
6573886,v-bay gord,2021-06-28 07:01:00,3168,"Your thoughts on the matter are right on. One of the ""stresses"" is that many want to assign blame to the current situation. Covid is the cause, plain and simple. Nobody is out to target our industry. Many might have differing opinions on how it should have been handled, or even whether there is a problem. Politics has muddied the water. Blame is everywhere which only adds to the stress. Stick to your own moral code to see you through to the end. You have nothing to prove to those that just want to blame others."
6573894,Obabikon,2021-06-28 07:23:00,2370,"I feel this in my soul. Very well put. Along the lines of returning phone calls/emails.... I get an average of 5-10 calls/emails per day from guests. Always asking if I have heard anything new about the border. I went to Church yesterday, and I had to explain no less than 10 times our situation. My 5 year old son went to a birthday yesterday afternoon... another 3-4 conversations about it. This is all day, every day... for months and months. We are mentally exhausted, incredibly discouraged, and it has completely engulfed our lives. I love hearing from our guests (some of my dearest friends), my church family has known me since I was born, friends are only asking because they care..... I'm not upset about people showing they care. I am just saying that this situation makes some of us want to hide in a dark room with the phone on silent. I will say that one of the best parts of this job, is friendships. I respect the resort hoppers too... people that go experience different places and fish different lakes each year. I am glad that happens. However, you are missing the deep friendships that can be experienced by a decade of staying with one place. Many of my guests remember when Erin and I didn't have children. Now our oldest is 13.... they've watched her grow up. I've taught 8 year olds how to musky fish... and now I'm getting wedding invitations from them. When you forge that kind of relationship with people, the issue with deposits is moot. Neither side would risk ruining a special friendship by arguing or demanding things."
6573912,Pooch,2021-06-28 08:08:00,4618,"Camp owners please realize that there are many, many of us who support and care for all of your well being.Hang in there folks.Pooch"
6573924,Wawajake,2021-06-28 08:19:00,413,"Absolutely !! So true....and just from being here on this site, I hope some day , before I kick the bucket, to fish at a North West Ont fishing Lodge ."
6574092,Barley,2021-06-28 18:58:00,10,"Thanks to you, and especially Windemere. Fishing in Canada is a family tradition for many of your clients as you are well aware. Also for a lot of us, having that trip to look forward to has become to mean much more in the past year and a half. I lost both of my parents, one day apart, last year to the Virus. Then, a few months later, my brother succumbed to his addiction and depression over that loss. To say that I need the annual trip to the North might sound childish to some but the truth is my heart aches for the beauty, serenity and excitement of the experience. This pandemic has served to clarify the great service that you and businesspeople like you provide to your clients. Our usual lodge owners, who literally built their resort with their own hands, where unable survive the loss of a season and had to sell out last year. My wife and I had become friends with this amazing family over the past eight years or so and we continue to morn their loss with them. Both of your posts have helped to place my hardships in a better perspective, especially regarding to unending inquiries you are receiving from clients asking for more information. The Canadian Government, and to some lesser extent, the US, have done a great disservice to businesses that depend on legal travel across the border. They need to be much more forthcoming about exactly what the conditions need to be for tourist to cross the border. I have already lost a $900 deposit for 2020 and another, larger deposit for August of this year is covered by insurance. This is a minor monetary setback that I'm happy for our friends to use to survive these uncertain times. I'm wishing you and all the lodge operators the best of luck and will be spending my tourist dollars with some of you as soon as I can."
6574274,26IsoLead,2021-06-29 10:05:00,22,"For me I think outfitters should give credit for prior payments since no service delivered that is a fault of the client.Payments for trips and deposits should be carried over to future trips if the reason is we can't go because the border closed due to Covid(?)It may be no fault of the outfitter but it sure as heck is not the clients fault.If the outfitters Association want to setup a gofundme account and let people donate, fine at least we would know ahead of time we are not getting any service for the money we send, seems reasonable to me at least.People aren't sending deposits hoping they get nothing for their money. If an outfitter rebooked the slot a US client had with someone else already in Canada, that should be a refund or at least a carry over.Pike"
6574356,Juls,2021-06-29 13:37:00,13414,Thanks for clarifying it.
6575048,wallypod,2021-07-01 19:57:00,21,Windermere - great message. Not just for us who have the privilege of visiting some hallowed ground of fishing but what it means to be human while under duress.
6575170,Billswest,2021-07-02 10:54:00,32,"with the outfitters and the position they have been put in through no fault of their own. On the flip side I also feel for the people who have booked trips, only to see their reservations be cancelled again for another year or two. The difficulty and hardships go both ways. Everyone is hurting somehow, some more than others. I retired after 37 years in law enforcement in Idaho. I grew up in western New York As a kid and young man I spent almost all of my free time fishing throughout Ontario and Quebec. I have only fond memories of all my excursions and the people I met along the way. And the fishing itself, wow, always something to speak highly of and produce great memories. Now, in my late 60's, I ave a passle of grand kids and friends to fish with. One of the first things I did after ending work in 9/2019 was book a trip with a reputable outfitter in NW Ontario and made a substantial down payment to reserve our slot. Our trip was to come off in mid-June,2020. Well, as most of you know, it didn't. Again this year, 2021, we were shut out and recently were notified that we were rescheduled to 2022. Like I mentioned, I sympathize with the outfitters and how this COVID mess has affected them...their business and their family. I also have had to see the disappointed faces of my grandkids who have heard all G-Pa's stories, only to again see their dreams put on hold. It's one of those lessons life serves ya, like it or not. On the personal side I have MS. When I booked the trip I was mobil and could have easily dealt with the rigors of traveling to, fishing, and living at a remote outpost camp for a week. As luck may have it this **** disease has advanced to the point that I now need a walker to get around and, w/o divine intervention, will likely be in a wheel chair by June,2022. I have every intention of being their to fish with the family next year, God willing. I have not asked for a refund due to the change in my condition since the reservation was first made in 2019, and I have no intention of doing so. The hardships endured go both ways.We will wait another year and my outfitter will now have to accommodate me and my disability. I believe it will all work out in the end. So to all of us,..... outfitters, friends and families.... stay safe and, as much as you can, be at peace with the reality of the situation. Hopefully we will all get through this and can move on with our lives as they once were, or as close to that as possible. Peace to all....."
6575182,bigwalleye1,2021-07-02 11:47:00,2632,"Sorry to hear of your condition, but perhaps something for a priority reset button for a lot of us. Let me be the first to wish you a safe, happy, and enjoyable trip to Canada, any many happy memories for all!!"
6575188,ohiojmj,2021-07-02 12:13:00,1262,I couldn't have said any better. Prayers for the camp owners and the many touched by terrible virus. Sent from my SM-G950U using Tapatalk
6573954,Stauff,2021-06-28 09:53:00,110,"Windermere, I appreciate your putting into words the true cost of ownership from the lodge perspective. I find myself searching daily for information that just might offer a glimmer of hope that our group can gather yet this season on Canadian waters. Yes, the reason for the trip is the unparalleled fishing, but the underlying importance for me is the time spent with people that mean a lot to me. We come from both coasts, the Deep South and the Midwest to gather in Thunder Bay and head north to fly in as a family. That's my selfish reason for wishing the border open that pales in comparison with what you lodge owners are currently enduring. I need to sit back, be thankful for being able to ride out this pandemic with minimal effect, and say a prayer that you guys are able to find peace and great success in the future. I look forward to the time we can get up there to help! Stauffer"
6573970,combine_billy,2021-06-28 11:24:00,151,I rolled my mid july 2021 reservation over to 2022 this morning. I sent an email and received the response and the new confirmation from the lodge within 5 minutes. I have gone there every year but one since 1999. Relationships matter.
6573974,26IsoLead,2021-06-28 11:30:00,22,"I take all your points with a sad heart for all the outfitters who were kind enough without being called out on this board last year to roll forward deposits from 2020 to 2021 and now probably 2021 to 2022, even though we know they could have just kept the $ due to clauses in a contract. Covid is not anything we all bargained for anyway. For me I think outfitters should give credit for prior payments since no service delivered that is a fault of the client. I have no problem with outfitters raising prices for 2022 or even longer for future trips to recover."
6574032,Juls,2021-06-28 14:23:00,13414,"Could you please rewrite this line again...another way...just to clarify it a little bit more? It's confusing to me. I can read it two different ways....Sorry, and Thanks!Windemere, thanks for sharing your thoughts with us here. Much appreciated. My fingers are crossed for all of you outfitters up there. I can't wait to get back, but I'll be waiting until 2022 now. My Dad's fighting the big ""C"", and I will be using my slotted Ontario days to go visit with him, and mom, in Wisconsin instead of heading up there (if the border were to open, that is), so......I'll have to try again in August of 2022. I miss Meta and Ara lakes, Meta Lake Lodge, John, Cheryl, and the crew. At least I get to fish a lot here, so that helps keep me sane...Best wishes to all of you!"
