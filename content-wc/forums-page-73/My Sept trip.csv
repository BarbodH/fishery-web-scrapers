6575906,7 Mag,2021-07-05 15:15:00,1887,"If you tag out early and you're interested in shooting prairie dogs take a rifle with you. Head over to antelope area 47 southwest of Casper, lots of public land."
6575930,ia bhtr,2021-07-05 16:21:00,212,"I will keep that in mind , been lots of years since I did any prairie dog shooting , Thanks for the tip !"
6575688,ia bhtr,2021-07-04 20:13:00,212,"has had a slight change , it would appear that a Wyoming Elk Tag will have to do as far as a replacement for my Sept LOTW trip >>====> Dang the luck"
6575690,7 Mag,2021-07-04 20:16:00,1887,"That's cool, elk hunting in September is awesome! Best of luck!"
6575692,Hookhunter75,2021-07-04 20:27:00,60,Nice! Are you doing general? Or did you draw a special draw unit?!
6575700,ia bhtr,2021-07-04 21:01:00,212,"drew unit 7 , spent my 14 preference points to get it , got on a pretty large private ranch , hopefully that ups my chances"
6575702,johnboat,2021-07-04 21:09:00,2014,I'd make that trade any day! Good Luck.

6575728,Hookhunter75,2021-07-05 05:46:00,60,Thatâ€™s awesome. I am doing a general unit there next year.
6575732,7 Mag,2021-07-05 06:04:00,1887,"That's a great tag! Several years ago I hunted the Shirley basin, antelope tag and I seen the two biggest bulls I've ever seen. That's a great area best of luck!"
6575756,ia bhtr,2021-07-05 07:40:00,212,"Yep , took some time choosing 7 , it gave me everything I wanted for a zone , down side is mostly private , so that added to the cost , got the Hoyt dialed in with heavy arrows , shooting broadheads great , now keep getting the operator in a little better shape is the next goal with any luck , get back from that and "" MAYBE "" I can get into Canada for a fishing trip"
6575772,elkman99,2021-07-05 08:39:00,180,"That is awesome! Never hunted in WY, but always went to the Selway Bitteroot area in Idaho. I'm jealous! Too fat and out of shape to do those backpack hunts again. lol. Nothing compares to hearing those big boys bugling. Good Luck!"
