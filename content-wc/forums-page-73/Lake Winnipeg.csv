6569580,biggamefisher,2021-06-13 19:23:00,540,"Lake Winnipeg has really taken off in the last few years, especially in the summer months. I suggest making the trip to Hecla Island, you can camp, stay in the Gull Harbor Resort or their Marina or stay at the Lakeview Hotel........all stellar accommodations, great restaurants. The fishing up there is stellar as well."
6575928,lirwin4,2021-07-05 16:07:00,7,"I live right on Lake Winnipeg and Walleye fishing has been real good ever since the soft water season opened on May 15th. 100 fish days with multiple fish over 28"" are not uncommon. Hopefully the border gets opened soon!"
6577234,lirwin4,2021-07-09 21:35:00,7,"A quick update, the mayfly hatch has been quite strong in the last week so the bite has slowed down both in numbers and size. There are still Walleye to be caught but they are harder to find and more finicky. The bite will pick up again by mid August or hopefully sooner."
6568782,nova0106,2021-06-11 07:27:00,57,Anyone here fish open water Lake Winnipeg? I am planning a trip next year and am curious if any of you well seasoned veterans could lend a tip or two I have a 25' aluminum North River Seahawk OS and I plan to sleep in at a Marina .

6569432,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 11:38:00,3685,If your looking for Ferris bueller I'm not sure he is on this site
6569440,Wallychowder,2021-06-13 12:25:00,1567,I think Lake Winnipeg is known for ice fishing for the big humpbacks !!! Big cats more in open water !
6569442,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 12:32:00,3685,"I thought it was greenbacks,no humpback whales in that lake"
6569446,Wallychowder,2021-06-13 12:53:00,1567,"Yeah i know, but some of those suckers are as big as a Humpback !!!"
6569450,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 12:59:00,3685,Gotcha!
6569452,Wallychowder,2021-06-13 13:11:00,1567,Greenback's are currency !!!
6569458,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 13:25:00,3685,"Well then I got plenty of greenbacks for Ontario,but there going to be antiques if they open up soon"
6569464,ackvil,2021-06-13 13:43:00,177,"A lot depends on what time of the year you will be there. In the warmer months trolling plugs worked nicely for walleyes for us last year. We looked for deeper water and that worked.We also found the night fishing worked for crappies and walleyes. Perch fishing was good almost everywhere. We used small plastics (Mr. Twister, etc) on 1/8 jigs."
