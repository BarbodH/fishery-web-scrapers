6572924,kettyspanky,2021-06-25 04:47:00,271,Just started looking into this. Is this a for sure thing? Can I do more than one person on it? Alot of the older people don't have smart phones and are not able to do it including my fishing partner. Hopefully it is easy and painless to do. I'm trying to get prepared for what is to come if the gate does open this year. Thanks in advance and any help is appreciated.

6572956,BuckeyeATC,2021-06-25 06:20:00,88,I've been watching quite a bit of Canadian news lately and I would say that the ArriveCan app will most definitely be used. The one minister states earlier this week that they are working on a way to upload vax certification to the app. Here is the website that kind of walks you thru it. https://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...arrivecan.html
6572970,Guest,2021-06-25 07:19:00,0,"Sounds easy peasy. LOL How to use ArriveCAN Use ArriveCAN to submit your information easily and securely before your arrival in Canada. ArriveCAN is available to download as a mobile app or you can create an account and sign in online. Whether you're entering Canada by air, land or marine, use ArriveCAN to: provide required contact information for you and other people travelling with you, as long as you're staying at the same quarantine location the purpose of your travel (such as exempt travel, work, study, family reunification or compassionate reasons)travel details, such as your: date of arrival port of entry if you're entering by land or marine vessel or flight number, airport and airline if you're entering by air provide the trip reference code for your 3-night reservation at a government-authorized hotel (for air travellers only, unless exempt) answer questions about your pre-entry COVID-19 test and acknowledge that you understand the requirements for: testing when flying to Canada testing when driving to Canada provide information about the countries you stayed in or visited in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Canada (don't include countries where youhad a connection stop along the journey from one destination to another). answer questions about your quarantine plan if your travel isn't exempt from quarantine requirements For your quarantine plan, questions include: whether you have accommodation where you can quarantine for 14 days or possibly longer the address of your final quarantine location (the place where you'll finish your 14-day quarantine) whether you can avoid all contact with other people who didn't travel with you while in your place of quarantine whether you'll have access to basic necessities of life, including water, food, medication and heat, without leaving quarantine if there are people at increased risk from COVID-19 at that place who: are 65 years or older have underlying medical conditions have compromised immune systems if there are any people at that place who work or assist in a facility, home or workplace that includes people at increased risk from COVID-19 whether it's a group living environment or houses multiple families, such as: group residence care facilities living with roommates you can't avoid who didn't travel with you Once you've submitted your information, you'll get an ArriveCAN confirmation receipt. It will be sent to you by email, or you can take a screenshot or print it if you sign in online. You'll need to show your confirmation receipt to the Canada border services officers. The ArriveCAN mobile app saves your contact information (name, date of birth and travel document information) for travel at a later date. You can only have 1 active submission in ArriveCAN at any given time."

6573002,stumcfar,2021-06-25 08:38:00,451,"I didn't see a lot of masks or social distancing in Montreal last night during the hockey game. Evidently Covid is no longer a thing in Montreal, but it is in rural Ontario by all the fishing camps?"
6573180,krazyk711,2021-06-25 14:55:00,26,Clicked on the link and guess what it has nothing to with Americans ?!? Let's put a fork in it !! the border will be closed this year and by the grace of GOD it will open next season !!! I'm not religious but I'm saying my prayers as I'll quit fishing if I have to stay south of the holy land for another year !!!
6573186,Wallychowder,2021-06-25 15:04:00,1567,Let us know when the sale is ?
6573202,Slim03,2021-06-25 16:37:00,159,I’m not waisting my time on anything until the day they are going to actually open the border because at this point I’ll believe it when I see it actually open.
6574306,26IsoLead,2021-06-29 11:53:00,22,land entry would only let me choose a date up to 2-3 days ahead ???
