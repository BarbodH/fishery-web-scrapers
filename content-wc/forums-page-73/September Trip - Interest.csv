6572756,SweetD,2021-06-24 16:29:00,243,"Hey WalleyeCentral Gang, have a trip scheduled for 9/11-9/19 to Hooker Lake with Slate Falls Outposts. Our trip was canceled in July for obvious reasons. My original group of 8 has dwindled to 3. We still plan to go if we can. If any of you have interest in joining 3 super cool dudes from Iowa reach out to me to discuss. Would be open to adding 1-5 (total group size of 4-8). We are mid 50’s and have been on many trips North…..I have actually been on approximately 30 trips North of the border. At any rate we are pretty low key. Fishing, card playing, cocktails, sleeping, eating and being merry…….pretty much what a trip to the bush is all about. Contact me if interested. Can fill you in on details. email: [email protected]cell: 515-577-2566Dave"

Plus I know Slate Falls is a class act... Good luck with recruitment. Congratulations by the way on post #1..."

I was in the hooker cabin when some new boats were taken in (the winter of 2017), it was a newer build at that time, nice cabin, enjoy your stay."
6573060,SweetD,2021-06-25 10:15:00,243,Tell me more about Hooker please. We will definitely keep it down for you Moose dudes. This is our first time to Hooker so if you have any hi-fi super duper walleye holes would certainly appreciate GPS coordinates or a marked up map??? If unwilling to assist expect some serious ruckus and cowbell playing super cool Iowa dudes getting after it!!!! Man I hope we can make it North this year.Still open to a few guys joining us???

6573084,bthomas3333,2021-06-25 10:54:00,465,"Hi Dave, I think we have chatted before. I am booked into Cree the same week. I think? Probably should double check that...after the boarder closed again announcement sort of pushed to back burner. If I am not the same week I could def find a couple of guys for a Sept trip. I'll ping ya'. Thanks, Brett"
6573090,SweetD,2021-06-25 11:17:00,243,Yes we have Brett. Reach out if you have interest and we can talk details. Hope you can make your trips as well. Been a crazy two years now.
