6574812,prov1800,2021-07-01 07:53:00,5010,Was fun to have kids in the boat for sure.The 4 yr old hung in most of the day.Hot day at 30c he napped a couple of times but his brother fished 6 solid hrs.Bass were still shallow so about every cast one was caught on a popper or tiny torpedo.Walleyes were tougher with another mayflies hatch but we all managed to still get around 50 or so.While bass fishing we saw huge numbers of walleyes in 3-4 ft in the weed growth and those woukd not bite on anything even on an a hook on a slip bobber but the boys were fascinated being able to see them.
