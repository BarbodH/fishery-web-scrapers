6575726,Eckohlt,2021-07-05 05:25:00,3685,You have a good shot at it
6571558,prov1800,2021-06-21 05:12:00,5010,Wish I could say that.
6571600,JAY221,2021-06-21 07:28:00,877,"I wish I couldn't say that!!! Later, Jay"
6572760,onetimedave,2021-06-24 16:29:00,502,Talked to someone in the dept. that sent the check. She said it was a tax and she had no idea if it was Canadian $$$ or US$$$$. Still trying to figure out hoe to cash it and have some $$$ left. nadian $$$ cashing it with a US bank will leave your with nothing or very little.
6572776,Bill Krejca,2021-06-24 17:01:00,6107,"As I remember some years ago, a bank cashed one of those checks here in the U.S., the clerk thinking it was in U.S. dollars. Finding out the mistake, the bank got hold of the happy cash holder and deducted the amount to equalize for the exchange rate( plus added a charge for cashing). The unhappy cash holder ended up with a pittance. Bill"
6573080,David Anderson,2021-06-25 10:49:00,2073,"Thanks for the information. I bought a new Outdoor Card in 2019 along with a 3 year Non resident License, at the time the exchange rate was very favorable. These all expire 12/31/2021. Wrote the email explaining when I bought, How my outfitter had worked with us on our already paid deposit, I was not asking for a refund, simply an extension for the next 3 years and I would pay in full for my 2019 costs. Stated they cannot do that, but would mail me a check for 2020 and 2021. If I go up this fall, I can just get a license for the time I fish. The gentleman called me and was very accommodating and I thanked him for the consideration. I assured him that I would have rather been using it, He said and I agree that there was little he could do. Thanks again!!"
6573082,David Anderson,2021-06-25 10:52:00,2073,"Interesting, when I bought my license the exchange rate was 1.35. Today it's 1.23...good news is I made money!!"
6575578,NM_Trout,2021-07-04 10:51:00,1094,LoL. Talk about finding the silver lining :-) Thanks. I needed that laugh.
6575586,Wallychowder,2021-07-04 11:46:00,1567,LOL. and he probably wont lose any in the next 23 months either !
6575594,Eckohlt,2021-07-04 12:37:00,3685,"He must not be going this fall,unlike me"
6575682,JAY221,2021-07-04 19:51:00,877,"I will not be going in the fall but would love to go before summer is over! later, Jay"
6571058,Pooch,2021-06-18 19:51:00,4618,"of cancelled trips to Ontario have saved me: 8,000 miles on my truck$1,400 of road fuel8,000 miles on my boat trailer30 days of no hours put on my boat motorNo busted up props or lower units$1000 in boat fuel$7,000 in camp charges$600 in bait$600 in hotel and other travel expenses$400 saved by not stopping at Scheels in Eau Claire each trip for stuff I do not needSo, you see there is an upside of not going to Canada.The downside is that my wife has my full attention all summer for ""honey do's"" and I have no excuse to say ""too busy"".Pooch"
6571074,Eckohlt,2021-06-18 20:07:00,3685,You forgot to mention you also saved some fish from going under the knife
6571088,Pooch,2021-06-18 20:36:00,4618,I don't keep but a few small fish each trip for eaters. None go home with me. Haven't for many years. Good point though! Add up all the fish that have not gone under the knife in the past two seasons? Wow... Some serious numbers emerge. Pooch
6571098,Bill Krejca,2021-06-18 21:08:00,6107,"Good luck getting the check cashed. I have one from a few years ago, the at-the-time-refund on the tax. Unless one is in the province during a week day when a bank is open, it is hard to cash. U.S. banks charge enough, last time I looked into it, that that option is not viable. Bill"
6571102,David Anderson,2021-06-18 22:22:00,2073,"How did you initiate the refund, did you call them?? thanks"
6571262,Baseline,2021-06-19 17:27:00,3207,Sent the Ontario MNR an email and asked for refund on my license I purchased in Jan 2020. I also asked for extension of my Outdoor Card. I included a pic of my license and listed my number and confirmation number for my CC. I also asked for a year extension of my Outdoor Card. They responded that they would refund my 2020 license purchase price. A refund showed up on my CC. A couple of months later a new Outdoor Card showed up in the mail. There were some instructions listed on the Ontario MNR website stating license fees purchased before March or April 2020 (can't remember the specifics) would be refunded if requested.
6571338,onetimedave,2021-06-20 06:11:00,502,It is not on the check anywhere whether it is in US or Canadian $$$$$$. Took check to band and was advised if it is Canadian $$$$ with the exchange rate and bank fees to process check I would be in the hole. Will try to find out what country the $$$ are from.
6571348,Eckohlt,2021-06-20 06:44:00,3685,Might be less of a headache to just throw it in the fireplace and start a fire with it.
6571352,Wallychowder,2021-06-20 06:46:00,1567,I would say if the check is from Ontario it is Canadian funds ?
6571400,BnD,2021-06-20 09:28:00,13,"Great perspective. We have taken several extra Carribean trips to spread the wealth south. Strange how the rest of the world has opened up with qualifiers but not Canada. Guess they don't want our money? Who knew? I can verify that Mexico, Dominican Republic and Jamaica love American$"
6570968,onetimedave,2021-06-18 15:04:00,502,Today I received an envelope in mail from Ontario Shared Services. Could not to wait to open and see what was inside. Upon opening found a check for $34.49 a refund of fishing license for year 2019. It took so long I forgot about it. Assuming $34.49 was Canadian funds. From time it was mailed in Canada (May19) till it got to me in me Ohio it took 30 days. Just wanted you to know.
6570980,prov1800,2021-06-18 15:18:00,5010,Sweet deal
6570982,Eckohlt,2021-06-18 15:25:00,3685,"At least someone got some help from the can- gov,in a good way"
6570986,JAY221,2021-06-18 15:30:00,877,"I haven't lost a single lure in Canadian water in over 23 months!! New record for me. Later, Jay"
6570988,Eckohlt,2021-06-18 15:33:00,3685,"Cash it right away,if Justin T finds out you have that check he might ask for it back"
6570990,Eckohlt,2021-06-18 15:34:00,3685,That's the worst record in the world to have
6570994,Baseline,2021-06-18 15:49:00,3207,One Time Dave is not the only one. They MNR refunded the cost of my 2020 Canadian License and sent me a new Outdoor card good till 2023.
6570998,Eckohlt,2021-06-18 16:12:00,3685,"The sooner we get back up there the sooner the MNR can start making money,,,,what in the hel they waiting for,unlock the gate"
6571024,RichA$1970,2021-06-18 17:35:00,1159,I wish they would extend the outdoor card for an extra year
6571034,Eckohlt,2021-06-18 18:00:00,3685,"There plan rich is to extend one thing and one thing only,it's called put people in the poor house extension"
