LOL"
6575876,Eckohlt,2021-07-05 13:07:00,3685,"Won't be long you'll be going over the bridge,you can catch your own fish."
6575880,prov1800,2021-07-05 13:12:00,5010,Sounds like fun.
6575884,Wallychowder,2021-07-05 13:27:00,1567,Might as well ! Nobody's using it !

Add a few first-cut ears of corn and now you've got a feast. My cardiologist, if I had one, might object to the salt intake, but it'd be worth it. I think I'll wash it down with a Molson!"
6576362,lassh,2021-07-07 07:03:00,553,"Yeah. and throw in some ""junk potatoes"" and fixed up baked beans and you have the ultimate northwoods feast."
6576932,lotsoffish1,2021-07-09 05:49:00,49,Oh yeah we call them Doctored beans but I know what you mean! you cant beat them

6575730,Skywagon,2021-07-05 05:54:00,1106,"That is just cruel! and nobody to bring me any across the border. Our sweet corn will not be ready until the end of August/first of September. Just to reciprocate.... here is a picture of a 27"" that a friend caught when we were at the cabin last week."
6575752,Eckohlt,2021-07-05 07:35:00,3685,"Very nice,sweet corn n walleye dinner doesn't get any better than that."
6575758,Pooch,2021-07-05 07:47:00,4618,Guess we're even. That's a nice fishy. Right now I'd trade a burlap bag of sweet corn for one of those in a heartbeat!Good looking garden. I'm always amazed at the progression of the maturity zones. When our Peonies are done blooming yours start a month later. Same with the Lilac bushes. What maturity sweet corn do you plant up there? The picture of our garden is about a eighty five to ninety day corn.Deer fence eh.Pooch
6575768,Skywagon,2021-07-05 08:05:00,1106,"I would have to ask my gardener about maturity to be sure, but I think she has used an 80 day Super Sweet type in the past. The wolves have about wiped out my local deer population, so about all the fence is good for now is to keep the dog out of the garden, he loves carrots."
6575804,Pooch,2021-07-05 10:19:00,4618,"Carrots? When we had Basset hounds years ago, it was always a race between them and Peg for the green beans. They loved green beans for some reason. Kind of like racoons and our sweet corn patch. Pooch"
