There wasn't a lot out there and we spent the better part of the week following friends and generally lost. I've created a map of the various lakes in the area from landmarks that I found on this site and the web so that we can download them to our GPS, perhaps someone else will find it useful. I know this isn't complete and there may be some mistakes. If anyone has any landmarks they would like to contribute or corrections please send me a pm or post here.Link to Map If you would like to download to your GPS device, you can convert the map using GPS Visualizer. Regards,"
