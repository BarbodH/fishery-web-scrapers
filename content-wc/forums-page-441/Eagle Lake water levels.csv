1428002,Sutsgold,2012-04-29 07:43:00,219,Does anyone have an idea of the water level on Eagle? I was up there last Oct and it was down a couple of feet? Has it risen or dropped this spring? Will be there in a month. Counting the days!
1428012,fishinnut 3446,2012-04-29 08:01:00,638,I was there in July and Sept.and did'nt notice/or hit anything(thank you lord) Vgord should let us know.
1428016,NARDA 1,2012-04-29 08:07:00,636,I believe that the levels are down somewhat because they didn't have a lot of snow this winter. I'm sure V-Bay Gord will chime in and give a more accurate answer.
1428060,115 optimax,2012-04-29 09:32:00,650,All of the lakes around here are down right now and we havn't had any rain yet.I've Been fishing Wabigoon for 18 years now and i'm very worried about finding new rock piles with my new rig this summer.Not sure exactly how low though.I might go for a ride this afternoon and check the lakes.I cross the Bear Narrows bridge on Eagle daily in my chip truck and it looks to be pretty low.
1428120,v-bay gord,2012-04-29 12:39:00,3168,"Eagle Lake is still very low.....maybe down a foot from last fall. Wabigoon is actually in much better shape.....maybe because it's watershed is twice the size of Eagle, but the lake is about half as big. Some rain/showers in the forecast for monday, tuesday....so that is good. In the past we have seen some really low water levels turn around very quickly with some good rains......I'm hoping for that scenario."
1428211,fishinnut 3446,2012-04-29 17:25:00,638,"So let's hope for rain or else I'm not coming this year!Just kidding maybe twice again,maybe this time I'll get over to Gord's place,NARDA I did'nt know you going over maybe I would have tagged along and tried some of that Rye stuff"
1428237,Sutsgold,2012-04-29 18:14:00,219,"Gord, thanks for the info. Could you please keep us informed, I am counting the days until I head up there! Also, we are looking for a place that will be showing the stanley cup this june, would that be vermilion bay lodge? In the past we have had to drive all the way into b and b's,. which is nice, but it is a distance from eagle."
1428250,v-bay gord,2012-04-29 18:28:00,3168,Sutsgold.....I'm sure Tracy at the Bayview Hotel in Vermilion Bay would have the Stanley Cup on. If there was a Canadian team still in I would have it on as well......and you would be invited. I will be monitoring the water level....you could check my blog ( www.electricbeaver.ca ) for updates. Good fishing to all on the opener on Eagle Lake!
1428256,Sutsgold,2012-04-29 18:43:00,219,Thanks Gord. I do watch your blog quite regularily for Eagle info. Love the ice out pics along with your other info. Please keep us Eagle lake fans posted on water levels.
1428292,Glenman12,2012-04-29 19:58:00,762,Gord...the video on your blog of the water bomber is awesome...
