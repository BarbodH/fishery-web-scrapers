1393346,jiggster,2012-02-12 14:15:00,183,Any new updates on the Bailey Bridge?
1393358,canadianjack,2012-02-12 14:49:00,10,They still don't have the bridge done yet but it is across the river again and just have to complete how they are going to fix it to the other side. They been having nothing but trouble....
1393854,jiggster,2012-02-13 15:09:00,183,Thanks for the information Jack. Looking forward to visiting with you this summer. My son and I will stop by your cabin and say hi.
1404773,jiggster,2012-03-09 12:15:00,183,I there anything new on the Bailey Bridge completion?
1405312,Cherob,2012-03-10 17:40:00,2,I have not been down to check on it myself. The highway signs still indicate that the road is closed. The rumor around town is that the engineering firm that is supervising the project has gone back to Thunder Bay to figure out how to attach it to the far shore. This will be the second time they would have done this. From what I saw when I was down there months ago is that the bridge is to short for the span. Who knows when it will be completed.
1416485,jiggster,2012-04-04 17:57:00,183,I was informed today the Bailey bridge is open for vehicles.
1429921,jiggster,2012-05-02 19:27:00,183,Early in the month I was informed the bridge was open for traffic for workers. Does anyone know if the bridge is completely finished now?
1368373,Golden Eagle,2011-11-28 09:55:00,2642,"Whoops, not a bridge that I use. I stay on Hwy 105 until reaching Red Lake."
1368392,wallydave,2011-11-28 10:41:00,2151,I guess we will not be able to give a June report in 200 days! Not that any one is counting down yet!
1374270,jiggster,2011-12-18 07:56:00,183,Any information if the bridge is completed?
1374398,teddi,2011-12-18 15:24:00,349,should be done by now. i am going up next week and will keep you posted.
1374461,jiggster,2011-12-18 18:37:00,183,Thanks Teddi
1374764,jkonop,2011-12-19 20:18:00,544,Any of you guys run the creek and fish Stork or LongLegged when you run down that road. I have not went there in a while but I may have to do it again.
1375766,teddi,2011-12-23 04:39:00,349,"the bridge is open now. it doesn,t look ant different than the old one just newer. they are doing some clean up around the site so all should be well for the spring."
1375897,jiggster,2011-12-23 13:53:00,183,Thank you Teddi. Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Same to everyone else!
1384332,Cherob,2012-01-21 14:03:00,2,I have been getting conflicting reports about this bridge. It was supposed to be in service before Christmas but the road signs still say it was closed. Today my father in law and I took a drive to see first hand. The new bridge is across the river but only good for pedestrian traffic. The problem is the west shoreline attachment. The engineering was faulty and they have shut down the project until more engineering has been completed to resolve the problem with the bedrock.They expect to be back in three weeks.Hopefully it will be open before spring.

1367835,jiggster,2011-11-25 16:52:00,183,Does anyone know what they are doing with the Bailey Bridge? Rebuilding or repairing?
1367845,Jonnyoc,2011-11-25 17:51:00,1,They will be replacing it starting next spring. Expect the highway to be closed at times.
1367881,Golden Eagle,2011-11-25 21:08:00,2642,"Hope you don't mind that I intend to check it myself in May, July, August, September and October."
1367893,teddi,2011-11-26 05:30:00,349,the bridge is being replaced now. hwy 804 is closed until december 15 to traffic as the old bridge is gone.
1367919,wallydave,2011-11-26 07:56:00,2151,"Our group will be at Goose Bay Camp in June, so we can check the bridge on our way to Four Seasons for crawlers and leeches."
1368142,jiggster,2011-11-27 09:27:00,183,Has anyone heard if it is a single lane or 2 lane bridge?
1368215,jkonop,2011-11-27 14:34:00,544,I can't wait to test out the new bridge then...
1368314,teddi,2011-11-28 05:07:00,349,single lane same as the old one. just new.
1368336,lcwhit,2011-11-28 07:45:00,104,where is that bridge? can't picture it.
1368368,teddi,2011-11-28 09:43:00,349,"down hwy 804 just south of ear falls. you cross it on your way to anderson,s manitou falls camp[yuck yuck]"
