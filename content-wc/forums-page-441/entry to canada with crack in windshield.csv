1428810,lcwhit,2012-04-30 16:27:00,104,i would guess that half the vehicles in nwo have cracked or chipped windshields sometime during the year.
1428843,T Mac,2012-04-30 17:47:00,10084,Man... almost everybody in Montana and Saskatchewan has a cracked windshield. I've never had a problem going either direction...and never heard of anybody being turned back on account of windshield cracks...and we have had some plumb ugly ones! - ...and I go to Canada at least 4 times a year.
1428982,v-bay gord,2012-04-30 21:13:00,3168,Reminds me of the fat women who was busted at the border for trying to smuggle in 50 pounds of crack.
1429005,BennieS,2012-04-30 22:11:00,108,"Jiggster, exactly what i proposed to both auto glass people i talked with, that i'd sign off on any leakage etc. They both start in with this mumbo jumbo liabilty malarkey. Drives me nuts, all I can say is that the world has gone down hill considerably in my lifetime and oddly enough it seems the decline started right about the time they allowed lawyers to advertise on TV. I mean really, come on, I'm gonna hire a lawyer and sue them because the windshield on my rusted 12 year old truck leaks. Oh ya, that'll make it all the way to the Supreme Court. Thanks guys for all the info. Full speed ahead, crack and all."
1429013,hogridnfool,2012-04-30 22:39:00,349,"Wisconsin DMV says this about windshields.....(3) The windshield may not be excessively cracked or damaged. A windshield is excessively cracked or damaged if: Trans 305.34(3)(a) (a) The windshield has a crack inside, or which extends inside, the windshield critical area. Trans 305.34(3)(b) (b) The windshield has cracks which extend into any area more than 8 inches from the frame. Trans 305.34(3)(c) (c) The windshield has stone or shot damage with a diameter in excess of ½ inch in the windshield critical area or in excess of 1½ inches in diameter in any other area."
1429872,Canuck_in_NC,2012-05-02 17:26:00,17,"I would be extremely surprised if Canada Customs even commented on it, if they do just tell them a dump truck did it on the way up."
1429882,jiggster,2012-05-02 17:54:00,183,"Bennies, that exactly what we did. He checked a box saying no warranty and replaced the window with no problem."
1429990,BennieS,2012-05-02 21:53:00,108,"Jiggster, appreciate the heads up. I'm going to revisit a few of these auto glass outfits, and on site so I can talk to a manager. It occurs to me that the guys who came to my place of work may have just not wanted to do it for some reason, didn't have the forms with them or whatever. That makes so much sense to me that you could just sign off on leakage, and accept no warranty etc. One of the guys who showed up at my workplace told me that it, ""would only cost about a grand for an auto body shop to fix the rust problem and then we could whip one right in"". Geez, auto glass installers must make a lot more than I would think they would with a comment like that, not to mention that in order to fix it, the auto body guys would need to remove the windshield and I'd have them replace it, duhhh. The whole vehicle can't bluebook at more than $3,500 for crying out loud. Thanks for taking the time to repost. Now that I know it can be done, I'm back on the warpath. Nothin's stopping me from getting to my resort, including the entire US Legal and Auto Glass Installation Associations, if there are such groups. I am however smart enough to respect the power of the CBSA thanks to all the posts on WC which is why I posted this to begin with.I love this site and thanks again."
1430075,jiggster,2012-05-03 07:04:00,183,"BennieS, When they replaced the glass he also used a steel wheel on a drill to take off as much rust as possible, then sprayed primer that would help with the rusting. He used a little more compound sealer in that area. He said we probably would have no problem. We haven't and been in some hard rains. Jiggster"
1431360,octanehi5,2012-05-06 08:06:00,1104,"Is it not a law in your state to fix this.If they want they can stop you from entering. I would not take a chance on that after waiting all yr to go on my fishing trip,fix it or drive differant car"
1428297,BennieS,2012-04-29 20:07:00,108,"I have a crack that runs horizontally the length of my winshield about two innches from the bottom of the windshield. Glass companies won't replace because of some rust along the top of the window. 2000 4 runner and i'm not paying a body shop to fix the rust as suggested. Am I going to get turned back at the border for being in an ""unsafe vehicle"". Anybody have any idea?"
1428310,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-29 20:19:00,235,I would try to contact the border service in Canada on that one. Don't leave that one to chance.
1428322,TroyMansfield,2012-04-29 20:28:00,92,"usually motor vehicle stuff is not enforced by customs, unless your importing, I have gone through with big jacked up trucks with no mufflers and they say nothing, but the OPP on the other hand got me once for not complying to the Ontario Highway Act, I have also gone through with a radar detector on my dash and they said nothing, even after searching the truck, but it is illegal to have and use them in Ontario. I put it away just incase I got trouble form the OPP. But like Ten Horse said, Id call, Canada does have some vehicle safety things that they are more strict then the USA on..... good luck"
1428323,4JawChuck,2012-04-29 20:29:00,277,"I doubt they will even notice, they aren't vehicle safety inspectors."
1428541,jambi,2012-04-30 09:34:00,504,Mine cracked on the drive up. Didn't have time to stop and replace on the road. Went through with nothing said. Never know though...
1428561,Outfitter17,2012-04-30 10:02:00,127,You should be just fine. It seems like I get a cracked windshield every other year from rocks on our road into camp. I don't have time to get the windshield replaced until after the season ends. I cross weekly and the customs agents have never said anything to me.
1428587,stjoeguy,2012-04-30 10:30:00,979,"I hit a deer on the way up to Canada one year. The right fender and hood were in rough shape and the right headlight was pointing down at a 45 degree angle. Fortunately, nothing was leaking and we could continue driving. I was anxious about the border crossing, also. Customs asked what happened and then just wished us a good trip and try not to hit anything larger. It made a good conversation starter wherever we stopped."
1428592,jiggster,2012-04-30 10:35:00,183,"I just had a windshield replaced with rust. There was no problem, they just would not give a warranty."
1428619,keek,2012-04-30 11:15:00,1003,"It's their JOB to notice. Don't chance it, call them."
1428664,Lake Wisconsin,2012-04-30 12:21:00,1960,Also had a large crack - no issues.
