At any rate I am going with a different group next year and we are looking for some suggestions for another camp. We have been at Wright's on Gullrock and thought Lee and Stephanie ran an excellent camp, we will continue to head there every other year but I would like to try other lakes as well. Would like to be within 12 hours of Twin Cities, around $700pp for a week with boat for light housekeeping. If we could find a camp similar to Wright's on another lake that would be great. I will say Manitoba sounds interesting. Thanks for any help."

Not trying to start a war on your post, but I too have been going to Gullrock for the past 30 years fishing out of Goldenhook Camp. I will also be there is 37 days. My wife has asked me several times why I don't fish a different lake for once and I have never came home disappointed with Gullrock or the hospitality out of Goldenhook. I have always heard good things about all the camps on Gullrock. Taking a chance on another lake just doesn't sound good to me, but one good thing about this board you're about to get bombarded with places to go. Good luck see you on Gullrock soon."
1428875,wallydave,2012-04-30 18:32:00,2151,"I have always had good to excellent fishing out of Goose Bay Camp near Ear Falls. not quiet as far North as Gullrock. They have great upgrade boats, the service and the docks have been constantly improved.http://www.lacseul.com/ The weeks can fill in a hurry so it might be hard to get a week, give Andrea a call or e-mail.Evergreen in the same area, seems to have a good following, Cherob, is another camp in the area that is pretty new. Rob has been good about responding to questions. Try some google searches and you will get plenty of responses with your post! Good luck!"
1428879,growingoldoffensively,2012-04-30 18:38:00,250,"""If it ain't broke don't fix it."" I've been fishing Red Cedar Lake near Mikana, WI for many years. Keep thinking I have to try something new. This year I added Lake of the Woods to the agenda, but I'm still going back to Red Cedar. If Gull Lake tripped my trigger I wouldn't even think about it. I'd go there and contemplate the mystery. Bet the lake will explain it to you."

1428923,stjoeguy,2012-04-30 19:54:00,979,"Here's another spot for you: Camp Lake St. Joseph. http://www.lakestjoseph.com/HOME.html It's 300 miles north of International Falls and the weekly rate is $700. As my name implies, I love the lake. I used to go to this camp, but now go 25 miles down the lake to the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin. http://www.winoga.com/outpost-locations/lake-st-joseph/ Either camp, same lake and the fishing is great. I'm sure you'll get lots of suggestions, so good luck with your decision. People obviously like the places they recommend so you probably can't go wrong with any of them."
1429057,Farmer07,2012-05-01 05:26:00,5,"Thanks for the info. I have heard of these before but getting an unsolicited endorsement from someone for a certain camp is a huge plus for me.As far as finding something better, I doubt we will. If I am lucky I will get to fish Canada maybe 30 times in my life. From spending way too much time on this website, according to my wife anyway, I see that we could go to a different spot every year and not even begin to scratch the surface. Gullrock is better than I had dreamed about, the Wrights are fantastic, and we will continue to visit them, but I bet other camps do a great job as well.36 days........"
