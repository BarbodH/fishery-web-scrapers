1429339,REG,2012-05-01 15:14:00,445,I have been across dozens of times and have never been asked for any paperwork for the boat. I think it's a good idea to always have your registration with you since IL requires it anyway. I've been asked if I have any gas in the boat beyond the built-in tank but we never take any extra with us. If you're asking how long to get across the border - it depends - but the last few years we've had about 3 cars in front of us at Int'l Falls on a Friday evening around 6ish.
