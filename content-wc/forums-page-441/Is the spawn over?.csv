1430719,Jabs,2012-05-04 14:05:00,24,"Troy,I heard that Pelican, Botsford, etc. are close to normall water levels. Is Lac Seul still way down?"
1430791,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-04 18:06:00,1460,That is very cool. Birds gotta eat too!
1428489,Jabs,2012-04-30 08:33:00,24,Do you think with the early ice out that the spawn is over on Lac Seul or the water temps are still too cold for it to happen yet?
1428526,v-bay gord,2012-04-30 09:09:00,3168,Next to me the suckers have just started to spawn in the creek. They spawn later than the walleyes so I would imagine that the walleye spawn is winding down. The lake spawning walleyes on the other hand are probably just getting going. Seems the early ice out and mild winter didn't change the timing of the sucker spawn all that much......for what that's worth.
1428563,Outfitter17,2012-04-30 10:06:00,127,"The suckers haven't even started to spawn on our lake. Ice has been out for weeks, but the water temps at the dock are still only 42f. It doesn't look like the early ice out really changed the fish spawning."
1428922,octanehi5,2012-04-30 19:53:00,1104,Your ? has to do with were you are and when ice out was or is not yet the lake that I fish in northern quebec is not open water yet. If your water temp has hit 50s its over I work at the walleye hatchery this yr at lake Oneida NY The spawn was the earlest on record it was over before the usual start date. 320 million fry in two weeks
1429027,TroyMansfield,2012-04-30 23:15:00,92,"I say in my neck of the wood they havnt spawned yet, Ive been checking the creeks where a large walleye spawn happens and I havnt seen any walleyes in there yet, no suckers either, but I do have friends that argue that its over but I dont think so, the water hasnt been warm enough for them, we have had some warm days, but the night time it still get cold. the weather hasnt been constant enough for the water to warm up enough for them to spawn I believe, I could be wrong, Ill keep checking the creeks till I thinks its done."
1429380,octanehi5,2012-05-01 17:22:00,1104,Troy how long ago was ice out
1429588,115 optimax,2012-05-02 07:20:00,650,I noticed that also.
1430249,TroyMansfield,2012-05-03 13:47:00,92,"the ice was out about a week before the walleye season closed on april 14 on Minnitaki, Abram, Pelican and Botsford, and lot of it was out on Lac Seul on the SE side, Sturgeon lake still had ice and Lake St joe as of a week and half ago. I havnt checked lately for st joe or sturgeon though, but Ill be out that way next week on both those lakes"
1430386,octanehi5,2012-05-03 19:37:00,1104,"If Ice out was more than three weeks ago its over,The spawn was very sperratic this yr. sometimes you can walk across them in the brooks and streams, not this yr. it was very early."
1430514,v-bay gord,2012-05-04 07:06:00,3168,"Here's some footage of the spawn going on near me as of yesterday afternoon. Sorry, they aren't walleyes but it might be interesting if you haven't seen how the spawn happens..........http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClLiBdTaooA"
