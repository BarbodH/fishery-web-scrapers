1429532,Pooch,2012-05-02 04:13:00,4619,"I paint my own jigs using offshore jigs. Couple years ago a white glow jig with a dash of blue was the cats meow for LT using a large sucker.That said a darkish blue jig with blue marabou and a small treble stinger and a large sucker has been the best and most consistent producer for our group. We drift jig. Since I'm lazy (economy of movement) I set on the butt of my pole holding the rod with my left hand for hook set and use my right hand to pull on the line just ahead of the reel to impart some jigging action. That way I can feel a bump or light pickup and respond. Most of the time lake trout are not very subtle about the pickup! It's like getting your line snagged on a passing Volkswagen.Most of the time fishing for LT is like watching paint dry or going shopping with your sweety, but when you hook up they are a hoot.Pooch"
1429574,Mohleye,2012-05-02 06:54:00,368,"I agree, and that's why I 've gotten to the point of only jigging when I fish for them. I've used many trolling methods with varying degrees of success, but I just find them all to get boring pretty quickly. At least with jigging you have the rod in your hand and the action you impart to the jig has something to do with it. After a half hour of trolling I start thinking of how much more fun it would be to be walleye fishing."
1428776,KEEBOY,2012-04-30 15:15:00,61,Thanks again for all the information on the jigs used for lakers. I did pick up some tube baits and some jigging spoons. However I am having a hard time finding jig heads for the tube baits in the larger weights say 1/2 - 1 ounce and with the larger hooks that would fit the tube baits without tearing them. Any suggestions on where one could find them? I have done some searching with out much luck.
1428804,JayM5209,2012-04-30 16:13:00,1050,"Keeboy, if you haven't done so already, check Cabelas saltwater fishing section on line. There may be something in the saltwater jigs shown there that will serve your purposes.http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/brows...3Bcat104618880"
1428913,guidedfishing,2012-04-30 19:33:00,531,"yup saltwater catalog from Cabela's. You can get all 1 - 2 ounce jig, white and glow with a sturdy hook. Mostly 1 to 1 1/2 ounce work, Also pick up some white fluke tails drives the lakers nuts. Good luck"
1428984,Piscatorian,2012-04-30 21:17:00,12,"Get the ones with the long shanked hooks -- that's real important for the bigger baits. Most of the jig hooks out there (e.g., Owner) are way smaller than you want relative to the weight of the jig if you are going to use plastics 6 inch or larger, or you miss a lot of fish. There's a great 1 oz size you can get from bass pro saltwater, with an 8/0 hook (if I remember right), that pairs nicely with a 6-7 inch plastic for lakers. Need some sharpening, but they are great. I use that same one (and sometimes cut off some of the lead (with bolt cutters and repaint) for casting plastics to pike when they are running about 7' or deeper. That jig has killed a lot of big pike for me -- well, actually I release them rather gently :-). 1.5 and 2 ounce jigs with bigger hooks for deeper trout have been harder to find, though I did find a couple of decent ones at some point but not recalling the source right now."
1429088,Bill Krejca,2012-05-01 06:30:00,6107,"The heads can be postioned ahead of the tube, not inside. Use a collared jig jhead, slip over the collar, and super glue to hold. Bill"
1429109,Mohleye,2012-05-01 07:03:00,368,"I do it as Bill suggests, but haven't bothered with the super glue. Seems to work fine. I got the jig heads from Cabela's, but it does pay to sharpen the hooks. Lakers have hard mouths!"
1429119,115 optimax,2012-05-01 07:16:00,650,"Try a quarter ounce white glow in the dark whistler jig with a glow twister tail,tip it with a minnow.Works AWESOME!"
1429186,KEEBOY,2012-05-01 09:58:00,61,"Well again thanks for all the great suggestions. I should be good to go. I have tube baits, flukes, jigging spoons and now jig heads. I was just so focused on finding large tube style jigs didn't see the obvious with glueing the tubes to collared jig head. Can't beat WC for great information. Now just have to wait another 32 days to give all this new stuff a try."
1429285,Mohleye,2012-05-01 13:13:00,368,"You'll have fun, and now I'll hijack your thread if you don't mind....I've been wondering what jigging technique others use. I do a fast upward ripping motion, probably raising the jig 2-3', and then try to keep a minimum of slack in my line as I let the jig sink. Seems like most of the hits occur as it is sinking. This is in mid-summer, fishing at 40-60'. Fishing shallower in spring or fall I would be less aggressive."
1429493,Bill Krejca,2012-05-01 20:52:00,6107,"The reason I use glue is that I've had fish hit my unglued tube/grub/minnow/whatever, and, unbeknownst to me pull it partially off, really messing up the action. Because it is not real bait, there seemingly would be no reason to reel in and check it (like with bait). I believe I have fished with a messed up plastic for quite some time , until moving, etc. all the time, the plastic was skewed, so I was essentially out of business, and didn't know it. For a long time now, I have glued every plastic. Bill Krejca"
