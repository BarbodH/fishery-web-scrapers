1428033,Bluff,2012-04-29 08:40:00,152,"Yes, I believe water temperature can have a lot to do with Trout fishing - as with other fish. The year we caught lake trout in shallow water was just after ice-out in the spring. Very unusual cold spring and that probably had a lot to do with it."
1428048,Limeyangler,2012-04-29 09:15:00,563,Typically lakers will be found in 45-55 degrees F. So in the spring they will be everywhere...or at least potentially everywhere after ice out.
1428058,JayM5209,2012-04-29 09:27:00,1050,"I recently did some on-line searching regarding the laker's preferred temperature ranges. This is from my recollection - - - lakers can survive in a temperature range higher than ""preferred temperature."" One study I saw gave a preferred temperature range of 48-52 degrees in the Great Lakes. Another cited 42-44 degrees for Canadian Shield lakes. Still a third, from a NW Ontario lodge web site, said 48-55 degrees (all in Fahrenheit). However, while the trout will hang out in water at their preferred temperatures, they will chase their prey and feed during forages into warmer water. For instance, in many trout lakes the main forage is ciscoes which like to hang out in water in the low to mid-50s.Temperature is important when fishing for lakers. When water temps are getting into the mid- to high 50s, they're probably heading for deeper water. That being said, in 30+ years my group has always gotten lakers in our last week of May/1st week of June annual trip. At that time of year we rarely fish deeper than 25'-30', often getting the trout in the top ten feet. If the water is still cold, shallow structure - even like 5' of water - close to deep water is the place to start. Nothing like tossing a lure to the shore line rocks to start long line trolling and have a laker slam it as soon as you put the boat into gear!P.S. If you plan to jig for lake trout, a very effective way to get them, toss a blade bait or two into your tackle box."
1428061,elway12,2012-04-29 09:36:00,335,"We are usually fishing for lakers in mid-July so the lakers are deep(min. 50-70ft). They seem to feed at this depth and then go even deeper when not. We use 3/4oz jigs rigged with sucker minnows with a stinger hook. I have caught some very nice ones this way. Thing about summer lakers is that if they are ""on""/feeding they are on but if they turn off (I have heard many times after lighting storms) they could ""shut down"" for a couple of days. My group experienced this last year in Canada."
1428137,Piscatorian,2012-04-29 14:06:00,12,"If your after the big girls, here's another couple of options that have worked well for me: 1.5 ounce muskie sized rattetrap, 1 - 2 ounce saltwater jigs with large plastics (7-9""), and two spoons doubled up on the same split rings, such as two Eppinger Husky Jrs. Adding a hoochie tail to that is a nice touch, too."
1428449,KEEBOY,2012-04-30 07:43:00,61,Thanks for all the input I really appreciate the info. I will go out and get some of these and give it a try. I hope I can post some good reports when we get back.
1427291,KEEBOY,2012-04-27 12:37:00,61,I have a question for those who may fish for Lake Trout. We will be going to Lake Kississing in NW Manitoba the first weekend of June and we typically catch some really nice Lake Trout. We usually catch them trolling with jointed rapalas on bottom bouncers. But if that isn't working we would like to try to jig for them. Could anyone give me some ideas on what types of jigs you use to catch lakers? Do you tip them with bait of some kind or do you use jigging spoons? Is there a particular color that works best? Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

1427328,briand,2012-04-27 13:34:00,48,Hard to beat jigging with a white tube jig. I'm a believer of tipping the jig and if you can get your hands on sucker belly. That would be my first choice.Silver spoons are a good bet as well.Though we don't start jigging for lakers till they start going deep.One of the best ways to land lakers in spring can be from shore over lunch.Just cast out with a froozen minnow or a hunk of sucker. many time we've seen guys on shore do as well and at time better then in the boat

1427351,KEEBOY,2012-04-27 14:14:00,61,We have the best luck with the Black and Silver J13 jointed raps. We use about a 3 ounce bottom bouncer with about a 6 foot leader and troll extremely slow maybe .5mph. Other colors have worked like the black and gold and minnow but I would say 85% of the lakers come off of the blk/silv. We are fishing in about 30-40 fow with this rig.
1427358,digjig,2012-04-27 14:40:00,146,"As VBay Gord said, ""3 inch white tube jigs tipped with a minnow or jigging spoons such as a blue and silver Little Cleo."" I've used the same or similar setup with consistant success. I typically find bottom, jig fairly hard 5 times or so and start reeling up at a medium speed. Typically they will hit it on the way up in deeper water. Call it verical trolling ; ) -DJ"
1427369,Limeyangler,2012-04-27 15:20:00,563,"White tube jigs, jig and medium minnow, jigging raps(awesome) and lipless cranks. Basically anything used ice fishing i have found is effective.other very helpfull tools are electronics and an anchor. Calm days help too. You can basically anchor up and watch for fish and your jig on the screen.I do this type of fishing lots in the summer in 50-65' FOW.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRf3W34_o3M http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjaVa...feature=relmfuhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmpuSbsMFochttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDWjvsjXPB0"

1427787,Bluff,2012-04-28 15:32:00,152,"I agree with using a heavy jig. One thing I won't try again is using a three-way swivel with a heavy sinker - that was a mess (aka ""poor man's down rigger""). I was trying to fish 75-feet down while another guy in our group caught a Lake Trout in 10-feet of water using an eight ounce jig. Go figure."
