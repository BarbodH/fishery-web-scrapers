1428659,camp chef,2012-04-30 12:14:00,915,Make sure to stop at Thunderbird Lodge just down the lake/road at least once for dinner and cocktails. We used to stay at the Island view on our way to Canada each year but we now stay at the Thunderbird because of the fine service and menu. I can' help with fishing info as we only stop for a night on way further north
1428690,cast_and_blast,2012-04-30 12:56:00,1098,I'm on Rainy (both the US and Canadian side) at least twice per summer for 2 weeks total. The canadian side for a (almost) exclusive smallmouth trip and the US side for primarily a walleye trip but also crappie. The Candian side is where you want to be for smallies - they are on the US side too but MUCH better fishing on the Canadian side due to more water flow. It's a beautiful lake - I'll be there on 5/15. Scott
1428928,dmack,2012-04-30 20:03:00,61,"Heading up on the 25th of May. This will be my 2nd trip. We stay at Idlewood on the south shore. We fish mostly in Canada. I have the benefit of going with guys that have been going for at least 10 years. We fish for all species. Smallies are a huge priority for a couple of us. But, and it goes without saying, I am really a walleye guy first. We can always use some help. Any tips people can give on smallies would be appreciated."
1429123,Skidoo600homxz,2012-05-01 07:23:00,37,"Smallies will not be ideal in May but can still be caught, you will need to go fairly deep for them with slower presentation. The bass dont typically move into the shallows until mid June depending on water temps. The walleye fishing should be awesome at that time though."
1429133,cast_and_blast,2012-05-01 08:07:00,1098,"Smallies are already being caught with regularity in the shallows and in adjacent staging areas (as of last week). We're there every May (been there in June, July and August too) and we usually do very, very well. We C&R all smallies. If you get there too late, then you're dealing with post-spawn and you'll primarily catch 2-3.5 pound males. Good luck! Scott"
1429281,walleyeriz,2012-05-01 13:06:00,8,"We got lucky and booked Woody our first day on the lake. With this being our first time on Rainy we are probably just going to fish the Minn. side. Thanks to everyone that answered me, This site is pretty awsom. The week befor we go I'll shout out again hopefully I can get an update on conditions, water temps ect.."
1429297,cast_and_blast,2012-05-01 13:45:00,1098,"Woody will put you on fish, won't chase you to the other side of the lake, share many laughs and sell you a shirt or two. He's good people. Scott"
1429313,Skidoo600homxz,2012-05-01 14:17:00,37,"As I said, they can be caught, just not in the numbers that you would in mid June. I fish the lake constantly an I live here and I know how the fish locate themselves at different times of the year and by different water temps. Smallies can be caught year round if you know what you are doing but not everyone is a pro angler."
1426873,Skidoo600homxz,2012-04-26 14:21:00,37,Hello to All!!! Just wanted to start a general post on Rainy Lake Walleye Fishing as there was not much on here about it. As many of you know it is an excellent fishery for both walleye and bass. I have fished the area my whole life and have been guiding on Rainy Lake for many years and can stongly say that there is really nowhere I would rather go fishing. Post a cool story or experience you have had on Rainy!
1427127,MorganMan,2012-04-27 06:57:00,341,"Hopefully I will after the family and I rent a cabin on the lake in June!! Fished the river at ice out many times, but only on Rainy Lake once. Looking forward to it."
1427352,Jatar,2012-04-27 14:19:00,169,"My son at age 10, 28.5"" hawgasorous , 10-10-2010, it was 88 degrees that day. We fished strictly on the U.S. side, didn't catch big numbers, but a lot of big fish !"
1427493,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-27 20:41:00,235,"For those who cross at Int'l Falls heading north, Rainy is the perfect welcome to Canada. That's a Canadian shield lake! The smallmouth fisherman in me pictures myself being able to catch bass all over that lake. However, I rarely if ever see people fishing around there. You can see a lot of water from the bridge, yet we see very few boats if any. Is that not a good fishing part of the lake?"
1427511,Nimstug,2012-04-27 21:37:00,2605,"I've fished both far ends of Rainy - in the Kettle Falls area once and the Northwest Arm 4 times with our 5th trip coming the week of September 14. The last couple of years we were there week of Labor Day. It was unusually warm last year, in the mid 80's. The walleyes were mostly deeper than 30' so we didn't target them. Lots of bass, northern and crappies of a size I've never seen before. I think there may be only 2 or 3 resorts toward middle arm where the big bridge is located which might explain why you don't see many boats. I've been on that bridge a few times and didn't see anyone in a boat but that's not much of a survey sample. And in some ways you are further 'north' in an unpopulated area than you think. Nimstug"
1427591,MorganMan,2012-04-28 07:13:00,341,"We only head over that bridge once a year, but have never seen any boats either.....been almost 20 years too! We will be on US side the last week of June. My kids love to fish so we should have a good time. I only target Walleye so not sure how to go about targeting Crappie?? Kids love to throw plugs for bass though."
1427604,Kevin R,2012-04-28 07:32:00,305,"I have been going north starting in 1965 but have never fished Rainy Lake, it looks like the lakes we do fish. I think the size of Rainy or that it is on the border with city's on it may have kept us going farther north for more of a wilderness feeling & assumed better fishing. I have heard the fishing is as good or even better than the lakes I fish far north of Rainy, in fact I was told that Rainy has a very healthy Pike population that is over looked by those that fish it."
1427726,ManitouBass,2012-04-28 12:35:00,201,"You'll never see many people fishing near the Causeway. It is productive, but there are much better spots. The boat launch at 5mile is just too close for most to consider staying there to fish, thats all. 7 mile bridge near the causeway is pretty good for big walleye/smallies. In fact it's in alot of the Rapala fishing vids for their tutorials. Northwest bay is by far the best area to fish for big walleye and pike. On the east there are some great spots around Porters inlet, great walleye and crazy crappie fishing. The north arm of Rainy is stellar for just about any species."
1427743,walleyeriz,2012-04-28 13:06:00,8,"We have a group of 7 fishing Rainy Lake for the first time; we are staying at Island View Lodge June 2nd to June 9th. Due to the application process of the RABC permit we have to make a decision pretty quick in regards to fishing the Canada side. I'm looking for some incite as to whether or not fishing north is necessary. I've heard the smallmouth action is better up there. We are going to fish walleye, northern and smallmouth as well as croppy.Thanks in advance for advise."
1427806,Nimstug,2012-04-28 16:11:00,2605,You have a PM.
