It hits home to me since I've used Kabeelo for years and know the planes, the scenery etc. The takeoff is from the air base on Confederation Lake, but I'm not sure which of the outposts they're landing on (it's not a lake I've been to, I know that). Hope this video excites you for your own Canada trip, wherever that may be. 70 days and counting before I will be doing this, and time is moving very slowly right now...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxZzfn4pZI"

1430767,Downrigger,2012-05-04 16:46:00,60,"Was the takeoff from Minnitaki? Great, great footage. Can't wait to get up there. Only 13 days till I leave and 17 days till I will be on the water."
1430768,Downrigger,2012-05-04 16:50:00,60,My bad. Reread and saw Confederation Lake. All Ontario water looks good.

1430931,PRO-V1,2012-05-05 05:42:00,142,"Lived in Pickle Lake quite a few years, and like skywagon mentioned one of the things i miss believe it or not is the 5 am takeoffs Mike"
