Since I don't want to miss any fishing time, I thought I could make a long weekend trip or two this year. Other than LOTW, are there any quality Northern Pike lakes within an hour of International Falls? Thanks for sharing your experiences and recommendations. Have a fantastic fishing year and be safe on the water."
