This applies even if the charge is recent (less than 5 years). You will then be given the instructions on how to apply for ""rehabilitation"" for future entries. One big note......if the charge is less than 5 years old they will not consider any applications for ""rehabilitation"".....in other words you get in once and must wait for the 5 year period. While this doesn't make much sense, be aware that this is a temporary measure. There are future changes in the works that might make the whole process more logical. In the mean time this might work well for the individual who shows up at the border unawares that his recent dui has made him ineligable.....a good will gesture to calm down the tourism lobby groups. Thank you Member of Parliament Greg Rickford!"
