I use my smart phone on the drive up (as the passenger) to keep tabs on the delay. Most years we only have to wait a few minutes, but one year it was over 2 hours. Since then I keep tabs on it especially since we have a float plane to catch. http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html Happy May Day to everyone. Only 19 more days to go! (at least for us)"
