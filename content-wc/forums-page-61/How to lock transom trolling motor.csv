There is a good Youtube video that shows a way to do it, but don't think that I have the skill to do what the guy did. I'll check out home depot. Anyone with a solution? Do you just put the troller in the trunk when you stop at a motel.hotel for the night? I do drive the car with the troller on the boat....bad call."

6596656,mms3rd,2021-09-13 11:08:00,148,It would have been nice to have a video. I have trouble envisioning things. My clamping screws are about 3 inches apart.....don't see how they would fit in the slots. This is same model as my trolling motor. I doubt that I can make his locking device (sketchy video).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnB5...CharlesHoofman

On my trip, I spent 4 nights in motels/hotels without a lock and had no issues. I screwed the motor down so tight, I could hardly get it off when I got home."
