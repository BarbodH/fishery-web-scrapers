Bucktails, whopperploppers, spinnerbaits and boilermakers still producing, bucktails probably hooking more for me.https://youtu.be/QJgYAOtqZi8https://youtu.be/z7cJr5aPW2U"

Front to back about 10 inches and wide length about 11-12 inches. There is an outlet for lights and a ""cleat."" My boat guy says he can't fit a bow mounted trolling motor. I guess you would disagree. I fish solo and using a tiller, transom tolling doesn't work well at all! Suggestions from all are welcome. AWESOME muskie fishing."

I keep checking to insure the nuts underneath the platform are tight, been on for about 8 years. Thinking of upgrading to one with spot lock."
