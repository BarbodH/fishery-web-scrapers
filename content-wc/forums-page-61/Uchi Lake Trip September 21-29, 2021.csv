With my Navy buddy Dave we decided to make it an 8 day trip and go all out with American Plan since we hadn't been able to fish last year and missed a summer trip this year due to border closure. The border crossing was uneventful and easy just answered the questions asked with short concise responses. Stayed overnight at the Trillium Motel in Ear Falls where we also ate dinner after arrival. Everything good here. Flew in on a twin engine Beechcraft with Showalters. Shayne the owner provided a full day of guided fishing for us since we hadn't fished the lake before. This included a marvelous shore lunch at the shore lunch site which we shared with only other two fishing guests at the lodge. With Shayne guiding us we caught many walleye from various spots heading south from the lodge. We also enjoyed a one day portage to Legg Lake. Unfortunately this was a very windy day with the wind coming straight down this long narrow lake. Did manage some nice walleye there. Our best luck was the northern section of Uchi Lake. Caught many walleye along the small island, and our largest pike of 38 was caught trolling along the shoreline towards this island. We tried artificials but had best fishing with jigs and minnows. As most walleye were concentrated in small areas in 22-29 feet of water, had to use 3/8 oz. jigs. Weather was cooperative with only rain one evening / overnight. It rained on the drive up so timing was perfect. Did have slight frost on the boardwalks on two mornings, but afternoons warmed up nicely with temps near 70. Food was great thanks to Marcia who did the cooking and cleaning. Overall the walleye fishing was excellent. We probable caught 800 fish altogether in our 8 days there. Largest walleye were 23, 25, two at 26, and a 27. All in all an enjoyable trip that I'd recommend to anyone looking to catch a lot of walleye."
