Thought we were done, but the four of us were lucky enough to be selected for another test at the border, on Saturday morning(we were the first through Sat. morning, so we were entittled to get 4 of the dozen or so kits to be handed out for the day). Given instructions to do the nose swab and tests would be picked up later. Cutting the story short, after numerous additional phone calls every day, and miscommunications with the 4 different friendly workers, a U-Haul truck finally arrived on Tuesday down the 5-1/2 mile private camp road at Cedar Point Resort, and picked up the samples. I guess we came up negative, 'cause we never heard back, and we are all still breathing! As to the fishing, It was good. Having experienced 5-6 trips to the lake, the fish just seem to always be in a bit different place each time. Walleyes were plentiful, an observation was that more were closer to the ""just under 18"" than normal, chalking this up to the ""rest"" from fishing which they had last year. Crappies were a bit harder to find, our boat of four came in with 43 nice ones on Thursday, already having 17 in the freezer for the limit of 60(at this lake). We ate walleye and crappie every day; there was no shortage of fish which were caught. All fish all week were taken on my killer jigs and tube jigs, no live bait, as in the past, was used. The water temp was 63 degrees upon arrival, and the same when we left a week later. Water level was down at least 2 feet, perhaps a bit more. Found a new rock upon entering Nelson Lake, no damage done. Only caught one crappie in Nelson, which is extremely unusual, and a bit almost suspicious to me. Did not attempt to get into Peephole Lake, as the water was very shallow at the entrance. Exchanged hand waves with guide John as he whizzed by us with his clients, out on the lake. The weather was unusually warm for this time of the year, Monday it rained hard, the rest of the week was mostly dry, and several days were very sunny, August-like, even uncomfortably hot. All-in-all, a very satisfying trip with my son and five other friends. Back again next year, God willing! Bill"

6600232,Lazy Fisherman,2021-09-29 14:25:00,276,Thank you for the report.
6600256,prov1800,2021-09-29 17:22:00,5010,Sounds like a winner trip.I guess we might of waved near the narrows.To bad I didn't know it was you.If it was.Agreed fishing is solid.Crappies did not spawn in Nelson or Peephole.Very strange.Have been catching them on main lake but not in numbers iam used to.Hopefully next year it will be easier to cross but have my doubts.Maybe the US will let us in your country soon.
6600258,Eckohlt,2021-09-29 17:29:00,3685,John are you sure you want to come to Minnesota to fish?
6600324,prov1800,2021-09-30 06:15:00,5010,Don't think so.But be nice to go visiting or camps to do spòrtshows
6600328,Bill Krejca,2021-09-30 06:52:00,6107,"John - Saw you fishing in Nelson with clients, didn't know it was you. Later we fished just outside for a bit, and everyone waved to each other as you exited and headed south. I had a red 20' Alaskan with 4 people in it. I wonder if there is some long term wide spread activity in Nelson in the winter on the ice. Had some friends this week get stuck trying to get into Peephole, quite a struggle to get off the sandbar. Bill"
6600336,prov1800,2021-09-30 07:32:00,5010,I got into peephole in June but was low but doable.Crappies were not in there either and never spawned there like Nelson.I Sid find them in other spawning sites on main lake.There is ice fißhing going on in Nelson as well as peephole but hear its slow.Sandbar freezes over and crappies cant get in so fishing is slow last couple tears so less traffic lately in winter.I ice fish main lake with great success.I wait till only ice on lake so no one can follow my tracks.Not showing anyone any tricks.Guys that fish Nelson in winter also fish Richmond on other side of bridge.I do remember seeing your boat.great week except for the one day with storms and rain.one day will catch up.lol.Nelson was fantastic for walleye.Did one whole day in there.One day east end and a day on west side and a fly out to Zizania.
