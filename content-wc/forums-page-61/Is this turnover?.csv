I'll post a detailed report soon).I believe that the last night of my trip (before the morning of 9/17) the main part of Wine Lake turned over...or started to. The day before, surface water temps were north of 61.5 F. Dropping about a steady half degree every day during the week. It was cool and very breezy all night. In the morning, coming off a plane over the deepest part of the lake and turning on my sonar, I noticed a temp around 58 degrees. (I don't remember exactly.) There were also NASTY whitecaps just beyond a narrow area where the fetch was longer than. For those of you who know Wine Lake, it was a stiff west wind over Dynamite Bay.A bit later, after having a hard time finding fish that would bite, I headed over to a calm deep basin area, and adjusted the gain on my sonar all the way up. I took this picture. The rest of the day, fishing was much slower then the previous couple of days and every time I paid attention, the surface temp was 60.83 +/-.01 F. Was that turnover?(Sorry for the crappy picture. I can zoom in, but I'm stuck with the reflection.)"

6599076,Doublelung76,2021-09-23 10:24:00,42,Typically during turnover there is all kind of decaying matter from the bottom suspended in the water column and all over surface also.sucks to fish in.im going on an semi annual musky trip in 2 weeks and I am hoping to avoid turnover
6599634,Limeyangler,2021-09-26 05:45:00,563,"I could be wrong but I don't think the lakes in this area (NW Ontario) are 'turning over ' just yet. I found an interesting article done by the IISD Experimental Lakes Area who work just outside of Kenora. They state........""Lake turnover is a phenomenon whereby the entire volume of water in a lake is mixed by wind. This can only happen when the entire lake is the same temperature (and density!), which in northwestern Ontario (home to IISD-ELA) generally occurs two times per yearÂ—once in the spring after the ice melts, and once in the fall before ice forms.""
