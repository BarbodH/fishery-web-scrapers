567454,Guest,2007-07-16 11:08:00,0,"Have fished Chamberlain Narrows late July, but was unable to go this summer. Am now thinking of trying to go up for a short 3 day fishing trip end of August or early September. Would like some suggestions on best area of the lake to fish this time of the year and also suggestions on resorts to stay at. Do any of the resorts offer reduced rates at this time of the year? Thanks in advance for any help you can give me! Locopoco"
