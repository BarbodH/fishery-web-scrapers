My dad, 2 brother-in-laws, friend and former teacher/coach are heading to Ear Falls to fly out with Kayair to Birch Lake for 6 days of fishing. The anticipation is like Christmas as a little kid...my wife doesn't get it!!!! Time on the water is time thatis well remembered...especially with Dad. Wish us luck and will have a report when we return."

567348,Guest,2007-07-12 16:54:00,0,it is truly a passion. the best days of the year. i've told my son to spread my ashes in a particular bay on lac seul. i LOVE it.

I asked him one time if he would like his ashes spread in our favorite Canadian lake and he said, ""No, I want them spread out in my back field. But I wish I could hook onto this lake with a tractor and drag it home!"""

567362,Guest,2007-07-13 10:41:00,0,My Dad's ashes are in a lake in canada. that is what he would have wanted as he loved a canadian fishing trip.
