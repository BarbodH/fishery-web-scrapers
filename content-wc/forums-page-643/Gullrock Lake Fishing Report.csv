Had several cold fronts pass through the area, mayflies were hatching, rain & wind with a little sun. No I am not going to give up my fishing hole. Fishing was great, two of us in my boat our best day was 73 walleye, most other day 35-60 walleye. We fished within two miles of camp ( Golden Hook Camp). Didn't have to buy any gas. We used our electric trolling motor once we got to our fishing hole. Works for us. Bill & Maureen have one of the cleanest camps our group has ever stayed at. Equipment & cottages are all well maintained. We are booked again for next year."

Where are the current hot spots? I have always had luck fishing the boot, sunken island, burnt island, and near the gull rock. Any current information would be appreciated."
567301,2746,2007-07-11 14:45:00,3206,"Kevin, welcome to WC or at least your registration is new. We also go tp Five Lakes Lodge and have been for several years. Twice a year and sometimes 3. (miss Bud and Melinda but Everett seems like a nice guy) We were there for opening week and will be coming in the Saturday you leave for another week. Love the lake and the only complaint I would have is it's getting a bit crowded at times, at least on some spots. We fish many of the places you do and also have good luck working on up the shore line from the boot toward fishermans point. We've given up on the Sunken Island because of the number of boats. You might try the Island just south of burnt that's marked with a red buoy on the west end. Lots of structure on both ends of that Island. Also a ridge of structure running from Burnt to the boot (follow your sonar) that can hold fish when other spots are slow."
567302,Guest,2007-07-11 15:00:00,0,We were on Gullrock June 23-29 and stayed at Goldenhook. It was our 1st time on the lake. We fished almost all bottom bouncers the entire time. What worked best for us was a 1 or a 1 1/2 oz bouncer with a brass colored single hook spinner rig. We brought up a flat of crawlers and ther did not seem to be a difference between the bite on them or minnows. We caught lots and lots of fish!
567322,Guest,2007-07-11 20:46:00,0,"We had 2 trips to Gullrock, and the island with the red marker buoy was the most consistent spot both years. Definitely a go-to spot."
566132,Tonyo,2007-06-10 18:03:00,212,"Just thought I there might be a few of you traveling to the Gullrock Chain in the next few weeks and might want to know how the fishing has been. Our group of 8 just returned from a week of great fishing. We caught most of the walleye in 12 - 22 ft of water on jigs, minnows and crawlers. We found them most places outside of Ranger Bay. we only fished the bay for a couple of hours with some smaller fish but not the numbers we caught elsewhere. We had many days at 100 + for the group and it was our best year for 20""+ fish with the biggest at 27 1/2"". Water Temps are around 57 degrees F and the water level is just a little higher than normal. Good luck to all going in the near future. Tonyo"
566135,Guest,2007-06-10 21:00:00,0,"Thanks for the Gullrock update ! I go in under two weeks, it will be our first time."
566136,the_bronco,2007-06-10 21:27:00,86,"Thanks Tanyo, I hope you left us a few!! My group will be there in four days and eleven hours!"
566220,Guest,2007-06-12 15:05:00,0,"Sounds great! Bronco, I can't wait to see you. I hope you have been working on your landing net skills. I have a good net story to tell you when we meet up at the border. 3 days . . . I can't wait. I am actually almost totally packed, which is a modern day record for me."
566225,the_bronco,2007-06-12 20:04:00,86,I am packed!! See you in three days!!!
566235,Guest,2007-06-13 07:33:00,0,"One of my buddies was at Gull Rock last week. He said although the weather was not the greatest, the fishing was the best they've ever had, and they've gone for many years."
566633,Guest,2007-06-25 08:37:00,0,"We just got back from Gullrock on June 23rd. The fishing was outstanding. Some of the best numbers we have ever had, and without a doubt-the biggest fish our group has been into. The regulations are really working! The fish are very healthy. Great trip! The weather was cool and windy, and I didn't even get a single bug bite until the last day. I can't wait to go back (too bad I have to wait a whole year now). Let those big ones go!"
566783,the_bronco,2007-06-28 15:46:00,86,"I was with Pickle- Ditto to everything he said. Just wish I could get back there more than once a year. Not just for the fishing, but also because of the great group of guys I share it with. What a great trip!!. Congrats again Pickle on your 29"" fish. Jim"
566796,Guest,2007-06-29 08:45:00,0,"can you guys recommend some resorts on this chain. have never been, but am interested.."
566823,Tonyo,2007-06-30 09:11:00,212,"There are a few to choose from but we have been going to Five Lakes Lodge for several years now. They have very nice cabins, fish cleaning facilities and docks. I can't comment on the other lodges on the lake but they all seem to be very simmilar to Five Lakes. Take a look at the web site www.fivelakeslodge.com to get an idea of the facilities and rates. Some of the other lodges to look into are, South Bay, Procyks Anglers Paridise and Wrights. It is a great lake to fish. You will have a great time. ""Fish On"" Tonyo"
