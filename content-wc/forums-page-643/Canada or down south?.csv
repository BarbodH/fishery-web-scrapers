567436,Tonyo,2007-07-14 23:01:00,212,"It's Canada for me. I live on Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri and can go fish large mouth carp, crappie, etc. but once you get Canada and there walleye in you blood, nothing seems to compare. As for the cost, when you know you are going you can save all year for the trip. I have a family of 8 so budgeting is kind of a way of life in this house. Only 11 months to go before I get to visit again."

567456,Guest,2007-07-16 11:37:00,0,"I've been trying to do both, Canada fly-in in summer, Gulf of Mexico in winter for Redfish and Spec Trout. I don't think I could take the heat of the Gulf in the summer on a boat for 12 hrs. a day. Redfish; think of catching a smallmouth bass on steriods. Plus they're good eating. Pound for pound, one of the fighting-est fish I've ever caught. A 6-7 lb Red will fight for 10 minutes to get it to the boat and once it sees the boat, it will run off 150-200 yds. of line and you start over. I've seen guys catch 12-20 lb.ers and they were exhausted by the time they boated the fish. The salt water fish seem to have a much higher survival instinct than fresh water. Both trips are starting to get expensive but so's life in general."

567396,Guest,2007-07-14 11:59:00,0,Canada is a vacation for my wife and I. And fishing is one great part of it. Any place you go will cost you some bucks. This is something we plan for all year just the same if I were going back to Scotland or any other vacation spot. So it is Canada again this sumer.

567397,Guest,2007-07-14 12:08:00,0,"I try to be flexible. NW Ontario in March is maybe not a good idea, so Florida presents lots of opportunity. I also go to Utah, Colorado, etc, during the summer, which is breathtaking in its own right. I tried ice fishing in January in Canada and nearly froze to death, so I think I'll likely forego that option in the future. It seems global warming has heated up the Canadian weather in the last few years, so that July up there seems a bit hot--or maybe I'm too heat averse with age. I have a traditon of going to the May opener in Ontario, and have been hit with snow the last two years. My next wish is to get to Alaska. With all the difficulties in travel to an interantional setting, a Canadian evening continues to be one of God's singular gifts."

567398,wooglin,2007-07-14 13:08:00,371,"You know, I was thinking a bit more about this. People have issues with the gas prices, yet some (yes, not all) smoke a pack a day. That's $4 a day in smokes. So, if you smoke one less pack per week for the next year, you just saved yourself 52 gallons of gas - so, gas costs ""could"" be fixed. Same goes for drinkers, one less bottle at the bar per week, your gas money ""could"" be fixed. Cut coupons for grocery shopping, I know I save well over $200 a year in coupons. How about 'Store Cards'? I use a Shell Gas Card and over two years, with the discounts I get, I've saved over $700. The options are unlimited, gas fluctuation should not be an issue (at least to me). As for the limits. I love to eat fish. I could eat it 5 days a week. But, I'll never complain about the limit I can bring back. 4 walleye, 4 northern are plenty for me. Why? Well, if it were any more than that, the fishery up there would probably get worse as time goes on and we'd all have one less place to fish down the line. Just some thoughts I guess."

567429,Guest,2007-07-14 15:08:00,0,don't come to Arkansas. The lakes are overcrowded and there aren't any fish. Skeeters are bad and the gators are plentiful. there is a cottonmouth on every limb and beer is always hot.
567430,Rat,2007-07-14 15:52:00,102,You got it Stringbean! The rest can quit moaning and go to Florida or wherever. Your son is right the paper mill is my weigh point as well.
567387,stevensinks,2007-07-14 07:39:00,330,The bag limit is just one of the reasons that I go to Canada. When Im picking a lake to go to I look for ones that only let you keep what you can eat. Heck if I want fish to eat at home Ill catch them at home.

567389,Guest,2007-07-14 07:47:00,0,"Fuel prices are causing me to change. No more one week fishing trips to Canada for me. I was on the water 16 days on my spring trip. My summer trip will find me on the water 13 days in August and I'll be back up yonder in October for two weeks or so. Maybe longer if fishing conditions are favorable. Driving along the north shore of Lake Superior in October is rewarding, even though it adds miles to my trip. So fewer trips for me, but I'll stay longer. Fishing camps are still a good deal in my opinion. Being in Tennessee I'll probably start testing Reelfoot Lake for crappies in March and November. I haven't fished the lake, but my friends tell me it's pretty super. Crappies are huge, the daily limit is 30 and possession limit is 60. The lake needs to be fished. It's no substitute for NW Ontario remote lakes, but what is?"

I live in Wisconsin and we have plenty of fish if I want a meal back home.We've never brought any back except for the occaisonal lake trout for smoking. We come to Canada for great fishing of course,but it is so much more than that.Serenity,awesome scenery,and pleasant people"

Crossing the border, not a problem unless you're armed to the teeth, you need to be prepared. Cost of fuel, you need to plan ahead, maybe a few less drinks at the local waterhole. Reduced bag limit, I don't believe there is a lake on earth that can sustain a fish population if you're gonna pull everything out of the lake. Going to Canada every summer is like the ""annual right of passage"". My son told me, the fun starts when you can smell the paper mill at International Falls."
