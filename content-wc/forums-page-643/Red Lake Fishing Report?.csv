567444,Terry Brand,2007-07-15 22:44:00,8,I just returned from the Ear Falls area about one hour south of there and the walleye were very fast at the lake I was on. I have been fishing Little Beaver Lodge and Woman River Fly-In Outposts for over 20 years. We fished Antenna Lake last week and even with poor weather we caught lots of walleye up to 23 inches. Lots of BIG pike also up to 43 inches. Antenna Lake is a fly-in lake operated by Doug and Gayle Gawley out of Ear Falls. Terry

Last time out, we caught 35 plus walleyes in 2 hours. Several in the 20 to 22 range and the largest was 24.5 inches. I hear Gullrock is amazing as well."

What I like about Red is I can find some fish and sit on then, throw a bouy out and not see another boat coming to fish the fish I found. Coming back from my cabin today I mark some fish (biggg fish) I didn't have any bait. I can't wait to see what tomorrow might bring."
