567320,jfrealty,2007-07-11 19:49:00,7,Is the water level normal or below? I'm hearing both?
567323,Guest,2007-07-11 21:02:00,0,You can check on the water level yourself by going to www.lwcb.ca and then clicking on Basin Data and then click on Lac Seul. You will get a pdf file that shows a graph of the elevation of Lac Seul. Follow the purple line for Goldpines which is the NW corner of Lac Seul.
567325,Guest,2007-07-11 21:21:00,0,looks to be normal to slightly above for this time of year. what a difference a month makes!
567335,Guest,2007-07-12 07:39:00,0,Wouldn't the water level be the same for the entire lake? How could it be low at one end of the lake and not the other?
567337,cruiseforever,2007-07-12 08:54:00,177,Wind. Large inflow of water. Look at the large lakes at the site. You will see a diffrence on most of them.
567366,Guest,2007-07-13 12:15:00,0,Just got back yesterday. The structure we fished last year was the same this year. From last year to this year (as of 7/07) I would say it is virtually the same.
567441,Guest,2007-07-15 18:40:00,0,"Uneven water level in a lake comes from a phenomenon called the seiche (saysh) effect. You have it on the Great Lakes all the time. I believe that Lake Erie is the worst because of the long east to west length. If the wind blows from the west the waves will pile up the water on the east end faster than it can flow away, thus raising the lake level on the east end. If there were no wind, no inflow, then the lake would be absolutely level."
