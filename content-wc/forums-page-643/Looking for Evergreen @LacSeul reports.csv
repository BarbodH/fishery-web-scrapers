567434,Guest,2007-07-14 19:41:00,0,Going to Evergreen at the end of July for 10 days with by boys ages 9 and 11 and my wife. This will be their first trip and I am really hoping to get all of them hooked for an annual trip. We will be fishing for Walleye and Pike. Any tips/pointers/info on the current bite would greatly be appreciated. Thanks in advance.You can post here or email me @ [email protected]
