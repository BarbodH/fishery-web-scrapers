566978,JackSalmon,2007-07-04 09:17:00,169,We are looking at trying to book our 2008 fishing trip --- just got back from this year's trip -- and we are looking at Camp Narrows Lodge on Rainy Lake. We are interested in a place where we can catch walleyes to eat with lots of smallmouth action. Anyone been to Camp Narrows Lodge? Would appreciate any information --- feel free to email me at [email protected] Thanks!
