566607,Guest,2007-06-23 11:12:00,0,We will be heading up to Wabaskang the last week of July and staying at Kingfisher. Has anyone been there lately? Any info as to what's happening there would be appreciated. Info; like what and where. We've been there a couple of times before but not with the new owners.

567399,wildernessgum,2007-07-14 13:21:00,19,I too am going to Wabaskang in the middle of August. Each week I go towww.peffleyscamp.com which is a resort at the north end of the lake. Each week he posts a fishing report. Gets you pumped up about going. Each Sunday/Monday a new report posts from the previous weeks fishing. Although would like reports from guys who have actually been up there this summer. Wildernessgum
