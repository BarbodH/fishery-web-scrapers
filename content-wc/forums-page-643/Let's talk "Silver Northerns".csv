Most people don't know have a clue about silver northern and when I talk about them they say ""must have been a muskie""! Drives me nuts. Then we talk number of ""holes"" under the jaw and the difference. Years ago I pulled in 24 and 26 lb silver northerns out of Ord Lake. Mounted one about 18 years ago (but yes we have been releasing big fish since then.) They are truly gorgeous when you first pull them out of the water - really irridescent - pinks, blues, goldish and silver. At that time the well known local taxidermist had never done one so tried to show pictures, description, etc but never could get it even close to what it looked like fresh. I guess that was another good reason to stop ""stuffing"" . It's been years since I caught one so could you refresh me on the number of ""pores "" compared to muskie, etc? ( not correct term but I'm sure you know what I'm referring to) thanks"
567067,Nimstug,2007-07-06 21:47:00,2605,"Jazz, I just rechecked my other post. I said I fished for them. I didn't say I caught any. :( As far as the pores go, a pike will have 5 or less on the underside of each jaw; a muskie will have 6 or more in the underside of each jaw. (A tiger muskie will have 5 or 6 or more under each jaw.) Silver's are not a sub-species of the pike but a mutation. They do not have the white bean shaped spots, which is probably why they are sometimes mistaken for muskie. Counting the jaw pores is the best way to identify if there is a question of pike or muskie. I wish I knew what offspring is produced when a silver mates with a regular pike. Maybe somebody knows. The only lake in the BWCA that has silver pike is Lake Disappointment and the record out of that lake is a little under 18 pounds. I found a website with a less than optimal picture of one if you want to take a look. http://www.hearnelakelodge.com/fishpictures.htm Hope that helps.

The hybrid offspring have a very bold chain pattern with lots of white and a dark green, similar to a chain pickerel but not quite the same; have caught several of these and they are quite remarkable looking."
567151,Jazzy Lu,2007-07-09 07:34:00,11,"I guess I should have should have made it known to ""someone"" about the size of the sivers I caught. My husband caught an 18 lb also at an earlier time. He kept saying they were record fish but having seen several 20 plus northern I figured they were really fun but not ""that"" special. We showed Wogenstahls one of them and all the snow birds staying in their big RVs saw them and the next day the ministry was at Ord Landing .Word traveled fast. Where are you from that they only get that big? Canada or do we have them in the states? The only lake I have found them in is Ord. That was about 1986 - 1999. Then we started going on fly ins and taking life easy in a cabin. Alot easier on the truck, boat and motor than going down old Ord road or April road bouncing and banging."

567160,Guest,2007-07-09 11:55:00,0,"There is a small lake north of Dryden (not Ord), that has silver northerns as well. Perhaps one out of fifteen or twenty will be a silver on this lake and they seem to average a little smaller than the typical northern. They are a very pretty fish and do in fact look like an small muskie. Cheers....IA Walleye"

567234,Trailerguy,2007-07-09 20:14:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I too have caught a few ""silver"" pike, from some small lakes that are far upstream in the Cedar River System, not directly connected and some 20 odd miles as a crow flys from Ord Lake. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
567341,lobo1,2007-07-12 12:18:00,734,they also have them in the Severn river system - we fished Favourable lake a few times and caught our share. I personally never saw one over 10 pounds but the camp owners tell stories of some quite large fish 20+ pounds from the past that were CPR. I may also buy into the theory of the mixed offspring having the brilliant chain markings because we caught many of these and they are just beautiful fish. we took a few pics of smaller silvers to bring home and show friends as we have never heard of them before those trips - really pretty cool with that silver and purple iridescent sheen. lobo1
