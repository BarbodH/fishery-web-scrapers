Thanks to Shane and his crew for running a great lodge and a special thanks to our Guide Basil for putting us on fish every day and the great shore lunchs. Our group of five (3 guys 2 gals) caught around 1300 Walleye with the biggest being 29"" and some nice Pike including a 39"" and a 38"". Lots of Walleye in the 21"" to 24"" range. Spent most of our time in Sen Bay, Bear Narrows and Grassy and fished mid lake humps. Seemed like we always had plenty of fish on the finder and the bite was strong despite the May Fly hatch the week before. Thanks again to the entire crew at Lost Island. Already booked again for next year. Mike Kansas"

We went to Lost Island Lodge in 1992, never went anyplace else on a Canadian trip except for a 25th anniversary trip to the Northwest Territories. We spent 2-3 weeks a year there for 13 years. The Hayes Family has grown up running top-notch camps, and it shows. It doesn't get any better. We look forward to getting up there again soon. Our son lives in Florida now, so our travel budget leans that way, but we miss our time in Cabin #6 dearly. Hello to all, Frank & Esther"
567245,Mike Kansas,2007-07-10 07:00:00,1463,"Dear orchard frank, Don't know if you remember that after I had emailed you and got your reply is when we decided to start going to Lost Island. Next year will be our groups third year there and out of the 80+ trips I have made to Canada fishing other Resorts Lost Island is as good as it gets. One day in the boat this year Basil and I talked about you. Basil said you and your wife are the salt of the earth. Basil said he would love to hear from you and I told him that I would pass his request on to you. Thanks for the heads up on Lost Island and Basil. Our whole group loves the trip and looks forward to it all year long. Mike Kansas"

Really looking forward to the trip as we've heard great things, but do you have any advice for the walleyes this time of year (good places to try, types of bait, depth). Thanks in advance, and have a great rest of the fishing season."
