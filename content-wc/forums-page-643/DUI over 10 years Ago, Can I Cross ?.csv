567268,Dacotah Eye,2007-07-10 15:13:00,2722,"If it is over 10 years old you may be ""deemed rehabilitated"". Be nice to the customs officers where you cross."
567270,Sutsgold,2007-07-10 15:57:00,219,"If it is your only DUI you are deemed rehabilitated. Remember, it is not the date of the DUI, but the conclusion of your sentence date which must be more than 10 years old. Anything from 5 to 10 years the border guard is given the discretion of letting you in or not. Be nice and truthful and it will not be an issue. Enjoy the trip."
