514408,Guest,2001-08-13 08:14:00,0,Just wanted to share the location of the best fishing I've ever had in Canada. Fishing in the Cedar River Watershed chain of lakes. I found the site in a brochure at a sportshow. It has good info and I found some great camps to stay at. I stayed at one of them but when I was up there I drove in to some of the others. There are some great accomodations. www.cedarriverwatershed.com
