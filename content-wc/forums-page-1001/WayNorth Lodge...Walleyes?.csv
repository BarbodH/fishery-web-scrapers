Just wondering if anyone has been there, how the walleye fishing is, what lakes they did best on, and what lure was the hottest. I will probably open up the onslaught with tots, they always ring the dinner bell. But just wanted to see if anyone had the skinny on what really turned them on.Thanks."

Jig in about 7 to 12 feet of water on the edge of the weeds and the reefs and points on Favourbale. On setting net, jig in and around the many islands and points. If you are northern fishing on setting net you will have tough time keeping the walleyes off of your pike baits. Two years ago it got to the point in August were we shook off the walleyes to get at the pike!!! Hope you have the same experience we had. Good luck."
