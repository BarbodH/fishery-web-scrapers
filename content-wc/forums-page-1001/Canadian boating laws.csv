514384,Guest,2001-08-10 12:51:00,0,"Please Note: The above page is for Canadian registered vessels with respect to saftey equipment discussions. Foreign vessels: (Assuming your boat is say registered in Ohio) must meet the safety regs for where the boat is registered. The page you want for this is: www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/facts/foreign.htm. It states; ""If your boat is registered or licensed outside Canada, then it must be fitted with the safety equipment required by your country while in Canadian waters"". However, you of course all local boating laws ""Once in Canadian waters, you must follow the rules (Canadian) that govern the safe operation of your vessel and protection of the environment"" So you do want to review the page from Mike's post for Canadian boating laws.When taking the boat in, bring (in addition to registration) , copies of the boat purchase/sale info."
