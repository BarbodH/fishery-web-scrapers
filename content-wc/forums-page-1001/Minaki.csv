514202,Guest,2001-08-01 15:50:00,0,"The water has come down about 8in as of monday.Try fishing the reefs in Big Sand early in the day, Bottom bouncers and lindy rigs will due just fine as for bait leechescrawlers and minnows will catch you plenty of fish.You can try pulling cranks also in the lake or by the bridge Reef Runners and shad raps work well. Good luck see you out there. Take a picture and let the big ones go!"
514207,Guest,2001-08-09 19:47:00,0,Any big ones being caught? Where? On what?
514203,Guest,2001-08-11 05:19:00,0,"Hey rivershark.I am heading up on the 16th. I have heard about pulling cranks under the bridge. Have you had any luck? Where to the north, south, or under? Any help would be great. I have never seen anyone pulling cranks there before, That is a new one to me. I do see a lot of boats under the bridge but they are always jigging. Thanks bill"
