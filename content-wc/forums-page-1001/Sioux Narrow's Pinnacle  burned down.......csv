514420,IaCraig,2001-08-13 10:36:00,434,If you are like us and buy leeches and license at the Pinnacle bait/tackle and gift shop in Sioux Narrows..... You'll need to make other plans. It burned down late one night around Aug 5th and all that is left is the chiminey :'( . I hope they were well insured and can rebuild. There are still other bait shops in Sioux Narrows and Nestor Falls so availability should not be a problem. Does anyone have any opinions on any of the other bait shops in the area??? IaCraig
514421,Zeek,2001-08-14 04:29:00,31,I think that Nestor Falls Bait & Tackle has been a nice store to deal with. It's the first one that you come to in Nestor Falls when you drive up from the south. They are open fairly early and seem to be real nice folks.
