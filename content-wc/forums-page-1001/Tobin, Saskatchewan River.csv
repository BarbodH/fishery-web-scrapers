514409,BillyBigFish,2001-08-13 09:11:00,31,"I am heading up to Nipawin Sept 23rd-27th. Any and all information would be much apreciated. I have been there 3 years running but, I have never been there that early before."
514410,Guest,2001-08-13 10:28:00,0,"Be prepared for a very busy body of water.The Vanity cup is the last weekend of sept and i know there will be a ton of teams out prefishing that week including myself. $50,000 first place i have heard it's full but dont know for sure.Good luckCDNWalleye"
514411,Guest,2001-08-14 00:09:00,0,"Yep water should be moving fast... just do the normal current drift with rigs and a leach.. by Eagles nest, #1 rock or grassy islands and u will do FINE.... its big fish season.."
514412,Guest,2001-08-14 00:11:00,0,"Vanity is full... still some room left in Pine Falls though.. Huge green backs there.. $50,000 1st palce purse..."
514414,BillyBigFish,2001-08-14 08:40:00,31,"Well it sounds like nothing new. I am hoping this year to finally get a big one. The last few years I have been the guy who catch's everything from Suckers to Pike and many, many eye's.The only problem is the biggest one I have caught has only been 29.5 and 9 lbs. The rest of my party has caught 10 lb+ fish every year. I am hoping this is my year.I hope we miss some of the prefish fishermen!Good Luck to you all"
514415,BillyBigFish,2001-08-14 08:44:00,31,"I was also wondering if you know of any size changes for the Big Eyes?I heard a trophy must be 32"" now, is this true? Last year it was something like 28""!"
514413,Guest,2001-08-14 09:20:00,0,I just spoke with Jim at the Kingfisher and he stated there are lots of openings for the Vanity!Will
514416,Firetiger(MN),2001-08-14 10:36:00,97,"80 cm (31.5"") is the cut-off this year."
514417,Guest,2001-08-14 22:36:00,0,"Hey there, this could be your year! I was just up there for the Premier's cup, and there were lots of big fish being taken. Our biggest was 7.2, but of course the rules are none over 55CM at the Premier's. Randy Olson took a 34 inch 16 pound plus eye. The slot this year is 55-80 CM, but Jim announced at the Premier's that the vanity will get a reprieve (at least for this season) and the slot will be the same as last year, 55-70 CM.Pikeman"
514418,BillyBigFish,2001-08-15 09:39:00,31,"I hope you are right. I also hope the bite is not to good yet. We still have 5 weeks before we go so, maybe the bigguns will wait for me.For all you vanity cup guys. Please wait until thursday to prefish. I really need this trip to give me a BIG EYE! Just joshin.Good luck to all and may the BIG EYE's bite."
