It ends up costing too much, with very little success with the fishing. I need a real fishing trip, would anyone in southern ontario/mich/ohio want to do a fly-in at the end of may next year? Thinking sakatchewan/manitoba. Need someone else to split on the cost, would drive my truck anywhere."

514396,Peanut,2001-08-13 08:27:00,929,"Hey Hunter, if you decide Saskatchewan is your choice destination, I'd be happy to talk about meeting you for a trip.While a fly-in would be great, in Sask. there are dozens of lodges/camps that you can drive to with awsome fishing, without the fly-in cost. If you're thinking of spring, think late May at the earliest, early-mid June even better. The water in Northern Sask. warms slower, ice can still be around on the May long weekend. So, if you're at all interested in a drive-to camp, let's chat. We've got all winter to plan.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
