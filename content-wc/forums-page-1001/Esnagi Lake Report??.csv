514364,Guest,2001-08-10 15:51:00,0,"I got back on Sunday. We did great! My son and I caught over 250 walleyes and about 20 northerns in 3 days. My son caught the fish of his life: a 30.75"" walleye. I think I was more excited than he was. I was so glad that he caught it and I didn't. You know you have a good fishing partner when you are happier than he is when you catch a big fish. We caught most of them on a jig and a leech,in 8 to 20'. We didn't have ideal weather there was to much sun. We did the best in morning and evening, although the far north end of lake has good green water color. We caught fish in 8' in the middle of the day up there. We had an uninvited guest at one of our shore lunches. I just got done filleting the fish and I was frying some potatoes. My 13 year old son said heard something in the woods so he took the fillet knife and said ""I'll check it out Dad"". He took about two steps around the first tree and came running back out and said we gotta get in boat because there's a bear in there. So we got in the boat and floated off a little bit and watched as the bear ate our fish carcases. Then we took a few pictures of him. After that we made lot noise and scared him off, then we gathered our things on shore and went to a different spot for lunch, on an island. Rog"

We have had one in the camp by the cabin a few times. Great to hear your boy got a great fish. Where did you get your leachs? How far up the north end were you fishing. John"
