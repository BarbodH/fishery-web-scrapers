514336,Guest,2001-08-11 13:21:00,0,"Jeff- I have suggested the same thing. I think divorce would be in the future. I also tell her that there is a sign when entering Canada""No women allowed"". Yes, I am from Iowa and don't even fish here, just not the same. I occasionally fish Whitefish, near Hayward, Wisc. My sister has a place there. Seems like a tough lake to fish.Have a good one."
514337,Guest,2001-08-11 20:28:00,0,"We regularly fish Red Lake, but have not ventured into Keg or Gull Rock. We plan to go to both lakes this year (2nd week of September).Where is this ""sunken Island"" you speak of in Gullrock? Sounds like a pretty good spot. Thanks."
514338,Guest,2001-08-12 09:13:00,0,The sunken island is about approx 2 miles to the NE from the exit from the channel leading from Keg. If you head for the series of islands and keep your locator on you should find it. The sunken island is only maybe a 100yards in diameter if that.Jeff
514326,jeff,2001-08-07 17:29:00,99,Am planning a trip next year to Gullrock lake from mid July to mid August. Any suggestions as to which week would work out the best?ThanksJeff
514327,Guest,2001-08-07 18:36:00,0,Did you receive my e-mail? If not try [email protected]
514328,Guest,2001-08-08 10:54:00,0,No I am afraid I did not. Could you answer me here.ThanksJeff
514329,Guest,2001-08-08 14:16:00,0,"Jeff- I have gone to Gull Rock several times the first week of August and it varies. Last week was fairly nice, with a high around 85 acouple of days. Flannel shirts in the morning, shorts in the p.m. A couple of years, we were wearing shirt, flannel and coat and the lows were in the 30's at night, so it all depends.Last week was pretty good fishing wise, but they were in 30-38ft of water. We normally use spinners, but they were hitting on Lindy rigs or small hooks with just one bead. Birch and Burnt were productive. Alot of fisherman on the sunken island as well.Next year I am going June 22, because that is when my son can go. I have been there at that time before and once was real good , another time hit the mayfly hatch"
514330,Guest,2001-08-08 19:12:00,0,"JohnThanks for the information. The week before that we were in 12-20 ft of water with 3/8 oz green jigs. The fishing was fast the last few days with many fish boated. Actually the northwest corner of the sunken island was our hot spot. We did well on burnt, the island leading into Keg, the islands southeast of the sunken, and Keg. I think I will try a week earlier in July next year. This will be my fourth trip next year. Starting to learn the lake better. Was disappointed though did not land a fish over 24 inches. Had many in the 22-24 range.Did you get any bitter fish?ThanksJeff"
514331,Guest,2001-08-09 06:21:00,0,The biggest walleye was 25. Several 23-22-21 etc. Keg was slow for us. some off the green buoy.
514332,hgf,2001-08-09 18:56:00,199,"Fished there two days last weekend. Lots of eyes on sunken island, and north of island. some at 13 feet when water was choppy, then at 22-24 feet when still. Hotter than h"""""""". Also caught two northerns, 34 and 36 inches, all within one hour. One grabbed my walleye, would not let go, and second one trolling on a risto rap. Terrific fishing most summer according to several other friends who where there. I fished Eagle Lake two days same trip, with zippo results. Don't hesitate to go to Gull Rock, even when it is hot. Only complaint is I paid 124 bucks for two nights of camping, boat docking, and 4 dozen minnows. Seemed a little steep to me."
514333,Guest,2001-08-10 08:54:00,0,Where did you camp?
514334,hgf,2001-08-11 07:26:00,199,"McEwens Northern Shores. Really nice place, and people, but I thought price was steep."
514335,Guest,2001-08-11 08:58:00,0,Hello JohnThanks for your response. There must not be many people who look at this site and fish Gullrock. I confirmed my reservation with the camp for the week of July 13th next year. This is a week earlier for us. I suspect the fish will probalbly be in these summer patterns by then. I am sure looking forward to it.I kid my wife that we should move to Canada and own a camp. I don't think she is quite interested yet. I will keep working on her. Based on your email address I would guess you are from Iowa. I myself am from Waukesha Wi. we walleye fish on Lake Winnebago alot but it is not the same as Canada.Have a great yearJeff
