6715381,Fishquest,2023-02-17 06:05:00,89,I can't comment on the food at lodge as I've never stayed there but you won't see alot of boats as they are the only lodge on the lake and there are a total of 4 other outposts on camp and more more on a connecting lake. Its a huge body of water with a ton of places to fish you'll probobly find a lot of the lodge boats all fish the same spots close to camp but if your willing to get out and explore you'll find fish everywhere on the lake. I've been there twice and of all the outpost camps on the lake we were the only ones staying in one so the only other boats were Leuenberger boats.

Besides, 9 years is too long for it to be relevant anyway. There are 3 outposts and the lodge on Kag. There is also an outpost on Van Poele Lake that offers access to Kag and another about 4 miles from the lodge up the Opichuan. That seems like a lot, but Kag is a fairly substantial body of water (~20,000 acres). When we were there, there was nobody at the Mattice Lake camp (the one closest to the lodge - no longer operated by Mattice, now Boreal Forest). So, I assume you may see other lodge guests and those staying at that nearby outpost camp more often than from the other camps. Also depends on where you go to fish. If you go to Humble Bay, sure, you may come across a boat or two. In general, I don't recall seeing many other boats when we fished. It was really windy that week though, one of the worst trips for wind that I have experienced. The wind blew all day and night...never calmed down. Still, it wasn't so bad you could not get out on to the lake. Just not very comfortable for long boat rides. The furthest we ventured was the outflow from Van Poele (fantastic fishing btw, but not a big spot) and part way up the Opichuan (some sections got quite shallow). It is at least a 30 minute boat ride (7 miles, ~15MPH) from the lodge to the inflow at the south end and a similar distance to the entrance to Humble Bay. If you are going early in the season when the fish are more concentrated (and the camps likely more booked up), sure, you will probably see other boats fishing the inflows for walleye. That goes for any lake with a lodge or more than one camp on it. Personally, I am not a fan of fishing next to a bunch of boats. If I see that, I move to another spot. There will always be other good spots. Especially on a lake the size of Kag. It was nothing like I experienced on other lakes with multiple camps - Nagagami, Kabinakagami and Obakamiga. Those weren't terrible, but definitely much busier and not places I would recommend if you prioritize solitude. So, will you see other boats? Very likely, but I do not think it will be very frequent. It will also be highly dependent on how booked the camps are/when you go (and what you target). I imagine that the outpost near the lodge is not that popular (could be wrong), because I assume people going to outposts probably prefer the solitude. The other outpost camps are far enough away that it will be much less of an issue. The Twin Lakes camps near Humble are very popular and there is no real reason for them to venture too far - walleye, pike, lakers are all reasonably close by."

6715659,Psrome,2023-02-18 05:19:00,3,We have not made a decision on a camp yet. We're still researching.
