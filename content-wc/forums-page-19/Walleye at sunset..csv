6714837,rosh1,2023-02-15 12:08:00,275,Lime Thanks for the video . Makes me miss it up there more. Cant make ice season this year just had shoulder fixed and my wife says no. Hope to run into you again and b.s. like we did at bank last summer. Keep them coming.
6714843,Eckohlt,2023-02-15 12:18:00,3685,"If you wear the right clothing,the cold is your least problem.Getting the fish to bite is what you want to wry about,specially if it's on the menu that night!"
6715305,Limeyangler,2023-02-16 17:51:00,563,"Lol the line at the bank went quick! Sorry about your shoulder, I messed mine up 2 years ago, casting for musky all day, and on top of that I have nerve pinched and carpal too, sucks getting old, it hurts just typing after just an hour with the snowblower this afternoon. Next time you make it up we could do coffee or fish or both, just drop me a line on here."
6715309,Eckohlt,2023-02-16 18:06:00,3685,How old are you???

6715341,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-16 19:47:00,8293,Looks like you had a good time. I have about zero interest in ice fishing but I understand how some guys like it. Do you find filming easier in the summer or winter?
6715425,rosh1,2023-02-17 07:15:00,275,"Lime ,Will do. Coming up around may 1. That gives us some time to get things ready for opening. Can't wait. Hope to meet up."
6715443,Limeyangler,2023-02-17 08:18:00,563,"Definitely easier filming when it's warm only because the GoPro batteries start to crap out when it gets below -10C. It's ok in your pop up or flip over shelters but I prefer to be outside if possible, -15C is fine as long as there is no wind, but sometimes the urge to fish outweighs my need for comfort..lol"
6713155,Limeyangler,2023-02-09 08:46:00,563,"Hi all, Got out for some walleye yesterday afternoon, not much happened for 3 hours until a brief window of opportunity opened as the sun hit the tree line, beautiful sunny day, only around -3C and despite a fairly stiff wind I was well sheltered on my chosen spot. Bite lasted 20 minutes or so before it switched off *** quickly as it started.https://youtu.be/1VGjzpRjIaQ"

6714345,Limeyangler,2023-02-13 17:02:00,563,"The snowmobile ride is definitely part of the fun, lol the fishing was so slow up till sunset I was thinking it would be the highlight of the afternoon!"
