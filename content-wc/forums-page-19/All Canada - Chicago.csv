6713749,Sylvanboat,2023-02-11 11:27:00,94,My son and I go to NW Ontario each year. I book the following year after each trip. I pay for the trip. Whatever it costs is irrelevant to me. My son and I get together.
6713755,pjshorthorn,2023-02-11 11:37:00,5654,Do you need a stepson to go along too ? PjShorthorn

6711459,Obabikon,2023-02-03 07:13:00,2370,"Kane County fairgrounds was great last night. It was my first time at the facility, and I really thought they did a great job. Very well attended. Come see us this weekend. The show hours are.... Friday 3-9 Saturday 10-6 Sunday 10-4"
6711473,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-03 07:47:00,8293,Morning Jared. Just curious have you always done the show circuit? I know I met you at the Mpls show one year. Have the guests bounced back after the Covid years or are there more openings hence why you are doing the shows? I'm kind of curious how your industry up there in Canada is bouncing back.
6711485,RichA$1970,2023-02-03 08:03:00,1159,"I went to the show and compared to Milwaukee, Kane County Fairgrounds was a dump and not well laid out as it was split in 2 buildings. I hope they did not charge the outfitters much and it was good to see a lot of camps there."
6711509,Obabikon,2023-02-03 08:55:00,2370,"Business is looking good for this year. I would say that right now, bookings are on pace for a similar total guests as 2019 (maybe even a little higher). Shows are being well attended, and things are looking positive for trips to Canada. Sticker shock... I do want to address this. Many resorts honored their 2020 prices last year in 2022. However, most places raised prices substantially. Basically, the resorts didn't raise prices for 3 years, and inflation is costing them more. So, be prepared to pay 10-15% more (maybe even higher) than you did in 2019. All that said, I think people are just ready to have some fun. We only have a certain amount of time in our lives, and I think we all feel like we've lost too much of it already. People are ready to go! So, to your question, and the question many people are curious about. Is the industry bouncing back? The real question is probably: are resorts going under or will they bounce back? The reality is... I don't know. Many resorts will be fine (including Obabikon). Many of the government loans are going to start being ""due"" in December of this year. If you weren't an established resort, or you just purchased the resort recently... you will now have to basically make 2 mortgage payments this year. We will know more about survival rates in the next two years. There's so many variables. I will say, some will go under, and many will survive... things probably won't be ""back to normal"" until the fall of 2025. My suggestion... go support your favorite lodge owners. Know that prices are higher, but many places won't be out of the woods for several years. It's looking good this year, but there's so many variables that influence the entire ""industry"". The #1 is support, and that's looking GREAT this year!"
6711511,Obabikon,2023-02-03 09:02:00,2370,"I don't care for the parking situation. Unfortunately, with Pheasant Run no longer in existence, a new location was needed. I actually enjoyed the ""split"" for a couple of reasons. There was a little more room than the old venue, so more resorts were allowed to attend. The other benefit with being split was to prevent being jam packed. It opened up the isles a little more, and allowed us to talk to more people during the peak time periods. I did hear great things about the Milwaukee show, and I am adding it to the list for next year. As far as Obabikon doing shows... for several years, I have done just 3 shows. Green Bay, Chicago, and the Minneapolis NW Sportshow. In 2024, I'll be adding that Milwaukee show. I find it a great way to connect with old guests. I do not go to the shows with the expectations of booking 50 new guests. That's not the way they work anymore. I go to them with the intention of getting OUR regular guests pumped up and on the books. If we add a few new reservations, even better."
6711527,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-03 09:31:00,8293,Thank you for taking the time to respond. Hopefully I'll be able to book a trip with you soon.
6711545,[emailÂ protected],2023-02-03 10:39:00,6,Was hoping to make it down there this year. Always next year I guess say hi to Doug for me over at the North Star booth cheers
6711791,coldtuna,2023-02-04 08:28:00,25,"My son and I went to the show on Thursday night. Lots of people there. We heard from several lodges that the traffic at their booths was good and lots of interest in summer trips. There were probably not as many operators there as there were pre-Covid, but it was still great to be at the show again and talking fishing with different lodges and providers. The venue is not as nice as Pheasant Run in my view, but just happy that they held the show again."
6712359,krazyk711,2023-02-06 09:34:00,26,It was a long haul for us southsiders ! I was disappointed that alot of the far north resorts didn't attend. Said a few hellos and was done in an hour. I had a free ticket which is the only reason I went in the first place. I wish they would start using the tinley convention center its big and has alot to offer in the area for dining .
6712911,Lip_Yanker,2023-02-08 13:17:00,116,"I was out of town for the weekend, but when I got home late Sunday, the All Canada Show paper was in my mailbox. I'm sure it was delivered Saturday, so either they need to mail them out sooner, or the Postal service is way behind. Maybe next year, as said by every Chicago sports fan ever."
