6716463,v-bay gord,2023-02-21 19:45:00,3168,"Have you two ever heard of ""email"". It's like sending notes to each other but you do it on your computer..... ...and nobody sees it!"
6716479,prov1800,2023-02-22 06:13:00,5010,Sorry to see that our posting bothers you Gord.I can only suggest not to open them if you see our names attached.
6716485,Eckohlt,2023-02-22 06:34:00,3685,"I've heard of emails and I just checked into it,that's some hi-tech stuff,setting up account n password that's not the route to go for me.Everything I need to get done in life is right through WC,no better place in the world to be,other than vermillion bay from what I understand,looking forward to fishing eagle n VB in the future,I've learned a lot on WC even how to BS,but the greatest thing I ever learned in life was not in school,my father taught me how to tie a jig on."
6716499,HeHooksHimself,2023-02-22 07:32:00,725,"Gord, as usual, perhaps you better check your own WC posts before you speak. We have learned and awful lot about you (flamingo flocks, yoga pants, your stance on vaxes, etc.) through your intimate conversations with Pat. I, for one, have enjoyed the banter. Fish On! Hooks"
