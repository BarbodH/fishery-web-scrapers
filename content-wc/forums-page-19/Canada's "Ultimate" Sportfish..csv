6717159,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 14:16:00,3685,Found plumtree lake that's a pretty good hike up there.
6717203,Moosebunk,2023-02-24 17:43:00,211,"Thanks as always Adam. And yes, Nunavut should be recruiting me for their retention and recruitment committee... In fact, for a short time I chaired one of those in Ontario after whining and proving that HR was doing a shiznitty job at it. lol. You'll get your dumb log yet. lol"
6717205,Moosebunk,2023-02-24 17:52:00,211,"See, that's one of the things you can appreciate. They allow for all these windows of time to get them. A little more shallow time would be fun though.Quote: Originally Posted by EckohltOctober when they come up shallow to make little lakers,that's another time to get them shallow,there on the reefs.There are plenty of places they will do this in September and, here and there are stocked lakes that remain open all year.

Guessing herring or maybe smelt? In the higher arctic the fish are always shallower, like up on Great Bear, and anytime in the season one could maybe witness lakers busting bait near surface like this. Why not eh? So many other fish fresh and saltwater do the same. Lakes with both pike and lakers make for a nice mix."

6717315,dragger,2023-02-25 09:28:00,66,Had a one greatest day on a day fly out on Athabasca. Had 3 of us in a boat so I took an offshore planer board so we could troll 3 lines without tangling. Boated 5 lakers over 40 with a 45 the biggest. Three times a laker came up to hit the yellow planer board and took it under. The size and power of those giants was really amazing.
6717591,kona77,2023-02-26 09:19:00,236,"Three times a laker came up to hit the yellow planer board and took it under. Now that is the best definition of an ""agressive fish"" that I have ever seen or read about. Athabasca has been one of my dream destinations. Should just suck it up and make it happen."
6717653,dhottle,2023-02-26 10:55:00,163,I have been up to Lakers Unlimited camp about a dozen time & yes you need to go. It has more 20-40 lb lakers than you can imagine. The lakers are so aggressive we used to run musky baits in the prop wash bubble trail & they would come up & destroy them. Also great pike fishing.
6717889,jambi,2023-02-27 08:45:00,504,"Not sure what the lakers had pushed to the surface. The bait they were feeding on were very small - at least the ones that we could spot. After using our spoons to catch the first couple, we switched to our lighter gear with 7cm flicker shad. Alot more fun on the lighter gear. This lake is 8 miles long and not very wide (Pine Needle Lake - via Showalter's)"
6716985,DeBo,2023-02-24 07:36:00,211,"That was a fun read. Caught my first laker in late ‘21 from Superior and my first Canadian lakers last summer. Really a fun fish. Huge size potential, great fight, relatively wide variety of presentations. I only wish they were available shallow more often.As always thanks for the great read Bunk!"
6716991,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 07:43:00,3685,"October when they come up shallow to make little lakers,that's another time to get them shallow,there on the reefs."
6717067,kona77,2023-02-24 10:43:00,236,"Love the Laker ""twirl"" as we always call it when they are coming up to the boat and they just go around/around in circles. On our trip to northern MB. there was a creek just up from our cabin and we could catch lakers right from shore on walleye rods and various crankbaits. Now that was fun.."
6717107,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 12:19:00,3685,"That's something I would have really enjoyed,Kona you ready to go back there??"
6717119,guidedfishing,2023-02-24 12:35:00,531,"Nothing like a Laker on a medium walleye rod. A lot of years past now, but my son's first decent size laker he hooked into when he was 12yrs old vertical jigging in 60ft of water. About 20 mins later we landed a 38 1/2 brute. By the time he got it in his legs and arms were just shaking from the physical battle. After a quick picture and release he was so exhausted he just sat in the boat for about 15mins with the biggest smile and rubbery legs and arms."
6717131,jambi,2023-02-24 13:05:00,504,"I fished an outpost that didnt hold walleye just pike and lake trout. My Dad and I really did well on the pike. I had a few trout spots marked on the map but Dad didnt want to mess with them. One morning we were headed to end of the lake, approaching some narrows, (which had been marked as a trout spot). The water was calm. As I scouted ahead of the boat I thought I had seen a small swirl or splash of something surfacing. I dropped to an idle; Dad asked what the heck I was doing and I told him what I saw. He gave me the old line ""Quit messing around there is nothing out here"" Another swirl ahead. I fired off a shallow running spoon. Wham...Lake Trout on. Dad fired off his Daredevle... Trout on. We casted all around the boat for a few hours and the trout were everywhere. Not big - 3# maybe a 4.5# tops. We had a whoot of a time. Those trout had pushed small bait to the surface and the whole narrows was loaded. Repeated the next morning. Good times; better memories."
6717139,v-bay gord,2023-02-24 13:33:00,3168,"Targeting trout during a ""closed season"" would be frowned upon by the MNR. Lake trout closes October 1."
6717143,v-bay gord,2023-02-24 13:35:00,3168,That's the quote I was referring to...
6717147,kona77,2023-02-24 13:56:00,236,"That's something I would have really enjoyed,Kona you ready to go back there?? Eckholt- It was Plumtree Lake and besides the Lakers it had the best average size walleye's we have experienced in over 30 years of going to Canada. The only issue was on-going problems with the outfitter (and I am talking some major issues with motors etc).. We finally had enough and switched to NW Ontario."
6717151,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 14:04:00,3685,"You are correct,I've caught them fishing for smallie in late fall on the reefs,back they go,Manitoba I believe has diff regs for lakers."
6716627,Moosebunk,2023-02-22 16:43:00,211,"Capable of reaching over 100 pounds it is one of the largest freshwater fish in Canada Truth! Delicious and readily available, it's a food source for many anglers and fish harvesters. A powerful, sporting quarry which requires many different and refined angling tactics to catch. The most widely distributed fish found in all Provinces & Territories except P.E.I. But why does that little one even exist anyways? Year round angling opportunities, wild or stocked fish provide endless days for fishing.There is no other than the ***** to lay claim for all these amazing attributes. "" ***** ""are by far the greatest prize to fishing this country has to offer, and so YEP, they are the ""ultimate!"" . Only an ""opinion"" article if you will... read on if interested..? https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/canada...te-sport-fish/Bunk!"
6716651,kona77,2023-02-22 20:09:00,236,"I love fishing for Lake Trout but have not taken the time/money to go fish for truly giant lakers in Northern Manitoba, NWT etc. We did use an outfitter north of Lynn Lake, MB and fished a lake where we could catch 15-20 in a day but only a handful were over 10lbs. Catching 3-5lb lakers though is a blast and I have always wanted to have a chance to catch 20+lb laker. Man they are strong fighting fish. I fish Lake Michigan here in Wisconsin and that is where the Laker's are known as ""greasers"" and are best smoked. I will say those 3-5lb lake trout in MB were absolutely delicious and we ate them even more than walleye's (which is saying something for our group)."
6716703,Moosebunk,2023-02-23 07:16:00,211,"Agreed Kona! With both travel and a little guiding in the NWT, luckily had the chance to eat lake trout countless ways. Like, when guiding groups with other guides who were far better with shorelunches than I'll ever be, we could have lake trout lunch spreads that included fish cooked 5,6,7 different ways. For instance, one day I remember specifically we had fish tacos and two guides had prepared fresh fixing the night before, a Hawaiian baker laker with deep fried pineapple donuts, beer battered fried laker tossed in maple syrup. But we'd honestly do them dozens of different ways having to cook and eat them every day for shorelunches. Didn't matter which way either, from straight up plain, sashimi (for some) or cooked in any fancy way it was all incredible. And I LOVE walleye and especially crappie and arctic char, but pristine lake trout from much of Canada's waters is delicious. Can't say I care much for those out of Lake Ontario, more populated areas with stocked lakers or heavily boated waters though. Just not the same."
6716707,NM_Trout,2023-02-23 07:27:00,1094,I had a trip booked with Dalton Trail lodge for 2020. I specifically was targetting lakers. Covid crashed that party :-(
6716711,HeHooksHimself,2023-02-23 07:43:00,725,"My most memorable Canadian fishing experience was pulling up a 40 inch brute in May of 2017. Caught it trolling an x-rap in about 16 ft. water. A solid 20 minutes to get her in the net and a picture and back in the drink. Measured it but didn]t weigh it. I think it was about 30 lbs. I will never forget it. Shallow Lake Trout fishing is why we always book late May/early June. If I wasn't so technically challenged I would include the picture, but if you want, you can see it here.https://www.facebook.com/winelakecam...6597851883312/ The photo is on the Wine Lake Camp facebook page posted on March 7 2019 Fish On!

Great catch! And yes, when the season is right for getting them shallow it's incredible fun wrestling brutes on lighter tackle."
6716887,Moosebunk,2023-02-23 19:30:00,211,"For the money you could probably do better for laketrout fisheries however, the Yukon is one helluva beautiful place to visit. Time to rebook, it's that simple! lol"

Largest one taken there was 54 inches, but several a year over 40 inches now every year. However, I have lived vicariously through your posts for a few years! Keep it coming Moosebunk!Hooks"
6716951,adempsey2.0,2023-02-24 06:06:00,611,"Lakers are just dumb floating logs I have yet to catch a behemoth though. Definitely will head over to MB, SK or hopefully NWT or Nunavut one of these days. It's a must do for this 'dumb bag of mostly water' before I kick it. Enjoy your stories and photos as usual Mr. Bunk! You should be the poster boy for getting more healthcare workers up north."
