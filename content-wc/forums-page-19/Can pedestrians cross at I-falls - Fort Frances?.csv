6718351,Riverkeg,2023-02-28 11:17:00,134,"One of my June trip crew can’t make the drive with us so he’s planning to fly into I-Falls. If he can get a taxi to the bridge, can he walk across so I can pick him up in Fort Frances?"
6718367,x4flatfish,2023-02-28 11:45:00,319,Yup
6718371,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-28 11:55:00,8293,Yes but he should call and talk to the guy at City Cab. I'm sure he would just drive him across.
6718401,Riverkeg,2023-02-28 12:56:00,134,Yes! The Clark’s shared his info with me. We’re also going to explore options to get him all the way to Cedar Lake so I don’t have to drive back down to Fort Frances to get him.
6718407,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-28 13:07:00,8293,What date is he coming in? I live in town and maybe can help out.
6718433,Riverkeg,2023-02-28 13:33:00,134,June 11th. He’s trying to resolve his June 10th conflict so we can avoid all of this but we want to have a backup plan (or two).
6718437,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-28 13:38:00,8293,If you get stuck let me know. I'll shoot you a PM with my phone number.

Once they crossed we dropped her off at her place in Ft Frances, but it was hilarious seeing them do the walk of shame across the bridge at 0630 and I think Fred was still drunk."
6718593,Eckohlt,2023-03-01 05:59:00,3685,I bet she was a piece of work!!maybe Fred's blind and it didn't matter.
6718635,RichA$1970,2023-03-01 08:01:00,1159,"I’m not sure if they use Lot Lizards as term in Intl Falls, but she found a sucker in Fred. Funny thing was when they walked across she had 2 cartons of smokes and she made Fred hold one to avoid duty taxes. He is truly a gentleman."
