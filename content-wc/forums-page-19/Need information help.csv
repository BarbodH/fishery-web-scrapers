We always did a Fly In but getting priced out with just 2 people so we thought we would try a drive to resort. ANY information about the location and the Wingo Resort would be GREATLY appreciated Thank You Dave"

6718133,Skywagon,2023-02-28 04:30:00,1106,Maybe you are talking about their outpost camp on Vaughan Lake which is part of Lac Seul? Their main lodge is on Minnitaki lake.
6718209,eyecatcher1,2023-02-28 07:31:00,323,They have cabins on an island on Abram Lake as well as on shore there. You can get to Lac Seul by boat if the water is high enough or trailer you boat to Deception Landing. If it's your first time I'd hire a guide for at least the first day. Great fishing anywhere there.

Their main camp is on Abram Lake. Nice that we can go to Sioux Lookout pretty quick for groceries, beer, etc. Cabins are awesome and so are the boats. Oh, and the fishing!"
6718313,prov1800,2023-02-28 10:14:00,5010,If you want to fish Lac Suel and staying at Winoga you will have to trailer your boat to either Deception Bay few miles up the road or travell to Hudson and launch there.There is a IF.If water high you can go for a exciting ride through Pelican Falls.Can get there from Abram.Not to bad in higher water.
