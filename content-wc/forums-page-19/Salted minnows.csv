6718055,Eckohlt,2023-02-27 16:46:00,3685,Went for a swim!
6717261,RichA$1970,2023-02-25 06:43:00,1159,"Wow, now I’m learning about biology & the English language as I’ve never heard of that word. I only used gullet or if jigging popping an eyeball off a fish on the stringer if needed."
6717269,prov1800,2023-02-25 07:03:00,5010,Interesting.thx
6717277,Eckohlt,2023-02-25 07:49:00,3685,Probably shouldn't have to resort to using to much of that crap for bait.
6717281,Laketripper,2023-02-25 07:52:00,103,When Walleye offal is deep fried in lard it doesn't taste so offal.
6717291,Eckohlt,2023-02-25 08:19:00,3685,"Lol,along with alittle tarter on it might help also."
6717311,prov1800,2023-02-25 09:20:00,5010,I'll just stick to the gullets
6717381,Eckohlt,2023-02-25 15:33:00,3685,"You need a bigger cutting board,or smaller fish,those nuggets look tasty!"
6717387,walleyecheek,2023-02-25 15:38:00,2231,"looks like about a 17"" er"
6717393,Eckohlt,2023-02-25 16:04:00,3685,"The picture cut the tail off,I'll go 18incher"
6718049,walleyecheek,2023-02-27 16:30:00,2231,where did swimbaits go ?
6717201,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 17:41:00,3685,"Wonder what color licorice to salt,,,,red or blk,gotta few months to think about it.maybe both,they might hit red on cloudy days n blk on sunny days."
6717207,prov1800,2023-02-24 18:07:00,5010,yes
6717209,prov1800,2023-02-24 18:09:00,5010,If it's Canadian salt we are good to go.I think I'd go with black might look like a leech and could shave it thinner to give it better movement.
6717211,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 18:19:00,3685,"Good thinking,use red for smallies,crayfish have alittle reddish orange on them"
6717217,Bill Krejca,2023-02-24 18:30:00,6107,"The last time I looked, offal was legal in Ontario, not always the case, as I remember. This can differ with the provinces, it used to be the go-to bait in Saskatchewan, live bait (minnows) not being legal. It make a heck of a lake trout bait. Bill"
6717225,prov1800,2023-02-24 18:58:00,5010,Could work.
6717227,prov1800,2023-02-24 19:01:00,5010,Bill what is offal.
6717245,Eckohlt,2023-02-25 04:57:00,3685,"I'm not Bill,organ meats"
6717249,prov1800,2023-02-25 05:43:00,5010,Thx.thought it was a typo error.lol.Tried that to.Bacon strips also pretty good.
6717257,CI_Guy,2023-02-25 06:20:00,2118,"It's not just the organs. It's everything that's discarded when you clean the fish. Of·fal /ˈôf(ə)l/ noun 1. the entrails and internal organs of an animal used as food: ""eating pieces of braised offal turned his stomach"""
6717015,Larry S,2023-02-24 08:48:00,665,Any bait shop towards Ignace Via Thunder bay to buy salted minnows? Larry S
6717029,Lovetofish,2023-02-24 09:14:00,458,"I made salted minnows for years they work great, I wish I could still bring them. For your portage trip in July, maybe pick up a flat of crawlers instead. You'll catch plenty using scented plastics too."
6717035,prov1800,2023-02-24 09:20:00,5010,If you clean a few walleye to eat Larry take out the gullets and use them for bait.You won't need any salted minnows.Freeze the spare gullets and make sure the one your using comes off when your done.
6717039,Lovetofish,2023-02-24 09:23:00,458,I use gullets as well.
6717083,Bill Krejca,2023-02-24 11:12:00,6107,Gullets can be a go-to bait. Use with a dressed jig or alone. Bill
6717109,guidedfishing,2023-02-24 12:20:00,531,"Larry probably not going to find a local bait shop. ""A commercial bait license holder cannot buy or sell baitfish that have been preserved with salt."" https://www.ontario.ca/page/bait-management-review Don't ask me why, just providing what I had learned on this topic earlier from earlier research. p.s. perch gullets work also Good luck"
6717171,walleyecheek,2023-02-24 15:30:00,2231,"LOL. First CANADA said the Border Patrol didn't have time to Monkey around with Crawlers ? Then they said ""The USA dirt the crawlers come out of is or could be contaminated ! ( although I personally know a bait shop owner in CANADA and he (or she ) gets their crawlers from the US. Last time i checked Salted Dead Minnows don't come out of the Contaminated Dirt........LOL."
6717177,prov1800,2023-02-24 15:53:00,5010,Maybe try salted licorice might work and probably can bring into Canada.
6717185,RichA$1970,2023-02-24 16:12:00,1159,"There’s a bait shop in Ignace next to the gas station on the north side you can call. I agree on gullets but 1 question, is it legal to use them in Ontario?"
6717193,walleyecheek,2023-02-24 17:26:00,2231,I don't know ! They'll probably say the SALT you used to salt your Licorice is Contaminated !!!...........LOL.
