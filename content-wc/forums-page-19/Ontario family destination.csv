6710161,RichA$1970,2023-01-28 07:14:00,1159,Go to Algomacountry.com and you can do a search of drive ins. You could try Klotz Lake Camp that connects to Flint Lake and is off 11 as that‚Äôs probably 14.5 hours from you. I do think it would be worth the extra couple of hours to go NW Ontario or at least the Nakina area like O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äôs
6710225,adempsey2.0,2023-01-28 11:17:00,611,"I would second this recommendation. I haven't been in quite a few years, but the cabins etc are all top notch.The fishing is decent and if you are familiar with fishing deeper lakes, you will do fine. It's a fairly substantial body of water too. Which is somewhat of a downside since the resort is located at the far east end of the lake.If you push your driving to the max of 15 hours, you could consider the lodges around Thunder Bay (e.g., Dog Lake, Kashabowie, Lac des Milles Lacs), but I am not sure they would be an improvement or not as far as fishing goes. Someone also mentioned O'Sullivan Lake, which is also about 15 hours from you. There are two outfitters operating on this lake - O'Sullivan's Rainbow and Andomoozewe. Andomoozwe recently took over the camp, so I am sure they are making some great improvements to it. The fishery seems really good for a drive-in lake. You do have to travel on a gravel road for quite a ways as far as I understand. Beautiful lake though. Nathan Kurtz has a lot of great videos on his trips to O'Sullivan Lake.https://www.youtube.com/@nathankurtz2464/videosThe biggest problem for both O'Sullivans Rainbow and Happy Day Lodge is they book up really fast."

We ended up deciding to take the advice on the longer 2 day drive each way to NWO. Going to Lac Seul. Thanks again for the responses."
6710927,rather-be-fishin,2023-01-31 19:56:00,429,"Lac Seul, ü§© Good choice! üëç. You won't be disappointed! It is a Walleye factory! Has Pike too & depending on which end of the lake, there is Muskies on the East end! What resort did you decide on? This will be our 20th year trip to Lac Seul & my grandsons 11 & 13 years old first trip! Dream come true for me to bring them to experience the total wilderness & fantastic fishing!!! I am sooooo looking forward to it!!! üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüé£üá®üá¶üòé RBF"

6717357,fsz,2023-02-25 13:35:00,144,"I have never been to Happy Days Lodge but if you do a search on this forum you will see some positive reviews. Its on Lake Windemere. The same outfitter has cabins on Prarie Bee lake as well. Bass, pike and walleye in both. I also live in NE Ohio. Your time requirements pretty much restrict you to the Chapleau/wawa area or the areas north of north bay or east of north bay (in quebec province). There are a few places on lake kipawa which is about 1.5 hours from north bay. Its extremely pretty, but the walleye fishing in that lake can be hit or miss. There are good reviews on lady evelyn lake north of north bay and horwood lake south of Folyet. If you are willing to drive up to 16-17 hours, I've heard O'sullivan lake north of Nakina is good. There are a couple guys that fish erie hard in the cleveland area and they still go there every year. Do some research and youll likely find some of their videos."
6717795,tolsen,2023-02-26 20:36:00,126,"Take a look at the Winnipeg River near Minaki Onatario. A more affordable option but super nice owners would be Barbers Resort.http://www.barbersresort.com/If you are wanting some more off the beaten path and want to spend a tad more look at Big North Lodge. We have a family cabin about 10-20 minutes from those two and I can attest every year the fishing is always good! Walleye, Northern, Smallies, Crappie, Musky. Etc"
6709951,Tr-eye-fecta,2023-01-27 11:40:00,72,"Hi, was looking at a trip taking the family to Ontario for a fishing trip. The options seem so endless that the search seems daunting. The criteria would be to be within 12-15 hour drive of northeast Ohio, would need some amenities-electric, water at least but a resort with more would be better, taking own boat ideally, good walleye and pike fishing. Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks"
6709953,Eckohlt,2023-01-27 11:47:00,3685,"Where roughly does a 12 to 15 hour put you in Ontario,roughly near what city??"
6709959,RichA$1970,2023-01-27 11:58:00,1159,If you‚Äôre near Ashtabula then you are at least 16.5 hours to International Falls. I guess you might want to look into the Wawa / White River Algoma area but I think it‚Äôs worth the drive to NW Ontario for fishing unless you are just looking for a nice lake / setting.
6710007,7 Mag,2023-01-27 14:08:00,1887,"It takes me 12 hours to get to International Falls & i live in North Central Indiana, you'll have to plan for a longer drive to get to NWO."
6710021,fishron,2023-01-27 15:06:00,317,"Although my Canadian fishing has been limited to Quebec and Northern Ontario (no regrets), your driving time gets you to the Chaplaeu area. There are many lodges in the area and a fair amount of information on this site. I think you can find good fishing if not great fishing for walleye and pike there and many places you can take your own boat."
6710027,Baseline,2023-01-27 15:34:00,3207,"Witch Bay Lodge - Lake of the Woods - Nestor Falls You should find everything you want here http://www.witchbay.com Might be a couple hours more travel, but if you have the family along stop in Duluth MN or the Wis Dells for a day or so and tour around."
6710039,3M TA3,2023-01-27 16:00:00,2846,"You might want to consider Happy Day Lodge on Windemere Lake near Chapleau. About 300 miles from Sault Ste. Marie, about 90 miles East and North of Wawa. Very Family friendly and the fishing for Walleye and Small Mouth has been great with some very nice Pike in the mix occasionally. Has Lake Trout and Whitefish as well so success with those is mostly dependent on time of year. Prices very reasonable too. Check them out."
6710085,Clairebear,2023-01-27 18:49:00,937,"Easy answer , north shore Lake Erie, Cholchester, Leamington, Wheatley, Erieau, Port Glasgow, Port Stanley, Port Bruce, Port Burwell, the list is endless. Pick a time and ask. I am in Pt Glasgow central basin and we are on the walleye from May until they leave, ."
6710147,Tr-eye-fecta,2023-01-28 05:45:00,72,"Lol, yes Erie is a heck of a fishery. I do fish it from the south plenty. Looking for the different experience of up north fishing. Went somewhere north of Chapleau on a boat in 20 years ago. That was my only Canada trip. Don‚Äôt remember exactly where. Thanks for the replies. Still wading through the options."
6710149,Clairebear,2023-01-28 05:59:00,937,"Yes for sure, northern Ontario is a completely different experience. Lots of choices. Jump on the Michigan Sportsman forum and ask the same question."
