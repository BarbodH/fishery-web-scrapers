Don't know who is set up for lodges from Canada, altho there is a list of vendors on web site. There used to also be a January all Canada show, but that died when Covid hit and has not been resurrected yet. I have tendency to only go every couple of years. $10 for parking and $13 or so for Tix will buy several lures. Plus i can sit at home and browse internet all winter long and pick my location along with gathering tons of unbiased info. So i have taken advice from this web site and am headed to Nakina this year with my wife. Will see how it pans out. Then second trip with Train-in with several guys from church. Still trying to get my daughter to go again, but so far, no luck."

6716693,UKBDM,2023-02-23 06:48:00,178,I'm headed to the show today ... any recommendations? good deals on tackle?

6717103,UKBDM,2023-02-24 12:17:00,178,"A fair # of Canadian lodges there ... saw an outfit from Atikokan I used to canoe with years ago. Some of the old standby's were missing ... I'm sure COVID has been tough on some. Talked to a guy from KY who just built a camp in Saskatchewan before pandemic. Two years of zero income after a half a million investment ... yikes. Overall I was slightly disappointed. Not as many tackle sellers and the deer/turkey portion seemed way down on hunting camps, etc. I think that some of it is me ... I dont get as excited as I used to when I was a younger man in my teens/twenties. Didnt spend a dime on anything except admission and parking. Maybe I'm part of the problem. Old guys who have enough tackle and have been going to the same camp for many years."

6717127,Skywagon,2023-02-24 12:57:00,1106,That comment kind of dates you doesn't it.
6717161,Eckohlt,2023-02-24 14:23:00,3685,"I don't feel out dated yet,if you can walk to the boat n hold a fishing pole your good to go."
