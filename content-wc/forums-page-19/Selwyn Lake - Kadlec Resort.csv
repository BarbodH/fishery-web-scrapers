6716405,Scratcher,2023-02-21 10:43:00,170,Searched around but haven't found much current information on this lake. Headed up the second week of walleye season and looking for any tips or information anyone is willing to share. Thanks greatly.

6717971,Scratcher,2023-02-27 12:34:00,170,This Selwyn is 2 miles down the road from Sowden Lake both being part of the English river system. Seems its either not very popular waste of time or a top secret hot spot. Which ever it is I guess we will find out!
