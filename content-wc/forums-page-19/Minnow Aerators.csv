6716257,Eckohlt,2023-02-20 19:01:00,3685,"The last minnows I used was on a flyin,they were brought in 2 times during the week hundreds of them,put in a big bucket n hung off the dock,I don't use minnows spring or summer and everyone of those minnows died,so every night off the dock I hand fed the walleyes to use up the minnows,hold them in your fingers n get ready to move you fingers out of the way fast,I had more fun doing that than catching them.I just change ice everyday on the crawlers,doesn't get any easier than that!"
6716311,last chance,2023-02-21 05:43:00,3262,"I would like to add the marine metal products aerator will work with any bucket but with the 5 or 10 gallon buckets, there is a hole in the lid for the aerator. nit keeps the water cooler and aerates like crazy. we would put the pinfish we caught for bait in a 5 gallon bucket and by the time we would carry them back to where we parked they were dying. we switched them to the 10 gallon bucket with about 6 or 8 gallons of water. not only did it revive our bait but kept them alive for fishing for hours."
6716331,Limeyangler,2023-02-21 06:52:00,563,Agreed.
6716333,prov1800,2023-02-21 06:56:00,5010,Been on a few of Clark's flyouts and usually wife and I stay 3-4 days.I go into minnow shack just before plane leaves and get myself 2 or 3 bags of fresh minnows and pump the oxygen into them and then they go into the insulated bags.When plane lands and gets unloaded those minnows went into the fridge and after we were ready to fish we would take one bag approx 10 dozen and go fishing.We don't fish all day only couple hrs at a time and what ever minnows are left would go back in the fridge.We have no problem keeping them alive.The couple of fish we keep (maybe 3-4) That I clean for our fish fry that day I tale the gullets out and use those to.They will last all day unless a northern bites it off.Gullets are very effective but must come off at the end of the day as they'll dry up and you will not get them off.Unused gullet get frozen in the freezer.The few minnows that are left go in the pail off the dock and get sunk to bottom with the rock in the pail.Some of the outposts have the metal cages which seem to keep minnows better.Minnows in the fridge stay lively until needed.On flyouts with fishing being as good as it is live bait really not needed.as you will still catch plenty of fish.My wife and I when we get a chance to go on a fly out really don't spend much time fishing maybe 4 hrs a day.2 in morning and couple in evening.Off course fishing off some of the docks is amazing.i find the paddle tails work great and by ripping the tail off a twister it looks like some kind of grub.This will get you a lot of fish.The clearer twister tails seem to work best.Next time your on a flyout give them a try.
6716339,Pooch,2023-02-21 07:16:00,4618,"^^For sure^^ Pretty much goes for all live bait. Watch people at the dock leave crawlers out in the sun all day then gripe about the quality of the bait they ""paid good money for"". Pooch"
6716349,stumcfar,2023-02-21 08:09:00,451,"One year, it was early in the year, the water was cool, so we left a bunch of minnows tied to the boat in the normal floating minnow buckets. Keeping them alive wasn't an issue, but the next morning we came out and there was hardly a minnow left in either bucket. We discovered that an otter or two had learned how to get in and eat all our minnows. We learned to wire the door shut so they couldn't get in!"
6716353,prov1800,2023-02-21 08:16:00,5010,Yup everyone learns that trick.Mink are notorious for that to.Years ago I was guiding at Big Canon lake lodge and about 200 dozen minnows were delivered and put in the minnow tank and the lid had not been fastened down and next morning when all us guides went to get our minnows there wasn't one left.lol.Tge family of otters had ate them all.
6716357,Eckohlt,2023-02-21 08:21:00,3685,What did you use for bait after the otters had there all you can eat buffet??
6716363,prov1800,2023-02-21 08:47:00,5010,We spent that day on Big Canon for trout so didn't need any bait.Tge guys that went over to river used twister tails and I suggested some bacon on the hook for some smell.Big Canon itself more lake trout and Bass some muskies.Camp also takes you a mile across Portage to wabigoon river and fishing like flyin there.
6716409,proguidedream,2023-02-21 13:37:00,345,"i can keep a couple dozen alive in the fride with a small ice cream pail , and no lid. after 4-5 days ill take a large cup, scoop out some water. then i will dump some fresh water in from a little higher up to get some good bubbles in the water. 3 weeks is my record like this, before i have to bring them fishing. im sure constant temp, and dark fridge has something to do with it.. minnow bucket off the dock would get pretty hot in the sun. would have to be sunk a bit id think"
6716059,Pezman38,2023-02-20 07:23:00,3196,"I use an engel 30qt portable aerator. It is fantastic. If I get minnows I can keep them alive in my garage for over a week.I keep bottles of water frozen, and I throw a couple into the water to keep it cold, swap them out as needed.It plugs into the wall so doesn't drain the batteries, batteries will last a couple days on their own which is nice."
6716083,Pooch,2023-02-20 07:55:00,4618,"We used a five gallon bucket off the end of the dock one year and lost all minnows first day as the bay water was too warm. Had it in twelve foot of water and bucket had hundreds of tiny holes drilled in it and a brick for weight.Commercial battery powered insulated buckets work well with clean water and a few pieces of ice daily.Picture is of what we ended up using as long as cabin has power and a freezer. Everyday remove a bucket of dirty water and add a bucket of clean water of the same temp as the cooler. Drop a frozen half gallon milk jug of water in once or twice a day, depending on the ambient temperature. Keep the lid closed (but not completely) as minnows will jump out.On the trip up the cooler carries our frozen food so it is already cool when it gets switched over to minnow storage.Lost virtually no minnows.Pooch"
6716093,Camoclad,2023-02-20 08:02:00,628,This is the key. We have had to make a bouy in the past and sink the minnows out in deeper water to keep them cool. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6716115,Eckohlt,2023-02-20 08:41:00,3685,"I'm guessing you use that when you go to drive to resort,and not on a flyin??"
6716123,KC Walleye,2023-02-20 09:02:00,274,"Pooch, can I ask why you leave the top slightly open? I see in the picture you devised a device to create a gap? Just curious as I always run coolers with aerators, but they are closed tight. Always up for learning something. Thanks! KC"
6716155,Fisherman Ted,2023-02-20 11:11:00,461,"Keeping minnows alive in the summer is the bane of my existence. I put them in my Lund baitwell in my Impact. Limited success. Added a secondary air bubbler to the well. Not great. So then I resorted to putting them in a bait bucket and putting on the bottom off of my bow when docked. However my dock is only like 4 feet off the bottom. You see where I'm going here....... So, I give up in the heat of the summer. The key is keeping them cold. I get that. And throwing ice in your container makes sense, if you have time. Which I don't. So here's the question. Is there a tool I can buy to not only circulate the water but also COOL the water. Just like a 110v aerator, how about a water cooing unit. If I can find one of those I'm golden. Talk to me boys -FT"
6716159,Ltrain,2023-02-20 11:24:00,4145,Well I do know they make cold plates and stainless coils to keep beer cold without filling a garbage can with ice at picnics and such. Instead of pumping with Co2 I'm sure you could rig it to pump with your livewell pump. All depends how much you want to get into it but you could make it work. You could just put a big stainless coil in a small cooler with ice or dry ice and hit the pump when you want the water cooled Here's a link for the coils https://www.wholesalebeerparts.com/s...ss-steel-coils
6716201,prov1800,2023-02-20 14:17:00,5010,Minnows need some TLC in summer.Keeping water cool is the ticket.Do you have minnows at camp in cooled minnow tank.???.Iam lucky where I go past a bait dealer and get fresh minnows daily.If my next day guiding takes me in a different direction I pick up more minnows and put them in a big fridge cooler like a yeti.Water and ice and this lasts days.Water cold for longggg time.
6716207,Pooch,2023-02-20 14:30:00,4618,"Now only do drive in camps, but would work anywhere you have access to power. Like I said the cooler is full of frozen food going up and then holds minnows in camp. Access to lots of ice would work. Some camps have an ice machine. Even one flyin we used to go to had an old fashion ice house then later added an ice machine. That was the cats' meow. Flyin? Probably too much weight with the pumps and stuff. We don't do flyin's anymore. Most wouldn't have minnows available and taking in a bag full burns precious wight. Pooch"
6716211,Pooch,2023-02-20 14:41:00,4618,"That contraption is just a coat hanger hook to keep the lid from closing completely tight. With the two aerators running the air pumped in needs an outlet somewhere. I have an ancient insulated minnow bucket with just a battery powered aerator and the lid closes tight bit still lose enough to let air out, plus we are always pulling minnows out so the lid is open a lot. I take it to the cabin at night and put a small 110volt pump on it to save batteries and keep minnows happy and ready overnight. Chance to swap out some of the dirty water and add some fresh water and ice cubes. Everyone has a system. The buckets work for one group I fish with, but I just can't keep a lot of minnows healthy doing it that way. The screw on lids for buckets are great and foil otters and other critters from robbing our minnow stash. One year we lost a couple hundred dollars worth of minnows to stagnant water in the camp bay even though it was twelve foot deep. Water was just too warm in that area. Discovered it too late. Pooch"
6715977,rpbadger,2023-02-19 18:53:00,22,"Does anyone have experience with portable minnow aerators? When we fly into our outpost lake, and put the minnows in the 5 gallon bucket tied to the dock, many die in the first two days or so. Would appreciate any advise/particular aerator model. Thanks!"
6715979,Luckydawg13,2023-02-19 19:01:00,363,I use a 5-gallon bucket with an aerator on it works great for me I have kept up to 10 bluegills alive for a few days for catfishing

6716007,dschiebel,2023-02-20 00:21:00,85,"We just salt the ones that die, no big deal."

6716017,last chance,2023-02-20 04:25:00,3262,many yrs ago we use to make trips to dale hollow in the spring for nighttime walleye fishing up the river at the headwaters. minnows were .85 a dozen at the marina but we could get them at home for 3 dozen for 1.00. so we started taking our minnows with us in a small cooler using a mino-mizer that kept 100 or more alive for the week we would spend fishing down there. it's been many yrs but I believe it used a 6v battery. never mind I just searched for them online and couldn't find them available anymore.the only one I found for keeping our pinfish alive for bait when we were saltwater fishing was the metal aerator bait saver. I used the 10-gallon one but they make a shorter version for 5 gallons. Sportsman warehouse has the 10-gallon metal products bait saver livewell which comes with the 10-gallon bucket and the aerator that runs off 12v for only 86.99 which is cheaper than I found the aerator.it also comes in a 5 gallon version.
6716019,walleyecheek,2023-02-20 04:30:00,2231,"It doesn't matter how big of containers, or how good the aerator is ! Water has to be cold and stay COLD !"
6716041,guidedfishing,2023-02-20 06:40:00,531,"Tried aerator in the past, the final conclusion and the best methods is I just added minnow buckets with like 5 doz or less minnows and I sink them all to the bottom. With a 4 -5 minnow buckets we have kept minnows alive for well over a week. Don't crowd them and get them to the bottom of 3-4 feet of water at least. Check them daily skim the dead ones for use that day if any. To each there own, but aerators does not matter if the water gets warm.good luck"
6716055,Mojo-NC,2023-02-20 06:50:00,1929,"Exactly! Most years we have not had an issue keeping our minnows alive by sinking a bucket to the bottom at the end of the dock. During one of our recent fly-in trips, the water was too warm (early September) and all of our 30 dozen minnows died within a couple of days. We should have listened to the owner of the lodge when he recommended that we keep them in a cooler up at the fish cleaning house with ice in the water. Lesson learned - man did they stink! I started fishing with artificial baits and the walleyes didn't seem to mind at all. Now I rarely use live bait."
