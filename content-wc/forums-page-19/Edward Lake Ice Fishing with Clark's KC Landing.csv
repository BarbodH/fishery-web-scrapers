Plenty of eaters, the biggest walleye was 26 1/2"". Wayne told us right away, plain jig and minnow on the bottom. We all ice fish in MN quite a bit, so we used what we use here, and he did scold us (while laughing) for using ""fancy"" jigs, said we must be pretty good fishermen to catch fish on that junk. Jig and minnow on the bottom did catch plenty for us as well. Caught several pike as too, biggest one of those was 30"". The really big surprise for us was 2 muskies over 40""! We used the 6 hole fish house, and for 4 of us it was plenty comfortable. The cabin was really good as well, and a super short walk from the fish house. Cleaned fish in Wayne's shop that is heated and clean. Road conditions were great all the way up and back, and Wayne keeps his property well plowed. Was really surprised that we saw few (really none) snowmobile tracks or fish houses on any of the Canadian lakes on the way. ProV1800, I know you'll wonder why I didn't touch base, we had a full fish house, and it was a little ""crowded"" at KC's with a big birthday party fishing next to us on the ice. Next time we're up that way we'll try to meet. Anyway, we got to meet some really great folks, caught some fish, and I'm not really sure how we could have had more fun! Until we were there I really didn't know how much I'd missed all of that for the last few years, super glad to be back!"
