6716161,prov1800,2023-02-20 11:30:00,5010,Eck.Not that quite anymore spring or fall.Actually getting busier on both those times of the year.Spring time easiest to catch walleyes and lots.Fall you see a ton of muskie guys last few years.There OK.They don't walleye fish just create waves running all over lakes all day long.Only have one lake left that is quite and try talk my guests into going there.Most people actually used to crowds that come here from what I gather and have been told so most don't care if it's busy.Its more me I have hard time with it lol.

6716185,prov1800,2023-02-20 12:29:00,5010,Think I was talking about ice fishing.And those that cater to it do quite well without a thousand people around you.Mostly harder to get to fishing destinations.No ice roads.Back country stuff.Not really effecting fish populations.
6716361,NM_Trout,2023-02-21 08:39:00,1094,"I enjoy reading John Gierach. I recommend his books, even if you are not a fly fisher. I have several of his books, and when I was re-reading ""Fool's Paradise"" yesterday, I note (paraphrasing) that he had this to say about the odd lack of little fish : ""one sometimes wonders where the little fish are when it seems that all that is being caught is the larger variety. The little fish are off doing that which little fish need to do... which is staying away from big fish"". He also writes about the overall food cycle, that it moves in a large and inevitable circle, such that the biggest, meanest predators eventually die and are recycled by ""the smallest and the most patient"". He quoted Gary Snyder with this : ""All of us at the table will eventually be part of the meal""."
6716365,v-bay gord,2023-02-21 08:48:00,3168,"Have you ever noticed that all the boats on the lake are being driven by ""big"" people? Where are all the little boat drivers? We should all be worried about the future of boat driving...."

6716091,stumcfar,2023-02-20 08:01:00,451,"The part I would disagree with is that I don't a time when the lake on the Minnesota side has produced as many trophy fish. Many fish over 25"" to 30"" caught. I have had several days the last few years where is you catch 50 fish in a day, 35 would be under 14""and a dozen would be over the slot with maybe a couple of keepers. I do agree the DNR has to step in and make some changes. The big difference on the lake is the ice fishing pressure. With lake roads going out nearly 30 miles to areas never much ice fished before and 1000's of wheel houses now out there every weekend."
6716105,prov1800,2023-02-20 08:17:00,5010,"Ice fishing is hard on fish populations.The numbers of ice fisherman has really increased.Ice roads to hot spots and tons of people keeping limits in the winter got to have its effects.Some of our cdn lakes see way more pressure to even the more remote lakes.The 16-18 "" fish get taken home.Some big ones get taken home also.Some die to deep fishing.so more little fish get left behind."
6716113,Eckohlt,2023-02-20 08:38:00,3685,"Fish don't get much time to rest mid April to 3rd Saturday in may,,,then the battle starts again."

6716127,prov1800,2023-02-20 09:39:00,5010,Many places that have crowds like that including rainy river and lake winnipeg if you read up about these places all seem to have problems.Wonder why.I don't think today's regulations took the ice fishing into account.Many fishing tournaments also everywhere.I thank my lucky stars I can get away from that and stare across the lakes I fish and basically see no one.
6716133,Eckohlt,2023-02-20 09:52:00,3685,You wouldn't last long out in the boat here in MN before you threw in the towel and said I've had enough of this sht.

My 20+ seasons on the South Shore & ""US"" waters has provided the fuel for my opinion! Minnesotas' ""DNR"" needs to be concerned on the overall health of its ""Fishery""!

6715811,prov1800,2023-02-19 06:59:00,5010,Iam all for this lol.Have fished with Eck couple times now and would be a great fishing partner.

Funny... this is a bit like ""Groundhog Day"". Anything different is good. Who knew I'd be going to Canada this summer in search of little ones? :-) Catch a couple hundred in the 12"" to 20"" range, and a little one once in awhile is fun. I mostly get up there in early June, so weed beds are not as developed yet. Some reeds are starting to poke their noses up, but most of the weeds are still down. No lilly pads in early June yet. I try to get up there before the water gets too warm, as I do enjoy fly casting for pike and the shallows are already getting too warm for the bigger ones. I might bring a fish finder this year as well. I can fish my favorite lake with my eyes closed, but maybe I need to spend more time poking around with a sonar unit and looking for middle of lake structure. Plus, it would be fun to record a bunch of sl2 files. Those little ones gotta be there, right?"
6715235,Eckohlt,2023-02-16 13:42:00,3685,"Don't forget your ultra light! Your the first guy I know going to Ontario in search of aquarium size walleyes.Sounds like you'd be more happy with a 6inch eye than a 30incher,lol"
6715245,prov1800,2023-02-16 14:12:00,5010,If your coming first couple of weeks you might get lucky with a fly rod.You should catch plenty of smallmouth bass depending where your fishing.Might get the odd pike but most will bite you off.Walleyes will be tough unless you have sinking line.But will be fun trying.
6715253,RichA$1970,2023-02-16 14:27:00,1159,"Interesting as <14” are not very common when I fish. I totally agree with Prov1800 on they’re near the Perch deep in cover at times. Maybe I miss them as I’m tossing big spoons, spinners & hair jigs most of them time."
6715255,proguidedream,2023-02-16 14:30:00,345,"i have caught a 4 inch walleye once. yes on a hook. in a small bay on small back lake, came up a sharp ledge and marked 100.s of fish (bait cloud) . but it was walleyes. sat in the palm of my hand and was not sure what it was at first."
6715261,stumcfar,2023-02-16 14:48:00,451,"When fishing Lake of the Woods on the Minnesota side, it is becoming more and more difficult to find walleyes 15""-19.5"". The lake seems overrun with walleyes and saugers under 15"" and it has been that way for several years. Everyone keeps waiting for them to grow up and then the next year is the same. I agree, when fishing the Lakes in Ontario like Lac Seul or Lakes we fly into, we very seldom catch anything that small???"
6715403,Bill Krejca,2023-02-17 06:52:00,6107,"Yeah, not catching the smaller game fish is generally normal. They just seem to hang out in different places than where we usually fish. Because they are small, they are considered as meal for the larger fish. It is pretty normal to hardly ever catch many/any small pike, walleye, bass, crappie, etc. Whenever I do get a small feller, I always consider it a good thing, as I get a good feeling about the hatch in general, and feel it is a great harbinger of the future fishery of the water body. Little kids don't hang out with the big kids, fish, likewise. Bill"
6715449,prov1800,2023-02-17 08:58:00,5010,Defiantly not going to catch much smaller fish throwing bigger lures.Although it seems when I do that smallmouth will about hit any muskie lure in the tackle box.Theres not much of a category for smallest fish caught on a hook but here is my wife's pike that would fit into that small category.
6715455,NM_Trout,2023-02-17 09:03:00,1094,"That little dude still has what looks to be parr marks on him. (Do pike get parr marks?) I think I like catching little ones from time to time as it is good to see that they are in the queue for getting bigger. I do note that fish such as bass, when small, tend to hug the shore and stay behind weeds with the bait. At least the smart ones do :-)"
6715063,NM_Trout,2023-02-16 07:53:00,1094,"I was looking through some pictures over the last 20 years or so, and it struck me that when we fish out outpost lakes, they are walleye and pike factories, but we rarely catch fish that are smaller than 10"". There are thousands and thousands of walleyes in these waters. Granted... a lot of the little fish get used up by the bigger predators, but still.... I wonder why we don't see many of the little ones?"
6715075,brown1317,2023-02-16 08:07:00,74,I've wondered the same thing. 15 yrs ago we used to catch Walleye in the 9-12 inch range but not anymore. Makes me wonder what's going on and if the lake is getting fished out.
6715077,Lmbkiller,2023-02-16 08:10:00,639,"U are selecting for the relatively larger ones by using the baits u are using A lot of Canadian Shield lks are mesotrophic to oligotrophic. Compared to more southern lks they have lower walleye densities, even though fishing is spectacular There is low recruitment Many of the fish u are catching are old adults, as old as 25yrs plus. I have aged some walleyes from Ontario, they aren't young Many of what people consider eaters are over 7yrs old"
6715085,Yellowfin123,2023-02-16 08:20:00,2182,"the channel between lac seul and vaughn lake is jam packed with 6""-10"" walleyes if anybody is lookin"
6715087,NM_Trout,2023-02-16 08:24:00,1094,"Huh. I tend to use 3.5"" plastics, and formerly used at least a couple thousand minnows. Still, I bet I can count on one had the number of ""small"" walleye I've caught. Also... in 20 years, I have caught exactly one perch. A very terrified looking perch. I might have to bring some smaller jigs just to see if I can find some smaller fish. I do note that my favorite lake had a forest fire around it, and many trees dropped into the water. Last summer we got hung up a bunch, but we also noticed a LOT of baitfish (or maybe walleye fingerlings?) in the brush along the shoreline. Hoping that helps the breeding stock out."
6715091,RichA$1970,2023-02-16 08:31:00,1159,"After seeing Eck’s pictures of what he caught on his December ice fishing trip, there’s plenty of small ones up there."

6715155,Yellowfin123,2023-02-16 10:55:00,2182,"I think your right and this rule applies to most fish, they don't venture out into deeper water till jr high school as far as the vaughn channel, those might be the group that ride the little yellow short bus, probably have some learning disbilities"
