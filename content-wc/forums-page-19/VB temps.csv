6716589,prov1800,2023-02-22 14:00:00,5010,JFYI if your trying to make me jealous it's working.Between there and here that's one heck of a temperature difference.But enjoy it.
6716489,prov1800,2023-02-22 06:49:00,5010,Winter not over yet in the North.Few more days and it will get back to more decent Temps and get back outside.Our snow load is just below normal so doesn't look like any flooding headed our way this year but March can bring some of that white fluffy stuff.Only time will tell.Looking forward to some warm spring weather and spend some time outside in our awesome wilderness.Bought a new lure for trout and looking forward to trying it out..
6716491,Eckohlt,2023-02-22 07:13:00,3685,"Good day to be in a shack with the heater cranked up,must be a secret lure,,,no pic,haha"
6716495,prov1800,2023-02-22 07:23:00,5010,Not a secret.Went onto Bobbies bait shop and saw it so what the heck I bought it.It looks like it has potential.Hope don't offend anyone with this post.

6716523,prov1800,2023-02-22 09:05:00,5010,It's pretty safe in my trout spots.Only 16 bucks.lol.i have steel leaders if it goes down in different lake.
6716527,Eckohlt,2023-02-22 09:18:00,3685,"16 bucks WOW!! Must be guaranteed to catch fish,call your insurance guy to see if it's covered if you lose it or when you lose it."

Today would be perfect temps to be on a lake fishing but instead I’m trying to pick a spot between rock bluffs, the woods or a nice pasture which all have pros and cons on the farm to build a new house on"
