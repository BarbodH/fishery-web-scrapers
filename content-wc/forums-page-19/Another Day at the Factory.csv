6716219,Skywagon,2023-02-20 15:20:00,1106,"I battled arctic temperatures this afternoon to get another ice depth reading in an area of the lake that did not have any frozen slush. The auger length from the tip to the motor is 41"". The measurement from good solid ice to the bottom of the ice was 27"". Ice-out will be by May 6th. Let it be known, all of my winnings will be donated to Pooch this year so he can afford gas money to come up fishing again, I understand he is now retired and money is tight."
6716225,walleyecheek,2023-02-20 15:49:00,2231,"I think he meant 34"""
6716227,prov1800,2023-02-20 15:50:00,5010,Thanks for that ice measurement.That sounds a bit better but think you should invite me over one day so we can get a second opinion.As far as ice out are we talking completely out one end to the other.
6716245,Eckohlt,2023-02-20 17:53:00,3685,"Good idea for 2 guys to measure the ice,one or the other may not have done well in math class!"
6716725,NM_Trout,2023-02-23 07:57:00,1094,"Not ever having done shack fishing, I've got some questions...sorry... there are a bunch. Does putting the shack on blocks keep the skids from freezing to the ice?When you move it, do you just drag it on the skids? Is dragging it hard on the shack? What do you move it with? When you get it to shore, do you put it on a trailer or just drag it up onto shore for the summer?Are those plugs around the perimeter the holes that you fish through?Do you initially drill your holes from inside of the shack? Once the holes are drilled, and you leave it overnight, how much ice forms in the old hole?Looks pretty fancy. Is ice shack theft a thing?How fast does ice-out happen? Do you remove that shack once slush starts to form on top, or is it just ""Hey.. by March 1 you gotta get off the ice""?"
6716767,Bigtaproot,2023-02-23 09:49:00,900,That place is nicer than my timeshare!!
6716771,Eckohlt,2023-02-23 09:53:00,3685,I'd be dropping that time share!!
6717075,Skywagon,2023-02-24 11:01:00,1106,"NM_Trout: 1. It is blocked up to keep skids from freezing to the ice. This year water came up and froze near the top of the blocks (1') so I moved the shack rather than block it up more. 2. Yes, I drag it on the skids. Most permanent shacks are designed to be dragged on the skids. 3. I normally use the snowmobile to drag the shacks, but have used a side X side, or 6-wheeler on occasion. 4. There is always snow on the ground when I drag it off the lake onto my property. 5. Yes those hole plugs are 12"", we fish through them. I designed the shack to have 4 holes in a line so I can see all the holes with my Garmin Livescope fish finder. 6. The holes are always drilled from inside the shack, as the ice gets thicker I have to add extensions on the auger in order to have enough length to drill through the ice. 7. I normally leave the shack in the same spot all winter (3-4 months). 8. It depends on how cold it is, as to how much ice forms overnight, hard to answer that question. If it has been a few days since the hole was opened, it is like starting all over again. 9. Shack theft is not a thing, it is a different world here, not that many people, it would be noticed. There are only 5 shacks on my 15000 acre lake, 2 of them are mine. 10. Every year is different for getting off the lake, it is best to do it when the top layer is frozen. I usually get the shack off by the end of March, but it has been later."
6717079,Bill Krejca,2023-02-24 11:06:00,6107,"Sorta explains how one fish can be measured and results by several folks end up being different, eh? Especially after a time factor. Bill"
6715939,prov1800,2023-02-19 15:42:00,5010,Plowed my yard today.Woukd like to wash my truck but it will have to wait.
6715943,Skywagon,2023-02-19 16:10:00,1106,"Pooch, I groomed Ellen's ski trail on the lake this afternoon and drilled a hole while I was out there. The place I drilled was a frozen slush spot, so not the best place to check, it measured 34' of ice at that spot. There is a lot more ice than I would have expected, considering it has been a milder than usual winter."
6715951,JAY221,2023-02-19 17:42:00,877,"34' is a lot!!!! Later, Jay"
6715953,Eckohlt,2023-02-19 17:49:00,3685,"Should be out by June 15,fingers crossed!!"
6715975,prov1800,2023-02-19 18:30:00,5010,"Did you hit a high slush spot.When I was at your shack last time I used your auger to drill holes around the shack.Not sure how long the auger is but broke through and motor was well above ice by a foot I thought.Trout lake I go to only has 20+"" if your lucky.Iam thinking early ice out this year.or at least hoping.lol"
6716025,Skywagon,2023-02-20 05:00:00,1106,"I was really surprised about the depth too, it didn't seem like it should be that thick, must have been an anomaly. I fished 2 different trout lakes last week, would guess the ice was about the same as on your trout lake. I'll check depth again today in a different place and measure the auger length just so everyone will know if the ice will be out by opener, or the middle of June."
6716027,prov1800,2023-02-20 05:04:00,5010,Let's hope it goes out around same time as normal around May 7 th
6716071,Pooch,2023-02-20 07:36:00,4618,"So when does the official WC ""Ice out"" thread get started? Pooch"
6716089,prov1800,2023-02-20 08:00:00,5010,Lol.All depends on what's considered ice out.Last year according to my pics I put boat in Cliff Lake on April 22.I didn't get very far and didn't have much open water maybe a mile and a half.From hwy launch to just past Cliff Lake RV Park and Muskie Bay.Got lucky still with a lake trout and 2 muskies that bit my trout tube.Tried breaking ice with the boat but was still to thick.Cheap gas day and still fun day.Cool Temps but always a great feeling to get in the boat.Not sure if it was considered ice out.
6716119,Eckohlt,2023-02-20 08:48:00,3685,Partial ice out.
6715805,Skywagon,2023-02-19 06:21:00,1106,The ice was getting so thick under the permanent ice shack that I moved it to thinner spot yesterday morning. Since it was such a nice day we decided to take advantage of the weather and fish outside. Back to fresh snow and wind this morning.
6715809,prov1800,2023-02-19 06:48:00,5010,How did moving the shack go.Where did you put it.Back to a bit of winter weather for a few days.
6715815,Eckohlt,2023-02-19 07:45:00,3685,"I see a few slabbers laying there,must be on the spot."
6715819,Skywagon,2023-02-19 07:56:00,1106,"The shack was sitting on 6"" X 6"" blocks stacked 2 high, they were almost flush with the skids because of the water that had come up since the shack had been placed. It was pure ice under and around the shack, so we had to build a ramp to get it up on the snow, it came up on the snow better than expected. Pictured is after the shack was moved, it started out looking like that the last time it was placed also."
6715823,prov1800,2023-02-19 08:02:00,5010,Should of called me.Had nothing much to do yesterday.And can always use a couple crappies for supper.lol.I see smoke coming from chimney.Cool wind yesterday.
6715835,Pooch,2023-02-19 08:20:00,4618,"Calling that place a ""shack"" seems all wrong....How much ice?Pooch"
6715867,Skywagon,2023-02-19 09:57:00,1106,"I have not measured the ice lately. With 2- 12"" extensions on the auger I could no longer drill through the ice from inside the shack when it was in the original location. I will have to measure and get back to you on that. Here are pictures of the shack before it got cluttered and fish slimed."
6715875,prov1800,2023-02-19 10:10:00,5010,So I've been there during the slimed up periods and would not say it was slimed or cluttered.Your SHACK is the cleanest shack I've ever seen.
6715881,Eckohlt,2023-02-19 10:18:00,3685,Boots off required when entering?
6715935,Pooch,2023-02-19 15:07:00,4618,I can't imagine Skywagon running anything but a tight ship or even a fish shack. We are outside washing cars today. This ain't right... Pooch
