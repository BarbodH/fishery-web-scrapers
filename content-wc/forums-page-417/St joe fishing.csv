I was up there the other day hauling guys in and out of the outpost camps and I brought a group of guys out for the day and one thing I can say about st joe, is the fishing there is just unreal, we spent the morning flipping 24'',25'' eyes like there 16's as fast as we could put our lines down, slow afternoon after we ate but th last hour before I packed it up to head back to sioux was well worth the wait, 4-6 fish on the whole time, made it difficult to net for each other, next time we are bringing 3 nets for the boat. We caught most our fish in about 18-22 feet."

1462490,Hillbiehle,2012-07-17 07:58:00,66,"I will agree. I had the privelage of staying with Troy at ""The Hilton"" last year and the fishing was incredible. I had two novices in the boat with me (70 yr old mother and her best freind). I was so busy netting at times, that they actually stopped fishing just so I could catch some. I highly doubt I will ever top the size and amount of fish we put in the boat."

I will make that disclaimer first but I was fortunate enough to have fished St. Joe's on two occasions. I was 16 when I first went and then went two years later when I was 18. It was the first two Canadian fishing trips I went on. I had no idea at the time how fortunate I was to be fishing that lake. I have never had such good fishing. We went up both years with a crew of 10. It was a dissapointing day not to catch 100 fish/2 man boat. It was also not uncommon to get into a school of 22-26 in walleye. Amazing! Both years there were multiple 30+ in walleye caught and released. That lake started my addiction to Canadian fishing. St. Joe is simply the most amazing body of water I've ever been on. The size and numbers were unreal in the early 90's and it is my impression the fishing is even better today. Someone mentioned that it may be the best walleye lake in Ontario, **** It may be in the running for one of the best walleye lakes in the world. I only hope I can make it back one more time."
1462555,Hewhocookstomuch,2012-07-17 09:30:00,66,"St.Joe Sat through Monday regular weather,warm. Tuesday morning woke up to very high winds that lasted till Thursday eveing. Friday squalls off and on. Our favoritespot the Grassy Noll went crazy, cast after cast we boated 16-19"". We moved down to Paul's Rock and I caught my biggest ever ""eye"" 27.5 inches. St. Joeguy caught a ""Blue Walleye"" for his last fish of the trip. Not many Northerns this trip, so I did not best my 41 incher from last year. The windy days were rough, had to use a sea anchor, did not slow our drifting down much. As always we will do better next year. St. Joe is the best."
1462655,PRO-V1,2012-07-17 12:25:00,142,"I Used to fish Joe 2-3 times a week, jump in the boat after work and it would be nothing to catch 50 fish just for a evening bite, and if Joe was to windy we would jump the highway and fish a few of our honey holeson the Albany the fish were not as chunky but plentiful....... Man i miss those days.Mike"
