1417978,Pakwash Lake Camp,2012-04-08 10:19:00,17,Just thought some of you might like to know Pakwash Lake has opened up. It's the earliest ice breakup known before 1956. Unless anyone has records dating before then. Windy today and the remainder of the ice is pushing into Pakwash Provincial Park Bay. pictures at http://www.pakwashlakefishing.blogspot.ca/
1418379,REG,2012-04-09 09:28:00,445,Good to know. We'll be on the lake the first week of June. Warmer water will affect our usual spots a little but I'm sure we'll find some fish. Is the lake level pretty normal?
1462474,brieye,2012-07-17 07:39:00,4,How was the fishing in June? Got a group up there now for the first time that could use some help locating the fish and patterns.
1462639,REG,2012-07-17 11:34:00,445,"We had a very good week but water seemed lower than usual and water temp was definately warmer than usual for the time of year we were there. Some nice northerns caught along with good numbers of walleyes. Surprisingly, we did well on weed edges - even as shallow as a few feet. I would tell them to head up the Chukuni and fish next to the falls as well as fishing the edges out in the channel where the river bends to head out into Pakwash. We haven't fished there in July (but have in June, Aug, and Sept) but I would also tell them to get out into the main lake and fish the deeper humps - the walleye islands have some nice structure around them with deep water nearby. Or any point that is close to some deeper water where the wind is/has been blowing in. If the wind has been out of the W or SW, they should always check out the beaches along the E side of the lake. Start out deeper and work in, and if they catch fish, focus on that depth. If they're staying at a resort, they should be able to get some good spots from the owners or other guests. Let me know how the group does..."
