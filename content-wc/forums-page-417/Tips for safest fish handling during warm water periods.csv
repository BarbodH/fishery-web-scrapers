I have shared this with my facebook wall for ease of passing info to others: http://www.facebook.com/jman2.0 We've heard multiple reports of big muskies (and a big walleye as well) being found belly up dead on the surface of the warm water during periods of extreme heat. Please consider the following when fishing for any species while surface temps are high (high 70's, 80's.)1. Land the fish as quickly as possible. Put away ultra-light rod combos when walleye fishing and use good heavy duty muskie rods for muskies and pike. Minimize the fight to limit the amount of lactic acid burn.2. KEEP THE FISH IN THE WATER. Use landing net, cradle or hand land and unhook fish while the fish is in the water, with extra caution used to keep the head in the water. You should never bring a fish into the boat to work on hook removal. This is not a good practice at any time of the year.3. Allow the fish to recover in the water before any photos are taken. Use cradle, large nets that allow the fish to sit upright and recover from the trauma of the fight.4. Consider water releases & photos with fish just up out of the water for a moment before putting it back in.5. Have all camera gear ready and functioning properly before fish comes out of the water. Be prepared for 1-2 very quick photos and get the fish immediately back into the water.6. Support your fish horizontally under its belly at all times. Vertical holds have been proven to damage a fish's skeletal structure and should always be supported with both hands in some way while holding for photos.7. Hold the fish still while release it. It's no longer suggested to move the fish forward and back during a release. Allow the fish to sit upright and monitor it after release if it stays on the surface. Any fish that appears it will not make it should be harvested if it is of legal size. Any fish not of legal size must not be harvested regardless of whether or not it will die upon release.8. If you can, fish early morning periods and late evening periods to avoid the heat of the day; all the better. If you don't HAVE to fish, wait til the water temps cool down some.9. Go barbless. Hooks with barbs pinched down or filed off will be much easier to remove, allowing for quicker releases overall. You will also save yourself all kinds of pain and suffering if you should ever end up with a hook burried in your person. Keep steady pressure on fish and you will not lose any more than you otherwise would while fishing with barbed hooks.Thank you for taking extra caution with our precious natural resources. Safe handling techniques, particularly during warm water periods, will significantly improve the future of our fisheries."
1462520,johnboat,2012-07-17 09:00:00,2014,Good tips Justin. See you in a week. Try to sweet talk Ellen into a couple hours of Muskie fishin! JohnB.O.A.T.
1462548,J-Man,2012-07-17 09:24:00,191,"Couple hours is about all I can get this summer, John.Maybe some night you can come over at 8:45 and we can get out at 9 and fish til 10:30 or 11...we've only been trying to get in a boat together for 3-4 years now."
1462589,Obabikon,2012-07-17 10:18:00,2370,"Shamefully, I killed my first musky in years last week. Small guy hit a cowgirl, and had a bad hook underneath. Tried to keep it in the water... didn't even take a picture. But 30 minutes of reviving, wasn't even wiggling. 80 degree water temps are dangerous for fish. I still feel sick for killing one."
1462596,J-Man,2012-07-17 10:32:00,191,"Hey Jared,I haven't had that happen to me. YET. If you fish enough, it WILL happen. My time is coming. I'm fortunate in some ways to get most of my fishing time in the fall when temps are low and fish are more robust. We can't beat ourselves up too much about it, but I can imagine how you feel. If we have the best tools we can to safely handle and release fish, then we are doing our part. The only alternative is to stopping fishing altogether and lord knows we can't entertain that possibility. You could try going barbless by filing or pinching your barbs down. With the amazing increases in rod technology, it's not going to affect your catch to lost fish ratio much anyway. Besides that, the next time you find yourself hooked to a treble hook that is hooked to a fish, you will be awfully glad you don't have barbs to worry about and just slide that hook back out. I plan to start pinching barbs on a lot of my casting baits this summer. I can vouch that good quality hook cutters will help tremendously. The cheapies I used for years were just that...JUNK...I bought a couple pairs of spring loaded KNIPEX mini-bolt cutters and they go through 7/0 and 8/0 Xstrong trebles with ease. Give me a shout if you don't have a pair and I will send you a link to an online store with the best price I have found for them.Keep on chuckin."
1462615,Campcountry,2012-07-17 11:02:00,164,"I pinch back the barbs on my bucktails. When you get a big bucktail with two trebles and lots of hair in the mouth of a fish that is less than trophy size it is very hard to even see the hooks to get them out. Pinching back the barbs makes the removal process it a lot easier on the fish - and me. Let's face it, with two trebles implanted in a fish's mouth you don't need barbs anyway."
1462627,v-bay gord,2012-07-17 11:19:00,3168,All good suggestions. I agree with pinching barbs. I also try and stay away from baits with more than 2 treble hooks. A big key is to be prepared...unfortunately many people are not.
1462679,Obabikon,2012-07-17 13:27:00,2370,"Yeah, I have a mini set of bolt cutters that are great, and if I struggle to get the hooks out, even in the least... they end up cut. This was more of where I hooked him. 2nd hook buried in the outside under and behind his gills... he must've just side swiped the blades. Was a short fight, and a fast removal... fish still didn't make it. Was an upper 20's ski... Water temp was upper 70's though, and I'm sure that had something to do with it."
