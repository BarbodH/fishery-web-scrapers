1462581,tackleman,2012-07-17 10:04:00,444,as far as i know the bar is not open. the restaurant is still operating and serving one of the best burgers in the northwest.(my opinion only)
1462602,Guest,2012-07-17 10:46:00,0,PI is still open in dryden and the bar has reopened .... the night life is not quite the same (more clothes involved )
