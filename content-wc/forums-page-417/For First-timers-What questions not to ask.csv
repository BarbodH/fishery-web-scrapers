1462034,LOW1,2012-07-16 07:36:00,2828,It took me two years to figure out what flashing green traffic lights mean.
1458693,Dogbreath,2012-07-07 07:17:00,494,"To Walleydave - ""eh"" fits in the grammar rules right beside ""lemme tell you what"""
1459535,oilguy,2012-07-09 12:54:00,257,"I will tell you what eh means..... if you can tell me why most Americans use huh to finish their sentences on rhetorical questions. Hmmm....did I give away the answer?? Lol. When I guided Americans for Deer and Bear, I had the ""Eh"" joke from them every week......they usually dropped it once I pointed out THEIR use of ""Huh"" in every other sentence. As far as gravy goes, I was taken by surprise while traveling in the US. I stopped at a restaurant in Montana and the waitress asked me what kind of gravy I wanted - white or brown. Just a word of advice to anyone traveling to a distant destination. Use a couple of seconds to filter your question before it's too late. If it's still worth asking, then by all means fire away. Dumb questions deserve dumb answers right?"
1459548,wallydave,2012-07-09 13:24:00,2151,"My boat/cabin buddy for my last two trips gave me a coffee mug that mentions some of the same things you bring up oilguy!Eh can be used in any part of the sentence. It is, as you mention, better than say huh or um!It is also a phase to be used with pride when speaking to Americans! Our group will drop the occasional ""eh"" into a conversation in the States, it is like a code, it translates to mean;""man I wish we were back in Ontario!!""Part of traveling is getting to know some of the slang and customs eh!?"
1459555,cuamb,2012-07-09 13:38:00,203,I always wondered about the stacked rocks. I was in Asia last week and saw them in a Budhist temple. Thanks for the link!
1459656,oilguy,2012-07-09 17:06:00,257,"Well said WalleyeDave! Customs, slangs, and traditions sure do change from place to place! My wife and I were in Huatulco, Mexico last year and ended up sitting down for dinner with a couple from Mexico City and another couple from Minnesota. It was a pretty unique conversation comparing our ""everyday lives"" with theirs."
1459744,drlee,2012-07-09 20:39:00,409,"Nothin' wrong with gravy on fries! I put gravy on nearly everything, cause' grandma used to cook the meat so long you needed gravy to chew it...she grew up on the plains of SD when you had BETTER cook meat a long time...she never got over it; neither did I. But, she made the best from scratch ""sticky buns"" you have ever eaten. She is currently baking them for her neighbors in Heaven."

1461094,Guest,2012-07-13 10:15:00,0,To guide herds of caribou along chosen paths? Never heard that one. They do point to food and shelter (no trees to blaze so rocks serve) and mark migration routes etc
1461121,Campcountry,2012-07-13 11:53:00,164,That information comes from an article in a decades old Beaver magazine - the magazine published by the Hudson's Bay Company which was working in the north since the 1600's. The article is about the experiences of an Inuit elder in the early 1900's and he was talking about hunting caribou what the Inukshuks were used for.
1461408,Guest,2012-07-14 10:07:00,0,Yes that makes sense - language problem. Beaver is a great mag ( and Canada's second oldest!) altho they have recently changed the name to Canada's History for obvious reasons.
1457544,SinOrSwim,2012-07-04 08:46:00,1528,Can't remember if it was last year or the year before but we have a group that leave from central iowa and we meet at my brothers north of the twin cities. As we pulled off the main highway to hit the side road to his house he had gone out and stacked up the rocks at the corners we needed to turn. Even though we knew how to get there. It was pretty funny!!! I'm sure there were others at some point who were wondering what the heck those were though. LOL
1457638,Red Pine J,2012-07-04 11:43:00,44,The wiki pic is NO WAY what I've seen in Canada. Good try also Gord........lmao
1457647,new hips,2012-07-04 12:13:00,498,"Similar stone figures were made all over the world in ancient times, but the Arctic is one of the few places where they still stand. An inukshuk can be small or large, a single rock, several rocks balanced on each other, round boulders or flat. Inuit tradition forbids the destruction of inuksuit.IF YOU DESTROY ONE........YOU WILL ONLY CATCH 12in WALLEYE FOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS"
1457676,unclejoe,2012-07-04 13:25:00,22,"On my firstflyin trip I was a little nervous flying on the old bush plane. I asked the owner if they had ever ""lost"" an airplane. He replied quickly, ""yes but we found it the next day."""
1457687,v-bay gord,2012-07-04 13:48:00,3168,My all time best find was 2 bottles of 8 year old Basil Hayden bourbon (one wasn't even open) next to a rock pile on Hwy 502. I think those boys were probably miffed when they stopped the following year.
1457701,Outfitter17,2012-07-04 14:17:00,127,"I agree with Red Pine, SSH is way off on this topic! I have seen nothing like a ""cairns"" rock pile on any of my lakes.SSH - Do you know what kind of rock piles everyone is talking about?"
1457740,new hips,2012-07-04 15:53:00,498,If you stopped at every rock pile on 502.........to look for stash.......it might take you a few days to get to Dryden.
1457874,Campcountry,2012-07-05 06:16:00,164,"The stacked rocks you see are built by kids usually - just for fun. They are supposed to look like Inukshuks which have become a symbol of the north. The real original use of Inukshuks was to guide herds of caribou along chosen paths so the Inuit could kill them. An Inukshuk was built to look like a man and in the old days it was topped with a clump of black earth to look like hair. Another question that I have been asked is ""Why do some restaurants have a sign that says they are ""licensed"" and others do not?"" Licensed restaurants can sell booze. Most tourists are thankful to learn that nugget"
1457928,ScottL,2012-07-05 08:50:00,733,"Although the ones everyone is talking about along the 502 may very well be liquor stashes as Gord claims. There are in fact ""Cairns"" in NW Ontario.I quote from a Lac Seul Map under license from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, ""World War II Memorial Cairns, The Royal Canadian Legion (branch 139) and the members of the Lac Seul First Nation have erected memorial cairns to the 9 Hudson members who sacrificed their lives in the cause of freedom during World War II.""But now that I know the real meaning I'm adding an extra day to my trip to go on a geology field trip, yeah that what we'll call it."

1457099,IaDave,2012-07-03 09:59:00,476,"I was talking to a co-worker who just got back from his first time. It reminded me of my first time and a couple of dumb questions I asked. What do the stacked rocks mean?- outfitter said "" So guys like you can ask us"" What is the weather going to be like?- "" Who knows"". I still find myself asking this one. I'm sure you guys can add to the list but these 2 stand out to me."
1457100,Bob_Loblaw,2012-07-03 10:05:00,109,"I've been up several times, and I still have no idea what the stacked rocks mean (if anything). I do, however, know better than to ask about the weather or the fishing. The weather will be whatever it will be, and the fishing is always great!"

1457115,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-03 10:31:00,235,"The stacked rocks are called inukshuks. They are a tradition of the native Inuit peoples of the far north. They were used as markers of the land and had symbolism too. I don't think it's stupid to ask about them if you are not familiar. I went a few years without knowing what they were. The chief pilot at our outfitter always has snappy answers to all sorts of questions... you know it's not the first time he's used those answers.A common one: Q- ""Are you the pilot?"" A-""No, but they're gonna let me try it today."""
1457118,Lovetofish,2012-07-03 10:34:00,458,I like the question they ask....do you want gravy with your fries? First time my son heard this he busted out laughing. Ever since he's orders fries just to hear it again.
