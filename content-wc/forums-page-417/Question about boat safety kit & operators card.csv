1462386,unclepaully,2012-07-16 20:45:00,112,Are these items required for boats that are provided by an outfitter on a fly-in. Specifically 14ft or 16ft boat. I swear I've read something about a boaters checklist that the outfitter is suppose to provide in place of an actual boat safety card? I was thinking back to the summer of 2010 and the outfitter we went with did not have a boat safety kit or a checklist. Just wondering if this is something I need to purchase before our next trip.
1462403,GNO,2012-07-16 21:25:00,153,The boater safety kit and a checklist or boater safety card are mandatory. Some outfitters provide both these and others don't. Check on this when you book your trip.

Part of the list is checking the safety kit to make sure its onboard. From other posts the operators card is required if you stay over 45 days. I'm sure the link is out there some where!"

The boater safety card can be from any state to be valid or you can get the Canadian boater card. If you operate your own boat in Canada for more than 45 days consecutive you must have the card otherwise you just need to meet your home state requirements."

Yesterday I obtained my Canadian Boating Card through BoatSmartCanada.com. It cost $35.00 and took a few hours to complete the study program and take the final exam. Lots of good information, and now I know for certain what the Canadian Officials expect of me when I am on the water. Shortly after Canada enacted their Firearms Registry, I attended their Firearms Course and obtained my Possession and Acquisition License, and registered my firearms with them. While obtaining those licenses may not be be a realistic option for many USA sportsmen visiiting Canada, we must remember we are guests in that country, and should strive to learn and follow their regulations."
