Have a couple youngsters along, so would like to get them some action. Fishing Sabaskong, Miles, and Obabikon Bays. High water temps bit of a concern. Any information appreciated."

Walleye fishing was good for us. We caught 10 fish over 20inches with the largest being 26. Depth of the fish varied with each location, generally it was 15-17 and 20-23 feet of water. We used jigs with minnows and bottom bouncers with worms. It seemed like bb worked better on the calm days. Pike were found on walleye reefs. The largest that we caught was only 29 inches caught on a bb. We were only able to locate a few smaller pike on the shorelines. The bigger pike were nowhere to be found. Smallmouth were scattered on rocky shorelines and were harder to find as water temp increased as the week went on. Musky were mainly found on rocks, with a few located in the weeds. Lots of follows on smaller crankbaits but the fish just did not want to take a bite. Lost a nice fish on a crankbait after it jumped out of the water. Musky fishing improved a little when storms came through on the last day. Due to the hot weather we found multiple fish belly up along the shore including a 30 inch walleye that would of pushed 31 if we laid it out flat on the bump board. The lodge owner also told us that other groups reported a few good sized musky were also found dead. Make sure to get the large fish back in the water asap. Overall we had a good trip and cant wait to go back up again next year."
