1461990,Guest,2012-07-16 04:40:00,0,"Just returned from 2 week of fishing Water temp main lake 76 degrees and shallow bays 82 degrees Water levels are back to ""normal"" Fuel prices in Ear Falls 1.39 p/ltr Spent most of the time in McKenzie where most of the bigger schools of fish were. Most days fished the 5-10' range. Did find them in the 15-20' a couple of days. Second week the fishing was better than the first week. Only had 1 day that produced over 100 fish. Pulled spinner rigs w/minnows. Throwing cranks for northerns produced a lot of walleye as well. The islands in Mckenzie had the best results for quality of walleye. Reefs held some fish but didn't hold much. Biggest walleye was 26.5"" Northern 34.5 Smallmouth 17"" Did fish Scout lake/bay. Caught more walleye than northerns. Manatoba Pt was good for northerns and walleye. Weather was warm and not much wind. A few isolated storms did pass thru on Thursday/Friday. Only got wet packing to leave. Can't wait till next year!"
