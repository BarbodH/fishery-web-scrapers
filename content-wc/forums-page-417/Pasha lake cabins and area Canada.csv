1456895,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2012-07-02 20:09:00,5533,"I PM'd you this same response Feel free to call me with that question. I went up there in 2010. My dad goes up every year at least once. Sent some friends up there this year and they had a blast (and caught tons of fish). They are not fisherman at all and caught piles of fish all on their own without Chad guiding them. My buddies tackle box is SAD to say the least. The first fish of their trip, his wife nailed a 30"" eye. First pic on this page (chick in the red). http://www.pashalake.com/2012ontariofishingphotos3.htmIf you are renting Chad's boats be sure to bring a Vexilar (or whatever flasher) or a summer boat fish finder. That is extremely helpful (but not needed). Wade"

1457005,2746,2012-07-03 06:48:00,3206,enjoyed the pics and narrative on the 2010 pasha trip Wade. Never been there but sounds like a real adventure!
1461673,Tinyfish,2012-07-15 08:43:00,16,"Just got back from my trip to pasha lake cabins. All i can say is we made a killing on all the four lakes we fished. We caught a bunch of walleye in the 24"" to 30"" size and tons of pike up to 36"". First time to pasha lake cabins and wont be my last."
1462619,Finshady,2012-07-17 11:11:00,12,Tinyfish. Any chance you could provide the lakes you went to. I have been going to pasha for many years. Just curious to know which lakes you got into. I assume Northwind was one of the best
1462644,Tinyfish,2012-07-17 11:50:00,16,"Fished Northwind twice, lake Onaman, Watson and one other lake cant remember the name."
1462693,impartime,2012-07-17 13:58:00,2,"Hi, we are heading to Ontario for a week we were going to the Chapleau area, but there are fir bans currently, do you have any idea of the pasha area? isn't that more into westen ontario. I had heard the western part of the province still allowed camp fires. We have land rovers and small boats. We had hoped to camp and rough it on our own. just wanted to find a little secluded walleye and northern pike action. Any ideas?"
1462698,Tinyfish,2012-07-17 14:16:00,16,We had a couple of shore lunches with a camp fire i hope it was allowed. Pasha lake cabins is east of lake nipigon almost in the centre of ontario. Im not sure but you may need a permit for camping you should look into that. There are many lakes whith excellent fishing.
