1462084,Bob_Loblaw,2012-07-16 09:17:00,109,Two years ago I saw 9 moose in about a 20-mile stretch between IF and Dryden. 19 isn't out of the realm of possibility.

1461270,sammy2964,2012-07-13 20:29:00,17,we took 502 both ways the last week in june and it was smooth w/ no construction.
1461271,Glenman12,2012-07-13 20:29:00,762,drove up on June 13th and back on June 21st and there were no problems..
1461281,dcraven,2012-07-13 20:47:00,47,Thanks!DC
1461305,Ranger319,2012-07-13 22:17:00,166,"I thought 502 was in great shape...except I saw 19 moose, 4 bears and 3 fox on the night trip back. There were two moose running down the sides of the road, I was in a group of 4 vehicles that somehow managed to drive straight between them. I don't think we can hear it enough, once it starts to get dark, slow down and keep your eyes wide open."
1461423,itsme,2012-07-14 11:17:00,31,502 good shape....3 moose...5 deer...no bears nor foxes. Find a logging truck as a lead dog....Works
1461436,rancocasrich,2012-07-14 11:58:00,45,just got back this morning....smooth all the way
