1461472,55walleyes,2012-07-14 14:34:00,131,Just returned from Blackstone Lake with Hidden Bay Lodge. Weather was very hot and fishing was a little slow. We caught fish but just not quite what I am used to. I do think weather was biggest factor in slower than usual fishing. Biggest walleye 25.5 inches. Last year caught at least 10 this big or bigger. A friend did get a 44 inch pig of a northern. I believe it had to be over 25 pounds. Still a good trip. Doesn't get much better than spending 5 days with your 74 year old father that introduced you to the great canadian outpost experience. Hope to return next year.

1461493,55walleyes,2012-07-14 15:46:00,131,Got a big storm Wednesday evening. Damaged the dock a little. Water levels did come up quite a bit. A fire pit on the beach was out of the water before the storms and partially under water the next day.

1461746,55walleyes,2012-07-15 12:31:00,131,We fish the meat hole. A point on way to meat hole. A flat between cabin and the point going to meat hole and a flat between point and meat hole. Have been for last 2 years. Made a trip to Falls each year. Caught fish but not hot and heavy. We have done well in the area where Cat River enters and opens up into big part of lake. Really still trying to figure it out and would appreciate any info. We caught lots of big walleye in the meat hole last year.
1462776,mb386,2012-07-17 17:37:00,14,"Thanks 55walleyes. We fish a lot of the same areas. It is a great lake with an abundance of Walleye and Northern. This was the best year for us. Walleyes were large and fat. Biggest was 27"". We have been in the cabin across from you. One of the guys caught a 39"" Northern off the dock a few years ago. We have also been known to just go to the dock in the early evening and catch a few to fill out dinner. Hope to get back!!"
