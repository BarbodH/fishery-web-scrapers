Caught 870 walleyes which was down somewhat from same trip last year. It was extremely hot(high 80's to low 90's), and we had little or no wind except for one day. Also, we did not fish Thursday or Friday nights because of alot of lightning in the area. We thought these factors contributed to a little bit slower fishing, but it was still decent. Biggest walleye was a 27"" and biggest northern, a 36"" caught on a jig and crawler. We caught most fish on jigs tipped with crawlers or minnows. Most of the fish we caught in 15-20 FOW. Water level seems to be up 2-3 feet over what it was in June. Overall, a great trip. It's a long wait for next June to come!"

1461987,Bitinlight,2012-07-16 04:29:00,95,Stayed at Chamberlain Narrows at Lac Seul Outposts. 9th time I have been there. How was the fishing in Wapesi? Where did you park the houseboat? Probably waived or saw you while we were there.

Sounds like the fish are all over from shallow to deep? What areas did you fish primarily? Any difference in the productivity of minnows vs crawlers? Thanks!"
1462178,Bitinlight,2012-07-16 12:36:00,95,"Fished all our spots from Three Sisters to Little Chamberlain Narrows which include points, islands, and reefs--basic structure. Only had one day of decent wind; the other 4 days were little or no wind. Fish still bit. Looks like we could have fished shallower than 15 FOW according to another post, but didn't. We fished the exact same spots we fished in June, except deeper. 1st couple days we used jigs and minnows, but some guys gave us a whole bunch of crawlers when they left, so we used them the last three days. Didn't seem to make a difference with either bait. Used a little Trigger-X and Gulp Minnows and they worked too. Did have good luck on three evenings from 7:00 till dark. Could not fish the other two evenings due to lightning. Good luck."
