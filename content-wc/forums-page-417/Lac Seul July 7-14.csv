Weather was very hot all week, 80's everyday with a day or two into the low 90's. Very little to no wind all week as well. Fishing was great overall though. Caught walleyes anywhere from 4-25 feet. Had the best of my success casting shad raps right up on shore. Lots of action from the northerns and smallmouths as well. Biggest catches of the trip were: -Walleye: 26 1/4"" -Northern: 13 lbs. (other boat in the group caught it so not positive on the length) -Smallmouth: 17 3/4"" -Muskie: 43"" Water was very warm! had temperatures ranging from 75-80 degrees! Week went very fast as it always does! Can't wait until next year rolls around! Hope everyones year is going good! Kurt"
