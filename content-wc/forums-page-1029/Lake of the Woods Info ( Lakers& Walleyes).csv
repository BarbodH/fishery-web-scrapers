511818,Guest,2001-04-02 09:59:00,0,"Anyone have any tips on LOTW for lakers around the first week in June? We have fished this for about six years, but we would like to find some tactics for lakers in early June. I know the east part of the lake is better, but if anyone is familiar with this we are fishing west of Souix Narrows about 10 to 15 miles. We are thinking of downriggers or soaking or a cisco in 100ft.Any tips, is there decent laker populations bewtween Souix Narrows and Kenora?. We are in the Yellow Girl Bay area.Any help or info greatly appreciated Good FishingLefty"

Early season best, the fish are shallow(troll or set out lines with shiners off islands). Late season deep (troll w downriggers best).Great resorts on Crow that offer LOW access as well(Stevens Bay).Have been fishing this area for over 30 years."

Never fished for the lakers but have caught a few nice ones while trolling for eyes. If the lakers are still up, troll plugs that run in the top ten to twenty feet of the water column."

Forget the downriggers, you really only need them in the fall when they suspend. In Whitefish bay this means that they will be about 70-90 feet down in about 120 feet of water, or at least that has been my experience over the last several years."
511822,Guest,2001-04-03 13:36:00,0,"Thanks guys for the great info!!!!!. BD,do you have any tips about walleyes west of Yellow Girl?. Have you caught suspended fish that early in June? How about big fish how have you done on those, 7 pounds is my best up there so far. I know there are bigger ones there but have not found them. Drop me an e-mail, I might have some spots for you to try. Our biggest fish has come after dark in a narrow slot we found of the big bay looking west of Yellow Girl.Thanks again everyone!!!!!!"
