Lots of excelent fishing close at hand though. www.casablancalodge.com. Brian and Liz run the lodge. I take my 70 year old father every year. they treat us like kings."

Also, www.tallpinescamp.net I stayed there years ago. They are close to the Lake Nipissing/mouth of the French River area. You can't go wrong with either place but Sandy Haven has indoor plumbing and electricity."
