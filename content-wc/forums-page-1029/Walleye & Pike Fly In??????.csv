510064,Abe,2000-10-22 16:39:00,29,"Check out God's lake in Manatoba, there are four lodges on the lake, the one I went to (Elk island lodge) has changed hands and I don't know how it is now but the lake is great for Lake trout, Walleye, Northerns and Brook trout in God's river with plenty of big fish. It was a trip of a lifetime for me. Cost from Winapeg was about $2500.00."
