Any information on the difference between June and August would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance."

I go up in the Spring anyway just for the joy of fishing. I didn't go up last year and probably just as well from what I heard due to the weather but planning on at least 2 trips this year and probably up to Laverdrye park.Good luck,Al"
