511772,Iowa Eye,2001-03-30 07:18:00,104,I have not been there but I have a friend who has been going there once or twice a year for 20 years. If you send me an email I will get you his phone number. [email protected]
511773,Red,2001-03-30 13:43:00,75,"I was there twice. Its a good place to go. Lots of water to fish and lots of adventure. Fishings pretty good, lots of small to medium walleye with the occational big one. Never caught a big pike but I know they are there. The people who own the two resorts are all right, no major complaints except I think they are not very friendly ( mother and father run the american plan resort they are all right, its the son that runs ghost river, I don't think he likes americans to much). But you will have a good time and you will catch alot of fish. I do recamend the place. Good luck Red"
511774,hgf,2001-03-31 13:24:00,199,"Was there about 6 years ago on a father son special. Lots of water, different lakes, and fishing ok, not terrific. Decent accomodations and equipment then. We were there in August. I would go again."
511775,Guest,2001-03-31 19:41:00,0,"I was there with a group at the end of May last year and that is where we are going this year. Lots of water and fifteen portage lakes. Fishing was excellent. We primarily pike fish and they were everywhere. Lots of small fish to weed through to get the big ones, but they were definately there. Our biggest pike was only 40"", but we caught 4 or 5 over 36"" and lots over 30"". I didn't think that was bad for a drive to. Walleyes were thick but I'm not sure we were up there at the right time for big ones. They said smallmouths were almost non-existant, and that they only catch about fifteen a year out of the lake. We tried for them a couple of days and caught 12, 5 or 6 over 18"". The owners at Ghost River are not the freindliest people, The owners (parents)at the other lodge seemed much nicer. Who hangs out at the lodge anyway! Overall I give it an A- and would recommend it to anyone."
511776,Guest,2001-04-01 13:33:00,0,"Loomis-I'm very curious about the unfriendliness of the son. I agree that you aren't going there to spend time in the lodge but, if I'm dropping $1200 I think that you deserve to be treated right. What exactly did he do? I'm mainly interested in catching walleyes, how did other people do? Did you do most of your fishing on the main or portage lakes? Did you do the meal plan, if so how was the food?Thanks,Anvil"
511777,Guest,2001-04-02 10:03:00,0,"We did the housekeeping plan so that's why we spent very little time at the lodge. Other groups did extremely well catching walleyes. I belive the biggest caught while we were there was only 27"", but there are a lot of quality fish over 20"". Not the place to go in my opinion if your looking for trophy walleyes, but if you like catching 100 or so per boat a day it can be done. As far as the son, he wasn't terrible, just not a great personality. It was almost as if he didn't want to be there, or the guests got on his nerves? Maybe it's because we were housekeeping, I don't know."
511778,Red,2001-04-02 17:48:00,75,"Loomis I agree with you, the son has a personallity of a brick. Like he is being asked the same question over and over again! What dose he expect? You have to ask questions when you get there. I liked the place but not him! Red"
511779,Guest,2001-04-02 19:53:00,0,"Yeah Red, I think a brick describes him pretty well. I'll still go there because I love the lake, scenery, fishing, and adventure. If I was paying for the American plan and had to see him every day it would probably be different. The cabins were great for our group, nice and big! With ours being away from the lodge, we rarely see any of the employees. Like I said before too, the parents at the other lodge seemed VERY nice."
511780,Guest,2001-04-03 07:55:00,0,Glad to hear from people that have been to the camp! I looked at this place once and would have went but not now. too many jerks in this world. I sure don't need to go on Vac. with one
