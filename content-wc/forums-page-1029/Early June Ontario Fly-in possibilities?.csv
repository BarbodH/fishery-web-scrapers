That would be a good meeting point for us both. We are looking for mostly big northern pike. We can catch all the walleyes we want home here in ND. It would be pretty catch and release on the Northers, and probably only keep enough walleye to eat while we're there. Any suggestions would be appreciated. thanks"

Trophy Northerns, Muskies, walleye, and Small Mouth Bass. We still have a couple of openings in June, but call soon."
