511377,Guest,2001-03-07 11:00:00,0,Can anyone tell me a little about the Cabonga Res. in Quebec? When is the best time to go? Is the walleye fishing good? Is the extra fishing permit worth it?
511378,Guest,2001-03-30 18:53:00,0,Hi Joe;Good Walleye and good lakers. If you're staying at the cabins you'll have great hospitality. I was there in 99 but didn't stay at the cabins. The best area for walleyes seem to be around the inlet at the Eastern end of the reservoir.Most important--have a great time!!Al
511379,Guest,2001-03-31 02:54:00,0,Joe i haven't fished cabonga in a long while. I now live at the edge of the bay of quinte! However the fishing is good. The whole area of laverendreye park is great. Many areas to camp/fish. The quebec fishing license is expensive. The sceneryis great and it's quiet. If you are going travel through the park to barrage dozois [dozois dam]. The fishing below the dam can be AMAZING. One early june 15 years ago my wife and i caught 112 walleye in twodays from shore!Good luck larry
