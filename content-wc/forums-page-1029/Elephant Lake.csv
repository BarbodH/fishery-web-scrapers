511760,Guest,2001-04-02 09:54:00,0,Elephant lake is in the Almaquin Highlands and is the only lake their that contains musky. It is a very weedy lake I hear. I have never fished their so I can't be to much help.
511761,Guest,2001-04-02 18:17:00,0,"There are alot of weed beds in this lake. Spinner baits worked in and around the weeds will connect you with Largemouth bass, walleye and a fair amount of Musky. Enough of them that you will lose some of your spinnerbaits unless you use a leader, but then you will catch alot less walleye and bass.White with some red and yellows work well."
