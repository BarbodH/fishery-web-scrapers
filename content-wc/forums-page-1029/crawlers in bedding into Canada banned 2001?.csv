511392,Guest,2001-03-07 15:42:00,0,I heard a rumor that this year you are not allowed to take nightcrawlers packed in bedding into Canada this year. Can anyone set me straight on this please? Thanks.
511393,Guest,2001-03-08 08:41:00,0,"I haven't heard this and I was planning on taking a few dozen crawlers through Fort Frances in July. I have always heard that if you are tranporting crawlers they have to be in bedding. Depending on the time you are going over the border, I know there is a bait shop in Fort Frances."

I went to the site and printed out a copy for my own reference. I learned a lot. Be sure to read it before you plan your trip. If you still have some questions regarding the law, contact the OMNR and ask them.good fishing to you all."
