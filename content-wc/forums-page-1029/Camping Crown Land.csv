511768,Guest,2001-03-29 15:27:00,0,"ng In Ontario, travel for recreational purposes on Crown lands and waters is generally free and unrestricted. Generally, camping is allowed free on Crown land for up to 21 days per year except where otherwise restricted or posted as no camping. However, some Crown lands have restricted travel zones for forest fire prevention, officially closed forest access roads and areas posted with signs to prohibit all or certain kinds of travel. Non-residents of Canada who are 18 years of age or older require a permit to camp on Crown lands in northern Ontario, north of the French and Mattawa rivers. A non-resident Crown Land Camping Permit fee is $10.00 per night per visitor 18 years of age and older. Crown Land Camping Permits are available from numerous fish and wildlife licence issuers and from the Ministry of Natural Resources district offices in northern Ontario. Non-residents of Canada who own property in Ontario, and their immediate family, do not require permits. Charitable and philanthropic groups may be eligible for exemptions. (Please contact the MNR office that serves the area for details.) Non-residents who use the services of an Ontario tourist outfitter do not require a permit. Contact your local MNR office or licence issuer for permits. Modified 1-May-00 Â© Queen's Printer for Ontario, 2000"
