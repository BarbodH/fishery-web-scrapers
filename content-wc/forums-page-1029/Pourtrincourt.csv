We had a cabin on the most remote part of lake baude. water was low but had little trouble getting in. Saw osprey, loons ,eagles,mink. A good trip, good staff and I would go again someday."
511065,Indio,2001-02-11 20:01:00,12,I have heard nothing bad about Domaine Poutrincourt in North Central Quebec. Can anyone confirm how good this place is or I am not looking deep enough to find anything bad?
511066,Guest,2001-02-12 09:24:00,0,"i'm going this summer. lst time. so far everything appears as it seems. i had a good talk at the port washington show, i am in contact with another person who's been there. the testimonials say a lot of good things and i plan to phone contact a number of these people. keep digging. it never hurts!p"
511068,Guest,2001-02-12 15:08:00,0,"talked to a guy at the sports show last week and he said he would not recommend this lodge..Nothing personal, but he claims that the fishing does not justify the cost.. All walleye caught were small and it is not isolated/private as they claim..."
511067,Indio,2001-02-13 09:33:00,12,"Patrick, thanks for the feedback, when are you planning to go up. Our trip is planned for mid August and this will be our 1st time there also. I have a few things I want to exchange with you and will e-mail soon."
511069,Indio,2001-02-13 09:40:00,12,"Hank, thanks for the feedback, but I have a few questions. What sport show was that at? What time of the year did he go? What camp did he stay in? I know that every place, everytime will not be fishing nirvana, there are fishing variables that effect even the most productive waters. I guess I'll have to see for myself. We'll find the real skinny and I will post my findings. Stay tune!"
511070,Hank,2001-02-13 18:17:00,9,"Sportshow was at Harrisburg Penn. Eastern Outdoors and Sports Show. I just happened to be talking to a salesman for triton boats and the subject of Canada trips came up. I have nothing in it but what I heard from this man who claims to go to Canada for fishing and once tried this place, 2 Years ago. I was the one that pressed him for info on this lake and lodge, so I believe he was honest in his discription and not bitter. Also, I understand that not everyone can be satisfied and how am I to know what level of compitence this guy was in fishing. Alot of variables and this is from someone I do not know. But he claims that the walleye were small and the lake is not private as they advertise. To me, that was good info to know. I wish you the best of luck in finding what you look for."
511071,Indio,2001-02-14 09:27:00,12,"Hank, thanks for the follow up. It is really appreciated. Nothing in this world is 100% good or bad. So our group will find out and I will post on this site how we did and the conditions we fished in, along with other points of the trip. For those of us that invest the time and money on these trips any info that one can pick is valuable. Each case must be weighed and evaluated for an outfitters overall merit. I have been at Ceasars Lodge ( Gouin Res. ) twice. Our 1st time there was excellent, for what we wanted, totally remote and private, with good fishing. But our 2nd trip to the same place was just average as compared to our 1st time. The weather in this case made all the difference. Where have you gone on past trips and what has been your favorite to date?"
511072,Ed,2001-02-15 03:25:00,143,Indigo; I will be spending a week at cearars lodge this august.Did you have any problems with this outfitter.any info you could give me would be greatly appreciated.Ed
511073,Indio,2001-02-15 10:09:00,12,"Ed, I do have alot to tell you about Ceasars. I will E-mail you soon. What lake will you be fishing at? We also went in August. No black flies or even mosquitos, lots of mice tho. Bring yourself a couple of mouse traps, we caught over a dozen each week. One ran over my friends head while he was sleeping, I still laugh my ##### off at him jumping out of that sleeping bag like he was hit with 10,000 volts. Talk to ya later."
511074,Guest,2001-02-26 16:15:00,0,"I HAVE BEEN GOING THERE FOR YEARS. TRUE THE FISH ARE NOT ALL 5 POUNDERS BUT TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE. THE LODGE IS RESTRICTED TO THE CAMPS ON IT AND IT IS UNUSUAL TO BE FISHING NEAR ANYONE ELSE. IF THE GUY SAYS THE FISHING IS NOT GOOD,HE'S NOT A WALLEYE FISHERMAN OR DID HE MEAN PIKE? THE FACILITIES ARE FIRST RATE AND THE OWNER CARES."
