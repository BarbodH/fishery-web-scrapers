Go to www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca for a listing of resorts and phone #'s. I stay at Lac Seul's Evergreen Lodge and Lac Seul's Golden Eagle, both are very close to Ear Falls."

I can not argue with the previous reply, but I have always stayed at Goldpines. They run a great camp. 1-800-977-0041 http://red-lake.lakeheadu.ca/~goldpineEmail: [email protected]"

All of their camp are on the northeastern area of the lake. Their number is:1-800-465-1098. They also have an excellent lodge accomodations for fishing out of the lodge.I can't speak for the western portion of Lac Seul, but where we always fish, around Chamberlain Narrows, the fishing is excellent.Best get on the ball and call somewhere as they book early in the year.Good luck...eyesnatcher"
