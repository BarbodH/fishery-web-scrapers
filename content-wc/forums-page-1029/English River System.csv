While I suspect the lodges entire mailing list got such a flyer, I'm still tempted. I just have to bring one friend with me. Any of you know the English River? What month would you recommend for walleyes? I'd appreciate any information."
511808,BD,2001-04-02 08:30:00,739,Which lodge was it? Where? The English River covers a lot of territory and a lot of lakes.
511809,Guest,2001-04-02 08:45:00,0,I would imagine that it was Naughty Pines--I rec. one as well from the Walleye Expo. I heard that prices are a little inflated and they may not be totally honest with exacly what is included in the package. Im going to confront them on these aspects then make my dec.
511810,Guest,2001-04-02 13:02:00,0,That's correct it was the Naughty Pines Fish Camp. Inflated prices? Not honest on what the package includes? Do you have any specifics? I could just as easily stay at another lodge. Anybody have a nice lodge with a reasonably priced housekeeping package that you'd recommend. Quality of fishing experience is the biggest consideration.

511813,Hawgman,2001-04-03 09:52:00,18,"My nephew ""won"" the same thing last year and took his father-in-law with him. They said the camp was okay, but certainly not great. Glad they only had to pay for one. The fishing was on the slow side for them....even the day they hired a guide. But they said one group in camp found a dropoff the held some really big 'eyes."
511814,PWaldow123,2001-04-03 10:11:00,198,Naughty Pines Resort has been the topic of several threads on this site and on others. Search the archives but not a lot of good comments on it.
511815,Glenn,2001-04-03 12:33:00,17,"My son and I went to Naughty Pines 2 years ago in July. The fishing was quite good in taht we caught all the eyes we wanted and some of them in the 23-27 inch range. Personally saw the group that had 3 10+ eyes during the week.In regards to the price....the second person is really paying about twice what they should so if the other is free....I suppose it comes out as about right for the both of you....but nobody won anything!!!Overall, I felt it was a pretty good trip....but don't take the american plan...ate at the lodge one night and certainly nothing to write home about."
