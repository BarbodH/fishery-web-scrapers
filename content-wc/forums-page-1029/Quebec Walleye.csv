511551,Guest,2001-03-19 10:23:00,0,My wife and I are trying to plan a trip to Quebec this summer to both camp and fish. We are looking for a campground that is on either a lake or river that will give us a chance to catch both pike and walleye. Any info would be greatly appreciated.Thank You
511552,Guest,2001-03-21 02:07:00,0,"LaVerendrye Park offers a number of camp/fish opportunities. There is a booklet available by contacting the Dept. of Natural Resources. Be advised, however, that you'll be subject to some nasty black flies or mosquitoes, depending on the time of year. A friend of mine has been traveling from Florida to Quebec for the past 20 years and has had much success catching pike and small walleye. Personally, a flush toilet, hot water, refrigeration, electricity and a soft bed help make the whole Quebec fishing experience far more appealing. Besides, the fishing camps are generally set up on lakes or systems where trophy fish are likely. Many of them have outpost sites which offer a good compromise of solitude and comfort (and excellent fishing)."

Northwest of Montreal click on La Vérendrye. Then it's all up to you depending on the information you need. Welcome to beautiful Québec. rawburt"

The fishing isn't as great as it used to be because of the fishing pressure now but I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you need any further information, feel free to email me.Al"
