We will be bringing our own boat, an 18' with an 80hp. We are looking for numbers of fish, not necessarily size. Thanks,Walleyehawger"

You can also catch northern pike, small mouth bass, jumbo perch, whitefish and huge lake trout. Wilf Shesheguin has cottages all over the lake, Ernie Martel has cottages on the lake in the town of Missanabie, there are more lodges on the lake but they are remote for your wives and babies. You will be secluded on this lake with the nearest town (WAWA) 75 miles away there is no shopping for the ladies."
