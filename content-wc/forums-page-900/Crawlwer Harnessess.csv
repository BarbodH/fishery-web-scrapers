527743,bronzeback77,2003-02-17 08:29:00,97,We fish LOW every May-June and I wanted to start tying my own harnessess. What pound line should I use? Has anyone used Fireline for this purpose? Looking forward to any help you can give me.
527744,Bryan,2003-02-17 08:49:00,244,"I generally use 4-6# mono for the harness with braided line on the reel. I have also quit building them ahead of time. Seem's the fish never bite what I have tied and I'm builing them in the boat to suit the need at the time. Got that tip from a good friend for free, so I'll pass it along to you."
527745,Guest,2003-02-17 16:31:00,0,"If you are speaking of spinner rigs for crawlers, I would recommend using 12-14lb or heavier line. (I like berkley XT)Picture what is going on down there.This is not a finesse presentation. You need line strength to hold up to the punishment the spinner rig will be exposed to as it is pulled along the bottom through debris, rocks, etc.I have Fireline on my reel, but I use mono for the rig, itself.I use Fireline on the reel because it has a small diameter to cut down water resistance, thereby getting the bait deeper, quicker. (better control)IMHO...at least."

527747,ggg,2003-02-17 21:33:00,115,For years I have used 12 lb. mono. Only complaints I ever had was all the bite offs from pike. Now over the years I built up a couple of hundred rigs and I started to notice that some of the older ones were getting very brittle from old age. So this last winter I retied all using 10 lb. fireline. Have not had any problems since but someone forgot to tell the pike that they can't bite that stuff off !Best Fishes .
