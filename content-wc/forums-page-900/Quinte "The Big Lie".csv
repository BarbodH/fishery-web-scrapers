527683,McQ,2003-02-14 12:45:00,615,"As a sign the ministry is committed to the walleye in Quinte, he announced Friday he has appointed Tom Worven, the former provincial chairman of Ducks Unlimited, to head a new fisheries advisory committee in Quinte comprised of local representatives. Ouellette said he and Worven will meet with Chief R. Donald Maracle of Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte by month's end to discuss native fishing issues before the advisory committee is convened. Ernie Parsons, Prince Edward-Hastings MPP and MNR critic at Queen's Park has been fighting to get the annual report for months and accused the ministry of shielding the fish count to avoid admitting it had created a crisis needlessly in Quinte. He claimed the ministry knew a year ago the walleye population was healthy but still moved to paint a dismal picture that, said Parsons, has hurt tourism deeply and lost Quinte jobs in seasonal industries. The ministry repeatedly denied his requests for the report, he said. We said at the time; Give us the data you used to come up with 160,000.' We didn't get it because they didn't have the numbers. They didn't have accurate numbers, said Parsons in an interview. The Eves government deliberately delayed providing the information that they gathered, leaving businesses, anglers and those in the tourist trade in turmoil. It seems obvious that the MNR delayed releasing the fish numbers when they discovered that the local stakeholder information was more accurate than their own. Some of the local counts were provided by anglers belonging to Citizens Against Walleye Moratorium that rallied for three public meetings in the spring of last year in Trenton, Belleville and Napanee. Citizens group spokesman Kendall Dewey is a commercial fisherman who, by his own estimates last year using hoop nets on the bay, counted the adult walleye stocks as high as 475,000. Dewey was angry, Friday, that the MNR report's numbers showed there was a healthy population after such widespread panic in Quinte among restaurant owners, bed and breakfast proprietors and outrigging companies that depend on the influx of tourists and anglers every year. I think they delayed the release of the report because they were worried they would fail to show there was a conservation issue here, said Dewey. There never was a crisis, there isn't a crisis. This is a very healthy (walleye) population. A number of 400,000 is more fish than spawning areas can handle in the bay. The new number, said Dewey, should force the MNR to end its walleye restrictions on the bay for recreational fishing, an issue that should be first and foremost for a new advisory committee that may not be needed after all. Parsons, meanwhile, reiterated his call upon Ouellette to fix the public image damage that has been done by the government to a fishery once prized by anglers all over North America. He said the government should pay for a series of advertisements that announce that the Bay of Quinte is open for walleye fishing once again. This article appeared in The Belleville Intelligencer on Saturday February 8, 2003."
527684,retire55,2003-02-14 13:41:00,1029,"McQ:What's your point?Surely, you're not suggesting that reasonable objective parties should discard official published scientific MNR data in favour of wild a$$ guesses by one commercial fisherman and a blustry old MPP.IMHO, the Intelligencer article did not objectively present all facets of the data available in the 2001 reports (e.g. chapters 13, 14 and 15). You can read these reports at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/mnr/pubs/la...eport2001.htmlIts rather interesting to note that when MNR biologists estimated the walleye population as too low to sustain current harvests, the MNR was resoundly criticized for inaccurate estimating methods. Now, with most recent estimates of the BOQ walleye population being somewhat more favourable, folks are applauding MNR methodologies. Just makes one wonder.The local MPP's call for the government (taxpayers) to offset costs of ""a series of advertisements that announce that the Bay of Quinte is open for walleye fishing again"" is comical at best. While I can empathize somewhat with commercial operators, these businesses have done little but set up shop to cash in on a natural resource and they provide little if any financial support to the maintenance of the fishery (e.g. the Special Purpose Account (hunting and fishing licence fees) that provides for over 70% of the annual fish and wildlife management budget for the MNR). Just one more important point - the Bay of Quinte walleye fishery was never closed.The most important information, IMHO, in this recently released report, is the confirmation that a portion of the BOQ Aboriginal community was responsible for over 80% of the total 2001 BOQ walleye harvest (on a biomass basis). Acceptability of such inequitable harvests is a more worthy discussion."

527686,McQ,2003-02-15 08:48:00,615,"I, in my own way of drawing conclusions am somewhat concerned that this whole MNR study had a political motivation and has settled on challenging the aboriginal fishery with what is at best flawed methods of appraisal. There are just too many incidences of may be's, could have's, etc to represent a truly scientific study. It is just too easy to set up the wrong target.The measuremnt methods at best were a shot in the dark. The glaring example of this is the admission by the study that an actual count of what the aboriginal harvest was is based soley on a series of guesses and limited observation with no factual work application. To further add to the confusion of supposed validity of the study was the unexplained delay in making any of the numbers available in a timely fashion. It doesn't take a year and a half to prepare and summarize results for public consumption unless there is a political side issue involved. I believe that the work and the methods utilized by the MNR is now suspect. The variance in reported numbers is too huge to ignore.If you want me to buy into the results of a study, particularly one of this magnitude then give me hard facts not suppositions.What may be the affect of the zebra issue and the changes to the fishery that could have bearing on this whole supposed decline in stocks. It wouldn't be the first time a large percentage of fish remained in Lake Ontario for a spawn period. Walleye will habitate where they are comfortable, to the best of my knowledge they don't have a need to home in on implanted waters for proliferation."
527687,retire55,2003-02-15 11:55:00,1029,"McQ:Thanks for responding and for your clarification.Without question, measuring/estimating walleye populations isn't an exact science. At best, the MNR biologists can only realistically establish ranges for fish populations (e.g. could be as low as, could be as high as, probably is close to). I prefer to use estimations based on research (accepting that it could be flawed to some degree) rather than on gut feeling. Although retired now, I conducted microbiological research for 15 years. And though hard evidence was always the objective, many times, indications were all we obtained. Indeed, the USA is probably going to go to war with Iraq over ""indications"".I concur with your suggestion that there may be political interference at work although I wouldn't agree that the MNR has settled on challenging the aboriginal fishery. I have read nothing over the last two years that would support that line of thought. If you can provide reference information to the contrary, it would be appreciated. While it is true that ""an actual count of what the aboriginal harvest was is based solely on a series of guesses and limited observation with no factual work application"", is it possible to do anything else? Those responsible for the Aboriginal walleye gillnet fishery have not demonstrated any willingness to accurately account for harvest levels. One might ask why should they? Particularly, when it is common knowledge that all levels of government are reluctant to take on the issue of Aboriginal fishing rights. As an example of a lack of cooperation, consider that the harvest levels from spearing on the Salmon River are no longer shared with MNR research staff. If the BOQ Aboriginal community is convinced that MNR harvest numbers attributed to Aboriginals are in error, then prove it. Indeed, I have questioned why such numbers were not routinely recorded as a potential defence against MNR claims. You commented ""It is just too easy to set up the wrong target"". Consider that as a result of BOQ walleye harvest estimates for 2000, the MNR implemented reduced limits and a slot limit for recreational fishermen. No changes were made to Aboriginal fishing. Consequently, who got targetted? As I have tried to indicate, I'm in favour of all fishers being able to fish. I just don't support the notion that one segment of our community has a right to a bigger share than any other segment. I don't know how much confidence we can place in the harvest numbers reported by the MNR. However, I do have grave concerns if their numbers approximate reality."
527688,McQ,2003-02-15 15:14:00,615,"It is always a good thing to challenge what is suspect, now here's the rest of the story in fact the beginning of the published article:Ouellette denies delay of walleye reportAuthor: Derek Baldwin Source: The Bellville Intelligencer February 13, 2003The walleye storm appears over. Last year, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) warned the local walleye population was on the brink of collapse and could be as low as 160,000 adults in the Bay of Quinte. The prospect led to catch restrictions last May when the walleye season  worth $24 million annually locally  opened to skeptical anglers. But, an 11-month-old MNR study released Friday contradicts the earlier ministry position. Instead of supporting desperate calls for conservation measures to protect a dwindling population, sections of the new MNR report state there is a healthy walleye population in the Bay of Quinte. The 2001 Lake Ontario Annual Report states walleye stocks locally will stabilize, are not in any apparent threat of crashing and, at last estimate, number 401,000 to 402,000 strong in Quinte waters. The findings by biologists J. Bowlby and J. Hoyle contend that instead of a crisis in Bay of Quinte waters, the population was leveling off for 2002 and 2003. They claimed that after seven lower year classes, the population reached an age structure that will provide stability for at least the next two years. The three-year old and older population of walleye in Eastern Lake Ontario on Jan. 1, 2001, was estimated at 401,000-402,000, well above the 160,000 critical stock size defined by (J.) Stewart... The discrepancy isn't boding well for Gerry Ouellette, Minister of Natural Resources and his officials under fire by local politicians and anglers since word of possible three-moratorium on walleye fishing first leaked out in the fall of 2001. Anglers say conflicting numbers only confirmed their suspicions there was something fishy last March when the ministry did not release its 2001 Lake Ontario Annual Report just as it has every spring for years. When local anglers were repeatedly denied copies of the reports some openly queried whether the report was kept back because it contained fish population figures that did not gel with new walleye restrictions. In an interview with The Intelligencer, Friday, Minister of Natural Resources Gerry Ouellette denied the allegations but said he couldn't give a definitive explanation why the report was released 11 months after its usual publication date. What could have been the benefit of delaying that information? I can't think of any reason not to release it, said Ouellette. When Ouellette assumed the natural resources portfolio in April, he said the report was still not on his desk ready for public release. From my perspective, all of the information wasn't gathered in time for me, he said, adding that the delay could have been attributed to the transition of ministers in natural resources. He confirmed there was a peer review of the report to be sure of its correctness. Ouellette also took issue with the 160,000 population number used by ministry staff last year and quoted repeatedly in the media. Ouellette said he was told last year the population of walleye was roughly 320,000 and that an even stronger new estimate of 400,000 could be due to the ministry's conservation efforts last year to limit the harvesting of pregnant females. We're up to 400,000 which is a good indicator. My position is we're moving forward and seeing better results. Hopefully, the changes we made are adding to that, said Ouellette."
527689,retire55,2003-02-15 16:48:00,1029,"McQ:Yes, I too read the article that appeared in The Intelligencer by Derek Baldwin. As well, I read chapters 13, 14 and 15 (pertinent to walleyes) of the recently released 2001 report.I observed that the Baldwin article did not objectively represent all facets of the data presented in the MNR reports and emailed The Intelligencer to that effect. If you have read these reports and believe Baldwin fairly represented all the MNR data in his article, then we'll just agree to disagree. Regardless our opinions, I appreciated the opportunity to dialogue on the topic."
527690,bigfish1965,2003-02-15 20:47:00,3210,"WHo, if anyone, would dare to take on the Aboriginal issue? It may be about time we figured it all out once and for all. While I fully support natives and their treaty rights, we should try and figure out where the balance of resource use is going. Why would we as anglers spend time and money on a particular resource if we are not to be the primary beneficiary? I'm not trying to push them, I just want to know where the law stands, once and for all, and deal with it. If BOQ is to be a native fishery, so be it. Then at least we know and we can find somewehre else to place our time and effort."
527693,retire55,2003-02-18 08:23:00,1029,"Hello David:I take a look at quintefishing.com every day. I can remember the huge number of posts there when the MNR first announced the idea of a 3 year moratorium on walleye fishing in the BOQ. Consequently, it is more than a little surprising that since the release of the 2001 harvest data, there have been no comments on that board about the fact that the 2001 BOQ walleye harvest numbers confirm harvest inequities between Aboriginal and non Aboriginal fisheries reported in the 2000 Lake Ontario Management Unit annual report. I don't understand what this lack of any comment signifies. Perhaps the Quinte community has resigned itself to the permanence of such inequities (although I am aware that some have taken measures into their own hands). I'm also disappointed that Jerry Ouellette has not been inundated with letters from irate recreational fishers venting their displeasure with slot limits that protect 5 and 6 year old walleyes only to fall prey to spears and gill nets this spring. The rationale escapes me."
527694,Dan,2003-02-19 11:33:00,325,"A couple of points to clarify. The population estimate put forth at the orginal ""stakeholders"" meeting I attended was presented as... somewhere as high as 320,000 to as low as 160,000... This number was based on data that only included walleye 3 yrs and older( standard practise). At the same time there was a very successful year class spawn which was NOT quite 3yrs old and was not included in the numbers. That particular year class turned 3yrs in 2001 and was included in the recent update and accounts for the healthier numbers.Most people know the slot limit is a joke. From a conservation measure on the sportfishing side at least we can say we are doing our part. I don't believe you will ever see the spears put away but one can hope the nets will dissappear based on actions within the MBQ community last spring. It has been said often that the MBQ in general don't like what they are seeing with the nets and infact took action to remove a number of nets this past spring. Hopefully we will see more of that in the future.One other comment regarding the delay of the report. I was told the reasons were because of a few things( not saying I believe it). First the opseu strike caused a delay in the creation of the report, second the numbers had to be independently verified and third was the commercial whitefish fishery which is reported in the annual report. The data for the whitefish has not been good for the past number of years and so the commercial netters lost most or all of their quota. When the commercial netters were told this they took some political action. The MNR in turn cancelled the release of the report and recheked the whitefish numbers and had them independently verified. Once all the i's were dotted and t's crossed the report was released. It's all a big soap operaWith the announcement of the chair appointment for the BOQ fishery advisory committee I asked if the MBQ were onboard and was told they had been invited by the Minister but no commitment from the MBQ was forth coming."
527691,McQ,2003-02-15 21:12:00,615,JayAgreeing to disagree is the way of all good debate and I have a feeling you are quite good at it. I am sure we will have a few chances to voice our thoughts as this story develops and now that some of the motivations on the part of the government are becoming a little clearer just maybe we will be able to add something meaningful. I would hate to see an issue that is as important as this one is become just another dumping ground for the hatred and ill advised comments that have preceded all attempts so far to deal with this complex and historically correct situation.Minister Oulette's comment regarding a peer review within the MNR to assure the correctness of the figures is just the tip of the iceberg. We have two extremes here supported by respected biologists in the field to sort through and time will allow for a truer picture to emerge.
527692,Superdad,2003-02-18 07:21:00,64,This is a good discussion on the MNR data and the results of the 2001 decision to almost cancel the fishing.Might have been good at Quintefishing.comJust a thoughtDavid aka SuperdadDavid Delcloo aka Superdad
