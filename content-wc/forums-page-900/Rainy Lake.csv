I have fished the lake for years for walleye but have only caught crappies in one off situations, so what im wondering is if anyone knows of a good guide that could help us out. Thanks for your help."

If you can't find a guide try the deep (30-40)shoreline cliff areas in Black Sturgeon Bay. I've seen some nice stringers come out of BSB. Porters used to be a good early crappie spot, but now you can't fish there until June. TGG"
