527776,Guest,2003-02-17 16:54:00,0,Does anyone have info on what taxes would apply to purchasing a used boat from the U.S.Thank you in advance
527777,McQ,2003-02-17 17:10:00,615,Whatever provincial taxes where you live and GST. There is no duty.
527778,musky master,2003-02-17 19:27:00,2,I believe that GST will be collected as you bring the boat into Canada.....you can also have the boat registration done at the same time for no additional cost at the border. Unless you plan on contacting the provincial government I do not think you will pay any provincial tax.
527779,Fitch,2003-02-17 21:34:00,75,If there is a trailer involved you will also have to pay a $ 230 fee to the MTO to be sure it meets all the Canadian regs. Sort of a money grab for them.
