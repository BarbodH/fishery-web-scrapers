527819,Guest,2003-02-19 09:07:00,0,I got mine at http://www.justfishontario.com/our_store.htmand they are $22.95 for a bulk order of twenty five including the weight snaps. Plus you can mix and match which sizes you would like and they are authentic Quick Change products. I see they got bulk snells with Quick Change blade clevis available too as well as complete kits. I thought in comparing the two sites that this was easiest and less expensive when you total up everything such as taxes and shipping.
