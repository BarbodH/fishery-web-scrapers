527768,Guest,2003-02-17 10:36:00,0,I'm thinking about a trip to O'Sullivan Lake Lodge and was wondering if anyone has stayed there or fished the lake? Would love to here about it.[email protected]
527769,Peekay,2003-02-17 12:43:00,7,"Do a search on the Canada forum for ""Sullivan"" and click the ""search archives"" option....there are many previous threads about O'Sullivan as I was considering going there this summer. Lots of positive feedback from others in these threads & any communication i've had with the owners have been very helpful. In the end, we decided to go 4 hrs. further north to the Gouin Reservoir.Good luck,PK"

Other years are simply pure joy. The walleye are plentiful and the chance for landing the big one have not diminished in all those years. Each trip presents new opportunities as there are literally hundreds of spots that hold fish under different conditions. We've caught them using all the basic techniques. Northerns are fat and angry, much of the time. My personal best is a 24 lb slob that was released (as are all our pike)and we can always count on the 10lb to 15lb guys totake a lure now and then. The accommodations are comfortable with electricity, indoor facilities, clean lodging, and a staff that is helpful and lets you do your thing. There have been some comments regarding the journey up the Clova Road. In years past we have flown in. But after our first drive in, about 15 years ago, we've actually come to enjoy the trip because we don't push it too hard and have come to expect the inevitable and unforseen breakdowns, washouts and delays. We haven't lost one yet, as they say. To sum up: It's a great experience that offers everything one might expect from a fishing trip into remote Quebec. Enjoy.Thunderstick"
