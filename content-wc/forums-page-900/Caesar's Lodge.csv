If this interests you, contact me at [email protected]"
527264,Guest,2003-02-17 09:12:00,0,Have you been there before and what Lake are you going to? I have been there twice. Let me know.
527265,Guest,2003-02-18 20:20:00,0,"Art,I was there for the first time last year at Lake Larouche. We had pretty good success catching walleye and pike. The guys I was up with last year are not returning until 2004. I want to book for a week sometime in July of 2003. I won't know for sure what lake until I know what is still available, and that someone is seriously interested in joining me. Then we can discuss it. RG"
527266,Guest,2003-02-19 11:27:00,0,I was at super twice. One time was alot better than the other. I have heard that lake you talked about and have talked to guys who have been there. Do you drive clova road to the base camp and fly from there. I hate that road. Thats one of the reason i have not gone back there. other than that we had good trips.

I'e talked to guys who have tried all three route options and they said by far it's worth the extra money to take the plane from Ste-Veronique, and avoid the long drive to the Coursol Base along Clova Road. You do enough driving to get to Ste-Veronique as it is."
