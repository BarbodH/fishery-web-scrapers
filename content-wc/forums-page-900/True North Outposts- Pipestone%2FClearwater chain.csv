527773,Guest,2003-02-18 13:48:00,0,The people that own it are really nice and have a great place. You might have to travel to catch fish. I would recommend fishing with one of the sons the first day to help get on the fish.

You got to look around the 22-25 foot zone on some of the midlake reefs.....but be careful the reefs are very hitable...just look for the seagulls, they usually sit on top of them. Also a good chance to catch some huge muskie...saw one there one night that gave me the chills."
