527141,the badger,2003-01-30 23:42:00,0,I was talking with a friend at work today and he was telling me about someone he knows that recently went to Canada for a trade show of some sort and had to obtain a Visa in order to get into the country.I hope this doesn't mean we will need the same for our annual fishing trip.You never know these days with war looming and terrorism a constant possibility. Has anyone else heard anything about this?

It's good to have a copy of your birth certificate but I've never needed to show it. Sometimes I've had lots of questions asked when I return to the U.S. but that's to be expected in these times. Just remember that these customs/immigration people are doing their jobs. Occasionaly you'll encounter one of them who's having a bad day but I've learned to just brush it off. The good people I've done business with in Canada far outweigh any bad experiences at the border.Have fun on your trip.

527145,Peanut,2003-01-31 08:54:00,929,"No. The only way a Visa would be required would be if the guy was going to stay/work in Canada for an extended period of time (ie: months).For holiday travellers from the US, the same rules apply - Passport is always good, but a birth cert. and drivers licence will usually do.derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals....

527146,Guest,2003-02-19 17:26:00,0,"Just a minute peanut. If the guy was from Brazil, you're saying he don't need any credentials. You only assumed this person was from the US. Right? G. Giant"
527147,bigfish1965,2003-02-19 22:49:00,3210,"Certainly Americans do not need visas to enter Canada for pleasure, however that is not true for every country. Many visitors from non-Commonwealth countries do need visas for visits."
527148,Peanut,2003-02-20 10:09:00,929,"Correct, I apologize for the unstated assumption. My comments are, I believe, valid if the person in question is from the US. I cannot speak for Brazilians.... ;)derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals.... Except the weasel."" - H.J. Simpson"

527150,Guest,2003-02-21 04:56:00,0,I crossed at International Falls into Canada and back last week and a drivers liscense was all that was required.
