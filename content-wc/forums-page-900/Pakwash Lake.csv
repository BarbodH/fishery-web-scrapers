I looked at the recent discusion regarding Pakwash and other lakes. I was hoping that someone may give me some pointers on fishing for quality fish on Pakwash or Canada in general? We generaly troll bottom bouncers in the shallows. Thanks and good fishing."
527868,Guest,2003-02-20 14:31:00,0,I have fished Pakwash for a lot of years and I agree the bottom bouncers work great for the fast action kind of fishing. I choose to use a jig a minnow and work the deeper water off some of the islands.The action is not as fast as the shallower fishing but has produced some nice walleye for me. The time of year makes a big difference too.I prefer the second week of opening season. The walleye are all shallow then and you get a good mix of fun and good eat'n. I don't like the first week as have been stuck a couple times with late ice-out. Good luck maybe see ya on Pakwash some time.

Early May ice out means good big eye fishing in shallows the last week of May and first week of June assuming the weather warms the water up average.Too early ice out will can bring the mayfly hatch as early as the last week of May but that is uncommon.Drag minnows, crawlers, and leaches in the flats and watch for bait fish, if they're around so are the eyes.2 years ago most eyes ran 19 to 25 inches and quite few bigger,we release everything thats over 17 unless we keep a 30 incher to mount.Good Luck"
