Been to Their sandpoint outpost not to bad, fishing was ok not great and Ed sr. really seemed to have an attitude enough that we didnt go back. thought about maybe trying them again so any info would be appreciated, thanks."
526488,WillieB,2003-02-14 12:58:00,292,"eye-Dr, Considering the number of truly superb fly-in outfitters, why would you even think of returning to a place that the fishing was just OK and you got an ""attitude"" from the owner??"
526490,Bruce,2003-02-16 18:01:00,48,"I have fished Packwash for about the last 10 years about the last week of May and first week of June.It can be great Walleye fishing at this time if thereis normal ice out. Late ice out like last year slowedthe bigger eyes but we did good on northerns 10 to 20pounds. We have stayed at Northwoods Bay Resort on the north end of the lake but are switching to Snake Falls Resort this year on the other side of the river. Northwoodshas openings at that time of the year, it's nothing fancy butnice people. Go to northwoodsbayresort.com for info.Packwash is a shallower stained water lake that grows bigwalleyes not uncommon for someone in our group to catch 10 pounder each year and if you hit it right most run 19 to 25 inches. We drive up from WI and looking forward to the trip this year. Hoping for iceout about May 1st.If you have anymore questions on Packwash reply.I do know that Perrault is a clear water lake that I would notrecomend.Good Luck"
526489,Guest,2003-02-18 06:54:00,0,How do you like showalters? We are fishing the Severn system through showalters in late June. Any suggestions or comments?
526491,Willy,2003-02-18 14:41:00,4,I have stayed at Rainbow Point Lodge on Perrault lake. The people there are great and we caught a lot of fish. We hit the mayfly hatch and still caught plenty of fish. It is a big enough lake with a large by where you can catch perch as well. I had one of my better expierences at this lodge. Good luck fihsin!
526477,Guest,2003-01-14 22:23:00,0,"My father is no longer able to fly in because of health so we're looking at drive in alternatives this year. Any experience with Pakuni lodge on Pakwash Lake, or Manotak lodge on Perrault Lake.Any advise would be greatly appreciated"
526478,Guest,2003-01-15 04:32:00,0,"I have not stayed at lodges on these lakes and only fished from shore at Perrault Falls-a few decades ago, so I cann't give you much information. My brother stayed at Lake Wenasaga, a few miles north of Ear Falls about 5 years ago. I believe the lake is about 8 miles long, has a boat ramp and one resort. The housekeeping rates are reasonable and the resort provides 15 hp electric start outboards with its boats. It is a good Walleye Lake. Appears to be a large enough lake to be interesting, not overcrowed with resorts and not too big to get lost on. Try the following url: http://www.wenasaga.com"
526481,River_eye,2003-01-15 17:43:00,1486,You don't need to fly in to get a good lodge. Try www.eaglenest.mb.caGuided there for 5 years. You won't find a better value anywhere.
526482,Trailerguy,2003-01-15 18:06:00,1407,"I know that Manotak changed hands a few years back, and that the new owners have been upgrading some of their facilitys. I've not stayed there, but have met them casually at the resteraunt near there, they seem nice enough and are focused on there guests. A lake as large as Perrault has many fishing oportunitys, including small mouth bass."
526483,Guest,2003-02-12 07:51:00,0,WE stayed at pakuni lodge three years ago--since have switched to snakefalls resort. The cabins and equipment are in better shape--but if you dont mind these aspects of pakuni--it is just fine. The location of both these resorts are fairly similar--snakefalls is located at the mouth of the snakeriver--pakuni up stream about 500 yards. Fishing on pakwash has picked up over the last few years. Every year we are up there we do better than the previous year.
526479,Guest,2003-02-12 09:53:00,0,"Hey Gary-IA, why don't you buy an ad from WC instead of trying to sneak your advertisements in this way for Wenesaga. This post didn't ask for info on that lake."
526484,Guest,2003-02-12 11:21:00,0,"I stayed at Rainbow Point Lodge last July. It was hotter than ##### and we only caught fish in the early morning and late evening. But the lodge was nice, good equip."
526485,nitroman,2003-02-12 14:55:00,368,"We stay on cedar lake during the the first week of June every year and have no problems finding walleye,northern,and the occasional musky.I think there are five or more resorts on the system but we never see to many boats ot there (my buddies say it's so quiet you can hear a perch fart 6 feet under)"
526486,Hammerhead Herb,2003-02-13 12:20:00,259,"I can't give you any specific recommendation, however it seems your dad flies out of the Ear Falls area (based on the area that you are asking about). What you might do is ask your dad's fly-in outfitter if they could recommend a drive to lodge for your dad; if he was a good customer, some of these fly-in services have a relationship with and/or an understanding of the local lodges and would be happy to make a suggestion. My fly-in outfitter is Showalter's and I recall that there was a group of elderly fellows that would follow us routinely at our outpost. Then one year they decided they were too old for the fly-in and portages; they were in their mid-70's. Louise Showalter fixed them up with a lodge on Gullrock that was perfect for those folks; I saaw them the next year and they were happy with the new place and the lake. I forgot the name of the lodge, but your dad's outfitter should be able to give a good recommendation.Hope this helps."
526480,Guest,2003-02-13 13:00:00,0,I have no association with Lake Wenasaga. I only related my brother's experience on the lake (the only association he had with the lake was as a paying guest his one stay there). My only intention was to offer a choice of a place to fish and I reject the suggestion that I am trying to sneak an ad in.
