527695,Mike KS,2003-02-14 15:07:00,18,"A dear friend of mine who was a avid Pike Fisherman for years is no longer. Dont get me wrong he didnt die...he has been reborn. During our last trip to Lac Seul he only fished for pike for about one hour. He spent another 60 hours fishing for Walleye. He proves beyond a doubt that even the shadiest of characters can be rehabed. So if you have a Pike friend dont give up on him ...he may see the light some day.........""A WALLEYE FISHERMAN NEVER STOOD TALLER THAN WHEN HE BENT DOWN TO HELP A PIKE FISHERMAN"""
