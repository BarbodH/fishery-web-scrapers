527797,Bobby,2003-02-17 21:58:00,211,Heading up to Whitefish Bay camp on Lake of the Woods. Any comments on the camp itself and places to fish on the 2nd week in June. We have never fished this area so any comments would be appreciated
527798,Guest,2003-02-18 08:59:00,0,"Water is very clear. I found the fishing tough in Whitefish, but owners must know where it is good. Never have stayed at the camp. Whitefish Bay was tough for walleyes. Had run out near Cliff Island to get them, but loved the trip in my hopped up Cressy. Whitefish Narrows was good at night. Snake Bay was good most of the time. Log Bay for smallies. Long Bay was good near the west end. Good luck."

527800,bronzeback77,2003-02-18 10:48:00,97,"We fish Whitefish Bay every year. The fishing is very good. We have had good luck jigging deep reefs for Walleye around Timber and Bell Island. Snake Bay is very good as well, but use crawler harnesess in Snake bay. You can catch some big Lake Trout near Three Sister Islands and Russell Island. Good Smallmouth fishing down Ells Penninsula and around Annie and Timber Island. I caught a 49 inch Northern last year between Annie and Timber Island. We go up every year for two weeks at the end of May and beggining on June. You should catch fish and it is beautiful."

The area is quite impressive, not crowded at all. There are plenty of fish to catch, and if nothing else is biting, the norhthern will always keep you busy.Roy"
527802,Bobby,2003-02-19 21:15:00,211,Roy C.Where do you fish. Can you give me some exact places and points
527803,Guest,2003-02-20 09:03:00,0,"Bobby, We will provide you with a map of our area on Whitefish Bay and I will mark on it the places where the walleyes and other fish are biting. Places mentioned above are good but you may not have to go that far from camp. We will be on top of where the action is and share it with you. Water temp will be the big factor. Trout, if you are interested, will be very close by it the water is still cold. Any lodge guest should be able to trust the owners to provide the very best in information. Bobby, contact me by phone if you want to talk specifics.Bob HungerWhitefish Bay Camp"
