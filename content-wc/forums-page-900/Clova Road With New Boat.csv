527748,joepa,2003-02-17 08:44:00,366,Thinking about going to O'Sullivan Lake this fall. I'm thinking abouttraveling that 75 miles of Clova road with a new 18' boat. Would this be possible without damage to my boat if I put some kind of protection on the front of the boat?
527749,McQ,2003-02-17 09:17:00,615,"Oh woe is me, another attempt to travel the worst road imagineable on this side of the border and keep the paint on a boat. I've been up and down this road more times than I should have and it's safe to say every trip I've come across a busted trailer or two, have hauled some broken down equipment out on a flatbed and provided some tools and assistance to folks who were desperate for help.To make a long story shorter there are ways to haul your boat in and avoid damage from the sand and stone chips. First off set your tow rig up with a heavy duty mud flap that stretches completely across the back of the truck. Then I would recommend you visit a shop that specialzes in making boat tops, covers, etc and have them make you side curtains from heavy vinyl that clip to the side rail of the boat and drop down and clip to the trailer frame, have them made long enough to reach from the bow to just past the midpoint of the hull. I've tried everything imaginable and this is the only method that will provide a safe measure of security. Don't even bother with looking into the bolt on wing stone protectors fitted to the trailer they just won't work for this type of road.It is very important that your trailer be sprung well and double check the tightness of every bolt and nut. If you are using a roller trailer get a bunk to save your hull from dimpling and wrap the foot of your motor with some carpet remnants to keep the paint on there too.We have been using this set-up for the last seven years on our boats and damage has been minimal to non existent.In fairness you can hit this road shortly after it's been graded and drive through with no problems but my experience has been so as to not rely on it. The road is difficult but the rewards at the end of the trail are worth the extra efforts."
527750,GP-NJ,2003-02-17 14:52:00,156,"I have done this trip at least once in each of the last 5 years and some years twice. I trailered in a 15' Princecraft with a 25 hp Johnson OB. I have an UltraGuard flap mounted on the trailer hitch ball mount so that it is 4-5"" off the ground. If this flap drags you will sandblast your boat. I also have an UtraGuard flap mounted on the trailer behind the fenders across the entire width. This flap protects the motor. Next, I use ratchet tie down straps to tie the boat to the trailer. If the boat bounces on the trailer, it will probally suffer damage and sink when you launch into the lake. I wrap the lower unit & motor hood with terry coth towels & plastic stretch wrap & use a transom saver with another ratchet tie down strap. I wouldn't rely on the power trim & tilt alone. I use terry cloth towels under ALL contact points. You would be suprised to see how much paint can rub off in 20 min. of vibration. I do not cover the boat because the dust (sandy grit) accumuates in the cover which in turn rubs against your boat and removes paint FAST. I remove license plate from trailer (I have seen several on the Road), unplug trailer lights and wrap them with terry cloth & duct tape. Bring lots of duct tape, extra ratchet tie down straps, bearing kit, spare tire, & tools. Drive slow, no faster than 30 mph when the road is good (no wash board). If the trailer wheels bounce and the trailer catches air it's only a matter of minutes before something gives way. What you need most is to PRAY you don't break down while on this road. You can get help because the road is well traveled on weekends, although it will probally cost a fortune. I was very fortunate while traveling this Clova road these last 5 years. Others I have seen weren't. I have also heard of many horror stories. As the previous post indicated, the rewards (fishing) can be spectacular. All you have to do is figure out how to get there safely. I do have another boat. It's a 17.5' Princecraft with a 115 hp Evinrude Ficht & a 9.9 Evinrude 4-stroke kicker. Personally, I will NEVER EVER take it down this road. Always remember, The Clova Road is the BOSS. Sorry for such a long post. Best of luck on your trip."
527751,nemio,2003-02-17 16:09:00,96,"With all my experience on gravel road and specialy that one I definitly not recommend that road for a trailer and a nice boat. Particulary if you are the kind of person that like it's thing looking new. Why don't you use a camp boat and maybe just bring a 25hp. and you are going to save a lot of time driving because you don't have nothing in the back, so you will be able to spend more time fishing instead of driving. This is my thought."
527752,joepa,2003-02-18 07:52:00,366,"Thanks for the reponses. I talked to the lodge owner at the Sportsman Show and the road didn't sound that bad. Now I have something to think about. I certainly would hate to ruin a new rig like mine in one trip.Again, thanks."
527753,McQ,2003-02-18 09:48:00,615,"joepaLike everything we do a little thought and preparation go a long way. We tow our boats into the Clova area, the Gouin Reservoir through Parent and a few other spots even more north. Our boats are Princecraft 188BT and a 17' Holiday. With our travel rigging and attention to detail there has really been few problems. I will point out what we learned through the years - never tow a painted trailer (you'll definitely need to repaint it on return), galvanized is the route to follow here, don't load anything inside the boats (no rubbing), travel with rail snap on covers and side curtains(no rubbing), bungey cord all motors after wrapping foot in carpet remnants, use a transom guard, use rachet tie downs to the trailer either the short straps at rear or a bear claw over the back of the hull and above all keep the speed down, it's those unexpected washboard sections that can vibrate everything loose or cause hull damage from bouncing. Watch out for those impatient types who have to pass everything on the road - they will kick up the gravel.These are the things that have gone wrong in our past trips - broken trailer side marker lights (every trip), once a broken taillight, screwed up the tilt trim on one trip using a 2X4 block to rest the motor on (it bounced loose and angled across the unit causing it to crack the fill plug).I have actually caused more damage to the paint on my boat while travelling through construction areas on the paved park road when not having the side curtains on because we anticipated pavement all the way to the Whisky River.My experience on the Clova road started when we were building a lodge on the Gouin Reservoir back in the late 80s - every spring I would bring a 5 ton truck full of aviation fuel, gas for the motors and diesel for the generator plus lumber, wooden boats, motors and whatever else we could stuff in. I even trucked in the lumber, windows, doors and trusses for two complete cottages one year on a flatbed. I've seen this road at its worst and breezed through in other years. The trip in loaded was always uneventful but the trip out light could be #####."
527754,GP-NJ,2003-02-18 16:31:00,156,"Joe,The fishing at this lodge is good. Our group catches several walleye 28""+ each year. I didn't mean to turn you away from visiting this lodge. I suggest your first time there use a camp boat as Nemio suggested. Camp boats are 14' Princecraft and you can put your own motor on- I would recommend 15 hp - 25 hp (short shaft for 15"" transom). By following this advise you can gain experience with the Clova road and reduce your exposure to damaging your equipment. I believe I know how you feel- You've got this nice rig and you would like to use it. I am going through this thought process myself. This year I have reservations for 5 weeks fishing at a different lake in Quebec (3 separate trips) so I can use my 17.5' Princecraft. I do plan to go back to O'Sullivan's sometime in the future- just not this year. Feel free to email me or send a private message by clicking on the icon in the upper right corner."
527755,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-02-18 23:14:00,618,"We had good fishing on ossulivan last year. I would advise using the outfitters boats on a first trip then decide if you are willing to pull your rig on the clova road ang the goat path, er, I mean drive way into Ossullivan. If you do decide to pull your rig, do as above posts state to protect it. Take a tool box and extra parts for your trailer. Go slow and give yourself plenty of time. Rich"
527756,5Paulie4,2003-02-20 05:22:00,34,The tales of damaged boats and trailers on the Clova Rd are long. I've heard the story of the guy who was trailering his boat out of camp one year (under the influence I must add) who was flagged down by another traveler only to be informed that he had lost the wheels on his trailer (and lower unit) at some point a few miles back and was dragging what was left of his rig. He never noticed the difference. Why risk it? The boats/motors at O'Sullivan are more than adequate and I have yet to notice any measurable upside to those who trailer their own rigs into camp. Relax. Who needs the stress?Thunderstick
527757,joepa,2003-02-20 09:04:00,366,Well there are three of us who will be going and fishing three in a 14' boat is kind of tough if not back breaking for an entire week. I guess I just want the luxury of going in with a well equipped boat with all the bells and whistles. I may just take a trip up the Clova road in the spring just to see how bad it is. I love the area and certainly would enjoy the extra trip.Thanks for all the input.
