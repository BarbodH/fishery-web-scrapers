The cable was shot and the low water was off the end of the rails so the carrage could fall off before the boat reached water deep enough to float. We have been in touch with MNR in Kenora and the cable should be, if not already, replaced. Do not know what might have been done about the carrage reaching the water. The water was low when we closed camp and will most likly be low in the spring. Not much snow in the LOTW water shed so not much run off with the melt. That could change.Bob HungerWhitefish Bay Camp"
