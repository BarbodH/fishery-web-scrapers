However, the walleye population is not huge and if you catch one it should be over 4 pounds. I have seen an eye snatch a hooked lake throut that was over 30 inches. I can not seem to catch one these big walleyes. Does anybody have any suggestions on how to catch thse big eyes in a spring fed lake? Thanks"

The key to the walleye there was to fish before 6 am or after 5pm on clear days, or pray for overcast. We used only 4# clear mono, fluorocarbon had not been invented yet. The other key was to get on the spot early, anchor and then stay quiet for about 30 minutes before fishing. Look for any downed timber along the shore, this can hold walleye but can be a real bear to fish.Good luck!"
