1115378,csnez,2009-06-21 20:39:00,9,"Just returned from 4 days of fishing on Minnitaki. Walleyes were a bit slower than usual this year. Had to work for them. Rice River and English River sanctuaries had just opened on the 15th. Few fish in the Rice this year must have moved out already. Best results were just below the chutes in Abrams. All 7 got to bring home nice limits though and plenty to eat each day. Last night trolling around the Island 3 of the group caught about 25 northerns and 6 walleyes on cranks. 20 of the Northerns brought home for pickling. Moose and bear tracks on the Island and saw the moose swimming on Wednesday. English Falls area had lots of fish but a small as usual. One in group got a 29 inch walleye at the chutes. Nice traveling fish at the chutes. Tried Lyons Bay for Trout and had a couple of bites in 42 and 65 feet of water. One small walleye taken at Lyons out of 40 feet. Not much happening at the Mineshaft either. Warm calm days for all 4 days we were there. Great trip, good food, good friends and enough fish to keep all happy. Stayed at the Northumbrian Minnitaki Island outpost."

Big V was incrediable, with huge schools of smallies. Lac Seul was a little slow with Manitou Rapids area producing our best fish."

1115770,rockape,2009-06-23 09:11:00,215,"I was with the wrangler last week. I'd say I found the biggest fish at the Chutes. Not rip roaring fast action, but quality fish. I think everything I caught there was slot or over. Was working a jig really slow with a 4"" gulp minnow on. My partner was using a live minnow, and the fish were prefering the gulp for sure. The thing is, it could be different the next day. I also caught quality slot and over fish with a #12 Xrap of all things. I was trying to catch pike in the Mineshaft Narrows area and at the Chutes and caught slot and over walleyes on the Xrap. Shallow too. 8' of water."
1117166,Guest,2009-06-29 09:14:00,0,"We just got back from Minnitaki. Fished mainly on Troutfish, Redpine and points on the main lake. Got more big walleyes than in past years, although this is the first time we have been there in June. Caught walleyes in weeds in various places, including Redpine, where there were half dozen boats trolling thru the weedbed. Fish were shallow, so we cast the shoreline a lot, wound up with many more smallmouths than we usually get. Advice from others in a previous thread was right on. All in all a great trip."
1123720,RyanG,2009-07-25 06:21:00,16,"I see quite a few posts regarding (MineShaft) and (Lyons Bay).When fishing for tout, are you guys going into the mineshaft narrows or fishing the 60+feet out in front?Jigging I assume.How about Lyons, Are you targeting the deep water in the first bay (100) or the 2nd bay (60) or the 3rd bay (80)?I have not fished for trout although I hae been here 12 times before. thanks for the helpIf we decide to run to Redpine for Notherns sounds like the first weedbeds are the best, correct?Ryan"
1124254,Red Pine J,2009-07-27 16:01:00,44,Just a thought but.......... If ya do go to Redpine....I'd also try Southwest Bay for Northerns!!!!!!!! A month ago .....when I was there....we needed to be careful getting into Southwest because of the high water levels ( hid some of the small reefs intering SW Bay ) After the entrance..we were good to go...I've always had good luck @ SW Bay for the Northerns. Also.......a few years ago a group of anglers from Wisc. would target the Northerns & fish for Wallys secondarily. They told me they spent a lot of time in the Ruby Island area. Northerns do have a FINE flavor!!!!!!! Wish I could do a better job of cleaning them.......lol Good luck & Gods Speed!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1124326,RyanG,2009-07-27 21:16:00,16,"Great info, thank you.I will be leaving this Saturday for a week and look forward to getting after the Northerns. We usually stay at Abram Lake Park and make the 30 min run to the end of Minnitaki for walleyes but this time we will focus more on the big guys.Ryan"
1129178,JR_MN,2009-08-16 15:35:00,2,"Hello all,Heading up to Abram and Minnitaki this week...just curious if anyone has information on lake level and water temp. Will be taking the chute from Abram to Minnitaki every day, I assume the water level is fairly high so we should be fine. Thanks for any replies! JR"
1129237,DanL,2009-08-16 21:08:00,262,We were on Minnitaki the 1st. week of August. Thew water was a little high but not too bad. The water temps were cool. They temps were between 61 and 65 degress. That is the coolest I have seen in my 12 years up at Donnelley's. The fishing was as good as always. The fish were also in the same areas for that time of year.
