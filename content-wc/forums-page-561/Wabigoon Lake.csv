Has anyone been there this season and if so, how was/is the fishing. Any camps you would recommend? My fishing party is primarily interested in fishing for muskies. However, I know the lake has quite a mixed bag of fish. Any reports or experiences you can pass on would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

For accomidations and a wonderful camp atmosphere, Davis' Bonny Bay Camp is second to none and Len and Nancy are two of the friendliest people you will ever meet. Their location on the lake is great too, as you are pretty central to everything on the system. www.bonnybay.com Hope this helps, Chris K"

Locally, the muddy Wabigoon and associated chain of lakes, is not noted for being the best fishery, musky or otherwise, in the area. The city of Dryden sits on the lake and it is fished hard by the locals in the summer as well as the winter. Eagle lake has quite a reputation and there are many lodges on the lake that cater to the musky fisherman. Another suggestion would be to check with Moosehorn Lodge in the Sioux Lookout area, this is a class operation that does cater to musky fisherman and has access from their lodge, to several lakes including Lac Seul, that has great walleye fishing as well. Do some research on your own, ask for suggestions on good musky lakes and don't drive all that way for less than the best."

Very few lakes you can catch muskies in the weeds on topwaters almost any time of the open water season! Yes some clear lakes you can catch muskies trolling, but Wabigoon is a topwater paradise! There is nothing greater than having a 40 to 50"" fish hammer your spinnerbait! The fish on the goon react to sound & vibration very well! And due to the fact that there are a small number of lodges promoting musky fishing on the goon unlike Eagle or Lac Seul, muskies and pike are a untapped resource!Fish ON!"
1130266,tonts23,2009-08-20 12:52:00,4,"A group of us are headed to Wabigoon in a week. We are 1st timers there and have heard a lot of great things about the fishery. Any advice would be greatly appreciated for catching a big fish. I am fairly new to Musky fishing and my biggest to date is 46"" and this will be my wifes 1st time going after them."

I live on (Dinorwic) one of the lakes of the system and am not a musky fisherman, but know a guide in the area that does, if you would be interested, PM and I can pass on his name. There is shopping and several restaurants in Dryden for the wives. If you have your own boat and want to get into some good (more consistant) walleye fishing, there is Lac Seul and a bunch of lakes you can trailer to, that would fill that niche, that are less than 1 1/2 hours away. Good luck and bring some dry weather with you, it has been raining all summer."
