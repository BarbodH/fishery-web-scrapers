Sawyer County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Tim Zeigle says his office was notified by the Ontario Provincial Police that it happened Wednesday as John Ryan and another person were fishing on the Bad River. Turbulence on the river following heavy rains caused Ryan to lose control of the boat, which overturned and ejected both occupants into the water. Ryan's fishing companion was wearing a flotation device and swam to shore, but Ryan was not. The other person recovered Ryan's body and tried unsuccessfully to administer CPR. An autopsy will be conducted in Canada to determine the exact cause of death."
