Weather was good - some days in the 80's. Water temps were high 60's to low 70's. Walleyes were still scattered at a variety of depths and locations. We moved around alot. Had our best luck in 6' - 10' of water but also found them deeper. It was one of our best trips as far as slot fish and overs. Also plenty of good 16""-17"" eaters. We mainly trolled with spinners and minnows. Hammered gold worked best for us. Had some success with slow death rigs with crawlers. Best advice I can give you is to try all depths, locations and techniques. It doesn't seem like the walleyes have gone into any consistent pattern yet this year. We were also there in early July and the story was pretty much the same. Have a great trip!"
