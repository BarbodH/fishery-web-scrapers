1120489,Obabikon,2009-07-13 08:27:00,2370,"Yeah... there are a bunch of very healthy big fish out there. It's just proof that catch and release makes a huge difference. The old days of throwing the little ones back and keeping the big ones was tough on the population. That's all changed with better conservation, more realistic limits, and people being more aware of the fish's well being (don't keep them out of the water for 5 minutes taking your pics)."
1121707,Obabikon,2009-07-17 08:48:00,2370,"The weather has been aweful, and fishing has been slow. We had a high of 53 degrees yesterday! That said, a 54 inch musky was caught yesterday (and of course released). A couple of 28"" walleyes were caught in the last two days too. But, it's been tough, and people have had to fight for them."
1122581,Obabikon,2009-07-21 06:55:00,2370,"The weather has finally worked itself out. The last two or three days have been in the mid/low 70's with a little wind. The walleyes seem to be moving up the sides of the reefs. They'll probably be sitting on top if the weather holds. Two days ago we had another 30.5"" walleye caught. My dad has been involved with the camp for 40 years, and said he can't remember a season that was even close to this for so many 30"" fish."
1123836,Obabikon,2009-07-25 16:43:00,2370,"A fantastic day of fishing. I finally got to go out and guide the last couple of days. The first day, the two guests had all their walleye and wanted to focus on perch. We kept 58 jumbo perch... only the ones without the paracite... (which affects about 1 in 10). Today the guests wanted to do a little of everything. We had 6 walleyes between 17 and 21 inches by 10AM, switched to perch until lunch and mid afternoon (25)... also caught three northerns around 25"" by accident. At 2:30 we tried for crappies... caught 13 between 11 and 13.5""... that 13.5"" crappie was a monster. We came in at 4:15, and I just finished cleaning fish. My knife got a work out the past two days. Anyhow, I hope everyone's fishing has been good."
1129325,Obabikon,2009-08-17 11:01:00,2370,"Sorry I've been MIA for 2 weeks... we've been crazy busy, and right when we slowed, I decided to fish in the Morson Bass International. Anyhow, fishing's been up and down, just like the weather. It poured all weekend, but we caught everything bass fishing. From a 27"" walleye on a white spinner bait, to a 39"" musky... pike, perch, bass... the only thing we didn't catch in the rain was a crappie. As far as the bass tourney goes, we could've done MUCH better. The first fish of the day was a 3.5-4lb PIG of a bass that jumped right next to the boat, and snapped my line. By 3:30, we had four legit fish and one dink in the box... we easily could've had 14LB's and been in contention. Anyhow, congrats to Billy and Almer... great two days of fishing. The past two weeks have been, like I said, up and down. While the walleyes have been caught, they seem to be moving from ontop of the humps, to the bottoms of the humps... back and forth. Guests have been catching a lot of them, and some of the bigger ones have moved into the weed beds. Musky, crappie, northern, and bass have all been caught. The full moon on the 6th made the big muskies go absolutely crazy! We had a group of 10 musky guys up, and in 4 days, they had to have boated 35 fish over 30""."
1119245,Matches,2009-07-07 21:32:00,236,What part of the lake??
1119269,Golden Eagle,2009-07-08 05:41:00,2642,If I were a camp owner I'd say they were caught right off the end of my dock.
1119367,Obabikon,2009-07-08 12:32:00,2370,"The bottom... I don't usually ask guests or guides where. But, within a boat ride of the camp."
1120132,lund rebel,2009-07-11 06:49:00,138,"HOW IS THE WEATHER AND THE FISHING, 48 HOURS TO TAKE OFF."
1120153,joeman79,2009-07-11 08:15:00,417,Have a Great Trip Rebel. Ya lucky devil.
1120166,Obabikon,2009-07-11 09:27:00,2370,"Fishing's been great... another 30.5"" walleye was caught yesterday. That makes 3 this week... (5 all summer)"
1120213,rpieske,2009-07-11 16:41:00,1276,"I had a really big fish up 4 times on two different occasions not too far from your camp about 10 days ago. I came from Nestor Falls and went out to Burrows, Obabikon and Miles. The fish was a minimum of 56 inches and may have been 58"". She would circle on the 8 and open her mouth but never grab the lure. Unfortunately, I am back in St. Louis for a week but will be back up this Thursday for the balance of the season. If I ever catch her I'll post pictures. A real fatty."
1120218,Golden Eagle,2009-07-11 17:15:00,2642,"Good luck catching ""fatty"". Does it help to put some stink on a muskie lure? I'm convinced it's done wonders for me with pike. When I see someone in camp butcher a pike I go for the gullet. A strip of it goes on my JSM, Suick or whatever. I've picked up pike right at the boat that I'm sure wouldn't have hit without the odor. Can't prove it, but I'm a believer."
1120227,Obabikon,2009-07-11 18:30:00,2370,I've had a similar fish south of the camp up a couple times. Another big one within site of the camp... There's going to be some HUGE mommas being caught in the lake the next few years.
1120412,rpieske,2009-07-12 20:10:00,1276,I agree....the best is yet to come. Have you noticed how healthy and fat the fish are this year?
1117174,Obabikon,2009-06-29 09:41:00,2370,Wind was from the SSW on Saturday... makes Rabbit Point impossible... but you can go around Raspberry and through elm portage to get to us.
1117569,maverick,2009-06-30 16:54:00,24,"Jared, I will be leaving for my cabin at BVR around 7 am tomorrow...should be on the lake by 3 pm. Any new info? I hope to get up there and meet you and visit... If you have any good info, it would be greatly appreciated.... Take Care, Jim"
1117697,Obabikon,2009-07-01 07:05:00,2370,"Fishing's been tough. The water is very churned up for some reason. However, today is a beautiful day, and the start of some stable, good looking weather."
1118739,lund rebel,2009-07-06 08:00:00,138,"Just wondering how the fishing is, one week to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1118754,chosenone_intraining,2009-07-06 09:25:00,55,Lund Rebel...Where do you plan to stay on LOTW?
1118798,lund rebel,2009-07-06 12:08:00,138,"At Obabikon camp, I am the one that won the raffle on WC."
1118813,Bill Krejca,2009-07-06 12:55:00,6107,"Enjoy, it's a nice place in a great location. Give us a report when you get back! Bill Krejca"
1118856,Obabikon,2009-07-06 15:43:00,2370,"Fishing has been good. A 48.5 inch musky was caught in Obabikon Lake last night. The walleyes seem to have moved deeper after the heavy winds last week. The mayfly hatch is done, and weather seems to be stable... which are both very good signs for good fishing in the next week or two."
1119204,maverick,2009-07-07 19:09:00,24,"I was up to LOTW last weekend. We fished Miles Bay out to Stairway and all the way out to Tod's Island and Firebag. Fishing was tough due to the bi wind they had the week before and the fish fly hatch. The water is really stirred up, but is settling and the hatch should be done, so the fishing should get better. We did manage about 40 walleyes per day, but we had to really work for them. We found fish in 18-30 feet of water with most of the active ones in 16-23. The good news was that we had awesome weather with sun every day and temps in the 70's and no wind....Good luck up there..."
1119206,Obabikon,2009-07-07 19:13:00,2370,"Two 30"" walleyes (one was 30.5) were caught today!!!"
1112964,Obabikon,2009-06-11 13:55:00,2370,"Yep, it's Jared. We'll see you guys in a couple of weeks."
1115103,lund rebel,2009-06-20 06:41:00,138,How has the fishing been up there???
1115112,Obabikon,2009-06-20 07:32:00,2370,"Sorry guys. The fishing's been great. Walleyes have been caught on humps. 7'-12' humps right where the water drops off. There's still an absolute ton of big walleyes being caught. Also, the 17-18"" fish that everyone wants for take home have been going crazy too. Northern fishing has been very good in Obabikon lake. The weed beds in the main lake aren't up very high, so OB is the best place at the moment for quantity and quality. The cold spring and the high water levels add up to a tough year for the weeds. Small mouth have moved into the shore lines. Almost all the evening fishing has switched to them. They're very agressive at the moment, and are in pretty shallow. As always, looking for bolders and rock piles. Crappie are biting on the dock. No one has really found them on the lake in the last week or so. However, they're schooled up under our boats. Suspended 6 feet up in 10 feet of water. Side note... if anyone's looking for a fun adventure try this: Two days ago I went up Thompson Creek on the North end of Myles Bay. You can boat quite a ways back there. Eventually you'll have to get out of the boat though and hike. The hike is about a quarter of a mile through thick woods. So, it's not an easy one. But, we stay along the shore line. All the way back is a set of three water falls and some rapids. The waterfalls empty into a little pool area and the small mouth are stacked up in there (we caught 16 in less than an hour... 2 - 18inchers). I had three younger boys (12-13) and their dads with me... the boys played in the waterfalls for a while and then caught small mouth while wading in 3 feet of water. It's a memory worth making if you're up for the work. A scene from the movie ""A River Runs Through It"". I've made that trip 20+ times in my life, and every time is a wonderful experience."
1115443,Obabikon,2009-06-22 05:37:00,2370,"The heat slowed down the fishing yesterday. While people seemed to still be catching the big ones, the small fish were tougher. Lots of 17""+ caught, but had problems finding the 15"" fish for lunch. With the heat and sun, I guess it was expected that Northerns would be slow. They didn't disappoint. They were biting short... just pulling on skirts. Crappies are still in on the dock. I havent' heard of anyone catching them in the lake. Small mouth are still in shallow, but appear to have spawned. (They're skinny)"
1116970,maverick,2009-06-28 10:01:00,24,"Hey Jared, I am coming up to our cabin at Buena Vista on Wednesday. Wondering if the crappies are still around and if the walleyes have moved out to the reefs and humps. I am hoping to stop by and meet up with you this time...any advice on where the hot bite may be for crappies and any recent trends on eyes? Thanks, Jim"
1116987,Obabikon,2009-06-28 11:50:00,2370,"We've been catching the crappies off the dock. However, the weather has been rough the past couple days... 20+ mph winds and rain. So, this could completely change the pattern. I'll let you know more in a couple days."
1117031,maverick,2009-06-28 17:34:00,24,Sounds great...I am excited to share LOTW with soem good friends who have never fished there before....it will be a great time. Jim
1117044,BB3,2009-06-28 18:54:00,48,"Your friends would have been impressed with the waves this weekend!! you would have had fun going to Obabikon, from the Vista heading to Rabbitt point was rough!! not much traffic Sat or Today!"
1117073,Obabikon,2009-06-28 20:19:00,2370,It was dangerous out there this weekend... hopefully it calms down.
1117170,alanb,2009-06-29 09:26:00,56,"Jared- So you had the proper weather for our story to get told again (and again, and...)? What direction was that wind from? Hopefully nobody tried to ""outdo"" us. Alanb"
1111674,Obabikon,2009-06-07 11:37:00,2370,"Hey guys... I'm going to start doing reports regularly. I had a little inspiration last night when I heard that a guest had caught(and released) a 31"" walleye. The weather is still cool. High in the upper 50's yesterday. The water temp is still 55 or so in the main lake The water temp in Obabikon Lake is 59.5 The Walleyes are being caught at all depths. But, most action has been in 18-25' of water. Some are finally starting to show up in the shallows though."
1111696,rpieske,2009-06-07 13:18:00,1276,The same thing is happening here in Nestor Falls. Thanks for the update. Look forward to seeing it regularly. Good Idea!!!!!
1111756,Lazy Fisherman,2009-06-07 18:33:00,276,Obabikon Thanks for the report. Will also be looking forward to seeing it.
1111857,Obabikon,2009-06-08 07:50:00,2370,"The water must finally be warming. Last night guests started getting a lot of big crappie off the dock. Most action seems to be at the end of the dock... 14-17 feet deep. Yesterday was a tougher day for walleyes... the wind kept switching. The large mouth in Obabikon Lake have been going wild. A guest caught a 21"" last night... 6+ pounds."
1111878,1700SS,2009-06-08 08:31:00,104,"Sounds great!! Keep the reports coming, look forward to reading them. Be up that way in 3 weeks.Brett"
1112153,1shooter,2009-06-08 22:11:00,1493,Tell them not to catch them all....I will be there in there in 72 hours.
1112535,Obabikon,2009-06-10 07:46:00,2370,"We had another 30 inch walleye caught yesterday. I'm going to put the picture in my profile. The walleyes have been a little tougher. The weather has thrown them off. However, we saw the sun yesterday afternoon (first time in 3 or 4 days), and the guests came in with some great reports. The crappies are still pretty deep. But, they're slowly moving in from the deep part of the dock. We just had a group leave with 50 crappies in their cooler... all caught off the end of the dock with a beer in their hand after dinners. Small mouth seem to be hit and miss. Some guests are saying they're going great, and some can't seem to find them. I haven't noticed much of a pattern from reports."
1112736,Obabikon,2009-06-10 18:49:00,2370,"Finally a nice day! We've had a cold spring, and today was an absolute treat. The wind picked up too much, but it was out of the west (anything but that stupid NE wind) Anyhow, fishing was pretty good today. One group caught some crappies in the trees in Obabikon lake. Everyone seemed to do well in the walleye department. No records today, but a couple 40""+ muskies were boated."
1112793,muskyman73,2009-06-11 03:46:00,402,"Are these reports coming from Jared ? If so, we will see you June 27, the maloney group. Jack and I wanna thank you for the hook up at the show too. We look forward to the new cabin and making pizza too. But if you want, we can make you some pork chops too"
1112802,bob oh,2009-06-11 05:27:00,3936,"Wow, that NE crummy spring weather report sounds a lot like Erie this year -- weather must be related LOL Fishing is great here too, when the weather allows!"
