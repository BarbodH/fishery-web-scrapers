1129902,campchick,2009-08-19 08:15:00,96,The price to fly in beer varies with the outfitters. Some outfitters charge the town price and deliver the beer on the check flights as a courtesy. Some have beer in stock already at the cabin and you pay for what you consume. Others make you take in your own beer and pay the overweight. Ask your outfitter what his policy is. If he does charge a handling fee keep in mind that the flight costs are very high and he is not making any money doing this for you. We have a small plane and cost to run it is $5.00 a minute. Much more on the larger planes.
1129945,Golden Eagle,2009-08-19 11:18:00,2642,Place your order a couple of weeks in advance and the outfitter may take it in on a check flight. Sometimes the outfitter's plane is not insured and licensed for commercial flying. That could be a problem for hauling cargo such as beer..................RE: Kirsten Brazier and her whistle blowing act of a few years ago. Good people were hurt.
1129949,SSA,2009-08-19 11:30:00,19,"Most fly ins generally want can beer rather than bottled beer (weight is less, no breakage, and easier to fly out as garbage after consumed). Bottled beer in Canada costs less than cans though. I would also clarify this with your outfitter."
1129965,Guest,2009-08-19 12:09:00,0,"We have no problem paying a handling fee to cover flight expenses and handling, but I am trying to confirm if the upcharge of $15/case is accurate."
1129981,NYBowHunter,2009-08-19 13:12:00,35,That extra charge sounds about right - I think we paid around $45 (CA) a case flown in.
1130034,GNO,2009-08-19 16:47:00,153,"A case of Blue cans is about $40 Cdn, so you should expect to pay between $40-$50 US with most outfitters. I don't know any outfitters that will take in bottles do to the extra weight and breakage."
1130043,pegasis0066,2009-08-19 17:15:00,64,"Why do you need only one case flown-in in advance?Surely you can compromise some luggage weight to squeeze in one case. Now if you wanted 10 cases, I could understand the question."
1131223,onetimedave,2009-08-24 17:18:00,502,A case of cans weigh approx. 21 pounds. Our outfitter (AWO) at no charge. We purchase the beer. will bring in on check flight
