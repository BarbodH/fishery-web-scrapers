1126998,Tom/MN,2009-08-06 23:09:00,35,Can anyone give me a trip report on these two lakes this year? What's the water level like into Ord? What's the road like in from 105 and the landing condition? Thanks in advance.

He made the trip back April road from 105 two times, once to fish Ord and once to go to Gerrard several miles farther. Forgot to ask him about water levels, but he said the road in from 105 was the best he has seen it in many years. The last mile into Ord - the sandy road after the final turn - is it's usual very rutted condition and you have to be careful if pulling a boat, but the rest of the road is good. He said the walleye fishing in both Ord and Gerrard was spectaular. Their go-to bait all week was a chartruese Road Runner jig with chartruese twister tail and minnow.When are you going to be up there? My son and I leave tonight. Barring torrential downpours, we'll hit Ord Sunday or Monday. Puzzle Bay here we come! My favorite place in all of NW Ontario. If you're out there and see a black Lund Rebel 1625, be sure to say hello."
