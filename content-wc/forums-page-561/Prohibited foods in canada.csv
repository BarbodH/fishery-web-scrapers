1127639,PRD1,2009-08-10 09:21:00,458,Potatoes are the only thing prohibitied I am aware of. Researched it in May so unless it has changed that sould be it.
1127664,Dacotah Eye,2009-08-10 10:38:00,2722,When we take potatoes we boil them first as it is ok to take them this way unless something changed. Fresh ones we buy in Canada.

1127741,Guest,2009-08-10 13:47:00,0,why not take food across the border. You get the brand names you like and pay less in the USA
1127845,Jimmy Jig,2009-08-10 19:34:00,1905,"USA food is much less money, potatoes are twice as high. I will say they are very good."
1128277,PRD1,2009-08-12 10:26:00,458,My main reason for shopping in the USA other than cost is time. We take a group of 12 on the annual trip so by the time you spend 2 - 3 hours shopping and packing for the last 100 miles of the trip you lose at least a half day and you have part of the crew standing around waiting.
1128283,wiswalleye,2009-08-12 10:55:00,62,Potatoes bought in Canada should taste good. Odds are very good they were grown in the U.S. of A.
