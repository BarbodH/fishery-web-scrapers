1131431,Steve of Madison,2009-08-25 12:27:00,230,"I'm sorry, it didn't sound like you were looking for info it sounded more like you were looking for justification."
1131437,Brookieslayer,2009-08-25 12:45:00,123,"I live here in Canada and have a G3 Jon and outboard jet. THe reason i fish with a regular outboard is a jet on rough water eats too much air! The resulting noise/ performance isn't so great and eats a ton of speed and fuel. I'll stick with my prop tiller... tunnels and props have the same problem, better for use in rivers."
1131508,Fishoil,2009-08-25 18:28:00,1277,"Snaggletooth - I think the draft of those boats might be a little more than the typical canadian outfitter boat, but they sure look like fun!! Brookieslayer - I didn't think about the rough water characteristics. With the intake just below or at the water's surface it must end up in the air with any amount of waves. I can see where a prop outboard might be a better choice in waves. Steve of Madison - In a way maybe I am looking for justification. After 20 years of 2-3 trips to Canada a year I finally had an incident with a rock this year. After spending the second half of my trip in a small boat I realized how much I miss some of the smaller waters that I used to fish before I bagan taking a 19'-21' boat. I'm considering taking my 14' tiller next trip and have begun wondering if a jet would make the trip better by opening up some more waters to me. I don't have a jet, nor have I ever been in one, but I'd certainly consider buying one if it would make my Canadian trips better."
1130764,Fishoil,2009-08-22 19:36:00,1277,Why don't you see aluminum jet boats or jet outboards in Ontario? It seems like they would be ideal with all the shallow water and rocks. Am I missing something or is there some reason that they wouldn't work well?
1130786,SinOrSwim,2009-08-23 00:59:00,1528,I would venture to guess it would be more expensive. If something was wrong with the motor the whole boat is out of use. With an outboard you just swap them out and haul it back for repair.Other than that??????
1130813,Bill Krejca,2009-08-23 07:40:00,6107,"It is said that jets lose around 30% of their efficiency, so fuel mileage could be a factor. Another possibility is perhaps, due to weeds in many waters, the jet intake could get plugged rather easily? Bill Krejca"
1131043,Guest,2009-08-24 07:32:00,0,"A jet boat would be fine for running around but you wouldn't be able to forward or backward troll with one very easily. As said, the are not very efficient either. Certainly wouldn't have to worry as much about hitting something though."
1131096,Guest,2009-08-24 10:02:00,0,At $5/gallon we're not going to run jet drive boats.
1131101,Guest,2009-08-24 10:21:00,0,"They're just not that functional as fishing boats, and most fisherman don't need the advantages jet boats provide. NWO Fishing Bum"
1131133,Fishoil,2009-08-24 12:06:00,1277,Why do you say they're not functional as fishing boats? Most of my ontario fishing is pitching jigs for walleyes or casting for northerns. I don't troll up there and like to get into some smaller lakes that require traveling through some pretty skinny water that loves to eat props. I'd think a jon boat or tunnel hull with a jet outboard and an electric trolling motor would be ideal.
1131182,Steve of Madison,2009-08-24 14:51:00,230,Then try one and report back.Glad to hear from you BUM!!!
1131222,Fishoil,2009-08-24 17:16:00,1277,"Thank you very much for your input Steve of Madison, it was very helpful in my search for info on jet boats. NOT!!!"
1131354,Bill Krejca,2009-08-25 07:36:00,6107,"A final thought - one of my sons-in-law has an inboard jet boat, and he has found it is somewhat difficult to maneuver at slow speeds. He has to really plan his approach to a dock, etc. Bill Krejca"
