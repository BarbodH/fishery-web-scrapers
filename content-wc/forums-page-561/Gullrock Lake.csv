The cabin on the shore by the clay banks has water lapping at it's footings and the little out building on the same property is surrounded by water.I have been out once this week for an hour, between the rain storms, and only got a couple in 22 feet of water at stevenson's point. today it isn't supposed to rain until the afternoon so maybe i'll get a couple more hours in this morning. have a safe trip up , maybe i'll see you on the lake."

About 50 miles north of Minneapolis traffic came to a stand still I went about a mile and a half in an hour. It took about an hour and a half to get through it. Both going north and coming home you will hit that construction. There is also some construction going on between Dryden and Vermillion Bay but I got through that pretty quick... Mike

1128709,fish bookie,2009-08-14 06:53:00,53,hello fellow fisherman and ladies just wondering what the conditions have been like up on the rock the water high or low temp and all that good stuff my family and i are heading up on the 21 for a week we are at procyks anglers paradise any tips or clues would be great if any color is working better then others the last couple of years it seems to me that color is a big deal and size of jig but i would like to cast for some nice wallys so if there is a better spot to do that please let me know (if you can let those secrets out ) i would love to find some nice sunken islands or structure someplace along two island to the rock thax fish bookie
1128714,Pezman38,2009-08-14 07:25:00,3196,"Hello, I just got back from my annual trip to GullRock lake and Wrights Wilderness Camp. Fishing was good on 100% minnows. We tried gulp and worms when the bite was hot with nothing going unless a minnow was on your hook. Jig and spinners were main tackle although a few were caught trolling crankbaits. Water depths of fish were all over, 12 foot down to 30 we caught fish on the windward side of points and islands. We just missed some bad weather the weeks prior and most of our trip had brief rain and about 60 degree weather. Hot colors were firetiger and white jigs: Gold, Silver, and holographic blades on the spinners, size 4 usually. Pike were slow going. Did manage to catch a few jigging, but the nicer fish came casting Suicks in the weedlines. Also caught a few on shad raps slow rolling them. Good Luck!"
1128716,Pezman38,2009-08-14 07:28:00,3196,Saw a post before me that wanted to know water conditions. Aug 1-7 the water was at least 2 foot higher than normal and only 65 degrees tops. Good thing to keep in mind while running around to make sure you avoid the Gull Rock and other rocky areas that you definetly can't see now.
1128774,tackleman,2009-08-14 10:33:00,444,Iowa point is the point on the left hand side entering the river heading to 2 island lake right across from the boot.
1128787,fish bookie,2009-08-14 11:10:00,53,thax cstalzer for the info so what else can we figure on up there. how are the weed beds looking? I have heard that they are few and far between and not to thick can i get some knowledge on those. and where they are at this year is there a better place to fish for northerns then other places and what size were the ones your crew caught last year we caught 3 over 40 inches anything with size on your trip any help would be awesome oh yeah the wallys what are there size it seems like they have been getting bigger the last 2 to 3 years. last year we caught tons at 17 to 23 inches and 4 over 27.5 anything like that for your crew thax fish bookie
1129055,2746,2009-08-15 17:53:00,3206,"Just got back from Gullrock and 5 lakes lodge. Bumped into Tackelman on the south side of burnt one evening and, for the record, he's better looking in person than in his picture. Weather seems to be finally turning into summer up there and we had 2 or 3 days of hot 80+ days. Larger fish were coming out of 30-35' of water on those hot days. Good numbers in the 20""-25"" range and plenty of eaters. All in all a good trip. Leeches and minnows did well but crawlers were slow. Spinners worked ok but we had better luck with plain snells and a slow presentation or simply jigging. As others have said just about any island or drop off but be willing to check all depths and don't be afraid to venture into deeper water if the bite is slow."
1129287,Pezman38,2009-08-17 08:31:00,3196,"Fish bookie, From everyone we talked to up there the weedbeds were very slow to come this year. Biggest fish in our group was a fat 33 that we caught at the claybanks one night. We tried mostly the claybanks and did hit a couple weedbeds on the east side of the 3 sisters. Nothing was caught by the 3 sisters but the weedbed did look really good with weeds coming up about a foot below the surface in 7-8 foot of water. We were fishing on one of the only days we saw the sun, so I would imagine the sunlight turned them off in that area. Biggest walleye in our group was a 26 but we caught a bunch 20"". I caught at least 8 between 23""-25"" so it was a great trip for me. LarryM's post was spot on on the depths we fished, a couple times we hit 30' of water and hit a over 20"". Here are a couple pics from the trip, with some luck I hope you dwarf these."
1129453,fish bookie,2009-08-17 17:56:00,53,Nice fish fellas! Some pretty fish you must have caught those on the north side of the lake they have such nice color up there thax for the info it will come in handy in 5 days and counting down well if anyone else is going up next week look me up i'll be there fishin my ars off if you are down by procyks give me a yell ask for the book man or any more info from anyone will be great fish bookie
1129652,SNOPRO,2009-08-18 11:12:00,108,I'll be headed to Golden Hook on Sat. the 22nd.The weather forcast looks good thru tues. Hopefully the nitecrawler will be hot as were taking quite a few up. I've got a Black/silver 1775 Lund PROV w/135 Merc with Iowa boat letters. What boat will you be fishing out of? Maybe we'll see you!!!!........Steve

1117819,dirt,2009-07-01 14:14:00,144,"Just got back Sunday. Had a great trip. Walleye were where they weren´t supposed to be this time of year. Caught a lot of fish in under 10 feet of water. Nothing in over 15 feet. Had good luck the last day where the river dumps into Keg. Caught A LOT of trophies this year. One guy pulled in a 42"" northern throwing a shad rap for walleye. Mostly used minnows and crawlers. Color and rigs didn´t seem to matter just so there was a little speed. Backtrolling worked better than drifting. Seems like they wanted the bait moving. Hope this helps. HAVE A GREAT TRIP!!!!"
1117886,tackleman,2009-07-01 18:01:00,444,"After spending the last 2 weeks on the road and in Southern Ontario, it was great to be home and go fishing.We went to the toe of the boot and in 1 1/2 hours we got about 30 walleye in 17 to 25 feet of water using minnows.I talked to a fellow who bought 4 pounds of leeches and they arrived last friday, he's down to his last pound of leeches. When I talked to a camp owner when I was getting my minnows he told me the walleye were in 10 to 13 feet, but at the boot this is not the case. the water temp was only 59 degrees and you had to have a relatively slow presentation, I used a hammered silver spinner and a purple spinner after i lost the hammered silver and it was fish after fish."

I noticed a lot of the members on this forum have been really helpful to some new comers looking for a few tips. I am not sure how to change my presention and depth based on changes that happen in September. Also, I was hoping for a few ideas on fishing spots on the south end of the lake, I've got to make sure the lady catches a few fish! Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you!"
1128199,Moondog,2009-08-11 22:55:00,362,Where the heck is Iowa Point? Mary says that the water levels are at an all time high.
1128306,Guest,2009-08-12 12:47:00,0,Mid Sept usually has them on gradual slopes in 15-20 on the points and islands near gullrock. I see people using minnows mostly.
