1129942,stevensinks,2009-08-19 11:13:00,330,It has been 2 1/2 weeks since I left so I dont have any current fishing reports. But I can tell you that the lake is way up.

You will need a towel and the bedding is provided. Freezer in the cabin and a nice fish cleaning house. They want the guests to release all walleyes over 18.1 and northerns in the slot and over...It keeps the fishing great! We are headed up Sept 12th. High water will make new rocks to watch out for!"
