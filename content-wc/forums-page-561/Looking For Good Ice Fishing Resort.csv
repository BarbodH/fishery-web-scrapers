1130511,Guest,2009-08-21 10:20:00,0,"Good Afternoon, I have a job that unfortunately does not allow me to leave the golf course during the summer months for a Canadian fishing trip anymore.. I was wondering if anyone here can tell me where I can find a remote camp that has good ice fishing during the winter months? I have somewhat convinced the group I used to go to Lac Seul with to try a winter trip but we do not know where to start. Driving is not an issue but we would like to stay in Ontario or close by as we are leaving from Illinois. Thank you for yur help!! If you want to email me you can at : [email protected] Jason"
