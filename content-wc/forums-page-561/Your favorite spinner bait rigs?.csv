1129833,Hawkfan,2009-08-18 22:16:00,237,"Good advice Sin. I agree completely. And sometimes its that stinger hook that catches the lip. They don't seem to go any farther down the mouth than the first hook. One other question...what kind of success, if any, have people had with the Shake-E Blade harness?I also fly out a week from Saturday!"
1129865,bob oh,2009-08-19 06:32:00,3936,I don't have problems feeding them since I only use 1 hook and half a crawler for casting. Maybe you need a full crawler when trolling?
1130205,Steve of Madison,2009-08-20 08:37:00,230,"True! But nothing more enticing than a snake of a nightcrawler moving thru the water to get one of the ""big girls"" dander up. I use a half when I tip my jig or under a slip-bobber."
1129477,villain189,2009-08-17 19:18:00,33,"We usually use a rig called ""Best"" brand ""Go-Getters"" basically just a single spinner & single hook harness rig. Seem to work very well for us backtrolling.Wanted to bring a few other spinner rigs up there with us this year and just wondering what everyones favorite 'off the shelf' spinner rigs/harnesses for backtrolling are?"
1129486,JayM5209,2009-08-17 19:47:00,1050,"Villian,I don't buy spinners off the shelf, so probably shouldn't be replying to your query, but there's a better option. For less than 10% of the cost of off the shelf spinners I spend several winter evenings (or summer evenings, too) tying up rigs for our whole party of five or six.I buy the components in bulk (BPS, Cabelas, other online sources), using 10# Trilene XT, one #2 baitholder hook, a quick change clevis, and 4 or 5 beads of assorted colors between the clevis and hook. No tools or jigs needed, it's quick to snell a hook, add the beads and clevis, and tie a double surgeon's loop by hand. Everyone in the party gets about 25 rigs plus a small plastic box containing 50 (+/-) #3 and #4 Indiana blades in assorted colors, more hammered bronze and hammered nickle than any other color. On the water it's easy to select or change color or size of blade as the situation dictates.Been doing it for years and it meets our needs for spinner rigs (crawler, leech, or minnows). I spend way too much for fishing gear, but I just can't bring myself to pay the off the shelf price for any spinners on the market, regardless of the brand or amount of fisherman appeal, esdpecially when they can be tied at home for a small fraction of the retail cost."
1129515,archer66,2009-08-17 21:31:00,21,I'm a homemade spinner rig guy myself....almost exactly like JayM5209 described.
1129556,Lazy Fisherman,2009-08-18 06:18:00,276,"Yes, the homemade spinners work great and the price is right."
1129591,Steve of Madison,2009-08-18 08:04:00,230,"I am a homemade spinner guy too. I tie crawler rigs, leech and minnow, each having thier own little fine tuned quirks. I use #2 heavy wire red tru-turn hooks for minnow rigs, they have that turn on the shank very similar to the ""slow death"" and the fish are hooked in the side of the mouth everytime, very few mis-hits. For the crawler rigs I use #4 circle or octopus hooks. I use interchangeable cleavis so I can switch blades, it's also easier to store them on the tubes without the blades. I have experimented with many different lines, but XL is always my go to, I tried a light braid but that stuff tangles so easy and when that fish is flopping around in the net it ends up a messI figure I can make up 50 for about $20 or $0.40 each, not including blades. If you are afraid of snelling, just untie one to find out how really simple that knot really is, my grandson is now tieing his own for our next trip."
1129614,bob oh,2009-08-18 09:03:00,3936,"I tie 1-hook harnesses for drifting and casting. I use 15 or 20 lb fluorocarbon, quick-change clevises and #2 gamy octopus hooks. Stiffer line really cuts tangles."
1129629,Lovetofish,2009-08-18 09:58:00,458,Same deal here......I tie my own on fluorocarbon line on a #2 hook. Someday I'll go to the quick change cleves if I ever outlive the ones I have in my spinner rig box. I use a handful of blade colors and they all seem to work. But my favorite is still a jig.
1129731,villain189,2009-08-18 16:12:00,33,"Looks like I'll be learning to tie some spinner next year...our trip this year is in a week so I'll probably just go packaged again for this year. What do you guys think of putting a 'stinger' hook trailing like this? And would you use this only with minnows or worms also? I don't think i'd want to use this too often, just curious what the thought here was on them...seems like you'd be hooking the fish very deep and likely to kill them with that stinger hook, doesn't it? http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...028&hasJS=true"
1129778,SinOrSwim,2009-08-18 19:00:00,1528,Since nobody really answered your question other than telling you to tie your own I'll give you my opinion. I use the Cabelas brand bait rigs. Usually a combination of floating single hook and stinger hook in gold and silver. If I could take one thing with me on our fly-in each year it would be gold and silver harnesses. Silver if down to only one choice. Most years I could pretty much leave everything else at home. We fly out a week from Saturday!
1129829,Steve of Madison,2009-08-18 22:07:00,230,"I have looked at these as examples for tieing my own, my only concern is that for minnows I really prefer the longer shank. For leeches these look really good and for crawlers multiple hooks are the only way to go, unless you want to ""feed"" them the back half of your crawler all day."
