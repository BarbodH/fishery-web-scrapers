1129294,buzzard9311,2009-08-17 08:47:00,6,anyone have any suggestion on how to catch leeches. we see them all the time deer horn lodge when on the beaches having shore lunches. there must be more than just the ones we see and are able to catch by hand.they work well for walleye and are very durable on the hook.

They also show you how to separate the Horse Leeches from the bait Leeches."
