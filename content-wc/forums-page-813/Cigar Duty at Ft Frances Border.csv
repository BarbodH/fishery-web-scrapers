539968,Guest,2004-05-26 09:54:00,0,I think you can bring 50 per person duty free.
540037,Guest,2004-05-27 19:45:00,0,You can bring two boxes across the boarder without paying any duty.
540040,Guest,2004-05-27 20:53:00,0,You can bring Cuban cigars across the border into the US legally? Since when?

540059,Guest,2004-05-28 11:44:00,0,"Maybe I misunderstood. I was thinking the original poster was talking about bringing US Cigars into Canada. As far as I know, it's still not legal to bring Cuban cigars into the US."
540123,Guest,2004-05-30 15:31:00,0,"They catch you bringing Cuban smokes back to the States from Canada you get sent to Guantanamo Bay for a minimum 2 year stint among the ""terrorists"" that are there. You're better off getting caught with a few hundred Walleye over the limit, a Polar Bear rug, a half pound of BC Bud than the Cuban smokes."
540131,Guest,2004-05-30 20:22:00,0,"50 cigars max. Any more than that and you pay duty. Also, the only thing special about cuban cigars is that they're illegal here in the states. You can get cigars in the U.S. that are made in the Dominican Republic or Nicaragua that are just as good if not better."
540198,Guest,2004-06-02 07:21:00,0,Sorry about the confusion. I actually BOUGHT some Cubans in Red Lake - I didn't cross the border with any cigars last year. Thanks for the help from everyone.
