Fishing was very good with the fish having spawned and moving out of spawning areas back onto points etc. Found them in 8-13' of water. Weather was typical spring for Canada....cool, occassioanl rain and mixture of clouds and sunshine. Planes were going and coming regularly. Enjoy your trip....would guess fishing will be excellent."
