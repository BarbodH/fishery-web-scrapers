540119,MrEyes,2004-05-30 12:09:00,360,"Ron, I just fished Lac Suel May 22-28. The fishing was OUTSTANDING but the weather was cold and wet. We fished over by the sanctuary and could catch fish 1 out of every 3 cast. We also fished the mouth of Sawmill, there is a little yellow sign on the westside of the entrance that says ""Herbs Point"" there seemed to be alot of walleye on there when the wind was blowing towards that point. Fish the points where the wind blows bait fish up on. I was dragging a 1/8 ounce (WHITE) jig. My buddy was fishing a orange jig at first, then I started bringing in fish he switched. I would just pitch a jig out in the current and just slowly drag the jig back. When the bite was hot you could feel the fish hit. When the bite was slow you would just drag the jig and when it stopped you would set the hook. Sometimes you would get a snag and sometimes it would be a fish. The water is up quite a bit from last year. I would say with all the rain they have been getting, the level might be up 4ft from last year. On our way home there was flooding on serveral roads in the area. If I can help any other way send me an email at: [email protected] Mark"

540213,Guest,2004-06-02 11:52:00,0,OK I was there the same time you were and the same spots. I didn't see anyone catching 1 every three casts. The weather was lousy and the fishing got slow after the 25th. Which boat were you in anyway?
