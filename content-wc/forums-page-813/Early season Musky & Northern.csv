I know that the weather has been colder than normal and I was wondering what water temps, and structure we should be targeting for the toothy critters. I have fished the lake for 4 years but we have primarily fished for the eyes this is our first year concentrating on the Northern and Musky. I am willing to put in long days of casting I would just like to know I'm fishing in areas that should hold big fish. Any help (ie. water temps, structure, lures ext..) would be greatly appreciated. tight lines afuges"
