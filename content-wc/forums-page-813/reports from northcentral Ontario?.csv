I heard the weather person there say this spring has been the 3rd coldest on record for Manitoba. The weather in NW Ontario has to be about that way. We got rained on by a COLD rain every day and/or night. The wind was mostly from the E and it was cloudy almost all the time. The water temp was in the high 40's in the main lake and the highest we saw in one bay was about 55 but that was unusual. Mostly the water temp was 52-53 in the bays. The fishing was as bad as the weather. We were near Dryden.

It was cool and fairly wet all last week (with frost Saturday May 29) But it warmed up dramatically that day and it was first day for blackflies to come out. Water is high most places due to very wet May month. The walleye bite for me was pretty finicky , with only luck in evenings after 7:30 pm.(minnows and worms) Pike however were quite accommodating! jake ps careful on the highways, the moose are out day and night, many many sightings! and they do wreck a truck grille/bumper or car!"
540189,Guest,2004-06-01 20:29:00,0,Coldest Spring I can remember in NW Ontario. We did well on fish in the rivers. Probably two weeks back from a regular year. Low and slow..real slow. Got some good fish so far but worked a bit. It helps to know the area.
