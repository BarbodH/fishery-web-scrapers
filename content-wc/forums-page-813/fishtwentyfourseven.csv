His record was spotless before the incident and since. Is he going to be allowed into Canada for our trip this year? Also, does anyone have the number to the Ministry in case we have any other questions? If it will help...he won't be driving any of the vehicles across the border. Thank you all for your help. fish24/7"

Get in touch with them and explain the situation, they will give you the straight goods - http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/can-am/...at=84%&did=397 I am quite sure he will need to make arrangements at a cost of $200 for a temporary entry permit regardless whether he is driving or not. DUI is a felony in Canada and is treated much more seriously than in the States."
