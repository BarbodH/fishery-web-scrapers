539501,AceMan,2004-05-13 19:03:00,1,Illinijeeps I know you are going to miss me this year. Who will be there for you when you need a dip net? Aceman
539504,Guest,2004-05-13 20:09:00,0,"Our group of 9 will be up there in 2 weeks. Can't wait. With all the rain and snow, and hopefully with normal to slightly above normal temps, the smallmouth up shallow and hitting. I like to fish some Crappie, along with the usual walleye and muskie. We have had some memorable times at Minaki. We used to fish the French, and go back occasionally, but Minaki is our base. Hope you all have a great trip, Don"
539515,Guest,2004-05-14 07:18:00,0,"Illinijeeps: This is the SD connection. Looking forward to seeing you guys again. Our group of nine will be there from 6/19-26. I am sure Fergie still owns it. Good fishing, Jim"
539519,Guest,2004-05-14 07:34:00,0,"Don: We usually go up there late June/July, but since I am retired, I thought it would be fun to try Minaki in early June for some shallow water fishing. Four of us(three young guys and one old retired guy) will coming up 6/2-9 and staying at Paradise cove. Where are you guys staying? Maybe we could get together and swap stories, lies or whatever! Good Fishing, Jim(SD connection)"
539520,Guest,2004-05-14 07:44:00,0,I'm here eagerly awaiting June 14th. Don't care what the gas prices are I'd still go if they were $10/gallon.
539528,Guest,2004-05-14 09:18:00,0,"Jim, We are staying at Birch Island Resort, and will be there May 27-June 3. If you all get in on June 2, and are not too tired, come over around 6:45 PM, dinner is at 7, and I will give you a report on the patterns we have discovered. I can tell you right now that the #11 rapala floating minnow is great on the smallmouth. (Crush barbs makes it easy to get the treble hooks out, and is easier on the smallmouth). I like to use mainly tubes, but the fishing is not quite as fast. We use 1/16 ounce lead heads with 2 inch grubs on 6 pound test to catch crappie, along with smallmouth up to 18 inches, tons of perch and pike, and some walleye shallow. I tie a barrow swivel on, and use a 14 pound, 10-12 inch stren florocarbon leader to decrease bite offs to a large extent. The leaders need to be changed after they are nicked by the Pike and Musky. Our group caught 5 Muskies last year on tender tubes on 8 pound test line shallow, fishing for smallmouth. Our website from last year's trip is www.teamcorrell.com. Have a great trip, Don"

539533,Guest,2004-05-14 10:41:00,0,"Hi Jim: I will also be at Paridise Cove 2 in cabin 6 from the 6th of June until the 12th so stop in and say hello. I have been going to Minaki area for the last 35 years, but have never fished crappie on the Winnipeg flowage. Could someone help out a first time crappie fisherman and share some of the locations that I might get lucky. Thanks dwrisch"
539539,Guest,2004-05-14 12:40:00,0,Don for crappie go on up to hidden lake (or lost lake as I call it)....there are a ton of crappie in that little lake and they aren't too hard to catch. You can boat right into that lake from the SE end of Big Sand.
