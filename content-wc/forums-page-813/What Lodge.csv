539944,Guest,2004-05-25 20:58:00,0,I have a chance to take my 12-year old son on a Canadian fishing trip this year and it would be his first. Due to his sports schedule we would not be able to go until mid-late August. I would like to take him to a drive-in lodge with a 3-4 day trip planned. Does anyone have any suggestions on a good lodge that has good fishing and a reasonable rates. I would plan on cooking our own meals. Any advice with links to the lodges would be appreciated.

539952,Guest,2004-05-26 06:48:00,0,"I highly recommend Witch Bay Camp on Lake of the Woods. It is an American Plan (they cook the meals), so it doesn't fit that part of your plan. However, it is a drive-to camp, with great camp boats, nice cabins, very good food, and the fishing for walleye, northern, muskies and smallmouth are very good to excellent. In addition, they have a ""fishing program"" where they have very experienced fishermen -- pros, guides, authors, etc. -- in camp all season long to give advice and on-the-water assistance to the guests. It's a great way for a young fisherman to get his feet wet on LOTW. I don't believe you would ever regret going there. Good luck."

539987,DaveIN,2004-05-26 13:14:00,191,Check out Separation Lake Lodge as they have housekeeping cabins where you can do the cooking. I know the fishing is great during August as I have been there in August for the last three years.
