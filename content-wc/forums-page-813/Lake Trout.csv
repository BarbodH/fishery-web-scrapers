540142,Guest,2004-05-31 09:25:00,0,"What lake are you fishing? We are going to be lake trout fishing the week of June 5 and we use mainly spoons. Sutton spoons if you can find them, sevaint spoons, z spoons or any spoon that has a flutter action and that is real thin. We usually fish for them relatively shallow because the water is still pretty cold."
