540162,Guest,2004-05-31 23:46:00,0,Hi. we went there for about 5 years when the kids were young. I think the fishing was pretty good. we always ate plenty of them and took home the limit. I dont remember catching many walleyes but then we were happy to catch anything. It was our first forey into canada and we seemed to find a lot of rock with the engine... then we spent the next 15 or so going to lac saul. the last 3 have been on LOTW.
