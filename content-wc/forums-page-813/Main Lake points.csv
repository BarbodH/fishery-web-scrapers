540178,Guest,2004-06-01 14:41:00,0,"Just returned today from Lac Seul. Was there from Wednesday until Monday morning. The weather was really tough on Wed and on Sunday. Wind, sleet, snow and waves 3-4 feet. However, we managed to catch alot of nice walleye and pike. The weather was good on Thurs., Friday, and Saturday and the walleye cranked it up. Largest eye was 26"" and pike was 42"". I do have a question; started fishing this main lake point one evening and just killed the walleye. Went back the next day and again caught a boat load of slotters and above. So guess what, went back that same evening about an hour before sunset and could only catch small eyes. Not to give up....went back on saturday and could only find small eyes. What is happening when that occurs? I realize the walleye are probably in transition from spawning areas but couldn't figure out only small fish. I'm talking well below the slot. Should I have moved deeper or what. Over all the trip was excellent and a good time had by all. Thanks in advance...eyesnatcher"
