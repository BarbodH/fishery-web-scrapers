We have a lake map and have talked with one person who has fished this lake. Just wondering if anyone has any information on Press Lake? Anything at all would be helpful, thanks."

I don't think you can get back to those threads but you can try searching for ""Press Lake"" in the Canada, Fishing report, and General discussion forums. If I can find the info I sent to some other WC members, I will send it along to you."
