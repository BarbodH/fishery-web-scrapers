6218908,That Minnesota guy,2018-07-09 07:28:00,8293,"The way society is today all enforcement has their defenses up from the git go I would guess. I mean look at the abuse some border and DNR agents (both sides of the border) take for just doing their jobs. Look at the cops, they can't hardly make a traffic stop without having it filmed by everybody. We reap what we sow. Treat our fellow humans better and maybe we in turn will get treated better?"
6218910,martinbns,2018-07-09 07:28:00,1520,"I have only been checked once on the water and everything was cool. They asked to see my livewells and bait, asked me where I bought the minnows, advised me as a non-resident of Ontario to keep my receipt which was yet a rule but was coming. I think as a law abiding citizen, the more often I get checked the better. When I used to hunt a lot I always found it reassuring when I saw road stop coming out of a popular area, meant they were going to catch more ******* poachers."
6218922,troutwater,2018-07-09 07:45:00,299,"This is my attitude as well, but I've only been checked a few times by wardens. Each time was a pleasant exchange. I've seen some clear abuse and violations of regulations before, so I'm always happy to see them out."
6218946,fishsammich,2018-07-09 08:09:00,169,"I like to see the enforcement as well. Nothing irks me more than seeing people not playing by the rules. I've literally had the wardens go right past me and check boats ahead of me, without checking me. Maybe it's my honest face, or they have already watched me enough to know I'm never going to be over the limit and I'm pretty particular about what goes in the box. I won't even let a fish go in the box, without personally measuring it. For us, walleye have to be >16"". I won't keep one under 16 1/4"", drives my brother nuts. My livewell, my responsibility."
6220314,green avenger,2018-07-11 20:30:00,3,"A sting operation took place at the Thousand Island,NY border crossing on July 7 where any automobile pulling a boat was required to pull over prior to the border crossing. One of the dozen or so agents approached my window , gave a speech about all of the fishing opportunities available in Canadian waters and asked where we had been fishing. I answered his question and he asked if we had any fish. I only had 2 in the cooler even knowing I had mistakenly failed to leave the skin on the walleye and pike. He asked to see them and I handed the fillets over at which point he asked if I had read the rules and regulations, yada yada yada. I had to wait 10 minutes for the ticket to be written up for having 2 unidentifiable fish. Cost is $125. They cut me a break by not adding another $100 fine for not packaging in a way where they can count the fillets. I had them in saran wrap but not frozen side by side. The agents were not rude nor arrogant in any way. They carried on pleasant conversations with my wife and myself while the ticket was being written up by a different agent. First time in over 20 years crossing this border that such an operation had taken place. I asked if there were many people being caught with violations. The agent replied the very first vehicle had a complete cooler full of fish seized."
6218216,Obabikon,2018-07-07 06:16:00,2370,"Yes. You should clean them, leave a patch of skin on them... when you're ready to cook them, pull the patch of skin, and cook them. The point is, they have to be identifiable. Otherwise, I could have a bag of small walleye fillets in the fridge for 2-3 days, and just tell the officer we're eating that big bag of perch tonight for dinner. From the officer's stand point, it makes sense. They are lied to constantly... so they established a set of rules that would eliminate the ability to lie in certain circumstances. If a police officer writes me a ticket for 4 MPH over the speed limit, who is to blame? I know the rules... even if I was barely breaking the law, I was still breaking it. Most police officers let that slide... but that doesn't mean all of them will. If you honestly could show that you had just finished cleaning them, and were just about to cook them... I doubt they would give you a ticket. But... that's an officer giving you a break. The rule is cleaned fish have to be able to be identified."
6218232,Huntindave,2018-07-07 06:59:00,2194,"This particular regulation, as written in the booklet, is really written in plain English and should be easy enough to understand."
6218252,Shellback,2018-07-07 08:18:00,8083,If only the printed books were available! I haven't been able to see one in years. I just look a my zone regulations online.
6218258,Huntindave,2018-07-07 08:47:00,2194,"Doesn't matter if the ""booklet"" is a hard copy or online, the wording is the same. I have started downloading the online PDF directly to my phone. That way I always have the regs, they take up no extra room and I can enlarge the type size to where I can read all of it. I carry a copy of all my paperwork (boat registration, insurance, fishing lisc., trailer registration, etc) on my phone as well. It's nice and convenient to do so. I also have the paper copies too, if needed, just not all in the same place."
6218348,Shellback,2018-07-07 15:45:00,8083,"So here are the regs I found. Granted they seem to be talking about size limits, but it states, ""unless"" Sounds like you do need to have a piece of skin attached, but you could chunk a fish. It is contrary to the Ontario Fishery Regulations to stock or transport live sport fish without a permit. Anglers need to ensure they are transporting fish in compliance with the regulations, which are designed to protect fisheries resources. The fish that you catch and keep may be cleaned. However, please remember that fish taken from waterbodies where size limits are in effect must be readily measurable at all times, unless the fish are: Being prepared for immediate consumption  Prepared at an overnight accommodation for storage  Being transported on the water from a temporary overnight accommodation to your residence and you are not engaged in sport fishing  Being transported overland. Do not transport live fish overland in a livewell filled with water. Fish must be dead and should be transported on ice. In addition, when packaging fish you must ensure that a conservation officer can easily determine:  The number of fish in your possession  The species of fish in your possession. This may require leaving a large patch of skin, the head, or some other identifying feature depending on the species of fish (e.g., Lake Whitefish vs. Lake Herring Here's another thing I don't understand. I fish the St Lawrence which is the same zone as Lake Ontario. If I fish a lake 100 yards inland, different zone and different size limit in the regs. How do I, or how does a CO prove where the fish came from?"
6218420,5thsuit,2018-07-07 21:46:00,54,"If you are within your limit and only keeping Walleye, I do not see how having a fillet without a patch is an issue? Many times we have a leftover uncooked fillet we eat the next day."
6218650,Obabikon,2018-07-08 14:28:00,2370,"Interesting thing... the CO isn't the one that needs to prove it. If he stops you in a zone where whatever you have is illegal, and decides to give you a ticket... you would need to prove your innocence in court if you wished to contest it. Most officers right on the border of zones would be used to this. As a fisherman, I would never be actively fishing in a zone where I wasn't completely legal in THAT zone."
6218782,kzoofisher,2018-07-08 20:39:00,5144,"Re: Shellback's issue. A Michigan forum had a similar discussion because of differences in size and creel limits in different parts of the State. I talked to some DNR personnel at a meeting and this is what it boils down to for them with the way the rules are written. You can have 3 days limit while transporting fish, 1 fresh and 2 processed by freezing or preserving in some way. This applies only to when you are traveling. The rules say nothing about possession being wherever you are or even in your belly, unlike Ontario which says one day in any way shape or form. Once you get home there is no possession limit because it would be too hard for a prosecutor to prove that you didn't get your fish in a variety of jurisdictions and weren't completely legal each time. If you took a 3 day trip to Saginaw Bay you could return with 24 13"" fish, go to Erie the next day and come back with 5 20"" fish and never have broken any law. 29 fish in the freezer and you're good to go for the next day. Michigan could rewrite the rule to say that you can't have more than 3 days limit per licensed angler in each household but many people give fish away to family and friends and such a change would be very unpopular. What it boils down to is Ontario has a very different and much stricter view of fish limits than Michigan. Maybe much stricter than your State, too. They don't seem to care much if you fished a couple jurisdictions in a couple days, you are in their jurisdiction now and will stick to their rules. It ain't worth the trouble to me so I'll keep the 2 fish on my conservation license, eat them within a couple hours and not keep anymore until the next day. If I'm on the edge of two areas I'll stick with the rules of the one that is more restrictive. It's easier and gives me peace of mind. When I'm in Canada the fewer worries I have the happier I am. It's why I go."
6218862,Shellback,2018-07-09 05:37:00,8083,"I would hope so, but there's always that one ""guy"". I don't think there is any way that you could land on Canadian soil with fish taken legally on Ontario or the St Lawrence without breaking the size limit for the in shore zone."
6218902,fishsammich,2018-07-09 07:17:00,169,"Maybe I have good luck, maybe I just fish in the right/ wrong places? I've only been checked once by the game wardens in the past 20+ yrs. & that was a US federal warden, about a mile from my house. Fishing perch from shore in the spring , right on the line with federal land. He said the main reason he stopped to check me was to see if I had crossed into federal land with my atv, to get to the spot. Very positive encounter . He checked my papers and my licenses. He walked my tracks in and out to see where my atv had been. I had no idea that atv's were not allowed on federal land but not an issue since I stayed out of there. This was an old timer warden, he actually had a personality. I've talked to a couple younger wardens in the past couple years (just see them at the landings watching fisherman when I'm scoping spots) and they seem to have a totally different attitude than the old wardens. Can't even carry on a conversation or ask about the bite or a simple question, with our local guy. All buisness attitude and it feels like he doesn't want to be bothered. I was used to our warden back home , who (way before cell phones) we could call anytime with a rules question and he was always eager to help explain it to us so we could be legal. Always eager to help, sometimes even pointing a guy to where the limits were being caught. I don't get that feeling with the younger wardens. Maybe I'm just getting old......"
6217538,walleyecheek,2018-07-05 07:36:00,2231,30 yrs going to the same resort I have never had this happen. Last year we're all sitting around having a few BLUES and the MNR (2 of them) walked down (always dressed like a million bucks you know what I mean) I was frying fish in the outside cooker. One went in the cabin to check the freezer the other one was outside asking me to show him the fish in the fryer. Now our group likes me to chunk up the fish before I cook it. I'm sorry but that was downright Harassment. I was as hot as the oil and probably should thank my lucky stars that I didn't leave there in handcuffs. That's Bull !!!!!
6217548,Obabikon,2018-07-05 07:44:00,2370,"The rule is, the fish have to be identifiable until you are actively cooking them. I once got a firm talking to when I had a bowl of walleye fillets at 11AM... I was literally starting the fire to begin shore lunch. He was pretty relaxed about it though. I told him they were all walleye... so obviously I wasn't trying to sneak in extras. Just count the fillets. I'm a little more cautious about when I pull the skins off, but not too much. Especially if I'm cooking all walleye. All of that said, if they're going to chunk them... chunk, bread, fry. (shouldn't take more than a couple minutes)"
6217550,That Minnesota guy,2018-07-05 07:51:00,8293,"Well what did you expect them to do? They have a job to do, if you weren't doing anything wrong whats the problem? Are you also offended if they ask to see your license?"
6217552,Obabikon,2018-07-05 07:57:00,2370,"I think I misread. ""NOW your group wants you to chunk them"" (since the officer checked) . I was reading it like your group always wanted you to chunk them... and he was giving you a hard time over chunked up fish. I personally don't think there was much wrong. A little inconvenient to do it while you're cooking. If you're legal, then there's no problem at all. He'll look in the fryer, and ask ""how many walleyes are you cooking"". You answer the question, his buddy counts the fish in the freezer, and everyone should be good to go."
6217656,Pooch,2018-07-05 10:23:00,4618,"That isn't ""Harassment"" by any means. Just guys doing their jobs. ""Dressed like a million bucks""? I'd call it professionalism. I doubt they enjoy wearing a uniform in the hot weather in or out of the bush.We've been checked many times over the years in the cabin and on the water and I have yet to meet a CO that was anywhere near disrespectful or aggressive. Regular guys with a tough job to do. Compliance checks are probably the easy part of their jobs.Don't fret over it. It really isn't a big deal. Don't make it the focus of your trip memories. Sounds like you were catching fish anyway. Sometimes folks don't even do that.Out of curiosity, what lake or camp? The only time I've ever seen CO's get drop dead serious was on a flagrant violation of size and quantity on Lake Savant by one cabin. That cabin had been a PITA all week and there was little sympathy for them from the rest of the camp.Pooch"
6217724,v-bay gord,2018-07-05 13:30:00,3168,"You might have to expand on your post to tell us about what you consider harassment. CO's can ask to go into your cabin, but you can refuse. On the other hand if you have nothing to hide why would you?"
6217944,rockape,2018-07-06 07:44:00,215,"When they ask if you have fish (legal amount) back at the cabin, always say no. If you say yes, then you have to go back there and show them. Ruins your fishing for the day if you are a long way out. I was hanging at the cabin drinking some brews around 4pm a few years ago. MNR showed up at the door and asked for a look. I had a bowl of leftover fried fillets from the night before. Maybe 2-3 fish at most and I think one of them was a pike. MNR guy was cool, and he enjoyed my pic of the 48 inch musky I caught the day before. It's simple. Don't break the rules. I actually like talking to the MNR guys. Like others have said. They are doing their job, and without them, the fishing wouldn't be as good as it is."
6217954,CI_Guy,2018-07-06 08:00:00,2118,"I've read the original post several times to see if I was missing something. I can't find anything strange or harassing about this fish check. If you were ""as hot as the oil"" it sounds more like an anger management issue."
6217970,Shellback,2018-07-06 08:57:00,8083,"Actively cooking them? Cripes! So if you came in after fishing, prepared your fish for the nights meal, then put them in the fridge and went and got a shower, you could be in violation?"
