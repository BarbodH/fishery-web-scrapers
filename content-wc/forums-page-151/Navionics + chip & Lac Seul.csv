Supposedly, users send mapping data into Navionics, and the map is updated to include more accurate data. I found no apparent changes in the map the time I did the updates. (It seemed like a waste of $100.) Any thoughts or experiences to share? Also: I recently picked up a Helix 10, and plan to use Autochart Live to map some of our usual spots, and chart some cautious exploration. Am looking forward to that activity. I used this function recently in Ontario waters on Lake of the Woods NWA, and found areas where the Lakemaster map was off by many feet"

If they're getting any updates on contours, I haven't seen them. I also have used Navionics for Lac Seul and it obviously is not surveyed in detail. Not all hazards are marked, and contours are not precise. I haven't paid for updates for a couple of years, and now that I have Humminbird Auto Chart Live, I'm not likely to."
