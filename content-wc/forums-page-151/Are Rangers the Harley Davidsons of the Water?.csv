6219890,Boondock,2018-07-10 21:51:00,1056,Lol do a little search around here in case you haven't seen quite a few threads about problems with them. Ole Johnny took them over and quality and qc have gone down hill from what I've seen. Lund and ranger are over rated imo.
6216897,Esoxchaser,2018-07-03 15:56:00,1576,"I am the original owner of a 10 yr old Ranger. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not abused. We fish, we swim, we laze about. We have fun. I have been on peoples boats who were super picky (Anal as all get out) About their boat. Had no fun at all. Afraid a crumb off my sandwich may hit the deck. Screw that silliness. My boat is a tool. It's gets used. Lets use it and have fun."
6216986,pan-man,2018-07-03 19:24:00,299,I have owned a ranger and alumacraft at same time. I got sick of worrying about up keep of ranger. So I sold the ranger but still have alumacraft. I'm a fisherman not a detailer.

Do you worry about how much your wife spends on make-up, hair dresser, clothes to look nice so you are proud of her? Be proud in your boat, doesn't matter if it's a $70k boat or a $800 used boat."
6217002,goldman,2018-07-03 19:51:00,1036,Do Ranger boats leave puddles and ride in the back of pickup trucks?
6217080,Juls,2018-07-04 01:27:00,13414,"And, many years later, the LUND Glass boats are now sparkly too....lol"
6217380,Baseline,2018-07-04 17:11:00,3207,"Yeah, they ruined a good thing."
6218196,Anonymouse,2018-07-07 03:22:00,834,"Pffft, boat dealers ain't fishermen anyway.Some of my best Walleye fishin' was done with 1.5"" sparkle tube jigs tipped with a fathead minnow.Walleyes really do go for the flashy stuff."
6219624,Blackmacs,2018-07-10 11:33:00,2121,How do you know the guys didn't launch their boats after you had headed out in the morning and loaded up before you got back?
6219638,Carnhzkr,2018-07-10 11:55:00,964,"I'm sure that's what they did, but that would make for an uninteresting story. As I said, it was written tongue-in-cheek. I'm sure they used their boats at some point during the week."
6219642,Mojo-NC,2018-07-10 12:02:00,1929,"Unfortunately, Ranger has their fair share of ""those guys"", and I try not to be one of them. I'm referring to the arrogant, strutter types. Aside from that, Ranger makes really nice, high quality, and well equipped boats (I'm currently on my second and probably last new Ranger). I will say the workmanship is second to none, and I get a lot of compliments on how nice it looks (except from the Triton, Nitro, Stratos, Skeeter, etc. owners). My current boat runs like a scalded dog when I want it to and is extremely reliable. Over my 16 years of being a Ranger owner, I've only had two occasions where I needed to take one of my boats in to the dealership for anything other than routine maintenance. One was a faulty solenoid on the trim/tilt of my outboard after about 8 years of use, where the motor would sporadically lower but not raise back up. The other was a loose wire connection for my fishfinders they fixed it for free. I will say that I've noticed that the ""Ranger haters"" seem to only be those who own different brands. Just sayin..."
6216714,Carnhzkr,2018-07-03 10:04:00,964,"I'm going to make a very broad sweeping generalization that I'm sure is completely unfair and inaccurate. All Ranger boat owners care only about appearance. This statement is based solely on my observations at a Lac Seul fishing lodge last week. Keep in mind, this is being written by someone that could never afford to depart with that kind of money for a pleasure craft, so I'm sure there's more than a touch of jealousy influencing my opinion. I arrived at our lodge at 2:00 on Saturday and noticed two beautiful Rangers, a 620 and 621, parked in front of one of the cabins. They were immaculate and looked like they had been pulled up directly from the showroom floor. My routine when I arrive is to unload our gear as quickly as possible, launch my boat and start fishing by 3:00. When I returned to the dock with dinner in the cooler, the two shiny Rangers were still both as dry as my wife's corn muffins, sitting in front of the cabin. I don't fish hard. I'm usually on the water by about 7:30 and back to the dock by 5:00ish. When I returned after fishing on Sunday, the rangers were still on their trailers and I began to wonder why someone would haul those beautiful boats up to LS and not put them in the water. When I returned after Monday's fishing, I saw both boats were now wet and moored at the dock. For the next three days, I never saw either boat leave the dock, except for Thursday evening when they were both back on their trailers because the owners were leaving a day early, likely due to the rain predicted to hit on Friday. It was easy to tell who the boats belonged to, as this particular camp holds a mid-week hamburger feed for its customers and there were two guys wearing Ranger jackets, Ranger caps, and Ranger shirts at the event. I hope I didn't offend anyone. This is completely tongue-in-cheek. I just found it odd that someone would pull those $70k - $80k rigs to Canada and they get used less than John Goodman's treadmill."
6216740,stjoeguy,2018-07-03 10:37:00,979,"Hey, I got a kick out of your question, but then I'm not a Ranger owner. I especially appreciated the wife's corn muffin and Jon Goodman treadmill comments. Good luck with the upcoming Ranger fan retorts."
6216744,Farmerj,2018-07-03 10:42:00,375,Having just fished out of a ranger 620 for a week in Canada.And then helped the owner clean it....I bought a crestliner instead.
6216768,Bergy,2018-07-03 11:23:00,83,I own a Ranger and I think you are spot on about keeping them clean. We bought our boat to use and that is what we do. We also like to keep it up and looking good. I agree that is makes no sense to buy one and leave it on the trailer!
6216794,Lake Wisconsin,2018-07-03 12:16:00,1960,"A good friend of mine has a 620. He has the all the gear, but never talks about his boat like it is the next coming. However, my friends who have the yar-craft and the Nitro both do. The one with the Nitro, that is all he wears - even to weddings. Personally, I think it is sad. Sure your boat might be very good, but to think it is the best, that it something that will never come out of my mouth"
6216804,David Anderson,2018-07-03 12:35:00,2073,"Interesting comments. I own a Ranger 2015 620FS and was at a Lac Seul Lodge 2 weeks ago. I am super fussy with my boat, actually with every boat I have owned. It is quite sandy before you get to the docks and I make everyone clean wash their shoes off or they can simply get a rental if they don't like it. The owner smiles at the guys with Rangers that come in, he has some choice words for them. If there is no dock space one has to beach it. I had a space on the dock along with a 621. One afternoon we came in and there was a Lund in ""his"" space, he was where I was parked. I ordered a Hamby for my keel just for these moments and pulled up on the beach and secured it. He had a guy standing on the dock, looked at me and said that he is going to get the Lund out of his spot and I can have my old spot back. Stating I am fine here, didn't matter and in 5 minutes they had the aluminum boat out of his spot and the 621 where ""he"" belonged and the camp guy asked me if I would go back to my spot to not cause any confusion. Yes, I'd much rather be on a dock with the bumpers but I was ok with the beach as we had to do that on opener. When you pay $70K+ for a boat most people like to take care of them. I am absolutely anal about it and even make the guys clean up the walleye jezz in the spring off my gunnels. I realize boats can be washed/waxed/vacuumed later but again what would you say if you saw a Ranger guy completely trashed his nice new Ranger boat..........you'd say I couldn't afford one but if I did I'd take care of it better than that guy! And we all get a clothing gift card to dress the part when you buy one....smart on their part. When I traded my 2008 620T it was March and the dealer asked what I wanted for my boat, We negotiated without even looking at it as he knew how well I take care of my boats. He probably had it sold already....hey I got a 620T coming in and it's immaculate. I am 63 now and I have learned at Lac Seul one doesn't have to get up at 6 to be on the water by 7, and fish all day. If I'm in the boat by 10:00 and back by 5:00, I've caught plenty of fish, I guess the guy who leaves at 8 and is back by 8 probably thinks the same thing as me, as a Ranger owner...nice boat and it just sits there! I fit the stereotype somewhat and often get lumped in with some of these guys who think just because they have a Ranger, they are special and deserve special treatment. Mine does get used for sure, but as I always say if your not catching fish at least you look good!"
6216808,Farmerj,2018-07-03 12:46:00,375,"I couldn't stomach the same price for a 15 year old boat what I paid for a brand new one off the floor. I get the same sentiment for my semi truck as well. Oh, you drive a Freightliner. You must not be a real trucker if you can't afford a peterbilt. We all have our reasons for using what we have. I kept comparing everything to the crestliner fish hawk. Guess what I finally bought. Even after fishing a ranger, alumacraft, Lund and another crestliner fish hawk that I really didn't like the layout of."
6216838,DaBirdman,2018-07-03 14:03:00,164,"I've got to resist commenting on this topic too much or I'll get myself in trouble. With that being said, if I lived in the northern half of MN and fished big water a lot, I'd definitely want a Ranger 620/621 or Lund 208. Mostly to handle the big water. But I wouldn't pimp it out with all the stuff people think they need to catch a fish. Just give me a Terrova with spotlock and a 7"" color graph/GPS unit and I'm good to go. I'm good with what I got though, and it gets used every opportunity I have."
6216868,Ricky Spanish,2018-07-03 15:06:00,1298,"Well, I haven't seen any Rangers broken down at the boat ramp, but I do see Harley's on the shoulder every couple hundred miles, my answer is no."
6216878,Baseline,2018-07-03 15:28:00,3207,"A long time ago a Lund salesman told me "" you don't need those pretty sparkles to catch a walleye""."
