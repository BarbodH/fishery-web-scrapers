Clarks is a family run business that is better organzed and run than any other outfit I've flown with. We arrived at their Northern Lights Resort on Cedar lake (which is also their floatplane base) a little early for our flight. We got weighed and checked in very quickly, and we even got to fly a little early although they do keep a tight schedule. We do bring a tiny bit more beer than most, we are a little larger people than average, and because we flew in a smaller plane, some of the heavier stuff (beer) stayed on the dock. Got to Una to find a nice cabin, new 4 stroke Yamaha motors and nice boat seats on the boats, giant Honda generator, electric refridgerator, microwave, big clean fish cleaning house, and a great firepit. Una also has the only flush toilet i've ever seen at a fly in cabin. We got unpacked, and another plane showed up before we could get off the dock to drop off the rest of the beer, a couple bags of ice, and minnows. We did not expect this until mid week, but the Clark's have alot of planes in the air all week and are super organized, so the service is better than I'm used to. Now, to the fishing, we took minnows and slowly set off to explore Una. Slowly was the way we traveled because this is by far the rockiest lake I've ever fished. We set off to the marked spots on the map in a pretty good wind. Slow start with jig/minnow mostly because of difficult boat control in the breeze. There are abundant islands in Una, so we decided to give up on fighting the wind and cast a little in sheltered spots. Caught a few walleye and a few small pike, but still struggling. I prefer to troll, and despite being told to catch your fish on minnows before you do anything else, we decided to troll. Trolling was better than jigging or casting, and we finished with a pretty good day of walleye fishing. The next day we wanted to explore the somewhat small lake and with all the rock hazards decided to troll/cast as we went. Started a little slow but we found shallow small rocks to hold big numbers of walleye. This pattern held the whole week. We caught all the 15-18"" walleye we wanted. Very shallow water, 2-4' and softball sized rock was where we watched walleye take the baits. They were invisible with dark backs in shallow water, but when they turn, the gold of their side would flash in the sun. Very fun for me with 15-20' line out and barbless hooks. (We took all but one hook off of our crankbaits and crimped the barbs.) Biggest for the trip was just over 20"", but the numbers of good fish were great. The whole time I thought how easy it was, and if we didn't goof around so much and kept count, we could have had better numbers but less fun. We did not use the portage lake for pike or smallmouth although it was recommended to us. It was just too hard for us to leave such easy fishing for walleye. We did fish for pike a little in Una with not very good results, but we were told the portage lake (Currie) was a much better pike lake. While we were there we saw 2 moose cows with calves, a bear, a fisher, and many eagles. They picked us up right on time and we ended our trip with a smooth flight back. Already booked next year and can't wait."

6219972,rockape,2018-07-11 07:37:00,215,"My group NEVER keeps count of how many fish we catch. It is all about having FUN! We have done the catch a walleye every cast thing. There are a thousand spots in NW Ontario where you can do that. We are in to finding new spots, trying new techniques, and using new baits to see there effectiveness. To us, that is what makes it a great trip. I'll catch enough walleye for dinner and then start trying new things. This year was a huge success with new baits for pike and big walleyes! Clark's do run a great operation. I stayed at the Cedar lake camp a few years ago. That Una lake sounds a bit scary with rock hazards though! Glad you crushed the fish! I like to fish muskies too, so the fly-in thing isn't an option as all of the lakes are north of the musky's range."
