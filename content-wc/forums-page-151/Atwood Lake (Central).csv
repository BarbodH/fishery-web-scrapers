Cheers"
6219328,beer slayer,2018-07-09 21:48:00,33,"I think Mike Borger is referring to me for a trip report. I have had numerous problems logging on here, finally got in. Be glad to provide info on attwood. Litterally got back from Hurst Lake today. Anywhere you fish on that river system you will not be dissapointed. And as most everyone knows the outfitter is excellent. send me a PM. I will answer any question"
5696322,Guest,2017-08-01 14:47:00,0,"Good afternoon, Was wondering what experiences everyone has had fishing Atwood Lake (Central) in the past. Numbers Lake? Any spots that can be recommended? Tips on fishing Lake Trout & Brookies. Thanks, Spunky"
5700762,BrianE,2017-08-03 22:48:00,98,"Spunky. our group was there several years ago (before Don & Annette purchased it), Is a good Walleye and pike lake and also caught a couple of Brookies in the river. Really don't know about Lake Trout but there could be a few after ice out but never heard of any being caught. Some gal though got a 65 pounder in Luella before our time at Atwood. The trip that we made then happened to be one of the worst Mosquito seasons in quite awhile, had to keep our headnets on whenever on shore. If you decide to go shoot me a pm and i will be glad to show you some spots that are good."
5705410,Guest,2017-08-07 06:50:00,0,"Hi Brian E, Thank you very much for responding to my post as a guest, I didn't think I would get many responses seeing I am not a member here on Walleye Central. I find it to be a great resource of information when looking for info. about fishing in Canada and any other info. for that matter. There is nothing that compares to a fly in vs. a drive in as the fishing is a lot better and its an adventure meeting a lot of interesting people on the way. We have been going to Mojikit Lake with Mattice and the Elliots for the last five years & really love the lake. They are great people that will always take care of you but we were looking for a change and that is when Don suggested Atwood Central. I am pretty computer literate but not sure what pm me means. Send me a note in the pm hours? Send me a personal message? Sorry to sound ignorant, I would be happy to give you any info. on Mojikit if you ever needed it. Thanks again, John AKA Spunky"
5705434,Guest,2017-08-07 06:56:00,0,"Hello again to everyone that can read this, I know part of the fun is figuring out a new lake and where the fish are but I thought it could give me a personal edge when competing against everyone in our tournament as I have lost the last couple of years and of course they don't let me forget about it so please chime in with info if you can. Thanks"
5705554,Mike Borger,2017-08-07 08:16:00,1554,"Sit tight, a buddy and fellow WC member is just returning from Attwood right now. I'm sure he'll chime in.Cheers"
5710018,Guest,2017-08-09 14:54:00,0,"Hello everyone, Sorry I asked this question, I guess I'm not in the Walleye Central club."
5710826,BrianE,2017-08-09 20:50:00,98,"John, Yes the Elliots do a good job, no complaints. We went to Mojikit several years ago and it was very good to us, may not go back soon as we like to try different lakes but great memories from that trip. Loved all that timber when you went left around the back side of the cabin."
5710954,Mike Borger,2017-08-09 21:48:00,1554,There's no club. The guy I referred to earlier is still there until Saturday I believe.
6218346,3M TA3,2018-07-07 15:31:00,2846,"Still looking for that friend to report, Mike."
6218416,Bill Krejca,2018-07-07 21:32:00,6107,"Re: Question on PM = private message, the ability to email someone through WC (Walleye Central). Should be a rectangular block, upper right of the forum, not sure if you have to be registered,it may not appear if not registered.. The PM only shows up to the 2 folks who sent and received it. The advantage (?) is that one does not have to give out their email address to correspond. Frankly, I prefer just using email, but some folks maybe prefer not to share theirs with WC Viewers. Bill"
