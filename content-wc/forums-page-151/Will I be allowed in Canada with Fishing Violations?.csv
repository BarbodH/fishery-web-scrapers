Long story short, I was fishing for salmon and hooked one underneath the mouth, I kept it, and the DNR came up and wrote me those 2 tickets. My privileges havent been revoked and Ive already bought a Canadian fishing license. Im just worried that I might not get let in at the border. Is this something I should worry about? Or will it be no big deal? Other than these 2 fines, I got a clean record. Thanks for your help."

Honest mistake by us and the MNR officers said they could see how this would happen but still needed to issue the $150 ticket. My buddy driving the boat was given the ticket and h paid at once with his credit card. New one for the officers. I asked if this violation would have our fishing licenses revoked for the next calendar year and they said no- similar in nature to a parking ticket. Expensive parking ticket! I think you'll be fine but it is a good idea to call the MNR for clarification. I would think that taking away your fishing privileges would involve a court hearing or a hearing.

6218882,Farmerj,2018-07-09 06:20:00,375,Some misdemeanors in the US will get you banned from Canada. IE driving under the influence is a misdemeanor in the US but it will bar you from entry.

Ziplock bags each had two fillets, but the skins in some packages were not the facing out. While I thought it was obvious that there was one one walleye in each of the 4 bags I had I was issued the ticket just the same. Cost was $125. That was 10 years ago and I've been across the border 30 to 40 more times and have never been asked about the the ticket."
