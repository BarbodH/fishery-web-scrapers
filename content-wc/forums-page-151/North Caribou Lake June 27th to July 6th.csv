This is my 2nd trip in a row to N Caribou, also went here in 2007. There were 5 of us this year. My sister who went last year was unable to go due to her boss not letting her off, she asked for time off in January, but he said no and he took the same time off for himself. Anyway I partnered with Gary who usually partners with phishfearme(Bob K),who partnered with his friend a newbie Vito. The weather was a bit cool ,with us having several days in the 50's and rain kept us off the lake several times for about a half day. Fishing was very good again with hundreds of walleyes each day. Biggest walleye was a number of 25's with largest pike being several 35's. The overwhelming bait was jig and tail. Yellow and white being the best color, although I used pink & blue a bit and had excellent results. For pike we casted & trolled various lures. We caught about a ratio of 5 to 1 of walleyes over pike while trolling silver minnows This year we ventured quite a ways from camp going into the southwest part of the lake a number of times. We have acquired a good bit of information on good fishing spots which will be of great value when we return next year On a personal note I got screwed royally by WestJet on my return flight home to Las Vegas. Originally I was to fly Thunder Bay to Winnipeg to Las Vegas arriving home around noon on sat 7th. WestJet changed my schedule ,made me fly Thunder Bay to Toronto to Vancouver to Las Vegas added 9 hours onto my trip I got home at 9pm. A Long Day Flying!! An Excellent trip which we are doing again next year around the same time My sister who missed this year is all hyped up and will be going next year Larry S"
