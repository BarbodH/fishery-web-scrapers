Looks like there might be construction in that area? Can they get there on Hwy. 11 or use side streets?Also, in a few weeks we head up to Sioux Lookout. Thinking about eating dinner at the Forest Inn. Anybody eaten there before? Good place, good food? Reservations required?"

We were looking forward to eating in the early afternoon and luckily the grocery store opened up around 9pm finally as everything closed for the night.Good luck Sent from my Pixel 2 XL using Tapatalk"

Of the few dining options in Sioux Lookout, I definitely prefer the Forest Inn over the second choice (Dick's). You might want to try Anderson Lodge (it is a few miles south of town on the highway), I have not eaten there, but have heard the food is pretty good, you might want to call to ask if reservations are needed, their number is 800-465-1098. If you do decide to eat there, please let us know how it was."

It’s a little fancier than Dick’s but we’ve never had a reservation on a Friday night. A reservation probably would be a good idea though. The last two years we’ve eaten at Dick’s and the food has been good. A little more casual. Both menus are available online."
6219252,DaBirdman,2018-07-09 18:22:00,164,"Thanks for the replies. I think we'll shoot for the Forest Inn. Nice menu, looks like a nice setting, prices are alright. Couldn't find any menu list for Anderson's. Hopefully my folks can get into the Harbourage in FF. I don't know where the construction zones are at, but I can't imagine there not being any access to the Harbourage."
