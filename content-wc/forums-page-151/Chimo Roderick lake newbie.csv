Looks a deep lake and fairly large lake for 10hp boats so wondering where best to start this time of year. Any tips on depths, baits would be warmly welcomed. Targeting walleye and hoping for a few trophy pike."
6219348,skimottaret,2018-07-10 01:17:00,40,Or any fishing reports from previous years? Be great to hear from anyone who has fished Roderick.
6219360,DavKin,2018-07-10 05:21:00,104,"Skim, Roderick will have a camp manager to help point out spots. I fished it years ago in early June. I recall others fished for lake trout neat Fire Island (?) which is near camp. The lake also has large northern and walleye. Another spot was ""the river"" at dusk for walleye with slip bobbers. Our group will be at Hornby in late August. Best of luck. Dave"
6219486,skimottaret,2018-07-10 08:09:00,40,"Thanks Dave, if the walleye fishing is good I am hoping to try for a laker so appreciate the spot tip for those. Good to hear that the camp manager will share a few spots, we are planning on bringing a locator so hopefully can dial in to a few areas early on.. A few big pike would be awesome."
6219502,rockape,2018-07-10 08:22:00,215,What are you fishing for? Any goals for what you want to catch during the trip? And I thought I traveled a long way to NW Ontario!
6219526,skimottaret,2018-07-10 09:00:00,40,"Primarily looking for action and numbers of walleye but if we do okay and get dialled in we would like to target trophy northern for a few hours each day and possibly try for a laker. My brother and I have fished Eagle seven or so weeks over the last 10 years and have done okay but found it tougher every year with more and more pressure. We typically catch about 80 eyes each on eagle using jigs and spinner rigs with minnows and if we could do better than that on Roderick I would be delighted. Not massively worried about big eyes as they seem to come along with the eaters but be awesome to get a few high 20's. Its our first fly in and thought Roderick would be a good ""soft start"" with the bigger lodge and hopefully a chance to compare notes with others in the camp. We haven't fished artificial bait much so a bit concerned about getting that right. All being well we would love to try an outpost lake another year but one step at a time !"
