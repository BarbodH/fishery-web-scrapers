6219472,phishfearme,2018-07-10 07:54:00,1242,just wanted to add that we bought ($110 on ebay) and used the 4 liter platypus water filter system on our recent fly-in trip and give it an enthusiastic thumbs up. I was going to add to the following thread but thought a new one is called for. phishhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...light=platypus
6219538,pnnylfr,2018-07-10 09:09:00,114,"phish, thanks for the review. We use a Berkey set up which works well but can be cumbersome for a fly-in. Have been looking at the platypus filter as a replacement. How fast/volume does it actually filter?"
6219618,kzoofisher,2018-07-10 11:29:00,5144,With a new filter mine fills in less than 5 minutes. How long it lasts depends on the quality of water you're filtering. We had slightly tannic hand pump water at our camp and had to get a new filter after three years. That's three weeks filtering water for five guys. It definitely slowed down the last year. Backwasing while in camp and with clean water at home helps.

Water tastes fine too. Ran it for 2 weeks, probably about 50 gallons of water, and nobody got sick. Will run again in Aug/Sept and am expecting similar results."
6219662,phishfearme,2018-07-10 12:31:00,1242,"like 3M mentioned, we would get about a liter a minute - BUT, to be sure, it will slow down with use and the filter rate will get much lower if the ""dirty"" water is full of little animals and other suspended debris. we did two back flushes for our 9 day trip and these sped things up considerably. this is soooooooo much better than units we've tried in the past - and tons better than boiling water. phish"
6219772,pnnylfr,2018-07-10 16:22:00,114,One more question. How clear is the water before and after filtering?
6219782,btyreprich,2018-07-10 16:42:00,1067,"We’ve been going up to Canada since 1977. In all of those years we have just used water out of the kitchen faucet. Never had an issue. Not saying that using a water filter isn’t needed - I understand the desire to drink safe water.. I am the only one in our group that drinks coffee in the morning and the rest of the time water is used for cooking, washing dishes, and showers.We fish out of a nice lodge on Lac Seul near Ear Falls. Will have to ask the owner how they treat their water.Is this filter something I should get for our group?"
6219820,kzoofisher,2018-07-10 18:33:00,5144,"Quite clear after filtering, some local flavor remains. If you want to get rid of that get the carbon after filter. Pretty cheap iirc."
6219832,phishfearme,2018-07-10 18:58:00,1242,"at north caribou, the water is pumped from the lake out away from the shore so it is fairly clear of shore line suspended stuff. it is clearly clearer after filtering though. in the past we have also drank the water directly from the lake - with mixed results. having GI problems for 3-4 days will ruin you trip - simply not worth it. this filter is worth it's weight in gold as far as I'm concerned. phish"
6219856,andreindy,2018-07-10 20:01:00,308,"We purchased this filter based on reviews and recommendations from this message board. Will be using it in just a few days. Risk for Giardia varies, just as the gut flora of each of us varies to some degree. Of our group, my Dad was ""stricken"" with Giardia after our trip last year. I told him that is nature's way of trying to thin the herd. He obviously lived....but was miserable for a time."
