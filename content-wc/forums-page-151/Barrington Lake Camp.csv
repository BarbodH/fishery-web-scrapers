Our group of 5 had a 27"", 27 3/4"" and a 28.5"" as the 3 biggest in 4 days of fishing. We have had better fishing on lac Seul, but the numbers we caught were good for exploring a new lake. Accommodations were fine. We were promised a flight out on Monday morning at 6:00 AM weather permitting. It was a beautiful morning and we were on the dock and ready at 5:50. The first plane arrived at 8:45. We can't fault the fly in service as that was the time another group was coming in, even though our camp owner said they were late. He knew all along that we weren't getting out of there until 9:00 oclock. I wish I would have not fully paid him the night before until I knew our flight was coming on time.I had it confirmed with him on 3 occasions before we arrived. It wouldn't have been a big deal, but we had things to get back for and that is why I made him promise an early flight. I don't want to bash the place as everything else was good, but I won't be going back as being lied to left a bad taste in my mouth."

It appears that he's getting good traffic into his camp, which is great because I know he was really cutting his rates early on to get people in. That said, transparency is key - he lost the ability to have a group come back for a lifetime - which is very unfortunate for you and him."
