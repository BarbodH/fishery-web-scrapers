I am looking to see if anyone has been to knee lake in Manitoba - going in August and just got a contour map - it looks to be pretty shallow for a big lake - Has anyone been there and knows - Also I am wondering if it is a clear water lake or more of a stained color lake - trying to plan lure colors - any help would be great - Thanks!!

I expect you will get a Master Anger pike (38"" i think). From what I remember, we through a lot of spoons (Dr spoons?) although when they were active the snot rockets seemed to hit anything. Would love to hear the report on how you did, and to read any other input more recent than mine. Have fun!"

We jigged for walleye and I don't remember overly shallow (15-25 feet jigging). Have fun!"
