6219698,DaBirdman,2018-07-10 13:59:00,164,"So I'm foggy on this.... the border patrol is going to want to know every little item that I'm bringing across the border including pens, my 20yr old deck of playing cards, my 10yr old pillow, my 15yr old blanket, etc, etc, etc? And then I'll have to pay a 10% tax on stuff that old?I'm confused...these taxes should only apply to items bought in stores in Canada, and not what we bring across in our totes & coolers?"
6219896,martinbns,2018-07-10 22:04:00,1520,I can't imagine Canada Customs tearing your car apart to find something to charge a Tariff on. You aren't selling any of the stuff in Canada.

6219916,Shellback,2018-07-11 04:40:00,8083,I heard Gord was going to start charging in US $! LOL!
6219956,milfish,2018-07-11 07:03:00,249,I would imagine that these tariffs don't apply to items that you will consume oe use while vacationing in Canada. I would think these apply to items imported into Canada for resale and manufacturing. Anyway I sure hope not.
