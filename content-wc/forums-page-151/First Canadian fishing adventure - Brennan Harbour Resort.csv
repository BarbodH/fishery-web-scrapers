6219480,Crayfish,2018-07-10 08:05:00,15,"My son and I just got back from our first Canadian fishing adventure. This was his high school graduation present. We went to Brennan Harbour Resort in Spanish, Ontario, which is on the Whalesback Channel of Lake Huron. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but at least we'd be fishing!The trip started off on Friday afternoon. We left home in Vermont around Noon and drove ~6hrs to Deep River, On. We fished the Ottawa River from shore that evening and both caught our first ever channel cats. Nothing huge, but they were fun on our light rods!Saturday morning we were back on the road, headed up through North Bay, Sudbury and finally to Spanish. The resort owner, James, got us checked in and out on the water as quickly as possible. I had contacted some people on WMC who had written reports in the past, so had some general ideas of places to try. We opted to go it on our own and not get a guide, figuring that half of the adventure was figuring out the water on our own with the info we had gotten from the generous people on here as our guide. That afternoon didn't amount to much. We caught a few smallmouths, but nothing to brag about.After dinner we headed back out and tried a different area. We were beating the banks and catching a few decent smallies when my son hooked into a good one. After a few jumps and a tense netting job by me, he had landed his new personal best smallie! 20.5"" long and probably 4.5lbs. What a beast!With our trip off to a great start, we decided to target some walleye. The first day we struggled to find any numbers. We managed to catch 6 walleye and a couple more bass. My son got some intel from fellow fisherman that evening that they were catching walleye in a particular bay once the wind had started to pick up. The next morning the wind was howling pretty good so I knew the fish would still be there. We setup with bottom bouncers in about 15' of water and drifted/trolled the wind-blown end of the bay, ending up in ~8' of water. The walleye were stacked in there, which really surprised me! I didn't expect to find them in 8' of water when the surface was ~80deg. We ended up catching 30 that morning and another 21 that afternoon! We didn't catch any big ones, but we didn't care. There were plenty of eaters to choose from and LOTS of fish.Once we figured out the pattern, we caught walleye every day ... even on the 90deg / flat calm days. We would move out to 15 - 20' feet on calm days and back in 8-12' on windy days. We would target bass and pike a few times, and usually were able to find some fish to keep us busy. But whenever the wind blew we knew right where we needed to be.By the end of the week we had caught over 200 walleye (209, actually), with 206 of those coming on bottom bouncers and worm harnesses. Plastics actually worked surprisingly well on the harnesses. When they were aggressive, we could switch to plastics and not have to worry about whether our worms were stolen or not. The biggest walleye was 21"", and we caught a lot of other slot fish in the 17-19"" range. We were able to pick and choose the keepers to try to maximize what we were taking home, looking for fish in the 15.5 to 15.75"" range to keep away from the 16"" max. We also caught over 60 bass with the biggest being my son's PB on the first day. We caught several in the 18-19"" range, as well. Also caught over 20 pike with the biggest being around 27"". I was hoping to find some bigger pike, but couldn't make it happen. We saw GIANTS every day jumping clear out of the water, but could never get them to bite. Also caught a bonus 26"" catfish on a worm harness. Thought I'd hooked into a record wally!All in all we had fantastic trip. The hosts were great, the food was great, the fishing was great. Couldn't have asked for more."

6219506,gordy28,2018-07-10 08:25:00,437,Glad to see you had a great trip! We really enjoyed Brennan Harbour Hope some of the intel was useful but either way looks like you guys had a blast which is aweome Cheers Gordy
6219556,vteye3,2018-07-10 09:22:00,496,Congrats - glad you and perch bait had a great trip. Nice smallie and lots of walleye action make for unforgettable trip.
6219566,Crayfish,2018-07-10 09:58:00,15,"Thanks everyone! Gordy ... I really appreciated your help. While we never made it the spots you mentioned, just knowing what to look for helped us out a lot. We found one rock pile in Aird Bay that we caught 12 bass off from! I couldn't believe they just kept biting. That's where I caught the 1 eye'd bass in the attached photos.Now to figure out what we're going to do next year!!"
6219574,Crayfish,2018-07-10 10:03:00,15,"Thanks, Charlie! We had a blast. Really couldn't believe how many walleye we caught. Going into the last day we were at 149 walleyes. Jacob (perch bait) said, ""Let's see if we can get to 200"". I thought that was a bit of a reach, but we made it ... and then some."
6219582,Richard B,2018-07-10 10:06:00,735,Sounds like you had a great trip sir. Congratulations!
