6217812,hoppy63,2018-07-05 19:05:00,367,"Returned Saturday from Kayedon with Leuenberger. In a nutshell here it is....as was stated bugs were unbelievable in Nakina. I thought it was surely gonna be a rough trip for some in our group but fortunately much to our surprise, the bugs did not seem as bad at camp as they were in nakina. Also had some breezy conditions that helped knock them down. Going through the wooden area to boats and back was a different story though, as one would expect. Enough with the bugs. We had 1 moose sighting on drive up and 3 while at camp, plus a woodland caribou showed twice across bay from cabin. Most I've seen in my few trips to Canada. The fishing was good, I would not say great, but plenty of fish, no complaints. The average walleye are pretty good....lots of 20-21's but I think 23 was biggest. Again no complaints. We jig 98% of time....or more so don't really work on pike much. I did catch two very nice home models right at the limit (lower) of slot, being 27-27-1/2"" and nice thick fish. This is a personal preference, but our group prefers to get on Ogoki when wins allows. The pros- cabin adequate, nice big eating/living area. Also two sets of doors going into cabin, so helps keep Skeeter's out. Nice large washer room with sink and shower. The crew was very friendly and were there a couple of times during week, as they had to repair dock from winter damage. The cons- 1 refrigerator/freezer and no chest freezer at camp. Was tight for our group of 6, who like to take a meal home. Plus fridge did not work well at all. We lost a bag of fish that we planned on having for dinner. There are cupboards but no kind of shelving for storming your provisions. Same in bedrooms, no shelving. Not really issue for our group of 6 as we could use spare bunks, but any more people would make it harder. Boats/motors kind of rough for so early in year. Ours leaked pretty bad. Was more like I would expect for portable boats. Motors started, usually right away, but if it did die you really had to tweak choke to get it fired back up. It is a pretty long hike on rough ground for older guys hauling gear in and out, but not a deal breaker. What I think could be deal breaker for some is the boats have no seats, (as is advertised) which is rough on older Guy's backs, which I'm sure is the biggest % of customers. All in all.good trip....with good buddies fishing in Canada. Now biggest task is to figure out where we head next year and wait it out!"

6218056,hoppy63,2018-07-06 12:38:00,367,Yes...we go out of red lake as well
6219454,gordy28,2018-07-10 07:20:00,437,Thanks for the report! My group is staying at Ogoki Lake Outfitters the last week of August (cabin is in the north east corner of the lake) Any tips or tricks for Ogoki appreciated! Cheers Gordy
6219646,hoppy63,2018-07-10 12:04:00,367,"We come from Kayedon and head straight out into ogoki just passed the first island (maybe 1-1/2 miles) to the north side there are a couple rocks/reefs. Always do good and have not ventured from there. This year I tried to find where the river flows into ogoki but I could not. Spoke to a group staying there that looked for it for a few hours and could not find it, but the group ahead of them tore them up there, as you would expect. Also the mouth heading into Kayedon from ogoki will be good. That's a start. I would see if you can't find someone with GPS numbers for the mouth of the ogoki, if you want to save some time. You can PM if you want any other info."
