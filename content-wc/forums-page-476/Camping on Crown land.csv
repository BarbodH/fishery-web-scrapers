1330271,Sutsgold,2011-07-15 15:23:00,219,"Skywagon, I head on up in a week for 3 weeks on Eagle with the family so I am not sure of what is going on right now on Eagle. Hoping to musky fish every morning and possibly do some camping up near lac seul."
1330379,Skywagon,2011-07-16 04:59:00,1106,"I do know around Lac Seul that non-residents can not camp, it is restricted to residents only, you have to be a Canadian resident (even though you are a land owner). I took house guests (from downstate of you), to Deception Bay yesterday and we will probably run up to the Scout Bay side tomorrow. Fishing was good. It looks like we will be getting a little taste of the heat you have been experiencing this coming week, though not to that degree."
