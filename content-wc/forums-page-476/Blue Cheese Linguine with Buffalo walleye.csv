1330049,Moondog,2011-07-14 21:29:00,362,Been known to poach or nuke some northern since I don't seem to be able to get the bones out no matter how many times someone shows me and then pull it apart in chunks.....removing the bones and make sewer trout cakes. Just use a crab cake recipe and fry them up. Terrific!!!
1329707,NathanH,2011-07-14 07:39:00,697,I know this is slightly off topic but somone mentioned the above Recipe during a thread that has now been closed that was in this Canada Section. I am hoping that the person who posted that would be willing to share this Recipe as it sounds amazing!
1329744,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-14 08:40:00,1460,"2nd only to my chowder on a cold day. Of course pasta dishes are great for fly-in trips. Real easy on the camp chef(me) as well.You can make a roux if you wish or 3T butter melt, about pint of heavy cream or half/half. Melt your Blue cheese and thicken. Mix with 2 boxes of linguine. Buffalo Walleye: Fry your fish to your liking. On Stove melt some butter, add Franks Hot Sauce for Buffalo sauce. Dip fried walleye in sauce and put on top of your plate of linguine. I also like to hit my plate with tobassco.The contrast of the Bleu Cheese and hotness of the walleye really works. Beware, you may have to take a short nap before braving the afternoon bite."
1329751,JETSTER,2011-07-14 08:59:00,448,That sounds good!!!!!
1329764,Juls,2011-07-14 09:26:00,13414,Oh My Gosh...that sounds good! I'll have to remember that one for my next fish fry. Thanks for the recipe! Juls
1329887,joeman79,2011-07-14 13:35:00,417,"Sounds awesome. I do one that has become our group favorite and that is blackened Walleye and Fettuccine Alfredo. I cheat and use bottled Alfredo, way faster and better than I make anyways. Buy a small can of Zatarans Blackening seasoning/ Dip fish in melted butter- sprinkle a bunch of spice on it and put in HOT skillet a couple minutes per side. Serve over to pasta and sauce. How much Bleu Cheese would a guy need to feed 12 Men? approx."
1329923,Paul M,2011-07-14 15:00:00,4,"Wow, the Buffalo Walleye over blue cheese alfredo sounds wonderful!!! I've got 18 meals that I'm planning for our trip and this one will now be put into the mix. Thanks for the great Recipe idea. One of our favorites is Famous Daves Sunfish Shore lunch. It's a little putzy but always a camp favorite. Thanks againg and looking forward to eating the ""lobster of the north"" all week long. Cheers, Paul"
1329938,@Lunker,2011-07-14 15:50:00,835,"On my recent trip north of the border, saw some people doing this for their fish fry.......roll the raw filets in hot sauce, dredge in breading, and then fry. Wow......added a nice tangy taste."
1329945,Hawkfan,2011-07-14 16:10:00,237,"One of our yearly meals has also been a cajun alfredo pasta, but we add a cajun sauce to the alfredo sauce n just cook the walleye (not breaded) in it. Add some shrimp and scallops too. Mmmmmmm. This sounds like a good way to change it up. What kind of blue cheese do you put in?"
1329946,Hawkfan,2011-07-14 16:12:00,237,"Oh and I'm pretty sure if we had that for lunch, our day would be over. Lol. Dinner time only!"
1329971,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-14 17:22:00,1460,"You can use about any Bleu, it's melted anyway so I wouldn't use Maytag. You could even cut it with gorgonzola if you wanted.If you don't have any walleye left, practice at home using giant prawns.Key is don't scimp on da bleu.Go Hawks"
