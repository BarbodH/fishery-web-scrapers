1329852,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-14 12:03:00,429,Thanks for the info! Looks like a nice place and we plan to give it a try! RBF
1329868,MrWalleye73,2011-07-14 12:49:00,821,"Good info....that Rendezvous place is always busy when we drive by. Robin's Donuts is good, if you're into a quick bite and coffee, but parking is a PAIN with a trailer! Lee Garden downtown isn't bad either (Chinese mostly, and they had a lunch buffet at the time). Not much else going east down 11 after town. In fact, I can't think of anything!"
1330112,GNO,2011-07-15 07:11:00,153,"Both of the Robins doughnuts have been closed for several years now, There is a Tim Horton's on the West side of town."
1330137,Blackmacs,2011-07-15 08:20:00,2121,Since you're only an hour and a half away from the border I'd just eat something quick before I left and stop at the Chocolate Moose in I Falls for a bigger breakfast or maybe lunch depending on your timing. I understand wanting to get the border crossing over and done though.
1330166,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-15 09:50:00,429,"Yeah, our goal is to get across the border then eat. Last year we had a 2 1/2 hour wait to cross the border. We got there at 9am last year. This year we plan to be on the road even earlier. If we get across quickly, then we will eat in Dryden. Option of crossing Friday night won't work since the rest of our party is coming from Central Wisc. and St. Paul and won't arrive until late Friday night."
1330221,MrWalleye73,2011-07-15 12:19:00,821,"Hadn't stopped in Robins for years, and never really paid attention. Always grab coffee and whatever from the AmericInn early in the morning now. We usually take a different road somewhat around town and hook back up with 11 when it makes it's bend. Well, good to know."
1329389,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-13 13:10:00,429,Looking for a good restaurant in Fort Frances for Breakfast & lunch heading EAST out of town ? Also location? Thanks!
1329396,Aaron-IN,2011-07-13 13:28:00,500,"Can't go wrong with McDonalds. The pancakes and egg mcmuffin are to die for, can't beat the coffee for the price."
1329398,Stu,2011-07-13 13:34:00,472,We always stop at the Harbourage. It's across the parking lot from Rainy Lake Sports. Take Highway 11 east thru town unitl it turns left along the lake and it's on the corner of 3rd St. They open pretty early.
1329401,teddi,2011-07-13 13:38:00,349,heading east not west.
1329452,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-13 16:06:00,1460,"The Rondevoux is the best in town. Harborage is good as well. Harborage is mainly sandwiches and breakfast. Rondevoux has steaks, pasta more high end. It really was better back a few years ago when John Mark was managing the restaurant. There is also a Bosto Pizza joint on the west end of town. I was amazed at the lack of American fisherman I was there 6/4 and 6/5 and spent an extra day at Ft. Francis(on purpose) and even went to church.Anybody remember the old Hotel"
1329474,Golden Eagle,2011-07-13 17:13:00,2642,"My ice chest covers us for a 1490 mile one way ride. Fruit, sandwiches, pretzels.................."
1329592,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-13 21:29:00,429,Where is the Rondevoux located? Thanks!
1329593,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-13 21:31:00,429,"We have stopped here several times.....it is OK, easy location nice view of Rainy Lake and then buy our fishing licenses at the Sport shop.....just looking for a different place to stop. Thanks for your input!"
1329595,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-13 21:32:00,429,"Good idea with packing food for the trip, but we like to take a break on the way up to stretch our legs.....check in at the resort is 3:00pm otherwise we would get there too early."
1329605,Hawkfan,2011-07-13 22:08:00,237,"We stayed at the Rendezvous for the first time last year. We didn't get anything fancy, but it met our needs just fine. Breakfast was good homestyle food. This was the first time we didn't just hit the A&W as we passed through town so I don't have a whole lot to compare it to, but I would go back. If you are heading east, you'll go right by it.www.rendezvoushotel.com"
