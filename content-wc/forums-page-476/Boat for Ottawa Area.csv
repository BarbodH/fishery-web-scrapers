I'm a little torn as to what to get into and I was hoping that you could help me out with some general info on the type of water that is usually frequented in this area and the various considerations as a result of that.Back in BC it would have been a no brainer to go aluminum given the lack of mooring/dockage facilities, trailering on gravel roads, etc. Out here I really don't know what to expect but I see WAY more fibreglass boats than I did in BC which leads me to conclude that the boating conditions may not be as harsh (when it comes to hull damage from the various things you could run into . . . not weather related issues).I suspect the bulk of my boating will be within a couple hours of Ottawa and will likely include a fair amount of time on the St. Lawrence down by the 1000 Islands, the Ottawa River, the Rideau system and even Lake Ontario when the weather cooperates. I'd also like to explore some spots in Northern Ontario, Vermont, New York and Quebec with time.I'm also torn between a smaller Whaler (always loved them) and a more classic walleye style hull like a Lund Rebel or Explorer. I know these are two different designs and I can appreciate the pros and cons of each. My main concern right now is trying to decide if I would regret going fibreglass given the primary conditions out here for boating. Anyone gone through this same dilemma for this particular area and if so, what has your experience told you? Thanks in advance for any info you can share!"
