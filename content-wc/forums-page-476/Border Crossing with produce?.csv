1329353,Guest,2011-07-13 12:07:00,0,On our trips this year we have never been asked about fruits etc by the Canadians but have always been asked about the same by the Americans. Last year we had to wait for the Americans to approve our bunch of green grapes that we brought back. I would not try and take anything fresh southbound across the border.

1329448,jrems,2011-07-13 15:49:00,17,"was told a year ago at US Customs coming back into US, if it isn't canned and you did'nt eat it, leave it there! They were having a fit over 3 oranges in a mixed fruit bag from Cub. It said Cub foods, apples were marked from Washington State, nothing on the oranges, so the biys in blue had oranges for lunch. I was pulled aside in Int Falls for a USDA Inspection, which was random.Actually it took about 10 minutes and we laughed about it all the way back. This was in March and they were worried about Florida diseases in Int Falls"
