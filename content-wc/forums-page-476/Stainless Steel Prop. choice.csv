1328889,Avro Aero,2011-07-12 15:09:00,4,"I presently have a 1850 Lund TYEE w/175 hp, 2001 OB Johnson motor. I would like to change it to a SS prop. as it has an aluminium prop right now. I'm running at 5500 rpm and getting approx. 42-44 mph it feels like it wants to give me more but it sounds like it's slipping. I do have prop burn so I think it could possibly be the hub but not sure. I would like to be more educated in my choice as it is an expensive decision on my part. The part for the prop on my motor is #763468-14.5X19 is this the right prop for this motor I purchased the boat and motor used so I don't know. Would someone please give me some SOLID advice I would really appreciate if someone could educate me and not lead me down the creek if you know what I mean."

Most of our guests who have them change to aluminum when they arrive. We certainly suggest it. If you don't and you hit a rock - ouch. The aluminum prop will take the beating. The SS prop will come through fine but you'll need a new lower unit
1330076,walleye1952,2011-07-15 00:34:00,13,"The proper prop for your boat, whether aluminum or SS is when the engine reaches max RPM recommended by the manufacture... when the engine is properly trimmed up, with the normal load (weight) you carry in your boat, properly distributed. The prop for this type of boat should be a 3 bladed CUPPED prop. I have a 1950 TYEE with a Johnson OB and this is pretty similar to mine... 19 inch pitch. If your prop is worn & slipping on the hub, you will hear your motor rev up or get cavitation. SS props are generally more efficient as they do not flex like a aluminum prop does, and therefore your speed is better as is fuel economy.....though it may be difficult to notice.If you hit your aluminum prop on rocks, it will shear the blades, and perhaps spin on the hub....as that is what it is supposed to do. SS prop will spin on the hub on impact, and may or may not do as much damage to the prop as alum....however, damage to a ss is more expensive to fix....I am not convinced that you will ruin the gear box if a ss prop hits a rock...as I have done it more than once with no damage. However, if you hit the gear box dead on the rocks, you most likely will ruin it whether it is a alum or ss prop.I have spent many years (40+) on the rock infested Lac Suel, and Lake of the Woods, and as long as i pay attention, running a ss is not a problem, I do it all the time.Good Luck!!"
