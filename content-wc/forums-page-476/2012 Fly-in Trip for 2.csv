1329470,eyemike,2011-07-13 17:05:00,233,"Sportsmans lodge on Little Vermillion Lake Is a great place for a husband and wife trip. lots of walleye and as stated by Golden Eagle, the pike get really big. The lake is a good size lake that is shallow,stained with lots of islands and inflowing streams. The owners are great people. also.http://trophypikecanada.com/"
1329555,Golden Eagle,2011-07-13 20:15:00,2642,"Eyemike, I hit LV 15 days in May and expect to return at least one time and maybe twice yet this season. Let me know when you'll be there. Maybe we've been in camp together in past years. Could you perhaps be Mike E.? and maybe there in June with Girlfriend & Dad.Taking my wife to LOTW first week of August and she wants a trip to LV. Also I have a few others fishermen who want a September or October trip."
1329556,Golden Eagle,2011-07-13 20:17:00,2642,"Sorry eyeMike, just checked a previous post that explained your loss in 2005. Tough to lose your favorite fishing partner."
1329968,Guest,2011-07-14 17:21:00,0,"sioux lookout area - pickerel arm camps Wapesi River outpost has great walleye and northern fishing with direct access to Lac Suel as well. red lake area - I can second the motion for Loon Haunt Outposts and Poirier Lake,the cabin is perfect for couples and offers secluded fishing for trophy northerns and walleye in all sizes.A nice camp. red lake area - Viking Outposts - Night Hawk lake a chain of smaller lakes with abundent northern and walleyes headwaters of the nungesser system."
1330048,eyemike,2011-07-14 21:20:00,233,"Not a problem Golden Eagle. The memories I have fishing in Canada with my dad always bring a smile to my face. I have not been back to Sportsmans since my dad died. I am trying to talk my wife into going, so far have not been successful. I talked her into Eagle lake last year. We had a very good time there but, I still have to rate Little Vermillion in my top 2 favorite places. I keep p*ssing and moaning at my wife long enough I'll get her talked into heading up there. I am totally envious of you and the trips you have planned. Have a great time. Hopefully some day we may meet on LV, soon I would hope. Good fishing to you. Mike"
1330247,Golden Eagle,2011-07-15 13:50:00,2642,"Eyemike, I enjoy the others in camp at Sportsman's. Several of us exchange fishing information, mostly patterns rather than hot spots, and still don't bust into another guy's bay, reef or point. It's a good crowd."
1328247,Skyraptor,2011-07-11 06:45:00,291,Starting to plan a fly-in fishing trip for myself and my wife. We are looking at flying out of the Dryden/Sioux Lookout area and would like to go to a like that offers great walleye and northern fishing with a good cabin and boat. We are planning a 6-7 day trip next year and would like to get suggestions as to who to look at for our trip. We prefer to fly out of the Dryden/Sioux Lookout but are open to other areas around that area. Any suggestions would be appreciated. A lot of fly-ins do not take only 2 people. We would like to go from June thru mid-August.
1328270,Golden Eagle,2011-07-11 07:19:00,2642,"My favorite lake would put you on the road another 125 miles to fly from Red Lake. Little Vermilion Lake is a short flight north of Red Lake and holds tons of small to medium walleyes, with an occasional big eye. Little Vermilion is a top pike fishery, holding great numbers of big pike. You should have no problem booking only two people in late July or all of August and might slip into the week of your choice earlier in the season. Good luck. Enjoy your stay where ever you end up."
1328343,Ogoki,2011-07-11 10:21:00,291,Since you mentioned you are open to suggestions on other areas I thought I would add a reply. My wife and I fly-in with Mattice Lake Outfitters . We have used them since 1999 and are treated as if we are a large group. You pay just a dab more for two people but it is worth it. We drive 1125 miles one way to fish with them . Most years we go to Armstong twice as which is the case this year. Usually stay in for 8 or 9 days . I have even done double trips with them . Five days at one lake and five at another . Have used MLO on fly-in canoe trips also and I can say they are first class in all respects !!
1328360,phishfearme,2011-07-11 10:47:00,1242,consider otoskwin lake with north of 51 - the cabin is set up for 4 but they'll take 2. wonderful lake with two rivers coming in and one out - lots of flow and lots of walleye. phish
1328573,Guest,2011-07-11 20:18:00,0,"We have been using an outfitter out of Red Lake named Loon Haunt. The owners (Bill and Louise) offer a lake (Poirier) that they promote for two people. Our group has fished Cherrington and Unnamed Lake and have been very pleased with the fishing, accomodations and service. We have used Loon Haunt for 6 straight years. I have not fished Poirier Lake but other customers who post on his Bulletin Board have had good things to say about their experience."

Bob Huitikka and his daughter Kelsey run a great operation and have numerous lakes to pick from and their base is 2 miles north of Vermillion Bay which is just west of Dryden. The planes they have are awsome too.
