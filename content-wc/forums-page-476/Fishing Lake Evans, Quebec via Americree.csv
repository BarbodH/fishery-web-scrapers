Group of us headed back to Kirk Island camp the last week of July, and there has been next to NO traffic on the Bushland Adventures www forum. It would be really nice to hear what the water level is like, whether or not the weeds are up yet, what the bite has been, how the flights have gone, etc. If you've been up, please either respond here or go to the Forum to do the same. Much Appreciated!!"

1330065,5 of Diamonds,2011-07-14 22:33:00,151,"I just got back from 2 separate trips to Bushland Adventures (Americree). My first week was @ Kamwak from Fri 03 - Fri 10 Jun 11. We flew from kilometer 372 north of Matagami via Beaver into camp. Great trip. We really didn't have to fish hard to catch quality fish. Biggest Northern was 43"" and we caught 14 over 40"". Largest Walleye was 26"". This camp is my absolute favorite. Owner Jim usually only books it 4-5 weeks a year. I know he already has 2 bookings for 2012 (we're going in Fri 01 - Fri 08 Jun next year). The lake also has Lake Trout but we didn't pursue them. As usual, Lund SSV16's and Yamaha 20's (4 strokes) made for reliable fishing w/ plenty of durability and power.The 2nd trip was to Kirk Ile (group of 6) on Lac Evans. We flew from kilometer 237 north of Matagami via Beaver from Sat 25 Jun - Sat 02 Jul. We were delayed going in until Sun the 26th due to bad weather. Caught numerous Northern over 40"" w/ the biggest of the week being 44"". Too many 30""-39"" fish to count (50-70). We had a few dandy one's get away too. Walleye fishing was plentiful @ 1' falls. You could fish here 24/7 and catch Walleye. Stimpy produced trophy Pike fishing as fast and furious as I've ever seen it anywhere when the fish were there. The biggest fish we had on was only 100 yards from camp. We were prepared to land this Hoss but enough of the **** prop guard remained in the water to clip the braided line and rob our youngest fisherman of 12 years of what would have been that weeks money fish. This young man did enjoy a special moment later in the week when he caught and landed a Walleye on a double Buzzbait one evening. What a milestone. As usual, Lund SSV16's w/ the new Yamaha 20's (what a combination these two are).The water level was higher than normal @ both camps. The Eppinger 5 of Diamonds, Johnson Silver Minnow in silver & fire tiger and the simple white grub produced the most @ both camps. Owner Jim is in the process of having a total of 2 Beaver's servicing his camps. This new Beaver is faster and more fuel efficient but does not have quite the payload as a typical Beaver. Regardless, that 2nd Beaver is going to be sweet.Looking forward to hearing other updates from other groups who fish Lac Evans, Kamwak & Clarkie. Best."
1330071,5 of Diamonds,2011-07-14 22:50:00,151,"Gus28:Regarding Kirk Ile, the Lund boats and Yamaha motors performed flawlessly. Each boat has Humminbird's (I think 565's) already on them. They worked flawlessly too. I would have to say that the vegetation is behind about a week. We were able to run most lures w/ out too much interference. Fish the wall right @ camp, Stimpy and 1' Falls. We did see several Moose while we were there and our 2nd to last night there, Dominic (caretaker/guide) did see a Black Bear. To my knowledge, the camp was vacant of customers last week but Dominic was working on several upgrades. You'll be happy to know that when you get there you should have a new outhouse too (I remember him talking about building it then). The screened in porch on the cabin was nice and the fan in the cabin worked good too. I don't know what to tell you to bring as we pretty much had everything we needed. The fridge and freezer worked great. Running water. Hot shower. Everything pretty much met or exceeded our expectations. If I can think of anything else, I'll post for you and others to read. Best."
1301159,retire55,2011-04-30 11:21:00,1029,"Duffitdad Thank you for sharing your experience on Lake Evans. At which outpost camp did you stay? Are you returning to the same camp this year with your sons? HookNlines Apparently, once trips commenced being arranged through Bushland Adventures, flights into Lake Evans (using Beavers) originated from the hydro base at kilo 257 or the hydro base at kilo 381 in lieu of Matagami."
1301164,duffitdad,2011-04-30 11:26:00,21,"I guess its going to be close this year, assuming the ice does go out we should be in at a perfect time - crossing my fingers!"
1301188,duffitdad,2011-04-30 13:27:00,21,"hooknline - we stayed 2 years ago at the northernmost camp on the lake. This year we are supposed to be the first ones into the new camp on the southwest side of the lake, assuming the ice goes out. I dont care if there is three feet of snow, as long as i can get some open water . I just talked to Jim (the operator) and it sounds like he has made even more upgrades with motors, fishfinders in the boats, and such. Pray for warm weather!!!"
1301526,pike50plus,2011-05-01 10:22:00,584,"Fished Evans 3 times over a 20 year period with the origianl 3 owners and Jim only. If you fish crow later in the year water could be low in some section up in the NE area if water levels were low, But the lake is so Big there are plenty of areas to fish, just boat ride if you are at Crow. 2 years ago I have a pic of a 50+"" fish a 13 year old lost at the boat! The Guide!"
1306067,HookNlines,2011-05-12 10:47:00,7,"duffitdad: what was the name of the camp you stayed at? we too were looking last year at new camp but could nt get any info on it such as fishing around it and such. did some research from references and heard that there was no camp built last year due to problems. but maybe it was build after i talked to the group that told me that. so, did you see any pics or any thing of it? i think that june 5 will be safe for ice out, saw that it was in the 50's & 60's up there. did you ever fish around where the new camp is? you say southwest side, is that whre the lake goes into that other lake on thewest side called dana lake.?"
1306180,duffitdad,2011-05-12 17:12:00,21,"Hooknlines - hello sir!! 3 weeks to go, pray for warm weather!!! - about the new camp. you are correct it was not built last year. the new camp, which is going to be just north of the entrance to Dana Lake, should be being built as we speak. I have talked several times to Jim , the owner, and he thinks we will be ok weather wise. As I understand it he is actually going to be the caretaker for the new outpost and has offered to do a little guiding for my sons and I. I have only met him once but he seems like a very good guy and I trust him. I know he has fished evans quite a bit and should be just the guy to put us on some fish. this is my graduation present for my oldest son so I really hope this works out for us"
1306290,gapwedge,2011-05-12 22:12:00,19,"Hey, Duffit, congrats to your son on his graduation.I'm in the process of planning a trip with my son in celebration of his graduation.I hope you have a great trip that provides memories to last a lifetime."
1306344,HookNlines,2011-05-13 06:30:00,7,"thanks for the info, but what camp where you at 2 years ago? can not wait to hear update when you return, hopfully it will pursuade me to book next years. but i dont understand how a camp can be built right now up there.you said there was still ice on the lake, so how can you land a float plane!? hope it works out. keep us updated. wishing you the best."
1306790,duffitdad,2011-05-14 15:23:00,21,Hooknlines - I stayed at the kirk island camp 2 years ago. Just looked at the nasa satellite images and the lake is finally breaking up. hopefully we will be good to go for the opener!
1318161,HookNlines,2011-06-14 09:02:00,7,"duffitdad; how did it go? can you tell me about the new cabin please. how was the fishing around the camp, equipment, plane flights, etc, anything would be helpfull. i spoke to someone that had fished around Dana lake and said it was muddy most of time and was not productive. how did you find it? anyway, update on the new cabin would help us plan."
1298782,retire55,2011-04-24 15:01:00,1029,"Two weeks ago, I received an invitation to participate in a 2012 fishing trip to Lake Evans in north western Quebec. I recently started my due diligence on Americree Ltd, an outfitter on the lake. While the primary target is trophy northern pike (catch and release only), the secondary target is walleye to help provide sustenance during the week. While I have read past posts on this site, there appears to nothing on this site about Lake Evans nor Americree since 2009. I'm aware of the controversy between current principals and former principals associated with domain names. As well as sharing your experiences/recommendations with the lake, the fishing, the accommodations, the locations of the outpost camps, etc. I'd appreciate learning about your experiences/recommendations with Americree Ltd. as well, the new outfitter/owner since 2008. I've sent PMs requesting information to a couple of guys who posted about this lake back in 2008 and 2009. Whether you post in response or send me a PM, all information will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance."

1298961,phishfearme,2011-04-25 05:55:00,1242,"we did a trip to what was then north american bushman's crow bay camp on lac evans. not sure who runs it now. here's some thoughts off the top of my head: - camp manager who's sole role as far as i can see is to drink all your beer and eat all your food - this is a james bay lowlands lake. in some places you will only find 3-4 ft of water, flat featureless bottom for miles and miles - we thought our sounder was stuck but dipping a paddle in confirmed depth. this is NOT a canadian schield lake - no water at the cabin, had to haul lake water about 1/4 mile - you will get trophy pike just by trolling around but we found the walleye fishing sparse - very expensive for what you get and a long drive to metagami - outfitter forced us to put three guys in a boat - would not permit one guy in a boat except for another few hundred dollars - at a spot called the ""truck stop"" all the trucks were gone but there was a huge school of 19inch whitefish that were fun to catch on practically anything - some people love this lake - we did not rebook - much better deals and much better pike and walleye fishing in NW ontario. good luck, phish"
1299120,retire55,2011-04-25 13:53:00,1029,"Thanks for the feedback Phish. Besides your post above, I reread your comments posted back in 07 or 08. It was disappointing to read that your experience fishing walleye on Lake Evans (Crow Bay) was unsatisfactory. I would have thought that the walleye fishing would have been much better particularly where ever the rivers flow in. Like you, I'm much more used to fishing walleye in Canadian Shield lakes."
1299215,phishfearme,2011-04-25 18:25:00,1242,"the fact that the broadback river enters lac evan near the crow bay camp is why we chose crow bay over the other two camp options. although the situation looked excellent where the river comes in, walleye were few and far between. my buddy and i actually hauled a boat and motor above the falls to fish the untouched river there - we got one 22 inch walleye all day up there - an incredible bummer. another river inlet - the teodat river which was a two hour + ride from the cabin did produce good numbers of walleye - but were all less than 18inches - usually MUCH less than 18inches. some guys say they get large numbers of walleye - maybe when you only catch 2 or 3 large pike all day, catching a dozen walleye seems like great action. not by NW ontario standards though. i just like the structure associated with schield lakes - we did trips to two other james bay lowlands lakes (kesagami and lower detour) and will not be going back anytime soon. to each his own though. phish"
1299555,retire55,2011-04-26 14:27:00,1029,Just wanted to publicly say thanks to the guys who shared information via PMs. Very much appreciated guys.
1299622,5 of Diamonds,2011-04-26 17:17:00,151,"Been to Crow Bay 2009 & 2010. Never had a bad/questionable experience w/ any of Bushlands caretakers/guides/managers ever. Never hauled water (there is a water pump @ the Cabin that feeds 2 sinks and a hot shower). Lund boats (w/ boat seats that have backs!), Yamaha 4-stroke motors (started the first time every time w/ no fuel mixing), Hummin' Birds and camp has Honda generator.Caught and released trophy pike up to 48"" @ the 'Truck Stop' on both trips. One can expect to catch and release on average 2-4 40"" class Pike per day. I wouldn't tout this as a trophy Walleye destination as the largest we caught was 6#'s.Our groups have always felt the trips were worth the money given our expectations of the water as well as the equipment @ our disposal."
1300758,HookNlines,2011-04-29 09:21:00,7,"i to had tried to do some reseach on this last year , but go nowhere. say there was some logging being done. 5 of diamonds; where do you fly from , understand it is not Matagami anymore, and what aircraft is used? how were the guides at Crow bay."
1300937,duffitdad,2011-04-29 19:07:00,21,sir - i fished evans 2 years ago and met the operator Jim Saari. Even though I was fishing a time period that is not my favorite (mid july) I caught very nice pike and walleye. The camp caretaker was VERY good and everything went very well. I am taking my sons back to evans this year the first week of june and my ONLY concern with the trip is the possible late ice out. I have no reservations about recommending Evans lake. Assuming we can get the ice out in time for my trip I am anticipating a wonderful experience for my sons and I.
1301078,vteye,2011-04-30 06:41:00,812,Ice out will close to your trip this spring. Quebec had a long cold winter. We had cold weather (snow) up until Easter this spring in VT.
