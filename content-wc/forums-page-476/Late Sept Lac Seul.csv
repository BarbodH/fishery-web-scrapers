1324794,Hawkfan,2011-07-01 08:59:00,237,Does anyone have a suggestion on where to get a good map with depths for this area of Lac Seul?
1330222,J.Iverson,2011-07-15 12:21:00,64,ALEX WILSON COLDSTREAM IN DRYDEN HAS 4 MAPS THAT COVER THE ENTIRE LAKE. They are located in Dryden. You cal get their contact info on the Web. They usually mail it to you in a couple of days. They are great maps and they are on waterproof paper.
1330245,Hawkfan,2011-07-15 13:41:00,237,I'll check that out. Thanks for the info!
1317393,MorganMan,2011-06-12 11:28:00,341,"We are in the process of planning a late Sept short trip to Lac Seul and am finding it hard to know what your going to get from each lodge/resort by looking at websites. Cabins and boat pictures can be really different than what you actually find. Similar prices/boats etc, but wondering what those of you who have been to the Ear Falls area resorts/lodges think about your experience there. What did you like and not like? Is there much difference between them? Is that end better or worse than staying on the east end/south end? Any help or tips you may have would be greatly appreciated. We will not be taking our own boats. We don't need meals as we will take care of ourselves."
1317404,cruiseforever,2011-06-12 12:26:00,177,I would go to Lac Seul Lodge. Dan has always been a great host with nice cabins and boats.
1317414,teddi,2011-06-12 13:02:00,349,i would try lac seul evergreen lodge or gold eagle in ear falls. they both will treat you right.
1317436,JDP,2011-06-12 14:16:00,1457,"Evergreen Lodge, Lac Seul Lodge, White Wing Resort, Fisherman's Cove and Onaway are all excellent choices! In September I have stayed many times at Fisherman's Cove and would prefer their location as well as Onaway's (just nearby) in late September as you may have the opportunity to run up to Sunlight Lake as well as fish deeper water in the main lake basin. Lac Seul Lodge and White Wing would follow F.C. and O.L. in proximity to the areas I have fished.After fishing the West/Northwest water of Lac Seul for many years I have now fished the Central and the Northeast areas which are awesome!"
1317770,Hawkfan,2011-06-13 11:54:00,237,Are the cottages at Onaway Lodge as nice as they look in the videos on their website? It looked like they even had industrial appliances in the kitchen.
1317802,Weby13,2011-06-13 12:47:00,57,Half of the cabins at onaway are what you see on the website and the other half are decent. Blair and Kathy try to replace a old cottage or two every year! The boats are all great!!! 17 foot lund outfitters with 50 hp Hondasand a awesome fish house! They run a great lodge! You cant go wrong at onaway!!!
1317813,JDP,2011-06-13 13:07:00,1457,"I haven't been to Onaway since '06, but I believe the newest cabins are the largest cabins. When I say large, I mean LARGE as in 4 bedrooms. The appliances in the LARGE cabins are commercial grade. I would recommend checking with Blair/Kathy regarding the cabins that fit your group."
1317824,Guest,2011-06-13 13:22:00,0,"I have been going to Ojibway Outposts in Chamberlain Narrows for the past 15 years in late September or early October. It gets better every year. Ken and Brenda are great hosts and the fishing is terrific. Last year, 4 guys, 7 days over 1500 eyes. We have a contest every year so we keep pretty good records. You can travel away from camp or you can catch all the fish you want within a couple of miles of the camp. I have been to Lac Seul Lodge in Ear falls too and it was also very nice but we found the fishing much much better that time of year on the North East end. We don't fish for Northerns or Muskies but always pick up a few by accident."
1318396,MorganMan,2011-06-14 18:51:00,341,"Thanks for all of the info, you have all been a huge help. We have not fished Lac Seul and look forward to new surroundings. Only bad part is we have no ""go to"" spots like we have had the past 15 years. Oh well, we will find out what we have learned over the years. Thanks again."
1318440,MorganMan,2011-06-14 20:56:00,341,"Hey JDP,I see Sunlight lake on a map, looks like quite a trip to get there. What is it about Sunlight Lake that makes you want to travel that far??"
