When asked for ID's, I handed the agent my Driver's License, and my buddy had a state ID card. When asked why he didn't have a license, I starting thinking...oh boy! He had a DUI the year prior, but it was suspended. Anywho, we were told to go inside etc. After 1 hour, and him going off to a back room, they let us go. The stuff they brought up on his record was bizzare. All related to his DUI incident, but things that never even happened. They said next time there was some things that needed to be taken care of ahead of time, some forms??? Can't remember for sure. Lesson here, I told him he better check into what was really on his record. He was pissed, and never went back again. Oh well. Oh yeah....even before that, they ALWAYS pulled me over and went through car/boat/everything (no matter who was with me). And I really do have the cleanest record I know."
1329713,OmahaHawk,2011-07-14 07:46:00,5,"I took the advice of another poster and gave them a call. They were very friendly and answered all of my questions. The bad part is they can't give you a definite answer even after telling them the situation, they have to take it on a case by case basis."
1330012,go dart,2011-07-14 19:37:00,77,"I think its a roll of the dice. My son had a DUI conviction from 4 yrs ago. We crossed last year expecting the worst. We were never asked about our records, they scanned the passports, asked a few simple questions and we were outta there. (whew!) Maybe lucky who knows."
1328827,Guest,2011-07-12 12:12:00,0,"Sorry to beat a dead horse some more but I can't seem to find info to help me with my specific situation. I have never crossed into Canada so have no border crossing experience or history. Here goes. In 1989 I was stopped and charged with DUI in Idaho. I received a suspended sentence from the court and thus there was never a conviction of DUI. In 1990 I moved to another state and have lived there ever since. I am planning a trip to Canada later this year and recently checked my driving record with the state of Idaho. There is no record existing of my situation there from 22 years ago. I also checked my driving record from my current state and the only thing on it is a couple minor driving infractions (speeding ticket and out of date registration) from 1993. Am I on high ground to answer ""no"" to crime committed questions at border? or in the eyes of customs is being charged (but not convicted) of DUI 22 years ago constitute committing a crime? I am only asking because I don't want any suprises at border and am not sure how far back in time I need to reflect and be ok with customs... Thanks for the insight.."
1328867,ftfarms,2011-07-12 14:03:00,444,ive never ben asked about it but it shows up on your record when thay scan your passport. I was arrested in 1994 for a owi and got a suspended sentence. We got pulled around and asked to come in side this may. we sat there 35mins and he told us we could go but my buddy asked why he pulled us aside. so he told my three buddys to go out to the yukon and wait. than he told me it was cause i was arrested in 2008 for a dui but it was a non conviction (i was found not guilty) he was just making sure and he also said somthing about the owi in 1994 but he said that was old enough it didnt matter. So if thay pull u around just be cool and dont ask any more than needed. I thanked him he laughed and i got the he-- out of there. Im going back across in aug it will be interesting what happens this time.
1328882,Guest,2011-07-12 14:47:00,0,Do minor driving infractions need to be announced? Does customs consider these crimes ?
1328983,Guss,2011-07-12 18:30:00,27,"No, and no."
1329088,illiniharrison,2011-07-12 21:46:00,4,"I got a dui five and a half years ago. I was a little nervous about crossing the border Friday. When we crossed the agent asked normal questions, scanned our passports, and then he came to the window and told us to pull over for a id check. I figured it was because me. He came out asked again where we were going and we told him again. He said have a nice trip. A dui from 22 years ago will not be a problem"
1329101,OmahaHawk,2011-07-12 22:11:00,5,I know this is probably not going to be an issue but I don't want to be the reason we have issues at the border. 9 years ago I was ticketed for attempting to enter a tavern underage. That was the specifics on the ticket anyways. If they ask the question about ever being convicted of a crime what do I say? I was never arrested on this just given a ticket and had to appear in court and plead guilty.
1329135,Guss,2011-07-13 04:38:00,27,Find out if the charge is considered a felony. If not you should be ok.
1329169,JinxCanada,2011-07-13 06:16:00,1306,"ANY conviction in the USA that COULD have been an ""Indictable"" offense here in Canada (ie/ Felony for you USA guys) will render you ""inadmissable"" to Canada. If you had a DUI etc and received a fine, probation etc that IS a conviction. Contact Canada Immigration for any further questions. It's best to go right to the source rather than a forum for official information. Each case is different."
1329188,OmahaHawk,2011-07-13 07:01:00,5,Mine was considered a simple misdemeanor and there was a fine. Never arrested just ticketed. From the research I have done on the matter the problems come up with the chances that you could reoffend. Since I was a minor at the time I have no chance of ever reoffending for that particular offense.
1329543,halfmoon007,2011-07-13 19:51:00,121,I E like 1 to hrs like us west of Detroit take a practice run to the Ontario casino. for me a impaired driving in 84 has never been questioned. half moon in Mich.
