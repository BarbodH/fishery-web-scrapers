1328743,muskienorthernswalleye1516,2011-07-12 09:10:00,6,"Thanks for all the information guys. From what I have heard the Eastern portion of Lac Seul is where the concentration of muskies is. We will be more on the Northwestern section, so should we see what happens there or take the longer boat ride to the East?"
1328777,JDP,2011-07-12 10:41:00,1457,"Don't do it. If you are staying in the Ear Falls area you will need to travel a long, long distance to the NE Lac Seul Musky grounds. IMHO you are better off to trailer your boat to Musky water in the Ear Falls/Red Lake area."
1328888,davenathe,2011-07-12 15:07:00,113,"Yeah, do not boat the lake is 80 miles long. Either skip the muskie or try another lake close by."
1328903,emma17,2011-07-12 15:53:00,436,"Limey, that was some great video to get the juices flowing- same w your bobber fishing video. Thanks for sharing. Still trying to grasp the Brit- Canadian Fisherman thing. Good stuff"
1329053,bigwalleye1,2011-07-12 20:50:00,2632,"I see by your post you'll be on Minitaki camping the same time I'll be just up the lake at Frog Rapids. I think I responded to a post from you a while back looking for camping in the area. In specific answer to your post, I will do everything possible to NOT anchor. I prefer to move, even if it's a contolled downwind drift or a slip against the wind using a drift sock or an electric motor in reverse to slow myself while I jib the saddle areas, windy points and especially the sunken islands. I prefer larger jigs, 1/4 to 3/8, and I more along pretty fast while I jig. Safe travels to you all, I leave tomorrow after work."
1329335,emma17,2011-07-13 11:40:00,436,"Thanks Big Walleye- I will try it. I hope you have a trouble free ride and great trip- save some of those big ones for me. God willing, one week from this moment I will be on Minnitaki."
1330148,muskienorthernswalleye1516,2011-07-15 08:49:00,6,"I really appreciate the help. Looks like we'll be focusing on the good ol' walleyes and northern. Who knows, maybe a muskie will show up! Limey, great video, got me excited for those walleye!"

1327501,muskienorthernswalleye1516,2011-07-08 12:24:00,6,Heading up to Lac Seul in late July/First week of August and was wondering if any reports have come in on Lac Seul recently? Any tips as to how deep the Big Northerns are at that time (or muskie for that matter)? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
1327799,BenBeattie,2011-07-09 18:37:00,232,"For walleye, right now there are a couple things going on here. 1. there is a weedline walleye bite in 8-12 feet and 2. other walleye have moved to the big water (baisns) and are holding in 18-25 feet on islands, humps/reefs etc. Another tip... follow the wind! Fish structure that is being hit by the wind/waves. Muskie will still be relating to cabbage and holding relatively shallow ( < 10') for the most part. Bays with cabbage, stumps and any rocks mixed in are sure bets. Good luck and have fun."
1327804,emma17,2011-07-09 18:54:00,436,"Ben and/or any willing poster. I'd appreciate if you can give me a few pointers on tactics I'm not sure of. When you fish those windy spots will you fish humps/islands in basin? If so, do you anchor? If not, how do you control the boat? Do you jig w 3/8, 1/4 oz? Lindy rig? Do you use a different approach when fishing windblown shoreline? Can you slip bobber fish windy areas? How do you keep your bait down?"
1327809,lunker99,2011-07-09 19:13:00,236,"Anchor fishing is pretty much all we do when we are up there. Usually pitch 1/8 oz, but will move up to 1/4 if it is windy/wavy/deep enough to make feeling bottom difficult. Slip bobbering is excellent as well. Can either pitch upwind and let it ""troll"" across fishing area or shortline it near the boat so that it stays in place. If having issues keeping bait down, just move up in bobber size and use enough weight to keep your bobber just above the surface."
1327812,NWwalleye,2011-07-09 19:16:00,223,"Was out on Lac Seul for the last 3 days ..Caught walleyes along weed lines in 6 fow in the morning hours .. Then moved out to the humps during mid day and did well in 19 to 25 fow ..Today's weather condition ( cloudy + wind ) kept the walleyes on the weed lines all day . The group (2 Boats, 6 guys) caught 150 + walleyes in 6 hours of fishing ..Mayfly (fish fly) hatch is winding down and the fish will be moving out of the shallow shortly. Some fish are already out there, but all should be there in a week or so .."
1327927,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-10 07:58:00,429,Thanks & keep the updates coming! 20 days to go on our return trip to NW & Central area of Lac Seul. RBF
1327967,BenBeattie,2011-07-10 10:01:00,232,"I will anchor if it's really windy. Otherwise I prefer to backtroll or use a trolling motor. Wind has a greater effect on shallower bite along shorelines etc but still makes a difference on humps/saddles and islands in the basin. Eg. If I'm fishing an island in the main lake and the wind is coming from the E, I will fish the E side of the island first. Usually works out but if not I'll check out the off-wind side too. I use 1/4 or 3/8 oz jigs depending how windy it is and how deep I'm fishing. I only lindy rig in the spring when the water is cold and the walleye are inactive. I guarantee it would work all season though. Same for slip bobbers, they work too. If you have good electronics scan the area first and look for fish on bottom. If you mark them, you'll catch them."
1328157,Guest,2011-07-10 20:16:00,0,"Fished LS form 6/26-7/9 NE section. Fished the NW section> sawmill to windigo piont. Water temps 6/26 64 degrees main lake 7/9 69 degrees main lake. Many bays were 70-72 degrees. First week fish were real shallow. > 8' even the last week found them in 5' but spent most of the time in 10 - 14'. Most productive areas were McKenzie bay and east of Manatoba pt. Number of fish was very good but the size was not. Biggest was 25"" and wasn't the best year for over 17"" fish. Sand bans in Mckenzie held some fish but spent more time else where. Mostly spent time pulling spinner rigs. Did have some luck pulling/casting cranks. Water is down 3.5' from last year. Fish really were not stacked up like past years. Mayfly hatch was VERY INTENSE 7/1. Never seen so many mayflies in all the years up there! Most of the weed beds are in 4-5' of water and the northerns are still hanging around the beds. Biggest northern was 38.5"" Weather was decent and had sprinkles only 2 times and never got out the rain suit. Wind was not a issue like most years. Gas in Ear Falls was 1.36 ltr Will be back in 2 weeks! Hopefully the fish will start stacking up??"
1328159,emma17,2011-07-10 20:26:00,436,"Thanks for the advice. This is the year I have to really work on boat control, that is my biggest weakness. 8 days and counting. We'll be on Minitaki, I don't think the presentation or tactics change though."
1328371,Limeyangler,2011-07-11 11:21:00,563,"was at williams bay the other day.....found fish on a weedline, but they were not very active, went out to the main basin and anchored in 30'FOW...had some decent fish. They are moving out deeper as i type!i videod some of the action from the other day.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VkLxGtPxV4"
