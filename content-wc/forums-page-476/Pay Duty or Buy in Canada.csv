1329733,zman8701,2011-07-14 08:11:00,100,"If you buy beer before crossing the border, is it canadian beer or U.S.? What is the advantage of buying before you cross, or waiting and buying in Canada?"
1329807,ohiojmj,2011-07-14 10:55:00,1262,"Case of Labatts is US$19.16 with tax in Ohio and about US$32 in Canada (includes Mastercard foreign exchange fee and dollar valuation difference). I always bring Canadian beer from Ohio to Canada, but also stop for some better flavors at the B store, but travel hours and store locations can complicate B store purchase. I always bring 1 or 1.75 L of liquor from Ohio (cheaper than LCBO if I recall). I always buy two 1L's of liqour at duty free before returning to US ($20 for 1L Crown Royal, $13 for Jimmy Beam). From my experience at Buffalo and Niagara Falls, going in either direction, a little over the limit of 1L or 1 case will never trigger a duty hassle. Relatives from Buffalo and employees at duty free store suggest 2L's never gets you stopped for duty, even after a short 3 hour visit across."
1329825,MrWalleye73,2011-07-14 11:15:00,821,"I remember the old border patrol station in I-Falls, remember, only 2 check in booths, and those long lines???? That wasn't fun on a Friday night or Saturday morning for sure! We waited 2+ hours on a Friday afternoon to cross. I hadn't packed the back of my truck when I picked up my friend back at home, he put all his stuff in and I was fussing with the trailer. He had previosuly mentioned he was going to buy beer at the beer store in Ft Frances. So I told the guy we had 2 cases of beer, which I had purchased. Well, pull over to be checked he said. No sweat. The gal opens up my tailgate, and to my surprise, we now had 6 cases of beer. I was like, GREAT, trouble for me! She never said a word, she said she was doing a weapons check, and off we went. That and another time with his DUI issue, wonder why I stopped taking that friend with me??? Otherwise, I have always been honest with them when we are over the limit. It's all about time etc when deciding where to buy your booze. We did the buy the liquor at duty free and buy beer over the border thing. At that time I paid close to $80 US for two cases. I figure a case being $12-15 around here and the $9 something tax, it's cheaper to pay the duty. The customs agent usually helps us with that too. Taxing us for whatever is going to get us out for the least amount. Buy beer at home, liquor and smokes (smoke em if you got em) at the duty free. Unless you go when they are out almost everything!! That, or make sure the rest of your party are non-drinkers!! LOL"
1329382,PARAJOHN,2011-07-13 12:53:00,15,"Definately buy it in the US. We always buy Canadian beer at DFA just before crossing the border at I. Falls. 10 cases for 180.00 plus 90 for duty. (Best Bargain on Canadien Beer and 5% alcohol) If you are also buying the hard stuff, pay the duty on all the beer and declare a litre per person (duty free). It is the cheapest way to go. Two years ago we forgot the vodka at home and a 1.75 of cheap vodka was 45.00 at the liquor store in Souix Lookout. I could have bought the same stuff at my local liquor store for 15.00. I also checked the beer prices and they were around 35.00 per case.Hope to see you on the water 7/30-8/6 on the west end of Lac Seul."
1329394,Aaron-IN,2011-07-13 13:23:00,500,"Bringing beer into Canada, being over the limit and paying the duty will more than likely get you spending more time than you want to at the border. In most cases it will get you pulled over and searched, at least that has been my experiance. about 15 years ago myself and three other guys brought 14 cases of beer with us. That got us held up for about two hours as all of our stuff got looked through pretty good. I do agree with the above poster....it is cheaper to buy in the US and pay the duty."
1329411,new hips,2011-07-13 13:55:00,498,"I agree, we always take the max. beer in duty free, then buy the booze when in Canada."
1329423,NemegosendaRiver,2011-07-13 14:16:00,66,"This is interesting. My experience is quite the opposite. When we declare our beer (3 cases per adult) to pay duty on it we have been searched WAY less than the other way around. Our guess is that they figure if we are declaring 27 cases, how much more could we be bringing."
1329430,Mike Borger,2011-07-13 14:38:00,1554,"This a no brainer regardless of what the cost is. Our beer may cost you a bit more, but it's so much better."
1329434,PARAJOHN,2011-07-13 15:00:00,15,"I would also agree with this assesment of customs. I've only been checked twice in the last 20 years and neither of them were more than a 20 minutes. ( 2 to 4 trips per year) In fact, on both occasions one of us went in and paid the duty while another person(s) in the party stayed with the agent. It seems that the more honest and up front you are with the customs officers the easier time you have with them. Also, keep your beer visable and receipt handy and if they do happen to take a look it seems to make the check go alot smoother and quicker."
1329535,halfmoon007,2011-07-13 19:34:00,121,"20 years its a 50/50 deal. seen us tell them we have 2 1/2 cases each and they say go, or they say pay the duty. its a timing thing, cross at 7 in the morning or 10 at night the canada beer/store not open before going north into the bush. buy all the booze and smokes at duty free (include the cigars and crown for the camp owner ) pay the duty and move on. walleye on Halfmoon from Mich."
1329541,joeman79,2011-07-13 19:45:00,417,"Busch Light is the ""Nectar of the gods"" For our Drinkin Team with a fishin Problem. But we just bring all we are allowed and then load up on Kokanee and Kieths and this year some Blue Lite and Sleemans will be waiting at cabin I hope!! 15 days!!"
1329646,jignminow,2011-07-14 05:47:00,168,"or, maybe I should just drink less? NAaaaaaaa"
1329730,Lambertson Rock Guy,2011-07-14 08:09:00,20,Three of us crossed at I. Falls a couple of weeks ago. We had five 24 packs of beer and fully expected to pay duty on two of the 24 packs. When asked if we had any alcohol we told him we had five 24 packs and he just waved us through and said to have a good trip. This was my first experience bringing more than the allowed amount. I am sure it will be a different experience next time but this one sure went well.
1329246,mittni,2011-07-13 08:43:00,28,I know this has been brought up but I can't find any clear cut advice. If we pay duty what will they need from us. Also what is the price per 10 dollars of booze
1329253,Hawkfan,2011-07-13 08:56:00,237,"It's always been easier for us to buy in US and pay duty. But we also take beer and a pretty good amount of it. So if we buy at home we can pack it where we need to in the trailer and still get to our bags, etc. for the night before we fly out. How much duty depends on what you're taking. They will also ask how much you paid for it so that will also factor in. We usually have a receipt for proof, but have never been asked for it."
1329281,IaDave,2011-07-13 10:02:00,476,Just had a friend get back and they bought beer here-Busch Light 30 packs- and paid the duty and I think he said it was $9.00 a pack. As you can tell they are tight with the money-Busch Lite. Myself I would buy beer in Canada and spend the extra
1329296,phishfearme,2011-07-13 10:35:00,1242,"there is no doubt that it is considerably cheaper to buy beer and booze on the US, declare it and pay the duty. like dave said, the duty is about $9 on a case of beer - irrespective of what you paid for it - and liquior is higher. to us the decision is simple - how much time do you want to spend at the border? going in to pay the duty can be very time consuming as there's usually a line for other issues also that you have to get into (the grand portage entrance is much better here though) and this also increases the risk of getting your car ""stripped searched"" as they already have you there. if you only want a case or two above the duty free limit, it's probably easiest to get it in canada - lots of cases though could be a good savings. so, how much is your time worth? phish"
1329298,Tylumps,2011-07-13 10:36:00,73,"If you want to save money, pay the duty. I live in Michigan and go to Canada with my family from Wisconsin. We meet in the Soo and cross there so the Wisconsin folks buy the beer for the group and we split it up evenly within the cars. The Wisconsin group buys the beer because the taxes are much lower and no deposit.If you do bring beer across, have this information ready at the border.How many 24 can cases do you have. (If you bring 30 packs, figure how many 24 can cases it would be)Have recipts for what you paid per 24 pack case ready for the cashier at the border. The cashier sometimes doesn't want to be bothered with looking at your recipts so just have them in your hand and say for example. "" I have 3 people in my car and 7 cases of beer, I paid about $12 dollars a case."" The casier will then figure you for duty on 4 cases of beer at the price you gave. The main thing is to know what you paid and how many 24 can cases you have. The cashier get iretated with the people not knowing that the duty is figuered on 24 packs and people not knowing what they paid. Also, don't ask if the duty is in Canadian funds. The cashier will bark back, "" well you are in Canada.""For the most part the Canadian border people are very nice, they just seem to get frustrated with us eager vacationing Americans. Have fun!!!Another note..The cashier is not the person in the booth that you pull up to. The border person that asks for all your passport info and reason for crossing, is not interested in the cost of the beer you have. The border person will ask if you have anything to declare and that is when you tell them the amount of 24 pack cases you have. If you have more than allowed, the border person will ask you to pull to the side and go into the office where the cashier is. Then you have the proper info ready, cost and qty, ready for the cashier. take care."
1329304,troutwater,2011-07-13 10:50:00,299,"Well two weeks ago two of us brought across 5 cases of beer, 3 30 packs, and a 1.75 and the duty ended up being 74 bucks. We thought it was well worth it to pay the duty at the border."
1329310,mittni,2011-07-13 11:02:00,28,Very good info. We have a guy that will drink a case to a case and a half everyday so I think we will pay the duty. One question is we usually cross very early in the morning 6am. Is the office open at that time. Thanks
1329328,jignminow,2011-07-13 11:31:00,168,"We brought 2 1.75L Crown Royal with us in addition to the 1L bottle that we bought at the duty free. I declared it, we were asked to pull over and go inside but were not searched. It took almost 45 minutes to get out of there and it cost us a ton!!!!! It was about $80 for those two bottles. I will just bite the bullet and pay for it on the other side.............."
1329358,Freytown,2011-07-13 12:14:00,770,"My group likes to travel at night, getting to the border around mid-night. If they question the amount of beer & we are over the limit, we pay the duty. Many times is only one more case (we getting older, lol) and we get waved right through.At that time of the night/morning nothing really is open in Canada to purchase beer. If you you could buy then, it would take longer in a store & more $$ than with duty payment anyway.PS: Don't lie...been there, done that. Ouch!!"
1329374,Obabikon,2011-07-13 12:38:00,2370,liquor is taxed at like 105% or something like that. Buy booze in canada and beer in the US.
