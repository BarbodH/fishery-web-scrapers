Water was cold when we were there, so can't help you with where they will be biting. We had very good luck at the seat cushion. Have no idea what will be there next week. Have fun and save a few for me next year."
1329514,stevensinks,2011-07-13 18:53:00,330,Sandman I was wondering if you made it up to Black Bear this year. Next Friday my wife and I are on our way. With the temps being over 100 down here I cant wait.. Charlie
