Numerous fish between 18-26 inches, slots were a little down in size but plenty of 15-16 inchers for a good shore lunch."

We will be heading out the second week in August for two weeks, seems a long ways away. Last year in the same time frame the fish where scattered and I was only picking up one or two fish in a spot and then had to move on. Spent a lot of time run and gunning around Big Sand, had trouble finding fish in the slot? Biggest walleye was a 30"" caught just behind Green island At dusk. I would sure like to get onto a school of eaters this go around, might try Rough Rock haven't fished it before but worth a try. When are you out at Minaki next?"
