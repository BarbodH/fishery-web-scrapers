1329393,Lafayette,2011-07-13 13:23:00,4,I am looking at going to Canyon Lake near Vermillian Bay and wondered if anyone has info that would be helpful. I have read the web site from Blyth's and wonder if the Musky fishing is the way they make it sound. How is the Walleye fishing? Thanks in advance.
1329453,plumberjoe,2011-07-13 16:10:00,54,I stayed at North Country Lodge last year in Aug. We are not musky fishernman mainly walleye. We caught 25 to 50 every night most were on the small side. We saw 15 musky while walleye fishing and caught one small one we also had 2 large ones on but with walleye tackle we lost both of them. If you want musky action I think this would be a good choice. I was up there deer hunting last fall and the whitefish were spawning near the inlet and there were some very large musky chasing them at night we went down and watched them one night. Sorry I'm not more help on the fishing I love the area and will be going up for my 5th year of deer hunting this fall.

Just below Canyon on the river is the Indian Lake Chain and below that Corner and Langton. Canyon is good for open water trolling and shoreline fishing. Tons of small fish, medium fish and a few biggies. You just have to fish through the smaller ones to get to the biggies.DC"
