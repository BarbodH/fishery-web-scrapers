1329530,joeman79,2011-07-13 19:21:00,417,We are headed to Minaki in 2 weeks for a 4 day fly in and 3 days at BNL and would also would appreciate any current reports. Getting very anxious. Hope I see 2 or 3 Wardens and can observe their arrogance and brutality first hand. More than likely I will end up shaking their hand and thanking them for protecting Ontario's awesome resource. And if they are Rude I will just answer their questions politely and watch them leave unable to find any violations. And if they do f ind any violations I will pay them and return every year I am able.
1329597,Moondog,2011-07-13 21:41:00,362,I will retract my post.
1329600,joeman79,2011-07-13 21:55:00,417,I was referring to previous Warden post. I am glad there are Wardens out there doing there job protecting the resource.

There is a eagles nest at the end of the narrows on the right hand side. We trolled from there to Muskie bay along that shore with 800 series reef runners in 17-25 feet of water and got Muskie and walleyes. Big sand just a bottom bouncer with a 4' leader and a red hook fishing the reefs and mud. Fish are probably out of the mud now and normal summer places are on. Aaron has a good report in a earlier post. Leeches and crawlers both worked well. We never seen a warder, but I heard they where checking coolers for beer in little sand. I think Jiggnminnow aka Steve Wanders will be up there the same time. You may want to PM him as he knows the summer bite well. PM me if you got any questions. Good luck!"
