1330091,bigdaddy66,2011-07-15 05:20:00,7,It has been 5 years since I have been there. We went in August and had high water. Begining of trip we fished near village of Tobin. As water got high and dirty we had to do a 45 min boat ride out into the big body of water.

It was beautiful weather in October for us but I've heard a lot about there being snow at that time too! There are quite a few hotels and resorts in the Nipawin area. The roads are fairly good, as far as Canadian highways go. Everyone told me that cranking at night with the big bomber lures was how you caught the big ones but I didn't see any other boats out there the night we tried it. Most of the fishing was early morning or evening drifting with lindys. There will be a lot of boats fishing a few key spots so it won't be hard to figure out where to go. Just get a map from the bait shop of how to navigate the river and you will be fine. Keep in mind there are very strict requirements on what size fish you can keep. If I remember correct, to keep a trophy walleye, it has to be 34"" or more!"
