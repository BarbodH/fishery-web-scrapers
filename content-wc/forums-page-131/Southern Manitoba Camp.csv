Would want to bring our own boat, have protected docks and kids like to swim if itâ€™s an option. Need decent cabins with a full bathroom and kitchen if my wife and daughter are going to approve!"

Lake Winnipeg is just north of Winnipeg, but it is a huge lake, can be some good fishing at times on the southern end. Many of the folks who live in Winnipeg head east towards LOW, there are a number of lakes east almost to the Ontario border, which get some publicity on occasion. If you want to travel a ways north, there is some terrific fishing, but you'll put some miles on. I have fished the area around Snow Lake, but it is many miles north. Bill"

Very good walleye fishing opener into mid-July. Conservation license is $35 CDN and you can keep 4-fish limit. They have cabins right on the water and some not located right on the water. Nice, clean sandy beach for swimming. Contact Matt and Erin Thunder for info and reservations."
