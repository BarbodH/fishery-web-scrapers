My buffer zone from arriving back from holiday and starting work evaporated with the storm that hit Toronto and delayed our flight 18hours, only to have the storm follow us the next day to NW Ontario. *3' *hard packed snow x 2.5 acres was my first job before we even could get the suitcases from the car. Up the next day for work on a new schedule and then the flu whacked me and I was liquid at both ends for 4 days. A few more days of work after that followed by another dump of snow and I finally made it to my happy place.*VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/W4BCHxh0nsA"
