6300690,kvman1959,2019-03-16 13:07:00,45,Was wondering anyone's thoughts on bringing Mountain House foods when packing for a fly in to save weight. Planning eating allot of fish.
6300700,adempsey2.0,2019-03-16 13:26:00,611,"100lbs per person goes a long way. Probably unnecessary to bring dehydrated food. Even if you do happen to get charged for overweight, it is typically 0.50 to 1.25 per pound extra. That would also likely be cheaper than buying all that dehydrated food."
6300714,kona77,2019-03-16 14:41:00,236,"We have never had to resort to bringing in dehydrated type foods on our trips and we eat like kings..We also have 100Lb weight requirements and are always very close to this goal.. Lots of tricks to manage weight requirements. We will make some frozen foods (scrambled eggs, spaghetti/meatballs) and package them in freezer bags and use this for our ice to keep stuff cold on the way up to our outpost. Any food stuff in jars/glass are put into plastic containers ( I even due this with booze after we cross the border).. We bring up powder drink mixes and portable water filtration systems etc. etc. We weigh all our stuff before we start our trips so there are no surprises at the outfitter/fly out base camp.. We do have our beer flown in ahead of time and I know many outfitters over this service. I also have some pretty durable Styrofoam coolers and I will transfer stuff to these coolers the morning we fly out.. I have kept a list of food, fishing and ""misc"" stuff weights on each trip that goes back 15-20 years. Some planning will go along way to help you meet the fly-in weight goals from your outfitter. Of course I see groups show up every year with everything 'but the Kitchen sink!!"" and then scramble to figure out what they can leave behind (or pay the extra weight fee),"
6300836,hoppy63,2019-03-16 22:19:00,367,"I take several cases of beer for me.....automatic over weight!!!! Other guy in our group brings way more jigs than ever needed, but I don't question It. Point is even at $1.50lb overage, which is high, at 300lb=$$450.........../our group is 6=$75 per man. It is our vacation....not going to skimp. Try to keep it down within reason, but we go in knowing we are over. Usually the outfitter will work with us at least a little bit. Lipton noodles, mac and cheese, dry stuff like that for side dishes can save weight. I plan for breakfasts 6 days, dinners for 3 nights, (the other nights are fish) and some lunch meats for lunch on boat."
6300994,Walleye2242,2019-03-17 10:09:00,263,"interesting topic. for me, if i was going by myself then yeah..i would be all for that idea. I wouldnt spend that much time cooking and such if i was by myself...quick meals and lots of fish would be fine for me. Now if you have a group then i would say dehydrated food might be a pain fr a group of guys. Not sure."
6301062,Ogoki,2019-03-17 12:07:00,291,"After 40 plus fly in trips , we figure out our meal numbers . Usually go in for minimum of 9 days . Eat fish everyday. Can't get fish like that at home . Bags of precut slaw mix ( cabbage). Quick and easy slaw. Take plastic container with lid . Mix in dressing of choice and refrigerate . Bag of potatoes and boxes of dehydrated potatoes . Big breakfast . Use quarts of egg beaters for scrambled eggs . Don't Take up as much space as eggs and don't worry about breaking . Freeze before trip and acts as ice in coolers Take partially cooked bacon . No refrigeration and warm in skillet . Pancake mix . I Boat snacks . Summer sausage , cheese and good crackers . Peanuts ,nuts ,dried fruit . Put in zip locks and go in boat cooler ."
6301190,h8go4s,2019-03-17 17:55:00,1673,"It's been a long time since I did a fly-in, but when I did there was a scale at the dock. Everybody got on the scale and then all the baggage got weighed. As long as we were under the plane's capacity all was well. So.........recruit little guys or children."
6301216,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2019-03-17 19:02:00,240,"Hi--I have tweaked our menu on just about every fly-in we've taken, which is 25 and counting. I feel that resorting to a menu heavy on freeze-dried food is a poor choice, especially when the cost of this stuff outweighs any 'overweight' savings you might realize. Here is what I currently have planned for a 6-night fly in trip this June: Breakfasts: *blueberry pancakes with either bacon or sausage *ham and eggs *fishing camp breakfast: pan fried walleye, hash browns, scrambled eggs with wild rice and monterey jack cheese, english muffins Lunches: *fish fry or shore lunch *pasties + cole slaw *deli meat and deli cheese sandwich on cottage bread, w/chips Dinners: *fish fry *brats/burgers + freshly made potato salad *bbq boneless chicken breasts + caesar salad *beer batter walleye, grilled salamini, lobster mac and cheese *(last night in camp) ribeyes, jumbo shrimp, caesar salad It seems that no matter what is on the menu, some type of walleye/pike always supplements the meal: blackened jackfish, grilled walleye, etc. I am the de facto camp cook and menu planner, and I have never not tweaked the menu from one year to the next. None of this meal prep work ever affects the 12 hour days we spend on the water (or on the dock when the wind is blowing in). Thanks to whomever started this thread! One of favorite topics!"
6301224,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2019-03-17 19:20:00,240,"addendum to my previous post, to account for weight restrictions: *we always have our beverages (beer, pop, water, etc.) flown in ahead of time--shaves 150+ pounds of weight right there--although this more expensive option. *outfitter can also fly in Crisco shortening, canned potatoes, and Heinz brand baked beans, too, which is a way to save another 50 pounds. Paying a bit more for this service is well worth it when weighing in the morning of the fly out."
