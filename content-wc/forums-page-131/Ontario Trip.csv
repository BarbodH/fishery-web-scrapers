Housekeeping cabins, bait for sale, free ice. Great family run operation, and a great family running it. I've got over 30 trips in there."

6295184,fldoc1,2019-03-04 10:20:00,69,"Lumberjack Lodge - southern end of Sturgeon Lake - easy drive 40 miles north of Ignace - go through Pigeon River of I-Falls. about the same distance either way. A small lodge with very reasonable rates and many super small darkwater lakes nearby with lots of walleyes and northerns. Not a fancy resort on a big, deep lake that is also fishable. It is a clearer lake so more work to find fish. We were there for a week in early July and really did not fish Sturgeon Lake. In July and August they have a family plan so I would check it out. We plan on going back sometime this summer (probably July or August) and I will take my 14 foot older fishing boat with a 15 horse honda. Any basic fishing boat would work and they rent boats / motors. I have a bigger Lund that I would bring if I was only fishing Sturgeon but we will concentrate on the nearby, smaller Lakes. Their web-site is in repair as new owners will be taking over but the old owners will be there some this summer and know lots of great small lakes to fish. I just talked with the past owner and if you are interested call Dave at 218-624-8944 He is doing the reservations for the summer and lives just outside of Duluth. Lots of room in July and August. Randy from Duluth"

6295998,prov1800,2019-03-06 07:05:00,5010,Just the way the regulations are.camping on crown land is regulated and most 1/2 mi from shoreline.iam all for it to keep everything pristine.the old days people could camp anywhere and some of these spots ended up looking like a refugee camp.
6296032,lenray,2019-03-06 07:45:00,467,Just saying I travel 1200 miles one way-travel on bad gravel over 100 miles--go up river over 12 miles portage over to next water. Bring back EVERYTHING i took in and buy the overnight permits. NEVER bring fish home and always put the big ones back. Just saying--if I had young buck mules to do the heavy work--no question about doing that kind of trip. I am 74.....
6301614,Moosebunk,2019-03-19 07:07:00,211,"You're not far at all from Nestor Falls and my buddy Pat's lodge... http://www.lakeofthewoodslodge.com/ Plenty of fishing options with this, take your own boat, pick your plan."
6302432,Pasha Lake,2019-03-21 10:16:00,3,"Get ahold of us on social media, our website or phone Chad Thompson for a quote, We might be able to accommodate, but you will have to talk to Chad in order to find out. We offer phenomenal walleye and pike fishing and offer charter fishing on Nipigon for hundreds of walleye, lakers, pike, and Brooke trout."
6292978,dpkesler,2019-02-24 20:09:00,3,"Looking to plan my first ever Canada fishing trip. I have three boys who have all fished since they could walk. We have fished a lot in the Boundary Waters and MInnesota.Looking to give Canada a try this summer. Understand that I am late to book. Looking for a lake with numbers rather than quality. I just want to keep the boys busy. Walleye, smallmouth and/or pike would be preferred. Smaller lakes would also be preferred. Looking for camping or rustic cabin. I will bring my own boat. Any suggestions for a camp with camping and “numbers” would be helpful. Thank you in advance."
6292986,lionfan19,2019-02-24 21:06:00,41,Although I admire your enthusiasm I cannot imagine trying to put something like this together this late in the game. Best of luck.
6292988,adempsey2.0,2019-02-24 21:27:00,611,"I assume you are coming from MN.A few to check out:http://canoecanada.com/cabin/nym-lake/http://discoverylake.com/outposts.html (The Dominion Lake and Zarn Lake Outposts)I have never been to any of these camps, but something to start your research with."
6293040,Baseline,2019-02-25 07:19:00,3207,"You are not too late. There will be plenty of opportunity at many resorts. Check out Separation Lake Camp. It is on the English River north of Kenora. They have a resort and a full service campground. Agimac River Camp just north of Ignace. They also have cabins and a campground. The area surrounding Agimac has many drive to lakes which are loaded with walleyes and pike. If you want to camp on an island there are lake that have ramps and many campsites out on the lake. Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods also has lots of opportunity for excellent walleye, pike and smallmouth fishing. You don't mention where you live, but plan on attending one or more of the sports shows. The resorts are there and you can talk to the owners first hand. If you live in MN the Northwest Sports Show is coming up in March and there will 100 or so resorts there. If you need any additional info you can PM me and I will answer any question I can."
6293052,MN_Moose,2019-02-25 07:42:00,964,You could try Sunnyside Camp on the Winnipeg river north of Kenora. Not too big water. You can always find someplace out of the wind. Camping is cheap. Lots of Canadians stop in for a night while traveling cross country. Meet some interesting and great people. The only drawback is the river is a two fish limit for Americans.
6293102,h8go4s,2019-02-25 10:13:00,1673,There will be lots of resorts here:http://www.northwestsportshow.com/
6293110,Obabikon,2019-02-25 10:41:00,2370,"I have some openings in our outpost cabin... it's actually a nice one, and would be a good first trip. I know that you suggested a smaller lake, but the Morson area does not fish ""big""... and the cabin is actually located right before the entrance to ""Obabikon Lake"" which is an 8 mile lake full of pike. Lots of fun for kids."
6293144,dpkesler,2019-02-25 13:05:00,3,Can you PM your resort info. I probably was not really clear. Smaller lakes have been easy to read and fish so our luck has always been better. Our main goal is catching fish without attempting to learn a lake in an attempt to find a monster. Thanks
6293146,dpkesler,2019-02-25 13:12:00,3,Thank you
6293158,CI_Guy,2019-02-25 14:31:00,2118,We've been going to Frog Rapids for several years. You have direct access to Pelican and Abram Lakes with Minnitaki a short boat ride away thru Abram's shoot. Pelican is a smaller lake but you'd have the option of trying bigger water if you wanted to.http://frograpidscamp.ca
