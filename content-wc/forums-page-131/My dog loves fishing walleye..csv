The bite was pretty much on for the whole hour or so before it started getting dark. Roloff has not been fishing with me for a while as he is getting on a bit now and has difficulty with long treks in the snow, so a trip to the bridge now it is warmer was right up his alley!VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/9aY0JVCysDI"

6302334,BornToFish,2019-03-21 06:41:00,1224,"Greetings, Limey: That was a cool video! I loved the segment when your dog was staring down the hole and whimpering. It was as though he was saying to you: ""hurry up, what's taking so long?"". It seemed as though it was just a little while ago that you were playing ""fetch"" with your dog - throwing the ball into the water shortly after ice-out. It's neat to see such a special relationship between a man and his dog. Kindest regards...."
6302372,ogilville,2019-03-21 07:53:00,262,Awesome! You have to love a dog that loves to fish.
6302404,Limeyangler,2019-03-21 08:53:00,563,"LOL...thanks Chuck. I have often wondered what it is some people 'dislike' about some of my videos, maybe they just hit the wrong button....lol. I don't sweat it though, they are entitled to their 2 cents worth, and in watching my video their 2 cents worth is my 2 cents from youtube partner program.Quote: Originally Posted by andreindyExcellent.Thank you Andre, he's a great companion.Quote: Originally Posted by rather-be-fishin❤️ The video & your dog! ❤️����Thanks!

BillThanks Bill, I think I replied to you on Youtube too about him getting older and it being more difficult to accompany me on the ice unless its local and drivable by truck or walkable, but after that session I realized how much i miss having him with me.Quote: Originally Posted by BornToFishGreetings, Limey: That was a cool video!

I guess its because I take him out the most. It is really funny that he actually responds to the sound my Gopro makes when I turn it on, as soon as he hears it he races over because he knows there is a chance a fish is coming up the hole or into the boat, I guess the 'Pavlov's Dogs' theory is spot on!Quote: Originally Posted by ogilvilleAwesome!
