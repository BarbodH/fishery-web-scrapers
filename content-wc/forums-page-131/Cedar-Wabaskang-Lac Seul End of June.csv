6298818,NSN Duke,2019-03-11 20:22:00,3,"Looking to book a trip in the Cedar/Wabi/Lac Seul region for a couple of guys for the end of June or begining of July. Any recent reports on any of the lakes or any suggestions on lodges would be appreciated. We are mainly targeting Walleye, but some of us are definitely interested in smallies, pike, and some musky would be a bonus. Cedar would be nice because they seem to have the best musky fishing but we're concerned as we've heard that Cedar may have gone down hill in the past couple years and some of the pictures/reports don't seem to plentiful in terms of numbers. Lac Seul seems like the premier lake in the region but worried out the size being an issue. NSN Duke - Pymatuning"

6298934,UKBDM,2019-03-12 08:04:00,178,"You can probably still find something for two guys somewhere on those lakes but it might be tough. I have fished Wabaskang for 10 years out of Jim and Julie's near the south end. Took us ""American"" fisherman 2-3 years to figure out ""Canadian"" fishing but we have been very satisfied with the numbers and size on Wabaskang. Very few musky but walleye, smallmouth, and pike fishing is great. My experience is that in a typical week of walleye fishing you will have two really good days, two average days, and two tougher days. I use the smallmouth and pike fishing to fill in on those tougher days. Really good = 50+ walleye/boat Average = 25+ walleye/boat Tougher = < 25 walleye/boat There are definitely better fisherman on this website who could average better those numbers on any lake including Wabaskang. We primarily fish jig/minnow or jig/grub tipped w/ piece of nightcrawler."
6298990,Lake Wisconsin,2019-03-12 09:31:00,1960,"I have fished Wabby 5-6 weeks and lac Seul 2x's. Both are very good lakes. Number wise, I have landed over 100 walleye per day on each of them. Both can make you look like you never fished before. Quality of the fish, it is better on Lac Seul - more fish above 25"" for sure. I have found lac suel an easier place to fish. If you have decent fish IQ, you can put together a program fairly easy. For example, the 1st time I ever fished lac seul, we drove around for 3-4 hours just scanning with our electronics the day we arrived. When we finally decided to drop a line, between my partner and I we landed around 50 walleye in about 3 hours in an afternoon on a wind-blown point that lead to a weed flat. The fish were in the transition weed edge in 5-8 fow. We could see them on our side scan and it was game over. On Wabaskang, I will say I have my established milk run to find the fish, but not all places ""made sense"" on where you found them. But if there were in a particular spot, I usually could keep that spot productive all week long as long as pressure did not become an issue. As a bonus, Wabaskang has decent perch numbers and we have been able to come back with good numbers when we have decided to chase them. And we have landed pike better than 40"" out there as well. From a wind standpoint, you can always find a spot out of the rough water to fish Wabaskang. On LS, it depends on where you are staying. The one year we were out of ear falls, and could always fish the river if needed."
6299252,NSN Duke,2019-03-12 20:01:00,3,"Anyone go at the end of June or early July? Just wondering if the water would be getting too warm at that point, more so in the smaller lakes (Cedar)"
6299280,UKBDM,2019-03-13 05:01:00,178,Wabaskang is usually in mid to higher 60's last week of June. Usually mayflies are an issue somewhere on the lake that week.
6299292,ogilville,2019-03-13 06:28:00,262,I have been fishing on Wabaskang for over 30 years. This description by UKBDM is what I think is an honest accurate account of the average week of fishing on Wabaskang. Of course I had a chuckle thinking that this is a message board full of fishermen. I'm sure there are stories where you are going to need a bigger boat to hold all the fish. Like the time I had to stand behind a tree to bait my hook.
6303206,NSN Duke,2019-03-23 08:08:00,3,Would the Indian lake chain be comparable to fishing Cedar lake?
6303218,prov1800,2019-03-23 08:21:00,5010,"The Indian lake chain would be similar to cedar lake minus the crappie but there are lake trout in the system.fairly clear water.ive been ice fishing at KC,s landing on Edward Lake one of 7 lakes on the Indian Chain all winter.Its one Clarks drive in lakes.worth checking out.fantastic muskie also.www.clarksresorts.com. Or message me for more info."
