6303644,Bill Krejca,2019-03-24 15:16:00,6107,"Well played, the smile said it all!! Bill"
6303846,johnboat,2019-03-24 19:32:00,2014,"Limey,Yes, most of the fishing was done on lakes that are not accessible by boat. And I'm sure that was the reason the bite was non stop. The action would get so fast we'd have to do away with the Canadian Tip Ups, aka willow branches most of the time. The camp owner always said to me, ""If you come up ice fishing, you may not come back in the Spring."" I still come back, but can see what he was talking about.Thanks for your suggestions on tackle. I mostly target walleyes. But will spend a day on Lakers as well.StJoeGuy,Check out Five Lakes Lodge for an ice fishing trip. They'll have the sleds and the gear you'll have to bring up will be minimal. The owner will guide you and definitely won't disappoint. PM with any questions."
6302162,johnboat,2019-03-20 18:26:00,2014,"I went Ice fishing in Canada for the first time a little over a year ago and have plans to go up again January of 2020. The fishing was great to unbelievable and I loved the journeys through the bush, the beauty of Canadian winters, and solitude.Since that time I have been following a handful of outfitters and camps during the ice season and every group has been having great luck with walleye numbers as well as pike size (45""+). A handful of walleyes have been 28""+. For those who spend a fair amount of time ice fishing Canada in the past or recently........Is this the norm, or have the last couple years been better than most?The areas I have been following are between Lac Seul to Big Trout Lake. Not so much the Lake of The Woods area. I would like to hear from those with experiences/knowledge of Ice Fishing Canada. Best times to go, favorite tackle, baits, etc....?But mainly, has it turned on the last few years or always been great?Thanks"
6303178,Limeyangler,2019-03-23 06:54:00,563,"Ive been here 11 years in Dryden, , Its always been great since i've been here and can never understand why more people don't visit to do it. These days you have all the electronics, sleds, shelters etc to keep you comfortable and on fish. I've had plenty of 27"" walleye through the ice, whitefish, Burbot, lakers, pike and more recently crappie. The bonus with ice fishing is you can reach some lakes that are not accessible in the softwater months. Everything you could want, but like you say fishing is only part of the experience, its fun as heck to head out on the sleds for an adventure, thats what i'm doing this morning....cant wait. As for tackle tips/tricks and times of year a bit more on what you want to target and where would help folks chime in. This time of year can be great for walleye as they stage to spawn if you know where to go, you can be fancy with lipless cranks, $8 glow spoons etc...etc...but jigs and tail hooked minnows will get them too. Pike are everywhere here, a large live or dead bait can get you a monster, but so can an 1/32 crappie jig with a micro tube(honestly). Lake trout staples are white tube jigs, lipless cranks and some guys using larger bass plastic paddle tails recently having good success, important thing with trout is electronics, you can catch them without but in my experience you would miss a lot without a flasher/sonar. Crappie are biting all winter, I'd say now they really start to feed, too many variables with crappie to get into, but they are everywhere up here now and spreading. Whitefish are a real hoot too, try micro tubes, swedish pimple or cast master type spoons tipped with minnows, meegs or whatever , I've had big whitefish smack 4"" tube jigs while fishing for lakers, if they are feeding they can be very aggressive, otherwise you might need to tease them to bite, again....this is where electronics on the ice come into their own."
6303202,Bill Krejca,2019-03-23 08:04:00,6107,"Assuming cold isn't a deciding negative factor for going ice fishing, I'd guess a major determining situation holding folks back up north could be transportation. Without a snowmobile, or 4 wheeler, places off the beaten track become an inaccessible destination. Although many fishermen have boats, winter travel toys are much fewer in comparison. Also, need to factor in where to go, what is ""safe"" ice, and just plain winter savvy. Inexpensive availability of a machine, plus maybe a guide could perhaps open up to an increase in participants. I'm guessing the impracticability of same, plus operator know how, insurance factors,etc., will tend to limit current ice participants to a level similar to the present. Big water, of course, such as LOW, being a different situation, camps having transportation means and houses on the water. Bill"
6303224,stjoeguy,2019-03-23 08:27:00,979,"I agree with Bill. Transportation is the major problem. I'd love to ice fish NW Ontario but don't know of anywhere that doesn't require bringing your own snowmobile. I've got a snowmobile but not enough friends do to make a trip. In fact, I'm thinking of selling mine next winter since I didn't really use it this year. I did three ice fishing trips this winter, but they all involved either plowed roads, bombardiers or Snobears. If anyone knows of a NW Ontario ice fishing trip that includes transportation I'd love to hear about it."

6303474,Limeyangler,2019-03-24 07:54:00,563,"Yeah, transportation, that would be an issue for sure. i know the camp i do some stuff with is looking at doing guided trips with transportation in the future."
6303486,prov1800,2019-03-24 08:12:00,5010,Clarks has all the equipment needed if you don't have your own.Anishinabi lodge has 4 cabins in the middle of no where on a island only accessible by air or snowmobile.not just off some plowed road on the lake.This trip is a adventure.All ice huts are set up on all kinds of lakes for trout and walleye.untouched area with minimal activity.trips are guided in and out.
