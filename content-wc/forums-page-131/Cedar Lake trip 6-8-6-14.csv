I have been to Cedar a few times but have always stayed on the east side at Keystone. Unfortunately, they were booked this year so we are trying the west side. I'm looking for some help as I am going with four guys who have never fished Canada before and I want them to have a great time and make this a annual trip. I'm not looking for your secret spots but some areas to target to get us on fish and have a blast. Any help would be appreciated!"
