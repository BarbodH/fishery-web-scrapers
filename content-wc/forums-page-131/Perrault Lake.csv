6237446,BornToFish,2018-08-25 04:36:00,1224,"Greetings,I was fishing a lake not too far away from Perrault Lake the week before Chuck was on Perrault Lake. We also encountered several days with smoke/haze in the sky. In fact, we could smell smoke one day. The lodge owner stated that one day there was ash deposited on the surfaces of things.I found on two days that the haze/smoke helped establish a pattern for the walleyes. The sky was so hazy that the fish perceived the weather to be a cloudy day. Combining this phenomenon with waves and the walleyes moved quite shallow (for this time of the season) on off-shore rock humps. We were catching our walleyes near the tops of the rock humps in 12-15 fow.Chuck - how was the fishing on Perrault Lake? Do you prefer fishing in mid-August versus earlier in the season?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6237448,bearfvr13,2018-08-25 04:45:00,174,No sir!!! I think I'll stick to early season! Chuck
6237616,team walleye,2018-08-25 20:28:00,336,I have seen in posts from lodges on perrault that people are catching fish on the sandbar. I have fish d Oerrault many times and have never heard anyone refer to this. Where is this on the lake?
6237636,bearfvr13,2018-08-25 23:46:00,174,"I ""believe"" this is what they are referring to!! Chuck"
6237638,bearfvr13,2018-08-25 23:47:00,174,"Oops, forgot the picture!!"
6237662,BornToFish,2018-08-26 06:28:00,1224,"Greetings,Chuck nailed it in terms of showing the location of the Sand Bar. The ""inside"" of the Sand Bar has a massive weed bed that holds minnows and perch. It's the walleye's grocery store from when the weeds develop in earnest in mid to late June through autumn. The walleyes hang out during the day in the nearby deep water and go to the grocery store when it's dinner-time.It's important to recognize the danger of getting too close to shore on Sand Bar. There is a massive field of boulders near shore that has claimed many lower units for those that get too close. You will notice that the depth contour lines on the east side of the Sand Bar are quite compressed. It's steep! The depth of water under the boat can change 4-5 fow in the length of a boat.In contrast, the depth contour lines on the west side of the Sand Bar are spread apart quite a bit. That is, the west side of the Sand Bar is far more tapered.I almost always fished the east side of the Sand Bar, as I took advantage of Mother Nature congregating the fish for me. The walleyes on the west side of Sand Bar tend to be dispersed.The east side of Sand Bar transitions to the bottom of the lake main basin in about 42 fow. Sometimes, the walleyes spend their day at this transition depth. Other times, they suspend in the water column, often within a cast or two of the Sand Bar.I fished the Sand Bar by arriving about 60-90 minutes before dark, and picking a stretch of ""clean water"" to fish. I would backtroll in 25-30 fow, waiting for the walleyes to show up. I would then follow them up the slope as it became darker. The walleyes would often linger for a short while near the edge of the weeds, and then ""poof"" they were gone in the weeds for the remainder of the night.The morning bite was typically much shorter than the evening bite.The difference between catching fish on the Sand Bar and washing your jigs is BOAT CONTROL. Angler's that anchor or fail to move with the walleyes typically struggle to fish the Sand Bar.Sand Bar was once a very popular place to fish for walleyes on Perrault Lake. I remember times when there would be 15-20 boats lined up on Sand Bar - spread out over a mile of water. I sense that current lodge owners are not promoting this location on the lake as anglers often struggle when fishing Sand Bar in view of the importance of boat control.I have caught several thousands of walleyes on Sand Bar over the years. My wife caught two 30+ inch walleyes on Sand Bar. It's a very special place for both of us.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6237698,team walleye,2018-08-26 07:30:00,336,Thanks for the info guys. I have fished around the island before but never knew about this. I might have to give it a shot sometime.
6237726,BornToFish,2018-08-26 08:27:00,1224,"Greetings,In my opinion, the Sand Bar is a hinge-point to understanding the fishing on Perrault Lake. The central weed bed on top of Sand Bar is the key to it all as it holds minnows and perch all season. Northern pike are often found in the weed bed as well throughout the season. Anglers rarely fish this weed bed for pike - wind maybe?The east end of Sand Bar is interesting. As the Sand Bar approaches Hatfield Island, it melds into The Aquarium. This is a good place to pull spinner rigs in the early season (i.e. June). As you continue past The Aquarium, you will run into Shorelunch. This place holds fish from June through September. Shorelunch was a central element of my ""milk run"" for many years. The satellite hump off of Shorelunch should not be overlooked.The west end of Sand Bar is also interesting. The point where the Sand Bar returns to Hatfield Island on the west end is very near a small cove. The walleyes often sit in front of this cove (where the depth contour lines turn and follow the shore) for a week or two in the spring, waiting for the water to warm so they can make their way out to the Sand Bar. Some walleyes stay near the cove all season as the weeds in the cove are their grocery store.As you continue past the cove from the Sand Bar, you will come across the Rock Wall and then the Slot. It's a progression of events starting in the spring. The walleyes finish their spawn in Jackfish Bay and follow the shorelines to the Slot. They stay there for a while, then follow the Rock Wall to the Cove. They then make their way out onto the Sand Bar, where they stay until autumn.Sand Bar is a fascinating and rewarding place to fish throughout the season. Unfortunately, it's a difficult place for many angler to fish as precise boat control is normally critically important to fishing success on the Sand Bar. Many anglers get frustrated fishing the Sand Bar and move to other areas of the lake to fish.Many of my friends that continue to fish on Perrault Lake report that Sand Bar is seldom fished any more, at least not the way it was in years past. I don't know if this is because the lake has changed, maybe it's not being promoted or maybe there is nobody teaching how to fish it.It might be that Sand Bar will be re-discovered in the future. I remember an old saying that someone asked a bank robber in the 1930s as to why he robbed banks. This gangster reportedly answered ""because that it where the money is!"". Similarly, someone asked me years ago at the dock as to why I fished the Sand Bar. I replied ""because that is where the walleyes are!"". Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6241068,Black_Z28,2018-09-04 15:14:00,153,"My brother, dad and I just got back from a trip to PLC. We were there the 25-29. I'd say fishing was much better then expected considering the drastic weather change we had from Sat-Tuesday. Water temps in the low 70s then dropped to 68 by Tuesday evening. We actually had some of our best fishing right out in front of the lodge. Mainly in the evening though. Also, Frog Rock and Hetfield Island were productive. We tried fishing jigs and minnows, with little to no success, almost all fish were caught on a jig and crawler. Then we few others on jigging raps. We found most walleyes around the 22-25' area, and smallies in the 18-23' area. I couldn't believe how fat all the smallies were. This was our first time at Perrault Lake, and we'll be back for sure. We had a lot of fun and caught a lot of fish over the 4 days of fishing. Was also very impressed with the quality of fish as well. Next time we'll go in late June in hopes of catching some bigger fish."
6241076,Aspencreek,2018-09-04 15:35:00,2911,"Great to hear you at least caught some fish......BUT, I would rethink your plans of going back in June in hopes of catching ""bigger fish"" you may end up not catching many at all. Review the previous posts....you may be hitting the ""right time"" now, water is cooling and the big girls will be moving up into shallower water and putting on the feed bag for fall and winter. My business partner was up early June and caught 27 fish for the week, for the week!! That's not a bad week, that's a bad DAY on many of the other Lakes in the area. Yes, it may have been him, but many of the other posts confirm it. I have made several trips to the area in August, and I love this time of year for big fish hunting, just my 2 cents."
6241152,BornToFish,2018-09-04 18:23:00,1224,"Greetings,I am with Aspen with respect to his recent post. Fishing in June can be a hit or miss proposition. The bigger walleyes will be shallow for a short while after the spawn and then they are: gone. They might be here this afternoon, and a half mile away the next morning. Fishing in June can be a hit or miss proposition. Many anglers like the spring fishing as it tends to be fishing fairly shallow water. These anglers are accustomed to fishing near shore, seeing trees/rocks/points and such that they can relate to.Fishing in August and September is my favorite time of the year to fish. Mother Nature causes the fish to school up. I know where they all are when I can catch one walleye. This fishing is often away from shore and deep, which intimidates many anglers as they are out of their shallow-water comfort zone.All of my personal bests were caught in August and September.There are other posts about fishing on Perrault Lake on Walleye Central. I encourage Z28 and others to review the earlier posts on this thread and the other threads. I fished with my wife for two weeks on another lake this summer. We averaged over one hundred walleyes per day during these two weeks. We had ""bad"" days with around 60-70 walleyes and ""great"" days approaching 200 walleyes per day.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6241264,BornToFish,2018-09-05 07:01:00,1224,"Greetings,I gave further thought to my closing comment in my previous post. I believe that some readers might conclude that Perrault Lake has a ""poor"" walleye fishery. It doesn't. I firmly believe that Perrault Lake has a solid walleye fishery. I would like to explain my thoughts on this topic.I realized in my first few weeks of fishing on Perrault Lake that the walleye bite tends to be a classic dawn/dusk bite. In view of this recognition, my wife and I typically left the dock when the first rays of sunlight were breaking over the eastern horizon. The walleye bite typically faded for us around 7:30 a.m. - 8:00 a.m.. We would then go in and have breakfast. We commonly had fifteen to twenty walleyes to the net during the morning bite.The middle of the day was spent fishing for the other species of fish: perch, smallies, northern pike and muskies. In my opinion, this is the strength of Perrault Lake. There is always something biting! The angler just needs to figure out what is happening about him/her. Anglers pushing the daytime walleye bite on Perrault Lake are likely pounding square pegs into a round hole. Anglers can make it work, but it won't be pretty.We typically went out after supper each day and hit our walleye ""milk run"". With this information in hand, we would then decide on where to set up for the dusk bite, which typically started about 45-90 minutes before dark. We often caught another 15-20 walleyes during the evening bite.Thus, we would put about 30-40 walleyes in our boat during an ""average"" day on Perrault Lake. We were quite content with this fishing result, as we also put very nice fish of other species in the boat during the middle of the day.The difference between my walleye fishing on Perrault Lake versus the lakes that I am now fishing is the daytime bite. I believe that Perrault Lake's relatively clear water contributes to the challenging daytime walleye bite. The lakes that I am now fishing have considerable tannin stain in the water. Thus, the walleye bite commonly lasts all day long and is often at its peak during the middle of the day. This is how we put up the numbers of fish caught reported in my earlier post.Perrault Lake has a solid walleye fishery. It also has solid fisheries for perch, smallies, northern pike and muskies. The successful angler on Perrault Lake recognizes that the bite changes throughout the course of the day, and focuses on what is biting at any given point in time throughout the day. It didn't matter to us what species of fish was bending our fishing rods. We simply wanted our fishing rods to be bent.In my opinion, Perrault Lake is a fabulous all-purpose lake to fish! A key to fishing success on this lake is to go with the flow by targeting what is biting at the time.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6241384,Bullman,2018-09-05 13:21:00,17,"Born to Fish, I personally do not fish Perrault Lake, but Wabaskang, which is a couple of miles down the river from it. Still connected. I've had the lake flies there many times and last year on Lac Seul we also ran into them, but found another area of the lake where they were not boiling on the surface and still did excellent. Also just something I learned the past trip is to listen to the Camp Owner. I was sticking to using Gulp and my catch numbers were not very good on Lac Seul. The owner informed me that Gulp does not work very well there and to try minnows. It was lights out once I switched over. Kept going back and tried the two side by side and had five fish on the minnow to everyone I got on a Gulp. Now on Wabaskang we hammered the walleye on Gulp and never bought a minnow on any trip. Guess each lake is slightly different."
6241442,Black_Z28,2018-09-05 14:53:00,153,"BTF, thank you for your insight. It's appreciated on my end. I do understand all of your points regarding fishing in mid/late June, as it could be a crap shoot. But, you never know about Late Aug/Sept. Heck, we had middle 80s Saturday, the day we arrived, then it was in the middle 50s Monday. Honestly, I was just happy my party all caught a pleasant amount of fish each. I finally was able to get my brother and dad on a fishing trip together. It had been since 2002, so it was a long time coming. Last year, only my brother could come, and able to get the old man along with. So, I'm glad they at least got to feel another jerk at the other end of the rod. I also really enjoyed the whole aspect of mapping around the lake, and finding new spots on a lake I've never been to. My dad always also very impressed with how SI works, and when I said drop them guys, and he actually did drop them, that there was a bite soon after. He'd never really seen something like that before, or just never experience someone that uses electronics in the way I do. Which most guys do, he's just old school, cripes he's almost 70, so it was good to get him in the boat. Anyways, I'm still up in the air on when we'll go, and even where. I've also heavily consider going to Wabaskang. I've heard great things from that lake, as far as numbers. And, that might be a better fit for my dad and brother who do not fish as much as I do. I'd rather go for much larger fish, and catch fewer, I think numbers are important to them. I wanted to do some deeper vertical jigging for larger walleye, but it was a no go. I found a couple large schools of big marks in about 45' of water, suspended at about 35'. Would have been fun to try and wrangle into one to see what they were. Anyways, again, I really do appreciate your help BTF. I'll keep it in mind for next year."
6241606,Bullman,2018-09-06 05:13:00,17,"Z28, Wabby is known for numbers. Not a lot of large fish caught (>25) so if you want to catch numbers of large fish this may not be the best place. Green Bay would be your best bet in July and August for numbers of large fish. Many times difficult to get fish under 23 inches out there. Best of luck to you where ever you decide on. I will recommend Peffley's Camp, but if your father has issues with stairs, this may not be the best camp."
6241668,BornToFish,2018-09-06 07:50:00,1224,"Greetings,Aspen: there is no doubt that fishing on Perrault Lake caused me to become a much better angler. I learned something every week that I was on the lake! The lake is always teaching something for those that are paying attention. I very much like getting together with other knowledgeable anglers to talk about fishing, as it seems that I am always thinking about fishing in some way, shape or form. I learn quite a lot in such discussions. You never know, we might get together to talk fishing some day.Bullman: having a lodge owner that understands the body of water and fishes is a definite plus for all guests. I am fortunate to have such a lodge owner as he is one of my fishing mentors.I observed over the years that GULP type products work well for me in horizontal presentations. The fish needs to strike now, or the lure will be gone in a few moments. The fish have no time to think about it. On the other hand, GULP type products routinely were out-fished by live bait when using vertical presentations. It seems that the walleyes just have too much time to study the presentation and think about it. I keep some GULP type products in the boat for back-up, just in case I run out of live bait.Z28: the business of life is making memories. A day will come when you and your brother will be glad to have the memories from your trip to Perrault Lake.You mentioned that you marked some relatively big fish on your sonar unit that were 35 feet down in 45 feet of water. My guess is that those were whitefish, as the thermocline was likely at about 22-24 fow.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6241826,Bullman,2018-09-06 14:45:00,17,"Born to Fish, Excellent observation regarding presentation. When catching most of the fish on Wabaskang it was a cast and retrieve method. On Lac Seul it was almost 100% vertical presentation. Something to remember for future trips."
6242320,port1042,2018-09-08 06:22:00,509,"We returned from Perrault Lake last night after a great week at Manotak. A little breezy and cool in the morning but otherwise almost perfect weather. Fishing was great! The walleye bite was on with all sizes of fish including 3 at this weeks best of 26"". A friend caught a 34"" which was previously reported. Found walleye at 32 feet and that stayed consistent throughout the week. Northern bite was very good. Nothing record setting but Earl fileted a nice batch of 22"" to 26"" fish for us. Perch bite was good mostly in Rainy (Spandia) Lake. Entry to the lake is very shallow and care is required to get in. It appeared to me that the lake was probably 18"" low from what I consider normal. Water temp held from 62 to 65 and dropping with cooler weather at the end of the week. Smallmouth were a little tuff to find but we caught several in the 17""-18"" range. We're scheduled back Memorial Day week. It will be a long winters wait."
6298012,Graveyard,2019-03-10 10:10:00,2,Z28.. I have fished Perrault Lake spring and fall for many years and have done great both times of the season. But if I had to pick one time of the year to go it would be in the spring. Not saying fall isn't great but I have had better luck with bigger fish in the spring. You just need to stay one step ahead of everyone else to get the big girls!! That being said I try not to fish where everybody else is fishing. And I've had great success with that.

6241286,BornToFish,2018-09-05 08:18:00,1224,"Greetings,I was thinking about Z28's potential interest in switching from August to June when fishing on Perrault Lake. I will offer some comments based on my experience fishing during June. I first note that it's important for anglers to select a lake with good populations of fish that the anglers want to catch. As I discussed in my previous post, Perrault Lake is such a lake. The fish in such lakes eat about every day, no matter what else is going on. Where and how anglers target these fish changes throughout the season. Locations and presentations for one particular point in the season may or may not be relevant to other points in the season.It might be that June is a better fit for Z28 given his temperament as an angler. If so, a switch from late August to June will require a big shift in locations to fish and fishing techniques. The weather in NW Ontario can be fickle during early June. Winds, storms and cold fronts can be particularly problematic during early June. The fishing can be up or down in response to unstable weather patterns. Thus, I would be looking at middle to end of June.I fished during the middle of June in 2012. We had a good ""big walleye"" pattern going for several days, likely as a result of a steady weather pattern featuring several consecutive days of wind from the south west. We casted crank baits along the stretch of shoreline running from the inside/outside turn to Snakepit. We kept the boat about one cast length from shore, such that we could cast our lures nearly onto shore. The boat operator had to be vigilant to keep the boat from drifting onto shore!We did not put up numbers of fish with this pattern. However, the walleyes that we caught would not have fit into a frypan! It's also worth noting that we suffered many bite-offs of pricey lures from northern pike. The thermocline is typically setting up during the middle of June. Thus, bigger northern pike will be transitioning to shallow, off-shore rock humps.Weed development begins in earnest during the middle of June. These emerging weeds are magnets to perch and predators. Seasons with fairly well-developed weeds in mid-June can offer tremendous musky fishing during the opening week of the musky season.The top-water smallie bite along shorelines typically gets going in later June and continues through the first week or so of July. The small mouth bass fishery in Perrault Lake is phenomenal! This top-water bite alone is worth the price of admission.I hope the above comments are helpful to Z28 such that he can make an informed choice as to when his group fishes Perrault Lake. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6241322,Bullman,2018-09-05 10:27:00,17,One other thing to take into account when fishing the second half of June is the fly hatch. This completely changes the feeding area and mood of the fish. Watching walleye feeding on the surface slurping mayflies is a major change from fishing them on the bottom. You can still catch some but numbers will be down considerably. I've had the hatch as early as June 20th and as late as July 4th. Each lake is different and also different areas of the lake can have different hatches. Catch your trip at a peak time and you will struggle without making adjustments in your technique. There are always smallmouths and northerns to deal with as well as perch. They were are saviors during a number of our trips.
6241328,BornToFish,2018-09-05 10:41:00,1224,"Greetings,Bullman: your add-on comments about fishing on Perrault Lake during June were spot on! Many thanks for your insights.My wife and I fish other lakes in the area during early July. We are fortunate that the May Flies have little presence on these lakes. They have virtually no effect on the fishing. Thus, I didn't even think of them when commenting on fishing during June on Perrault Lake.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6241356,Aspencreek,2018-09-05 12:17:00,2911,"BTF....your comments and observations are why it is called ""fishing"", not ""catching"". Nice job! It would be a pleasure to sit down some evening on the shores of Lac Seul and discuss the tactics, weather patterns, structure, wind and temps that make this a great sport. Gotta make this happen some time soon."
6239448,jsmyers,2018-08-30 10:38:00,198,"Thank you. This is fascinating and very appreciated.I wonder how much of the productivity of the spot is due to the weeds as a ""grocery store,"" and how much is actually the bar intercepting open water ciscos.I would think it was both, kinda like the fish are hanging out on the park bench between the grocery store and the steakhouse."
6239468,BornToFish,2018-08-30 11:29:00,1224,"Greetings,JS: I'm pretty sure that your comment about the walleyes hanging out between ciscoes and the grocery store is entirely relevant. I'm sure that walleyes are using water temperature as a key to play between ciscoes and weeds (i.e. perch and minnows).I've experienced warm weather years when the walleyes seemed to be out in the abyss chasing ciscoes. It was tough to catch walleyes relating to structure. I've also experienced cool weather years when the walleyes seemed to be relating structure on a regular basis.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6239514,BreezyPoint,2018-08-30 13:36:00,1581,"We have a term for this...fishing the abyssal plain. We caught a couple of amazing walleyes this year moving from one spot to the next. We just left the shallow running crankbaits out and these fish hit 6 feet down over a 24 foot flat, featureless bottom. I have often seen fish suspended like that but never really could catch them. Now I know. The two fish were 27.5 and 28.5 inch walleyes. A few years ago I got a 47 muskie fishing the abyssal plain.Frank"
6239728,BornToFish,2018-08-31 06:22:00,1224,"Greetings,Good morning Breezy. Your post caused me to think quite some time about the term ""abyssal plain"". I know that I heard that term used somewhere before. Was it used in the movie Hunt for Red October? If not, I am at a loss as to where I previously heard that term.I've noticed over the many years that there are times when the bigger walleyes go away from structure. That is, there are years when it seems that only small ""eater"" size walleyes are caught on or near structure. I presumed that the big girls were in the abyss chasing ciscoes. It seemed that this observation coincided with years with warmer lake water.In those situations, it seems that its pretty tough to really pattern the big walleyes as they can be anywhere - they are just following schools of ciscoes. Electronics will be helpful in narrowing the field to be searched, but still lots of water needs to be filtered to find them. The use of one fishing line per angler makes patterning (e.g. depth, profile, color, speed) the fish tough.I have on a handful of occasions been able to do okay on these suspended walleyes. I've witnessed evenings when the ciscoes were jumping from the surface over deep water. I suspected that somebody was chasing these ciscoes. I just casted silver spoons or minnow baits into the foray. We didn't catch numbers, but the size was great!Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I don't remember him saying anything about a missing pectoral fin though. I wonder if it is the same fish, just four inches longer?

6238182,bigdaddyguns,2018-08-27 11:03:00,608,"My experience with the ""sandbar"" is similar to BTF with some exceptions. I prefer the west side as it has exposure to the deeper water basin. We have caught some nice northerns on that deeper edge. I like to work the sandbar from 30' and work back the weedline looking for fish. We have also caught some tank smallmouths on the weedline line and generally walleye in between. I start around 6PM or so and it may take 30-60 minutes to find fish. If we don't get into any fish to show by then I move to other spots. One thing i have found is if you mark walleye at the sandbar, they are to eat and are usually catchable. That being said the walleye there are hit or miss for me. I have not found any real pattern to external weather conditions to fishing success. On days that conditions seem favorable it can be a bust and vice versa. Also BTF is right on about being nimble on the sandbar. As the walleye tend to be actively feeding I assume they are moving about and are mobile. You need to move about and be mobile too once the action may slows down a bit. Another reason I like the sandbar is it's a relatively easy piece of structure to fish for inexperienced anglers. When my boys were younger it was a nice place to get them on fish where we could relax watch the sunset have some consistent action and maybe get a few doubles or an occasional triple before heading in for the evening. Great memories!"
6213250,Mojo-NC,2018-06-25 10:49:00,1929,"What is it about Perrault Lake that causes it to get so much attention on this site? Other than LOTW and Lac Seul, I probably see Perrault more than any other lake. I've heard some good things about it, but I've also seen posts where guys had a really difficult time finding fish on the lake. One guy last season struggled for an entire week and hardly caught anything. I also watched Angling Edge where they caught some seriously high quality fish. Is it a lake where once you get 'em dialed in, you can really do well but it's not a lake for a beginner? I don't know of any other Canadian lake where fish can't be caught by any level of experienced angler."
6213294,BornToFish,2018-06-25 12:05:00,1224,"Greetings,I read this thread with interest. The previous post caused me to share some thoughts. I have about sixty weeks of experience fishing on Perrault Lake. Thus, I believe that I have a fair understanding of this lake.Perrault Lake is a ""fairly"" type of lake; fairly large, fairly deep, and fairly cold. Perrault Lake has good populations of musky, northern pike, walleyes, smallmouth bass and perch. Crappies are making their way down the river from Cedar Lake. Perrault Lake is a great multi-species fishery. Unfortunately, it does not have lake trout. Perrault Lake gave me a huge serving of ""humble pie"" the first season that I fished it. As I look back on my time on this lake, three factors played large roles in me becoming a successful fisherman on this lake. The first factor was understanding the seasonal movement of the species of fish in the lake. I then had to apply these seasonal movements to this particular lake. Application of this understanding to Perrault Lake definitely took some time. The benefit of doing this was that I was then able to narrow down parts of the lake that might be holding any given species of fish at any given point in the season.Second, there is a lot of structure (e.g. rock humps, wood, weeds, sand bars, reefs) in the lake. Knowing where the structure is located is a key to successful fishing on this lake during most of the fishing season. Learning the location of this structure also took considerable time.The third factor was reinventing myself as a fisherman in order to fine tune my angling game for fishing on Canada Shield lakes in general, and specifically Perrault Lake. The techniques and equipment that served me well in my youth weren't getting it done for me when I started fishing on Perrault Lake many years ago. I needed to develop fishing techniques and strategies that were new to me, as well as acquiring new fishing equipment.I saw a vision during my first week of fishing on Perrault lake that allowed me to see my future when fishing on Perrault Lake, and other lakes in NW Ontario. That vision motivated me to rise to the challenges discussed above. The previous post asked the following question: ""Is it a lake where once you get 'em dialed in, you can really do well but it's not a lake for a beginner?"" I will let the reader be the judge of the answer to this question about Perrault Lake. The same question might be asked about other lakes in NW Ontario.I have many fond memories of fishing on Perrault Lake. I believe that it is a truly fabulous lake.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6213374,Mojo-NC,2018-06-25 14:21:00,1929,"Born to Fish, well said - I agree with everything you stated. Each time we fish our lake, we have a similar experience. Now we go right to 1 of about 12 major spots on the lake depending on wind and lake conditions and are continually looking for new spots. I think I would advise anyone who is going to fish Perrault to study this map (attached link) well in advance of their visit. I don't know if this topographical information was previously available for Perrault or not. The lake we usually fish was not previously mapped, that is until this year. We couldn't have been happier. We even made up names and numbered a bunch of our spots on the map and then had the map laminated. When we studied the map carefully, the contour lines helped to explain why we had previously caught fish where we did. We also discovered a few other new places by looking for contour changes that were similar to those where we previously caught fish. Good luck and tight lines!https://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=e...key=cb~qHpqhwP"
6213376,JimBauch,2018-06-25 14:21:00,5,Yeah. We watched that before we went!
6213624,rockape,2018-06-26 07:05:00,215,"In my opinion and what many others have said is that Cedar (the lake south of Perrault) is a better option. I have heard that the lodges on Perrault are on the west side and the better fishing is on the east side. You get the wind blowing the wrong way, and it could be a nasty boat ride. You can always find cover on Cedar if it is windy. I have caught a ton of musky on Cedar and many big walleyes. Cedar and Perrault are connected by a narrow river, so you can fish both regardless of where you stay. Hit the south side of the island in ""Times Square"" on the north end of Cedar, and you won't be disappointed!"
6213878,Aspencreek,2018-06-26 16:22:00,2911,"FYI....my partner (in business) just came back from Perrault. He said fishing was TOUGH, but blamed it on the hot weather. Surface water temps were 75-77 F all week. He caught 27 walleye all week, ALL week total. Now I have never fished that lake (I fish LS) but is that normal sometimes? Now that said, he fished with his brother who is a JIG & Minnow only guy, and will not try any new tactics, and when you are in his boat that is what you are going to do. He and I would NOT be a good pair, if I'm not catching I'm changing to some other tactic, backtroll, lindy rig, slip-bobber, cast and blast, anything!!! I asked him if he tried leeches and said he caught 1 on a leech, but they only had a few that they borrowed from another group at camp, and they had no crawlers. But my goodness, 27 for the week!! Maybe they need to hire Pro V for a day or 2."
6213980,team walleye,2018-06-26 21:09:00,336,That's about 20 more then a lot of groups that went there last year.

6233122,sledman77,2018-08-14 08:55:00,19,"Just got back we did well in the beginning of last week, Wed. was our best day wife & I boated at least 20 eyes that day and numerous small mouths..Thursday and Friday was tougher it got hotter and the fish moved form the spots we were fishing.. The water temp was around 70 degrees (surface) the small mouths bite was good all week and a lot of fun. The eyes were mainly hitting on minnows with a jig when we left. A few cabinsdid very well on Perch in Spadina and Jackfish bay...Hope that helps a little good luck...."
6202960,JimBauch,2018-06-01 10:25:00,5,"hi guys - new to the forum - we are heading to Perrrault Lake next week, and was hoping for some helpful hints on northerns / muskys. My buddy is a big walleye fan, and I like the others. I hear Cedar is better for musky. Thanks and Good luck. Jim"
6202992,prov1800,2018-06-01 11:50:00,5010,I wouldn't say cedar is better.its just cedar has more good habitat than perrault does.perrault has larger open areas as compared to cedar.but if your new your week will be mostly a learning experience including walleyes.maybe take a guide out for a day or just have fun learning on your own.its all about the experience and relaxing.but perrault does hold good pike and muskies. Gets busy on cedar to as a lot of people travell there from perrault.two good bodies of water.
6203008,port1042,2018-06-01 12:09:00,509,"I'm at Perrault now and leaving in the morning. It started out hot and calm and the fishing was a little slow. Then the temps dropped and the wind started blowing and the fish turned on. This is a wonderful lake. Hot temps over the past couple of weeks have got the walleye moving to deeper water and they are hitting minnows better than crawlers. We did real well with pike. Try Jackfish Bay (avoid the sanctuary area) and ""the meat hole"". Spandia Lake has been good and the crappies are abundant in the Ord but I think that spawn is nearly over. Have a good week and we'll be back Labor Day week."
6203012,Indywest1,2018-06-01 12:33:00,7,"We've fished Perrault numerous times over the years - you'll have a blast. Last year we caught a 38"" northern in College Bay and traditionally we've had luck trolling around East Bay, both sides of the entrance to Spadina. Grassy Bay has also produced some big northern and muskies in years past. FWIW, we never had as much luck on the north side of the lake."
6203038,JimBauch,2018-06-01 13:35:00,5,Thanks for the replies!! Coming from Iowa. I appreciate the info!
6203078,Thumpr50,2018-06-01 15:00:00,139,"Just an FYI, be sure to check the regulations, muskie season in Ontario doesn't open until the 3rd Saturday in June...."

6212576,team walleye,2018-06-23 20:38:00,336,Where at in a iowa are you from? Ames here. I have fished Perrault every other June since 2003. Love the are and lake.
6212650,JimBauch,2018-06-24 08:14:00,5,"I live in Stuart. We found a few nice walleyes but only in one spot. Marked others. Couldn’t get them to bite. Caught small northerns in Spadina, and Nelson lake. Had a few musky follows. None caught. I’m thinking we went to early in the summer. Maybe later when there is more vegetation would be better."
