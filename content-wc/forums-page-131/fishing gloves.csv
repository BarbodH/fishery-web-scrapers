6299432,bushead11,2019-03-13 13:32:00,151,HA! It was more for the runs in the rain/sleet between spots. Hands get pretty cold pretty quick when they are wet and moving at 25mph.
6299442,Golden Eagle,2019-03-13 14:14:00,2642,"Pike need their protective slime. Better yet, release them while in the water, in the net. Don't take them from the water. Have camera ready and lower the net for escape. Polarized lens on camera will give you a great photo as she swims away. Leave camera running for a few seconds after you can't see the fish. Camera sees better than you. Talk to her as she swims off. Makes for a great, short movie."
6299450,Bakefish,2019-03-13 14:35:00,1077,"I hate wearing gloves while fishing, but if it's a must I wear the brown jersey gloves until they are too wet and then I change to another pair. When my hands get too cold I just go back to the cabin. I'm just not that angry at those fish as I get older."
6299466,camp chef,2019-03-13 15:23:00,915,The best fishing gloves I have found for handling fish and all kinds of weather are actually made for football . I have a friend that played tight end for the Wisconsin Badgers. I got some of his used gloves made by Under Armor. They work great in and out of the water.
6299470,Duflebag,2019-03-13 15:35:00,218,I use these Pelagic gloves i bought from Amazon. They are good for cold days and protect from gill rakers and tooth punctures. I like them especially for green fish that thrash all over where you end up with cuts you have no idea how they happened.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...?ie=UTF8&psc=1
6300570,camp chef,2019-03-16 07:36:00,915,Those are very similar to the football gloves I use
6301608,Moosebunk,2019-03-19 06:56:00,211,Any cotton glove or rubber bottomed glove will do. No need to break the bank.
6301830,djcoop52,2019-03-19 18:46:00,1411,I second the Lindy gloves only time I use them is with a big pike but they work and grip great. Probably wear them next time I get a striper to last one tore me up with the end of his gill plate.
6219536,hugepike0,2018-07-10 09:08:00,28,So I am going fishing on Knee Lake (hoping to catch lots of pike) and have a new guy that isnt used to handling pike at all. Looking for suggestions on a fish handling glove that would be good for both he and the fish until he gets more confident. Hate to see his hands get all cut up - thanks for any input!!
6219572,maddogg,2018-07-10 10:03:00,178,Try these or get the Rapala ones which are a little expensive but work great.https://www.amazon.com/Resistant-Shu...HF93H95ERDQPGM
6220020,Bassmandpe,2018-07-11 09:00:00,42,Saw this on TV show Fishing the Wild West with a segment from Black bear Lake in Sask. It is called the Amazing Fish Lifter. Got it on Amazon and it works great. Plastic tool that fits in the Pike to take all the stress off the fish and gives you complete control of the fish. Once done taking photos release the fish with ease back into the water. Took a couple to a recent trip to Sioux Lookout in May and buddy who is a Guide there said this tool was the best thing he has ever seen for handling big fish.
6220424,Larry S,2018-07-12 06:58:00,665,Go to Lowes or Home depot and buy blue garden gloves for $6 or so they work great for handling pike!
6220438,andersaki,2018-07-12 07:08:00,1426,"Lindy fishing glove. At 29.95 it's a little expensive, but excellent protection from spiny, toothy critters and sharp knives. andersaki"
6220552,bthomas3333,2018-07-12 11:08:00,465,"I am not a huge fan of the gloves as I think I drop more fish with them on, but I can say they saved me a nasty cut in June. The guide insisted I wear his Lindy glove to handle and release a big pike. I literally have never used gloves with pike before but in this case as I was releasing the fish my index finger got clamped down on by the pike. It would've been a really bad bite as I could feel the teeth, but not a single tooth got through the gloves. For an inexperienced fish handler they might be a good choice.B-"
6220582,big popi,2018-07-12 11:49:00,635,has anyone used the Inf-Way or similar gloves? They look intriguing as they should put on & come off easily. I use a glove when taking fish out of the livewell & this looks like it could be the trick.http://www.inf-way.com/en/web/pro.asp?id=862
6220606,Obabikon,2018-07-12 13:14:00,2370,"For the record... I refer to these as ""Princess Gloves"", but I don't think you can go wrong with a pair of leather work gloves. They're tougher and easier to clean. It doesnt' really matter if they stay damp."
6299422,bushead11,2019-03-13 13:15:00,151,not trying to change the topic but wondering if any of the glove wearers have any suggestions for a good pair of waterproof fishing gloves for us poor guys that have to work the tiller motor in 30-50 degree days while its raining...
6299430,Bakefish,2019-03-13 13:29:00,1077,"You are running the boat. It's you that determines if your passenger is put in the fish zone, or 16 feet away from it. Require your passenger to remove all of your fish from your hook if he wants to catch any of his own. This way you can wear some nice thermal gloves and keep toasty. Win-win."
