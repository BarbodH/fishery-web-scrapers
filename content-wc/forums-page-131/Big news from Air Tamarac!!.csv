5529322,Seanik,2017-05-08 08:10:00,218,"I have booked A June fishing trip to Lac Natakim, Quebec in the Moselle Territory formally owned by Air Melacon. I read Andre's(Wallyandre) post this morning stating that Air Tamarac now owned the Moselle Territory, I immediately called Gina Tremblay the manager of the Moselle territory and she emphatically said "" Air Tamarac does not own The Moselle Territory but they will do all the flights, the territory is owned by a private individual. Air Tamarac is a first class operation as is the operator of the Moselle territory, Air Tamarac bought only the Sauterelle territory from Air Melacon.Hunter11,I was at Lac Vimont in the Moselle Territory 3 years ago, a great numbers lake for medium size walleyes. The lake is only about 2 1/2 miles in length and could get a bit boring after about 7 days on it. There is a caretaker that brings fresh spring water daily and has communications with the air base.Seanik"

Air Tamarac, an outfitter out of Clova, Qc specialized in walleye and pike fishing announces that it has acquired Air Melançon from Ste-Anne-du-Lac. Thus, Air Tamarac acquires a seaplane base in the Mont-Laurier region and will offer its existing customers this option as a boarding point near an asphalt road, in addition to providing service to Air Melançon established clientele. Through this acquisition, Air Tamarac takes control of Pourvoirie Sauterelle, a territory with exclusive hunting and fishing rights located south of Clova and accessible only by seaplane in 30 minutes from Ste- Anne-du-Lac. Air Tamarac is therefore taking a turn in its services by adding speckled trout fishing, moose hunting in the fall and spring bear hunting. Sauterelle Lake is 7 km long and is part of a chain of lakes with 3 chalets on the main lake and 2 others on isolated lakes. This territory with exclusive rights of 60 km2 has been well preserved by the Melançon Family over the last few decades and, faithful to its reputation, Air Tamarac intends to respect its quality standards and offer it to you in top condition. The transaction also allows Air Tamarac to add two De Havilland Beaver seaplanes to its existing fleet of 4 aircraft and ensure reliable and safe service at each of its bases. The expansion of the activities of Air Tamarac allows it to become a must for avid outdoorsmen and to remain a leader in hunting and fishing in Quebec for several years to come; this achievement at Air Tamarac having been planned in concert with our next generation !
