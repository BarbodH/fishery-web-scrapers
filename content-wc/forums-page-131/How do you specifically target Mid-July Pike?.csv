6297800,andreindy,2019-03-09 19:34:00,308,"Novice question that I know can be influenced by quite a few variables. We are headed back for the second time to Abamasagi in Ontario mid-July (13-20th). I often see posts about early season pike fishing but how do some of you specifically target pike in mid-July? My group probably does not have the experience or adaptability to adjust between LOTS of the varying techniques, but what might be a top 5 locations/rules/techniques/lures to teach the group for that time of year? If it helps, the surface water temp on lots of my notes throughout that week shows about 69 to 72F. I really appreciate your thoughts."
6297846,adempsey2.0,2019-03-09 22:40:00,611,"Just outside of the bays that have rivers/creeks entering the lake and deep (20+ feet) water nearby. Start in 6-8 feet and move out to 40 feet. Target the 8 to 15 foot range over deeper water. Troll or cast, as long as you reach the target depth. Current areas will also be good. Walleye are there and so will the pike. Plenty of nice looking neck down areas on Abamasagi. The NE section has some nice looking spots as well near the islands. Don't stay in one spot more than 10-20 minutes unless you have a follow or catch a nice fish. Deep (12+ feet) cabbage weeds will always be a good location. Fishing shallow weeds and bays will get you plenty of smaller males as well."
6297890,BornToFish,2019-03-10 07:06:00,1224,"Greetings,Adempsey summarized it very succinctly: ""Walleye are there and so will the pike."".I have worked a pattern for many years based on Adempsey's comment that has produced BIG TIME for me. As the water warms in late spring and early summer, many lakes develop a thermocline. If so, many of the northern pike will follow the developing thermocline away from shore, likely following baitfish. They will cruise around the abyss until they encounter structure. They will likely remain there throughout the season, until the thermocline breaks down.The structure that I am referring to is the same structure that anglers target for walleyes during summer. I go to these structural elements (e.g. rock humps, deep end of reefs or points) and get upwind about two to three cast lengths. I cast any big profile lure that will get down about ten feet in the water column as I drift across the structure. I continue casting until I am downwind of the structure about two to three casts. Most of my catches have been from 20 or so fow on the upwind side of the rock hump.The pike will likely be just above the thermocline. They see the lure silhouetted against the surface of the water and come un-glued. The strikes can be a subtle tick if thy overtake the lure from behind. Alternatively, the strike can be absolutely savage if they T-bone the lure. I most often work this pattern during the middle of the day. I can drift a rock hump with this pattern and get nothing. I could come back to the rock hump a few hours later and catch six. The approach that I outlined above targets the biggest pike the system has to offer. It seems as though little pike know better than to reside in these areas. If the walleyes stop biting, there is a good chance pike are passing by!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6298022,andreindy,2019-03-10 10:26:00,308,"Thank you both. So if I wanted to keep it simple (for a simple group) and the group says ""Let's try for some pike"", could I go wrong by: 1. Simply tossing them a Dr. Spoon with a twister trailer to cast out and let sink for varying amounts of time (depending upon depth) in location types you both mentioned. 2. Consider something for them to slow or fast troll (spoon, spinnerbait, crank bait?) that can get down about 10 feet around the edges of deeper rock humps, bay openings or deep weed line edges."
6298104,BornToFish,2019-03-10 12:42:00,1224,"Greetings, I fished a lake in NW Ontario that has a good population of northern pike. The pike were clearly on the rock humps by about the third week of June. I know they were still there in mid to late September. I used to fish for northern pike by casting the weed beds and edges of weed beds. I grew frustrated with this as I seldom caught decent northern pike. I would catch lots of pike in the mid-20 inch range, but seldom anything bigger. Out of curiosity, I tried casting some rock humps in the middle of the lake. It didn't take long for me to become a believer! As I mentioned in the earlier post, I believe that anything with a big profile will work. The pike will be cruising around at about 20 feet in the water column. They will see the lure silhouetted against the surface. If they are in the mood, they will crush it. I worked this pattern for many years throwing a regular size Bull Dawg. Often times, the entire Bull Dawg and most of the leader would be inside the fish's mouth and throat. I think that a Dr. Spoon would work great so long as it's kept around 10-12 feet down in the water column and moved slow enough to keep it there. A rubber trailer would be good, so long as it does not kill the ""wobble"" on the spoon. It's hard for many people to grasp this pattern for northern pike. Tell me again, why would I be casting a big lure when the boat is in 50 fow???? It seems that everyone wants to catch giant pike. However, many people find it daunting to remove hooks from big and toothy fish with a bad attitude. Be sure that the anglers in your group that want to target bigger pike have the confidence, know-how and tools to remove deeply embedded hooks. If not, I encourage you to NOT share this pattern with them. I'm not a troller, so can't speak to first hand experience on this aspect of pike fishing. However, I know many guys that troll for pike along weed edges and the first break with what I believe are called Rapala Rattlin' Raps - a lipless crankbait. They must do well with this approach as I see them doing this almost all day long. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6298112,adempsey2.0,2019-03-10 12:50:00,611,"Your plan sounds fine. Start with weed lines, especially cabbage in deeper water. I don't normally put a trailer on a spoon with a treble though. I would switch to a single hook or go with something like the Silver Minnow if you want to do that. Otherwise, a more flutter-type spoon like the Williams Whitefish is great for pause/retrieve/pause methods.If you troll shallower baits, like spoons or spinners, a larger profile should be beneficial if you are over deeper water. The larger spoons (Len Thompson No.4) and inline spinners with bucktails are great. Plenty of viable crankbait choices for trolling. I would also recommend using lipless crankbaits. You can troll or cast these. They work really well. Live Target Golden Shiner and Perch Rattlebaits are excelent as are the Bill Lewis Rattletrap/Supertrap. Paddletails with weighted jigs/swimbait hooks fish great like this too."
6298120,fldoc1,2019-03-10 13:05:00,69,"I have fished some pike waters in Manitoba mostly in early June so not the same pattern. In Manitoba I think they require barbless hooks and I switch out to a single barbless hook on all my casting spoons.. I use them anytime I cast for bigger northerns whether in Manitoba, Ontario or Minnesota and do not feel like I lose that many fish vs treble hooks. What I remember about one particular trip to Manitoba was pulling up to a boat that must have had problems getting hooks out of the northerns as there was blood everywhere. I can't remember if they were using bulldogs, but I do not like/use them due to the hook setup and affect on releasing the fish. My main go to lures are the Johnson spoon, the Dr. spoons, the 5 of diamonds and the Williams gold/silver pattern. I have the whitefish so will give it a try. Randy from Duluth"
6298272,BornToFish,2019-03-10 19:07:00,1224,"Greetings, Turkeyriver: I encourage you to give the pattern a try! A key is to NOT give up on it too soon. Like I said, I can drift a rock hump and get nothing. Then, come back in a couple of hours and get several. The rock humps that I fished for pike were the same ones that I targeted for walleyes in the morning. I've caught many dozens of pike with the above pattern. Very few of them were under 30 inches. Many of them were over 40 inches. Lots of them were in the upper 30 inches. Give it a try. You may be surprised! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6298288,chris.brock,2019-03-10 19:16:00,112,I've fished Abamasagi before. I'd start in these spots.
6298806,andreindy,2019-03-11 19:55:00,308,"Thank you Chris. And everyone else. I really do appreciate it. We have never specifically targeted pike, but I anticipate members of my family asking us to. And I, personally, have never targeted pike. At this stage, most of them are pretty dependent upon me."
6298902,BornToFish,2019-03-12 06:56:00,1224,"Greetings Andre, Your last comment caused me to see your situation in a somewhat different light. That is, at least some of the folks in your group may very well be novices. As such, they might be thrilled to simply have some ""rod bending"" going on, rather than targeting trophy northern pike - numbers versus size. You might consider locating some cabbage weed beds and fishing the deep edges with bucktails or spoons. The areas indicated in Chris' marked up map might be a great place to start for the weed beds! I often locate cabbage weed beds by looking in front of sections of shoreline with reeds. Casting the cabbage weed beds should show good numbers of ""eater"" size pike (eg. 20-25 inches) to bend the fishing rod. Larger pike might show up from time to time. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6299376,bigdaddyguns,2019-03-13 11:15:00,608,"I will vouch for BTF pike methods, they do work very well. One point to add more detail on is consideration for the type of baitfish/forage in the lake. If the lake has Ciscos and Whitefish you may want to start with the larger profile lures BTF mentioned in color patterns of silver, gold, and walleye. Also start with the deeper basin side of the reef and work over the top of the reef. Usually if the fish are there, the active ones will bite quickly. If the lake does not have a lot of basin dwelling forage you may need to be flexible in changing lure profiles and colors to match what they are feeding on."
6299912,andreindy,2019-03-14 17:35:00,308,"BTF, you are correct. The group is very novice and do not have the experience to adjust with higher levels of success. Our group is generally content with numbers. However, and inevitably, someone in the group will want to go after ""the big one"".

6298126,turkeyriver,2019-03-10 13:20:00,80,"We've caught enough accidental pike while walleye fishing mid lake humps to know they are there. What do you think about a floating crankbait tied to a three-way rig and slow trolling the edges of those humps. I've tried casting around the edges of the deep water and always felt that I wasn't getting deep enough. You're saying a large bait only halfway down will bring them up? I could spend a lot of time casting to get one big fish, but usually my boat partner wants to give up after 10 minutes!"
6298172,BornToFish,2019-03-10 15:42:00,1224,"Greetings, I stumbled across the rock hump pattern for bigger pike about ten years ago. As I mentioned in an earlier post on this thread, I was tired of catching small pike fishing weed patterns during July and August. I tried the rock humps and found the bigger pike there! As I mentioned, I believe the bigger pike in the system are spending their summers around the rock humps, in the general vicinity of the thermocline. These pike might be very tight to the side of the rock hump, or they may venture a cast or two away from the rock hump. They key is they will be in the vicinity of the thermocline. The pike probably venture higher on the rock humps from time to time in order to chase baitfish. For the lake that I was fishing when I came across the rock hump pattern, the thermocline generally set up around 20 to 24 feet down in the water column. This is why I said I found it important to get my lure to a depth of 10-12 in the water column - one half of the way down to the thermocline. If the pike wants it, he will come up to get the lure as it's only a tail kick or two away! I believe that another key to this pattern is a big profile lure that will get the pike's attention. The pike will see the silhouette of the lure against the surface of the water. The lure could be a jerk bait, a crankbait, a spoon or spinnerbait - so long as it will run about 10-12 feet down in the water column. Of course, you have to be mindful of hitting the bottom of the lake with your lure if you cast across the top of a shallow rock hump. As I mentioned earlier, I would start 2-3 cast lengths upwind of the rock hump and drift until I was about the same distance downwind of the rock hump. I often started and ended my drifts in 40+ fow, having passed over the top of the rock hump, say in 10 fow. I might get 10-15 casts at most during a drift. I would make a couple of drifts across a rock hump to see if the window was open at that time. I would know the window was open if I caught fish. If not, I would do something else and then check back in a few hours. It was common for me to strike out on a particular rock hump, then come back a few hours later and catch several nice fish on the same rock hump. My best fishing was often during the middle of the day. I am not a troller, but see no reason why trolling shouldn't produce fish. I would run my lures down 10 feet or so while keeping the boat in 20-25 fow or so as I worked the perimeter of the piece of structure. There are many musky lures or bigger walleye lures that should work for this application. The three-way idea should work as well. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6298202,turkeyriver,2019-03-10 16:43:00,80,Can't wait to try some new tactics this July!
