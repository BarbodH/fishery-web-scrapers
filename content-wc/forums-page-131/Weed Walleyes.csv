6295780,Ricky Spanish,2019-03-05 14:53:00,1298,"Same here. Beetle spin, twister or tube jig."
6296004,Bill Krejca,2019-03-06 07:11:00,6107,"Weed Weasel is OK, the reason I prefer my modified shad darts is because the flat front seems to impart a more noticeable side-to-side wiggle. Bill"
6297534,BornToFish,2019-03-09 09:42:00,1224,"Greetings, Fisherman Ted's comments about using Senko plastics in the weeds caught my attention. I was recently in a fishing tackle store. I was amazed by the array of Senko style soft plastics. I wasn't sure what to get. Fisherman Ted: what style and size of Senko worms do you use? How do you rig them? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6297640,Fisherman Ted,2019-03-09 14:20:00,461,Hey there. I like Smaller senkos. Specifically 4 inch. I find I get better hooksets than with 5 inches or even larger. If you can get away with wacky rigging them (in light weeds) that works quite well. But once we are in the weeds I rig them weedless AND weightless. Just let them flutter in and around the weed beds. Just like largemouth fishing. For color I love dark colors. Pumpkin. Watermelon. Purple. Etc. -FT
6297882,BornToFish,2019-03-10 06:53:00,1224,"Greetings, Fisherman Ted: I sincerely thank you for the prompt and detailed response. I am anxious to give your approach a try in July and August - when the weeds are up. Your comment about ""just like largemouth fishing"" is exactly what I have in mind. I will watch for some smaller size Senko's worms when I come across them in fishing tackle stores. I have a hunch your approach will be an excellent option when the wind is blowing or during cold fronts. Kindest regards....."
6299072,papadave,2019-03-12 12:58:00,151,"If it is windy try drifting a bottom bouncer with an 18"" leader and #2 aberdeene hook trailing it using a whole nightcrawler that's nose hooked. The bottom bouncer gathers/rips through the weeds but the hook rarely gets hung up. Starting in late July through August if the weeds run out to 10' - 15', a lot of times I will just run my outboard slowly all through the weeds until I find open areas with schools of walleye that are sitting still in the openings between weeds. You won't see individual fish on your finder but you will see large red blobs that will look different from the weeds. These schools can be massive when you find them and sometimes will be in the same general area all day long. If it is a calm sunny day and you can sit still without much of a drift you can free line a weightless hook with a nose hooked crawler into those areas. Once you get one walleye in a school to hit, it will trigger a feeding frenzy that can last for hours. If they stop hitting just toss out a couple crawlers as chum to get them started again. When these walleye are schooled in the weeds they are incredibly competitive with each other."
6294888,BCLII,2019-03-03 14:41:00,1823,"I look for the greenest of weeds/cabbage I can find as they will give off more oxygen for the bait fish to hold in. Then I use a 2-3' spinner leader on 10 lb. line with 6 red beads or color of choice and a 1/4 oz bullet weight on the main line above a snap swivel. Troll 1-1.5 mph with approximately 20-30' behind boat fishing inside turns & subtle points outside the weed line in 8-12 fow near deep water breaks. I like using a leech, 1/2 crawler, or soft plastics."
6294922,lunker99,2019-03-03 16:25:00,236,"When pitching to holes in the weeds as others have mentioned, I've texas rigged the twister on the jig head to reduce weed fouling. If you want to tip with live bait, put it on before burying the hook point back in the plastic."
6294928,Hwy 101,2019-03-03 16:47:00,33,This is something we came up with during a really bad cold front a couple of years ago. Natural colored tube with a gold or silver June Bug style spinner. It has since become my go to bait for walleye and smallmouth in the weeds. Last year we had several days of high winds and the walleye were stacked up in the cabbage in the backs of bays that had wind blowing in. With braided line you can feel the blade sinning and pop off any weeds that get hung up. The bite is very aggressive.
6295338,adempsey2.0,2019-03-04 15:49:00,611,"My local lakes have a lot of weed and weed oriented walleye. One method often used is to rip/punch through the weeds with a black/blue bucktail jig using a heavy rod with braid, or you can use a Walleye Killer rig which is basically a spinner harness with a bullet sinker (which was already mentioned)."
6295352,prov1800,2019-03-04 16:14:00,5010,I spend quite a bit of time weed fishing.have found that using seedless jigs works great.i use a buddy of mines jigs he makes (www.baitrigs.com)these jigs are awesome.vericle jig them or cast them out.they come back to the boat clean or with a fish on.also I buy vmc hooks that are seedless and tie them on a floura leader and leave a foot or two slack and put a split shot on where ever you feel it needs to be.its a drop shot rig.also vmc makes hooks on swivel little more money but zero line twist those hooks are also seedless.simplest way to fish weeds been doing that for years with great results.
6295510,BornToFish,2019-03-05 06:05:00,1224,"Greetings,Many sincere thanks to everyone for their excellent suggestions!I am now fishing some lakes in NW Ontario that have appreciable beds of cabbage weeds. I frequently cast these weed beds with spoons or bucktails/spinner baits for northern pike. There are days when I catch as many walleyes as I catch northern pike. I'm pretty sure these lakes have an appreciable population of walleyes that live in the weeds throughout the season.As Hwy 101 mentioned, I too encounter days with high winds. It can be difficult to find good places to fish on such days. Options are a good thing on such days. Targeting weed walleyes would be a good option to have available, especially on windy days. Thus, I started this thread.I've picked away at weed walleyes by fishing the inner/outer edges, pockets and running lures above the weeds. I never found a good way to root them out of the thicker weeds. I happened to watch a Lindner's Angling Edge show this past weekend. The subject of this episode was rooting large mouth bass out of the slop. They used a new product from VMC called the Tokyo rig. A picture of this rig is on Cabela's website:https://www.cabelas.com/product/VMC-...0.uts?slotId=0The rig is basically a variant of the Texas Rig. VMC recommends installing one or two tungsten worm weights on the wire shaft that extends from the welded ring. As FishermanTed suggested, a soft plastic is then installed on the worm hook with the point of the hook just under the surface of the plastic, such that it's a weed-less presentation.I'm thinking of making up some VMC-like Tokyo rigs. I will add a short section of wire between the welded ring and the swivel (line tie point) to act as a leader. I'm thinking that there will be no shortage of small pike that will be interested in the offering.For you folks that run Texas style rigs for walleyes, is there a type/brand/color/size of soft plastics that has worked well for you? Prov1800: I was unable to open the link to your buddy's jigs. Would you please describe the jig that you use?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6295518,prov1800,2019-03-05 06:22:00,5010,I did bring it up but try ebaits.com It's called a slow pork seedless.its under walleye jigs.

6295744,prov1800,2019-03-05 14:03:00,5010,That's them.just need to cut need to trim the brush down and spread it out.you can fish any weed bed with them. Thx for finding them.
6295760,Guest,2019-03-05 14:18:00,0,"Years ago, the regular Slo-Poke jig (same jighead as the slo-poke weedmaster without the weed guard) came pre-rigged, with a curly tail grub...rigged weedless Texas style....the long stem of the eyelet was poked through a 2"" grub, about a 1/4"" from the tip of the grub(same as rigging a worm Texas style) and the hook Texas rigged (hook buried in the body). The slo poke was known for its slow fall on the drop. An old favorite of mine!"
6294560,BornToFish,2019-03-02 12:28:00,1224,"Greetings, I often catch nice walleyes during summer evenings when I fish along the edges of weed beds. I'm referring to fishing in ca. ten to twelve feet of water along the edges of cabbage weed beds. I target the fish along these weed edges with crank baits or with jigs + live bait. I suspect that there are also nice walleyes in the weeds, maybe all day long. I haven't found an effective way to target these fish. My traditional approaches seem to catch more weeds as walleyes. For you folks that target weed walleyes, how do you go about it? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6294578,bthomas3333,2019-03-02 15:17:00,465,In my experience when I find walleyes relating to weeds in the evening I would look out a bit deeper still relating to soft bottom during the day. One spot in partial we call the icebox. During the day they are ~15ft over mud and in the evenings they slide up into 5-10 still over soft bottom with weeds. I know they are eating Perch based on their stomaches when I clean dinner.Definitely not a 'normal' pattern but I suspect they like the soft bottom due to water temp and easy food supply.Brett
6294620,Fisherman Ted,2019-03-02 18:39:00,461,On hot summer days I have found many walleye IN the weeds. Just stacked in there. Weedless plastics like Senkos do the trick. We just crush them. -FT
6294632,Limeyangler,2019-03-02 19:22:00,563,"I use slip bobbers a lot in the exact locations you mention. Use a jig and minnow/leach/worm under it. Advantage being you can hang the bait above short weeds, dangle the bait right on the outside of the edges or drop it into pockets in the thicker cabbage from distance without spooking fish. I've found it very effective and less hassle than trying to rip through weeds. Saying that ripping through the weeds will produce amazing reaction strikes too."
6294652,Guest,2019-03-02 22:05:00,0,"I have found alot of weed patches have holes in them or opening that weeds dont grow. Can be a few feet across to 10+ feet across. You have a weedless prop on your TM , so get in there. I naw my way in until i find a hole then either cast into the holes or drop a jig. When the weeds are a few feet from the surface i cast a shallow cranks past the holes and retrieve it. If the water is clear walleye will come up and smash the cranks. If i catch one or two i dont leave i just sit for about 5 minutes and try again. Works very well until the water murks up or the weeds fill in those holes. Stumbled on this years ago and its been a tried and true way i catch them every spring for a few weeks. And thats how you put more fish in the boat."
6294678,kzoofisher,2019-03-03 05:16:00,5144,"Agree with all the above. Sometimes the weeds can be too thick for much of anything but when they're not the suggested methods will work. Aside from what has been suggested you can try: Ripping fluke jigs along the bottom on the edges, including the inside edge. Takes a fairly heavy jig like at least 3/8 and the edge has to be well defined as well as well known but you don't have to be inches from it. Weed beds that stop at a bottom transition rather than petering out at depth are nice for this. Light, natural colors work best. It's a tiring way to fish and catches a bunch of species so if hooking bass and pike annoys you..... When the weeds top out a couple feet below the surface try in-line spinners. Trolling harnesses over weeds is a tried and true method, casting them works just as well. Changing out treble hooks for singles is helpful in keeping the spinners weed free. Those worm hooks with the barb or screw for attaching the plastic and rigging it weedless are nice but have to be done just so or it spins funny. Often you can see the spinner as you retrieve it and drop it into openings in the weeds. Seeing a fish rocket up and smack it is fun, too. The bass guys know a thing or two about thick weeds. Heavy jigs that will cut to the bottom and stay there do work, and down there you are contending mostly with leafless stems. Retrieves have to be slow or you just pull back up into the leaves. With a heavy jig & plastic instant hook sets are a necessity and every hook set results in a hook up. Unfortunately, if it isn't a fish it will be weeds. In lakes with fair populations of crayfish tubes always work and they can be fished weedless very slowly on a heavy bullet sinker. Leeches take abuse well too, both real and Gulp type, and they give you a little more time to set the hook."
6294766,Bill Krejca,2019-03-03 08:47:00,6107,"I have excellent results with a jig head I create from a molded Shad Dart mold, by Do-It. The head is created by trimming the head of all lead which is ahead of the hook eye. Maintaining the same angle, in line with the hook eye allows the lure to be pulled through the weeds with few hangups. An overhead spinner is used, it also helps. I prefer a bright twister-type tail, and florescent orange painted head. I think the flash of the spinner and bright colors help the walleye home in on the bait. Pulling through weeds perhaps gives less time for fish to spot and grab the bait, reason being for the bright colors. Casting into weed pockets and letting it sink is a good technique. In most cases, there are weeds in the pockets, although they may not be as exposed. Works for me. Bill"
6294808,kzoofisher,2019-03-03 09:54:00,5144,"Drop shooting into holes works well, too. Short pitches and pinpoint accuracy are possible in the weeds and then you can keep your bait off the bottom but in the strike zone for a while."
6294816,Aspencreek,2019-03-03 09:59:00,2911,"X2, Love this method on those HOT summer eves. I use a small maribou tail crappie jig with a tail hooked minnow or leech. Jig set to just hang above or just into the weeds. Cast it out and settle, then drag it back SLOW!!! And by slow I mean 2 cranks then stop, just barely moving it letting the minnow or leech do the work. If I want to work the edges I will do a modified lindy rig with floating jig, set up is simple a) sliding sinker b) pinned with a split shot about 16 to 24"" to a floating jig with a tail hooked minnow or leech. Cast out and retrieve SLOW, at the pace of a glacier. Some of the most exciting strikes I have ever had was this way. Biggest walleye too."
6294876,Guest,2019-03-03 13:29:00,0,try pulling a crawler harness with a bullet sinker (just heavy enough to give the proper depth) over the top of submerged weeds.
