6212592,stjoeguy,2018-06-23 22:47:00,979,"Another great week at the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin on Lake St. Joseph is in the books. Like most trips, this one had it's high points and low points, but overall, it was a great trip. We were up there the week of 6/9 - 6/16. During the week before our trip, fellow Walleye Central member and friend, Walleyeski, had kept us up to date with weather and fishing reports. If you've read Mike Borger's recent post about his Root Bay experience during that same week as Wallleyeski, you know that their weather week was cold, windy and miserable. So we were a little apprehensive about the weather. As the song goes - sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug. This year the week ahead of us got the bug and we got the windshield. Our weather turned out to be great! We had a few white-cap days but not too windy to keep us off the lake. Speaking of bugs, that part of the trip was good, also. Everyone got a bite or two from unknown bugs, probably no-see-ums, but the bug situation was very good. We sprayed the yard for mosquitoes the day we got there and had little problem with them all week. Flies were buzzing around like crazy one day but weren't really interested in biting. Maybe we were helped by the dragonflies that were out in abundance and put on quite the show to be watched from the deck. Our chief cook, hewhocookstomuch, was not able to make the trip this year. Somehow, he thought it was more important to recover from several weeks in the hospital with the flu and pneumonia than to cook for us. Some people and their priorities! The good news is that he'll be in great shape to join me for our September trip to Miniss. We missed his cooking but mostly we missed his gentle demeanor as he calmly reminded us to refrain from wandering too close to his kitchen. (Where's the sarcasm emoji?) We did discover that avikefan can flip a pan of hash browns, wmd can grill steak and potatoes, and IaDave14 fries some great fish. As you can see from the cooking paragraph we had quite a few Walleye Central guys on this trip. BCNeal joined us for the first time this year. He fished Lake st. Joseph 20 years ago out of Old Post and wanted another crack at it. Also on the trip were avikefan, wmd, IaDave14, and three outsiders: Sam, Jim & Tom. The lake level was down at least 3.5' from last year so I saw a few more rocks to mark on my Lowrance that I never knew before. Nobody had any rock incidents so all was good. In the attached picture the ramp down to the floating section of the dock was slightly uphill last year. Our crew was great. hewhocookstomuch couldn't make it but everyone else pitched in. I won't mention any names (let's just say it was a new, non-W/C member), but we had a nominee for pjshorthorn's weenie of the year award. Early in the trip, he asked to use the pee bottle while out fishing. He then proceeded to take off the cap, pee into the neck of the bottle, and all over his feet, without realizing until it was too late that the bottom of the bottle had been cut off and he was supposed to be going in the large end. He's a great guy and took it well. Needless to say we had a good laugh all week long. The drive up produced the most wildlife sightings, especially between Sioux Lookout and St. Joe. Hitting the road at 4AM probably helps that. Several moose and bears were spotted. On the way back we saw a bear with two very small cubs. That was cool. The pine martin was on the deck again this year and we saw a caribou and calf while on the lake. We got checked by MNR on the lake. We were fishing by the MNR cabin that they stay in occasionally while on the lake but we rarely see anyone there. They were very polite and easy going. The interesting part though was their technique. We had three boats in the area and they checked us all individually. We were last and had pulled to shore by then to wait for them. They checked our license and barbs, but asked all three boats the same question: ""How was your shore lunch?"" We all had the same answer. No shore lunch, we had sandwiches. Trying to get some fish to add to our totals, obviously. We only had three in the freezer at that point, so it was no problem. One guy had mistakenly put his 2017 license with his Outdoor Card. They accompanied him back to the cabin (not far, maybe 5 minutes) to see his 2018 license and check the freezer. In a word, fishing was great. Overall, the walleyes seem to be getting bigger every year. Our biggest was 27.5, which might not seem big by Lac Seul standards, but it's pretty good for St. Joe. It was a personal best for the new guy that got it. Also caught were a 26, 25 and and a bunch of 24's. The 26 matched a personal best for avikefan. It seemed like every walleye we got resulted in Oh well, just another 20 St. Joe walleye. Numbers were as good as ever. Like last year, ziggyzag. Biggest northern was 40.5. We don't target northerns and probably get them less than 10%. One year we got a couple big northerns at the Pembina River throwing spoons. We go up there several times each year but have now changed our technique to mostly trolling spoons. We discovered that the walleyes in the river hit spoons one after another and it's a good break from pitching jigs or vertical jigging most of the time. Our best producing spots were the River, Sandy Island, what we call Three Sisters and Grace's Sister. Grace's Sister is an island next to Grace island. Yes, I know Grace is a family name, not a girl's name, but I like Grace's Sister. I used to call it Eagle's Nest island for obvious reasons but walleyeski called it Grace's Sister and I liked it. The wind had been blowing onto the shoreline of Grace's Sister and fishing the shoreline the next day was great. Sandy Island has a nice sandbar that juts out of it. We drifted toward the sandbar and got a lot of fish from about 10' on in. On one drift we forgot where we were and drifted aground on the sandbar so we just sat there and caught fish pitching out from our grounded boat. Another group just got out and fished from shore for a while. All week we started our fishing around 10-12' and shallower. We got some fish out deeper but were getting so many shallow that we just didn't bother trying deeper. Oh yeah, there was some low points. No rock issues, but on the second day my boat started running rough. We took off the cowl and noticed a hole in the foam air filter. We removed the remaining filter and left my boat at the dock. I used a camp boat for the rest of the week. On the 27 mile trip back to the boat landing on the final Saturday I left early in case I got bogged down somewhere along the way. It was still running a little rough but we made it back to the landing just fine. The boat is still at my local marina being repaired, however. Second low point was burying a treble hook in my finger. Barry and I first removed the hook from the Dr. Spoon. While Barry was looking for some line and working up the courage to jerk the hook from my finger I moved the hook around trying to figure out the angle it went in. While doing that the hook fell out. Thank goodness for St. Joe barbless hooks. So, another great St. Joe trip is history. Miniss in September and then back to St. Joe next June."
6212614,andreindy,2018-06-24 06:35:00,308,"Thank you for taking the time to share and write about your time. Reading about your adventure while drinking a hot coffee around my kitchen table this morning, about 6am, kids still sleeping, birds chirping, just felt good. I also appreciated that you included pictures. Seeing happy, smiling people feels good too. Thank you again sir."
6297190,fldoc1,2019-03-08 12:10:00,69,"It is great to read your summaries. Another great trip to St. Joe. Someday I want to get back to St. Joe. Our group stayed at Camp Lake St Joe twice. (2008,2010) Great fishing, great owners, nice place to stay, reasonable, but far from Winoga Lodge. In the past they had smaller boats and motors so a chore to get down the lake. A few days we got about 2/3 of the way to Winoga Lodge. Got caught in some rain that picked up in intensity so a long, not fun ride back to camp. I thought about taking my 18 ft Lund to Camp St. Joe but not much weather protection. This was a number of years ago so maybe things have changed. One year at the end of the week while being boated to the landing the Winoga Lodge barge showed up. I had no idea that there was a lodge down the lake. I did some checking and ended up communicating with St Joe Guy. His cabin has protection from the weather and I would be comfortable taking my boat. I had always planned on joining their trip some year but our schedules have never quite worked out. Someday I hope to join them.I am curious with the lake so low was it a problem getting through boulder city? We went to Little Vermillion (a fly in near Red Lake) in mid July last summer and the lake was also way down plus it was super dry and there was fires and smoke around. The smoke was really heavy in camp one day. Were you aware of any fires / smoke while you were there?Randy from Duluth"
6298060,avikefan,2019-03-10 11:32:00,5,"Hey Randy, I'm a member if StJoeGuys group. No issues getting thru Boulder City, he has a pretty good route thru there. Fortunatley, the low water levels had very little impact on our trip and we didnt see any fires!"
6298110,fldoc1,2019-03-10 12:49:00,69,I know there must be a way to get through boulder city as the quide boat would fly straight through there and we would be locating landmarks and working our way around the edge of the area. Interesting you did not have any smoke. Other than the one day the smoke was strong and thick in camp like a dense fog the smoke blocked out the sun and kept the temps more moderate. Did you cast for northerns or did they bite while walleye fishing. St Joe is a much bigger lake than Little Vermillion with deeper areas so not sure where I would cast for them in July. I know that the guide boats take some time and zip around casting for northerns. With the smaller boats and motors from camp st joe it would take an hour to get to boulder city so not easy to zip from place to place. Randy from Duluth
6298130,avikefan,2019-03-10 13:27:00,5,"We only spend a few hours of the week casting for northerns. Majority of the big ones have been caught while jigging for eyes though. If we happen to run into a location that looks like it could hold large pike we may spend a bit of time there, but hunting walleyes it the first preference for most. StJoeguy and I have both fished out of Camp St Joe and neither of us miss doing that trip down and back every day. I do miss Pedlar Path, have had some great days in there with my kids years ago!"
6247498,Goggy,2018-09-21 15:45:00,2,"Thanks for sharing your report. My group is considering Lake St. Joseph for a future trip. I'm going through the trip reports on the Canada forum here to get some information. Really helpful to be able to get an idea of how the lake may shape up for us. Looks like you had a great trip! Glad the hook came out relatively easily and you got your boat back to home base w/out needing a tow. Quick question - with St. Joseph being so big, do you find the wind can keep you off the lake for periods of time? Or are there some islands/bays to tuck into within close proximity to the Winoga outpost? Any thoughts you have would be most appreciated. Thanks again! Dave"
6247522,stjoeguy,2018-09-21 17:00:00,979,"First, welcome to the forum. I was surprised to see a response to my report this late. One reason I like the Winoga cabin is that it's in the middle of some great fishing areas. As a result we never have to travel far to fish. I'm sure that wind is more of a factor on larger lakes than on smaller lakes, and wind has many times determined where on the lake we fish, but it has never kept us off the lake. As you mentioned, there has always been a point we can get around or a bay to duck into. Of course the ride there may be a bit rough but the advantage is fishing near the cabin is that the rough ride is short. Enjoy your trip planning! It's a fun part of the trip. I love to talk about fishing St. Joe so let me know if you have any other questions."
6247536,Goggy,2018-09-21 17:31:00,2,"Thanks very much! Appreciate the welcome and the quick response. Good to know that Winago offers great fishing spots close to camp and some sheltered spots you can get to. Sounds like a great lake and a great camp. We were at Ogoki Lake at the end of August this year and ran into some strong winds. We were able to fish some back bays and sheltered spots which was great. There was still lots of fish to keep us busy and we could focus on fishing not just trying to keep our butts in the boat! I’ve heard reports from folks on larger lakes that got wind blown and weren’t able to fish for half their trip! I know weather is always an unknown , but would prefer to avoid that situation! Thanks also for your offer of more assistance on St. Joseph. CheersDave"
6270616,RichA$1970,2018-12-20 19:20:00,1159,Great report out and I am planning to go to that area this year. Do you know anything about Lake Oz as I will go by myself n it’s diffuse finding a camp that will take 1 person. Does Lake Oz also have the restrictions on a single barbless hook? I would love to go to St Joe but singles are tough to find that are under $800. I had a Rapala Original Floater F18 treble that was not barbless buries that after awhile I finally broke off my shaving razor blade to cut it out (some peroxide n super glue n I was back at it while at a fly in north of Red Lake). Any thoughts or ideas for a party of one would be appreciated. Thanks
6270656,stjoeguy,2018-12-20 21:53:00,979,"Sorry, I really don't know much about Oz. I don't think it is a single barbless lake like St. Joe. June is a hard time to find openings anywhere in NW Ontario but I can imagine it is extremely difficult on St. Joe. Your best chance to find an opening on St. Joe would probably be Camp Lake St. Joseph. Here's an old W/C thread about Oz Lake:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...hlight=Oz+Lake Good luck. I hope you can get up to St. Joe sometime."
6270664,RichA$1970,2018-12-21 04:42:00,1159,Thanks for the info
6275292,lobo1,2019-01-04 09:41:00,734,"Hey St Joe Guy - I been in Ice House Bay a few times and pulled up to the dock of that house you rented but never been in it - Everything good inside? Good place to rent? Those little boats OK - typical camp- boats? I thought about booking that house one year but couldn't get a firm commitment from enough guys. We been checked in the ""middle of nowhere"" on that lake too - we dont keep any fish (besides lunch) so never had a problem. Where is that MNR cabin? Seems like they would have more productive enforcement opportunities elsewhere with the limited number of boats on St Joe and with most of them back toward the launch. Thanks Steve"
6275362,stjoeguy,2019-01-04 11:51:00,979,The cabin is very nice inside. The boats are 16' Alumarine with 20 HP Merc. The MNR cabin is on a channel around to the west side of the island. It looks pretty basic and I rarely see anyone there.
