I don't mind working hard to get to the fish, just as long as they are there. Question to everyone:What are the best methods for pike? lakers? walleye?What I mean is did you primarily cast, troll, or jig? And what lures were producing? Thanks again to all! I love this board"

Thanks again to >all! I love this >board Jay,Big spinnerbaits and Johson silver minnows for the northerns over the cabbage weed beds on favourable and setting net in about 10 feet of water. Walleye will be in the edges of the weed beds. Bring plenty of jigs and tails. Sorry, but i can't help you with the trout. Good luck and post a report when you get back.Tyler"
510651,Scott,2001-02-13 13:49:00,385,"COnsistent BIG pike with hundreds of medium sized northern mixed in. Excellent walleye fisheries exist in most lakes but the size is contained in North and South Trout, and in Favourable. Lemonade is a numbers lake but the pigs are elsewhere. Lakers are worth the work. Pulled an 18lb sow out of North Trout 2yrs ago. What a beast on light tackle. Wish I was going back, I envy you Jay, best of luck!"
510652,Guest,2001-02-13 18:57:00,0,Scott is right on with his assement. Good luck and I wish i was going with you too.

510637,Guest,2001-01-22 09:23:00,0,"I learned about WayNorth a few days ago. They have access to North & South Trout lakes, Favourable Lake, Setting Net Lake, and Lemonade lake. Walleye, pike, and lake trout fishing is phenomenal from what I have read so far. Does anyone out there have personal experience on these bodies of water? As always, the true quality of the fisheries is the ultimate measuring stick. Thanks.."
510638,Guest,2001-01-22 13:29:00,0,"Jay,Click on the search button on top of the screen. When you get there type in way north camp and select the canada forum. You will find posts regarding the place your talking about. Good luck"
510639,GregK,2001-01-23 14:40:00,113,I have a friend that has been up there several times. Fishing was terrific.
510640,Guest,2001-01-24 17:22:00,0,I have been there once. Lot's of big pike and above average walleye and lake trout fishing.
510643,Guest,2001-01-29 07:45:00,0,">Was there last year. A couple of things you need to know. You operate on thier schedule, not yours, because the best fishing is on the portage lakes. Cabins are basic at best, good equipment however, fishing was so, so, but did raise several Northern ""logs"" just couldn't get'em to bite! Walleye are average, but do have some lakers."
510644,Guest,2001-01-30 04:26:00,0,"Thanks for the feedback guys, I really appreciate it! One question that I have is for ""West Coast Hoosier"" and it pertains to your response. I have seen a brochure and video from WayNorth and it is quite different from your account of the place. My tendency is to listen to anglers on this board because we take our fishing quite seriously so can I ask you to be a bit more specific in some of the details (scheduling and fishing quality) that you really were disappointed with? Thanks pal.."
510645,Guest,2001-01-30 15:45:00,0,"The fishing at Way North was incredible. My wife and I were there the 2nd. week of July last year. One thing- go with a sense of humor and a sense of adventure ( for the portages )The cabins were rough, the food was outstanding, boats were ok, Honda outboards were great. I highly recommend the place."
510646,Guest,2001-01-31 05:29:00,0,"My wife wants to know if they have a telephone, if they do I am there! hahaha (actually I am serious)"
510647,Guest,2001-01-31 06:54:00,0,"Mike,Since you were there the second week of July, you had to be in cabin #1. We were in #2. If you had to discribe the portages and time schedules, would it be far to say they are long and take approximately one hour each way. And the guides and camp manager weren't in much of a rush to get out there in the mornings?When would you say you put in line in the water everyday around 9:00 or 9:30 am???? or later when the sun was up around 4:30 am??I agree on the Honda equipment but one of the motors or North Trout was broken and they knew it, without telling us! None of us go up there to mess with broken/bad equipment. They has other motors which should have been taken over!I rated the fishing as normal from other places I have been in Ont. not outstanding!!!!!!!!"
510648,Tyler,2001-01-31 08:02:00,3,"I have been to Way north 3 times and have always found the fishing for big pike to awesome. Most people in camp each week catch a northern 20 + pounds. I have had days with seven northerns over 20 in one day. The walleye fishing on favourable and Lemonade lakes was outstanding. I have had 200 fish days (walleyes) on lemonade. The only time I found the eye fishing slow was when the may flies hatched in late june. The trout in early June and early sepetember was great for fish between 3 and 15lbs. I agree with Hoosier that the portage lakes take some time to get to however that's the biggest benefit to going up there. With four remote lakes to fish from one camp the variety of fishing is incredlibe and what i enjoy the most about the place. Although you may get out to the lakes till around 8:00 am. you can come back after 8 or 9 o'clock and still have a hot dinner ready for you when you get there. You can go out to the portage lakes earlier in the morning if you willing to walk the portages without the staff. The favourable portage is about 3/4 of mile and the North trout portage is 200 yards. Jay- They do have a satelite phone and TV in camp. Good luck. I trust you will enjoy the fishing as much as I did.Tyler>Mike, >Since you were there the second >week of July, you had >to be in cabin #1. > We were in #2. >If you had to discribe >the portages and time schedules, >would it be far to >say they are long and >take approximately one hour each >way.
