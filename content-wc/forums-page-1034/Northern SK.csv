How has netting up there been (I got burned last year on a lake that was heavily netted over the winter and don't want that to happen again)? I understand Lakers, Walleye and Pike are all available in this lake. Who has fished it recently? Is it worth the trip?Thanks."

I can guarantee that you will have some good fishing but make sure you come in the spring or early summer. I have only fished Nemebien lake twice but have had good success catching pike, walleye, and lake trout. Take the trip I think you will enjoy it."

511409,Brad,2001-03-09 11:06:00,95,If you have any other questions let me know and I will try to help you. Would you consider a fly-in?
511410,Guest,2001-03-09 14:52:00,0,"I think a fly in might be in the works for next year. Cost is always a factor, as is finding guys to go - everyone I used to go fishing with is recently married and on pretty short leashes - both $$$ and time wise. I figure give them a year and they should be ready to get away for a few days... <GRIN>"
