510973,whitey,2001-02-13 07:16:00,36,"Duane: you need to be a little more specific in what you are looking for. In my book there are more than one type of fly-ins. Do you want to go to your local airport, fly to winnapeg, get picked up in a 50 setter jet and fly in to a private resrt type fishing lodge, where everything is done for you, guides included, and spend a bizzilon dollars? Or do you want to drive a few hours into canada, and get flowen 45 minutes to a rustic cabin where you provide and cook your own food, etc. but at a cost of $500??? I've been on them all. where are you from? do you want to drive part way, how much do you want to spend?? answer a few of these and I can point you in the right direction."
