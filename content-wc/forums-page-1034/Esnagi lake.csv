511287,Guest,2001-03-03 19:53:00,0,We will be heading to Esnagi lake in August and was just wondering how many of you have ever fished there. We will be in search of Pike and Walleye.What can we expect? and tips or tricks?Thanks in advance for your help!Jeff
511288,Guest,2001-03-04 20:41:00,0,My co-worker has been going there for years and really slays the walleye there year after year. They catch 200+ per week. No hawgs but all nice size. Pike fishing is fantastic too. Send me an e-mail and a phone no and I'll put you in touch w/ him. Probably would be a good idea if you can get a map of the lake and send him a copy so he could mark some spots for you. He knows the lake like the back of his hand.

I did notethat the bigger walleyes (20""+ ) came from the far south end of the lake,farthest from the lodge. Probably much less fishing pressure.The largest walleye of the trip, a 10.5 lb. was caught castinga rapala near the big rock, 50' from the dock ! Lodge and staffwere excellent. Very helpfull and always displayed a positiveattitude. The only thing I didn't like were the ""hand crafted""ceadar boats. I found them uncomfortable and very heavy.(slow )Good luck !"

I only ask because Esnagi Lodge said that they have all alluminum boats.Congrats on the 10.5# walleye, that is a real trophy in any body of water and especially in those waters you were in.Thanks again,Jeff"

Most of the guys did fish primarlyfor walleyes but a few of us did some fishing for northerns every day because we got tied of catching walleyes. It was veryhot when we were there and I believe they either went deep ordormant. You would think that someone would accidentaly catch anorthern when walleye fishing, but none of our group did."
