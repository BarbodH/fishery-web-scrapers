You also have to pay round trip(2 times). I suppose they had people going into Canada, and exiting thru another crossing, this way they get their toll both ways. At least, when you leave Canada, your toll is already taken care of. Just thought I would let ya'll know...Good luck!"

511413,Guest,2001-03-10 17:41:00,0,"I assume the reason for this is that you won't be able to pay in Canadian $. The $ is for the bridge toll, which is owned by the paper company. Other crossings should be free, unless similar situation. Bill"
