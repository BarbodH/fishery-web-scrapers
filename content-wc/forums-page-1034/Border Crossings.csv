511310,Guest,2001-03-04 16:03:00,0,Just was reading an article in the newspaper where Canada has been giving some people a hard time or denying entrance based upon any previous convictions including OWI's. This was news to me as I have been going up for 30 years and have never had a question about anyones past. Was curious if anyone had run into this or is this something the media is blowing up all out of proportion?

I've been crossing for 20 years 5 to 6 times a year and most of the time I've been waved across. The times I've been searched we just waited for them to do their work. This time they searched us and asked for the drivers lic for both of us. I think its' true. This is one more little thing the Canucks are doing to US citizens. I'm hardcore for Canadian fishing, but each little regulation and each required permit and each border stop and each time they back the border up for 3 to 6 hours, and a 1 fish limit on Rainy Lake when I'm forking a $100 US a day for a cabin.......It's starting to make me think that I'm not welcome. TGG"

They treat almost all of us as if we are illegal aliens. I cannot recall how many times I have been checked, had my truck searched, had them go thru my wallet, they have even gone as far as taking out the soles of my boots.Bottom line is that on both sides of the line they have a job to do & that is to protect our/your country. Thats the way it is & there is nothing you or I can do to change it.....except be polite & I'm sure the rubber glove doesn't hurt all that much ! Good FishenRob"

I've been asked to empty my wallet, explain where the cash came from (like $500 is a lot of money), and been treated like a terrorist. Furthermore, U.S. customs complain that Canadian customs are too lenient. I suggest that the next time you want to make a comment like this one that you get a balanced view of things, in other words check out both sides of the issue first."
511317,Guest,2001-03-07 05:07:00,0,Denying entrace to either country because of a DWI or DUI? You've got to be kidding me!
511316,Guest,2001-03-07 05:32:00,0,"Confiscated cash, goods and such are sold and the money used to further their operating budget. I had a buddy with a previous drug conviction who went to the USA with $10000 in his pocket to buy a Harley. Cash was seized....thrown in jail....deported. Cash was kept.At the border you are in no mans land. They can pretty much do what they want both Canadian and American."
