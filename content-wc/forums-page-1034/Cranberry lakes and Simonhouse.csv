511283,Guest,2001-03-09 05:01:00,0,"Never been to those lakes, but fished others in Grass River system. Typical Canadian Shield Lakes--tons of walleyes,some quite large. Jig/minnow in moving water in spring, cranks or jigs in deeper water later in year. Fished Reed Lake immediately after ice-out one year--three of us boated pike (12-40"") on every other cast. We were going through our tackle boxes to find something they would NOT hit. Beautiful country. Good Luck, Mark"
