511329,MNBS,2001-03-05 10:32:00,13,"I go with a large group (15-20 guys) their every two years in August. We go there because they can accomodate large groups like ours. It is at least an hour from Hudson because the road is rough. Last summer 10-15mph for most of the way. You leave your vehicle at a landing and have to boat about 1-2 miles to the resort.The resort is run by the Indian tribe and you are staying on an Indian Reservation. Don't expect them to be really helpful. We paid good money for the bunkhouses and they wouldn't even give us toilet paper for the cabin, and we had to tell them to come and get the garbage a couple of times.To get to Bear narrows would depend on the size of your boat, but I would guess it would be 15 miles. I'm not really sure. The fishing here has been very good here for us. You are right next to Vaughn Lake, and fishing the main lake is also very productive. I personally caught 70-80 walleyes this year in 5 days of fishing (7 over the slot, 10-15 in the slot). We also spend some time fishing northerns. Our group will eat fish every night and bring a limit home, so catching fish is not usually a problem.Like I said, the accomodations are not the greatest, but because we have a large group, and we know that part of the lake, we keep going back.Bob"

511331,Guest,2001-03-10 06:41:00,0,"Our group stayed there in the fall of 99 lots of fish but, the staff at this camp is basically useless. If you don't mind waiting for them to come to life in the morning so you can get some bait the fishing is good at both this part of Lac Seul and in Vaughn Lake. We caught lots of slot fish and several in the 26"" range. If the wind is blowing in on Pine Point be there! We pounded em there up there for two days with a good breeze blowing in on it. Facilties were not that bad but someone needs to light a fire under the help there, they rarely speak and did not seem very cordial at anytime. The fishing was good enough to make up for the shortcomings of the staff. I don't think you will be disappointed with the place just remember that if you need anything from the resort staff ask early so you have plenty of time to wait."
