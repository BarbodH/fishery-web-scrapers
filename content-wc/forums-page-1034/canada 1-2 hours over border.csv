511139,ripper,2001-02-19 11:25:00,17,Anybody have suggestions for a 4 days trip to a Canadian lake you can drive to from the Twin cities for 12 people. It needs to be good fishing- we usually go to Winnie that weekend but would like a changeThanks
511140,HLLGuide,2001-02-19 14:45:00,10,"Depends on what you are looking for? If you want to go to a resort, I've heard of some good resorts just north of the border. Camp Manitou is a nice spot. Down home service and good fishing. I've heard that Happy Landing Lodge is a ##### of a spot but never been there. It also depends on what type of fish you are looking for?? Good Luck!"

511142,Guest,2001-02-19 19:58:00,0,Last year me and a buddy took a trip to Eagle Lake and stayed at Fin and Feather Resort. We went the second weekend of June and ran into some pretty rough weather (cold and windy) even snowed. We were up there for the week and did alright on the walleyes. Limits werent tough to come by but didnt get into huge numbers or too many 20+ fish alot of 14-18 inchers. Smaller pike and a few bass. We really didnt fish for any other species other than walleye though. The resort had great equipment and facilities. www.finandfeather.com We had a great trip despite the weather and would recommend it to anyone especially seeing as it was our first year on the lake.
511143,Guest,2001-02-19 23:30:00,0,"Why not look @ anywhere on the Winnipeg River System ? or if driving a bit further & on some gravel doesn't bother you, maybe try looking at the English River system. Just a couple of suggestions. I do know a lot of people from Mn. do fish up on the Winnipeg River @ Minaki,Ont. They all seem to be happy.Maybe some of the people who regulary fish the English could also point you to something......Good FishenRobmy personal homepagehttp://sites.netscape.net/paradisecovep/homepage"
511144,Guest,2001-02-20 19:36:00,0,"Go to Morson, Ontario Lake of the Woods. Less than 1 hour north of Baudette. Red Wing Resort is the place if you want to stay on the mainland. American Plan island resorts try Hidden Island as well as several others. You will find lots and lots of Ws anytime starting in June. I like to go to this area in mid- August. Warm weather and the fish are on the reefs. You just drive out and get em. (put em back too) TGG"
511145,mark,2001-02-24 09:51:00,61,May be too small but I have a 3 Bedroom cabin for rent just into Canadian waters its on an island and has plenty of room for camping aswell. It is on RAINY LAKE [email protected]
511146,Guest,2001-02-26 02:45:00,0,"I have been to Happy Landing Lodge for the last three years and I would highly recommend this resort to anyone. It's Located on Pipestone lake just 40 minutes from the I. Falls, Fort Frances border. The key to this lake is that there are no roads to the lake. This is why the fishing is so good. Besides pipestone lake they also have twelve other portage lakes to fish all with short 2 to 10 min. walks. All the lakes already have the boats, motors, and gas in them so you don't need to carry anything in execpt for you're rods. You can catch walleye, northern, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, lake trout, and muskie at happy landing. All their cabins are new within the last six years and they all have seperate bedrooms. They sleep two to ten people in each cabin, if you have a party of five or larger you will have two full bathrooms and showers in your cabin. Happy Landing also has a huge 50' X 80' main lodge that is just beautiful. This is the best resort that I have found in canada and I can't wait to get back this year. Give them a call and get a brochure 800-766-0876"
511147,Lee G.,2001-03-05 14:12:00,9,"The reply from 'The Great Guide' was right on when he mentioned Red Wing Lodge. This is a nice resort with cabins sleeping from 2 to 12. They do have a house that they also rent by the week. The camp is located on the shores of a protected bay. Walleye, Musky, Northern, and Small Mouth are located minutes away. I have caught five pound Walleyes not more than 2 minutes from the dock. I have been going there for 10 years now and plan on going for many more. I go for two weeks and have a great time. If you get one of the lakeside cabins, you have a great view of the lake and are no more than 75 feet from the dock. I guarantee Mike and Ann will accomodate your request. Contact them at 1-888-488-5601 or e-mail www.redwinglodge.net. I believe you would be very pleased with the your stay."
