511426,Guest,2001-03-10 19:38:00,0,"Wife and I are headed to Eagle lake Ont. the third week of september. I'm going to do some muskie fishing, wife wants to walleye fish. I'll need to keep her entertained so I'm looking for any info on Eagles walleyes. We're staying at Cedar Point lodge on the north end. Should be an exciting trip seeing's how we just rigged ourselves with a New Pro V. Looking forward to breaking her in right on canadian waters. Wife wants one for the wall. I told her she'll have to do better than 10/lbs..She says she's going for 15. She's a little cocky..I want a trophy too, just in a different species, and done in graphite. Thanks in advance for any info you can share..Ed"
