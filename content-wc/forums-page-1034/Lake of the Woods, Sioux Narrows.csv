Northerns, rattle traps, spinner baits, spoons, and jigs also.Small mouth bass, small crank baits, tube jigs, or live bait(leechs). Lake trout tackle can vary depends if you will troll or jig, if jigging buzz bombs(white), swidish pimples work well, if trolling spoons. What time of year are you coming up, I can be a little more specific as what to bring.D'arcy"
