510917,Guest,2001-02-12 10:07:00,0,"Bob...I have friends that have been going to Sunnyside for over 20 years. My wife & I joined them in 96 & 97. It fishes like a river, but looks like a lake. There were always 10-12 in our group & we had community walleye fries at least 9nights both years we were there. We caught northerns to 16 pounds small mouth to 3 lbs ( they usually do better than this )& walleyes to 7-8 pounds. This group still goes there regularly, about the 10th of July for 2 weeks. They jig on bottom with crawlers for walleyes, cast cranks for Northerns & smallmouth. They have it down to a science, stop in International Falls & each couple buys a flat of crawlers to use. E-Mail me if you have any other questions, Bill Brown"

510908,BD,2001-02-03 04:56:00,739,"Mike; Are you familiar with Lake Independance near Marquette? Are there any cabins for rent on the lake? Before I was married I camped at Perkins Park but the better half doesn't like to camp. Thanks for any info you can give me.""An angler is a man who spends rainy days sitting around on the muddy banks of rivers doing nothing because his wife won't let him do it at home."" --- Irish saying"
510909,Guest,2001-02-03 05:28:00,0,"Bob,I am a Kenora native and by the sounds of it you are going to fish the Winnipeg river system.

510910,Guest,2001-02-03 09:31:00,0,"Bob I'm from Iowa also and have been going to the Kenora area for about 38 years. We stay in a camp that is about 20 miles out of Kenora on Black Sturgeon Lake. Black Sutrgeon has access into the Winnipeg River system via a set of ""rollers"" that you take your boat over to by-pass some rapids. This allows you to fish both the Black Sturgeon Lake system and the Winnipeg system. One thing about the ""rollers"", you need to have boat that is 17' or less to get through them. It's a manual ""winching"" process, so if you have a heavier boat it takes two men to ""crank"" the winch. Just an option I wanted to make you aware of. If you wanted to stay on the Winnipeg system I'd suggest you dirve the extra 45 minutes up to Minaki out of Kenora and stay there. That location gives you great access to allot water!"
510911,Guest,2001-02-03 14:21:00,0,"Pat, how is the fishing on the Black Sturgeon Lake and/or River? We fish out of Minaki the past 3 years on the Winnipeg River. What type of fish is in the Black Sturgeon system? Good fishing, Don"
510912,Guest,2001-02-04 20:00:00,0,"Black Sturgeon is a lake chain, the dominate species are walleye, northern and smallmouth. The walleye fishing is usually pretty consistent, with the average sized fish being somewhat larger than the Winnipeg River fish (at least this has been my experience). Don't fish northern allot, but when we have diligently it's pretty good. The smallmouth fishing at times can be fantastic, especially in July when topwater is on. I've had times we caught literally dozens of 2 to 5 pounders. My love though is walleye fishing and that typically is are quarry!!"
510913,Hookman,2001-02-05 08:32:00,37,Pat..what is the name of the resort you stay at. do they have a web-site..hookman
510915,Guest,2001-02-09 16:40:00,0,"Pat, Do you stay at Black Sturgeon Camp? I stay 10 miles up the road in Redditt. I could use a litle info on BSC if that's where you stay."
510914,Guest,2001-02-10 21:18:00,0,"I stay at Black Sturgeon Camp, no web site available for it. I'm currenlty away from home and don't have the address or phone number with me. As soon as I get back home I'll post that info for those interested. The camp has been there for many years, I believe it's third generation family ownerhip now."
