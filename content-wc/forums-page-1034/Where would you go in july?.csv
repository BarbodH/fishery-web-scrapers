510557,Guest,2001-02-23 18:09:00,0,Where do you catc 40 to 50 thousand walleye in that time period?Steve Dover
510558,stewart,2001-02-23 18:47:00,100,Who would want to catch walleyes ALL the time? There has to be a certain amount of not catching to make it fun.

Go once, and you will keep going again and again. There should be a law against it. If you want further info feel free to e-mail me."

510550,Guest,2001-01-20 21:41:00,0,Jig fishing was very good in the fall. All the way down to 75-80 feet.
510554,Guest,2001-01-21 12:19:00,0,"We took a housboat out of the Sioux Narrows the second week of July last year. There were six guys, all pretty good fisherman. We consevatively estimated that we caught over 1200 walleyes, large and small, and god only knows how many nice perch. We ate walleyes till they were running out of our ears, and each of us brought back our allowance of 50 jumbo perch. If this sounds good to you, contact floating lodges @ Voyageur.ca. We fished primarily by Yellow Girl Bay. Good Fishig, Five Lines Menominee, Michigan"
510555,Guest,2001-01-21 14:12:00,0,Sounds like a great trip. But only 1200 Walleye. I don't think you guys are that good of fisherman. Thats only an average of 30 of 40 a day per man.
