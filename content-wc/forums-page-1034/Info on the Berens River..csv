Green's Airways,located in Red Lake provides the air service to both. I fishedthere in 97 & 99 , both in Aug. and the walleye fishing was excellent. Many 5 to 8 lb. This is not a big pike system butwe did catch a 15 lb. in 97. I stayed at Green's but met peoplethat stayed at Bull Moose. Sounds like Bull Moose is the nicercamp but MORE expensive and run more like a prison camp. Green'swas plain but still nice. Have fun !"

Wooden walkways to everything, owner cleaned your boat every night. Never felt like a prison to me! Love to go again. Unless things have changed, don't hesitate to go there. Can easily fish both lakes and get tired of fishing walleyes.."
