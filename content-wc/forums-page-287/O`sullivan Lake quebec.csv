Has anyone been up there recently and what should I expect or should I try and get my money back?? Thanks"

I havn't been in over 10 years but have friends that still go. Love the fact that the lake offers Walley, pike and grey trout fishing. I'm not a bear hunter but you should have no problem with bagging one since O'sullivan is known for its great bear hunting. That being said Quebec offers unbelievable bear hunting just about anywhere in the province since there's been an explosion in the bear population over that past few years. Not so great when your on a camping fishing tripWith respect to Russell the verdict seems to be that you either like him or not. I personally haven't dealt with him much and remain indifferant. I'm not a fan of one of his sons who is more of a office type than an outdoorsman...I've been around but still have a soft spot for O'sullivan and plan to return.The way I look at it, like him or not, Russell won't be in my boat.Good luck and bag one for all us campers.Cheers."

All the camps at Stamond are new. I have fished there off and on since the mid '80s. Walleye, pike, lake trout, and they offer bear hunts. I walked over to O'Sullivan once. I did not like the way the camps were surrounded by sand. I was at Stramond last year. I have to say they are the nicest camps I have ever stayed in !! The road in from RT. #117 is very rough. We just took it slow. I pulled my 20' Alaskan in. The walleye fishing was OK. The lakers were huge ! We don't target pike."

I heard that the cabins were newly renovated and that's for sure something to consider especially when you spend a full week at an outfitters. From what I've heard fist hand quite a few years back from Ted the former owner of O'sullivan and from others is that Stramond is known primarily as a lake trout lake whereas O'sullivan is know primarily as a walleye destination. That being said, laketrout fishing at O'sullivan is still great with many double digit fish to be had. I'm sure that the walleye fishing at Stramond is good if not great for those who put the time in. I personally don't mind a challenge! I agree with you that the road in off the 117 can be rough especially after a heavy rain fall. Where I disagree with you is that the sand point where O'sullivan is located is great...LESS FLIES TO DEAL WITH Cheers!"
