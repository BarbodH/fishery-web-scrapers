They could NOY get thru without the extension. After the extension was put on the power auger, it was half into the extension before they got thru. Take it from there, the early thaw and warm weather have long since gone, weather at night has been extremely cold the last few weeks, colder than -20 c many nights. Seems like a typical year now"
