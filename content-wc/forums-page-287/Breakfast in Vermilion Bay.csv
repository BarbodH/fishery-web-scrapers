I just found out about another option that will be opening on May 1 at Bobby's Corner. A local lady is setting up a food van (not Kokums) which will open at 6 in the morning and will be serving breakfast. Of course the other news......Season Premiere of River Monsters on April 5th...""Canadian Horror"" (sounds scary!)http://northernontario.travel/sunset...eason-premiere"

My spine is already tingling and my DVR is set. When I hear Gord say, ""it had an intention to eat him"", I can say I know that guy, we'll sort of. This beats the time I saw Dennis Rodman at a gas station as my closest brush with fame."
3719626,lassh,2015-04-01 18:58:00,553,I'll be watching. Thats a nice blog you have Gord. Though no telling what would show up if you did a google search for it... You're going to be more famous than Chuck Mossbeck and the Samsquanch at Snellgrove that aired a few years back on Monster Quest. The musky week looks like a lot of fun.
