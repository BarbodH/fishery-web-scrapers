3724602,IL John,2015-04-03 09:18:00,45,Staying near sabaskong bay lodge was wondering how far of a boat trip is it to Miles Bay ?is the fishing generally better the more north you go. This will be my first trip to LOW . Thx
3724802,ftfarms,2015-04-03 10:16:00,444,It's 12 miles or so from gills marina in morson to grassy narrows lodge in milesbay.
3725706,Baseline,2015-04-03 15:29:00,3207,It is buoyed all the way so you can run. Doesn't take long unless the weather kicks up.
3726330,Obabikon,2015-04-03 18:34:00,2370,Looking at an 8-9 mile boat ride. Not a big deal!
3726394,BreezyPoint,2015-04-03 18:57:00,1581,I fish in Sabaskong Bay for all species and do quite well. I have never had to go as far as Miles Bay to catch walleyes. I actually catch all the walleyes I want in a two mile circle around the lodge I stay at.Frank

3729002,IL John,2015-04-04 17:42:00,45,"Last week of July. My uncle owns a cabin/island north of sabaskong bay lodge. I've been fishing nw ontario since 1985 and never been there. My older brothers went a lot in the early eighties with my dad, but when I came of age we started fishing further north in ontario. Super excited to fish new water"
