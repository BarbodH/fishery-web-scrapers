3722146,Larry S,2015-04-02 14:24:00,665,Will be heading up to Kearns Lake again July 17-24th. Will try dragging the bay where my sister pulled up the Packer Sweatshirt with a large salmon treble hook to see if I can hook the owner of the said Sweatshirt
3722234,Aspencreek,2015-04-02 14:44:00,2911,Hope you find more treasures!!!Still looking for that watch that popped of my wrist in South Islet on Lac Seul.
3722290,@Lunker,2015-04-02 14:56:00,835,"Unless your sister is a very small person, it looks like the owner of that hoodie is / was a very LARGE person."
3723258,SSH,2015-04-02 20:05:00,526,"In lieu of it being a Packers sweatshirt, your sister should have definitely practiced catch and release!"
3723322,Aspencreek,2015-04-02 20:19:00,2911,"There seems to be an abundance of ill will on the part of Vikings fans, but then again it is well earned."
2988353,Larry S,2014-07-12 08:28:00,665,If I would have had a salmon snagging treble hook I would have dragged the bay to see if there was a skelton from the Packer Fan who's sweatshirt we found.
2990673,JMKC,2014-07-13 08:59:00,238,Being a Bears fan it would of been catch and release !
3003146,Aspencreek,2014-07-16 14:40:00,2911,"I' m really glad all you Packer bashers are having a good time with this....because in the Fall...well..... not so much, EH!"
3003378,Knoxabilly,2014-07-16 15:29:00,225,preach!
3003442,castnblast,2014-07-16 15:52:00,111,lol
3004490,Aspencreek,2014-07-16 22:06:00,2911,"Not exactly sure what that means.although there really isn't any need to ""preach"", facts just don't lie."
3005890,doubleheader,2014-07-17 10:52:00,2652,Now that's funny and I'm a Steelers fan !!!
3012129,walleyeduran,2014-07-19 16:23:00,286,"Wow, I didn't know the viking and bears fans would come out of the wood work on a sweat shirt story. You can tell it has been a long time since they have won the NFC North. At least the bears fans can say they have one a Super Bowl, you Viking fans should lay low, Oh wait, just heard you are planning on winning the Super Bowl this year. And last year, and next year, on & on & on & on........."
3012177,ftfarms,2014-07-19 16:44:00,444,GO PACK GO. It's not far off now.
3016770,Lambertson Rock Guy,2014-07-21 10:24:00,20,"Just last week on Lake of the Woods I caught a sucker in 28 feet of water trolling fairly fast with a bottom bouncer/spinner/crawler, , one buddy caught a 24 inch walleye with a Lamprey attached, and my other buddy caught a rod and reel. This all happened within about an hour. You just never know."
2983233,Larry S,2014-07-10 11:49:00,665,"This past June my sister finally went on her first fly-in trip . We went to the wonderful Kearns Lake outpost owned by Thousand Lakes Outposts out of Thunder Bay. You can read the report posted by Phishfearme on Walleye Central. One night my sister and I were fishing in a shallow bay jigging for walleyes when she had a hit on a jig w/ a powerbait tail on it. She set the hook and started reeling the fish in, almost immediately her rod bent over doubled into the water,since we had been catching numerous large pike this trip while fishing for walleyes we figured that she had hooked a large pike. She keep on reeling and a walleye of about 17 inches poked its head out of the water hooked in the upper lip ,as the head of the walleye came out of the water a large very long brownish thing was coming out of the water hooked to the lower jaw teeth of the walleye. My sister brought the fish over to me and I grabbed the brownish object which was extremely heavy and completely full of mud, muck and water. I then proceeded to dip it up and down in the water getting rid of most of the mud/water. I then grabbed it, twisted it and wrung out most of the water bringing it into the boat. Upon inspection and laying it out on the boats bottom we saw that it was a large, hooded sweatshirt We took it back to camp and the next day layed it on the deck to let the sun dry it out. When we came back later it was dryed out and you could faintly see the logo on it. On the front of it was in large letter PACKERS, below was the large G and below that in large letters GREEN BAY Since our other four friends on this trip are STEELER fans, and I'm a big BEARS fan it was only logical that my sister who is a PACKER fan ,and lives in Wisconsin should be the person to catch this sweatshirt."
2983257,tooski,2014-07-10 11:56:00,393,Great story Larry. Only way it could have been better is if it was a Steelers jersey and the owner was still in it..
2983265,Larry S,2014-07-10 12:07:00,665,Here is my sister and the Packers sweatshirt she pulled out of Kearns Lake attached to the bottom jaw of a walleye
2983297,Larry S,2014-07-10 12:31:00,665,"Don't Go Too hard on these Steeler Fans Tooski. Although their taste in drinks(Gin Martinis) isn't to my liking As you can see my sister and I were drinking, refreshing gin and tonics"
2983337,phishfearme,2014-07-10 12:40:00,1242,"and now the bay where Pat hauled in this trophy is call ""Sweatshirt Bay"" to be marked on all future Kearns Lake maps. phish"
2983369,1shooter,2014-07-10 12:49:00,1493,The bottom of a lake is a perfect place for a Packers jersey.
2983505,SinOrSwim,2014-07-10 13:14:00,1528,I'm just glad you took that toxic pollutant out of the lake.
2983561,Rlcrouse,2014-07-10 13:30:00,286,The fish probably don't smell funny anymore.
2983569,Blades-n-Beads,2014-07-10 13:34:00,484,I knew Jimmy Hoffa was a packer fan!! Lol. Great story
2983657,stumcfar,2014-07-10 13:46:00,451,The story is that fish never smelled until Packer fans started swimming!
