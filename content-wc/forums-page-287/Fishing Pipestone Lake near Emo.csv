I have fished the NW Arm of Pipestone Lake many, many times and never been disappointed. In fact, I wish I was there right now! There are so many good areas to catch lake trout that I couldn't begin to try to tell you about all of them here. Use your electronics to find these areas and be sure to pay close attention to water temperature! I mean the water temperature that the main forage species prefer. The main forage species in Pipestone would probably be ciscoes. My old fishing buddy, Glen Erbe, used to say that the ciscoes don't go looking for lake trout so they can be eaten! Ciscoes prefer a temperature of 50 degrees so that was where we started. At the time of year that you are going, you should be able to find that at 25-30 feet of water. Usually we would put on a 1 1/2 oz rubber core sinker and our favorite Rebel stickbait 18"" below it. We also used to use Sutton spoons. Lake trout are usually suckers for anything bright and shiny. Any lure that is plated with a precious metal(gold or silver) work better in this regard because they will reflect light at a greater distance. Williams Lures, the Canadian outfit, make the best lures plated with precious metal. Jigging would be another option. Use a 1 oz jig. You can use any color you want as long as it's white. Dress your jig with a nice, stinky hunk of frozen ciscoe and you should be good to go. If you want to be absolutely sure of your success, you better take me along as your unpaid, volunteer guide! For which, I would happily volunteer! 1DIRTBALL"

My son caught a 30 inch walleye last summer. Big walleyes, not huge numbers but big fish. Lakers are abundant. Beautiful fish. Another guy came across a monster musky with a 34 inch lake trout that it had T-boned, still in its mouth. They got close to look at it and the musky let the fish go. It was injured but not dead, they netted it. Sure tasted good! Babe Winkleman just did a show on late fall walleyes on Pipestone. That musky must have been over 55 inches long. The 34 inch laker looked less than half of its size when it was in its mouth. Unreal. Its really clear water. Love it up there. Cedar Island Lodge treated us really well. Todd and Carrie are super hosts."
