3717946,ToxicAngler,2015-04-01 10:36:00,30,"Prov1800, you guide on Lac Seul? What's your recommendation on the topic?"
3718306,Limeyangler,2015-04-01 12:27:00,563,x2 and you get the walleye fishing of Lac Seul which in my opinion is better than Eagle.
3719450,NARDA 1,2015-04-01 18:18:00,636,"You can do a one day fly-in if you want. Just have Marcel call Bob at Wilderness Air and have him take you to Scumpy, huge pike and nice walleye."

For a small fee (a rye or two) I could be talked into making up some wings!"
3720002,P&y only,2015-04-01 20:53:00,133,"I fished Eagle for 3 or 4 years. Then tried a few other places. We caught fish on Eagle, but I won't be going back any time soon."

3720946,ToxicAngler,2015-04-02 09:05:00,30,"Hey NARDA, you know anything about the wilderness trips? Lakes, what to expect, ect.? Like I said in a previous post, my time on Eagle was strictly in the West Arm. We did ok walleye fishing, never had 100 fish days but couple 30-50 days, how's the Eye fishing in the big part of the lake? I know I'd have easy access to the west arm but most my spots are at the far end. Musky were tough over there. My group caught 45, 42, 48, & 53""ers in 7 yrs, We were pretty novice to muskies at that time also. Saw plenty more and missed 2-50""+. I've heard the waters stained on the big portion. Gotta be a little easier over there. If you can say Muskies are ever ""easy"". Guess easier would be a better choice of words."
3714538,Danbear,2015-03-31 11:38:00,72,"While I have never fished Lac Seul, I have fished Eagle Lake 8 years and it has more than met our wants and needs. There are plenty of muskys to go around. I like the west arm in late August and always stay at Birch Dale Lodge. You can't beat Marcels hospitality and the food is always top notch. God luck where ever you go."
3715074,Fisher-man,2015-03-31 13:28:00,422,"I have fished both and would not bother with Eagle again. I havent spent much time on the western end of Lac Seul. But there are no surprises and really no secrets. Islands, humps, points and channels. If you can find a channel between a couple islands when the wind blows, anchor up and hang on!I would not waste one single day chasing Muskie. You will need special gear, and some knowledge of where to look, and your boys can throw a thousand casts apiece and will be lucky to get a ""follow"". Fishing for walleye you will almost certainly tie into a few 35"" plus northerns that will get their blood pounding.Have fun!,"
3715434,NARDA 1,2015-03-31 15:18:00,636,"ToxicAngler, check out The Wilderness adventure that BirchDale Lodge offers on their web site. Would be a fun and memorable day trip for your boys. I first took that trip 27 years ago and we still talk about it! This Musky was caught while jigging for Walleye about 15 minutes from the lodge. As Danbear said, Marcel will take great care of you. What time of year are you planning to go? Terry"
3715618,Shotgun,2015-03-31 16:35:00,759,"In the evening right in Rat Bay where the lodge is located cast some spoons or troll some lures along the bank straight out across the bay from the lodge. We've caught some really nice pike, which as your aware are fun to net. And when it gets dark your right close to home. Good luck!"
3715722,ToxicAngler,2015-03-31 17:00:00,30,"You guy's aren't making this an easy decision. Lol. I've looked at the wilderness adventure they offer and there's no doubt the boy's would love it. The gf & I did a fly-in a couple years ago & you can't beat the feeling of solitude, which I'm sure that trip gives you the same feeling. Im a fairly avid Ski chaser so I have all the necessary equipment. Probably more than one guy needs, but I continue to buy baits. My gf says I'm an addict. Seriously guys, thanks for all the help and your tips/advice is greatly appreciated! We'll head up in September with confidence no matter which place we choose to go. If its not asking to much, any coordinates of proven spots would be a blessing. If not I understand. Tight lines boys!"

People who are giving you recommendations have fished the same spots for years....you haven't and your results will not be the same. Lac Seul, Eagle, Lake of the Woods......whatever you choose do your due diligence."

The owner Linda Rice has a musky WR and her partner Greg just caught his 50th musky over 50"" last summer. Linda caught three over 50"" in her first two trips last summer."

3713034,ToxicAngler,2015-03-31 06:17:00,30,"Hey guys,Need some help/opinions on were to go for my annual trip to NW Ontario this year. I've narrowed it down to either Lac Seul or Eagle lake. I've found a lodge on both bodies of water that is within my budget and both seem to be reputable resorts. Never fished Lac before but have heard nothing but good things. I've fished Eagle but limited to the west arm. I'll be taking my 2 boys &amp; want the best possible trip for them. Any ideas, advice, opinions are welcome. Aaannnddd, GO!"
3713066,ToxicAngler,2015-03-31 06:27:00,30,We'll be staying at lac seul lodge or birchdale on Eagle. Fyi
3713138,Shotgun,2015-03-31 06:45:00,759,"ToxicAngler, I can't speak for Birchdale/Eagle. But have fished out of Lac Seul Lodge and will be there again in August. You can't go wrong. Nice lodge and owners. Only downside for Lac Seul is watch for the rocks out in the lake as you can come up on them very quick. Enjoy the trip with the boys no matter where you go."
3713178,v-bay gord,2015-03-31 06:52:00,3168,Lac Seul is a hard to beat walleye factory....Eagle has a more diverse fishery. Which ever you choose I would suggest a guide for a few days. Here's two if you go the Eagle route. www.eagleeyeguiding.com or www.calritchie.com
3713314,ftfarms,2015-03-31 07:16:00,444,I've fished both lakes. Eagle only twice and lac suel several times. In my opinion lac suel is a better walleye lake for numbers and size. Eagle is better for variety The big thing I don't like about lac suel is to many boats want to fish right next to you. It's a big body of water and lots of good places to fish it just don't make sense to me. Anyway both can be great fishing. Have a fun safe trip with your sons and god bless.
3713354,leachmin&worm,2015-03-31 07:21:00,32,"Fished Eagle and Lac Seul. Eagle is a deep lake with diversity. Lake Seul is a shallow lake, better suited for walleye, Large Northern and smallies when you can locate them. I really enjoyed Lac Seul. Much more structure, islands and yes submerged rock piles(both a blessing and a curse). Most resorts on Lac Seul are very good. Its good competition. Suggest Lac Seul Lodge for a good and fair price point. Hope this helps."

3714434,ToxicAngler,2015-03-31 11:14:00,30,"Thanks everyone for the info! Seems that everyone feels Lac is a better walleye lake, which will be the main focus, but both the boys are totally interested in musky fishing. What's your opinion on the Ski's on the Lac? I know they're tough on Eagle."
