There are at least three camps - Erringtons Wilderness Island in the north end; and Camp Lochlash and Loch Island Lodge in the south end. The latter two are operated by the same owners. They also have two additional outpost camps (Sandy Bay and Otter Island) on the south end of the lake near there two camps. I believe there are also some private cottages."
