3712578,Fisher-man,2015-03-30 21:42:00,422,"I have a hard time understanding the *****ing about Mahkwa. It's a fishing camp. We go there to fish. Roger and Doris have always been great to us. The cabins are warm and dry, with a stove to cook breakfast and dinner. That's all we are looking for. If there was another camp on that end of the lake we would investigate it, but there isn't. We've stayed in just about every cabin there, and I just don't have any complaints. We catch too many fish, and too many big fish. But, then we elk hunt out of a tent, so maybe our expectations are a little lower."
3715658,NLpike,2015-03-31 16:48:00,28,"Sorry, I've been going to Mahkwa for a long time and I don't know Doris or Roger. The manager of that camp is Evelyn. She is one nasty lady. Three years ago she had us in a cabin that didn't have water, the toilet was sitting in the front yard and there was a rat the size of a possum in the tub/shower. She was pissed off when we complained.This isn't an issue about tenting vs cabins. This is an issue of money. They charge top dollar for cabins that leak, don't have heat, and lack basic plumbing. If you are in a tent you can hang your *** over a log. Not the case when you are 6 guys in a cabin surrounded by 10 other cabins. If they charged tent prices, I would have no problem. You are comparing apples to zebras."
3533434,Duflebag,2015-02-11 15:28:00,218,"I have fished Lac Seul that time of year for a couple decades. The others have pretty much hit it on the head. You will be fishing mid-lake humps and reefs for the most part. Most fish will be 20 to 35 feet deep. Jig and minnows and live bait rigs will be just about all you need. 1/4 to a few 1/2 oz jigs. Using 1/4 oz as much as you can, going higher as the winds dictate. Live bait rigs can be used with soft bottom, jigs for rocky areas. Absolute best time of the year to fish Lac Seul. Big fish eating everything they can find. Fish an area until the fish turn off then just search for another group of hungry fish. All fish kept must be dead, no live well so bring ice."
3536066,LoDo,2015-02-12 10:50:00,721,"+1 here! LS is an excellent fishery anytime of year. So many spots throughout the 120+ miles of water. Onaway IMO is the best resort on the lake. We used to stay there annually back in the early 2000s. I like the resorts south of Ear Falls as it seems closer to McKenzie Bay. We fished McKenzie a ton. As of 2008 we started to do a fly-in to Woodland Caribou Prov Park west of Red Lake, Ontario. Cheers,"
3541714,5ofDiamonds,2015-02-13 22:18:00,5,Lac Seul has a great fishery. The Ear Falls end of the lake has some good outfitter options.
3548818,John N,2015-02-16 08:26:00,362,Ever fish NW Ontario before? You're in for a treat.
3587066,Fisher-man,2015-02-26 10:47:00,422,"We have gone multiple times in September, but we fish the east side of the lake. We stay at Mahkwa Resort. It is owned by the first nation tribe, but is well run. They have both American Plan and housekeeping units. And the fishing on the east side of the lake has seemed better to us than the west. We only fished the west side once, and we caught a lot of fish, but not a lot of big fish. On the east side we have had many days where we had a **** of a time trying to find walleyes in the slot. Everything we cuaght was 22"" plus. Nice problem to have! As far as where to fish. Islands, reefs and channels. We have caught them in 8-30' of water that time of year. We always hit a spot, start at 30' and work our way in...the fish are always there. If you run into runts, move. We rarely found year classes mixed together on a point. Runts were always with runts, and big fish also seemed to school together, too. Good luck. It is a great fishery."
3697449,NLpike,2015-03-27 03:55:00,28,"Wow, I've been going there for 7 years and the last thing I would say about it is that it's ""well run"". The place is a mess. The cabins, with the exception of the one they built 2 years ago, should all be torn down and burned. The manager of the place is unfriendly, unmotivated and about as close to incompetent as you can get.We have put up with their BS year after year because it's the best spot on that lake. Never again. They now charge docking fees for a broken dock. They have increased their prices but the cabins are not fixed. They can't answer mail, e-mail or a phone. They don't belong in business."
3699882,Lake Wisconsin,2015-03-27 12:36:00,1960,Looks like I will be heading to Ear Falls/Lac Seul in Sept as well. Anyone know much about Golden Eagle Resort? This will be a cast and blast.
3701898,Guest,2015-03-27 22:02:00,0,"HI. the wife and I went up there in September and we were the only ones in camp. the lake was deserted, yes the whole lake of lac saul. we did catch some big walleyes but it was cold. we put on every piece of clothes we brought up with us. long underware, overalls ,sweaters, jckets. just able to move. good luck"
3709234,Aspencreek,2015-03-29 21:54:00,2911,"Really...well run, nice camp??? Been there only once and would NEVER even consider it again. You come all the way from Colorado and stay there??? You need to explore your options, so many other very good camps at a lot less than what you are paying. Just a note, what you are describing about the fishing is the same as I experience too, without putting up with the ""Mahkwa"" experience."
3709338,NLpike,2015-03-30 02:23:00,28,"My sentiments exactly. When you are driving 20 hours to get somewhere you would like to have a nice friendly welcome and a habitable cabin to stay in. You won't get either at Mahkwa. I have never stayed in the American Plan rooms, but I've seen them and the common room, not worth it. The cabins are not worth the money. The only good thing is the fuel and the live bait."
3528514,Sportdog,2015-02-10 13:16:00,6735,"......and I know nothing about this fishery other than it's supposed to be good. It will be in the second week of September and would like some input on the general walleye locations this time of year, the best techniques, the weather, the insects, or just anything you would care to tell about this place. Thank You."
3528538,JDP,2015-02-10 13:23:00,1457,Please let us know what part of the lake you are headed to.Western...closer to Ear Falls? Do you have the name of the resort or lodge?Thanks.
3528738,Whopper,2015-02-10 14:03:00,340,You need to change your user name to Luckydog
3528866,SinOrSwim,2015-02-10 14:29:00,1528,"All I know is I hope the fishing is AWESOME when you are there. Big Pigs abound!!!!!! Did I mention we will be on Lac Seul the second week also? Weather. Good luck. We go the same general time and two years ago, I put on long sleeves one time the whole trip other than the ride out in the morning. Last year, was pretty chilly. Not cold, but chilly. Bugs are almost a non-factor. But, be prepared just in case.Walleye will be on mid lake humps and in deeper structure. 25 to 40 fow.People will need to know where you are staying. East or West. The lake is 120+ miles long. A LOT of hidden rocks. If you have GPS mark and keep your lines for safe travels back and future runs."
3528882,Carnhzkr,2015-02-10 14:34:00,964,"You wouldn't have to ask me twice to go to LS in September. That's a beautiful time to go to what is, in my opinion, the top inland walleye lake in Ontario for the combination of size and numbers. Bugs should be pretty much a non-factor, unless you go for an evening stroll through the woods. LS is about 120 miles long, so fishing conditions can vary depending upon location, but that time of year walleye will likely still be holding on mid-lake structure. Look for reefs and drop-offs that are adjacent to deeper water. Once you find a nice reef, use your electronics to locate fish and zero in on a target depth. You'll love it!"
3529506,bigwalleye1,2015-02-10 17:21:00,2632,"Set a departure date or you will not want to leave Canada. As others have said, location will help us help you. That said, the bugs are nonexistent, the fish are hungry, and classic fall structure, sunken islands near shore, windy points that fall to deep water, and inside turns. Move fast. Find fish and stay ontil they quit, then move. Do not leave fish to find fish, but if they're not biting where you are know they will be biting elsewhere. Once you find the key depth, it will be pretty close across the whole area so long as conditions are the same. I've seen the same spots produce for days."
3530370,Sportdog,2015-02-10 22:10:00,6735,"Several have asked where I will be going. Well the lodge has yet to be booked but the possible destinations are Goose Bay Lodge, Onaway Lodge, Fisherman Cove, or Lac Suel Lodge. I know nothing about where these places are located on the body of water. According to my contact September bookings are fairly easy to get. I don't know much about this."
3530722,vaquero01,2015-02-11 06:35:00,101,Goose bay is up in Ear Falls. I hauled some Wisconsin guy back there from McKenzie Bay last year. Looks like a nice camp. Fishermans's Cove and Onaway are on the same lake that has access to Lac Suel. We have been at Onaway the last two years and will be there from Aug 28 thru Sept 11 this year. All but one cabin are new. The grounds are very nice and the fish house is outstanding. Great dock. Boats are 17.5 Outfitters and the motors are 50 horse Hondas. It is about 17 miles south of Ear Falls with easy access to good fishing. I hear good things about Fishermans Cove and have driven thru the camp and looked at it from the water. It is right around the corner from Onaway. I like Onaway better. Blair and Kathy are good people.
3531146,Pooch,2015-02-11 07:51:00,4619,"Have fished out of a couple of the mentioned camps. All are decent camps. Where you want to fish kind of determines which camp.We fish a Labor Day trip to LS each year and some years we are in shorts and T shirt while others we are dressed like snowmobiling. Since these are drive in camps, take extra clothes for foul weather. Just in case. Even a passion for fishing can't make cold and wet fun.Canada is pretty at that time of year as the softwoods are either showing a lot of yellow or dropping leaves. The color contrast between the pines and softwood trees is sometimes really striking and pretty. Lakes look very different at that time of the year. Every year on that trip I always get the dark primal feeling of doom (winter) setting in. Get the urge to hoard acorns.....Have a great trip and report back for us this fall.Pooch"
3531186,SinOrSwim,2015-02-11 08:04:00,1528,We are going to miss you again. We arrive on the 11th. Leave some fish and preferrably GPS coordinates of your good spots. Could be just me but we used to go late Aug to early Sept and used to pack for cold weather. Now we go early to mid-september consistently and it seems warm weather is the norm. We see some fall colors but not nearly as much as one would think. Still a lot of green. Still a great time of year to go. There are a couple spots in the bay where Onaway is and some spots in the Bay of Islands. Weather permitting we like to go out past Mantiba point though. A couple of tricky areas with rocks though.Our group is pretty much jig and minnow or bait rigs.
