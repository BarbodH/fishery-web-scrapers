3729746,zeebee,2015-04-04 21:36:00,1144,"If you plan on doing a series of fly-ins Id suggest investing in a couple of two piece rods. Those that claim there is a material difference in performance are deceiving themselves. Id love to be able to blindfold you and place both rods in your hand. Bet you are wrong 50% of the time. The myth that 2 piece rods are somehow inferior has been repeated ad nauseam to the point that people start to believe it without having really conducted a fair field test. All but one of my rods are now 2 piece and I travel at ease. Pilots see my two piece rods, smile and crack jokes about guys taking their 1 piece rods on fly-ins."
3738074,Baseline,2015-04-07 05:14:00,3207,"About 20 years ago I purchased an expandable tube rod case with handle. 6 rods can comfortably fit in this case. It has traveled on Canadian Fly-in, Hawaii, Alaska and all over the mid-west. Money well spent as far as I'm concerned. Outpost trips are expensive and I'm going take the rods I want to fish with. I don't give a rip about what some bush pilot thinks. I've never heard a wisecrack, but if I did, he would fly out of there without a tip. It's been my experience that resort owners understand their customers, are equipped to handle fishing rods and are happy to do so."
3745442,pike50plus,2015-04-08 18:12:00,584,As long as the rods are bundled tip to end by 2's and then bundled as a set that will wrok fine. Also wrap socks or bubble rap around the high spots to extra protect the eyelets. Even the biggest flambeau will buckle at the seem where the flap is.
3745626,forgop,2015-04-08 18:58:00,880,"I did get.a nice rod tube off craigslist for $40 a couple of years ago. Normally it was over $100 and still had tags. I think we fit 12 rods in there with no difficulty. I believe the weight on it is about 12 lbs. After 2 trips, I'm going to 2 pc rods and not having such a large ""footprint"" in my vehicle for a 12 hour drive."
3746426,Draco1206,2015-04-09 04:05:00,175,"Wow! A little ""touchy"" there aren't we? "" $200 junk""? I bet the four rods I take on my fly-in don't cost $200 for all of them together and I bet I catch just as many fish. And I don't cry when I break one. I find it funny that someone that thinks a rod that costs less than $200 is ""junk"" but won't spend a couple hundred dollars on a good rod case. Your PVC rod case is a great idea, my son built his own while I've had a store bought one for 25 years and they both work great. I like the fact that mine extends for longer one piece rods and can be collapsed for two piece or shorter one piece rods. You can't do that with a rigid PVC pipe. One other thing, a $50 composite rod today is a thousand times better than any rod built 25 years ago and we did pretty good with those old fiberglass rods. A good drag on your reel is more important than any rod. Give me a good drag and I'll land any fish with the cheapest rod. I'm not knocking anyone that likes expensive quality equipment. It's like the difference between a BMW and Ford Focus. Both get you to where you want to go, but one gets you there in ""style""."
3688946,bthomas3333,2015-03-24 21:34:00,465,"Hey Guys, In another chain folks are talking about the difficulty of getting their spinning rods into a fly-in camp in the proper number of pieces. A couple years ago I found on the St. Croix website that they have their own brand of travel rod cases. (Link below) I bought a pair of cases for my Dad and I. We have used these for several fly-in trips and so far they hold up really well. Even the airlines haven't damaged the rods or cases. I have used the cases with St. Croix rods and some other brands and everything i have fits fine.http://stcroixrods.com/shop/rod-cases-sacks/ Brett"
3692514,kayakmatt,2015-03-25 19:31:00,105,"As generally dislike 2 piece rods, but over the years I have found some decent economical ones. I now bring 4 spinning and 1 casting 2 piece rods in a 5"" diameter poster tube cut to about 40"" long to accommodate 6'6"" rods. All this to save $35 (not $25,as this is considered my ""second bag"") each way airline bag fee. Figure if I travel with them enough (sometimes twice a year), the savings will pay for the rods. I carry the rod tube on the plane, and it will roll to the the back of the overhead, and still allow room for myself or someone else to put a suitcase or duffel in front of it.I've dolled up the cardboard rod tube by putting a plastic handle from a large laundry detergent box (powder), and coating waterproof sealer like you would spray your rain gear to increase its repellancy. At least I know that I will handle the rods and get them to Canada in two pieces"
3694226,rocko0305,2015-03-26 09:15:00,138,"I prefer 1 piece rods, but on our fly-in trips, I usually bring 3-4 1-piece rods, and 2 2-piece rods.I was going to purchase a rod case, but at $60+, I decided to my own instead. It fits at least 10 rods, is lightweight, and only cost me about $8 to make.I got a section of the corrugated irrigation tubing from Home Depot, except the kind I got has a smooth black interior and a fairly smooth white exterior. (http://www.homedepot.com/p/Advanced-...2?N=5yc1vZbv13) So, in reality, I guess it's not corrugated at all. I cut that at the store to a length of about 7' 2"". I also purchased 2 end caps for it. I glued one end cap on one end. The other end cap is removable, and I just use duct tape to keep it in place during the drive and flight. I also went an extra step and put soft foam on the inside of the caps to protect the rod tips. Works great, and after having been on 2 fly-in trips with it, I am glad I made it."
3694266,bigwalleye1,2015-03-26 09:20:00,2632,"I've seen several folks do a similar rod tube as rocko with 3 in or 4 in sched 40 PVC and end caps. You can about jump on them and not hurt em, and, as rocko indicated, parts are pretty cheap. I've seen folks use rod slicks or cheap nylon rod socks to separate rods in the tube."
3698729,MrSimon,2015-03-27 08:37:00,922,"I use a document tube (like an architect would use) that I got on Amazon for around $15. It's super light weight, adjustable, has a carrying strap, and will fit four rods. It's not all THAT sturdy, but it will do just fine for long car trips and flights to an outpost. I wouldn't trust it to be loaded in the belly of a commercial plane."
3698745,MrSimon,2015-03-27 08:42:00,922,"My buddy built one from the corrugated drain pipe material mentioned earlier in the thread. It was really cheap and is super solid. It will hold a bunch of rods and is surprisingly light weight. It weights about as much as a cardboard tube, but its really strong. You could stand on it with no problems. He glued in a plastic cap on the bottom and used a tension fit screw cap for the top. It's pretty much the perfect rod case."
3703514,forgop,2015-03-28 13:49:00,880,The last outfitter I flew with isn't very fond of such cases because they're so bulky and difficult to get tucked in for the smaller planes. They said they load the fishing poles last and on top and have never had a single pole break on them as a result. Doesn't mean a rod tube wouldn't be a bad idea while you transport it on the road.

3728210,bthomas3333,2015-04-04 11:19:00,465,Ok. Seems like the consensus is cheap durable PVC pipe or similar.So at 3a when you pick up your 4th buddy who wants to jam 'one more' rod into the PVC pipe/case you...#1. Let him and wind up with a bent eye on your $200 rod#2. Tell him no and he jams the rod in the suburban and when someone gets out of the car they break off his tip.#3. Tell him to leave the 3rd rod at homeI've tried had all three of the above happen. I guess to me as we get older and spend more on rods it makes sense to have our own compact cases. Unless you guys are driving / flying with 4 guys PVC pipes on the roof?Just saying...bob
3729242,fishman10,2015-04-04 19:04:00,226,"no one has said that we are trying to jam 14 rods into a piece of PVC, DID WE???????? We are simply stating that there is no need to spend large amounts of money on a rod case that serves the same purpose. bTW, I steelhead fish the world over using top of the line equipment, not $200 junk, and have had my share of broken rods from airlines. This is THE most durable case out there. Question: do you own a tackle store?"
