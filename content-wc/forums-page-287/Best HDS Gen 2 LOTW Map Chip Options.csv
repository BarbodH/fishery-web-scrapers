3726706,Obabikon,2015-04-03 21:26:00,2370,"I'm not sure about HDS chips... but the standard Lowrance chip is the same mapping for GEN 2's as the Lake Master for the Gen 1's was. I think its the insight pro, but it has come with every unit I have ever purchased. I assume that would be the same for HDS"
3727106,ftfarms,2015-04-04 05:40:00,444,I have the Navionics with premium hot maps and I like that. It works real well. It's the Lake Canada edition. I have a hds touch 9 gen 2 I'm not 100% but I thought what worked in the gen one was supposed to work in the two.
3731442,KM1,2015-04-05 09:31:00,374,"Navionics+ Chip for North America. The one you join for 99$ and can then upload new data as many times as you want for one year...provided by any updates to the map and actual fisherman information from individuals fishing the lake who send their mapping to Navionics. You should only upload data for the lakes you fish or want to fish, one at a time, as you need them, as the chip does have a limit and once it is full...that is it....no more on that chip. For me...with the advantage of getting very current data on say LOTW...it is the best way to go."
3732450,KHedquist,2015-04-05 16:18:00,4367,"Go with the Navionics + with SonarCharts, you will want a Navionics chip with SonarCharts much more detail. Hot maps Premium does not have SonarCharts, the best way to describe SonarCharts is to go to the Navionics website click on the web app at the top of the page and zoom in on your area and them click on the SonarIcon for the SonarCharts layer. Hotmaps Platinum will also have SonarCharts and the North Chip covers LOTW, Hotmaps is a plug n play card and Nav+ you download the areas that you wan on the card"
3734194,Flag Island,2015-04-06 06:18:00,32,Instead of going south all the way to Gardner I would tell you to try around Skeet Island. Lots of big water around it and the walleyes will hang around because of the bait fish. Also for the past two years I have only used frozen shiners and frozen chubs for bait all season long. They keep well and we catch as many fish as anyone else. You can buy chubs frozen and salted in 1/2 or 1 gallon lots very reasonable and bring them thru the border with no issues.
