3727602,P&y only,2015-04-04 08:39:00,133,Two guys fishing exact same jig setup. same presentation. same boat. same day. Boat catches 100 walleyes. What ratio do YOU think the catch will be from what you've seen? Example: 60 minnows/ 40 crawlers. Just curious how others think the two baits stack up.
3727634,Pooch,2015-04-04 08:45:00,4619,"Winner would change from day to day or even hour by hour, but if I had my choice of either and could only take one bait? It would be the minnows followed closely by a leech.Guys will argue both ways.Pooch"
3727674,P&y only,2015-04-04 08:54:00,133,"Pooch, I agree with the hour by hour statement. We take crawlers up with us because they're cheaper and easier to keep alive. But we always buy minnows for variety and to help the camp owners be profitable. (we wanna come back) Some days it's one some days the other. But it seems like minnows have a slight advantage overall where we fish.I did find a surprise bait in my bucket once though. There were 2 tadpoles in the bucket of minnows I bought. He went to dig em out and I said, leave em in there. Maybe they aren't allowed as bait, so., IF I had used them, i'd have to tell you they never made it to the bottom. either one. I look in the tank every time now but there haven't been any more."
3727914,fishman10,2015-04-04 09:49:00,226,"As stated above, it depends on time of year and body of water. Spring fall is minnow time. Summer is leach crawler time. I have fished gull rock, and worms simply didnt work that well, but lac surely, they love them. I live here, from personal experience this is my take.: in the heat of summer, I use worms and crawlers, why? Quite simply, they are easier to keep alive, and cheaper. I pick my own worms. The amount of fishing I do, I simply cannot afford to buy minnows. I bottom bounce almost exclusively, I use a spinner with 2 size 4 steelhead hooks tied 4 inches apart. The first hook goes into the head of the worm and the second 1 inch from the end of the worm. With this method, I have a 90 percent hookup ratio. Worms hooked this way provide a large site picture with lots of scent. I swear by this method. Leeches will catch bigger fish. I never use minnows in the summer Good fishing"
3727970,Crede,2015-04-04 10:04:00,134,For primarily vertically jigging or casting/retrieving jigs: In May-June I think that minnows overall are somewhat better than worms. The guy I usually fish with thinks that minnows are much superior then. We agree that from July on it varies back and forth depending on the day. My uncle believes that worms are always just as good throughout the season and seems to catch just as many as whoever else is in the boat using minnows. My oldest son thinks that leeches are just as good as anything else throughout the season and seems to prove it on each Ontario trip. Hope this clears things up.
3728194,38bill,2015-04-04 11:18:00,331,"In this order: Minnows, leeches, crawlers and we always fish in late July. That said I don't mess too much with minnows because they are expensive and a pain in the butt to keep alive. Plus a minnow isn't much good for more than a single bite so they go fast. Leeches are not too expensive by the pound, easy to store and keep and you can get several fish per leech. Crawlers are fairly cheap (by the flat) but a little harder to keep (as they take up more space with the bedding and need to be kept cool). We used to bring in leeches but then fished many years with crawlers after the import ban. Once we could get local leeches in bulk we started using them side by side with the crawlers and they were way better. Maybe not as good as live minnows but we catch plenty of fish."
3728218,Aspencreek,2015-04-04 11:19:00,2911,"The answer to your question has been answered by the previous posters, IT DEPENDS! Time of year, water temps, mood of the fish at the time. But to add my 2 cents, my experience has been that the bigger fish I have caught was on nightcrawlers behind a bottom bouncer or slip bobbering or any other way to let it sit close to the bottom and let the worm do all the work, but not as many in pure numbers. Leeches during certain time of the year are the hot tip, but they cost $$$. Minnows are good anytime in just about any type of presentation. Fun problem to have isn't it."
3730722,labsrus,2015-04-05 07:27:00,557,"Like others have said, worms are less expensive and easier to care for. We have been using gulp imitation minnows. For perch minnows always do better"
3734154,bigwalleye1,2015-04-06 06:12:00,2632,"All depends on who's fishing minnows and who's fishing crawlers. Give a hot stick with confidence, superior equipment and ""on the ball"" a sub-par bait and he'll do better than a hung-over, not enough coffee, not relaly excited to be here, average equipment stick with superior bait. What I'm saying is that bait is one small part of a bigger picture. So is standing in the back corner of a big 'ol Pro-V, running the trolling motor, standing over the transducer and looking right at the sounder while the partner is flying blind in the bow. Give the confident hot stick with the electronic and equipment edge the hot color and hot bait for the moment, and he'll bury every boat in the party. It's that whole ""Man, Moment and Machine"" thing. Al lthat said, I'll go through the additional effort to keep my minnows comfortable until it's time to put them into the fight."
3735306,billy weaver,2015-04-06 11:23:00,470,"I usually have both in the boat and use both equally. I take a flat of nightcrawlers with us to Canada and like to fish deeper water with a nightcrawler rig and bottom bouncer in times when the walleye are deep. When you are on a school of walleye they can chew up a bunch of minnows at 40 cents a piece fast. At times like that I use a half a nightcrawler on a jig or plastic. When the fishing is slow I usually have a minnow on as I am more confident of finding fish, but that is just me."
