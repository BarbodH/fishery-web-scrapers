3727498,bigwillies,2015-04-04 08:06:00,515,route also has easy access.4x4 is handy as u r basically luanching of a beach(kinda like williams bay)the walleyes look cool out of that lake too.
3727658,Rock Lobstar1,2015-04-04 08:53:00,134,Where on Route? Is it the parking area by where the road crosses the railroad tracks?
3727834,bigwillies,2015-04-04 09:38:00,515,yes.that is the only public access to the lake.
3727962,Rock Lobstar1,2015-04-04 10:00:00,134,"Ah ok, right on. I took a drive up there and had a look last week but it was hard to tell because of the ice and snow still. Good to know its launchable there. Thanks!"
3724586,Rock Lobstar1,2015-04-03 09:15:00,134,"I moved to Dryden a couple years ago and just recently purchased a boat and would like to explore the area more. I am curious about a couple lakes north of Dryden and how they can be accessed. They are Route Lake and Thaddeus lake. Is there any public place to launch a boat on these lakes? Or just the private ones owned by the lodges on each lake? I have a 16 foot lund with 90hp motor so I can't exactly hand bomb it through tje bush, kinda looking for a half assed ramp at least."
3724658,JayM5209,2015-04-03 09:41:00,1050,"There is a launch site on the road that runs north and crosses the creek between Thaddeus and Ord Lakes. I've put my 16' Lund in there twice. Go up stream (east) to Thaddeus or downstream (west) into Ord. Don't know if you've fished Ord, but after June 15 when the fish sanctuary opens, I think Ord's Puzzle Bay is some of the best walleye fishing in NW Ontario. Sorry I can't give you the names of the roads you'll need to use, but I'm sure some of the local folks who frequently help us out on Walleye Central will chip in to provide more detailed info."
3724834,Rock Lobstar1,2015-04-03 10:21:00,134,"Excellent info, thanks! I just looked on a map and see the road you are talking about. When you say it's a creek that runs between the two lakes, how deep are you talking?"
3725282,JayM5209,2015-04-03 12:58:00,1050,"I have a Lund 1625 Rebel with just a 50 hp 2 stroke Merc and have always seen enough water in the creek to easily navigate through. I'm sure the depth fluctuates, depending on the general water levels in Thaddeus that year. If you launch into the creek and go westward - just a short haul - to Ord, you go under the road through a very large corrugated steel tube. Plenty of room width wise and for headroom. The Thaddeus Lake camp has a heavy rope strung through this passage so folks can pull themselves through if they don't want to motor through. I usually get to Ord from the west - April Road off Hwy. 105 just south of Cliff and Cedar Lakes. Over many years I've almost always seen Thaddeus Lake camp boats fishing in Ord when I've been there, so the creek passage is not a big deal and folks from Thaddeus do it all season long."
3725522,Rock Lobstar1,2015-04-03 14:12:00,134,Perfect! I have a rebel 1650 so it should go no problem.
3725610,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-03 15:08:00,241,"I'm with JAYM5209, if you catch the wallys in puzzle bay when the sanctuary opens up, my oh my, 2 guys in a boat casting twister tails (any color really) 100 fish in 4 hours, NO JOKE! they stack up in there to spawn, and puzzle bay can be unfricking believable, hope you're there for opener!!..."
3725682,JayM5209,2015-04-03 15:21:00,1050,"Yep . . . . if I made a list of the ten best walleye fishing days I've enjoyed over the last 36 or 37 years, at least five of those days would have been in Puzzle Bay. Tons of beautiful jumbo perch can be found there, too."
3726018,elkman99,2015-04-03 17:12:00,180,"Jay, have you contacted many muskies in Ord? We will be on Cedar around Labor day weekend and thought about trailering over for a day."
3726146,Blue Lk,2015-04-03 17:48:00,269,"The road is an old railbed that used to go to Griffith mine north of Ear Falls,it meets up with the CN line at Amesdale,the road can be a pretty rough at times with lots of washboard. In low water years it can be hard to get through to Ord,the tunnel is really a large culvert that runs under the road."
3726770,JayM5209,2015-04-03 21:46:00,1050,"Elkman, I don't remember ever seeing a musky or hooking a musky in Ord Lake. Doesn't mean they aren't there, just haven't seen them. We do catch the incidental northern, but I don't fish for them either. Maybe someone who fishes Thaddeus can give you some info. on muskies in that lake. If it's worth a shot, it really isn't much of a run from the Ord landing into Thaddeus.Have you ever fished Cliff Lake? It happens to be one of my favorite lakes and we regularly catch muskies when trolling for lake trout or fishing for 'eyes. Again, I'm not a musky person, but Cliff has a good population, including some large fish. It would be very easy to drop your boat into Cliff at the small launch site on Hwy. 105 just down the road from Cedar.
