3738042,btyreprich,2015-04-07 04:46:00,1067,Bigdaddyguns: Would really appreciate your posting photos of how you attach the PVC tubes to the roof rack of your SUV. I am having a hard time drawing a picture of this set up based on your explanation. (It's just me getting old& not having my first cup of coffee yet as I type this.)
3738490,bigdaddyguns,2015-04-07 06:55:00,608,Yeah there is more going on there that can be described in a few words. Here are a couple of pictures that provides some more detail. First is a view of what the finished product looks like mounted on my vehicle. The second image is a parts/assembly view and how it attaches to the carrier rack. Let me know if you have any more questions.
3738498,btyreprich,2015-04-07 07:01:00,1067,Thanks for the photos. What are the turnbuckles made out of?
3738762,pjshorthorn,2015-04-07 07:43:00,5654,"My travel rod case is pretty simple and used for my two piece rods ( UL & ML) as I prefer to take them on the plane with me. This is the cardboard tube that my last UL rods were shipped in when I bought them from the rod manufacturer. I just repurposed the tube and it has served me well travleing on commercial flights. It fits in the overhead bin and/or closet on all aircraft from a ERJ/CRJ class on up. Easy to use on a fly in trip for sure. If I take my one piece rods, I have the standard PVC adjustable rod cases that can be bought at any sporting goods store. I'm a two piece rod fan for the type of fishing I do. You may notice in the pic that there is a 4 piece rod in a travel case hanging on the wall. I may need to break out that old Eagle Claw rod one day and see what she still has in her. PjShorthorn"

3739386,btyreprich,2015-04-07 10:25:00,1067,Got it! Thanks for the additional photos. This really helps me understand how your made the storage tubes and are attached to your SUV. Do you take the rods into your hotel room at night?
3739930,bigdaddyguns,2015-04-07 12:15:00,608,"Yes, it is easy to take off so keeping in the hotel room lets me sleep well at night :-) I thought about putting some safety/security device on it but those have limitations too. I just bring it in since all our fishing rods are in there."
3729394,fishman10,2015-04-04 19:39:00,226,"There are many different ways of transporting your fishing rods. What are yours? I have had many different cases over the years, for use in airplane travel as well as vehicle transport. Being a plumber , I now use a chunk of abs pipe. Why, cheap and very durable. I have used more expensive over the years, but for the money, there is no better bang for our buck. Try jumping on it or running it over with your truck and see what I mean. Do that with your expensive store bought case and see what happens. The number of rods will dictate the size of pipe you need to use, as you want things to fit snug. We first put a sock over the end of each rod and tape it secure. Both ends This prevents rattling and broken ends, tips. Then we will wrap each rod in a fabric sheet, ( bed sheet works well). 1 wrap is sufficient. This is to keep rods from hitting each other , knicking etc. and keeping them snug. Each rod is done the same way. Then with all the rods together, we slide them into the pipe , case. Not 1 at a time as eyes may get bent. If there is any void space in the end of the case, a piece of foam fills it nicely. There shouldn't be any rattling move,met etc. We have used this method for trips around the world and have not had any issues. Keep your hooks sharp and safe travels!"

3730098,btyreprich,2015-04-05 03:30:00,1067,Am very interested in this approach to transporting rods - especially since I no longer own a boat. Can you guys please tell me or even show me how these ABS tubes are attached securely to the roof racks of an SUV? Thanks
3730138,Draco1206,2015-04-05 04:34:00,175,A couple things that I do is to stack your rods so that the tip of each rod is attached to the butt of another rod. This will not only protect your rod tips but it keeps the rods more compact. I usually do this with two rods of similar length and then secure the tips to the butts with rubber bands and then the whole pack of rods together the same. You could also put cloth over them and tape them together but do not tape the rods together directly with tape or you can damage your rods when removing the tape. Make sure to turn your eyes in towards the center. Add foam or a couple towels stuffed in to keep them from banging around. I've put 10 rods in a 5 inch tube like this for years and never had a problem.
3730450,"6'3""",2015-04-05 06:40:00,47,"I have used a hard gun case for years. Of course it has to be 2-piece rods. My case is padded so everything is snug. Never had a problem at the border either, which I thought I might."
3730522,octanehi5,2015-04-05 07:03:00,1104,"Being an avid Walleye fisherman, I like my one piece rods, try to keep them under 6'6"", Transport in pvc tube, that loads into a Beaver or Cessna float plane. Never broke any rods in thirty yrs."
3730922,bigdaddyguns,2015-04-05 07:56:00,608,"I use U-bolts and turnbuckles to secure my 8' pipe to my SUV roof rack. I have mounted the U-bolts into the pipe at the cross member locations on my roof rack. I found U-bolts wide enough fit around the members. The U-bolts are mounted into the pipe and secured with a washer & nut combination. To use, place the pipe/U-bolts over the rack then lock it on with the turnbuckle under the roof rack. Next secure the turnbuckles (now underneath the rack cross members) to the U-bolts with another washer/nut combination. If you need more information I may have some pictures around the whole thing mounted on my SUV."
3731466,Crede,2015-04-05 09:33:00,134,"Over time we have transitioned to all 2 piece rods for our trips to Canada. The 6'6"" 2 piece M or ML Avids are better fishing rods than I am a fisherman. Also like the 2 piece AllStar casting rods. We use a 45"" by 6"" lightweight pipe for each 2-3 people. We use rubber bands to attached each rod top to bottom. Then arrange on a cut down old sheet alternating rod butts at each end as we roll them up in the sheet. Fold the little extra material (about 8"" worth) around each end and slide the whole bundle into the pipe. We get 12-14 rods in easily. It goes inside the vehicle with us and is easy to load into the float plane. Air Canada doesn't look at it twice when we check it thru to Thunder Bay. Has greatly simplified things."
3732690,fishman10,2015-04-05 17:22:00,226,"In my original post I forgot to mention that I stagger the rods, butt to tip, every second rod to even them out in diameter and get more into the tube."
3733042,Lund1875,2015-04-05 18:34:00,250,Reminds me of the time I had all the rods in a pvc tube. My dad was laughing as his were laying in the boat and ready just as they were all summer. I then proceeded to drop my tube and all the rods off the front porch on our cabin. Well they survived the strait drop off rock fall for the 100 yards they tumbled. He was laughing so hard at this point but they were not broken. Now they get stored in the boat were they spend the rest of the year. No tube for me unless it's air travel and checked. Mostly just carry on the plane though.
