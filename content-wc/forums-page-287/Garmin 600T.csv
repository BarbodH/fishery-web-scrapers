So if you can download the lake map you are interested in (JPEG or can save it as a JPEG file), that is another option. You use Google Earth (downlaod for free) and do an image overlay and orientate the map (must be JPEG file) over the lake in Google earth. Once it is ""sized"" the same, you save it as a KMZ file to your Garmin. Your Garmin will then allow you to select the map and show your position on it. If your map is not a JPEG file, open it in Paint or some other program and then save it as a JPEG file so you can do the above. It must be a JPEG file for this to work. My Backroad Ontario maps for GPS (KMZ files) contain PNG files inside and did not work. Fortunately they also had JPEG that I converted as described above. I also captured some Google Map images from my computer (used printscreen, pasted in Microsoft Paint, saved as JPEG) of the surrounding area I am going to. So I have the HIGHLY DETAILED pictures that my GPS will show my location on as a map. Pretty cool stuff and free! One last thing...the filename must NOT have any spaces, etc. ONLY letters and numbers. Otherwise your Garmin GPS won't see the name of the map on your device. Hope this helps. This works on most map capable Garmins including 400 - 600 series, and 62 and 64 for sure. I personally use a 64S since I wilderness hike and Packraft too, better 3-axis compass, reception in woods, etc."
