They feel it is time for them to slow down, and feel two camps are the right number for Remi to take care of. Remi likes to fly his own plane and this gives him an excuse to keep the plane and keep flying. Best of luck in whatever the future brings."

Maybe nobody, maybe Twin Lakes? No clue really."
3716954,onetimedave,2015-04-01 06:26:00,502,I am sure Makoki was sold to be used as a private camp. This was the first lake I went to with AWO. Small but productive.

3717298,adempsey,2015-04-01 07:38:00,963,"Thanks for the info on Makoki. I have no idea if Seven Lakes had Meta or not, but it's definitely in the hands of Meta Lake Lodge now. They also acquired the AMS camp on Meta."
