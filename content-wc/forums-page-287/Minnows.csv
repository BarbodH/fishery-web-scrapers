3743274,bthomas3333,2015-04-08 08:45:00,465,I have used salted minnows from Harmonbrook farms out of Maine.http://www.harmonbrookfarm.com/db/They worked fine for my fly-ins out of red lake. We still order a bunch of live minnows but when we run out of the live stuff these seem to work quite well.B-
3744122,wmd,2015-04-08 11:48:00,388,"The last 3 years I have salted my own minnows at home and taken them to Canada. I also have used salted minnows on home waters as well, we always have live minnows with as well at both locations. I have not noticed a difference in the bite between live minnows and salted minnows either at home or in Canada, both work equally as well. wmd"
3744298,prov1800,2015-04-08 12:34:00,5010,"I cant beleive people come all the way to canada.spend all kinds of money on accommodation, boats, motors, gas and are trying to figure out how to scimp out on the most important ingredient of the trip.i guide for a living, everyday i take ten dozen minnows with me, usually thats for 2-3 people when there gone and start using artificial stuff including frozen shiners thats a big let down from luve stuff.seems nobody cares about running 30 miles with 250 hp motor but to cheap to buy bait.C, MON MAN."
3744418,Flag Island,2015-04-08 12:58:00,32,how about guys that cross the border early AM. Drive 150 miles and hop on a plane at 6-7 AM. Nothing is open and you can't bring live bait across the border. At the Angle I can't bring live bait across either and I would have to boat 8-10 miles to a resort one way to buy minnows when in my experience good salted minnows will work as well. On a fly in fishing trip weight is important as well as keeping minnows alive for a week. When I can catch 100 walleyes a day with salted minnows that is just common sense.
3744562,prov1800,2015-04-08 13:31:00,5010,"In some cases i see your point.iam talking about here in canada.as for flyins.there a no brainer.do lots of day guiding in them.dont need nothing but a twister tail in those lakes.i usually fish on big lakes eagle, lac seul and life bait is the way to go when all theceasy picking fish move out to the main basin.not saying you cant catch some fish on a salted shiner but you aint gonna catch a hundred unless you know something that i dont."
3744810,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-08 14:46:00,62,"Anybody coming through on HWY 11, we can get them minnows. We have our own BHA and use it to supply our guests, but can certainly help out anyone coming through. Just need a 3-4 notice so we can set more traps. PM me if you're needing a hook up"
3745066,prov1800,2015-04-08 16:31:00,5010,Anybody coming up hwy 105 north to earfalls can stop in at clarkes northern lights camp.they also run the best minnow business in the area.they can give yoh all the bait you need and bag them with oxygen. Ive had guts i know take the houseboats on lac seul and had no problems with there bait.camp is only a couple of miles off hwy 105 on the camp robinson road.worth the stop.cheaper than getting them at the camps and way better quality.
3720690,blewslb,2015-04-02 07:51:00,53,Where do you buy minnows for LacSeul houseboat fishing? Price of minnows 2015? Ice out guess? Catch & release!
3721450,Carnhzkr,2015-04-02 10:41:00,964,That's three questions and one statement in 18 words. Very efficient!
3722266,Aspencreek,2015-04-02 14:46:00,2911,"Answers to above:anywhere you can find them, as much as they want, soon, and you go baby!"
3722794,Timing,2015-04-02 18:00:00,95,"right on, especially whatever the price is it is."
3737634,cuamb,2015-04-06 21:55:00,203,We order right from the houseboat owners. They pick them up from a local bait dealer. We usually pay around $5 per dozen. They have them in airiated bags for us when we arrive. We use Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges but I am sure Lac Seul Floating Lodges will get them also.
3738250,pjshorthorn,2015-04-07 06:09:00,5654,"If you are leaving out of Hudson, you can get minnows from J&D baits 807-737-2980 on your way into town. Been using them since 2003. They supply all of the HB Operations and lodges in the area. Good family run operation. Give them a call ahead of time ( few weeks ) and place your order. Mike has to fly the minnows in from Pickle Lake where he traps so they will need some notice to make sure they have them on hand when you arrive. I don't know the price as I haven't used them in a few years.PjShorthorn"
3739642,Pooch,2015-04-07 11:22:00,4619,"J&D's works well on your way to Sioux Lookout or Hudson. They are located several (?) miles south of the Ojibway Provincial Park accessing Little Vermillian Lake. Watch for their driveway closely as it is very easy to drive by it. They are on the west (left as you head north to Sioux Lookout) side of the road and only have a small sign to mark the driveway.Nice people. Always interesting to see their big tanks of bait.Just a change of subject, but why have minnows gotten so expensive beginning the last year or so? I love fishing minnows, but find myself more and more using fake bait and doing well as I continue to gain more confidence with it. Especially when fish are feeding. Tough bite? Gotta have live bait. I'm not that confident, yet!I pretty well hit my ""ouch"" point at 25 cents a minnow. Now using more and more fresh salted minnows. Seem to be about half the price of live, but the salt is a PITA.Trapping is hard work so it is what it is.Pooch"
3739986,bigwalleye1,2015-04-07 12:31:00,2632,"I'm also a fan of J&D. They're still half the price or so of the same dozen minnows at the lodge. When fuel went nuts several years ago, the cost to give minnows that airplane ride went through the roof. We'll do better this year with the exchange rate. I still use minnows a lot as a search tool, crawlers some less, and I switch to plastic when the bite is heave and let my Dad run the minnows. I don't care if he fished out every minnow I've got. At 76, he's still going to Canada. He hauled me around all those years as a young 'un. Turn about is fair play."
3741970,Flag Island,2015-04-07 20:42:00,32,We have always brought up a gallon of frozen chubs from Minnesota Bait Co. Thery are legal to bring across the border and keep really well. Plus they are very reasonable in price. I use these all year at the angle and catch just as many fish as people using live bait
3742834,bushead11,2015-04-08 07:10:00,151,"We tried the ""salted"" packages of golden shiners from Gander Mountain but they did not work at all... Gulp actually worked better. That trip was in late June. The most recent trip was the last week of may and we killed it with Cranks and live minnows. I read that the GM minnows have some chemical in their preservation process that turns the fish off. I'm curious what other companies people have used for salted minnows and their experience with them..."
