1264167,lenray,2011-01-23 20:39:00,467,I fish it every year. It is my go to lake when I just have 3-4 days as it is only 600 miles one way. Was down to Fenton last week. It has very shallow areas but is a very decent body of water as far as size goes. We go thru that shallow area and go up into the other lake--thinking kinda north. Catch decent eyes and numbers of perch--not big ones and pike. Camp up on an island in the lake. Tried for trout never caught one. Down side is there are others there. Usually go in Sept. not many there at that time of the year. If ya want pike and big ones and lots of them try Buxsus sp. we cut in with saws 2 days and took in an inflatable with a 2.5 tonaka--not safe to hang anything over da boat.
