1249421,GOBIG,2010-11-16 05:58:00,126,Any reports of how the fishing was in spring and fall. I am looking to book a trip in late aug on either quantz or napken. Any info would be great. Thanks

Pike were small under 24"" as an average. I like a lake that they are mid twenties to mid thirty average size. Not to say there not in there though. Good Luck"

1263854,Mike Borger,2011-01-22 18:56:00,1554,Are you affiliated with Hearst Air?
1264210,Pymbet,2011-01-24 06:32:00,42,No affiliation. I'm from Michigan. My brother/buddies and I have fished with them four times.
