Most important criteria for me on this trip is the quality of the cabin and boats, a beach for the kids, flying in as opposed to drive-in (I want the kids to experience this) and cost (Air Tamarac has a terrific summer family rate).The drive for me is quite reasonable as well, although the downside is the final 2-3 hours on gravel.Overall I ""think"" this would be a good choice.But I'm not totally sure.What's got me wavering is doubt about the fishing and how many other boats will we encounter.I've never done a trip before to a body of water with multiple outfitters.Am I better off going to a single cabin lake if it's in the same price range?Luenberger in Nakina would be roughly the same price to a couple of their closer camps, but I'm positive the cabin and boats wouldn't be as nice.Any and all thoughts will be appreciated and considered,Thanks, Mike"

1264996,Mike Borger,2011-01-26 10:12:00,1554,"I've flown with both of the outfitters you mentioned many times over the years. I would love to bring my family as the drive would be super easy for us... but their prices are a bit too much. I'm trying to keep it under 2K for all four of us and once you start looking it's not easy to find. Thanks for the reply though, it was a good thought."
1264997,Fishing Traveler,2011-01-26 10:14:00,19,"Went to a drive-in on the Gouin and can't speak directly to Air Tamarac but I think they may fish the same bay as our lodge, Nemio. We barely saw anyone else. I would say maybe a handful of times throughout the week would we see someone from another camp but it never was a bother. We did go in August, though, and our camp was not full that week. I would say that most of the time we didn't see another person on the water. I went to the Gouin with my dad and two sons (14 and 11 at the time). We really enjoyed it. I personally didn't love the amount of time on non-paved roads but we survived it and others don't seem to be too bothered by it. I am just not used to it and was uptight the entire drive. With your fishing abilities, I am sure you will catch plenty of walleye on your trip. It is amazing how good of a fishery it is."

1265096,Mike Borger,2011-01-26 15:11:00,1554,This is kind of ironic considering phish's post and my reply.I just heard back from Park's Fly In Fishing based in Hawk Junction.I've flown with them before and had a fantastic trip. They're working with me on the price and it looks as though I'll be booking with them.Very few other outfitters were willing to give much of a break for very young children.Don't need any Gouin feedback after all.Funny how things work out!
