Have a friend that goes to Bellsmith and loves that lake. Good luck with your trip.

As far as Armstrong goes we have also been to Mattice Lake Outfitters and Thunderhook Fly-Ins. Both are top notch outfitters in the area, excellent fishing and Thunderhook has fully modern outposts."

My favorite early season Ontario lake for walleye. All aspects of the trip with Wilderness North were excellent. Have been out of Armstrong to Machawaian Lake and Kenozhe Lake in late August/early September a few years before they were purchased by Wilderness North. Fishing for walleye was great at both. Both cabins were fine. Went to Keezhik Lake with Northern Outposts out of Armstrong in September. Great fishing, cabin, boats, and motors. I will definitely fish this lake again sometime. Have not been with Mattice Lake Outfitters but everyone who goes with them highly recommends them. Hope this helps. Feel free to PM if have any specific questions."
