1262897,nitrodude,2011-01-19 09:16:00,60,Just wanted to second the coil burned before bedtime. We get a large cabin each year and burn about a third of a coil each evening before bedtime. (After dinner during nightcap & BS time.) We crack a few windows for a bit to let the bugs we've let in flee. It's worked for us for many years.
1262899,Mike Borger,2011-01-19 09:18:00,1554,"There's only one way to deal with this situation imo. No way, no how will I ever burn a mosquito coil or light a thrma cel in the cabin while I'm sleeping. Sometimes the simplest remedies are the best. First off make sure the cabin is mosquito proof. Cover up all holes or rips in window screens. (duct tape is handy for this). Before you hit the sack spray the cabin with indoor Raid bug killer. Let it settle down and you're good to go. Works for me."
1262914,elway12,2011-01-19 10:15:00,335,"Thanks for all of your suggestions. I am going to try the coils and probably the portable air freshner type gadgets. Good thing we stay in great new cabins with no holes, unfortunately we fish til after 10 pm each night so the Canadian Air force are lined up out side our cabin door as we go in from the dock!"
1262813,elway12,2011-01-18 21:35:00,335,OK not to sound like a wuss but our group had a heck of a time last year with mosquitos getting into the cabin and keeping us up all night. We are big users of Theracell units but obviously don't like having them on indoors. Anything you guys use to keep them out or at bay especially at night to prevent them from buzzing in your ears?
1262828,ManitouBass,2011-01-19 00:44:00,201,"take some vitamin b-1 for a few days before, no bugs will be interested in you. Done this for years, works like charm, plus its really cheap (about $4 per bottle, enough for a whole crew)I'm a nutritional consultant practitioner by trade, lol, so im not just spouting **** talk, haha"
1262833,jigman 2003,2011-01-19 03:22:00,981,"Yeah, I've heard the B-1 stories. Apparently they work for some people, but none of the people I know. I've tried it for years and so have lots of the other guys I've gone to Canada with over the years. Doesn't even slow 'em down. If the windows are open, I see no reason you couldn't run the thermacells. Do your cabins not have screen windows/doors? Are they just full of holes? Best solution for that we've found is the handyman's secret weapon. Spraying down the outside of the screens/doors/windows a few times a day with some barn spray (fly spray for barns) really helps us too."
1262845,Glenman12,2011-01-19 06:18:00,762,we've always had good luck with the mosquito coils..
1262851,ohiojmj,2011-01-19 06:44:00,1262,"Duct tape the lousy screens, get indoors before dusk or minimize opening the door, bring fly swatter, put some deet on, never tried B-1 but have had luck with Jim Beam helping dull the problem, keep lights down near doors/windows, close bedroom doors to maintain a place to retreat."
1262857,jigman 2003,2011-01-19 07:01:00,981,"Some big old stinky cigars work great too, if all the members of the cabin can stand it that is."
1262863,Bill Krejca,2011-01-19 07:10:00,6107,"Burning an inch or so of coil works great for me. If the cabin is large, use two, spaced apart. Knocks those buggers out like magic! Try to limit the trips outside after the coils burn out. Bill"
1262864,Ogoki,2011-01-19 07:12:00,291,I learned early on to put a pic coil under your bunks for a little while before going to bed . OF COURSE open a couple wnidows so you get it out of the cabin before going to bed . By opening a window on each side you get some cross ventilation . I had a bad problem in one cabin as the previuos occupants told us they were ate up each night . Upon questioning them I found out they sat up late playing cards and were constantly opening the door to relieve themselves of adult beverages . Each time they opened the door they let more in and when it was time for bed they had company. At that cabin I placed a small piece of pic coil on a holder and placed it in an aluminum pan and placed under the bed and then went fishing for a couple hours before dark with the windows closed. I don't advise leaving a pic burning in the cabin when you are gone for of course they can be a fire hazard . We were in front of the cabin at the time . I did get rid of them and had no more problems. I believe the mosquitos get under the bunks and come out at dark. Be EXTREMELY carful burning the pic coils as they advise you not to breath the fumes . In addition like I stated above they are burning and can cause a fire . But used properly they do get rid of the mosquitos . Would not go North without them .
1262890,Pooch,2011-01-19 08:42:00,4619,"Hey Elway! My old internet computer died and I lost all my contacts. Email so I can get your address back.If your staying in the new cabins don't use the entire mosquito coil as the cabin is too tight. Use about a fourth of one when you leave for the evening fishing. It will be about gone by the time you get back in and if you keep the door closed as much as possible you can get a good nights sleep.If you're in the old cabins you'll need to burn most of a coil as the roof vents and the loose cabins allow a lot of outside air into the cabin.Most people don't like the smell of coils or the warning label (good grief everything has a warning on it anymore), but we've never seen any problem with them. Clothes stink when we get home, but that is a small price to pay for a restful night.I'll get caught up with you in a few days.Pooch"
1262894,Seanik,2011-01-19 09:05:00,218,"We were at Expeditions North last year and they had a mosquito repellent that looked much like a home automatic air freshner. It sprayed about every 20 mins. an exotic fruit concoction that really worked and the cabin was totally bug free, also it's battery powered. The spray is safe and harmless to humans. I am going back there this July and didn't get the name of this product. David Zhul the owner said he got it off the internet, I sure if you called him he would give you the manufactures name.
