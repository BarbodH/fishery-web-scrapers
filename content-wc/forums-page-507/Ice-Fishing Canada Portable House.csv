Does this include portable shelters? If we are required to display our name and address on a portable shelter, does anyone have a suggestion as to how they do this? I don't want to write on the fabric and realize that I can attach something quite easily, just want to make sure I understand the correct requirements. Thanks for your help!! Hawgeye"

Here in my part of N/W Ontario it must not be an issue, as I have never heard of that being a requirement and most people (including myself) do not have anything on their stationary or portable shacks. I have never been questioned about it by the MNR. Manitoba or Saskatchewan may be different."
1263654,mrwalleye5,2011-01-21 18:36:00,1922,Not a ice fisherman but follow a local website out of Winnipeg and that question just came up. Since it is a portable and in all likelyhood you won't be leaving it unattended overnight it does not require a name and address. This regulation is for permanent shacks that are left on the ice for extended periods of time.
1263680,Hawgeye,2011-01-21 20:41:00,1355,"Thanks MrWalleye5 as that is how I understood it. The regulations do not spell out their definition of Shelter. Anyway, if you are out fishing by Chalet Beach or the basin area East of there around February 24-27th, I'll be up with a group of Nort' Dakotan's hoping to land a trophy greenback! Was up last year ""freelancing"" for the first time with a buddy and we did really well. Considering we were a little blind (to the area), with a little input from you and a few others, we were able to get in the general area to catch some really nice fish. We did move quite a bit but were able to figure out a pattern. My partner caught a trophy Greenback that was between 11 and 12lbs! My best was around 8. I plan to top that this year! After seeing your post, I surfed around the IceShanty and found the thread you may have been referring to. Thanks for the neighborly advice, I'd like to buy you a beer if we bump in to one-another! Good fishing and I hope the Greenbacks are big and active for ya!!"

1264799,adempsey,2011-01-25 19:22:00,963,"In Ontario, only permanent huts need to be registered. Portables you most likely don't need to do anything.From the 2011 MNR Fishing Regulations Summary: ""You not need to register your ice hut if your ice hut is a tent made of cloth or synthetic fabric that has a base area of seven square metres (75.4 square feet) or less when erected.""http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...ent/198219.pdf"
