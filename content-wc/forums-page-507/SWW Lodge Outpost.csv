1262423,DavKin,2011-01-17 14:46:00,104,I'm close to booking a week in early August at SWW Lodge Outpost on Vaughan Lake. I'd be taking my daughter for her first trip to Canada. I prefer to fish for walleye and am looking for guidance on what to expect and how far we may have to go to get on fish. Thanks.
1262802,fishnut,2011-01-18 21:08:00,46,I have never stayed at the camp but have fished Vaughn Lake many times. It is usually considered an early lake (spawning from Lac Seul) and a Pike lake. I would also suggest fishing the big lake as there are numerous great spots depending on the time of year. When will you be going?
1262805,fishnut,2011-01-18 21:12:00,46,Aftr re reading your post I see you will be going in August. I will also be on Lac Seul in early august. I would definitaly fish the big lake. There are some great mid lake reefs and island points.
