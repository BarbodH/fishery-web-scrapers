I would think it would be unlikely any would be brought in, unless someone was unlucky enough to get them at a motel on the way up. It would seem, most people with the wherewithall to come to Canada fishing, would not be the normal suspect to carry bedbugs, of course the Nevada folks are a little suspect."

1263421,Jatar,2011-01-20 21:03:00,169,Yeah we picked up the bedbugs staying in Green Bay on our way to Canada
1263464,AllenW,2011-01-21 06:47:00,11482,"Anybody know if the bug sprays will kill them?We used to hit spiders on occasion, so we'd lightly dust the cabins beds and such with bug spray before we used them, probably did more harm to us, but never had spider bites after that.Al"
