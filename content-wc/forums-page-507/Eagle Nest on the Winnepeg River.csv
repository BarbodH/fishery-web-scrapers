Boats were getting a little tired but I believe they were to get new ones for the coming spirng. Meals were excellent. Cabins are nice. I compared it to Aikens Lake which is a first class operation. My only complaint were some of the guides. As long as you just wanted to use a jig and minnow they were fine with that but in my case I found that bottom bouncers and spinners were working the best, When I suggested doing that instead of jigging the guides just rolled their eyes and grumbled. I had the same guide the first and last day and he was receptive to however we wanted to fish, plus he knew how to handle the boat in current when fishing bouncers. We hammered the walleyes right out in front of the lodge with the largest around 26"". Would I go back....yes, definatley."
