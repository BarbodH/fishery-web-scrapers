1260468,a3dad,2011-01-09 08:45:00,115,"you can check on historical weather details here: http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc..../canada_e.html I've been tracking the snowfall for the Gouin Res area (Parent, QC) for the past several years. The totals were slightly above average for early December but have been average from mid to end-December. January so far has been below average. The real deal is what will happen in February, March, and even early-april. That is what will fill (or not fill as the case was in 2010) the reservoirs."
