1263481,wallydave,2011-01-21 07:34:00,2151,"Finding balance means more than keeping the boat steady or spending enough fishing walleye and pike, or other fish for that matter. Finding balance in being a dad, finding time for ourselves as well as spending time with our children is an important aspect of being a father. As parents we have to make sacrifices, but spending time with our children especially time in the boat and the trip up north and sharing our passion for fishing with our kids is a sacrifice that will bear fruit in our childrens lives and ours!"
1263490,Jatar,2011-01-21 07:53:00,169,"I took my son to Canada for the first time when he was 9, now he is 12 and he pretty much outfishes me, my fishing buddies know that he is part of the package when we go and no complaints, most of them are now bringing along their kids which really works out well as they can entertain each other when we are on land. We started him fishing when he could hold a pole off the dock, I went swimming a couple of times to retrieve it, but it was worth it.Check out his pics !"
1263658,Fishin Fun,2011-01-21 19:08:00,218,"Part of the issue is space. Right now we have 6 people in a cabin meant for 4. So taking the youngest one right now isn't really an option. I do take both of them ice fishing and summer fishing around the area. The 7 year old is bored within the first 30 minutes. Thank goodness for his Nintendo DSI. I'll take the youngest one in the next couple of years, but I'll probably have to either go at a different time than the rest of the group or not ask one of the group to go with so I can take my youngest son. Maybe I could rent another cabin at South Bay if it's available, but cabins are in short supply usually. Tenting is probably not an option as the past 2 years it's been cold and rainy most of the week."
1263687,Moondog,2011-01-21 21:22:00,362,Man..............You sound so resigned that everything will suck!!!! I have heard no sucking noises on Gull Rock Lake!!!! Maybe you have one trip with your friend and another with the boys. Probably better anyway but men make boys so remember other members of your group can have a profound effect on your boys. I know .....part of you wants to do this on your own..........NO KIDS. Have time and fun and do what you want without the wife and kids always telling you what to do. Nice idea in theory but rarely causes families to be closer or have fun being a family doing what you like to do. Take a different look at this. Attitude is everything. All things can be done with Gods help
1263694,twobearlake,2011-01-21 22:14:00,379,"Fishin Fun, I say have a great time with your eldest. It sounds to me like you have a good read on your boys and I think all kids are different. Trust your knowledge of your kids and enjoy this year's trip. I hear you that you are out there with both boys during the year and you are intrroducing them both to fishing. It will be a special trip for your 11y/o and the 7 y/o will have his time soon enough. Maybe it will be a kinda ""Right of Passage"" thing in your family. TB"
1263699,eyemike,2011-01-21 22:44:00,233,"I took my oldest daughter when she was 9 to Canada. After that first trip there was no leaving her home.She made several trips with me. She is 27 now and can outfish most people I know; can operate a boat very well. She taught her now husband how to walleye and pike fish. She still to this day talks about her Canadian trips like they were yesterday.I always made it fun for her with very little restrictions in the boat and she soaked it up like a sponge. I personally do not believe in too young. I had so much fun with her in the boat, we fished hard and long and she helped in all of the choices the two of us made while on our trips right down to the amount of time on the water. No buddy or friend was a better friend than that young girl then. Mike"
1263867,Fishin Fun,2011-01-22 20:10:00,218,"Not at all moondog. I'm super excited that my oldest is going with. It is something that I've been waiting for since they were born. I'm just saying that I'd love to have my 7 year old with, but I don't think he's ready for the trip. And when he is ready, there's going to probably be an issue with space as we already have a full trip. Lots of things to think about to make it a special trip for him. I want this to be something that makes them want to come back again and again. Nothing is going to suck."
1263883,hoosiercanadian,2011-01-22 21:24:00,104,"Take your 7 year old too, he is the perfect age for the trip, my kids take top priority on my fishing trips, anyone else would have to find other accomadations, the question is, does your 7 year old want to go? If the answer is yes , THEN TAKE HIM !!! yes it may require more of an effort on your part , but the rewards will make it worthwhile, life is short, time together as a family is precious, and tomorrow is not guaranteed."
1264775,new hips,2011-01-25 18:25:00,498,"Never got to go on a fishing trip with my Dad, he died when I was 19. He also loved to fish, our family would camp, my family was putting up the tent, I would be on the bank catching bluegills before the tent was set up. I did take my Uncle with me a couple of times, Canada included. He died a few years back at 90, at his funeral my cousin said that he treasured those trips and talked about it all the time, we had some great trips together. My oldest boy was 12 and took 3 trips to Canada with me, we were on the English river, the last day I told him to pick out a lure they were selling at the camp that was sure to catch a Northern, he picked a top water buzz bait, all I did that day was unhook about 30 Northern ......Precious Memories"
1264784,Mike Borger,2011-01-25 18:34:00,1554,Bringing your kids along is the best part of being a dad.Mine are now 4 and 7 and have been on numerous trips already (albeit mostly to our family camp in NW Quebec).This year I'm bringing both on their first fly in trip. Can't wait.
1263216,Jimmy Jig,2011-01-20 08:15:00,1905,Buy him a good rain coat!!! Not some cheap plastic thing......
1263229,bcmss396,2011-01-20 09:10:00,296,"We've started taking our kids when the oldest two when they were 6 and 3 respectively. Our 3rd and youngest made her first trip at 3 months, she'll be 3 this may before our annual trip. Yeah, she's not fishing yet, but she loves the splashing in the water and boat rides.The trips have always been about the kids, but the 2 older ones are now really getting into fishing, so I'm getting to spend more time on the water.It's the best family time in the world. I believe it really teaches them something about themselves and how independent they can be when taken away from the fast pace of society.We go to Lac des Mille Lacs - Mostly fish camps, but plenty for families to do if you're creative.Blair"
1263268,jsmyers,2011-01-20 11:05:00,198,"I already talked about my experiences:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...60&postcount=5I'll turn 31 next summer. I can't imagine not having all that time fishing with my dad, my grandfather, my uncle, and my cousin. It makes me sad to think that I could have had fewer memories. My grandfather passed 4 years ago this spring. By the time I was in high school it became basically impossible to take that trip because of football, but the work paid off:http://michigan-football.com/s/1997/wolverne.htmThat was my senior year. Gull Lake was my high school. 9-0 was our record!Note that it isn't illegal for a kid to go along hunting in Michigan, as long as the youngster doesn't have a weapon. I didn't carry a gun on a deer hunt until I was 14, just like the law said."
1263317,hoosiercanadian,2011-01-20 13:40:00,104,"I have been taking my 4 daughters to Canada since they were babies , My daughters are now 12, 21, 24, and 30 , it has always been the highlight of my summer, they love to fish, and eat fish, and swim, pick blueberries, watch the northern lights, watch eagles, moose , bear, listen to loons, and enjoy the whole experience, and luckily,I was able to get them all together again this summer for a trip, as they get older that gets more difficult with school and work schedules . And my oldest is getting married in the fall, so eventually i may have a son in law to break in as well. Please take both of your sons, i'm sure you'll be able to tell when you need to take a break form the fishing and take a swim, or have a picnic lunch , pick berries etc. you will not regret the experience."
1263327,jsmyers,2011-01-20 14:05:00,198,That is part of what is pushing us to return!My sister got married last fall. My brother in law and his father are coming. My cousin also got married a few years ago. His father in law is also coming.
1263400,tiz,2011-01-20 19:32:00,18,"I decided to take my 12 (turns 12 tomorrow) year old this summer. We are booked the first week of June in the Marten River area. Before booking the trip we had a long discussion about what to expect and what would be expected of him. He is so excited it is unbelievable. When I called the camp, Martin River Lodge, I asked him about other kids in the camp and he proudly told me about his twin 11 year old sons. Jack Pot! He assured my that you can throw rocks in the river off the dock and catch perch five minutes later. We are driving from Atlanta to the camp (1450 miles) but with laptops and gameboys with ride won't be hard on him. I thought as he started getting older the list of reasons that he didn't want to go would get longer. I am hoping that all goes well so this positive experience outweighs girl friends, beach trips, part time jobs, and hanging out with friends."
1263428,castnblast,2011-01-20 21:53:00,111,"I'd bring both. It's work having the younger ones out. And often, means a little less fishing, but both for sure."
1263431,fireboat,2011-01-20 22:24:00,752,Reading some of these replies almost brings a tear to my eye. I took my sons at an early age and I'm very glad I did. Some of the best times we've spent together have been in the woods or on the water. I took them early so I could teach them and enjoy them. We always had a camper and a boat and used them a lot.The trips revolved around them not me. I'm 60 and retired. My sons are married with their own children now and I'm having a blast taking my 5 and 7 yr old granddaughters crappie fishing. We're making great memories all over again. And I still have time to take those die-hard fishing trips with my buddies that I didn't dare take a child on. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life but leaving my sons home while I went out to play was not one of them. We can't turn the clock back but I wish I could with my dad.
1263474,Mike Kansas,2011-01-21 07:18:00,1463,Make sure you have the proper paperwork to take your son out of and back into the USA. When we took my grandson we needed letters from his parents that were notarized to take him across the border. They asked my grandson more questions than they asked me. Just a heads up for you please do your research. Good Luck and have a great trip. Mike Kansas
1263476,Moondog,2011-01-21 07:22:00,362,"I take plenty of things for my grandson to do as he does not have the patience to fish much. One of the big hits is his own boat that we put a long cord on so he can play over the side of the boat with it. Also Legos and he sits in the bottom of the boat and builds things. ""Net Boy"" is also fun and we let him try to net all the fish. Shore lunch is always a big hit as well as ""driving"" the boat. All in all, I would say that compared to the fun we have the inconvenience is negligible."
1263068,Fishin Fun,2011-01-19 18:22:00,218,"I just decided that this is the year to bring my 11 year old son to Gull Rock. He's been asking for the past couple of years to go with. Wasn't sure he was going to be able to handle the 12+ hour trip, fishing in the rain, fishing in potentially cold weather, etc. But it's time to jump in with both feet. I don't know who's more excited. I have a 7 year old son waiting in the wings. He asked to go with this year, but he'll have to wait until he gets more mature."
1263077,fireboat,2011-01-19 18:48:00,752,"You know your own kids and what they can handle. I have 3 sons and I started taking them hunting & fishing with me at a very early age, 6. The youngest is over 30 now and they still talk about all the memories we made together. I can still remember begging my dad to take me fishing with him and my uncle but I never got to go. That's not the memories I wanted to leave with my sons. My dad is gone now and there are very few memories with him. Take 'em with you. Better to spend time with them back at the cabin if the weather gets bad than to leave them home to watch TV and play with their DSI games. You only get one chance, their only young once. Enjoy them."
1263084,walleyeduran,2011-01-19 19:03:00,286,"Take them both with you, what better time to have with your sons. I was lucky that my dad started me fishing and hunting at an early age. (can not say the age because it was illegal as far as hunting goes). I wish I had a son or two to take on a Canadian fishing trip, but as God would have it, this is not possible. Consider yourself lucky, take the 7 yr. old with your other son and have a great trip. Duran"
1263087,Golden Eagle,2011-01-19 19:18:00,2642,Me too.
1263101,jiggster,2011-01-19 19:55:00,183,"I agree completely with Fireboat. I started taking my son on opening of fishing at one year old. He started going to Canada when he was 8. He is now 21, I wish I had more of the younger years. We still go to Canada every year and keep building memories. You can never have enough time with your children. Jiggster"
1263110,Flip Silverlake,2011-01-19 20:25:00,645,"I started fishing with my Dad when I was around 6 in northern Wisconsin. Pine Lake to be exact. First year on Lake of The Woods I was 10. I was 47 the last time I fished with him in Canada. I have very fond memories of those trips. I took my son to Smiths Camp when he was 6 months old, he caught his first Walleye at the age of 4. I now have a grandson who is 2 years old and I can't wait until I can get him in the boat and watch him land one of those grand fish. Being 61 I hope I still have enough time to teach my Grandson the wonders of the great north. You can never start to early collecting those wonderful time together. Take a ton of pictures my bet once you get him started he won't quit! It's funny everyone hates those old 2 stroke motors but that smell early in the morning is like being in heaven to me."
1263137,tackleman,2011-01-19 22:17:00,444,"You don''t have to be in a boat for 12 hours on gullrock, but I suspect you have fished here before and already know that. I see people fishing off the docks all the time at the camps on the lake and I know they are catching fish, so your younger son could take you to the dock for some quality time if he is restless in the boat for long periods of time."
1263141,aggie kolisnik,2011-01-19 22:33:00,39,"I encourage our guests to bring their kids, we don't charge for them. The time flies by so fast and then they're grown men. My son started hunting with me when he was in grade two. We have fished ever since he was born. He was in a baby carrier when we would head out on Lake of the Woods. His friends at school gave him a hard time, but now they are all over all the time and we have tons of stories to keep them entertained. My son is now 27 years old and he STILL hunts with his mama. I get our moose every year! He brought his son for his first moose with us. what memories."
1263176,stinkycat,2011-01-20 05:33:00,2018,Well said! I am in the same boat as walleyeduran! I am not so sure on the younger guy when it sounds like a hard core fishing trip but the 11 year old should be good to go as long as he knows what he is getting into. I started fishing with my Dad & Grandfather when I was 5-6 and started hunting at age 10. I have many fond memories that give me big smiles. Have a safe & fun trip
1263206,Moondog,2011-01-20 07:38:00,362,Our gkids are 5 & 7 and this will be their 4th summer fishing canada. er.........I use the term fishing loosely. But they went back and forth between grandpas and grandmas boat and their parents boat all day with no problems and had a great time playing with things. Didn't bother us at all. I have a video of my grand daughter singing to a leech and calling it Dora. Then Dora became a ring. You can bet we will show this at her wedding reception!!! So I say take 'em.
