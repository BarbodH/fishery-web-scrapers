1262667,JayM5209,2011-01-18 13:42:00,1050,"Further North, with your Pro V you should check out Vermilion Bay/West Arm of Eagle Lake. Plenty of the species you're most interested in, plus lakers and muskies. Specifically, check out Vermilion Bay Lodge. My son and I did our first trip there last August and you won't find a friendlier, more accommodating place for a housekeeping week . . . plus, it's close to tackle stores, grocery stores, etc. V-Bay Gord, a frequent contributor here, will take excellent care of you. Big water with plenty of sheltered islands and bays for the windy days. You can fish different water every day for the entire summer if you like to explore. Nice sheltered docking that's protected from wind and rough water. Super place. www.vermilionbaylodge.com"
1262760,walleyeduran,2011-01-18 18:20:00,286,"Further North, like many people have posted, Lac Seul is a great body of water for walleye, northerns, smallmouths and NE side for muskys. Rainy lake is a very good fishery that most people just drive on by, which is a good thing for me because I can get there in 4 hours. I have been fishing gullrock lake the last 11 years and realy enjoy it. I stay at wrights camp and have been treated very well. When you find a camp and it becomes your family, you have a hard time going to different or new water. Duran"
1263094,jiggster,2011-01-19 19:37:00,183,"I feel you are in the correct area by Ear Falls. I would take a serious look at the English River. I have been fishing there for many years. If you want to email, I have ideas for you."
1263125,Further North,2011-01-19 21:04:00,2008,"Thanks everybody, I am looking into all the suggestions and will keep everyone's ideas in my mind."
1262418,Further North,2011-01-17 14:37:00,2008,"I've pretty well decided I'm going this summer,What are the do's and don'ts?I'm driving up from NW WI, about 90 miles due east of the Twin Cities, taking my own boat, most likely a housekeeping plan (make our own meals), looking for as many species as possible, want cabin with electric, etc.Probably going up in late June, right around the Summer Solstice.Any advice is welcome, from places that are great to places to avoid, to what baits to take to what tactics to use."
1262424,AllenW,2011-01-17 14:47:00,11482,"Ya, take me with you.....Have your passport not sure if they're required but it'll probably make things eaiser, know what you can and can't bring with you, find a resort with a sheltered lauch, make sure everybody knows what they're responsible for before you go, bug and sun screen a must.Maybe go down a bit and check out the Canada section, there's a ton of info on going into Canada.And...have fun.Al"
1262432,Further North,2011-01-17 15:24:00,2008,Doh!
1262440,T Mac,2011-01-17 15:41:00,10084,"Nipawin, SK. Paved all the way to Tobin Lake and the Saskatchewan R. That time of year it is a numbers deal but, with a few really big girls, too. Also a shot at some huge ""snotrockets"". I have been there during the solstace. We about killed ourselves. LOL We fished about 18-20 hours a day on account of the short amount of darkness right then. Nice thing about this place is...if the wind is kicking up, you can fish in the river...and do really well. Passport, NO firearms, No bear spray, No fresh fruits or veggies. 1 Case of beer per adult./ or one liter of booze. Exchange your money after you get into Canada. ..in any small town, near the border with a Credit Union or Bank..If you bring a dog, have its' shots up to date and an affidavit from the vet saying so."
1262520,walleyeduran,2011-01-17 19:59:00,286,"Further North, you should be a little more specific. You mention you would like to fish for as many species as possible but certain lakes might only hold 2 or 3. Ex. if you like to fish for muskys, you have to find a water that has muskys. If you want to concentrate on small mouth bass, you might have to eliminate some options. Lake trout that time of year is another story, they will be sitting at the thermo cline in about 35-45 feet of water and down riggers would be your best trolling option unless you would like to vertical jig them next to rock walls. If you could be a little bit more specific we could help you out a lot. Duran, Spooner WI"
1262522,Further North,2011-01-17 20:10:00,2008,"Thanks Duran, I've no real interest in targeting muskies or lake trout - it they're there, that's fine and I might spend one day out of a week trying for either, but neither will be my main focus.Walleyes, pike and smallies would be my preference, and with no real bias towards one or the other (though nothing gets my heart pumping like a big pike).I fish out of a Lund 1800 Pro V DLX, so I can handle most water as long as I'm careful, and I'd have to say that trolling, while certainly OK when it's the best approach is my least favorite method."
1262607,Mike Kansas,2011-01-18 08:54:00,1463,Take a look at Lac Seul. The Walleye and Pike are always great there and the Smallie fishing gets better every year. Been going to Lac Seul for over 25 years. Want more info email me. Mike Kansas
1262608,cast_and_blast,2011-01-18 08:58:00,1098,Could do the US or Canadian side of Rainy - I prefer the Canadian side for multi-species. Lots of walleyes at that time and plenty of smallies to keep you entertained! Scott
1262625,Further North,2011-01-18 10:25:00,2008,"Thanks Mike, I'm meeting a friend for lunch who's been going there for a while too to pick his brain.I did not see an e-mail in your profile, is a PM OK?"
1262664,Stu,2011-01-18 13:26:00,472,"Hey Further North, Mike gave you some good advice. Lac Suel is a great lake and is one of the favorite haunts of almost everyone at WC. I assume this is your 1st trip to Canada? There are literally hundreds of lakes from which to choose and more lodges than you could visit in a lifetime. Once you've picked a lake, let us know and we can give you more specific info. These guys are a wealth of information. Good luck - Stu"
