I'm mostly after Walleye however I saw a televised fishing show recently (don't remember the name of it) that had these guys slammin Small Mouth, big ones, left and right. That's the nice thing about editing, turn 7 days into 30 minutes. Anyway, heard there are some monster Muskies too. Any advise or wisdom is greatly apporeciated. Thanks RW"
1262348,orchard frank,2011-01-17 10:33:00,1900,"I went there a few times many years ago, back in the mid 90's, so the info I have is certainly not recent. At that time, muskys were the main target for us and the others at camp. Accomodations were okay, nice dock etc. Pretty treacherous water, rocks come up out of nowhere. Not sure if gps charts cover the area now, it would be handy. If not, be careful with exploring and leave plenty of waypoints to follow. We caught quite a few nice smallies while musky fishing, didn't really target them. Not sure about walleyes, may be more of a seasonal thing. Beautiful area."
1262352,ohiojmj,2011-01-17 10:54:00,1262,"I've fished the Key River area of Georgian Bay, to the east several miles from the mouth of the French; a Beautiful area. I agree on the treacherous rocks and difficulty navigating with thousands of islands that all look alike Georgain Bay. I assume the region enar the Bear's Den can be a challenge as well. In the G Bay, we caught mainly pike and walleye with one 20"" musky and some smallies. I caught a 42"" pike last July and lost one of similar size right at the boat. We cauht a bunch of eater sized pike as well. We got some decent walleye although the slot limit on them (16"" to 22"" must be released) made it diffcult to keep many. We did not speciifcally target musky though. With regard to GPS/chartplotter being mentioned, I had a Humminbird 788CI and bought the Navionics Gold chip and it would show most every rock sticking out of the water! I think it's the Canada chip that includes the Great Lakes including Georgian Bay and most likely the entire French River."
1263160,Jay Merics,2011-01-20 03:49:00,21,"I've spent some time at French River Lodge in Ox Bay which is just a short ride from Hartley Bay and Bears Den. Treacherous goes without saying, pretty much all canadian shield water can be treacherous.If your chasing muskie dont expect lots of action and be prepared to put your time in. Smallmouth fishing can be great at times like most other lakes in Ontario.The Lower French River (West of the Chaudiere Dams to the Delta where it empties into Georgian Bay) is Not charted. There are no hydrographic (depths,navigational hazards) maps available, paper or chip."
1263183,ohiojmj,2011-01-20 06:30:00,1262,"Jay M, I could be wrong, but I swear my 2010 Navionics Gold chip in my Humminbird 788CI had detailed depth conttours of the mouth region of the French River. From the Key River delta, I headed west, trolling/exploring the Pickerel River and several bays west of that toward the French. If the small Pickeral river is charted, surely the much larger French is charted as well. I'm not certain about paper maps, but such a popular fishery can't remain uncharted in this day and age."
1263294,Jay Merics,2011-01-20 12:33:00,21,"Georgian Bay is charted, which is why you get depth contours in parts of the outlet areas of the French River where it emties into GBay. The Canadian Hydrographic Service has never charted the Lower French so no paper chart or electronic chart/chip (electronic chips are derived from paper maps) is available until CHS charts it or a company Like Navionics,Lakemaster....sends teams out to do their own survey/soundings.You can call Navionics to check for yourself at 508-291-6000"
1263308,ohiojmj,2011-01-20 13:15:00,1262,"Thanks Jay, maybe i saw the blue water of the French river on the map but didn't notice the lack of contours. I must say thoug, where they charted the water, it's amazing. Small rocks sticking out of the water are on the screen as well as rocky shoals. I will say they can miss an occasional boulder all by itself, but the only time I wacked a rock is when i navigated through fog, following previous days paths, only to thump something while tying a worm harness and strolling into 0' to 6' contour. Without the chartplotter or an available chart, I would not be getting to far because I'd be at idle speed."

1263314,Jay Merics,2011-01-20 13:35:00,21,"Yes, i have the Humminbird 787 with the Navionics Canada chip and where i fish on the Upper French River/Lake Nipissing it is very accurate......i still have my paper charts with me though for reference or if anything happens to my unit."
1263612,Mike Borger,2011-01-21 14:57:00,1554,"Never stayed at Bears Den but I've launched there many times over the years. We always headed down to the Bad River delta to camp and fish. Fantastic area, some of the nicest scenery in Ontario and seasonally very good fishing."
