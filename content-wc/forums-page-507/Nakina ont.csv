Getting to Nokina, has anyone taken the route through Manitouwadge over the last few years??? We took it once but it was back in the 70's. Just wondered if there has been any changes made up there. My three boys and I are going to leuenbergers in July. Thanks for any info anyone can give Ted Jias Bad Axe Mi."

1262212,Crede,2011-01-16 17:53:00,134,Agree with going thru Hornepayne. A few more miles but quicker/better.

1262841,onetimedave,2011-01-19 05:39:00,502,Take road through Hornepayne. Longer but better.

Boring, boring hwy, but little to no traffic and few towns to pass through, especially west of Cochrane. The alternative is the trans Canada and it's waaay slower. Clogged with transports from Sudbury west and lots of small towns to slow you down."
