1262194,Larry Mac,2011-01-16 16:13:00,530,"Hi Glen, sorry I missed you at the show, this year my boy wants to experience the fly in. Keep me posted on your 2011 adventures. Thank you,Larry Mac"
1260727,camp chef,2011-01-10 16:13:00,915,"Time for new scenery.....After much research we have decided to spend 2011 opening week on Pipestone Lake at the Pipestone Lodge. I love getting ready for a new destination.My fishing partner and I are also reuniting with a pair of fishermen that we spend time with often but haven't travelled together to Canada since fall 2007.This means we will have to have a few more winter meetings which is good. Packing for a 20 mile boat in is fun but challenging. We can take whatever we deem necessary,but sure don't want to duplicate things we won't need. Oh how the winter days will drag on.Where are you going?"
1260759,phishfearme,2011-01-10 18:28:00,1242,"CC - we too are heading to new water - specifically stonehouse and kearns lakes with thousand lakes outfitter out of armstrong. we've spent many wonderful years doing fly-ins around pickle lake and thought we try a different region. i agree - the planning of a new trip is a challenge and part of the fun. this outfitter has also agree to place a canoe on an untouched lake - as far as the outfitter and the locals know it's never been fished - which also adds to the interest. please issue a trip report - i always do. best of luck, phish"
1260819,Bill Krejca,2011-01-11 05:13:00,6107,"Dad and I camped in Pipestone many moons ago. We found a flat spot on an island near Schistose (sp?) Lake. I remember getting a number of nice lake trout on red and white jigs just west of the entrance in Schistose. Should be a fun trip for you, give us a report when you get back. Bill"
1260833,HighTech,2011-01-11 06:44:00,75,"Make sure your camp owner actually is allowed to place a canoe on that lake for you. Camps are restricted in the number of cached boats they can have on remote lakes. It's one thing for you to physically carry in a canoe for the day and it's another issue having a boat there for you. Since the entire fishing world now knows about the ""canoe"" I would take a bit of time to inquire about the rules. I'm not suggesting I know all the regulations, I simply caution you to look into it. Have fun on your trip."
1260837,tparker,2011-01-11 07:06:00,100,"New water for me this year too. Last two trips were to Birch Point Camp on Nungesser Lake. Hooked up with a group this year that is doing a fly in to Meta Lake Lodge in mid June. Have heard good things about the Meta, Brace Lake fishing and am looking forward to finding out about it myself this year."
1261194,Larry Mac,2011-01-12 08:59:00,530,"Hello WC Friends, we too are going to new waters again this year (my son wants to experience remote fly ins). We are excited but I am planning to go back to our regular spot in 2012 (Home Sweet Home LOL). We have been away from it for (2) years and I miss it. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1261231,eyemike,2011-01-12 10:58:00,233,Where are you going Larry?
1261362,fishman10,2011-01-12 19:04:00,226,the thunder bay area does not have restrictions on boat caches. other areas require registration and stickers on boats. we fish a lake 5 miles from kearns and there are 15 boats on the shore.
1261435,Larry Mac,2011-01-13 07:24:00,530,"Hi eyemike, I'm sorry, I did not answer Camp Chefs the original question (oops!!). We are flying into Madison Lake with Polar Bear Outfitters in June and flying to Hornby Lake with Chimo Outfitters in September. My apologies again.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1261992,joeman79,2011-01-15 14:27:00,417,"Our group is goin to a new spot also. A Fly-In to Roger lake with Big North Lodge. Everyone is excited to have the whole lake to ourselves. We will return to Lac Seul for sure in the future, just wanted a change with less time boating to and from the fishing and no other boats. And the lake is supposed to be loaded with Smallies. First time fly in for about half the group of 12, so they are in for a treat."
