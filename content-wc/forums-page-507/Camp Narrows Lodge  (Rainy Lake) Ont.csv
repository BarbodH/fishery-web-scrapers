That end of Rainy has a ton of islands and bays so you can always be out of the wind. Walleyes were off for us this past September for part of the week, but we made up for that with the northern and smallmouth. Got one 40"" northern in the boat and had another at least as big break off. The first year we went up to the Alexandria Bay / Ash Bay area. I've been wanting to go back but always get caught up fishing closer to camp. Tom and Eric will take good care of you.Nimstug"
