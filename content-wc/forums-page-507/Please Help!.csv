1174239,Guest,2010-03-03 19:39:00,0,I usually am only a visitor on this forum but you can email me any questions you have. [email protected]
1174970,Stu,2010-03-05 23:18:00,472,"We gave Medicine Stone a serious look a couple of years ago. I liked the fact that it was the only lodge on the lake. We decided to go to Thaddeus instead because it was a musky lake and is a little more secluded than Medicine Stone. Not to throw more wood on your fire, but you might check them out. They have good walleye too. Anyway, let us know how you do."
1175087,kgeary,2010-03-06 10:11:00,88,Nungesser is quite remote ( boat/portage in) portage is painless but acts like a gate. excellent walleye big and small plus giant pike
1175400,Angler Donny,2010-03-07 10:02:00,11,Where to fish or not to Fish that is the question. LOL ( Shakespear)... We have been going for big pike and monster walley for over 6 years to Nungesser lake. It is a phenominel fishery with many 40+ Northerns and 26+ Walleye. You can check out the lake by either going to anglers kingdom .com or try Nungesser lake lodge.com. or Birch point.com. These are the three lodges on this 27 mile long lake. You wont be dissapointed.
1175517,Angler Donny,2010-03-07 18:31:00,11,Try Anglers Kingdom first then nUngesser lake lodge second. Anglers kingdom is a stand up operation.
1175571,Muskie Bob,2010-03-07 21:28:00,45,"So, did you find Thaddeus a good muskie lake? I thought the walleye fishing was better on Moose Lake (off Ord Lake, which is connected to Thaddeus). If so, how do you like the tunnel connecting Ord to Thaddeus?"
1175582,Stu,2010-03-08 01:06:00,472,"Due to a scheduling conflict, we had to go up the week before musky season opened, but we did see some nice ones lurking in the shallows near the tunnel. We had our best luck w/ walleyes on Ord. There was more structure and the high winds made it difficult to fish on Moose. We jigged up alot of eyes on Thaddeus too, but nothing big. The tunnel was intimidating at 1st, but after a few passes we were pros. Will definitely go back!"
1227761,Rich B,2010-08-14 18:54:00,1081,So where did you end up going......how were the accommodations ? How was the fishing ? Hope you and your friends had a great time in the north country. Rich B
1263342,Guest,2011-01-20 14:46:00,0,"have been going into Ont. since mid 60's. best lakes we have been on are probably out of Nakina. Leuenberger is the best outfitter up there. You probably have been to their web page?? If not the lakes we have fished are kayedon, washi, kellow, elbow. and a couple others, some twice. a friend of ours has a 25# plus pike hanging on his wall in Sebewaing Mi. from kayedon lake. Good fishing and have fun"
1173138,NP4ME,2010-02-28 21:25:00,378,"We are planning on going sometime between the end of June and middle of July. As far as budget, we don't want anything more than about $1500 a person for a week (I know...we are real high rollers). We plan on feeding ourselves. It doesn't matter if it is a fly-in, boat-in, or drive-to. We want to give ourselves the best chance for catching some fish with a small budget. Thanks for all the replies."
1173140,eyemike,2010-02-28 21:45:00,233,Check this resort.www.pashalake.com/ I have fished this area for years. Its a hidden gem. I have not stayed at Pasha but know of his resort it is top notch. The only thing lacking is smallmouth. The area is a fishing factory.
1173144,smallfry,2010-02-28 22:46:00,9,"www.spruceislandcamp.comThey're on Lake Of The Woods, Canadian side, good accomodations, clean and well kept. Pike, Muskie, Walleye, small and large mouth bass. I've seen lot's of pike caught in the 40-48 inch range. There are a few bass tournements on the lake ever year. I personaly don't fish much for bass when I am there, mostly walleye and pike but have gotten a few good size smallies while fishing for both.Your bill will definately be under the 1500 per person range, you can get away with 2000 as a final bill, it all depends on how much gas you go through. The cabin for the 5 of us for a week was around 1500 total. Again the total price of the trip depends on how much gas you use, wether you rent a boat or bring your own boat. I think our total bill was around 2500.If you send them an email they'll send you a brochure and price list.Lake Of The Woods is a big lake and we've always found the fishing to be good. The folks there are great and can point you to many great fishing spots but the pike seem to be all over the place."
1173506,Captain Ron,2010-03-01 23:37:00,14,our group has been fishing pakwash lake for many years.the fishing there is great. there are lots of big pike 40 inch plus the walleye fishing is as good as lac seul and there are lots of smallmouth bass. a great place to fish
1173795,Guest,2010-03-02 17:47:00,0,"You might want to check out boois in Red Lake ontario. They have some of the nicest cabins you will ever stay in can do your own food or they have food there. They have nice boats and all four stroke motors. You can catch lake trout, huge walleye close to camp, and not to bad pike fishing. I used to guide there for three years and one nice thing is the island your on not many bugs at all even at nice. Makes sitting out side nice."
1173838,brant,2010-03-02 19:48:00,89,"This will be our 10th year going to Lake of the Woods and our third going to Moore Bay Lodge. The fishing is great if your willing to look at your map and your graph. Walleye, northern, smallies, and musky can be caught close to camp. You can go down to the Barrier islands or up to Hades and get a total change of scenery and fishing patterns . The owners of the camp, Wolf and Eva, are originally from Germany and are awesome hosts. You can follow your own schedule and they will do as little or as much for you as you like. We like getting up early. We help ourselves to the gas pump and write it down when we are done, use the kitchen at the main lodge sometimes and make ourselves at home. They have been great. The cabins are very clean and up to date. Needless to say we are very happy."
1173880,Stu,2010-03-02 23:53:00,472,"Wow for $1500 / person, you guys will have a lot of lodges from which to choose! Try to give us more details. Get w/ you buddies and decide if you want to fly, boat or drive to your lodge. Generally, fly-ins have better fishing and you can usually get the lake all to yourselves. But obviously, you are limited on gear. There are hundreds of drive-to lodges that will fit your bill and honestly, you can do it for a whole lot less than $1500. Get back w/ us when you narrow down your search. The guys on this site are a wealth of info and can certainly help you find that perfect lodge. Good luck - Stuey"
1174055,NP4ME,2010-03-03 11:38:00,378,"We have narrowed the search down to Lower Manitou Lake, Cedar Lake, Sandybeach Lake, Medicine-Stone Lake, and Dinorwic Lake. We decided on we will do a drive-to for this trip and may take a fly-in in the future. Anyone give a nod to one of these lakes over the other? Thanks again for all the help and info."
1174062,camp chef,2010-03-03 12:03:00,915,Not to muddy the water but did you look at www.bignorthlodge.com .This will be our 6th year.Very Impressive.Of the lakes you list above. We are planning a fall trip to Medicine-stone but haven't been there yet
1174083,wolverine fan,2010-03-03 13:09:00,71,"well now that the waters are muddied! HaHa i will also put in a plug for the Winnipeg River system. I have not fished as south as gun lake (big north) i have fished all of roughrock and little and big sand for 11 years. This system offers all types/kinds of fishing opportunities for species and kings of fishing, trolling, jigging and my favorite, casting. Though the pike fishing trails lake of the Woods (my experiences) for numbers it makes it up in size, as my average size northern in the winnipeg system has always exceeded LOW for me. Good luck with whatever you do and pm me if you would like further info."
1172909,NP4ME,2010-02-28 10:31:00,378,"A newbie to the site and looking for some trip help. I'm with a small group of people (4) that are looking for an Ontario trip. We don't know many people that have been to Canada and are looking for some references. Our #1 choice would be the opportunity to catch trophy pike. However, a couple of the guys would also like to catch numbers and not necessarily size. We would also prefer a lake/lakes that have smallmouth and walleye as well. I like fishing muskie, but am the only one in the group that does, so muskie would not be necessary.Any help would be greatly appreciated. We are open for outpost style or drive-in, as long as the drive-in is somewhat remote.Thanks again!"
1172914,LIKEWALLEYE,2010-02-28 10:46:00,70,"OUR GROUP FISHES LAC SUEL, WWW.FISHTIMBERLANE.COM NICE CAMP AND OWNERS . WALLEYES BIG AND SMALL, SOME NORTHERN PIKE( NOT VERY BIG) BUT IM SURE THEY ARE THERE. IF YOUR GROUP WANTS BIG TO HUGE NORTHERN PIKE I WOULD SUGGEST GOING A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH OF LAC SUEL TO RED LAKE. I PERSONALLY LANDED A 43"" NORTHERN PIKE. GOOD LUCK AND YOU WILL HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME IN CANADA."
1172916,Rich B,2010-02-28 10:54:00,1081,"NP4ME, There are lot's of good camps that would fit your request, though Ontario is a large Province. Your post doesn't indicate if you're open to eastern/mid/western Ontario - once you let us know where'd you like to travel to in the Province, you'll be supplied with a lot of suggestions. You'll have a great time - a lot of the fun is planning the trip. Rich B"
1172918,buzzyb,2010-02-28 11:04:00,14,check out www.greyowlcamps.com great fishing and bear hunting.
1172941,NP4ME,2010-02-28 11:58:00,378,We are open to going anywhere. We have looked at stuff on the east side (Lady Evelyn) and have looked at many west. It is just hard to judge when reading the companies' websites...they all are the best for the cheapest price. Wanted some expertise from the fisherman! Thanks guys.
1172967,TIGHTLINER,2010-02-28 13:02:00,223,LOOK AT WWW.RAYSCAMPS.COM NICE BARGE RIDE INTO CAMP. FAST WALLEYE FISHING WITH LOTS OF NP TOSSED IN. UNDER NEW OWNERS WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU.

I would say that most of your lakes with a good shot at a trophy pike will be too far north for smallmouths but all will have walleyes.Probably my best picks of places I have been to are Ogaki river above Nakina ,which was a flyin and Lake Nipigon which was a drive to camp.kesagami lake above Cochrane is good.One very good pike lake is a lake that is pike only no walleye. this is aflyin lake .If you are interested,P M me . Good Fishing Pikeman"

1173056,Nimstug,2010-02-28 17:34:00,2605,"You really do need to give us a travel time budget, cost budget, American plan or feed yourself. Do you want a fly-in, boat in or drive to. Prices can run from say about $75 per person a day to $500 or more per day."
