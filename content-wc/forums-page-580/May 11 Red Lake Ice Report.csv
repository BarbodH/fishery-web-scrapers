It will depend on the weather and the lake, could be a close call. Telescope and Optic: We can land but ice not completely gone. Domain: Ice gone and ready to fish! Douglas Lake, Viking Island Lodge: Ice is broken up but not gone. Expect to be fine to go in on May 18 Rheaume and Orono: Ice is broken up and we can get in to clean the camps. We have lakes ready for you to fish if you are looking for opening week.
