1102355,Moondog,2009-05-04 16:21:00,362,"Can anyone enlighten us on the banned items de jour this year when crossing the border? Last year Canadian Customs treated us extremely fairly even tho they took the moho into a metal barn and searched us for an hour when crossing into Manitoba. On the way home the US gal took all of our ""contaminated"" Canadian fruit. Go figger."

1102486,Mohleye,2009-05-05 07:08:00,368,We have always been able to bring night crawlers in artificial bedding. No minnows or leeches though.

1102716,PRD1,2009-05-05 19:23:00,458,This looks to be a useful site. http://www.traveldocs.com/ca/customs.htm I do not see the potato ban this year as in the past 4 years or so. Anyone know if that has changed?
1102961,PRD1,2009-05-06 14:26:00,458,"Potatoes are still prohibited, see the other post on Visiting Canada for a full list of what is OK and not."
1103118,JinxCanada,2009-05-07 07:46:00,1306,"i only mentioned that because most people bring them in dirt, which you can't do. but yes worms in artificial bedding is fine...but why would you?just buy them here. LOL."
1103139,JJJMN,2009-05-07 08:55:00,153,"I spent 20 min going over the official Canadian Web site. Waist of time. Food - They want you to buy in Canada ""They have the same food as the US"". Ended up calling them. Potato,s are prohibited but you can bring Onions in as long as they don't have dirt on them. Qty of food - If your only bringing in food for your trip it isn't a problem. Just NO POTATO'S OR WOOD OR WORMS IN DIRT (NON-DIRT IS OK). Extra gas you will pay a duty on it (extra gas can). Whats in the boat fuel tank is fine, it's the extra 5 gal can's they tax.."
