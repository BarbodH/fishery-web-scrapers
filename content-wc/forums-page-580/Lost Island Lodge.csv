1098956,Mike Kansas,2009-04-21 09:53:00,1463,"2009 will be our fifth straight year at Lost island Lodge. We love the place and the people. The fishing and service has always been first class. The bathroom situation is really not a problem they are clean and private. The cabins are super and the boats are first class. During my 20 plus years of fishing Lac Seul I haven't seen any Resorts any better and several that were much worse. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

1097154,Luvnwalleyes,2009-04-14 21:33:00,14,"I am going to Lac Seul in July and ran across Lost Island Lodge (http://www.lostislandlodge.com/front_page), which is located - as the name indicutes - on an island not too far from Hudson. The cost to stay there ($85 per night) is a bit more than what I typically spend on ""bring your own boat"" lodging when I make the trek north, so I'd like to know if anyone has stayed there before, what the accommodations/cabins were like, and if the experience (privacy... nice to get away from phones and car traffic) was worth a few extra dollars? Also, how was the fishing in the area? Were the hosts/guides helpful finding walleye fishing around/near the resort?Any other words of wisdom or resorts I should take a look at in that area?Thanks, in advance, for any help!"
1097256,Ron Triplet,2009-04-15 09:30:00,3,"I checked out the site you mentioned, did you check out the extra charges section? It looks like you are pay $85 per night plus bringing your own boat you will need to pay $18 per night to park on the dock? Plus taxes, seems alittle spendy to pay $103 per night plus taxes for a bring your own boat trip where you do all the cooking?"
1097268,ii4me,2009-04-15 09:46:00,20,We go there every year and find the accomodations fine. I agree that it seems kind of spendy but I'm not sure you will find anything on Lac Seul less expensive.
1097320,teddi,2009-04-15 12:06:00,349,try lac seul evergreen lodge in ear falls. the daily rate is cheaper and includes every thing. an other one is lac seul gold eagle. their rates are a little cheaper.
1097456,maverick,2009-04-15 19:54:00,24,"I am going on this trip with LuvnWalleyes... It looks like both of those other resorts are on the other end of the lake...we have never been over West so we would like to stay over on the southwest end... When you look at all of the other resorts prices; it looks like we are getting a pretty good deal... Has anyone else stayed at Lost Island Lodge? It really looks like a nice place, so we hope so...we are looking forward to a new place. Anybody have any good spots near this place? We normally go to Deception Bay and north from there...we are open to other options around the lodge though.."
1098057,nervous knotter,2009-04-18 09:05:00,211,"I used to go there regularly up until 4-5 years ago. We got moved around on our dates by the owner, Jim, 2 years in a row at the last minute and it was a problem for a few of our schedules.The cabins ,dock, and service were really good. Great setup! Nice folks! Early season is good all over close to camp. Later June -August you may have to make some longer runs."
1098079,joeman79,2009-04-18 12:27:00,417,"We are going there the first week in August and I have talked to a bunch of past guests. Got both good and bad reviews. Way more Good than Bad I will add. They all have said it is a great place and fishing is good, and the Boats and Cabins are nice. And that the staff was always nice and helpful. Guides were good. Some of the things they did not like were. No bathrooms in Cabins. There is a common Bathroom. I checked into that and every cabin has a sperate bathroom in commons. Your bathroom Number is same as cabin Number, and only you have a key to that bathroom. Some people wanted bathroom in cabin so choose not to go back. But most all of the people I talked did not have a problem with it. And there was a couple who thought they had ala carte pricing, that was not very clearly published. Like one guy said they had a guide for the day and after supper took out a camp boat and were charged for a full days rental. I do not know if they stayed for the 6 nights which is a package price or if they were just staying for a couple days. And they charge You 5 bucks a day to park your car in a secure area. And that minnow prices they thought were high. I called Shane and talked to him about all these issues and I was satisfied with all his answers. If u do a search u can read pretty much what I have written. Sounds like a great place to me. And they have a lot of repeat customers. 4 and a half months from now I will send in a report on my expierence."
1098268,brwhite,2009-04-19 09:01:00,41,"I have been going to lost lake for the past 10 years around the first week of June. We started at a place off vermillion and would trailer our boats in and live in a popup, boy that was cheap. That placed closed and we ended up at Lac Suel Resort thats just to the south of Lost Island Lodge for a few years. The past few years we've switched to Lost Island Lodge. It's a bit more pricey than LSR but there are a few finer points to LIL.We really like it there. Though we've never used them the guides are great for swapping spots with. The owner, Shane, has treated us really well too. I'll be there this year june 6th-13th.I'm very familiar with the lake to the West of the resort (lost and webster) so if you're looking for some spot ideas send me a PM and maybe you can help me out with a few up in deception as I'm planning to go that way for the first time this year."
1098475,Luvnwalleyes,2009-04-19 21:52:00,14,I would gladly share some spots in Deception with you for some information around/near Lost Island Lodge. Let me know how you want to make this happen... I typically fish the SE end of Deception Bay and between there and Sen Bay... those areas have treated me well (most of the time).
1098477,Luvnwalleyes,2009-04-19 21:54:00,14,"Common bathrooms? That's news to me... oh well. I am hopeful there is a shower to use? They charge $5 a day to park your car at the secure landing, huh? It seems like there are a few hidden charge and unknowns at the LIL, but that's my own fault for not checking into it more."
