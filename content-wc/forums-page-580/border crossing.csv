I am scheduled to go to canada on the 28th of this month and return on the 6th of june, and I don't have a passport yet. I am starting to wonder what to do. By the way this is going through Windsor/detroit area."

I haven't heard anything about them pushing this deadline back like so many of the other ones they set. I sent for a passport for myself and my son and they returned to us in a bout three weeks. I noticed there is a way to rush a passport through but didn't pay much attention to it. That may be an option for you. Good luck, TonyO"

I was in Toronto a few weeks ago, drove across the border at Niagara, the Candadian customs didn't even ask for my drivers liscense, much less a passport (that has never happened when I've crossed at International Falls). When I was coming back into the states the agent asked for my passport."
