1104187,adempsey,2009-05-11 20:23:00,963,"I stayed at Pleasant Cove for a week last year mid-summer.Fishing was so-so for me, but it was my first time in the area. I hope you have a GPS though, there are a lot of rocks in some places that aren't marked. The locals try to mark what they can but these often end up under the water and hard to see until it's too late.I mostly fished shoreline weedbeds. They are all over the place. I never ventured out too far, although I did take a ride out to where Georgian Bay opens up. I had some success with Bass at a weedbed that is north of the camp. You basically take a right as you come out of the cove and just keep going. You will pass a small island, some cottages (Ronald McDonald House was one of them) and end up at a very small ""bay"" between the two small islands (they are very small, like 1 cottage islands). There was a nice weedbed on both sides of this. I think you will know when you see it. Although, bass are out of season it's probably still a good spot for pike. Further north there is a weedy and shallow bay (before sturgeon bay or lake...forget the name). I figured this area would be awesome for pike/musky fishing. I never caught much here though, but I figured it would be better in spring/fall.The area near the ""shipwreck"" (it's a small steam boat or something, ask and they will show you) looked promising too. Lotsa thick weeds in 10-15 feet of water next to a drop of 30-40 feet. This is straight out from the cove past the marina. Some people had success there that week, not me though.Anyway, I caught fish all over the place, but no area was particular hot for me. There is so much structure it's hard to fish it all. I barely even scratched the surface the area is so huge.The walleye are supposed to be further out near the more central island (probably doesnt help, I will look it up). A little bit of a drive to get to, but nothing horrible. Just pay attention to the markers and designated routes.I used tubes and grubs a lot. Wacky-rigged Senkos for bass. White spinnerbaits worked well too. I only caught pike and bass on my trip.I really wanted to go back in the fall for Musky fishing but never managed to. There were many areas that looked great for musky fishing.I will pull out my GPS and give you some waypoints where I caught some fish. Doesn't mean these are great spots or anything, but they may work for ya.Nice resort btw. If you're renting a boat btw, the depth/fish finder is extra."
