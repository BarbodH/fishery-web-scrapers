The only fish we keep each day is what we eat, which is under our limit. My question, is what is the legal thing to do with the remains? Typically, we set everything left, on the rocks, and within minutes the gulls have it cleaned up. Is this okay to do, or should we be putting the remains in a garbage bag and bringing them back to camp?"
1104088,Steve of Madison,2009-05-11 13:32:00,230,"Good question, we bring all of the trash remains back to camp but the scaps? I feel the gulls have to eat too."
1104129,Larry Mac,2009-05-11 16:23:00,530,"We do the same as you and Steve, trash back to camp and fish remains to the Gulls. Seeing the Gulls reactions to our boats and Shore Lunch spots (They gather extremely quick), I believe we are not alone in our practices. LOL. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1104152,Bigfishhunter,2009-05-11 17:31:00,803,"That is the best way, the gulls and pelicans make short work of any and all fish remains. When guiding in Northern Manitoba, I had a group that really liked one particular shorelunch spot. It was a big crew, with guides for every boat. We used this spot daily and left a big pile of fish everyday. Each day it was as if we were coming back to a spot that hadn't been touched in a week. The birds cleaned it up very very fast."
1104182,Pooch,2009-05-11 20:05:00,4619,"I've always marveled at how a gull can take an entire fish carcass down in one gulp! They are surely conditioned to an easy shore lunch meal. All you need do is pull into shore and a ""scout"" shows up. Soon there are several of them. Have you ever noticed that they have a defined pecking order also? Pooch"
