1103038,Wheres Waldo,2009-05-06 21:01:00,43,I start making blocks of ice a month ahead of time. They last alot longer then cube ice. I sneak my wifes bread pans in to the garage freezer.
1103203,alanexpup,2009-05-07 13:04:00,278,"Hi. we have been going up there so long that a long time ago we got 3 of those big storage bins with covers. what we use in canada we leave in those 3 containers. whatever comes out for cleaning and such goes right back in. kitchen stuff, bathroom stuff, fishing stuff. it all fits in the boat and helps keep the boat cover from filling with water on rainy trips to canada. have not forgotten anything since we started doing it this way."
1103246,chevtow,2009-05-07 16:23:00,691,"I fill gallon and half gallon milk jugs with water for my block ice, keeps my food good and cold the whole trip . I've got 2 growing boys so no need to save jugs up, gimmee a week and I've got tons."
1101817,Larry Mac,2009-05-01 18:54:00,530,"Hello Alanb, That is really amazing. Planning and organizing is part of the experience. You gave me some very good ideas. Thank you,Larry Mac"
1101830,Golden Eagle,2009-05-01 20:04:00,2642,"Wednesday around noon I was sitting at my desk feeling sorry for myself because October arrived and I hadn't squeezed in one more fishing trip. Almost without realizing what I was doing I dialed my outfitter and learned he'd be picking up his young son after school Friday and flying out to camp. I was out of my driveway Thursday morning and caught the flight at 4 p.m. Friday after 1500 miles on the road. My black lab and I had the lake to ourselves until moose hunters arrived 8 days later. The will to go fishing sometimes overcomes organization. Did the same thing a couple of years later. An October fishing trip makes my winters better. One May I was talking with my outfitter the week before the opener and he mentioned having a large cabin available. Said he'd accept a party of two. Called a fishing friend in Chicago and the gal on the phone said he wasn't at his desk. Told her it wasn't business, but about a fishing trip. He picked up the phone in the break room and gave me a yes in less than 30 seconds. Four days later we were fighting through ice to get to fish."
1101889,Skywagon,2009-05-02 07:01:00,1106,"Didn't you guys hear Canada is not going to let you in this year because of the H1N1 flu (we don't use that other term)? Don't fret it though, because I promise to send out pictures. It will seem like you are there, without having to spend all the money on Canadian beer."
1102016,alanb,2009-05-02 20:40:00,56,Thanks for the kind words Larry Mac. I'm a bit behind as I have yet to order my cigars. Maybe tonight. Alanb
1102018,joeman79,2009-05-02 20:47:00,417,"if a guy wanted to buy a few cigars to take up and smoke what would you suggest for a really mild cigar. I used to smoke a few and i can not remember the name. Something Macanudo Spelling probably wrong. Thanks, Joe"
1102023,rockpt,2009-05-02 21:46:00,589,"Hey Joe, I see you're from Ks. If you're near Kansas City, stop by Diebels on the Country Club Plaza. They have a huge walk-in humidor and huge selection. There's a guy who works there who knows everything there is to know about cigars and he'll pick out your cigars for you. Just tell him what you like. As for trip planning, we've been keeping a video journal of our trips since 2001. We have about 40 hours of video of our last 18 trips. As the summer trip approaches, we start watching all the videos of our previous summer trips. Fun to watch and helps us remember what to bring, where we've caught fish, what went right and wrong. I'm always surprised how much I've forgot until I see it on video. Then we do the same thing for the fall trip. Regardless how well I try to plan, it seems there's always some last minute thing to do with my boat or trailer. Always running around the week of the trip getting my bearings repacked, replacing a tire, adding a new sonar or some **** thing."
1102426,alanb,2009-05-04 20:53:00,56,"Joe, If you're not sure what you like, I second Rockpt's viewpoint to find a good local shop and go ask for help. I would be shocked if you didn't get good advice on what to buy from a reputable place. They want you to come back and buy more! For my 2 cents, for a major name you can't go wrong with go with an Aston or Fuente. Unless your looking to buy boxes at a time and have some knowledge on what you want, the on-line cigar stores will be very confusing. Interesting idea on the video journal. Unless your a pro making meticulous notes the video will pick up a lot of details that you forgot about. What do you capture? Details on lure, weather, ? What has jumped out at you over the years of taping that is most useful? Curious to learn more. Alanb"
1102443,joeman79,2009-05-04 23:27:00,417,I live in the middle of nowhere. I will have to order online or find a shop one the way. I remembered the cigar I liked it is a Macanudo Portifino. So thats probably be what I order.
1102527,alanb,2009-05-05 09:28:00,56,I sent you a PM on on-line site suggestions. Hope it helps. Alanb
1102656,rockpt,2009-05-05 16:54:00,589,"Alan, We tape a few times a day for a few minutes each time. Just document where we fished, what we caught, the weather, what's going on around camp, anything funny or unusual, etc. The weather and fishing is most useful when watching past trips and planning for next year. And there've been lots of late night poker games that were taped, moose or deer getting brought back to camp by hunters in the fall, eagles swooping down to snatch crappie floaters in the fall crappie spots, shorelunches, ****tails on deck at sunset, bats loose in the cabin and all sorts of crazy nonsense that always makes us laugh regardless how many times we've seen it. I imagine will be lots of laughs for our families when we're old or gone, too."
1101411,Babamel2,2009-04-30 11:48:00,414,"As you plan your fishing trips, what have you already done to get prepared? Do you have a planning schedule, like, Make sure this ... is done two months prior, and this .... is done one month, and what do you leave for final days?"
1101414,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-04-30 11:51:00,138,Probable should. But that is wayyyy too organized for me.
1101424,Glenman12,2009-04-30 12:19:00,762,"well, I made sure everyone got their documents..most already had their passports but a few didnt...they do now..everyone ordered their outdoor cards and licenses and all have those now..in a week or two we will have a meeting and decide who is going to do our shopping for food and such..other than that its just a matter of respooling reels, restocking lures and jigs etc but everyone is on their own for that"
1101443,Jigmatt,2009-04-30 13:00:00,9,"I have lists on the PC one for gear, (rods, reels, first aid kit, raingear, etc) and one for our food. I usually update them every year. We're leaving in 4 weeks, so I will be looking for deals on any of the nonperishable food items, (coffee, paper towel, sugar ,flour, etc.) and will have all that purchased and packed. The morning we leave there's one trip to pick up eggs, bread, milk, etc. This seems to save alot of time rather than having to pack everything at the last minute. Use the lists to double check as we load the truck. I usually print out the gear list for my dad who's 76, just so he doesn't forget anything. Takes a little pre-trip planning but really helps out."
1101630,Tonyo,2009-05-01 05:27:00,212,"I don't really start the gather and packing process until about a week or so before we leave, which is exactly 27 days from today. I am a little less organized than some of the others on here but it all seems to get along without missing too much. I did forget a very important part of the boat last year though, my 8' antenna for my marine radio. Luckily our camp owner new the guys at the marina in Red Lake and they loaned me one for the week. Maybe I should be a little more organized. TonyO"
1101648,Glenman12,2009-05-01 06:34:00,762,"I big on the lists too..lots of the guys accuse me of being anal with the lists and all...but I dont forget things, they do"
1101734,worthsr,2009-05-01 11:13:00,52,I order spinner rigs for our entire group(8). The order has been placed and the rigs are in the mail. New line has been spooled and is ready to go. I have my licence and outdoor card and have asked the others to order theres. Confiming everyone's passports are valid is important. Like others have mentioned I'm big into the lists. They have been refined after 20+ years and make preparing for the trip much easier. Especially grocery shopping. Only 50 more days until I arrive!
1101752,alanb,2009-05-01 12:39:00,56,"Gotta have lists and target dates. I have one for the group and one for myself. I freely admit I'm anal when it comes to organizing, but like Glenman12 I never forget anything. Three weeks out: Order sat phone, make float plan, confirm # of people. I review and re-organize my tackle box which gives an excuse to visit the local Bass Pro and Cabela's several times! Two weeks out: Finalize grocery list. We've been doing the trip for over 20 years, so this list is organized by the layout of the store so we can zip right through in a 1/2 hour. One person handles the produce section while the others knock out the rest of the list (list is printed on several pages for distribution). I order cigars on-line so they show up in time. One week out: Maintenance checks on the vehicle making the drive from IL to Canada and back. Didn't do this one year and we're driving around Duluth, MN in a downpour looking for replacement wiper blades! Day before: Receive sat phone and e-mail float plan out to everyone so they have the contact info. Pack bag and gear from checklist. Smoke a cigar that showed up last week and ponder if I need to make one more trip to the sporting goods store before we leave in the morning. I'm in the boat in two weeks. Can't wait to hit the road. Alanb"
1101807,Obabikon,2009-05-01 18:01:00,2370,"I've been packing my suburban for more than a week. I have two lists... one list of everything in the car... the other list is things I need to ""declare"" to the government. They seem to like the organization."
1101810,Guest,2009-05-01 18:10:00,0,"I put my list together the day before, works for me."
