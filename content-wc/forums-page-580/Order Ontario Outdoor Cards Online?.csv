My question is, is that the MNR website says you can order your fishing license right then with the ""card"". I plan on getting an 8 day license. Can I ""date"" that license for when I will be there online or do I have to buy the license when I am there because I am not getting a full season license??thanks for any help and good luck this fishing season."
1102952,Glenman12,2009-05-06 14:06:00,762,you can call the MNR at 1-800-667-1940..you can order both the outdoor card and license at the same time..on the license they will ask you the dates you will be fishing and mark those dates on it..the license and temporary card came in the mail in 8 days..the temporary is only paper but you have to have it with you and the license when out fishing up there...the plastic card will be mailed at a later date..
1102956,jswinter40,2009-05-06 14:15:00,127,"thanks, will do!"
1103001,Moondog,2009-05-06 17:54:00,362,I checked with the owner of the place we stay and she always is able to provide licenses and says she has all that is needed for the outdoor card as well. Would think that once you arrive in Canada you could pretty much get both license and outdoor card without any trouble. Maybe you don't need to do this by mail???
1103009,Glenman12,2009-05-06 18:48:00,762,Im not really sure ...I know theres a list of the bait shops/tackle stores somewhere on line where you can apply for your outdoor card and then get your license at the same time..Im pretty sure its not all of them...for us its just a time issue and doing it by mail was more convenient for us...Im pretty sure the MNR website would have the list of the shops
1103030,scar,2009-05-06 20:45:00,196,i am confused. i thought the outdoor card is needed next year. do i need one to buy a non resident license this year?
1103074,Glenman12,2009-05-07 05:23:00,762,"The outdoor card is needed from now on ..the one you purchase this year for $9 is good for 3 years...and yes, you also have to purchase a license this year..once you have the outdoor card, starting next year you will be able to order your license online.."
1103149,jswinter40,2009-05-07 09:16:00,127,"yes, I do believe you can get the license and card up there when you arrive. I was looking to get this in advance because it never seems like a fast process at the bait shop we use in Sioux Lookout. I get too excited and to be able to grab our minnows at 6am and get to deception bay ASAP. can't wait, every time is like the first."
