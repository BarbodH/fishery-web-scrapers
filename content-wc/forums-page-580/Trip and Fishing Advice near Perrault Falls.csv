I've got a couple different questions: I'm coming from Lincoln, NE and I have to go through Sioux Falls, SD first; knowing that which port of entry should I use? Pembina or International Falls. Maybe one of you guys from SD or ND could help me out with that one. Secondly, This is my first trip to Florence lake and the Perrault Falls area. I'm not taking my boat and I wold like to keep my options open for fishing other lakes. Do any of you have any suggestions for other lodges that might rent boats by the day where there is some easy (relative term) walleye fishing? Thanks, Ron"

1103630,Guest,2009-05-09 11:12:00,0,Thanks for the info Teddi. Have any of you guys fished Florence Lake or used Skyline Lodge? Just wandering what kind of fishing I'm going to find there in late July.
1103636,teddi,2009-05-09 11:27:00,349,"florence lake is a small lake with no access to other lakes. fishing should be so so in july depending on weather. northern,perch and some walleye are all you can expect. there are a lot of other lakes close by you can drive to for a days fishing. your resort should have a boat on a trailer you can use. if you want more info pm me."
1103682,Moondog,2009-05-09 15:47:00,362,Definitely Pembina as it is interstate all the way to the border and no huge towns to go thru like Minneapolis/St Paul. Then once across the border take 75 to Morris then east on 23 thru Steinbach and then up to Canada Hwy 1. You can avoid Winnepeg this way.

If you are having trouble catching fish, ask Jeremy to take you out for a day to show you some different spots. Florence is only 800 acres but the fishing is good. Hit the bays by Gull Rock for big northern in the afternoon."
