1103932,Hawker,2009-05-11 05:10:00,3967,"From what I'm reading you are required to have a letter from his parents if he/she is under the age of 18. Here is a copy and pasted portion of what I'm reading from and followed by the link to it's source. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bringing children into Canada Border services officers are on alert for children who need protection. Children under the age of 18 seeking to enter Canada are classified as minors and are subject to the entry requirements set out under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5082-eng.pdf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If it were me, I'd make sure I had that letter in hand when crossing!! We are taking our 16 year old Grandson with us this year and I've already gotten the letter stashed in my truck with our passports."

1103947,Guest,2009-05-11 06:15:00,0,"When I take my children into Canada (both under 18), I have a letter from their mother that states: a) I have permission to take them into and out of Canada on vacation b) the dates of the trip (the day entering and leaving spelled out) c) the location we will be staying d) and the letter is signed and noterized to make it official Also, make sure the child has a passport. Once I present all our passports and the letter to the border guard, I can see their expression change because we are following the rules and we zip through the rest of the border crossing. Cheers....IA Walleye"

1103973,Guest,2009-05-11 07:36:00,0,"Having a passport for children will make the process much easier but, in some cases a passport is not required. There are some items that will you will need if you are transporting children across the border. The permission letter (notorized) with all the info as posted by IA Walleye is a must. Here is the info from the US passport web site. Hope this helps out. Wallace On June 1, 2009, the U.S. government will implement the full requirements of the land and sea phase of WHTI. The proposed rules require most U.S. citizens entering the United States at sea or land ports of entry to have a passport, passport card, or other travel document approved by the Department of Homeland Security. CHILDREN: U.S. citizen children under the age of 16 will be able to present the original or copy of their birth certificate, or other proof of U.S. citizenship such as a naturalization certificate or citizenship card. Groups of U.S. citizen children ages 16 through 18, when traveling with a school or religious group, social organization, or sports team, will be able to enter under adult supervision with originals or copies of their birth certificates or other proof of citizenship. See the Department of Homeland Security's GetYouHome.gov for more information on the changing travel requirements."
