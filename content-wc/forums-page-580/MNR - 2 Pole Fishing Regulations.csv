I know it is illegal to fish w/2 poles in Ontario(I never would) but the stories seem to indicate if your line was dangling over the edge of the boat it would be ""fishing"" w/2 poles. I have looked at/for the regs and it is not very specific. Any experiences people can highlight in this area or where the laws might be more clearly defined?"

If you need clarification on where to store your other rod when not in use then I would say in the boat would be the route to go. The MNR are not the Gestapo looking to bust innocent anglers, but they do have to deal with people who are liars & law-breakers on a daily basis. Just keep in mind the regulations and conduct your business accordingly.....everything will be fine."

On one boat we could see they were empyting something into the lake from small cans. they emptyed quite a number of these things and the visitors left. I think the visitors could have been quite nasty if they wanted to be ,everyone near that boat got the message. Just as it should have been."
1103321,Guest,2009-05-08 05:23:00,0,The rules say 1 line. If you're fishing with two you're breaking the law and you're also fishing in the wrong place on the lake. If you need more than 1 rod to fish here you might want to work on your fishing skills as well.
