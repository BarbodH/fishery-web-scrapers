1102359,bogey,2009-05-04 16:47:00,87,"I started doing flyins with my father 15-20 years ago. One of the things that I remember about the first fly-in with our group were the evenings and the day we could not get out due to the weather (40'S and rain). Cribbage, cards and drinking lots of hot choclate/coffee. Someone will always do something that you will laugh about for years. Be sure that you have something to keep the kids intertained in the event you cannot get out. Hopefully it works out and you have a great trip. It has grown into an annual event for my father and I."
1103720,eyemike,2009-05-09 19:58:00,233,"I took my Daughter when she was 9 and several years after that. Treat the boys like you would your adult fishing buddies. Get their input on how they would like to fish. I would bet that they will read just about anything they get their hands on on the how catch them part. My daughter is 25 now and remembers Canada like yesterday, it actually made her a very good fisherman. She remembers the total freedom she got with me up there, sharing ideas and giving imput. Friends sharing a dream. Mike"
1101888,pegasis0066,2009-05-02 06:53:00,64,"I have been on about six Canadian fly in trips with by friends over the years, but this June will be the first with my 14 year old son (and another father/son). In the past, we would always target pike by trolling around points and casting over weed beds. The only walleye we would catch would be those caught trolling or casting. We would try jigging in some areas, but found it to be too boring. So, a good day on the lake would be 20-30 fish vs 50-100 claimed possible by the outfitter.With two 14 year olds with us this year, how can we catch more fish? Is jigging the only way to get numbers like 50-100/day? Thanks"
1101890,thunderatwork,2009-05-02 07:02:00,79,"ask the outfitter for suggestions on good walleye spots, use yor dept finder to locate the exact spot , jigging minnows works well for us."
1101907,dutchboy,2009-05-02 07:54:00,5717,"While catching fish is the ultimate goal for you don't assume the kids will feel the same way. Personally I would do the numbers thing for the Pike. Do a bit of Walleye fishing. Then let then explore the islands and shorelines. A nice fire with shore lunch will break up the day for them. Let them be boys. After a break ask them if they want to try for Pike or Walleyes again. Might be they just want to troll and look at things they have never seen before.Hardest thing to sometimes remember is, you have been on these trips before. You are into fishing and ""getting your moneys worth"". The kids will be excited about the trip because it's new and because dad always has a great time. You can't force feed fun, specially if your fun differs from theirs. First day show them all the options, then let them choose what they would like to do the rest of the trip.Remember this trip is for them. You can hard core fish with your friends anytime. This trip is about getting the kids involved with the sport to spend time with you in the future. Take it slow and remember ""boys will be boys"".Have a great trip."
1101926,Moondog,2009-05-02 09:23:00,362,"We started taking my son to Canada when he was around 10. He enjoyed everything but when we started letting him take a friend then the magic happened. So let him fish in the boat for part of the day with the other 14 yr old!!! As much as you want to spend time with him and put him on tons of fish, he will have a much better time with a peer and you can watch the fun a short distance away. Then make special times when you are alone with him as well. I assume that one of them will have to get permission from the camp host to operate the boat. The other thing we did was have contests........boys vs. Dads, biggest fish, most fish etc. One time we had a running week bet. $1 for the first, $1 for the biggest of each species that day, $1 for most in a day......and keep a running total. At the end of the week, he owed me $13 and I took it out in labor!!! fun times"
1101942,JayM5209,2009-05-02 10:37:00,1050,"You're about to have one of the great times of your life, and hopefully start a tradition that continues for years! I took my son on his first Canadian fishing trip for his 16th birthday present (his b'day is in mid-May). 27 years later we still do it. He hasn't made every year, what with college, early jobs, teaching middle school, etc., but we look forward to every trip, and we cherish all those weeks on NW Ontario lakes.One suggestion for your trip. If the lakes you'll be fishing have perch populations, find a school and let the boys catch dozens and dozens. Those huge jumbo Ontario perch can be a blast to catch and make an easy, good meal. The boys will have as much fun catching the big perch as they will the less frequent walleyes. They're easy, too. A yellow or chartruese crappie jig with a small piece of crawler is all you need. Might be easier for the boys if you put the little jig under a slip bobber. My son loves walleye fishing, but he always had a feel for and skill with the perch. On his first trip to Canada he established his reputation as the perch pro and when we get into the jumbos, he always outfishes the old timers who think of themselves as the experienced experts!Have a great trip with the boys. Neither they nor you will ever forget it."
1101965,pegasis0066,2009-05-02 14:50:00,64,"Agree, I already told the other father that we need to do this after a day or so. This trip started when after two years of not saying much about a Montana fly fishing trip (my son's first real fishing experience other than a small farm pond), he asked if we could go back to Montana this summer. I was rather shocked as he really didn't seem that excited by the experience. However, it blessed my heart to see that he had gotten the bug. I think this Canada trip will see to it that he will never be ""well"" again.Thanks to everyone for their suggestions."
1101999,pikepaul,2009-05-02 18:30:00,16,So where have you decided on going?
1102100,pegasis0066,2009-05-03 15:20:00,64,"We are going to Kaopskikamak Lake (aka Crooked or Krooked Lake) NE of Emo, Ontario with Canadian Fly In Outpost. The lake is 10-15 miles long and apparently has four species: walleye, smallmouths, northerns, and lake trout."
1102136,Wall-i-Lama,2009-05-03 18:36:00,1524,"Pegasis, I'd go with the numbers you get trolling and casting and let the two boys dictate the rest. Based on my past experiences with my two boys what counts most on a fishing trip is........who skipped a rock the most times, who spotted the most turtles, who could eat the most potato chips and of course the ""who peed thier pants laughing champion"". Have a good trip!"
1102155,Moondog,2009-05-03 20:34:00,362,Oh and don't forget the hours spent making a sand alligator sculpture! So much for the fishing!!!!!
