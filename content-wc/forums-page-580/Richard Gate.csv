1103096,Ia Walihntr,2009-05-07 06:35:00,320,"Rick, Satellite photos from yesterday the 6th show ice still in Big and Little Traverse Bays, Shoal Lake, and an area near the Barrier Islands. Big Traverse ice is pushed up against Big Island and Bigsby Island. You can't get out the south end of Basil Channel. If you want to look at the satellite, Here is the web address:http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/ Click on ""Modis Today"" On the next screen, click on the LOTW area. On the next screen, be sure you are on USA3 and then click on 250 miles. On the next screen, just scroll down to LOTW. Marv"
