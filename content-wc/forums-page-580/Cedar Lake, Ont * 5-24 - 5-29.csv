1103026,Rich B,2009-05-06 20:27:00,1081,"I am from east central Ohio and am making my first ""pilgrimage"" to northwest Ontario with a few friends and my twin brother (he lives in the Milwaukee area) to drive to Cedar Lake Lodge. My personal Ontario experiences have been up in the French River and Georgian Bay areas, as well as north of North Bay and Wawa....have read numerous articles (and reports on Walleye Central) of the great fishing in western Ontario, so giving it a try in a few weeks. We've booked a 6 day package at Cedar Lake Lodge (bringing in our own boats) in two weeks - does any one know the approximate ""real"" drive time from Milwaukee to the Lodge ? (not counting wait time to cross the border ?) The camp's website states it's about 700 miles. Secondly, anyone have any suggestions or tips for fishing this lake - the website notes that you can boat into Perrault, Davenport, etc and other lakes....way too much water to even check out in (5) days. If you have any recommendations, would appreciate your information - we're fishing mainly for walleye, though pike, musky and bass action is always a bonus. Thanks....will write up a report when I get back to Ohio. Faith, Family, Friends......and Fishing ! Rich B"

In the early years it was a 17 hour haul. Now, since it's all four-lane interstate-like highway from Milwaukee to almost Int'l Falls, you should be able to do it in about 13 hours, assuming several drivers to spell each other and one longer stop for a meal somewhere....that's 13 hours to your Cedar Lake camp, including a stop in Vermillion Bay to buy a license, gas, etc. If you can plan your trip to go thru Int'l Falls before 8 a.m. or after 5 or 6 p.m., you minimize waiting time, especially if it's a Saturday.Look in the Muskie Central ""General Discussion"" forum (just below this one on the Message Board menu) for a recent thread titled ""Cedar Lake ON mid-July."" I'll be on the next lake north of you (Jackfish) the same week you're there. We drop our boats into a different lake every day, but do not fish Cedar. Personally, I'd skip Perrault. There are way too many other lakes in the immediate area that I think are better walleye fishing. You'll have a great week!"
1103044,Guest,2009-05-06 21:38:00,0,"i stay at pickerel creek camp (just up the road from you). I have fished cedar lake a few times without much to show for it. But across the street from you is cliff lake and i have done very well with smallies and a few muskie. as walleye go, you are only about 20 min away from a public launch on lac suel. cedar lake maybe a good lake, I just havent put the time in there."
1103059,Guest,2009-05-06 23:30:00,0,"There are numerous post about Cedar Lake on this site. Use the search engine and you will bring up all kinds of threads full of information. I've never fished Cedar myself. Tend to go up to Wabaskang or Gull Rock, but from the threads and a couple people I know, the 'eyes are numerous, but tend to be on the small side...perfect for meals, smallies abound and if your into muskies, it is the place to throw the 1000 casts. Good luck! Craig"

1103090,teddi,2009-05-07 06:13:00,349,does don moore still have gold arrow. i heard this winter he had sold.
1103108,nitroman,2009-05-07 07:14:00,368,"Talk to Al when you get there from what I have read he seems to be helpful and will point you in the right direction. Our group stays at Cedar Point Resort and we fish the east leg mostly with a few trips to ""good"" spots on the west leg. There are great walleye there don't let the negatives sour you before you even try the lake. Glennman on here can help you also he fishes that side more than I do. If you do a search like others said you will find some of our posts and if that doesn't help you just pm me for some more. Ice out looks to be a week or so late. Good luck and I hope you catch a boatfull and let us know how you faired. Nitro...."
1103152,JayM5209,2009-05-07 09:28:00,1050,"Don and Sharon still own Gold Arrow. Will see them two weeks from tomorrow. Last year we tried to get Don to say when he was finally going to retire, but couldn't get anything out of him! I think the 1st year we went to Gold Arrow was the 2nd year they owned it, and we've been back every year since. It sure says something good about the camp, its owners/operators, the facilities and service when a group of pretty serious fishermen keep returning for 31 years!amb6ao, I'll wave at you on my way up Pickerel Creek! Pickerel is one of my all time go to lakes....along with Ord and Cliff."
1103182,Glenman12,2009-05-07 11:03:00,762,I already sent him a PM
1103541,Rich B,2009-05-08 20:57:00,1081,"My thanks to each of you for the info, and especially Glenman that sent me a private note. All much appreciated.......I tell my friends this is the best website hands down. Will post once I get back with details on the trip, and how the fishing turned out. Faith, Family, Friends.......and Fishing ! Rich B"
