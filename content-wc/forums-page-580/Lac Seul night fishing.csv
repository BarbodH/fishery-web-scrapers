Right up untill sunset there is usaualy a hot bite and then it cools off for a while. But if you got the hanging power, especially during a full moon fase, can be really good. Casting mostly."

We have fished the dam area a few times and have had some success. Do you fish it right up close to the dam? Is there a place you could fish it from shore or is it best to stay in the boat? We probably are all talk about going out for some more fishing. We usually are beat after all day on the water."
1100501,Guest,2009-04-27 12:39:00,0,"Chock, we have always done it by boat, but there are places on shore where you can cast. I think it all depends on how much water is being let through the dam, the less the better i think. Don't be afraid to use big baits either. Now I want you to understand that you won't catch 50 fish that time of night, but the potential of 5-10 23-28 inch walleyes are there. Try swimbaits, shallow running crankbaits, and big minnows. Three years ago during the full moon fase, we had terrible weather during the day and good clear conditions at night. We boated 10 walleyes a night in the 23-26 range. The last night a 28 was caught on a perch True Believer! Now I,m talking late at night, 11- 4 in the morning. The best way I can tell you if its worth going down there is take a look see when you come into town. If you see alot of boats or a bunch of locals standing on the left shore facing the dam, give it a try. If you need more info, I would be happy to share."
1102752,Jesse-WI,2009-05-05 21:16:00,534,"You missed it by a week as the full moon phase is the previous week. When the moon is full and there is ZERO wind you can have some fun once the bugs are gone. The bugs right after dark treat DEET like gravy. At the moon phase drops, you can not phantom just how dark it gets and the low lite GPS background like just messes up your night site. It is very dangerous as you can not see what is in front of you. I have heard night vision goggles work good, but it is really not work the effort or risk."
1103195,alanexpup,2009-05-07 12:37:00,278,"HI. If you fish any time during the darkness you will loose what little sleep time you might have had, If I remember correctly its dark up there about 10pm and starts getting light about 4am. night is only about 5 hours long up there. we used to stay out till the last second and by the time you clean the fish and have that 10pm dinner its midnight and by 4am its getting light. sleep fast."
1103199,stumcfar,2009-05-07 12:48:00,451,"We have often fished below that dam and have usually caught our biggest fish of the trip there. Normally we fished all day on the lake and then after supper went below the dam and fished until 9:30, never after dark. Typically a jig and minnow or a lindy type rig with a leech. Alot of snags, but a fun way to kill an evening."
1099213,chock,2009-04-22 09:15:00,19,"Hello, A group of us are heading to Lac Seul in the Ear Falls area for the 4th year in a row. We will be up there June 13 - 19th. I was curious if anybody fishes Lac Seul after dark to target some bigger females that come in shallow. Does anybody know of any good shore places to try? I know the mosquitoes and no-seeums would kill ya. Would it be worth the time?"
1099252,Guest,2009-04-22 11:03:00,0,"Hey Chock, How's your card game? I ask because overall, fishing on Seul at night is a waste. Being a reservoir, and being in a sandy area, Lac Seul is incredibly turbid and tanin (tea-stained), which gives walleye their predatory advantage of being able to see their prey when their prey can't as easily see them throughout the day. Overcast days and lower-light times still tend to outproduce sunny, midday conditions, but even then not all the time! Believe me, late-night fishing, with every combination of moon (illumination) and weather condition has been tried, with minimal success, compared to production earlier that day or the following day. And with that said, if you do still want the hassle of trying, the bugs are minimal two hours after dark. It's just from dusk (at the time you're there, that's about 10:30p.m.) for the next hour or so when the mosquitos will carry you away. Cheers, NWO Fishing Bum"
1099261,cspierings,2009-04-22 11:38:00,230,We tried it last fall with almost fatal results. Nearing sunset we caught some gorgeous fish but one thing about Lac Seul is that when it gets close to dark the exodus of boats kicks in. 3 guys in a big crestliner just about ran over my 17.5 boat with all the lights on. THe only thing that saved us from getting hit was my flashing a 3 million candle power spot light in their faces. They missed by at least a foot but did stop to let us know they weren't going to hit us and we got a whiff of the brewery from the boat. ONe of the drunks wasn't ready for the stop so he was just picking himself off the floor when the driver decided it was time to leave and just about tossed the guy getting up out of the back of the boat. I would be real careful about fishing it at dark in any of the areas where you get a lot of boat traffic. Those guys were drunk and just watching the TV sized GPS. Good luck.
1099271,chock,2009-04-22 12:22:00,19,Thanks for the responses. I was actually thinking the same thing about the water clarity and turbid conditions. There is no need for them to hide out during the day like they would in clearer lakes. I think we will leave the nights for cards and Kokanee.I thought they were pretty strict about drinking and boating up there. We have never brought alcohol in the boat.
1099282,teddi,2009-04-22 13:18:00,349,"i have fished a lot of times after dark on lac seul. if you are staying at a camp in ear falls a close place to go is under or around the railway bridge. you don,t have to worry about to many boats after dark and it is close to most of the camps in the area."
1099607,lunker99,2009-04-23 15:57:00,236,"Tried it once, never again. The walleyes bite was slow for us, but the mosquito action was hot! Have decided there are better ways to use the evening hours up there."
1099614,Steve of Madison,2009-04-23 16:20:00,230,"Tried it, more bugs than bites, navigation even with the backlit GPS was an adventure, and I really like to see the floating obstacles before I HIT THEM! Stick with the Kokanee, it's safer, tastier and more refreshing."
1099685,orchard frank,2009-04-23 22:44:00,1900,"There were a few times I fished in the late evening from the shore behind our cabin (Lost Island Lodge) bite got going pretty good, but as soon as it got almost full dark, the bite died. Maybe would have picked up later, didn't hang too long. I used to get up real early and try the dawn bite too, also not hot. As stated earlier, the stained water gives a good bite all day long. If you are up there and get one of those mirror flat days, try fishing shallow, I mean real shallow, 3-4', might surprise you. We had a few very memorable days casting jigs right up on the shore and bringing them into the water, seeing swirls as the walleye chased in a foot or less."
1099722,Glenman12,2009-04-24 07:38:00,762,I agree with you..why take the risks that are out there...we fish Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls...we stay out til dark but by then have moved into the narrows across from our resort which we have in sight..when its just about fully dark we slow troll our way in...then its beverage time..
1099748,Larry Mac,2009-04-24 08:59:00,530,"Glenman12, I agree with all you guys. We fish really hard from AM to PM and then head back to camp at dark. Usually by then we have caught and released more fish then we would ever need. We then make dinner, and prepare for the next days adventure. In August the real hard core fisherman (The kids) will continue to catch walleyes off the dock until bedtime. Oh to be young again!!!Thank you,Larry Mac"
