Be warned though that our fishing doesnt consist of alot of walleye fishing, mainly northerns and smallies. We went early june and not too crowded and the fish were receptive, caught eyes for shore lunch only and had no trouble. Good luck in wherever you choose to fish as the economy probably has me stymied this year."

The fishing has been good however we have yet to put a Walleye in the boat over 28"" nor a Pike over 40"".We are going back again for another go around this spring.Last year we had quite a few northerns in the 36 to 38 inch class."

Caught 3 northern 38-41"" got one 28"" waleye last year. But Many walleye eaters slot 13 3/4- 17 3/4"" we stayed with only 16.5-17.75"" maintained limits everyday! Have to bail to Pike (Northern) because we have no problem filling limits everyday!! We will have to try to hit the Crappies this year to give us something else to fish. If you need help finding the fish call Paradise Cove for a cabin they'll put you on to the fish!! Dwuane **** and Gary Roach are champion fishermen and if you don't take there advice you might not have all the fun we do!"

I don't fish too much for walleye but can tell you without a doubt that the walleye fishing has gotten much better the past 2-3 years with the strict limits/size restrictions and lack of pressure. It still isn't what it was 15 years ago but seems to get better every year. The smallmouth and Muskie fishing is outstanding, northern not so good. If you want the big walleye you need to come up in August and hit Big Sand."
