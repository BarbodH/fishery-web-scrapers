1097138,Al-in-Warren,2009-04-14 20:19:00,1,"hey guys, headed up to Pakwash with a few pals last weekend in May.... any guess on whats gonna happen with the ice out??? My bud heard it was real thick this year, said we will probably be ice fishing! I dont own an auger but he said he'd drill me a hole by the dock. I know hes just being silly but not far from the truth this year!Landau Boats and Yamaha Outboards for me!"
1097336,hawkeyepierce,2009-04-15 13:05:00,4,Checkout this site is a blog from the owners of Packwashlake camphttp://pakwashlakefishing.blogspot.com/or this site for vikingisland blog which is in the area they are reporting 32 inches of icehttp://viking-island.blogspot.com/
1097393,Glenman12,2009-04-15 16:01:00,762,if they dont start getting some real warm weather ice out will probably be close to the opener like last year..
1097769,lakerlover,2009-04-16 19:34:00,7,"We have a group going to Little Vermilion, just north of Red Lake. Hope to be going in on May 8th for pre opener pike. We need input from members as to ice conditions in their area of Minnesota and Canada so we can track the ice out line. I have been monitoring temps at the Red Lake airport and it is only slightly ahead of 2009 but just had a spell of five days with no freezing temps. Last year there was a real cold snap in late April (24th-26th) with 12 inches of snow to cover the ice. Ice didn't go out until May 16th. And, Little V is a dark stained shallow bay lake. Trout lake is usually a week later Not sure about color and depth of Packwash. Lakerlover"
1097845,v-bay gord,2009-04-17 07:20:00,3168,"Lakerlover..........I will be posting ice out conditions here on Eagle Lake later this month on my blog ( www.eaglelakeblog.blogspot.com ). That might give you indications on what to expect up by Red Lake, which can be a week later."
1097866,Golden Eagle,2009-04-17 08:48:00,2642,"Lakerlover, I went in May 16 last year and will go in May 15 next month. You need rain and sunshine. Enid's blog for Viking has plenty of good info on ice conditions. Maybe the water lines won't be frozen this May. And maybe they will."
1098011,lakerlover,2009-04-17 22:52:00,7,"Thanks v-bay gord. I will monitor your blog. And, thanks Golden Eagle. I don't care as much about frozen water lines as frozen lake. Just need enough open water to get a float plane in and out. packwashlakefishing.blogspot.com is another good one and I like the optimism."
1098048,Golden Eagle,2009-04-18 08:21:00,2642,"Lakerlover, I'll be heading north even though ice might still be hanging around. One October all the rides were grounded and Balmer Motor Inn didn't want to put up my dog. I didn't want my dog to stay alone in my van so we spent two nights at Chukuni River Campground with Ralf. We had a bit of snow, but I managed to catch up on my sleep. Probably added months to my life. Beatrice and I were the only ones fishing Little Vermilion for a whole week. Not just a week of great fishing, but also a super experience. Picked up several huge pike, a bunch of walleyes and got my PB walleye floating a #9, clown colored Rap at the outlet. She must have made it past the flume dam because I'm pretty sure she wasn't born in LV. I'm not suggesting it, but if somebody in camp happens to butcher a nice pike during your stay, I'd like to have the head so I can cut out her gullet. Maybe wrap it and have it in Brett's freezer. Will tip my JSM with the gullet. I'm thinking you'll be using dead bait or possibly whipping your flyrod. I'm sure you know Bill, who is a regular before the walleye opener. Will see you May 15."
1098190,lakerlover,2009-04-18 22:42:00,7,"Golden Eagle, Yes Bill will be flying from Long Island to Chicago and driving up to Little V with us. His concern is getting here and being iced in at Sportsmans as happened to us in 2002. Tough to fly fish from the dock in 40mph blizzard. I have missed this trip the last two years and don't want anything to get in the way. Todd Crete, Illinois"
1099306,Pakwash Lake Camp,2009-04-22 15:31:00,17,"Drilled some holes today and there was 8 inches of slush, & 24 inches to the bottom of the hole. That leaves only 16 inches of ice. May the sunshine keep shinning!"
