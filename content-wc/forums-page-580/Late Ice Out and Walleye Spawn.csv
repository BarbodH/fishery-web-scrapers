1100508,Moondog,2009-04-27 13:25:00,362,So it looks like ice out will be later this year. For those with lots of years of early season fishing......I have this question. What effect do you think this will have on the fishing also assuming the walleye spawn will be late as well?
1100522,Golden Eagle,2009-04-27 14:01:00,2642,Hit the opener and enjoy it. Fishing will be outstanding. Eat only males. They'll be so glad to be touched by you that they'll let you know they're males. You might want to go barbless and avoid treble hooks and lures with multiple hooks. Handle them carefully. I hope it's just like last year's opener.
1100542,TightLines01,2009-04-27 14:42:00,2,"Our group has fished opening week several times over the last dozen years or so. From the sounds of it, this year we may be experiencing the latest ice out in the years we have gone up. I have heard the later the ice goes, the better the walleye fishing."
1100556,Moondog,2009-04-27 15:24:00,362,"Golden Eagle, Great!!! We NEVER eat anything larger than 17-18.......usually less. I have never been able to figure out why anyone would want to eat a walleye of breeding age >18 inches. It is my understanding that most 'eyes over 18 inches ARE females and that it takes 8 yrs for them to be old enuf to spawn. Thanks for your input!"
1100564,Golden Eagle,2009-04-27 15:58:00,2642,"Moondog, hope I didn't come off as scolding. Not my intent. In my excitement I maybe overstated on my post. Last May 16 our group was held up 3 hours waiting for a wind shift so we could touch down on our lake. Hope it's the same in 2009."
1100566,Obabikon,2009-04-27 16:00:00,2370,"It will help... you're definately more likely to see the big girls with a late ice out. As long as people are careful not to hurt the spawn, it should be a TON of fun! (as always)"
1100629,Moondog,2009-04-27 19:57:00,362,"Nope, didn't take that wrong at all.........I agree. And I am looking forward to meeting some of those big girls soon.....it is such a rodeo. I also liked the advice........barbless hooks. We go to great lengths to take care of the gals so that our grandkids can enjoy them as much as we do."
