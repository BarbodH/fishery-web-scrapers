6439286,Mojo-NC,2020-05-15 11:23:00,1929,"We fished just north of Lac Seul last September 5-16th. We experienced nice weather, cold, rain, wind, and the day we left it was a beautiful sunny day that got up to over 90 degrees. Not very different from fishing spring except that the fish were almost all 25-30' deep and were very hungry. There were very few bugs too, so that was a plus. I think I would like to add a fall trip every year. I also enjoyed very few people at that time of year. Traveling up and back was a piece of cake. This trip was a fly-in, so it was going to be peaceful no matter what once we got there with no other cabins on the lake."
6489224,DavKin,2020-10-05 07:55:00,104,Our group of six fished Birch Lake out of Timber Bay lodge last week Sept. 28 to Oct.2. Very nice rental cabin and boats. Beautiful lake with Canada like feel but fishing was very slow. No small mouth bass but plenty of rock bass. Biggest walleye was 18 inches. We may have caught a total of 20 walleye for the week on lindy rigs with live minnows or jigging raps in 20'+. Some occasional crappie up to 14 inches. Water temps started at 62 and dropped to 57. Fingers crossed that we can fish our Canadian outpost lake in August 2021.
6489230,prov1800,2020-10-05 08:10:00,5010,At least you got out.Did you try shallow water.Maybe lake was going through a turn over.I fished cedar lake last fri and had fish at 25 ft and 10 ft.Caught walleye and bass in both depths.That was in 55 f water temp.Fall is a transistion time and always have fish at diff depths.Hopefully canada will be open next year.
6489244,ri rory,2020-10-05 08:26:00,33,"My friends- I am a New Englander living and working in Florida. Great untouched walleye stocks abound in southern reservoirs. Most folks including me are just learning how to catch the walleyed beasts. If you are wanting a trip to make up for a lost Canadian adventure.... head south. Check out Lake lanier in Ga, lake Fontana in NC, lake chatuge ga/nc, lake Burton, Seed, and Rabun in Ga lake Blue Ridge in Ga, lake Hiwasssee in NC, Watuaga in Tn...and many more. All of these have excellant bass and walleye stocks. Most southern walleye are accidental catches. I am a Trout guy but we have started catching a few walleye now. Our biggest is 8 lbs. Many of these lakes have freshwater Stripers too The walleye head towards rivers in late Feb/mid-March to spawn. Winter fishing has most days in the 40-55 range. Wind is not an issue usually, as these are man made winding reservoirs. If this appeals to you-shoot me a PM as I can help with info and Lodging spots. I am at Lake Fontana Thanksgiving week, and Striper fishing lake Notteley in Ga 1/1-1/6 2021 Good Luck Be Safe Coach"
6435718,78dave,2020-05-09 07:37:00,53,So I was watching a TV show about mining in the Yukon and many of those workers are stuck in the US and cannot crossover. What was interesting as all those guys said once they cross they will have to do two weeks quarantine. That could change anyone wanting to go fish.
6435724,That Minnesota guy,2020-05-09 07:52:00,8293,My thoughts are we can do more for our Canadian friends by staying home and waiting for their government to open the border then complaining we can't go.
6435732,MikeAnkeny,2020-05-09 07:56:00,67,Just booked for Sept 12. Hope the Canadian government realizes we are out in the boat and not in the mosh pit.

My trip within Canada is less than a month out and we still don't know if we will goWe've still got 2 week isolation procedures in place for international travel. I know a few guys that had to go to the States for work and upon return had to self isolate for 2 weeks. Before they open the border to recreational travel they'll have to lift these self isolation protocols. As i type this, i am sitting on the couch listening to our Prime Minister deliver his daily update. I hate to say it fellas but I'll be shocked if any of you guys get up here to fish before September"

6435508,Hookhunter135,2020-05-08 17:00:00,129,I feel like on May 16 if it is extended another 30 days that’s when the true panic/realization will be for everyone that this season both hunting and fishing may not happen. This is uncharted territory clients and outfitters will need to reconcile contracts and come up with solutions. I hope their will be major bailouts for these outfitters because they will be losing an entires years if not more salary.

6435576,LoDo,2020-05-08 19:24:00,721,"Its been a Hawkeye state for years. Cyclone is supposed to be a basketball school, but thats not looking good either. I just don't have a good feeling about this border. No chance Canada simply gives a date as to when the border is open and 1000s line up in Int Falls, boat n trailer and we all simply go to our favorite camps or cottages. This is going to happen in phases, just like every state in US. Phase 1, blah blah blah, phase 2 blah blah blah... This thing draws out for months.. Canada isn't going to open the borders when Americans can't even dine in our own restaurants, workout in our gyms, etc.. Did you see Illinois 5 phases? Good grief. If I'm living in the midwest I'd just keep the summer clothes boxed up and prepare for Fall and Winter. Hopefully US owners and taxpayers of camps and cottages in Ontario are able to cross sooner than later. IMO, if you own property in Canada those folks should be able to cross soon. My two cents!"
6435578,That Minnesota guy,2020-05-08 19:31:00,8293,If your trip is before July you better have a plan B. I think ya all should go to Iowa.

6435682,Hookhunter135,2020-05-09 06:08:00,129,I just read an article including Canada’s phased plan to reopen the country. If it follows the timeline listed then fishing season and hunting season is all but a bust. In BC alone where I am headed they have a 4 phase reopening plan. Phase 3 is slotted from June until September. Not until phase 4 can international tourism recommence and there is no listed timeline for that. Pretty sure we can all bet on being home this year.

However I also have a very big hunting trip planned for Northern BC in September. I’d love to be optimistic and believe that the border will be reopened by then but the more I read the more concerned I become that the border closure will be nickel and dimed 30 day closures at a time until our fishing and hunting seasons are extinguished for this year.
6435300,tweedrules,2020-05-08 08:39:00,107,Stressed about Plan B. Our trip to the Gouin is 6/30-7/5. Should we be proactive and move it back to August? Should we cancel and move it to 2021? Hate to miss that trip. Look forward to it all year.
6435310,Hookhunter135,2020-05-08 08:53:00,129,It seems to me just reading between the lines that there is a huge reluctance to open the border anytime soon. It’s been stated by the higher officials that it will be many weeks till the border is open to recreational travel. I fear as we open our economy if it’s seen that there is a surge of cases (expected) that the border restrictions will continue. I’d like to say that the huge financial loss created by the outdoor industry will help to influence opening up travel but I’m not sure that’s going to be the case.

Fish Iowa, it is not like the state is without any fishing. After well over two decades of going to or across the border, many times twice per year, this year is not looking good at the moment. Does not mean things won't change and we sneak in a trip. But in the mean time there is plenty of fishing exploration right here in the Cyclone State."

6432952,prov1800,2020-05-02 15:43:00,5010,From what i understand with Ontario opening up is a 4 stage plan.Each stage is a 2 week period so thats 8 weeks crom what i gather.This is just to open up Ontario which is about as bad as New York down east by Toronto and east toward Quebec which is worse than Ontario.North Western Ontario is doing very well as far as cases goes as well as Manitoba and Sask.Seems we are in a good spot.We will have to see what happens in the east.Border wise is a federal deal but iam sure that wont open till all our provinces feel its safe.That would mean the US cases would have to really flatten out and with some states opening up and having huge crowds again on the beaches isnt very good for the social distancing.Anyways thats about my 2 cents.In old days it was talk about ice out which i did do a post on.Now we should should see when border opens.
6433264,kettyspanky,2020-05-04 04:54:00,271,My plan b will be heading to northern Wisconsin and fishing up there. We are scheduled for the 25th of July.

Does this mean they have a feeling the crisis won't be over by June 6? Article also states no news on border opening date. This article was dated May 3. Not sounding promising for May or June. Just reading between the lines. Dane county in Wisconsin just extended emergency stay at home till July15!

My wife had a stroke on July 3rd not long after we came back from the lodge last year so we only went fishing one more time before ice up. It was too soon after and she was definitely struggling with that much sensory input. She's doing much better now adapting to vision and short term memory issues, so we have a lot of missed fishing time to make up for this year."

They're being really cautious about restarting the economy and plannimg to do it slowly and incrementally.

6432942,coldtuna,2020-05-02 14:58:00,25,"I have only been fishing Canada for a few years and would be disappointed not to be able to make it up there with my son this year. But, here are a few alternatives that my son and I might pursue and others here might want to check out. Lake Tawakoni, TX - about 75 minutes east of Dallas. Loaded with white bass and hybrid white bass (average about 5 pounds). Also a great lake for catfish, with huge ones in the colder months. My son and I fished there in April 2018 and caught about 300 fish in 2 days. Reasonable price for up to 6 guys on a boat (approx $600 a day). Check out Tawakoni Guide Service -- https://www.tawakoniguideservice.com Venice, LA -- can be excellent for bull redfish (20-35 pounds) later in the summer starting about mid-July. 50 fish in a day is not unusual when you find them, with the option to get them on topwater if conditions are right. It's hot and muggy there that time of year. The town itself is not very picturesque, but when the fishing is good, its great. It's pretty reasonable cost wise for 2-3 guys to fish for several days. High Wind can make it tough to catch the bigger fish because they are usually in the shallow bays."
