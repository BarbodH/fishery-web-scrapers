I have a small Tracker V14 and know that I can't get too far upstream. I'm staying in Littlefork. The plans are to go up first week in October. I was hoping to be off the beaten path, but am now told that those river areas can be high volume traffic. Anyone have information on this? I don't want to fight for parking spot or zig zag between other boats. I'd rather go somewhere less congested if that's the case. I'd appreciate any help as I'm coming up from Kansas. Fished around Grand Rapids a lot, but not so far north. Thanks"

October is prime time and it can be busy, especially on Friday, Saturday and Sunday so it would be wise to stay off the weekend if you can. The Big Fork landing isn't as improved as Pelland and has very limited parking. People also camp there so there isn't much turnover in parking especially on weekends. You might want to consider going to Baudette and stay at one of the resorts on Wheeler's Point. There will be lots of people, but there is lots of room to fish and you can dock your boat on the water. This area will provide you with access to the lower Rainy River which, IMO is where the best October fishing is, Four Mile Bay and Lake of the Woods by Pine Island. Four Mile Bay and Lake of the Woods has great fall walleye fishing, but is wind dependent. However, over 3 or 4 days access is usually possible if not everyday. You also have the option to trailer your boat east on Hwy 11 to the Birchdale or Frontier landings if you want to fish further up stream. There is plenty of parking, but on weekends it can be a long walk. There is Lake Sturgeon to be had on the Rainy and 4 Mile Bay. Fishing for them is like cat fishing. Bring a heavy 9 foot cat rod with 80 lb braid, some 3.0 circle hooks and some river sinkers in 2 to 4 oz sizes. Anchor off and wait for the bite of your life. Bring a big net. Check Utube for vids on sturgeon fishing. Good Luck!!"
6486346,mms3rd,2020-09-23 11:56:00,148,I really appreciate that. I am guessing the Rainy will be even busier with the border closed. All the fish probably lined up on the Canadian side.
6486354,Baseline,2020-09-23 12:13:00,3207,"It is always busy on the Rainy this time of year, but if you stay off the weekend it's not all that crowded. Nice thing about the fall is that most people are fishing for walleyes so the boats are moving up and down the river and not congregating in one spot. My recommendation is run some bigger cranks or anchor off in mid river and pitch jigs and minnows or jigs with big paddle tail plastics. The border closure is probably adding a few people, but most of the resorts in Canada aren't very crowded in Oct catering mostly to hunters. I don't think it will have much of an effect."
