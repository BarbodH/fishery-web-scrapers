6487624,Bill Krejca,2020-09-28 12:02:00,6107,"Thanks for sharing, John. I noticed the area directly behind your wife holding the walleye had a particular type of weed (I don't know the name), but that type of weed seems to be a magnet for walleyes. My experience has been if those weeds are present, that is the first place I head for. Got any idea why they like it? Maybe in a true wilderness, it doesn't make as much difference, but even on quasi-wild waters it seems to hold true. Thanks again for the pic's, eagerly awaiting for more!!! Bill"
6487628,prov1800,2020-09-28 12:12:00,5010,"We fished lots of that stuff.Always fish right by it and shallow.My wife says its called ""phragmites"".it was everywhere where some rocks where."

6487484,prov1800,2020-09-28 07:40:00,5010,"Well got picked up late afternoon on Saturday.We had a amazing 8 days.Moose were nocturnel all week.We had one chance on Thursday morning with a 200 yd encounter but the heavy fog kept us from seeing the bull and before fog cleared he had gone back into tge woods.We checked many areas and they all had great moose sign.Weather was nice for us,maybe to nice but hunting is what it is.The fall colors were just amazing,the peace and quite has to be experienced.Water temperature was at 50 F and rose the 55 F by mid week.Water level was down a good 3 ft from the looks of the waterlines on the shoreline.Friday was a find safe route to the west,east and south part of the lake. Lots of rocks sticking up so put them on my gps for putting on a map later so fisherman can avoid them.Fishing was great and they were very shallow from 2 ft to 8 ft.Back bays really seemed to hold them.While hunting in the mornings and evenings they were realy feeding on the surface and jumping steady.Would fish a bit in those spots after hunting and had a great bite.Fishing off the dock at the cabin was crazy.Cabin was very cozy and pretty large.Has a new Honda generator which purs pretty quite.Solar power for the lights when generator was off.Wood stove kept us pretty warm.We basically stayed down by the south end and didnt make the trip to the north side.Had a few visits every couple of days.someone always landed to bring some gas and some minnows and bring some stuff in that we were running out of.My Garmin inreach explorer worked great to communicate and the map function was awesome for my walk across a peninsula north of the camp.We were treated to a 16 ft lund ssv with a electric start 15 hp 4 stroke.Not complaing about that.lol."
6487492,Eckohlt,2020-09-28 07:59:00,3685,"Dam wish I was there with ya john,sounds like a great fall getaway,any size to the walleyes?i bet those minnows came in handy that time of year lol"
6487494,prov1800,2020-09-28 07:59:00,5010,Few pics
6487502,Golden Eagle,2020-09-28 08:11:00,2642,"Over the past 30 years I've made 15 October trips to NW Ontario flyin lakes, most of them solo. Thanksgiving dinner with the outfitter's family and moose hunters is a treat for me. It's a favorite time of the year for me and makes my life better. I fish where the moose hunters ain't and I wear plenty of orange."
6487504,prov1800,2020-09-28 08:13:00,5010,"They did work well.Caught 6"" walleyes to lots of 20"".Didnt really fish all that much.One day on our way back we stopped on 6 or 7 points and back bays and probably and got 10 or so on each spot.Last Fri i fished from dock and got 30 or so in a half hour and then did tge same in the evening.Lots of pike up to 30"" but didnt really try for them to often but they loved eating the baby medussa."
6487506,Knutson21,2020-09-28 08:19:00,348,"Thanks for the report John, looks like a great place and you had a great time."
6487510,prov1800,2020-09-28 08:30:00,5010,The clump of trees is where the cabin is.It was saved from the fires 8 years ago.The beach is amazing.We walked it everyday and twice had fresh moose tracks on it.
6487522,prov1800,2020-09-28 09:25:00,5010,Your absolutly right.Great time of the year.Fishing super easy like spring time.ÄŽidnt have to worry about moose hunters last week had the whole lake to ourselves
6487544,Golden Eagle,2020-09-28 09:54:00,2642,"I miss the morning hunt by staying in the cabin, sleeping in, building a fire and staying warm. During the evening hunt, I'm fishing humps in big open water. I also check with hunters and their guide so I won't be where they want to hunt. It's good that no bow hunters were on your lake last week."
6487566,prov1800,2020-09-28 10:18:00,5010,We were in 16A last week so its open for both primitive or modern weapons south a bit from Cat lake.Fish tend to go shallow there.Didnt try any deep spots and lake is fairly shallow at around 20 ft mostly.The shallow areas were loaded with walleye and pike so didnt need to go searching for them.We had to open the windows a few times as the wood stove got pretty hot at times.Most of our coffees were in the dark of the mornings waiting for the sun to come up.Cant beat that.
