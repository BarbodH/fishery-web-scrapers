A small motor, 25ah lithium battery, and a charger will weigh in at about 35 pounds. Considering many outposts have generators now, is anyone considering taking a trolling motor? I know I am!! We've all gotten along just fine without them .... but just think how nice it would be to have on-demand and quiet boat control at your fingertips!"
6489480,gmattbruin,2020-10-06 09:32:00,174,"In all honesty, as the yrs have moved on and most outfitters(ours anyways), have moved their motor stock over to 4stroke 9.9, 15hp or maybe even 20hp, these motors run incredible, quiet and easily troll worthy. I can add from our yrs, its not always about weight for the flight, its about bulk too. Im guessing if you pulled out a troll motor to load the pilot might give the stink eye...LOL. But im sure theyve seen just about everything. Cheers"
6489482,Net_Man,2020-10-06 09:43:00,580,I find some enjoyment of fishing in the typical boat that you encounter on fly-in trips and not having the common luxuries that I find in my own boat. I still would not desire to be with out a depth finder though.... In general the electric would give you a edge on fishing but you are already on a fly-in trip..... On fly-in trips I probably have the motor running more than the average person. This would be almost 100% of the time that I am actually fishing. For me having a electric would be more about it being quiet when operating in comparison to the gas engine. For me the additional solitude would be worth a further review.

In my case I fished the same outfitter every year so I asked if I could just leave it up there. They said no problem so I just flew in the next year with the battery again and a spare prop figuring if someone else dinged it up so no problem.Other than the extra weight it was awesome. I have since switched outfitter after 10+ years so someone else is hopefully using it.B-"
6490190,Barley,2020-10-08 17:16:00,10,"I agree with Net_Man that the electric motor is not needed but might be a nice luxury. After decades of spending at least a week per year in a small aluminum boat with a small outboard, I have become very comfortable controlling the boat. Now that the outboards are 4-stroke, it's even better. I'm sure the technique is well-known to those on this forum. Just keep the motor running while casting along a shoreline, alternating between reverse and neutral, and back your way along the shore. Unless it's very windy, it's easy to control the boat using only your thighs or hips, just nudging the tiller in the required direction while standing."
