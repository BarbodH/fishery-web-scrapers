6485834,tandm,2020-09-21 21:22:00,679,I don't think the length of boat had much bearing on it. I give most of the credit to a better trailer design. Sorry if I miscommunicated.
6485878,Shellback,2020-09-22 05:40:00,8083,"I dislike steep ramps where my bow is against the stop, but my stern is floating. With no wind or current I can usually just pull the truck ahead and the stern centers. With wind or current, I often have to winch it up the last 2 or 3 feet. At 72 y/o, that's no fun. Been thinking about an electric winch."
6485894,eyecatcher1,2020-09-22 06:27:00,323,I am 69 and have a 20' Ranger boat. I have the drotto latch and an Ulterra bowmount trolling motor. Those two things make loading and unloading a breeze.
6485900,bigcreekdad,2020-09-22 07:20:00,74,"Been looking at vids of the Drotto. Looks great! However, I've seem some mention of them working best on roller trailers. Are there any bunk trailer users out there that can comment?"
6485904,MikeF,2020-09-22 07:31:00,895,Roller trailers are a little easier than bunks friction wise but rollers give you less play on cross winds and it can miss the latch if the boat keel is not straight on. 17.5 Sylvan... 4 bunk trailer...works great. A little silicone on the front bunks and she slides right into the latch. I prefer bunks vs rollers but the launches I use are all concrete ramps so no shallow launch problems. Good Luck
6486058,tandm,2020-09-22 17:47:00,679,"I have one on a bunk trailer. It is especially useful on steeper ramps, holding the boat in place without having to lean over the bow and hook the winch strap. If I have a partner driving the tow vehicle, he does not have to leave the vehicle, until the rig is out of the ramp traffic area."
6486164,eyecatcher1,2020-09-23 07:13:00,323,Mine is on a bunk trailer too and like MikeF said just spray some silicone on the bunks every now and then and loading isn't a problem.
6485564,bigcreekdad,2020-09-21 08:01:00,74,"I'm into my 21st season with my Alumacraft Magnum 165 tiller, with a 60 hp Yamaha 4 stroke. I do most of my fishing alone on lakes in northern Michigan, and annually a few times (other than this year), to the French River in Ontario. Up til the last couple years, this boat has been perfect for how I fish, and I could load and unload it without a great deal of difficulty. I'm now in my 73rd year and loading the boat on the trailer is very tiring. I've started not fishing when on the fence if I think about the loading/unloading process. It more than saddens to think the time may be shortly coming when I won't be able to fish solo. Whoever labelled these the ""Golden Years"" should be burnt at the stake. In any case, has anyone moved to a smaller/lighter boat and found the launching/loading process much easier? If so, what did you move from and to? Thanks"
6485578,Husker525,2020-09-21 08:13:00,720,"I have not yet reached my golden years, but have a close friend that is right there, and deals with the after effects of a stroke.I had a 16' side console boat, and went to a 17.5' WT boat which is a lot larger. I originally wanted a smaller boat, thinking it would be easier to load and unload. I was wrong. I find my bigger boat is actually easier as I can drive it on, rather than winch it on.Some things you might consider to make loading and unloading easier. Try an electric winch on your trailer. Use poly bunk sliders (non roller trailer) and retractable transom straps. As far as unloading by yourself, you might look at some YouTube videos on that subject. I have great success with tying a rope to my truck, letting the boat float off, untie from the truck and tie to the dock while I park. My buddy went from a pull start on his boat to an electric start motor and is able to load his 16' side console by himself with some of the things that I have suggested. He has lost about 30% of the left side body functions. He does tire easily though, he just pre plans, and doesn't fish as long.With the new technology, working smarter, and not harder is fairly inexpensive and easily accomplished."
6485582,Hot Runr Guy,2020-09-21 08:14:00,16061,Is it possible that a better trailer than what you have now might be the ticket?https://trailmastertrailers.com/cust...ilmaster-tube/ HRG
6485588,andersaki,2020-09-21 08:15:00,1426,"Five years ago I actually went in the opposite direction. I traded my 16' tiller for an 18' windshield boat with a roller trailer. Once I added a Drotto and trailer steps, solo launching and loading couldn't be easier. Sometimes little things can make a big difference. BTW, I'm a few months shy of 70, keep fishing as long as you are able. Mark"
6485610,bigcreekdad,2020-09-21 08:53:00,74,what's a drotto?

6485798,kzoofisher,2020-09-21 18:54:00,5144,"I have a roller trailer with a platform on the front to stand on when I winch it up. Also a rope for launching. I hook up the rope and back the trailer down just a little deeper than the load depth. Pulls off easy with the rope from the dock or I can give it just a tiny push from the front. For loading I drive it on and only have to turn the winch a couple cranks. I did have to adjust the roller guides because they were too wide and the boat tended to load crooked. None of this was a problem until the kids got jobs and I started launching by myself.Get a locking carabiner or hook with safety clip for the rope. Taking them off is a little more of a pain, having the cheap carabiner unclip itself and the boat float away is a lot more of a pain."
6485806,tandm,2020-09-21 19:17:00,679,"My previous boat was a 16.5' alumacraft navigator with a reliance trailer. I felt the same way you are feeling now. That trailer was almost impossible to load correctly. Sold boat/ trailer and bought a 17.5 boat on an eagle trailer. The difference in loading was unbelievable. I routinely load single-handed with no issues. I,too, added a Drotto hitch to self-latch the boat when loading. See if you can find a dealer who will let you try a different brand of trailer ."
6485810,bigcreekdad,2020-09-21 19:23:00,74,Tandm What do you think is the reason the larger boat is easier?
6485812,bigcreekdad,2020-09-21 19:26:00,74,"Also, I might add that where I fish in Michigan power loading is pretty much a legal no no. Otherwise, I'd drive that ***** all the way to the roller."
