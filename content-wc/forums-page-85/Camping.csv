6485716,lenray,2020-09-21 13:27:00,467,"Yesterday I posted a pic of me on FB----I have a 24 ft. ladder in the bucket of my John Deere 410 backhoe and am standing on that combination up in a big old maple tree---tying it off to cut down----I am tough, but many say Stupid.....A cousin said my Guardian angel is very perplexed......................."
6485724,v-bay gord,2020-09-21 13:36:00,3168,Your wife sounded like an amazing woman.....you are a lucky man. Sorry for your loss.
6485734,RichA$1970,2020-09-21 13:56:00,1159,Lenray Thanks for sharing and RIP to your wife as it sounds like you could write a book about your adventures together.
6485754,Net_Man,2020-09-21 15:44:00,580,Hopefully the hydraulic fluid was in god shape. Nothing like your bucket dropping while you are on the ladder. That is a quick way to fill your shorts. If you just need to remove some branches you could possibly just keep your feet on the ground and use the shotgun.
6485776,lenray,2020-09-21 17:12:00,467,Yes I was a lucky man.....8 days puts me at 23 months without her.. I completed Until Death do us PART. But for me--I am still Her Guy. I am not dating and will not be. I would feel like I WAS CHEATING ON HER.........Just some useless info.---I have a Caddy Escalade and BMW Z 4 Convert.--land and coin in the bank and many investments that we built together. I only say this--that maybe I could find another Lady---but my Heart will not let me....Missing Her everyday..................

6485788,RichA$1970,2020-09-21 18:02:00,1159,"Eck, Could of used you this weekend on the farm as we had one fall over the Shawnee Crickbed. Luckily the quads can clear it & I can run the tractors on the road to the other easements."
6485796,Eckohlt,2020-09-21 18:39:00,3685,Piece of cake there rich would of gladly helped
6485164,lenray,2020-09-19 11:23:00,467,"The main reason I PREFER to remote camp is to be alone...I am not interested one bit in eating with others and talking fish stories etc. I fish remote water that I CAN DRIVE TO, BUT BOAT A GOOD DISTANCE AND SOMETIMES PORTAGE....If and when I see another person on that water--that is the last time I will go there. Always on the hunt for more remote water where others fear to go...This is just me--not trying to tell others what to do......"
6485178,Eckohlt,2020-09-19 12:17:00,3685,"Lenray if I ever see you deep in the bush I promise not to invite you over for dinner,can we still talk about some other kind of stories rather than fishing stories?"
6485210,northernbite,2020-09-19 16:48:00,1186,How you doing other wise my friend. Been a hard year. I'm hoping we meet on road again next year.Paul
6485220,RichA$1970,2020-09-19 18:15:00,1159,Spot on!!!!
6485350,BrianinVA,2020-09-20 10:06:00,160,"Lenray, I'm curious, do you paddle when you remote camp? I've always been intrigued with the idea of remote camping on crown land for the reasons you mention above. It's fun to play around with the various map tools Ontario makes available but one thing I've noticed is that most boat launches, and adjacent lakes, are in green areas where non-resident camping is not allowed (which is completely understandable). Paddling certainly seems to open up more put in locations and lake options to truly get away from it all. If I ever seen you in the bush I promise to avoid eye contact as I give you a friendly wave Brian"
6485600,lenray,2020-09-21 08:31:00,467,We could talk about the Detoilet Lions................
6485602,lenray,2020-09-21 08:35:00,467,"Hi Paul and PAUL--VERY DIFFICULT YEAR being a Widower---This is much harder than missing a few eyes, but being in the remote area brings joy to my soul----Good to hear from my friends in the Keystone...."

6485666,lenray,2020-09-21 11:13:00,467,"You have our former MSU QBack---He isn't no FRAN Tarkenton or Teddy B. jUST MISSED 51 YEARS OF MARRIAGE TO MY VERY BEST FRIEND--We were neighbor kids---Knew her for 65 years. She would go to remote areas with me--camping---even though her health was very compromised---sometimes 4-5 hundred miles from a hospital. She had Addisions disease as well as Cancer---She was a fighter and We never said why us. Her name was Delite and SHE WAS THAT. C broke her leg, took out half a lung and she also had to have a trach. Never smoked... We were ONE and when one part leaves the grief never ends...Thank you for your kind words and you other guys who are commenting on my camping......It brings a smile to me............"
6485668,lenray,2020-09-21 11:20:00,467,Will welcome a wave----Now I am using a 14 ft. Lund and a big sq. back canoe. I use a 3 HP 2 Cylinder Johnson on the canoe. It is legal to camp where I am fishing. I can get the PERMITS or can get an Indian permit to camp on their land. I get the Indian permits at the local office in the village of Pickle Lake.. Sometimes I have used an inflatable boat with a 1.2 HP Tanaka..
6484446,lenray,2020-09-17 07:48:00,467,If an when Ontario opens---I can be there in two days. Not using a camp--drive up-boat in- portage out and get in da tent..............
6484464,walleyecheek,2020-09-17 08:09:00,2231,better take your long johns and an ice auger ......lol.
6484604,Bill Krejca,2020-09-17 12:12:00,6107,"Good luck, don't forget to get your camping permits, and note reduced limits for camping, etc. Bill"
6484810,RichA$1970,2020-09-17 19:53:00,1159,Spot on and thatâ€™s the future as you control your destiny n rules once you get in.
6484910,Guest,2020-09-18 06:50:00,0,"Don't be surprised if that's the last thing that opens. (campers) First, they're going to try to get more leniency for family and property owners. Then they will focus on the economic recovery. Last will be a full border opening. No chance they just say ""come on up"" and you can run up. Also... the border extension to October 21 is coming soon. Once they start opening the border, I would bet that it takes 3 months to be fully opened."
6484934,lenray,2020-09-18 07:52:00,467,Yes--also being 75 I have found the 250 mile drive to the UP of Mi. a lot easier than the one way trip to NW Ontario of 1250 miles. Found a lake in the UP that is filled with Gills.....I do it the old way my parents did as far as frying...Scale-leave skin on and bones intact- dip in Drakes and fry in the big cast iron pan with peanut oil................heading back up next week....Probably will make 10 trips up there next year if the Good Lord spares me another year......
6484976,Baseline,2020-09-18 10:59:00,3207,"Check the camping map especially if you are camping in western Ontarior commonly known as Sunset Country. Most of the public or Crown Land in this area is restricted and allows only Canadian citizens to camp. There are a few areas around Lac Suel, Ignace, and LOW that allow camping for non residents. There is a map on the Ontario MNR website. As was already mentioned make sure to buy the camping permits and only transport the reduced legal limits. I've been though the game check sites when returning from camping and the MNR requires either the permits or a receipt from a resort."
6485024,lenray,2020-09-18 15:07:00,467,I always get the camping permits--close to 12.00 per night and never bring fish home..THEY want the fisherman to be located in certain areas---camps....They don't want guys like me to be out there in the bush--possibly starting a fire etc....I understand that....
6485130,davis,2020-09-19 07:53:00,18,"For many years camping was free unless in a manned camp. One year my Dad took sons and son-in-law to Hamilton Lake to camp which was a beautiful lake about half way between Savant and Pickle Lake. They just got set up and in comes a Conservation officer who asks to see their camping tickets. What camping tickets was she talking about? Standing outside being eaten alive by black flies, they explained how many years it was not so and they did not know of the new camping tickets. She (officer) explained firmly that each night that they did not have the camping tickets would be a hefty fine. Putting dinner out of their mind they drove back to Savant, bleeding from the flies and bruised at what seemed loss of freedom. They got over it after getting on the lake the next day."
6485132,Bill Krejca,2020-09-19 07:56:00,6107,"Interesting perspective - starting fires, etc. I have always looked at the camping permits, restrictions on limits as just a way to increase business for the resorts, less people doing their own thing, the more business for camps. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just results in more expense for the individual. I remember back in the 60's, 70's and onward, parts of LOW, Whitefish Bay, especially, got covered with campers, some of whom made some bad messes of the wilderness due to garbage left, etc., so it is understandable. At the time, camping was free. So the camps really got the short stick, perhaps just making some change from parking, ice, etc. Same philosophy with minnow drop nets, finally outlawed, at least for nonresidents, to bolster/consolidate the minnow business. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, folks up there have a short window in which to earn a living. Cause and effect are always interesting. Bill"
