6490018,prov1800,2020-10-08 06:47:00,5010,Great report.lovè it
6490254,dschiebel,2020-10-09 00:02:00,85,They taste pretty good if you boil them for 4 hours in salt water. Then let them sit and a bucket of Windsor for 3.5 days. Strain everything in a strainer and then drink the Windsor
6490272,pjshorthorn,2020-10-09 05:07:00,5654,"Ahhhhhhhhhh...........another group of kindred spirits who  might be  about a full bubble off center most of the time. Ya got to love the effort!!!!!! It has to be hard to get them all to line up properly. I mean, it has to be like, well, like herding flamingos....... PjShorthorn"
6488074,pjshorthorn,2020-09-29 17:47:00,5654,That makes me sad. PjShorthorn
6488076,prov1800,2020-09-29 17:49:00,5010,Maybe next year with better conditions.
6488086,That Minnesota guy,2020-09-29 18:00:00,8293,Getting them to wear masks might be a issue.
6488096,prov1800,2020-09-29 18:37:00,5010,Mandatory ònly indoors.So might work out for them.
6488160,JAY221,2020-09-30 04:37:00,877,"UPDATE I have not seen the video but according to neighborhood security cameras this flock did indeed head north!! Later, Jay"
6488166,tv4fish,2020-09-30 05:08:00,2694,Where are THEY going to quarantine for 14 days .........
6488180,fishin779,2020-09-30 07:41:00,63,"I have a cabin on LOW, they can stay there if need be !! ****, my wife and I didn't get to this year"
6488618,rknott,2020-10-01 19:51:00,89,I hear the meat is a little crunchy.
6488674,walleyecheek,2020-10-02 06:40:00,2231,Depends on what kind of coating you use ?
6488748,fishron,2020-10-02 10:39:00,317,Tastes just like chicken.
6487322,JAY221,2020-09-27 15:58:00,877,"I don't know if these are headed north or south but they showed up in a neighbors yard. Later, Jay"
6487326,That Minnesota guy,2020-09-27 16:06:00,8293,Pat..........you sneak a trip to Iowa?
6487334,kswalleyer,2020-09-27 16:17:00,1651,"mixing it up in your Snows goose spread? I like it, it'll pull em from miles out"
6487418,pjshorthorn,2020-09-27 21:14:00,5654,Nope...I heard that Iowa had border restrictions to make sure Georgia folk don't come to visit. I think that VBay Gord is the most likely culprit. He apparently has had an infestation of the varmits over the years and may have imported them since Canadian residents can fly into the US. Maybe the football program will change their mascot from the Hawkeyes to the Flamingos At least they would be recognized for their uniforms..... PjShorthorn
6487422,johnboat,2020-09-27 21:25:00,2014,"Come on now, be nice. Iowa finished #15 Nationally last year.And we haven't lost yet this year."
6487438,WallyWarrior,2020-09-28 03:36:00,2488,"Golden Domer fans are right there with Nebraska fans, stuck in the past. They have been no more relevant than Iowa in quite some time. However, unlike Nebraska, the talking heads must like the looks of ND uniforms because they start out way overrated each year. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6487446,pjshorthorn,2020-09-28 04:22:00,5654,Ouchie bro....that was a little harsh.....LOL. I didn't go to ND.....I just had to pay for the educations.....LOL. PjShorthorn
6487450,tv4fish,2020-09-28 04:50:00,2694,"I think that this is ""another thing"" that we can blame on COVID..........."
6487468,pjshorthorn,2020-09-28 06:07:00,5654,"I have to respectfully disagree. It is strictly related to the fact that my marketing plan is starting to take root. Although I may have wanted a different brand to start with, the Flamingo has to start somewhere. It looks like Iowa is that place..... In a store near you...... PjShorthorn"
6488062,prov1800,2020-09-29 16:59:00,5010,Did not see any pinks up north this year pj.
