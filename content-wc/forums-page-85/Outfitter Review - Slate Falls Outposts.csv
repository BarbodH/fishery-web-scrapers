I love reading trip reports and when available user reviews of resorts, lodges and products. Trips aren't cheap and in some cases neither is gear and reading user generated opinions really helped our group take the plunge. With that in mind I wrote my first outfitter review (hopefully many more to come, health, wealth and wife allowing) I also tried my hand at a cabin walkthru of the Root Bay Outpost (forgive my camera work - first effort!) - its embedded in the posthttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/o...falls-outposts Cheers Andrew"

6490524,gordy28,2020-10-10 08:00:00,437,Thanks guys! StJoe guy sorry for getting the word out lol. Definitely connect when you are heading to root bay and we can chat tactics etc. Although Ryan is really thorough and a better fisherman than I! Cheers Andrew

These lakes fish totally differently and produce different numbers and sizes and require different fishing strategies. anyway - i look for lake reports much more than outfitter reports - and i hope the reports i've posted here for the last 20 years+ reflect this.. phish"
