6489122,walleyecheek,2020-10-04 13:14:00,2231,would they be rutting now ?
6489134,Eckohlt,2020-10-04 13:54:00,3685,"Wish I could go in with john,I'll run the boat and you start blasting away after the motors off,can you shoot out of boat?"
6489144,prov1800,2020-10-04 14:33:00,5010,We are not allowed to shoot from a boat.Canoe would be ok.Not sure abo√πt other provinces.Have seen hunting shows in tge yukon and NWT and most moose shot in those shows has been from a boat.In my book shooting from a boat is not really hunting.Just hope they are still rutting. If not have to find areas where they are browsing.
6489156,Eckohlt,2020-10-04 15:27:00,3685,I think bullwinkle will be browsing where all the lady's have coffee in the early morn

6488942,prov1800,2020-10-03 14:09:00,5010,Its fall and its cooling of.beautifull sceney now.Water temps yesterday at 55 f and a morning temp of 0c.Not much wind so it was a good day to head out.Did cast for muskies and didnt even see one so changed up to a spinning rod.Didnt go far from Clarks and didnt have to.Fished 4 reefs and had a fantastic bite on all of them plus had some great action on smallmouths to.All eating size but fun to catch.Jig and a minnow and caught some on a lindy rig to.Very fast action.i recast some muskie spots after and still didnt see one.Time to load up and head home.
6488946,7 Mag,2020-10-03 14:22:00,1887,"Thanks for the pictures, It looks cold I suppose ice will be forming before long."

6489034,Eckohlt,2020-10-04 07:25:00,3685,"My kind of fishing weather the colder the better,lake all to yourself"
6489046,prov1800,2020-10-04 08:15:00,5010,Fall is a great time for sure Rod.The cooler weather is allright and there is no other choice.But looking at 7 months or so of wearing more clothing.That gets old.But there's ice fishing.
6489056,Eckohlt,2020-10-04 08:32:00,3685,"Well as far as I'm concerned your in great part of Ontario to put up with those 7 months of torture,but I hear ya it would get alittle old for that long of time.Just spend your 7 months of prison time in Clarks ice shack,from what I saw your minnow supply is endless lol,rod"
6489116,prov1800,2020-10-04 12:17:00,5010,Looking forward to the shack for sure and getting back to Anishinabi.Still have a number of weeks of fishing left here.Probably headed back up to Gull Lake for moose this week.One of the planes going north can drop me off.
