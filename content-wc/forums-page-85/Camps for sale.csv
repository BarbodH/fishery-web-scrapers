6486798,tv4fish,2020-09-25 05:04:00,2694,"Ironically - That is very similar to what has happened in northern Minnesota (and - I expect in other ""tourist"" type states). There used to be many more ""resorts"" here where you could go and rent a cabin for a week or ??. Through the years these resorts have been sold off, a lot of times it would start out by maybe selling one of the cabins, then sell another one, etc. Pretty soon - it was ALL sold off."
6486846,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-09-25 08:13:00,240,"Exactly. My first fly in was in 2001, and we had a group of 6 guys that went every year. I was the youngest. 15-20 years later, the older guys are in their late 70's, and they all gave it up. Trying to find another 5 guys to replace them was impossible. So, I lost my slot on the best lake I have ever fished. Now, I still go, but only with outfitters that will take groups of 2, 3, 4 guys."
6486874,Eckohlt,2020-09-25 10:28:00,3685,"Is larus lake the go to lake? 2022 get some guys here on WC to go I'll be first in line,rod"
6487080,That Minnesota guy,2020-09-26 06:15:00,8293,"My, some serious overnight editing last night. So did you bounce him out again or just clean up his mess?"
6487082,Eckohlt,2020-09-26 06:19:00,3685,"I think mixed bag message got nuked,wasn't nice what he typed"
6487086,That Minnesota guy,2020-09-26 06:31:00,8293,"There was nothing mixed about what he typed. It's the same old rant he has been on for years. He got bounce within the last year for it and last night he re-appeared. The message hadn't changed nor the presentation. I won't say he doesn't have the right to his opinion, he does. However I question his thought process that he would be allowed to express it here at Walleye Central. Oh well, I suspect he got bounced but he will return just like the Americans will return to Canada when the border opens. Time to move along, back to the original topic about Camps being for sale."
6487096,Eckohlt,2020-09-26 07:06:00,3685,Yea some people would rather start a small war on WC when they should Be talking fishing or fishing related
6487260,kswalleyer,2020-09-27 08:34:00,1651,"I've read (from state DNR Reports) that hunting and fishing license sales have been dropping since the mid 80s and down 20% from peak with unfavorable forward looking demographics. I'm not in that business so have no first hand experience but anecdotally, I don't see the bird hunters and deer hunters like I used to by any measure in KS/IA. they just aren't around. I know with my kids we just didn't have time for a week up north. they both were both good athletes and way too busy year round. We did 100s of day trips fishing and hunting around here, but nothing extended. spring break was never for us, we were off at some tournament in some city...The camp owners I have talked to in the last 5 years tell me they have seen a big drop-off with kids/families in summer over the past 15 years because of all the activities that are now year round, video games, school schedules. A resort up on LOTW told me they do 90% of their business in Winter anymore! Its a good resort many here may know.That being said, I think ice fishing has made a gargantuan( positive for tourism) change in the last 10-15 years. I think if you want the lifestyle, its still as good as any way to make a living if you are passionate and willing to work very hard.... I think its fair to say its more expensive to do now..not many throwing a 14ft boat on top of a car and a 10hp motor going anymore.For me, I would never turn my hobby into work. Work is not always fun. Those resort owners work very very hard when everyone else is out fishing. thought I wanted to be a game warden until my dad said ""when the ducks are flying , you are working"". great career choice but I want to hunt when the ducks are flying...trade offs...."
6486038,walleyecheek,2020-09-22 14:43:00,2231,You can fish every day if you want ?
6486444,Skywagon,2020-09-23 18:25:00,1106,"Skip the thought of that headache, instead just buy a cabin and enjoy it. Fishing tourism is on a downward spiral, the clients are getting older...not a tremendous amount of replacements on the horizon."
6486450,RichA$1970,2020-09-23 18:41:00,1159,"Although I wish your comments were off, the writing is on the wall and I agree with you. I just think the way kids interact everything is digital and they could care less about spending 15 hours driving in the bush for a week without having a headset on playing militia fairy tale games. There’s 3 in my crew 76 and over and the drive n trips get harder on them every year. I feel for them and will miss them when they throw in the towel as there’s not much of a pipeline of replacements interested in going."
6486454,Eckohlt,2020-09-23 18:59:00,3685,"I'm 66 and I'll be interested until I'm in the hole,so keep me in mind if your going to a dynamite lake,but we better use fishing poles"
6486462,Slim03,2020-09-23 19:47:00,159,"I think it is all about how you get them involved. Our group is getting older but now we have sons involved. All of them are ready to go fishing at any time to Canada. I started my son at 9 and this was his first year without and you talk about upset and ready to go twice next year and yes he spends plenty of screen time at home. We are even throwing in a curve ball next year and taking my sister and my nieces on one of my Canadian trips. Even though we think kids just enjoy the screen time there are some that enjoy disconnecting just as much as I do by going somewhere technology doesn’t work. Those that say the younger generation doesn’t want to go I disagree sometimes it’s just about taking them along and getting them involved, my son does the fire at shore lunch so he feels like a big deal. Yes it changes the trip but everyone that has had their kids come along had always said it was their best trip ever in my group."
6486606,Obabikon,2020-09-24 10:18:00,2370,"The industry has changed a lot over the past 50 years. I don't think that overall fishing based tourism is on a downward trend. At least not the way many think it is. First... 50 years ago, there were tons of tiny ""resorts"". 3 cabin places where the owners rented out two building just to make a little money. Those have almost all gone private at this point. So, that raises demand on the functioning resorts. Then, there are the resorts that have been privatized by larger corporations. They purchase a full resort, and turn it into their ""club"" for their clients and employees only. Plus many have been purchased by families, and now do not operate. All that said... fishing as an industry isn't going anywhere, anytime soon. Even if a smaller percentage of people enjoy fishing, our population is increasing. There are more dollars spent in the fishing tourism business right now that there were 20 years ago. 20 years ago though... no one in their right mind would have even thought about purchasing a $75,000 ranger. Just my opinion, and understanding my market. We have older guests, and younger guests. As time goes by, people pass away... other people reach ""retirement"" ages. They seem to take up the sport more frequently. People are living ""retired"" lives longer than they used to, and it seems that has put some high demand on resorts. I would say you'd have a hard time finding a resort that was struggling to find guests, until this year. That doesn't mean the business is incredibly profitable. It really is only so-so. However, those who love it would never change what they do for a living. I personally make a comfortable living (less than $100,000 per year for household income) with no savings account. However, you could triple my salary, and give me unbelievable benefits... and I don't think I'd switch jobs to a 8-5 M-F. I love what I do, and where I get to be. Happiness is better than $$$. Anyhow, there are going to be a bunch of resorts for sale in the spring time. I doubt anyone is going to sell right now for several reasons.... we have no clue if a bailout is coming. There are rumblings that we may finally be getting some help. Also, it will be very hard to sell if 75% of your potential buyers aren't able to cross the border to look at it. There aren't going to be any super steals (most likely) until the dust settles."
6486622,v-bay gord,2020-09-24 11:02:00,3168,"I agree with Obabikon on his view of where our business is at. I don't think we need to worry about declining anglers. Solitude, clean water, rocks / trees may become more important in the overall ""experience"" moving forward....having the option to have quality fishing is a bonus. There are fewer and fewer places you can travel to to get this. In terms of buying a camp, if all that you want is to make a good deal but don't have the passion to follow through with actually running this type of business then my advice is forget about it. If you think owning a camp will give you all the time you want to hunt and fish...you shoulc just rent a cabin for the season...you will be much happier. If you want the lifestyle then by all means there could be some opportunities coming...."

6485958,Jig Man,2020-09-22 09:45:00,95,This website has been around for years and I l always enjoy scanning the list. Some of the listings have been up there for years and others I have used.http://www.resortforsaleontario.com/ and there is also this one which I hope never gets sold.https://flyincampsforsale.com/fly-in-lodge/
6485978,mixedbag,2020-09-22 10:37:00,76,"Buying a camp unseen without an engineers report and a detailed on site inspection is bit foolish. Moreover, you wanna sit down with owner and review Financial Statements. Will season even open next year??...can you withstand another year of no cash-flow. This aint like buying a can of beans off the shelf."
6485980,BrianinVA,2020-09-22 10:56:00,160,Is that listing for Clark's KC's Landing new or has it been for sale some time?
6485984,walleyecheek,2020-09-22 11:10:00,2231,Well some people have money (wish i did) and dont care about sitting down with the owner if they can get it for pennies on the dollar !!!

6486006,Guest,2020-09-22 13:14:00,0,"Wow, these camps are not much more than my annual AMEX bill with the Canadian dollar worth not much. When everybody is selling, I say buy buy buy"
6486012,Guest,2020-09-22 13:25:00,0,I can think of nothing better to do than to spend a week a year fishing in Ontario. If I have to be at any of those camps full time I would be on suicide watch. You can only watch so much hockey and drink so much beer
6486024,RichA$1970,2020-09-22 13:49:00,1159,"Sounds like a dream but then think of your customers you have to deal with. I love this site but after reading the boo hooing of so many little nit picking complaints, no thanks. My dad and I outfitted for 10 years deer hunting on the farm in SoIL when he retired and it was more for fun and used the $$$ for improvements to the farm, but dealing with Big City Hunters from Chicago n the suburbs finally we had enough. I can’t keep count on how many times he said “Unbelievable” and the blitzkreig of F-Bombs launched."

6485366,That Minnesota guy,2020-09-20 10:58:00,8293,Willing to buy it sight unseen?
6485368,Walleye2242,2020-09-20 10:59:00,263,Maybe....depends on location. Pictures would be nice. Have to atleast know what I am getting into.
6485370,That Minnesota guy,2020-09-20 11:17:00,8293,"My point was unless you are Canadian you can't get into inspect anything anyway. At this point shopping camps would be a waste of time IMO. Besides, if you believe what you read on the internet the whole Canadian economy will collapse if they don't allow a few Americans across the border to save the day."
6485376,walleyecheek,2020-09-20 11:44:00,2231,I think what he meant to say was......sure if the price is right why not sight unseen ?
6485388,Bill Krejca,2020-09-20 13:33:00,6107,There are always some camps for sale. Bill
