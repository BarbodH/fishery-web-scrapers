In all honesty, and no one wants to hear this, we all really need to start giving serious consideration to the idea that this may impact the 2021 season and there will be dire consequences for the industry. Most health experts are expecting things to normalize in late 2021/early 2022 and, if disparities between the Canada and the US remain, there would be little motivation for our neighbors up north to open things up."
6483916,Net_Man,2020-09-15 12:41:00,580,If 2021 is a wash then I surely can provide Eckohit and Walleyecheeck some free minnows to get them through life. And I can also hold the flashlight for them when they pick up their crawlers.

That was 12 1/2 hours with stops to get there. Like Clarks they only opened up a few lakes. Fishing was fantastic there as well. I've looked at Gourlay before, but it was always booked and they wouldn't do small groups of three."
6488084,prov1800,2020-09-29 17:55:00,5010,My wife and i spent 8 days just south of Kapikik on Gull Lake last week.Fishing was also real good.Got a ride home with Zack in the Caravan.Sweet ride.

6482344,fooch1199,2020-09-10 20:47:00,10,"My friends and I are from Southwest Ontario and we started out this year looking for places that we could drive to for a fly-in fishing trip. Over the years, we have fished with Hearst Air, White River Air and Air Dale, which for us is about a 10 -11 hour car ride. All three are awesome. We decided to try something even farther, in the Nakina area, which is for us is 14 hours. When Covid happened, a lot of places opened up that we could only dream of, including their most deluxe camps. So I sent an email to places in Vermillion Bay, a 22 hour drive. To put it into perspective, I could drive to my parents place in Florida in 22 hours. We decided to book with Clarks at Kapikik lake, in their most deluxe camp. We flew from Toronto to Thunder bay, rented a van and drove to Dryden during the Red Lake fire. The next morning, we arrived at Clark's airbase. Carla and the crew where amazing. We were the first live cargo on their new plane, that they recently bought in December with the expectation they were going to have the best year possible. As a small business owner that is nuts. Zack (the pilot) and the new plane were incredible. We arrived in paradise. Every other day, they would drop off ice, water and minnows for us. At one point during the stay, I caught seven pickerels in a row on seven casts. This was a once in a lifetime trip for us. Kapikik Lake is not a lake we would ever be able to book again, as its always booked for years in advance. To all those who have never been with Clarks, this was a once in a lifetime experience. During the Red Lake fires, they offered up their fleet of planes to help combat the fire. They also are now flying necessities to the First Nations. Thanks to the Clarks Crew for an incredible adventure."

6482410,Eagle1,2020-09-11 06:40:00,28,"I've been going to Kapikik Lake for lots of years, and it's an absolutely fantastic fishing experience. Cabin is awesome for an outpost lake and the service that the Clark's give is 1st class. Glad you enjoyed a piece of my ""happy place"" on this earth!"
6482538,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-09-11 12:20:00,358,"Wonderful review! You might want to post it on tripadvisor.com. Clark's has not fared well there lately. Oh, you might want to emphasize the gratis minners."
6482668,prov1800,2020-09-11 16:28:00,5010,Glad to hear you guys had a great time.Usually the norm at any of Clarks outposts.Lot of bashing going on so real nice to here a positive review of Clarks.Lot of Canadians are really missing the boat by not paying much attention to North Western Ontario.Definatly a great getaway.

6483776,prov1800,2020-09-15 06:07:00,5010,Usually a fishing site should smell fishy.Iam headed to Cedar this morning.Little bit of muskie fishing and get supper to.Not going to far.Ill cast 5 spots a couple of times each.Usually ill see some walleye schools from where i have boat position.gloomy day right now but fairly warm and fairly calm.My kind of fall day.
6483778,Guest,2020-09-15 06:28:00,0,That new airplane is the reason Clark's is keeping deposits.
