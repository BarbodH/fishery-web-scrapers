6486128,BornToFish,2020-09-23 05:44:00,1224,"Greetings,I cancelled nine fishing trips this season, five of which would have been in NW Ontario. We limped along this season on some local fishing day-trip excursions. My wife and I greatly miss our annual trips, such that we are already looking forward to next season's trips. Other than an open border, what are you most looking forward to when fishing next season in NW Ontario? For me, it will be the familiar ""tick-tick"" felt when a walleye picks up my jig + minnow.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6486134,walleyecheek,2020-09-23 06:00:00,2231,For me it'll be cracking open an ice cold Labatts Blue while sitting around the camp fire !!!
6486144,stjoeguy,2020-09-23 06:31:00,979,"2021? Maybe, we'll see. I hope you're right. I look forward to being able to plan ahead. In normal times, I'd be thinking about getting the boat ready for storage at this time of year and eagerly planning ice fishing trips for this coming season. I've got a bucket list type ice fishing trip in mind but don't dare book it until I know the border will be open. Even our annual trip to the NW Angle is in doubt. March usually includes some time in Hawaii. 2020 didn't work out, will 2021? Will we fly to the grandkids for Christmas? We're still unsure about flying. I'm a planner. Organizing and planning fishing trips, ice fishing trips, and vacations is half of the fun. So, I look forward to being able to plan ahead again! In NW Ontario, I look forward to the immediate blood pressure decrease and relaxation that comes when the road signs change to kilometers and when we turn north on 502 and start driving through that great Canadian Shield land of rock, trees and lakes. Can't wait!"
6486170,Mojo-NC,2020-09-23 07:31:00,1929,"I'm all about the hunt. I love to look for and find new spots where we can go and feel the tick-tick that you mentioned. If the border opens next year, we will be going to a fly-in lake that we've only fished once before, and that was at a later time in the year. It's not a huge lake, but it's big enough. We have dropped a lot of waypoints that were good in early-to-mid September, but that's not necessarily where they'll be the first week of August. I love to search them out and try to figure out what is unique about a spot where we get into them. I like to pick apart the area and fine tune the optimal depth, structure, and conditions. I then apply that information to the rest of the lake and identify other similar spots. Once we get into a bunch of fish, I also like to try an array of different techniques to see what works the best or maybe catches the larger fish. I'll give up the numbers game to catch fish using new or unique techniques."
6486206,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-09-23 08:42:00,240,"For me, it will be a lot of things. Just the feeling of getting behind the wheel and traveling with good friends as the anticipation builds for the trip, stopping at Fleet Farm in Duluth for another 2-3 dozen jigs I don't need, KFC in Virginia, crossing the border, dinner at Green's in Nestor Falls. Probably the single biggest thing I am looking forward to, though, are the shore lunches. I will never ever ever again take for granted how great those meals are. And how much I love being in Canada. Missed 3 outpost trips and a boundary waters trip this year, and summer was just not the same. Born to Fish--it's time for you to write another book! Anything in the works?"
6486216,stjoeguy,2020-09-23 08:56:00,979,"We've gotten used to going back to the cabin for lunch. Shore lunch is hard work. But you're right, it's a great part of the experience and I look forward to adding shore lunch back into our routine, especially if I can get a grandson up to Ontario this year for his first Canada trip! He was supposed to be part of our August 2020 fly-in, but..."
6486218,rosh1,2020-09-23 09:03:00,275,Canadian Time. Its what I call the slow down and enjoy life attitude that happens when I cross the border. My wife makes fun of me because I take naps there. I missed a whole summer of naps!

6486222,stumcfar,2020-09-23 09:06:00,451,"We are planning to bring our camper to the Sioux Narrows area in May and leave it there for a month. Mostly to fish Lake Trout, but also some walleyes and smallmouth. I have concerns, that even if the border opens and we are allowed, I am nervous about doing this. The concern is, if there is a virus outbreak and the border gets shutdown, our camper will be stuck in Canada. Might have to eat a deposit and rethink this plan."
6486300,BornToFish,2020-09-23 10:51:00,1224,"Greetings,Guys: great responses! I can relate to many of the comments offered as to what is most missed.Mojo: I also enjoy the hunt. I took a huge step forward in my understanding of the hunt when I purchased a Humminbird Helix unit a few years ago. I started by mapping some of my favorite ""spots"". I didn't have much of an understanding of these ""spots"" other than they produced fish for me on a consistent basis. Mapping the depth contours helped me understand why many of these ""spots"" produced fish. I used this information to search out similar spots. A common feature of many of my ""spots"" is that they have quick access to relatively deep water.Michigan Guy: I authored a third edition of my book about two years ago. I added around forty to fifty pages of new material. I then started organizing the printing of the third edition, and quickly learned that the numbers had tilted backwards on me.Making a profit was never an objective of my book project. Rather, I just didn't want to lose money on the venture. Increased costs for printing, shipping the books to me and shipping books to the customer had eaten up my profit over the years. The profit on my third edition of the book was down to $0.34 per book, and that was before marketing costs.My primary outlet for selling books dried up on me. I was then expected to pay for access to several different markets, which would necessitate a hefty increase in price of the book. Honestly, I was not interested in laying out a tidy sum of money to have my books printed and then try to recapture my costs on a piecemeal basis.I'm very glad that I wrote my books. I was able to help quite a few folks, satisfy my joy in teaching, make some great friends and crystallize many thoughts about fishing.By the way, I recently came across a single copy of my book (2nd edition) that I am willing to sell, in case someone is interested.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
