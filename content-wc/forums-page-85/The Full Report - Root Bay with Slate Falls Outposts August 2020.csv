6486388,gordy28,2020-09-23 14:31:00,437,I finally got the time to get the full report finished It's a long one but one I really enjoyed writing up as it seemed to extend the memory (real life seems to come at you fast lol) As mentioned earlier hoping this doesn't rub salt in wounds but instead whets appetites for future trips Overall we had an amazing time - lots of surprises good and bad. For us the fishing was epic and I would definitely recommend Slate Falls as an outfitter and Root Bay as a destinationhttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/s...ph-trip-report Cheers Andrew
6486400,Lovetofish,2020-09-23 15:17:00,458,"Thanks for the great report, Gordy. Can't wait to get that far north again next July. My string of 25 years in a row was broken this year, like for many others. Here's hoping things settle down and we all can get back to that beautiful country."
6486470,gordy28,2020-09-23 20:10:00,437,Thanks for the kind words. That sucks about your broken streak - ideally your back to your special place in 2021 Typically our group goes every two years for the fly in but recently we have been talking about doing a shorter trip closer to home - I think the idea of waiting two years is not appealing at all

You sure put a lot of time and effort into your reports, and it is much appreciated by this guy who can't wait to get back to Canada. Thanks again!"
6486524,stjoeguy,2020-09-24 05:55:00,979,Great report. We were supposed to be there this August and you might have even been in our time slot. I'm glad you got to enjoy Root Bay. I've forwarded your report to guys that will be going next year. Slate Falls definitely runs a good operation with great cabins. I can hardly wait to try the current below the dam! Thanks again for the fun report.
6486528,gordy28,2020-09-24 06:08:00,437,"Thanks and it was very cool - just about the best way to see a bear on a trip IMO - in a boat and he was swimming away from our cabin lol. First time I ever saw one that wasn't running beside a road or at a dumpQuote: Originally Posted by michigan walleye guy 2.0Excellent read, great photography.

Thanks again!Thanks for the kind words - it takes a lot of time but its a labour of love I guess. I find through writing and posting pictures about excursions it takes the edge off ""regular"" life back in the city. Hope you enjoy some of the other articles!Quote: Originally Posted by stjoeguyGreat report. We were supposed to be there this August and you might have even been in our time slot.

We did love Root Bay - at first we were a bit disappointed to not be at Miniss but then we were just happy to be going and now I can't believe how lucky we were to experience it. Definitely check out the dam - hit me up before you go - there is an easy way to get down to where we caught tons - but we missed it the first time around and wasted some effort lol"
