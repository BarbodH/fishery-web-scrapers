What if anything do you think should/could be done. I have a three Ontario license. I mainly use my Ontario in the area where I live on the Detroit River/Lake Erie, but also have purchased a license for trips to Lake of the Woods. I would hope that something would be done by the responsible governments. Bob"

No one could have predicted the pandemic at the time I bought my license, nor could they have predicted that the U.S. would have such a horrible infection rate and death rate, which caused Canada to close their border."

6486968,eyecatcher1,2020-09-25 16:24:00,323,I am in the second year of a three year Ontario license. When I heard that people were getting refunds I called the MNR. I was told that since I have a three year license I wouldn't get a refund for 2020 because they have no way Of knowing if I ice fished in Ontario before the border closed.

We are retired people, getting this money is not going to make or break us but it would be nice. Bob"
