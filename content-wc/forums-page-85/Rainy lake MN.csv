6488612,prov1800,2020-10-01 19:32:00,5010,All free.We are being over run with mice this year.crazy.everyone has them.i had some but but set up my trapline throughout the house and ckeaned them up.Got all the ones up at Gull lake to.Didnt get the squirrel that came in through the bathroom.He came right in cabin couple of times.Little wild life is entertaining.never have used them for bait.
6488614,7 Mag,2020-10-01 19:45:00,1887,Two of my favorite fish; crappies and walleyes good luck tomorrow!
6488616,prov1800,2020-10-01 19:50:00,5010,Let you know tomorrow. Walleyes will be easy and close.Crappies ill have to travell 15 mi.mhhhh.I really want to pound the rocks for muskies first.
6488260,Eckohlt,2020-09-30 13:24:00,3685,Big northern love fresh mice swimming across the top of the water
6488446,fishingMN4eyes,2020-10-01 10:22:00,108,Ok.
6488498,Eckohlt,2020-10-01 12:24:00,3685,Northerns like to eat gophers also
6488552,prov1800,2020-10-01 15:02:00,5010,If you guys were seeing fish did anyone fish a vertical lindy rig.I basically use that up here in canada from mid july on. If they ignore a jig its lindy time with a big minnow hooked in the upper lip only.
6488574,emma17,2020-10-01 16:43:00,436,"I wish I would have tried that- and a bobber too. In the Kempton Channel we marked many fish from 25'-40'. I used a traditional Lindy Rig, Jig and trolled Spinners and Bottom Bouncers. Nada."
6488576,1700SS,2020-10-01 16:52:00,104,"Stayed at Sha Sha last week. Owners were great to deal with. Restaurant/Bar was closed for the season, but not a big deal to us. Stayed in cabin 10 which is their new cabin, very nice. Fishing was slow as everybody has stated. 5-10 walleyes a day is what we averaged for 4 guys. We hired Rainydaze guide service for a day. Guides name was Brent, very knowledgeable and good guy. Caught maybe 10-15 with him that day. Marked fish all week. 30-40 feet of water was the depth. Jig and minnow was the ticket but jigging rap outperformed a couple days. Came home a day early, which never happens on an Ontario fishing trip. Hopefully the border will be open next year."
6488594,Lmbkiller,2020-10-01 18:44:00,639,At least it sounds like everyone has figured out just how poor mn fishing really is. Unfortunately I doubt border will open up anytime in the next 10 months or more
6488602,prov1800,2020-10-01 18:58:00,5010,I love a challenge.Tough days are fine with me.Sometimes to easy here.Last week on Gull Lake it was everytime you flipped jig in you had a fish. What werè the water temps on Ŕainy.I definately would have tried shallow.Maybe lake was turning over or had.Makes a big diff.My son fished Cedar the ither day and found walleyes and bass in 18-22 ft.Iam headed there tomorrow.Mostly a muskie day but will go for walleyes to.Cold ride tomorrow 0c tonight.Might run to east end to and try some crappies.
6488606,Eckohlt,2020-10-01 19:10:00,3685,"Maybe 10 months for you,but I'll be rockin n rolling in a boat next June Filling the gut with nice 15 inch eaters"
6488608,Eckohlt,2020-10-01 19:18:00,3685,"John leave the swim suit at home and replace it with the thermos,do you have any live mice for bait?i think mice in Ontario are free"
6485700,Eckohlt,2020-09-21 12:58:00,3685,I live in Minnesota now I know why I don't fish in mn
6485708,That Minnesota guy,2020-09-21 13:08:00,8293,"Trust me, the folks in I-Falls can't wait for the border to open either. But the upside is maybe by the time it opens they will be done tearing up HWY 53 in town. They are down to McDonalds now."
6486292,fishingMN4eyes,2020-09-23 10:41:00,108,This. When giving the tutorial on the houseboat they tried to make it seem like we had to be careful with leaving the plank down and whatnot. After what we saw we were all but certain that the houseboat had mice on it before we even drove away from the dock.
6486294,fishingMN4eyes,2020-09-23 10:42:00,108,Sorry the fishing didn't cooperate for you either. At least I know it wasn't just us.
6486302,Baseline,2020-09-23 10:56:00,3207,I going to Rainy next Monday. Everyone heads east on Seine Bay and fishes the main reefs or though Brûle and fishing the main reef and the entry to bay south of Brule. I think there has been a ton of pressure on those reefs this year. Over the years I've learned to go toward I-Falls and fish the small reefs in the center lake as the lake starts to neck down and heads toward the dam. The deeper water off the weed beds in that area are also good especially in late afternoon and evening. Rainy is no different from any other lake when it goes neutral the bite slows down or is non-existent. Although it has been a few years I've used Rainy Lake House Boats and thought they had great service. The boat we had was in good shape. My wife and I are booked for 5 night anniversary trip for the fall of 2021. It's the only way I get her take a fishing trip with me. I go fishing she sits on the deck and enjoys the view.
6486406,emma17,2020-09-23 16:02:00,436,"We made the decision to head east of the Brule as you mentioned, and I admit I was doubting myself on the way back when looking at all the options. It's a tough call though as there sure are a lot more boats west of the Brule given the number of nearby camps. I don't know, I wish I would have tried drop shotting or even a bobber when marking fish. Our best spot (3 fish- all nice: Walleye, Northern and Smallmouth) was casting Rattle Traps anchored between a couple small islands w strong current."
6486482,Lmbkiller,2020-09-23 21:00:00,639,"If u guys are averaging 5 fish per day on rainy lk my highly educated suggestion is stay home and go to the local trout pond. Mn has always sucked for fishing, that's why I don't go there"
6486488,rockpt,2020-09-23 22:35:00,589,"Always entertaining to listen to the VHF evenings at the cabin at LOTW and hear all the chatter between houseboat renters and base about beached boats, lower unit damage, motors that won't start, broken appliances and on and on."
6488240,MrSimon,2020-09-30 12:03:00,922,"If you think about it though ... almost every outpost I've rented over the years has some mice in it. Nobody cares, it's just part of renting a shack in the deep woods. Maybe it's just all part of the experience of houseboting."
6488242,walleyecheek,2020-09-30 12:15:00,2231,better a few mice than a few bears !!!
6479138,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-31 14:08:00,108,"We were on a ""Kempton"". Same layout as yours minus the jacuzzi from the looks of it."
6479150,emma17,2020-08-31 16:17:00,436,"That sure is a disappointing report- sorry the trip wasn't better for you. I haven't thought of it before, I guess that's one of the negatives of a houseboat- you can't ask the other fisherman in camp how they're doing. We head up in a couple weeks- also slated for a Kempton. Hope it's not the same one."
6479434,fishingMN4eyes,2020-09-01 13:17:00,108,"Hope you don't get #28! How many are in your group? The Kempton saying it can sleep 8-12 is laughable. Our group with six grown men was a stretch, I can't even imagine how much more crowded it would be with more than that."
6479442,Bstar,2020-09-01 13:26:00,564,"We were on Rainy Lake last week with Rainy Lake Houseboats and had the same experience. The fishing was very slow. We ended up going to Kettle Falls on Thursday afternoon because the fishing was so slow. We left a day early. That would never happen on our Canada trips. We did have a mouse problem but it was our own fault. We left the extension cord for charging the boat batteries plugged in and a couple of them got into the houseboat but they were quickly dispatched with some traps and some good Italian provolone cheese! Lol The houseboat itself needs to be updated. The tacky and dirty indoor/outdoor carpeting does not work well with a beech site on the Kempton channel. We are not picky guys but we were not happy with the houseboat. That being said, the Dougherty's are very nice people. We will probably never go back to Rainy Lake. I sure hope the border is open next year!"
6479692,emma17,2020-09-02 09:12:00,436,"They booked us on #29, your neighbor. Hopefully the mice aren't running across the pier. We only have three of us going so we should have plenty of room to stretch out. Based on all the reports I'm reading, this will truly be a ""fishing"" trip, unlike many of the ""catching"" trips we've been blessed with in Ontario."
6484142,Short Strike,2020-09-16 09:40:00,56,"Got back Sunday morning from our trip with Rainy Lake Houseboats... Though the accomodations weren't as up to date as the brochures make them look, they were still livable. Whoever said the carpet sucked was 100% correct. Boat 37 showed us her age early by requiring quite extensive generator repairs our first full day (New plugs, plug wires, distributor, magneto, carb overhaul, and new ignition points). That generator also burned/leaked about a quart of oil per day with limited use.Crazy part is that the 2 mechanics they sent out finished all of that in about 2 hours. Starboard engine on the houseboat was a PITA to start, but we always got it going with some finesse and patience. Houseboat Base was quick with troubleshooting suggestions, and to send out repair team. The fishing was as tough as mentioned, but the frustrating part is that there were fish everywhere. Magic depth was that 31' - 35' range for us, and we never struggled to find fish, just struggled to find bites. Overall, in 4 days we caught 30 fish, with 3 being over 11"" (13"", 16"" 23.5"")... and a few sauger mixed in. Stayed on the Eastern most traditional sand site on the Kempton Channel, and that site rocked. Even went in for a dip in the 60 degree water to clean up a few times. One of the most impressive beaver dams I have ever seen was just a few hundred yards from camp. All in all an ok trip, and an experience I couldn't recreate again, so well worth it. Anything longer than the 4 days would of seemed like a really long time!!"
6484198,cast_and_blast,2020-09-16 11:58:00,1098,"Regarding mice...they will come up the ropes used to tie up the houseboat. They will also traverse the ropes used to secure your fishing boat to the houseboat (for example, if you have a fiberglass boat and don't want to beach it). We watched the mice do this one evening. It was a mouse parade. So much so that we talked about bringing airsoft guns the next year to pick them off as they ran up the ropes. Scott"
6485236,MN_Moose,2020-09-19 19:49:00,964,"Just returned from a week long trip to Thunderbird. Excellent resort. Everyone very friendly and helpful. Can't say the same for the fish. They were tight lipped. What success we found was 30'-45' off islands and points. Some said a pink jig was key. IDK, we bottom bounced all the time. We did fish rat root river and had limited success with crappie. Spots were not as crowded as I had feared. Lots of houseboat traffic back and forth. Great scenery as the leaves were turning."
6485680,MrSimon,2020-09-21 11:51:00,922,"I've been tying boats up to docks, trees, and shore for decades and have never had a single mouse come into the boat. And there is almost always open food containers in my boat. I'd be shocked if the mice on the houseboat weren't there when you picked it up."
6485696,emma17,2020-09-21 12:37:00,436,"We returned (2 days early) Wednesday evening from our Rainy Lake Houseboat trip. There were only three of us on the Kempton, some comments: -Plenty of room for three, some funky sleeping quarters for larger parties- like beds under the stairs w approx 20 of head space. -The RLHB folks are really nice and they went above and beyond (brought us a new battery for our Lund). -The fishing holes weren't nearly as crowded as the houseboat parking spots. Had a couple odd exchanges w guests. We were first out of the harbor Saturday morning- giving us clear advantage for preferred spot on East side. Arrived at spot (3 hour ride) only to find a man standing on shore- w no boat. Turns out he was dropped off by the fishing boat to get ahead of us and reserve his spot. Found another spot that we later learned wasn't a spot. We found out when returning from afternoon of fishing to find a guy straight out of the movie Deliverance standing cross-armed in his white dago-T w a 6 cigarette hanging from his mouth. Hey- you can't park here- don't you know it's a campground? He continued to stare at me after I apologized and I told him we'd move in morning. I said can I help you? Yeah, you're not supposed to be here- my wife can't take a crap because you're parked too close! And if you had a wife you'd know what I'm talking about. So we pulled out. -Tried parking in the next official spot, but the stern got blown in to shore- now the houseboat is parallel w shore- I knew that wasn't good and was working through my frustration on corrective plan. As luck has it, the owner pulls up w three guys on a boat - said someone called and said we were parked inappropriately (apparently my Deliverance friend called the rangers). I was immediately told You can't park that way! Really? Here I thought it was perfectly reasonable to broadside the rocky shore and leave the houseboat as is. After some maneuvering a couple guys boarded- and I'm told again- you can't park this way. 1 1/2 Hours later we are parked and professionally tied off in a new spot. -Next day my starting battery dies on the water- at 6:45 pm. 2 hours later, w 1.8 mph on last legs of MinnKota batteries- in no-moon, pitch dark and cold, we find our houseboat. -As mentioned earlier, the folks of RLHB were awesome. Owner drove us out a brand new battery the next afternoon- and gave us ideas for spots. -The fishing. As stated by others- incredibly challenging. We found fish, but they weren't interested in our game. Jigs, Lingy Rigs, Worm Harnesses and Spinners. I think we averaged 5 fish total per day between the 3 of us. -The last night I looked out the cabin slider to see a little mouse staring in from the front deck- just waiting for me to open the door. Overall, it's an experience I'm glad I had. The fishing was harder than expected, even though I went in expecting a challenge. Beautiful area up there- just like NW Ontario. Lots of water and places to dip a line. For us, we achieved our goal of getting away for a while, which resulted in an even greater desire to return to our favorite Ontario fishing lake next year."
6475820,Guest,2020-08-19 12:10:00,0,"I was there 8/1 thru 8/8 so not very current of a report, but most people doing decent for walleyes were fishing east of the Brule, our fish were in 28ft to 32ft"
6476026,nitroman,2020-08-20 07:04:00,368,Here now and fishing is ok. Walleye are in the 28-45 foot range. Did ok pulling slow death rigs in evening and actually did the best with slip bobbers yesterday in 38ft. New lake to us so learning as we go.
6476064,Eckohlt,2020-08-20 07:43:00,3685,"Slip bobbers in 38 ft,I've never heard of fishing that deep with slips"
6476072,ChuckD,2020-08-20 07:56:00,1581,"Jig and minnow was best for me last week. Frozen shiners I brought were by far best, small fatheads not so much. When we arrived water temps were 70-72 and crashed to 63 for 2 days in heavy wind, but climbed back to 70 when we left. Drive around, find fish on the graph and fish them. If they don't bite, keep looking. We found lots of walleyes that were dormant and none of us could get them to bite. Please don't drive around another person's boat within casting distance and circle them multiple times. It's a BIG lake, find your own spot! Every time I go to Rainy I see some really disturbing behavior by others."
6476092,Eckohlt,2020-08-20 08:28:00,3685,"Slip bobbers in 38 ft,I've never heard of fishing that deep with slips"
6476096,Eckohlt,2020-08-20 08:38:00,3685,Sry for the double post
6476694,TritonEbbs,2020-08-21 18:09:00,16,I was on a Rainy 8/6 to 8/13 and the lake was extremely crowded and fisherman were rude as ChuckD mentions....I have a cabin on the Ontario side of a Rainy ( North Arm) and never have experienced other boaters just moving onto spots that I was actively fishing... All in all we caught plenty of eyes and smallies Regards Ebbs
6479130,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-31 13:54:00,108,"Got back yesterday. Fishing was slow to say the least. Got out for a couple hours when we got the houseboat parked Tuesday evening and then fished Wednesday - Friday. My brother had some success on bottom bouncers with floaters rigs, smile blades, and crawlers. I'm not a fan of bottom bouncing, and my brother wasn't exactly killing it enough to make me switch, so I threw just about every different shape, size, and color jig I had in my box along with a couple different jigging raps and rippin raps. Got literally skunked of any specie of fish on Wednesday. I Only caught one small walleye on each Thursday and Friday. It was pretty windy Saturday morning so we didn't even go out, didn't seem worth it to go fight the wind for what few fish we might manage. Our buddies did go out, caught a couple, and actually did bring one home. We were frustrated enough with the fishing and the houseboat(see below) that we decided to go sleep at the dock Saturday night and be ready to leave first thing in the morning Sunday. I don't like to do this but we were quite unimpressed with the quality of our houseboat. We were warned not to leave the plank down after dark as mice might get on the boat. We were pretty diligent about this and yet, first thing Wednesday morning we see a mouse scurry across the kitchen floor. Continued to see droppings on the countertops and visibly see mice moving in and around the houseboat at night, a couple of us even found droppings in our beds. Made us think there were already mice on the boat when we took it out. Even more frustrating is the mice then found their way onto both fishing boats(as we had them tied off on the back corners of the houseboat) so we're assuming we brought some ""friends"" home with us. We may not but giving Rainy enough of a chance but I doubt we will be going back there any time soon. If we do I can all but promise you we will not be going out through Rainy Lake Houseboats, do not recommend."
6479132,Short Strike,2020-08-31 13:58:00,56,"Please tell you you weren't on their ""Gold Rush"" house boat... we will be getting on that one next wednesday.. Not at all interested in sharing food or space with some mice though."
6479136,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-31 14:05:00,108,"Forgot to mention that our catches seemed to be in the 25-30' range. We tried reefs that came up to the teens, twenties, and mid thirties, the kind of fishing we normally do in Canada at this time of the year. Tried some shoreline structure as well but just couldn't find anything consistent. FWIW, the COs that stopped us on Friday morning said they weren't hearing many good reports so maybe it was just a bad week. There was some radio chatter Wednesday and Thursday that sure sounded better than what we were catching so it's tough to say."
6470536,nitroman,2020-08-03 08:33:00,368,So our backup plan is in affect and our group is headed to Rainy lake for a week in replacement of our Canada trip this year. we are headed up mid August and looking for tip or tricks for fishing that lake mid August. anyone else book a replacement trip this year? thanks for the help and tight lines friends.
6470546,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-03 09:06:00,108,"Same here, we will be headed up shortly after you."
6470568,Jakerides,2020-08-03 10:04:00,223,"The best fishing then should be on mid lake reefs. If fish on top aren't biting try the transition on edge. Rainy has been seeing a lot of pressure this year with more activity and no one able to fish the Canadian side. Think about fishing just before dark or very early in morning. Also bottom bouncing with half a crawler can work when fish are scattered. I assume you have a lake chip, if not get one. Lots of dangerous rocks in Rainy, go slow anytime in less then 10ft of water. good luck Wayne"
6471430,emma17,2020-08-05 11:13:00,436,"To bridge this thread w a Canada element, we too made reservations for a houseboat in September on Rainy Lake. For the last 10 years or so we did two Canada trips per year- and loved every bit of it. However, like most things in life, there is no guaranty that one or both of the trips aren't replaceable. I've no idea what a week on a houseboat on Rainy in September will be like. What if it's great? If so, we certainly face a decision next year that we never would have considered if the border wasn't closed. This isn't an argument against closing the border, I'm just pointing out the possibility of future lost business simply because we tried something new. I don't imagine the fishing on the MN side will compete well w where we go in Canada, but the combined experience might."
6471478,MrSimon,2020-08-05 13:46:00,922,"Just follow the giant parade of boats that are all sitting on off-shore structure. Or if you want to get away from the crowds, look for current or nice green weed beds - both will hold walleye."
6471550,dstar49,2020-08-05 18:47:00,33,we also went to plan b and are doing a rainy lake houseboat trip Aug 22-29. some fishing is better than no fishing!
6471662,Short Strike,2020-08-06 07:33:00,56,"We decided to audible to a Rainy Lake houseboat trip as well (wheels should have been rolling North to Morson at 5:01 this evening) ... Will be up on Rainy September 9 - 13, and looking forward to it!"
6475690,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-19 08:16:00,108,We will be up there at this time next week. Any reports?
6475706,emma17,2020-08-19 09:05:00,436,"If the fishing is anything like the reports on Kabetogama, you may not want to know. I hope you get into a great bite. As we've all experienced, things change quickly."
6475764,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-19 10:10:00,108,"Yeah, I think I've seen a few of those Kab reports you're alluding to. We'll see what happens. I hope we can find fish. But as you said in the other thread, I'm trying to temper the expectations and just enjoy getting away. And yes, we already have lighted bobber rigs ready to try off the back of the boat during cigar hour"
