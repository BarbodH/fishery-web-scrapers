I have to believe that there are a lot of elderly Canadians that own property or have rental property in the warmer parts of the US. It is not going to be a pleasant winter for them if things don't change.

Hope they come and enjoy themselves as the mask gestapo was not bad at all. Once the election is done this will die off n if they play games with the border next year I hate to suspect it but I think a lot of fishermen will be “F the bs” n fish local as it’s a joke.I do hope Canada does the right thing and offer grants, tax deferrals or other assistance to all the small businesses impacted by closing a border."

He lives outside Toronto and said he's vacation here with relatives. He flew into Denver Int Airport. He has a place in The Villages in Florida. He and several of his retired friends have places there. He said he and the rest of them plan to go there this winter.

6486034,stumcfar,2020-09-22 14:38:00,451,So air travel is permissible? Is it only from Canada to the US? Or vice versa also?
6486044,Andre (wallyandre),2020-09-22 15:01:00,2274,You can travel by plane from the US to Canada but once in Canada you need to give the address of where you are going to stay and you are in quarantine for 14 days.
