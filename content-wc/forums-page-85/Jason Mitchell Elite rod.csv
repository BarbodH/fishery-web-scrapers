During a recent trip to Birch Lake, MN it snapped when I tried to free a snagged Lindy rig. Fortunately I kept my receipt and contacted Clam Outdoors about getting a replacement. I completed the form, sent photo and copy of receipt. Clam said they will replace it, ship the broken rod to us with a check for $14 to cover return shipping. Ten days after I return the rod I get an e-mail, they do not have a 7' ML. The choices were 7' L, 6'6"" MH or 6' M. I told them how disappointed I was in the choices and that I would not spend $100 for any of them. The Customer service person explained that Clam is discontinuing this line of rods and this is all they had to offer. I took the 6'M. Never again. I'll stick with Scheels or St. Croix."

6492340,walleyecheek,2020-10-16 07:34:00,2231,yeah the gloomis NRX spinning rod is one of the best !
6492366,maddogg,2020-10-16 08:15:00,178,I would guess it might be a little bit better seeing it cost $500+.

6492568,eyecatcher1,2020-10-16 15:47:00,323,I agree! I'm sure glad that I bought mine 25 years ago when they were only $200.
6492588,fishron,2020-10-16 17:01:00,317,Down a notch from Loomis is my Fenwick Eagle 7ft one piece ML rod. I love it. It throws light baits so well. It's a pleasure to fish at about 70 bucks. Might be using it tomorrow for trout.
