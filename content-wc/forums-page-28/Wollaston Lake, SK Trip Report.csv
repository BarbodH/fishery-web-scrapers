Stayed at his house on Friday night with a plan on leaving early saturday morning, Headed out before sunrise and made it to Prince Albert, SK around 530pm MT, Checked in at the Comfort Inn and headed over to have some all u can eat ribs at Montana's Restuarant. Sunday morning it was a stop at Timmy's for coffee and were on our way. Top off the fuel in La Ronge, Sk before heading up to the lodge on 230 miles of gravel road, Road was actually more smoother than I had expected, Pulled in around 130pm MT Sunday afternoon, Unpack and get settled in, cooked a steak dinner as we decided to do the housekeeping option. Monday we went out with the owner for a day of Lake Trout fishing and get our bearings of this massive lake. We used Buzz Bomb Lures which are the go too lures for trout, Probably caught over 100 in 4hrs, Bruce (owner) cooked us a nice lake trout shore lunch on an awesome sandy beach, saw some fresh moose tracks but no sightings, it was sunny and warm day in the 80's. Tuesday we were on our own and mainly were targeting Pike, Went out about 7 miles from the lodge which turned out to be a bad idea as the wind came up over 40mph and 3-4' rollers battered us on the way back that afternoon in a 17' w/25hp wasn't fun. Wed-Fri Weather was crap, got cold, rainy, and i saw my first flakes, Windy but not bad enough to keep us off the lake. Sat-Sun Weather was back in the upper 60's-low 70's not much wind. Everyday we caught at least 50-60 pike/walleye each, I got a 36'' and my partner got a 40"". Had at least a 50'' at the boat but a netting error cost us, (name withheld). Weather obviously played a huge role in our week and the big pike were very hard to come by. Kinda dissappointing but hey that's fishing, All in all it was a great week and a great adventure, 2805 miles driven,, 1 flat tire, 3 miles from running out of gas and paying $9.50 gallon, 1 close call with a bear driving home, otherwise all good"
