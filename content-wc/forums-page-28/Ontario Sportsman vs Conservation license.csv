6687724,FrankLeigh,2022-09-23 08:15:00,80,There are only 2 zones in Ontario where you can take 6 walleye. They are Lake Huron and Lake Erie. Frank
6687788,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-23 12:33:00,151,....which is about as much fun as a root canal without sedation. Bottom line - just follow the appropriate zone limit. Sometimes sheep are smarter than you think....
6687848,Lmbkiller,2022-09-23 16:45:00,639,"Correct frank, for those 2 zones it's 6 walleyes daily. Now to the part that sucks for u (by everyone's rationale on here anyways), if u lived outside of them 2 zones u wouldn't be able to have 6 walleyes in your possession, only 4, so I guess u gotta throw 2 in the garbage. This is exact proof of why the ONTARIO POSSESSION limit is 6. I am done responding to all the naysayers on here. Like I said earlier, pointless to try and prove something to anyone that doesn't get it"
6687854,walleyecheek,2022-09-23 17:48:00,2231,I think the cards are stacked against ya pal. Better move on to the next Topic ...........LOL.LOL.LOL.
6687856,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-23 18:22:00,151,"As I said in my original post (#7) about Provincial Possession limits, we called MNR Enforcement and asked for clarification - although we described a perfectly legal application involving FMZ4 and FMZ5, they weren't ethusiastic about applying the Provincial Possession limit concept, but encouraged us to stick with more conservative zone limits. I agree it would be pointless to try to convince them otherwise. I also agree it's time to move on...."
6687868,stukkie,2022-09-23 19:16:00,21,Each zone has different limits on certain species so you need to be aware of those just like any rules that are different as a guest/visitor in any strange land we visit. Has anybody tried to decipher the fishing laws in Montana.
6687292,adempsey2.0,2022-09-21 06:20:00,611,I'd rather be a 'sheep' than someone who thinks they are clever and breaks the law only to pass the consequences of their actions down to law-abiding citizens.
6687310,Lmbkiller,2022-09-21 07:36:00,639,"I guess I don't get why regulations are so confusing to people. The Ontario provincial possession limit on combined walleye/sauger is 6. It's written rite in the regulations, it's not breaking the law, it's not hidden in the wording. It's rite there, for everyone to read and see. Don't take my word for it. See it for yourselves"
6687320,adempsey2.0,2022-09-21 08:20:00,611,"The fact is that you adamantly state that the possession limit for Ontario is 6. That is correct. I will even provide the link for it (https://www.ontario.ca/document/onta...ions#section-2). However, the entire thread was in the context of FMZ-5, where the regulations clearly state your daily limit is 2 walleye/sauger with a possession limit of 4. The OP did not ask about the provincial possession limit so why even bring it up? Also, it is clearly stated in that link I included above that the FMZ matters: ""Always check the regulations for the Zone in which you are fishing to ensure that you aren't exceeding the catch and possession limits for that Zone."". What you clearly implied is that you can keep 6 walleye/sauger in Ontario regardless of FMZ and if challenged by a CO, you can simply tell the CO that any 'extra' fish in your possession were caught in another zone, as the burden of proof is upon the CO. You can do whatever you want, but insulting people for following the rules is in poor taste."
6687344,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-21 10:28:00,151,"What he said.... I'm sorry, I should have never brought the provincial possession limit up, but I thought it might help clarify why some folks seemed to have the (generally mistaken) impression the limit was 6. I'm impressed with Lmbkiller's faith in ""innocent until proven quilty"" - good luck with that! baaaaa...."
6687368,Lmbkiller,2022-09-21 12:36:00,639,"No Dempsey, I implied nothing. In fact in several previous posts I explained EXACTLY what u can do. U are saying Im implying that u can have 6 walleyes from 1 zone. That is incorrect, and I never said as such. Clearly it's pointless to argue with people that don't get it. There are plenty of places with plenty of possession rules with plenty of COs. All kinds of different possession rules, some places with none. Just because u are incorrect doesn't mean u have to double down on being incorrect. I only fish 1 zone in Ontario so I never have more than 4 walleyes in my possession. I guarantee there's many on this site that have many more throughout their vacations. If some on here zone hop and get their 6 legally who are u or anyone else to say that's wrong? The rules are the rules. It's people and their interpretations that are twisted"
6687372,Eckohlt,2022-09-21 12:47:00,3685,"This is the first time I've heard of zone jumping to keep more fish,sounds a bit crazy to me!!or greedy."
6687388,Obabikon,2022-09-21 13:35:00,2370,"Speaking of the Canadian side of Lake of the Woods... you are 100% correct. Those are the limits. Anyone who says anything else about limits on LOTW are incorrect. Obviously, there are some loopholes with so many different zones and rules for each zone. Ignore those, and just have a great time! You're on the right track!"
6687392,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-21 13:42:00,151,"I typically stay right near the boundary of FMZ4 and FMZ5, and in the course of a usual trip usually fish in both zones. But I don't care how much in the right I might be, if a CO comes into camp and sees I have 6 walleyes in the freezer, he has prima facie evidence I'm over the limit for that zone. It then becomes mine to rebutt - who needs the hassle to 2 walleyes?"
6687416,walleyecheek,2022-09-21 15:30:00,2231,"Like I've said ""like a phone book"" (Ontario fishing regs.) Limits zone 1,limits zone2, and ect.ect.ect minnows on this lake cant go to this lake and where's your receipt for the minnows and bla bla bla bla bla !!!!!"

6687062,birddogger,2022-09-20 05:54:00,43,"Confusion up here at LOTW on our annual fall fishing trip. Ontario Houseboat Rental website spells it out the clearest as to the daily and possesion limits with the two different licenses. I infer with the Sportsman license you can possess 2 walleye per day, 4 total, 10 crappie both daily and total,15 perch both daily and total. only the walleye/sauger limit is different....Ontario fishing regulation website and brochure is not as clear as the aforementioned website. Thanks in advance for responses.."
6687070,REG,2022-09-20 06:10:00,445,"I thought the Conservation total Walleye was 2, and Sportsman is 4. Daily or in possession...And don't forget to count any Walleyes in the fridge waiting to be eaten. Or in the freezer waiting to go home. They all count toward your total in possession.."

6687138,Lmbkiller,2022-09-20 12:17:00,639,"Actually with a sportsman license in Ontario, possession limit is 6 walleye sauger combined"
6687144,eyecatcher1,2022-09-20 13:12:00,323,"Maybe in some zones, but not in Zone 4 the way that I've been told and read."
6687148,walleyecheek,2022-09-20 14:01:00,2231,Years ago it was six ! Where you been ?
6687160,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-20 14:39:00,151,"OK, I think some of the confusion might be due to the fact the current (2022) regs state the Provincial Possession limit is 6, while the Zone specific Sportsmen possession limit for Z-4 and Z-5 is 4. I don't really understand the Provincial Possession limit concept, it says it is for fish caught in more than 1 zone. We called MNR enforcement for clarification about this a few years ago regarding lake trout, it was pretty clear to us they didn't want to ""own"" it. As others have suggested common sense is probably the best approach - stick to the applicable zone possession limit."
6687188,Lmbkiller,2022-09-20 16:33:00,639,"Where u been walleyecheek? Read the regs, I am correct, everyone else is incorrect. I can get 4 walleyes in a zone with a sportsman. That's my daily limit. Then the next day I can go to a different zone, keep 2 walleyes. Now I'm done with walleyes til I eat some/all of them. This is the Ontario sportsman legal possession limit. No ifs ands buts. It's been this way for many yrs"
6687230,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-20 19:17:00,151,"So how do you convince the CO those last 2 walleyes came from a different zone? Pictures of you at the landing holding the fish? Sorry if I'm over-thinking this, but sometimes I think I'm better at attracting COs than fish."
6687272,Lmbkiller,2022-09-20 22:59:00,639,"If u legitimately did just what I said and told the CO exactly what u did, the burden of proof is on him to prove u didn't. Bottom line, don't break the law and u have nothing to hide. And the Ontario sportsman license possession limit is 6. End of story. It's not even worth bringing up what if scenarios. Now if u wanna talk about how many people actually know, and go get this achievement, that's different. Cuz I would say basically no one does. However, it's legal, possible, and totally within the rules. All this thread is, is more proof people really are sheep"
