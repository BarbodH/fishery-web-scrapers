6687984,kona77,2022-09-24 15:13:00,236,Our first trip with the Clarks was to Grace Lake and I agree it is a walleye factory. We also caught several perch and some were part of our fish fry's. Of all the lakes we have fished with the Clarks we have seen the most moose on Antenna.

6687992,prov1800,2022-09-24 15:46:00,5010,Agreed on the walleye factory.Grace was open so we went.Did see the cow and heard a bull close by and some cows calling on the frosty thurs morning.wayne would fly us back some place and might do that.But was fun to experience Grace.I think he had hunters on most other lakes.
6688054,prov1800,2022-09-25 06:20:00,5010,All the work involved with getting a moose out is all worth it.Just at our age we have to do it a bit slower.We have always made sure of a proper shot and make sure that they don't travell to far most have been within a 100 yards.
6688228,Skywagon,2022-09-26 06:26:00,1106,Have you got any good pictures of pulling a harvested moose down the lake behind the boat John? I don't think most people on this site are probably aware of how common it is to do that. Yes they do float.
6688254,prov1800,2022-09-26 07:24:00,5010,Got a couple of a moose floating from last time i guided at Okanse Lake.And pic of moose after we used comealong to get moose up on shore.Bit of work afterwards.
