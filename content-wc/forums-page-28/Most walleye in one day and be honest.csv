6677184,Rondogpike1,2022-08-03 05:19:00,5,Everybody is different Old Timer. We have done this for over 30 years and laugh all day in the boat. You call it bragging we call it fun. You call it lame we call it great fishing that we do not get at home. I will agree with one statement you made - to each their own.
6677254,emma17,2022-08-03 12:16:00,436,Amen brother! There's been many times our group said - wish we were counting. No bragging or lameness.
6677352,C&K,2022-08-03 22:16:00,492,You ask for fishing stories on the internet? That's almost worse than deer hunting stories at the bar. ROTFLMFAO!
6677360,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-03 22:44:00,240,"Did you guys get into Meta or Brace on your trip? When you say 101 and 80, is that for the week? Or on your last day?"
6677376,Rondogpike1,2022-08-04 05:30:00,5,"michigan walleye guy 2.0, We only fished Ara Lake. Saw numerous wooden boats coming from Meta. The 181 fish day was 1 day (our best day) during our trip."
6677428,kona77,2022-08-04 14:03:00,236,"I am like most on here and just really enjoy the experience of fishing Canada. Have had so many days of just unbelievable fishing. For a number of years we had $ on the biggest walleye/gator but at the end of the trip we would just laugh and never exchange any money. I was happy to see guys mention two lakes that I have fished (Wright, Cherrington) so our group must be doing something right. I just never ever tire of feeling that ""tap..tap"" of a walleye biting on a jig. I did sit at the edge of a waterfall this year and just caught fish after fish for 3 hours. Literally just drop the jig over the side of the boat and repeat over and over. Caught a few over 22"" but most were chunky/hard fighting 16""-19' fish. Walleye jig fishing is my ""drug"" of choice and I am hopelessly addicted !!!"
6677498,REG,2022-08-05 06:40:00,445,"I treasure my fishing time in Canada for a lot of reasons. One of those reasons is that it is so far removed from the routine and duties of the rest of the year back home. When I fish, there are no quotas, reports, accounting, numbers, or deadlines involved. No set start times. The closest thing we have to a quitting time is it getting too dark to see. If that's what we feel like that day. The other reason for no counting in my boat goes back to when I started bringing the kids up. Some liked to fish more and some just enjoyed being out in the boat, but I didn't want anyone feeling bad if they caught the fewest. (I'm usually the one that catches the week's smallest and I'm happy to get my picture with that Northern that's smaller than the lure) I just wanted them to enjoy the whole week, no matter how many or how big the fish they caught. And I think from their stories and desire to go back that they always had a great time. So if counting adds to your enjoyment, awesome! But if you fish in my boat, I would hope that you just focus on enjoying whatever fish we happen to catch that day and remember the overall experience instead of the numbers."

6674310,grindstone,2022-07-21 13:33:00,201,"That's a great day! - especially the other two in the boat caught 3 - part. We don't use a counter but in a week at Moose Point Lodge (our go to for 20+ years) we'll have periods of time a couple of the days where if you open your bail you won't be able to get a 1/4 oz jig to hit the bottom. 100 before lunch is average/expected daily for my son and I in the boat. We do keep a count until we eventually start laughing so hard that we give up counting. Lunch, a short nap for me, SM in the afternoon and walleye again after dinner into the long twilight. We only measure those we feel will break 27"" a $ board fish for us. It varies year to year but 7-13 PP and yet I personally have failed to boat a 30"" 2 years of border closures and a flood cancellation 2022 - gosh, the good old days! Great to hear the stories."
6674990,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-07-24 15:06:00,240,"Maybe we bumped into each other! I always had a slot at the beach cabin late May/early June from 2001-2017. Lost our slot when the older guys all quit at once. Larus is an absolute fish factory in early June. The inlet river can be so packed with 21-23"" fish that it is not to be believed. And the little 'pike' bay on the way to the outlet is almost always packed with big walleye feeding on emerging insects in the muddy corner by a little creek trickling in. But, like anywhere, the bite can be tough for one reason or another. Not going to lie about that, for sure. I'm going back to Larus next month, staying at the bay cabin. Not sure what to expect, it being August, but the spots marked on the lake map are almost always money in the bank. Weather is always the big variable. The main lake portion can turn dangerous during a strong east or west wind. Onepine Lake, our new May/June spot, is also one heck of a great lake, too. Had a great trip this year. It was great to be back."
6676752,Moosebunk,2022-08-01 10:23:00,211,"Portaged into the boat cache on Bauers from Onaman River Resort and a buddy and I once finding the right spot popped 70 on a late afternoon in July. That lake has an awesome average size. Wife and I just fished Nipigon catching 72 in 3.5 hours first morning, then with a buddy along 60 on a second morning 2 hour fish. All males it seemed, late spawn this year, high and cold waters in Northern Ontario. Partridge Lake, a portage lake beside Kesagami, after fishing pike all day we'd stop at one weedline to peg smaller eyes for an hour at sunset. That was usually good for 30 to 50 fish per boat. For fun, I tried stretching bubblegum onto my jigs and that worked. Best afternoon I've heard of for Kesagami is 404 walleye in one boat. Back in 2005/06 I think it was, a buddy and I crossed the southern expanse of James Bay to enter a tidal river called the Mississicabi. It was there we'd get about 300 per two day trip, the fish feeding best on the hightide as the rising waters would flush more insects out of the shoreline grass. Alot of surface action. First place I'd ever seen walleye actually jump out of the water to try and grab jigs suspended off the side of the boat and interesting because the waters there are just a touch saline."
6676946,Rondogpike1,2022-08-02 05:47:00,5,"Returned from Ara Lake Saturday July 30. We keep count daily as there is $ on the line for most walleye. largest walleye and largest pike. My buddy boated 101 (his personal best) and I had 80. We were shallow (4-6'). Quarter ounce jig with a twister tail and a small chunk of crawler. I tried not tipping my jig for a while as they were snapping but it was noticeably slower without meat. All 181 fish were 15"" - 18"" in length. We went through a pile of tails."
6677048,Old Timer,2022-08-02 11:21:00,255,"I never count and neither do the people I take with. And no contests either. The few times I've mistakenly taken a braggart, it's one trip and done. We've fished Canada enough to know a fair day from a great day. And it's all dependent on what you're fishing for. Sitting below an outpost rapids and clicking eaters seems kinda lame to me. But everybody is different."
6672882,Anonymouse,2022-07-15 13:14:00,834,"On at least 3 separate occasions, 3 of us in a single boat, brought in over 200 Walleyes in a single day on Lake Mendota.On one particular outing only 3 were legal (>15""), two were in the 3+ lb. range and the biggest one Anonymouse has ever landed was 5.25#.The funny part of all that was that the other 30-50 boats around us weren't even getting a single bite - we only saw 1 white bass caught by anyone in another boat surrounding us from 25 feet to 200 yards away.If you were on ""the spot"" you couldn't set a rod down, if you weren't, NOTHING was going to hit your hook.Peeps get REALLY pushy in such a situation and we were constantly bouncing sinkers off other boats in an attempt to keep them at least 20-30 feet away.They've since raised the legal limit to 18"" there so it's unlikely anyone will experience that much action in a single day again but it's still possible to catch a LOT of those 15"" 2-year-olds that were stocked the previous spring (2 year alternating stocking cycle of 7""-8"" fingerlings).On 1 of those outings we took off at noon and went to another spot about a mile away and caught maybe 50 small-mouth bass in a couple of hours before going back to ""the spot"" and resuming catching another 100 or so Walleyes after 2 PM.That was the occasion where we caught all 3 ""keepers"" and all 3 of them around 5PM-6PM - which seems to be the ""magic hour"" on Lake Mendota for catching nice sized Walleyes. When the kids were very young we hit a bunch of Walleyes in mid-August in a dead-end slough off the Jump River up near Holcomb, WI, about a mile east upriver from the confluence with the Chippewa.They were all piled just off a deadfall sticking into the water from shore and each time we rowed back up and floated past the deadfall both kids would hook up. After about 20 passes and 40 or so Walleye we had a legal limit of 20 (wife was along too), so Anonymouse started up the motor and promptly mangled half the catch on the stringer in the prop.<Sigh>Anyway, after watching a swimming porcupine for a while on the way back, we finally got back to the lake house and ended up with 15 Walleyes, a nice 2.5# smallmouth, and about a dozen decent perch - but the perch had some kind of black-spot parasite under the skins (Heterosporis sutherlandae ??) so Anonymouse threw those out (see attached photo).There is just nothing finer than watching your young children experiencing a fast Walleye catch for a couple of hours to make life feel complete."
6672900,Anonymouse,2022-07-15 14:20:00,834,"The above quantities were derived using a ""reverse algorithm"" & rounding DOWN."
6672912,Baseline,2022-07-15 15:26:00,3207,We were fishing a English River pinch point leading out of Separation Lake. It had a big rock pile running for 100 feet. Walleyes were on the bite. We raced the guys in another boat to 100 pitching jigs and crawler parts. We beat them 100 to 95. Took a break for lunch. Those guys who were camped near us challenged us for round two. We decided to use plastics for the late afternoon competition. We won round two 100 to 90. That is the only time I ever counted. So 4 of us caught at least 400 walleyes off that one rock pile in one day. No telling how many times we caught the same fish. Walleyes were so easy to catch we spent the next 3 days of our trip hunting pike and SMB.

However, my son and I fished an outpost lake one day where I did keep track of our numbers one afternoon. We caught 80 walleyes in about 4 hours that were between 18"" and 21"". We quit fishing when we hit the magic number 80. We left base camp to drive to the outpost lake at about 9:00 AM. We had to drive about 50 kilometers up a logging road to where we turned off and drove about 1/2 mile up a lane through the woods to an open area where we parked. We then hiked about 1/4 mile through mosquito and bear infested jungle to get to the lake. No joke because we actually saw 4 large bears and a bunch of piles of bear scat on our trip to and from the lake. We had to promise to be off the water by 4:00 PM because we were the only two people fishing the lake that day and they didn't want to have to search for us in the dark if we didn't return at a reasonable time. We got off the water, locked everything up, hiked back through the bear and mosquito infested jungle, and then then drove the 50 kilometers back to our base camp. I think that's the best day of fishing I've ever had in my entire life."

6672258,Carnhzkr,2022-07-12 18:12:00,964,"I had hesitated to post about this, because I know it will be read with a lot of skepticism and eye rolling, but I flew in to St Joseph with StJoguy and his crew last August and we stayed at their Root Bay outpost, which is on the far western side of the lake, and maybe a 6 or 7 mile boat ride down river to the dam. Ryan had told us we should experience the fishing below the dam because ""you'll catch a walleye on every cast"". I knew that had to be an exaggeration, but we had to see for ourselves. There's a large rock outcropping maybe 100 yards below the dam, which can accommodate a group of fisherman and that's were we started. At that point, I'd estimate I was catching a small walleye on every third or fourth cast. That was fun, but I soon began moving closer to the dam and the ultra-fast water, to a point where I stood on a rock below where the water would cascade over a ledge into a small pool. I learned that if I pitched my jig & plastic over the ledge and let the water bring the lure into the pool, there were a million hungry walleye facing up stream with their mouths wide open, waiting for something to eat to drop over the ledge. Almost every time, a walleye would take the bait as soon as my jig dropped. Seldom did I need to reel in past the initial drop and when I did, it was fun to watch a walleye seemingly come out of nowhere from behind a rock and pounce on my jig. I fished this spot for maybe 30 minutes and only a few times did I bring my jig back empty.Keep in mind that this is a barbless body of water, so it takes a short amount of time to bring the fish to my hand, slip out the barbless hook and pitch it 15 feet to the ledge. I don't know how many I caught in that 30 minute span, but I have no doubt that, on a bet, I could have landed 100 fish in an hour. That was just a one-time experience and something to think back on, but it gets old quickly.Regarding ""real"" fishing, I've had a 100+ fish day on Onaman Lake. There was a weedy bay where the wind had been blowing in all week and walleye and pike were both stacked up. Also on Zizania last year. It took a while for us to find the large school, but once we did, it was lights out. 100 per day there is no big deal. I don't count fish so I'm estimating, and every time we try to keep a count, it's easy to loose track."

East end of Lac Seul 2' to 10' deep, heavy chop with 1/4 oz jigs and piece of crawler, then switched to Gulp minnow. Was mid-June, overcast and stiff NW wind. We fished a dozen different spots with the same conditions, all of them were on fire. We were joking about getting to 200. When we did, we went for 250. Didn't take long to get there. One buddy said we couldn't quit on an even number. So we all dropped our jigs at the same time. One guy got bit off, I lost mine halfway to the boat and other friend landed his. We quit for the day. I wore my wrist brace the last couple hours. Our wrists and arms really got sore. Fish size was all over the map from 15"" to 25"". Lots of slots."

I don't know we've ever had a spot where, if we stayed, we would have 100 fish in an hour as we didn't count, but it sure felt that way. I do know we've hit a few spots over the years where it seemed every jig drop or cast was producing. We often have 4 on the boat and many times had triple headers, missing a fourth due to user error. My favorite walleye magic spot was Basket Lake, on a 9' weed line with the wind hitting the edge- in early June. Unfortunately we didn't start fishing the spot until 7:30-8:00 pm (close to camp). So many beautiful 20-25 Walleye one after the other. Wife doesn't like plastics so she caught fish on bare jig. Our spot lock failed and wind pushed us over weeds, we proceeded to have nearly the same success rate w Northern. Rattle traps over the weed tops worked great, as did top water baits. Had to leave when sun went down. Fly in to Loree Lake put us on a Northern Pike bite using top water- mostly poppers. So much fun for 45 minutes."

I mapped out ahead of time all of the possible incoming water/creeks.

6672120,Bigtaproot,2022-07-12 11:23:00,900,"Being ahead meatman requires competence of mathematics both with decimals and fractions, I wanted to clarify the math behind Minnesota guys 40% exaggeration. Most you guys might think that if I say I caught 100 fish and I only got 60 that is 40% exaggeration. In reality, if you exaggerator catch by 40% and claim 100 fish, you really caught about 71 fish."
6672122,Bigtaproot,2022-07-12 11:24:00,900,"For example, he probably caught 65 or 66 fish using Minnesota guys algorithms"
6672124,Eckohlt,2022-07-12 11:25:00,3685,It's lot easier to round off 71 to 100.

6671898,SterlingArcher,2022-07-11 16:53:00,92,"157 on Savant, counted on a clicker. Had three separate stretches where I boated a walleye on 30+ consecutive casts. My friend who was in the boat with me was on his first trip to Canada and it just blew his mind. Could have absolutely been more but we got worn out and quit at suppertime."
6671908,NM_Trout,2022-07-11 17:13:00,1094,"116 for my daughter and me on Goose Lake. Jig heads with minnows. She got bored and took a nap in the bow of the boat or we would have been higher :-) It really turned on after 9pm, but to tell you the truth I sort of got bored with it too. They were all 14 to 18"" fish."
6671920,SJC305,2022-07-11 17:46:00,154,171 with three guys in about 8 hours in Longlac. Had 104 by the noon shore lunch and ran out of bait by 6pm. Bite was strong at start and finish with a long lull at mid-day. Just vertical jigging crawlers and minnows.

Based off some different techniques I'm privy to, most of what I've read is highly believable, which I'm pleasantly surprised at. Maybe there is still hope not all anglers are liars. Keep it comin"

6671832,djk50164,2022-07-11 12:28:00,370,209 lac suel spring time casting shoreline 2 guys 8hr fishing time. We have used counters for years since we had one boat in our group that no matter how many fish we caught they would always have double our catch. It's actually fun to have one guy run the counter and then at the end of the day see how close you can guess the total catch. But I will say this I have had more fun with less fish caught. Hands were very sore at the end of the day.
6671836,Ltrain,2022-07-11 12:41:00,4145,"2 guys - caught 40 drifting bottom bouncers and harnesses on Erie in May 2018. Could have caught 100+ if we didn't run out of bait. Averaged 40 a day for a week on Mille Lacs in June 2019, this was during three seperate hatches( mayfly, black fly and moth). Was told if we got there the week before it was 100 a day. Those two instances stand out as the big ones"
6671838,southernEyes,2022-07-11 12:43:00,232,"104 + 100. Two guys, same boat. Dawn to dusk with a shore lunch in there somewhere. A lake on the Club Trout Lake plan in Quebec. Between July 4 & 12, circa 2009. Jigging gulp leeches, live crawlers, and pulling spinners. Fished 3-4 different areas throughout the day. A cold front passed sometime during the mid afternoon and really killed the bite. We had set a goal of 100 each that day, after each getting 50+ before lunch the previous day. The last 20-30 fish were tough. We couldn't go slow enough for them, so we anchored tight on a 15' reef. Using gold light wire hooks, 6lb mono and (1) split shot, we pitched the worms away from the boat and let them slowly fall to the bottom. By fan casting all around the boat and not letting our baits soak on the bottom, we were able to catch a bunch of finicky fish to finish the day. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
