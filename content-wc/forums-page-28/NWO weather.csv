6686712,Eckohlt,2022-09-17 18:18:00,3685,I'm taking a few tip-ups!!
6686714,Eckohlt,2022-09-17 18:22:00,3685,"That was a fast week,time fly's when you hammering fish,sounds like a good trip,12 years n I can retire at 80,I need to get 60 years in."
6686720,RichA$1970,2022-09-17 20:00:00,1159,"[QUOTE=Eckohlt;6686714]Eck, 1/2 oz pink jigs as it was choppy worked best, we got 4 dozen minnows every morning but white or pink twister tails worked just as good. It was a real light bite but I bet when you get up there next week the feed bag will be on…you’ll rock it like usual."
6686726,Bill Krejca,2022-09-17 20:31:00,6107,"Best time of the year, without a doubt! Bill"
6686760,Eckohlt,2022-09-18 07:45:00,3685,[QUOTE=RichA$1970;6686720]We will give it our best weather permitting!
6686774,prov1800,2022-09-18 09:50:00,5010,[QUOTE=Eckohlt;6686760]Good luck Rod.Still kinds ugly.Yesterday could barely see any shoreline.Fishing was still very good but around noon it started to slow down to a trickle..No planes flying to pick up guests so today not very good again.Might get out today to Grace or will go in tomorrow.Looks like sunny day.All packed up and hoping to get the call.Be nice to get there and unpack and be ready for early hunt tomorrow.Will be off grid till next week so best of luck with your trip.
6686800,Eckohlt,2022-09-18 15:05:00,3685,"[QUOTE=prov1800;6686774]Same to you john,give'm hel on grace lake,moose n the fish."
6686888,prov1800,2022-09-19 06:46:00,5010,[QUOTE=Eckohlt;6686800]We are out of here this morning at 9:30.wife and will be in a beaver and will be dropped off at Grace and then plane will go back to Latreille Lake and pick up Mike and Jenny maybe 10 min flight back who will spend the week with us hunting.Pretty nice weather this morning.Mostly blue skies this morning.Nice day to travel.Might grab a few freebie minnows or just not bother as i have some artificial stuff and then will save some gullet.Catch you when ever we all get back on line.
6686598,prov1800,2022-09-16 19:38:00,5010,It's in full swing right now.Bring rain gear
6686600,prov1800,2022-09-16 19:43:00,5010,Depends on where your hunting.The lakes up north are actually very low and moose do feed on aquatic plants still.Ill be calling to bring a bull in that's the exciting part.
6686602,prov1800,2022-09-16 19:46:00,5010,Hopefully our weather up north will be different than down here..We are bringing our deer hunting blinds in case of rain.
6686606,Golden Eagle,2022-09-16 20:05:00,2642,"My body is in September, but my mind seems to be stuck in late July."
6686608,prov1800,2022-09-16 20:07:00,5010,I miss July to .Where did it go.
6686624,Eckohlt,2022-09-17 05:15:00,3685,"It's that time of year.the crowds will dwindle big time,looks like a cool week when I'm up week of 24th,I love it,the wind can stay home!!!"
6686682,walleyecheek,2022-09-17 13:19:00,2231,Take your ICE auger just in case ! Wouldn't hurt to bring a spud bar to !
6686688,RichA$1970,2022-09-17 15:58:00,1159,"Driving back now from Wildewood on Lake Savant. A week ago the water temp was 63 and yesterday at 58. Fishing was really good and the eyes were anywhere from 10-28’. Weather was good, 1.5 rainy days but they were still biting. Top notch resort."
6686690,walleyecheek,2022-09-17 16:32:00,2231,Holy crap ! You just left ! Time flies when your not at WORK !......LOL.
6686692,RichA$1970,2022-09-17 16:44:00,1159,28 more months & I’m retirement eligible at 54!
6686384,Bill Krejca,2022-09-15 18:26:00,6107,Looks great!!! Bill
6686404,prov1800,2022-09-15 20:52:00,5010,Thx Bill.love the taste of blueberries.
6686406,prov1800,2022-09-15 20:55:00,5010,These will be on the menu when we get back from our hunt next week.Season opened today.But I haven't bought a license yet.And our yard pets are safe.
6686408,pjshorthorn,2022-09-16 03:07:00,5654,Gonna be staring at this dock frequently during our trip 9/21 - 9/28. Really looking forward to the cooler temps and fall beauty. Love this lake. Hopefully a few fish are in the mix too. PjShorthorn
6686410,prov1800,2022-09-16 05:03:00,5010,Weather looks iffy.Iam on Cedar next couple of days and forecast is not very good.Rain and pretty windy looking today.Will see how it goes
6686414,Skywagon,2022-09-16 06:00:00,1106,Not a pretty moose opening weekend. Good luck.
6686416,Bill Krejca,2022-09-16 06:01:00,6107,"We seem to always see a few partridge on the road into Cedar Point, as evidenced by your pic's of a few weeks ago. Bill"
6686454,Golden Eagle,2022-09-16 07:39:00,2642,No shore line for moose hunters. Moose can stand in the trees and safely drink water. Shooting from a boat can be expensive.
6686590,johnboat,2022-09-16 19:06:00,2014,I hope fall is officially in full swing by Oct 1st!I'll be on my first Fly in Moose Hunt about an hour flight North of Red Lake.I hope to be wearing insulated gear and not shirt sleeves.
6686596,prov1800,2022-09-16 19:37:00,5010,Lots this year Bill.
6686304,prov1800,2022-09-15 10:34:00,5010,Looks like fall is coming.My lawn tractor has been put away.Yesterday the gardens were picked clean.I started the boiler outside to get some heat in the house and the shop and had to cut some.Lots of rain today and for next few days even through next week on our moose hunt up at Grace Lake.Water Temps are dropping and although we caught fish last few days they seem to be looking for different structure.Still plenty of good fishing to come.was in Vermilion Bay other day and snapped a pic of the dock on Eagle Lake with its awesome veiw.Good luck to you hardy fisherman that will be enjoying the end of the season
6686338,Walleye2242,2022-09-15 14:03:00,263,Heading up sept 24th to red lake area. Hoping for decent weather and fishing. looks like 55 degrees F. most of week. Not much rain. Fishing might be all over the place.
6686344,prov1800,2022-09-15 14:46:00,5010,Fishing will be OK.Might have to fish some different spots.Lac Suel was weird the other days I was there.22-24 ft was good but the large schools were hard to find.main lake spots were not as good as shoreline structure.No fish on mud flats had to be on rock bottom near where mud meets rock.
6686346,Eckohlt,2022-09-15 14:48:00,3685,Grace lake fishing (where dock meets water)
6686348,prov1800,2022-09-15 14:54:00,5010,Lol.more than likely.Bringing portable unit and will see if there are any sweet spots I can find.Never been there so will be fun to find some structure although up there don't think they'll be on it anymore.likely 10 ft or less.
6686350,Eckohlt,2022-09-15 15:09:00,3685,Remember your going on a moose hunt don't forget your rifle n bullets.lol
6686374,prov1800,2022-09-15 18:09:00,5010,Packed up and checked off list.
6686376,prov1800,2022-09-15 18:11:00,5010,Wife made 3 blueberry pies today.2 of them getting on the airplane.Other one about gone.
6686378,Eckohlt,2022-09-15 18:17:00,3685,Where's the ice cream?
6686382,prov1800,2022-09-15 18:22:00,5010,Like my pies straight up.
