6687912,IaDave14,2022-09-24 08:12:00,99,Livescope for the amateur fisherman.
6687932,prov1800,2022-09-24 08:56:00,5010,What exactly are you expecting from the mapping.
6687968,Obabikon,2022-09-24 11:36:00,2370,"You could say that about GPS too. Both are high end technologies that make the learning curve almost non-existent. Now, everyone knows that secret hump or point..."
6688062,last chance,2022-09-25 06:42:00,3262,I know nothing about Garmin. does it have slots for using data cards? if it does you should be able to get a Navionics card with more data on it than is on your unit. i just bought a used Lowrance hds 9 gen 3 and before I even hook it up I bought a hot maps platinum card to use in it for the eastern region which should have lake Erie on it.
6688078,Hook_settr,2022-09-25 07:27:00,127,"I was disappointed this year too. I spent 20 minutes looking for a hump in Miles Bay that Garmin's preloaded maps said was there and never found it. After I got home I checked the C-Maps on my Lowrance and it did not show the hump. Score one for Lowrance. The mapping on the local lakes here in IA seem to be accurate. I also miss the ""Look Ahead"" feature that Lowrance has when navigating. Otherwise I am very happy with my Garmin and the GT54 transducer works way better on my boat than Lowrance's A3-1."
6688112,chip,2022-09-25 11:15:00,5,I had run the Lowrance with Navionics and Lakemaster chips for the past 15 years up there on Lake of the Woods Way better than the Garmin preloaded map. Switch to Garmin this year and was pretty disappointed with the accuracy of the contour lines was hoping I could buy a chip but not seeing anything out there looking for some help. Using the quick draw contours to map my fishing spots but was not happy with traveling and in accuracies also the obstructions donâ€™t show up near as well as they did on the other chips. Anyone tried the Garmin vision chart for this area?
