6687358,Eckohlt,2022-09-21 11:02:00,3685,Welcome!
6686824,gordy28,2022-09-18 18:00:00,437,Wondering if anyone has first hand knowledge of fishing Aba lakeRead lots of great reports but more wondering about how “busy” the lake is. I believe there are 4 outposts on the lake. Trying to get a sense on whether or not it would feel busy if all 4 cabins are in use. We would be looking at mid to end of August to go. CheersAndrew

6686832,Fishquest,2022-09-18 19:32:00,89,"I was there late in the fall and we were the only ones on the lake, summer might be busy and three other camps on the lake but all spread out on big water and one camp barely used. Talk to Mike Borger when you get a chance he speaks highly of the lake and the fishing. My time there was spent mostly chasing moose so I couldn't honestly say we gave the fishing a hard go."

6686922,Spartan1,2022-09-19 10:17:00,46,"I have fished Abamasagi several times. There are four cabins on the lake; two sets relatively close to each other. It is big water and lots of areas to explore. If everyone ends up at ""the narrows"" it could get a little crowded but the chances of that are pretty slim. The cabins are far enough apart to still give you privacy. Abamasagi is accessible by road and river but you need to be a local or really know what you are doing and where you are going. Never had a problem in this regard. There are enough good spots on this lake to allow each boat/party to catch as many fish as they want. This is a really good lake. If you decide to go I highly doubt you will be disappointed."

It's very popular so book now but as said above lots of places to fish and we never had an issue in 2018 as we came to the main lake many times, it's a long run, so we moved to cabin 2 as it was open due to covid. To much to type if you want to pm me, we can talk"

6687224,bester,2022-09-20 18:46:00,18,My buddy just purchased one of the cabins there roughly a year ago. They've put a lot of work into the camp and I'm supposed to go in the spring to help with some more renovations. I know catching fish isn't a problem but I don't know how crowded it gets. I can certainly find out for you.
6687226,Eckohlt,2022-09-20 19:01:00,3685,Do you call traffic control to get the answer for that??
6687294,adempsey2.0,2022-09-21 06:22:00,611,We ran into the two new owners a couple years ago. Assuming they are the same guys who purchased O'Sullivans Lake Lodge? I seem to recall they were from Orillia. What is the name of their new operation? I forget what they told us.
