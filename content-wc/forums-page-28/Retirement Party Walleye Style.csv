6686938,txk4,2022-09-19 11:48:00,31,Congratulations on your retirement. Hope you have a great trip. You have already found one of the best parts of the retirement puzzle. I remember the exact morning when I was at our place on Flag Island and realized that there was nothing I had to rush home for!! Great feeling. Tight lines and leave a few for the rest of us. T

Nothing better!! My plan was always to be done when I turned 60, and I was able to reach that goal with a few months to spare. What did you do for 40 years? That is one long career. Hopefully you have a great report when you get back!"
