Hay Island area was not good for me on last trip , maybe 6-8 years ago. Bill"
6687064,birddogger,2022-09-20 06:02:00,43,we were at the elbow fishing crappie on Sunday and the crappie were biting fairly well..
6688296,walleyeguy3,2022-09-26 10:22:00,42,"We grabbed 22 fish between 11 and 13 inches on Friday afternoon. Most on minnows and jigs (bright colors), some on plastics. The action was consistent, but we worked hard for what we caught. Another group out there the same day caught full limits of the same size fish. They moved around and found fish wherever they stopped."
6685120,prov1800,2022-09-09 09:28:00,5010,I'd say primetime is anytime for muskies but fall you have the advantage of the weed beds leaving us which puts the muskies and the pike on the rocks.I do like Oct as the lake gets a little less traffic.
6685124,bthomas3333,2022-09-09 09:33:00,465,LOL. I love to catch all fish. TBH Pike/Crappie are my favorite. I know a weird mix and my wallet has taken a serious beating this year.I usually do a long weekend in March/April to Mississippi to catch crappies. Was thinking I need a to add a Sept/Oct trip to NW Ontario to catch some black crappies. If there are some Muskies around that time of year all the better. lolBrett
6685132,prov1800,2022-09-09 09:51:00,5010,all cylinders would be firing that time of the year
6685426,prov1800,2022-09-10 15:48:00,5010,Sounds like the Elbow could be a busy destination
6685440,1700SS,2022-09-10 16:55:00,104,It can be bumper boats at times
6685442,prov1800,2022-09-10 17:00:00,5010,I can imagine.glad iam not involved in that deal.
6685452,walleyecheek,2022-09-10 17:58:00,2231,"It amazes me what some people will do for a FISH ! $120,000 boats, $1000.00 reels (stella) etc etc. etc. ........LOL.LOL LOL."
6685460,Eckohlt,2022-09-10 18:13:00,3685,My 45$ reels can reel in fish!
6685516,birddogger,2022-09-11 06:24:00,43,"The elbow is very busy in the fall.. Fairly accurate description, bumper boats. Years ago ,we'd catch lots of crappie in the northern part of Miles bay and south of Hay island. Those were popular areas but in the last few years devoid of fall crappies. Any thoughts out there?"
6685536,Bill Krejca,2022-09-11 08:05:00,6107,"It can be an interesting place. You boat through miles of pure wilderness, then after rounding the bend, come upon a flotilla of boats. It is kinda neat, though, because in that area, the crappie fishermen, for the most part, are among the most friendly fishermen you'll ever run into. Easy to make new friends. I say this seriously. The comradery is completely different from walleye fishing, which can get rather touchy in most lakes. It can be a great place for crappie, having spent many a wonderful happy day there pulling them in, from 80 degree weather, to biting sleet and snow, sometime camped nearby, sometimes cabined. Bill"
6684594,raiderone,2022-09-07 06:19:00,4,Heading up in a week or so just wondering if the crappie fishing is happening in the Elbow yet? Thanks for the information !!
6684646,Eckohlt,2022-09-07 10:34:00,3685,I don't think you have to wry about getting tennis elbow from reef'n in crappies.
6684704,1700SS,2022-09-07 16:56:00,104,"I will also be heading up there in one week. Staying at Red Wing Lodge. I would have to think that maybe Jared/Obabikon will fill us in on the conditions. It would be much appreciated, from one Cardinals fan to another."
6684792,Bill Krejca,2022-09-08 07:37:00,6107,"The Elbow, being a destination on Obabikon Lake, where the crappies grow big, and the loons are all pretty and above average in plumage! Bill"
6684798,NETim1187,2022-09-08 07:49:00,166,"As opposed to the Devil's Elbow, where the rocks grow big and well above average."
6684930,Obabikon,2022-09-08 16:20:00,2370,The bite is NOT going yet in the elbow. We're still catching them on sunken trees hidden all over the place. They will start staging soon though.
6685098,bthomas3333,2022-09-09 08:35:00,465,I'd sure like to try and catch the fall crappie bite. What is the normal timeline? Mid-Sept to when? Brett
6685100,prov1800,2022-09-09 08:44:00,5010,Depends I guess where your going.I have had a number of parties out on Cedar Lake and they seem to be biting pretty good.Water Temps around 67f yesterday.
6685108,bthomas3333,2022-09-09 08:57:00,465,So for Cedar since you also have some Muskie (or so I've heard...lol) to mess around with with. What is primetime? Just a range...something like Sept 5-Oct 15?Brett
6685112,Eckohlt,2022-09-09 09:15:00,3685,Brett it should be under 8000$ for the big crappie bite.lol
