So many factors to consider and with so many lakes to choose from it can be overwhelming. We have graduated towards larger more complex but it probably was the right choice to do our first fly in on a small lake https://www.northernjacks.com/post/h...n-fishing-tripCheersAndrew"
6686380,prov1800,2022-09-15 18:17:00,5010,Great read.Totally agree.
6686418,HeHooksHimself,2022-09-16 06:10:00,725,Good insight. Thanks for the tips! Hooks
6686428,bthomas3333,2022-09-16 06:45:00,465,Nice report. Right on! Here is where I put the lake in term of importance: 1. People I am fishing with 2. The Lake/River 3. The Lake/River 4. The Lake.River 5. Cabin 6. Location/Access points Why? A great lake on a bad week can and will out fish an average lake. Plus a great lake can even make me look good:-) lol Brett
6686472,Eckohlt,2022-09-16 08:41:00,3685,Does a great guide come into play??
6686482,bthomas3333,2022-09-16 09:50:00,465,"Lol. In my last 10 guided experiences I have had 1 great guide. 2-3 that were helpful. Beyond that...Not going to go there. I will say one of my friends had a GREAT guide at Tazin and when their season ended he followed the guide to LLM when he moved over there for the rest of the season and really enjoyed a second week with that guide. So, I know they are out there. Let's just say I am currently avoiding guides when possible and when I cant I just hope for the best. Next week at God's River I am going to hope for the best. Navigating the river there you really have no choice. Hoping to find a big old stupid Brookie! Brett"
6686536,Old Timer,2022-09-16 12:56:00,255,"When searching for new walleye destinations I prefer lakes with a good flow in and then flow out. Think rapids and falls. I also prefer tea-colored water. A combination of those characteristics usually means you have found a lake with plenty of slicer walleyes. Next I look at size and protection from prevailing winds. On any 5-7 day trip you're sure to have a day or two with difficult winds and maybe strong enough to keep you in the cabin for a day or two. A lake that provides good fishing regardless of wind is certainly a plus. The third requirement is a lake that matches the equipment you are using, as well as your expertise to avoid rocks, navigate around islands and across open water. Then, of course, there are other items that may or may not be of particular importance. Those include competition from other fishermen, cost, accommodations, natural beauty, distance from home, drive-in vs. fly-in, reputation for larger fish and whether the lake has suffered from a serious burn. Over the years I have developed a stable of lakes that fit most of my requirements. No lake is perfect, but depending on what my companions and I are wanting for the particular trip, I usually can select a lake that fulfills the bill."
6686566,Eckohlt,2022-09-16 17:06:00,3685,Sounds like my kind of trip pounding on some brookies!!
6686582,gordy28,2022-09-16 18:26:00,437,Thanks all. Glad it lines up. I agree re wind impact is a thing as well. When we have done big lakes we have always checked a map to understand what would happen if it really blew. CheersAndrew
6686930,NM_Trout,2022-09-19 11:12:00,1094,"Research on the lakes is great.. if you can get it. I fish small-medium lakes, and they get few visitors each year. My outfitter used to host a forum, but the hassle of spammers grew to be too much. I note that the quality of fishing can change dramatically, and in short fashion. For instance :1) Weather. Really crappy weather puts a huge bind on fishing.2) Forest fires : we had water bombers skimming our lake on one trip, and that seriously spooked the fish. Went from great fishing to horrible fishing for two days. 3) Post-fire conditions : Our favorite lake now has thousands of dead trees that have fallen into it along the shoreline. This has been good and bad, as it gives baitfish a great place to hide, but the predator fish are now around the trees too, and we lost many, many more lures than usual.So much of the above is just out of my control, or ability to negotiate around. I figure it is just part of the overall experience :-)"
