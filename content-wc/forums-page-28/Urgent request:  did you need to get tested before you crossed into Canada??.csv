Have been told that after completing the arriveCAN app, which I have done and have an E ticket, QR code for my Dad and I, that we just need our Covid vaccination cards, Enhanced drivers license, but no longer need a recent covid test like we did last year. Is that correct if everything else is in good standings? It is what I've been told, but when verifying on the Canada Gov sites, it's still difficult to confidently interpret this. There are conflicting statements on the website, and old outdate verbage. Have others been crossing without taking a covid test first from the US most recently? I do understand that they occasionally do a quick test for covid at the border. We are leaving on Tuesday, so need to know ASAP. Thank you!!!!"
