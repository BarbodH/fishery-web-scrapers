6686318,walleyecheek,2022-09-15 11:32:00,2231,I was thinking Virginia Slims !
6686330,Eckohlt,2022-09-15 12:35:00,3685,"They like fat cigs,more smoke and can get a better pull off of it!"
6686434,cuamb,2022-09-16 07:10:00,203,I have written mine down and they seem to like the fact that we have our ducks in a row. It still depends on the agent. But even if I have to pay duty it is reasonable.
6686444,Jesse-WI,2022-09-16 07:32:00,534,"I have had to also have a list once or twice, they just want honest answers to the questions."
6686486,proguidedream,2022-09-16 10:05:00,345,Cdn friends dispise american smokes.. they actually bring smokes from canada to usa on our trips. usually Canadian Classics is their choice brand.. if it wasnt for smokes being less expensive in the states i dont think they would even buy a pack. way up north they probably wont turn down any free smoke tho
6687206,drlee,2022-09-20 17:38:00,409,"OK. First, I simply trust the border folks to shoot straight with me on the duty price. I pay a pretty hefty amount, sometimes around $80 Canadian, but use a credit card to convert to US, which is a good savings, even if you pay a foreign transaction fee. FYI, I use a credit card for everything, groceries, gas, hotel, restaurants. My camps charge American, which is OK with me. Story: Last 2 trips up, I told the border guy what booze I was bringing in. (no duty free) He wrote it down, but did not give me the typical yellow form to take into the station (Pidgeon River) to pay my duty. Went to the counter. Guy said, where is your yellow form? I said, don't know. Did not get one. He said, ""well, where is it?"" I said, sorry, I am confused, and I don't know. He said, ""Well then. I guess you don't owe any duty."" Huh? He said, ""I repeat. You don't owe any duty. Have a good stay in Canada."" My son had previously gotten the same response. I thought he was messin' with me. Guess not. Classy!"
6687210,Eckohlt,2022-09-20 17:45:00,3685,Did the border agent tell you to go inside??
6686010,djglover7,2022-09-13 10:30:00,54,"All,I have read the limits but I am curious about combinations.According to my math...1 750ml of 80 proof (40%) + 1 sixpack (6x12x5%) = 1 Ltr 80 proof.Does that work?"
6686022,stjoeguy,2022-09-13 11:33:00,979,"It might, but it's way too complicated for me. I've never seen a border agent use a calculator. One liter of liquor or one case of beer per person. Anything over and you may have to pay duty, or the usual response if you're slightly over the limit, like 4 guys with 4 liters and a case of beer, is Have a nice visit and you're on your way. It's totally up to the agent whether you pay duty or not. Even if you do it's one of the least expensive parts of the trip."
6686030,David Anderson,2022-09-13 11:53:00,2073,"Exactly, don't over think this. Actually it's 1.14L of hard alcohol, 1 case of beer or 2-.75L of wine. It is not the total combination of alcohol in your possession by volume. As Stjoeguy says, simply tell them what you have as I too have never seen a calculator. When asked I always have a straight forward honest answer as I leave Thursday and will respond...2-.75L bottles of wine, 1-.75L of Whiskey, 1-.75L of Rum for 2 guys. Only once have I had to pay duty in 10 years and that's because the guy driving stumbled on his answer. Still the duty is cheaper than buying in Canada if required. A friend once responded with what they deemed was over the limit, got inspected and they had double, their allowable + what they declared over...not the way to do it. We go up 3 times a year, I would say that 90% we are slightly over and get the same answer, ""have a nice visit"""
6686036,valley366,2022-09-13 12:12:00,193,I would bring the jug of liquor and just stop and buy the beer at the LCBO. The small quantity you discuss the price not a factor. I try keep things as simple as possible when crossing.
6686054,djglover7,2022-09-13 14:51:00,54,"Thanks for all the feedback. I just needed a feel for the tolerance of the border guards.Crossed once where we hesitated in explaining what we had. Yep, got the full probe. We were within limits."
6686100,port1042,2022-09-13 17:59:00,509,"I crossed at Fort Frances on the 2nd. 5 guys in my van. When asked about alcohol I responded: ""2 Cases of beer. A bottle of vodka, a bottle of whiskey, and a bottle of brandy."" ""What size bottles?"", was the response. ""1 liter for the vodka and whiskey. The brandy is a 1.75 liter bottle."" ""Have a good trip!"""
6686268,djglover7,2022-09-15 08:02:00,54,"Good memory. I'm not that fortunate.So, if I have my list written down and pull it up like a tele-prompter, will they laugh or send me to the secondary?"
6686286,DLwalleye,2022-09-15 08:34:00,13,"Numbers sound correct. But, more importantly, bring a carton on cigarettes from the duty free shop. That carton is like a gold bar up North. I don’t smoke, but most of the resorts I’ve stayed at have employees that do. Cigarettes are stupid expensive up North."
6686310,walleyecheek,2022-09-15 11:17:00,2231,Any certain Brand ? (Cigs) LOL.
6686316,Eckohlt,2022-09-15 11:31:00,3685,Probably (Kent).
