6687978,Mr. Sauger,2022-09-24 11:48:00,285,Sometimes the agents ask a question just to read how you answer. Then they ask a valued question and see if your speech pattern/body language was consistent.

6687998,Andre (wallyandre),2022-09-24 16:18:00,2274,I've been ask many times that question when entering in the US
6688028,Lmbkiller,2022-09-24 20:26:00,639,At the border u are actually taking a lie detector test (fart noise)
6688082,Hook_settr,2022-09-25 07:35:00,127,"I think my party has been asked the ""What's everybody do for a living?"" question the last five trips we've made while crossing at Baudette. Just standard operating procedure as far as I'm concerned. I don't mind them asking questions in an effort to keep out nefarious folk. I expect the US side to do the same thing. As far as the ArriveCan app: it seemed easy enough to use this year so we will probably continue to use it."

6688106,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-25 10:56:00,151,"Agreed. In my 20 years of border crossing, it has always been pretty seamless. Until I encounter evidence to the contrary, my impression is they are decent folks doing their job. I think some of their questions are essentially just cordial small talk - I would personally find their jobs pretty darn boring. But perhaps I should line my hat with tin foil, just in case...."
6688144,pony,2022-09-25 17:46:00,19,Once crosing this year I was given a random Covid test kit. It was a nightmare getting it done. I believe they are doing away with that provision.
6688176,Andre (wallyandre),2022-09-25 20:32:00,2274,Last May we were 3 guys cominf back from fishing and the 3 of us had to do the test!!

6687790,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-23 12:44:00,151,"So I'm going to be heading to Ear Falls in early October, after the vax mandates will apparently be dropped and ArriveCAN becomes ""optional"". My question is, at that point, is there any advantage to doing ArriveCAN - will it some expedite my entry?"
6687836,reddemon2,2022-09-23 15:25:00,255,"The agent may ask less questions with the APP, It's a toss up I say, only way to know is to try both"
6687840,walleyecheek,2022-09-23 15:49:00,2231,"Means you can do it ! Or not do it ! ""Optional """
6687842,johnboat,2022-09-23 15:50:00,2014,I'm headed up next week as well. I've decided to go ahead with the ArriveCan as it is easy and quick to do.I'll ask the officer what they prefer and run with that.
6687858,N_of_Quibell,2022-09-23 18:37:00,151,"Makes sense; I'll probably go ahead and do it on the hope that it gives them some information they need without having to ask for it. As you say, it's easy to do and it's hard to see any particular downside. I have the impression when they enter your passport number it automatically links with ArriveCAN."
6687896,eyecatcher1,2022-09-24 06:59:00,323,"I went through IF on August 27. He never asked for our hard copies of anything like they did last year. My wife asked why and he said that when he swiped our licenses it told him everything that was entered on the app. He asked us very few questions too. Any bait, alcohol and have a nice trip."
6687934,Bakefish,2022-09-24 09:01:00,1077,We had an agent ask us what we did for a living. I said we're retired. He asked what we did when we worked and how long we've known each other. You never know what questions will be asked and for what reason.
6687952,7 Mag,2022-09-24 09:56:00,1887,"I went through on the 27th as well, pretty much the same questions. Like Bakefish I was asked what I did for living which I thought was odd."
6687966,eyecatcher1,2022-09-24 11:35:00,323,"Years ago when I was still working they said this was my third trip this year so what did I do for a living. 6 years ago when I pulled up to the window the guy said "" I see that you have a new truck since last year."" They seem to know everything once they have your passport of license."
6687972,Obabikon,2022-09-24 11:38:00,2370,"So, if you do it... it will save you a couple minutes at the border. The guard has to ask you certain questions. Many of those are answered with the arrivecan app. So, it basically eliminates him having to enter your answers into the computer."
