6687030,HeHooksHimself,2022-09-19 20:50:00,725,"Henry, I am not sure I can really add anything to the original post. Small walleye, random pike, could possibly find a crappie. Rock bass everywhere. Lots of traffic for a like the size of Birch. In 2021 we went to LaTourelle's on Moose Lake. Much better than Birch Lake, but still not Canada (But you can see Canada from there.) Hooks"
6687100,maddogg,2022-09-20 08:24:00,178,We fished this lake one time for a week. And that was one time too many.
6476922,HeHooksHimself,2020-08-23 07:10:00,725,"Yeah yeah, I know this is a Canada Forum, but I promised to put up a report for our alternative trip. We still have our reservation at Wildewood- Savant Lake for September but we all know that won't happen. By the way, we have not heard anything from Wildewood but a month or so ago they said they would carry over our deposits to next year. Which is good since their deposits are a hefty 5 hundo a person! So, we shopped the internet looking for an alternative and landed on River Point Resort on Birch Lake. First, a little about River Point Resort. It is an upscale resort targeting families and romantic getaways. I am sure we had a negative impact on a few peoples' vacations with our early morning departures, poker games on the porch and indiscriminate belching a gas passing as we went about our fishing trip routine. The resort is very clean and well equipped and it is also very large. Jane, the resort owner, suggested a villa for us but it was a bad choice simply because it was right in the middle of the most busy place. Perhaps she wanted to keep an eye on us and she did since it was right next to the resort office and we were inundated with people driving in and out and office traffic. Our villa was in a single building with two other villas and when we moved in there was a family above us with baby (loud crying) and a toddler. The people were nice enough but are from a culture that requires a high volume for communication. They left after few days and things quieted down. I would not recommend a villa for a fishing trip, but I am considering returning before the snow flies for a cabin getaway with the Mrs. Our trip cost us over a grand apiece including the boat rental, gas (none included) and other essentials. Be sure if you rent a boat you reserve the right to pick out your boat. With our prearrival rental they stuck us with the oldest boat and motor and we ended up having to switch out for the last day since there were motor issues. The newer boat was way better... We talked with a dock attendant the first day and during the discussion we were talking about walleye. I suggested we should be able to catch a few eaters, which for us is typically a 16 incher and he suggested we lower our standards. He was right, we had enough walleye to eat but the biggest one we caught was a hair over 14 inches. We probably caught about 20 walleye through the week. The first fish that was caught was a smallie 13.5"". We like catching smallies and thought that would be great but that was the only one we saw. I caught a 28,5"" pike with a worm harness, but other than two other small pike in Bob's bay we saw no other pike. An exciting moment there as I was dangling my lure near the water determining my next cast when a pike literally jumped out of the water and hooked himself. The crappie were supposedly biting but we only caught two. What we did catch a crapload of was an anomaly called the rock bass. We probably caught a hundred of these things and tried to eat a couple. The problem with eating rock bass is that it is hard to get any meat off of them. They are pretty bloody and have large scales. We tried some lures, bought some minnows in Ely, and caught a few on plastics. However our go to bait was crawlers on a jig, leaving a tail hanging. The lake seemed very busy to us, even though, in a conversation with another guest, I was told the great thing about Birch Lake was the lack of boat traffic. There is another resort that offers houseboats and there were always at least ten houseboats tooling around at all times. We were able to find isolated spots most of the time, but we were never out of site of others. There are many cabins and large lakehouses around the lake. We never made it the the western part of the lake since we didn't trust the motor. To conclude, Birch Lake ain't Canada. I am glad we want, but will probably look elsewhere if we are stuck in the same situation next year (which I doubt). PM if you have specific questions. Fish On! Hooks"
6476928,prov1800,2020-08-23 07:50:00,5010,Thx for that report.I thank my lucky stars in live in Canada.Ive had many guys i know tell me about there trips south of the border and they sound more or less like yours.Hopefully next year will be different.
6476932,Bill Krejca,2020-08-23 08:20:00,6107,"Thanks for the report. I considered Birch as a fall Canada alternative. The lake, looking more like a wide dammed up river, looked interesting, but it seemed to lack much depth, and that removed it from my list of choices. Seems like so many of the water bodies which offer house boats can end up getting overcrowded, huge water systems not so much. Settled on Kab, then ended up having little interest from friends, looks like a no-go for now. Bill"
6477050,DavKin,2020-08-23 19:06:00,104,Thanks for the report Hooks. We will be at Timber Bay the last week of Sept. I'll temper my expectations.
6477084,rather-be-fishin,2020-08-23 21:40:00,429,"Hooks, Thanks for the report on Birch. We also went to Birch Lake 7/20 to 7/24, when we couldn’t go to Lac Seul for our 17th year. We stayed at Timber Bay near Babbit on the opposite end of the lake. Fishing had pretty much shut down after the hot weather prior to our arrival. We caught 8 fish total in 3 days... 1 perch, 4 walleyes, 2 Northern & a Rock Bass (which we call “Eagle Food”). Nothing of any size. We had lowered our expectations before going, but this was worse than expected. Since Very HOT & HUMID weather was moving in, we even packed up early & went home to our air conditioned house. For the person going to Timber Bay end of September, I hope the fishing will have improved by then. I also have heard that Kabetogama lake fishing has been slow too. Plan to try Lake Vermilion this next weekend when my son & daughter-in-law come home for a visit from Phoenix. I am hoping & praying that the border will be open by next summer, so we can return to the “Walleye factory”. RBF"
6477160,tparker,2020-08-24 07:41:00,100,"Thanks for the report. Our alternate trip is next week on the Turtle Flambeau Flowage in northern Wisconsin. We've never been there, but really looking forward to getting away for a few days. We know it's not Ontario, but should be fun."
6477172,Ltrain,2020-08-24 08:30:00,4145,"Be safe on that system, thousands of stumps just below water level. Have a map chip with the old channel highlighted on it and stay in it, when you venture outside it, trim up and use your trolling motor. Even in the channel do not run wide open. I was told by an old-timer that only 2 types of people run wot there, 30 year veterans of the lake and newcomers about to meet their impending doom. It can be that dangerous of a waterway. Now all that aside it is beautiful up there, walleyes run on the small side as there is no minimum size limit and i seen people keeping perch sized walleyes. There is nice smallies ,pike and muskies too. Check out the Gile flowage 20 miles north if you get a chance, that's a fun place to fish too. Please post a report when you return. Good luck."
6477456,tparker,2020-08-25 07:31:00,100,Thanks Itrain. Will do.
6686966,HenryEvery,2022-09-19 14:03:00,1,"Was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the lake? Our party will consist of my wife, my widowed mother-in-law, and 12 year old daughter. I am looking at Crawfords on LOTW and Birch Lake both very hard. We won't need anything crazy. Just a few eye's or pike for a fish fry or two. Will be taking our own boat (20ft Alaskan Lund)"
