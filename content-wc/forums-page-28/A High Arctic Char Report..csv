The north has a lot of char species: Dolly Varden, Lake Trout an Brook Trout. The Baffin char we've caught had big pink spots and also seen that in Alaska. NH has a nearly extinct Sunapee Trout and Maine has the blueback. One Western Alaska river the Togiak had a July-Aug run of Dolly and resident population of Arctic Char along with Lake Trout. We ran into a team of biologists who clarified the Dolly's an char's. Thank you, I appreciate the note on the red coloration and glad to hear you plan on going back."

The right light with photos can surely make those oranges and reds pop too. I give a little extra in the darkroom later. Thanks for reading all.
6687012,Moosebunk,2022-09-19 18:41:00,211,"Combining work with this insane want to fish summer's Arctic char often requires a ton of planning and plenty of luck. It's never once been a given to just show up in Nunavut and have all things laid out just right for the fishing. Timing is everything, location key, experience golden and confidence a must but still, the monkey wrenches that got thrown into all my big plans were seemingly too much this time around. But yet in the end, having the stars align for just that one right chance, it made for an experience never to be forgotten. Char fishing is the culmination of entirely who I am and what I do for a living, there are few fish that give me the same rush. Blessed to have worked a long time and find a job that allows for such amazing fishing opportunities in the Arctic. Link on in here for some northern exposure. Thanks for reading!

6687146,Whopper,2022-09-20 13:30:00,340,Another amazing read. This one touched multiple subjects beside fishing and a bonus trip to boot. Thanks so much for sharing Andrew!

6687244,vteye3,2022-09-20 20:01:00,496,"Bunk - Great report like usual, a unique, unappreciated game fish. What time of year are you catching the red ones? I noticed varying degrees of red. Decades ago we targeted them miles down a fiord by casting into salt water, low tide being prime. We caught them in late July by the dozens. We had traveled dozens of miles out of ""Pang"" but only one i remember had half as much red as yours recently. Char caught in Alaska have also been beautiful colorful fish (big pink spots) again with only one bright red/orange coloration. Cool species combining char/trout/salmon characteristics. Have you considered an Alaskan float targeting char? You are fortunate to be able to target char while doing contract work. Although this past contract period has me wondering if you will return to that community? Enjoy your reports."
6687290,Moosebunk,2022-09-21 06:14:00,211,"Thanks for reading allAlways August for red char. But you will not find them closer to the ocean but rather in the lakes or rivers. They've either returned early and had time to color up or, they are holdovers that didn't leave the freshwater to feed out in the ocean that season. By September the likelihood of the red char feeding is drastically reduced, they'll have spawning on their minds. They shut down after spawn and don't eat much or at all until late spring. Have looked at Alaska yes, those are Dolly Varden out there if they're the ones with pink spots. True strain char have white, there are places where the two share genetics such as the Tree River. I will return to the community. The fishing is worth the headaches for the short term. Again all, thanks for reading."
