6680104,troutcatcher,2022-08-17 22:50:00,44,"Gas prices and inflation don't help. Specially if its familys that go on a trip to Canada from United States because all the cost comes from one household compared if you have a group of guys that go and share the expense. I think the other reason is the mandatory covid vaccine to cross the border. Many familys one or both parents arn't vaccinated or have their kids vaccinated , so there not gonna go. My family made the trip 19 straight years before covid and we won't be making the trip to Canada unless they get rid of mandatory covid shot. I personally know 4 other familys that are doing the same thing. My parents went up to Ignace to fish for two weeks end of July this summer . They said the boat landings and fishing camps were way down in numbers ."

Three things: 1) Interest in fishing and hunting, as reflected in license sales, has been in serious decline for years now, for whatever reasons, 2) The middle class with disposal income has shrunk considerably over the past few decades, 3) Us older folks (boomers) with disposal income are rapidly aging out - the last census showed the most rapidly growing age class is >65+.

6680182,SJC305,2022-08-18 08:33:00,154,"Agree on combination of issues. I'm headed up to the Longlac area next weekend for our annual trip after two years, but out partner boat isn't going because of vax requirements. The next issue we had was the place we had stayed at for the past 20 years sold/closed over the pandemic shut-downs and we had to find a new place. My family members are also getting older and it's not as easy for them as it use to be. But they got the Walleye addiction into me early enough that I went and bought a new Lund that can take everyone and and have be as the younger body taking on more responsibility. Gas prices are a bit higher, but I don't feel like it's as big an issue of extra cost. Our trip to Devil's Lake ND last year will still likely cost more then heading North for a week. While we know the area we fish/stay, it has began to feel like having to start over. Finding new lodging, BMZ bait dealers etc.... versus what it was before... of going year over to the same place and routine."
6680190,jackpotjohnny48,2022-08-18 08:47:00,153,"I think it's a combination of reasons, the two biggest being...1. The COVID VAX requirement2. Incredibly high gas prices (and the resulting inflation).With respect to the COVID VAX, 4 out of 5 of the guys in our fishing group chose NOT to get the vax. So that disqualifies 80% of us right off the bat. The one guy in our group who actually DID get the vax happens to be legally blind, so he relies on the rest of us to do the driving when we go to Canada. And since the other 4 of us can't go, he (the legally blind guy) obviously can't go either, unless he can find another group to tag along with and do the driving for him.And with respect to gas prices, that certainly doesn't help either. Not only does this make a trip more expensive when driving your car from the U.S. to Canada, but it makes the boat gas considerably more expensive as well. For example, I've stayed at Pipestone Lake the last couple of times going into Canada. That's about a 6 mile boat ride up Clearwater Lake to the railroad portage. Then it's another 15 to 20 miles to the outpost cabin in the northwest arm. And all that gas, in a remote location is quite expensive even in a NORMAL year. This year, I'm imagining the gas costs will be off the charts up there.So, I'm personally in the same boat as a previous poster.I did not receive the vax, and so I won't be going to Canada unless and until the vax requirement is lifted. And I have taken approximately 40 trips to Canada over the past 33 years (Been going every year since 1989, and some years we went twice. But obviously haven't been there since 2019).I decided to go fishing at Snowbank Lake in Ely, MN this year, and just returned from that trip 5 days ago. Really enjoyed the Ely area, and plan to go back there next year, since I don't think the vax mandate will be lifted any time soon, and the fishing in Ely was pretty good, once we figured out the pattern.Having said that, the gas prices at Snowbank were $6.50 per gallon, so I can only imagine how expensive the prices were on the Pipestone / Clearwater chain in Emo.So, I think that those are the two biggest factors that kept most people from going to Canada.The vax requirement and the gas prices / inflation.Speaking only for myself and my group, we definitely would have gone, even with the higher gas prices, as the yearly (or sometimes twice yearly) trips to Canada are a long established tradition that we really would like to continue.But for our (mostly unvaxxed) group, the vaccine requirement has been the PRIMARY deal breaker. Had it not been for the VAX requirement, we would have gone back to Pipestone this year, even with the much higher gas prices. We may have had to work a bit of overtime to budget for the inflated gas prices, but we would have found a way. But the vax mandate was the one thing that made us look at other fishing options inside the USA.So we're planning to go back to Ely, MN again next summer (along with a trip to Michigan's Upper Peninsula as well).""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6680220,C182P,2022-08-18 11:59:00,59,"As a lifelong year-round resident on Lake Vermilion in northern MN, I can tell you the numbers of fishermen and boats in general on the lake were off the charts in the 2 previous lock down years 20 and 21. Resorts had all time record years for business. My son is also a fishing guide on the lake and many many of the parties he guided in 20 and 21, and now even in 22, are ""former"" Canadian fishing trip groups. Is the fishing as good here - NOPE, not even close. But with a knowledgeable guide there are fish to be had, closer, and without a VAX requirement. Canada can do as they please and I jump through the hoops to go there and will generally continue to do so within reason, BUT the VAX requirement is having a real impact on fishing and hunting tourism to Canada and will continue to do so. I know many people that have quit going on their fishing and hunting expeditions to Canada because of it. Just the facts. Tight lines!"
6680430,Billswest,2022-08-19 09:55:00,32,"Six of us traveled to north of Kenora in June to fish Nance Lake. Two in their 60's, 2 late 30's, and 2 teens. All were vaxed, and since it was our choice we wouldn't have had it any other way. Felt good to know we were safe, and even better to know we weren't going to pass the bug on to more vulnerable folks...elderly, kids, immuno-compromised folks that we might've encountered along the way. Fishing was great the entire 10 days we were up there. We'll continue to support these local economies and outfitters, even with the vac. reqmt. Respect to those who who think otherwise, but for us the decision to get poked was a simple one. Had to get it if we wanted to fish waters which are pretty much unparalleled to any you're going to find in the states."
6680448,guidedfishing,2022-08-19 11:07:00,531,"Ok. First I am vaxed and boosted and certainly not anti-jab. I am all for it being your own choice. Now at the risk of getting this thread axed. I will ask what do you mean it ""felt good to know we are safe""? You certainly are not safe from getting Covid that ship and myth has long since sailed and been debunked. As far as passing it to vulnerable folks. unless you are testing daily you have no idea if your are a carrier or not vaxed or unvaxed. What you may of accomplished by being vaxed is lessening the severity if you do develop symptoms. Sorry so much of what you just said is yesterdays propaganda. And if you believe that and are unaware you are far more dangerous to the general public than you realize. You have no super immunity being vaxed. So back on track. In my multiple trips to Ontario, both camping , cabins, and resorts my observation was almost no one was present in traditional crown land camping spots. Maybe 10% of normal, Cabins and resorts were have been running at about 60% of occupancy. Any given week is fluctuates but overall. The groups that are coming are generally smaller than usual. This is not just fisherman but bear hunters. Those of us that truly love to fish and make it a priority find a way to get it done. I don't buy gas prices on their own they have been high before but over all inflation is impacting some folks, couple this with vaccinations, the thought of a possible random test it is enough in some folks mind to just not make the effort. So when you see the vaccination rates in Wisconsin for example hovering around 63-65% for both shots, and other states similar its not hard to do the math and understand why business appears to be off by 40%. As some resorts fail or don't open what business they may of had would shift to others and give the appearance they may be running at a higher rate than 60%. But those numbers will flush out in the end. As the Boomers and older half of Gen X tails off, us kids that grew up being outside, and not on a video game will further impact the available pool of fisherman and hunters. Sure I enjoy the lack of boats and fisherman, but there really was never that many to begin with over the last 40 + years. Know that maintaining the resources and keeping them available really depends on our young folks wanting to use them. It is concerning on what the future availability may look like for young fisherman that discover the beauty and solitude of the northern lakes."
6680450,combine_billy,2022-08-19 11:08:00,151,"If there is one thing that is absolutely true is that getting the vax does not stop you from getting the bug or from giving the bug. The CDC is finally coming clean on some of their poor advice. I got the shot for the sole purpose of getting across the border. It was worth it to me, but for some it is not."
6680462,Spurgery,2022-08-19 11:59:00,79,"To each their own and I also decided to get the jab, mainly to be able to cross the border. However, as time has passed it’s obvious that the current mandate doesn’t hold much water. It’s proven that the vax doesn’t stop transmission of the disease. The JJ shot has been proven the be the least effective yet one can legally cross the border after receiving a single dose of the JJ or two of one of the others a year and half ago. At some point common sense should be to either drop the mandate or require a booster. I hope the former because it’s costing lodge owners serious money and requiring it to cross the border for a week in mostly isolated fishing lodges doesn’t make much sense but not much has the last couple years once politicians and big government get involved."
6680476,farmnfish,2022-08-19 12:35:00,130,"In the boat with many others that have posted, went nearly every year with friends and family, now none of us are going. All hinging on the vac mandate. I've had covid, the day and a half variety, and have immunity as good or better than anyone. But, ...."
6680484,C&K,2022-08-19 12:57:00,492,"Only about maybe half or so of US people got corona vaccine, and that's mostly in the bigger cities where they get 65-70% or so. In this county, and in many of the more rural areas where your former customers came from, they only got about 14% that got the vaccine. And nationwide they got way less than that went back and got all their ""booster shots"". People figured out the stuff don't work and it was a big scam perpetrated by politicians that own stock in pharma companies involved. So you can figure your Canadian business is gonna be down by the same percentages. And even if they do away with the border vaccine thing, you're still not gonna get 'em back. After Canada went totally overboard with all this stuff many have found other places to go and decided Canada is no longer worth the hassle. So the bottom line is, you simply lost about half your customers. And getting 'em back is not gonna happen anytime soon, if ever. Gas prices don't even play a role in it. That hasn't cut down the amount of traffic on the road down here at all, nor cut into the mass migration we get from Twin Cities area on holiday weekends."
6680516,v-bay gord,2022-08-19 14:16:00,3168,"The bottom line is none of my customers have complained about seeing less boats on the lake, nor are they about the great fishing that seems to be a byproduct of less people. As the Twin Cities holiday traffic gets worse every year, that solitude, wilderness and great fishing just north of the border might be hard to ignore. Just a thought."

6680522,jackpotjohnny48,2022-08-19 15:14:00,153,"I would tend to agree with you on two of your points. 1. The VAX requirement was a deal breaker for quite a few people. As I mentioned in a previous post, it was definitely a deal breaker for our particular group. And none of us is going back to Canada unless and until the vax requirement is lifted. 2. Many of the resorts may have permanently lost some of their customers, even if the vaccine requirement is lifted. If if the vax requirement is terminated, it may be a case of ""too little, too late,"" as a lot of us have found other fishing destinations, closer to home, in the USA. I had never intended to spend much time fishing in Michigan's Upper Peninsula or in the Ely, MN area, but when the Canadian border closed in 2019 and has continued to remain closed to those of us who are not vaxxed, our group started to search for other options within the US. And much to our surprise, we found some incredibly good options right in our own backyard. As an example, on one of our remote places in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, we had a day 2 years ago where our boat caught and released northern pike of 42 inches, 40 inches, 39 inches, and 35 inches all in the same day. And my friend just returned from a quick one-day trip to the U.P. where he caught pike of 42 inches, 38 inches, and 2 additional 35-inchers from that particular spot. That may not be as impressive as Wollaston Lake in Saskatchewan, but it's better than anything we've ever experienced in Ontario as far as trophy pike are concerned. (Admittedly, we don't generally target pike when we fish in Ontario. Most of our pike have been accidental hammer handles that hit our musky baits). And on our recent trip to Ely, MN, we did quite well on the walleyes, and I fell in love with the Ely area in general. (Ely is definitely on my top 10 list of places I might want to retire to). So next year, I already have my Upper Peninsula Michigan trip booked for July 12, and I plan to go back to Minnesota again next August. I'm thinking about a return trip to Snowbank Lake, or maybe Moose Lake / Basswood Lake. I've also heard some great things about the eastern side of the BWCA near Grand Marais and the Gunflint trail. (Saganaga is apparently pretty spectacular). So when Canada became unavailable to our group in 2020, it forced us to research a lot of other options. And we've been pleasantly surprised to find that there's a heck of a lot of terrific water in the USA, if you're willing to spend your time looking for it. Lots of options to explore, quite a bit of it is remote and beautiful (plenty of loons and scenery), and the fishing surprised us by being better than we had anticipated. So I personally am not in a super huge hurry to return to Canada. My guess is I'll be booking my August 2023 trip to northern Minnesota / BWCA sometime in the next couple of weeks (As soon as I decide where exactly I want to go). And so even if the vax mandate would be lifted in January 2023, it would be too late for it to really matter to me, as all of my 2023 trips will already be booked by then, a July trip to Michigan, and an August trip to Minnesota. This doesn't really leave me much time for Canada. So the very earliest I see myself returning to Canada would be 2024, assuming that the vax mandate is terminated. But even then, I may not necessarily be in a hurry to go back to Canada, because the ""Plan B"" alternatives that I've found in the United States have shown us some incredible fishing, to the point where they may just change into our new ""Plan A.""

6680250,C182P,2022-08-18 13:20:00,59,"Even the sub 25 hp lakes like Trout Lake off the NE side of Vermilion have seen a boom in usage. As a selfish ""local"" I'm not overly fond of the increased crowds and pressure on the lakes, but its great for the local economy. The fishing pressure in 20 and 21 brought a noticeable decrease in size of the average walleye in Vermilion, but this years pressure is far less and it seems like the ration of little to decent fish is on the upswing. I'm heading to Canada tomorrow because I like catching and not fishing. I don't bring any fish home from Canada since all I want to eat can be had fresh off the end of my dock at home. Best of both worlds I guess. Now to upload some new Covid cards and passport info to ArriveCan. I won't be disappointed if that goes away."

He also said only one group of 4 all in their 30's was the only group not aged 60 through 90. Afraid we are a dying breed. Been going up since 1974 and not seen many young clients except those that were related to the older guys that had been fishing in Canada for decades.

6680320,Skis,2022-08-18 20:10:00,1523,"I think the ability to fish in the US and not having to 1) be vaccinated and 2) need to have proof of this is a big factor. This coupled with my opinion that many fishermen/outdoorsmen don't want/wont get vaccinated leaves most US fisherman in the US. I gave up my $500 deposit on Lac Seul this year (was supposed to go in 2020 already) because it was my choice not to get the shot. And I know they need the $500 more than me. Can only imagine what it's been like as a resort owner in Canada since 2020. And just so everyone knows, I did have COVID in September, 2020, and it was a long week in my life. But I'll be ****ed if I'm getting forced to take a shot just to fish in Canada. I have never had a flu shot, so why is the COVID vaccine any different? I'll let my body's immunities fight my battles. And then our president is now a glowing example of how well the vaccine works!!I contacted our lodge in Canada and I am truly hopeful that I am up there in 2023. My youngest son graduated HS this past summer and his graduation gift from us is a fishing trip to Lac Seul. The resort owners agree with my thoughts that there won't be the current requirements in place next summer. They have to be right, or many resorts in Canada will be out of business."

6680236,jackpotjohnny48,2022-08-18 12:52:00,153,"Yup. I've noticed when I was in northern Minnesota, I stopped and talked to several outfitters / Lodge owners in the Ely, MN area this year, as well as resort owners and outfitters on our trip to the Walker / Park Rapids area of MN last year. Resort business is definitely BOOMING in northern MN the past couple of years, due to the fact that there are so many people (like myself and my group), that are not going to Canada because of the vax requirement, and so we've started looking at places in Minnesota and Michigan as sort of a ""Plan B."" So that's one reason I chose Snowbank Lake. Given the fact that it is partially in the boundary waters, there is a 25 horsepower limit on the BWCA portion of the lake. And that was nice for us, because we knew that the horsepower limitation would cause other groups to want to take their high horsepower boats somewhere else. (Somewhere more crowded in northern MN). So for us, we got the best of both worlds in Ely. We got to avoid the large (high horsepower) crowds in Walker, MN or Rainy Lake. (We rented a camp boat with a 25 HP engine) But we still got to go to an ultra beautiful, ""Canadian Shield type"" lake without having to be vaxxed. So I was real pleased with the trip to Ely, and plan to probably go back there next year. But I've seen firsthand that many of the places in northern Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula are WAY MORE CROWDED than they would normally be, if the vax requirement weren't in place, obviously since many of the unvaxxed crowd (such as my group) is using MN and MI as ""Plan B."" Fortunately, our group has chosen places like Snowbank (partially in the BWCA), where the 25 HP limit tends to keep the large crowds at bay. Or, we've been fortunate to find some places in Michigan's Upper Peninsula that can only be accessed via canoe portage, and where the fishing for trophy pike is really spectacular. So we've definitely encountered some rather large crowds in northern MN and northern MI in the past couple of years (the ""former Canada fisherman""), and we've had to get somewhat off the beaten path in Minnesota and Michigan to minimize the crowds. As the people at Snowbank told me last week, ""It's definitely a good time to be a resort owner in northern Minnesota."" ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
