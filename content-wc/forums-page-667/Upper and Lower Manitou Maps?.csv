563224,Guest,2007-02-06 12:36:00,0,"We go up to Camp Manitou each of the last few years and the camp has a master map that the guides have made with rocks and reefs marked on it. There are no depth maps for either lake. Go to campmanitoufishing.net and e-mail Matt, maybe he can help you out with a copy of their map."

Way too many reefs and rocks. Go slow and enjoy. I know my area know and still bump rocks. Be Careful. good smallmouth, pike, lakers, and muskie. Clear water lots of muskie follows but not too many in the net. No walleye so not too many fishermen. I love the place and will be there 3 times this year . god bless eric macdonald"

563281,Guest,2007-02-09 06:08:00,0,"I stay at camp beaverhead (private). There are huge muskie there but difficult. Biggest in our camp over the past 8 years is 54 inch. My biggest is 48, but you should have seen the one that got away. Fishing is like anything else, some weeks 7 or 8 in the net, some weeks none. Large body of water, clear so lots of follows. good luck Eric"
563283,Guest,2007-02-09 07:59:00,0,"I have to say all the comments are true, cause I do some guiding on that body of water in my freelance guiding service. Huge muskie, awesome lake trout there is also action all day for large and smallmouth bass. Almost forgot to mention the pike action, any and every weed bed has them. Many differrnt portage lakes, one just being 30 ft. apart. Long ride though from landing out to bottom of lower manitou. Best of luck to anyone who goes there."
