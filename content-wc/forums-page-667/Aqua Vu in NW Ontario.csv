They had used an Aqua Vu camera to show all kinds of Walleyes on the bottom of the river. The view was pretty good. I'm curious if anyone has ever used and Aqua Vu up there in a typical tanin stained system, and what did you think of it. I thought about buying one, but wouldn't if I can't see anything with it. Thanks in advance."

563241,Guest,2007-02-07 18:34:00,0,"Stehle, DO NOT buy an Aqua Vu, if you're planning to use it in stained water. Clear water, yes. Stained water, definately not. NWO Fishing Bum"

563245,Guest,2007-02-07 20:00:00,0,"not for lac seul, that's for sure."
563248,Stehle,2007-02-07 22:26:00,95,"Thanks Guys, you just saved me some cash. Well, maybe not, there is this rod and reel combo that I can put the money toward. I really appreciate the input. My second use for this thing would've been in my home waters....the Ohio River. If you think the waters in NW Ontario are dark, you haven't seen anything like the silty Ohio. I will say that the Zebra mussles have cleaned it up quite a bit in the last 10 years. You can now see about 3 feet down. Anyway, I'm sure that I'll buy some sort of gizmo, lure, tackle bag, or whatever for my June pilgrimage. Actually, it might be a new digital camera for all of the wonderful scenery. I swear to God that that place absolutely recharges my batteries with how it looks, feels, and fishes, and the only way to remember it proper is with good pix. You've all been a great help. Thanks a bunch."
563254,Guest,2007-02-08 08:07:00,0,"here is an interesting thing. we have not brought an aqua vu up but have brought a mask and snorkel. on a sunny day, you could see 20ft in water 10feet deep and less on the surface and on the bottom."

And everyone knows how stained the water is at times..........maybe only the pro's know how to work them right........if they work here they should work anywhere. I seen sturgeon, suckers, walleyes and it seemed I could see for atleast 10-15 ft."
