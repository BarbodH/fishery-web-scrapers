563114,Cliff_30,2007-01-31 12:06:00,1,I will be heading up to Manotak Lodge in late June this year. Looking for opinions on this place - good or bad.

563161,Guest,2007-02-02 15:25:00,0,were there a long time ago but it was HORRIBLE!!!! that was withthe old owners though. people in that area call it the dead sea---bad fishing my friend. accomodations were nice though.
563175,Oldschool,2007-02-04 12:26:00,163,"Cliff_30, I have not stayed there. I do know that the previours owners were notorious, but the new ones have done a good job. I have spent many different weeks on the lake, Perrault, and do know firsthand of the fishing. It is a beatiful, safe lake, that has a couple of small connected lakes via a small river. It also connects very nicely and easily to Cedar Lake. Perrault gets to about 85-90 feet in maximum depth and is mostly a round type lake. I don't believe that the fishing is very good as compared to many other lakes in the area. It is a pretty heavily pressured lake with several camps on it. Although it does have walleyes and northerns, I believe that the smallmouth are probably the easiest to find throughout the year. I like the lake, but it is difficult to go there and expect easy catches. Hope this helps. Roy"

There are a lot of cheaper resorts in the area, or even on Perrault Lake if you don't require that much pampering. I had heard last summer that the current owners were considering selling, but haven't heard anything more since. Perrault can be good fishing, but it can pretty much go dead at times due the combinations of weather conditions and the previously mentioned topography of the lake. Depending on what your skill level is, it isn't going to produce as easily as some other lakes in the area. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
