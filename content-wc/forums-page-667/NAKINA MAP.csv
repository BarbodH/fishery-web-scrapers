I contacted the publisher and was informed they no longer publish these maps. I want the map showing areas North of Nakina. New or used, makes no difference. E-mail if you can help, [email protected]. Thanks"

563203,Greg @ ABL,2007-02-05 14:15:00,23,"Fishoil is correct. Skinners does have maps of all those areas. I purchased some from him last summer, and they are pretty good maps. They break up into multiple areas and you can purchase the maps that interest you. All the best, Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944"
