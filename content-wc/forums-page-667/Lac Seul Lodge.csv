563173,Pikeslayer,2007-02-03 21:33:00,3,"Lac Seul is a good lake to fish, but it's very big....and quite shallow in places.....when the wind comes up it can whip up some pretty big white caps. Gullrock and Red Lake is located 50 miles up the highway from Lac Seul and has many sheltered bays etc. where the wind won't bother you as much. I've fished both bodies of water and I prefer Gullrock/Red Lake. That's my 2 cents worth! *** Everybody needs to believe in something - I believe I'll have another beer. *** :cheers:"
563214,Guest,2007-02-05 22:22:00,0,"Your statistic of 38 fish per person at SWWL is incorrect as that number only includes fish 18 inches and larger. They do not write down the ones under 18"" so that number would in fact be much higher. D"

But I agree the number would be higher. My experience at SWWL (5 times) tells me that the number could be as much as 20% to 40% higher. Lac Seul is awesome and good numbers are very common. Best day I have ever had with three of us in boat was 328 Walleyes in about 9 hours. Also had days when three of us caught a total of 60 or less."
562974,2746,2007-01-24 22:54:00,3206,"I belive prov1900 is right about Lac Seul, however, if you want excellent fishing and a somewhat smaller body of water you could consider Gullrock which is just a few more miles up the road. It's one of the few lakes that rival Lac Seul as to quality of fishing but is considerably smaller and relatively easy to fish. A very good place to be introduced to Canadian walleye fishing."
562978,wiswalleye,2007-01-25 13:28:00,62,Played the Ear Falls golf course last July. Of course it was hot and dry but overall it is a fairly decent course. We played it just to say we had played golf in Canada.
562983,Guest,2007-01-25 20:07:00,0,"The Ear Falls golf course is a 9 holer. Nothing wrong with it. It's carved out of the bush, lots of trees, water, elevation changes around the creek. The golf course road branches off of a road that takes you to the boat launch that will take you to below the hydro dam. Great fishing below the falls. ""U TUBE"" Ear Falls and you'll see exactly where to fish....... Up the road 72 km is the ""most northern course in Ontario"", is whate way the sign says, and it's a good 18 hole course. It's in Balmertown. Like anywhere else around there are usually lots of sand flies and mosquitos. Greg"
563007,2746,2007-01-26 14:37:00,3206,"Thanks Greg. We've played the Red Lake/Balmertown course several times over the years. Last summer saw an adult bear on 18....slowely walked across the fareway and over to #9 with lots of shouts of ""Bear on the course"". He was in no hurry! I've seen Elk and Deer while golfing but this was the first bear. Kind of exciting for an old guy from Iowa."
563008,Kansaseye,2007-01-26 15:52:00,6,"The lake is huge but you don't have to fish the whole thing. Each year I try to explore new territory as well as hitting my favorite spots. If you do explore new water, remember, you are on Lac Seul so keep your eyes open and watch your depth finder. Pelicans that appear to be standing on water is usually a bad sign. Rocks and reefs can be where you least expect it. As far as fishing at night, I would avoid it for the reasons mentioned above as well as you will become the evening feast for the mosquito population. The fishing during the day should be good enough that you will need to rest at night. Kansaseye"
563009,Hump,2007-01-26 16:41:00,578,"Has anyone else noticed that the walleyes don't hit real early in the morning, but start about 8:30?"
563011,Guest,2007-01-26 19:42:00,0,How bad are the mosquoitos? I hear the black flies will bite too! What part of Lac Suel should I consider. I see the Silver Water Wheel Reports and find the numner of walleye's hard to believe. Any of you use bottmo bouncers with spinners?
563055,Kansaseye,2007-01-29 13:50:00,6,"The mosquitos aren't bad until dusk. When the sun starts to go down you will want to be in your cabin. There are lots of community spots near Lac Seul Lodge to fish. McKenzie Bay - around all the islands and of course, the big & little sandbanks. Manitoba Point, Ghost Narrows, and The Bay of Islands can all be good. The best place to fish is the one you find on your own - you will appreciate it more. Believe the numbers from Silver Water Wheel! They have no reason to stretch the truth as I think they are booked 2-3 years in advance. I have used bottom bouncers with spinners but prefer to use inline weights instead of the bottom bouncers. Just personal preferance. A lot of people on Lac Seul use both of these methods but my real favorite is a jig. A jig & minnow, jig & crawler, jig & leech, jig & twister tail - you get the idea. Kansaseye"

If you do the math with the numbers he has for 2005 each fisherman is catching 38 Walleyes per day. That is no more than an average day on lac Seul. last year I read about one group on Lac Seul that averaged 87 Walleye per day per man...that is hard to believe...but possible...but 38 is easy to believe.
563081,Guest,2007-01-30 10:50:00,0,"Lac Seul fishes small, exactly what the previous posts said. It is loaded with small bays, islands and out-of the way places that if you find on your own, that makes the whole experience even better. Our group looks for new spots to explore every year, and when they pay off, it's even better. There are the normal hot spots, but you get to share them with all of your best friends you haven't met yet. Watch the wind, your depth finder, birds, and trust your instincts, fish are everywhere."
562946,2746,2007-01-23 18:29:00,3206,"Can anyone share their experiences with Lac Seul Lodge, Dan McDonald? This will be our first trip to Lac Seul.....going early September."
562949,wiswalleye,2007-01-23 21:53:00,62,Have been there 5 of last six years. Dan does a good job.
562951,2746,2007-01-23 22:49:00,3206,Thanks. It sounded that way when I spoke to him but wanted someones experience. I appreciate your response.
562952,Guest,2007-01-23 23:33:00,0,"YOU WILL FIND EXCELLENT CABINS ,VERY GOOD BOATS ,NICE DOCKS,A VERY CLEAN CAMP, VERY FRIENDLY OWNER,HE WILL HELP PUT YOU ON THE FISH AND YOU WILL FIND ; LIKE US THAT IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE TO BOOK YOUR CABIN FOR NEXT YEAR WHILE YOU ARE THERE.I WILL BE THERE WITH MY WIFE THE LAST WEEK IN JULY AND THIS YEAR I GET TO GO BACK IN AUGUST WITH THE GUYS. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE YOU WILL HAVE AT DANS CAMP OVER THE CAMPS ON THE FAR WEST END IS THE LOCATION, YOU WILL CUT YOUR GAS COSUMPTION IF YOU WANT TO FISH MACKINZE BAY CAUSE YOUR HALF WAY THERE. THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS HIS YARD IS TIGHT ONCE THE CAMP IS FULL. IF YOU HAVE A BIG BOAT. PUTTING YOUR BOAT IN IS ALITTLE TRICKY CAUSE YOU HAVE TO BACK DOWN A STEEP HILL AROUND A CURVE BUT IT A GOOD LANDING ONCE YOU GET THERE."
562953,Guest,2007-01-24 01:19:00,0,yes we were there once and it was very nice. nice cabins and boats and new motors. he was married then. it seemed right accross the water on the opposite shore trolling we found a lot of nice sized northerns. good luck.
562957,Mike Kansas,2007-01-24 09:40:00,1463,"Been to Lac Seul Lodge 19 times for a week at a time. You will not find any place better and you you won't find a nicer or fairer guy than Dan McDonald. Dan takes pride in customer service and he and his staff will do whatever it takes to make your trip enjoyable. BONUS, he will put you on fish and fun. Hats off to DAN and Lac Seul Lodge. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
562963,Kansaseye,2007-01-24 14:11:00,6,"My Wife, Son, and I have been going to Lac Seul Lodge the last two weeks in June for the past 6 or seven years. Last year and this year my Son and I were able to also go the last week of July or first week in August with a group of guys. Dan is a great guy and runs a first rate camp. It's kept clean and in very good repair. I take my own boat, but the camp boats look to be in very good shape. The staff at Lodge are hard working and very friendly. The fishing is fantastic and can be done without loosing site of the camp or you can go on a 30-40 mile boat ride if you want different scenery. The only bad part about Lac Seul Lodge is, eventually I have to head back to Kansas. Kansaseye"
562964,2746,2007-01-24 16:30:00,3206,"Thanks guys. We've booked the 1st week in September and your glowing reports have me charged up already. We typically fish Gullrock and will be this spring for opeing week. Think we'll stop and say hi to Dan on our way up. Anybody play the Ear Falls golf course? We've got a couple of guys that go through withdrawal if they are away from a course to long. (as for me, I'd just as soon fish!)"
562972,Guest,2007-01-24 20:59:00,0,"Never been to Canada before but thinking about putting a trip together. In Ky we catch most of our eye's at night trolling spinners. I looked up Lac Suel and it looks like a big lake. Would you recommend this lake for someone going to Canada for the first time? If not, suggestions?"
562973,prov1900,2007-01-24 21:46:00,544,"It is a huge lake, but in my opinion, it fishes small. There are lots of islands, and lots of areas to fish. All will produce. You can travel far, or not at all. It is all up to you. You certainly don't have to travel far, only if you are looking for adventure. The next best thing to flying in, maybe better. You will not be disappointed. Have a GPS, one with the Navionics chip and you will fare well. Not that you need it, but it really helps. Most resorts will put you on fish. That is why they have return customers and why this is one of the greatest resources in North America."
