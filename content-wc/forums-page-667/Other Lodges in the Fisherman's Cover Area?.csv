563087,fish 4 fun,2007-01-30 18:41:00,101,I need some recommendations. For the past 3 years my group has been going to Fisherman's Cove South of Ear Falls in mid July. As it turns out we are unable to go our assigned week this year. Fisherman's Cove is so busy they do not have an opening that will work for us. Having fished out of Fisherman's Cove we are familiar with that part of the lake and would like to stay in the area. Are there any other camps in the area that any of you could recommend? We are looking at going the in the mid June- mid July time frame. Thanks. Jason

Fisherman's Cove had an opening July 14-21st, would that work? Scout Lake Resort is also located south of there. Lac Seul Lodge is booked until end of August. Hope this helps! Rather-be-fishin :)"
