They don't have to be trophys but good size. Say walleye 25"" or better and for nortrhern say 35"" or better. Been to a fly in to Kaby Lake and caught lots of walleye but not very big. Any help here would be appreciated. Trip can be drive in or fly in. Thanks"
563065,Guest,2007-01-29 22:35:00,0,Fly out of White River to Esnagi Lake. MarMac Lodge is where I stayed. Excellent accomodations and exactly the fishing you are looking for. Best Fishes ! ggg

563078,Guest,2007-01-30 10:23:00,0,"Sorry, I don't have any recent experience in the WaWa area. You are reasonably close to Hawk Junction where you can catch the Algoma Central Railway (at least you could 20 years ago!) There are several lodges along the railway. We stayed at Sunny-Bob Lodge at milepost 210 on Oba Lake. We hauled in beer,food, fishing motor, fishing gear on flatcar. Railway was pretty tolerant on weight. We enjoyed the trip up and back and had reasonably good fishing for late July early August. Cost is less than fly in and a little more than drive to because of the train tickets. It is a novel trip and is one of my favorite Canadian memories."

Northern plenty of em. usual size walleye 16-19 inch with 1 or 2 in the 25-26 range per week . always 1 or 2 northern 38-42 inch per week. good outfitter and has upgraded most outposts. not the friendlist folk but the air operation seems safe and first rate. Usually 3-5 guys fishing for 6 days eric macdonald"

563150,Guest,2007-02-02 06:51:00,0,I second ggg's suggestion on Esnagi/MarMac lodge. Have been there twice; the fishing is great(lots of eyes and monster pike) and the accomodations are even better. Can't say enough good things about it. Here's a link:www.northtoadventure.com Check it out

In fact they had a picture of may 10 year old Son and his 44"" northeren amoung their pictures last I was there (hes 26 now!) We tried a lot of their lakes- and all were good with better than adverage cabins. My fishing buddy and i only stoop using them because our kids are grown and we chose to go to a ""camp"" with some othe people around- with only two of us, there is no one to play cadrs with<G>. The only ""problem"" with them is that most of the pime dates and lakes are already taken by the guys that took them for the last 10 yrars or more. We know because we held one of those in the second week of June, and the guy that got our spot could not be happier. If you talk to them tell Dallas that Sandy and criag said ""HI"" FOM"
