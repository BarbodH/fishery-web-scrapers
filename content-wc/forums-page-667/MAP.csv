563156,Guest,2007-02-02 12:35:00,0,Looking for a map published by Alex Wilsom Coldstream showing the area North of Nakina. I have their map #70 which covers just North of Nakina and South to RT 11. E-mailed publisher and was advised these maps are no longer in publication. New or used doesn't matter. If you have one or know where one can be purchased please e-mail [email protected]. Thanks Dave
