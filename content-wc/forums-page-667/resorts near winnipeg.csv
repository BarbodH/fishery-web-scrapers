563136,River_eye,2007-02-01 11:29:00,1486,"I guide at Eaglenest off and on, and I know some Pine Island people. Both friendly places, both get booked up quick. I believe Pine Island is a little more affordable, but the location and facilities at Eaglenest are a bit nicer."

563182,canuk1100,2007-02-04 18:31:00,43,Hi Jigmiester if you have any questions let me know I will help all I can. It may be more cost effective to stay in Winnipeg and go fishing from there send me an e-mail so we can talk.
563217,River_eye,2007-02-05 23:34:00,1486,What parts of the Wpg do you guide on?
563238,canuk1100,2007-02-07 16:35:00,43,"Mainly Point Du Bouis to the The Lake, but I also fish on the Bird and Lee Rivers. It really depends on the Angler and what they want I will also take Anglers on the Red or on the Lake if they want."

563104,Guest,2007-01-31 06:06:00,0,"Old Red, I fish that area, what do you think of Smith's Camps ? JJ"

563107,MN_Moose,2007-01-31 09:02:00,965,"Hi JJ You guys were on Longbow the same time our group was a couple years ago. We will be at Smith's this year. Last year we were at a nearby resort Portage Lodge if I remember correctly. We think Smith's will be an excellent choice. We checked it out thoroughly. Our group of 8 had a guided trip with Al Smith all in his one big boat. We had a blast. He certainly knows how to operate a camp. For the originator of this post, there are several nearby resorts within couple hours of Winnipeg. Check out Perch Bay or Sunnyside camp on the Winnipeg river. Easy to get to and excellent fishing."
563112,River_eye,2007-01-31 11:18:00,1486,"Crowduck is not the only lodge in the Whiteshell. I would say Eagle Nest Landing (housekeeping) and lodge (american plan) are your best bets. They are both in the whiteshell on the Winnipeg River. The Landing is 2 hours from Winnipeg Airport, and the lodge is another 45 minute boat ride. They do Crowduck fly-outs as well.www.eaglenest.mb.ca"
563113,Guest,2007-01-31 11:47:00,0,"how long time wise from wiinipeg to kenora, and kenora to minaki area.. my options may me more numerous than i thought. how is winnipeg river system first week in july?? would appreciate more suggestions on resorts in that area. big north?, bayview?. thanks again. jig gone"
