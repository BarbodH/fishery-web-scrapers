563091,Guest,2007-01-30 19:43:00,0,want to try this technique next year. i'm guessing i'll need a long fairly stiff rod. just gonna get an ugly stik. any suggestions?
563096,guidedfishing,2007-01-30 21:42:00,531,"You don't need a stiff rod for slip bobber fishing, since the rod plays no part in feeling the bite, your better off with softer action. ie Your ugly stick is just right for this, no need for an expensive rod when you are slip bobber fishing. good luck GF"
563098,retire55,2007-01-30 22:19:00,1029,I'd recommend a 7 to 8 foot ML (medium light) rod.

563111,Fishing Junky,2007-01-31 11:00:00,182,I use a 9ft steelhead rod with medium action. Line rating 6-12lb test. The long rod offers further casting distance and a long sweeping hookset. I also use 6lb test mono. I love slippin'.
563201,Guest,2007-02-05 13:49:00,0,"Don't buy any special rod. Any good spinning rod you like works fine. If you want to use this as an excuse to buy a new rod (hey thats what I do<G> I look for a rod with a fairly soft tip and good back bone. There are a lot of different way to rig a set up like this- but here is the set up I like the best. I use a longer rod with a very light spinning real. I run a low strech line on the reel (I love 8 lb fire line). I thread on a stop, a plastic bead, then the bobber and tie on a very small barrel sevial. From the other side of I tie on a 3 to 4 foot length of top quality floralcarbon- I use 6 lb here. for weight I just use split shot just below the where I tie on the leader. I add enough weight to get about 75% of the bobber under water ( i always use ""pencil"" bobers) this allows the float to go down with the lightest pull or to pop UP with a suttle pick up. ofcourse where you set the stop will depend on where the fish are holding. becaue I use this mostly when fish are inactive, i set the bobber spot so the bait is just above the bottom. If you use a live minnow, try puting the hook into the mouth and out the gill. (my fishing buddy just runs the hook thru the side below the back bone so the fish is sidways. I catch more fish then him- so at least try it my way. If it matters to you, I use a RED ""Octopus"" hook (#6) tied on with a plamar knot. fishing in early June in the noon to supper time peroid we will regulary boat 70 to 100 Walleye in 4 hours. We usualy use a few minnows to get the fish for dinner- once we know we will eat, we switch to plastics. Last year we switched to the ""foodsource"" type (replacing ""power baits"" and had great success. As the sun gets lower, we switch to drop shot rigs or just light jig heads as once the fish become active there realy isn't a need for any special rigs- mostly just smash the barbs down so you can get your bait back in the water faster! hope this helps FOM"
