One of the things that came up for discussion was the Anglers Legacy program. In a nutshell the program is designed to promote, and foster the sport of angling to those who have never fished, or had the chance to fish. In my case my dad got me started fishing, and it is one of the most enjoyable parts of my life. I am sure many of you have had the same situation where a parent, or another extended member of your family got you started. So lets return the favor, and make a commitment to take one person fishing that has not fished before. It does not have to be a kid, it can be anyone. Once started fishing a majority of these people will continue fishing on their own. I signed up and made the pledge to take someone fishing this year, how about you? The following link will take you there, thanks for supporting the Anglers Legacy program!http://www.anglerslegacy.org All the best, Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944"

I take several kids each summer fishing and for some of them it is their first time fishing. It is always an awesome day for them and me.
