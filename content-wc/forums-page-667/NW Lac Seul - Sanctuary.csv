562917,Guest,2007-01-21 14:17:00,0,"no, no musky. plenty of 40 inchers."
562920,wooglin,2007-01-21 19:35:00,371,"Oh, I gotcha....you mean that your brother-in-law has pike fished there, and hasn't accidentally caught any musky...but the pike are there."
562921,Jesse-WI,2007-01-21 19:44:00,534,I have seen one muskie in 8 years of pike fishing the NW end.
563226,wooglin,2007-02-06 14:19:00,371,"Been thinking about this a bit. Would McKenzie Bay be good for Walleye and/or Muskie this time of year (End of June)? Also, do you know the distance from Ear Falls to McKenzie via boat? Thanks! >Far and few between...Northeast Lac Seul is where they are >at."
563229,Guest,2007-02-06 19:51:00,0,By the way of boat approx 25 miles By air 10-15?? Wind will determine that boat ride....
563233,wooglin,2007-02-07 09:01:00,371,"Thats not too, too bad I guess. How about the musky in that area, do they exist there? Anyone know where the best musky fishing, within a reasonable range, is from Ear Falls? Thanks guys. >By the way of boat approx 25 miles >By air 10-15?? >Wind will determine that boat ride...."
562873,wooglin,2007-01-18 09:26:00,371,"Can anyone explain this to me, dates it's open/closed, where it is...etc. I have learned about this in the recent past, and just would like more info. on it. I am going to be in NW Lac Seul June 22-28, and just need to be educated on the sanctuary. Thanks."
562874,Hump,2007-01-18 10:03:00,578,"I too will be at NW Lac Seul on the same dates.I believe it opens a week ahaead of that. Two years ago we caught alot of fish there, last year they had all moved out."
562877,Jesse-WI,2007-01-18 20:35:00,534,Last year it was closed Apr 1 thru June 15. The rules for this year are not set yet. The amount of fish present will depend on what the spring is like.
562884,Guest,2007-01-19 07:52:00,0,Do you happen to know of a site/link of where this information is typically posted? Thanks man.
562898,Guest,2007-01-19 18:58:00,0,Unless it is a late spawn you will probally not find the quanity of fish up the Winnesaga river. Mostly males hanging around looking for some leftovers. Try Cox Island area or Steamboat

562902,wooglin,2007-01-20 08:40:00,371,"Thanks much guys for the posts, I appreciate it."
562910,wooglin,2007-01-20 19:27:00,371,How is the musky fishin up in the NW section? Thanks!!
562911,Guest,2007-01-20 21:25:00,0,Far and few between...Northeast Lac Seul is where they are at.
562913,Guest,2007-01-21 10:27:00,0,my brother in law has pike fished there for 12 years and never caught one. he has been picking up a few smallies in recent years.
