I have a group of several rookies and a couple of Canada veterans that are looking to reserve a week with these folks. Are they a respectable operation? Do they treat their guests as well as they indicate? I am not looking into any camp bashing, but I would very much like the opinions of those knowledgeable about this outfit. Thank you very much for your opinions. We are hoping to start some really nice memories. Roy"
