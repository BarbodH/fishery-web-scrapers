563170,grt1,2007-02-03 13:04:00,259,"Today is cold, wind chill factor makes it feel like -45 celsius. sunny skies and no one is venturing too far from home. Can't wait for warm weather and open water."
563171,Skylane,2007-02-03 16:02:00,101,"grt1, you are right, it is cold. Just got up here to the cabin in the Dryden area yesterday (Friday) and we are still trying to get the place warmed up with the pellet stove. The radio said the wind chill Sunday will be around -50c. Will catch up on reading this weekend and hope things warm up a little so we can get out and poke a few holes in the ice later next week."
563200,Hump,2007-02-05 13:42:00,578,Are you getting alot of snow?
563209,grt1,2007-02-05 19:03:00,259,In red lake we got about 18 inches on the ground probably more in the bush
562598,Stehle,2007-01-07 08:41:00,95,"I've been away on business for a while and haven't tracked the weather conditions in Northwest Ontario like I normally do this time of year. So, how has the weather been up there (ice thickness, water levels, snow level)? It has been unseasonably warm in most of the U.S. (east of the Mississippi), and I'm concerned that the water levels will be low this year. Thanks in advance"
562601,rpieske,2007-01-07 09:41:00,1276,"Very little snow. Ice is thick enough to drive on. Unless there is significant rain this spring, look forward to low water again."
562604,Guest,2007-01-07 11:24:00,0,Can anyone give an update to amounts of snow in the Ear Falls area?
562607,Stehle,2007-01-07 12:51:00,95,"The snow level can be checked regularly at:http://www.theweathernetwork.com/ It has a pretty good snow report section that shows the snowfall and snow levels for a variety of ""larger"" towns....like Upsala. I appreciate the input from before. Low water fishing is....different, and rock hopping is more prevailant."
562609,Guest,2007-01-07 13:26:00,0,Thank you. That appears to be a great site.
562610,grt1,2007-01-07 13:42:00,259,"Just up the road from Ear Falls on Gullrock, we have about 12"" on the open ground (don't know what it's like in the bush) and the ice from what I'm hearing is thick enough for truck traffic."
562611,Guest,2007-01-07 16:41:00,0,"Here is a post I made the other day, from a thread in another forum... Water levels are LOW, and look to be very low in the upcoming summer, if significant snow and significant spring precipitation do not occur. In terms of water level measurements, I pay close attention to information offered by the Lake of the Woods Control board, who oversee water levels and flow data for Northern Minnesota and much of Northwestern Ontario.http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html It's does not include the waters immediately surrounding Thunder Bay, as they feed Lake Superior and ultimately the Atlantic Ocean, but rather includes all waterbodies feeding the Winnipeg River System and ultimately the Arctic Ocean. Lake St. Joseph is well below normal, as is Lake of the Woods, and basically the whole area. Lac Seul (a reservoir) is very low, despite the fact outflow was kept extremely low this fall. Rainy Lake (on the border) is below the level at which the International Joint Commission classifies as ""drought"". So not too good! We had a drought going into the winter, and so far the winter weather has not helped this situation. NWO Fishing Bum"

If true, that is a definate indication of how dry things are. Also makes you wonder how poorly we treat our environment..."
562627,Guest,2007-01-08 09:41:00,0,"Received an e-mail from Nakina. Just 2/3"" of snow on ground. If this doesn't change, YES low water levels for summer '07."
