I think the Fishin Hole is overpriced, there's gotta be better options out there? Or do you buy online from a place in the US? I'd prefer to shop in Canada to avoid the border crossing hassles with duty, exchange, etc too, but if someone can point me to a US site that has fair prices for this stuff, I'd looking into that as well. Thanks"
