You assume the fish in general would be larger and more abundant. Is this true? Could this have an adverse effect on the younger classes of fish? Let's hope for an early and safe end to this virus so we can get back to what we want to do."
6415744,tv4fish,2020-03-27 08:27:00,2694,"JMHO: Logic would say that yes - probably a few more fish around next year due to less ""catching"" this year. As far as ""larger"" - again - slightly larger - keep in mind that the ""growth rate"" in the colder climates is not as fast as in the warmer climates. Also depends on the amount of ""forage"" that is available to each species."
