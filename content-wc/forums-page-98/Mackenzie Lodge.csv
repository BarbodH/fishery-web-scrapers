6406552,Kripl,2020-03-11 11:37:00,1,Anyone stayed at this resort on lotw that can share opinion on fishing. That bay looks huge and donâ€™t want to travel a long distance for walleye fishing. Would consider late June or early September. Thanks

I know of some old boys that would spend all week fishing within Portage Bay and ""mud bay"" just to the west. You could catch all you want near there but it probably wouldn't be fast and furious. June would be great if you could get in there. July would be busy as a lot of cabin people leave from the marina just to the north. Sept would be quiet but storms can come up on a moments notice. In all, I'd say do it. You can't go wrong."

Two things jump out at me:The price is right - $756 CN per week for a 2 bedroom cabin. I assume that's the rate for the cabin and not per person, although it doesn't specify.This is the worst website for a fishing lodge I've ever seen.I'd be inclined to think the adage ""you get what you pay for"" might be true in this case."

He does have reasonable cabins. If you're looking for a place to fish out of and meet some really friendly people you'll be fine here. I've fished out of Pine portage bay since the mid 1980's.
