I used to take my dog fishing lots more than I do now, even though he makes it quite clear when I am heading out that he wants to go. Unfortunately for him he suffers from the same thing I do, my brain still behaves like a 17 year old, but my body doesn't, and he will injure himself in pursuit of what he loves. With less snow, warmer temps and the need to drive to access lakes I can normally get to by sled, taking the pup with me becomes more feasible. I just wish he could hunt as well as he fishes, lol, its a complete @#$% show taking him grouse hunting.VIDEO https://youtu.be/VVUib1pJFbg"
