You would have to be crazy to give your account #s out to anyone that isnt a main stream business, or the IRS."

6417390,phishfearme,2020-03-30 21:05:00,1242,I agree - see the post I did right before yours in this thread - it's the ONLY way we'll be paying for trips in the future. phish

6281598,phishfearme,2019-01-22 10:31:00,1242,"has anyone paid for their trip via a bank transfer? specifically, paying an outfitter who requests Canadian$$ via a transfer from a US bank? my bank only charges a 1% exchange rate to convert US to Canadian (not to currency but to another international account at that bank) and nothing to perform a transfer from them to a Canadian Bank. all they say is needed is an account number and a SWIFT and Transit number. have not heard back from our outfitter yet but I'm just curious if anyone else has done/tried this - and does the receiving Canadian Bank charge a fee for this? thanks, phish"
6281638,Juls,2019-01-22 12:35:00,13414,The receiving bank will charge the person who's account it's going into a service fee...not you. I have never heard of anyone having to pay this way before...
6281836,Pooch,2019-01-23 03:17:00,4618,"It looks like an alternative way to pay, but a hassle. I wonder why? Are they just offering another option for payment?I think that some camps get bad checks and that has changed how some of the camps we fish out of have started to take plastic. Cash always worked for us.Pooch"
6281852,pjshorthorn,2019-01-23 05:52:00,5654,"I have done a wire tansaction with an outfitter before. In all my trips to Canada on a fishing trip, this was the exception and not the norm in terms of trip payment. The process was extremely easy and seemless. I used a company named Xoom. There were a few requirements in order to process the transfer; not unlike anything we would have to do if sending a wire transfer here in the US. - account number of the person receiving the transfer - institution number of the receiving bank - transit number of the receiving bank - address of the bank -address of the recipient - amount of money to be transferred in Canadian funds - sender's account number - sender's routing number -sender's bank number Only the sender needs to set up an account in Xoom in order to process the transaction. The system asks how many Canadian dollars are to be transferred to the recipient and the system then automatically calculates how many US dollars to debit from the sender's account, based on the current exchange rate. The transaction fee is based on the amount of money being transferred. In my case, I believe the fee was free for any transfer over $1000.00 in loonies. To my knowledge, there was no processing fee by the outfitter's bank to process the wire transfer on their bank's end. I don't know if their is a true place in the lodge and resort industry, but it was very convenient and easy to do once the information was in place and it kept me from having to carry thousands of Canadian dollars on my person while traveling for two days to my fishing destination.

6281924,phishfearme,2019-01-23 08:24:00,1242,"thanks for the replies - I looked into Xoom - although the bank transfer fees (from a US bank to Xoom) is zero, they make their money by: ""In addition to the transaction fee (zero for bank wire to Xoom and $30 for other methods), Xoom also makes money when it changes your send currency into a different currency. Xoom rounds to the nearest 0.05 Canadian dollar"" so their fee may be as much as 5% to do the currency exchange - my bank charges a flat 1% over spot exchange rates so I think i'm getting a better deal with my bank and their wire fee is zero. I may have not been clear in my OP - I am initiating this and I've asked my outfitter if he's set up for this type of payment and what his bank fees would be - he said he'll get back to me but is pretty sure he can do it. I think this is a far superior method (and much more of a ""21st century"" process) for paying an outfitter who wants Canadian currency. there was a time when we would convert US to Canadian cash (quite expensive) and haul all that cash around with us. never more. phish"
6281930,pjshorthorn,2019-01-23 08:31:00,5654,"I agree that some banking institutions will have much better rates on certain fees. I don't foresee using this method in the future,but one never knows. In my case it was just a matter of convenience for both parties and I didn't have to worry about hauling around a lot of cash with me. One fella on the trip had a brick of cash with him in a fanny pack. I told him he was friggin crazy .....LOL PjShorthorn"
6282086,LOW1,2019-01-23 13:50:00,2828,If the resort does not take credit cards you can just wire transfer US dollars to the resorts Canadian bank or credit union. The receiving bank will make the conversion into Canadian dollars. You should be able to call the Canadian Bank up in the morning and get that days exchange rate. You will need to know the routing number for the Canadian bank and the resorts account number. My bank does not consider wire transfers to Canada as being international so it only charges its normal domestic wire rate. I think currently its $15.00.
6282636,phishfearme,2019-01-25 13:12:00,1242,"yah, carrying a wad of cash is indeed crazy - we no longer bring any Canadian cash as almost everywhere you can use credit cards - even for a soft drink or snack. although I do miss seeing those $10 bills with the guy with a bulbous nose - looks like he had a few too many Blues! phish"
6282638,phishfearme,2019-01-25 13:16:00,1242,this is definitely a way to go - I guess it all gets down to how much each bank charges for currency conversion - mine charges 1% of spot and I doubt it could get much lower anywhere else. (no transfer fees either.) I also want to make things as easy for my outfitter so I think sending Canadian $$ to his account is the best route. just don't know yet what if and fees his bank would charge for this. I will report back on how this all transpires. phish
6282926,outdoorsron,2019-01-26 22:45:00,843,Hello: I don't understand why you want to make things difficult. Send the resort your down payment check then about a month before leaving send him the rest by check. Should be plenty of time for the check to clear. Before leaving contact the resort to make sure they received your payment. Always works for me. Good Luck . O - R
