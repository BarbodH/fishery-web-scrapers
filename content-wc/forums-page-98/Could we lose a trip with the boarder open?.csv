6416708,Jesse-WI,2020-03-29 10:42:00,534,My guess / hope is things become clearer by the middle of April.
6416852,eyecatcher1,2020-03-29 16:08:00,323,I hope so too because right now it doesn't look good for trips this year.
6417208,tiltedtoque,2020-03-30 12:46:00,7,"That's me! Got it exactly two years ago tomorrow. Place was a wreck, but in an unbeatable location (incredible fishing/views/landscapes). I've been limiting my bookings anyways while fixing the place up. Even then;First season (2018) Forest Fires. Second season (2019) Flooding & High WatersThird season (2020) ? Loving it."
6417350,joeflip,2020-03-30 19:02:00,75,"Talked to my outfitter today, we had to make it official and cancel our trip for opening day, we have a group of six and 3 are first responders. Positive note we are rebooked for 2021 opener, he was gracious enough to carry the deposit over. Stay strong."
6417360,Hunts1,2020-03-30 19:33:00,123,"God bless the First Responders! We all champion your/their dedication! I hope it works out for you next year! I am hopeful that this blows over quickly and that the rest of us get to go on our trips as planned. Thank you, and those with you, for your service! We are forever thankful/grateful for what you do, despite the absence of gratitude that you receive. Mike"
6417564,emma17,2020-03-31 09:49:00,436,"Joeflip I join in thanking those in your group that are first responders. Although I personally don't feel the same as Hunts1 when he says there is a lack of gratitude for them. I see, read and hear a tremendous amount of public appreciation for the first responders- as it should be. What a sacrifice they make."
6417574,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2020-03-31 10:05:00,629,"I too salute all of those supporting the the efforts to get us back on track. As mentioned by many, the tough part of this ""War"", is we can't see the enemy! Thanks again to all of those standing on the front lines of everyday services to help us defeat the issue! Set the Hook, CRJohn"
6415160,Fisherman Ted,2020-03-26 08:33:00,461,Yes
6415232,Obabikon,2020-03-26 11:18:00,2370,"Very scary time for everyone, to say the least. As all of this continues to unfold I'm more and more confident that the border will be opened well in advance of the start of the season. I feel more and more confident about that every day. New York is showing a death rate at .75% (or less with undocumented cases)... which is still bad, but nothing compared to the 3-4% that was being publicized. As we learn more and more, and get better statistics... this will not be that long of a shut down. It might last past Easter Sunday, but I would be surprised if it lasted past May 1st. We will see though. None of us are privy to all the stats/knowledge that is out there. I can't imagine being a new owner and going through this. Don't forget all the red lake area camps that lost out on much of last season too... prayers are with them that this is a great year to recoup!"
6415242,Andre (wallyandre),2020-03-26 11:32:00,2274,Looking only at the death % is not the right way to look at it; if the hospitals are over crowded it means that all the other needs like if you got a heart attack where and how they will take care of you. It's far from being over and I don't see the border to open any soon.
6415396,Baseline,2020-03-26 15:44:00,3207,"Your statement reminds me of this. ""A farmer was had a field next to a new Interstate with exit ramps to adjoining roads. A speculator wanted to buy his land. The farmer said the land had been in his family for 100 years and there was no way he could sell it. The speculator changed the farmers mind when he told him he was growing $25,000 worth of potatoes on $10 million dollars worth of land.""What's missing at the Canadian and Minnesota fishing resorts is the 40 and under crowd."
6415398,Obabikon,2020-03-26 15:54:00,2370,"Maybe. However, NOTO and the Canadian Government is telling all US resort owners to continue with the work permit process... maybe it's wishful thinking on my part. I am not doubting that this is going to be an issue for quite some time. I just think that the Governments are going to fight it a different way. They're trying to get time to prepare right now. Then, they're going to open the flood gates, and tackle the thing. Just my opinion, which is worth less than $0.02 5 days ago, I was terrified about not having any guests at all this season. Now, I am more worried about having enough time to get the camp ready for opener. That's a pretty big swing."
6415488,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-26 17:27:00,8293,"Thats because the mom & pop resorts you and I grew up with are vanishing. Now the resorts have to have a water park, pool and everything else to get mom & dad to bring the kids anywhere. If I died tomorrow i'm not sure my grand-kids would ever see a place like Voyageurs National Park. Not enough to do to entertain them."
6415530,Hunts1,2020-03-26 18:15:00,123,"My guess is that the restrictions will go away in time for all of our spring trips to wherever we go in Canada. And at most they may have us answer questions about symptoms and m.a.y.b.e take our temperature. I doubt that though. But, if one our buddies isn't feeling well we may need too throw them under the bus and go without them....unless they have a way home if we have to leave them at the border! Same goes if I am sick. Fully expect my group to tell me they will send pictures but for me to stay home. Reasonable and necessary in this environment. This too shall pass...... It's nearly two months away.......I'm going with the assumption that my trip is on. This brings a lot of revenue to the country and keeps these businesses in business. That isn't lost on the Canadians. Particularly, Ontario..... My two cents."
6415534,RichA$1970,2020-03-26 18:16:00,1159,"Fully agree and the under 40 crowd continues to have the time or interest in roughing it. I went to the All Canada Show and it is sad how the outfitters have to cater to the crowd of WiFi, freezers, propane fish fryers and other cost drivers. I bet some will even resort to 3 ply crapper paper to lure in customers."
6415564,drlee,2020-03-26 18:37:00,409,"I have a trip planned for mid June and another in late July. The camp we go to in June, and the one next door, which are the only camps on a 30,000+acre system have both been for sale for a while. Sad. The system we fish is loaded with walleye and northern. Drive in's near Pickle Lake. The other camp, where I go for two weeks, contacted me. They said if they cannot serve us this summer, we can simply carry over our deposit for 2021 and keep our reservations. They fill up through out the summer, so I will keep my space. I am going to be absolutely sick if one or both trips cannot be enjoyed this summer. I am getting up in years and really don't want to miss this great opportunity. Also, my kids and grandkids join me for both trips. What a joy! Praying for good news! And, yes, I know this is concern is not much in the great scheme of things. Be safe, my friends."
6416642,lenray,2020-03-29 08:55:00,467,You mentioned Pickle Lake---The village that is the farthest north you can drive in Ontario on a paved road--North of Ignace???
6414704,bthomas3333,2020-03-25 11:15:00,465,Could we lose a trip with the boarder open? Lots of thinking while I sit around which is a dangerous thing...Anyway. Is it possible camps decide the situation is too uncertain to haul in supplies and fuel over the ice to their camps. I mean who would want to spend thousands right now if the season could be cancelled so they make a call soon to not haul it in. Then the ice goes and then the border does open in May to August but they cant operate without the winter hauls? The price to fly in drums of fuel cant be justified? Right? I know many camps operator on Solar and Propane... Anyway am I crazy to think some camps need to decide while the ice is still stable? Brett
6414728,Fisherman Ted,2020-03-25 12:32:00,461,"Yup, that thought has crossed our minds. I was just talking to a very famous lodge in Alaska actually. And while they open in June, starting in 3-4 weeks they have to make major investments in staff and logistics to get the lodge open. They too are wondering if they should take the risk. There is a very real possibility of a delayed opening which further complicates things. At some point lodges will have to make that call. Same could be said for a delayed start. I know several lodges that say if the borders don't open by X date they are going to scrap the season. Not worth it. Personally I am planning a July 1st open. But so many variables in the mix. I find it incredibly hard to believe the borders are open with no quarantine restrictions before June. New York won't even hit its crest of the wave for another 3 weeks. How in the world would Canada open its border a week after that and say come on up and go right to the lodges. Plus Canada is behind the U.S. from a timing perspective. -FT"
6414750,Skywagon,2020-03-25 13:16:00,1106,"The next year or so may be a great time to get into the lucrative tourist camp business. I suspect a few camp operations that have just been getting by will be on the market. Some of the fixed costs go on whether the camp is open or not, none of this is positive either for the camp or guests, sad for all."
6414816,RichA$1970,2020-03-25 15:50:00,1159,Spot on as I bet some will be on the market
6415020,johnboat,2020-03-25 21:11:00,2014,"I wondered this as well. Some camps, as in all businesses, struggle. As struggling camps close and DON'T get sold due to many various reasons, past guests are now looking for other destinations, possibly making it hard for the regulars to get in to ""their"" camp. This drives up the cost. Which can be good and bad.I guess that's what they call good Ole' supply and demand and the rich getting richer.I hope it all works out for the best and we all learn some lessons. One being not to take what we love to do for granted."
6415054,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-26 02:47:00,8293,"Just be thankful if you didn't buy a camp in the last year or two. Can you imagine if this year was to be your first year as a camp owner? Yikes, quit your job, took a mortgage, in some cases moved. Relocated the wife & kids for the ""good life"" and now this."
6415084,tv4fish,2020-03-26 05:21:00,2694,"EXACTLY - That would be a terrible position to be in. Does Ontario allow ""non-residents"" to own camp/lodges?"
6415090,RichA$1970,2020-03-26 05:34:00,1159,. Feel for them an all the others who take a chance to make something happen. I feel just on the generation change it’s a shrinking industry similar to hunting.
6415092,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-26 05:49:00,8293,In Minnesota what happened was the land & cabins became worth more than the business. When it became time to sell a resort it was worth more to sell each cabin and lodge and then any excess land then it was to sell the existing business. Like EVERYTHING else in life it came down to money.
6415116,MikeF,2020-03-26 07:21:00,895,Have seen this happen to a few places in NW Wisconsin that I used to visit. I agree that the change in life styles has seen a lot of the the lodge customer base grow old and gray. Diminishing returns in more ways than one.
