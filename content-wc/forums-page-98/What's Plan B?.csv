6412702,Lamp40,2020-03-21 11:36:00,30,"We’re going in mid August, hopefully things are worked out by then. I have $400 in the deposit, which we could sit on till next year to help the outfitter. If the trip’s canceled, we’ll just have to suffer fishing Lake Erie!"
6412704,eyecatcher1,2020-03-21 11:48:00,323,I'm supposed to be up there June 13-27. Maybe we'll see each other on the water Dave.
6412708,JAY221,2020-03-21 11:53:00,877,"Our trip is mid July if it works out. Tom offered to hold onto the deposit in case he needed to send it back but I told him to cash it and if it doesn't happen this year and I am still around it will be next years trip when I show up. Later, Jay"
6412936,David Anderson,2020-03-21 22:48:00,2073,"LSO, I'll be in the Ranger 620 with an Evinrude, assuming I don't hit a rock this year!"
6413008,eyecatcher1,2020-03-22 06:53:00,323,I'll be in an older Red 620 with a Mercury Optimax on it.
6412388,Carnhzkr,2020-03-20 16:57:00,964,"Most of us are wondering the same thing; will we be able to go on our Canada trips this year? We likely won't have that answer until one or two weeks prior to our trip dates, so I'm trying to figure out how to come up with a Plan B. I already have an $800 deposit on my Plan A in Ontario. If I were to book an alternative lodge in Northern WI or MN, I'd have to drop a considerable deposit to hold my Plan B. If the border remains closed, I imagine Plan A would roll my deposit to next year. Not sure about that yet, but that would seem to make the most sense to me. If they open the border, yippee! I can do Plan A, but lose the deposit I dropped on Plan B. It seems the only way to work this without loosing a deposit is to just sit tight and wait for a definitive answer about the border situation, likely one or two weeks prior to the Plan A trip, then either proceed to Canada or scramble and hope to find a MN or WI lodge with an opening, but that'd be unlikely in mid-late June. Or I could take my wife's advice and spend a week at her parents' place. Here's hoping for Plan A! What are others doing to secure a backup plan?"
6412410,Pooch,2020-03-20 17:14:00,4618,"Feel for you brother! My backup plan for fishing is racing and my backup plan for racing is fishing. My wife's backup plan for me is landscaping and front steps. Feel very bad for lodge operators. They, like agriculture only get one chance a year to make living. A lost season is an entire year of lost income. Few can take a hit like that and come out without permanent scars. Everything will hopefully work itself out eventually. Just takes time and perseverance. Patience grasshoppers. Pooch"
6412432,tandm,2020-03-20 17:59:00,679,"I considered putting a deposit on a Stateside resort, but there is no guarantee they will be allowed to operate this summer. I'm just sitting back, hoping this situation is resolved by Canada time. I am confident my Canada deposits will carry over in the event of a prolonged shutdown, so may have to forego 1 year. Until then, I'll just try to avoid the virus, catch up on honey-do projects, and reminisce about all the trips I have taken in the past. Beside that, if I miss this year's trips, I can take twice as many next year, right?"
6412440,JOE WALLEYE,2020-03-20 18:16:00,753,I feel bad for the resorts. I imagine if they loose the entire season some would be forced to fold and won't be open next season. I have the vacation time secured so my plan B is to enjoy the week off and fish close to home. I would be a bummer to miss the trip north because that is the only time all year that I see most of the group.
6412446,RichA$1970,2020-03-20 18:33:00,1159,Head to my dads farm in SoIL n fish the Smithland Pool.
6412452,NARDA 1,2020-03-20 18:36:00,636,"My trip isn't until September, so my thought is things will be straightened out by then. If I had an earlier trip scheduled I think I would just sit tight and wait it out. If I wasn't able to take that trip then I would let that lodge owner know that I would be willing to take a later trip once the border opens up, if he gets a cancellation. I would think this would be the case with a lot of lodges because other people are going to cancel early and make other plans."
6412464,RichA$1970,2020-03-20 19:39:00,1159,I changed to September this year and got a 33% discount from the outfitter so it’s looking good right now vs our early June past trips
6412472,ia bhtr,2020-03-20 21:04:00,212,"Our "" guys trip "" has us getting into the Ear Falls area 1st Sat in June , I know our monies will roll over to next year if necessary on that trip , Wife and I have a tripped booked on LOTW north of Sioux Narrows 1st week of Sept , fingers crossed for both trips , but probably be lucky if either one happens , just depends on how long this thing takes to run its course , if China is telling the truth ( yea right ) they have had a couple days back to back with no new cases , so 4 months or so . As long as the virus leaves us alone here , got the local lakes to hit , so at least we have something. Got a walleye opener on Winni planned , but I am probably backing out of that one myself , pretty close up with whats going on . As others have said , hope the lodge owners get thru this thing , gotta be feeling a little sorry for them , for us maybe we lose a trip , for them maybe a camp or at least a large part of their income for the year even if they get going later on"
6412484,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-03-20 22:13:00,240,"I have a few thoughts/options on this. If my May trip gets scuttled, for example, I am hoping that I can switch to a slot in September, assuming the borders might be open by then. Secondly, I will look at some fishing in the BWCA during the summer, or booking something with a lodge/outfitter on Rainy Lake. I have $900 tied up in deposits for my two outpost trips; but my thoughts, first and foremost, are with the outfitters. Would feel bad getting a refund, knowing that this is going to crush more than a few of the smaller outfits. Will do anything I can to make sure the money stays in their hands."
6412700,David Anderson,2020-03-21 11:14:00,2073,"I have 3 trips planned for Lac Seul, on opener May 16th, the 3rd week in June and the 3rd week in September. Although I remain optimistic for all of them, the reality is maybe the May might be in jeopardy but if it extends into September there will be a lot bigger problems than getting to Canada."
