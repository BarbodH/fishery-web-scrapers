Last week just before all the **** really hit the fan with Corona some buddies and I finished a five day pre-self-quarantine before this weeks recommendations asked all Canadians to now do the same. The fishing for greys was ""tough"" but in all honesty having the chance to explore the Atikokan area with friends old and new, share great food and drink, visit a century old ""castle,"" and just get away from it all, was a breath of fresh air for everyone. And we did catch fish too!Wrote a picture loaded story about the time. Anyone needing a break from reality is welcome to link in and come along on the trip!.https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/browns...le-grey-trout/Bunk!"
