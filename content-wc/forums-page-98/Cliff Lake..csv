6412736,Bill Krejca,2020-03-21 13:25:00,6107,"She and I corresponded back and forth, some, so some of the info I got didn't get to WC. In one post, either here on WC or in my email, she went out one evening? and I believe still fished below a falls, although it could have been in a bay, and came up with a very nice stinger of walleye, which she shared. She was extremely happy with the catch. shortly after that, she shared that the business was in trouble. due to some type of partner problem, the nature of which wasn't shared. My take on her acquiring the camp was that she was led to believe the lake had a much more accessible quantity of walleye than actuality, or maybe didn't even ask. It is amazing to me that, all things being equal, more than one happy new camp owner does not inquire/research the fish population/netting status/ political culture of a camp/ area before signing on the dotted line, as I have seen this as elsewhere new camp owners come into the picture. My perception of Rose was that of a vibrant, neat lady, with a lot of energy, I hated to see her depart. Bill"
6413166,prov1800,2020-03-22 11:11:00,5010,Bill.some 20 years ago i guided dick stenberg on cliff lake who at that time wrote books on fishing for the Minnesota hunting and fishing library.these were hard cover books and very informative.the one that was done for cliff covered all species.was a fun week putting it together.iam sure its still available somewhere.
6413184,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-22 11:38:00,8293,"I have a stack of books Sternberg did ""The Hunting and Fishing Library"". Which one contains Cliff?"
6413438,JayM5209,2020-03-22 19:05:00,1050,"I have a complete set of the original Hunting and Fishing Library series of hardcover books on fishing only - minus one. I bought them one at a time as they were published, maybe in the late 70s? There was one on lake trout fishing which may be the one that mentioned Cliff Lake. I had a copy but loaned it to someone years ago and it never came home. I've searched used bookstores over the years and have never found that volume on laker fishing. If anyone has a copy and wants to get rid of it, let me know!I've fished for lakers in Cliff every summer since I bought those books. Lots of memories. Never met anyone who knows that lake like ProV1800 does. Never fished with him but did have a pleasant chat with him several years ago at the Lost Bay docks."
6413444,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-22 19:22:00,8293,"I think I got my books when I was a member of the North America Fishing Club if I recall right. I have never checked to see if I have all the books, maybe I should do that."
6413466,jcd,2020-03-22 20:04:00,185,"I remember Rose posting years ago too. After some research, I found Rose Engelke (West Bend, WI) posted Dec 2007 stating they were buying Lost Bay Resort. During 2012, she said they were divorcing and leaving the Resort."
6416364,JayM5209,2020-03-28 14:11:00,1050,"In my earlier reply to this thread (#24) I mentioned a missing volume from my set of the Hunting and Fishing Library. I found a copy at an online used bookstore and it arrived today! The volume of the H&L Library that discusses Cliff Lake is titled ""Fishing Natural Lakes."" The info about Cliff, in my opinion, is accurate, helpful and still useful to those who are new to the lake. Of course, it couldn't be otherwise since ProV1800 helped produce this section of the book!Another volume, ""Fishing Man-Made Lakes"", discusses Lac Seul."
6416368,prov1800,2020-03-28 14:20:00,5010,Thx jay.man that was a long time ago.In my infant stages of guiding.lol.It was all well done and agree its a great book.They even had divers in the water.They hoped for a electrical storm which we got and the divers could go down and touch the walleyes on the bottom.Glad you found it.iam in a few of those pics.Little younger looking than now but same enthusiasm.

6416476,prov1800,2020-03-28 18:29:00,5010,"What a beautifull day today in NWO.Wife a i got out on the lake around 9.its all solid ice now.most snow is gone. With my tuned up auger i drilled 6 -10"" holes in no time flat.Saw some fish right away but they only chased the lure and then disappeared but somemore would come by every once in a while.Finally ended up catching one so we figured it was time.Thats when my phone rang.was my sisterlaw in law telling us there father passed away in the morning.we knew it was comiñg.had a great life.but we packed up and went home.my wife cant even go to manitoba to see family in this virus time as provincial boarders are now patrolled and have to check in.she would have to self isolate in mb for 2 weeks and again back home.what a crazy time we are living in.got a bad selfie and good shot of ice conditions.i put sled away today and have loaded up my grizzly."
6411406,prov1800,2020-03-19 09:18:00,5010,Totally possible also.
6412060,Bill Krejca,2020-03-20 07:36:00,6107,"Yeah,she owned a camp on the lake, trying to remember her name. She was an interesting individual, wrote a number of informative posts. I ran into her at a sport show somewhere, nice very likable lady. I believe she got into some sort of bad business arrangement, and removed herself from the camp, then took a job, maybe out west? One of her final posts was showing bunch of nice walleye taken from the lake, which kinda surprised me as I thought it was not known as much for walleye. Bill"
6412072,prov1800,2020-03-20 07:55:00,5010,The original owner was bev drinkwater.She might of wrote a few posts but hasnt owned Lost Bay Resort for quite a few years.Bill iam not going say Cliff Lake ìs a walleye factory and basically its not a destination i would recommend for a week of walleye.But if you know the lake well and how trout lake walleye behave you could have some good fishing.I can catch walleye in a bunch of lakes without any trouble but love the challenge of cliff lake.Ive had many days with lots of action that would rival any lake.Some days not but i can accept that.Ive probably caught more big fish there than any other lake.You can can find eater sized schools and then large fish schools.As you probably know it has all species in it. But since walleyes are tough it doesnt get fished much.Bonus.It has amazing fishing for the ither species.I go there often on my own and i have guests that request going there.You would probably enjoy it.
6412084,jackpotjohnny48,2020-03-20 08:07:00,153,"Hey prov1800,Can you elaborate a bit more on the walleye fishing in Cliff? I've fished Cliff for maybe a day and half, about 8 years ago, but we were only fishing for muskies and lake trout at that time. I did manage to catch an accidental 27-inch walleye while trolling a musky crankbait, and did catch a few other walleyes (suspended in deep water), but didn't put very much time or effort into the walleyes.Having said that, I have fished some other lake trout / cisco based lakes in northwestern Ontario (such as Pipestone and Dogtooth), and have done well by trolling crankbaits in the upper 20 feet of the water column in very deep water (80 to 100 foot water depths) as the ciscoes make their daily vertical migration at dusk and after dark.After having discovered this pattern on Pipestone and Dogtooth within the last couple of years, I've been thinking about returning to Cliff and using this same pattern there as well. (Because I think, theoretically, that the pattern SHOULD work on Cliff, since it's worked on Pipestone and Dogtooth for us.... and both of these are deep lake trout waters). Definitely been toying with the idea of going back to Cliff and spending more time there.Can you elaborate a bit more on your walleye experiences on Cliff, and how would you define ""big"" when referring to the walleyes there? Do I have a legitimate chance to catch 8 to 10 walleyes per evening on the deep open water trolling bite in early August? If so, what should I expect in terms of average size?Thanks in advance for any further info you can provide,""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6412090,prov1800,2020-03-20 08:18:00,5010,I dont have to go into much detail.Your on the money for that time of the year.And yes you can catch many fish in that size pretty consistently.Very clear water and they suspend over deep.Just have to find the schools.If found trolling wiĺl do the job but a slow method with going back and forth.I sip bobber them.hardest part is finding them.
6412108,jackpotjohnny48,2020-03-20 08:45:00,153,"Thanks, prov1800. Got it."
6412120,prov1800,2020-03-20 08:50:00,5010,Its all about patience.

6412692,prov1800,2020-03-21 10:27:00,5010,"That name jogged my memorie Bill.I do remember but not sure about where she was staying on the lake.Back to the walleye.Actually the walleyes in Cliff have a tendecy to run quite large and there are lots of eater sized also so spawning seems to be doing good.Just not a lot habitat for them but enough areas where they can be comfortable.Whole lake has plenty of forage for all species.Ive always caught a numbr of 28-30""walleyes.Opener is usually my favorite time as i have found some excellent areas where we get them in 2-3 ft of water on some rockpiles."
