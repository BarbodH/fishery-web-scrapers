6417532,prov1800,2020-03-31 08:37:00,5010,Lucky to get out again.Took the Atv and riding on ice is like being on a hwy.+12c but a -4c start and bit of a breeze to keep it cool.Fishing started slow.Saw lots of fish on sonar as you can see in sonar pic i had a laker under the ice and it chased lure down to bottom.they would chase but thats it.Tried lots of different presentations but besides a fish here and there they wernt very hungry. That did change as they started feeding and every fish that came up to check lure out bit.Lots of action for a good 1 1/2 hrs hooking up with 15 lakers then kinda slowed again.mostly smaller fish but some good eater sized ones.headed home around noon.
