6413154,Guest,2020-03-22 11:09:00,0,"I do a lot of fly fishing for pike and saltwater fish with serious teeth. Leaders have to be soft enough to not deaden the action of the fly. Titanium is too stiff and I've had big pike bite through heavy fluoro. The best stuff I have used is the 49-strand American Fishing Wire/AFW. They have other wire material, but the 49 is the most supple...you can tie a regular fishing knot in 30lb, so no need for swivels. The 49 also seems to be less prone to kinking after several fish - although not as good as titanium. Beadalon is actually the manufacturer, and you can find the brand in a lot of craft store and on Amazon. The Beadalon is exactly the same stuff as AFW, but priced considerably less, and can be bought in larger spools than is the case with AFW. It also comes in some different colors, 'tho I stick to brown/camo. I tie my tippets in 20#-35# and use about 16"" at the end of a stiff leader."
6413768,Esoxfeign1313,2020-03-23 10:11:00,79,"I’m still in the R&D phase with making my own leaders. I’m done with buying them for a variety of reasons, one of which is the fact that I have never seen one with a snap swivel at the end that attaches to the lure. This is especially critical for spoons, which need to be able to wobble freely. Anyway, I started using tieable titanium wire, but I’ve had a couple of odd breakoffs, so I’m trying fluorocarbon instead. For whatever reason, the wire broke right below the Albright knot when I went to set the hook on what appeared to be a nice pike, and then again when I went to yank another smaller pike out of the water by the line (I normally never do that, but the situation dictated no other option at the moment). I’m not a physicist, so I don’t why it’s breaking right below the knot, but I can’t be having that! I definitely won’t be having that issue with fluorocarbon. I still need to experiment with tying the fluorocarbon to the braid/snap swivel. I’ve found some good options online, but does anyone have any experience with tying fluorocarbon directly to braided line/snap swivels?"
6413838,bthomas3333,2020-03-23 12:43:00,465,For what its worth I troll Lake Trout with a 50lb braid to 40lb Flouro carbon leader of 3-6 ft. I use a double Unknot to connect the two lines. Then buy the best ball bearing swivel snap I can find. I like 5/0 Mustad Ball Bearing Swivels with welded ring and cross lock snap.
6413896,BornToFish,2020-03-23 14:25:00,1224,"Greetings, I have used the Du-Bro nail knotter tool to tie heavy fluorocarbon to swivels, welded rings and the like, for use with musky leaders. The tool works great and is simple to use. I never tried, but suspect that it could be used to tie a nail knot with the plastic line from weed whacker type line trimmers. There are likely youtube videos available to show you how to use the tool. I would try a back-to-back uni knot to tie flurorocarbon to braid. Keep in mind you will need to see if the tag end goes through your rod's eyes - if your leader is that long. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6413912,tolsen,2020-03-23 15:32:00,126,x2 you can bump it up to 60 if needed but more than enough. Alot better than steel especially for those jerking lures so you done get kinks.
6413988,Esoxfeign1313,2020-03-23 18:22:00,79,Thanks for the advice!
6414034,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-23 20:12:00,8293,I could use some pictures of what you guys are making. Especially with a snap swivel .
6414088,DougBlack,2020-03-24 05:12:00,29,"Just get some 12lbs fireline, Ive caught 1000's of Northerns, many very large with no leader, just the fireline. After a few hours, cut off 2 feet and retie, Just my opinion"
6414130,Esoxfeign1313,2020-03-24 07:41:00,79,"It makes no sense to me why pre-fabbed leaders have the swivel part at the end where it attaches to the main line, being that you need the swivel part at the lure end for better action. That literally was the #1 reason why I started making my own leaders. I’ll post a pic at some point, since I do need to start practicing new knots for the upcoming season."
6412534,RichA$1970,2020-03-21 05:51:00,1159,"Well since it is f n boring due to the virus, I’ve decided to make some leaders for Northerns (no muskies where I fish). Interested in what others use be it mono or fluro, test # and any other suggestions. I know titanium are also popular n if single wire or strand is preferred. After that then off to crawler harnesses."
6412564,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-21 06:42:00,8293,"I like a 12"" strand wire. I've tried floro and know that others say it's the cats meow, however I can't tell any difference. What type of snaps are you crimping on?"
6412582,RichA$1970,2020-03-21 07:14:00,1159,I like the VMC touch lok snaps
6412670,bthomas3333,2020-03-21 09:42:00,465,In general I prefer Flouro for pike especially for larger fish. The ability to grab and hold the leader is by far the easiest. If I am catching numbers of smaller pike the shear number of fish will tend to cause the Flouro to get nicked over and over and need to be changed out. In that case the Titanium really shines. I have some that I know have over 1000 fish on them and they are still good to go.Another plus of Flouro if you are tying your own you can just cut off the ends and throw them back in the box and the cost is almost nothing.I never use wire anymore and gave away my last few last summer. Just not worth the hassle of kinks.Straight single wire Titanium is for glide baits when you jerk and pause is where it shines. The other leaders tend to get tangled in the hooks on the pause when the lure swims sideways or backward.Just my two cents.Brett
6412722,RichA$1970,2020-03-21 12:53:00,1159,I have been using 40# test fluro for my leaders with no bite offs but curious what others use for Northerns.
6412730,bthomas3333,2020-03-21 13:08:00,465,My preference is at least 80lbs. I am less worried when I have to pull fish out of weeds. It also takes a few more nicks and gouges.Brett
6412750,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-21 13:50:00,8293,"Agreed, those seem to hold well for me also."
6412784,Golden Eagle,2020-03-21 14:51:00,2642,"Use the best fasteners you can find.100 lb Seaguar Fluorocarbon leader material works well for me.I have a stash of Berkley fasteners, purchased several years ago. 100 lb Doublebarrel sleeves work better than single barrel because they don't mash line as much."
6412822,adempsey2.0,2020-03-21 17:13:00,611,"I use 20-30# and 70#-80# single strand/7-strand titanium for most cranks and spoons. I never made these though. It is strong and light.I do make leaders for trolling and jerkbaits/soft plastics.Trolling I used 130-200# mono leader material (Hi-Seas Grand Slam). It is stiffer than regular mono and used for salt water fishing. Double barrel crimp sleeves, American Fishing Wire ball bearing swivels (#4 or 5) and stay-lok snaps from various companies (e.g., Mustad, Stringease).For jerk baits and soft plastics I use solid stainless steel wire (AFW Tooth Proof) in 174-240#. Same swivels and snaps. For some soft plastics I also use a leader with a hook instead of a snap.I like the American Fishing Wire (Hi-Seas is the same company) products. Not too expensive and the quality has been good so far."
6412970,BornToFish,2020-03-22 05:58:00,1224,"Greetings, Making leaders during this time of uncertainty is a great pass-time as it is productive time in terms of accomplishing something, while looking forward to better times! I've been making my own leaders for about fifteen years or so, for northern pike and muskies. I happen to believe that there is no one-size fits all leader. I view leaders as being akin to tools. Each tool has an intended purpose. Most of my fishing for northern pike is with spinner baits, in-line bucktails, spoons, and jerk/glide baits. I normally use a leader made with 7-strand wire when throwing spinner baits, in-line bucktails and spoons. I switch over to single strand wire for the jerk and glide baits. My seven strand wires are all tied with knots. I never rely solely upon a crimped sleeve to secure hardware, although I do use a crimped sleeve to tack down the tag end. I switched many years ago to using split rings to attach my lures, rather than snaps. I tie the seven strand wire to a welded ring and then attach the split ring. I use a ball-bearing swivel on the other end of the leader. I most often use seven strand wire rated at 90 pounds. Most of these leaders are around nine inches in length. I found that the split ring pliers by Xuron, with the powder blue handles, to be the best that I have tried. My single strand wire leaders have the same hardware. The length and diameter of this leader depends upon the size of the bait. I do not want the wire leader to impede the action of the lure. Thus, the leaders tend to be around six inches with smaller lures in the springtime, and increase to around 9-10 inches with larger lures in the autumn. I don't recall the diameters of the single strand wires that I use most often, but do recall that they are rated in the 75-120 pound range. I never use a split ring directly attached to a leader, rather use a welded ring between the leader and the split ring. I never have two split rings arranged nose-to-nose. I found either of these situations to be a recipe for a disaster. Good fishing and tight lines!! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
