6413942,MrSimon,2020-03-23 16:19:00,922,"It's all anecdotal of course, but the top 10-20 walleye lakes I've ever fished don't have any bass. And ALL of the lakes/rivers I've fished that have both, have only mediocre walleye numbers. Pressure might play a LARGE part in that though."
6414042,prov1800,2020-03-23 20:32:00,5010,They are im a lot of our lakes for well over 10 years now or more and seem to be having no effect on the waters i fish. Or not that iam seeing anyways.Lake of tge woods has had them forever also with no ill effect.Eagle lake is loaded with rustu grayfish for years now and except for tge odd weed bed they tear apart has not changed much.Every fish seems to be eating them as i see the stomach contents often.

6414198,Bill Krejca,2020-03-24 09:53:00,6107,"Hm. I'm not an expert on anything, but I'd think a number of factors could enter in regarding crappie being detrimental. Factors such as size of the water body, and flow age, smaller lakes maybe being not so good. Rusty crawfish can have an effect on weed elimination, which could be I'd think, more harmful to walleyes in a clear lake. Interesting that bass could be a problem. I remember reading, more than a few years ago, I think before 1980, that bass chemistry can destruct walleye spawn, restricting hatch numbers somewhat significantly. The article was sort of directed at the LOW area, if I remember correctly. Also interestingly, not long after, LOW suddenly had a surprising(to maybe only some of us) population of large mouth, where none had existed, and shortly after that, bass tournaments magically appeared on LOW. I never heard another word of bass being detrimental to walleyes after that! Bill"

6413608,Skywagon,2020-03-23 06:18:00,1106,"We first started seeing crappie show up in our lake system probably 15 years ago, unheard of this far north. Obviously someone illegally planted them, bringing them in from the Rainy River system, thinking it was a great idea. They have now completely infiltrated this 50,000 acre chain of lakes and who knows how far down the river they will go from there. Walleye had already been on the decline (for many reasons) over the years in this lake system, but with the introduction of this new predator the decline can only become worse. So making lemonade out of lemons, I am now ice fishing for crappie when not chasing walleye and lake trout elsewhere."

6413772,emma17,2020-03-23 10:12:00,436,"Bill Your post got me wondering, besides fishing pressure/netting, I've read the following three factors negatively effect the Walleye fishery: -Small Mouth Bass -Rusty Crayfish -Crappie I'm curious if this list is accurate."
