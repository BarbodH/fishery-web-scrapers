510611,Dave,2001-01-25 15:51:00,258,"One of the best fishing campgrounds I've been to was Tomahawk Resort (www.tomahawkresort.com) on Lake of the Woods. The grounds are beautiful and the people and service are very good. It's a first class operation.The fishing was quite good as well. It took a day to get the lake patterns figured out, but we did well. WE were there in late June, catching walleyes in 20' off the edges of mid lake humps, and ledges. I've made my reservations at Tomahawk for this year and can't wait to get up there again and go fishing.Tight lines.Dave."

510617,Guest,2001-02-14 05:22:00,0,"take a look at rainbowpoint lodge great fishing for walleye, smallies, northern pike, perch. been there many times and highly recommend it, have campsites with hookups, showers, boats and a store right there if you need anything or forgot it GREAT all around."
510599,Guest,2001-01-16 21:05:00,0,"I just wanted to know of everybody's opinions on the best place where you can catch walleye, smallmouth, and northern and/or muskie while camping under the great clear canadian sky.It seems to me that most places don't offer campgrounds, but I am a penny pinching college kid that loves to fish canadian water. I have been to Separation Lake's campground and I personally think that it will be tough to beat, but I just wanted to get some other ideas. thanks in advance for any info.Kyle Kinsinger"
510600,Karl,2001-01-17 05:15:00,63,Try Ojibway Provincial Park. It's located just south of Sioux Lookout on Little Vermillion Lake. One of the best smallmouth bass and muskie lakes - no walleye though.
510601,BD,2001-01-17 06:38:00,739,Lake of the Woods Houseboats (and campground). www.lowhouseboats.com Very nice campground with sites for RV's and tents. There are showers and flush toilets and a good supply of firewood. Boat rentals available. Dan and Noreen will help you in any way they can.Press Lake Camp. www.presslake.on.ca The only camp on the lake (part of the English River System). Housekeeping cabins and campsites. Electricity to the campsites but not running water. Showers and flush toilets close to the camp sites. Rental boats have swivel seats. Nicely kept camp. Gerry and Barbara are great.
510602,Guest,2001-01-18 21:44:00,0,"Hey Kyle, I fish most of the waters around southern Ontario especially the Kawartha regions of Ontario. I tournament fish as well. The best campground I can advise for you is on Cameron Lake. Cameron's a bit of a fishing hole for me so it's biting me to tell you about it. There are plenty of walleye, tonnes of Smallies, lots of Largies and lots of Muskie. Back to the campground I've been to on Cameron. It's called Sunny Acres. An older lady named ""Audrey"" runs the place. They've got camping areas, trailers and small cottages to rent as well. They also have a private launch if you bring a boat. If not, you can rent one there. It's a great spot with a lot of good fishing. Most of my larger fish and best experiences have come from this lake as well. F.Y.I. This lake is in the middle of two other lakes that all connect. There's Balsam and Sturgeon that can be accessed by locks. Cameron's all you need though. Whites and Pinks work awesome. Very pronounced weedlines and rocky shoals. Hope this is of any help.Kim Kwan"

510606,Guest,2001-01-20 20:09:00,0,"Hello Kyle ,just booked my 3rd trip back to separatio lake campground.I found out about this system on a stroke of luck.No need for a fly in trip.How about them walleye and smallies,so my question to you is ,why give up a great system like this?I really do not think,another campground will be as impressive asseparation lake campground,if you do find and book one email me back.I would like to know!P.S. one trip we fished from shore and caught walleye from 3-8 lbs underneath the bridge,to lazy to back out in the boat.Great fishing to you this season.

510607,Guest,2001-01-23 18:58:00,0,"So.....how do you make a reservation for this campsite on Separation Lake. Is it private or provinical, do they have a web site?"
510608,Guest,2001-01-24 13:13:00,0,"It is a private owned place. Obviously, they are located on Separation Lake. They have both a lodge and a campground on the lake. I stayed at the campground, which is situated right by a high current area where walleye, smallmouth, and northern feed heavily. I thought it was great having a known hotspot literally 100 yards from the campground. The lodge is positioned on the main lake, and i didn't even see it while i was there so i can't comment on it in particular. The only downside to the campground was that it cost $21.00 per person per night, not $21.00 for the campsite itself. There is about 10-12 campsites at the place and the service is very helpful. All other information can be found at www.separationlake.comI would definitely recommend it. good fishingKyle Kinsinger"
