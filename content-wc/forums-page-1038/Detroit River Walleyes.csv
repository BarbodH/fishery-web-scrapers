Jiggin is the way to go 90% of the time,i can give you some tips if you like.I don't troll but if I did would use stick baits early spring and reverse troll against current very slow up and down channel banks,if the fish are aggressive or as water warms would use spoons.YA GOTTA JIG IT PRODUCES AND YOU CAN LEARN.GOOD FISHIN"
