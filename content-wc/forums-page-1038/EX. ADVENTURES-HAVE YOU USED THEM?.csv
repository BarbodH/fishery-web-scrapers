510905,Guest,2001-02-05 09:52:00,0,"Have not been to Brownstone, but went on a trip to Sumach thru Excellent Adventures two years ago. I've been on two other fly-ins and Excellent Adventures is definitely the best outfitter I've worked with. Nice people. Good equipment. Cabin was fine. BTW, caught ""hundreds"" of 18-inch walleyes on Sumach in 1999, but only a few fish above 20"", with the biggest about 23""."
