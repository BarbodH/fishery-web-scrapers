510980,Frank from TBay,2001-02-06 15:22:00,312,"Most areas have you able to use stringers and livewells or fishbaskets. There are some lakes Lake Nipigon being one that you must either let the fish go or kill it. There are no live fish allowed in possesion. I know there are other ones. Check the area in the back of your regs that are lake specific and it will tell you. There are no general rules against stringers, only lake specific rules. I am only speaking for Ontario. ""Canada is a huge place"" Good fishing: Frank"
