511012,jvfisherman,2001-02-08 17:48:00,15,Anyone have any info on Pelee island? I'm contemplating a trip in the mid-May time frame. Is this a good time for 'eyes or Bass? Any regulations or closed seasons? Any help would be appreciated.

Be prepared to spend quite a bit of time on shore because of the weather. One more thought, if you're thinking about taking the ferry out of Sandusky, Oh. they're probably booked by now. It starts filling up right after the first of the year. By driving around to the Canadian side you should be OK. Good Luck!"
