510983,Guest,2001-02-08 05:11:00,0,Does anyone have any general comments or experience with these lakes or cabin / lodge outfitters that service the lakes? I'm trying to plan a trip for next year to this area and heard that these lakes rarely disappoint for walleye and pike. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks.
