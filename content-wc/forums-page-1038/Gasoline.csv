510987,Guest,2001-02-08 07:57:00,0,I was just in Canada doing some snowmobiling and gas was .77 a liter for 87 octane. That's about 2.10 a gallon U.S.!!! This summer when I go fishing how much extra gas can you take into Canada. I'm not going to load up a 55 gallon drum or anything like that but I'm thinking more like four six gallon cans or so. Is there a rule or anything against it?

510989,Xplorer,2001-02-08 09:11:00,244,"Fuji, Not sure where in Canada you are going (its a big place!!) but I'm sure there is a reg listed on the customs website of the province you plan to travel to (you might want to search the archives for this, I remember a customs link for getting a remote border permit before). What I have been told when we go to Ontario thru Ft Frances is that you can take only a full tank in your boat. Any additional amount is subject to duty. On occasion I have taken an extra 5 gallon, and on a couple of occasions 2 5-gallon cans and not had to pay a duty on the extra gas. But I do not expect it. And I always declare it. If I have to pay duty, then I pay. I'm not sure what the duty would be on a 5 gallon can. Hopefully, some one can give you a website link to a provincial customs website to give you the legal regs. Already looking forward to that first trip to Rainy!! Xplorer"

510991,Guest,2001-02-08 20:09:00,0,"I'm with the Canadian Redneck, buy some from the locals. It is one thing to go in with a full tank of gas in your boat, but to take extra gas is also asking for trouble.I remember the time I had a gas can tip over on me in my boat. It ruined the trip. Now the good news about that, it was way back when I had a 3 wooden seat aluminum boat without a raised floor. What would it do today to my carpet, floor, etc.Besides, if we all buy some from the locals, maybe there won't be as many potholes. :)Fritz"
510992,Guest,2001-02-09 06:56:00,0,"OK, I see I need to explain something. My problem came up this January. I was visiting St. Joseph island Ontario and the Bruce Mine area snowmobiling. There was no premium or ""high test"" fuel available, only 87 octane. A snowmobile runs much better on the good stuff and we didn't have enough octane booster for everyone, (one of the Ski-doo's in our group requires 110 octane). I also go to Rice Lake in the summer and preminum gasoline is not always available on the lake. It is not so much the cost but rather availability and I am also not thinking so much for fishing but rather snowmobiling. I realize this is not a snowmobiling site but I was hoping I could get the legal explination from the fine people that frequent this site.Thanks for the helpFuji"
