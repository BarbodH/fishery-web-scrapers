510995,Guest,2001-02-08 08:31:00,0,It's not.Went there last Saturday and can honestly say I never saw one individual catch a walleye anywhere near me. I was there (just south of the Steam Plant)from 8:00 am till 2pm and did not even get one bite. The river is still dirtier than ever and the ice is about 2.5 to 3 feet thick.
510996,Guest,2001-02-08 15:44:00,0,Was there this past weekend also in selkirk under the power lines and didn't see anyone catch a thing.I had fish in and out of my flasher but didn't hit. tried using everything in the chocolate water that made noise. ice is very broken up also hard to put shanty on ice. Try whitemouth lake. it's very hot right now.
