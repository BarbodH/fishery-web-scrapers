510712,Guest,2001-01-26 09:58:00,0,"My dad and I have gone to Coppens for a number of years. We really like it and the people who run the resort. Syd Coppens is the old man and he's been there forever. His daughter, I don't remember her name, and son-in-law, Ed, actually run the place now, and they are great, too.As far as accomadations, its nothing fancy, but has full kitchens and 3 piece baths. Each cabin has a screened porch overlooking the lake. As far as fishing goes, over the past few years it has really improved because of the slot limits. Last year we were up for a real short weekend, just 2 and a half days of fishing. My dad and I, who are not great fishermen (although hopefully getting better since finding this site), caught good numbers of walleyes. One day when they weren't biting we caught some decent northerns to fillet out for shore lunch (3 fish weighing 12 pounds, perfect size for eating and getting the ""y"" bones out--no guilt about taking a trophy fish out, just good eating).I also had two big fish on. One I never saw, but am still having dreams about. It hit and took my crank bait and ran. I was using a medium heavy spinning rod with 15 lb test line, and I cranked my drag all the way down, but couldn't ever stop the fish. He was on for 60 seconds pulling line out and then in a flash was gone. My guess is I never got a hook set in him. The second time we were in the midst of our best walleye run of our lives--they were literally stacked up and feeding on some baitfish we could see on our depthfinder on a gently sloping rock bar between 22-30 feet of water off Dude island. We caught 23 walleyes in less than two hours. Mostly small, 13-15 inches, but fun nonetheless. Anyway I hooked one and it felt much heavier, so I had my dad get the net. Three times I got the sinker up so I could see it, but the fish pulled me back down. The fourth time, my dad put the net in the water, and a huge mouth opened and released my 13-14 inch walleye and swam away. I had hooked this walleye which then got eaten by a big northern--36-40 inches. The northern had all but the head of the walleye in its mouth and was hanging on while I'm trying to reel it in. When it saw the net, it just let go and we were left with a pretty beat up walleye. I had heard stories about big northerns taking walleyes caught by fisherman, but I thought the were just ""fish stories"". Now I believe, and this year I'm buying my first musky rod taking my shot again. My dad is planning on going back to Coppens for maybe a 2 week stay this summer, and I'm hoping to sneak away for a couple days to join him. I don't have the luxury of living the retired life yet. We are also going to LOTW for our first time ever this year and will be staying at Witch Bay Camp. When we get back I'll post my review on this site.Sorry this was so long, but Coppens has been one of our favorites, and I would encourage anyone to go. The only downside are restricted limits, especially if you want to take fish home with you. We never do, so it doesn't matter to us, but I know for some people its really an issue. If you have any more questions, feel free to e-mail me.Bill"
510713,Guest,2001-01-26 14:05:00,0,"The Fisheries and Coppens are modern, well maintained, full service and have nice owners. In July, if the sun is out, fishing the best in the morning and evening. It can get to be real tough later morning until 4 or 5 pm. If you get some clouds and a breeze the fishing can be good all day. Red Gut will produce the best walleye fishing as it is more typical habitat. For Seine Bay the area around the Seine River, Scott Islands, and just about any reef in the main body of the lake should have July Walleyes. Don't ignore the deep reef tops to 30 to 40 feet surrounded by 90 to 115 feet of water. Long lineing lindy rigs with crawlers can produce big W's. During mid week you will feel like you have a private lake. Very little traffic and lots of room. This end of Rainy is one of my favorite, but the prime time is June. Remember you get one walleye per day if you are a US citizen."
510714,Guest,2001-02-05 13:37:00,0,"THANKS FOR YOUR INFO ON THE EYES. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON SMALLIES AND NORTHERNS TOO? WE FISHED (HOUSE BOAT) THE UPPER (NORTH) PART OF RAINY TWO YEARS AGO AND DID GREAT ON PIKE AND SMALLMOUTH. LAST YEAR WE FISHED OUT OF LABELLS ON THE WEST ARM, BUT DIDN'T DO AS GOOD. SOME SAY THE FISHING WAS POORER BECAUSE OF NUMEROUS COLD FRONTS MOVING THRU THE END OF JUNE. THANKS AGAIN IN ADVANCE.PATHFINDER"
510715,Guest,2001-02-05 14:09:00,0,"I have very little experience with the north arm. In the areas you ask about the smally fishing is best in June when they are up spawning. In July you have to use summer tactics. The populations of smallmouth is good in these areas about anywhere in Swell, and in Siene around the Scott Islands, Bleak Bay and prominent point in the main channel. Pike are gennerlly here and there."
510716,Guest,2001-02-11 00:19:00,0,"I have been traveling from Oklahoma to Coppens for 12 years. There are probably better accomodations elsewhere, but the hospitality is exeptional there. They have always been gratious to us and always willing to lend a helping hand. Plus the fishing gets better every year. At Coppens or Fisheries, you are only short drives away from exelent fishing in Rainy lake. I suggest giving Coppens a try. The Cabbins are clean and very functional for a fishing party. I think you will enjoy your stay there. If you have any specific questions, e-mail me. good luck wherever you fish!"
