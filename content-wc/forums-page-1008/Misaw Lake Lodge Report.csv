The fishings sounds like its even better than 1990 the last time I was at Misaw.How are the cabins and the boats?When we were there the cabins were dinky small cottages.The boats were wooden,handmade by the Indian Guides,ok but not as nice as a Lund or Alumacraft.Did you fly into southend of Wollastan Lake or fly straight to the lodge from Saskatoon or Winnipeg? Anyway thanks for the report I went to Ontario in June and did really well on walleyes.I'm also going on a fly-in to a new lodge out of Thompson Manitoba the 16-24 of August will post results on this website when I get back.Larry S"

513692,Guest,2001-07-07 07:32:00,0,"Guys,we did not spend alot of time on just lakers.My biggest was 23"" ,the camp of 12 guys for the week one was38"" and another was 39''.My boat probaly caught 20-30 for the week most 5-7lbs.Grayling fishing was a little tough because of high fast water,maybe spent two hours with two fish one 15'' one 16.5''.Boats were 14 or 16' Alumacraft 25hsp. 4 stroke with seats and rod holders,not deluxe but moe than adequte.We did use those Indain boats on some of the portage's,more than ok.Cabins were spotless, clean and beds very comfortable.Food was all excellant homemade items.Shore lunches were out of this world.Most guys in this group had been on many fly outs before and said this was the best one.All guides helped and the longest lunch was 1hr15min.,most were1hr and back to fishing.Every one at the camp worked very hard and no one slacked off.What a great time!!One day best 7 fish over 40"" All in the afternoon in less than 3hours.I will be going back I won't even consider any place else.If you need more info I will post my phone # just let me know. Mike"
