513452,duffy,2001-06-26 11:08:00,49,"Eyemadman and Atlanta dave,They do not have a web site yet. They are working on it as we speak. Bob's number is 807-735-3335 in red lake. If you e-mail me at [email protected] I will send you brochures and a video of the place. The cost for a week is $1075.00 and $825 for four days. The cost includes taxes, lodging, fishing on four lakes, boats, motors, unlimted gas, and 135 mile float plane ride. The max people in camp is about 17 to 20. They offer meals and guides for an extra cost or you may cook your own food as all of the cabins have full kitchens and refrigerators. They also fly into into a fifth lake for day fly outs for $100.00 per person. E-mail me if you want more info. Duffy"

513441,duffy,2001-06-21 12:53:00,49,"It was another great trip to way north camp in North western Ontario 135 air miles north of Red lake. The fishing for pike, walleye, and lake trout was terriffic. Between the two of us we caught and released 6 pike over 40"" and around 20 pike in 36 to 39 inch range. The largest pike was 44 inches. The pike were in the shallow flat bays, in last years reed beds, and in wind swept points were weeds were staring grow. The walleye action was fast and furious for fish between 2 and 6 pounds with lots of eyes between 6 and 10 pounds. The walleyes were everywhere!!!! If we fished walleyes all day we could of had 75 to 125 each. The big pike were after Len Thompson #4 five of diamonds spoons. We caught walleye of anything we threw at them including spoons, rapalas, and Jigs with tister tails. One of my best trips ever to Way North. I have canceled my trip to northern Saskatchewan for next year to go back because fishing can't get any better for trophies and it's half the cost. 360 days and counting. Take care."
513442,Guest,2001-06-22 12:48:00,0,"Second the motion on Duffy's report. We had a very similar experience and had a few man eating gators to the boat that had to be in the high 20-30# class, as they dwarfed the 20#'s we did land. I also had a glimpse of the largest walleye I have ever seen (including the hundreds of large Saginaw Bay eyes we have taken here at home).My main lures were the firetiger Johnson Minnow w/ pork bass strip and the #4 Len Thompson platinum white with orange stripe.Our group all had personal bests on northerns and I had a personal best on walleye as well.Great place to fish,lobo"
513443,RMB,2001-06-24 20:09:00,251,"Where did you get the walleyes? On the ""hump"" out in front of camp? I was up there last year and although it was a nice trip the fishing was not good at all. I guess the water was still very high. This was in July. We used their guides and the biggest pike any of 5 of us landed was 9 Lbs. Pretty disappointing to say the least. I fished the ""hump"" every evening religiously and didn't catch a single walleye. Several nice trout but that was all. Did you catch your biggest pike in Favourable in front of the rivers?"
513444,Guest,2001-06-24 23:23:00,0,"The biggest pike we had on the line was at Setting Net and the biggest ones we landed were on Favourable. While on Favourable we did well in the Severn off the south arm, the entrance to the hole in the wall, and the mouth of the Borland.The biggest walleyes we landed (for the most part) were in Favourable but we did get a couple in the 7-8 pound class in S Trout, one of which came near that hump. We also took some nice eyes near camp along the shoreline. For the most part the walleyes were just like the other shield lakes we have been to (in the 15-22"" range) but we did C&R several very nice fish.Too bad you didn't hook into a couple big fish while you were there. It's hit and miss with the big fish. I've been to a couple camps where the fishing was outstanding but there were no signs of any trophy fish after a week of fishing. The crew flying in then tells you all about the dozens of trophy fish they released the year before. Go figure .Where do you go now ?Steve"
513445,duffy,2001-06-25 04:10:00,49,"As you know there are many factors that contribute to good or bad fishing such as weather, time of year, wind direction, etc... Also I usually stay away from July up there because the May fly hatch is usually a problem with the eyes and the pike are in tranisition form the bays to the weeds during the better part of July making it difficult to find them. This year we had pretty good weather and natrual things were happening on the lakes such as minnows schooled in the borland. Last year we had terrible weather and the fishing was okay with just 4 pike over 40 inches for our group of 6. This year we caught many big pike on Setting net in the shallow bays and around the islands in the south end. Favourable produced a few pike over 20lbs in the North arm in the reeds. The bigger walleyes were in the Borland and hole in the wall on favourable as far as I can tell. Pike alley and sand bay were very slow for big fish although we did manage a 37"" pike in sand bay. I must tell you the one ""fish story"". My partner was fighting a 32"" pike on favourable when an estimated 50"" pike came flying out of the reeds mouth wide open and bit at the 32"" fish. It was sight that I will never forget. My buddy had his hands in the water trying to land the 32"" fish when this happened and he turned around to me and said in his best Jaws voice ""we going to need a bigger boat"". LOL. Almost every fish we caught (pike and eye) had bite marks in them. My buddy got a 35 inch pike with half his tail bit off!!!!"
513446,Guest,2001-06-25 06:21:00,0,Can't wait! 7 weeks sees my buddy and I at WayNorth! I've heard quite a few good things and some bad things about this place. But as long as the fish are biting I will be happy. Any time in the Canadian bush is better than sitting in the office anyway!What were your hottest colors for pike/walleye/trout.Thanks. And congrats on a great trip!
513447,Guest,2001-06-25 14:16:00,0,"Duffy and Lobo,ell we made it back! We didn't have the big fish as you did but got into them at times BIG TIME!!!!The Weather for the first four days was what you had last year. In fact Saturday no one went out due to heavy rains and 50 to 60 mile an hour winds. Took until Wednesday to clear up and settle down. Only eyes on Setting Net for us. We started out the day with about 50 eyes in an hour and a half then and front and rain moved in and we couldn't get the northern's to bite at all but ended the day with around 80 eyes each on a bad day!Did get two 38s and a 34 on Wednesday/Thursday. No big eyes through. Our fish were not in the swallows in the north arm and the fish have moved out of the borland river. In fact the fish were in 10 to 12 feet of water in the weed beds. Many small northern in Pike aisle but no bigger ones. Finished the week at Lemonade with 150 fish each and the 34 incher to boot! If we started on northern first up we guees we could have ended the day with 200 to 250 each!!!!! In fact we know for sure we caught one three times in an hour!!!! Now that's turned on.We marked the hump on Friday so everyone else the rest of the year will be able to fish it without trouble. Only caught trout off it this time.Best lures for us, 1) jointed rapalas J11 size in perch or gold/black, 2) spinner baits 1/2 oz green/white skirts with green/char split tails gold or silver blades 3) rattling raps in perch / tenn shad color 4) anything that rattles!!!!!! with yellow or orange!!!!!! Again fish were in 10 to 12 feet of water. Lures need to go around 6 to 8 feet down!!!!Great trip!!!!!!! Took video of many doubles and the 34 incher!!!!!"
513448,duffy,2001-06-26 04:40:00,49,"Hoosier,Glad you had a great trip. Sorry the weather was not so good. How was the staff? Did they get across the portages okay? What cabin were you in and how was it? On lemonade were you catching mostly walleyes or Pike? Was the 34"" a walleye? I am glad that you manged two trophy pike which is not bad considering it seems you were in cold front conditions most of the time. What lake did you get the two 38"" pike on? Were the shiners still bunched up in the borland? I can't wait till next year. I will be going back second full week of June. Are you going back next year? If so maybe can plan on the same week. Please e-mail me some pictures. Talk to you soon.Duffy"
513449,Guest,2001-06-26 08:44:00,0,"Duffy,The portages were fine, No problem with the time we wanted to go and return. All the equipment worked fine.We stayed in cabin #1. Looks like they redid it from last year.The 34 incher was a Pike in Lemonade!Steve is much better as an camp manager than last year but the real key to me is Maurice if you ask me!!!!!! He was always there to help or take us when we were ready.Bob and Connie were a real kick also."
513450,Guest,2001-06-26 09:18:00,0,Is there a website or a phone number to make reservations?ThanksEMM
