513729,Jigger1,2001-07-07 05:37:00,234,"Drove up 502 the morning of June 29th and returned on July 4th. With the exception of a three mile stretch where they were repaving, the road was fine. By the time you head up this should be completed! Saw two moose on the way up and one on the way down!"
513730,Guest,2001-07-07 07:22:00,0,Thank you for the report. Where did you fish?Success?

Our boat of three caught 94 walleyes over the slot in 4.5 days.If you're looking for a great place to stay, check out Silver Water Wheel Lodge at www.sww-lodge.com. It's my second trip there and they run a top notch ship. I'll be visiting them for years!Hope to avoid a front like that one next year!Jigger1"
