513706,Guest,2001-07-09 08:43:00,0,Yes I saw that on the Plummer's website also...not sure what the story is. Maybe they are both waiting for confirmation as to whether it is record or not. Just as you mentioned. I was most excited about the fact that a Canadian caught the fish! What are the odds of that happening at a norther fishing lodge that caters to our friends South of the border.
