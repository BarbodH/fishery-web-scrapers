513734,Guest,2001-07-06 08:12:00,0,JUST WONDERING IF ANY ONE HAS ANY INFO. ON ANY ROAD CONSTRUCTION ON THE HIWAY FROM INTL. FALLS TO KENORA. WE ARE PLANNING TO MAKE THE TRIP NORTH JULY 14th. thanks for any info.
513735,Guest,2001-07-06 16:44:00,0,There was one stretch where they are repaving the hiway. Wasn't anything too terrible though. If your going through during heavy traffic you may have a few minute wait.Good luck!
513736,Guest,2001-07-07 03:40:00,0,"On June 15 they were working in an area around Nestor Falls, like previous post it was only a short (10 minutes) delay. The reward is the paved section is really nice. Good Fishing!"

We're renting a houseboat from LOTW Houseboats in Long Bay and we'll pull our rigs out to the Deadbrook and Cresent island areas. This is our 4th year in a row are we're as eager as ever. If you have a radio and are interested we can share notes (ie. structure, depth, color, presentation, etc.) during the week."
