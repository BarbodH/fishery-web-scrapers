513789,Guest,2001-07-09 03:16:00,0,We are leaving for Cygnet Lake Friday July 20th. Someone responded earlier this year about Cygnet and I was hoping they are still reading posts here. How was the fishing and did you try Swan Lake this year? I would also like to know if Bill and Sam are still there? Any reports would be appreciated. Thanks!
513790,Guest,2001-07-09 09:13:00,0,"was there over memorial day week. fishing was excellent but no big walleyes. 100 walleyes a day on average with 16-20"" sizes.did not make it to swan lake but wanted to. Did spend 1 day at gooseneck and caught some nice 25-31"" northern. Smallies were very slow this year. the water level was 4' higher than normal but should be back to normal when you get there. Bill and Sam are still there but this will be the last year that they run the place. New owners are jacking the price about $100 next year and more the following year. Found a new hotspot that you might want to try. As you come out from the lodge go right. There are two islands to the right,,, in a straight line parallel to the 2 islands head south/south west to the shore line. About 40 feet from shore on the point there is a reef that was loaded with fish. if you catch a 20"" northern with a 9"" lure in this mouth, its mine. did a poor job of tying a not and the rest is history"
513791,Guest,2001-07-09 14:20:00,0,"Thanks for the info. It does not suprise me that the rates are going up. Is the guy that is going to manage the place next year around? I think I know the place you are talking about SW of those two islands we stumbled upon it last year just as we were leaving and did catch some fish there. I have never been to Gooseneck Lake where is it from Cygnet? My Elk hunting buddy wants to catch some good northerns and maybe we ought to try it there. We caught a lot of the fish you describe last year, good eaters but no hogs. I think the biggest walleye I have ever caught at Cygnet was a 23"" fish. My dad caught a 26lbs northern back in the far bay by that cabin. Sorry to see Bill and Sam sell the place but I will wait and see what I think of the new people before I sign up for next year, I'm sure they have to pay for the place and pay a guy to run it.Thanks for your help hope to hear more from you, Email me so I can pick your brain, thanks again.

513792,Guest,2001-07-10 08:26:00,0,"I was there in early June. We caught all the walleyes that we wanted to mainly on the reefs. We did not catch a single decent size pike -- all of them were mostly 20"" long. We tried for them on the reefs, bays and we even trolled some open water. This is the last year for Bill and Sandy. The new owners have increased the prices at least $100.00 for the week and you will lose a day of fishing. Check in will be on Saturday and check out is the following Friday morning. All things considered we had a great trip."
