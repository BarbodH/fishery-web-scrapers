Will be fishing Minnitaki, Pelican, Abrams, etc and wandering the bait, presentation, tactics that will best be suited for this time of year. I'm sure it will be different than in late May when we were there.Any help would be appreciated.eyesnatcher"

Fish seemed to be in 35-40 feet of water on breaks off points and at the mid-lake hump between the cut-thru and Redpine. Did best trolling Frog Rapids at dusk. My best advice would be to hire a guide for one of the first days you'll be there. I've fished with this guide many times, he'll show you where they're biting and on what.http://members.home.net/slguides/"
