I love the variety of fishing with fishing on five diiferent lakes from the base camp. We catch trophy pike and walleyes and lots of small (2 to 10 lb.) trout on two of the lakes. If you like trophy catch and release fishing with comforts of a base camp then Way North is the place for you. It's a combination of outpost and base camp atmosphere as you may cook you own food and if you chose, be by yourself the whole week. I like taking guides with me as I do not like running and controlling the boat. Guides are not needed to find fish. I am a novice fisherman and i would have no problem finding fish all day. Maps are provided. E-mail me with any more questions.Top six reasons I go to way north:1. Lots of trophy size fish2. 100% catch and realese except for shore lunch3. Good boats and motors.4. Variety of fishing on five lakes5. Lots of trophy size fish!!!!6. It's 135 air miles away from the neareast road assuring that there is very little fishing pressure.Good luck.Duffy"
