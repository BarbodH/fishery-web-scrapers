513610,Guest,2001-07-09 04:53:00,0,I think the fishing is much better in Northwestern Ontario or Manitoba than Quebec. My opinion only. I have fished both areas. Good luck and post a report when you get back.
513602,Guest,2001-07-10 17:43:00,0,"i have fished at caesars the last 2 years. i was treated good by oliver, the son,but i dont care for the flying service that flies you to the main lodge. 2 years ago it cost us 195 dollars u.s. just for this flight. i am going to berthelot lodge in 2 weeks. it is 68 miles east of Sennetere. has anyone fished there? are there any other good outfitters in that area?"

513603,Indio,2001-07-04 14:50:00,12,"Have been to Ceasars twice, there is alot to tell. If you want to e-mail i can feel you in indepth. Mostly good for us, but there are things like any trip north you need to know. By the way Benny is retired and his son runs the business, which from what I understand is better. I am around most evenings."
