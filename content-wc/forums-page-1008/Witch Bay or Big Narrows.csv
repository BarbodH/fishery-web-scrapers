513636,ChuckD,2001-07-02 13:35:00,1581,Going to LOTW next year late August. Pretty well narrowed it down to these to lodges Do any of you guys have experince with either. Thanks for the info ChuckD
513637,Guest,2001-07-03 02:55:00,0,"We are leaving 7-7-01 for Witch Bay Camp. This will be oursecond trip to the lodge and as far as I am concerned one of the better places we have stayed at and fished at. Walleye last year was fantastic and they told me last night that it is even better this year. If you can get in to Witch Bay Camp, go for it as I don't think you will be disappointed. Gail and Steve take very good care of their guests. Dock service is second to none. Always some one to meet you or help you depart. Food is excellent."
513638,Guest,2001-07-03 09:01:00,0,"I just got back from Witch Bay. I posted a message with the subject of LOTW Walleye last week regarding the fishing. It was our first time to Witch Bay, and we liked it a lot. The People are great. The rental boats are second to none. The only draw backs I see to the camp are: (1) the toilets and showers are not in the cabins, but are centrally located behind the cabins (not a big deal if its just the guys), and (2) its a big camp (60+ guests at a time). However, the camp is adequately staffed and equipped for that number of guests. We realy liked the fishing program with the pros available to answer questions, and for following out to the walleye reefs in the larger portions of the lake. Plenty of good fishing real close to camp, however. All in all, it was a great time, and I would (and probably will) go back. I have no experience with Big Narrows."
513639,ChuckD,2001-07-04 17:26:00,1581,Ron and Dave Thanks for the info. Their newsletter make it's seem like a great place. The only thing that bothers me is Gail is a little behind with e-mails don't they have a phone up there? Hopefully someone has some info on Big Narrows seems like a decent place but a little smaller
513640,Guest,2001-07-05 02:38:00,0,Gail said that she tried to down load her e-mails but someone tried sending her a very large file and it was taking forever to down load so she stopped. Said that it would have to wait till she got to their home in Kenora to do it.
513641,Guest,2001-07-06 11:40:00,0,"Chuck -- WitchBay is very isolated -- smoe 7 miles from the main road, and they only have radio telephones. Gail is apparently having a tough time getting lines out to post messages, and Marv -- the fishing pro -- is not posting messages like he did last year (couple per week). Don't take the lack of response as lack of interest. I would give Gail a call. I assume you have checked out their web site at Witchbay.com. If not, do so. Good luck."
