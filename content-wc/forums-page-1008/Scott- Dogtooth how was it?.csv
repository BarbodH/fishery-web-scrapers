Must have had a major cold front go through about the time you left. The word of course was that ""you shoulda been here last week."" Ever heard that before? The first morning we headed for Weedy and worked that over and did find quite a few eaters. As you said, when it slowed down I went out deeper and caught a few nice ones along the shore towards the northwest side of the bay. Also caught a few off that rock pile a couple hundred yards north of the reed patch. Went back a couple more times to the area and found zip. The fish were on a major movement. Found it real tough to catch them in the same areas twice. The north side of the narrows going into Weedy was one of better spots we found. I think they were moving out of the bay and heading for the main lake. Lesson learned, keep moving. The smaller fish were going in some of the bays if one wanted to catch them, but we were hunting for the ""one"". We kept moving and hit wind blown points, the couple of times the wind appeared, and found some fish. Then we had our own cold front and the dreaded hatch. Made things kinda tough, but managed a few. We even found a few fish on main lake reefs. It was weird fishing but a good time nontheless. Our biggest fish was 29.5, had a couple more at 29 few 28's few more 27-25's. The ""one"" escapes unscathed once again. We're gonna try it a week earlier next year! Try to beat that whole ""last week"" thing again. Gotta go, Maybe I'll post more later. Thanks for the info and keep in touch!"
