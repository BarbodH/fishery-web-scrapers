6509054,AllenW,2020-12-17 19:30:00,11482,"Ok, did some searching and ended up with a bit of confusion, it's easy at my age. Thinking of fishing LOW next year and as best I can see, if I go into Canadian waters and don't touch land I just need a passport or drivers license or birth certificate. Also a little vague if I need to call a number to tell them I'm coming?? Right/wrong? TIA Al"
6509070,grizzlyone,2020-12-17 20:42:00,225,you need a outdoor card good for three years
6509072,h8go4s,2020-12-17 20:47:00,1673,"You no longer need a RABC permit. As long as you do not anchor or touch land, you can boat in Canadian border waters. You must carry proper ID. Below is a quote of just part of the text in the exception document, go to the link below and read ALL of it.Background The Conveyance Presentation and Reporting Requirements Modernization Act became law on June 19, 2017, thereby enacting new exceptions in the Customs Act to a personâ€™s obligation to present themselves and report their goods to the CBSA when entering Canadian waters. Conditions for a Reporting Exception Persons who enter Canadian waters are not required to present themselves and report their goods to the CBSA if they:do not land on Canadian soil and do not anchor, moor or make contact with another conveyance while in Canadian waters; anddo not disembark or embark any people or goods in Canada.https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-v...tions-eng.html"
6509074,h8go4s,2020-12-17 20:51:00,1673,"The outdoors card is required to obtain any fishing or hunting license. If you're not fishing or hunting, just boating, you don't need it. Obviously, Allen needs it since he'll be fishing."
6509076,AllenW,2020-12-17 20:53:00,11482,"Thanks all, hadn't planned on fishing the Canadian side but my partner for the trip next summer says there's good fishing up there..ok.Never been to LOW so fishing both sides may be fun.Alps...seems their laws/restrictions are as confusing as ours...lol"
6509272,eyecatcher1,2020-12-18 15:18:00,323,"Check to be sure, but I don't think that you can have any live bait purchased in the U.S. in your boat. You probably can't have any beer either."
6509296,stjoeguy,2020-12-18 16:18:00,979,"Good points, eyecatcher1. No beer for sure. Last time we were ice fishing up at the NW Angle, the lodge would kill the minnows on the day we were going to fish in Canada."
6509328,grizzlyone,2020-12-18 18:13:00,225,"can have live crawlers but have to be in paper bedding and no dirt put ur leeches in coke instead of water, they will be dead but stay preserved"
6509350,AllenW,2020-12-18 20:24:00,11482,I suppose next you'll tell me the 1911 has to stay home too? Thanks all Al
