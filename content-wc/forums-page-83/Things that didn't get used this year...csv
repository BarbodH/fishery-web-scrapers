6500220,bus33,2020-11-19 07:51:00,289,My thoughts too. I love my Canada trips but it didn't stop me from fishing.
6500228,RichA$1970,2020-11-19 08:10:00,1159,"Just my Canada Outdoors Card that I hope they extend a year on. I fished MN, WI and the Smithland Pool on the Ohio River in IL that humbled me some but made me work and realize anyone can catch fish in Ontario."
6500236,JDP,2020-11-19 08:21:00,1457,"I hope this changes, and I think/hope it will next year at some point."
6500278,Ricky Spanish,2020-11-19 10:56:00,1298,Missed using Ontario 502 this year.

6502104,Baseline,2020-11-27 06:48:00,3207,"Missed several Canadian trips, but we have plenty of opportunities to fish around northern MN. Did a few trips I haven't done in a long time. Went steelhead fishing in northwestern WI for the first time in 15 years. Made a trip to the driftless area of southeastern MN to do some stream trout fishing on the Root River system using kayaks. First time doing that. Spent more time fishing Lake Superior and we did really good on lake trout. Had to buy some new down-riggers for that. Did some bass fishing on several local lakes which is something I usually don't do. Also made several short trips to Upper Red Lake and Mille Lacs for walleyes. I hadn't been to Mille Lacs for 30 years. It was kind of nice to fish some of the local lakes and have some good success. We did the usual Sturgeon fishing trips to Rainy River on the border. Couldn't enter Canada, but we were looking at it. We also met lots of fishermen who were from several states south of MN who were doing alternative trips. It doesn't look like they are going open the border anytime soon so I'm not going to order my CA fishing license for 2021 or make any reservations. I did get to use my 2020 license twice for ice fishing lake trout in January and early March. Overall it was a decent open water season. Getting ready for the first ice trip next week."
6499586,Pooch,2020-11-16 15:29:00,4618,besides my boat! Rods were bundled in sleeves and ready. Two new reels still in their boxes and waiting. How about you? What did you get in anticipation if the season before the border closed? Hoping for some resemblance of normalcy in 2021. Pooch
6499594,johnboat,2020-11-16 15:59:00,2014,"My year Ontario fishing license I bought while on a Wolf Hunt/Ice Fishing trip in January of 2020.Oh well, I at least kept my Canada fishing streak intact."
6499694,BornToFish,2020-11-17 06:03:00,1224,"Greetings, Pooch: You posed an interesting thought. I typically look through new fishing catalogs when they come out early in the winter for ""new to me"" ideas for making lures. It could be a ""new to me"" jig style, type of hook, color scheme, combination of materials or whatever. I then make up a bunch of the ""new to me"" lures/jigs during the winter or early spring when there is little else to do. It could be a new type of jig, bucktail or spinnerbait. I did the above in the winter months of 2020. I have a bunch of newly painted jigs that never saw the water in 2020. Thus, I can this winter off as I am already good to go in 2021. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6499700,rosh1,2020-11-17 07:07:00,275,"My boat, it came in march and I don't think I have more then an hour on it. My cottage thank God for good neighbors that took care of it for me. New poles from Elliot rods. My 45-70 for bear hunting and my 25-06 for wolf season. I better stop before it makes me more depressed then I am already. Stay safe."
6499708,Bill Krejca,2020-11-17 07:18:00,6107,"Boat, rigged and ready to go rods/reels, small amount of left over grocery items. Finally got out my ""dough boy"" cold weather floatation suit for local fishing trip. Also left over/gone was an over extended trip anticipation expectation - it, like a just bought ice cream cone on a hot day, quickly melted away as the summer was lost. Bill"
6499728,Eckohlt,2020-11-17 08:05:00,3685,"A lot of fresh new 100$ bills didn't get used,sad to say,they were ready to go to the outfitters"

6499888,pjshorthorn,2020-11-17 16:42:00,5654,A lot of hand tied spinner baits and a few new spoons..... not a big deal. I have time to use them next year. I hope !!! PjShorthorn
6499904,JAY221,2020-11-17 17:57:00,877,"On the new side would be a trolling motor and fish finder and a bunch of lures. God willing I will be around next year. Later, Jay"
