I have dragged it several poles, and an occasional bait which had been snagged on the bottom. Perhaps somewhat unusual was an old green net finish Dardevle spoon which I found on shore in a portage-in lake trout lake. The spoon was just laying on the shore - why? Perhaps a fish was once attached, it floated to shore and the fish was consumed? Also found a floater Rebel crank bait laying on a rock in another portage-to lake. I figured this one was thrown by a hooked fish, after breaking the line, and the wind carried it up onto the rock. I pulled a floating bait in on O'Sullivan Lake which had a small piece of lip, I'd guess pike, attached. Bill"
5981826,last chance,2018-02-03 07:48:00,3262,was fishing the headwaters of the east fork down on dale hollow and hooked a like new zebco 1 and rod. got back to east port dock and was told some others guys was up there when the water was up and turned the boat over. lost all the tackle and rods and reels. but the best one was while fishing a bridge down in ft pierce fl i hooked and reeled in a bicycle. was fishing Manistee lake in Michigan and reeled in a very old bow. wish now i had had it checked out to see if it had any value.
5981866,andreindy,2018-02-03 08:16:00,308,"Bill is probably right. Fisherman, particularly walleye fisherman, can cover a great deal of bottom dragging area. Odds are that SOMEDAY, whatever is down there WILL get snagged. As a kid I remember a very popular dam in the downtown part of the city. Water was always like coffee...you could only see a few inches down. Folks from all walks of society would flog that water. And all of them, I know, would lose plugs to snags. Uncommonly so. Years later, on a local chat forum reminiscing about the place and the unbelievable snag rate, a salty old-er fisherman made a confession to me in a PM...he had intentionally dropped some heavy chain fencing in strategic places. He would then go in and harvest the baits...lots of antique lures he said...""their grandpa's lures"" is what he called them. I always wondered how the Fishing Gods were going to deal with that guy."

5981906,NARDA 1,2018-02-03 08:25:00,636,Was fishing on Eagle Lake in Vermilion Bay jigging for walleye using a Lindy Rig with a tail hooked minnow. I felt the hit and set the hook and immediately thought I lost the fish. I reeled in to check my bait and found this lip hooked on my Lindy Rig! I figured a feeding walleye hit my bait and when I set the hook I hooked the small perch that was already in it's mouth.
5981914,andreindy,2018-02-03 08:25:00,308,"On that note, I vividly remember snagging my first snapping turtle as a pretty young kid. My kid brain remembers it as ENORMOUS. Probably really wasn't. Lots of whooping and hollering when it got to shore. 2nd piece to that memory was I with a best childhood friend Tony when it happened. Tony's gone now, took some wrong turns later and took his own life. Good friend then."
5981994,GBS,2018-02-03 08:51:00,2271,"And, the small perch tale reminded me - fishing Reed Lake in Manitoba. No live bait, using preserved fatheads on a jig. Felt the ""tap"" and set the hook, but no joy. Reeled in to check the bait. Yep, minnow was still there, hooked through the nose. WAIT! IT WIGGLED! Dead minnow was gone, replaced by one the exact same size, except it was some kind of native ""stickleback"" type, with sharp pointy fins. I released it. Figured something that ""pointy"" would never catch a fish...."
5982010,Wall-i-Lama,2018-02-03 08:53:00,1524,"Last summer on LOTW, we were slow trolling for lake trout with rigs in 90 to 95 foot of water. The rig consisted of aluminum keel (homemade), 12oz ball sinker, 6 foot leader and spoons. Snagged something that feels like a small fish, but without the head wabble. Got everything to the top, only to see a 6"" doctors spoon (half silver, half blue) hooked to the end of my lure, Swedish pimple laker taker. I told my wife, ""free tackle, I used to have one like that!"" She replied, I'm sure a lot of people have one like that. I pulled up the leader, the the aluminum keel (homemade) and finally, the 12 oz weight that was painted lime green. When we saw the weight we realized instantly, it was our rig as all my weights are lime green and hers are pink. We had to think about it for awhile, but realized we lost that rig 4 years earlier! Yep, we lost and then we found our own rig, in LOTW deep water. What are the odds? Retired the lure, and its hanging on my wall."

I few minutes later, my fly hooked one of the hooks on her lure and I landed the bass and gave her her lure back."

5981450,andreindy,2018-02-02 20:18:00,308,"Last year on O'Sullivan Lake in the Nakina area my son was reeling in his line and brought up a crusted Shakespeare spinning combo, hooked on the very last guide. I have no idea why I still think about this from time to time, but I do. Like now, when its 15 F out and I'm happily adding jigs and spoons to my online shopping cart. I was astonished, (He wasn't that impressed) if by nothing more than the mathematical odds of snagging a lost rod, on a very large body of water. IN THE CANADIAN WILDERNESS. My hunch is that it is less likely to occur than rolling a 6 eight times in a row (some of the only perspective I got...helped my son in algebra this last month). Years ago at Cass Lake in Minnesota, I jigged up a rubber band from 15 feet of water in which my hook had actually penetrated the skinny band itself. The odds of THAT has to be extremely unlikely. But MORE likely than my wife allowing me to go to Canada TWICE yearly."
5981458,drexje,2018-02-02 20:43:00,18,I'm with you that the odds are not in your favor but it maybe happens more often than reported. 2 years ago my son hooked an old pool cue Shakespeare Rod with a very old Mitchell 300 on it in 30 ft of water jogging for Walleyes. This was on a fly in portage lake off the outpost camp we were on 175 miles north of RedLake. I'd bet it doesn't see more than half a dozen fisherman at most per year.I do the same thing you do and think about it often. I hung it on the porch of the cabin. I've been blessed to haven't miss a year at that camp for 42 years. I'm looking forward to seeing our 72 trophy catch again in August this yearSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
5981466,Pooch,2018-02-02 20:46:00,4618,"There are a lot of fishing gear on the bottom of all lakes in Canada. I can think of several rod & reels lost from groups that I have been with, plus the stories around camp.My story? OK. Several years ago there were four boats in our group fishing Lac Seul. One boat owner placed his brand new St. Croix spinning rod and brand new Shimano reel in a rod holder and moved to another location about five miles away. Well they get to the new spot and the new rig is gone. To say he was heart sick would be an understatement.Two days later one of our other boats snags and brings up a brand new St. Croix and Shimano spinning reel rig. They were jig fishing the same area of OPEN water where the other boat had been fishing just before losing the rod and reel. While jigging they caught our cabin mates new rig.Please tell me the odds of that happening?! Finding it in the first place and one of your cabin mates is the one to hook and recover it? This was in twenty five foot of water on a drop off. I told the guy who lost the rod and reel that he needed to put the value of the recovered rod and reel into the church offering when they got home.Had I not seen it I would never have believed it.Everyone catches ""stuff"" off the bottom on occasion. There for a while I had picked up lost spinner rigs, wads of mono some fool threw overboard, corroded old spoons for some reason were my specialty there for a couple years.It's like Christmas in some areas of a lake that get fished regularly.Pooch"
5981474,BornToFish,2018-02-02 20:50:00,1224,"Greetings,As a child, I was given a ring by my dentist for being a ""good"" patient. I wore that ring while swimming at my aunt's cottage. The ring fell of my hand that afternoon and was lost. I hooked that same ring a few days later while casting a Daredevle off the end of the dock. I don't remember if the ring caused my fingers to turn green.A few years ago, I had a anchor rope slip from my boat's cleat while fishing on Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin. I recorded a waypoint so I could come back to the same area the next day. It took about thirty minutes of casting a jig with my musky rod to hook the anchor line. That catch saved me about $100 for the anchor, chain and line.My wife hooked an anchor line a few years ago casting for northern pike while on vacation in NW Ontario. She thought she had a giant pike on for a little while, as it did put up a good fight! It turns out that another guest had lost that anchor earlier in the week, so he was relieved to not have to pay for it!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5981498,GBS,2018-02-02 21:19:00,2271,"About 4 years ago on Kabetogama, we were pulling spinners. The bite was fair to good. Felt the usual ""tap"", gave line, then set the hook. Kinda sluggish, no real fight, but nothing that would make me think it was anything other than a smallish walleye. Get it up to the boat and as it was netted, noted it was very odd looking. Get it aboard, and it was walleye skull with some decaying flesh on it, backbone, boney fins, and green skin hanging off of the remains of the body. Hooked perfectly in the corner of the jaw. Since then, we are very, very careful when we go out about making sure we are prepared to fight off the zombie walleye apocalypse."
5981514,IL-Rebel,2018-02-02 21:33:00,349,"Many years ago. Forget the MN lake, but fishing with my father. He pulled up a soaking wet winter parka. Before giving it much thought, unhooked it and let it sink back to the bottom. No body inside, but was still creepy."
5981522,andreindy,2018-02-02 21:54:00,308,"Correct on your spinning rod!!!....those odds are even less likely than me finding a needed screw (size, thread, metal type) from my accumulated bucket-of-random-screws.

5981538,Beer King,2018-02-03 00:35:00,146,"My brother broke off a jig in rocks 20ft plus deep, one of my jigs of course. 3 days later fishing the same area he pulls up that lost jig (unique, so knew it was same one) - Tip of his jig hook caught the lost one perfectly in the eye, it had broken off at the knot. Was not where he hooked broken off line. It was one of those are you kidding me moments. Dan"
5981610,fishsammich,2018-02-03 05:47:00,169,"My brother snagged a couple times while fishing at the **** for walleye last spring......he kept snagging in the same spot so I told him not to just keep cutting the line but bring the snag up and get rid of it. He finally did. It was a boat anchor line, complete with an anchor and tons of hooks, lures, etc......ironically, he lost an anchor of mine years earlier so I kept the anchor he snagged, so now he just owes me a good anchor rope yet."
5981650,Paul H,2018-02-03 06:26:00,1232,"I've hooked 2 or 3 old rods/reels over the years. At least one was in the wilds of the Great White North. I can't even remember all the odd crap though. One that stands out though. Again in Canada, hooked what I thought was a decent walleye, I was in a narrows section of a flowage with some current, around 20' of water, fought like crazy. Turned out to be an old, stinking, hunk of skin. Pretty large and assumed it was moose but could have been beaver. I did not really try to determine. I was bass fishing a strip mine pond with a friend from the bank, broke off (worm hook). A few days later, the same friend handed me the hook back... Around a 10-15 acre pond and he was on the opposite side. Pretty unique style of hook and line so it was mine. Snagged 1/2 of a Moose rack in shallow water once, could see what it was (after assuming it was a stick) and retrieved it by hand and net."
