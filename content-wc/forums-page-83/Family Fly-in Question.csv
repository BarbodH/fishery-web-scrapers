6301906,Jeler,2019-03-20 06:43:00,92,"It's actually ""5 Mile Lake Lodge"" https://www.fivemilelake.com/chapleauoutpostcamps.htm"
6301908,acplumber,2019-03-20 06:46:00,80,"Yes it is, oops."
6301954,Jeler,2019-03-20 09:22:00,92,No big deal! What's another mile? Minor error.Have a great day.BTW-It does look like a great cabin & lake!
6302004,MrSimon,2019-03-20 12:49:00,922,"In case anyone else is doing similar research, both White River Air and Air Dale got back to me with friendly responses and both are very accommodating to families. It's still expensive, but airplanes cost money to fly, even for kids. White River even said my third and fourth kids would go free. Which makes sense cause they are little. Heck, the two little ones could probably be considered luggage for my two older kids, and still be under the 100lb limit. I still appreciated the gesture. How an outfitter responds to inquiries isn't always the best way to rate them, but a friendly and thorough response goes a long way in my book. Some of the outfitters just replied, ""check our website for prices"". Doesn't mean they don't have good lakes/cabins, but they won't get my business."
6302052,adempsey2.0,2019-03-20 14:46:00,611,"As much as a fly-in would be an amazing family trip, I just don't think it is worthwhile with such a big family and small children. Maybe if you had some help with parents or in-laws, but young kids need a lot of attention. I always found it best to go somewhere where other families with kids also go. Kids love to play together and I have fond memories of meeting new people when I went away to a camp or cottage. So, I would strongly recommend finding a drive-to lodge with a nice beach and pontoon boats. Pontoon boats are amazing with a family. Young kids can fish, play or sleep. There is a cover to get out of the sun and a nice cushioned seats. Usually a ladder out back to do some swimming as well. Still not an inexpensive venture, but I think everyone would have a much better time."
6302078,Jeler,2019-03-20 15:42:00,92,"Sounds like you received a couple excellent inquires from different out-fitters! Excellent, you know your kids better than any of us and they'll remember and talk about their fly-in experience for ever! Have a great time and keep us posted. Photos will be great too!"
6302326,MrSimon,2019-03-21 06:28:00,922,"I don't disagree with anything you said. But, we've done the drive-to thing many times, have spent countless hours on our pontoon boat, go tubing with friends all summer, and most of my kids are better at fishing than I am. It's time they get to experience how special a Canadian fly-in is."
6302612,adempsey2.0,2019-03-21 17:03:00,611,"I hope I did not come off as judgemental or from a position of seemingly knowing what is better for you or your family. I certainly did not mean to suggest anything like that. I was just envisioning what it would be like having to contend with a situation like yours and what would make sense for me. As someone mentioned, you know your family best. Twin Lakes Outiftters also has some lakes that might be suitable. Prices are reasonable.Deep Wilderness Outposts on Gzowski Lake is also relatively inexpensive.Hope you find something that works for you!"
6303958,MrSimon,2019-03-25 07:04:00,922,No worries! I will check out those suggestions. Thanks!
6505716,kim n indiana,2020-12-08 17:30:00,62,"i looked into this once also. its up 129, and about directly across from Wabus lake where i did go once. cabin looks great as it is on little island on east side of lake. i tried to book it once, but they had no openings. like 2017 i think. maybe 2018. somewhere i read that like alot of lakes in that area, its accessible by ATV due to logging, and being fished by locals alot. but its a big lake, and supposedly has big walleye in it."
6300100,MrSimon,2019-03-15 07:09:00,922,"All 4 of my kids are just about old enough to go on a fly-in as a family. My wife even said she'd go. But, taking 6 people on a fly-in sounds REALLY expensive. Are there any outfitters who have good family rates? Preferably out of Wawa, Hawk Junction, or White River. Thanks."
6300128,adempsey2.0,2019-03-15 08:06:00,611,"A few good value options:Kaby Kabins has 50% off 3 to 16yoKay Vee Lodge has 50% off under 16yo in July/AugBuck & Bingwood has 50% off 14yo and underAir Dale has good rates, no discounts posted but I would call them and see what your options areWhite River Air has 50% <16yoBrace Lake Outfitters has 50% off <12yo and 25% off 12 to 17yoLeuenberger offers family rates after July1Probably more, those are just what came to mind"
6300146,vteye3,2019-03-15 08:24:00,496,"I would call the outfitter explain your situation and ask them to price your trip. Suggest reviewing outfitters camps that fit your needs: showers, toilets, electronics etc andplay lets make a deal w/outfitter. Logistically a concern is what type of aircraft is outfitter flying and how far. Expect a max weight. Suggest getting a Satelite phone will keep the mrs happy. Outfitters want the camps full its just a matter of selling your family"
6300376,prov1800,2019-03-15 15:05:00,5010,That will be a expensive week.Not sure what the going rates are there.Around here in the vermilion bay area your looking at a 1000 pp and they have deals for 900.
6300468,Fishquest,2019-03-15 19:58:00,89,Contact White River Air and explain the family trip and they'll come up with a good rate for you.
6300486,pwbmlr,2019-03-15 21:03:00,37,"Call Brandi or Dan at White River. They will take care of you. I have gone with them the past 6 yrs. Always great times. If u go in August you can probably get either Shekak or Pickle lake. Both are fully plumbed with inside shower and toilets. I took my 12yr old daughter to pickle a few yrs ago and she loved it. Easy walleye and pike fishing. No big fish but that wasnt the point. This yr I am taking her back to white river this time to Shekak. This will be my 3rd yr back to that lake. It is a great lake for that region. This lake is loaded with pike. You can pike fish and easily catch 50 pike a day per person. Most in the 27-32 inch range.My groups in the past have pulled several 40"" pike, a lot of 30's and every yr we get at least a 28"" walleye. Plus, that lake has some huge yellow perch in it. I mean like 14""! If you pick either lake message me and I will put a map together for you. Either way, Dan and Brandi run a great business and they are very easy to work with. Good luck! Paul"
6301282,MrSimon,2019-03-18 06:25:00,922,Great replies! Thank you all. White River Air was already top on my list. Man their cabins look amazing.
6301478,Jeler,2019-03-18 17:14:00,92,White River Air https://whiteriverair.com/ does look amazing! I think it sounds like a great family vacation no matter what it cost! The memories you will create will be priceless! Great way to spend a week with your family!Keep us all up to date on your plans! I for one am excited for you!My wife and I finally convinced my wife's son to join us on a fly-in! I can not wait!Jeff in Iowa
6301482,acplumber,2019-03-18 17:37:00,80,"Hi I'd suggest calling Leuenbergers in Nakina. I have the same amount of kids and he offered a really good deal for the summer time. He has some really good locations, some with a beach at the cabin which is a plus for sure"
6301588,acplumber,2019-03-19 05:03:00,80,"Also we did a fathers/sons trip 2 years ago in chapleau with six mile lake lodge to wenebegon lake. It’s the only cabin on a huge lake. It’s a boat in. David and his wife are really great people to deal with. It’s definitely a cheaper option compared to fly in. It was a great trip to. But fishing is way easier in nakina then Algoma area, but algoma is six hrs closer....."
