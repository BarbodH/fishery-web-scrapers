6506864,jimwalleye,2020-12-11 18:53:00,30,"I was wondering what the fishing was like on the Rainy River the last week of May and the first week of June as compared to Rainy Lake. I understand that you could catch some sturgeon in the river at that time. Are the walleyes in the river that time of the year spawning? It appears that Lake of the Woods is one big bay if you ventured out, Traverse Bay if I recall. I've never fished that area but looking for an alternative to Canada. Do you primarily just fish the river in the spring if you chose the River option or is there lake opportunities as well. What would be the better fishing experience. I also have a wife that doesn't fish coming along so wondering about resorts. Point me in the right direction, the River or the Lake. Any feedback as to what I might expect would be appreciated. Thanks,"

6506972,That Minnesota guy,2020-12-12 07:40:00,8293,Go to In-Depth Outdoors (IDO) and scan the reports for the time period you intend to go. They have quite a few guys who do reports over there. Should help answer some of your questions.

It's A big lake with lots of structure including many hazards a map chip is absolutely necessary. I strongly recommend a guide your first day or two. There is a learning curve! If Canada is open you want to fish both sides. Check out Thunderbird Lodge as a base both cabins and motel rooms, great restaurant and bar on site along with safe docking. Pm me for guide recommendations if interested. Wayne"

If the weather is poor or too windy, you will still find a some walleyes in the river, but that time of year you can still catch plenty of fish just into the lake around Pine Island. It isn't a very long boat ride to get into the main lake."
