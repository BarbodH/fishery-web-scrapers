6507456,clawman,2020-12-13 17:11:00,2078,When I bass fished a lot they had a little slit cut into them for the hook. That was in the 80-90 so that may have been a new feature then. I'd take something hard and pound the hE[[ out of them and they would get very soft and alive looking. Swimming a black and blue jig through reeds was awesome at the right time of the year.
6508654,1100 Remington Man,2020-12-16 15:15:00,73,"I have used pork rind years ago, I used the ones that were black and looked liked leeches and yes I caught fish but the live minnows worked better. I thought this would be great because they don't tear off and worked fine jigging just not as productive as live bait. In my experience."
6508664,jambi,2020-12-16 15:29:00,504,"Someone posted this link on another site: https://www.acmetackle.com/products/...3401232195670# NEW FOR 2020-2021 The #11 Original Pork Frog the world's most popular rind pattern is back!

6508876,prov1800,2020-12-17 07:52:00,5010,Everything about smallies depends on time of year and water temps like every other fish.Iam not into bringing a big tackle box along so i use a few lures only in a hand sized tackle box.Most of my guests laugh at it.Spring time smallies is about the only time i actually use a few of them.pre spawn and spawn it tiny torpedos and poppers if those just arent doinf it then i go to a tube or shallow cŕank bait.Thats it. Will use those still after the spawn but as water warms ill go back to a jig and a fat minnow and get bass and walleyes in same areas for a while.Just have to adjust weight as water warms.
6509438,clawman,2020-12-19 08:52:00,2078,OMG 12. for 3 pork rinds!!
6506316,Pooch,2020-12-10 11:33:00,4618,"The last jar of Uncle Josh pork rinds I had rusted the lid off and I threw them away. That was many years ago. Not sure what all they used as a preservative, but it ate metal lids. Didn't know you could even buy them anymore.Pooch"
6506340,andersaki,2020-12-10 15:05:00,1426,"We used to use Uncle Josh pork rinds on our bass jigs (jig 'n a pig). They were tougher than rawhide. I'd have to bring the awl out of my toolbox to get a hole started to get it on the hook. Lord help you if you left the pork on the hook, it'd dry so hard you may as well throw the jig away. These days plastic is much easier to deal with. Bass loved 'em though. Mark"
6506366,Husker525,2020-12-10 16:11:00,720,I was thinking the same thing last night while reading this thread. Well said ^^^^^^^. I often wondered why I never saw it on the shelves anymore. I just figured all the scented plastics had become more popular. Ever had a Jig and Pig weld itself to the bottom of your Plano tacklebox? LOL
6506412,prov1800,2020-12-10 18:04:00,5010,Another great piece of bait is the gulket from a walleye.mooks kike a piece of pork rind. Also legal and will last all day and better take it off at the end of the day or you'll be fighting with it the next.
6506556,Bill Krejca,2020-12-11 06:41:00,6107,"Yeah gullet was (still is?) a standard bait in Sask., when I used to go there. Really tough, used a lot when casting on a jig. One piece can last all day. If cut right, the piece can be made into a ""V"", or 2 pieces can be created by cutting down the middle. Rules on fish parts seem to change, depending on province and year. A chunk of walleye was a great still fishing bait for lake trout in Sask, back when I used to go there. Bill"
6506572,prov1800,2020-12-11 07:31:00,5010,Bill to this day i use it for perch.They cannot get it of the hook.lol.
6506650,Golden Eagle,2020-12-11 10:10:00,2642,"I check daily for a butchered pike in the fish cleaning house, so I can get a pike gullet for tipping my JSM. A 26 incher gives me at least 2 nice strips of gullet."
6506674,RichA$1970,2020-12-11 10:52:00,1159,Prov1800 What’s the best Jumbo Perch lake in your area?
6506684,kswalleyer,2020-12-11 11:02:00,1651,"think they stopped making it 5 years ago. great bait, w e used to thrww them in weed beds on a johnson weedless silver minnow for pike"
6506708,prov1800,2020-12-11 12:54:00,5010,Not that iam a perch guy but when i have to be id still have to say Cedar i do best and can get some good ones.The other lake would have to be Clay Lake. But dont go often.But there are definatly some big perch there.Trick is to definatly not fish spots on camp maps. I think all our lakes have good perch in them jùst everyone fishes same spots so they get over fished.if i get into a school and tend to all be small ill move over a bit until i find a school of larger ones. Depending on time of year.
6506110,Bigtaproot,2020-12-09 18:56:00,900,Have any of you ever tipped a jig with pork rinds. As a kid many years ago it was our go to bait for northern Sinai minnesota
6506120,RichA$1970,2020-12-09 19:31:00,1159,I remember my dad and uncles always having a glass jar of Uncle Josh’s pork rinds in their tackle boxes. We’d cut them n out them on chartreuse jigs for jumbos. I think they called it quits around 5 years ago.
6506126,Huntindave,2020-12-09 19:57:00,2194,"Funny you should ask, I'm munching on a bag of pork rinds right now. It has been a long time ago, but I have in the past, tipped a Johnson Silver Minnow Spoon with a pork rind."
6506178,kettyspanky,2020-12-10 03:52:00,271,Uncle Josh's was a great bait for Perch at lake winnibigosish. I've tried it in Canada every year and catch a few but not many. I wish it would work better because it's lasts longer.
6506180,The tank,2020-12-10 04:09:00,340,A few years back they came out with a Canadian night crawler. It work real good on a bottom bouncer and a spinner on LOWS Didn't try them on a jig. Its was a week in the 90s so I mostly troll when its that hot.
6506210,Bill Krejca,2020-12-10 06:21:00,6107,"They work nicely as a waving attractor on baits such as spoons and jigs, as long as the bait is being cast. A potential problem arises, however, if used with a jig for vertical fishing. I have found that the rind has a repeatable tendency to impede the hooking when/if a bite occurs. It seems to overlap and stick on the hook point, now making the jig ""weedless"", this happens with enough regularity that I will not use rind at all when fishing vertically. A better substitution, where legal, seems to be a strip taken from offal(fish flesh intended to be discarded from part of the cleaning process). It is a little softer and tends not to get stuck on the hook point. Bill"
6506224,Golden Eagle,2020-12-10 07:00:00,2642,"I have a limited supply of 5"" Uncle Josh pork rinds that I use on 1 1/8"" JSM when fishing for pike, but they are no longer available. 5"" power grubs work well, but this fisherman likes seeing the action of a red 5"" pork rind. - better. I don't believe pike have a preference."
6506230,prov1800,2020-12-10 07:10:00,5010,Have never used pork rinds.When ever i fish for lake trout and ckean them i always cut away the belly meat and save that in baggies so i always have some available.These strips can be cut to any size later for any fish your after.I have used them on every species but mainly use them on crappies and lake trout if i dont have any life bait.
6506234,bigwalleye1,2020-12-10 07:14:00,2632,"Is the use of game fish parts legal in Canada? I know in MN, if it has a limit in the regs, it's considered a ""game fish"" and can't be used, in whole or in part, as bait."
6506236,prov1800,2020-12-10 07:22:00,5010,Some years ago i asked a game warden that question and he said i could.So have been using the belly meat for years. In spring when the suckers run i go get some of them to which are bait fish.But i like the thin skinned trout bellys as tgey can be trimmed to really flow nice as you troll them and jig them.
