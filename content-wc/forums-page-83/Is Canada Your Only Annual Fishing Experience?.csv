6500354,Barley,2020-11-19 18:25:00,10,"My family settled in the Kansas City area in the late 60s. As an early teenager I got my dad interested in fishing just by catching little bass and bluegill off a dock at a nearby park. Now, 51 years later, I'm still living in the same area and am close to abandoning fishing in my immediate area. Other than privately owned strip pits located southeast of KC, I've almost given up fishing locally. The State of Kansas has the most archaic conservation laws in the country. When I take my bass boat to local reservoirs I find jug and trot lines strung along the best shorelines, preventing real sport fishing. I see rednecks with stringers of legal largemouth bass removing the lakes precious resources from local lakes. Kansas has to be the worse place to fish in the entire country. The nearest reservoirs and those in the Missouri Ozarks are so over-run with ski-boats and jet-skiers that fishing is a waste of time. My wife and I go North every year to get away from crowds and we still run into conservation laws that cater to meat fishing more than sport fishing. Why do lawmakers continue to establish limits that deplete the most valuable resources so that so-called sportsmen can fill their already ample bellies? For example, we found a fly-in several years ago to lake in Ontario where the smallmouth fishing was incredible. It took only three years for the fishing there to be completely decimated by groups that would keep dozens of breeders, caught and eaten during the spawn, to ruin the lake. Thinking outside the lines, we have been able to find a unique location to fish where catch and release policies have greatly sustained the fish populations. I'm sure this won't last so we've been looking further and further north to find a truly world class environments that could easily be found closer to home if only our legislatures were not so influenced by fat-assed deep frying Bubba's."
6500362,kswalleyer,2020-11-19 18:59:00,1651,"What? Im not sure how far you are going or what reservoirs you are talking about, but I live in Kansas City and disagree with just about every word of this post. We have some of the best fishing for all species on each side of the state line within 150 miles if you throw in Pomme for Muskies. 225 miles gets you to a ton of great water in Northern Arkansas...As far as going north...Maybe a few places like Mille lacs right now for walleyes are struggling...but the fishing is pretty good anywhere up there. Fly-in Smallmouth fishery getting fished out? Really? where was that? There is a walleye tournament that happens VERY close to KC every spring, it takes a 1 day bag of 25-30 lbs to even have a shot....I guess its in the eye of the beholder...."

Local NJ lakes- I have about 9 within an hour 1 way, all highway drivingMultiple trips to the Adirondacks, NY each year:2 weeks each July on Lake GeorgeMay & October weekends on Black LakeTrying to make time for Hudson River stripers during May again in '21, in either Kingston or Albany& a few insane day trips to Saratoga Lake (around 5 hrs driving round trip)- a ""day trip"" means I'm up at 1a, launching at 530a & back home around 11p or so-- exhausted, swearing I'll never do it again, have some amnesia--- 'cuz I do it a few times each year! That's pretty much my yearHow often? ... Ice out til the end of October, I'm out every other weekend with a rod in my hand. On the boat July & August every other weekend when my kids call it a ""tubing boat that's ocassionally used for fishing"". When the temps drop into the low 40s, upper 30s, shorter days out & maybe 1 day a month. Winter if roads are dry & lakes are launchable, I'll target lakers just to be on the boat mostly(I did take 10 yrs off from fishing post-divorce to focus on my kids growing up...they're 13 now & I'm on season 2 being back with what I love doing)Happy fishing!!"

Been dere, just ain't done dat dere."

For 2021 Iâ€™m planning a spring trip to Minnesota, Leech & Cass lake & a Canada trip to Cedar lake in August. I occasionally fish Erie & I spend several days fishing a few local lakes."

Generally try to go a couple times a week. This year would have been our first Canadian trip in over 30 years. Now waiting till next October."

It's interesting as there are a few variables in my opinion Lake Size, Lake Pressure, Lake Type But without knowing where the angler is going I would say put in the time researching I am always amazed at the information thats out there - before our Ogoki trip I found a years old thread on a city of Toronto tourism board that had some great info that really helped So for me use the tools available - google is your friend, so is google earth and youtube Have a rough game plan for area's, tactics and structure that you want to hit before you even arrive Cheers Andrew"

6503264,Lmbkiller,2020-12-01 20:04:00,639,"I fish around 300+ days a yr, Canada included. If I only fished a week a yr and it was in Canada, how would I ever know how good Canada truly was?"
6503600,elway12,2020-12-02 21:36:00,335,"Unfortunately, I seldom fish here in my home state of AZ, though there are some great places to do so. My passion is Canada. I fishing up there once every 4 and NOW 5 years!...ok sometimes it's been every other year But to me it's not just about the fishing it's the whole Canada fishing trip experience: the planning, packing, flying, driving, the stories, the traditions, loons, bears, shore lunch, the smells, the scenery. I am sure glad I have W.C. and Borger's fishing trip videos to curb my cravings in the years between times!"
6499882,pjshorthorn,2020-11-17 16:21:00,5654,"I've done 10 years of HB trips on the NE Section of Lac Seul. One day I want to get back to that experience again. As you said it is a blast, with the HB being home base. Just run to spots each day with your personal boats or rentals. Come back for dinner and fish off the back of the HB until your Heart is content. I've been the pilot 8 of those trips and just loved seeing the lake that way. Send me a message and I can help you out with suggestions and fishing spots. It is not quite the fly experience, but it is a close second if you like the isolation of your cabin being on the water. The best news is that there is no weight limit PjShorthorn"
6499886,pjshorthorn,2020-11-17 16:37:00,5654,"For many years Canada has been the only fishing trip I took each year ( 1 week ). All the reasons most people have. Family, job, vacation time and resources always were a limiting factor. Now I have been trying to take at least two trips a year in the early summer and then fall. Of course 2020 presented challenges to all of us with getting to Canada. I was planning on 3 trips......opening week, Sept and then October. Since those trips couldn't take place, I replaced them with..... Lake Erie in early July Lake Kabatagoma and Namaken in mid Sept. Lake St. Clair in October Lots of trout fishing trips were mixed in throughout the year in the North GA mountains which are always beautiful trips exploring new places. Although I thoroughly enjoyed all my stateside trips this year. Canada is where I want to be in 2021.....two trips are planned and if a third one presents itself , who knows !!! PjShorthorn"
6499908,kswalleyer,2020-11-17 18:04:00,1651,"I fished MN and Canada a lot as a kid living in IA. I now have a bucket list I try to hit a new lake or 2 each year...last 3 years...Kab, Devils lake, Spirit Lake IA(never fished it growing up, now have fished and ice fished it...), Oahe. Had great times and caught a lot of fishNext up....Going back to Redwing(staying at Everts) in March after 4o years is intriguing, winter run on Rainey River, NW angle in May is of real interest, Madeline Islands on Superior for Trout/Salmon, Erie are short list. there are 20 behind it...also fly fish WY and CO"
6499920,NARDA 1,2020-11-17 19:03:00,636,"For the past 30 years I have fished only Canada at Birch Dale Lodge. All of my fishing gear has been stored at the lodge for the past 20 years or so, which presented a problem this year. Do to the boarder closing we went to Kec's Kove on Lake Kabetogama,so i had to go buy a new rod and real and some tackle for the trip. Other than Canada I have occasionally done a Lake Erie or Lake Michigan charter."

For most of the guys in the group...yeah..for the most part they only gosh that time in canada. For me...I love to fly fish and I have a small cabin on a small river so I fish all the time. I am always on an adventure of small creeks and rivers to fly fish. I do not have a boat so most of my fishing...other than canada is fly fishing creeks, streams and rivers."
6500086,Bill Krejca,2020-11-18 15:08:00,6107,"In my younger years, it was twice a week, early spring to late fall, or more in Iowa, 2-3 times/year in Canada, usually 2 times. As I continue to ""mature""(thank goodness), home fishing has taken a beating, too hot to fish (lyrics to a country song), interest lagging, so has slowed immensely. Now once yearly to Canada, with fellers. Have lost many, many regulars, one just recently, one a year and a half ago. Those still on this earth giving up for various health reasons. I still have a good base of younger friends and relatives who want to go up, but conditions do change. I sorely missed the trip up this year, but did have a fantastic crappie catch last month here. At approaching 83, I fully expect a few more years in God's country, Canada, my favorite place on the globe. Dad made his last Canadian trip at 92. Bill"

6500098,Mrxlh,2020-11-18 16:34:00,210,Re-evaluating that after this year. Last year we started going to Canada 2 weeks per year. I fished WI 2 weeks this year instead. It might be part of our Â“new normalÂ” (a fricken term I hate) as we had jaunt as good of a time at less than half the cost......
6500190,kettyspanky,2020-11-19 04:13:00,271,We fish northern wisconsin alot. We fished around home a few times in the Oshkosh area. Our week trip took us to northern michigan. All of it was lots of fun. There is something about canada that is really special. I hope canada is a go for next summer. If not then I guess we will do the same as this year.
6500250,Bigtaproot,2020-11-19 09:06:00,900,"Canada is my only fishing trip of the year. Combination of work, lack of vacation, lack of place to store boating gear in Chicago. My hope is that if i can ever retire, i combine a couple of weeks in Canada with a renewed interest in fly fishing and get back to pan fishing on the ice. Crappies right out of cold water even beats the taste of walleye in my opinion Bigroot"
6499734,Mojo-NC,2020-11-17 08:38:00,1929,"When I read Pooch's post asking about what equipment you have sitting aside that didn't get used this year, it made me wonder how many of you don't fish at all if you don't go to Canada? Canada is without a doubt my favorite fishing experience of the year, but I still fish a fair amount locally during the remainder of the year. I don't miss many weeks unless the weather is crappy or another outdoor activity takes precedent for a weekend here and there. I probably fish about 40 times a year, maybe even a little more. How about you?"
6499744,MrSimon,2020-11-17 09:15:00,922,I do the following trips every year: Black Lake NY St. Lawrence River NY Susquehanna River PA Wild trout streams in PA mountains Canada

6499760,Pooch,2020-11-17 10:08:00,4618,"I used to fish strip mines in our area, but after a few trips to Canada and limited amount of time I could spend fishing, I just gave up fishing locally and focused on Canada. I used to make three trips to Canada a summer and spent over thirty days a year on the water up there. Last year I cut it back to half that so we could focus more on racing. Canada is still my fishing fix and would go back to thirty days a year when I finally totally retire. I'm seventy three come spring and hope to have a lot more races in me along with a bunch more fishing trips. Eventually will age out in both sports. I think there are a lot pf people that only fish once a year and do it in Canada as a vacation. Pooch"
6499776,h8go4s,2020-11-17 10:40:00,1673,"I've always had my own boat, so I've fished locally more than in Canada. For a few years I was part of a group that did a yearly fly-in out of Ear Falls or Red Lake, Ontario. After that died out, I did a few drive-to trips with a friend to Reed Lake, Manitoba right after ice-out. Now with a group that does a every-other-year houseboat trip out of Ear Falls. Hopefully that will be possible next fall. I also do 5-6 boat-in camping trips to Voyageur's National Park each year, mostly solo. Prior to this year, that included ventures across the border in Rainy and Namakan. Hopefully that also will be possible next summer.I consider myself very lucky that I can do all this. Hopefully for a few more years."

I think we skipped three weekends due to other commitments and stayed nine straight days there in July. We fished about 90% of those days. We'll be at Leech Lake, MN for a week between Christmas and New Year. Canada is still my favorite fishing trip. It's not even close."
6499816,Mojo-NC,2020-11-17 12:56:00,1929,We've kicked around the idea of spending a week on a houseboat on one of the big lakes like Lac Seul. I think it would be a blast. I hope you don't mind if I reach out to you for advice if we ever get around to actually doing it. Our next trip is a fly-in provided we get to go next year.

Started fifteen years ago with Saintjo guy, my sons father-n law. Fell in love with walleye and northern fishing. The only other fishing I do is when the family goes to the Outter Banks, NC for vacation. The son, son in law, grandson will do an offshore trip Gave up bass fishing decades ago. Canada stole my heart."

This year we couldn't go due to covid and since I had shoulder surgery in June I wasn't able to fish anywhere until August. Short season for me, but I sure hope that I can make up for it in 2021. I live in Minnesota and since I'm retired now I do a lot of local fishing and usually a trip or two to Michigan."
