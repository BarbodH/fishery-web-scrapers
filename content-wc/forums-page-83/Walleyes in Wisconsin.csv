Looking at buying a cabin in northern Wisconsin or the upper peninsula. Preferably on walleye water, (lakes or rivers) though close to good walleye lakes works if not on water. Would also take smallmouth lakes. I've marked a few cabins on some lakes off Zillow. So many are highly developed and crowded. As a native Minnesotan this is a hard question, but Wisconsin will be a lot closer to our home. Thanks"

It’s not overly developed as the Boy Scouts owns a lot of the property. It’s close to the town of Rice Lake and not that far south of Duluth, a little over an hours drive."
