6496414,Bigtaproot,2020-11-02 04:47:00,900,Hi Mike So glad you are feeling better.
6496636,Mike Borger,2020-11-02 15:29:00,1554,"Just logged on and saw this post. Am equal parts touched and mildly embarrassed. Thanks for the support guys, honestly!I really did feel like I was dying last week LOL! I'm still in pain and not eating much, but I can deal with that, and yes, I did fish last week.Was probably a much needed wake up call for me, as I really do need to change my diet and lifestyle at least a little.Getting older sucks!"

6494796,Larry S,2020-10-26 10:01:00,665,"Mike Borger posted on his Facebook Page "" Looks like No Fishing for a While. Drove myself to emergency earlier tonight and I'm not doing particularly great"" Get well Mike!!"

6494814,BornToFish,2020-10-26 10:23:00,1224,"Greetings, I don't follow FaceBook either, so please keep us up to date on Mike's situation. I hope he and his son are out chucking Doctor Spoons in the upcoming season, as many of us very much enjoy reading his articles. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6494870,Carnhzkr,2020-10-26 14:32:00,964,"From Mike's FB page: ""Wow, so much love from my friends I'm touched. Just a quick update. Since Friday I've been dealing with severe abdominal pains and vomiting. Haven't been able to hold down and food or water or sleep because the pain was too brutal. Finally went to the Hospital at 3am this morning and surprisingly they didn't waste a ton of time to test me. They did bloodwork, chest x ray and cat scan. In the end I think it could have been worse. It's nothing contagious at least. Apparently I developed a pretty bad ulcer and the worst case of acid reflux the doc has ever seen. So despite the fact it still feels like someone's stabbing my gut I suspect I'll live. And if the prescription they gave me actually works to alleviate the pain and nausea, I may even still go fishing on Wednesday"""
6494878,vteye3,2020-10-26 14:54:00,496,Mike - I hope you an Brendan are out steelheading this weekend.
