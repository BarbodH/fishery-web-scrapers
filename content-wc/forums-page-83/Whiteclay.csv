Camp was nice, nothing fancy had a separate bath house with hot water and a nice fish cleaning house. Walleye and pike fishing was very good. Moose, bear and caribou sightings weren't unusual. The gorge on the north, north east end is worth the price of admission."

The fishing was very good both times I was there. Gorge as noted is pretty neat. Tons of structure around numerous islands and points. Rapids at head of lake was very consistent producer. PB Northern at 46 and a number of walleyes in the upper 20’s. Had a number of big northern t-bone walleyes near the boat. Did not break 30 for a walleye, but a few of my buddies did. I think the genetics in that system have bigger walleyes than the other river systems we’ve fished. Would go back without hesitation, but the group likes to move every few years to a new system and explore new water."

The lake is quite large but we caught so many fish and about 5 Pike over 40"" too. The gorge is worth a visit 100% and you can go all the way to the Ogoki rapids which is alot of fun too."
