Look like good ones to put on my list which has been bumped from '21 to '22 at earliest. The plan for '20 had been to meet up in the Rockies for trout with a bunch of guys who all fished together 40 years ago and it didn't happen for some reason I can't remember. Hoping to get it done next year as none of us are getting any younger."
6505456,pikeandtina,2020-12-08 06:00:00,145,"Kim, I highly recommend Bear Lake Wilderness Camp. We have been there several times...one of my favorites. Going back this coming June if the border opens."
6505488,kim n indiana,2020-12-08 07:33:00,62,i know the smallie fishing has to be great there. give me an honest assessment of the walleye fishing please.
6505554,pikeandtina,2020-12-08 09:42:00,145,"Kim, unfortunately I can't. I don't fish for walleye, but my understanding is the best way to catch them is by low-light/nighttime fishing. Sorry!"
6505562,dosxx,2020-12-08 09:48:00,60,"My group fished Bear Lake Wilderness several years ago (maybe late 2000’s). We had a blast but this was the first trip that no one put on weight due to all of the trekking to fish back lakes. At least one of the lakes was a boat ride, a hike with gear and a small out board, another boat ride and then fishing from a canoe, but the smallmouth fishing was absolutely fantastic. The main lake was incredibly clear and very tough fishing. I think we only caught a few tiny rock bass on some structure that we were walleye jigging on. I didn’t keep written logs back then but if memory serves me right we caught zero walleye anywhere in 7 days. There were some pike in the mix that we filleted for some meals. We spent almost all of our time fishing back lakes. Maybe the walleye fishing has changed since then. I would recommend the experience but it was definitely for the adventurous and not for those that can’t do some hiking and spend hours in a canoe."
6354564,kzoofisher,2019-08-31 04:29:00,5144,"Water was low, 8-10 below normal and 18 below the highest I've seen it. Also cooler then usual, started the week at 66 and ended at 63. Catch rates were pretty normal except we had to move around more than usual. Never did find large schools where one spot produced for a couple hours and the fish were spread out in different depths more than usual. Week started with them in 20'-24' and ended with them in 15'-18'. We also had three days of strong winds which didn't help. Quite a few spots were unfishable by jigging which is what we go there to do. Biggest eye of the trip was 25, biggest smallmouth 18.5 and biggest pike 35(incidental catch). 5 smallmouth 17 or bigger and I don't know how many under 17. Probably averaged 6 walleye per rod per hour in the 14-18 range. The rivers were running very low and the usual current spots weren't there. Like just a trickle. That was a shame since we save those spots for the inevitable windy days and usually tattoo fish there. A heads up to anyone thinking about booking this place. Due to another scheduled trip next year I had to drop my week and it's available for next year. They did some renovation this year with improved docking, better kitchen arrangement, new fridge and an on site generator for recharging batteries and such. The price went up too, but it's still relatively cheap. $475 per person for the week with 3 small boats included. I think it's about as good a place as you'll find in the area when you combine the fishing, solitude and price. We saw two boats all week and neither ever got close enough to tell what brand they were. 2021 will probably see me doing another fly in or maybe a drive in around Nakina or further west. Going to be looking for a smallmouth fishery that has walleye, too. My criteria in order of importance are solitude, fish and price. Any accommodations that don't leak and keep the bugs out are good enough for me. Goes without saying that rental boats have to work. I did that once and it can really screw up a week. Recommendations welcome."

6354732,fsz,2019-08-31 18:33:00,144,"Kzoo, Did you make it to the portage lakes? A while back I did some research on locating a good walleye-bass lake. Never really could get a reliable lead on a lake that was truly good fishing for both in decent size and numbers. In fact, Windermere consistently came up as one of the best options. LOTW is supposed to fit the bill, but i wanted to keep driving time to 16 hours so never pursued it. There is another lake connected to LOTW to the west I believe that's supposed to be great for bass, but you are not allowed to target walleye even though there are huge ones there."
6354754,kzoofisher,2019-08-31 20:59:00,5144,"I’ve never fished Goldie, Mr. Simon speaks highly of it. Kathleen we fish every year and it’s on of our dependable spots in bad weather. This was the one year that there was no water flow and it was a bust. From the boat cache you can easily row to the mouth of the Windermere and tattoo smallmouth averaging 16”. Heck, you only have to row 50 yards to the point and you can walk the rest of it on the gravel beach if you want. Having the boat is nice so you can cross the inlet and fish the opposite side too. There’s a rock hump on the way that holds bass as well and a point about 1/2 mile into the lake worth fishing. Most years we took oars and a transom mount trolling motor and that was all we needed. You can rent a 5hp from the lodge too. There aren’t so many fish at the river mouth that you can pound it every day, three days is the max for the week with rest in between. With good flow the mouth of the Prairie Bee is good too. Not as good but good. Considering that there’s lots of good fishing in Big Sandy you’re often close to it anyway. I’ve got waypoints for quite a few spots to make the learning curve easier if you want them."
6355108,fsz,2019-09-02 10:50:00,144,"Kzoo, I appreciate the offer but I don't think I'll be making it anytime soon, maybe in retirement. Just curious for now....One can always dream a little I guess!"
6504904,Guest,2020-12-06 11:02:00,0,"my eternal quest: walleye/smallies in canada. if i never caught another slimy snake, that would be fine by me. places i've found. shooting star camp. several of their lake options offer smallies and walleye. air ivanhoe has about 4 lakes with both. grand falls camp on 129 going up. tunnel lake has both. plus river flowing down into it has both. Which i canoed several times when i was young and had no sense. Sudbury aviation has 2 camps with both species. and i did happy day lodge once and as mentioned on here, it has both. as you see, some are outpost cabins, some are lodges and more accessible. i'm always coming up thru SSM so all of these are east ontario."
6504958,kzoofisher,2020-12-06 14:16:00,5144,Thanks Kim. How would you say each of those compares to Windermere?
6505116,Mike Borger,2020-12-07 04:52:00,1554,"If you're willing to drive to Nakina, Cordingly lake has shockingly good smallmouth bass fishing as well as walleye."
6505198,kim n indiana,2020-12-07 10:10:00,62,"Mike, i was looking into Nakina this weekend. reviewing stuff on this site. any more advice would be welcomed as to options. i did Happy day lodge with 12 yr old daughter at time. so did not fish it as hard as i would have liked. caught some. 2 other guys in camp caught tons of them in bay up lake. on topwater. speaking of topwater, don't ever NOT try it. even for 5 minutes. Long lake at shooting star. with 10 minutes walk to river. great fishing. went up to rapids. fished around with spinner. nothing. Grumble. so i pull out the torpedo with prop. first cast got a little hit/bump. hmmm. lets try again. two tugs and someone thru a 5 gallon bucket of water on my lure. a good 19"" smallie. i spent the next 3 hrs fishing that whole section below rapids. 30 fish ? 40 ? constant action. took city wife with me next day. fun time. she hooked one with her lure dangling just above water. he literally jump out of water to get it. that river section has lots of structure. weeds, rocks, holes. and walleye. as side note, i used to go to Maine with ex every summer for 2 weeks. river ran thru town. Uncle had cabin on island in river. we'd stay there part of week. i'd literally spend time every day either canoeing down river, or wading around. usually both. no walleye, just boat load of smallies and some decent sized crappie. along with largemouths also. stood on the downstream side of shoal one nite, 7 straight cast gave me 7 smallies over 16"". all the natives cared about were trout. which was fine by me. 2 weeks, for 16 yrs.... learned alot about fishing them. floating jointed rapala was #1 choice."
6505230,kim n indiana,2020-12-07 11:48:00,62,"oh, bear lake wilderness lodge is another i have looked into. east of SSM. boat in. numerous other lakes. camp is on island about 6 lakes over. supposed to be full of smallies, with walleye available mainly by trolling or jigging on portage lake."
