6505252,prov1800,2020-12-07 12:29:00,5010,thx man.its been a really good and fun season again.Time to think ice fishing now.lol.
6505256,Pickypickerel,2020-12-07 12:43:00,151,is the ice getting some thickness to it ?
6505278,stumcfar,2020-12-07 14:02:00,451,Just curious. Can you hunt over bait in Ontario?
6505284,prov1800,2020-12-07 14:11:00,5010,"Ice is thickening.Reports vary from lake to lake but freind of mine on Eagle lake said 3"" and another buddy on the Indian Lake chain said 5.Not much snow and we have had mild spells so that slowed it up but next week temps drop so it will build quicker and get safer."
6505286,prov1800,2020-12-07 14:12:00,5010,Yes we can hunt over bait.
6501926,prov1800,2020-11-26 15:30:00,5010,great area.Best fishing just east of the camp
6501928,prov1800,2020-11-26 15:42:00,5010,Beautifull deer.No doubt about it.We have many like that here in Ontario.And many through states.Just talking about the experience hunting here in Ontario.Ive been to Iowa and its not Canada not even close.Can hunt farms in Canada as well but that is a totally different from up north where i hunt.Cant compare the two.Total big bush/forests.No people around only wolves.Very leery deer and hard to hunt but worth it to some.Get lots of US hunters here thatare up to the challenge.
6501940,Bill Krejca,2020-11-26 16:28:00,6107,"Fishing Canada is like stepping into another dimension, I imagine hunting to be similar, lots of reasons to be there besides the accomplished quest factor. Bill"
6501976,prov1800,2020-11-26 17:34:00,5010,couple of pics from the boat launch on Eagle Lake in Vermilion Bay
6501980,7 Mag,2020-11-26 17:48:00,1887,Looks like ice fishing is in your future!
6501994,prov1800,2020-11-26 18:36:00,5010,Very soon.
6502020,prov1800,2020-11-26 19:22:00,5010,"i have a couple of more weeks to hunt.Its now time to get some meat.yesterday i took a doe and have one more doe tag and a buck tag.Ill take another doe and probably will leave the bucks alone to grow.Have a couple of nice ones but they need another year.Our winters have been killing them after they rut to hard.But want to have a look at this guy from my blind which is right behind his antlers the other day without me in it,lol.cant set time or date on that trail cam but this buck has been there a number of times"
6502030,7 Mag,2020-11-26 19:40:00,1887,"Nice buck John & congrats on the doe! Sometimes I use a similar sled as well, it sure beats dragging one."
6505164,prov1800,2020-12-07 08:18:00,5010,Just a update on the deer hunt since there isnt a lot of fishing going on yet.Ended up taking a big doe and decided to use my buck tag also.At 7 bucks a pound for burger here the ground deer burger will be awesome.Hopefully we will get a shack on the ice soon at Clarks on Edward Lake.Ice is around 5-6 inches right now and we are still having some great mild weather that is very enjoyable and can stick around a while longer.
6505202,7 Mag,2020-12-07 10:15:00,1887,Looks like you have plenty of Venison for the freezer! Nice buck congrats!
6501774,prov1800,2020-11-26 06:35:00,5010,Was in Vermilion Bay the other day and took a couple of pics of the ice on the lake.Its looking good. Took a couple of pics but cant load them.Friend of mine actually ice fished on Indian Lake chain and did very good.Ill be giving it a try soon but still hunting first.
6501780,Bill Krejca,2020-11-26 07:16:00,6107,"Thanks, John, appreciate your comments. Nice to be reminded that there still is a world north of the border; the longer it takes to be able to get back, the more it can seem like just an imagination figment! Bill"
6501782,prov1800,2020-11-26 07:39:00,5010,"Something has to happen Bill.This cant go on.Vaccines,rapud test whatever.Masks whatever it takes.Camps have to ve abke to open or id say lots would fold. Not all but most. Sad thought.The only good part of last summer is that nature got and is getting a break.Right now the deer hunt is on and besides some local hunting the deer herd which is way down is definatly getting a break from the onslaught of US hunters as iam sure same goes for fish populations.Should be a good year in 2021."
6501786,That Minnesota guy,2020-11-26 07:52:00,8293,"Not looking to start a fight I'm just curious. With all the Deer in the States why would anybody go to Canada to hunt Deer? I understand Moose & Wolf and Bear but do people really travel there for Deer? Or were you just making a ""hunting in general"" statement?"
6501790,7 Mag,2020-11-26 08:04:00,1887,"Lots of US hunters travel across the border to deer hunt, it's a different experience as you never know what other critters you might see & the chance to take something really big. A lot of states only allow one buck traveling allows multiple opportunities."
6501796,prov1800,2020-11-26 08:17:00,5010,We are talking Canada .Everything bigger and better simply put.Our norther beer are huge and a real thrill to hunt.Not talking sitting on a field edge beside corn and bean fields.Not going to get that here.talking the stuff you drive by going north.Wild deer not farm deer.Real hunting.300 pounders.big fat racks.Got to experience it first hand to know what iam talking about.
6501798,That Minnesota guy,2020-11-26 08:17:00,8293,Ok thanks. I'm not a hunter so I wasn't sure. Thanks for clearing it up.
6501828,Pooch,2020-11-26 10:09:00,4618,"Until about twenty years ago I did not know there were white tail deer in Ontario. Was fishing Birch Lake, north of Red Lake when a Doe came down to the water to drink. I was shocked to see her. Red Lake buddy of mine said they were spreading north back then.Has there always been a deer population in Ontario or are they expanding their range north from the States?How do they taste compared to the ""corn fed"" deer across the grain belt? Would they be ""gamier"" like open range livestock and Elk?Pooch"
6501868,Pickypickerel,2020-11-26 12:10:00,151,How about this fella for an Iowa Buck.
6501908,RichA$1970,2020-11-26 14:39:00,1159,Iâ€™ve never fished Eagle Lake and if the border opens was planning to do so. Anyone fish near or stay at South Shore Lodge?
