6495244,UpNorthGuy,2020-10-28 16:57:00,53,All Canada Shows are cancelled for January 2021. We got an email on Oct 19tn from the organizers. They are planning on rolling over our payments to next year. Some of the other shows later in the year might still be held. St. Paul Sportsman's show is still planning on holding their show. Jan 14-17. If the border is still closed its going to be a lot of US Camps and Slap Chop & Mighty Putty booths.

6495338,biggamefisher,2020-10-29 07:03:00,540,"The boat/rv/outdoors shows are all being cancelled up here too. If they haven't already been cancelled, it's in the process.I can not see the border opening until late next year......again depends on how things go, how things progress on the vaccinations front.With things being as out-of-control as they are now, I believe that both countries will not allow borders to open and will keep current restrictions in place for almost all of 2021.It is also my guess, that eventually when borders do open and restrictions are lessened, you will need proof of vaccination to enter the country.....just a guess but seems logical.Good luck everyone and stay safe!"
6495366,fishron,2020-10-29 08:50:00,317,"I'm wondering if the closures of the major shows will extend to the local shows run by scout troops, fishing clubs and other organizations. These local events usually draw between 500 and 2000 visitors. I've been downsizing my fishing tackle hoard at one of these shows for a while and would like to continue in March of 2021. I haven't seen anything official on these shows but soon they'll have to make that decision. It's going to be a bad cabin fever season especially with the added Covid restrictions."
6495374,biggamefisher,2020-10-29 09:18:00,540,I guess that all depends on the local restrictions on gathering sizes in the area!
6505280,kim n indiana,2020-12-07 14:08:00,62,the ones in Indpls were canceled last week. both the all canada show and the sport/boat/travel show at the fairgrounds.
6494630,walleyecheek,2020-10-25 10:00:00,2231,"I had no idea these shows cost so much 10,000 grand....thats ridiculous ! What in the world are these places charging for a booth for a weekend ?"
6494638,RichA$1970,2020-10-25 10:30:00,1159,"Last year at the Pheasant Run show for Chicago a small booth was $1,500 and a large booth was $2500. Add gas, hotel, meals and other expenses and that close to $5,000. Then you have Green Bay and Milwaukee plus if you do any others and that’s a lot of cash to reinvest in your assets and develop a solid website that shows videos of the cabins, boats and other interests."
6494700,Bigtaproot,2020-10-25 18:40:00,900,"Even though I am a proud union man, a show cause add up when we charge $100 to put an outlet in, hundred dollars to install your small carpeting $500 to set up your booth. $500 to take it down. The unions control the venue so tightly that they can charge ridiculous prices and require union labor does even the most menial tasks"
6494738,btyreprich,2020-10-26 04:56:00,1067,"I remember when the Chicago Outdoors show was held in Rosemont and lasted for like 10 days. We'd go at least twice to see everything and decide where to go that year. Eventually the show had too many non fishing or outdoor booths for our tastes. Lodge owners said the expenses were significant and growing each year. Sad to see it end like it did. When the All Canada Show was held at Pheasant Run, several of the lodge owners pulled out of Rosemont and went there instead. Shorter show, not as expensive, and people attending the show were truly interested in going to Canada. A few lodge owners have told me that their business - due to loyal repeat customers - grew to the point where going to a fishing show made no sense. Money saved was often used in web site development or camp upgrades. When I retire in a few years, I do see myself attending this show once again - when Coronavirus is under control. Will search for a new lodge to try out each & every year."
6494778,BornToFish,2020-10-26 08:03:00,1224,"Greetings, The previous posts triggered thoughts that I want to follow up on. A good friend operates a small fishing tackle shop near my home. He participated in a trade show in Chicago when he opened his business decades ago. He ran into the phenomenon that Bigtaproot mentioned in his post. His modest profit was eaten up by various fees for services that he did not want or even need. He never went back to that trade show. I attended the Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel show for many years. I stopped going to this show about five years ago as it wasn't worth the time/money to go to this show for lack of participation by fishing lodges. I sure could shop for luggage, snack foods and other items unrelated to outdoor sports. I saw on a thread on Walleye Central just a few years ago that even more fishing lodges have stopped attending this show. I have long been an advocate when selecting a fishing lodge of the combination of internet websites and meeting lodge owners at a trade show such as the All Canada Show. I believe that lodges try to put their best face forward on the internet to attract an angler's attention. I've encouraged many folks to do their research on the internet to develop a ""short list"" of fishing lodges that interest them for whatever reason. Then, go to the All Canada Shows and interview the lodge owners behind the websites to further narrow the list of potential fishing lodges. I've noticed that current guests of a fishing lodge often ""hang out"" at the booth of their current fishing lodge. These current guests serve as great impromptu personal references for the lodge, its owners and the merits of the lake. In my opinion, the previous owners of the All Canada Show let it slide downhill. The current ownership of the show brought a huge breath of fresh air into the show. It is again a rich and vibrant show. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6494788,coldtuna,2020-10-26 09:29:00,25,"I am a relative newcomer to fishing Canada. My son and I have fallen in love with fishing Canada and have multiple trips to Canada planned for 2021 -- hopefully they happen. We look forward to going to the All Canada show at Pheasant Run each year -- it's a great break in the middle of the hard water season. I have found it to be a very useful event. I agree with BornToFish, that meeting the lodge owners and regular clients of the lodge (sometimes) is a window into what a visit to the lodge might be like. One group of guys I met who fished a NWT lodge had some great stories and photos and I ended up booking a trip there for 2019 in part due to their rave reviews, and I hope to make it in 2020 after Covid. I also have ruled out several lodges the last few years after meeting the owners face to face at the show. Several lodges that I had not really thought about seriously gave me some information that made me give them a second look. I hope that the show is back in 2022."
6494846,RichA$1970,2020-10-26 11:56:00,1159,"The shows fill a void in the season & allows for optimism in the upcoming season. I wish they could make it more affordable for the outfitters n some I have talked to just had some long term guest running the booth that swear everything t is the best. Find some other venues to host it as Pheasant Run is in the red, much like the whole state of Illinois."
6494852,Guest,2020-10-26 12:08:00,0,Phesant Run is long gone. All Canada was to be held in Tinley Park. Talking to a Canadian lodge owner recently he said he doubted the show would happen.
6494872,MikeF,2020-10-26 14:34:00,895,https://www.allcanada.com/ Looks like they have the venues and dates set. If the shows go on or not is yet to be seen. You can buy your tickets early if you wish. LOL
6494874,RichA$1970,2020-10-26 14:49:00,1159,"That’s funny, buy your tickets in advance. I think the of large $$$ deposits and pre-buys are gone due to the way the border was handled"
6494322,BornToFish,2020-10-24 07:06:00,1224,"Greetings, A good friend recently advised to me that the popular All Canada Shows will not be held this winter due to the Covid pandemic. I haven't heard of a formal announcement about this as of yet, so there is a chance the report is in error or incomplete. On a similar note, an announcement just came out that the popular Milwaukee and Chicago Musky Shows have been canceled for this upcoming season. Kindest regards...."
6494324,That Minnesota guy,2020-10-24 07:16:00,8293,I can't imagine any camp owner investing in a show without knowing if the border will be open.
6494354,prov1800,2020-10-24 09:12:00,5010,More or less most camps will have full camps for 2021 with all the roll over stuff going on.Most of my guide days have also been rebooked. Just need a open border or some system to get guests across.
6494358,Andre (wallyandre),2020-10-24 09:19:00,2274,All the boat shows atr been cancel except the the one in Halifax Nova Scotia at this moment. Hunting and fishing shows are also cancel.
6494402,fishron,2020-10-24 12:28:00,317,"In the east, the NRA's Great American Sport Show in Pennsylvania has been cancelled. That knocks out 1100 exhibitors and visitors from around the Globe. A loss of 75 million to local businesses and the state."
6494414,RichA$1970,2020-10-24 13:43:00,1159,"Like previously said, majority of reservations carried over to 2021 pending the border. If I was a camp owner I’d figure out to develop a sharp website with cabin, lake, boats and other key item videos and do my marketing over the net as what they charge and the expense of the shows are crazy. Hate to say it but most outfitter websites are pretty bare and could use an upgrade to show their competitive advantages."
6494428,Eckohlt,2020-10-24 14:52:00,3685,"Good point rich as I'm into places with great websites,you can get all the info you need on a great website"
6494452,That Minnesota guy,2020-10-24 17:08:00,8293,Very very few people hit the websites until they see the name somewhere. As much as some would like everyone to think a very small portion of fisherman visit places like this. I think shows have value but should be used in conjunction with websites for marketing.
6494474,RichA$1970,2020-10-24 19:17:00,1159,"Very very few people hit the websites until they see the name somewhere.

6494580,Bill Krejca,2020-10-25 08:36:00,6107,"Probably a given that the shows would be cancelled, due to uncertainty. I remember one camp owner sharing a few years ago that one show ends up costing him around $10,000. Bill"
