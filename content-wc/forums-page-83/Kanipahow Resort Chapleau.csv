We caught 30 walleye the first day as part of 100 walleye the first 3.5 days of our stay before some thunderstorms rolled through and the fishing slowed down considerably. The fish were up to 26"". There are also plenty of large yellow perch even though we did not target them. Camp owners Jamie and Josee are very friendly and accommodating .Reasonable rates were just a bonus"
6343574,jbb1069,2019-07-24 06:14:00,33,Considering a trip to this fishing camp Anyone has any experience with them ?
6344354,dosxx,2019-07-26 11:17:00,60,"I’m also interested in this camp. I spoke to a guy this past spring who I had just met and he said he had been to this camp many times, but I didn’t ask for more details. I would love to hear any recent feedback on their three boat in camps."
6344398,Jeler,2019-07-26 15:16:00,92,"Wow, new to me! Great rates and the cabins and lakes at the outpost look awesome! It will be great to tag along on this post and read some feedback!"
6344460,Bayou,2019-07-26 18:35:00,52,"Been to the main Lake and one of the boat ins. We went with the previous owner and would rather play with rattle snakes. I have talked with the new owner as we were going to go back but it didn't work out, no fault of theirs as they seemed like really nice people. The fella that helped the previous owner and as of 2 years ago stayed on with the new owner and is a really great person. Completely different amenities between the main and boat in lakes. A lot of traffic on the Main Lake and you will boat far. The boat in is good and if they would put a stove in instead of a two burner and a water system for showers (outside) we might think about trying it again. Also on the boat in you will leave your vehicle parked on the roadside, didn't care for that but if you know that going in it is what it is. I'll say again that the new owners (I believe from Northern Ohio) seemed like good, quality people. Fishing is what you make of it, we did good but I could see where some might struggle atleast at the main lake system. You can also look at reviews on their facebook page."
6344622,jbb1069,2019-07-27 10:47:00,33,Thanks for the reply Any suggestions for walleye on the main lake ?
6372934,jbb1069,2019-11-21 18:27:00,33,Fished from the main camp the last week in August 2019. Caught some 12-19 inch walleye and there was a ton of jumbo perch available. Walleye bite was good when the wind blew. Water levels were very low close to camp. Camp owners were friendly and rates are very reasonable. I brought my boat and my fishing buddy and I paid $400 Cdn each plus tax for the week in our 2 bedroom waterfront cabin. We enjoyed our trip and are going back in 2020 but since the water was so shallow we will just use the rental boats which is about $550 cdn per person. We will just about break even on the gas we save by not towing my boat with my truck and using his 4 cylinder Equinox to drive there.
6373142,MrSimon,2019-11-22 12:46:00,922,"Hi JBB - with the low water, were you able to get through the 7 Mile Rapids section to access the lakes to the North? Also, can you elaborate on the walleye fishing in terms of numbers? I think this is a great place to take my kids, but I worry about two things ..... not being able to get through the narrows, and only catching a limited number of walleye. Oh, and did you try any pike fishing? Any luck?"
6373200,jbb1069,2019-11-22 15:56:00,33,I WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO RUN MY 20 FT BOAT WITH A 225XL THROUGH THE RAPIDS WHICH WERE PRETTY SHALLOW. THE RAPIDS AND GENERAL SHALLOWNESS OF THE AREA IS WHY I AM RENTING A BOAT NEXT YEAR. Since we were able to catch walleye with our limited exploration of the area I am confident we will do better next year as we wonder further from the main resort. I think this would be a great resort for kids because of the abundance of perch as well as walleye. We did incidentally catch some smaller pike but we were not targeting pike. If you have any questions go ahead and email Josee since she is good at replying to emails in a timely fashion. I was also told the water levels are much higher earlier in the year. P.S. please ignore the **** cap lock
6373568,PIKEMAN330,2019-11-24 15:07:00,101,We stayed at the Emberass Lake outpost a couple off years ago.The cabin has 3 piece bath with hot water and solor power.Its air tight and has a good wood stove. We caught some nice walleyes and a few very small Pike.We had a good time.I can honestly say that the owners are two of the nicest people on Gods earth.We had a problem which was not their fault.The help they gave us was just unbelievable.The fellow that took us in to the lake was also a very nice person.We were at the main lake for short time and I saw a fellow bring in a very large walleye.This was in the middle of the day. We were going to go back last year but could not get the week we wanted.I think you will like it . Good Fishing Pikeman
6505556,kim n indiana,2020-12-08 09:43:00,62,"i did their wabus lake outpost around 5 yrs ago with wife. drive down logging road, leave car, take his truck to big wabus, short portage, and then short boat ride to camp. caught plenty walleye. camp was on point and nice enough. we could fish both lakes no problem. had to bug out in rain on last day was no fun, but not the resorts fault. unfortunally that outpost camp has been sold. tried to go back 2 yrs ago and discovered that. but no complaints with lodge owners. they still have 2 other outposts. main lodge was featured 2 yrs ago on one of the outdoor shows."
