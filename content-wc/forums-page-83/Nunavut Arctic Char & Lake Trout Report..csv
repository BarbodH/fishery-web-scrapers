Always working up here to help folks out but some folks certainly gotta do their part to help themselves be better tooQuote: Originally Posted by coldtunaGreat report and photos.

It must be an incredibly harsh and difficult environment in which to live year-round. I found the native people to be interesting - in both good and bad ways. Kindest regards....Thanks Born! I find the Inuit of our Arctic one of the greatest testaments of human survival. Now that times have changed so rapidly for them in just recent decades, they certainly do face some very new and real challenges. It's been interesting working with First Nations for 20+ years, and IMO more rewarding for in the places I visit, where few to no Doctors are found, it's the Nurse's who make the biggest difference.

A salute to being able to be a front line medical provider and also ability to get some fishing in!! Congrats on the great trip and real nice char. They are a beautiful fish.Thanks V! Appreciated. Real great to read responses like this one knowing that my memories written and photographed can evoke fond memories for others too. Lived, work, traveled, loved the north most of my adult life, it's something else to me and something else to share. And agreed, char are beauties."

Always enjoy your stories and the awesome pictures. I will probably never get up to that beautiful/wild parts of the world so it is nice to experience that part of the world thru your stories."
6504472,Moosebunk,2020-12-05 10:38:00,211,"Quite fortunate to have built a good and interesting career in Healthcare. Contractual work often carries me away to Canada's arctic, many places visited are about as remote and unspoiled as one could ever imagine. Summer time I look forward to spreading the wings and flying somewhere with accessible fishing. There have been trips north for Arctic char and lake trout that have come together magically. This crazy Covid year many challenges and changes would be faced but, in the end the fishing managed to work out the way it was meant to. The sixth chapter of ""A NUNAVUT NOMAD"" this story ""By Way Of Netsilik"" shares a fully picture loaded experience of fishing, land and life outside of Canada's most northern mainland town in the country. A place where caribou roam at your back, while you cast forward to wild char and lake trout. Read on if you like...https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-nuna...y-of-netsilik/Bunk! ."
6504548,Andre (wallyandre),2020-12-05 15:58:00,2274,Nice pics. I read a little bit I will continue reading tomorrow morning. I was looking at the cost to go fishing for artic char but it's out my budget.
6504866,Moosebunk,2020-12-06 10:32:00,211,"Air freight for all necessities of life and costs just to fly one's butt into the remote really do add up quick for any wanting to live or access the arctic. As I said above, ""quite fortunate"" to have built a life of work which covers those travel costs. That and the fishing are certainly a bonus. Thanks for reading. True arctic experiences are hard to come by for most, so hopefully the read fills and void."
