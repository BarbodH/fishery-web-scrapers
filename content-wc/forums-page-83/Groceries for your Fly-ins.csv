6503598,elway12,2020-12-02 21:20:00,335,"We too have to fly and travel a great distance. We always have one of our checked ""bags"" be a med/large rigid cooler. We fill it with food items we eat on the road. Then put our cold items in it after we go to the store en-route to camp. We fill it with food items we eat on the road. We also utilize some type of soft coolers that can be folded up and packed in our duffel bags/suit cases. B.P. used to sell them. We have also have used the ones that are like a ""tote"" bag type cooler. We are planning on pre-ordering our groceries when we are allowed to go north of the border again!"
6503618,Camoclad,2020-12-03 04:12:00,628,"Thanks for sharing, the soft sided cooler bags would not be hard to pack, that is a really good idea that I might borrow from you! Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6503746,BrianinVA,2020-12-03 11:13:00,160,"We fly commercial into the area as well and use a folding, soft sided cooler and it does the trick. For non-perishables you buy some appropriately sized boxes from Amazon or Staples and bring along a roll of packing tape to reassemble. The boxes will pack nice and flat in a suitcase and don't take up too much space."
6503760,Camoclad,2020-12-03 11:42:00,628,"Great suggestion, thanks for sharing. The boxes would be easy to put into the luggage for sure."
6503806,Ricky Spanish,2020-12-03 13:00:00,1298,"Whew, Tugaloo's a lake. Had to look it up. Thought it might have been a nickname for one of pj's inflatable friends. I know a guy in central WI that might be willing to do some grocery shopping for you or loan you some coolers. Where do you normally fly into?"
6503848,Camoclad,2020-12-03 14:20:00,628,We usually fly-in to IFalls. So far everything has been fine with the outfitter we use providing the service of shopping for us ahead of time. I was really looking at it for the possibility of using another outfitter (not to replace) if we add a second trip and that outfitter didn't do the grocery service. Been trying to get PJ just to fly to one of the bus stops for Temple Bay and hop on for a ride! Maybe one of these days. Hope you and the Mrs. are well and getting to do a bit of deer hunting. I have been telling these rednecks down here they have never had a true jalapeno hot stick and they should! Ha!
6503976,Ricky Spanish,2020-12-03 18:48:00,1298,I tagged a #185 8ptr in early Oct. First time in the stand and saw 19 deer in the hour I sat over that bean field. Two giants were 200yds across the field and this guy decided to pose broadside at 18yds so that was my bow season. My friend is a coworker of the guy that came up with that recipe for jalapeno sticks so I plan to make my own this winter. Dawn and I have lost about #150 combined since you saw us and we're spending the week between Christmas and New Years at Leech Lake. We have a lot of making up to do for all the ice fishing we missed because we were too fat and lazy. We both feel 20yrs younger. We should do houseboat trip and let PJ be the captain one day. I'll haul up my Alumacraft and all the corn fed WI venison we can eat. Dawn says hi.
6503986,Camoclad,2020-12-03 19:05:00,628,I am in! Sounds like a great time on a houseboat. I hope y'all wear out the fish on the ice. Pretty sure PJ will need very little arm twisting to be the houseboat pilot!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6504030,pjshorthorn,2020-12-04 04:32:00,5654,Done. All In. If we scare up two more knuckleheads that is a fun trip for sure. How does Lac Seul sound boys ? No weight limits to worry about on houseboats so we can bring all the hot sticks Ricky can crank out....LOL. If we get the 75 footer we will camp like kings and queens for sure !!!! PjShorthorn
6504364,adempsey2.0,2020-12-04 21:40:00,611,"For me, it depends on a few things. 1) Am I flying commercially or driving? 2) What does the outfitter provide? 3) What is my budget? If I am flying commercially and being somewhat budget conscious I will pre-purchase some meat and take it as a carry-on or check-it. Normally that would be 2 steak dinners and deli meat. I find the smaller cities/towns you travel to either are very expensive or have poor selection. So, this helps with that. Two dinners and lunch pretty much taken care of is usually huge relief as well. I also take some more harder to find items just in case, like fish coating, powdered drink mixes or certain spices. Light and small things that might not be available at smaller grocery stores. All other groceries/booze are purchased locally. We either use free boxes from the grocery store to pack everything up or purchase boxes and/or totes and coolers. So far we have managed to either get the hotel to put everything in their walk-in fridge and freezers OR just keep things in coolers overnight if that option is not available. Food keeps just fine. If I wasn't being budget conscious I would just buy everything locally the day before we hit the float plane base. I always have a list. For the float plane flight, I have re-packed everything into cardboard boxes at times or just taken the coolers with us. Just depends on the situation. You really don't need to take the coolers with you most of the time. However, some outposts have pretty lackluster refrigerators or they are just too small. So a cooler helps a lot with that. Really depends on cargo space. If we drive, well, that opens up so many options. A lot more pre-made and frozen food for sure. Everything is pre-purchased over months to save on money as well. Packed in coolers/boxes/totes. So much easier to do this, but travel distance can be prohibitive. I live in Ontario, but it is very unlikely that I will drive 24 hours over flying commercially. My limit is Nakina from southern Ontario and anywhere west of that will be commercial flights. Eats too much into the limited vacation time and isn't much of a cost savings (outside of the groceries)."
6503436,Camoclad,2020-12-02 10:10:00,628,"Thanks MOJO, appreciate the info. We still need to host a SE US edition of the Walleye Central members! Maybe we can get something together for early Spring..."
6503438,Camoclad,2020-12-02 10:15:00,628,"I am not worried about it at all, just wanted to get some insight on how others have handled it in the past and it seemed like a good wintertime discussion topic that folks could chime in on if they had something to offer."
6503440,Camoclad,2020-12-02 10:22:00,628,"Thanks BB, it helps to know how you all have handled it. Truthfully, I would prefer to drive but I am still working so I am limited on vacation days so flying gets us there in a day. Sooner rather than later, I plan to make leisurely drives up and back with all of the gear for our trip but it will be a few more years!"
6503442,Mojo-NC,2020-12-02 10:32:00,1929,That sounds great to me. I'm sure I could get a few of the guys together for a road trip.
6503500,kswalleyer,2020-12-02 15:43:00,1651,we buy our 8 cases of Molson local.
6503524,Camoclad,2020-12-02 17:35:00,628,"We used to have the outfitter fly in the brew early. Getting older, started going fishing to fish instead of drinking trips with a chance of fishing! Last couple times we picked up a couple cases and a bottle of booze at the liquor store in I Falls. Definitely not knocking anyone, our motto used to be, you can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6503554,pjshorthorn,2020-12-02 18:59:00,5654,My phone hasn't rung yet. I got an extra brand new truck and I can get us there in one day. ROADTRIP !!!! PjShorthorn
6503572,RichA$1970,2020-12-02 19:37:00,1159,I’d buy some MREs as they have a long expiration date as I doubt the border will be clear for a good part of the 2021 season.
6503582,Camoclad,2020-12-02 20:13:00,628,"No kidding, I am ready. Maybe a practice run on Tugaloo first."
6503588,Camoclad,2020-12-02 20:25:00,628,"I think we will just wait until about week before the trip then decide what to do. In the meantime it has been interesting to see how some others do it. MREs are a hard no, I've no desire for a tube of peanut butter on stale crackers or vacuum sealed pop tarts if you get the UN daily rations. At least you will get some matches to start a fire with in them! One less thing to pack I suppose..."
6503356,Camoclad,2020-12-02 08:19:00,628,"How do you guys handle the purchasing and packaging of your groceries for fly-in trips? We have been using our outfitter who we send a grocery list to, they do the shopping and add 20% to the bill for their labor in that. It isn't too bad for convenience and they pack it up in coolers and boxes as they want it for the plane though it can get a little pricy. However, I talked to another outfitter about a trip with them a while back and they do not offer any assistance with groceries and you have to bring it all on your own. We are all traveling by commercial flights from the SE states so it isn't likely that we could bring a couple of igloo coolers or plastic storage boxes for transporting the groceries. I do think that we may explore the possibility of purchasing our groceries in International Falls, maybe finding some styrofoam coolers that are reasonably priced, and doing our grocery shopping on our own. The cost would be significantly less if purchased in the US the night before we fly out the next morning. Are there any stores at International Falls that have a grocery service for traveling fishermen/hunters? Seems like it might be a good side hustle for someone if there are others like our group that would gladly pay someone to take care of this before we arrive."
6503368,That Minnesota guy,2020-12-02 08:36:00,8293,"There are 2 grocery stores in I-Falls. Super One & County Market. Both have the same parent company so there isn't much advantage one over another. I don't know if either offer the shopping for you option but I can get you phone numbers if you wanted to call them. It would be nice if you knew somebody who had a extra truck you can use, Hope your trips work out for your groups this summer!"
6503376,bbheli,2020-12-02 08:47:00,1387,"For a group of 5 we brought a cooler with all the meat and things that needed to be cold, we pre froze it for the drive and it was fine, another few boxes of items also came with us and we bought Milk eggs and so on local and put them in another cooler with zero issues. we did order some things to have on hand for us such as bottled water, pop and beer."
6503386,Tx Jig tyr,2020-12-02 08:57:00,140,"We have used the Super Foods for just such trips. Can be ordered on line with brands specified, or they will pick. If something is not listed on the online order, they will add it and put it in the order. We had good success with the orders being ready on the date and time as desired. Good luck, Tx Jig Tyr"
6503398,Camoclad,2020-12-02 09:22:00,628,"Thanks, sounds great, I will look them up!"
6503402,Camoclad,2020-12-02 09:25:00,628,"This worked for us too when we drove to a resort, however when we fly, we fly from Atlanta and have no vehicle. We use North Air Taxi to take us to the outpost and return. We do spend the night in IFalls, so we are considering getting a city cab taxi to the store, purchasing groceries, and having it ready for the border crossing and ride to the outfitter the next morning. Trouble is, we don't have a cooler or way to get everything frozen between the grocery store and leaving the next morning."
6503410,Camoclad,2020-12-02 09:29:00,628,"You know I am going to call someone with an extra truck! Might even see if he has some coolers and plastic storage boxes I could borrow for a week. I can pull up the numbers as we get closer and see if that will work out. The outfitter we are using this year is the one that offers the grocery service. We may just use them if they are still doing that this year. There are a lot of if's though! If the border is closed, you might just wind up with a freeloader (another one) for a few days of MN fishing."
6503418,Mojo-NC,2020-12-02 09:35:00,1929,"We also fly from the Southeast US and usually fly into International Falls through MSP; however, we have also flown into Winnipeg. One of our guys is great for putting together a menu for the week and then breaking it down into a corresponding grocery list. On the year of our fly-in, we flew through Winnipeg. There is a Costco in the city, so that's a good place to buy large quantities of groceries and supplies, but sometimes their quantities are too large for a 1-week trip. For instance, we really didn't need an 80-pack of trash bags. As a result, we also had to go to a Walmart and another grocery store to complete our list of necessities. While at Walmart we searched high and low through the grocery section for fish batter. None to be found anywhere! Where did we finally find it? In Sporting Goods - go figure. The grocery stores in INL have already been mentioned. FYI - Winnipeg is a PITA to get out of the city and a boring drive across a bunch of nothing on the way to Kenora, which is where we stayed the night. The drive doesn't get nice until you get to Ontario. When we fly int INL, we stay in Dryden. We like the drive from International Falls to Dryden a lot better. On our fly-in trip, we purchased some large plastic bins to bring our groceries onto the plane, and then left them with the lodge owner along with our edible/unopened leftover groceries upon our return. We could have left the food at the cabin for the next week's guests, but we were the last group of the season. All in all we had a great trip!"
6503420,97roughneck,2020-12-02 09:36:00,899,I think you're going to wait a looooong time before the border is open so you've got plenty of time to worry about your grocery logistics.
6503426,bbheli,2020-12-02 09:50:00,1387,"Yea, that is a problem - when we fly-in we drive to a pickup point and board there to the outpost se we have our trucks up to the point we board the plane. We usually drive up the night before so we only have an hour of road between us and the pickup point for the aircraft. So its about 12 hours from Chicago to Canada plus the night over and the time to get to the outpost and all was still at perfect temps. We have had the outfitter shop for us ahead of time also and that worked out well. If you get a taxi and put it on ice it should be fine, just remember to bring large zip locks or plastic bags you can seal to put things in so its not floating in the cold water. The ice will give you 12-15 hours if you put it on top and bottom of cooler."
