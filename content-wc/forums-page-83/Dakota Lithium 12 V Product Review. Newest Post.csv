6498316,MrSimon,2020-11-11 09:06:00,922,I also run a Helix 5 with a 10AH DL battery. It's a great set-up. You just need a source to charge the battery a few times during the week. That same battery would easily power a standard black & white non-GPS sonar unit all week without needing a re-charge.

6502268,BadgerRedd1,2020-11-28 05:44:00,82,"Since Amped Outdoors is based in my home state of Wisconsin, I've been looking to go to 2 100Ah lithium batteries to run my 24v 80lb thrust trolling motor and I'm wondering if the charger you folks have recommended in this thread is better than the $45 charger on the Amped website? With the costs of the lithium batteries I want to make sure I don't ruin the batteries by using the wrong charger. Thanks for your help !!"
6497874,gordy28,2020-11-09 06:04:00,437,As I mentioned in my review of the Helix 5 fish finders we were nervous about juice heading into our Root Bay trip. I had noticed a few posts on this and other forums about the benefits of Lithium Ion batteries and the guys decided to make the plunge Full review is up and overall we thought the batteries were a great addition to our trip gear https://www.northernjacks.com/post/product-review-dakota-lithium-12-volt-10-ah-battery Cheers Andrew
6497886,Skywagon,2020-11-09 07:23:00,1106,"I have 4 of these exact same batteries (two of the batteries I have had for 4 years) that are being used in the summer and winter both in power loving color, GPS fish finders. I concur with your findings, the conventional batteries would not last a big day, these batteries keep on going, well worth the money for my application. Just for informational purposes, they do require a different charger, but these are inexpensive."
6497896,biggamefisher,2020-11-09 08:01:00,540,"Just to clarify, Dakota Lithium makes LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries not Lithium Ion batteries.Two very different technologies with very different chemistries and characteristics.I run 4 Dakota Lithium LiFePO4 and 2 Amped Outdoors LiFePO4 batteries for my ice fishing electronics..........the Dakota's are 10ah with the Amped being 12ah (same physical size as the Dakota), with the Amped product I get a few more hours of run time on my Ice Helix 7's and Lowrance HDS 8. To get the most out of your batteries and to sustain lifespan.........The correct charger is a must for LiFePO4 chemistry, I use two CTEK Lithium US chargers to keep up with demand. Dakota's are 4 years old and the Amped are going on their second ice season.Both products are a GREAT upgrade from the standard SLA batteries that are supplied with most portable and Ice fishing set ups."
6497916,adempsey2.0,2020-11-09 09:05:00,611,"Good review! I think these batteries need more publicity. They are such a great innovation. Hoping to pick up a Helix 5 or 7 and a couple of these batteries this year. Even makes charging with solar more practical because they charge much faster than lead acid. Those 2 Amped Outdoors batteries are a good deal. Too bad they don't ship to Canada. The LiFePO4 batteries are still lithium ion, just a different type and are much safer than the cobalt-based LiCoO2 that people are most familiar with."
6497918,biggamefisher,2020-11-09 09:10:00,540,"A friend of mine is the local distributor for Dakota and Amped Outdoors products here in Manitoba, he sells at retail too, if you want send me a PM and I can get his contact info to you. These LiFePO4 batteries are safe and easily shipped either by courier or Canada Post, shipping with either method is very reasonable and his prices are the best I've seen in the market.As stated, LiFePO4 and Lithium Ion technology are different, they may share some of the same characteristics and technology, bottom line though, they are different.The lithium-iron (LiFePo4) battery has an edge over the Li-ion (LiCoO2) battery for safety. The lithium-iron battery has superior chemical and thermal stability."
6497936,gordy28,2020-11-09 10:28:00,437,Hey there - thanks for the feedback and my bad as I typed this in the AM my brain thought of my drill and said Lithium Ion lol They are great batteries for sure Andrew
6498068,Guest,2020-11-10 03:19:00,0,"Hey D-Man, Amped Outdoors shipped me a 12ah 12V battery last year via UPS - after I sunk my 10ah Dakota lol. Cost me ~$35 in brokerage fees. Both Dakota and Amped were good to deal with fwiw. And nice work on the blog Andrew."
6498102,adempsey2.0,2020-11-10 07:26:00,611,"Thanks! I actually e-mailed Amped Outdoors earlier to find their Canadian distributors. I am by no means a battery expert, but every science article I looked at on LiFePO4 batteries classified them as a type of lithium ion battery. I mean, there is Lithium in the battery after all. The cathodes are just different. It isn't really important, the important part is what makes the types different and LiFePO4 are great for so many things!Quote: Originally Posted by Chuck EnwindeHey D-Man, Amped Outdoors shipped me a 12ah 12V battery last year via UPS - after I sunk my 10ah Dakota lol.

Cabelas Canada actually sells the Dakota 10Ah for $140 CAD, so that's reasonable. I think it is cheaper than getting it shipping from the US due to the shipping/duty/brokerage. I just like the idea of a 12Ah, but 10Ah are still pretty good. Waiting on Black Friday/X-mas sales to see what happens with the sonars."
6498108,biggamefisher,2020-11-10 07:37:00,540,No worries just trying to help...........he sells the 12ah Amped product for less than that and no taxes.
6498238,adempsey2.0,2020-11-10 20:57:00,611,"I just remembered, you were the person who actually showed me these batteries on a fly-in trip back several years ago."
