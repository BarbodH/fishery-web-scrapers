527226,Guest,2003-02-04 09:22:00,0,"We went to a Sport Show looking for a Outfitter and one of our guys asked Moron Question #2...""Can I catch a 20 lb Northern""....I loved the Lodge Owners reply..."" You might,but I doubt if you will land him"". Lots of great info in this posts replys...gather all the information you can. I think the best info is from those who have been there before. Get a list of people and call them...it works."
527227,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-02-04 11:39:00,618,"I can not agree more that some of the outfitters are better sales persons than others may be. Some will have a repeat guest from the states with them to help with the selling. Some of the best fishing I've found in Canada came from the outfitters that did not speak much and were not the best sales persons. I have always been one to ask lots of questions at the shows. I always split our party into 2 groups. Each group has a talker and a listener. We ask some of the questions that slippery sam would call us a morron, but we are really looking for honesty and consistancy. If you are going to have a good vacation you need to trust the outfitter. Listen closely to the answers given for integrety. If an outfitter is trying to tell you what he thinks you want to hear there will be differences in the lines given so compare notes. Some of the best answers I have heard for the 20# pike question have been ""I doubt it, we get quite a few in the 10-12# range and a few 15's every year"" and ""There are some big pike out there but they are not behind every rock. you should expect to catch more 10-15's...."". Then a list of names was pulled out for references. Still better was the response from an outfitter, ""Somebody must have really put it to you..."". Remember when at the show to buy into the lodge, not just the marketing or slick sales ploy. Some one once told me that if it looks like ... sounds like....smells like...then it probably is"
527228,Vitreum,2003-02-04 13:58:00,221,"once. big mistake. but that was back in the 80s and before sites like this. it was one of those ""you shoulda been here last"" week kinda trips."
527216,Ohio fisherman,2003-02-03 12:03:00,989,"Hi Guys: Well, we are still shopping around for a new lodge for this year. We are looking for a lodge in the north or eastern portion of Ontario or western Quebec where we can take our own boat and boat into a remote cabin. Some lodges offer a remote cabin on the same lake as their lodge.We were discussing the topic if anyone really books lodges at the Sport Shows. (THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BASH ANYONE, LODGES OR SPORT SHOWS!) We booked one lodge the Cleveland Sport Show in Ontario and it was a big mistake. They mis-represented the fishing, accomodations, and general conditions. They used photos that were about 15-20 years old! (Yes, I should have called references but did not know that back then.)Do you find the representations made at the sports shows to be accurate, or even reasonable? Sorry, but we are a bit gunshy. I get worried when they promote the various activities to do such as golf, hot-tub, bird-watching, peddle boats, shopping in the nearby village, or other NON-FISHING type activities. What do you think?Thanks, Ohio fisherman"
527217,Peanut,2003-02-03 12:14:00,929,"It's good to be cautious. At the shows, all the lodges are trying to market themselves. I sometimes think by choosing at a show, you are choosing the best marketed lodge, which does not always equate to the best lodge for your needs.Talk to as many as you can, get as many brochures as you can. When you go home, that's when your work begins. First, narrow it down to those that have what you want in terms of cost, accomodation, size of water, access, and, yes, fishing. Check their websites. Then do some checking of their references. Also, post a question about the prospective lodges here - odds are good someone has been there and will offer a fair assessment. It sounds like a lot, but for the money you are spending, why not do all you can to make the trip as enjoyable as possible. Good luck,derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals.... Except the weasel."" - H.J. Simpson"
527218,Guest,2003-02-03 13:44:00,0,I found a gem 5 years ago at the All-Canada Show. Fishing Lac Seul out of Williams Lake Lodge and they have a remote boat in cabin that will accomodate 8. I'm booked for the 5th straight year and the fishing has been fantastic as I'm sure you've witnessed by comments on this board.
527219,Mike KS,2003-02-03 13:50:00,18,Have booked several times out of Sports Show. Have always had good luck with the bookings. We do ask the outfitter for guests names and phone numbers that were there the week before and the week after the week we are booking for last year. This gives us a good insight into all aspects of the site. It also gives us our choice of references and not the Lodge Owners. There have been several times that we passed because of poor references. Most reputable lodge Owners at a show will give you a reserved spot for for a couple weeks thereby allowing you to call references.
527220,T Bone,2003-02-03 15:23:00,18,"I've never booked at a show before, but I know camp owners pour on the sugar when discussing their accommodations, fishing...etc. I have been over southern and eastern Ontario, middle Ontario north of the Soo, and now we have found a gem in western Quebec. There are so many lodges, so many lakes, you just have to go on experience (being able to sort through the assorted truths / non-truths they tell you), trial and error, and most of all...REFERENCES. If the lodge won't give them to you, don't go...it's as simple as that. Good luck in your search and let me know if I can be of more help."
527221,Guest,2003-02-03 15:51:00,0,"I have booked through the shows before and have had decent luck. But, I would recommend the following:1)Compare with as many resorts as you can, especially in the area.2)Talk to as many people as you can that may have been in the area. You can ask for references, but be systematically complete and poignant in your questions. Ex: You say the fishing is good, but what does that equate to in numbers and size. Is that every day (alot of people ""forget"" the tough days)? 3)Look at the fish pictures closely for clues of age (style of dress, equipment, etc), also, what do the stringer shots look like. They may have plenty of pictures of bigger fish, but do the stringer shots look like primarily 13""-16"" fish? Also, because I love fishing smallies, I always kind of look skeptically at pictures that show limit stringer shots of smallies because that would indicate to me that the fishery for them is probably getting hammered. Also, if they have flyouts available, consider these fish might make up alot of the good stringer shots.4) What is the staff/guest ratio?5) Look very closely at the resort layout and the cabin pictures. If they are scanty, then they may not want you to see them. Same for the boats.6) When going to the show and looking at alot of resorts, either take notes or even record conversations so that you can review it at home."
527222,Guest,2003-02-03 15:53:00,0,"7) Look very closely at the rate sheet. What is NOT included? Remember, it is very easy to run up a big bill just in gas and bait.Look for hidden charges."
527223,Guest,2003-02-03 16:42:00,0,There was a lot of good advice in the posts above. You might ask how many sports shows the lodge is doing. Those lodges that can't count on return customers have to do a bunch of shows because they get such high turn over.
527224,Guest,2003-02-04 07:49:00,0,"Just thought you might like to know what its like to be on the other side of the table at a sport show. Most of us have chosen to run a lodge because we love the lifestyle and enjoy meeting new people. Very few are out to gouge and screw our customers..just doesn't make business sense (there are exceptions in various degrees). Not all of us are great salesmen at sportshows....some could sell ice to an eskimo. A great sales job does not necessarily translate into the best place for you to stay. Know what you are looking for, do some research, don't rush to book at the show, ask some reasonable questions while you are face to face, and go with what you feel is right in your gut. Wherever you end up try and make the best of it...have fun and chock it up to experience. Lodge owners are human...if you want some co-operation then treat them like a person. Sulking and moaning because you didn't get a boat load the first hour you were out just may backfire on you......most camps do not hire grief counsellors for these occasions....suck it up, get some additional info, go back at it.Here are some questions I deal with at shows and my translation of them (in my mind, usually not verbally)*How is the fishing (number #1 all time question)...trans..""Tell me the fishing is really good..thats what I want to hear!""*How many fish per hour can I expect to catch?..trans..""I am a moron""*Can we sqeeze a couple more in the cabin...they can sleep on the floor!"" ..trans...""We would like to grace you with our presence and not have to pay for it""*What is your average sized walleye? ..trans...""The guy in the booth next to you has 30 inch average...can you beat that?""*We fished on your lake once and didn't catch much....trans..""We fish a different lake every year and are still waiting for them to jump in the boat....just thought you would be interested in hearing this!"":P"
527225,Guest,2003-02-04 08:07:00,0,"Slippery,I am having a hard time typing since I am laughing so hard!! I remember a hearing those exact questions at a St. Paul show several years ago.The ""moron"" was a loudmouth from Iowa who was looking for the best fishing at the best price with the best accomodations. The owner finally directed him to another lodge that could fulfill his every need - same lake - Eagle Lake.I had to wonder to myself....what did the second lodge owner do to the first lodge owner to warrant such a mean trick?? The smile on the first lodge owner's face was one of pleasure - mixed with a little devilish grin!!"
