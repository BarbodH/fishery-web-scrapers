526922,Guest,2003-01-27 11:22:00,0,I've been on several trips with them. Good outfit.
526923,Guest,2003-01-27 11:41:00,0,"Not bad, but long ride, takes a day each way. Kind of expensive."
526924,Guest,2003-01-28 07:57:00,0,"You can only park in the northeast section which limits you to an area, can't go all over, and it's a long ride out there. I think for a additional fee, they will run the boat out ahead of you. Thought it was expensive and if you have a lot of guys, it gets cramped. Take a generator to charge trolling motor batteries. Haul your gas for your boats as well, much cheaper. I only did it once, but that was all I cared to. It was well run, good boats, but I would rather stay on the ground at a lodge."

The boats are nice and if you don't over crowd yourself it is really a nice way to go. Yea, gas is going to cost more, but to be able to have a gas pump in the middle of nowhere is a luxury and a mighty nice one at that. For a week long trip it still comes out cheaper than staying in a camp. We hired a ""pilot"" who drove the boat out, secured it in our desired spot, then came back out and drove it back for us. It is the only way to go. I believe they charge about $150 for insurance, which is a must if you choose to drive yourself. A pilot only cost $175 to go all the way up past Chamberlain Narrows, plus we tipped $25/piece for the effort. By hiring a pilot you can wave the insurance and the pilot is taking on the liability. It was still the only way to go though. We sat up top with lawn chairs and coolers and had beverages while enjoying the view for the first part of the trip, then we all jumped in our rigs and fished ahead of the boat, playing leap frog till we got to where we were going. It was pretty easy. Caught lots of fish all the way in and out too. I'd highly recomend it if you're thinking of a week long trip, otherwise a camp is probably more time efficient. Have fun!"

Large kitchen area with 2 refers, large dining room, screened in porch with grill etc. We had 10 guys on a 75' the first trip and 6 on a 65' this past trip. Fishing was great and the cost not too bad. We also used a guide to take the houseboats out - only way to go - relax and enjoy the ride or play leapfrog with the 16' boats and fish your way up and back."
