I just booked a trip to Eagle Lake and we are staying at Cedar Point Lodge and was wondering if anyone had any insite on this lake. We will be fishing the North Eastern part of the lake. Our trip is scheduled the last week of May. I am looking for any useful information to make this trip as enjoyable as possible being that it could be one of the last trips with my Father and brothers all at the same time.It seemed like a quality lake to fish, I just hope my assumption was right.thanksDrew"

I typed in Cedar Point Lodge Eagle Lake and checked the box to search the archives. I didn't see any negative feedback on Cedar Point Lodge. I know there has been of lot of discussion on locations and fishing techniques on this board. Use your imagination on key words and the search feature and you will get a lot of information."
527244,musky master,2003-02-04 06:52:00,2,"Eagle is a quality fishery...in that you have all the main species and the potential for trophy sized fish is there. The trend over the past several years, weather-wise, has seen water temps to remain relatively cool throughout the first two or three weeks of the season (last two weeks in May, first week in June). If this is the case this year expect to have lakers cruising the shallows..you may pick them up fishing walleyes or casting for northerns. A spinner rig with a minnow or jig and minnow would be the way to go for the walleye.....trolling with baits such as a Rapala ""tail-dancer"" would also work well. There are plenty of good spots to try near the lodge you are staying at.....I am not a guest but am very familiar with the lake and the people. The owner Pat will look after you....talk to Wayne for some fishing tips when you are there. Hope you have a good trip!"

527246,fishmaster,2003-02-04 17:11:00,209,"musky master hit it on the head this lake offers some great fishing both summer and spring, and the lake trout fishing in May can be lot of fun as well as some nice size walleyes. The lake also offers some great portages as well. As for the lake itself you won't have a problem finding a spot to fish for all sorts od species.minnow and spinner rigs/jigs and minnow are best way to go for walleye this time of the year. If the spring is warm and the weeds are coming up to turn your nose up on those perch your lodge owner will love you when you bring in a limit of perch. HAHA!!!!!! always makes for good conversation while having a few beers at the cleaning station at camp when your host gets to clean those perch.Good luck on your trip and enjoy it while you can.tight lines!!!!!"
