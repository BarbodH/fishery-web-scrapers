Usually if it sound too good to be true it is!Anyway, I'd like any info and a suggestion on what time of the year would be best. I'm limmited to the months when school is out so I can take my 13 yr old.Thanks"

526471,Guest,2003-01-15 10:59:00,0,LS is a good walleye lake. 100 fish p/day every day?? That is pushing it to the extremes. Guess it depends on how many hours you plan on sending per day fishing. It is not uncommom to have stellar days of 100+ fish expecially if you know the lake. Don't set the bar so high that you are unrealistic as to the outcome.Only Jesus promised fish for dinner!

I say that because sometimes 13 year olds don't have the patience for 50-60 degrees and rainy which is possible. I just talked to Brenda yesterday and Ken is at the ""sport shows"" now trying to fill the lodge for the summer. So if you are interested now is the time to do it."
526473,Guest,2003-01-21 14:01:00,0,"I have made 27 trips to Lac Seul and it is truely a very good walleye lake wherever you stay. If you have a clue what you are doing, you can't go wrong. Ken has been known to stretch it a little, but he is in the ball park. The walleye runs between one and three pounds with some of the bigger and a few smaller. Great trophy opp. at the Seul. Probably the best in northwest Ontario."

526475,Guest,2003-02-03 11:04:00,0,i'd like to get the phone number or email address for the outpost. can you post it for me. thanks
