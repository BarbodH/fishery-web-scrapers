I feel it is just a good investment as the smallest nick can easily cost me the fish of a lifetime.As for mono, light- particularly sunlight will break down mono in just a few weeks to some extent. Mono is not like most modern plastics as it is not UV resistant. Temperature changes will also cause it to break down.I keep my unused stuff in a cool, dark place. From experience I don't think the manufacturers are pulling my leg when they suggest at least every year."
527201,Guest,2003-02-02 23:57:00,0,When we used mono we would change it every year. cut off the end each couple of fish to eliminate nicks. Now we use fireline and dont have to change it. same line last three years. the rep at the boat show told us that. thats all i use now.
527202,Guest,2003-02-03 07:17:00,0,Hey Alan. I've had the same 6 pound Fireline on my perch spreader rods for the past 7 years and it's still holding up fairly well. I know I'm on borrowed time with it but I just want to see how much longer it will last before it starts breaking. See you on the ice! Budman
