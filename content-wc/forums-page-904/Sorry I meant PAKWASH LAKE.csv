We didn't have ""great"" walleye fishing, but it was plenty good enough to keep me interested and willing to go back. The weather was very changeable the week we were there, which didn't help. The wind blew often, so most days we stuck to the north end of the lake due to rough water.We caught some bigger fish (4 to 7 pounds) in 20 to 25 FOW just off islands. The best numbers came from 8 to 12 FOW off windy points. We also pulled quite a few walleye from shallow weed edges in Bruce Lake, which you can get to via the Trout River.It depends on what month are you going? We went in July. My brother-in-law has fished Pakwash many times the first half of June and has always done extremely well in shallow bays. But the spots he recommended produced very few fish for us later in the summer."
