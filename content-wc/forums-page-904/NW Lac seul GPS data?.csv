Any body have any good spots marked from Sawmill to Broad? Will be @ Lac Seul lodge 4/24/03, got a new GPS since last year & we're always looking for new places to catch Mr. Walleye! ""ONLY"" 111 days!"
527171,Guest,2003-02-01 06:45:00,0,"Last time I checked, the walleye season starts the 3rd weekend of May"
527172,Big Tim,2003-02-01 07:51:00,63,"Ok Ok 5/24. So I'm numericaly chalenged, why do you think I'm lookin' for coordinates now?"
527173,alan ex pup,2003-02-02 10:34:00,126,"what lodge are you staying at? I dont know when the sactuary opens but in there we always caught walleyes, thats about a half hour boat ride from resorts at ear falls. We have stayed at timberlane and golden fawn. walleys down around by the dam too. really good below the dam. wife and limited out in one day below the dam with big ones. i was thinking thats an awfully early opening season too. probabl still ice then. good luck"
527175,Guest,2003-02-02 20:14:00,0,"Ya haven't hunted to far....Browse WC 7 days a week during the winter months, just waitin for the ice to fade on my favorite fishin hole or for a warm snap so I can go fish the river north of here.Drop me an E-mail and will go find my GPS unit and retrieve the data if you are searching for. [email protected]Really hope mother nature has a warm spring in store for LS. Really doubt you will be able to boat LS that early. Maybe the English river below the dam or from the dam to the Winnasaga river. Ya might want to stay in contact w/the resort concerning the ice conditions.Last year was up for the opener and found LOTS of ice during the 3rd week in May. Ice didn't totally leave the lake until Mid-week. Very challenging getting out not to mention when the wind blew, it caused the ice to shift around.17 weeks to go!!!"
527174,Big Tim,2003-02-04 05:23:00,63,"Can you fish below the dam from shore? we don't bring our own boats, so thats out. But if we can shore fish the area it might come in handy if the wind be howlin! We're staying at Lac Seul Lodge"
527177,Guest,2003-02-04 10:20:00,0,"Are you a rookie or what? If someone does have some good spots marked from years of trial and error by putting in their time on the water, what makes you think they want to share those spots with you? At that time of year, get in line and follow the boats out of the camp/lodge you are staying at to find out where most people are fishing. If you know how to use your GPS, then track yourself so you can find your way back."
527178,Big Tim,2003-02-04 19:52:00,63,We really need folks like you. Makes the rest of seem nice. :*
527176,Karl,2003-02-04 20:30:00,63,"Last time (4 yrs ago?) there was an El Nino event (like this winter) the ice was gone on Lac Seul by the first week of May. Walleye were completely done spawning by opening weekend, but hadn't moved to post-spawn areas yet. Water levels were way low because there wasn't much snow cover all winter, and it was cold and rainy thru the end of June. Was one of my most successful weeks of fishing 3rd week of June."
527179,alan ex pup,2003-02-05 01:18:00,126,sometime the lodgeowner will put a boat in the water below the dam for you. we stayed at lac saul lodge onece sort of far down the lake and 10 miles from town. a lot of northern on the opposite shore from the lodge. caught a 20 pounder there.
