How is the fishing? Please tell me about your experiences at this lake. Thanks, Ohio Fisherman"
526990,Guest,2003-01-28 20:39:00,0,I have been fishing White Otter for twenty years plus. It is a fantastic lake for lg. walleye & lake trout. Check out Browns. What time of the year are you planning to head up there?
526991,Ohio fisherman,2003-01-29 09:21:00,989,"Hi Iron Ranger:Thanks for the information. I have no idea where the lake is located. I have heard enough about it that we want to go there. Where is it and where should we stay? Is it fly in or boat in? We have a full rig to camp comfortably in any conditions, or can stay in a lodge or camp. Please provide details if you will.Thanks, Ohio fisherman"
526992,Xplorer,2003-01-29 09:36:00,244,"ohio fisherman, White otter is next to West Clearwater and is north of Atikokan, ONtario. Atikokan is about 90 miles east of Int'l falls/Fort Frances. Browns Clearwater west resort has a portage over to white otter from clearwater lake. Do a search for Browns and you will find info. This is a drive to resort. Another option is berglund outposts who have a cabin (nora creek i think) that has boats on white otter to use.Xplorer"
526993,Guest,2003-02-02 18:12:00,0,"Ohio fisherman, do you have the answers to your questions? The portage into White Otter is a truck portage. Have you contacted Browns? White Otter is probably the most beautiful lake I have ever been on (very diverse scenery). The castle is amazing, when you consider Mcquat built it by himself at the turn of the century. The quality walleye & lake trout fishing is just a bonus after seeing the beauty of White Otter. Let me know how things are going with your search."

526995,Ohio fisherman,2003-02-03 11:52:00,989,"Hi Guys: Thanks for the description of White Otter Lake. It sounds great and I hope to someday visit and fish there. I checked the mileage and it is about 1200 miles for us. That is just too far for a one week trip with only me driving and my wife's health not that good. We will wait until her health improves. In the meantime, we are still looking for a lodge that is a closer drive.Thanks again, Ohio fisherman"
526996,Guest,2003-02-03 16:11:00,0,"I never been there, but I have always been interested in going to Le Reserve Beauchene in Quebec just over the Ontario Border. I got some responses here, also I talked to some folks who have been there. Sound like you got to work for walleyes there, but have some nice ones. Good smallmouth, pike, and trout (brookies, and lakers). Check the archives here it see if you can pull it up. Go back one year or so. Also, they do have a website- http://www.beauchene.com/"
