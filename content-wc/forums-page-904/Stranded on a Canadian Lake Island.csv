527073,Guest,2003-01-31 05:29:00,0,You can't go wrong with Blue. Theres a huge appetite for it here in the North and there is always fresh stock. You see its the beer of choice for our native Canadian brothers.

527071,Guest,2003-01-31 08:25:00,0,"At the current exchange rate and the duty, its hardly worth the effort to take beer north, unless you arrive after Beer Store hours, which we often do. Duty is about $7-$10 Canadian per case for each case over 1 per person and up to a total of 5 per person. Duty is based on cost of beer in the US, the more expensive, the less the duty. If you take several cases, keep your receipt to show customs what you paid. Last time I took Bud into Canada, the duty was about $8 Cdn per case."

527060,T Bone,2003-01-30 10:32:00,18,"Sleemans Lager or Labatt Blue? Which would you choose if you could only have one case. Sorry, my cabin fever is boiling over and I apologize for the indirect fishing question, but it has bearing on our annual Canadian fishing trip. We've always drank Blue, but I tried Sleemans Lager the last time I was in Canada in December and thought it was great. My group is slamming me for a possible defection to Sleemans. There's enough posts out here about beer, so I figure I'd consult the experts. Unfortunatley for me, Budweiser (American) is my normal brew at home.Thanks. Only 204 days and counting....tick tock tick tock tick tock. Ugh."
527061,Guest,2003-01-30 11:15:00,0,"Carlsberg, Crystal and Molson Canadian....in that order."
527062,River_eye,2003-01-30 12:57:00,1486,"I am a big fan of Blue, but somtimes you just have to mix it up. I'm not sure whether I've tried Sleemans Lager, but I've tried their cream ale and it's definately in a position to oust Blue."
527063,Guest,2003-01-30 14:41:00,0,"Without a doubt, and Ive tried them all (CRYSTAL) is the best!"
527064,Ivy,2003-01-30 15:46:00,556,Is Crystal like an Ice beer i.e. higher alcohol content?Ivy
527066,WillieB,2003-01-30 16:02:00,292,"In answer to the original question...Sleemans without a doubt.Otherwise, some Samuel Smiths Tadcaster Porter.It's more than a drink...it's a meal!"

527072,nemio,2003-01-30 18:36:00,96,Hum! Blue vs. Sleeman. After breakfast I like the Blue but with my cereal instead of milk I prefer the Sleeman.
