A boat will pick you up at the campground and take you to the lodge.We go to the lodge for supper once each trip to celebrate our anniversary. My wife prefers to fish for our anniversary trips.Lodge meals are outstanding, I would have to say that I consider the lodge to be very functional but not fancy. Boats and equipment look to be first rate.Fishing for large walleye is just terrific, have never gone after large northern. I usually fish the river right in front of the campground and do very well for walleye. Last year we caught mostly fish in the 4 to 7 lb class with bottom bouncers and night crawlers.I have never used a guide from the lodge but they seem very friendly and in talking to guests from the lodge, they indicated that they would be back."

527198,DaveIN,2003-02-04 06:17:00,191,">Dave how is the camp ground there? How big, how much$, how >clean, and how crouded? thanks Tim TimThe campground has 12 sites. They charge $20 per day per person. Decent boat docks so you don't have to take out each time. The campground is very clean but also what you would expect that remote. Most sites are within 50 feet of the water. They pick up trash every morning with out fail. Screened in fish cleaning station. Showers are clean but not fancy, plenty of hot water. Toilets are outhouses.The last week in August usually has only 4 campsites occupied and it is always the same groups. They do take reservations. There is a small campground store that has ice but not much else by that late in the season. They do have a freezer there that you can freeze fish in.Camp has its own generator for electric but it runs 24/7.If you have any further questions e-mail me at [email protected]"
