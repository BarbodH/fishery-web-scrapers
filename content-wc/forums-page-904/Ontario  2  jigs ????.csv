527230,McQ,2003-02-03 14:06:00,615,Why not?
527231,Guest,2003-02-03 14:24:00,0,I believe you can. I've used crappie rigs that have as many as three jigs
527232,Jesse-WI,2003-02-03 14:48:00,534,"A fishing line must not have more than four hooks. On an artificiallure, a gang containing up to three hooks is considered to be onehook. In all other situations, a double hook counts as two hooks;and a treble hook counts as three hooks."
