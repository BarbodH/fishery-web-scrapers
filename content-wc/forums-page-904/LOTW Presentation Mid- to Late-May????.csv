527163,Guest,2003-01-31 18:22:00,0,sorry can't help u to much on the big traverse but i know the river very well. it seems right after they spawn they start headung for the lake so around pwt tourney the walleye should still be in the river and should be a bout a two three pound average cause when i won Emo Walleye Classic www.emowalleye.com on the last weekend of May last year it was about a 2 lb. average. the walleyes wanted it slow when the wind was calm and fast when the wind kicks up and it seems they like the shallow flats 3 to 4 ft. i trolled bottom bouncers with spinners (mack's lure) and minnows. email me to hear more [email protected]

Depending on ice out (water temp) in your area the best presentation can be trolling/casting/slip bobbering the shallow structure, or jigging deeper. For trolling I prefer the L&S Mirrolure jointed crankbaits (###.mirrolure.com, 2 3/4"" long, colors #23, RT, or FT) or the old floating River Runts. 13 out of 15 years working the shallow structure (I love to troll) was the way to go during the last week of May and the first two weeks of June."
