527154,Mike KS,2003-01-31 14:26:00,18,Its really starting to set in. Noticed that last night while resting in my den I could actually see some of the wall mounts tails move. The large map of Lac Seul on the wall was covered with some thin grey clouds and it looked like the wind was blowing about 20 mph out of the west. The strange noise coming from the closet was the crankbaits talking to the Fire-Glo jigs about how fat the Leechs would be this year. As my eyes moved across the room I could see the Fireline on my Rods and Reelks tensing up with the anticipation of a strike......Thank God I had plenty of Canadian Club on the rocks and beer chasers to ward away any strange happenings....only 133 days until I can ease this pain.....if you are aware of a cure please tell me.
527155,Guest,2003-01-31 14:42:00,0,"Great post!I have a full map of LOTW framed on my wall and a blown up map of the portion of LOTW that I fish. I can stare at them and remember past trips, fish caught in certain areas, a storm on a certain day, and all of the other memories that make these trips special. This time of the year is about mid-way between my last trip and my next trip. I often get out my camcorder tapes of past trips and watch them over the winter while waiting for the warm weather to return. A lot of the guys ice fish this time of year, but being from MO that's not much of an option."

As I read your post, I would have to concur with your self diagnosis of ""Cabin Fever"". You have all the classic symptoms. I like the way you are treating this. Canadian Club and beer make an excellent combination. You may want to alternate your medicines, as I have found that "" The Fever "" can develope immunities in some of my patients. I would strongly recommend a regiment of C.C. then Crown Royal, Canadian Mist then back to C.C.One other thing you might want to try is a weekend intervention with some of your friends. This typically involves a well stocked supply of medicine, cards, chips ( plastic and the eat'en kind ) and some greasy food. During your intervention it would be helpfull to have each member recount how they caught their biggest fish. Please keep one thing in mind, some of your friends may stretch the truth as they recount their past glories. Don't get to excited by this phenomenon, they are just crazy with the fever. Out of their head if you will. Seen it a million times.Good luck.Ivy Emporer in good standing of the Beer in the Boat Gang a.k.a "" B.I.G."""
527157,Guest,2003-02-01 20:34:00,0,"hahaha, great post. i think i have some of these symptoms. for example i have gone through my fishing photo album about 20 million times, remembering exactly what lure i used to catch the fish, what technique and who took the picture. i've also got this case of watching fishing video after fishing video. some of these videos are about catching fish i dont fish for or even doing a different kind of fishing than me (fly fishing). the problem is that cure isnt for me. i'm underaged (****ed nation)! oh well i guess i'll just have to sit here and suffer the fever and hope that one of my older fishing buddies (one with a full drivers liscence) will call me up and take me ice fishing."
527158,BD,2003-02-03 16:16:00,739,"I have other symtoms. I can't seem to stay away from the fishing tackle section of eBay or going through the Cabela's Tackle Shop and other catalogs. My wife hasn't hidden the checkbook and credit cards so I guess I haven't gone overboard yet. But soon, very soon!"
527159,Guest,2003-02-03 22:16:00,0,Other symptoms may also consist of miticulously organizing and cleaning an already miticulously organized and clean tackle box; taping hours of fishing shows on the weekend to watch repetitively throughout the week; and loyaly keeping up to date on all the new postings on the walleye central message boards.
527160,retire55,2003-02-04 07:16:00,1029,"Mike KS:Great post! It was so easy to relate to - I could almost taste the CC. I have the three topographical maps required to show the complete lake (where I fish walleyes) taped on the wall and they are adorned with little post-it notes. The bathymetric map for the area of the lake I specifically fish has been expanded for easy studying and selection of new spots to fish next trip (143 days). Hardwater fishing doesn't appeal to me and consequently, I bide the rest of my free time cleaning tackle boxes, performing preventative maintenance on equipment and respooling reels. Ah yes, its cabin fever, but I wouldn't have it any other way."
527161,Guest,2003-02-04 09:29:00,0,"Mike KSLove the post...I spend a lot of time every winter going over equipment,reviewing past pictures and viewing past trip videos. Cabin Fever is part of the preperation that makes the next trip the best ever. Those of us who love the fishing opportunity that Canada and it s wonderful people make avaliable to us are awful lucky people. GOD BLESS CANADA and cabin fever."
