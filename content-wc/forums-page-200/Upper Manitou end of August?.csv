1338729,bjoern,2011-08-09 11:36:00,89,"Hi Eric,Thanks so much for the information! Are there cabbage weeds in this lake that we should be targeting for northerns and muskies? Would the muskies be more likely to be on windblown rocky points? Sorry if I am asking for too much information. I am strictly CPR with the big girls. Thanks again,Brad"
1338882,Guest,2011-08-09 20:50:00,0,"Lots of cabbage everywhere( a lot right in the bays around your camp) and also a lot of thicker weeds of a type I dont know what to call. Those are hard to fish through, fish the edges or on top of them. As far as wind blown points I am too lazy and don't have quite a powerful enough electric trolling motor to fish them like all the pros tell you to. There are a lot of rock reefs, humps, saddles and the like usually with some weed growth around them and thats what I would fish for muskie, pike this time of year. Watsons falls 1 mile south of you is usually a pike and smallmouth producer also and a pretty spot on the lake but it recieves a stop from about every boat in the area at least once a day but that still means only 2 or 3 boats per day. You are going to a pristine minimally inhabited area and may see none, 1 or 2 boats per day so be careful. Glass bay for smallmouth is my go to spot when I can't get anything else going, Have seen some trophy muskie there also. Water is more stained in Glass bay than elsewhere on the manitou. Portage lakes like etta, kamini, and doyle are good producers if you have the inclination and the equipment and they generally see only a handfull of fishermen per year and some years maybe none. Usually a catch fest on them. Used to take the kids to one of them when they were small and I needed to produce easy fishing to keep them interested. For me it is not all about catching anymore( although I still like to outfish the others) but more about the experience, nature, Canada, and friends. We love that place and plan on returning as long as the good lord allows. I have had better fishing on fly ins but will keep returning to the Manitou. Hope this helps Eric MacDonald MD"
1338893,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-09 21:19:00,1460,"Hi Brad and Manitou anglers,Your lake is definately very interesting history wise.Here is the link to the orig. site http://images.ourontario.ca/gateway/...ort=score+desc"
1338960,bjoern,2011-08-10 07:27:00,89,"Thanks guys!This has been very informative from both a fishing and historical perspective. I will give a report when I get back, but if anyone has any other tips that would be great. Sounds like we are going to get a guide from the Manitou Weather Station the first two days.Thanks again,Brad"
1339183,Guest,2011-08-10 19:20:00,0,"I would check to be sure your guide is a multispecies guide not just lake trout because you will end up trolling with downriggers for the day if thats the case. Not that this would be bad but not a great way to learn the lake and if I understand your inquiry correctly that would not be what you wanted. I am not suggesting that the guide from the weather station is bad or he isn't a multispecies guide but I think they are more lake trout orientated. Just be educatated as to what you want and what you will be doing. Have a great trip and the weather station looks really nice and I used the phone there 4-5 years ago and the people there were very friendly and helpful. Have a great trip, Eric"
1339346,bjoern,2011-08-11 08:58:00,89,"Eric,Thanks for the tip. I passed on your email to my friend who is setting up the guide. Since we are using my friend's older 18 foot Alaskan that does not have downriggers, I doubt we will be trolling. As always, I appreciate your comments and advice.Brad"
5446386,Palehound,2017-04-03 09:16:00,1,"I've got the place on Mosher Bay. Hate to say it because then everyone's fishing on top of us (boat or 2 a day at most in high season, pretty remote) but yep, some walleye. Agree, northern for shore lunch. Weather station people top notch. Barker bay good people too, Green island too. Can't go wrong up there. Good thing because it's easy to get misplaced on a cryptic 100,000 acre lake. Miss Ted. We get lake trout even in august on uphill."
1336913,bjoern,2011-08-03 12:30:00,89,"Hi,I have never fished this lake but one of my friends has invited me to go up there August 28-Sept 3. Staying at the Watson House (his family owns it) to give you some reference. I fish for anything that swims but I would guess we will be targeting muskie/northerns and smallies. Would be nice to catch walleye too but I understand that is a challenge. I hear its great for lake trout but I don't have much experience with them. Any advice at all would be great. Not opposed to getting a guide right away to get started off on the right foot.Thanks,Brad"
1337005,Wall-i-Lama,2011-08-03 17:45:00,1524,"Brad, Sounds like fun. I've fished the lake a handful of times. It will be a bit early for Lake Trout. They will likely still be deep and not moving up on the reefs till mid or very late September. The smallmouth fishing should be good. They water is very clear, and we always found that the smallmouth hang out around the large boulders. The large car sized boulders. We fished the straights just south of Watsons house and had some luck for muskie. Just south of there we also had good luck for northern and muskie in where else....muskie bay. If your friend is not familiar with the lake, I'd recommend a guide for a couple of days not only for the fishing, but the navigation can be tricky. Good luck."
1337466,bjoern,2011-08-04 20:55:00,89,Thanks for the information! Do you know of any good guides in that area?Brad
1337475,Guest,2011-08-04 21:30:00,0,"Just got back from the manitou and stay about 3-4 miles from Mrs Watsons old place. Been there about 20 times over the past 10 years so I know it pretty well. Good to see that they are fixing miss watsons up as it had been deserted for years. You are in prime muskie waters. Weeds will be everywhere and quite a bit of weed growth around miss watsons place. Usual baits, bucktails, minnow baits, glide baits, jerkbaits and give topwater a try (caught one on a topraider last week. Not a numbers lake but does hold trophy fish. I hooked a monster last week in doyle bay, not far from you and lost him at the boat, probably a 40 lb. fish. Hooked and moved may fish on reefs and weeds but reefs seemed better. Only boated the one on a topraider. Still had a great, enjoyable week. Smally action was good in 10-14 foot of water with rocks. I usually jig them with a 3-4 inch grub or a leech(real or gulp leech), Spinners, rattlebaits and topwaters will also produce but jigging will yield many more fish. Caught several 18 inchers and probably 150 smallmouth last week. smallmouth fishing got tough when the weather was bright and sunny but pretty good when it was overcast. Forgot to mentiion Glass bay is the place to go for smallies, its polluted with them. Olson and shaunnessy not bad either. We don't fish lakers unless we are up early spring and they are still shallow. As for guides, don't know of any except you might check with Green isle lodge(native canadians) or manitou weather station. They have websites. Pike I don't target but i catch them when throwing for musky. Caught a 37 incher last week. Good luck have fun, huge body of water with plenty of rocks, you should have the place pretty much to yourselves then also. Let me know if I can be of any further help. Eric MacDonald"
1337519,Skywagon,2011-08-05 05:14:00,1106,"We fish the lake for trout a few times in the winter, but have never fished it in the summer. I read a book describing some of the Watson's history, quite interesting. We also noticed that the house now has a new roof, great that they are fixing it up to preserve some of this countries past. Out of curiosity, how will you get to the cabin, by plane, a boat kept at Gold Rock, or do you know? You will have a great trip."
1337554,Outfitter17,2011-08-05 07:49:00,127,"bjoern,I don't know a ton about the area you will be staying at, due to it being quite a bit north of us, but if you want to email me I can give you the info on what's working down here.Matt"
1337557,bjoern,2011-08-05 08:00:00,89,"Eric and Skywagon,Thanks so much for the information. A guy named Wayne is going to pick us up somewhere and take us to Barker Bay where his boat is stored. I think my friend knows the area pretty well as far as navigation goes. It's the fishing that I am most concerned about. Is there a place to catch walleye in that area for a shore lunch or two? I think northerns are just as tasty, but I was just looking for a little variety.To all,Thanks for the encouragement about getting the Watson House restoration going. Hopefully I will be able to help my friend with some of that while we are up there, but I'll pass the words of encouragement on to him as I am sure he will appreciate it. Any more fishing information will be greatly appreciated. I can't wait to get up there!Brad"
1338014,Guest,2011-08-07 06:03:00,0,"For shore lunch I suggest northern or bass. As for walleye there are a few there, very few as far as we can tell. There are stories of Ted Davis stocking them many years ago up in Moser bay area. Ted died last winter but he told me this once many years ago. We do catch an occasional 25-30 inch walleye 1 or 2 per year around the moser bay area. No where else. We always assumed these were Teds walleye from years ago and no natural reproduction occurs. About 2 years ago while fishing a spot in Moser my brother and I jigged 6 walleye of about 16-17 inch size one right after the other . All from 1 spot and has not happened again. So obviously there are some walleye in there and they do reproduce but you are going to waste your time and go hungry if they are your primary target. Moser is up the lake toward the upper manitou about 6-7 miles away. It is not one of my favorite spots for all around fishing. Miss watsons house is in an all around good area for muskie , bass, northern. You will be putting in at Esox landing and have about a 20 mile boat ride to barker bay ,then 10 more miles to Miss watsons. Be careful and good luck. Our group just loves the Manitou. Eric"
