Got out with my best friend and fishing buddy Roloff the other evening for a couple of hours, nice to have the pup along now its warming up. Got some walleye and a few pike to bite, great way to spend an evening.VIDEO LINKhttps://youtu.be/P96Y8rtlLEw Tight lines all, boat will be coming out soon....YAY!"

Bill Thanks guys, ice fishing with Roloff is difficult, cold and distance are the main barriers having him along, now with the warmer temps he is out with me as much as possible."
