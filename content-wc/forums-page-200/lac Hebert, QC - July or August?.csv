5425298,mickr,2017-03-26 10:25:00,74,"Hi Guys I'd appreciate some thoughts from guys that have been to lac Hebert. I am looking at booking at trip there in 2018. I book a couple of 4 day guys weekend trips a year and fortunately we really don't have to travel that far to get in to decent fishing. But next summer the plan is a fly in (our first ever) and it needs to be July or August because I want to bring my high school aged son and I'm not yanking him from school for a week in June which is our typical first getaway of the year every year. So, I've got a 9 week window pending availability on the outfitter side. I'd appreciate the insight from those that have been. And if the answer is.....it doesn't really matter because the walleye fishing is that good.....even better cheersMickr"

5426338,fishron,2017-03-26 17:29:00,317,"I would certainly defer to Octanehi5 for information on Lac Hebert. Hebert is the best walleye lake I've ever been on and through my own experience there are five areas that have produced fantastic numbers and size. Early July would be my preference. The uplake cabins provide certain hotspots but midlake and south have great areas also. We have stayed on the island. My last two trips have only been for five days but we caught over nine hundred walleyes between four guys on the last trip in late June. Some might say you must get tired of catching that many but I enjoyed each and every one. I'll truly miss the trip this year but I hope you find the fishing as magical as my group has for the last three years. Air Tamarac, Jean and Elianne are a first class operation."
5437714,octanehi5,2017-03-30 14:42:00,1104,"Mickr. some of the best weeks on this lake are the last week in june through the 2nd week in july,some times very hard to book these times .a lot of guys such as myself have fished it the last week in june for 15 yrs.

If mickr wasn't interested then i have a group of 6 to 9 who are looking into fish lake Herbert. even if you can't help any advice you have would be appreciate. the one guy is looking to take his sons to Canada for the first time the rest of us have fished together off and on the last 30 years.
5458074,TheDFP,2017-04-07 04:46:00,39,My father and I will be on Hebert 10Jun-17Jun. First time on the lac and we have heard nothing but good things about the camps and fishing there. We have fished with Air Tamarac on the Gouin a number of times with very good success. First class operation who have invested in the business and the enjoyment of their clients. Hoping for overcast days with a nice breeze for the week we are there.
5459274,Powder3578,2017-04-07 14:27:00,5,We are trying to go in 2018. like you we have heard nothing but good reports on the lake and on Air Tamarac
