5420706,huntercj,2017-03-24 10:51:00,23,I have free use of a out post cabin on jackfish lake this summer. Just wondering what kinda of fishing I can expect. I have a cabin at morson Ontario we get into some fairly good fishing. Im thinking it would be fun to fish some new lakes. Any input would awesome.

Our group of three did have a good trip in mid July, walleye fishing was tough. Small Mouth fishing was pretty good! I had never been on a smallie lake before, plenty of fun catching those guy's!For me trips to Ontario are much more than just the number of fish you catch. The trip to the Pipe saw plenty of Loons working with their yearlings to learn to fly. Loons aren't a new thing for me, watching them work with the young birds to fly and dive for bait fish was. I was aware that Pipestone would not be like other Ontario lakes, we still had a good trip! Good luck and have fun!"

Walleye fishing was slow at that time, but probably, maybe, was due to us being fresh to the lake. I do remember catching a small muskie right off the island we camped on. Also, I got a number of nice lake trout in adjoining Schistose Lake. Other than getting lost out on the water after driving all night to get there, we found the lake to be very pretty. Have not been back. I believe the Jackfish Lake being referred to is in Ontario, kind of near Pipestone, not in Alberta. Bill"
