5459642,walleye/musky,2017-04-07 19:37:00,47,i was out fishing yesterday on a lake north of ear falls and it was still a full auger to drill right to the handles
5459722,Pooch,2017-04-07 20:08:00,4618,"As usual Pooch is overestimating things again. I distinctly remember that the day we blindfolded him (Pooch) and took him to the secret spot, he thoroughly tromped all over me, hogging the good spot in the boat, I was lucky to have even caught a small one.I think you were the designated picture taker that morning. It was a refreshing change for once.Also, You conveniently forgot about all the other times when you thoroughly humiliated me with that stupid pink jig tied to forty pound red braid with a three cent brass Walmart swivel. That one still wakes me up at night in a cold sweat.Oh yea, Henry still owes me a dollar on the fake bait and jig bet on Manitoba Point. That was the one and only time that will probably ever happen. I just wanted to make sure he remembers it. Does anyone ever out fish him?Pooch"
5459994,Pooch,2017-04-08 06:41:00,4618,"It happened again last night.... I was awakened by that dream again. After my (above) post last night I woke up dreaming about that extraordinarily pink jig incident again, but this time I also remembered that you were using an old Johnson spin-cast reel that had the handle spot welded on and was duct taped to a pretty good looking Shakespeare two piece Wonder rod that would have dated to the mid 1950's.I must have mentally blocked out the reel and fiberglass rod part of that day. Now I'll be afraid to lay down at night for fear of reliving that (one of several) day all over again.Surely here on WC there is a therapist that could help me work through this.Pooch"
5460258,Skywagon,2017-04-08 08:22:00,1106,"I was going to let the comment on the pink jig, ect slide, but after the second mention of it, feel a need to respond (even though I understand that due to extended years of age, your memories are probably clouded). Here are the facts: I would never squander money on a fancy painted jig, a straight hook and 3/8 machine washer was good enough for Grandpa and it is good enough for me. I have no idea where you came up with the idea I have a fiberglass 2 piece rod, the metal rod I use is the same one I have always had...and as for the reel, you should really remember how proud I am of that Zebco 303 that I found at the garage sale. I hope this information helps to clarify the facts. Tell all your friends in the home I said hi."
5460314,pjshorthorn,2017-04-08 08:43:00,5654,"Sky, I feel your pain. A couple of years ago, our lodge owner graciously invited us to tag along to one of his Super Secret Squirrel Spots ( that is called a 4S spot if anyone needs to use the code word ). We followed him and his wife out that morning in our boats and within minutes of the owner's marker bouy being deployed, my fishing partner runs his boat over the marker multiple times, hogs the whole reef with constant movement and to make matters worse....the owner left to another 4S spot I've yet to find.....and I had to embarrassingly had to return the marker buoy to him. Sometimes you just can't find a good fishing partner that won't horn in another persons fishing space. PjShorthorn"
5460362,pjshorthorn,2017-04-08 09:09:00,5654,"I'm really sorry , I think ? , about bringing this subject matter up. I didn't realize it was such a deep rooted emotional issue that you have been dealing with. I could suggest a number of therapists here on WC, but I'm reluctant to do so as I don't know what their consultation fees are. I myself would be happy to talk with you to sort out these issues you are having about SkyWagon and why he is so insensitive towards you and your feelings. My fee is $ 18.99 / hr. The 99 cents is my initial consultation fee which is non-refundable . The remaining $18/ hr is a price break as I will most likely be reviewing WC posts while listening to your emotional drama....errr....distress. If you want to clear all of this stress up quickly, I can help you emulate your superhero fisherman and make you feel like the best fisherman ever in just a few days. PM me your address and I'll mail you one of my square steel rods, a two piece Wonder Rod as a backup, a handful of pink jigs with glitter that I painted with nail polish recommended by Bill Krecja, a half dozen of my almost famous hand tied spinner rigs just to play with when you are befuzzled and a Zebco 303 spooled with 38 3/4 lb red mono - guaranteed not to twist .As an extra bonus , I'll throw in a couple of snap swivels in case you want to pull some cranks. All of this costs a one time fee of $73.03. The three cents is for the cheap O Walmart swivel to round things out. Looking forward to hearing from you before you lose too much more sleep. PjShorthorn"
5460546,Pooch,2017-04-08 11:39:00,4618,Now you drag poor Bill Krejca into this mess. Soon after he an I met face to face he moved and has never told me where. I'm thinking he is in the witness protection program OR he escaped from the old Airglide where fishermen are taken for a thirteen step fishing detox place. And that is the reason for his tendency to not buy store bought tackle. Notice he also makes his jigs out of tin and hot glue. They don't allow you access to lead in that place. Now how would I know that......Pooch
5460970,Bill Krejca,2017-04-08 19:08:00,6107,"They say that too much lead affected old time hat makers who were exposed to lead in their manufacturing process, hence (note the term hence) the expression ""Mad as a hatter"". I don't like to be mad, have enough other peculiarities without being mad. Senile, I can handle, don't remember yesterday, so only a day can go by, and then I tell the same jokes (they say) over. That said, I just figure it would be a natural non-mad progression since I have on numerous occasions been told to ""get the lead out"", to go to lighter and lighter pouring material. I've been eyeing the various marshmallow displays in the store, and think maybe I can freeze dry some tiny buggers, around a red right angle hook. Then to coat with that new toenail finish I've been testing out inside my socks daily for some time. Serious experiments require a proper amount of time before sharing with the general public. Maybe only the ER staff will ever know the test results. Re: Waking up after experiencing bad tackle syndrome, and then just laying there, a partial go to sleep remedy may be found by imagery. In this case, mental concentration on the many spiral markings on that white Wonderod as it is slowly turned over and over and over, eyes progressing from the butt (of the rod) towards the tip, over and over and over, past each of the original 4 guides, to the tip, then back from the tip, moving in the opposite clockwise direction toward... by then sleep should have been achieved. Therapy bill will be forwarded end of the month. Oh, yeah, suggestions for making other super home made tackle/tackle experiments can be made directly to me, at my new address. Its been a long winter. Bill"
5461306,pjshorthorn,2017-04-08 23:25:00,5654,"Whew !!!! When I first started reading your response, I was a little concerned that you would make a comment like, "" And I really enjoy the feeling of cotton balls between my toes while the nail polish dries on my toes and jigs."" . Your whole post would have gotten kinda weird and a little awkward at that point. Strangely enough, I feel much better after reading about the Wonder Rod therapy treatment you offer. I have always felt skeptical about hypnosis , but this could actually be the ticket in order to turn me into an actual fisherman and not just that sad "" bait soaker "" status I've been given by so many people. I'm also thinking that if you can build some jigs that look like a very sophisticated shoe in a high heel or pump style, you may be onto something that will attract those beautiful female walleyes. Of course accessories like a nice pocketbook or bracelet would be another great offering. Imagine having two jigs like that being trolled off of a three way swivel.....the girls wouldn't be able to resist the temptation to bite both. I was also thinking that a few lingere style jigs might be popular with the girls, but how would one know what size or style the female walleyes really want ? I shall leave these complicated ideas for you to ponder while watching the Wonder Rod twirl. PjShorthorn"
5453314,Pooch,2017-04-05 13:20:00,4618,"I think that morning when Henry was driving that I kept my eyes closed and trusted that he knew where all the surprises were. In retrospect, he's driving your boat and you were unconcerned so I should have known it was OK. Or at least I saw little if any fear in your eyes.Got a good local soft hail downpour here a couple hours ago. Would have been ugly six weeks from now.Since you are between hard and soft I'd think that your better half might stand a chance of getting some real work out of you for a few weeks. You're probably about out of all the firewood she cut, split and stacked last fall, aren't you?Pooch"
5454386,Aspencreek,2017-04-05 20:05:00,2911,"YUP, I hope you are right because that's what I see to now that you pointed it out, the picture is looking SSE, originally I was thinking NNW. And the open water is a pretty deep channel of the original river before the dam if memory serves."
5454978,Bstar,2017-04-06 05:33:00,564,"Pooch, it appears that you are correct. That looks like Manitoba Pt and the point on the left is Big Island and the open water is Poplar Narrows. The plane is heading pretty much due north and the photo is looking ESE."
5457562,walleye/musky,2017-04-06 19:34:00,47,you are right that is manitoba point in the back. the open water is poplar narrows and its open when its ~30 in the middle of winter very bad ice on that lake in winter . as for the other lakes there is still 3 feet of ice
5458090,Skywagon,2017-04-07 04:50:00,1106,"3 feet (as in 36 inches) of ice on the other lakes in the area? If we all had one of your tape measures, catching 30 inch walleye would be an every day occurrence."
5458442,pjshorthorn,2017-04-07 08:22:00,5654,"I have about a dozen of the "" correct measure "" tapes you speak of. Guaranteed not to mismeasure anything at any time . I'll send you a couple for the boat It comes with a handy conversion chart in mm so you will know the proper length in metric for all those small fish that Pooch says you catch PjShorthorn"
5459010,Pooch,2017-04-07 11:44:00,4618,Wait a minute!!! How did I get drawn into this conversation?Pooch
5459034,pjshorthorn,2017-04-07 11:54:00,5654,Guilt by association .....maybe ?????.....or it could be just because you successfully identified the area of Lac Seul in the post. PjShorthorn
5459442,Pooch,2017-04-07 17:21:00,4618,"""Skywagon"" and I met here on WC a number of years ago and try to time it so we can fish together once a year when I'm up his way. (Ontario) He and his fishing/flying partners are a hoot. I mean it's non stop chatter. Since some of them grew up on and around LS they know the area well and always catch fish. Fishing with them is always a learning experience and about as much entertainment as one can absorb in a day.Anytime I can share a boat with them I will.It's been a pleasure to know these guys and get a chance to fish with them from time to time. The banter amongst them is sophisticated and witty. I only wish I could spend more time with them. I think they fish several times a week all year, but for the brief period between hard to soft to hard water.Pooch"
5459450,Skywagon,2017-04-07 17:22:00,1106,"As usual Pooch is overestimating things again. I distinctly remember that the day we blindfolded him (Pooch) and took him to the secret spot, he thoroughly tromped all over me, hogging the good spot in the boat, I was lucky to have even caught a small one.On a more serious note, today we ran down to Ft Frances on an errand and saw a Polaris Ranger side by side 3/4 submerged under the ice close to the float plane base on Rainy (east of Ft Frances). We also heard about another 4-wheeler that had went through the ice in that area. Saw two boats fishing the river close to town. It is definitely time to switch gears and think open water."
5451266,fishnwo,2017-04-04 17:17:00,16,The ice is deteriorating fast! Here are some pics of Lac Seul taken by Wayne on his way to work this morning!
5451418,pjshorthorn,2017-04-04 18:18:00,5654,"Sorry, but I don't know where Wayne works. What area of Lac Seul are these pictures from ? Thanks for posting them. PjShorthorn"
5451514,fishnwo,2017-04-04 19:03:00,16,He was flying to an Outpost up near Cat Lake... these pictures are the base of McKenzie Bay looking East and West.
5451610,Pooch,2017-04-04 19:42:00,4618,"Seems early for that much open water?I keep looking at the pictures and can't wrap my mind around the location, even though we have fished that area.I'm certainly not a pilot, but with that much open water, the ice has to be rotten. Is Cat lake still frozen in and safe to land on ski's? Or was he just out looking?Pooch"
5451666,pjshorthorn,2017-04-04 19:52:00,5654,I'm with you Pooch. I went down to the basement and looked at my wall map of Lac Seul and couldn't place the area other than the fact that fishnwo said the base ( southern end ? ) of Mackenzie Bay. With that kind of open water I was guessing it could be close to a narrows like Shanty where there would be good current going into big water areas that would break up first if there was a decent blow. Kind of fun to look at that map again. PjShorthorn
5451706,Pooch,2017-04-04 20:00:00,4618,"In this picture (I turned it up right) I marked what appears to be Manitoba Point. Is that right? And to the right (but not visible) in the the picture would be towards Shanty Narrows area?It looks like this picture is looking out the right side of the plane as he is flying over the opening to McKenzie Bay with that first large rock pile (island) as you enter the bay just off the right side of the aircraft.If so, now I've got my bearings. If not then I'm confused. Thanks,Pooch"
5451738,Pooch,2017-04-04 20:07:00,4618,Looks like we are looking at the Shanty Narrows area in this picture.Is that right? This is kind of interesting trying to pick out landmarks as I've never flown over the area and am too lazy to dig out a map.Pooch
5452042,Skywagon,2017-04-05 05:53:00,1106,"Possibly because you were blindfolded the day you were there? The ice is going fast, still 20"" in places, half that in others, the shorelines are starting to go in places. The fun is about over, putting winter toys away, we are about to arrive at the ""tween"" season."
5452202,fishnwo,2017-04-05 06:55:00,16,"Hello Pooch, Wayne here... I am flying from Indian Lake Chain to my Outpost in Cat Lake area on skis. However ice is deteriorating quickly, and along with the warm weekend coming up this will be my last flight on skis for the season. We'll be pulling the plane off the ice Friday morning. Every year, once I pull the planes off, it is usually 2 weeks later that I'm flying on floats if the warm weather continues. When going North, my flight path takes me down the middle of McKenzie Bay on Lac Seul while going North and East. The pictures I took are looking out on both sides of the Base of McKenzie Bay."
5452482,Bill Krejca,2017-04-05 08:33:00,6107,"Gotta echo the ""kinda early"" theme. My WAG is that it may be a week earlier than what is considered normal. Present weather continuing, my guess is all-open in customary fishing waters way before end of April. Bill"
