In fact, I talked to my boss who was on that trip and he remembers our outfitter saying, if you want to catch a thirty inch walleye, Indian is the lake to fish. I'm now finding out that it is indeed a trophy walleye lake. It's large and deep and has only one outfitter on it. The only other outfitter I know is on Mameigwess."
5455226,turtle chain,2017-04-06 06:47:00,1398,When we were there a boat went out at night and caught some big ones.It is not a walleye lake like lac suel not even a close 2nd.The boy's on lac suel always said a deep clear lake with trout in it is not the best walleye water. my 2 cent's
5455570,fishmanric,2017-04-06 08:25:00,219,Deep clear lakes won't have the numbers but will have the big fish. They also will be harder to fish. I'm going to Lac Seul for the numbers as there have been very few reports of anyone catching walleyes over thirty inches. It seems Lac Seul has many 28-29 inch fish. Lac Seul sure has every type of structure known to man. I can't wait until I fish this hump that drops off into eighty feet of water.
5455642,turtle chain,2017-04-06 08:37:00,1398,Indian has some great structure .The production day in and day out just isn't there I wish it was we would still be going there.They used to commercial fish it not sure if they still do?? sorry good luck
5455666,pjshorthorn,2017-04-06 08:43:00,5654,"Rick, You are correct that there are a bunch of 28 & 29"" walleyes in Lac Seul. There are plenty of 30"" fish too. At the time of the year you are going, all of the fish that I have caught in those sizes have come in 8-20 fow. If you end up parking the HB over towards Wesley Bay, there are a few spots between Pine Point and Hyslop Island/ Windy Narrows. There are at least 5 reefs that drop from 10/20 fow into 40 ,60, 80 and 100 fow. I think the fish will be in that 15-20fow range even if there are really deep drops adjacent to the reefs. PjShorthorn"
5455778,fishmanric,2017-04-06 09:19:00,219,"PjShorthorn, I believe you are correct. How productive have the bays been over the years. Wesley Bay has that long point coming out at the entrance as well as a hump inside. So many spots to fish and so little time. Good thing the days are long that time of year."
5443642,fishmanric,2017-04-02 07:48:00,219,"Hunting around the web and wasting time looking at different lodges and outposts, I ran across this place. http://www.agimacriveroutfitters.ca/. One of the testimonials is probably the most incredible I have ever read. Many years ago I actually fished this lake for a bit, mainly the southern section. Just wondering if anyone else has info on this lake."
5444938,fishmanric,2017-04-02 16:51:00,219,When I fished this lake we came from Mameigwess Lake through Ripple Lake. I see it is also connected to Little Indian and Sandbar. Looks to have nice structure in the north and is deep also. The camp prices are very reasonable.
5446250,camp chef,2017-04-03 08:30:00,915,"Fished out of Agimak river outfitters maybe 7 or 8 times...staying in their cabins. this was with different owners so I can't speak to the new owners but the Lake is incredible...World class Walleye ,Northern and Lake trout available. This is a huge body of water."
5446914,fishmanric,2017-04-03 11:58:00,219,"Howdy Camp Chef, One of the testimonials had a group catching fifteen to twenty Walleye over thirty inches and 175 over twenty five. Those are numbers unheard of. My main body of water is only a 45 minute drive down 17 to get there. Might be worth booking for a week and sneaking down there. It is definitely on my radar."
5447066,camp chef,2017-04-03 12:59:00,915,not knowing the size of group they had I can believe those numbers could be possible. If you were going to do it......that would be the lake.
5447114,turtle chain,2017-04-03 13:07:00,1398,"we were there about 10 years ago good prices The dirt road to get there can beat your equipment up.the fishing was good for Northern's, walleye was ok at best we moved on to lac suel for better walleye fishing good luck"
5449210,fishmanric,2017-04-04 06:37:00,219,"They had a group of eleven. Turtle Chain, I will be fishing Lac Seul for the first time this July. It will be another body of water to check off my bucket list. Best fishing I ever had was at North Caribou Lake back in the seventies."
5450122,turtle chain,2017-04-04 09:53:00,1398,Lac Suel Good choice much better walleye waterwe had one of the best days of northern fishing ever on Indian. Back to back to back 40 plus in 2 feet of water on surface plugs one of them is on my wall just awesome good luck
5450418,fishmanric,2017-04-04 11:40:00,219,"Awesome stuff Turtle Chain. My main body of water that I fish now is the Wabigoon Chain. Indian Lake is just down the road, so I'm thinking at some point I may give it a shot. When it comes to fishing, nothing is lost. $365 a person for the week is very reasonable."
5455010,Guest,2017-04-06 05:40:00,0,Don't get confussed with the Indian chain that is located near the community if Vermillion west of Dryden!
