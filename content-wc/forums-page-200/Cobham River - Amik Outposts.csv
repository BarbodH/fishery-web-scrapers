5456842,Bstar,2017-04-06 15:18:00,564,"We stayed at the Morley outpost in Aug. '11 and the walleye fishing was phenomenal. Numbers and size were outstanding. We used jigs, spinner rigs and crankbaits. Jigs caught the biggest fish which was 27"". We had several fish in the mid 20's. 18-20"" seemed to be average. It's a great fishery you'll enjoy it."
5452298,jnoelting,2017-04-05 07:33:00,6,Our group is close to booking a fly in with Amik to the Cobham River this September. We are not new to Amik but need some help with the Cobham. We would like any information someone might be able to provide us about Cobham River especially those of you who have fished one of the Cobham outposts in September. Thanks
5452594,Mike Borger,2017-04-05 09:15:00,1554,"Haven't fished it myself - yet. But fwiw I've heard tremendous things about this river and the outpost camps on it. It's right at the very top of my own personal hit list.In general I've always found river systems to be the most productive fisheries, at least for large pike, and this system looks spectacular."
5452634,tsquared,2017-04-05 09:23:00,57,"We have fished it a few times, usually 2nd week of August. PM me and we can talk and I can grab some old maps too. River camp is my favorite on Cobham, especially for the Pike."
5452674,jambi,2017-04-05 09:51:00,504,"tsquared - how much current is in the system? is it moving all over, or just in narrows/falls area? Love this area Scott"
5453482,Golden Eagle,2017-04-05 14:20:00,2642,"Lots of trips for me. Never a bad week.Heading upstream you'll run into 2 narrow spots in the river where current speeds up just a bit, but doesn't become anything close to being rapids. Walleyes will be there. Big pike hang around downstream from moving water, in the deeper water. Hit the T in the river where you find Monument Falls. Turning right will get you to good fishing, but I'd need to take you to it, since I don't know how to explain the route. It's on my GPS. Turn left at the T and find good fishing. Walleyes and pike at small, but good rapids. Continue and you'll come to a tiny stream that will take you to Keygo Lake. Good fishing, but I don't know if there's a boat there. Can't make it all the way in a camp boat and you don't want to carry or drag your boat to Keygo.Heading downstream from log cabin you'll find walleyes all over the big water until you hit shallow, narrow water that sometimes holds tons of walleyes and several nice pike. Be aware that it's shallow, really shallow. Continue about 150 yards to more Big Water where you'll find excellent fishing for walleyes and pike. Leave Big Water and travel to where there's a 90 degree left turn. If you go right, you might find a trail that takes you to Surprise Lake for great fishing. Don't try it unless you know for sure there's a boat over there. Several years ago there was a plastic palace (plastic on a tent base) between Surprise Lake and Tough Guy Lake, but MNR did away with it and I doubt it's been rebuilt. It gave access to both lakes.If you turn left you'll come to a huge crop of cabbage on both sides of the river. Fishing is good all the way to the rapids - pretty good moving water, but shallow. You'll need to drag boat through part of the rapids. Good fishing below & above rapids. I haven't gone downstream beyond rapids.Take your own friends because you won't see anybody else on the water.There might be boats (for moose hunters) on Keygo, Surprise and Tough Guy. Take a GPS with fresh batteries in case you try walking to lakes.You'll like fishing Cobham River."

5454258,unclejoe,2017-04-05 19:20:00,22,"I have flown with Amik several times and have stayed at Cobham Daniel, Morley and River. I did like the river the best out of that system. Plenty of water to fish very cool cabin and l really like the gazebo which is screened in. on that trip we got fogged in and ended up on a nine day trip which was cool. You catch lots of walleye and big pike. I will be back to cobham river."
5454378,turkeyriver,2017-04-05 20:02:00,80,"We'll be there Aug. 31 -Sept. 5 and can't wait. Thanks Golden Eagle for all the info! I was following your description on my map and could see everything you were talking about. You just made the next few months of my life even more full of dreams! I'm also going to Cobham Daniel in July with some other family, so that will take the edge off. This will be my 4th and 5th trips with John and Rena and we haven't had a bad trip yet. My first year double dipping to Canada! Hope for many more."
5455218,tsquared,2017-04-06 06:45:00,57,I would say not much current as there are some big open areas. As you referenced mostly in narrows and falls.
5455514,jnoelting,2017-04-06 08:00:00,6,How would you rate Cobham for walleyes - it looks great for northern but we mainly fish walleyes
