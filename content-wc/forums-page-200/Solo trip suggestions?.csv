5414026,Baseline,2017-03-21 19:26:00,3207,"If you want to get out in the woods go to Agimac River Outfitters on Indian Lake. They have cabins and a campground. Indian Lake is a good lake for walleyes and has lake trout. There are 10 other drive to lakes in the area with decent ramps that are remote and lightly used. You can camp on most of these lakes with the MNR permits. I've been making trips to this area for 30 plus years and haven't lost interest. I've stayed at the resort several times, but most of the time we camp on some of the drive to lakes. I've done solo trips to this area a few times. If you are going to be solo it might be a good idea to stay at the resort in order to leave a days itinerary Some of these lake only get fished once or twice a week so if something goes wrong at least someone might come looking for you."
5456442,Guest,2017-04-06 12:43:00,0,"Thanks for your continued replies. Baseline, I'm curious about what size boat the ramps at the lakes near agimik river can handle? Golden eagle, would you be willing to share some of the locations of the solo trips you enjoyed? I'm still researching a location where I can go fo 2-3 weeks with my Labrador retriever. Prefer a low budget cabin. Would consider camping. Want to have a private or remote setting. Thanks again for your help! (Please send a private message if you'd prefer)."
5458330,Golden Eagle,2017-04-07 07:34:00,2642,"All my solo trips have been fly in. My lab was included on most. This September I plan to spend a week at a primitive campsite on a tiny island, Dale Hollow Lake. I'll also be spending Canada Thanksgiving fishing in NW Ontario while moose hunters are in camp. I have plenty of orange in my fishing wardrobe."
5303818,Hawker,2017-01-31 13:01:00,3967,"I would highly recommend Young's Wilderness Camp on LOTW, just north of Nestor Falls. Certainly a remote setting and a variety of cabins to choose from, dog friendly, and fabulous Walleye and Pike fishing (catching). While they do also have a remote fly-in outpost on Kish Lake, that lake is predominantly smallmouth and muskie.(http://www.youngswildernesscamp.com/)"
5304210,Moosebunk,2017-01-31 17:19:00,211,"$15 a day for a campsite with shower facility... Might be a bit more now. Onaman River Resort on Lake Nipigon. There's about 40 back lakes to sneak into for something different but, having quick access to Lake Nipigon you'll have plenty playground for lakers, pike, walleye and brook trout. This is a link to a trip there. Half the time was solo.http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-solo-...in-impossible/"
5306186,1K1MOA,2017-02-01 17:18:00,90,"Check out OSullivan Lake Outfitters near Nakina. They have a drive-in outpost, 1 cabin, on Stringer Lake. They offer a boat/motor on Stringer and stash boats 100 yards down a trail on Esnagami. Around $500 -v600US I believe including boat and motor for a week. A couple of years ago they gave me a fairly descent discount off the two-person rate since I was solo. I don't think it gets used much, and are likely to have a few weeks back to back. Plenty of elbow room since it is the only place on the lake. People at the lodge on Esnagami are flown in and paying thousands, check out their site, but you can fish it as part of this deal with the stashed boats on it. You can fish the smaller Stringer Lake too which has Walleye, Northern, etc. If blowing stay small, if nice, head out and explore the islands in Esnagami. The lodge is on the far north end and you are unlikely to see them if you are hanging out on the south end near the portage. About a 12 hour drive from Madison as an FYI"
5329137,Guest,2017-02-12 15:17:00,0,"Thanks very much for the additional replies. 1k1moa-what can you tell me about the cabin on stringer? Plumbing, refrigeration, bug proof, etc? Did you spend much time on stringer or mostly esnagmai? Results? How was the outfitter to work with? Are there motors on the esnagmai boats? Or, do you have to carry a motor in? Thanks again everybody for your suggestions....."
5329281,Mike Borger,2017-02-12 16:32:00,1554,"If you like O'Sullivan and have a boat, why not just head up there and find a nice island to camp on? Get your crown land camping permit from the MNR in Geraldton and away you go. I know a couple of people who have done that.Not sure what O'Sullivan's Rainbow policy is, but I do know Howard Meshake at O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters has let people launch their boat and park their car at his place for a small fee."
5337561,1K1MOA,2017-02-16 11:18:00,90,"I didn't stay there, I did another option on that trip. If I recall is propane for appliances and you carried motor on portage. Can't speak to bug proof, I always carry a Sea to Summit bug net (big enough for two, works great in cabin or wild), just in case needed. It is only 8 ounces and very small."
5353633,Guest,2017-02-24 11:21:00,0,"Thanks for the suggestions and info. Mike, I had checked with osullivans golden rainbow about launching/parking previously and they aren't set up for it. I hadn't thought of checking with Howard. That said, it would be nice (but not absolutely necessary) to have a reasonable cabin or if camping, access to a shower etc. Any other thoughts? Is anyone familiar with the stringer lake cabin? thanks again for sharing your knowledge and ideas...greatly appreciated."
5369586,1K1MOA,2017-03-02 14:25:00,90,"Howard owns the Stringer Lake outpost, he should be able to fill you in with all the details, how much it has been used, etc."
5409938,schoolofhardknocks,2017-03-20 13:46:00,29,"I alternate between solo and one additional person (my wife or son). I am in the minority here I think, but I get so much contact throughout the year that bringing 8 beer-drinking bulls***ting buddies with me and the constant socializing actually is not a vacation for me. I do only remote fly-ins. Here is the deal though: why would someone fly you into a cabin for 4-10 people when he can get all the $$$ from a full group? 1) Only if it is last minute and they can't fill it AND you are midway between point A and C, so that you essentially pay for the fuel for the other outposts. 2) You aren't a pain in the butt and experienced enough to be NO bother at all. 3) You pay as if you were 2 or more people. If you do this, then there are a couple of principles I adhere to: 1) Watch EVERY step you take outside. You're alone and a fall could be bad news. That goes for using your axe/hatchet and any time you are near a stove. etc. 2) In the last few years I have rented a sat phone from https://www.mobal.com/ AND I always plan on spending the night in the woods when I go out in case I break down a long ways away and the wind prevents me from getting back. Bring an extra mosquito net in case you have a night in the woods. I also try fish where IF I have a breakdown, the prevailing wind will give me a fighting chance to get back to the cabin. Did you know most people go their entire lives without ever really being alone for any period of time?! I mean REALLY alone like when a float plane drops you off and leaves you there for a week. Oh,and by the way, I did get Hanta Virus as many of you know, so IF you are the first one in a rodent-infested cabin, take precautions."
5410594,Golden Eagle,2017-03-20 18:40:00,2642,"I've made a lot of solo trips. Never thought much about it, just did it. They provided many interesting experiences and great fishing."
5291498,GoNorth,2017-01-25 11:17:00,3,"I'm recently semi retired, live near Madison, WI and would like to spend a couple weeks in NW Ontario fishing with my black lab during the 2017 season. Friends aren't able to commit to more than a week and I want to spend more time. Looking for a place that has a remote feel, probably drive to or boat in, budget minded. Camping is also a possibility. Interested in something like o'Sullivan's, especially their outpost, but they don't allow dogs. Focus is walleye and northern. Have fished Nungesser in the past and enjoyed it very much. I've read through many posts, but still looking. Please send a personal message if you prefer. Thanks!"
5291730,btyreprich,2017-01-25 13:17:00,1067,Our favorite lodge is Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls. This lodge is on Lac Seul and I have seen people bring their dogs up with them. You just need to clean up after your dog of course. This lodge has cabins / of various sizes and I think you'll be happy here. Give Pat a call - she is very nice.
5292418,prov1800,2017-01-25 18:08:00,5010,Just spoke to the owner (al rempel)at cedar lake lodge on cedar lake.camp is on a island.100 acres for you and the dog to explore.he said he allows dogs.great fishing on cedar.smaller lake 17 miles long and has bonus crappies.
5292442,prov1800,2017-01-25 18:18:00,5010,Here is the info on the camp.www.sportfisfin.com 1-204-890-7272[email protected]
5292722,Rich B,2017-01-25 20:29:00,1081,"Al runs a nice clean camp, with plenty of areas for your dog....Pro1800 is right that the Cedar Lake chain is also a great fishery, with smaller (so to speak) bays that are protected enough to fish most days (even with a strong wind) and easy to navigate by yourself. Rich B"
5293202,fsz,2017-01-26 08:34:00,144,"It is a bummer about O'sullivan not allowing dogs, I was looking at staying there and had to rule it out too. There is an outfitter on the twin lakes in nakina who allows dogs I believe. Mike borger posted a report on fall walleye and speck fishing plus his partner did some grouse hunting. Walleye and pike right on twin lakes, other fishing available (inc. specs) at back lakes. Think it was called twin lakes resort. I Tried booking there, they allowed dogs (but maybe only in hunting season?) but they were full. Ended up at Pasha Lake. No significant fishing on the lake there, but countless lakes to fish in the surrounding area. The owner is helpful and KNOWLEDGEABLE about the area! There is a camping area and if you camp you have access to the lodge that has bathrooms with showers. A trip there does involve some driving to the back lakes daily, again fishing right at the lodge is not that good, just be aware of that. When I was there the other guys in camp were friendly. Lots hang out at the lodge to bs/have a drink after dark. Occasionally, there are groups with odd number who open to having someone join them to avoid ""3 in a boat""."
5298442,GoNorth,2017-01-29 06:46:00,3,"Thanks for the replies! I'm wondering if there may be more suggestions out there. Especially for any places with a little more ""elbow room"" between cabins, maybe your own dock type of thing. Really want to have a remote feel/privacy. It's such a huge, wonderful area up there.....you are a great source of information. I've learned a lot from you in the time I've spent reading on here. Greatly appreciate your help."
5298650,prov1800,2017-01-29 08:16:00,5010,Hard finding those options.you mentiibed your on a budget.what is your budget.sounds like your looking for a private cabin.those dont come cheap or might not allow dogs either.the camp i mentiond (cedar lake lodge )is about the most freedom you will get.100 acres.most camps dont have docks for each cabin.
5303098,GoNorth,2017-01-31 09:23:00,3,Looked at cedar lake lodge some more. I see they have an outpost cabin. does anyone have any experience with it? Prov1800: budget is in the range of cedar lake. Maybe up to $650 a week. Just want to feel like I'm away from it all-Wilderness Type experience. Thanks again.
5303226,prov1800,2017-01-31 09:40:00,5010,That outpost is a fairly large cabin on a island half way toward main lodge.its has power.pretty bushy and another private cabin on the other end of the island (friends of mine)bit of a stairway to cabin.would be alright if you wanted more solitude.
