5442154,bruceemail,2017-04-01 10:07:00,4,Hello Fellow Fishing peeps!! A group of 4 of us are looking to head up to Bertrand Lake at the end of July/beginning of August. This is our 2nd fly-in trip (went to Action Lake last year and had a great time. Looking for some larger fish this year hopefully! :-) ) Does anyone have any information they would like to share? Thank you in Advance! Alan

We are mainly walleye fishermen but ran into some great fishing (at least for us) on bigger gators. We ended up with 7 fish over 40"". Most of the walleye's were in the 14""-18"" range and the largest one was 26"". One of the nicer cabins I have stayed at in Canada and it includes a sauna which we used several times last year. We have been real happy with Wayne/Karla and their staff and will be fishing Bertrand again this year. You can see our full fishing report and some pictures from last June on their website."

5445010,kona77,2017-04-02 17:27:00,236,Mike;I have been looking at too many of your wonderful trip reports and pictures of giant gators.. Most of our big fish were caught the last two days from the same bay. I doubt we will have ever so much luck again but we will try again this year.
