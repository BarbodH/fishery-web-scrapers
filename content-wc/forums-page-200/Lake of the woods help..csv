5444954,Lake Of The Woods,2017-04-02 17:05:00,124,I'm assuming it would be one of the two locations shown on the attached maps marked with a red 'X'. That's the only two Ojibway of Onigaming First Nation Reserves that I know of which rent cabins in that area. They are Sabaskong First Nations IR35C & IR35D both accessible by road.
5445826,Bill Krejca,2017-04-03 05:59:00,6107,"The ""X"" on the second map is where the landing is. Just to the west, 1/2 mile, is where the old reserve settlement was. Dad stopped there, lost, in 1936 to get directions from the folks living there. Pretty much all grown over today. Bill"
5447570,fishpoop,2017-04-03 15:53:00,630,"Like I said in a prior post I can't really help with walleye info up there as I was always targeting muskies. However, I can give you two generalized fishing tips for the area. 1. Red/Green Buoys. Fish them. Any of them, all of them. Not only do they mark the navigation channel in a area but they mark rock piles, reefs, shallow areas that fish use. Doesn't matter what species you're seeking, sooner or later they'll all show up near those buoys. Also, for safety's sake, be certain what side of the buoy is the safe boating channel and what side has the danger. Those red and green colors have meaning. Be sure you know how to read them. 2. As you motor along, anywhere you go up there, watch the shoreline for sand. Sand is important because there is so much rock everywhere. In this case sand provides that ""something different"" feature in an area, unlike most lakes where you might be trying to find rocks because of so much sand/gravel/muck. It's kind of a reversal. One other thing about the sand shorelines, there is usually a weedbed in the area. Weeds can be important up there because there's not as many of them due to all the rock. Weeds can't grow in rocks but they can on sand. Transition areas between sand/weed/rock can be very important locations to fish. So there are two simple tips for finding fish up there that all you need is your eyes and being observant of your surroundings as you go along."
5432914,fishpoop,2017-03-28 23:07:00,630,"I really don't know where the First Nations cabins are. The O.P. said Nestor Falls so I assumed they were down in that area. So, yeah, if they're near Turtle Lake then that's not very far at all of a boat ride to Burrow or Miles Bay. I'll trust your distance estimates much more than mine as its been a few years since I've been up there and you live there.I used to run from Red Wing Lodge to Buckeye Island area and I thought that was about 15 miles but maybe my memory isn't as sharp as it used to be. I can't help with walleye fishing advice because I never fished them up there. I was always after muskies and left the walleye gear at home."
5433306,Obabikon,2017-03-29 06:26:00,2370,"Yeah, I make the drive a lot more than most (sometimes 3-4 trips per day), and measuring distances is something that GPS units have made pretty easy anymore. Buckeye isn't quite that far from Redwing since you can cut down the channel after you get past Black Island. If I were to guess... 11 miles. Obviously... all the distances you run depend on the route you take in the first place. From Morson Marina to Obabikon going around Rabbit Point is right at 8.1 miles of driving. (I've never been able to cut enough corners to get it less than that) The first nations cabins are up on a hill on the Aulneau just before you get to Duck Bay Lodge. Only reason I know is because someone asked about them, and I had no clue they were there. So, I did some research. I really have no clue where they launch our of, but they say its a 15 minute boat ride. If that's the case... it can't be Nestor. More likely it would be off the road that runs down Stevens Bay. Young's Wilderness use that ramp too. Very convenient for their location."
5433354,Baseline,2017-03-29 06:38:00,3207,"I'm not sure where First Nations is, but if they use the Steven Bay ramp you will be close to some good walleye fishing. I've stayed on Crow Lake and used that ramp to access LOW. I've fished the big bay adjacent to Hay Island which is about 6 miles out from the ramp. There are lots of reefs and some current moving through the that area. Fish the reefs with jigs and minnows or leeches. 1/2 a crawler works to. You should be able to find plenty of walleyes without going all the way to Miles."

5433418,Hawker,2017-03-29 06:50:00,3967,"Per their (First Nations) website, it appears their launch is at Morson. Duck Bay has a launch next to YWC launch at the far east end of Stevens Bay, and unless something has drastically changed (which I doubt) no one other than Duck Bay or YWC guests can utilize these private launches."
5433554,Obabikon,2017-03-29 07:25:00,2370,Most of Duck Bay's guests park at Pier North in Morson. I missed that on First Nation's website that they launch out of Morson. I wonder why they even mention Nestor Falls for that cabin.
5433722,Bill Krejca,2017-03-29 08:01:00,6107,"I wasn't aware of cabins of FN near Turtle.They do have their own landing just outside of Stevens, which they use night and day. Just west of Young's is a landing which is used by various on-the-road camps, and the FN landing is maybe 1-1/2 miles west of there, perhaps 1/2 mile east of the old reservation site. Bill"
5433794,Thompmd,2017-03-29 08:12:00,320,"Hi,I'm not a walleye guy but have stayed in Sabaskong(Nestor Falls) around 10x, all in June as early as June-26. We have seen weather as low as 32 and as high as 90. We never ventured out as far as Miles.We caught plenty of walleyes in the just pitching a simple jig/minnow into the outside edges of the weed beds. BPS has kits w/assorted colors and I believe ours were 1/8-1/4.We caught lots of bass,northern walleye and always a few muskies(up to 49"") by casting baits that almost anything would bite like rattle-trap type baits, spinnerbiats crankbaits etc. We targeted smallmouth(small round rock banks).We moved to the Shoal Lake area of LOTW a couple years ago just for a change.We did hire one of the first nation guys our first year, for walleye actually and it helped. I believe his name was Mick Copenance.Good luck, you'll love the area/lake."
5436834,Walleyeguy70,2017-03-30 09:42:00,12,Thank you to everyone who replied!We cant wait to get up there this June.Bill
5437202,Bill Krejca,2017-03-30 11:11:00,6107,Please give us a report when you return. Bill
5429298,Walleyeguy70,2017-03-27 15:47:00,12,"Taking the family up for a fishing trip the middle of June and have never fished the Sabaskong, Burrows Bay and Miles Bay area of the lake.Is the fishing good in that area? Will I have to travel far to get on some good Walleye action? What should I bring for bait? I really do enjoy fishing with bobber and a leech, but I am set up to troll also.Thanks for all the help with my questions."
5429362,Obabikon,2017-03-27 16:17:00,2370,"That time of year, most fishermen are fishing tops of reefs with a jig and minnow. The better walleye action will probably be out in Miles."
5429426,LOWrider,2017-03-27 16:37:00,40,"Where are you staying? Lots of people on this site are familiar with those areas - none more than Obabikon. Miles Bay and Jig and a Minnow is great advice just about always, but if you are bringing your family, a lot would depend on how you are rigged, where you are staying and what your expectations are as far as boat travel.Lots of resorts around Morson and islands all with their own proximity to various types of structure, and some seriously big water in places.That's one of the great parts about that area, you can troll the mud flats, cast shorelines, and jig reefs all on the same day. But it can be daunting for a first timer.The fishing can range from unbelievable to challenging, good news is that June is usually some of the best. A little more info will probably get you plenty of advice from members."
5431394,Walleyeguy70,2017-03-28 11:51:00,12,We are staying at 1st nations cabins near Nestor falls. Near Sabaskong bay near Burrow Bay and Miles Bay.
5432098,fishpoop,2017-03-28 15:57:00,630,"This is a very rough estimate on my part, but I think Miles Bay to Nestor Falls by boat would be about 25 to 30 miles. I stayed at a resort in Morson and it was a 12 to 15 mile boat run up to Miles Bay from there and maybe 8 to 10 miles to Burrow Bay. You can do it if you've got a good decent boat, good maps, and g.p.s but plan on spending time and gas money to do it. Meanwhile you are going to be going by many great fishing spots while traveling.You're going to need this map, LoTW 6214 even if you have g.p.s with maps. You can get the map elsewhere too and not just from this links. Links are for illustration of the proper map. http://shop.milwaukeemap.com/lake-of...nautical-charthttp://www.charts.gc.ca/charts-carte...um=6214&img=01If you're staying in Nestor Falls you can get bait here. I've never been in here but I've heard good things. http://www.nestorfallsbaitandtackle.com/"
5432330,wallydave,2017-03-28 17:43:00,2151,Hopefully Breezy Point will post a reply! He know that area pretty well!
5432434,Obabikon,2017-03-28 18:19:00,2370,1st nations is right near Turtle Lake. Max of 6 mile boat ride to SE Miles Bay. Morson Marina is right at 8 miles to get into Miles Bay.
5432442,Obabikon,2017-03-28 18:21:00,2370,"Oh, and I would guess it is 25 miles from 1st Nations cabins to Nestor Falls by boat. Much closer to Morson. All that said, they probably use the ramp in Stevens... which is technically north and west of Nestor."
5432706,LOWrider,2017-03-28 20:01:00,40,"So you're in a great area, with lots of options to find fish. Might want to look into a guide for a day or two, especially with your family. That's how we started out oh so many years ago. Worth the investment.With respect to how to fish, everything will work depending on the situation. But the vast majority of fishing seems to be a jig and a minnow fished off the bottom. Why? Simply because it is just the easiest and quickest way to fish. Many reefs and drop offs always seem to be open to wind and waves, and fishing with a bobber can just be a challenge, especially with many people in the boat. Trolling works well too in all conditions, but my wife thinks it's boring - oh well!I'd suggest a good supply of gold or brightly colored 1/4 oz. jigs and some minnows from any of the local resorts will put you right in the game. Now everybody that hammers 'em on slip bobbers and leeches can call me crazy!However you fish, I'm sure you'll have an awesome time. It's a blessing to be able to enjoy this tremendous lake and the people up there."
