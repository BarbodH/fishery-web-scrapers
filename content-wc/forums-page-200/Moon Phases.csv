5443474,Mike Borger,2017-04-02 06:18:00,1554,Moon phase definitely has an effect on fish! If I was only doing one big trip a year I would definitely plan it around either the full or new moon.
5443610,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-02 07:35:00,447,"I plan musky trips based on moon phase and, if it's LOTW, with the bloom in mind. On other trips I don't worry about moon phase."
5444002,Golden Eagle,2017-04-02 09:44:00,2642,"My first choice is to include a new moon, including 2 days prior and 2 days following. Second choice is a full moon, including 2 days prior and 2 days following.Half moons during a waning period can be great. Half moon during a waxing period also can be very good. When moon is straight up or straight down, don't waste it by being in the cabin taking a nap or doing your nails. It's not a time to do a shore lunch.Fishing can also be great at other times, but animal activity might be slower. Fishing will be different, but not necessarily poor. Work at figuring out where they are and how to entice them to eat your lure. Moving water can be your friend. Finding a pod of huge pike is not uncommon and I've learned that fish can be competitive (or greedy), just like people. A single fish might ignore your lure, but if a second fish takes a close look, fish number 1 might decide to attack your offering.Have you ever beaten a weed bed to death, with no results, then blast through the weeds a couple of times with your boat to stir up the fish and then start catching small pike? It works, but who wants to fish hard for a 25"" pike?"
5440570,ILScott,2017-03-31 10:59:00,139,"Just wondering how many groups plan their trip to Canada based on the phases of the moon. I personally like the full moon, but does it really matter in June? Just like some input."
5440706,BornToFish,2017-03-31 11:45:00,1224,"Greetings,The vast majority of my trips to Canada are based on weeks of the lodge's season. That is, I book next year's vacations for the same week as this season, so that I can reserve the same cabin and boat. This approach has little to do with moon phases.However, I am always aware of solunar events during the course of each day. My experience over the years has been that solunar events can have a positive influence on my fishing, but nothing that I can take to the bank. It seems as though weather trumps solunar events. You can bet that I will be on my nearest big fish spot(s) when I sense a window opening or favorable weather conditions that happen to coincide with a solunar event.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5441178,prov1800,2017-03-31 16:11:00,5010,Personally i dont buy into the moon phase.as a guide on the water daily i really dont see changes much on fish feeding.basically they eat all day long everyday.some days more and some days less.iam more worried about wind direction changes.i know muskie fisherman try to pick a moon phase to chase muskies.Personally again i dont see a big advantage unless its a mental one.most guides got to go out everyday and do their best to put there guests on fish moon phase or not.if you know good spots your always going to catch OR see fish.
5441186,Pooch,2017-03-31 16:18:00,4618,"I really don't see a difference in full or dark moon on our trips. Honestly think it's beautiful to be on the water when a full moon makes it like twilight, but more fish or larger fish? I'm not totally sold.Moon up or moon down (to me) can many times be an indicator. Sometime when you get on a hot middle of the day bite, look around and see if you can see the moon somewhere in the sky.As far as planning a trip? We go when we can all get together and book the cabin we want.Pooch"
5441274,BornToFish,2017-03-31 17:32:00,1224,"Greetings,There is considerable wisdom in what Prov1800 had to say.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5441314,Obabikon,2017-03-31 17:52:00,2370,"In my opinion, Musky are very much affected by the moon phases. I'm not sure any of the other species of fish make much difference. As pointed out, weather is a MUCH bigger issue."
5441506,adempsey2.0,2017-03-31 19:55:00,612,"This article might be of interest.http://www.in-fisherman.com/rigged-r...st-times-fish/I've never planned a trip around the moon phases though. Not sure I ever had the opportunity anyway. Too many other ""real life"" variables to consider first."
5441858,pjshorthorn,2017-04-01 06:25:00,5654,"Never planned a freshwater trip around moon phases. I go when I can and when there is an opening at the lodge I want to visit. Never really thought much about how the moon may or may not have an impact on the fishing. I just go out and fish. Now saltwater fishing, that is a whole different story. I have planned many trips around the moon phases. There is a considerable impact on how strong the tides changes will be based on the moon phase. If the tide is slack, you might as well sit on shore and drink something cool with little pink umbrellas in the glass. If the tide change incoming and/or outgoing is a foot or more, you better hang on as the fish can be really active. I can recall one trip, on a full moon in September, where three of us played ""ring around the rosie"" in a center console Carolina Skiff on an outgoing tide that was ripping.. We would cast out the left side of the boat, walk our bait to the stern by which time you were normally hooked up. Fight the fish to the right side of the boat and land it up in the bow. One person casting, one person getting bit, one person landing a fish.....repeat for two hours. We must have landed 50 or more big redfish that ranged from 22-40"" in those two hours. It was kind of crazy. PjShorthorn"
5442330,BreezyPoint,2017-04-01 12:23:00,1581,"I think I may have posted this before, but here is a hart showing the moon phase data for more than 14,000 Muskie caught at Red Wing Lodge. Draw whatever conclusions you like.http://www.redwinglodge.net/wp-conte...Moon-Phase.pdfSent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
5442754,ILScott,2017-04-01 18:11:00,139,Thanks for all the replies. We usually go the second week in June and when it is a full moon the fishing is awesome. Plus it is never really dark.
