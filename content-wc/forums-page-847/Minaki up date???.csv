I am taking my dad this year and this might be his last trip (heart problems) so I would like to make this a special trip. Last year at this same time we found the walleyes in 50 feet of water on Big Sand. Is the crankbait bite still going in the evenings?? Any patterns and general areas for the muskies would be appreciated. I am also looking at a couple of lots and cabins while I am up. I love this area and would love to spend my summers up here when I retire, any leads on upcomming listings would be appreciated. Sure hope that the fires get under control, any updates on this would also be appreciated. My email address is [email protected] thanks in advance for any help, I can't wait !!!!!!!!!!!!"

I do know they called off the water bombers and were fighting is from the ground. It was a shame to see all the damage from the fire. Now to the fishing. The trolling bite was a little off this year. We wehn up in the mornings and evening a couple times and had little to show. We boat 6 fish in one morning about 2 hours the biggest was 12"". In all we boated about 25 fish trolling all small. We did put a nice fishing in the boat trolling when the wind picked up and it was cloudy is was 27"" but that was all. The reefs in big sand seemed to work fine same as every year. You might try some bigger minnows I did see some nice come on them. If you get a west wind try the little pocket off od Pickeral island. The muskies The water was 82.3 and you could see about 6"". Try the reefs in little sand and rough rock. I did see and 50"" class fish behind raspberry island there is the two little reefs. All most all the muskies were coming on top water but I would think the water is kooling a little and jerk baits might do the trick. I also had a fish clear the water and completely miss my bait up in rough rock. After the rain that REALLY help the fire the water cleaned up a little but not like normal. Well I will shut up, Have good trip and let me know how you do and if you need someone to keep an eye on that new cabin for a couple weeks a summer! LOL Bill[email protected]"
