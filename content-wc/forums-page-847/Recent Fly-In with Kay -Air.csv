The fishing was good even in all the hot weather. There were no hidden costs when it came time to pay. All in all, I think they did a great job. We had no problems when we went through the border. No licenses were asked for. Just the usual questions. My brother had a D.U.I. 5.5 years ago and we were a little concerned about it. But it never came up. The Walleye hit leeches and minnows. We would have gotten more minnows but they would have all died from the warm water. Was really surprised how low the water was on Lac Suel. Ivy"
